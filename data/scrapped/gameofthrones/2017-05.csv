They meet White Walkers, 2 of the rangers are killed and the third drops to his knees in defeat. But... the third ranger SURVIVES. The Walkers spare him. This doesn't seem like the kind of thing the White Walkers would do; they're brutal killing machines. 

We see this happen again in the series: in S2 E10, the Night's Watch are ambushed at The Fist Of The First Men. Samwell is abandoned by Edd and Grenn (who run away) leaving Samwell to cower behind a rock in fear. The White Walkers and their undead army find him... but spare him. Why have the WWs spared 2 men, when they're supposed to be on a crusade to kill everyone possible?

My theory is that when the children of the forest made the Walkers, they hard-coded commands into their brain. I suspect that the children of the forest weren't completely heartless; if the humans surrendered, then they would stop attacking. Maybe the WWs nature is to attack and kill if the enemy is fighting or retreating/running away, but to spare them if they surrender. Both Samwell and the ranger from the first episode both sank to their knees in defeat, effectively surrendering. So the best way to survive a White Walker is to yield to them.",11,53,False,spoiler,,,,,

We as audience first witness the birth of the 1st White Walker. The ritual was made in the center of some sort of symbols, which scatter through scenes throughout the series. This circle of stones serve as a calling for the same ritual to be made again. Another sacrifice. Another sightseer. Maybe another stark with greenseeing power? After thousands of years, the original Night King has grown tired of his burden/crown and calls for a replacement. They marches South in seek for a capable candidate to reign in the far North. The Starks must have this replacement in line once the White Walker marches south to insure that they go no further than Winterfell, hence the saying.

We also notice the White Walkers always spare a person to go spread the words. This serves a purpose. The one that is spared supposes to report sighting of this symbol to the people in charge. This has not been mentioned anywhere. People see this symbol as a threat, instead of a call for help. 

Tl;dr: Night King gets tired, calls for a replacement. People misinterpret this as a declaration of war.

In the show, we see the Children of the Forest create the first White Walker. I believe it was to fight for them in their war against the humans, if I'm remembering correctly. We also know that at some point the Children of the Forest lost control of the Walkers. 

So I'm now wondering, are the White Walkers

* a) A bit like robots who have gone wrong, in that they are mindlessly following their 'programming' which is to kill all humans, without having an established goal in mind other then that. 
* b) More self determining then that, and have decided to attack the humans with a specific goal or goals in mind, in-spite of the fact they were created to kill humans.
* c) Something else all together.

50,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2017-5-2,2017,5,2,4,68o18c,self.gameofthrones,[EVERYTHING] fun theories and burning swords...,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/68o18c/everything_fun_theories_and_burning_swords/,SnowSZN,1493665996,"The following is just a theory that has coincidental/interesting parallels. So i was thinking last night about the Azor Ahai prophecy and the burning sword this savior wields. For those not totally caught up, Azor Ahai wields a burning sword called Lightbringer.

The story of light bringer goes something like this:

&gt;""He labored for thirty days and thirty nights until it was done. However, when he went to temper it in water, the sword broke. He was not one to give up easily, so he started over. The second time he took fifty days and fifty nights to make the sword, even better than the first. To temper it this time, he captured a lion and drove the sword into its heart, but once more the steel shattered. The third time, with a heavy heart, for he knew before hand what he must do to finish the blade, he worked for a hundred days and nights until it was finished. This time, he called for his wife, Nissa Nissa, and asked her to bare her breast. He drove his sword into her breast, her soul combining with the steel of the sword, creating Lightbringer, while her cry of anguish and ecstasy left a crack across the face of the moon.""

Melisandre had eluded to Stannis being Azor Ahai (using Prince that was Promised interchangeably in show), and had him pull his sword from a fire to make it burn...kinda weak. Now that Stannis is gone, Mel believes Jon Snow is the prophesied leader. So this had me thinking...

If it took Azor Ahai 3 times to temper his sword into Lightbringer, maybe Mel will play the role of Nissa Nissa. 
Jon has publicly held 2 executions he carried out himself. The first was the beheading of Janos Slynt. We can consider this the first tempering. The second execution, or tempering, was on the Nights Watch brothers who murdered Jon. 
Now here is where my theory gets good. The last time we saw Mel, Davos confronted her in front of Jon about the murder/burning of Shireen. When she confesses, Jon tells her, ""Ride south today. If you ever return to the North, ill have you hanged as a murderer."" We know the Starks/Jon are true to their word, and the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword. I believe Mel will meet up w/ The Bortherhood (and maybe Arya) and return to the North/wherever Jon is. When they do, Melisandre will know that Jon will stay true to his word. Although Jon promised a hanging, Mel will insist that Jon plunge his sword into her chest (like the Nissa-Nissa prophecy). During this third public execution (3rd tempering of Lightbringer), Jon will plunge his sword into Mels chest, combining with her soul and the powers of R'hollor, creating Lightbringer. I think Mel will realize her vital and final role will be of that to help create Lightbringer, which Jon will wield into the Dark Night to defeat The Great Other as R'hollors champion.

TL/DR- After Jon's third public execution (1st on Janos Slynt and 2nd on NW Brothers who murdered him), Melisandre will insist that Jon plunge his sword into her chest, which will create Lightbringer. This mirror's Azor Ahai forging his sword three times and plunging it into Nissa Nissa's heart which ultimately creates Lightbringer. ",35,77,False,spoiler,,,,,

I was wondering about when Daenerys gets to Westeros (more so in the show since she's still fart-arsing around in Esos in the book). Assuming she doesn't just launch a full on attack somewhere the moment she comes ashore I was thinking about where she could go or end up. I don't know if it's just me but doesn't Harrenal sound like the perfect place for her?
-It's pretty much smack bang in the middle of her allies regions and pretty close to her enemies too
-It's massive, with huge kitchens for feeding and housing a large army
-The stables can hold bulk horses which is perfect for her new Khalasar , and it even seems like dragons could fit inside parts of it
-It's surrounded by the most fertile lands in Westeros and can be profitable under the right circumstances
-I think there's a few different bays and harbours nearby for her fleet
-It seems like a good place maybe to coordinate her forces now or to rule from in the future, providing she still has dragons after all this warring.
Any other ideas or theories on her gameplan or where she's headed first with all her new vengeance seeking mates?

He goes on to name all the commanders in the room then GRRM writes
""sam did not understand why milesandre should seem so interested in *him*

I love when GRRM italicizes lol. That always seems like a sign. 

This interests me because I been thinking of Sam and heartsbane. Go with me here. 

Sam is Azor Ahai

He has a valerian steel sword. Named HEARTSBANE. Heartsbane. Bane of the heart. He has a love. Gilly. Azor ahai has his nissa nissa. To make lightbringer he needed to bane her heart. Sam might have to kill gilly to become azor ahai and make lightbringer to save humanity. It was said by GRRM that a good man can be evil. Then be good again. Something along those lines. 

And the italicized words. 
*i am just the maesters steward*
No your not. You're sam the slayer

If anyone else does think this phrase, combined with the title of book 6, has more meaning, why?

""Catelyn Stark: After a fashion. I prayed for my son Bran to survive his fall. Many years before that, one of the boys came down with the pox. **Maester Luwin said if he made it through the night, he'd live. But it would be a very long night. So I sat with him all through the darkness, listened to his ragged little breaths, his coughing, his whimpering.**
Talisa Maegyr: Which boy? 
Catelyn Stark: Jon Snow. When my husband brought that baby home from the war, I couldn't bear to look at him, didn't want to see those brown stranger's eyes staring at me. So I prayed to the gods ""Take him away, make him die"". He got the pox and I knew I was the worst woman who ever lived. A murderer. I'd condemned this poor, innocent child to a horrible death all because I was jealous of his mother, a woman he didn't even know! So I prayed to all Seven Gods ""Let the boy live. Let him live and I'll love him. I'll be a mother to him. I'll beg my husband to give him a true name, to call him Stark and be done with it, to make him one of us"". 
Talisa Maegyr: And he lived? 
Catelyn Stark: And he lived. And I couldn't keep my promise. And everything that's happened since then, all this horror that's come to my family... it's all because I couldn't love a motherless child""

It can't be a coincidence that the phrases, ""The long night"" ""The Darkness"" are used to both describe the winter and Snow's sickness, can it? Obviously there's some hints as to snow's birth parents here. I think this scene may hint towards other events to come. What do you guys think, does this have any merit?",17,18,False,spoiler,,,,,

2: Myrcella (this one's a bit more shaky than the other two) - killed in spite of recent settling of a conflict - Ned was killed by Joffrey in spite of recent settling of a conflict (with everyone anticipating a pardon).

3: Tommen - fell off a window - Jaime pushed Bran off a window.



Also those three deaths are in reversed chronological order to the three betrayals in case that means anything.

Any thoughts on this are welcome!

/e: It was of course not Robb's wedding, corrected that. Thanks /u/tehcowgoesmo0123",149,736,False,spoiler,,,,,

They did it in Ned (and Robert) in season 1. They let the two most important people in Westeros just die. Even the most important character before them simply died without us seeing him.

Let's get started:

With Cersei starting her mad reign after the burning of the septs and that mixed with the guards and the new arrived Ironborn harassing the citizens. The city grows tired of cersei and a priest comes to not only reestablish and new faith after the high sparrow in his words FAILED but also to lead an resistance and Gendry helps lead the resistance as second in command. Soon attacks from the resistance start happening, The new faith militant fight off the ironborn and guards who are harassing citizens, Citizens Poor, Middle class, and even Rich start rioting against the Lannister soldiers and Ironborn, and even the most of the Gold Cloaks turn on the new queen and join the resistance, also there is Graffiti on building and walls.

However Gendry leaves the Resistance in the hands of the Priest after he is found by Davos and Tyrion to take him to Dragonstone. When he gets there he is told he will marry Daenerys to end the two bloodlines war or he will be hanged as a traitor to the crown once Dany is queen. That same night Gendry takes a boat and leaves to Winterfell there he meets back up with Arya where they have a reunion and either a spark will happen between the two and Gendrya happens or they just remain friends.",6,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Some of the people who I personally think will reveal Jon's parentage to Jon/Westeros will be:

- Bran
- Littlefinger (his Rhaegar/Lyanna story to Sansa seemed like he knew something)
- Howland Reed (Meera's father)
- Jon (finds something in Winterfell Crypts alluding to his parentage)

Wildcards:

- Meera Reed? (pending something happens to Bran or we never meet Howland)
- Sam? (maybe theres something @ The Citadel such as a marriage license between R+L tucked away somewhere)
- Melisandre? (sees something in the fire, or has a ""holy shit!"" moment)

I just thought about who will kill Cersei's Monster/The Mountain.

Since The Hound is back together with The Brotherhood and Thoros of Myr, what do you think about Sandor coming over his fear of fire and Thoros manages to light his Blade on fire.

Then there will be an epic fight between the brothers in the capital after no one, not Arya haha, was able to kill the Monster Mountain.

2. Stannis is victor-becomes-loser as his army is subsequently ridden down by the armored knights of Ramsay Bolton (and co.) on horseback who came north.

3. Ramsay Bolton is victor-becomes-loser as his army is subsequently ridden down by the armored knights of The Vale on horseback who came north.

Apparently Nicolai Coster-Waldau, in a recent interview, stated that the internet had already accurately predicted how Game of Thrones will end. Whether he meant the show, specifically, or the story itself, I don't know.

One of the websites talking about this interview, ""gamesradar.com"" presented five fan theories that had been talked about on the internet.

Two of them in the list were from Reddit, with links to them as well.

When I clicked on the link to one theory whose outline sounded very similar to how I thought the story would end, it **turned out to be an old post of mine**!

Just to be clear, Coster-Waldau didn't cite any particular theory on the internet at all, and my theory was merely selected, probably at random, by this site.

Here are the links to both the article and my old post that I'd made on the subreddit r/gottheories.

The website itself: https://www.google.com/amp/www.gamesradar.com/amp/the-game-of-thrones-ending-is-already-online-according-to-jaime-lannister-here-are-five-possibilities/

^ If you scroll down to the bold lettering ""The Child that Saves the World"", and click on the first few words of the paragraph, you get sent to my old post!

My old post: https://www.reddit.com/r/gottheories/comments/66en7l/how_it_all_ends_and_boy_is_it_sad/


I know it's nothing super special, and I am NOT bragging with this. I'm just kinda shocked and sorta honoured to have mine being mentioned within the same article of a Jaime Interview. This, especially considering, that literally *hundreds*, maybe thousands of theories get espoused in the internet.

This, in no way, means my theory is somewhere on the mark in accuracy by any means. Though it is pretty cool to be mentioned. :]",8,9,False,spoiler,,,,,

And to an extent, they're right. After all, there are dragons, warlocks and undead walkers. But although these entities have key impact on the overarching plot (the final battle or whatever, and just in general), Game of Thrones seems almost *restricted* by the ""fantasy"" branding.

It seems hard to call a story fantasy where so much is realistic and within the realm of our world, albeit more medieval. To me, ""fantasy"" brings to mind many books filled with locations and characters with difficultly-pronounced names, entities and beings whose physical makeups and backgrounds are barely explained and plots which take on a more heroic, adventurous theme. 

And Game of Thrones is so much more than that. We see the political machinations of a kingdom full of families fighting for a throne. We explore the way the pursuit for power affects the characters. We experience the unfolding of a deep storyline with a rich history. 

So, it seems that at times Game of Thrones fits the fantastical description, but what other words would you use to describe the best show on TV?",13,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Another common theory I've heard is Bran is able to hone his abilities as the three eyed raven to allow him to physically be in the past, seen by all.  This leads to him being Bran the Builder, created the wall to slow the white walkers.  

Here's where I started thinking, what about the other Brandon Starks? In the show we know three(Bran the Builder, our Bran, &amp; Ned's older brother Brandon Stark). If we make the assumption that Bran is able to hone his abilities to physically exist in the past making him also Bran the Builder, I was thinking he may also be Brandon Stark.  I'm not sure exactly what he would be doing. But I think maybe trying to get back to the Mad King in a physical form as a real person so he would not drive him any crazier, and actually push him to prepare for the white walkers like he originally planned to do with his whispers.  Maybe when he was going to see the Mad King with his father Rickard, he had another motive along with protesting Lyanna's kidnapping.  However, he never got to push that motive forward because the Mad King was too far gone &amp; killed him.  I know it's wild and real out there and I don't even think I believe it, but maybe this will be how Bran dies.  He gets carried away with his abilities as the Three-Eyed raven, and ends up dying as an effort to fix his previous mishap with the Mad King to help prevent the white walker invasion.  To add onto this, I did some digging around the GoT wikias to see how Bran the Builder died, but nothing was said of it, so it is plausible he came out unscathed from that individual situation.

I haven't seen any posts about this, so apologies if I seemed to have copied someone.

I thought of 6 meetings between members of Jons council and members of Daenerys council that might strength or weaken their potential bond.

here goes...

Weaken:

- Tyrion was responsible for the defense of kings landing when Stannis launched an attack at blackwater bay and so is responsible for the death of ser Davos Seaworths son, Matthos Seaworth.

- Theon betrayed Robb Stark and I don't think Jon will easily forget that even if Sansa tells Jon about how he saved her.

- Varys and Littlefinger might not want to work together because they are a threat to each other.


Strengthen:

- The elephant in the room is that they are both Targaryen, it's likely that Jon will know he is a Targaryen before their meeting, (probably told so by bran) and the fact that they are family will likely bring them together.

- Tyrion made a good impression on Jon in season one when he was the only person to tell Jon what the nights watch really is and for this, i think he respects him and might be more welcoming of Tyrion. Also Despite the conditions between Sansa and Tyrion, I presume the way he treated her doesn't make her think of him as a monster, (I haven't got that far in the books yet, so it's just my opinion). Obviously, they are 'married' but it was never consummated so they will probably just forget about it.

- Sansa and Theon are meeting again after so recently parting and judging by her disappointed of him leaving I assume she has forgiven him.

- Varys and Littlefinger make an amazing team for taking over Westeros so it's likely they will see the mutual benefits and work together.

I heard it said that most people kinda liked Stannis pre-his killing of Shireen.  I was confused as I found him the most unlikeable git from the get-go.  As irregal (unregal? non-regal?) as Joffrey is, I always found him sitting on the throne almost as unpleasant.

I don't understand then why most people, pre-killing Shireen, liked him.

-has dabbled in intellectual arts at the Citadel
-writes poetry
-shows a relatively level-headed state of mind, like when he remarks to Tyson and Cersei that in some parts of the world, it's abhorrent to kill children.
^ also sympathizes with Cersei About her missing her daughter in Dorne, having children of his own.

He's such a dynamically complex character.

His story, although vague in greater spectrum of ASOIAF, he had many events happen....

- A teenage Oberyn defeats a young Yronwood lord in single combat, over a woman, killing him with poison (earning his nickname)? 

- Time spent at the citadel studying poisons.

- Time spent in Essos fighting with the Second Sons...

- Time spent traveling Westeros with his sister including staying at Casterly Rock.

- I imagine time also spent in Essos with some high interest in the Fighting Pits of Southern Essos and general arena interest (and mayhap participation)?
^^^ He implied to Tyrion prior to the trial by combat that he may have spent time in ""the fighting pits"" when he mocked him over his expertise.
^^^ Also his sheer fearlessness when fighting against The Mountain. 
""He's the biggest man I've ever seen."" - Ellaria
""Size does not matter when you are flat on your back.""

He shows seemingly no fear against I would imagine any opponent.


- His general travels throughout Essos.
^^^ He implied to Varys that the world was a big and beautiful place that should be explored.

- Where was he during Roberts Rebellion? Did he lead engagements against the Stormlands on behalf of the Targaryens?

- The wedding in Kings Landing of his sister and Rhaegar.

- His emotional reaction when he finds out about Elia's death.

It's hard to deny he was a fan favorite for many reasons. I feel his story is so much more elaborate. He only had 29 minutes of screen time in season 4 but his scenes were so intriguing and he had a carefree, impressive, unpredictable demeanor which crossed between hot-headedness and calculated analysis' of any given situation.

If you take into account he was also into his 40s by the role of his death, this leaves decades of adventure he has probably partaken in.

I am halfway through AGOT (first book) and have picked up on some pretty awesome details relating to Bran and Jon.

1. In BRAN III, during his unconscious/recovery period, he seems to have an incredibly important dream featuring a crow (with three eyes). He spends the chapter trying to fly, being encouraged by the crow who tells him ""there are different kinds of wings"" and ""now you know why you must live."" He also appears to see the entire Realm from North of the Wall to the Narrow Sea, which I thought could relate to the visions he experiences, both past and present. Do you think the flying reference could possibly foreshadow Bran being one of the dragon riders OR how Bran will eventually learn to ""fly""?

2. In the scene (1x02) where Jon says goodbye to Bran, the same music plays when Bran watches Lyanna give birth to Jon (6x10). This was so moving, as it presents the perfect parallel between two brothers, one where Bran is on the final cusp of life and the latter where he learns the origins/heritage of his birth, his first breath of life.

So we known that Aegon came to Westeros with his sister wives Rhaeneys and Visenya. well not only does Jon's name end with ON like Aegon but also Jon was born believing the stark sister were his sisters, They both see him as a stark/Brother (Arya has a storng connection with him and in season 6 Sansa sees Jon more as family now then anything), They both have a A at the end of there names like Visenya. I am not saying Jon will take Arya and Sansa as both his wives (like Aegon did). Hell i do not support the Jon/Arya shippings and doubt this is what will actually happen.

I have a theory it may not happen and likely not for the reasons you are thinking.

So I think Arya will see Jon and Sansa again but I doubt Arya will directly ever contact them.
I suspect she will find a purpose among House Stark but as something else perhaps a fake faceless assassin or perhaps bodyguard.

Arya never cared for her role and the responsibilities that came with it.
If Arya showed herself odds are Jon or Sansa would force her to marry, something she never wanted.
There are far too many drawbacks for Arya showing herself.
Arya may be close to Jon but she is his opposite.
Arya cares nothing for duty, she's a free spirit.

- Tyrion/Daenerys (An unstoppable power couple that will have a lot of badass moments ahead of them. Their mutual respect for one another, and friendship is what makes their relationship amazing. Daenerys making Tyrion her Hand of the Queen was one of the most heartwarming scenes in the series. Tyrion is finally given the recognition he deserves, and we're reminded that despite Daenerys' cold, blood-thirsty and power hungry nature, she does has a good heart and values and cares about her people).

- Arya/The Hound (They had a lot of funny moments together, especially when Arya threatens him and The Hound has a clever one liner to say in response).

- Brienne/Pod (Lots of hilarious moments where Pod screws up, Brienne criticizes him for it and he doesn't argue or defend himself).

- Tyrion/Varys (Their friendship has come a long way, Tyrion went from not trust him to being 'the only person in the world I trust, except my brother'. Plus aside from Bronn, Pod and Daenerys, he is one of the few people who acknowledges that Tyrion has one of the greatest minds in Westeros and doesn't mock him for being a dwarf).

- Jon/Tormond (I love seeing these two fighting together side by side, significantly in 'Hardhome' and 'Battle of the Bastards'. I remember wanting Tormund to die around Season 4 and now I'm a big fan of the character and don't want to see him go).

A huge amount of Ned's dialogue is filled of foreshadowing - and allude to events that happen later in the story.

In particular a recent thread here mentions how he was very specific with the words he used when talking with Sansa and Arya about their futures and who they would marry.

In addition, (besides being half Targaryen) Ned may be aware of the significance of Jon and the coming battle with the White Walkers. This is why he perseveres with lies about Jon being his bastard - which damages his honor, reputation and relationship with Catelyn.

This may also explain why he encouraged Jon to become a part of the Night's Watch, despite it probably being the last thing you would encourage a young man to do - this was one part of the story that I felt difficult to accept, why would Ned encourage his son to go there, knowing the hell that the Night's Watch is.

Did he knowingly introduce Arya to Syrio Forel (possiblly Jhaqen?) 

There are a number of examples I could give, and even Ned's demeanour in the story I feel feeds into this theory. For example - when word reaches him about Robert's arrival to Winterfell, Ned almost seems apprehensive - maybe he knows this is where the events start into motion. 

Supporting this: Howland Reed may have greenseer abilities like his son Jojen. We are yet to really see Howland, but who's to say he doesn't have this ability and hasn't already filled Ned im about some of the events? 

I'm not saying Ned knew about everything - as there are plenty of things he doesn't immediately know about (eg. Rob's children being illegitimate bastards) - but he may know enough.

Maybe when Howland does show up some of this will be confirmed. Alternatively, Bran may find out too (Ned did turn around when Bran called out to him on the Tower of Joy flashback - so did Ned even have some greenseer abilities too?) 

Bonus Theory: even in death, Ned is still looking over his children. Contolling the direwolfs to protect them when he can, and influencing events where possible.

If they follow a similar pattern as last season, next in line we could see

- another teaser (next week?)
- the official season 7 poster
- maybe some ""Inside GoT"" / ""Behind the scenes"" clip
- the first trailer (around May 31st / June 1st?)

Now the properties behind these feats of resurrection aren't fully known, but it's implied that a complete resurrection requires the body to be mostly intact.

This is shown when arya asks about bringing Ned Stark back to life even though he has no head. The books also mention something about just bones not being able to be reanimated, (I think in the passage about the zombie bear on the Fist of the First men.) However, we've seen skeletons and partial limbs move on their own accord, so the rules here are foggy.

My question is, with these facts being considered, is there a possibility that the White Walkers could ressurect the dragon bones beneath the red keep? It seems a stretch to say that a fully functional dragon could be formed from just skulls, but I feel like those bones have some role to play in the endgame, especially because of their resistance to wildfire.

The Old Gods:

The Children of the Forest worship them and the Children definitely have magical powers. I'm not sure if it is said whether or not the Children claim to derive their magic from the Old Gods, though. However, the Northerners don't seem to get much of an answer or help when they pray.

The Lord of Light:

Red priests and priestesses definitely have some sort of magic here. Melisandre and Thoros were both able to resurrect people and Melisandre drank poison without dying. I don't know if it's just magic, but Red priests and priestesses have powers and claim to derive it from their god.

The Many-Faced God:

The Faceless Men who follow the Many-Faced God definitely have magical abilities and can wear other people's faces.

The Faith of the Seven:

So far, there is no magic or supernatural forces associated with it. Right now, it's the least credible of all the religions so far.",25,9,False,spoiler,,,,,

As we know, the show is further ahead than the books are. More or less, Season 6 is directly after a lot of events that take place in A Dance With Dragons. To me, it seems like Season 6 incorporated a *lot* of theories and assumptions people have had about plot lines in the books for quite a while (Jon Snow being a targaryen, Jon Snow being crowned King in the North, the Northern Conspiracy, some Elements of Cersei's plot lines, etc.). A lot of these theories seemed solid, and it wouldn't be far from crazy to expect that GRRM was going to go that route. 

However, with Season 6 largely taking many of these plot lines into consideration, I simply think GRRM got annoyed that he was writing what bits of his story was already released in the show. He either was bored rewriting, in certain aspects, an already released plot (yes, the show and books are obviously *extremely* different, much more so with recent seasons, but the general plot is very similar, even if the show excludes a myriad of characters, plots, and events), or didn't want people reading certain events they had already watched back in 2016. Due to all this, GRRM is probably rewriting vast swathes of the novel, and considerably changing plot lines, to essentially make things new. Obviously character's such as Aegon or Brienne wouldn't need much rewriting, as Aegon isn't even in the show and Brienne's story is almost completely different, but I wouldn't be surprised if he's changing characters such as Jon, Cersei, or possibly even Danny's plots.

So in the last episode, Daenerys is preparing to travel to Westeros. She is informed that the fleet is almost ready.

In the next scene, Olenna Tyrell has come to Dorne and speaks to Ellaria Sand and her daughters, they discuss getting revenge on the Lannisters. Ellaria then introduces Varys, who will help them.

In the final scene we see Daenerys on her fleet, heading to Westeros. Alongside her are Tyrion, Grey Worm, Missandei and Varys. But how did Varys get from Dorne to Merreen so quickly? When Daenerys was just about to leave, how did Varys get there fast enough to join them on their way back to Westeros?

Did he sail out and meet them half way, for reasons... Or does anyone else have an explanation? Sorry again if this has already been asked.",15,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

I follow this subreddit but I haven't personally seen anything about these particular theories. They might be popular and widely accepted already, I don't know. But I'd like to hear about what you think and if anyone is more knowledgeable than me about the show and has read the books (I haven't), then feel free to share how likely these are to happen, or *not* to happen.

1 - I think Jaime will kill Cersei the same way he killed the Mad King and for the same reason - she will go mad and want to burn the city to the ground (she already said she would do that if anyone harmed her children. Now they're *all* dead). Cersei already has already burned people alive - in fact destroying a small part of the city in the process.

2 - I think Bran Stark will warg into one of Daenerys' dragons - the only living dragons we know of are on their way to Westeros, remember. The Three-Eyed Raven has told Bran ""You will never walk again but you will fly"" and that might mean warging into birds at first, but eventually he will warg into a dragon. And while I'm on Bran, (this isn't my theory) but I love the theory that [Bran is Brandon Stark](http://wikiofthrones.com/1763/heres-proof-bran-stark-bran-builder-person/) ""the builder"" who built the Wall.

3 - Speaking of Daenerys - I think she will become more of a villain towards the end. She's already done some pretty extreme things like crucifying slave owners and burning her enemies alive. She seems hellbent on taking the throne which she considers her birthright, no matter the cost. The whole series seems to lead towards a big battle in Westeros, she's on her way there at the end of the last season. The whole series ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" has strongly hinted towards Jon being Ice, and Daenerys fire (either that or White Walkers and Dragons but it's perhaps not as clear cut as that). It seems like Jon and Daenerys perhaps might become king and queen over Westeros but that's too fairy-tale-like for Game of Thrones. I think in the end she will go mad like her father (not *as* mad but definitely going too far) and Jon Snow will be forced to kill her. Jon Snow is one of the only characters who has consistently acted like a true hero and always tried to do good even if it's not the easiest choice. He seems like the real hero of the show, overall. Either that or I think Jorah Mormont (who I think will suddenly appear in Westeros, cured) will be forced to kill her. Which is super tragic of course because he's spent so many years protecting her, but that's GoT in a nutshell. Wouldn't that be a great dramatic scene?

Anyways, that was a bit rambley but I just want to see what the community thinks because I've thought about these ever since the last season ended. I mean, what else is a GoT fan to do while waiting for the next season?",36,38,False,spoiler,,,,,

My wife and I were long distance she was in the US and I in Canada we recently got married and I moved to the states. But to watch it I had no T.V. in Canada, no cable anything and every season that came out I prayed HBO GO would be available but to no avail....

... when I got married and moved to the states we had a big screen t.v. and HBO go was available and of course we subscribed and streamed it in high def on our big screen and it was AMAZING, watching the battle otB in standard def on my laptop from a streaming site would not have been the same.  I always felt bad I wanted to support what was my all time favourite show but they gave me no real way to do it, so I bought merchandise and the books and hoped that would ease my conscience.

So how do you enjoy the show? Was I right for feeling Guilty? Did the way try to validate it by buying the Merch work? Are there other shows you feel you have to do this with? Why can't HBO make it more readily available? OMG HBO take my money!

Humans,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/6a0of2/everything_help_me_develop_a_game_of_thrones/,Truant_Muse,1494275010,"So here's the deal.  I'm trowing a party the night before the Season 7 premier, and I thought it would be really cool if I could develop a Game of Thrones themed [Assassins or Zombies Vs. Humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin_(game)) type game to play during the party.


Ice Zombies Vs. Humans is an obvious option, but I was trying to think if there might be other ways to do it.  I'm thinking since this is a contained event it would need to be the indirect version where ""a player plants an object where his or her target will be eliminated by it or changes his or her target's environment in a specific way."" 




I was thinking maybe taking 4 houses Stark, Targaryen, Lannister, and a 4th (having trouble deciding because ultimately two houses would team up for the first round) and basically having it play out where people from different houses try to eliminate each other until only one house is left. Or one person. I'd like the game to last for a while, so either having designated rounds that go on during the party, or just being long enough that it will last a while. 



I've only just started to really work on this, and I thought people here might be interested in helping me out since once it is developed and rules are outlined anyone could play it anywhere.

The Hound will be mortally wounded by The Mountain while trying to save Arya. Together The Hound and Arya will kill The Mountain. This time Arya will put The Hound out of his misery out of ""mercy"". Ironically she can cross The Hound off her list even tho she didn't want to. The Hounds' last words may be ""Do you remember where the heart is?"". Never heard of this theory, it's my own. If Arya helps kill The Mountain wouldn't it be cool if needle finds it way thru the hole that the faith militant made with his mace. She remembered where the heart was. :) I also think The Hound in this fight (despite his fear) will use a torch to The Mountains' face to allow Arya to take a thrust with needle. Hows that for poetic.

In S1EP9 (Baelor), Jon Finds out who Maester Aemon really is. When Aemon is speaking with Jon, we have this exchange:

&gt;**Aemon:** ""What could l do when the ravens brought the news from the South the ruin of my House, the death of my family? l was helpless blind, frail.
But when l heard they had killed my brother's son (A) and his poor son (B) and the children (C)! Even the little children.""

&gt;**Jon:** Who are you?

&gt;**Aemon:** My father was Maekar, the first of his name. My brother Aegon reigned after him when l had refused the throne.
And he was followed by his son Aerys (D) whom they called the Mad King.

&gt;**Jon:** You're Aemon Targaryen.

So for context, the [Targaryen family tree](https://i0.wp.com/awoiaf.westeros.org/images/c/c6/House_Targaryen_Family_tree.jpg) goes like this: Aegon --&gt; Jahaerys --&gt; Aerys (mad king) --&gt; Rhaegar

(A) - So his ""brother's son"" would mean Jahaerys, right? (which doesn't make sense because he died of illness)

(B) - ""And his [Jahaerys'] poor son"" meaning Aerys (mad king), correct?

(C) - I assume by ""the children"" he isn't following the lineage perfectly and is just overcome with emotion and jumps to them 

HOWEVER

(D) - The way he says this line seems to indicate that it goes Aegon --&gt; Aerys (mad king), and Aerys is the son of Aegon and not Jahaerys... 

So which is correct here? In one line it seems like Jahaerys exists, but in the other he doesn't. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills watching this scene",6,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

Now before you hate on this thinking i am crazy hear me out. First let's start with a certain conversation from the books. In the first book A game of thrones the scene were Tywin makes Tyrion hand of the king is alot longer and it ends with Tyrion joking ""atleast Rhaegar is still dead"" I know it was just a joke tyrion made but it could be forshadowing that Rhaegar Targaryen could still be very much alive.

Also it is fair to mention Rhaegar's armor had rubies on it during the battle of the trident. Also Rhaegar never loved fighting it is possible he could've switch himself out with either a faceless man or one of his many friends (or maybe Arthur Dayne. Maybe Arthur switch himself out at the tower with A faceless man) and Rhaegar fled and whined into hiding. 

Also no i do not think he is Mance Rayder or Gerold Dayne. But i think he is in hiding as a old hermit. Maybe before the series ends he will reveal himself to Jon and the world that he is still alive and he will help in the battle against the white walkers. ",33,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Just the way Bran was supposed to die.

But after I rewatched, I realized It subtly introduces a few things. It introduced what I would call the connection of the stark childrens lifeforces and the direwolfs . One of the direwolves dies and its almost as if its life force is transfered to Bran. It also introduced bran' worging abilities even though that wasnt even really concept In the series yet.

The Night King will then somehow kill Bran as Bran the Builder before the wall gets built

The theory is that in season 7 Arya will become a sort of reincarnation like character of Nymeria from the Lore. She flees with a couple thousand people from the WW and our known world to set up a new settlement West of Westeros.

A piece of the lore from Nymeria:

The Rhoynar once lived in city-states along the Rhoyne River. About a thousand years ago (perhaps 700 years before the Targaryen Conquest), the Rhoynar were on the verge of being conquered by the expanding power of the Valyrian Freehold and its dragons. Defeated at the end of the Rhoynish Wars, Nymeria rallied the survivors and fled Essos altogether, sailing in a refugee fleet said to include ten thousand ships. After much wandering she eventually led her people to Dorne, at the southeastern tip of Westeros. After landing, Nymeria had all of the Rhoynar's 10,000 ships burned, so that none would have second thoughts about staying. At the time, Dorne was divided into many petty kingdoms and had never been unified. Impressed by Nymeria, local king Mors Martell married her and united her forces with his own. Together, they conquered and unified all of Dorne

It would explain the name of her direwolf like the other direwolves explaned about their character. E.g Ghost- John, Lady - Sanza, Summer - Bran(dies when winter starts)...

Also to add to the theory of Arya(Nymeria) discovering new land to possibly inhabit, she once said Essos is East. Westeros is West, but whats west of Westeros?. Could be a possible ending for the show and a start off one of the 4 spinoffs?

These past 5 seasons she was nothing but a damsel in distress that needs to be rescued. I was never really that invested in her storylines in the series and most of my thoughts were always ""Oh no, what horrible thing will happen to Sansa this time"". At the start of season 6, after her reunion with Jon, I was under the impression that her arc this season will be about her finally being safe with someone she knows won't hurt her. I was pleasantly surprised with the quick turn of events with her finally growing a backbone this season. Her being the catalyst to convince Jon to take back Winterfell, Feeding Ramsay to the wolves and walking away like a badass, etc.

Her relationship with Littlefinger is still dodgy, but I think the scene where she pushes him away concludes it for me that she no longer is interested in playing part of Littlefinger's schemes. After everything she's been through, I think she has no interest with the iron throne anymore and would rather stay home at Winterfell with Jon, the only family she has at the moment. 

Coming into season 7, I hope they explore this new side of Sansa even more, possibly with her ruling as Lady of Winterfell since I reckon Jon would be away from Winterfell most of the season as he's away to fight White Walkers.


So yeah, I just want to say that I was extremely pleased with what they did with Sansa, and she is now my favorite character in the show and am looking forward to see more of her on the next season.",46,41,False,spoiler,,,,,

Indeed, you can even buy modern Damascus steel"" replicas of the Valyrian steel weapons in the show. (Technically these are actually pattern welded or billet welded steel.) The similarities between Valyrian steel and Damascus steel usually given are:

* Both are harder and and can be honed sharper than other steels available in a pre-industrial society
* Both have a ""unusual dusky color, [and a] distinctive rippled pattern.""
* The forging technique used to create both of them has been lost.

-

There are however some key differences:

* Valyrian steel is said to be much lighter than other steel. I was not able to find any references to Damascus steel being especially light.
* In [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUcEwfBnRGI) GRR says Valyrian steel ""keeps its edge forever."" Obviously no real-life metal, Damascus steel included, has this property, as all blades eventually dull with use.
* Valyrian steel never rusts. Damascus *can* rust, if not properly cared for.
* As seen in Season 4 /  A Storm of Swords, Valyrian steel can be melted down and reforged (even by those who have no idea how it was made). Damascus steel cannot. ""The thing that makes Damascus steel unique is that it's not a homogenous steel. It is composed of layers of two or more different steels that are fused together, but where each layer retains its individual properties. Japanese swords are made from a similar process. If that steel were actually melted it would lose that layered quality and so would lose something that couldn't be gotten back."" - [*Can You Simply Reforge a Metal Like Valyrian Steel?*](http://www.popularmechanics.com/culture/tv/a12927/can-one-simply-reforge-valyrian-steel-16675840/)

-

This last one I find the most interesting, because I think it shows that while Damascus steel is a *forging technique*, Valyrian Steel is a *unique material*. Now let's consider metallic aluminium. It's far too malleable to be useful as a practical sword (though it is used to make practice swords and props for movies and TV-shows), but I think it does share some interesting similarities with Valyrian steel.

-

Aluminum is much less dense than traditional steel blades. Historical greatswords, like house Starks Ice  [weighed around 5-8 pounds](http://www.thearma.org/essays/2HGS.html). A similar sword made of aluminum [weighs only 2 pounds and 14 ounces](https://myarmoury.com/review_sc_wast.html). 

-

Aluminum is also very resistant to rust. Actually, in a way, it rusts almost instantly. On contact with air, a thin layer (4 nanometers thick) of aluminum oxide forms. However,  this layer protects the metal from further oxidation. 

-

Now lets look at how aluminium is made. Aluminium is actually the most abundant *metal* in the earth's crust, and is the third most abundant *element*, after oxygen and silicon. So why didn't we start warping our leftovers in aluminum foil until the 1910s? Well, while aluminium-containing minerals are very common in the earth's crust, *pure* metallic aluminium is not. Because of its strong affinity for oxygen, aluminium is almost never found in the elemental state; instead it is found in oxides or silicates. How ore is made into aluminum is [a complicated, multi-step process](http://www.madehow.com/Volume-5/Aluminum.html) that I won't bother to describe in detail here, but the important thing to know is that overcoming the strong bonds between aluminium and oxygen requires things like high temperature pressure cookers, precipitation tanks, and a *whole lot of electricity.* [It's estimated](http://wordpress.mrreid.org/2011/07/15/electricity-consumption-in-the-production-of-aluminium/) that in 2010, 3% of the worlds entire electrical supply went to extraction of aluminium. That same year, Australia, one of the worlds largest producers of aluminium, gave about 12% of its electrical supply to the extraction of aluminium. To produce a single aluminium greatsword roughly the size of house Stark's Ice, you would need 9.56 kilowatt hours of electricity, or 1.2 times the battery capacity of a 2012 Chevrolet Volt. Not that hard for us to produce today, but a tall order for a pre-industrial society like Westeros.  Speaking of which, what do you think this production process would *sound like* to someone from a pre-industrial society, who had never even heard of electricity? What was that Clarke said about magic and technology?

-

Now, once all that energy has been put into separating oxygen from aluminum, the resulting metallic aluminum is stable and will never rust (see earlier comment about its oxide layer). Aluminium can be melted down and recast relatively easily, and it has a melting point of only 1,221 F, compared to iron's 2,800F. So, melting down Ice into two small swords would be pretty easy if it was made of aluminum, even if you had no idea how the aluminum had been made. This may actually be a point *against* my comparison since, in the books anyway, reforging Valyrian steel is supposed to be so difficult that only a few smiths in the world can do it. In the show, however, it seems like all you need to do is melt it down and pour it into a mold, just as you would when [casting an aluminium sword](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmUki5yg50o).   Indeed, [they probably used molten aluminium on set for the scene showing the forging of Oathkeeper and Widows Wail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8E6TzT0eCYs&amp;t=2m56s).

So, like Valyrian Steel, aluminum:

* is less dense than steel
* doesn't rust
* is made using what is basically sorcery
* and can be melted down and recast, without any understanding of the techniques needed to produce it.",18,13,False,spoiler,,,,,

I wasn't sure on which spoiler tag to use specifically because I don't want any spoilers past where the tv show is, but I'm wondering if these events are elaborated on in the books. 

First, and I'm sure it's been asked to death at this point, what exactly happened to Wylis? Though you can kind of see how something like that might ruin his brain it's not too clear what's happening in the scene. Who was controlling Hodor at that moment? Was it both Bran and Wylis? Or just Wylis? 

Second, after Jon gets back from Hardhome, they dock north of the wall, and walk back to it. Why did they do this? Why not just dock south of the wall and not have to worry about the really tense situation of crossing through Castle Black? And given that that was a possibility, was the whole stand-off in front of the gate just a question if Jon was going to be disobeyed? They seemed overly worried if it that was the case, like they might be trapped there. 

Third, and this is probably going to stray into spoiler territory past where the show is at (and I'd rather not know if that's the case), but how is it possible that Arya used a face at the end? While Jaqen did say that she had finally become no one, it seemed as though she refused this notion. I really didn't understand the end of this plot arc at all, how would killing the other girl be the end of her training when it had nothing to do with the letting go of her identity? She seemed to fail to do so the entire time, and I would've thought that using the faces at this point would still have caused the same poison/blindness issue it did before.",6,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Martin: ""Well, the readers are certainly free to wonder about the validity of these religions, the truth of these religions, and the teachings of these religions. I'm a little leery of the word ""true""  whether any of these religions are more true than others. I mean, look at the analogue of our real world. We have many religions too. Are some of them more true than others? I don't think any gods are likely to be showing up in Westeros, any more than they already do. We're not going to have one appearing, deus ex machina, to affect the outcomes of things, no matter how hard anyone prays. So the relation between the religions and the various magics that some people have here is something that the reader can try to puzzle out.""

But that statement seems like total malarkey to me.  So I thought I'd see if anyone else had other opinions.
The thing that I become hung up on is that there is objective proof for the Lord of Light.  So we have the lord of light, the 7, the pantheistic omnipresent old gods, the drowned god, the faceless god, and the tribal gods in Essos.  The 7 seem sort of like the catholic church, with a hierarchical structure and adherence to a religious text (with the swallows kinda mirroring the protestant revolution).  Similarities to religions in the real world are there, with sins and heaven and hell, but there's no proof.  As far as I can tell we haven't had any objective proof for the 7.  The tribal gods aren't really shown very well, so I'm going to ignore them for now.  The drowned god seems to have some objective evidence, with drowned people coming back to life.  So there's some proof there.  The old gods are a tricky one.  Their worship seems so poorly defined that it is possible to attribute a lot of supernatural events to their power.  That leaves the lord of light.  The miraculous ability to bring people back to life with just a prayer to R'hllor is pretty damn hard to deny.  If there was some kind of physical ritual necessary, some kind of device or potion then maybe we would have some wiggle room.  But the way it's presented, it seems like all that is involved is the prayer to R'hllor and then BAM! divine intervention.

To me that is very, very disturbing, due to the horrible nature of the Lord of Light religion.  Any god that wants innocent people burned alive as offerings is not good in my opinion.  If we buy into the rest of the cosmology presented for the Lord of Light, we have R'hllor and everything else is Other (including the white walkers).  That means that Bran and the Three-Eyed Raven are of the Other, as they don't have any clear linkage to R'hllor.  Which means that they are on the same side as the white walkers?  That doesn't make any sense, as they are obviously opposed.

So then, if the cosmology of R'hllor is not correct, then why would the Lord of Light bring back the dead for Melisandre, which essentially implies that he agrees with her preaching.

Maybe I've been thinking about this wrong.  Maybe R'hllor is just a one-trick pony with the resurrections (asides from the shadow birthing and blood magic).  Maybe it isn't divine judgement bringing back the dead.

S6 is still fresh in my mind, of course, and when Tyrion and Theon exchange insults at Winterfell I realized Tyrion helped to create the guy he makes fun of later in Meereen. In S6 Tyrion condemns Theon for taking over Winterfell but the things he was saying to Theon in S1 helped to egg him on. If anything, Tyrion was one of the main proponents of shattering Theons confidence in the Starks and his place in their family (his father and sister are the other perpetrators).  I know the characters are written a certain way but it makes me wonder if Tyrion would ever look back on that moment and feel bad about it. 

&amp;nbsp;

I noticed that in the beginning, Theon is actually pretty confident in the fact that he is Robbs brother and was raised as part of the familyeven to go so far as making fun of the bastard son. Then he has the confrontations with Tyrion and the Greyjoys in the Iron Islands, and from there decides to betray Robb and take Winterfell for the Iron Born. Of course I dont blame Tyrion or Theons family for the final decision, thats all on him and him alone. But I do find it sad that Theon's story may have changed drastically had he not had these conversations. Or maybe if he hadnt been left behind, the seeds of doubt planted by everyone else would have been squashed by Robb. I just keep seeing the smile he has as a Stark vanishing when these people feel the need to keep reminding him hes a prisoner, even if he is content to feel like part of the family.

From the books we know that we need 3 dragon heads for the targeryan prophecy to come true. Prince Rhaegar thought that his 2+1 children will be those. Obviously we know what happened to 2 of them so this cannot be true.


If we start thinking who the 3 heads might be, there are 2 obvious ones - Jon and Danny. I don't think anyone could dispute this. So we are left to wonder who is the 3rd head? I've read quite a few theories mainly involving Tyrion as being the 3rd head since he is also the 3rd child like the 2 other candidates but I don't believe this to be true.


For me this prophecy requires the person to have a strong connection to magic and old valyrian blood. The power to control dragons is magic directly opposite to the one wielded by the Night's King. So if we assume the person needs to have targeryan blood and thus old valyrian blood, the number of people possessing it drastically decreases.


Both Danny and Jon have targeryan blood, we know this for sure. Who else in the entire Westeros also has this kind of blood? The short answer to this is Gendry through his father's family.


When House Baratheon became lords of the Storm Lands their leader took a Targeryan wife. This later helped Robert Baratheon to usurp the throne since he still had some family connection to the previous rulers - the Targeryans.

I personally think that this is the reason Thoros of Myr was sent to Robert to try and convert him to the Lord of Light. Later on I think this is why Melissandra thought that Stannis was the Prince that was promised. To her knowledge at the time, after the death of Robert and knowing how weak Renly is, there was no other candidate left. She had no idea Jon was son of Rheager, nor that Danny and Viseris were alive.


Fast forward to the present. All the Baratheons that we know are dead. From the 3 Baratheon brothers only Robert had bastards, since Stannis was kinda honorable(until Melissadra changed him) and Renly wasn't into women. From all of Roberts' bastards only Gendry survived the slaughter at King's landing ordered by Cersei.


As some kind of a proof about the power of Targeryan blood. All people that were ""leeched"" on Gendry by Melissandra died pretty soon. Also when Melissandra says she needs king's blood she never mentions Lannisters, Starks or others as a source. And I do not believe that she means king's blood(baratheon blood) simply because she was loyal to Stannis. For me she truly needs old valyrian blood to perform powerful spells.


I doubt that the show will explore this possibility but perhaps in the books Gendry could be the third dragon head. He doesn't look like much but with a bit of sharpening by Danny, he could mount up to be a massive character.


What do you guys think about Gendry besides that he's still rowing in that bloody boat? :D",16,16,False,spoiler,,,,,

The first is The Horn of Winter, also known as the Horn of Joramun.   Free folk believe that blowing the horn can bring down the Wall.  It was thought burned by Melisandre, but Tormund had this to say:

""Did she? She burned that fine big horn, aye. A bloody sin, I call it. A thousand years old, that was. We found it in a giant's grave, and no man o' us had ever seen a horn so big. That must have been why Mance got the notion to tell you it were Joramun's. He wanted you crows to think he had it in his power to blow your bloody Wall down about your knees. But we never found the true horn, not for all our digging. If we had, every kneeler in your Seven Kingdoms would have chunks o' ice to cool his wine all summer.""

The second horn is Dragonbinder, also called the hellhorn.  Euron stated this at the Kingsmoot:  

""That horn you heard I found amongst the smoking ruins that were Valyria, where no man has dared to walk but me. You heard its call, and felt its power. It is a dragon horn, bound with bands of red gold and Valyrian steel graven with enchantments. The dragonlords of old sounded such horns, before the Doom devoured them. With this horn, ironmen, I can bind dragons to my will.""

**Do you think either will make a showing in the show?**  I personally expect to see both, although the fact neither was mentioned on the show makes one wonder.  An angry Euron could clearly use Dragonbinder to cause unexpected problems for Dany.  I wouldn't be shocked if all two or even all three dragons died trying to take Kings Landing.  Otherwise they may be too powerful against the  White Walkers and their army and thus reduce tension.

There are sixteen unmanned castles along the wall, and it seems like it should be a subject ripe for lore, but I can find very little information about them. 

Greyguard, for example, shows up a few times in the story. It was where Jon and his wildling company climbed over the wall in Season 3. It was where Jon sent Janos Slynt on a mission to restore the castle to fighting shape, before he was executed for insubordination. But we never even get the slightest glimpse of the castle itself in the show, as far as I can remember, and even in the books, the only info I can gather is that it has a large stone staircase built into the wall, a network of tunnels nearby, and is apparently in rough shape after not seeing full time staffing in two hundred years. Nothing about its glory days, it's layout or appearance, it's strategic significance, etc.

There's apparently even an ongoing MineCraft project to model all the other castles, given whatever info can be found on them. Some of them seem to have evocative names and histories, like Long Barrow or Oakenshield (hobbit reference?), or seem to have interesting histories, like Deep Lake which was built on behalf of the Targaryens. Would we see a Targaryen/dragon theme to the architecture? 

I'm sure others have wondered about this. It seems like an important missing piece of the Night's Watch history.

From what we gathered about melisandre and her necklace (or as she called it a ""glamour"") it is used to ""weave light and shadow to deceive the eyes"". Erm...the eyes, yes. But anyone who touches her (and she as been touched quite a lot i might add) would quickly realize that the skin he feels is definitely not the skin he sees. 
It was brought up that in her bubblebath scene she sprinkles something into the water which appears to relieve her but if that had an effect on her body she wouldnt appear old without the glamour. 
So how does her illusion which as stated above ""weaves light and shadow"" extend to her physical form to create matter that can be touched?(Or humped which seems to be the main purpose of that little trick...)

On to the faceless men. So they take the faces and with that take on the appearance of somebody else. But does the body completely change with that? Like if you take on the appearance of somebody with some kind of medical condition, do you feel the pain while you are in this form? Is changing your gender in a matter of seconds not super confusing for your psyche, since hormones and shit are entirely different? 
Jesus i cant wrap my hand around how messed up it would be to be a young male and then shapeshift into an old woman. This has to take its toll on you at some point.

If anybody has some insight or good guesses as to how these things actually are meant to work, feel free to blow my mind because this discussion has left all of us clueless.",24,10,False,spoiler,,,,,

No one knows the true origins of the Valyrians. Some say they were descended from farmers that lived along the volcanic mountain ranges of Essos. Some say they were descended directly or bred with dragons, hence the Targaryen words ""blood of the dragon"". There might be some evidence to claim that Targaryens or indeed Valyrians can be actually dragons in human flesh. 
1. Alys Harroway: 2nd wife of King Maegor the cruel gave birth to a deformed child with scales.
2. Elinor Costayne: Wife of King Maegor, gave birth to an eyeless baby with small wings.
3. Jeyne Westerling: Wife of King Maegor, also gave birth to a ""monster-like"" baby.
4. Rhaenyra Targaryen: gave birth to a girl with scaled tail and hole in her chest.
5. Lady Joanna Lannister ( if you support the Tyrion/Targ theory) : supposedly gave birth  to a boy with a large head tiny arms and legs,  red eye, tail between legs. Forgetting the red eye, we can assume there was some sort of ""tail"" there and it was chopped off when he was a baby.
6. Daenerys Stormborm: gave birth to a ""monster"" of a baby with scaled skin, blind, had small wings, and had innards full of graveworms.                                                       Maybe this is what made ppl like Aerion Targaryen madly drink wildfire believe it would transform him into one. Or why dragons seem to only obey those with good amount of Valyrian blood. Not to mention their tolerance towards heat (fire made flesh *wink wink*)

Thank you all!

This something I read on TheRichest:

1. The Dorne Storyline
Everyone who read the books, unanimously agrees, that the show has completely ruined the entire Dorne storyline; and as bad as the story unfolded last season, it was made even worse in the very first episode of season six. For starters, Myrcella is not supposed to have died, she was never even supposed to be in any danger as no one outwardly wanted revenge on her for Oberyn being killed by The Mountain. Jaime and Bronn never went to Dorne, the Sand Snakes mother is not supposed to be so obsessed with vengeance, there was supposed to be a Dornish princess, and another prince who have their own stories which are actually interesting, and Doran Martell was not supposed to be a useless ruler. Season six saw even more divergence from the books as the Sand Snakes and their mother murder both Doran and his son Trystane for being weak. In the books Doran may still be confined to a chair due to illness, but he is far from weak as he is secretly planning to destroy the Lannisters and return the Targaryans to power; a plan that everyone in his family becomes aware of. Trystane gets murdered by his Sand Snake cousins who were actually supposed to be in charge of protecting him, and when Doran is killed, it is made to appear as though every single house in Dorne is okay with the fact that their Lord was just murdered and that they are simply supposed to loyally follow his murderers.

2. House Umbers Betrayal
For those who read the books, the betrayal of House Umber this season, is not only a complete divergence from the books, but it is also unnecessary. Rickon Stark and the wildling Osha are not even supposed to seek refuge with the Umbers, they are supposed to be on the island of Skagos off the Northern mainland. The Lord who delivers the pair to Ramsey in the show, is known as Jon Umber (or the Smalljon), which makes little sense as he was proudly loyal to house Stark until his death at the Red Wedding; he also states that his father, the Greatjon (he was the guy who got his fingers bitten off by Robbs wolf in season 1) was dead, but in the books he is still very much alive as a prisoner of the Freys. What really makes this betrayal so incomprehensible, is the fact that House Umber down right hates the Boltons for what they did at the Red Wedding, and in the books, a portion of their strength is even marching with Stannis to remove them from power in the North.

3. No Victarion Greyjoy
Victarion is one of Balon Greyjoys brothers and Theons uncle, and he is quite possibly the most popular and most liked of all the Greyjoys. He is the supreme commander of the Iron Islands Iron fleet (which consists of over 90 ships), and is considered to be one of the greatest and most fearsome naval strategists and commanders in all of Westeros. As of now, the show has completely removed Victarion from the story, which is strange considering he is supposed to be present at the kingsmoot, where he does attempt to become the new lord of the Iron Islands. In the books, he loses to his other brother Euron (he was the one who threw Balon off the bridge), and is sent by him to sail to Meereen to find Daenerys and bring her back to Westeros so that Euron can make her his bride. Victarion though, decides to betray his brother mid-voyage, and vows to take Daenerys for himself, and sails into Meereens besieged bay with his fleet to help liberate her city.

4. Ramsay Killing His Family
Ramsay is a terrible human being in both the show and the books, and even though this season we have witnessed him cold-bloodedly murder his step-mother and newborn step-brother in a truly despicable way using his hunting dogs, he is still actually far more vile in the books. In the show, Ramsay murders his father right after learning that he has just had a new legitimately born son, which would make sense if it were not for the fact that in the books, he is currently preparing to battle Stannis and his oncoming army at Winterfell with the help of his father. In the books, Roose does allude that Ramsay would likely kill his step-mother and any child she gives birth to, but as such a birth has not happened yet, he has killed neither.

5. Varys In Meereen
The interplay between Varys and Tyrion is some of the best in the entire series, but as good as the two are together, they are never both at Meereen, and Varys is more concerned with helping another Targaryan besides Daenerys from claiming the Iron Throne. It is true that Varys helps Tyrion to escape Kings Landing after he kills Tywin, but that is basically the last time they see each other, as Varys remains in Westeros in hiding, in the books. The show has Varys trying to work things out for Daenerys in order to speed up her return voyage to Westeros, but in the books, he has been planning for years to have Aegon Targaryan (as mentioned earlier) become king. In the show, Kevan Lannister and Grand Maester Pycelle try to council King Tommen in order to restore peace to the realm, in the books they do the same thing, except Varys puts an end to their influence by murdering them both. He does this in order to allow Cersei to continue antagonizing her perceived enemies (the Tyrells), so that she can plunge the realm into even more chaos so that it would be easier for Aegon to take over.

Well, I got to thinking, what if it's Bran?

Maybe the fact he is the very first POV character introduced into the books &amp; the fact his fall set in motion the series' unfolding events, means that he is even more important to the end game than we think.

We know that in the show, and eventually in the last two books, he has valuable information on the WW and of Jon's lineage.

What if he, in combination with Samwell Tarly's findings in Oldtown, provides the means necessary in the Battle for the Dawn?

And what if the collection of individuals - Jon, Daenerys, and Tyrion (because I don't believe the flaming sword is a literal sword) is **Bran's Lightbringer**?

This is basically the Three Heads of the Dragon + 1 theory. The ""+1"" being Bran as AA.

**PERSONALLY**, I don't think AA is one individual, but if it is, I think the only two that would make the most sense would be either Jon or Bran. I also actually think LB is one *thing*, be it a person, object, or location and *not* a combo of the three most popular characters in this story.....But I make this post for fun and out of curiousity.

Daenerys would be too cliche because she fits all the signals.",15,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Or it was Ser Davos's wish to have Jon back,that Lord of Light chose to answer. However you want to interpret that. As I was first watching the episode I couldn't help but think of the similarities between Davos and Thoros of Myr. 


Thoros of Myr: ""It's a terrible thing to say, but... by the time I came to Westeros, I didn't believe in our Lord. I decided that He, that all the gods, were stories we told the children to make them behave. So I wore the robes, and every now and then, I'd recite the prayers. It was just for show. A spectacle for the locals. Until the Mountain drove a lance through this one's heart.
""I knelt beside his cold body, and said the old words. Not because I believed in them, but... he was my friend. And he was dead. And they were the only words I knew.""

Ser Davos Seaworth: ""I think mothers and fathers made up the gods because they wanted their children to sleep through the night. I'm not a devout man, obviously. Seven gods, drowned gods, tree gods, it's all the same.""
""Now I didn't know Lord Commander Snow for long but I have to believe that he wouldn't have wanted his friends to die for nothing.""

Although Jon and Davos relationship is fairly short,compared to the time Thoros and Beric spent together,I think it's pretty obvious Davos and Jon greatly admire and respect each other. When Davos tells Jon that Stannis sees something in Jon,leadership qualities and as a man of conviction,I believe Davos sees the same in Jon. And when Jon is killed,it doesn't sit well with Davos. Just like when Beric was killed the first time,Thoros couldn't accept his friend dying. Davos couldn't accept Jon dying as well,an honest and respectable Lord Commander,who always did the right thing. And both men were/are self-proclaimed ""non-believers"".
  Davos doesn't believe anything Mellisandre says but he's seen the powers she has,he's willing to try anything. Thoros no longer believed but at the pain of seeing his friend die,why not? I might also add,both men asked this for unselfish reason. Not for more power,to be in the right hand of the Lord of Light but for the friend they lost.
 I don't believe Davos was willingly trying to bring Jon back,he wasn't reciting prayers or anything like that. But when everyone thought Mellisandre failed and left the room, Davos has a lingering moment in the room with Jon,obviously disappointed and sad. A good and promising young man is dead..and it's in that moment, I personally believe, the Lord of Light chose to answer Ser Davos.

Tywin had Sansa married off to Tyrion with the hopes that they would produce a male heir. According to Tywin--sometime in season 3, I think, can't remember the episode--since this child would be the son of Sansa Stark, he would be the rightful heir to Winterfell, and named Warden of the North when he came of age. Until then, that title would go to Roose Bolton.

What's puzzling me is exactly how this transition was supposed to take place. Tywin was obviously a political mastermind, so I assume he must have had some sort of plan. But the way I see it, by the time Tyrion and Sansa's hypothetical son were to come of age, Tywin would have been dead and the Boltons long established as the ruling northern house. Tywin even allowed them to move into Winterfell, and (through Tommen) granted Roose's bastard son legitimacy so he could further the family line. Were Tyrion, Sansa and their teenage son supposed to just ask the Boltons to pack up and leave Winterfell, or assume the northern lords would automatically rally behind Sansa's son just because he was of the Stark line? The last Starks to rule the north would have been been dead for nearly 20 years by this time, and forgotten by a large chunk of the population. What's more, Sansa's son would have been raised in the south and likely have been seen as a complete foreigner by the northerners. Not to mention he would have been the son of Tyrion, the infamous dwarf, and a Lannister to boot. What kind of support could Tywin have possibly expected him to get from the northern houses?

The only way I can imagine Sansa's son displacing the Boltons would have been through force, and like I said I don't think the northern lords would have gotten behind him after 20 years of rule by the Boltons. If the Lannister army were to march north, it would have had a very hard time dealing with the colder climate and staying supplied in a hostile land so far from home. It would have been a protracted war that would have seen heavy losses on both sides.

I just don't understand Tywin's thinking on this one.",13,9,False,spoiler,,,,,

The comment said that GRRM has stated the white walkers are ""deeply misunderstood"" , i was wondering how they could be misunderstood as it almost implies they have good intentions.

What if the white walkers are heading south of the wall to westeros specifically to stop daenerys?  

i know the white walkers have been around for thousands of years so they could of been around the time when the targaryens first conquered westeros, between burning city's to the ground and madness throughout the generations it could make sense that the white walkers wish to stop them, also with the ability to raise the dead its possible to that some of the targaryens enemies throughout history are now part of the army of white walkers.

The white walkers have been gaining strength and numbers as danys army's and dragons grow. As magic returns to the world with the dragons could the whitewalkers feel it? the night kings stares down Jon at the end of ""hardhome"" could the nights king recognize Jon or sense his targaryen blood?

if this theory were true it would explain the ""song of ice and fire"" with the fire of dragons and ice of the walkers and also the whitewalkers being misunderstood as well as a huge final battle with Jon having to decide between his targaryen heritage or defending westeros from dragons.

let me know what you think guys or if ive missed something!

Bare with me here. I'm going to build up to this event by starting at what I think is going to happen at the beginning of Season 7.

Daenerys first takes over Dragonstone. This would make sense because we see her sitting on the Dragonstone throne in the season 7 trailer and it was the original seat of House Targaryen. It will be easy to take the castle. We don't know who currently controls the castle, if anyone, so it will probably be easy for her to take. Once Dragonstone is taken, Daenerys sends the Dorthraki army to the mainland by way of Rook's Rest (or one of the other close-by cities) with orders to make their way to King's landing to attack by land from the north. Olenna Tyrell teams up with Daenerys and sends her army to attack King's Landing from the south. Daenerys won't make the same mistake as Stannis so she will keep her fleet out of Blackwater Bay.

In the mean time, Daenerys sends a raven to King's Landing giving Cersei a chance to flee unharmed at the request of Tyrian. This is not in Cerseis nature. She will kill everyone in King's Landing before she gives up the throne. 

Cersei marries Euron Greyjoy (who is bitter about Daenerys teaming up with his niece and nephew) so she has his fleet to fight Daenerys' fleet outside of Blackwater Bay. Cersei also preps the wild fire around the city with the intentions of killing everyone, including Daenerys and her army, if they make it into the city. If she can't be queen, no one can. 

The battle for King's Landing begins. Daenerys has the upper hand so Cersei decides to burn the city. Jaime finds out about it and ends up killing Cersei, or attempts to kill Cersei. Euron escapes King's Landing with Qyburn, the Mountain, and Cersei's body via whats left of Euron's fleet. Daenerys, whos fleet has also dwindled in numbers, doesn't follow.

Tyrian ask Daenerys not execute Jaime. Jaime pledges allegiance to Daenerys, asking for forgiveness for killing her father. Daenerys agrees that it was the right thing to do and joins Daenerys (possible with intentions of betraying her).

Qyburn brings Cersei back to life. Cersei, however is not herself. Not quite a zombie like the Mountain, but not herself. Cersei kills Euron and takes his fleet. She has no other option to take back the throne then to team up with the White Walkers. By now word of the White Walker army has made its way all over Westeros. Cersie sails north of the wall and takes over Eastwatch.  

The Night's King, knowing his army cant pass the wall, and failing to take Jon Snows ships at Hardhome, heads to Eastwatch. Cersei makes a deal with the Night King to bring them south of the wall via her fleet as long as he promises to Kill Daenerys and Tyrian. The Night King makes Cersei the Night Queen (either by force or by her own will). The White Walkers and their army use the fleet to sail south of the wall.

Jon, during this time, is convincing the north to fight against the white walkers. I'm guessing there will maybe be a battle at the Nightfort at some point. There's also the story of Jon finding out his heritage. I have a lot of theories about what is going on with the Lannisters and the true reason Winterfell was built but I'll save those for another post.

*Edit

I've made an assumption that the white walkers cannot cross the sea. The wall seems pretty pointless if they can just walk under the water. In addition, at Hardhome the white walkers, nor their army, entered the water. I assumed it was because they couldn't. 
*Edit 

I filled in some gaps in my theories.
Thanks for reading and discussing this theory!",58,26,False,spoiler,,,,,

At first, the white walkers were following children of the forest to defend them against first men. 8 thousand years later they come back, but now the Night's king has learned how to create white walkers himself, and is not following the children of the forest anymore. His intention is to drive back the invadors of Westeros - the Andals. To destroy the iron throne, which was created after Andals conquered the 7 kingdoms. 

Night's King was a First Man, so it would make sense that he was opposed to the Andal race. After all, they slaughtered his people and took over the lands. The north however, is still mostly populated by descendants of First Men, meaning the White Walkers main task is to move to south, to the capital.

**My prediction for the ending of the story**

Daenerys Targaryen captures the capital. Her dragons deal great damage to the city, kill a lot of people, destroy buildings. She becomes a questionable character, slightly mad. 

Jon Snow is still ruling the North, by an agreement he made with Daenerys. After recent incidents, he is starting to question if Daenerys should rule Westeros after all.

The white walkers get past the wall. Bran Stark informs Jon Snow of their intentions. Jon Snow has to make a big decision: Does he help Daenerys, or does he help the white walkers? Does he choose the fire or the ice? He tries to stop the white walkers, but fails. They get past the north.

In the end there is a great battle. The dragons are destroyed, Daenerys is dead. The Iron throne destroyed. White Walkers are all over the lands. Every hope seems lost. But then comes Samwell Tarly. He finds an old book, written by chidren of the forest. He learns a spell to break the curse of the white walkers, he becomes A WIZARD. The White Walkers shatter and disappear, the long winter has ended and peace is brought back to Westeros.

They do mention the enormous length of the wall in the TV show, but that never really clicked with me until I started reading the books.   And now even that length seems utterly absurd.   These distances actually detract from the story in my view.  

I've since read that GRR Martin has stated he has never been good with distances and size.   So presumably even he thinks these things are blown way out of proportion. 

For my part, and I don't know if Martin or anyone else has made this suggestion, but I'm going to have to assume large distances and heights are off by a factor of 10.    Making the wall 30 miles long and 70 feet high (still quite large for a medieval society).   Although perhaps that makes things a bit too small for high fantasy amazement.   So alternatively one could assume that a mile in the GOT World is simply shorter by a certain percentage.  

I don't know if such conversions might conflict with other uses of distance and height in the stories as I've only begun reading.

I had a few thoughts/questions too:

1. Since the Boltons are now extinct, could the Dreadfort be given away by Jon, perhaps to Tormund, or another high ranking wildling?

2. I've seen a bunch of talk about Azor Azhai, the Prince who was promised--- I don't believe this was mentioned in the tv show, is it from a later book? Or something that GRRM has said?

Destiny seems to have a complaint about Jon Snow's lack of **dramatic** character change since his resurrection in season 6.

My personal opinion is that Jon Snow didn't really have time to take everything in, and it's too early to make a judgement. He immediately beheads Ollie and friends, and soon after Sansa arrives at Castle Black. Not long after, she pushes Jon into taking back Winterfell, and Ramsey's letter further pushes them into action. The important moment for his character growth is near the end of the Battle of the Bastards, when he essentially chooses to live and fights his way out of being trampled to death. After Littlefinger's forces clear up the field, Jon climbs over a hill of bodies and stares at Ramsey with a sense of tangible determination &amp; purpose that we haven't quite seen before.

1099,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2017-5-15,2017,5,15,7,6b6rgf,self.gameofthrones,[EVERYTHING] What would have happening if Robb allowed Catelyn to...,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/6b6rgf/everything_what_would_have_happening_if_robb/,tuskedkibbles,1494801809,"return to Winterfell when she asked? Towards the end of S2 EP1 Catelyn states her desire to return to Winterfell as she hasn't see Bran or Rickon in some time.

So the question is, what if Robb sent someone else to Storms End to treat with Renly? Obviously nothing much was coming of the negotiations with Renly or Stannis anyways, and Cat had no impact on Renly's assassination, so that part of the story remains unchanged.

I think that quite a few things are different in this scenario. First things first, Brienne dies. It is Cat that convinces her to leave Renly's tent so as to avenge him at a later time, without Cat there she is eventually overwhelmed by the rainbow guard (Renly's kingsguard) and killed, most likely by Loras. In the show Loras does not believe Brienne killed Renly so the Tyrells still flee with their bannermen in this situation. Aside from Briennes death, I don't see much changing, so back to the North. The first and most obvious change is that with both Cat and Brienne out of the picture, Jaime is never released. Do you think that Jaime is executed when Robb returns? Or do you think that he keeps him alive? Personally I don't think Jaime lasts long in this situation. I think that faced with widespread outrage, Robb allows Karstark to kill Jaime, or does it himself. Most likely the former. With this, Sansa's life is likely forfeit, which ultimately changes little (sorry Sansa) except to strengthen Robb's resolve. With the Karstarks remaining in Robb's army it's possible that he doesn't need the Frey's in this timeline. It's also possible that Roose Bolton doesn't feel like he needs to betray Robb as the war is still winnable. Robb still marries Talisa so the Frey's still go home, but since the Karstarks are still with Robb it doesn't matter as much. All in all, chances are improved in the south, but not to the extent that Robb has it in the bag. It isn't a lost cause now, but it's still quite sketchy, especially with the Frey's hostile to Robb (though he doesn't know it). It's possible that the Frey's make a marriage alliance to the Lannisters in exchange for a Frey attack on the Stark rear. I think this is unlikely as Walder Frey only agreed to betray the Starks after tons of reassurances from the Lannisters, and only when it didn't involve direct conflict. Nevertheless, food for thought. They are still the largest unaligned force north of the Reach (with the exception of the Vale).

That takes us back to Cat. Even with her gone, Robb still sends Theon back to Pyke, Theon still betrays Robb and takes Winterfell. So that begs another question, does Cat's presence at Winterfell change anything? Can Cat talk Theon out of all this? I'm not sure. Cat is an extremely willful woman, and doesn't like Greyjoys much to begin with. While maester Luwin tries to reason with Theon, Cat may just be furious at the betrayal and push Theon further away. Or she might be able to talk him down. As of the capture of Winterfell, Theon hasn't actually done anything to warrant the name ""turncloak."" He can easily be redeemed from the Stark perspective. It's only after he kills ""Bran and Rickon"" that he's fully against the North. What do you guys think? Does everything end the same more or less? If Robb still loses what are the greater implications down the line? In this scenario it is almost guaranteed that Brienne, Jaime, and thus Sansa, are all dead. Does Jon never leave castle black? Do the Lannisters go batshit at Jamie's death? Find out next week, on the next exciting episode of DRAGON. BALL. Z!!!!
Seriously though, what do you guys and gals think goes down?

TL/DR: Cat goes back to Winterfell instead of the Stormlands to negotiate with Renly, what happens?",13,10,False,spoiler,,,,,

The purpose of a bank is to make money. Gather money, save money, invest money. How do banks stay in business? By managing risk. By diversifying their portfolio. By requiring collateral. Not putting all their eggs in one basket. 

The Iron Bank of Braavos is no different. They invest (in the Iron Throne) and manage risk. We all saw how the bank used Stannis to get their investment back from the crown and the Lannisters. Stannis obviously failed. You think Stannis was the banks only play? No way. A bank doesn't get as big as them without proper risk management. They have other plays. One play I think? Arya Stark. I'm saying this goes all the way back to Season 1 with our old friend, Syrio. We all think it's suspicious as to why the former Sword of Braavos was in Kings Landing. I'm thinking he was there as a spy. To get close with the Lords of Kings Landing. I'm sure he had no idea things were going to play out the way it did. And he obviously took a liking to Arya. He saw an adventurous girl who loved her family and took a liking to fighting. Perhaps he was feeding this info to Braavos? And once everything went down and Syrio died (allegedly), Braavos sent in Jaqen to recruit Arya. They knew Arya lost her father and her friends and would want revenge. It was obvious from her personality. Arya was the perfect candidate. She was a Lord's daughter who was educated on Westeros and it's people.

Jaqen was to seduce Arya to the faceless man. Arya was to become ""no one"" to blend in and become a master assassin capable of killing Lords without a trace. He knew Arya Stark was never going to truly relinquish her identity. She had too much rage, she needed to avenge her family and friends. But he knew she still needed to be taught how to be an assassin. He taught her how to blend in, how to ""change faces"" how to make up a story on the spot. Hell he even made her blind and capable of fighting in complete darkness. Remember when the Waif asks Arya about her list and who's on it, even though she's supposed to be no one. Jaqen needed to make sure Arya still sought vengeance from certain people. We all know who was on that list. We all know the Bank needs those people dead if they are to ever recoup their loss. 

Why did Jaqen allow the Waif to hunt down and kill Arya? He knew Arya's training was complete enough to finish her list. But, he needed to know that she was capable. So he sent one of his own to see if she was worth the investment. The Waif was also a pawn in all of this. She hated Arya from the beginning. Probably jealous that Arya gets to walk right in and be trained. Jaqen used the Waif to train Arya and ultimately, be the final test to Arya's training. Once Arya kills the Waif and proves to Jaqen that she is capable, he lets her leave. Jaqen allows her to leave easily. Even after she admits she's still Arya Stark. Almost so easily, that it seemed like it was the plan all along. She has proven her ability to be an assassin and now she is free to complete her list. Free to kill the debtors to the Iron Bank. To create a power vacuum for someone new to fill the Iron Throne and pay the Iron Bank back their money. And without the need of an army. 

TLDR: Arya was a pawn in the Iron Bank of Braavos who, with the help of the faceless men, was trained to kill those in debt to the Iron Bank. This will create a power vacuum allowing a true player (Dany or Jon) to swoop in, take the Iron Throne, and pay the bank back the debt it is owed. ",33,75,False,spoiler,,,,,

There's a lot of scenarios with this, I can see most of the other Seven Kingdoms bending the knee but I feel like Jon and his people are too proud to do that, especially after everything they had been through to regain their independence. 

On the other hand, I can also see Jon knowing losing men fighting Daenerys is pointless when the real war is with the White Walkers.

When Jon had the advantage he still fought Ramsey one-on-one but when Ramsey had the advantage he declined. Its not like Jon has ever seen Ramsey fight so he could have been Ser Arthur Dayne for all he knows. Ramsey says he heard stories about Jon but that could have been his manipulation of the situation to make Jon feel he is superior in skill and to easily decline in front of his team.

Ned's death in the first season was an absolute shock, a reaction meticulously orchestrated by GRRM to flip the genre on its head. Death has been his primary tool for challenging expectations, and got damn is he good at it. Each major death in this show is full of irony, and foreshadowing, and genuine mourning from the audience. Take Hodor for example, his death has been staring at us in the face since we learned his name. 


ok with this being said, there is a final, genre-bending tool at his disposal that is only coming into play this season, as the White Walkers close in on our main characters. While we've seen resurrections ie Jon Snow and Beric Dondarrion, none of our main characters have died and **returned as wights.** This sort of ""resurrection"" is totally looming and guaranteed to be some of the more devastating moments in the series. So my question: who will we lose? Knowing the Night King's backstory, GRRM is sure to use a beloved main character(s) to do what many zombie flicks try and fail to do---challenge our perspectives on what is life, what it means to be human, and if human life has any inherent value.

Okay guys, here's the thing, did you ever realize Ned always says ""Winter is coming"" and IT ACTUALLY CAME? Just wow! I never realized it... 
... 

Okay, if i still havent lost you, im getting to the real deal, which is;
Go to the first scene we get with Jaime&amp;Cercei talk in front of the dead body of Jon Arryn, and the show wants us to think they are kind of responsible for the death of Jon Arryn, they talk about something secret, some information that might get them killed which died with Jon Arryn implying they have benefit from his death right?

BUT right when this scene ends, guess which theme starts playing?
Yes, THE LADDER.

Is there really point for the Ladder to start singing there except from foreshadowing the actualy killer, i think not...

Was this obvious? Not that i find this ""remarkable foreshadowing"" just wanted to state something i figured out, thanks for reading!

Melisandre tries all the chanting and saying ""the old words"" or whatever to bring back Jon, and it doesn't seem to work. It's not until after she says ""please"" and then gives up and walks away that it works and he comes back. This goes back to when Thoros of Myr explained how he ""brought"" back Beric. ""...And I said the old words. Not because I believed in them, but because he was my friend. And he was dead.""

I do believe that the Lord of Light only brings back people who have an unfulfilled purpose, but the only way they can be brought back is when someone truly pleads to him. Not ""doing magical shit"" but begging for their dead friend to come back to them. That proves that they clearly have a purpose because their friend needs them so badly.

I would want Jon to command houses Karstark, Bolton and Umber to give fighting men, gold and lands to the Hornwoods, the Mazins and the Mormonts, the houses that fought with him. He could take some men from them to form a new Stark army.

From what I gather, the Hornwoods live close to the dreadfort, and could take those lands. The Karstarks have lots of land that could be given to the wildlings. The reason I believe the wildlings couldn't live in the lands of the Umbers is that everyone there hates them, and that there undoubtedly would be fighting, which they can't afford. 

House Mazin doesn't exist in the books, and they don't have a known holdfast or location. As Bear Island is cut off from the mainland, house Mormont wouldn't gain much from obtaining lands there, but could get soldiers and gold instead. 

The reason why I don't think this will happen is that the show doesn't have enough time to address this issue, and that Jon is too focused on the war against the WW to care about ""a few squabbling houses"" as Ser Davos nicely puts it.

Season 7 will most likely end in a big bang sorta like season 6, season 8 will probably finish with some sort of conclusion.

So you have to ask yourself. What's the biggest possible finale you can think of for Season 7?

My prediction is that: The White Walker king will get close to the wall, touch it and summon the ice dragon that was trapped in there for a 1,000 years (popular theory), the dragon will awaken and burst out from my wall splitting it in two. The white walker army will be able to fit through and Bran isn't repsonsible for the death of the Seven Kingdoms. (Another popular theory that Bran will walk through the tunnel in the wall and break the magic allowing the white walker army a second free pass)

The ice dragon is bigger and fiercer (Says it in the books) than Drogon (Biggest dragon in the show atm) so therefore the white walker army will actually have a chance against Daenarys.

What are yer theories and predictions for Season's 8 finale?

sorry I have no idea how to make a gif so bear with me here but noticed something and I'm not sure if its been pointed out before or not so sorry if I'm late to the punch.

@1:34 of this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2sTq_uBoLs 

you see littlefinger use the above mentioned phrase which he likely has used before and then we see Tyrion use the same phrase probably after hearing littlefinger use this phrase in a small counsel meeting or what have you here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j54ZDer1M-0

and most recently missandei uses this phrase to gain support for Tyrion with the people of mareen at 0:42 in this vid:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJJMVSe8ig

so finally an example of when littlefinger did some (if only a little bit and totally unintentionally) good for the realm

It has also been confirmed that None of them are Dunk and Egg or Roberts Rebellion (we can also eliminate a Tourney at harrenhal spin-off sense that is a prelude to Robert's Rebellion). So this means that they will be something different so now I ask what do you guys think the four spin-offs will be. For me here is what I would like to see (in no real order):

1. Aegon's Conquest. (Do I need to say why this should happen it would just be awesome to see and I think it would make a great tv show. Only problem is the cgi budget)

2. Original Long Night mixed with the age of heroes mixed with the arrival of the first men. (This would indeed be able to give us more info on the past of Westeros and we can see the like's of Bran the builder and the last hero and maybe even the original Azor Ahai and his Nissa Nissa. Not to mention more giants and children of the forest)

3. Oberyn Martell prequel show (need I say more)

4. The Future (yes I want to see a spin-off set after the main series and I think it would make sense. Of course I do not want to happen right away I would atleast want one other spin-off to happen before they think about doing it (that spin-off being any of the latter three) but I think it would be awesome to do. There are two ways I can see it going down either 100 years after the main series about the children and/or grandchildren of the characters we know and love or even further in the future in a present day westeros featuring Guns, Modern Politics, and new themes to explore. Which ever path they do this would be a cool idea if a spin-off was set in the future) ",13,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

That will absolutely not be the case for several reasons. 

1. Fancy Tree Fort was probably only built recently, as in once Bloodraven went beyond the wall to not return. He probably found the few remaining CoF and they helped use magic to protect it appropriately. However, when the wall was originally built there were many more CoF and magic had a much bigger presence overall so I think it's safe to assume the same rules don't apply to the same barriers; the magic spells woven into the wall are much stronger. 

2. When they are saved by the true 1st Ranger of the Watch, Battlin' Benjen Stark, he says he himself can't cross because the magic prevents the dead from crossing. The key words being ""the dead."" Bran isn't dead. He is just marked but still more alive than Benjen or the Night King. 

3. Benjen also says the Three Eyed Raven sent him to help protect Meera and Bran and get them to the wall. Surely the Three Eyed Raven would be aware if Bran crossing would bring down the wall. Why would he send him to cross if it would bring down the best defense of the kingdom? He wouldn't is the best answer. 

4. ""But what if Benjen/Coldhands is working for the Night King?"" I can hear people yelling it right now. To that I say don't be ridiculous. He's a Stark. Stark's aren't evil. Some do stupid things like marrying the wrong woman or telling Cersei to leave instead of arresting her, but they aren't evil. 

Obviously the Night King will cross or bring down the wall somehow, but I don't think it will just be from Bran taking a leisurely stroll the Castle Black's gate.

We never get told exactly what story Ned made up about Jon's mother. All we learn, at least in the show, is that there was a woman named Wylla. 

What I don't understand is how anyone with half a mind couldn't see through Ned's lie. He was never good at lying and deception. It seems to me like he just told everyone the baby was his and everyone just took him at his word. If Jon hadn't taken after his mother, Ned would have never been able to bluff his way into claiming Jon as his. 

What do you think would have happened if Jon had looked more like Rhaegar? Do you think Ned would have been able to keep Jon safe in that case?

Jon has faced the White Walkers twice and survived, Been resurrected, Defeated the Boltons (The medieval society is giving Jon all that credit. They won't give it to Sansa and by extension Littlefinger) who were widely hated. Held the wall against the greatest wildling army ever assembled. He is also a unparalleled swordsman maybe in the entire north maybe all of westeros. Having defeated the leader of the Thenns, the Mutiny, White Walkers, Qoran Halfhand, and Ramsey. Their are a LOT of reasons to follow Jon. Factor in they know the WW are coming and they have to align behind someone. Who? Sansa? A woman with no real accomplishments who may be a puppet of a southern weasel? Cersei? They have to rally behind a leader. In Jon they see Ned. Being the son (as far as anyone knows) of Ned Stark is VERY important. The North doesn't hate bastards like some other places. Being Lord Commander at such a young age is a BIG deal. Also don't assume everyone hated his choice to let the Wildlings through. Remember they fought at the Battle of the bastards along side Jon to rid the North of the Boltons. A point brought up when the north threw their support behind him.

Keep in mind the writers of the show implied a lot. They didn't tediously trudge Jon across the entire North to every lord and have him give the same speech each and every time. That would have been really bad tv. It is implied that when he went around the north asking for help that the conversations he had with Mormont and Glover. The North KNOWS about the WW. T.V. shows are not going to continually restate the same info over and over again that the watcher has already learned. The audience learns it once then through clever writing it gets implied that certain information is spread around. You think Jon went to all those lords and kept leaving out the threat of the WW army? Why tell Mormont then? You think the men following him have not been telling other soldiers the rumor of his Resurrection? Not everything is going to be explicitly stated on screen over and over. Remember Tormund says they see you as a GOD. You think those men are keeping that secret as they travel all over the north? Soldiers gossip.

They know the Army of the dead is coming and so is Winter. They need someone strong who listens to council who is a man of action. Is Jon perfect? Nope. They won't find perfect. Not in time. Jon is the Norths Winston Churchill.

Edit: I forgot. Jon did send out letters asking for Money and help to all the northern houses. Remember Sam helped him. he even asked the Boltons in Winterfell. In the letters he told everything he knew of the WW. ",86,22,False,spoiler,,,,,

Following Marsella's departure to Dorne, Cersei believes Tyrion is trying to take her children away from her, she's mostly guided by her concern for her children and the devastation over losing Marsella but also she is driven by her hatred for Tyrion. In response, Cersei captures Ros (one of Littlefinger's prostitutes) thinking her to be Tyrion's ""whore"" (Shae) who Tyrion's fallen in love with and threatens Tyrion by telling her that every wound Joffrey suffers she will suffer too and if Joffrey dies Cersei will torture and kill her. Tyrion then learns she has Ros and not Shae but still despises Cersei for what she has done. He leans in to her and tells her: 

""I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you are safe and happy, and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth. And you will know the debt is paid""

Season 4: During the trial for Joffrey's murder, Cersei, believing Tyrion and Sansa to be responsible, stages a trial full of false, or true events twisted to incriminate Tyrion, to ensure a guilty verdict. During her testimony to the court, she references when Tyrion said this to her. 

I believe two things 1) that Cersei believes Tyrion and Sansa were responsible for the death of Joffrey, especially because of Sansa's escape. Given their relationship, Tyrion's relationship with Joffrey and her rapid descent into maddness. 2) That Cersei believed this to be Tyrion's retaliation, hence why she brought that moment and that quote back up. For her, at this moment, this was the most devastating thing anyone could do to her, ""your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth"". 

However, we know Tyrion was not responsible for Joffrey's death. Which leads me to my main points (sorry for writing so much). Since this was not the product of Tyrion's machinations, the threat still looms. And, given everything that happened between season 3 and season 6, the hatred in Tyrion's heart has only grown deeper for his sister. 

I think season 7 will give us the delivery of this threat. Either as Dani burns through King's Landing with Drogon, burning the Mad Queen alive in her castle OR some deliciously melodromatic (depending on the writing, don't let me down Dan&amp;Dave) scene in which Tyrion, mounted on or beside one of the dragons, reminds her of this threat then burns her himself. 

Any thoughts as to how the final showdown between Tyrion and Cersei will look?

I'm so excited I could die. How will Jamie play into all of this? Will he follow through on his threat to Tyrion that he told Bronn? (""If I ever see him again I'll cut him in two""--I might start a different thread for that scene because its really problematic). ",26,19,False,spoiler,,,,,

Personally I was kind of hoping the spinoff would center (D&amp;E) however, apparently there wont be any adaptation of that... (yet). Nevertheless, as I kept reading the article, found here: http://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/game-of-thrones-new-spoilers-about-hbos-prequel.html/?a=viewall ,it tickled my brain knowing that ""There are five separate prequel series currently in development."" FIVE SEPARATE PREQUEL SERIES CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT!?! That's an insane number of possible GoT universe content. Imagine five insanely rich, totally captivating, and visually stunning possible GoT story content. 

I couldn't possibly shake the idea of five different possible story plots that took place in the GoT universe. I immediately got to thinking what the content of these possible stories could be. Then it hit me. Many suggestions/theories concerning what the prequels might be based on are stories and events that are relatively close to the time period we are currently seeing in the GoT universe, concerning how old the GoT universe actually is. What if one of the five prequel ideas pitched to HBO is dated years before the events of what we're currently seeing in the GoT universe? What if the prequel is dated twelve millennia ago, when the Children of the Forest ruled Westeros. 

Thanks to season six, we already know that [S6E5](#s ""the children of the forest created the white walkers""), besides this, and some other details located throughput the book and television series, we don't know much about their race. 

Wouldn't it be nice to see the same history lesson told by a different perspective? The history as told by the conquered race. Against the First Men, [TWOIAF](#b ""the Children not only faced a mass genocide, they were pushed to the coldest region of Westeros, and caged there with the aid of an ice wall""). Wouldn't it be nice to see how the Children enjoyed the lands of Westeros before the First Men? To see their culture; how 'Greenseers' interacted with the community, what their role was, how they served their tribe. Maybe the prequel can center a powerful Greenseer who has just emerged within one of the many Children tribes. 

It would be nice to see the how the Children worshipped the old gods, their experience with the old gods, the mystery behind the carved faces in the Weirwood trees. 

The series could take place when the [TWOIAF](#b ""First men barely arrive, and it could explore the constant fight the Children endured trying to fight off the conquerors trying to diminish them""). 

It could also follow the relationship of the different races that now live among the wall. How did the Children, Giants, and Wildlings interact before the arrival of the First Men? What other creatures roamed pre-historic Westeros? What happened to them? 

What are some of these race's origins? What if Wildlings were initially part of the First Men, who then felt sorry and sided with the the Children once they realized their wrong-doings.

If necessary, this prequel idea could span over various centuries. Considering that the Children's ""... lifespans are clearly measured in millennia"", the series could follow the same tribe of Children and their journey throughout different eras of Westeros' history. This could be a series whos central theme is that of survival. A series where the audience would finally gain some sort of answer as to why and what led the Children to cast such an irreversible spell (S6E5) that would soon unleash hell in the Seven Kingdoms.

I think that the exact opposite will happen. I think Jon when he meets Dany will not only NOT bend the knee (no they will not be in conflict just yet) but later Jon will have a problem with Dany using her dragons on her enemies mainly because Jon thinks of the innocent bystanders who can get hurt or worst killed. Also Jon will want to make peace with the others. Yes the others have done alot of killing but the wildlings have killed many members of the night's watch before Jon made peace with them so why can't there be peace with the others.

Dany however will want to destroy them even if they have there own culture. Finally I think Gendry will be forced to marry Dany to try and end the war between Baratheons and Targaryens but Gendry will be treated as a prisoner. Arya will come and try to free him but being mistaken for an assassin by Dany Dany will either kill Arya or imprison her. Jon after hearing this will leave Dragonstone and make peace with the others and i believe at the end of season 7 will set up Jon and Daenerys to be enemies in season 8.

With Jon controlling the others and leading an army made up of the northern armies, Knights of the Vale, Riverlands, Ironborn, Wildlings, Pro Westerlands amry, Highgarden, and the Others. against Daenerys and The Unsullied, Dothraki, Dornish, House Tarly (led by Dickon), Pro-Dany Westerlands Army, and her Dragons. With Jon also planning to save Arya and Gendry. Also it will be like Captain America: Civil War where they are both fighting but you can understand both sides and why they feel this is right.

In season 2, she beat Loras Tyrell to become a part of Renly's Kingsguard.  In season 3, she defeated Jaime in the episode before he lost his hand.  In season 4, she nearly killed The Hound.

I know Cleganebowl is already confirmed, but before the Cleganes square off, I think Brienne might fight The Mountain, the remaining finalist.  I know logistically they are on opposite sides of Westeros, but the Hound is also far from his brother.  I think that probably around the end of season 7, Brienne will fight The Mountain and defeat him, but just like the other three finalists, she will not kill him.

If this theory about the direwolves fate is true, then I have two posible explanations:

One: Eddard choke Lady and by taking her daughter to king's landing he is doing something similar. Sansa Leaves Winterfell as a sweet little child, and after all the suffering she endures that naive girl dies to become someone else.

My thoughts on what happens to Arya in Season 7 and 8. When Jaqen H'ghar met Arya in Westeros, he was basically finishing his training by finishing up any old business he had before returning to lead the Faceless Men. Essentially, no one can become a man with no name until old business is taken care of. There, he encountered Arya who saved him and the other two prisoners. He knows the Faceless God now needs three deaths in return and offers Arya to name them. 

Now, Arya is back in Westeros essentially cleaning up old business and will at some point find herself in a situation where she (and maybe others) will be doomed but then saved by someone. She will then realize that the Faceless God is owed a death in return for her life being saved and will give her savior the 'name them and I will kill them' deal. Once all old business is taken care of, she will realize the pattern and return to Bravos to take her place leading the Faceless Men.",86,11,False,spoiler,,,,,

Varys claims to not make dwarf jokes.  Yet in season 5 they do exactly what Tyrion says they do.  Tyrion call him a eunuch and spider while Varys calls him imp and half man.

https://youtu.be/eJ6kclT15z8?t=3m37s

I know they are titles given by others to ridicule them but Tyrions names are jokes on him being a dwarf.  I suppose they could have forgot but it just feels like the writers forgot about that little exchange.  I don't know why but every time I watch that season 6 episode I wish Tyrion would call bullshit on Varys.  Any inconsistencies that annoy you when you rewatch the show?

The final battle will be similar to the final battle in *The Hobbit*.  Many factions will come together to fight each other in one huge battle.  In the midst of that battle (or just prior to it) these factions will finally realize their common enemy:  the white walkers, wights, and their leaders.

Key to this battle will be the deaths of major characters.  I strongly believe Daenerys will die, along with Theon, The Hound, and possibly one of the Stark children.  I want to think Tyrion will also die... and he may... but the key will be Daenerys' death.  When she dies, her dragons are going to go berserk - especially Drogon.  **Bran will be the one to control the dragon(s) and thus turn the tide against the white walkers and their leaders.**  I feel this last prediction will definitely come true.

The only person who would tell her of the events in the throne room are Sandor Clegane, with whom she was tagging along for an entire season, but it isn't clear that they ever had that conversation. Seeing now photographs of Arya in what is probably the courtyard of Winterfell, the Hound, and Bealish with Sansa makes me think of the following sequence of events:

1) Arya, Melisandre and the Hound meet. Maybe Brienne too is in the lot.

2) Melisandre informs them of the events at Winterfell, including the intervention of the Vale.

3) When Clegane hears of Baelish being in Winterfell, he tells Arya of the events back in the Throne room, where [Littlefinger put a knife at Ned's throat](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/You_Win_or_You_Die). His duplicity becomes evident, maybe with the help from Melisandre or a vision sent by Bran.

4) Arya, relieved that her family has Winterfell, but scared by the presence of Littlefinger so close to her sister, rides north to warn them. Maybe Petyr Baelish is reminded of *Valar Morghulis*.

I have seen theories saying he may secretly be a Targ and that's why he is undermining the Lannisters, but what stands out to me is his castration. A man who practices magic needed his parts to burn in the flames and speak to his god. We have heard from Melisandre that the lord of light needs kings blood. I think over the years kings blood became confused with Targaryen blood. After all, why is Lannister blood more magical just because they're sitting on the iron throne? So in reality, the lord of light needs Targaryen blood to work his magic. The reason the priest needed to cut Varys and burn his parts in the fire was because he needed Targaryen blood in order to talk to the lord of light. I think Varys being a Targaryen can help shape the ending to a game of thrones. We need a third Targaryen to be a dragon rider alongside Dany and Jon. Now that we know who the third is, it's safe to say Varys will be the third head of the dragon to defeat the army of the undead. And since Cersei's right hand man is the Mountain and he is undead, he will need to be defeated too. Luckily, there is a group of lord of light followers heading towards kings landing to defeat him. And the way George RR Martin likes to redeem evil characters into good ones it would be fitting if the Hound redeemed himself and marched with the Brotherhood to save the realm. This would have the Hound fight the Mountain and save the seven kingdoms. FUCKING CLEGANEBOWL CONFIRMED",15,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

After watching Hardhome, I noticed the temperate dropped when the WW's entered. Obviously it was already cold, but a blizzard arrived also when they came. 

Does this mean that they bring the weather with them to some degree?

For example, could they walk into a boiling hot and sunny environment, and simply turn it into snow and cold, or are their other factors? How cold does it need to be?

This is all in relation to my main question, how they will actually move south in season 7?

I personally would like to see some epic scenes of them moving through the wall, black gate, winterfell, just the whole north.

The Mountain will kill Cersei under Qyburns orders, here's why.

1. Qyburn is the one really controlling the Mountain.  
- Qyburn brought Gregor Clegane back from his injuries after the trial with Oberyn, his methods were mysterious and we know he had his chain removed for delving in dark arts (possible necromancy) 
-One scene in particular pointed this out to me. When Cersei and Qyburn were leaving a room together, Gregor followed Qyburn out instead of staying close behind Cersei. Seemed to me like he was guarding his true master over his Queen.

2. Qyburn has motive
-Qyburn was introduced as a victim of The Mountains rampage through Harenhall, it makes sense for him to seek revenge on the ones who sent him.
-Possible claim to the throne (?) With all the Lannisters dead, in exile, or without claim to the throne, and all known Baratheon's dead, who does the throne go to? While he definitely can't claim it by bloodright, Qyburns recent acquirement of the title Grand maester and the lack of a hand of the king may be enough to push him towards the iron throne, especially with the force of The Mountain at his beck and call. At bare minimum, killing Cersei sets him up to remain on the council when new invaders sack Kings Landing and find the mad queen dead at the hands of Qyburn and Gregore Clegane (similar to Tywin's rise to power during the battle of kings landing under the Mad King Aerys)

3. storytelling aspect
-Qyburn's storyline of victim of the Mountains rampage to loyal member of team Lannister never sat well with me. I think it would be better and more in theme with the show to have a grand revenge plot revealed when he orders Cersei's death.
-Cersei's downfall plays well with this theory, characters frequently die because of their own traits. Cersei has always viewed herself as more cunning and more powerful than anyone around her. Having a outcast maester turned final close ally take her out of the game would be the ultimate ending.

I never saw the series, and don't really intend to see it. At least not in the near future anyways, because the few series that I ever watched has good parts, but also fillers and boring parts, and I don't want to start a series and get ""betrayed"" again with fillers and the likes.

Anyways, I do like reading. A lot. So I wondered, how good are the books really? I heard the tv series has death, torture, rape, gore, ect... but how are the books? Are there such elements in it?

The reason I ask is that I do find it interesting that there is a fantasy genre with a more adult theme than say The Lord of the Rings -which I loved by the way-.

I love historic and fantasy novels a lot. Without spoiling me, what am I to expect? Are they easy to read? A lot of action scenes? Boring or very long and tedious scenes?

From what I know, the last (?) novel will be out this year or so, and that is when I'm thinking about buying the first book, if it looks interesting enough.

* Rhaegar + Lyanna = Jon Snow

* Jon Snow is Azor Ahai

* Dany is Azor Ahai

* Meera Reed is Jon Snow's twin sister

* Jojen Reed is sacrificed and eaten as a paste by Bran Stark

* HR=HS i.e. Howland Reed is the High Septon

* Mance Ryder is Rhaegar Targaryen

* The time trvelling fetus theory : Tyrion is originally Dany's son who was sent back in time into Joanna Lannister's womb and Joanna's son by Aerys was sent forward in time into Dany's womb as deformed child. Consequently, Tyrion is the Stallion who mounts the word and Prince that was promiced. (My favorite theory)

* Tyrion is secretly the son of Mad King Aerys

* Bolt-On : Roose Bolton is an immortal being who kills his heir and wears his skin and lives on forever. 

* Syrio Forel is Jaqen H'ghar

* Ned Stark is Jaqen H'ghar

* Benjen Stark is Daario Nahaaris

* Euron Greyjoy is Daario Nahaaris

* Ser Pounce is Azor Ahai

* is your favorite theory?

* is utterly trash?

* is most likely to come true? ( Except R+L=J. Because it's been confirmed as true in show)

I'm just rewatching the first season of our much beloved fantasy saga and noticed something that might foreshadow the ending of the tv show. In the episode ""You Win or You Die"", Ned confronts Cersei with his learnings about Robert's bastards and the true lineage of Joffrey and the other Baratheon/Lannister children. Cersei mentions that not grasping the throne himself might be the biggest mistake Eddard ever made which he denies. This reminded me of the battle at the Tower of Joy where Bran was able to - albeit briefly and faintly - interact with the young Eddard. 

Is it imaginable that Bran might be able to alter history and persuade Eddard to take the throne instead of Robert and thus - being a far superior regent than the Baratheons - rule the Seven Kingdoms instead? It seems like a lot of shit has gone down since Robert was installed as king (War of the Five Kings etc.) and this could subsequently serve as ultimate happy ending. Including almost everyone being back alive. :) How likely is this? What do you guys think?

One of her identities while in the Riverlands is **Squab** which is another word for **""little bird""**

#Arya's Name

Thanks to /u/Slipguard for pointing this out:

&gt;It's a homophone for **'aria,'** a term in opera that refers to a solo singing section usually performed by a woman. So her name literally means **""a song.""** And hey, the word **'swan'** comes from the Indo-European root word *swen: **""to sound or sing.""** In other words, the root words for 'Arya' and 'swan' are synonyms!

So according to that translation it literally means **""the singing bird"".**

**Aria** is also the Latin word for **Air.** And we know she has wished for wings. A beautiful coincidence?

Like Arwen (Lord of the Rings), Arya's name also translates to **Noble** - two characters who have the same coloring (Dark hair, grey eyes, princesses) and we know George was inspired by Tolkien. Arya means **Lioness** in Hebrew, which is ironic considering her clashes with the Lannisters.

~*~


While Arya is travelling along the God's Eye lake, she climbs a tree to get a better vantage point and she sees the Isle of Faces (The Children of the Forest's most Holy place, where the Green Men live) right in the middle of the God's Eye lake. (Note: Arya's direwolf Nymeria spends a lot of time with her pack around this area)

&gt;**Arya felt as though the lake were calling her.** She wanted to leap into those placid blue waters, to feel clean again, to swim and splash and bask in the sun. But she dare not take off her clothes where the others could see...

&gt;From up here, she could see a small wooded island off to the northeast. **Thirty yards from shore, three black swans were gliding over the water, so serene . . .** no one had told them that war had come, and they cared nothing for burning towns and butchered men. She stared at them with yearning. Part of her wanted to be a swan the other part wanted to eat one. -  (Arya, A Clash of Kings)

- She ends up at Acorn Hall and meets Lady Ravella Smallwood (of House Swann) their sigil is a **black &amp; white swan facing each other on a shield.** Ravella puts Arya in a dress and tells her she is pretty. Arya remembers her fondly and would only act like a *Lady* for Ravella.

- Swans are black and white and so is the House of Black and White and that is where Arya is being reborn at every full moon. 

- Arya is literally the odd one out among Ned's children, born with the traditional dark Stark coloring unlike all her siblings who followed the Tully side. 

**WATER DANCING**

Arya stands on her toes, on one leg. This is indeed reminiscent of ballet. Ballet dancers learn to stand upright, on the tip of their toes, often on one leg. It's explicitly linked to the water dancing. So, ""water dancing"" = ""ballet"" and Swan Lake is a ballet that also has narrative similarities to Arya's story. 

&gt;Ned stopped and looked at her. ""Arya, what are you doing?""

&gt;""Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours."" Her hands flailed at the air to steady herself.

&gt;Ned had to smile. ""Which toe?"" he teased.

&gt;""Any toe."" - (Eddard V, aGoT)

Later on, **Arya wishes she could dance on water.** This is what the Swan ballet dancers do!

&gt;Skinny as they were, her legs were strong and springy and growing longer every day. She was glad of that. A water dancer needs good legs. Blind Beth was no water dancer, but she would not be Beth forever. - The Blind Girl, ADWD

In Winds, grrm highlight's Arya's gracefulness both in character and physical behaviour. And even adds this imagery: 

&gt;She was not far from the Gate as the crows flies, but for **girls with feet instead of wings**, the way was longer. - Mercy, Winds


**UGLY DUCKLING MOTIFF:**

Arya's insecurities and her *Ugly Duckling* situation (a swan born among ducks): The only child of Ned to actually look like a traditional Stark while all the others followed the Tully coloring. Dirty and unkempt as a child, teased and outcasted - Arya Horseface - she will grow into a beautiful swan. 

&gt;Arianne touched the pin that clasped [Balons] cloak, with its quarreling swans. I have always been fond of swans. No other bird is half so beautiful, this side of the Summer Isles. 

&gt;Your peacocks might dispute that, said Ser Balon. 

&gt;They might, said Arianne, but peacocks are vain, proud creatures, strutting about in all those gaudy colors. **Give me a swan serene in white or beautiful in black.** - The Watcher, ADwD

What if Petyr asked Jon for Sansas hand in marriage, we know he likes her because he reminded her of Catelyn, and what if Jon says no and he hints towards his mother, angering him and then he suggests a fight, mirroring what happened all those years ago.

Daenerys has 3 dragons and the combined power of the Reach and Dorne (The Reach can field more Troops then any of the 8 other kingdoms) This isn't gonna be the field of fire 2.0 its gonna be a slaughter even without the dragons.. The banner men of Cersei would no doubt abandon her because of what happened the last time the Westerlands went against dragons. Even if Euron's ""1000"" ships get built and he helps Cersei, Daenerys still has more men and 3 dragons. In reality there would be no war she will have already won by the time she landed in Dragonstone.

- Arya/Nymeria reunion in the forest where she appears to be camping. The shot where she is making a campfire is shown from behind a tree so maybe Nymeria is watching her from there. Also, Arya/Gendry reunion when she is riding that horse through some town area?

- Jaime will stay be Cersei's side but will lowkey stop trusting her. He will keep her in check (keep your enemies close) until he gets a chance to take her down.

- Melisandre will tell the Azor Ahai prophecy to Dany and convince her to work with Jon Snow

- Littlefinger will try to manipulate Sansa to betray Jon and when it doesn't work, he will drop subtle hints to Jon about his real parents to mess with his head (leading to the crypt scene where Jon manhandles LF)

- Arya will probably try to eliminate another target on her hitlist but will realize that some of her targets (i.e. Cersei) are too powerful to take down alone so she will go back to Winterfell and reunite with her siblings, helping them to kill Cersei eventually.

When Dany left at the end of season 6 she had boats from all over. On the sails were the Targaryan, Dorne, Pyke and Highgarden emblems. Those ships would have sailed mostly empty with the thought that they are to carry back Danys army (unsullied/dothraki). Once they land in Westeros there wont be a need for all those to stay at Dragonstone, they would be better used transporting their respective armies.

So when they get to Dragonstone, Dany keeps her ships and the Dothraki army - this explains the final scene with the army/dragon. The Dorne ships ships and possibly the Greyjoys go to dorne - this explains Asha and the Sandsnake making out. The Highgarden ships sail to the western edges of Westeros with the unsullied. Olena Tyrell promised her ships because she wants to kill Lanisters, so they take the unsullied to Casterly Rock/Lannisport (maybe Tyrion goes with? Nah..). So those **battles between Lannister and Unsullied are actually in the Westerlands.** This explains how the unsullied could be fighting there without going all the way across the country first.


---------------------------------------
**Other Tinfoil**



Arya's scene in the woods is a POV low to the ground and behind a log. Perhaps from an animals point of view..... such as a direwolf? The scene where she is looking under a bed leads me to believe she is in Winterfell and is looking for something from when she used to live there. Maybe her old bedroom?



There is a scene with Jon running from something and another scene with the gates at the wall opening. I am guessing that is a Bran rescue attempt. Furthermore there is a scene where Jon is beating up Little Finger in the crypts. My hunch is that this is after Bran has revealed some stuff. The fact that it is in the crypts leads me to believe it is information regarding Jons parentage and/or how Ned was betrayed by LF.


Euron is teaming with Cersei and thats who is blowing up theons ships. This part is probably obvious.


In the kings room scene Jaime is not wearing black and it looks like he has Jofferys sword. Perhaps he is the lord of Casterly Rock now? The sword is called Widows Wail, perhaps foretelling his fate with his widowed sister?

3. Someone has fallen at The Vale.

4. All kinds of dead people northeast of Casterly Rock.

6. One army still upright in The Reach

7. I have no clue about the four big markers and the fact that one is down. There might only be three and I don't want to acknowledge what that could mean.

8. An army has fallen in Dorne.


9. Fighting at Deepwood Motte

10. There is an army in The King's Wood.


11. There is no one at Winterfell.

Trailer hint?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/6d6y90/everything_dragonstone_legend_trailer_hint/,caseyod81,1495680523,"I hope I'm doing this right. I just joined Reddit recently and this is my first post. I don't think there's any spoilers as long as you're caught up in the show, but I think part of what I'm about to discuss only was mentioned in the books although it's not a plot point, just a history legend kinda thing.

I don't recall this very well since it's been a while since I finished reading the books. But I remember something about there being a legend that there are frozen dragons or dragon eggs or something along the lines buried under Dragonstone. Am I correct in that? If so what is the true legend about what is under Dragonstone?

The reason I ask is because in the new trailer it looks like Daenerys arrives there. And she touches the ground. And it made me think... what if there are dragons or dragon eggs still hiding there and she is able to revive them like she did with her three eggs? She could get even more dragon support to kick butt against white walkers and gain the throne. 

I'm personally a fan of the theory of Daenerys, Jon, and Tyrion being the three heads of the dragon (and all being Targaryans). But I also think the Stark warging powers could make it possible to them to utilize more dragons if they had them (like for example Bran controlling a 4th dragon while the Targaryans ride on the other 3). But then again that would probably be too perfect of an outcome for this series! Not true George RR Martin style lol.

They *were* in the crypts and Lyanna's statue does appear in the background, but is there any reasonable explanation for why/how Baelish could know about R+L=J?

Ned made sure absolutely no one knew about that because he understood what the consequences could be. Even his wife and presumably closest person did not know - he once warned her never to ask about Jon's mother again (and scared her so shitless she actually never did), despite the fact that her knowing would probably relieve a lot of tension (between Cat and Jon, between Cat and Ned) as it would reassure Catelyn that Ned never betrayed her. Still, he didn't tell her - he was that secretive about it. I doubt anyone ever knew except maybe Howland Reed.

I don't think Baelish knows either, even if spies etc. Besides, even if he did know, I don't think he'll be the one to reveal it to Jon. Jon learning about his parents might be the most pivotal moment in all his arc, so it would make a lot more sense if this moment came from a brother or friend.. A lot more likely IMO that Bran or Sam be the one to tell him about it.

So how could Baelish know? What other stuff can explain the moment in the crypts?",38,26,False,spoiler,,,,,

The similarities are quite close, and the makeup is consistent with the grayscale effect. I speculate that this is at the Citadel, where he may have tried to get healed. He is currently in quarantine, and the slimy effect on his hand is probably the result of attempt by the maesters to cure him. 

The colors of the wall behind the door are not consistent with the North, so I do not think this is wight Hodor's hand trying to enter Castle Black or Winterfell. The wall behind is plastered, not stone or brick, and has the same tone as the castle or fort being assaulted by the Sullied and defended by the Lannister men.

1) Back when Joeffrey was alive, Cersei made a comment about the Targaryens.... I forget the line but I remember her making the comment. 

2) Jaime and Cersei of course have their tight relationship, which doesn't play too much importance here, but it terms of when I get to Tyrion, it might.

Ok, so everyone knows that Tywin hated Tyrion over the death of his wife giving birth to him, and he held it against him even after knowing he kept King's Landing safe after the Stannis invasion. My main centerpiece of my theory is that Tyrion Lannister is the only true Lannister child 100%, whilst Jaime and Cersei are half Targaryen. Now this is the reason I need help because I need to know more information about how this theory could be more believable. This is also IMO why Tywin didn't hate his other children because he knew of their ancestry and if they failed, it wouldn't tarnish his overall legacy as much as if Tyrion fails. 

I'd love to see the comments and reactions to this theory and the flaws that may be in it. Thanks :)",8,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

There will be a new Iron Throne made as a memorial for all those lost in the great war. But I will not be made of Iron, instead it will be forged with all the Valyrian steel swords that We have seen in the show.
Jon Snow's ""Longclaw"" Briennes ""Oathkeeper"" Randyll's ""That one sword"" The one Mira grabs when escaping the cave with Bran and Hodor(Speculation) Geoffry's ""Widows Wail"" Euron's ""Nightfall and Red Rain""(speculation)
GRRM said the ending would be bittersweet. and if this theory came true, I think the combination of all the swords would have a lot of symbolism of unity in the realm.

Anyone who has read the books knows about the Horn. It *supposedly* has the power to bring down the Wall when blown into. It was *supposedly* used by the King-Beyond-The-Wall, Joramun, to awake Giants from the Earth, presumably so they could defeat the Night's King and restore order to the Watch.

The Horn is never explicitly referred to in the tv show, although there is mention of the King-Beyond-The-Wall (Joramun), in a season 2 dvd special.

Then of course there's the horn that Sam and Grenn found along with the dragonglass, aways back in ye ol' season 01. **If** (big old ""if"" here) this is indeed the Horn of Winter then I would like to submit the following assumptions:-

- The horn was found in a Night's Watch cloak along with the dragonglass, beneath a tablet marked with Runes of the First Men. It was therefore left by a Brother of the Night's Watch a very, very long time ago, possibly during the Age of Heroes and the Long Night.

- Since it was left by a Brother and there was dragonglass, then the intent of the package was to provide a means of fighting and slaying Others.

- It does not therefore follow that the Horn of Winter would be left in this cloak, since its' purpose - to destroy the Wall - runs contrary to the objective of fighting and slaying Others.

That last assumption confuses me. If the Horn can bring down the Wall then why bury it where it could fall into the wrong hands? Why not simply destroy it or bring it back to the Wall and bury it under the ice where noone can find it? The easy answer of course is that it isn't actually the Horn of Winter, but I believe other possiblities exist.

It's possible that the Horn cannot be destroyed, hence why it was buried. It's also possible that the Runes prevent Others from accessing the Horn, allowing it to be safely hidden while also providing a way of retrieval by the Night's Watch or Freefolk.

It's also possible that whoever hid the horn didn't intend for it to be found by the Night's Watch. Think about it. The horn belonged to Joramun, King-Beyond-The-Wall, yet it was buried in a Night's Watch cloak. The horn was either given to the Night's Watch willingly by Joramun, with the understanding that bringing down the Wall would endanger all of Westeros and possibly the world; or it was taken or stolen from Joramun by the Watch to prevent him from bringing down the Wall himself.

If the horn was stolen then whoever took it may have had deep feelings of remorse and guilt and therefore left the horn to provide a slim chance of bringing down the Wall and allowing the Freefolk through. The dragonglass and the horn could then be considered as a moral allegory - the dragonglass representing duty and the horn defiance.

According to legend, the Night's King subverted the Watch into an instrument of the Others. It was Joramun and Brandon-the-Breaker, Lord of Winterfell and King of Winter, who joined together to vanquish the Night's King and restore the Watch. It stands to reason that whether given or stolen, the horn could not have fallen into the possession of the Watch until after the Night's King was defeated. It may have been in the possesion of the Watch for a long time until it was hidden, for all we know.

All of this is immensely speculative of course. If the horn Sam found is indeed the Horn of Winter, then the possibilities are endless.

There is of course the problem that the tv show already has a Night King, who definitely cannot be the 13th Lord Commander, for why would there be a Night's Watch before the threat of Others and Wights? The point being that ""Night King"" and ""Night's King"" are decidely too confusing for viewers to distinguish between and so a lot of this speculation could fall apart (not that it won't of its' own accord since it relies on too many assumptions and speculation). It is an easy thing to change names however and the show has demonstrated this time and again to adapt different elements of the books.

All of this makes me wonder how the Wights and Others plan on getting past the Wall. We can assume that they will probably not be able to use the horn, since it simply isn't in their possesion, but that doesn't exclude the possiblity of an ally of theirs using it to allow them through. Perhaps a vindictive Cersei Lannister decides to use it as a final act of spite against the Realms of Men for their defiance to her rule?

We also don't fully understand the nature of the Wall itself. It's said to have powers of its' own, although what they are we can only speculate. What if the Wall could somehow become a tool in service of the Others, rather than a massive obstacle to overcome? I know that it doesn't make sense, since the purpose of the Others is to kill men to create Wights and the Wall impedes that, but what if getting through the Wall is in fact child's play for the Night King and the Others? What if the Others themselves created the Wall to keep out the Children of the Forest, or dragons or any other threat and the Others can actually walk through it at will? It could be imbued with powers that grant the Others the ability to spawn all sorts of nasty *Winter Magic.*

Crazy shit, I know.

**tldr; Sam might have the Horn of Winter, which can bring down the Wall. This might be the plot device that allows the Wights and Others through. The Wall might not be the great defence against the Others that we think it is.**

I just have this really bad feeling that the Night King is going to march right up to the Wall, stick his cold dead hand on it and the thing will **part like the Red Sea.**

I had an a-ha moment today and I realized it must be simpler than I thought. When Arya whispers Jaqen's name to him, he does not want to die... but this must mean that he doesn't want this face/mask/disguise to die yet because he hasn't completed his mission. Yet after Arya escapes HH, he gives her the coin and tells her how to find him again. Then, he tells her that ""Jaqen is dead"" and changes his face, thereby signifying that his mission as Jaqen has been completed and he's off to complete his next assignment. To me, this is the strongest evidence that Jaqen was there intentionally to find Arya from the beginning and the FM wanted to train her. I can't wait to see what she does with the training and I wonder if we will see the FM again in the show (I'm sure we will in the books because Jaqen is supposedly in Oldtown).",11,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

I've enjoyed the battles that have been in the show already and I thought they were very well done. And I have no doubt the great battles to come will be epic and I'm sure I will will enjoy them immensely. But the first six seasons had a good balance of witty dialogue, political intrigue, mystery, great character development, etc. with maybe half a dozen great battles over sixty episodes. I felt that was a good balance. As much as I enjoyed Battle of the Bastards, Blackwater Bay, Hard Home, etc. I don't love GOT because it's a great action flick. I love all the rest of it as much or more.

There are only 13 episodes left and I can imagine at least half a dozen more great battles (as many as we had in the first 60 episodes). That leaves little time for anything else. I hope the writers can still strike a good balance and find some time to focus on the characters and some of the small things.

I'm sure it will be great... **I guess what I'm saying is: the final battles will be amazing, and they are certainly required to wrap up the story, so it's not like I want to cut them out. I just wish there were more episodes left (like 23 instead of 13) to balance them out, instead of ending with a marathon of action.**",38,35,False,spoiler,,,,,

Tyrian has gotten a few shafts (like the leadership of the vanguard) but the biggest issue is the missing Tysha.    What other event is more responsible for Tyrian killing his father and leaving with a hatred of his once loved brother?

**2nd event** 

The other big event I think is the old lady who predicted Cersi future. It really set the stage of why she hated tyrian, and wanted him dead.  She *mistakenly* believes the younger brother who is going to kill her is Tyrian.  I firmly believe it will be Jamie that kills her, but that is that. . .

I don't doubt that Daenerys Targaryen will have great initial success. Dany will likely begin by capturing smaller houses and making uneasy alliances. Over time things will begin to fall apart for her.

1.	Signs of maddness: Let us not forget that she is the daughter of the Mad King. Coupled with her own personal suffering, her growing irrationality may drive a wedge between her and her allies.

2.	People will see this as an foreign invasion NOT liberation: Enough time has passed that an entire generation does not remember a Targaryen on the throne. There has also been a healthy dosage of anti-Targaryen propaganda due to Robert's hatred of them. Let's not forget Dany IS more culturally foreign now than Westerosi. She has come to adopt many foreign customs and the forces loyal to her are foreign. The Dothraki in particular pose a serious problem. Their culture will will clash with the residence of Westeros. For instance, Dothraki do not believe in money and simply take what they want. How long can Dany keep them appeased? What will be the effect if she loses control of them even once?

3.	The Reach will eventually turn on her: What would happen if the plot to kill Joffrey was unveiled? Olenna is a Tyrell by marriage and without a bloodline and her rivals will pounce on any reason to have her ousted/killed. As we've seen in the Braavos play the people seem to believe the the Lannisters (sans Tyrion) are the good guys (damn liberal media!). Cersei could spin a narrative that Tyrion and Olenna were responsible for the destruction of the Sept of Baelor as they were for Joffrey's death. It may be coupled by the revelation that Tyrion is in fact the son of the Mad King and not a Lannister. Last but not least, Dorn and The Reach are old enemies. It may not sit well with either side's people that they have been forced into an alliance with their enemy to support a foreign invader.

4.	Dorn is ineffective: What has Dorn ever done militarily really? They managed to keep from being conquered by using guerrilla warfare but how effective will that be in the coming war? They are survivors and the one thing you have to worry about survivors is they will run away when things get tough.

5.	Euron Greyjoy: Now that Dany is backing Yara, Euron will have to find a new marriage target. The obvious choice here is Cersei. With the support of the Iron Born she now has a navy to harass supply lines and limit Dany's ship movements.

6.	Dragons: Drogon has shown to be somewhat independent minded/unpredictable. This could be possible foreshadowing of the him turning on her. Being the biggest he may kill the other dragons in the process.

7.	Uprising in ""Slavers Bay"": Once Dany is off the continent it is safe to assume the cities will revert back to the masters or fall under a new external threat. Will this divide her attention or even worse, divide her forces?

So there are a lot of things that could happen to Dany during her invasion/liberation of Westeros. What about the Jon Snow?

1.	White Walkers: The North seems to be the only ones who are concerned about this. It is likely most Jon's time will be defending against the White Walkers. There is a strong possibility that Jon Snow may REALLY die in a final showdown with the Night King.

2.	Smaller Forces: The North is the smallest of the three in terms of military. Assuming he defeat's the White Walkers, it will likely come at a time that the rest of Westeros has been consolidated under either Cersei or Dany. He cannot afford to divide his forces to help either side before then.

3.	Jon is a Targaryen: This will be eventually unveiled. How will the Northerners feel about their King of the North being a Targaryen? Especially with another Targaryen invading in the south? Could Little Finger use this to push Sansa as Queen of the North? The only true Stark left?

4.	Religion: The North prays to the old gods. We've already seen the Faith of the Seven taking on a fundamentalist attitude. It is unlikely they would quietly accept Northern rule.

5.	No Navy: Without a Navy Jon may find it far more difficult to conquer Westeros.

Here are the advantages for Cercei:

1.	Wildfire: If used properly this will be a combat multiplier.

2.	Jaime: He loves Cercei more than anyone on the planet so it is unlikely he will betray her. He, along with Bronn, are the most effective military commanders on the field.

3.	Lannister Forces: If I'm not mistaken they have about 60k fighting men. This is a large enough force to at least hold onto King's Landing until more allies can be procured. They also have far more experience fighting in Westeros outside the North, where presumably most of the fighting will take place.

4.	Cercei is more ruthless: Now that her kids are gone, we will see a far more ruthless Cercei. Cercei will be able to easily make the tough decisions that Dany and Jon may struggle with.
My final thought is...this just seems like something G.R.R. Martin will do. He is big on deconstructing fairy tales and interjecting reality. In reality the bad guys often win.

It is much more pale and also has a light pink flesh tone on the under side of its wings. Drogon is very very dark colored with a more purple flesh tone under his wings. 

I'm sure to many people this seems petty.  But it could be one of the bigger spoilers in the trailer. If it is Viserion, and its near Casterly Rock, it could point to a couple of tinfoil theories about certain characters lineage being true.

Aegon originally took the Vale by sending his sister to give the young lord of the vale a ride on her dragon.  SweetRobin loves flying things.  Whats a cooler flying thing than a dragon?

Quoth the Wiki:
In response to the Targaryen successes, Sharra Arryn, Queen Regent of the Vale, strengthened the defenses at Gulltown, moved a host to the Bloody Gate, and tripled the garrisons at the way-castles which guard the Eyrie. Sharra made Aegon an offer of marriage and alliance if he named as his heir her son, Ronnel Arryn, the young King of Mountain and Vale, but was refused.

Despite Aegon's refusal, House Arryn felt secure in the Vale. Visenya Targaryen, however, flew Vhagar to the Eyrie's inner courtyard, and Sharra found sitting on the knee of Aegon's queen her son Ronnel, who asked to fly on the dragon. After flying three times around the Giant's Lance on Vhagar, Ronnel became Lord of the Eyrie and Aegon's Warden of the East.


So it seems logical that to win the vale all Dany would have to do is give young SweetRobin a trip around the vale on the back of a dragon(Viserion for symmetry sake?) .   He'd declare for her and house Targayren immediately if offered a dragon ride.  He'd be like 'Littlefinger who? ' This also helps pave the way for Littlefinger to die, as it fills the power vacuum that would be left when he's gone.

The other possibility is that this story of Aegons conquest is foreshadowing him flying in a different way ie. through the moondoor.  Id like the visual of young robin going 'Wheeeeee' on the back of a dragon much better.  Thoughts?  Think this may happen in the books, but the only thing stopping it on the show would be CGI budget, but with the reduction to fewer episodes, this may be more likely now.",9,12,False,spoiler,,,,,

since Dany is on her way to Westeros and will probably meet Jon soon, I tought how they would interact with each other.

They have already two connections:

* Dany is Jon's aunt
* good relation to House Mormont

Jon wants to protect his family and knows that the nightking will attack.
Like Ned &amp; Robb he doesn't want the ironthrone.

Dany just lives for her will to get the ironthrone back to House Targaryen and she has a big army which is probably crucial in the war against the nightking.

I think that

* there will be a marriage (with a happy-end), so House Targaryen's incest tradition continues
* Jon helps Dany to get the irone throne back to House Targaryen (maybe Jon will be the king)
* House Targaryen &amp; House Stark fight together against the nightking 
* Jon could ride one of Danys dragons
* Bran will be lord of Winterfell (Brandon built Winterfell, Bran rules it)

Some have seen Kit and the actress who plays Alys getting along but two things 1. that does not mean they get along in the show and 2. There is always more then meets the eye and on top of that Robb killed the head of that house so why would the Karstarks ever forgive the starks.

While the Karstarks will lie and make them think they will be on there sides.

You're only half right. This was partially discussed in another thread, but when Robert wants to kill Dany/Viserys, crush the remaining Targ's before they have the chance to get to Westeros, and knowing the R+L=J is true, I think there are a lot more layers to Ned's comments towards Robert. His instinct as a father and a generally compassionate/honorable human being is ""woah she's a kid, let's please not do what you're suggesting."" I think this is an equally large part as to why he says this, because he's thinking honorably: He who passes the sentence should swing the sword. But knowing that Jon is half Targaryen, and knowing (assuming fAegon is indeed fake) that those are the only pure Targaryen relatives that Jon will ever have (besides Maester Aemon, RIP) , it would definitely add another layer to why Ned wouldn't want Dany, Viserys, or her unborn child killed. First, they're the only relatives Jon would ever have known, and at that point Robert hasn't died, Dany's child and Viserys' army is just a rumor, and not seen as a legitimate threat. If Ned did indeed plan to tell Jon about his parentage after he took the black, it would be comforting for Jon to know he had living relatives, even though he would have renounced all formal familial ties at that point. Another reason that Ned may have been quick to disagree with Robert is because he's the only father Jon has ever known. Ned has gone to hell and back for this kid, raised him as his own, suffered rumors and a slight of reputation, marital quarrels, and caused this kid havoc just to keep his name a secret. If Jon ever found out, if ROBERT ever found out, and Dany and/or Viserys had been assassinated, R'hollor only knows what Robert would do to the Starks. Ned is his oldest friend, but based on how much he hates the Targs, I would not put it past him to have Jon killed or Ned sent to the Wall and his family shamed forever etc etc. 

I know this may seem kind of obvious given the rumors about R+L=J from way back in Book 1, but I had never truly thought about the political danger Ned put himself in accepting his position as Hand of the King for Robert. It adds another layer to everything that happened in A Game of Thrones/Season 1 for me. By never telling anyone, he kept not only his entire family safe, but his own life and most likely the life of Dany and Viserys safe too. I can only imagine the paranoia Robert would have suffered from if Jon was somehow outsted as a Targaryen while Robert was still alive and Dany was coming to Westeros.  ",6,9,False,spoiler,,,,,

She finds some way to deal with the White-Walkers, most or all of her dragons survive and Westeros somehow makes it through the Winter. Arguments about how some/all of that wouldn't happen is irrelevant to the question.*


How exactly is Dany going to break the wheel if she wins? What changes would she bring to Westeros that would switch up the paradigm? 

Dany is a champion of the disenfranchised, so it makes sense for her to put unlikely heirs in positions of power. You have women in charge of Iron Islands, a bastard for Stormlands, a bastard/woman for Winterfell, bastard women for Dorne, a dwarf for the Westerlands and so on. But within a generation or two the power would revert back to the legitimate male heirs. Additionally, since she won't have children of her own, her death is likely to result in another succession crisis. 

But assuming she makes arrangements for all that - like have Jon's kid succeed her and make changes to the laws of succession - that wouldn't change the political nature of Westeros. The high lords would still rule and scheme to better their position. The conflict and intrigue that has plagued the court for generations would still be there and eventually, wars would break out again. 

Sure, she has her dragons and her big army, but ruling through them is ruling through strength and fear. If she demilitirazes the feudal lords and concentrates all the power in the crown, sure there is less chance for a civil war, but its better for a tyrannical rule. Even if Dany rules wisely, she can't ensure that there won't be a tyrant after her. 

Varys seems to believe that Dany would be good for the small-folk, but what exactly would she do for them? How can she empower them so that they are not downtrodden? After all, unlike Essos, most of the smallfolk here are okay with the system - they just happen to dislike particular lords now and then. And its not like Dany can introduce democracy overnight - or even over a few decades. This world is barely familiar with the idea and it'd take centuries for them to establish a parliament. 

Not to mention, right now, the economic situation of Westeros is a complete mess. Even in victory and surviving the winter, there is a long road of rebuilding ahead. Not even Tyrion could come up with a brilliant plan to fix this mess. How is Dany going to handle that? She hasn't shown any talent when it comes to economic development of the country. And even with that development, things wouldn't change much. The money would still go through the high lords and trickle down to the common folk. Ofcourse, she can choose to be a conqueror - she already has Slaver's Bay and she can start expanding the territories to Essos. But that would make her an imperialist enriching her country at the cost of others and that hardly seems heroic. 

Basically, while Dany winning the war might bring peace and prosperity for a while, within a generation things would be back to normal in Westeros. I don't see Dany making any fundamental changes to the system that would convince me that she'd be able to break the wheel. Things that would actually break the wheel would be too outlandish and OOC while other moves would just keep the wheel rolling. Am I missing something here?

Otherwise it's disappointing, kind of like when Stannis died. Yes Brienne got to avenge Renly, but his death seemed anticlimactic and unsatisfying. You might disagree with this, but compare his death to a few other characters. Ned's sent a whole mess in motion, and the audience was attached to him so it was very impactful. Joffrey' death led to Tyrion Trial, the audience had been dying to see him go, and it was a huge plot point that pivoted many characters story arcs. Ramsay outsmarted John, killed Rickon and Wun Wun, almost won the battle, and his death put the starks back in winterfell. He was a big threat, so his death had to feel earned. It's not a matter of morality and who deserves to die in what way as a person, it's a matter of storytelling and who deserves to die in what way as a character.

That being said, there are characters we know will die soon, meaning it's their time to shine not fizzle out. Here's what I'm hoping for in the next two seasons.

I know Dany will defeat Cersei, and I want her to. However, I really hope Cersei deals serious blows to Dany. Smooth sailing is boring so Dany needs to suffer loses, and struggle to keep people interested. She blew up a ton of characters last season, so now the bat is set higher, and she needs to do something worse and more impactful before she dies.

Little finger is going to go soon too, but his character is too important to go out like a chump. People need to struggle and suffer to get rid of him, rather than some one putting him in his place. He's with out a doubt the most manipulative if not the most intelligent character in the story. So an idiotic mistake is not the way he should go.

I could go on, but I think the point is clear. This goes for Euron, the mountain, and the night king as well. I know I've only really talked about the villains who are alive, but that's just because I know they will die before it ends.

Basically, I think bad things need to happen to characters who don't deserve it. And that characters who do deserve to die, continue to make significant impacts on the characters around them before they die, and go out with a bittersweet bang. It's what makes GOT amazing and it should continue to do this with the current characters even though we like them. The idea that fan favorites are safe should never be true.

 That was quite a bit so I'm glad you read it all, please weigh in on the topic so we can have a discussion.",17,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

It's sensible to wait until the season is about to begin before we set it up since the later trailers might spoil some of the questions, but for the time being, I was thinking of 30 questions (most correct answers wins) and I wondered if you guys had any opinions on the questions.

The answer to every question is either YES (it will happen) or NO (it won't happen).

The questions:

1. Daenerys Targaryen dies

2. Jon Snow dies

3. Cersei Lannister dies

4. Daenerys Targaryen sits on the Iron Throne

5. Ayra crosses at least one more name off her list

6. Jamie and Brienne reunite

7. The Wall is destroyed or breached

8. Someone (other than Daenerys) rides one of her dragons

9. Melisandre burns someone alive

10. Varys lectures someone about power

11. Sansa and Arya reunite

12. Jon forgives Theon for his crimes

13. Olenna insults Daenerys in her presence

14. Three new supporting characters: Archmaester Marwyn, Alys Karstark, and Koner, all survive to the end of the season

15. Tyrion is dismissed, or resigns, as Hand of the Queen

16. Bran returns to Winterfell

17. Sansa agrees to marry Littlefinger

18. Daario Naharis returns

19. Season 7s episodes get an average IMDb user score of 9.0 or higher

20. An ice dragon appears

21. Jorah is cured of Greyscale

22. Davos Seaworth cries

23. Tyrion and Bronn reunite

24. Euron Greyjoy dies by drowning

25. Grey Worm and Missandei break up

26. Nymeria reappears

27. Heartsbane is destroyed

28. Tormund saves Briennes life or Brienne saves Tormunds life

29. Jon Snow discovers who his mother is

30. Gregor and Sandor Clegane duel

I've also thought of a tie-breaking question: How long (in minutes and seconds) into the season will the first on-screen death occur?

The first is, if the mad king had not died, then kings landing will burn from wildfire. Hence why everything is burnt. 

The second is the wall, and I'm not sure about this one, but it may be a link to the idea of Jon or Aemon? I'll leave this one for speculation. 

The third is in a Dothraki tent, with Drogo. Had Drogo not fallen off his horse (and later died), Dany and Drogo would have had their son.

Now here's where the symbolism gets invovled - what if Sandor Clegane somehow gets his hands on and comes in with one of them fancy Valyrian Steel Lannister swords? That way it would literally and figuratively be a Clegane protecting their Lannister master from a lion.

So first off, the most obvious choice would be Tyrion, since he's her younger brother and he's literally her small younger brother, haha. The second choice would be Jamie, and this would be pretty cool because we know that he's a few minutes younger than Cersei. But my pick goes to the Hound. I'm not excluding Tyrion and Jamie, tho. The Hound could be the valonqar and Jamie or Tyrion could still be the one to do it, physically. And it all has to do with cleganebowl! I mean, I've been binge watching GoT since the end of season 6 and i'm all hyped up for this theory to come true, let alone all the people who have been watching from the beginning! The hype around cleganebowl started pretty early and when the Hound was presumed dead, i can only imagine the pain of all those watchers. His resurrection came back with hope tho, only to be lost again when the High Sparrow manipulated Tommen to get rid of trial by combat. Now that he's gone, and trial bby combat is back on the list we can all get back to boarding the hype train!!! This has been one hell of a ride and i think i speak on behalf of everyone when i say this needs to happen!!! So, if cleganebowl does indeed happen, it will be so great, so amazing, so fucking big that i expect my tv to just blow the fuck up. But awaywayz, what way to make cleganebowl bigger than it already is, than to have the Hound kill his brother the Mountain, thus fulfilling the prophecy.

I would assume the only ones present in this meeting would be Jon's banermen. This means the kid must be one as well. But who exactly is he? My theory is that the boy must be the son of Smalljon Umber, and because Smalljon died at the Battle of the Bastards this boy is now Lord of Last Hearth. 

Now because the Umbers are traitors to house Stark, Jon would be within his rights to keep the young Lord of Last Hearth as a hostage. But I don't think he is being keep as a hostage, otherwise why is he allowed to sit with the other Lords in this meeting? Jon must have forgiven what survives of House Mormont. 

This is a sign that despite the betrayals of the past, Jon will choose to take a more merciful approach to his new rule.

This whole time she has been moving towards being an assassin, and now she is one. Her purpose in the story is to assassinate a big bad in order to resolve one conflict and move the story forward. The whole faceless man ability isn't there to be cool, it's there because it will play a huge part in said assassination. That ability has limits, so that helps us narrow down who she can disguise herself as. Her body won't change, just her face. So it has to be a girl that's roughly her size (assuming the target knows the person she's disguising herself as) She is heading north, so Cersei can't be the big bad she takes out. In the north there is only one, Little finger. Otherwise she'll just be chilling in winterfell. Who's face will she use? I know I said a girl before, but Robin is a candidate. The other possibility is Sansa. This seems less likely because Sansa would have to die before Ayra wears her face, and I don't see her killing her sister for that purpose. That is unless Sansa betrays the Starks, possible, but I doubt it. Sansa could be killed by another, I would guess little finger (either directly or indirectly). In that case Arya would steal the face and kill LF. LF would be horrified that the person he killed has come after him. Sansa dying would also give Ayra the motivation to kill little finger, either that or the hound telling her that LF betrayed her father. Arya could die in the process (because she served her purpose as a character). Her path is a dark one, and it won't have a happy ending, bittersweet at best. I'm pretty sure all this will happen, but an alternate route (perhaps with the same destination) would be her playing a role in brand storyline. I don't expect Arya to be fighting in the war for the dawn, but I could see her protecting Bran. Mel will play apart in her story or at least meet her again (because she said so) but I have no idea how it will fit in. What do you think?

I'd love to go on about other characters. Theon, The hound, Jamie, Jer bear, all seem to be going pretty specific direction based on what we know about them.

I'm partial to little finger, with no shame. He's an incredibly interesting and intelligent character. So I'll talk about him, and it might get a little tin foil, but I promise the logic will be sound.

He's always doing what's in his best interest. So if he were to realize the WW threat before it's too late for him, I'm sure he would shift gears and try to save his skin. He loves climbing the chaos ladder but he values his life more than that, he can always climb on later. So he has the potential to have a character shift, like Jamie or Theon. We may not feel sympathetic for him, but he could work with the north. Similar to Mel, she burned a little girl alive, total party foul, but we know she is useful and needed. She had a shift as well, just not as dramatic as Jamie or Theon, so if LF had a shift it would be more like hers. To put it more simply, if he decides the WW are a serious threat to him, he'll cooperate with others so there's still a kingdom for him to steal when it's all over.

Here are some more probable theories. He could end up being one of the ""kings that freeze in their castles."" The vale might be taken by the army of the dead. He would be horrified and probably jump out the moon door. When and if he goes, I'm 74.8% sure he'll go out that moon door. His chaos ladder may give him tunnel vision and he'll get blind sided by the winter and all that comes with it. 

Perhaps the most probable scenario is him not making it long enough for the WW threat to reach him. He may not have that realization moment at all. But I do like the idea of winter being the thing that kills him. It would be really cool if LF's plan is foiled by that instead of the other players, meaning he could have succeeded if winter hadn't come.

Now looking through the years with Dany we see her learn as a leader, avoiding advice when she thought right and taking it when she thought it was right. We see her learn as a leader and with people like Tyrion by her side we see that she could be a just ruler. Although then we get the complaint of her becoming a mad queen like her father. This is the major problem people have with her. I personally don't think she is showing symptoms of insanity especially when she herself is fearing her insanity. She does however say to Dario that she feels nothing. Although I believe she is wrong here. She obviously feels so much for Jorah. She loves him. However maybe Jorah is her last link to her gentle side. Maybe when he is gone she will become a mad queen. 

This is why I feel Dany is Azor Ahai. We know Azor Ahai is a saviour to mankind but it doesn't say he is a noble person or a sane man. From what we see the process of making the sword made him insane, driving him to kill his love. This is a story of a madman who is sent to save the world. Maybe Azor Ahai needs to become ruthless and insane to destroy the white walkers and save humanity. So maybe Dany will become insane with her last act sacrificing Jorah, destroying her love and the love inside her to truly become Azor Ahai.",2,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

- Dorne (House Martell)

~ 7,000-8,000 Unsullied
- 3 freakin dragons

Dany's probable/potential supporters (due to their hatred for Cersei):

- The Riverlands
(Although perhaps weakened after the fighting against the Lannisters and Tullys)

- The North 
(Possibly less likely due to Jon wanting to focus on the army of the dead)

Now for Cersei's army and official allies:
- The Crownlands
- The Westerlands

Cersei's potential allies:
- The Iron Islands (Euron Greyjoy) (most likely)
- The Vale (only because of Littlefinger)

Unknown:
- The Stormlands???
(This one is tricky. All the Baratheons are dead, so wouldn't Cercei inherit Storm's End? Alternatively, perhaps Gendry could return and gain support of his father's homeland)

From what I can tell, Tormund is seen carrying a double sided obsidian axe, and one of the group is carrying an obsidian spear. As for the guy in the circle with the ""warhammer""; it's definitely just a rudimentary obsidian axe. 

Why would anyone be carrying a warhammer? The best weapon against the dead is something that can dismember them (or fire) and unless it was made of valyrian steel it would do no good against the white walkers. An obsidian axe is the only thing that makes sense here.

Forgive me ahead of time for any mistakes, I'm typing this out quickly at work.

So the Night King grabbed Bran's arm during one of his trips with the three eyed raven and if I recall correctly the Night King will now ""follow him to no end"" or something along those lines.

Now, I found it awfully coincidental that a dead Uncle Benjen came to save the day as Bran and the gang were being overwhelmed by wights in forest. Do we know the extent of the Night Kings power? This is were I think my theory gets a little shakey, so feel free to correct me, but who are we to say that the Night King couldn't fully resurrect Benjen to use as a friendly face for dastardly events?

If I remember right, the Wall has some sort of rune or spell cast upon it that's supposed to prevent the Night King from crossing. So why wouldn't the Night King use Benjen to get Bran closer to being to Winterfell so that once Bran crosses the gate, he and his army could follow? 

I'm going back to work, but I'll check on my lunch break to see if anybody has any input or reason why this theory could be implausible.

Some background first. You have three major heroic mythical figures related to the Long Night. 

The Last Hero - He is probably the most irrelevant one here. All we know is that he fought against the Whitewalkers, he sought the CotF for help and he founded the Night's Watch. There is no prophecy about his return. You could easily argue that he was a person who lived 8000 years ago but is no longer relevant. 

Azor Ahai - He is a figure from Essos, not Westeros. And WhiteWalkers never got to invade Essos. Legends from Essos say that he fought against Darkness during the Long Night, not Cold or Ice. Other legends speak of Shadow monsters that also came during the Long Night (A World of Ice and Fire). 

Its entirely likely that a completely different race of monsters rose up in Essos while the WhiteWalkers stayed in Westeros. And sure, Azor Ahai helped beat them back and the priests of R'hollor just made up a prophecy of his return for the next Long Night.

PtwP - No indication that this one ever existed during the last Long Night. His prophecy is about the bleeding star, salt and smoke, 3-headed dragon and dragons from stone - but no mention of a flaming sword. And that's kind of the identifying feature for the prince. 

Now, the Prince's prophecy is probably the most reliable one. But even that maybe the result of misinterpretation. Maybe someone like Bran or Dany saw a series of visions thousands of years ago and drew random conclusions. Maybe they saw stone eggs cracking in fire, Jon killing a Whitewalker, a red comet passing and so on - and figured that these visions were about the same prophecized savior. 

The priests of R'hollor, on the other hand, either heard of this prophecy or saw similar visions and jumped on the bandwagon with their own twist. To them, whoever they saw fighting the WhiteWalker *must* be Azor Ahai reborn, sent back by R'hollor in their time of need. After all, they are pretty close minded about any other possibilities. 

Its entirely possible that in Yi-Ti or Asshai, people are claiming someone completely different as Azor Ahai. Maybe a child born the night of the comet. Maybe their version of Azor Ahai doesn't need dragons from stone - just a flaming sword. And maybe that guy is supposed to fight shadow demons who'd also return with the Night - while someone else handles whatever is going on in Westeros.

Or maybe, the Long Night brings all sorts of creatures with it and different regions are supposed to fight in different ways. Any ""prophet"" from 1 region could see someone from their area fighting against Winter monsters and assume that they are the ""true"" Azor Ahai - and they'd be just as right as Melisandre about Jon or anyone else about Dany.

Was he a promising prince undone by one fateful choice? Was he a fool for love and a hopeless romantic unsuited to the politics of Westeros? Was he the Mad King's son, just as cruel and capricious as his father? Opinions differ based on which king you serve. 


The opinion of the fandom, however, seems pretty united. Though quite a bit of this is speculation, the general course of events goes like this. Rhaegar was a wise, noble and charismatic prince set to be a good ruler - especially after the disaster of his father. Aerys and Rhaegar did not get along very well because of the former's paranoia. Rhaegar first met Lyanna at Harrenhal's tourney - probably after he discovered her as the mystery knight. It was love at first sight - Lyanna falling for the fairy-tale prince and Rhaegar falling bold and beautiful 'princess'. Rhaegar crowned her the Queen of Love and Beauty the next day. When they saw each-other again about an year later, they eloped to Dorne - thus starting the disaster dominoes that ended a dynasty. 


But looking at this from Rhaegar's perspective - what exactly was he thinking when he decided to elope with Lyanna? Was there any semblance of a plan there? Anyway you cut it, it seems like a monumentally bad idea - something that Rhaegar, of all people, should've been wary of. 


To begin with, as the heir apparent of the kingdom, Rhaegar automatically had the duty to act responsibly and think through the consequences of his actions. Given his father's reputation, this applied to him more than ever. He'd have been under enormous pressure not to seem mercurial and capricious like the Mad King and project the image of calm and cautious individual. He'd already committed the faux-pas of presenting another man's fiance with a crown just 1 year ago - if he was a wise and noble as people seem to think, I can't see him not kicking himself over the lack of judgment and deciding to be more careful in the future. 


Their love-story isn't that compelling either. They met once at the tourney. They had no apparent contact for a whole year. And then they run away together the next time they meet? Sure people can fall madly in love pretty fast, but for 2 otherwise intelligent individuals to go that crazy seems pretty OOC.


But let's assume that they were so madly in love that they just had to be together. What was the logic in running away? Were both of them so high on love that neither stopped to think about a long-term plan? And neither of Rhaegar's best friends try to counsel him? I find that hard to believe. 


So what was the long-term plan? Stay in hiding until the gossip and speculation died out and then come back as a couple with a child in tow? And hope that no one makes a fuss in the meantime? Was Lyanna going to be his royal mistress? 


Or did Rhaegar expect to get married in secret and hope that when he did dare to show his face again, people would simply accept that marriage? That's a pretty stupid plan on its own. The Faith was notoriously against polygamy and even kings haven't been able to defy them. When Maegor wanted a second wife, he couldn't find a Septon to perform the marriage and had his mother marry them in an old Valyrian ceremony. And that marriage resulted in Maegor's exile - Rhaegar had to know that Aerys would jump at the chance of exiling him. 


Even when Targaryen kings and heirs might've benefitted from a second marriage, they never dared to do so. Viserys I, who didn't have any sons, named his daughter as the heir instead of taking a second wife - and he remarried only after his first wife died. Duncan the Small chose to marry a commoner instead of a Baratheon - almost causing a rebellion in the process - and gave up his right to the throne for it - when marrying both might've been a good option. Even Aegon the Unworthy, who hated his wife and son and would've like nothing more than passing the crown to someone else didn't dare take a second wife. Conventions like these aren't easily flouted and Rhaegar would've been a fool to believe that he could claim Lyanna for a wife without much of a problem. 


Or was he so obsessed with producing a 3rd dragon head that he didn't care about honor or custom or even common sense? But if that was the case, there were better ways of accomplishing that - ways that didn't involve slighting the honor of 4 major houses. 


Anyway I look at it, this action seems way too irresponsible and foolish. Even by the standards of irrational, star-crossed lovers, this was pretty stupid. And neither of them seemed like particularly stupid people. Help me out here - what am I missing? Could Rhaegar have had a long term plan that - if Brandon hadn't gone to King's Landing - would've resulted in everything working out nicely?",253,57,False,spoiler,,,,,

- Producers don't want to talk about Arya's storyline. ""Top secret"". No hints on where her storyline is going.  I wonder why? 

In the books, Arya's return to Westeros will give her the opportunity to get involved in politics of the North most likely. 

- Ramsay using her Stark birthright to claim Winterfell.
- The ambiguity in Robb's Will and where she stands in it. 
- She will likely collect Robb's crown from her undead mother who currently has it. Will she crown Jon in Winterfell? Very much like Visenya does her brother Aegon.

The scene(s) where Aria is at the Twins, really is comparing the Lanisters to the Freys. At one point Jaimie tells Walder basically that the Freys are shit and the Lanisters are better. Another way this is shown is Walders interaction with Arya before he dies. Im not sure of the episode but at an earlier time Arya was Tywins cup bearer. He figured out something was off and that she was high-born based on something small like say m'Lord vs My Lord. This shows how smart Tywin is. Cut to Walder asking about the whereabouts of his sons and ""Arya"" says ""My Lord"" 3 times and he never catches on until she spells it out for him. Not saying he should have been able to figure out she was a Stark, even Tywin didn't figure that out, rather that she was not low-born as she was pretending to be. 

Just thought it was cool how the story mirrors itself. Walder having his throat cut mirroring Catlyn from Red Wedding is not new info but it got me thinking of other ways they may have done it. Jaimie's talk about Lannisters being better was really driven home by putting Walder in the same situation as Tywin and watching him miss every sign. (ok not EVERY sign, he realized she wasn't one of his normal girls.)

I have a theory about this scene with Jon Snow and Littlefinger.

Littlefinger is lost, he has no support from Cersei, the north or Sansa anymore. His best play is - to blackmail Jon. He tells him who his parents really are. Jon doesn't believe him at first and gets angry, but after some explaining he sees the truth. Petyr says that if he revieled to the northern lords that his father is not the beloved Eddard Stark, but Rhaegar Targaryen, they would abbandon him as Dakingindanorf.

Perhaps he assumes the Iron Throne with almost the entire country destroyed and vastly unpopulated, but with the White Walkers eventually killed off.

The general consensus is that Littlefinger is manipulating Sansa into feeling jealous about Jon's position which could end in a fight between the two.

My theory, is that Sansa is in fact aware of how dangerous and slimy Littlefinger is and will use his love of her &amp; his arrogance to her advantage. Judging by what Sansa says to Jon about how ""only a fool would trust Littlefinger"" and how much experience Sansa has now, I just cannot see her judgment being clouded by him and nor do I believe she can see him as a true ally.

What I do think, is she sees him as a threat to her own/her &amp; Jon's safety and also a threat to all of Westeros. She will confide her plans in no one and this season GOT will show us a fair few scenes which causes the viewer to doubt the strength of Jon and Sansa's relationship, only to see the demise of Littlefinger by Sansa's hand. Don't forget, he betrayed her father AND gave her over to Ramsay Bolton - some things are not so easily forgiven surely!

He uses diplomacy to resolve the White Walker conflict.**

The Lord of Light is a farce. Valyrian words for gold and hand are aeksion and ondos. Valyrian words for lord and light are aeksio and onos. Could a [translation](https://www.dothraki.org) error have led to the erroneous creation of a religion? Will the true savior be the Gold Hand? Artifacts point to the mistranslation  for instance, the Lord of Lights army is called the Fiery Hand. These kinds of misinterpretations and mistranslations are discussed by Aemon to alert us to look for them. But, whom do we know with a golden hand?

&amp;nbsp;

That's right - Jaime Lannister.

&amp;nbsp;

**Jaime? Seriously?** 

Yeah, seriously. I believe Jaime is Azor Ahai, The Prince That Was Promised, and the Valonqar. These prophecies can all seamlessly refer to Jaime. ASOIAF has followed Jaime/Kingslayer as he has undergone a redemptive transformation. The timeline of events highlights specifically the span of time during which Jaimes events have been relevant to each of these prophecies. For the sake of this discussion, the most important event is the loss of Jaime's hand, beginning his transformative journey. 

I believe Jaime Forges his Heros Sword (as phrased in prophecy) by shedding his Kingslayer persona. In order to rid himself of the Kingslayer he must first lose the symbolic representation of this perceived corruption  his sword hand. Jaime states, [I was that hand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYl5WqBo5nI) directly linking his character to his sword hand. 

When Qybyrn is treating Jaime's stump, he says he is [removing the corruption](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwUYMZyptpE), a potential double meaning. This double meaning is illustrated even more clearly when, in another scene, Qyburn says [""We've stymied the corruption.""](https://youtu.be/W8RXFcFZc24?t=2m40s) Jaime repeats the phrase with emphasis, showing its importance. *That is, while Qyburn has stymied the physical corruption, Jaime repeats the phrase to show us that he has stymied his own corruption.* 

Cersei, too, says [""things change""](https://youtu.be/7QVQR020FFY?t=2m22s) once Jaime loses his hand, calling Jaime's hand a ""rather important part"" of him. Cersei prefers the corrupted Kingslayer persona. Jaime's transformation is undesirable in Cersei's eyes. As a result, she continually interferes in Jaime's redemption. 

So, forging a heros sword is metaphorical for forging a heros character or allowing the hero to surface, being reborn as Jaime. This begins to occur immediately after Jaime loses his sword hand, an event that was set into motion when Jaime selflessly attempted to save Brienne's life. If you recall, in order to be the hero, prophecy states that Jaime must forge his sword three times. I believe this is because with each attempt, his connection to Cersei corrupts him, necessitating multiple ""forgings"". This cycle will eventually lead to the fulfillment of the Valonqar and Nissa Nissa/AA prophecies in the same act  the death of Cersei at the hand of Jaime.

&amp;nbsp;

**The Azor Ahai Prophecy: Forging a Heros Sword:**

If you are unfamiliar, the books discuss a prophesied hero, Azor Ahai, that will save man from the White Walkers. This prophecy is written in three parts, each of which can be explained using events from Jaime's redemption story: 

&amp;nbsp;

*~Part I | The Kingslayer Confession~* 
&gt;He labored for thirty days and thirty nights until it was done. However, when he went to temper it in water, the sword broke. He was not one to give up easily, so he started over.

After Jaime loses his hand, he begins his ascent. His first attempt to shed the Kingslayer occurs when he shares the Aerys story at Harrenhal in the bath with Brienne. He is tempering/testing Jaime in water by confessing the story of the Kingslayer. A sign that we will begin to see a transformation exists in this odd line that appears in book and television [Not so hard, youll rub the skin off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBb3Q8VdYas) may serve as another clue. I believe this is a subtle reference to this first act of change, shedding his skin. 

Jaime proceeds to tell the story of how he saved King's Landing from Aerys. After Jaime completes his confession: 

&gt;The water had grown cool. When Jaime opened his eyes, he found himself staring at the stump of his sword hand. The hand that made me Kingslayer. The goat had robbed him of his glory and his shame, both at once. Leaving what? Who am I now? ASOS, Jaime, CH 37

Jaime subsequently passes out in the bath. u/Cong0 suggests the word ""broken"" can be used to describe Jaime's physical state at this moment. Brienne calls out for help referring to him as Kingslayer but he replies, [My name is Jaime!](https://youtu.be/rBb3Q8VdYas?t=6m30s) an important clue to that which is listed above, emphasizing the opposition of those two constructs. 

What happens after this scene continues the hero story. However, Jaime is corrupted by his love for Cersei. His continual references to the things I do for love is a reminder that he engages in questionable moral behavior for Cerseis sake alone.

Immediately prior to his second redemptive act, Jaime faces the Kingslayer directly by reviewing the [History of the Kingsguard.](https://youtu.be/gBb15PQn-gQ?t=54s) Here, he tells Joffrey ""I still have time"" to do good deeds. The exchange causes him to face his past and desire to ""reforge his sword"" a second time .

&amp;nbsp;

*~Part II |The Tysha Confession~*
&gt;The second time he took fifty days and fifty nights to make the sword, even better than the first. To temper it this time, he captured a lion and drove the sword into its heart, but once more the steel shattered.

Jaimes second attempt to shed the Kingslayer occurs when he defies Tywin and Cersei. He does so by freeing Tyrion from the cells after he is implicated in Joffreys death, he additionally confesses the truth in regard to his role in the Tysha story. Lightbringer imagery may be at play, as we see Jaime [predominantly carrying the torch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr8k0erWT38) in the dungeon.

As soon as Jaime releases Tyrion from prison, Tyrion goes to the Tower of the Hand to confront Tywin. Theres plenty of [lion imagery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SmxvNP58BU) as Tyrion enters the Tower of the Hand. It feels like they're shoving it in our faces, really. Shae even mutters ""My lion."" There's no doubt this is purposeful. However, there are two ways to approach this part of the myth depending on whether we are addressing the TV or book version of events: 

*- - ASOS Version:* If you are not familiar with the books, Tysha was Tyrion's first wife. When Tywin discovered Tyrion was married to Tysha, he had Jaime tell Tyrion that Tysha was not in love, but a paid whore. Tywin then ordered his guards to gang rape Tysha while Tyrion watched. This is a very painful subject for Tyrion. When Jaime releases Tyrion from his cell, Jaime confesses that Tysha was not a whore and Jaime was always aware of this lie. With this confession, Jaime attempts once again to rid himself of the Kingslayer. 

Jaime allowed, even aided in, Tyrion's imprisonment. In this case, Tyrion is the captured lion. Jaime's confession is devastating for Tyrion, and ""drives a sword into the lion's heart"". After Tyrion is released, he finds his current love, Shae, in his father's bed, causing him to kill Tywin. 

*- - TV Version:* In order to simplify events, the show runners chose to account for this prophecy by making Tywin the lion, who is shot in the heart by Tyrion as a result of Jaime's actions. There's an interesting clue in GoT that strengthens the validity of this theory. In ASOS, Tywin is shot once in the gut. However, in GoT, he is struck again - [in the heart.](https://youtu.be/yMoNv6yOSCQ?t=2m40s) There is no reason to include this second shot, except to account for the prophecy. 

Either way you interpret this scene, Jaime didn't kill Tywin directly, right? So, why would he believe it's his fault? How would it impact his ""hero journey?"" 

Theres an important scene where Cersei blames Jaime, and so he blames himself. [Tyrion may be a monster, but at least he killed our father on purpose. You killed him by mistake with stupidity.](https://youtu.be/kUyvoXPcRWE?t=2m). Jaime is told not only he murdered Tywin, but also his sense of moral responsibility caused it.

Due to Cerseis influence, Jaime slips once again into Kingslayer character. Immediately prior to the potential third act, he faces Edmure Tully. Edmure gives a [long, important speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8eDZnqi_Rg) about Jaime and his character. As a result, Jaime states he would launch (Edmures) baby into Riverrun for Cersei. Then, the Freys remind Jaime again of what being the Kingslayer means immediately prior to returning to Kings Landing in S6E10 though the [we are the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiEHdvnEN3A) speech. Both encounters setting the stage for the final act.

&amp;nbsp;

*~Part III | The Rebirth~*
&gt;The third time, with a heavy heart, for he knew before hand what he must do to finish the blade, he worked for a hundred days and nights until it was finished. This time, he called for his wife, Nissa Nissa, and asked her to bare her breast.

After success at Riverrun, Jaime returns to Kings Landing and finds the Sept burned to the ground. Cersei has murdered The Faith Militant, along with many innocent citizens (note: Jaime likely saved the lives of many of these same people when he killed Aerys). Jaime sees Cersei on the throne and [understands that he must kill her](https://youtu.be/1SFlM0ULeAY?t=50s). He knows what he must do to finish the blade. Killing Cersei will finish Jaimes blade by removing her corrupting influence permanently. It's only a matter of time...

In my view, the importance of this event is highlighted by one sign of Azor Ahai revealing itself. The symbol for the Faith Militant is the [red star](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Faith_Militant). Further, each recruit of the Faith Militant is marked with a [red star.](http://winteriscoming.net/files/2015/05/highsparrow.jpg) I believe the ""bleeding red star"" is a reference to the mass death of the Faith Militant which occurred at the Sept of Baelor; a clue is given to us [here.](https://youtu.be/hjtPtTUx_ks?t=40s)

&gt;He drove his sword into her breast, her soul combining with the steel of the sword, creating Lightbringer, while her cry of anguish and ecstasy left a crack across the face of the moon.

Jaime and Cersei have the only relationship fitting of the prophecy. Theirs is a love that has been the focus of the series. No other characters could meet and exhibit a deep, meaningful love in two short seasons. Theories that propose Brienne as Nissa Nissa fall short. Brienne's role is no substitute for Cersei, as Jaime and Brienne's is a relationship of respect and admiration - not profound love. At best, Brienne serves as a role model and catalyst for Jaime's journey. Other theories that cite Jon or Dany and previous deaths of loved ones do not take into account that Lightbringer is prophesized to appear immediately after the death of Nissa Nissa. Theories that cite Jon and Arya fail to understand that Jon has not mentioned or actively searched for Arya. This would be a very strange conclusion - reunion and immediate sacrifice? *The only character that consistently fights and kills for another, all while remaining physically attached to that character for the whole series and refusing to leave their side is Jaime in regard to his dedication to Cersei - this is telling.* 

That being said, just as in the other parts of this myth, I think we should look for more figurative aspects of the prophecy to reveal themselves. Yes, I believe this is describing the death of Cersei, but the details are still hazy. Look for symbolism around baring her breast, combining steel/soul, and moon. 

&amp;nbsp;

**The Valonqar &amp; Nissa Nissa Prophecies**

Another prophecy of ASOIAF is that of the Valonqar. When she was a girl, Cersei Lannister visited Maggy the Frog, who told her that all of her children would die, and that Cersei would die at the hands of the Valonqar. Valonqar is the word for ""little brother"" in High Valyrian. Cersei has long-believed Tyrion to be the Valonqar. However, I believe Jaime is not only the Valonqar, but in the same act he will fulfill the Valonqar and Nissa Nissa prophecies. *Evidence shows that these two prophesies are linked.*

After the deaths of her children, Cersei has openly contemplated whether she could have prevented the their deaths. She wonders if Maggy the Frog's prophesies were accurate. Cersei understands that, if the Valonqar prophecy is true, she could not have changed their fate. If Maggy the Frog's prophecy is true, she would not feel responsible for their deaths.

For this reason, when Cersei realizes Jaime is the Valonqar, she would be in both ""anguish and ecstasy"" in dying due to her understanding that the prophecy holds and her children were marked for death. *Her death will bring her relief, even joy. Who else would be in ecstasy during death?* In my opinion, this fact cohesively links Cersei, Nissa Nissa, &amp; the Valonqar prophecies. 

&amp;nbsp;

**WTF is Lightbringer?**

So... wait - how could Cersei be strangled via the Valonqar prophecy and also be Nissa Nissa and killed by Lightbringer?!? This is purposeful deception. Lightbringer will not be a sword itself, but the return of Jaimes sword hand ablaze. *A fiery hand is Lightbringer.* What was once Jaimes corruption embodied is reborn, the mark of a prophesized hero.  Once the best swordsman in Westeros, Jaime will be whole once again.

One **very** strong piece of visual evidence occurs when Meera asks Jojen, When will we know its the end? and [Jojen replies](https://youtu.be/ozPholpWbCw?t=2m50s) 

After making this post, u/cheep-cheep pointed out this passage of interest that seems to also make direct reference to Jaime's fiery hand:

&gt;His hand burned. 
Still, still, long after they had snuffed out the torch they'd used to sear his bloody stump, days after, he could still feel the fire lancing up his arm, and his fingers twisting in the flames, the fingers he no longer had. --ASOS, Jaime IV

Another passage from A Feast for Crows makes yet another reference: 
&gt;In his dreams Jaime always had two hands; one was made of gold, but it worked just like the other.  --AFFC, Jaime

Recall, too, Tyrion says to Cersei [The day will come when you feel safe and happy, but your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_z_xCWVLXk) This comment makes it seem as if the two will never meet again. Could it be that Tyrion dies before Cersei, so Cersei believes she has avoided the prophecy? Perhaps she feels ""safe"" because she believes she will not die at the hand of the Valonqar. Then, when Jaime strangles her with a the fiery hand, it will literally leaves ashes in her mouth? This, too, is another piece of evidence linking Cersei, Valonqar and Nissa Nissa prophesies. 

Don't forget, Cersei points out how cold Jaimes new hand is.

&amp;nbsp;

**General Thoughts:** 

Jaime is the hero. He displays a pattern of putting others before himself. Jaime is known for saving Kings Landing from the Mad King Aerys, but not for the throne or recognition. In fact, he suffers for his deed. Jaime routinely preserves life and avoids conflict - even at Riverrun. 

Riverrun (when compared to Dragons Bay and Battle of the Bastards) is a peaceful resolution. As much as I enjoyed those conflicts from a purely aesthetic perspective, I think theres a reason they occurred at the same time  we can see the leadership styles directly compared among Jaime, Jon, and Dany. Jaime is a champion for all, unlike Dany or Jon, who brutally kill those that oppose them. IMO, Jaime is a leader and a warrior that is not motivated by his own greed for power, land, etc. and is much more hesitant to engage in violent action. 

We also know the White Walkers are capable of negotiation and peace - remember Craster and his deal to provide male children in return for peace with the White Walkers? *Perhaps this is how Jaime will resolve the conflict with the White Walkers - through diplomacy.* I firmly believe GRRM will not end the story with war being the ultimate resolve. Diplomacy and peace will be the answer. 

GRRM discusses the major theme as conflict of the human heart and that war sucks  this is Jaimes story. Its still a bit of an archetypal Messiah story but with a unique twist. What could be more painful than sacrificing oneself? Sacrificing a loved one that you consider to be a part of yourself. Your twin and one true love. 

The hero being the hero all along is boring. Redemption and growth are interesting. Lannisters arent evil because theyre Lannisters; Starks arent good because theyre Starks. Anyone is redeemable and/or corruptible. So, maybe our unlikely hero will save Westeros from the White Walkers with his fiery hand ablaze. At it's conclusion, then, we will have our song of ice and fire.

&amp;nbsp;

**Super Tinfoil &amp; Unlikely Bonus Theory:** 

I think this theory would be extra cool if Bran was destined for alliance with The Others. Ice/Fire, Bran/Jaime. The story would mimic its beginning, a conflict between these two. But, ultimately, Bran is corrupted as a ""hero for the other side"" and Jaime is the traditional hero. In S1E1, Jaime and Cersei are in the tower, Jaime appears to wrap his hand around Cerseis throat, Bran catches them in the act so Jaime pushes him. Jaime chokes Cersei, Bran flies. Perhaps we will see some mirror of this occur in the finale?

**Notes:**

After writing this post, u/The_Onion_Knight_ commented about a blog that highlights GRRM's heavy use of Norse Mythology. According to [the blog,](http://gameofthronesandnorsemythology.blogspot.it/2013/05/jaime-azor-ahai-god-of-war.html) *""Jaime is the only possible candidate for ""Azor Ahai"". Why is that? Because he represents Tyr -- the one-handed god of war -- the champion of mankind.""* This post ties the loss of Jaime's hand to his virtue - really interesting.

Nothing past that.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/6e0d5k/everything_i_think_the_trailer_for_season_7_only/,Iliketaytos,1496065727,"At first I thought it was showing footage for the first few or several episodes (Like what the trailer did for season 6) but now that I think about it I think that S7E01 will cover everything shown in this trailer or at least most of it.

Probability of everything happening in the first episode. 

- Cersei plotting her defence: Definitely 

- Dany arriving at Dragonstone: Hell yes, no doubt.

- The mountain getting new armour: Of course.

- Arya travelling North: Yes

- Jorah trapt in a cell: Maybe? 50:50

- The massive ship battle: Most likely 90%

- Tyrion and the dragons outside of Dragonstone: Definitely

- Arya looking for something: Yeah most likely.

- The battle between Drogon and the dothraki horde against Lannister army: This may be the only thing that doesn't happen in the first episode. Unlikely.

- Unsullied attack on Casterly Rock: Most likely. Won't be a huge battle.

- Yara + Elaria and Greyworm + Missandei: Doesn't really matter when it happens but probably within the first episode before the treat of the ww army takes place.

- Jon leaving Winterfell and going beyond the wall: Most likely 90%

- LF talking to Sansa and plotting against Jon: I would say Definitely

- Lannister army in all of their glory: Most likely preparing for the battle in S7E02.

- Davos talking to Dany about the WW treat: Most likely if not certain.

- Cersei looking mad asf saying that ''we are the last lannisters'': Most likely 90%

The trailer literally didn't show 1 wight or white walker so I don't think the trailer shown anything past S7E02.

EDIT: Some people don't believe that it will move that fast but remember Season 6? Characters were literally teleporting from continent to continent. Season 7 pace will be even faster, much faster than season 6. Source: http://ew.com/tv/2017/05/23/game-of-thrones-season-7-pace/

EDIT 2: Okay so I'll change two major things. I'll move the dothraki army + Drogon vs. Lannisters from episode 2 to episode 3. Lastly I will reposition the battle of casterly rock from episode 1 to episode 2. I stand by everything else though.

EDIT 3: I am basing all of this one one sole reason. Winter is here yet the only places with snow are winterfell, beyond the wall and wherever Arya is. We don't know where Arya is but she must be somehwere in the North. The riverlands should be the next place snow hits (The vale at the same time maybe) then later it should hitcasterly rock, probably by episode 3/4. I'd say Kings Landing will have snow in the season finale. The trailer showed fuck all snow so this is why I believe that 85% of the trailer takes place in the first 2 episodes.

Catelyn's hatred and mistreatment of Jon was rooted in him being a bastard. He represented not only Ned's infidelity, but also a potential threat to her children in case Ned pulled an Aegon and legitimized him. Even so, she wasn't irrational or cruel. Since the other children all loved Jon, I have to assume that she atleast tried to keep her attitude towards him in check. Had Ned told her the truth, she might've actually come to love and care for him. 

It couldn't be that he was worried about her blabbing, right? Perhaps he couldn't have trusted her in the beginning, but over time Catelyn had proven herself to be smart and capable. And she'd have definitely understood the enormity of the situation and importance of never talking about it again. 

Or was it simply because he promised Lyanna to keep it a secret? That seems like a case of following the letter over the spirit. The promise to keep it a secret was to ensure Jon's safety and I'm pretty sure that had Lyanna lived, she'd have been okay with sharing the secret with Cat. Prioritizing the words of the promise over the happiness and well-being of both Cat and Jon doesn't seem like a well-thought out decision.

What I saw was that she closes her eyes and makes the room completely dark so that both of them could not really see well. In the beginning of the season, Arya is blind and she is learning how to fight blind. Specifically, she is learning how to fight the Waif blind. The Waif on the other hand is fighting Arya, seeing all of her moves. Arya knows that she is no match for the Waif while both of them can see each other, so what she does is lead the Waif to the hiding place on purpose and cut the candle with Needle creating darkness, She is doing this because Arya learned all of the Waif's moves and learned how to fight her blind.

What if the Azor Ahai (Jon) will somehow wake the volcano (a sacrifice maybe)? From the sacrifice Lightbringer will be born, it is a sword? Or a volcano? 

The volcano goes off, the darkness flees before it. Lightbringer is born. 

(More thoughts: it would explain how KL gets destroyed by fire. Not by dragons but by volcanic bombs and ash raining down on KL which is just across the water from DS. Cersei gets caught up in it and burnt. She is still alive when Jaime finds her but she is so badly injured she can't move so Jaime kills her out of mercy.)

2754,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2017-5-30,2017,5,30,1,6e12or,self.gameofthrones,[Main Spoilers] A link between the nursery rhyme: London Bridge is Falling Down and The Wall,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/6e12or/main_spoilers_a_link_between_the_nursery_rhyme/,raiigiic,1496073798,"There are multiple theories regarding the origin of the London Bridge is Falling Down nursery rhyme, ranging from a Viking attack (white walkers) to the great fires of London (dragons).

Many structures, throughout history, and suggested through the finding of skeletons, were built with sacrifices to please the gods. This may have occurred to ensure that these buildings will not crumble or fall. One theory regarding the nursery rhyme is that it was built with children sacrifices or virgin entombments. Perhaps this immurement may have been the process for the original building of the wall? Perhaps, Bran, the Builder buried and sacrificed others to ensure the Wall would never come down? It is said that Bran the Builder enlisted the support of the Children of the Forest to build the wall, perhaps he buried them within it? This leads us to the question of, what do the builders of the present do to support the wall? Are they repairing it with bricks and mortar? And is this leading to its weakness? Perhaps.

A second theory is that the rhyme is supported by the great fires of London, at this point I would like to acknowledge that the original London Bridge had 19 arches, and the wall has 19 battlements/castles. The great fires of London occurred within a short time span, the first resulted in major damage to the building, whilst the second acted as a firebreak against the southern regions. Ive not really got a lot to say here as im struggling to link this to the wall aside from the 19 arches/ 19 castles. May it relate to there being 2 attacks on the wall? One which severely damages it (perhaps this was the previous attack by the wildlings), and the second attack will come from the walkers, but Jon Snow and his legion will defeat them?

The final theory I wish to highlight is the myth regarding the identity of the fair ladies. Many theories have been suggested, however, I would like to link Eleanor of Provence to Cersei Lannister. Eleanor of Provence was a lady who married the king and eventually became queen regent of England. This lead to hatred of her from the citizens due to a Queens Gold tax. Eventually, she became so unpopular that she was attacked ruthlessly, and later, when the bridge was crumbling, and she refused to support or rebuild it, the nursery rhyme was forged as a jab at the Queen. Perhaps, most interestingly are linking this to the first theory, in that the citizens actually wanted to use the my fair lady as the sacrifice in the bridge. Now, Cersei is clearly hated. Perhaps, as queen, she will win and secure kings landing against Dany prior to the wall coming down. Then the wall comes down, and she ignores it. And whilst Dany and Jon fight to beat the walkers, she ignores the wall and refuses to help whilst the citizens continue to revolt, leading to increased support for Dany/Jon.

Other similarities lay in the final few verses of the rhyme, which reads as follows:

*Set a man to watch all night, 
Watch all night, watch all night, 
Set a man to watch all night, 
My fair lady*

There is a clear synonym of the nights watch and setting a man to watch all night to ensure that the bridge does not fall. And that is where I shall leave this theory; please give me views or any advances/ criticisms you may have.

**TLDR; The London Bridge is falling down nursery rhyme has many theories surrounding its origin including the identity of my fair lady, the relation to a Viking attack, and to that of immurement and sacrifice. Cersei is my fair lady, the wall is built with the children of the forest as living sacrifices within the tomb, and the Viking attack is like that of the white walkers**",2,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

We see her in the throne room with the ceiling destroyed, ash/snow falling from the roof. 

This is after she has taken kings landing. I think Cercei has blown it up with wildfire and not the dragons. 

We see her about to touch the throne but she hears the sound of her dragons calling for her and leaves the throne and ends up at the wall. 

This is her leaving the throne to fight against the White Walkers. I think she will actually leave someone else in charge for her to fight against the whites. Maybe the main reason she does so is because one of her dragons has been turned into an ice dragon. 

Finally she sees a tent in the middle of the snow. She goes inside and it is suddenly sunny, Khal Drogo and her dead child are there.

To me this means she will die in battle against the White Walkers.

To me it's very obvious how her song will end and her song will truly be of fire and ice if you see it from start to finish.

The Night King.  Just some food for thought.  I do not really see the benefits as it would be pretty anticlimatic to worg into the Night King and off himself or something.

She tells Gendry that they ""are just foot soldiers in the great war but you will make kings rise and fall.""  I see this as foreshadowing that Beric, Thoros, and The Hound will be ""foot soldiers"" in the war against the White Walkers.  I think that Gendry's ability to make kings rise and fall has not come into play yet (his blood really didn't do anything).

This post is about how Ned and Lyanna regarded him as unworthy of his trust. 

Putting aside the ""Promise"" and looking at it from character perspective, Ned and Lyanna's distrust of Robert at that point makes sense. Lyanna knew him to be hot-headed and stubborn and she was a dying mother worried for her child. Her conclusion that Robert would kill Jon on sight makes sense. 

Ned always held his best friend in a higher regard than Lyanna. Before the war, he'd have probably said that Robert would never do such a thing. But Robert was relieved when he saw the dead Targaryen babes. And he refused to punish the perpetrators of this horrific act. And later, he sent Stannis to Dragonstone to kill Viserys and Danaerys. Clearly, Ned figured that Robert was not the man he thought he was and Jon's safety lied in secrecy. 

But this is a question for the viewers: Were they correct in their assessment? Or did they misjudge their friend, albeit with good reason? I can see good arguments for both side. 

Suppose Robert finds out the secret one day. Maybe he is dining with Ned or Howland Reed and they drink too much and let it slip. Or maybe one of the women who delivered Jon ends up Robert's bed and inadvertantly reveals it. Or maybe he hears something from the Daynes and figures it out after a lot of sleuthing. At this point, Robert still thinks that Lyanna was kidnapped and raped - she just ended up having a child because of that rape and Ned wanted to protect him regardless, because he was his blood. Would he have ordered Jon killed or would he have spared him?

Arguments for killed:

1) Robert hated all Targs on principle. Anyone with Targ blood must die. 

2) Just as Cat saw Jon as a symbol of Ned's infidelity and hated him for it, Robert could've seen him as a symbol of his loss and hated him. 

3) Jon maybe being kept a secret now, but you never know when he'd proclaim his heraldry and become a threat. 

4) Ned knew that when Robert found out about Cersei and her kids, he'd kill them all. The same hot-headed nature could apply here - Lyanna was his woman who had another man's child. Robert may not care about anything else. 

5) Despite passage of years, he was still obsessed with killing Dany and Viserys. The same would go for Jon.


Arguments for spared:

1) Aemon Targaryen still lives at the Wall - clearly Robert is not obsessed with finding and killing every Targaryen. 

2) Legitimate Targs looking for an army to reclaim the kingdom - that's a real threat. A bastard unaware of his own heritage? Not so much. 

3) Robert would care enough about Ned and his relation to the boy to consider it twice. 

4) On his deathbed, Robert rescinded the order to kill Dany - meaning he is capable of being the better man. 

5) Jon is more Stark than Targaryen. Seeing him might have the opposite effect - instead of being reminded of Rhaegar and what he took from him, Robert might be reminded of Lyanna and the love he had for her. He might see Jon as the last piece of Lyanna left. After all, the main reason for his hatred for Targs was that they took Lyanna and here is a piece of her back. 

6) Demanding the life of innocent children for the sins of their father - that's how Robert started his rebellion. A capricious move like this would not be in his best interest. 

7) He'd also be alienating his staunchest ally and most beloved friend. And this would be irrevocable. Far worse than killing a girl Ned had no relation to. 


All in all, I find reasons for sparing to be more compelling than reasons for killing. And though Robert Baratheon is no bastion of rationality, I think he is a decent enough guy to make the right choice here and leave Jon alone. 

Are there any other points I've missed? Which side do you find more compelling and why?

Now listen, like majority of people I hate LittleFinger but I kind of felt bad for him here. I felt like he was kind of ripped off just as how Tyrion was ripped off at the end of season 2. Did anybody actually appreciate LittleFinger saving the day at the Battle of the Bastards? Do you think thats going to happen in season 7?


That brings me to my point. Why did LittleFinger save everyone? Did he go through all that trouble of gaining power in the Vale and stealing the command of the knights of the Vale just to go back to where he was seasons ago? Just hiding in the corner and trying to manipulate people in power and waiting for an opportunity to get a raise? 


I know it would have been really anti climatic and against what any of the viewers would have wanted to see but wouldn't it have been much more in character if LittleFinger had wasted a bit more time till Jon's army was fully crushed and he himself had died and then went in to claim the victory? Who was going to stop him from doing that? Sansa?! You might say well how could he tell if Jon had died? Well he could have just simply ordered his huge army to kill just anyone that remained alive?


After all wasn't this his original plan regarding the North? The one he told Cersei about? I'm going to wait till Boltons and Stannis have fought then I'm going to go in with my knights of the Vale and take over? Then why didn't he just do the same thing here? Cersei was not in power anymore, thats true, but LittleFinger himself was still known as a true friend of the Crown for all his services and there was a good chance he was going to get the same prize from Kevan Lannister that Cersei had promised him, The North!

Now that i got that out of the way let's get started and that is my theory for Arya Stark for next season. So anyways i think she will start to leave her assassin ways (my take a break or straight up abandon her list) and start to return to her routes which of course house Stark. Yes i think she will return to her stark routes and be reminded of who she is hell in the pics her new outfit is channeling her father with her hair looking like her fathers.

Though i do not think this is just yet she will of course have conflict with herself. Weather being her family was a good idea or she can never go back and will always be a killer. I also think that there will be a test to prove NOT an actual test but a metaphorical test and she will fight an embodiment of everything she could've became if she stayed on the path of becoming No One. Now how she could do this well four ways:

1. Nightmare sequence

2. Shadow Demon takes the form of Arya

3. The Waif is brought back by Jaqen but instead of putting her old face on she puts Arya's face on the body when she resurrects her.

4. Cersei seeing her odds lowered calls to the faceless men to take care of the Targaryens Jaqen however will only do it if she gives a name (of course) and does a favor....That Favor sense Arya will not want to rejoin the faceless men anytime soon he will ask that Qyburn brings back The Waif but has Arya's face on her instead of the Waif's actual face. So Basically Zombie Waif wearing Arya face but something goes wrong and she instead goes after Arya where we see Arya fight an embodiment of every she could've been if she stayed with the faceless men (in the form of Zombie Waif wearing a face of Arya)  ",8,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

I haven't seen this theory anywhere, so if it was already discussed here, forgive me. **Also, if you haven't seen season 6, there are spoilers below.**

There seems to be a lot of confusion surrounding Arya when she was stabbed by the waif. For me there is no confusion. She was being protected by the old gods who must have a plan for her and who definitely favors Arya. She was always protected by them.

Right before Arya got her vision back, she was praying to the god of the north. It seems like they made a point of showing that god (the face from the weirwood trees) then scanning down to Arya. Right after that, she survived a drink that should have killed her. In the scope of this universe, it's no stretch of the imagination to think that magic (or gods) that could bring people back from the dead and prevent Arya from dying from a poisonous drink could also protect her from dying from stab wounds.

I also have no doubt that Arya truly wasn't no one, even if she tried to fool herself, Jaqen and the waif. I don't think she fooled Jaqen either, but he left her fate to the Gods. And he let her go, because it had to be obvious to him that the gods did favor her. He did promise Arya to teach her skills that would let her scratch off all the names on her list. And she learned those skills. Went through a lot to earn them too.

I also feel that's what made the waif go out of her way to hate Arya. Arya was not like any of the other faceless men^^women? and was able to get away with and do things that the other faceless men can't. Like remain stubborn and question things for one. That must have pissed the waif off to no end. Arya can never be no one, it's not in her character.

Seriously how many girls could run around Westeros and go to Bravos and not be raped and/or killed? And still keep a good sense of justice and honor? Arya might feel like a BAMF, but she has help too. From humans and gods.

The most obvious way the showrunners depict this is when a life is spared and another must die for that spared life. That's the order, spared life of one leads to death of another. 

My question is, what if the Faceless God works in a more subtle way that has been clouded in the Lord of Light narrative? Essentially, a reversal of the order. The unjust death (or death) of in the name of the lord of light (burning them at the pyre) gives the priest or priestess the ability to bring back another from death (humor me for a second, I'm still working through this). Shireen dies in a fire to further the vision of the Lord of light. Melisandre goes to the Wall because the Stannis battle is doomed. Jon is resurrected. Shireen died when she shouldn't have and a debt was owed, the balance was off. A day or two later, Jon dies. Melisandre is able to bring him back to restore the balance. Life pays for death and death pays for life.

I know one retort is that Thoros has brought back Beric multiple times presumably without burning anyone alive. However, shortly after Beric is tasked by Ned to take down Gregor Clegane, Melisandre enters the show and starts burning Stannis' relatives and other non-believers. Banking a lot of death/life debt for Thoros to cash in on to save Beric and Lady Stoneheart.

I've never seen another character introduced by their father AND mother's house name, yet they introduce the king in this manner.

It is taken that Jamie (The Fingers) will literally strangle Cersei (The Neck). I think the prophecy may be more symbolic.

I think that Cersei will march her forces north to meet the northern army as they are probably viewed as the biggest threat. She will send Jamie to the Vale to gather their allies (Littlefinger and Sweet Robin who she thinks are still under her thumb) as she marches her main force into The Neck. Jamie will find that the Vale forces have already gone North to join forces with, and rescue Jon Snow. He will realize that the last powerful ally of the Crown has joined the enemy. Jamie will finally accept that defeat is inevitable. He will make the decision to turn cloak and dedicate his personal forces to usurp the crown from his sister.

Jamie will send messengers to the northern forces to inform them that he will be marching his forces to the south of Cersei's to block her supply lines and her retreat. Stuck in the bogs of the neck, Cersei will have no options. Starving soldiers being picked off by the crannogmen, a large force to the north, her own brother to the south, and massive dragons flying overhead. 

&gt; And when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you.

How can she be choked to death after she's already been drowned? *Unless*... ^^^What ^^^is ^^^dead ^^^may ^^^never ^^^die. 
Cersei suffer death by drowning in the waters of the neck and be lost to history. Her position in the neck choked in a strategic move by her own brother. *The Valonqar*.

Total screen time including the intro and credit scenes came to 55h 43m 28s, up to season 6. If we are being generous and assuming that indeed all episodes in season 7 and in season 8 will be an hour long, then after season 8 the total screen time will be 68h 43m 28s, this is considerably lower than 73h stated, (5.86% lower to be exact).

To me this means one of five things:

- They meant to say 73 episodes rather than 73 hours. (boring)

- They intend to make episodes in season 7 and season 8 much longer than usual. (hype)

- They made a mistake. (About as unlikely as Aegon V)

- Maybe there will be a season 9 with 5 episodes?! (hype)

- CLEGANE BOWL, WHAT IS HYPE MAY NEVER DIE

Just some fun facts before you leave :D

- You have spent 108 minutes watching the game of thrones introduction (so far)

- Season 6 was the longest season

- Season 2 was the shortest season (by about 10 minutes)

- S06E01 was the shortest episode

- Antartica doesn't have a timezone.

&gt; ""He moved like a **panther**, and that ugly **sword** of his seemed a part of his arm."" *-Catelyn AGOT*

A Panther is clearly ""a cat of a different coat"", and a lion still has claws, an ugly sword is still a sword ""as long and sharp as yours"". The Rains of Castamere. Which Bronn is known for singing before the blackwater.
Bronn is introduced as an enemy of Tyrion, but quickly learns that is a wealthy traveling companion. The Reynes were once the second wealthiest families in Westeros, and fought Tywin for that honor. Which explains Bronn's endless greed for more money and land from both Jaimie and Tyrion. When Jaime tells Bronn he will have ""a more beautiful bride and a much bigger castle"", he may be referencing Castamere which was known to mimic the looks of Casterly Rock.

Seeing how Ollena has nothing to lose (Thanks to Cersei) there should be no reason for Ollena to keep her dirty little secret. 

Olena and LF both plotted to kill Joffrey which they succeeded in. The only other person that knows of this murder is Sansa (?)

Imagine that scene between the two of them. The moment when Cersei realises that Olena was the cause of her downfall. The moment Joffrey died, everything turned to shit for Cersei.

The two amazing actors would pull it off perfectly. I desperately want this scene to happen.

And imagine what this would mean for Tyrion? Would Cersei try and make a mends with Tyrion? Would Tyrion rejoin the Lannister family? Would Tyrion serve as the hand of the Queen for a different Queen? Obviously this is very unlikely because Cersei always hated Tyrion and everyone knows that Tyrion killed Tywin. 

It's funny how this plot line has been overlooked and even forgotten about my some. Hell I even forgot about it. Joffrey died nearly 3-4 seasons ago and yet nobody is sure who killed him.

It is a political drama, a fantasy epic, a coming of age story, a thriller, a war story, and so much more. 

Having said that, the thing that defined the show the most was the political aspect. We all watched all these characters play the game of thrones, rooting or crying for our favorite characters. 

The fantasy aspects of the show, revolved mostly around Jon, Bran, and Dany. These three characters' stories were, for the most part, isolated from the rest of the show. This had the effect of making all of the fantastical aspects(i.e. Dragons, Wights, Three Eyed Raven) of the show seem completely disconnected from the other stories. 

In that sense, it was almost like we had two different shows that happened to share a world. In my opinion, Season 6 served as a way to bridge the gap between the two main 'aspects' of the show. Going into Season 7; Jon, Dany, and Bran will join the rest of the world and thus bring all the fantasy aspects of the show for the rest of the characters to contend with. 

The consequence of that is that the political drama aspect of the show will now take a back seat, and the fantasy aspects of the show will become the main driver. Of course we all instinctively knew this, with all the foreshadowing about the 'Great War' between the living and the dead.

The whole point of this post is just to praise the show in its ability to juggle genres like it does. Not only that, but the fact that the show is transforming itself right in front of our eyes. That is amazing. 

For comparison, take another political drama like House of Cards. If a show like that all of the sudden became a political satire like VEEP, people would lose their minds. GoT was able to make the switch from political drama to fantasy epic because the aspects for both were always there, and so well integrated.

**The Mountain vs The Red Woman**

Ofcourse, they wouldn't face each other in the arena. Let's say Ser Robert Strong is sent on a solo mission to find and kill the priestess, while Melisandre wants to kill the undead monstrosity. Mouontain has strength, but not the smarts. Mel has some magic, some shape-shifting and some fire-powers, which could work on him. She also gets visions of all the threats to her person. Who makes it out alive


**The Mountain vs The Faceless Girl**
Once again, not a straight up fight. Arya is in KL to cross the Mountain off her list. And he simply knows that someone would be trying to kill him. Arya has her face-changing skills, her spy-craft and her knowledge of poisons. The Mountain is always in his armor and doesn't eat or poop. Who gets the other one first?


**The Red Woman vs The Faceless Girl**
The Witch is back on Arya's list and she gets a vision of a faceless girl making an attempt on her life. Both have the ability to change their appearance. Mel has magic, her ruby choker and random visions of the future. Arya has keen observation, knowledge of poisons and is better with a sword than Mel. Who survives?


**The Mountain vs The White-Walker**
This is the most straight-up fight of them all. A trial by combat, if you will.

The Whitewalkers are much faster and stronger than regular men - one easily threw Sam several feet and the other casually side-stepped all of a Thenn's attacks. Their weapons shatter regular steel easily and that likely includes all armor. And its implied that if they manage to stab you, their weapon would freeze your blood and kill you. Their biggest weakness seems to be over-confidence and PIS - which we'd do away with here. The Walker here won't walk slowly with his back to the enemy. He won't play around with his victim. He won't be too shocked to move when an attack is blocked. 

The Mountain is definitely stronger, but not that fast. He has his usual armor here but he is given a Valyrian steel sword and only needs to land one good hit. If he doesn't have proper blood-flow, it might take more than 1 hit from the Walker Weapon to kill him. 

Who prevails here? ",4,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I'm about halfway through season six, and it's become a struggle to get through every one of her appearances.

I don't even despise her for being rotten, rather I'm just sick of her for being stupid. It seems like every single thing she has said for the entire show's tenure has been wrong. She almost brought the kingdom to its knees single handed. I'm genuinely surprised not one other person has told her the minute she starts speaking to just stop. Nobody has informed her of how much ""bad everything"" seems to occur when she opens her mouth.

I feel bad for Tommen, who has no idea she's responsible for the religious fanatics now running rampant.

We know she used a large amount to blow up the sept but do we know is she used all of it?

My thinking is that the threat of using Wildfire on the general population of Kings Landing again is going to be the main thing stopping the people from overthrowing her. They've hated her and her family for a while now and were rioting even before the recent events and after the sept, they must hate her even more. Firstly because they loved the Tyrells. Kings Landing was starving before the Tyrells showed up with their food. The people also loved Queen Margery for her charitable actions. Secondly because the people also liked the Sparrows it seems. I know that the general Game of Thrones audience didn't but the Sparrows were handing out food to the poor and were making the rich see justice for their crimes, something practically unheard of. Before the Sparrows the rich could get away with whatever they pleased while screwing over the poor. That would definitely breed some resentment. Add that to all the rumours surrounding Cersei and Jaime I can't imagine they'd hate anyone more than her.

So my point is that the people must hate her with a burning passion at this point. The only thing stopping them from rioting again, and this time more so, I'd suspect is the fear of being blown up by Wildfire. So is this a bluff from Cersei because she used it all on the sept? Or does she have enough to kill many thousands more in Kings Landing or even a certain invading army?

(Ahem. Don't look at my posting history.)  I love this sub, and I love reading the analysis and theories of fans more eagle-eyed and obsessed than I, but overwhelmingly, everyone seems to loathe Sansa Stark.  

And here's my defense of why her character arc is arguably one of the best in the entire show (tied with Jaime, my other fav).  And guys, this is kinda long so I'll put my TL;DR here for you. Sansa doesn't deserve the hate she gets.

**Sansa is the most normal character in the entire show.**  When we first meet Sansa, she's everything we hate in teenagers today (and everything most of us were when we were 13).  She's dreamy. She's in love with the idea of being a princess.  She believes in stories and fairy tales, and she dreams of having her own happy ending. She is exactly the person she was raised to be on the surface--desperate to be the lady her mother is.  But then she's also the worst part of teenagers--she's bratty. She fights with her sister. She's rude to her father. She's disdainful of anything that doesn't fit the carefully cultivated worldview that's been drilled into her. (Jon being a bastard. Arya not being a lady.)

She has no special skills that are seen as ""cool"" in this world. She can't fight. She has no aspirations of ruling or fighting or rebelling. She's just a normal teenage girl.

Honestly, she is the most like us. Idk about you guys, but I have no special skills that would help me survive in Westeros. I'm a product of my environment. I've been taught that people should behave a certain way. Most of us aren't born from the womb fighting against the power and bucking all expectations placed on us. We want to be liked. We try to see the best in people. We are raised on a diet of Disney movies and happy endings, and we want to fall in love and raise families and live comfortably.  S

**Why Sansa's Dreams are Valid.** I think another reason why people disliked Sansa is because her dreams are so...girly.  She doesn't dream of conquering the world like Dany. She doesn't dream of adventure like her sister. She doesn't dream of bucking social conventions like Brienne. She doesn't dream of seizing power like Cersei.  Her dream is...to be married to a prince and be a lady like her mother.

A bit of a personal anecdote here (and why I might identify with Sansa so strongly):  I didn't have the most fun family life growing up, and by the time I was in college, I dreamed of having my own family. I wanted a husband and kids and I wanted to create the Leave it to Beaver-esque scenario I felt like I'd been denied. I wanted to bake cookies for my children and write a cute note for my husband's lunch.  I didn't want to be a CEO or famous or get my doctorate.  I once admitted this to a fellow classmate, and she sighed and looked at me and said, ""You are a feminist's worst nightmare.""  ...seriously?  Isn't one of the great things about feminism is the idea that women are able to live whatever kind of life they choose? 

Just because someone's dreams aren't ""cool"" or subversive or grandiose doesn't mean they aren't valid. 

**Her first fuck up.** Usually the first reason I hear people say they hate Sansa is that she lied to the King about the situation with Arya and Joffrey.  This always baffles me.  She was a thirteen year old girl who was on the verge of having all her dreams come true, and she was terrified not only of the anger in the room, but of losing everything she ever wanted. She had no clue about the bigger political game being played between Cersei and her father, and so she fell back on the skills she'd been taught her entire life--just try to make everyone happy. If she sided with Arya, she'd endanger an alliance between her family and the King's. If she sided with Joffrey, she'd betray her sister and lie--something that a Lady would never do.

And let's be real, she's paid for this transgression multiple times over. Even if it was only Lady  being killed, I think that'd be enough for trying to make everyone happy.  But, no, we all know this gets worse. 

(And actually, let's talk about her reaction to that scene. For the first time, she sees that Cersei might not be the kind, gentle lady she was supposed to be. And Sansa loses it.  The thought of an innocent creature being punished--a creature under her care--results in her totally losing her sense of decorum in front of all the people she was desperate to impress.)

**Ned's Head.** When people tell me they hate Sansa, they usually will also say that it's her fault her father died. If she hadn't told Cersei/begged her father to confess/trusted the wrong people--maybe Ned would still have his head.

Again, we have a child who is thrust into a political game bigger than herself.  She's been raised that all lords and ladies are kind and noble and honorable, and she's sure if she does what she was told the right thing is, her father and family could be saved.

And once she follows all the steps and is sure she's saved her father, she is forced to watch him be brutally murdered.  At least Arya was held in comforting arms and made to look away.  Sansa was held in place and forced to watch.  I wonder if she felt an echo of Lady's death here--once again, she'd tried to do the right thing and someone innocent was butchered.

**Time with Joffrey.**  Her father is dead.  Her septa is dead.  Her sister is presumed dead.  Sansa is completely alone now in the midst of the people who destroyed her life.  Not only did her dreams not come true, but the same prince she'd dreamed of has become her worst enemy.

What would have been the cool option here?  Maybe Sansa learns to fight.  Maybe she escapes.  Maybe she shoves Joffrey off the side of the castle and then throws herself off after him.

But once again, Sansa does what most normal people would do in a hostage situation.  She just tries to survive.  And she does it the only way she knows how--shrouded in politeness and courtesy.

I don't need to rehash the details of her time with Joffrey, but this is a girl who has lived through the worst thing a child can face, and she survives.  (And during this time, she doesn't just have to survive Joffrey.  She's nearly raped by a mob, which might be more terrifying than getting slapped in the face. And then the first people who seem truly kind to her, the Tyrells, use her as an instrument to murder the King and expose her to a potentially horrific death.)

It's also worth noting that at this point, her strength is recognized by one of the smartest survivors in the game--Tyrion.  

(Also, I loved that despite her constant terror of abuse, she sees an innocent creature she might be able to save in Ser Dontos.  She doesn't do this for any other reason than she knows it's the right thing to do.  Displays of decency and honor seem rare in this world, and I loved her for this.)

**Time with Littlefinger.**  Finally, she's away from King's Landing and with someone she feels will keep her safe.... and then he hits on her and then her aunt tries to actually kill her.  (Which is not an easy thing to deal with at all -- Sansa thinks most of her family is dead and gone and she will never see them again, only to encounter her aunt...who actually tries to murder her.)

Then this guy who keeps telling her he can trust her brokers a marriage to Ramsay.

**Time with Ramsay.**  Until this point, Sansa's been abused and manipulated and terrorized, and as we know, it all gets much worse.  And yet, she survives and isn't broken.

**Season Six.**  By this point, most people can acknowledge that if nothing else, Sansa is a survivor and while they still say she's annoying, they usually admit that she is strong.  But then they dissolve into a plethora of accusations with Season Six.  Sansa didn't tell Jon about the Knights of the Vale.  Sansa is plotting with Littlefinger to take Jon down.  Sansa wants to rule in the North.

Let's tackle these one by one.

*Knights of the Vale - At this point in her life, every good thing Sansa has ever hoped for has turned out completely the opposite. Why offer her brother false hope at salvation? He might have waited, and then Ramsay holes up in Winterfell and Jon's army falls apart during the siege.  I'm obviously not honed in the art of war, but I think about this in terms of money.  Your family owes thousands of dollars in debt, and your house is about to be foreclosed on.  You go to the judge to plead your case.  Why say, ""Hey, FYI, I played the lottery last night and that might save us?""  I can see why she kept quiet.  Nothing had ever gone right for her, so why give Jon false hope?  Hindsight is 20/20 here.  Jon makes an emotional decision to charge and essentially dooms his entire army...and he is praised for his bravery.  Sansa tries to make the smart, calculated decision (that ultimately pays off), but she is derided for keeping it to herself.  

*Plotting with Littlefinger - Sansa has seen LF's true colors in giving her to Ramsay. She's become jaded to the point where she trusts no one and is completely realistic about her world.  Gone is this idealistic little girl who believed the best about everyone.  But, at this point in her life, the only person she knows would never harm her is Jon.  She's never shown a hint of evil in the entire series, so having her suddenly plot with LF to take down one of her only remaining family members is completely out of character.  I know a lot of people reference that look she shares with LF during the King of the North scene, but I read that as her realizing that LF has now set his sights on her brother... not her being angry at Jon and wanting to take him down.  Which brings me to...

*Wanting Power.  The character we've had these six seasons has never shown one ounce of desiring power.  Even looking at how her dreams may have changed--while Sansa now understands that wanting a fairy-tale ending is foolish, I think now she just wants to survive.  She wants an ending for herself--she wants to be safe.  

Dude, okay, I just realized how much I've written, and kudos if you made it to the end. I know Sansa gets a lot of hate in this sub, and I truly think a lot of it is undeserved.  We have a character who arguably has undergone the most mental, physical, and emotional abuse out of anyone (besides maybe Theon).  But she's a girl who has grown, and she's survived.  

It makes me cringe every time I see someone hope that Sansa dies this season or reasoning that she has nothing left to do.  Guys.  Look at the arc this character has had--from an idealistic, bratty teenager to a woman who is strong and smart and realistic.  This is a girl who has sat at the feet of some of the most powerful players in the game--Cersei, Littlefinger, Margarey, Olenna.  My most fervent dream is that Sansa gets the ending she's been building to the entire series--one where she realizes her own strength and becomes a major player. ",284,636,False,spoiler,,,,,
