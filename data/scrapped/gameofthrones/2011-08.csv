How much does it matter?

I read a number of comments that [Gemma Whelan](http://i.imgur.com/OoYt4.jpg) looks too soft or not hardcore enough be Asha/Yara.

That's called a ""head shot"". It's used by actors and agents to give to casting directors. It's not meant to be tailored to a particular role. [Actors are called actors because they have the ability to act.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acting) She looks cute and smiley in that picture. Cut and smiley is a good choice for a young woman's head shot. If her headshot made her look a roguish swashbuckler, she might look more like Asha, but she'd have difficulty finding other roles for herself.

Ideally, head shots should show a range of emotions. Young actors don't always have a lot of money to get head shots taken, though. Older, successful actors can afford to have several very nice photo shoots, showcasing their range.

Sean Bean's attitude is not very Ned Stark in [some of his head shots](http://i.imgur.com/vOkLO.jpg). Do a GIS for Mark Addy, [and he mostly looks like the father he played in that crappy sitcom of his](http://i.imgur.com/xkTfz.jpg). Yet somehow they pulled off their roles. [Acting!](http://i.imgur.com/btF1T.jpg)

Is [Gwendoline Christie](http://i.imgur.com/Vn7Sc.jpg) too pretty for Brienne? Yes. But [Peter Dinklage is a total stud](http://i.imgur.com/jMLkx.jpg). Somehow, he worked out as The Imp. They both possess a particular stature, and they can both act. That's enough to make it work.

And if [Nonso Anozie](http://i.imgur.com/EgPxz.jpg) looks the wrong race to play Xaro Xhoan Daxos (say it 10x fast), then it must be asked. . .

Does [Maisie Williams](http://i.imgur.com/989bl.jpg) look anything like ""Arya Horseface""? No. More like ""Arya adorable little hyperthyroid-y moon-pie face"".

Does [Iain Glen](http://i.imgur.com/7EUfr.jpg) look anything like the bearish, dark-haired brute GRRM describes as Jorah Mormont? Nope. (Would I still go gay for him? Probably.)

Does [Conweth Hill](http://i.imgur.com/wga4I.jpg) look like he should be in anything other than a David Crosby biopic? Certainly not.

And yet they all were fucking fantastic in GoT.

So what did we learn today?

We learned that [imgur.com](imgur.com) is a powerful tool and must never fall into the wrong hands.

Thank you.

EDIT: ""Still Standing"" was simply not my kind of show, so perhaps it was unfair of me to single it out as crappy. Also: I meant to refer to hyperthyroidism and not hyperglycemia. ",144,184,False,self,,,,,

""... Then comes Hume, who refutes both hypotheses, and destroys the soul and the body. What is the soul but that which perceives, and what is matter but that which is perceived? If nouns are suppressed in this world, they must be reduced to verbs. We ought not to say, ""I think,"" because ""I"" is a subject; we should say, ""It is thought,"" much as we say, ""It is raining."" In both verbs we have an action without a subject. When Descartes said, ""I think, therefore I am,"" he should have said, ""Something thinks,"" or ""It is thought,"" because ""I"" assumes an entity, and I have no right to assume that.

Not that the scene itself is especially moving, but the story of Theon Greyjoy, just hit me. When he went back to Pyke he hadn't recognized her, she was charming and attractive and all that, and now she didn't recognize him.

Because he's fucking broken.

Anyway, I cried a bit. Not an emotion that has ever been evoked by fiction of the literary kind in myself. His story is just so intensely sad, he's such a forlorn character, for so many reasons.

I haven't read farther than that yet so I'm eager to see where his story goes in what's left of aDwD, but, yeah. Thought I'd share.

2) Of course the nobility that we spend much of our time with in the books will have way more food, money, resources than the common man...

But in this series, I hardly get a sense of there being many economically productive communities. When we get descriptions of settings that are NOT major cities, it's mostly of natural beauty and the wilderness. And when we come across farms, their devastation is described.

On top of that, it takes quite a suspension of disbelief to imagine that Westeros as a civilization could exist without PREDICTABLE seasons, especially when GRRM hypes up how harsh the winters can be.

It's really fascinating how much GRRM incorporates this detailed history that all the characters know about but we only get to learn in little pieces and from different perspectives, bit by bit. Rhaegar is a really interesting character to me and each bit I learn about him only makes it more so.

What I wonder is, do you guys think that, given how important several aspects of Westeros' history before the beginning of the series are to the story as it unfolds, do you think they're eventually going to end up doing any form of flashback or views to that past in the TV series?

Obviously, they chose not to go that route in season 1, which was a bold choice if you ask me because there was a LOT of backstory for them to cover and make viewers aware of, way more than some viewers might be expected to pay attention to. Regardless, I still think it worked, and I watched the whole first season before I started reading the books and didn't feel like I was hopelessly confused about the past they kept referencing.

But I feel like as the series progresses, it might be more interesting to actually give us a visual view into these characters to really make their importance to the story more worthwhile.

Specifically, the two big situations I am interested in seeing so far are Rhaegar's life/history, at least some of his interactions with the other characters, and also Ned and Lyanna and the ""promise"" Ned often mentioned but has yet to be explained to me.

I guess it could be tough in terms of having younger versions of some of the current characters, but I don't know, what do you think?",3,7,False,self,,,,,

So happy, and yet so sad now that I have to wait years to read more. Thank the gods for a TV series to tide us over for a while. 

Is anyone else worrying that Arya will turn into a villan? Once she is done her training she will have basically cut herself off from any former ties to friends and family, a true faceless man would not hesitate to kill anyone, not even former friends and family. 

But on the other hand I dont think Arya is turning out to be a very good faceless man, twice she failed her training. First when she should have discarded all of her former possessions she actually didn't since she hid needle under the steps. Second during her blind training she cheated by looking through the eyes of a cat using her warg ability. A true faceless man would not have been able to do that and would have had to spend many more years honing their skills in blindness, and now since Arya cheated at that she will never be as truly skilled in darkness as a real faceless man ought to be. 

I have a feeling that the Red Queen will give Jon the fire kiss and raise him as a wight as Dondarion was, or else just heal him with fire similarly to how Victarions' hand was healed. 

If Jon become a wight by the fire kiss that will make him the second Stark to become a wight. 

I hope that Coldhands turns out to be Benjen Stark, and that would be the third Stark to become a wight. 

I'm sensing a trend.

Does this seem realistic ? I cant see the Dothraki posing too much of a threat to the more advanced armies of Westeros.

Below are some glaring weaknesses in my eyes of a Khal led Dothraki horse army.

-No use of armor whatsoever
-Primitive military tactics compared to the armies of Westeros
-Given that the entire army is mounted that means much more food is required, where is the Khals 50'000 soldiers plus 100'000 horses going to get food once they land?
-With no siege equipment how are they going to take over the larger castles and fortifications throughout Westeros.
-Given what we know from the books and the tv series it would appear the Dothraki have no discipline, could see them charging a spear wall or trying to storm a castle.

I just dont understand why Westeros is supposed to fear them so much, I would think Tywin Lannister leading a army half the size of the Dothraki horde would have not much of a challenge. 

Almost all of the armies of Westeros are wearing heavy platemail armor, and there archers could hide behind the walls of spear men. What could the Dothraki do against a armored calvary charge with the long lances carried by knights?

It feels like, besides all of her character and personality development, it's back to square one for her, minus Viserys and plus dragons - but after season 1 we had already lost Viserys and gained dragons :/

Any of Cersei's children would become part of their father's line. And Tyrion is well, Tyrion. He even mentions something about his father having doubts about his paternity in AGoT. 

So my question is, why did Tywin never remarry and have more legitimate children after Joanna died? Is it mentioned in the books? For all the work he did raising up House Lannister, it seems odd that he'd be okay with it passing to some lesser cousin or uncle instead of one of his children.

It seems as long as you don't marry or have children, you aren't forsaking your vows... Is this an unofficial rule or was there an amendment at some point to the oath?

He's concerned about the horrors of war, and the way that the petty warring between kingdoms ravages the whole continent.

They show this a bit in the books, with Renly reflecting on how good soldiers don't make good kings and positing himself and his intelligence and sense of mercy as a better alternative. Sure, he has some hubris, but he also seems like he genuinely would be a pretty decent ruler.

After reading all the good buzz about the series I picked up GoT and was hooked - it obviously isn't a case of ""slap a dragon on the cover and it'll sell to a market segment"" syndrome ;)  These are truly awesome books and I completely understand why HBO green-lighted the series.

GRRM writes well and creates an utterly compelling world - but is it unique to the ASoIaF universe?  Or even the main books of the series?  I see he wrote several books before ASoIaF and some other novellas - are they as good (or possibly better)?

So any advice on books not a part of the main series would be greatly appreciated.  Because Winter Is Coming, and I need some books to read :D

They hailed it as a return to form after Feast, with the New York times even going so far as asserting that the book vaulted the series above The Lord of The Rings, and usurping its place as the best fantasy series, at least for modern audiences. A bold claim.

At the same time, the rank and file fans shouted about how much of a betrayal the book was after such a long wait. You guys were among them, so I'm sure you remember. The fan backlash eventually lead to the book garnering an even lower ranking on Amazon than Feast.

Overall I am very pleased with it, especially as it matches the limited edition Feast for Crows I had already. Also some nice maps in it, and some cool sigils on the cover. A couple tiny dings in shipping but not unexpected for ordering it from across the pond. The big annoyance, however, is that this is what I ordered:

http://www.harpercollins.co.uk/Titles/73107/a-game-of-thrones-slipcase-edition-george-r-r-martin-9780007441426

I followed the link on that page to Amazon.co.uk and ended up with the blue slipcase edition, not the brown one pictured on their website. The brown one was also the one pictured on Amazon when I placed my preorder. But oh well, apparently they changed the design somewhere along the line. I would have liked the other one but the blue one is very nice and as I said it matches my Feast copy well.

Who is Pate?  The very last line in the book when he introduces him seems like it should be significant, but I can't remember who Pate is (I remember his name though).

Also I hate Catelyn all over again.  I thought she would get a chance at revenge, except she hangs Brienne in a fury, someone who did nothing but try to find her daughters for her.  I almost hate her more than Jeoffrey.  Also, Cercei karma is sweet.

As for a bit of speculation, I think the Maegi prophecy about Cercei (the valonquar one) is about Jaime, not Tyrion.

So far here is what I have 

[Book Spoiler](/b ""Shaggy Dog: Black fur and bright green eyes
Grey Wind: Gold eyes Smokey Grey fur.  
Summer: Yellow Eyes. Silver and smokey fur.      (Not sure if summer and grey wind should match.  I don't recall this in the books)
Ghost: Albino with Red Eyes
3 eyed crow"")

Thank you all very much

EDIT:  I've just gotten off the phone again with the artist and it looks like with my tiny ass arms 1 of the dire wolves will go on my arm, along with the 3 eyed crow, a bronze crown for the king of the north, and I'm not sure what else to put in there.  I think the weirwood would be awesome, but the faces would distract from the dire wolf.  Any suggestions on foliage that I'm not thinking of that should go into this? (When I think ASOIAF I think snow, dessert, weirwood).  
FINALLY: The 1 dire wolf that can go on my arm I'm thinking will be Shaggy Dog, since Black will not get as lost as grey will with Summer or Grey Wind.  IF I wanted to go with Grey Wind I would have to not go with the ""smokey"" look but a darker grey.  White would also need to be tinted some color to show up (I love Ghost :( )Any suggestions on this?  2 of the other remaining dire wolves will go on my chest piece.

I've finished all five books, and finally decided to get HBO to watch the episodes.  And even though I'm not really ASoIaF purist, I keep getting distracted by how bad the dragon egg props look.

In Game of Thrones the eggs are described as:

&gt;...patterned in such rich colors that at first she thought they were crusted with jewels...covered with tiny scales...they shimmered like polished metal in the light of the setting sun.  One egg was a deep green, with burnished bronze flecks that came and went depending on how Dany turned it.  Another was pale cream streaked with gold.  The last was black, as black as a midnight sea, yet alive with scarlet ripples and swirls...

Yet they look like this:

I realize that there is a limited budget.  But was anyone else disappointed?  They just look so dull and lusterless, but they are supposed to be ""*the most beautiful things she had ever seen.*""  I was hoping for so much more.  Am I the only one?

ETA:  Sorry if I didn't use spoiler tags.

Rhaegar would have been the best king the realm had ever known.

At first I thought the good guys won at the battle of the Trident, Robert struck down Rhaegar and then became king so Robert must be the good guy right? But as time goes on I'm beginning to think it was just the opposite, Robert truly was a vile usurper, a drunken thug, a terrible king. 

Basically everything that has gone wrong in the realm all stems from that one fateful hammerblow on the Trident.

Also, his tomb is empty, he was lost on the sea, so it's not certain that he died. My guess is that he reached the eastern shores of Essos, but couldn't return and founded a city there with his crew. And said city will become important later.

**My theory:**

There are no gods. 

However there are 4 non-human races living in the world at this time.

These 4 non-human races are ancient and powerful, but few in number. 

In ancient times some of these races had a closer connection with humans than they do now, but over time they withdrew themselves from human contact and as a result many humans began to think they were only myths and legends, but some humans began to worship them as gods. 

The four non-human races are:

1. **Children of Ice. (The Others)**    
**Location:** The farthest north.    
**Followers:** None.  
**Appearance:** Humanoid Ice creatures.    
**Story:** The Children of Ice hate all creatures of flesh and seek to destroy them. They can turn flesh creatures into wights and use them as puppets. They make war against the flesh creatures in the south during the winters when the weather is more to their advantage. (Thanks stolee).

2. **Children of Fire and Shadow.**    
**Location:** Valyria    
**Followers:** Practiser's of blood/shadow/fire magic.    
**Appearance:** Humanoid Fire or Shadow creatures.    
**Story:** The children of fire and shadow had a close connection to humans for a long time, they taught humans about magic and technology and dragons and helped them to establish the kingdom of Valyria. Eventually the humans became greedy and powerful and attacked the Children. In response the Children destroyed Valeria in a conflagration of fire and seized it for themselves. Now the Children live in Valyria and kill any humans that try to return. The Children keep in contact with humans through fires and shadows, and because of their close contact with humans for many years the Children have the ability to channel their powers through humans to perform real acts of magic, and can even give them visions of the future. 

3. **The Children of the Forest.**    
**Location:** Westeros.    
**Followers:** The Greenseers. The Green men on the Isle of faces.    
**Appearance:** Young Elven Children.    
**Story:** The Children of the Forest were once the most numerous of the 4 non-human races. They lived peacefully for thousands of years until the First Men came and started a war. The Children of the Forest could have destroyed all of Westeros the same way that Valeria was destroyed. They actually did shatter the Arm of Dorne into an island chain in a small display of power, but if they destroyed all of Westeros that would mean destroying their own homes and forests and they could not bring themselves to do it. So instead of destroying Westeros they made peace with the First Men and withdrew themselves further and further into the north. They keep in contact with humans through the trees and through dreams. 

4. **The Children of the Sea. (The Kraken)**    
**Location:** The deep sea.    
**Followers:** Those who drown and are sent back.    
**Appearance:** Giant Squid.    
**Story:** The Children of the Sea live in the deeps of the ocean and prefer to have little contact with the land dwellers. The Children of the Sea silently watch the happenings on land by occasionally sending drowned humans back to the surface to be their eyes and ears, but for the most part they choose not to take sides in the conflicts of the surface. When they do participate they do so by creating powerful storms or by personally ascending to the surface to attack ships. 

5. **The Many Faced God.**    
**Location:**    
**Followers:** The faceless men.    
**Appearance:** Anything    
**Story:** All of the 4 races have demonstrated that they have special powers over life and death, and are able to bring the dead back to life, for example: The Others can bring people back to life as wights. The Children of Fire and Shadow can bring people back to life with the kiss of fire as demonstrated by Thoros of Myr. The Children of the Forest can keep people alive after death as demonstrated in the cave in the far north. The Kraken can send those who drowned back to the surface to live again as in the cases of Patchface and Damphair. The faceless men have real powers, their powers are derived from each of the 4 races. Although perhaps primarily their powers stem from the Children of Shadow and Fire since those Children seem to have the strongest connection to shadows and illusions and also originated in Valyria which is also where the Many Faced god originated. (Thanks noobkins).

6. **The Seven.**    
**Location:**    
**Followers:** Septons.    
**Appearance:** Warrior, Smith, Maid, Mother, Crone, Father, Stranger    
**Story:** The Seven are purely a human invention and have no real powers. 

**tl;dr:** There are no gods, but the idea of the gods has some basis in reality, namely 4 ancient races of non-human beings who live in the world and have god-like abilities, The Others, The Children of the Forest, The Shadow and Fire creatures, and the Kraken. The Many Faced God is a reinterpretation of all of them. The Seven are just a human invention and have no real powers. ",15,9,False,self,,,,,

Love this subreddit, so I thought I would contribute.  I was lucky enough to read the first four books (in like 2009) before I heard of the show.  So like many of you, these books were very personal to me.  I love the series and have many favorite characters, but I would like to focus on one story line if I may...

(My Fav Character)  Love him or hate him, when reading the 1st book, I became a fan of Theon Greyjoy.  His personality and swagger in the face of his situation appealed to me.  He was my age at the time, and if I said I haven't been called an arrogant prick once or twice in my time, I would be lying.  So, I could identify.  Anyways, I became emotionally connected to his character towards the end of 'A Game of Thrones'.

Imagine my surprise when he became a POV character!  Although I didn't always agree with what he did, I had a certain respect for his boldness and I could understand his motivation.  After his betrayal at Winterfell, and for the last 2 or 3 years, I have been in a limbo, wondering whether he was alive or dead but dreading (bad pun!) the worst.  I never lost hope though, and when I read the first ""Reek"" chapter, I was both happy and sad.  Reading his story in ADWD has been especially heartbreaking.  Seeing him broken and lost like that was tough, and I found myself willing him to act with courage again and remember who he was.

It has one of the hardest reads of my life, but Theon's redemption has also been one of the brightest points in the series for me and, if I'm honest, I shed a tear of joy and smiled when he remembered his name in Asha's chapter.

**The Father (Judgment, justice)** Stannis (justice is his entire cause, and his most imposing character trait)

**The Mother (nurturing)** Dany (they even call her ""mother"". she will do anything in her power to protect her children, the freed slaves)

**The Warrior (Victory)** Victarion (Ironborn, his name even sounds like 'Victory')

**The Smith (building/work)** Jon Snow (made relations with the wildlings, and quadrupled the strength of the Wall)

**The Maiden (innocence, chastity)** Brienne, the Maid of Tarth. (unbelievably naive, forever a virgin even though she almost got raped about a dozen times)

**The Stranger (death, the unknown)** Arya. (Has about 10 different identities, is training to be a faceless assassin)

**The Crone (wisdom, guidance)** Bran, training to become a Greenseer


Stranger yet, four of these seven are actually viable candidates for Azor Ahai reborn, according to the prophecy. 

Stannis: Melisandre thinks he is Azor Ahai reborn

Dany: Aemon said she is the one the prophecy spoke of, and she fits with the prophecy better than anybody else

Victarion: Almost died until the red priest saved him. Gave a dual offering to the Drowned God and R'hllor as thanks for his new life; a burning ship on the sea (smoke and salt) with the comet on the horizon, while going to free dany and her dragons from the city of stone.

Jon Snow: GRRM went to great lengths to describe the crest on the knight being maimed by Wun-Wun (a red star) at the end of aDwD. Smoke poured from Jon's wounds, and his brothers were crying(smoke and salt). whenever Melisandre looks for Azor Ahai in her fire, she sees Jon.


I know theorycrafting is silly, but I was just wondering if anybody has has noticed this stuff. Seems likely that these seven people will end up fighting together against the Others. I know Stannis is meant to be dead... but the only proof of that is Ramsay Bolton's letter, which I'm inclined to not believe. Perhaps the Seven are just the seven faces of R'hllor, and Azor Ahai reborn is seven people with one cause?",19,18,False,self,,,,,

Love this subreddit, so I thought I would contribute. I was lucky enough to read the first four books (in like 2009) before I heard of the show. So like many of you, these books were very personal to me. I love the series and have many favorite characters, but I would like to focus on one story line if I may...

(My Fav Character) Love him or hate him, when reading the 1st book, I became a fan of Theon Greyjoy. His personality and swagger in the face of his situation appealed to me. I was his age at the time, and if I said I haven't been called an arrogant prick once or twice in my time, I would be lying. So, I could identify.  Anyways, I became emotionally connected to his character towards the end of 'A Game of Thrones'.

Imagine my surprise when he became a POV character! Although I didn't always agree with what he did, I had a certain respect for his boldness and I could understand his motivation. After his betrayal at Winterfell, and for the last 2 or 3 years, I have been in a limbo, wondering whether he was alive or dead but dreading (bad pun!) the worst.

I'm planning on having a GoT marathon with some friends in a few weeks. Naturally there will be a few drinks involved (it is 10 hours long after all...) and we wanted to make up some rules for a drinking game.

I've had a few ideas, but I wondered if you could help out?

Will update this with ideas that I like.

----

**Take a drink every time:**

*Music, location?*

- The opening sequence plays.
- Epic music plays.
- In the North.

*Quotes?*

- ""A Lannister always pays his debts"".
- ""Winter is coming"".
- A reference is made to dragons or the blood of the dragon.

*Characters?*

- Robert drinks.
- Someone calls Jon a bastard. 
- Littlefinger acts creepy.
- Hodor says ""Hodor"".
- Joffrey acts like a wanker.
- Sansa acts like a little bitch.
- ~~Rickon appears on screen - finish your drink.~~ *Doesn't happen often enough.*
- A direwolf appears on screen.

*Violence?*

- Something really violent happens.
- ~~Someone is beheaded.~~ *Above and below cover this quite well.*
- A named character dies.
- A sword is drawn from its sheath.

*Nudity?* 

- Boobs
- Hodor's dong - finish your drink because you're less of a man than him.

*Interactivity?*

- If someone sends a bird/mentions receiving one, the last person to go ""CAW CAW"" must drink.
- Recite Old Nan's story word for word, and then propose a toast to her.
- Men must take the Black, word for word, then say ""We are all brothers now"" and drink together.
- Whenever Daenerys appears on screen, the last person to kneel and say ""I am yours to command Khaleesi"" must drink.

----

**EDIT**

Thanks for all the suggestions so far! Does anyone have any idea how we can make it a bit more interactive, rather than just drinking? For example, we have to recite the black when Jon and Sam take it, say ""I am yours to command Khaleesi"" whenever Daenerys asks Jorah to do something... any other ideas? We want to make it fun!

I just heard about this show a few weeks ago, and learned its part one of six(and counting) books.

So I have a few questions about where the story goes from the end of the season finale.

*He was no dragon. Fire cannot kill a dragon.*

At the end, we see Daenerys in the ashes with three newly hatched dragons. Is it implied that she is their mother? Does she have control over the dragons? do they eventually run amok? how big of an impact does the hatching of the dragons have over the story of the next 5 books?

Does Aira exact revenge for her fathers beheading? or does she just stay in hiding? I mean, you don't just have a nine year old just off offhandedly kill a guy, and not expect her do do a lot more killing. Maybe I'm wrong.

Does the second book pick up where the first TV season left us?

Does the red-headed whore(Ruby?) appear anymore throughout the next five books? That actress had a really nice rack.

[Unmarked ACoK spoilers],https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/jkctj/can_got_really_last_more_than_2_seasons_unmarked/,khartael,1313492580,"Just finished ACoK here, and I can't possibly see how GoT is going to be picked up for a 3rd season. The safe assumption is that the 2nd season will revolve mainly around the events of ACoK -- but the plot threads only diverge and distance themselves from each other, to the point where you wind up reading around 6 separate stories set in the same world -- some of them (Jon and Dany) don't even get hinted at by other characters. With the exception of Theon and Bran, the main characters almost never come across each other through the entirety of the book. New minor characters pop up in the dozens, each causing a slight disturbance and altertation to the flow of the story...

Not to mention some of the main cast doesn't really get to *do much*. Bran mostly sits on his ass and whines about the Freys for 700 pages, Sansa's inner conflicts don't translate well to TV, Jaime only shows up near the very end (and they already used his reappearance scene in the first season)...

While these all make for a great setting in a book format, showbiz and television are a tad less forgiving. Viewers unfamiliar with the books and their slow pace will be frustrated with nothing coming together -- great television this does not make.

Can they really hold a TV audience substantial enough to carry over to a 3rd season, given the overwhelming costs and budget?",91,14,False,self,,,,,

I can't help but feel like there are a lot of similarities between the two. 

I've been thinking about it for a while, and the general sense of ""No winners or losers, only survivors"" seems to be readily apparent in both series. Robb broke his marriage contract with the Freys and ended up getting killed for it, even though he had won every battle, and captured perhaps the most important man in the war (Jamie). In The Wire, Stringer Bell was seemingly on top of the world, running the co-op and selling the good heroin through Proposition Joe, but ended up killed by Omar and Brother Mozoune anyway, because he was trying to reach too far and ended up creating a rift between him and Avon.

The characters in both series are very complex and dynamic as well, mainly, there seems to be a lot of moral ambiguity. Omar is pretty much a mass-murderer, but at the same time, he's clearly intelligent, doesn't use cuss words, and only robs drug dealers. Jaime seems like a monster in the beginning of the series, banging his sister and pushing children out of windows. Once we get his perspective on things, and once he gains a little perspective of his own (one-handed), he becomes *much* more sympathetic. You *want* to root for him...but he's still banging his sister. 

I've been trying to come up with some character parallels as well. For example, Omar and Beric seem like they would get along famously. Beric seems to only kill the soldiers that are responsible for doing horrible things, just as Omar doesn't kill anyone that isn't in the game. 

Not only to both Bodie and Ned Stark freely admit to just being soldiers, they seem to celebrate that fact. When Bodie was killed, I couldn't help but remember that he used to play checkers on a chess board (in the scene of his death, Chris and Snoop are both moving towards him diagonally like bishops, while O-Dog makes an 'L' shaped move like a knight and shoots Bodie in the head). As for Ned in King's Landing, he thought he was so clever getting Littlefinger and the Gold Cloaks on his side, not knowing that Cersei was playing a much more advanced game than he was all along. It's no surprise that they both end up dying playing checkers while everyone else is playing chess. 

Michael and Arya have similar character arcs as well. Both are recognized to have something special at a young age. Marlo and Chris seem to take Michael under their wings because of his demeanor and how he doesn't seem scared of them. Jaqen starts Arya on the path to Braavos with the coin after recognizing something while they are both traveling with Yoren and stationed in Harrenhal (Arya saving them from the fire, trying to sneak up on Jaqen and Jaqen explaining to her that bare feet would be quieter, etc.). Also, I could easily see Arya becoming the ""new Beric""--assuming her training somehow didn't work out--just as Michael became the ""new Omar"". 

Anything else? Cersei and Marlo? They both seemed totally concerned with attaining power. Catelyn and McNulty? After McNulty decided to fabricate his case and after Catelyn was resurrected, both of their moral compasses seem to go out the window.

I don't know, what do you guys think? I'm mainly curious to hear other peoples thoughts on two once-in-a-lifetime series.

1,000 leagues! that's 3,000 miles from everything I can tell! so looking at any map of the North of Westeros it must be about 5,000 miles or so from The Neck to The Wall (along the Kingsroad at least). 

so that would make the North as long as the US is wide! surely that can't be right . . . it doesn't characters *that* long to move around Westeros. 

**what I'm basing this on (for those that care):** in English 3 miles is a league (a league being how far a man on horse is supposed to be able to travel in a day according to Wiki). I realize leagues *could* be relative, but no form of reference is really given. I've never seen a league be less than a mile, tough (even Roman leagues were about 1.5 miles). GRRM refers to leagues as the form of measurement of greater distances in the books. 

there are distance references (unmarked units) in some of the maps I've seen of Westeros (I believe they are the official ones from the book). it would look like 1,000 somethings from The Neck to Winterfell, so that seems to add up. so the 1,000 leagues wouldn't appear to be an exaggeration. 

If anyone is wondering where I get the ""1,000 leagues"" reference it's from [Storm of Swords](/b ""Jojen tells Meera that they are a couple of crannogmen a thousand leagues from the Neck who would be recognized on page 133."").",31,13,False,self,,,,,

Seeing how Jon wants to save her and even tells her that he will send  her off to Maester Aemon shows what this guy really feels for her and it breaks my heart that it has to end like this but it's such a poetic ending to their relationship so I'm glad.

**Jon**: I wonder if his death will either mean he'll be resurrected like Benjen Stark [coldhands, I'm almost positive] or if he'll 'warg' into something else after Ghost.

*It's seen by Mel that he'll be a man/wolf/man again

*Jon may be the true Azor Ahai reborn and not Stannis - we may learn the truth of this if he manages to journey to winterfell to recover the sword.

*Because of all the misinformation and secrecy surrounding his birth he may very well be Lyanna's son or his father may be of royal high birth such as one of the Targaryens, guessing Silver hair gives way to the Stark genes.

**Aegon**: Is it really Aegon? I know Gregor Clegane said that he killed 'her screaming whelp' and we never hear him mention killing the son as well. Varys is very tricky and could very well have manufactured him for all we know though.

**Davos**: Will he meet up with Rickon and Osha?

**Bran**: Is there any chance Bloodraven is evil and intends to corrupt Bran somehow? I only follow this train of thought because Varomyr mentioned all the things a Warg wasn't supposed to do and Bran seems to have broken every rule.

**Varys**: We finally learn that his little birds do more than just listen, they'll kill for him as well! Do you think his death is coming up after Cerseis trial? It'd be great storytelling to hear a confession from Varys.

Do Not Read If You Haven't Finished),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/jn409/thoughts_after_finishing_adwd_warning_major/,daivos,1313698469,"I cant help but feel there is going to be a severe backlash from all the people who were introduced to A Song of Fire and Ice through the HBO series and are just now rounding book 3 and into book 4.

For me, after five-years of waiting for a book that was supposed to have been mostly complete when A Feast For Crows was published, A Dance With Dragons was another big disappointment.

Sure, there were a few nuggets in the book, but for the most part, ADWD was yet another novel without any real story arc and very few climaxes, and if anything, made AFFC look the superior of the two.

Lets review what really happened in ADWD, the book of travel and inconclusions.

Tyrion, one of GRRMs best characters and absent from AFFC, spent the entire book traveling. Granted, his travels were more interesting than most, but still, the extent of his impact is crossing roads with various different fringe characters and other story threads. At some point he figures to cross paths with Dany, but that thread is left inconclusive.

Davos Seaworth, also absent from AFFC made a couple of cameo point-of-view appearances, mostly involving more travel before being sent off on a hunt for Rickon Stark.

Bran Stark, another absent character from AFFC spends the first part of the book, you guessed it, traveling. When he finally gets there, nothing really happens. He makes nice with a bunch of trees and apparently can mind meld and see through their carved faces, even back through memories.

Victarion Grayjoy, one of the more boring characters from AFFC makes an appearance toward the end of ADWD. Apparently hes been traveling around as well, and hes making his way to the east for a convenient way to ship Dany home. Problem is, this thread still hasnt be concluded because Victarion still isnt quite there.

Stannis is yet another traveling man, cruising around the north trying to drum up support for is cause. In tow, Asha Grayjoy follows along as a non-impacting prisoner. By the end of ADWD, this is yet another thread left inconclusive. Did Stannis attack? Did Stannis lose? Did Stannis freeze to death?

Ramsey Bolton punishes, beats, and abuses Theon Grayjoy. Marries Jeyne Poole. Sends a letter to the wall saying he has beaten Stannis, but no one really knows. Unfotunately, this is one of the more interesting threads, but has no redeeming value, because Theon is such a pathetic character now.

Arya, another one of GRRMs best characters, who was sparsely written about in AFFC gets two of the more interesting chapters at the end of ADWD gets sent off to do an apprenticeship.

Jon Snow, just when you thought he was about to ship himself off on some ranging adventure, pays what appears to be the ultimate price. He stays put on the wall, makes friends with the wildlings, and waits for the Others that never seem to come. GRRMs last hope of a hero might be dead or might not, but certainly wont be back without some sort of resurrection or reinvention.

A new Targaryen is introduced, this one with a better claim to the Iron Throne than Dany. I cant help but feel that Aegon, or whatever his name is, is out of place after four other books.

Then finally, Dany herself, who doesnt do a damn thing yet again. After traveling around in the desert with her magical dragons, she stays put in a city, struggles to get everyone to love her, marries some incompetent dipshit she now needs to shake, and GRRM still hasnt concluded her effort to got back home and claim the Iron Throne.

The Quentyn Martell thing isnt even worth ranting about. And Ser Grandfather, gets escalated to a point-of-view character to fill in some gaps, but doesnt really do much himself.

Ta da, 1,000+ pages in desperate need of an editor and more content. At least AFFC is no longer the worst book in the series.",26,6,False,self,,,,,

Ive been storming through ASOIAF this week and the thing that has kept bugging me is Ned's promise to Lyanna that haunts him through out his life. I was retelling the situation that started Roberts Rebellion when a friend quiped that Rhaegar held her long enough to fully sire a child from conception to birth. After some thought i remembered never reading Ned fully claiming Jon as his son, only as his blood. Everyone else assumed Eddard has forgotten his honor and sired a bastard, yet Ned never lets any details slip about Jons mother. What we hear is pure speculation from the world at large. This could make Jon Snow a Targaryen and could make Jon the 3rd person Dany needs to take back  Westernos. 

Another thought. Being Ned Stark is bound by honor and duty to his family, this promise would allow Ned to turn a blind eye to the whispers of his infidelity for it only helps him hide Jon's origins.

I thought I'd make this post of the list so the items could be discussed, and others could bring up the small things that don't warrant a full discussions as well.



First of all, **Roose Bolton**:  he has one BIG chapter in this book that sets up so much of his character and makes him incredibly fascinating and entertaining to read.  I already stated in another post that his Aaron Sorkin style walk-and-talk with Theon/Reek has some of my favorite quotes of the whole book.  His calm, calculated cruelty is wonderfully dark without being inexplicably evil; he considers a lot of the things he does to simply be efficient and effective for the betterment of his house.  His quote, ""child lords are the bane of any household"" is (as user squire_hyde pointed out in another post I made about this chapter) essentially a summary of the entire series.




Next, **Jorah's demon head slave tattoo**.  I just think this sounds badass, and even more so when I picture a beaten, sullen Iain Glen with it inked into his face.  




**Dragons have colored fire**:  this was already stated in the first book, but with the way Martin writes about the history of Westeros, legend, myth, and prophecy, the possibility that the Balerion the Black Dread didn't actually breath black fire was a possibility; the legend could have grown in the telling.  The dragons are magical creatures and are more than just large animals; I like how each dragon having it's own specially colored fire (black, orange with flecks of green, orange and gold) is a subtle way to imply they are more than large lizards or flying dinosaurs that happen to be rare and dangerous.  It also sounds like it would be a beautiful effect to see on the show.



**Tyrion's delayed viewing of dragons**:  I like that Tyrion did not get to see Drogon in the fighting pit; he was already being scurried off by his slavemaster and the press of the crowd.  He saw the carnage, and it isn't like he doesn't truly BELIEVE that there are dragons, but I like that Martin is saving that special moment when he first sets eyes upon these creatures he's thought so much about.  Or maybe Martin will kill him before he sees them, or have it happen between chapters and not show us.  Who knows with George...




**The ravens as magic, containing the ""souls"" of the children of the forest**:  I recall reading some other board's post for non-readers talking about the series.  Some were confused about the ""sending a raven"" and didn't realize they were carrying paper messages.  They talked about some people being able to talk to ravens or them being magic.  I felt superior.  They're just messenger ravens!  They only are special in VISIONS that Bran has.  Then this book explains that they could talk once and are all essentially magical and it retroactively changed a WHOLE BUNCH of scenes involving ravens previously.  Awesome.  Did not expect that.



**Victarion's smoking, blackened arm**:  Like Jorah's demon head tattoo, this is just pure badass.  It crackles and smokes when he makes a fist?  Hell yes.  HELL.  YES.




**Theon is still an asshole**:  When I first read the Reek chapter before the book came out, I thought he was going to use this suffering to teach Theon a lesson and redeem him.  Some still think that, but after having finished the book, he is reverting back to old Theon in the end, not just in name.  He is still cocky, with a bit of cruelty, but now he is also a little broken.  I think he is Ramsay's creature, and if anything will be more messed up, not less.  I see him making another attempt for power or favor on what could be considered the ""wrong"" or ""bad"" side, and will die for his sins.




**Penny**:  I love that there is a new dwarf in the cast.  I love it for the show, because I like diverse actors and actresses getting interesting characters on screen.  I like it in the book because it shows how well Tyrion had it, sort of.  He was also the least of all Lannisters, the least respected of any lordly sort in Westeros, but much like in the first book when Jon learns that those at the Night's Watch had it worse than him because he was raised in a castle, Tyrion (and we the reader) get the angle that shows that Tyrion didn't have it as bad as a dwarf who wasn't son of Tywin Lannister would.



**Where do whores go?**:  In the end of Storm of Swords, this seemed like a throwaway line.  It was, to me, Tywin simply being an asshole, saying ""whore"" again when Tyrion said not to.  Not answering the question.  Being rude and not believing Tyrion's threat.  The fact that Tyrion obsesses over it (and that it may have real meaning) is great.  I love that sense of consequence; his father was horrible but his dead father, and his father's last words, haunt him.  The consequences of his actions haunt him.  His actions at Joffrey's wedding haunt him (with him befriending one jouster and learning the other died because of him indirectly).  Also in this line of thinking, Dany's decision to practice queening it up by ruling Mereen and Jon's decision to try to have the watch befriend the wildings:  both seemed like good, simple ideas.  Both had incredibly large, complicated, headache-inducing consequences.

Some have proven true.  Some have yet to be, but I'm certain of.  Some are more like spitballing, which is fun.  However, there are three characters whose purpose and future I am having trouble piecing together.  I was hoping others had theories.


First, **Benjen Stark**.  I think it is clear he is Coldhands, but we still don't KNOW.  But why?  Why is he able to be a wight but also remain himself?  How did that happen?  What are his goals?  Does anyone have any good speculation on this?




Secondly, **Gendry**.  Is his presence throughout the series just a secondary character; someone meant to show that the Baratheon bloodline continues and nothing more?  He was part of the original mystery of the first book, met Eddard and Stannis and Jon Arryn, he fought alongside Arya and met Brienne as a member of Cat's Brotherhood without Banners.  He is everywhere.  What up with that?  Will he have a greater purpose, or is he just a fun character that adds a bit of flavor to and continuity to the whole proceeding?




Lastly, **The Darkstar**.  What?  Why?  WHY?!  She was a NICE Lannister!  Why hurt her?  Just for war?  Okay...but...what is the DEAL with this guy?  He has a very cool name, and you don't just get a cool name like that without being something significant.

Ok so after ADWD the general consensus is Jon Snow will be back from the dead.

 Either he's revived by Mel as Asor Azhai, wargs into Ghost and then another host or is put on ice till they find a cure for ~~seventeen~~ stab wounds ~~in the back~~ or whatever. 

Seemed like kind of a stupid thing to do on Bowen and Willis' part as most of the wildlings were already on their side of the wall and Jon was pretty much the only thing keeping them from each others throats.

There's a few things about Ramsay's letter which seem a bit weird, referencing Stannis' queen, Melisandre, his daughter, the fool etc. what would he want with them if Stannis was dead and Mance had been captured?

I'd also hoped Mance was a bit more badass than to just sit there and be captured by the likes of Ramsay.

The whole letter doesn't really make that much sense in the context of the last Theon or Asha chapters.


The amount of chapters revolving around Danaerys and Meereen as opposed to Davos, Bran and Reeks chapters I thought were kind of painful. Especially Dany sitting around thinking about who she did and didn't want to sleep with. But as I read somewhere on this subreddit, GRRM had to have Danaerys sitting around for a little longer to line up the time lines.

-I understand that Arya is training to be an assassin but at this stage but does anyone have any thoughts on how Rickon and Sansa will fitin in the end?

-Beric was badass but I'm assuming from AFFC that his life may have been forfeit for reviving Catelyn. Or maybe he'd jut been revived too many times and fizzled out

-I also really hope they have more coverage of Davos, Riverrun (Tom o Sevens, Blackfish), Brienne and the BwB in WoW, as reading the last few hundred pages of DWD waiting to hear from one of them was a bit frustrating. 

&lt;/rant&gt;

From a Wiki of Fire and Ice:

*""His grandfather was Braavosi, and took the Titan of Braavos as his symbol. Few are aware of this; Petyr wears a mockingbird as his crest instead.""*

Considering that Baelish has virtuosic skill with money, always seems to be able to find it, and splits it up in complex ventures so it is difficult to track - and considering he put the Iron Throne heavily in debt to the Iron Bank during his stint as Master of Coin (and fled town before it defaulted) - could Baelish be an agent for the Iron Bank or maybe even one the leaders of its political activities?

Are we starting to see the endgames of two major Free City-supported cabals to control the Iron Throne, with the Pentos contingent headed up by Varys, Magister Illyrio, Connington and Aegon, and the Braavos contingent headed up by Baelish, the Iron Bank, the Faceless Men and potentially using Stannis or Jon Snow in some way?

If this is a struggle between Braavos and Pentos, will Selmy's deal with the Tattered Prince come into play, putting Selmy against Pentos and thus on the side of Petyr Baelish?

Are the Braavosi seeking the dragon book in the Citadel and infiltrating the ranks of Marwyn the Mage so that they can counteract the Pentoshi/Targaryan dragon advantage?

And is the Iron Bank supporting Stannis, if they really want Baelish on the throne, one of those moves Littlefinger talks about that you make just to keep your opponent's guessing?

**TL;DR - Baelish is secretly Braavosi. Braavos is starting to exert its influence in Westeros big-time, while Baelish lays low. Coincidence? Discuss.**",17,22,False,self,,,,,

[Book Spoiler](/b ""The letter says that Ramsay has killed defeated Stannis's army (over 7 days of battle), killed stannis, and taken his ""magic sword"", and then it demands that Jon return his Reek and ""his bride"". If indeed from Ramsay, what hints does it contain? And who else could it be from, if not Ramsay?"")

[Speculation](/? ""The first significant thing to me about the letter was that it is claimed to have comed from Ramsay, and its wording is very much what the reader is trained to expect from Ramsay. So presume for a second that the letter is from Ramsay, what does it say that he wrote the letter and not his father? Even as he is marrying ""Arya"", claiming Winterfell, and claiming wardenship of the north, it seems like Roose still is in control and did not plan on letting his bastard have control over him any time soon. Why wouldn't Roose be the one to write this sort of letter?"")

[Speculation](/? ""Assuming still that it is from Ramsay, what parts are lies and which are truth? Is there anything that has to be a lie? The only thing that pops out as a possible hint of lie to me is that Ramsay notes of Stannis's magic sword, which we know isn't really all that magical. But this is weak because even if its just a glow-in-the-dark sword, ramsay might still refer to it as ""magic"". As far as I'm concerned, the letter could be 100% true. As Jon Snow notes, ""it contains pieces of certain truth"", such as the fact that Mance Rayder was in Winterfell with 6 spearwives. It also makes sense that the Boltons could have eventually beaten Stannis after a long battle, and then were unable to find Reek and ""Arya"" in the aftermath, presuming that they were heading back to the Wall with the remnants of Stannis's army that managed escape. The motivation for the letter then would have been to convince Jon that he should turn over Reek/Theon without killing him for what he did to his family, and that he should return ""Arya""/Jeyne Poole without revealing that she isn't really Arya Stark."")

[Speculation](/? ""Could the letter actually have been something done in desperation, that had a lot of lies? Presumably the point of lies if this were the case would be to draw Jon Snow away from the Wall. But to what end? Would they wait to ambush him somewhere on the way to Winterfell? That doesn't seem reasonable. Also, didn't Stannis take ravens with him, and if he was not defeated, couldn't he presumably have gotten some ravens off to send message to the Wall? Ramsay would have been risking that his letter would have gotten laughed at if Stannis had already gotten a message to him that clearly made Ramsay's out to be false."")

[Speculation](/? ""So I think that the letter could be near 100% true, to me the biggest evidence against the letter being 100% true is that GRRM set up too complicated a situation between Boltons/Freys/Manderlys/Karstarks, for all that not to be resolved in some interesting way. The whole part about the Manderlys actually wanting to go for Stannis and the Karstarks planning on betraying Stannis especially. I suppose that its possible that Wyman Manderly ended up not being able to do anything, because his army was sent out in the field while he sat wounded in Winterfell, but that would be pretty dissapointing."")

First, she wrongly accuses Tyrion and kidnaps him away in the hopes of executing him, which causes a bunch of shit to go down in King's Landing, preempting the death of Ned. Sure, she helps Robb cross the twins, but she does so by basically signing everyone else's life away and indebting her son to a crazed old pervert. 

THEN she lets Jaime Lannister go! She lets him go! Now, I like Jaime given recent events in the story, but even so, what the fuck was she doing? I mean for starters, she is crazy for trusting him because the whole kingdom is under the impression that he has no honor whatsoever, and even crazier for thinking that giving up the most important captive in the world was worth her (maybe) getting a daughter back. She jeopardized the life of every northmen for fucking Sansa.

Finally she dies, and I rejoice (whilst mourning deeply for Robb), but no! She's back as a fucking zombie, and she is insane! She kills Brienne for being in Jaime Lannister's service--THE GUY SHE LET LOOSE!!! Her reasoning for doing so is that she was following Jaime's orders... BUT THEY WERE THE SAME ORDERS SHE GAVE BRIENNE!

But wait you're thinking... he's done, right? Thats about all the shitty stuff Catelyn even did right?! WRONG! Little finger is currently bringing chaos to the seven kingdoms, to spite the fact that he was lowborn and was denied the opportunity to marry Catelyn--Who led him on the whole time!

I want all the wights on his ass! I want him surrounded, I want wights coming down his fucking chimney, I want this done and over with.

Major Icestorm: No general, he has escaped us... him along with a female with a delicious suckling. 

General Iceberg: Didn't we surround them with wights?!?!
 
Major Icestorm: Yes general, but at least one of the wights appears to have been consumed by fire.... and most of the others by... birds.

General Iceberg: Birds?

Major Icestorm: Carrion crows mostly, the scavengers are getting desperate for food, luckily none of the wights was consumed completely, but all of them were somewhat eaten.

Publishing houses try to make as much money as they can from hardcover sales.  So 6 months is usually a fast-tracked paperback (and maybe Random House will be merciful for that Christmas time release), but 9-12 months after hard cover release is the usual schedule.  (See this [NYT ArtsBeat article from 2008](http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/02/rethinking-the-paperback-timeline/))

My personal opinion on this?  With April, 2012 the target date for the 2nd season premiere of HBO's Game of Thrones, I'm guessing they might release a paperback around that time as marketing tie-in (and that's about 9 months from original release, so within the normal calendar).

It's only been 6 weeks since the book was officially released in hard cover. It's still at the top of the NY Times' Hardcover Fiction Bestseller list and in the Top 10 of Combined Print and E-Book Fiction.  While it's still producing money like this, there won't be a paperback.

In the meantime, there's the library and sympathetic friends ;)",7,7,False,self,,,,,

He seems to be doing nothing but sowing chaos; poisoning Jon Arryn, igniting the Stark-Lannister feud, and orchestrating Ned's death, to name a few examples. 

For all we know, he could have had a hand in the assassination attempt on Bran, or even in the Red Wedding. Also, his schemings in the Vale are nothing short of brilliant; the parlay with the Lords Declarant and his plan to marry Sansa to Harry the Heir to get back Winterfell... fuck, I can't wait until I can read ADwD and find out how that turns out, since the whole plan hinges on Tyrion's and Robert's deaths. Maybe he's just further manipulating Sansa and has no real plan to win back Winterfell?

The question was why you think Littlefinger does what he does, and this was the answer by Sephirott: (Please note, I'm not trying to karma whore here. Go upvote the original post as well, I just thought this point was amazing, and more people needed a chance to read it]

""I think that Littlefinger, due to his treatment by Hoster Tully as a child, being told that he would never be good enough for Catelyn, and his fight with Brandon Stark, he has a deep seeded mistrust and hatred for the current ruling class. I think his main motive is to overthrow that existing power structure by causing the death or disenfranchisement of all of the major lords, creating an entirely new ruling class. He mentions in the background of Harry the Heir that some of his family members ""made the wise choice"" to marry merchant class individuals rather than lords. I think he sees a world where skill and ambition mean more than who was whose father, and where even a major lord's daughter can marry a boy from a minor house if they are in love. To achieve this he has to get rid of the entrenched lords of ancient houses.""

I never thought about his motives in terms of social reform before. This could be possible clues to Martin's bittersweet ending. The main characters are dead but it leads to a society in which the peasants and smallfolk are given more weight. We lose certain people, but society itself starts to move away from medieval constructs and we see real improvement in quality of life. This just sparked a lot of ideas for me.

I expected her to be more complicated, and I'm now wondering if she's actually been executed at her final POV chapter. If she is, I really could not care less.

* Other than her, however, I enjoyed the newly-introduced characters quite a bit. Aeron and Victarion were incredibly interesting, and I kept wishing for an Euron chapter that never came. Sam has grown on me, and I liked finally catching an insight of what's been happening in Dorne. The Cersei chapters were pretty good, too, even though she was slowly descending into madness with each passing chapter.

* What disappointed me the most about the book is its incredibly anti-climactic ending, and the fact that most character deaths happen off-stage. I was looking forward to a Dondarrion/Gregor Clegane showdown, and their deaths were such a passing thing, disappointingly. Same goes for the Hound.

* All in all, it felt like it should've had three-four chapters towards the end with something truly memorable occuring, like the Red Wedding, King's Landing battle, Petyr shoving Lysa out the Eyrie, Catelyn returning as a zombie... As an afterthought, both of those things were awesome.

Anyway. What are your thoughts? Anything you wanna say to prepare me for DwD?

Ned is the only exception so far (just finished RW and can't decide if I'm pleased or pissed).

Ned got to go south and avenge his family and came back, but his father and brother died. Of course as soon as he goes back to help Robert again he's dead.

Robb gets to die for leaving and even attempting to come back. And in leaving loses the entire north and as far as he knows nearly his whole family as well.

Catelyn dies just cause she was an idiot and I'm not going there. Possibly partly from being a Stark, but I think mostly cause she was an idiot and made terrible decisions.

Arya gets to live because from the spoilers I read  [Speculation](/? ""she doesn't try to go back north after RW and goes across the narrow sea to become a faceless man"")

I don't really know about Sansa, but I'm betting she gets a shit deal too.  [Speculation](/? ""I'm assuming that Tyrion will somehow fuck up massively and get killed/exiled taking Sansa along with him? Most likely by being un-Lannisterly and doing the right thing at some point or by really killing Cersei like he says he wants to."") 
Either way I really don't like Sansa, she's too much like her mother. I realize that sh'es supposed to be just a dumb girl that believes all the stories she was told, but still. Arya got her shit together and she's 3 (?) years younger than her.

In summation of the Starks that have gone to the south

* Rickard = dead

* Brandon = dead

* Lyanna = dead

* Ned = dead

* Robb = dead

* Catelyn = dead (YAY!!!!)

* Umbers, Karstarks, most others loyal to the Starks that went south = dead

Please correct me if I'm wrong and feel free to spoil me since I already know about a few people and am planning to take a break from reading the series to read some other series I've fallen behind on.

But there's a bunch of other constelations named in the books that I couldn't so obviously understand. The Galley could be the ancient constelation of *argo navis*, now divided in *carina*, *puppis* and *vela*. 

The Crone's Lantern, described by Davos Seaworth in aSoS as ""four bright stars that enclosed a golden haze"" could be some part of Orion and the haze be Orion's nebula? Or maybe part of *sagittarius* enclosing lagoon's nebula?

Or maybe GRRM had no intention at all in making the sky of Westeros consistent with our own, and just created a few asterisms based on popular astronomoy and invented others out of the blue.

Thus I decided to compile my views on the good/bad guys. 

Tywin: He catches a lot of flak for being top dog of the lannisters and organizing the Red Wedding. Yet he is fiercely loyal to his family and house. The way he kept on searching for the missing lannister in King's Landing and his constant effort to keep the Lannisters at the top. He has the full loyalty of people like Illyn and Kevan. Furthermore he is shaped by his father, the ""Sleepy"" lion and had to maintain a harsh method to keep the dignity of his house. 

Finally it is mentioned the better part of him died with his wife, due to it he maintain a very bitter view of Tyrion who many readers love and thus hate Tywin because the way he treats him. But think about it, a dwarf killing you wife in childbirth is very difficult to love fully without remembering your wife.

Illyn the King's Justice: I feel he is a character if he could speak would offer very interesting insights and views. He had his tongue torn out by the Mad King for boasting (drunk?) his liege was the most powerful. In the present, there is no hint of the boasting man, all that remains is a very bitter man who finds no love in the world. The place where he lived was sickening to be honest and the fact that he left with Jaime is very telling of the fact that he doesn't want to be left behind there. 

Joffery: I know it's very popular to hate him and all but he is a very pitiful child. Never loved by his father and developed a very fucked of sense of trying to impress him. Showing him the cut up cat, trying to kill Bran. Then Cersei protects him saying it's all okay and thus grows up like the person he is due to the bad parenting. With Robert dead, he is no longer restrained with such a weak mother he can do whatever he wils. 

Red Viper: Adding him here because, god did he fuck up the plans so much. Yes he is badass, yes he is so skilled but he fucked up. His thirst of vengeance resulted in him dying leading to situation in Dorne being messed up and most tragic of all, he did not get to see Aegon, the son of his beloved sister. Dorne is sorely missing him and due to his death things are very fucked up.

King Aerys' the Mad King: So very tragic, wedding was never due to love. All for the sake of a prophecy, of trying to get the ""one"" in the song of fire and ice. He was also known to be kind and generous to his friends and cruel to his enemies. Not a bad trait for a king. But it was after his imprisonment everything changed. His paranoia grew and was left unchecked. Rhaegor might have been able to do something but he was too occupied and decided on doing far too late. 

Roose Bolton: Much like Tywin to be honest. He does things for the betterment of his house, even it means betraying his King. A fairly decent ruler, cruel but for the sake of it and only if it's in his due (his fathering of the Bastard). Very pragmatic and skilled, his conversation with his bastard reveals the method which he rules and the way he thinks is fascinating. Finally tolerates the bastard because he knows a child lord is bad for his house.

Having finished it, I've had two major spoilers dropped on me unfairly between just now and the weekend.

I guess I shouldn't bitch. I should just quit reading this until I've read all of the books; otherwise careless assholes are going to ruin the whole fucking thing for me.

Sorry, needed to vent.

For the record: I read the 1st book and 2/3 of the second before the show debuted. Recently I started over on the 2nd book and finished it late last week. I'm now half-way through ASoS. I'm just really annoyed because I thought we were all careful about spoiling things around here.

I don't want to point out examples because I don't want shit to get spoiled for other people like it was for me.

**EDIT**: I've had a great and equal conversation with the mods. This is a great community, the people who run it really **are** trying to make it a great place for ASOIAF discussion and enthusiasm. To be clear, I never doubted it. I was just very frustrated with my experience as someone who finished book 2 late last week and thought it'd be safe to join the conversation again.

GoT Redditors: Please be considerate! Honestly, this is a subreddit filled with people who love the show and a number of people who are currently reading. Don't ruin shit!

If you're posting spoilers, please do **be specific**. That means being specific about the book you're referring to, if necessary. Right now TV spoilers are clear enough...but recently I had something (book 3 or later, who knows?) spoiled in a GoT: Season 2 thread. I thought it would be safe to read a Season 2 thread, since I was already into book 3...but then, bummer.

Anyway, let's take care of each other, friends. Winter is coming.",16,8,False,self,,,,,

The part everyone here seems so fond of alluding to for new readers -- Edmure's wedding. My reaction wasn't the apparently-common practice of throwing the book across the room in a fit of agony and rage, but oh man. I went to sleep right after reading that chapter, and a fitful sleep was had. I woke up in the middle of the night after having a god damn nightmare about it.

Now, I'm at work... and the book is out of my reach. This is pretty maddening. I desperately want and need to reread this chapter, as I'm still trying to make sense of what the hell just happened, and various details keep gnawing at my mind... so help me out here, you guys.

""Jaime Lannister sends his regards,"" says the man who kills Robb -- I assume that's Roose Bolton, given the description of his cloak. Did I miss some glaring hint in the earlier chapter where Jaime and Brienne dine with him, or is he just trying to lay the responsibility on the Lannisters? Even if so, *why?* Why bother to make excuses? You've just butchered the lot of them. Or did I simply misunderstand something?

Fuck. Jesus effin' Christ, Walder Frey. And all you other Walders, too.

If this is going to be explained in further detail in later chapters... well, mark your spoilers please.",30,0,False,self,,,,,
