Could it be that Robert, not Rhaegar as was initially foretold, was the one who raped Lyanna Stark?  Lyanna could have kept this a secret.

This strategy definitely worked but my mom and I are pretty comfortable, it could be awkward if you're not.

We watched season 1 last week. I chose to lead her through it a bit, I pointed out some of the significant points that any first time viewer might miss but left out the spoilery details (ex. after the illyrio/varys/arya scene in the dungeon, I made sure she recognized varys) and I think this was a good thing. I knew she was hooked on episode 3 or 4, when she asked ""So how many seasons of this are there?"" 

Episode 5ish I asked who her favorite characters were, she said ""Khaleesi"" and Jon Snow, and she liked Ned. Arya made the list by the end of the season too. 

Her reaction to e9 was pretty standard, ""Didn't see that coming at all"". Sometime during his imprisonment I asked for predictions and she was thinking that maybe Daenerys would come over and rescue him, lol. Sweet summer mother. After 10 she admitted she was hooked. I asked her thoughts on what she *got* vs what she *expected*, her answer was ""the complexity"". This is why I think that my explaining simple things was beneficial, as the complexity can go straight overhead if you let it.

Today we watched through episode 7 of s2. She wasn't fooled at all by the burnt bodies. After ep 6 where the dragons are stolen, she theorized that the dragons might grow up but still recognize her as their mother when grown. She just now texted ""I knew it wasn't the two little Stark boys that were burned! :D""

Trying to think if I can arrange for watching the Red Wedding with her, without setting off any alarms. Doubt it unfortunately.

28,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-3-1,2018,3,1,13,812koa,self.gameofthrones,[MAIN SPOILERS] - An Afterlife of Fire or Ice,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/812koa/main_spoilers_an_afterlife_of_fire_or_ice/,butlerintraining,1519878066,"Melisandre is constantly on the hunt for the answers to the afterlife. Always asking people who have been what they saw/experienced. Unfortunately not even those reanimated are able to give her any clues as to what lies beyond citing that ""there was nothing"" or it was ""just dark"". Nothing. 

***MY CURRENT THEoRY***: those resurrected - i.e. John snow and Beric Dondarrion - don't know because their bodies were not BURNED or ""FROZEN"" (left as is and taken over by the Night King) from the time they died to the time they were resurrected. If either of those things had happened their souls wouldn't have a place to go back to should they try to be resurrected. 

***BASIS oF CLAIM***: the characters of GoT might be divided on a lot of things but something that seems to be common throughout the world is the belief that the soul of a person cannot truly pass on to whatever is next until their body is BURNED. I pulled this theory specifically thinking about the time Daenerys sent her three bloodriders in different directions to see what was there and the one's horse came back with his severed head in the little satchel thingy. That one woman who knew him weeeept for him, saying that he wouldn't be with his ancestors because they didn't burn his body. There are countless other examples of this belief throughout the world of GoT including [insert whichever one you just thought of].  

***ADDITIoNALLY***: Now I don't know but I've been told (by Melisandre and others) that the lord of light has an army. My continued theory is that when bodies ARE burned they actually join the lord of lights' army while the rest become a soldier for The Night King, get buried**, or most likely just decompose. Now who's to say the LoL's army (LOL!) are the good guys idk cuz he defs did tell Melisandre to burn Stannis' daughter and that wasn't great. But in terms of the mystery behind the afterlife in GoT - see above.  

**I think that's why Bran saw Ned Stark in the crypt below Winterfell (a) cuz of classic three-eyed raven factor BUT MAINLY because (b) they buried him below Winterfell and very much did not burn his body. also his head was on a pike...

***Thank you for reading also please debunk - I care more about validity and genuinely want to know if I'm super off base on this one.***

40,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-3-1,2018,3,1,21,814x5k,self.gameofthrones,[Mod Raven] We're simplifying the spoiler tags  here's a summary,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/814x5k/mod_raven_were_simplifying_the_spoiler_tags_heres/,BWPhoenix,1519907554,"# TL;DR We'll have three tags - [No Spoilers] / [Official] / [Leaks]

#Back in the day
In early seasons, book readers and show watchers had their own discussions. Now, with the show surpassing the books, you'll notice very few people use the book tags. The divide is between people who have read leaks/production spoilers for the upcoming seasons and those who avoid them. We want to simplify the system to protect people from spoilers.

#What's changing?
We'll have three scopes.

* **[No Spoilers]** - For new watchers or those who are wary.
* **[Official]** - Basically everything, be it fan art or official casting news. Does not include production rumors/news or unofficial paparazzi photos. No leaked info will be allowed in these posts, full stop.
* **[Leaks]** - News sites now often report on what's been spotted on set. Fans even crawl over Spanish mountain ranges to get a peak. Thus, to protect fans who want to go in unspoiled and to accommodate others who like spoilers, we have [Leaks]. For obvious reasons, we will be extremely strict on title and thumbnail spoilers, **and they will be reviewed by a mod before going live.**

If, for example, you're avoiding trailers, just specify it in the body text of your post and we'll send any criminals to the Wall. The same principle applies to any other specific scope you want to set.

#Why the changes?
More and more Reddit users are on mobile and don't seek out the detailed spoiler guide  for understandable reasons. We wanted three tags that are intuitive just from seeing them on the front page. [Official] was the most popular result in our survey for replacing what used to be [Everything]. We think it's a good word to highlight to users that leaks are not okay in those posts. 

The way fans and the media interact with GoT has evolved, so the tags need to keep up. The sub isn't actually changing its stance on leaks much, but is definitely making it clearer. *Basically, we're making these changes because we want to keep the average watcher unspoiled.*

#When are the changes?
The tags are active now, but the old tags will work for a week after this post goes live. Then we'll be using the new system alone. 

#And finally
We're very much open to questions/suggestions in this post. We think we're basing this on what users want, but it's always a little hard to tell even with all our meta surveys (and thanks again for all the responses). It's a long Winter, but an important one.

People also contend that she failed to bring peace and Tyrion managed it within a few days and that shows how much better he is than her at that job. 


I, however, contend that the Meereenese failure was not due to any limitation on Dany's behalf - it was an impossible project to begin with. And no, Tyrion didn't succeed where she failed - in the timeframe given to them, there was no way for them to succeed at all. The writers just couldn't figure out how to convincingly end that arc, so they just pretended they'd succeeded and left it at that. 


Here's what was wrong with Meereen. Putting aside all talk of foreign invasion and respecting local culture, it was a city built on the bedrock of slavery. The city's economy, infrastructure, political power 
and wealth distribution were all built on slavery. What Dany was trying to do was to remove the foundation of slavery and yet, keep everything else intact. The Masters retained their wealth, they still had a lot of political clout, even in Dany's court and the infrastructure and economy were pretty much stalled. 

Removing slavery, but keeping everything it built was an impossible goal and it was only natural that the system would try to self-correct both legally and extra-legally. Legally, you had the emergence of alternate forms of slavery like wage-slavery or lifetime-contracts which would effectively be the same thing. Extra-legally, you had the insurgent groups being funded by the Masters and the foreign powers who wanted the old system restored in full. It didn't matter what Dany did to reconcile, integrate or placate - whether it was opening the pits or marrying a local - the system was slowly and surely sliding back towards the old status quo long before she rode off on Drogon. And Tyrion didn't arrest this slide either. He chose temporary peace and some propaganda, but he didn't propose any long term solution to the fundamental problems facing the city. It seemed like he was going for slow reform, but he had no actual plan on how to make it happen. And his policy regarding Yunkai and Astapor is still in limbo. I know he gave them 7 years to change as terms of his truce - but where does it stand now after they broke it? Do they still have 7 years? Do they have to stop slavery immediately now? Or can they continue as they have indefinitely? That was never addressed. 


After conquering Meereen, Dany had 2 options before her. She could've had peace right away if she only restored the status quo, i.e. let there be slaves again, even if you don't call it ""slavery"". Obviously, that option was unacceptable to her and her followers. The second was a complete overhaul of the system - setup a new political structure, redistribute the wealth, find a new basis for economy and rebuild the infrastructure from scratch. Whether she did it piecemeal or by obliterating the old system overnight, this was always going to be a long, costly and bloody road. The most optimistic scenario would've been a bloody and violent decade before her policies started showing results. More likely, an entire generation of Meereenese would've lived and died amidst violence, riots, economic devastation and starvation before things started improving. It might sound harsh, but when the alternative is to allow the continuation of an institution like slavery - in any shape or form - I'd say that the bloodshed is worth it. Rather than blaming Dany for failing Meereen by being too tyrannical, I think she failed because she wasn't tyrannical enough. In her war against slavery, she lost her momentum and no one else picked up the slack. 


But I know that a lot of people won't agree with this assessment. So, I'd like to discuss how another leader from GoT would've handled this situation. Put X in Dany's shoes as the ruler of Meereen, where X could be Robert/Ned/Tywin/Tyrion/Cersei/Jaime/Robb/Jon/Sansa/Olenna or any other leader you can think of. The only thing they share with Dany would be her commitment to eradicate slavery and make Meereen peaceful and prosperous. In light of the issues laid out, how do you think these people would make things better or worse?

I feel like considering this question raises so many interesting parallels, particularly between two characters who seem at odds; Jaime and Ned. Ned sacrificed his honour for the love of his sister, raising Jon and his own and tarnishing the reputation hed worked so hard to build his whole life. Even though the world saw him in a bad light, he knew deep down he done the right thing. The real honourable thing. Jamies killing of the Mad King was the same. An act that tarnished his reputation, far moreso than Ned, and yet if Jaime didnt take the hit for this thousands of people would have died. It was the most honourable thing he could have done, even if the world he lives in doesnt see it that way.

Both characters are flawed in that they choose love over honour. Jaime sacrifices his honour over and over for the sake of Cersei. He pushes Bran out the window. He kills his cousin to try break free. He does everything to be with her, and its her influence that keeps corrupting him. Ned, to a lesser extent, does the same thing; he lies and proclaims Joffrey as the true heir, sacrificing his morals for the love is his daughter. Hes scared for Sansas sake and thinks being granted mercy will help her through all this.

Which is why Jaime finally walking away from Cersei and deciding to fight the White Walkers is so damn powerful. It even kind of mirrors Ned walking away from Robert when he orders Dany to be killed. These characters become heroes because theyre able to do the right thing regardless of this love. Ned, by raising Jon as his own, was doing the most honourable thing he could, even if it meant he had to lie to his best friends and not support his killing of Targaryens. So when Jaime finally walks away from Cersei, hes being just as honourable as Ned Stark, who was the pinnacle of honour his whole life; Jaimes finally living up to what he could be. He refuses to choose love over honour anymore, and finally chooses what is morally right. His development is nothing short of amazing.",30,27,False,spoiler,,,,,

After completing a recent series re-watch, I noticed something that might take that idea a bit further.  It seems to me that the direction the pendant points might also suggest a ""political compass"" of sorts, as each hand typically not only favored a specific shoulder, but a specific positioning the hand is pointing.
-Ned's always pointed true south
-Tywin's pointed South East
-Qyburn South East
-Tyrion when Joff's Hand: SE
-Tyrion as Dany's Hand: SW
-Kevan: SW

Best I could come up with in terms of the vectors significance would be West indicates a service to the realm, East indicating service toward family/power/personal ambition.  This makes particular sense for Tyrion as with Joffrey he was still on ""team Lannister"" and is now on Team Breaker of Chains. Ned's true south direction I suppose could mean that his concerns for the realm were in balance with his concern for his family/his personal honor, as one could argue his intentions were pure when investigating the legitimacy of Joffrey but ultimately this proved to be damaging to the stability of the realm.

Apologies if this has been pointed out before. I searched and didn't see anything other than the shoulder positioning and I found it interesting.",4,11,False,spoiler,,,,,

After season 6, what were the options open to Littlefinger to further advance his position and get his ultimate goal of sitting on the Iron Throne. Or having a proxy sit on it. 


The way I see it, the Lannisters were a dead end for him. Even if he'd somehow convinced the Vale to turn on Sansa and brought Cersei her head, he'd risen as high he could've under their patronage. He could've hoped to control the North and the Vale right now, but not as a Lannister lackey and Cersei wouldn't have given him any more power. 


But the North wasn't as secure as he'd hoped either. He could've hoped to control it if Sansa had remained the only Stark around - but one by one others kept coming out of the woodworks. Both Jon and Arya distrusted him and that was unlikely to change and Bran was the biggest curveball ever. And even Sansa was growing out of his control. And then there was the WW threat that was surely going to be a problem. 


I think LF's strategy going into season 7 was, broadly, to push Sansa to the top somehow and get her to rebel against Cersei. But with unexpected complications coming up one after the other, he should've stepped back and re-evaluated his options. 


So, was there an alternate path available to him that could've ended with him on the throne and married to Sansa? Or was he doomed the moment he threw his lot in with the Starks?",37,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

So we see Jaime reach the Targaryen/Stark group at the start of the season, and he directly goes to see Tyrion. He goes into Tyrion's room and he tells him what Cersei has done and that she plans on betraying them, and Tyrion tell Jaime that he knows and that during the conversation that they had in the 7th episode S07 they decided together that they would play everyone else in order to finally make the Lannisters as powerful as the Targaryens once were creating a dynasty that would last generations. Now I have two possible foreshadowings supporting this theory. The first is during the conversation between Cersei and Tyrion, he says that he has always done whats best for his family, now this could be him reminding Cersei of what he did in the first seasons or it could be a slight insight into why he made such bad tactical decisions (not really sure about that, I think he's just bad at warfare and Cersei is the combination of Tyrion and Jaime, but thats besides the point) or on the other hand (or extension if you believe that hes been bad the whole time) it might be foreshadowing a betrayal by Tyrion (""for blood"" as the prophecy from season 1/Mirri Maz Duur foretold) where in the end Tyrion sides with his family rather than a foreign queen. And the second foreshadowing is his look that he gives Dany and Jon at the very end when he's in the shadows looking at them, like that disregard from her side to be with Jon regardless of anything else cemented it for him that he did the right thing betraying Dany and siding with his family.

At the time, I think that the three ""biggest"" names on her list were Joffrey, Tywin, and Cersei. How would things have turned out if she had chosen them instead? 

I think the biggest change would have been that Stannis would have definitely taken King's Landing, and maybe even the Iron Throne as well. At that point, he had already killed Renly so Highgarden wouldn't have come to the aide of King's Landing or to fight Stannis. I don't know of any direct qualms that Dorne would have had with Stannis, so I would theorize that Oberyn wouldn't have ever come to King's Landing. Especially because if Stannis got his hands on the Mountain, I doubt he would have lived. 

He wouldn't have allowed Robb to be King in the North, but I could see Robb going either way. I could see Robb still rebelling and trying to be King, but I could also see him having the sense to bend the knee. I don't think that Jaime would have gotten back to KL, because Roose Bolton only handed him over because he was afraid of Tywin (as far as I know, but that could be wrong). 

The more I type, the more I realize was dependent on those three figures living. It's so intriguing to theorize how things would have turned out differently. What do you guys think? ",13,7,False,spoiler,,,,,

Now, as we know there are Four Horsemen: Death, Conquest, War and Famine.


1.**DEATH** 

The Night King is obviously representing Death, with him controlling undead forces and being a master necromancer. I think this one needs close no explanation.



2.**CONQUEST**

Daenerys is representing Conquest, because the Targaryens are quite fond of conquering. She's an obvious parallel to Aegon the Conqueror, from being ''born'' in Essos and coming to conquer Westeros with 3 dragons.


3.**WAR**

Jon Snow is representing War. Think about it, Jon has done nothing but fight his whole life; dealing with the issue of being a bastard, not having a mother, joining the Nights Watch and after that a literal war against wildlings/The Others and their wights and the Boltons. As luck has it, he is wielding a Valyrian Steel sword, which is described as an ideal warriors weapon. Oh and he's quite good at warring too.



4.**FAMINE**

Cersei is representing Famine. I'd say she represents control, with her thirst for power. Famine is a very important tool for control.As we have seen, she completely disregards the needs of the smallfolk, from making them hunger for religion, to actual famine. She would starve her population economically or literally to both save herself and to maintain her elite status. As a result, everything she touches withers and dies.",34,33,False,spoiler,,,,,

So basically my theory goes is that Jon learns that Cersei betrayed them and chooses to go to KL himself (via Drogon or Rhaegal), and try to reason with Cersei and make once last chance for Peace.

It will fail of course and Jon will be killed by the Mountain, Illyn Payne (if he even comes back), or some Lannistwrs soldiers (with the Dragon being killed by Lannister soldiers). And his body is send to WF as a warning, later when Beric and Tormund return from the wall Beric will gives his soul to Jon via the last kiss bringing him back.

The reason I think this is because it was foreshadowed last season when Sansa told Arya that his heart would stop when he saw her.",17,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Every episode is great, from getting to see the fantastic dynamic between Arya and the hound, to perhaps the most intense, high-stakes battle in the show (The mountain and the viper). 
#2 Season 3: The initial hook that grabbed me and Im sure most viewers of the show. Not only are we introduced to characters like Tormund and Daario, but we get to see Dany at her most badass when claiming the unsullied. And not to mention the red wedding
#3 Season 1: The introduction to the series is nothing short of amazing. Closest to the source material, this season does a masterful job of showing Neds journey to discovering the secret of Cercei and Jaimes incest, and his shocking demise.
#4 Season 5: Hardhome marks the possibly the biggest turning point in the show, and the build up is spectacular. However, I think the scenes with Arya at the house of black and white tend to be a little dull at times
#5 Season 6: Although its the first season that D &amp; D did without GRRM, I still find it great. Jons journey back to Winterfell and Theons redemption are a joy to watch. The writing does however, does start to take a turn in the wrong direction.
#6 Season 2: although still very close to the source material, and everything is still beyond entertaining to watch; after the battle of the  blackwater Im left feeling like Westerosi politics remain, for the most part the same, and Im left feeling like the Season doesnt accomplish much. But this season does contain one my favorite scenes in the entire show (Theons monologue to Luwin in ep 10)
#7 Season 7: an obvious choice. Still great television but to me it felt rushed and the writing wasnt nearly what it used to be. ",5,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Id go with episode 2 of season 7. This season was a rough one. The whole capturing a wight did that for me. But this episode felt like old game of thrones. Seeing Daenerys give Varys a little interrogation was well needed. I also, at first, liked the idea that Daenerys and Jon would team up. Qyburn showing Cersei the ballista gave me faith that this fight wasnt so single sided. Jon getting aggressive with Baelish was a great scene too. 

But nothing made this episode better than Euron attacking Ellaria and Yara. Will admit, it was pretty great to see two sand snakes die. Ellaria was affectively dead too, which didnt hurt at all. And Alfie Allens acting as Theon in that episode was just incredible.

Anyway I just finished the series (fucking amazing) and am curious to see what role Cersei will play in season 8. Other than hopefully growing her hair out again

The main question I have is: Do you think there is redemption for Cersei in s8? I was almost convinced she was going to have Jaime killed in the last ep, it would have completed her fall into true evil - murdering her brother and lover because he finally defied her. However, the fact that she did not tells us that she still isn't ""fully"" evil. She also did not kill Tyrion, although imo his life was never really in danger. 

Do you think she is really pregnant? If so is it Euron's or Jaime's? With the iron bank's army she can still fight, but against the rest of her living family and most of westeros, will she? ",15,7,False,spoiler,,,,,

My hunch is that this is a foreshadowing of Arya marrying Gendry (they had to bring him back for a reason) and that Gendry could possibly end up on the iron throne, hence the ""your sons will be princes""...  - We all have seen evidence of foreshadowing coming true, like when Sam says Jon always comes back (comes back from the dead) or in the pilot with the dead dire wolf and stag (Ned and king Robb's death) ... And if you argue that this means that Dany and Jon would probably have to be dead for Gendry to be king, then yeah they probably will die... don't forget george rr martins ""bittersweet ending"" remark.

And who are you, the proud King said, that I must bow so low? Only a cat of the same coat, that's the truth I know. Coated in Blood. The Imp still has claws, And mine are long and sharp, your grace, as long and sharp as yours.

And so he spoke, and so he spoke, The King in the North. But now the fire burns his hall, with everyone there to hear. Yes now the fire burns his hall, and all souls will hear.

Tyrion to Jon Snow when Golden Company sack Winterfell in Episode 3

Brienne has a child with Jaime. She granted Casterly Rock. Brienne's last scene is with Arya. She releases Brienne from hers vows. Arya gives Widows Wail to Brienne. Its exactly like the Jon/Jorah scene from episode 6.

Golden Company stay in Kings Landing after The Great War. They help rebuild the city, even the dragonpit(Drogon Survives). Their are now 2 iron thrones, King and Queen hold Tyrion's trial. Everyone gives their suggestions for his execution. Bran gives Aegon Ned's Quote from the Pilot. ""The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword"". The King beheads Tyrion.

Dany has her baby a boy named Jon after his father. Arya &amp; Brienne have scene. Arya and Bran will rebuild Winterfell with Gendry's help. King Aegon gives Bronn Castile Black.

Archmaester Ebrose meets with King Aegon and Sam. Ebrose brings with him a song of ice and fire. A history of the last 24 years in Westeros. King Aegon reads from the book.

Fade to Credits The End.

Note: Jon vs Night King has not been choreographed yet by the stunt coordinator. It may be 3 months before they start stunt training. So IDK how that will play out. I do know Jon, Dany and Bran survive the fight but Melisandre does not survive.

Jaime and Cersei's death has not been shot yet. Probably won't happen until June. Arya blowing up The Red Keep will be shot at the beginning of May.

Here are the target dates

Episode 1. Winterfell 1/13/19 8C/9E

Episode 2. Blood of The Dragon 1/20/19 8C/9E

Episode 3. Iron Price 1/27/19 8C/9E

So, this theory only works with the other theory of Daenerys being Azor Ahai. In the books, lightbringer, the sword of legend was made of a rigorous process. First forged for 20 days, then cooled in water, however it shattered. Then forged for 50 days and cooled in the heart of a lion, but shattered. The last, forged for 100 days then cooled in the blood of Azor Ahais wife, and finally, lightbringer was made.

My theory of Daeneryss lightbringer relates to her dragons. Her first dragon, killed and sent to a watery grave, just like Azor Ahais first sword. I predict that Daeneryss second dragon, Rhagael, will be killed by a Lannister, such as shattered in the blood of a lion and finally, Drogon will be killed by Daenerys herself to create a kind of lightbringer, just like Azor Ahai killing his loved one, to finally end the whitewalker threat. 

Sure this theory has a bunch of holes, but it may be pieced together somehow, and I think it would be real cool if it was all true.",22,23,False,spoiler,,,,,

The way we're shown this is by the small patch of scaly skin he has where the Stoneman grabbed him. 

And it just occurred to me that if the cure for Greyscale is just to peel the affected skin off and apply an ointment, then the disease should be a non-issue. As soon as someone contracts it, the Maester peels the patch off and applies the ointment. 

And apparently the cure wasn't exactly a secret, considering the head of the Citadel knew about it already, he just wouldn't allow Sam to use it because it was too dangerous (for a full-blown case like Jorah). This raises a few questions including 

- Why is Greyscale such a massive issue if the cure is so simple? 

- Why have the Maesters kept this simple sure under wraps for so long? 

- Why was it so difficult to find someone to help Shireen with her Greyscale?

Anyway, I've been reading through the first book and I'm currently really enjoying it. I'm about on page 140, so I still have like 700 pages to go. But, I really love my Illustrated Edition version of the book, as it's well made and the pictures help me imagine the scene better in my head. 

Only problem is that I have no clue if they plan on releasing future illustrated editions for the sequels.

Because he assumed the worst about her.

276,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-3-5,2018,3,5,9,822294,self.gameofthrones,[OFFICIAL] Sansa Stark's fate,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/822294/official_sansa_starks_fate/,JackStargaryen,1520210834,"Now Sansa Stark is a character that has grown, She has whined from an annoying little girl into a much more likeable and strong leader, and now with LF finally out of the picture and surviving through years of abuse from the Lannisters (minus Tyrion) and the Boltons she has returned home and has adopted the Stark colours finally. So it will be interesting to see where she goes next season, But what will happen to her? Well I believe that Sansa will die next season now before you call me crazy I will give you my evidence and then explain how I think it will go down:

- First up we need to establish each Stark direwolf represents each of there fates or where there story is headed. First Jon's direwolf Ghost is white and the Runt representing Jon's ""Bastard"" Lineage with the white fur maybe Forshadowing for Jon being a Targaryen as Targs have white blonde hair, Grey Wind Robb's direwolf was killed and we know what happened to Robb now the Direwolves name I can't find a connection to it that related to anything that happened in Robb's story yet so if anyone can help me on this one please do, Rickon named his Shaggydog which means Rickon's story in books and show is a Shaggydog story, Summer Bran's Direwolf died in the tree with Bran (metaphorically) and also his name Summer means Bran could be the one to bring the end of Winter and the Dream of Spring/Summer, and Arya named her Direwolf Nymeria who is now a wild Direwolf like how Arya is wild and like Nymeria Arya may lead her own pack someday. Sansa's Direwolf is named Lady who of course symbolises Sansa being a Lady but the fact the Direwolf died could mean Sansa will die.

- With the way the show is going there is no more room for Political players like LF or Olenna, With the true threat coming Words will not stop the WW's which means the Writers may want to kill off Sansa as there will not be much for her to do.

- Sansa has had a lot of close calls with death, Maybe it will not be for this time.

- A lot of people think Sansa will live to the end, Which is a Plus for the possibility of her dying.

- There has been some Forshadowing for this, In Season 5 Sansa tells Ramsey to just kill her already I can't remember what she said exactly but it was something like that also in Season 7 when she tells Arya that she has men loyal to her Arya replies that they are not here right now which could mean nobody will be there to protect her.

So how will this go down well one of two ways, Either with the WW""s pushing Jon and Dany's forces back I think one of the Wagons carrying Citizens will have Sansa in it, It will be attack and Sansa will get wounded by a WW Arya will come in and save Sansa from the WW with the Dagger she will try to carry her away from the battle but Sansa will make Arya leave before they can kill her too, Sansa would then either bleed out or the NK will find her and finish her off. Or at some point when the Lannisters or GC attack both Arya and Sansa will be left behind and Sansa will put Arya on the last horse and has her ride off while Sansa stays to be taken hostage to KL, Where she would be beheaded under orders from Cersei (paralleling her father).",32,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Why?

To my understanding, it's so Ned can go be the hand of the king where Littlefinger can manipulate him because of his honor.

But shortly into their relationship Littlefinger makes his intentions clear to Ned, so what gives?

I understand that he has to call audibles. But was his intended plan? I'm not clear on this and it seems to be pretty important.

Arya goes to KL to kill Cersei. She gets caught and is put on trial. She choses trial by combat. Jon offers to be her champion as does Brienne and Jorah. However they would be considered acts of wars if they so so. So Arya says she will be her own champion. Meanwhile the Hound is moping around KL. Seeing the commotion regarding the trial, he goes to the trial by combat. Arya fights the Mountain. At first she does good but the Mountain gets the better of her. Befire he kills her, the Hound steps forward and enters the fray. Now the fight gets interesting and real gritty like Dan Dority and the the Captain in Deadwood or Vorenus vs final Gladitor in Rome. Finally the Hound uses fire to burn Mountain before gorging out his eyes. Mountain finally dead. Hound fatally wounded. He asks Arya for wine. Drinks it and tells her to do it. She stabs him in the heart. Last words are "" I guess im finally off your list"" or ""Im glad it was you who did it."" What do you think.

The more popular ones I've seen are always Charles Dance as Tywin, Conleth Hill as Varys, Aidan Gillen as Littlefinger, Sophie Turner as Sansa, Rory McCann as Sandor, Liam Cunningham as Davos, Stephen Dillane as Stannis, Jack Gleeson as Joffrey, etc. But now I'd like to focus on characters that either died a while ago or don't get as much love and/or mainstream attention, but were portrayed by actors who fit their character really well naturally and/or did an incredible job bringing them to life. Below are some examples of these type of characters that I feel were incredibly well-cast, but please let me know what you think as well!


James Cosmo as Jeor Mormont - When reading the books Cosmo looks exactly as I pictured LC Mormont in my head. His old bear-ish appearance, the way he speaks, his mannerisms, etc. He just really looked like a guy who seems well-respected, a seasoned veteran, and deserving of the title of Lord Commander.

Jason Momoa as Khal Drogo - Momoa has become increasingly popular in the mainstream in recent years, but even so I feel like his performance as Drogo is often overlooked when it comes to the best performances on the show. Momoa isn't just great for Khal Drogo, in my mind he is an incredibly accurate representation of the Dothraki people as a whole. His intensity, body language, and of course his appearance exemplify everything the Dothraki are about. Savageness, strong leadership and stubbornness. Not to mention Momoa did a New Zealand Haka in his audition tape, which when you watch will make you automatically understand why he got the role of Drogo.

Anton Lesser as Qyburn - I wouldn't say Lesser took my vision of Qyburn to life, but rather he created a version of Qyburn performed so well that when I think back to the books I can't picture him any other way. He does an incredible job of portraying Qyburn as a somewhat nerdy, mad scientist (perhaps best exemplified in the S7 Dragon Pit scene when he sees the wight for the first time) while also invoking enough charisma to rise up through the ranks and be a loyal sidekick to a ruthless ruler. I get some serious Darth Sidious vibes from Qyburn too.

Gemma Whelan as Asha/Yara Greyjoy - Despite the fact that I feel the show royally screwed up the entire Ironborn plot, Whelan's portrayal of Asha/Yara has been one of the lone bright spots of this part of the show. She has great chemistry with Alfie Allen, as well as all the other Iron men who she commands respect from. She did a great job letting her humorous side shine through, and also does a great job of portraying a tomboy-ish girl who has abandoned almost all femininity.

Julian Glover as Pycelle - Fun fact, Roy Dotrice (narrator of the audiobooks, also plays the pyromancer in S2) was actually supposed to play Pycelle but had to back out late due to health concerns. Although I'm sure I would've enjoyed seeing Pycelle mispronounce names (Bry-eeeeene, Pehtiiiire, Dam-fair), Glover does a really really good job of portraying a sickly old man. His hunched-over posture, always sounding like there's something stuck in his throat, his reaction to Tyrion's punishing of him in S2, it's all amazing. You really get the vibe that he's sort of a joke, and often times it's really comical. Plus, the deleted scene with Pycelle and Tywin adds a lot to the Pycelle character, and I thought Glover did an incredible job rapidly shifting his posture, attitude and voice here.

Kate Dickie as Lysa Arryn - When I met Dickie at last summer's Con of Thrones, I was flabbergasted to hear just how strong of a Scottish accent she has. She truly sounds absolutely nothing like her character, which is a testament to her acting chops and ability to get into character. Dickie did a great job playing the stereotypical ""crazy bitch,"" and she was a stark contrast to the portrayal of Catelyn (see what I did there). Whereas I felt Catelyn exhibits poise (most of the time at least), intelligence and lady-like qualities, Dickie's Lysa truly felt like an off-the-rails, B-grade Tully compared to her sister. You could really see ultra levels of paranoia on Lysa's face, as well as a deep layer of envy towards Catelyn that is present in both S1 and S4.

Tom Wlaschiha as Jaqen H'ghar - One of the high points of S2 was the chemistry between Wlashchiha and Maisie Williams. I can't say if the same magic is present in S5 or S6, but considering Wlaschiha is really just a surrogate Kindly Man from the books, and considering the butchering of the faceless men plot in the show, I'm leaving my analysis strictly to the Jaqen H'ghar in S2 as the rest of the stuff could be attributed to the writers. Wlashchiha does an excellent job of portraying Jaqen as a seemingly calm, soft-spoken and generally nice bloke, despite there obviously being a lot more under the surface. I think Wlashchiha does a good job of this too, as despite what he seems, you always get the feeling there's something much darker underneath. He embodied the character from the books. In particular, his pleading with Arya to unname him is one of the best moments of S2.

##[(link to original post)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/814x5k/mod_raven_were_simplifying_the_spoiler_tags_heres/)

After eating much humble pie, we'll be trialling [Spoilers] as the go-to tag rather than [Official]. [Main] was the other option being considered, but we're going to try [Spoilers] first (and hopefully last).

If you'd like the full info on the spoiler changes, you can check the **[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/814x5k/mod_raven_were_simplifying_the_spoiler_tags_heres/)**. Keeping this one to the basics:

#The three tags are:

* **[No Spoilers]** - For new watchers or those who are wary.

* **[Spoilers]** - Basically everything, be it fan art or official casting news. Does not include production rumors/news or unofficial paparazzi photos. No leaked info will be allowed in these posts, full stop.

* **[Leaks]** - News sites now often report on what's been spotted on set. Fans even crawl over Spanish mountain ranges to get a peak. Thus, to protect fans who want to go in unspoiled and to accommodate others who like spoilers, we have [Leaks]. For obvious reasons, we will be extremely strict on title and thumbnail spoilers, and they will be reviewed by a mod before going live.

And some other details:

* The old tags will still work for 48 hours after this post is live, including [Official]
* We'll be manually approving posts tagged [Leaks]
* No leaks, even under comment tags, are allowed in [Spoilers] 

*We're still very much open to feedback on these changes.*",20,40,False,spoiler,,,,,

I just thought that there would be a previous plan in place rather than the wall being brought down by ice-dragon fire. Viserion is with Dany for 6 entire seasons in Essos, nowhere near the wall. During that entire time the army of the dead is constantly moving southwards. Then she comes to westeros, the night king is still going south. Jon Snowbro and Co. go to 'kidnap a wight' past the wall and the nights king is hot on their heels, cornering them. Dany and her dragons go to save the day, and suddenly the nights king has found his way past the wall, it's come flying up to him on a plate.

IDK it just irked me a little bit, I would have thought there was a plan in place, that something else would have happened. I'm not saying it wasn't an entertaining thing to watch, just that it didn't seem like how this massive moment, YEARS in the making, would have panned out.

It's a popular theory that just makes so much sense. You can read about it online just about anywhere. The only confusing part is what Sansa's direwolves fate is trying to tell us. I believe the secret has been laying in plain sight all along with telling clues as to how it happens. It may sound unbelievable but we all know how GRRM writes and this is a fantasy show where anything can happed. So here it is.... 

I think at some point during battle Ned will be resurrected as a wight and kill Sansa, or Arya will have to make the choice to kill her father again with her Catspaw dagger or save her sister, possible getting herself killed instead. It sounds a little out there but it's very possible and here's why.

-Neds remains where brought back to Caitlyn to be buried in the crypts. It seems like the Crypts of winterfell are emphasized so much in the show for a reason. Is so possible they are setting us up for this great reveal in season 8 where a few if not everyone is raised up from the dead. 

-The whole show is surrounded by Neds death and honor. Ofter Arya and Sansa think and talk of Ned but not their mother and Brother. They meet in the cripts of winterfell infront of Neds statue and talk about how much they miss him, and how they are the only ones alive who knows his face.

-The whole controversy surrounding Arya and Sansa started with the Direwolves. Aryas was suppose to be the one executed but Sansa's took its place. Sansa told Arya ""It would have been you they executed.""

-Ned Stark was the one to kill the wolf, which might mean he will be the one to kill Sansa or Arya. 

-You could reverse it and say, since Arya's wolf was meant to die all along not Sansas, so she could sacrifice herself to save Sansa which would be a nice twist since they have built up so much surrounding the sisters and their father.

-At one point Sansa says, ""No one can save me, No one can save anyone."" Could be a reference Arya. 
 
-Or Sansa could be killed by him before Arya can get to her. Sansa has survived so much and to be killed that way would be a epic way to go out. It's like your starting all over.

-Arya has a huge part to play in the war to come with that dagger, and I think this would just be another sad moment for a character who loves her father as much as she does. 

This is the first time I've heard this theory, so there is not much evidence surrounding it. I'm sure you guy can dig up more stuff but as of now I really think this is a possibility. ",31,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

This initial conceptual idea changed as GRRM started writing. While it may offer hints of things still to come, it is more likely that paths that GRRM started down as he started writing the books diverged from this early plan. That is to be expected.

But Martin also says this about himself: ""As you know, I don't outline my novels. I find that if I know exactly where a book is going, I lose all interest in writing it. "" Hmmm...

GRRM is stuck: He did give D+D where this story would end. The HBO Series is way more detailed than an outline. Now he has to write the remaining story completely different from the show (which is an unusual place for an author like GRRM to be) or follow the show (which I would imagine would be tediously boring to GRRM). The success of the show has become a trap for the author of the books.

Unless the books take a completely different path from the show (which would be interesting, especially if D+D give us a lame ending), I suspect GRRM will never finish the final book himself. It seems even *Winds of Winter* may not be released till after Season 8. After he passes, his estate may well have others finish the book(s) for him.  ",42,15,False,spoiler,,,,,

I believe he will stay in too long and will almost ""Drown"", But Howland Reed (yes I think Howland Reed needs to show up before the end) will go in and save him and will however die in the process.

Evidence:

- Jojen told Bran in S4 that he can't stay in there for too long

- 3ER tells Bran the Ocean is beautiful, stay down for too long however and you'll drown or something like that.

- Howland Reed has too appear he has been mentioned so many times, Appeared in the Tower of Joy in S6, and finally he was the one who send Jojen and Meera and we need to learn why. If Howland was not important he would not have been shown in S6.",5,11,False,spoiler,,,,,

If you were to ask me in 2017 what reddit was, I would likely be humiliated by my response. Honestly, everything leading up to 2018 is practically meaningless to me now, and I do not say that cold-heartedly. I simply state this bold proclamation because my eyes were recently opened, my soul was recently cleansed, and my spirit has discovered a new-found admiration. I have always been a fan of entertainment; it was something that raised me, inspired me, and influenced me everyday. I happen to have a vast amount of critical opinions on various films, productions, shows, and documentaries. I am no acclaimed film critic by any means, nor do I wish to be. I just want to talk about how awesome Game of Thrones is. Like, seriously. The show astonishes me in so many different ways on so many different levels, and because of that I cannot genuinely compare or contrast it upon any other production. Lord of the Rings is often compared to Game of Thrones for obvious reasons, but the cold hard truth is that J.R.R. Tolkiens classic no longer competes with the reborn story of A Song of Ice and Fire. This may be a hot take, but know that this is coming from a 21 year old with a LotR poster on his wall; the reality of this sucks for me too :( lol. I have become the biggest advocate of Game of Thrones since I began watching it this year, and I think my bandwagon fanboy-ness is starting to lowkey annoy my friends. Sorry not sorry guys. Every aspect of this show is superior to any bit of film I have ever witnessed though, and I say this with the upmost confidence. The origin, casting, acting, scenery, storylines, cinematography, special effects, alchemy, witchcraft, fire-breathing dragons, love scenes, fighting scenes, jousting scenes, ughhh, pretty much all scenes are spectacular! I recommend this to anyone who is seriously looking for something to get into. You can be like me and completely geek out on it, or you can watch it purely for enjoyment. Everything about the series is appealing and it only gets better as you progress through the story. Like I said, it's kind of surreal for me to be on reddit right now, and the fact that i'm talking about Game of Thrones is even more bizarre. But this show is seriously on another level when it comes to cinematography and it is now making me speak out of character. It will change you, for real; and I promise it will be worth it! We can justify all of this talk of superiority by the number of Emmy and Golden Globe wins and nominations it has received, but that would just be rubbing it in the face of the rest of the film industry. The thing I admire most about this series is that every character provokes you to feel a certain way about them, and the exceptional script writing always keeps you entertained with unpredictable plots and twists you shouldn't miss. Watch it while you can, fore winter is coming!",18,8,False,self,,,,,

A few days later, when a fan was quizzing GRRM, he slyly replied ""Oh, you think he's dead, do you?"" More recently, GRRM has hinted at Jon being a fire wight (he talks about poor Berric, and going back to the whole ice and fire thing when he mentioned this). Dave/Dan have also said they consider the Night King not to be a person, but death itself. I suspect they're all enjoying these cryptic messages. I wonder if Jon or the Night King kill each other, if this will destroy all the magic in the realm - killing Dani and her dragons, and the fire that keeps both Dany and Jon alive - that shockwave that came out in a spoiler, and if this is why the Night King is not interested in killing Jon, but more interested in killing anyone (Bran) who would be able to help Jon find the key to killing him. This would explain the sudden emergence south, the trigger was probably Jon's birth. This might explain the bittersweet ending - and a dream of spring is a world without magic - where Jon and Dani's miracle baby is the reference to bittersweet (a common theme at the end of wars is the children who will survive). The Azor Ahai prophecy has an interesting ending that everyone seems to be ignoring: ""death itself will bend its knee, and all those who die fighting in his/her cause shall be reborn."" Note again, ""death itself will bend the knee"" and the showrunners refer to the Night King as death rather than a character. Will they really resurrect/reanimate everyone who dies fighting with Jon/Dani? I doubt it. But it is an interesting line.",1,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

He promised them ""this"", and when they asked what ""this"" is, he told them ""You shall become the new lords of the Vale"". Telling them for centuries the Vale has spat upon the hilltribes. He told them he thinks it's time for new rulers of the Vale. That is the key thing that made the stonecrows, burned men, Black Ears, Moon Brothers...etc, join up with Tyrion. The trinkets and steel they were given was just the appetizer. 

There's going to be power struggle with the Vale now that Petyr is dead. House Royce mentioned they were only there for Sansa, not John. They seemed annoyed that a great house was seemingly now following the orders of a King in the North whom they barely knew. I suspect they will leave Winterfell, going back to the Vale, and there's gonna be chaos over who becomes Lord Protector. Robyn will not take the news of Uncle Petryrs execution well, I actually suspect he will declare war on the North for what they did to Petyr. He was the only person Robyn would listen to, and was manipulated masterfully into loving Baelish. He literally has no one else, Sansa was the only one, but she's not going to go back to the Vale. 

This is where Dany will gain the Vale, as her hand just happens to have a very special relationship with thousands of clansmen all remembering what they were promised.

We've speculated as to what that can mean to no end, but I have another theory.


Jon is as reluctant as a leader can possibly be. He's been chosen to lead, and he feels obligated to protect his people. But with the current events - like his true bloodline and the couple of people who know about it - isn't it at all possible he never finds out who he really is? You'd have a somewhat poetic ending to his character if you went that route.


With the Night King flying around on his dragon, straight toward Winterfell, the knowledge regarding Jon is in harm's way.


Now if Dany dies, as a lot of people think she will, Jon would more than likely be the last man standing to take the Iron Throne. But again, he's reluctant because A)He doesn't want the role and B)He most likely doesn't feel he deserves it as he is a bastard.


I just think it would be interesting to have Jon sit on the throne, thinking he doesn't deserve it and he doesn't want it, yet we know that it is his rightful place.",23,21,False,spoiler,,,,,

I mean trapping a wight and transporting it all the way to King's Landing is crazy enough, but the idea that literally anything could win Cersei over to Team Jon/Dany seemed idiotic. If anyone should know that wouldn't work, it should be Tyrion.

Maybe he knew full well it wouldn't convince Cersei. What if the plan all along was to undermine Jamie's relationship with Cersei. He knew Jamie would surely be there to see the wight and knows that Jamie is infinitely more reasonable than Cersei is. There's two big gets from this for Tyrion:

1) **Jamie:** a competent field commander, effective liege lord of the Westerlands, and Tyrion's beloved big bro. 

2) **An even more unstable Cersei:** In S7 Jamie is the only ounce of rationality Cersei has left in her life. Taking Jamie away would not only hurt her emotionally (maybe?), but would also be a huge blow to the sanity of KL's leadership. This might make her an easier foe to conquer. Remember Tyrion preaches non-violence the whole season, effectively crippling Dany's #1 asset (the dragons). But if Cersei goes full-on Vlad the Impaler inside KL, then the commonfolk might happily welcome Dany's dragonfire as the lesser of two evils. 

Maybe Tyrion is re-arranging the pieces of the cyvasse board to make better use of Dany's strengths.

One remaining question:

**Why hide this from Jon and Dany?** It's possible that they wouldn't think Jamie was worth all this effort, but Tyrion does. That's his big bro, and maybe he feels like he owes it to Jamie. Remember Jamie helped Varys save Tyrion's life by freeing him from the Red Keep. Tyrion might be trying to do the same for Jamie. Tyrion also uniquely understands the repercussions of removing Jamie from Cersei's life.

Edit: I feel like I should clarify that the probability of this being true is slim. As other have pointed out, it would require the writers to be a lot more competent than they've been in the past. This is more just some personal headcanon that allows me to retain some respect for Tyrion in the show.",43,338,False,spoiler,,,,,

https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/mar/25/richard-iii-dna-tests-uncover-evidence-of-further-royal-scandal

This is only one of many twists and turns in the way the throne was handed down - traditionally the legitimate lineage was the male line through marriage (although there may be other legitimate ways too?) however deviations from this were frequent also lineage is obviously a concern high on Danys agenda as we have seen

As well as the above recent discovery its worth noting that William the Conqueror was actually a bastard 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_the_Conqueror

William Snow ?

So legitimate also depends on the size of ur army, skill and luck

In this regards this suggests Cersei is in with a good chance unless of course death eg The Night King claims her

EDIT: Consensus from comments suggests many more specific variables that may influence taking the throne such as conquest (pretty related to size of ur army), current political climate at the time, parliament/laws etc and of course lineage but for me lineage is a difficult one because there are so many twists and turns in the handover of the crown based on lineage - the male child line from marriage was traditionally the legitimate claim but this was very often not the case in real history

EDIT 2: Another user pointed out that legitimacy is what gives you a sizeable army - to add to this legitimacy has often historically been based on lineage (although not the only factor) so lineage does matter - however my argument would be that lineage is a perception often not necessarily based on hard facts - so those that can put forward the most widely believed arguments amongst the most powerful houses could win - skill and luck come into play",33,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

The books and show mention this multiple times but never really give too much attention to it (except for stannis but everyone knew he wasnt the right guy) so I started running through my head a list of characters Ive seen that could be Azor Ahai reborn and there towards the bottom of the list, I thought of one I havent seen many theories surrounding...Gendry. A lot of people overlook this character as a possible promised prince because of him being base born but remember folks...Kings and queens can legitimize bastards. So for all intents and purposes, Gendry is a prince. Now its told that Azor Ahai must forge his weapon by killing someone he/she loved with it so this theory is that in S8, Gendry and Arya will have a bunch of flirtations that turn out to be love; Jon, Dany, and the dragons all die leaving Gendry to lead with Davos and Jaime advising him (Jaime is offered command but knows he is not a leader but a soldier); Jon legitimizes Gendry from his deathbed (similar to scene with Robert giving the regency to Ned); Gendry will kill Arya fulfilling the prophecy and making him Azor Ahai reborn; and Gendry defeats the night king and his army (his dragon was defeated by Jon and Dany) and becomes king of Westeros.
Now do I think this is a likely ending for the show? Absolutely not. This would involve a ton of character development and setup that would just look sloppy packing into one final season. I just thought Id share an interesting idea I had. I do think that Gendry may end up being legitimized and ruling in the end. When the show brought him back into the fold, I couldnt really think of any reason why other than to have him end up as king. He could just be an attempted love plot for Arya but that would suck if that was the entire purpose of Gendry so I dont wanna believe it lol. What do yall think? Who is Azor Ahai? What will happen to Gendry in S8?",5,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

This was Taken Straight from 'A Game of Thrones WIKI"", however I've seen it other places. This is long but bare with me.... Maybe if you all think about it and we can try and piece together a reason for this to work then maybe we have something valuable here. Maybe you all can even go off of what I said and come up with new Theories about it and new clues. Sometimes I'm not good a expressing what I'm trying to say.


(In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Night's King fell in love with a woman ""with skin as white as the moon and eyes like blue stars""; he loved her though ""her skin was cold as ice"", and when he gave his seed to her he gave her his soul as well. He brought her to the Nightfort and bound the brothers of the Night's Watch to his will through sorcery. He declared himself ""Night's King"" and ruled over the Wall and The Gift as his own. The King in the North Brandon the Breaker and Joramun, the King-Beyond-the-Wall, joined forces to defeat him and his queen. After their deaths, it was discovered that they had been making human sacrifices to the Others - the White Walkers. After their defeat, the rule was enforced that the castles of the Night's Watch along the Wall should never be fortified against approach from the south, so that they cannot oppose the lands south of the Wall which they are meant to defend. The downfall of the Night's King and Queen also resulted in the strict enforcement of the rule that the Night's Watch is meant to be politically neutral, as guardians who do not ""rule"" the Wall but who serve the realms of men.)


Now reading this I started thinking. It says he ""gave her his seed."" and it wasn't discovered that they were making human sacrifices until after they were killed. What if she had a baby by him and it was sacrificed to the walkers and that baby ended up being the Night King because it would be 2 of different kinds of people. One from beyond the wall and behind the wall creating an ultimate force, thus being able to potentially be a warg because he can see the future like Bran. It's also why the Night king can raise up babies into White walkers. 

That seems bizzare but looking into it further I thought of this. The red woman is the most mysterious woman in the story. Why is she there and what does she really want. 


-The woman the Nights King fell in love with has blue eyes and white skin like The Red Woman. 


-Melisandre seems to be seducing everyone she thinks is a king for some reason, maybe for their seed just like this woman wanted. 

-She is making human sacrifices with stanis who she thinks is a king, just like that woman was. 


-Shes hundreds maybe even thousands of years old, putting her around the same age as the other woman. 


Maybe she is the same woman, and if so maybe the Night king now is the same man. They didn't exactly die, or maybe she didn't or was resurrected by the lord of light. Maybe she has been waiting for years for the dragons to finally come back so the Night King could use one the get himself beyond the wall. That's why their was a comet that everyone could see that signaled this. Or maybe she herself was the comet.



Maybe He is a Stark and her a Targaryan because of her ruby's, and skin and eye color. If the starks are somehow connected to the Night King then Maybe the Targaryan's are connected to the white walkers. If this is true, then furthermore maybe They need Jon (A Stark and Targaryan) and Danny (A Targaryan) To warg into taking their place on the Iron Throne. ""I've been ready to die for a long time"" and ""I must die in this strange city"" -Melisandre

During Dany's visions, she encounters the throne room in the Red Keep in a state of ruin. While we could speculate endlessly on that aspect of her visions, it's what immediately follows that piqued my curiosity. Upon leaving the throne room, she exits and finds herself north of the wall. There, she makes her way to a tent where she is re-united with Khal Drogo and her stillborn son, Rhaego.

If these visions foretell of a future to come, then it would seem clear that Dany's end lies north of the wall, to join Drogo and Rhaego in the land of the dead, the Night Lands. Of course, this is hypothetical but it's something I keep coming back to when I think about how this whole thing will conclude.

But fan perspective need not be the same as that of Westerosi Nobility. So here, let's consider the question of who they would choose as their king/queen.


Let's say that the War for Dawn is over and all the major characters survive and play some part in human victory. Then, instead of restarting the war, they decide to call a Great Council to peacefully figure out who should sit on the throne. And in interests of fairness, everyone with an ambition towards ruling is allowed to throw their hat in the ring. So the candidates to choose from are - **Jon, Dany, Cersei, Tyrion, Jaime, Sansa, Varys, Euron and Yara**. And all lords, big and small, get a vote here. 


Now, there maybe some misconceptions about the Great Council. It is NOT the Kingsmoot where the lords choose the most popular candidate. Ideally, it is meant to resolve the legal issues regarding succession and figure out who, in the eyes of the lords of Westeros, happens to have the most legitimate claim to the throne. And its not necessarily limited to succession either. **Any other major issues - such as independence of the North or of the Iron Islands can be tabled here as well.** Most importantly, decisions of a Great Council would create a legally binding precedent that could be used to prevent or cause future wars. 


That is not to say, however, that the lords of Westeros could be swayed from the strict legal perspective. If the argument is strong enough, you can expect them to ignore all consideration of the law and make a judgment call. But let's not forget, all prejudices and preconceptions prevalent in the land would be applicable here. 


**Now you are an agent of the candidate (or cause) of your choosing.** You get to personally interact with the Lords 1-on-1. Your goal here is to come up with a strategy to ensure your candidate's (or cause's) victory through a majority vote. You'd need to convince as many people as possible. And since it'd be easy to convince - say, a Westerlands House that a Lannister should sit on the the throne - imagine that you are trying to convince a more recalcitrant lord - like someone from Stormlands. 


So what would your strategy be here? How would you convince the lords that your candidate should sit on the Iron Throne? And how would you convince them that any other cause you support would be the best course of action?",11,8,False,spoiler,,,,,

But the loan isn't to Cersei personally or to the Lannister family - its to the Iron Throne. So if Dany (or Jon, for that matter) wins and ends up on the Iron Throne, would she be expected to foot the bill?


Seems a little unfair, doesn't it? Having to pay the financiers of your enemy for funding a war against you? Do you think Dany would actually pay or would she tell them ""you gambled and you lost""? What course of action would Tyrion advice?


Also, would it actually be in the Bank's best interest to demand repayment or would they be better off absorbing the loss as a bad investment? We know that they have a habit of propping up rebellious princes and/or hiring the Faceless Men for issues like this - but if the dragons are back in play, would it be worth the risk?

When he was looking at Dany's cabin with Jon in it. I always thought, that in that moment Tyrion didn't like them being together, because he wanted to break the wheel and a royal heir would torpedo that. And only as another, unlikely option, that he might be a bit jealous, because he had feelings for Dany himself.

Recently i rewatched the finale of season 6 (because it's the best hour of tv ever produced, duh :D). And there is a scene, after Dany told Daario, that he has to stay. The scene where Tyrion says to her, that Daario wasn't the first to love her, and he won't be the last. And there is this longing look on Tyrions face.

So, he might very well be in love with Dany. At least, i'm now leaning to that option of interpretation of his season 7 look. Either way, this could very well be reason enough for him, to betray Dany. I just can't wait for season 8..",22,12,False,spoiler,,,,,

637,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-3-10,2018,3,10,11,83cfal,self.gameofthrones,[spoilers] Theory regarding the Winterfell crypt and Bran.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/83cfal/spoilers_theory_regarding_the_winterfell_crypt/,Kup123,1520650276,"So this is working off of a few popular unconfirmed theories, that Bran due to time traveling shenanigans is the Night King, and has caused a lot of major story elements to take place. So to start i want you to think about a few things we know about Winterfell, one ""a Stark must always be in Winterfell"", and two that there is a crypt full of Stark lords and kings of the north equipped with swords. 

Why must there always be a stark in Winterfell? Whats special about the Starks, they have warg blood thanks to Bael the Bard bringing it over the wall. Assuming every thing is a result of Bran's time travel fuckery, we can surmise that Bran caused the infusion of wildling blood in to the Stark bloodline, because the greenseer must be a warg. The line there always has to be a Stark in Winterfell, may have been started by Bran to assure that he was there when needed, basically a hey it sucks here due to the weather, but Starks have to stay put due to future problems. 

Why does the crypt matter? We have already seen that the Night King and Bran are connected some how, whether it be the Night King marking him while projecting, or shutting down his warging in to a crow with a look, some how their powers are connected. Now while they both may be tapping in to the same power, a life and death yin yang type system, I think it's more likely they are one in the same. Ether way I think Bran might be able to raise the dead, again we have to assume Bran has seen every thing happen, but due to time travel he can shape events in a way to assure victory. They are arming there dead, ether the Night King is going to bring them back or Bran will, why else would GRM put in the lore that they have swords. Why is a blood line that has fought the Night King, not burning their dead instead of entombing, and arming them? 

I think Winterfell is going to need reinforcements and Bran will find them underground. GRM doesn't add any detail with out reason, there is always a call back or justification, but its rarely a cliche. In any other fantasy setting necromancy would always be bad, but in GOT Bran doing his thing to assure he would have well built armed corpses, to defend his and their home would seem right proper. What do you think?",13,12,False,spoiler,,,,,

Well, it is easily explained by the fact that it would also include the plot of season 8. But let's not forget that Martin planned to end his series with the book called A Dream of Spring.

This is another show-focused analysis but I think it pertains to the overall projection of Dany standing more as one half of an existential crisis facing characters in the middle like Jon Snow and Jaime Lannister.  

I'm ready to expand on both of those theories.  

Season 7 provided us maybe the most pronounced parallels between these 4 characters that further cement my belief that Jon and Dany are destined to be foils while, interestingly, Jon and Jaime are meant to be paralleled with each other as ""knights"" on opposite trajectories just as the NK and Dany are meant to be paralleled as each pole of an elemental, existential threat.  

The Loot Train Battle (7x04) (from here known as ""Field of Fire 2.0"" [Fof2.0]) was probably the most visually impressive battle we've ever seen from a television show. There were harrowing moments. We feared what might happen to a bunch of characters we care about. It was just overall a very compelling scene...but I think lost in a lot of the excitement is a very very interesting connection to the battle of Hardhome in 5x08.  

The settings were different (like Ice and Fire different), there was no overlap of the characters from either battle, and one was a clear protagonist in Jon defending against a clear antagonist in the NK while the other was a bad guy in Jaime defending against a hero in Daenerys.......or was it?  

I found these battles were shot almost EXACTLY the same with almost the EXACT narrative overlap which casts Dany in a completely different light than one half of a heroic duo. Analyzing these battles really did shock me. Even down to the timelines of the respective battles. They are both startlingly similar chronologically as well as narratively confirming the visual similarities.  

1) The setups  
(https://i.imgur.com/XUzNyFz.gif)  
We get some light-hearted moments (""I'm not good at counting"" / Dickon name jokes) which are broken by a realization of impending crisis.  

2) THE APPROACHING STORM  
(https://i.imgur.com/9o6zWiz.gif)  
This hardly even needs explaining but...Daenerys Stormborn and the Night King as the foe that doesn't wait out the storm, he brings the storm.  

3) Supporting Characters Receiving Character Expo Only to Die  
(https://i.imgur.com/1txMW80.gif)  
Karsi was introduced and killed in the same episode. Dickon was given a lot of exposition so that we liked him at the moment Dany chose to execute him along with his father.  

4) ""Heroes"" Need to Get Their Secret Weapon  
(https://i.imgur.com/kZe2p2M.gif)  
Both situations with Jaime/Bronn needing to dash for the Scorpion and Jon/Tormund/Loboda needing to dash for the Dragonglass.  

5) Visually Similar Images of the Veritable ""Dam Breaking""  
(https://i.imgur.com/JiT9MIp.gif)  
Viewers (and the ""heroes"") both realize the overwhelming force they face. The Dothraki are far too powerful and numerous for the Lannisters to defeat and the wights are so many in number that they can break down the gates.  
No amount of bravery can save either.  

6) Tracking Shots of Bronn and Jon  
(https://i.imgur.com/kNbxLrv.gif)  
I think one of the reasons the parallels can be easily missed is that 7x04 plays fast and loose with who exactly stands for which character. In this moment...Jon and Bronn are now the parallels. Given crazy similar moments while trying to make it to the secret weapon that I outlined above.  

7) Tracking Shots II  
(https://i.imgur.com/5AhsSnc.gif)  
Geez...  

8) Tracking Shots III  
(https://i.imgur.com/jMJNwPm.gif)  
Like seriously, this isn't accidental.  

9) Supporting Characters Watching Their People Slaughtered  
(https://i.imgur.com/XZw1txA.gif)  
Tyrion and Tormund watching their people being killed pretty mercilessly with almost identical looks of anguish. The interesting part is Tyrion is watching the army he should be rooting for as victors. But at what cost?  

10) Like, Even the Viciousness is Similar  
(https://i.imgur.com/NrqDBJ3.gif)  
The Dothraki and Army of the Dead shown with....an unsettling amount of similarity in their methods and killing efficiencies.  

11) Our Hero POV Characters Looking on With Helplessness  
(https://i.imgur.com/jGTzJR9.gif)  
Jon and Jaime looking on almost identically...right before Jaime's suicide ride for Drogon.  

So we have two battles. Two heroes. And two villains. At least how it's presented visually and contextually. If you ONLY saw these two episodes there would be no debating that the NK and Dany were the big villains while Jon and Jaime are the big heroes.  

The great part of GoT/ASOIAF is we have layers and layers of complication that cause us to see these as three-dimensional people and a good bit of gray in their characters. So maybe Jaime, the former villain, is still the bad guy here, just with camera tricks. Maybe Dany, while looking overwhelming, is just doling out justice for a family we've grown to hate.  

BUT..the one that really messes up that analysis is the Night King. There might be a backstory. There might not be. But we KNOW he must be defeated. And his story is the one most closely and intentionally paralleled with Dany's. That - and the humanizing of the Lannister forces in the build up to Fof2.0 - is one of the main reasons why I think this was done to both simultaneously confuse AND provide clarity to our perception of ""good"" and ""bad"" as the series comes to a close.

By Wight Hunt I mean when Jon and his companions go beyond the wall to capture a wight and prove its' existence to Cersei.

Smart plan. If Cersei learns it then all of Westeros learns it and all of Westeros needs to accept the existence of the real enemy if they are going to survive it.

But why not just capture a criminal instead and punish him in the wall by hanging, wait for him to turn, package him up and take him to King's Landing?

If we are to assume that Jon is honorable and all that cool shit, so he would never kill someone criminal or no just to make a point, then they could just take the first wildling that fell to the dead bear and take him back. Instead of, you know, marching straight into White Walkers.

I think it's the worst season they've ever done, now that isn't to say it's bad, it's quite good, and I'm not someone who necessarily thinks they've been getting worse for years (season 6 is my favorite). But I think there are a number of major issues that just push this season down to the bottom of my ranking.

1. Time restraints, I'll be the first one to admit that I fucking hate them decreasing the amount of episodes we're getting, I think it's nothing but detrimental. Seven episodes didn't help the pace, it didn't push the storyline in a better manner, it spread it thin. Characters fast traveling around usually isn't the type of thing to bother me, but here it absolutely does. This best comparison that can be made in my mind is that time restraints have turned Game of Thrones from a character driven show to a plot driven show. Character development feels like a side dish rather than the main course, wheres I felt beforehand the two were in perfect balance.

2. Stupid Shit. Like season 7 or not I think we can all admit there's a lot of stupid shit in this season, not just standard ""That doesn't quite add up"" stupid shit but next level ""How dumb do they think we are"" stupid shit. There are two particularly big offenders. The first being Jamie in the water. I don't care how many excuses anyone makes, that's just dumb. You're telling me that Jamie Lannister, wearing full plate armor and a heavy golden hand can not only be rescued from sinking into that lake. But Bronn can proceed to get his armor off and get him safety to shore that looks like is miles away. No. That's not just lazy writing that's just offensive to the viewer. Next level dumbfuckery that doesn't belong in Game of Thrones. The second offender is the entire episode Beyond the Wall. Now I like the idea of this episode a lot, and I was really hyped for it going into the episode and enjoyed watching it. It's entertaining, but it's pretty dumb. For one, there's no goddamn way they would send Jon Snow, the King of the North, maybe the most important player in this game on a suicide mission like this. Now it'd be like Jon to risk himself and try and go, but it'd also be like him to listen to reason and stay back. The very fact that Jon Snow went Beyond the Wall for this is tomfoolery. For Two, and this is a complaint that involves other episodes, it Gendry. Now I know I'm in the minority here, but I don't see any reason other than fan service for Gendry to have returned to the series. I'll admit, there's cool stuff they could do with his character, but it looks like instead of that they decided to put him in the heat of a season already pressed for time to swing his hammer a couple times. He serves no purpose to this episode or the plot at all and if they wanted to bring him back so badly they should have done it back in season 5 or 6 when they had the time to do it. Finally I want to talk about Benjen Stark, minor character, has hardly ever had any screen time, but I really like him. He's the last remnant of that generation of Starks, and he a father figure to Jon. So I think you can see why I'm upset that when he and Jon finally reunite it's for five seconds then Benjen rides to his death. Again, just dumb, lazy writing. What they should have done (and this is not my idea originally) was instead of that stupid undead polar bear fight scene that like the rest of Beyond the Wall, protected our characters with the plot armor impenetrable by Valerian steel. They should have came across Benjen riding Beyond the Wall, had a reunion, and had him join their company, even if he still died that episode that would have been so much more worthy of his character than what we got. 

Okay, I guess that wraps my two largest grips with season 7 up, again don't get me wrong I still love the show and season 7 has some amazing things. But overall I think the negatives really weight the season down. But this is a discussion so let's see what you have to say. What are your thoughts on season 7?",55,13,False,spoiler,,,,,

Seems like he loved his brother, loved his sister (a little too much), and resented his father. 

When it came to outside of family relations and well-being of anyone not within his own close knit relationships, you were expendable. 

Case in point him killing his own Lannister cousin in the cage. 

He then becomes the opposite through all of the events, leading to, for example not wanting Olenna Tyrell to suffer pain and offering her a painless way out, which he had to advocate to Cersei.

I think Jaime handled the siege very well overall. He managed to take the castle without losing a single man and only the Blackfish lost his life on the Tully side. Sure, he threatens to kill Edmure's child, but I really think he was bluffing on that point. Trying to use his bad reputation to his advantage. When Brienne asks if Jaime would allow the Blackfish and his forces to meet up North with Sansa, Jaime agrees. When Edmure returns to Riverrun, the Blackfish is furious and foolishly refuses to go with Brienne and essentially commits suicide by attacking the first group of Lannister soldiers he sees. Jaime seems to hope he can still take the Blackfish alive and seems somewhat disappointed when he learns of his death. But what do you think he would've done had he captured Brynden?

Given that he's a high ranking ally of the Stark rebellion, he should probably be executed for rebelling against the King but we've seen Jaime show mercy in a similar situation when he allowed Olenna to die painlessly. There's no way the Blackfish would've tried to work with Jaime and would probably try and goad him into killing him. Do you think Jaime would've executed the Blackfish, sent him to join the Night's Watch, given him a horse and told him to ride for Sansa? Jaime seems to have a certain respect for him so I wonder how he might've handled that.

- First I think we will see something similar to battle of the bastards but 1. Umbers will be on the Pro-Stark side along with the Manderly's (Basically Manderly's will be in the battle taking house Maizons spot in the show) and 2. I think Stannis will be somehow involved in the battle along side Jon and maybe Mance Ryder (if he is not died by this point or the book version of the burning flayed man which I personally think if there is a flaming flayed man in the battle field it will be Mance Ryder but instead of Mel burning him it's Roose and/or Ramsey, how he gets captured by the Boltons....I have no idea) and finally 3. Roose may be in the battle and fighting along side Ramsey if he is not died by this point, I also think the order of the allies will be different House Karstark maybe but instead of House Umber it is.....Well I don't want to say who I think it would be sense I don't want to piss any book fans off but I will get to my next point.

- I think Rickon and Shaggydog will die because Shaggydog means a Shaggydog story, But it will be different and since Rickon is on an island of Cannibals.....I think I have an idea of what his book death will be like, Basically I think he will be killed and possibly eaten by Cannibals (or maybe the Cannibals will take the Umber's show spot by sending him and Osha to the Boltons but I doubt that would happen...like at all).

- Arya's story in Braavos will end much MUCH sooner then how it dragged on in the show, and I think it WILL make more sense. I also believe we will see her reunite with Gendry and maybe when she could returns to Westeros she could have a run in with a certain Mummer's Dragon (Cough Young Girff Cough), also it be cool if she came in with Nymeria and her wolfpack to save Jon in the Botb but I don't if that would work timeline wise so probably not.

- Euron I think will be the one to bring down Eastwatch (or the entire wall) with a mind controlled Viserion or Rhaegal instead of the NK and undead Viserion.

- The whole Letter from LF think from the show in S6 will instead be Jon who I think could learn that Sansa is alive and ride to the Vale where I think they could have a reunion similar to the show, and plead to Sansa to bring the Knight's of the Vale to help and then right before it looks like Jon and Stannis will lose the fight Sansa (hopefully without LF) will come in with the Knight's of the Vale (or maybe Jon if he is not at the battle will come in with them).

That's not everything but that is what I think could happen, Or maybe not since the show has deviated from the books this post could just prove to be pointless. ",8,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

It went.....ok.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/83uxne/spoilers_update_we_finally_watched_the_red/,primus76,1520861223,"[I'm that guy from the other post about finally sitting down to watch GoT with my wife.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/7sn54l/tv_my_wife_just_started_watching_got_this_will_be/)  I wanted to provide an update.  No, I did not record her reaction.

So we finally hit S3E9 last night.  My anticipation grew exponentially increasing since mid last week as we had watched s3e8 and then it was put on a quick hiatus to watch the Jumaji movie and catch up on other shows. 

At the end of episode 8 my wife said that she really likes Robb and Talisa and was excited about the baby.  This made me (evil) giddy.

As we were getting closer to the moment, I'm thinking this is going to be great.  However, I think she caught on to GRRM and his style.  As soon as the bedding ceremony gang left and the doors close, it focused on Catelyn and the worried look she had when they shut the door.  That was enough for my wife to look at me and say ""I have a very bad feeling about this.""

Sadly, I think I had more of a reaction to it even after the second time than she did.  There is a possibility of her having found a spoiler about it but she is very, very bad at hiding spoilers.  She can never contain the fact that she knows something that I don't.  A friend had told her about the dragons hatching and she kept pointing out ""Wait until you see what happens to those eggs.""  

The only verbal noises she made was when they went to kill Grey Wind and was visibly saddened by it.  For the rest she sat in silence.  As soon as Catelyn's throat was cut she just barely said ""Holy shit that was brutal, they're all dead.""

I have to say, it has been great watching this through again.  I'm paying a lot more attention to it as it isn't just running in the background while I'm multitasking so I am getting a lot of stuff I had missed the first time around.  She's loving it and pushing us through episode after episode, coming up with her own theories, and starting to get more and more attached to characters as they grow and change.  

Every time an animal dies she does keep saying ""I don't know if I can keep watching this..."" and she is madly in love with the dragons.  I guess the next major milestones will be to see how she reacts to Oberyn vs the Mountain, the burning of Shireen and the killing of Viserion.",34,61,False,spoiler,,,,,

Hello /r/gameofthrones!

I am currently working on a GoT/ASOIAF quiz for a con in Israel called Olamot. It's not your standard ""here's a question, give me the answer"" quiz, so if anyone knows their GoT/ASOIAF and wants to help, please PM me.

When they go beyond the wall to catch a wight, they go on foot. The nights watch always used horses for ranging. Why would they go on foot now rather then use horses?  If the people with the most experience beyond the wall use horses, shoulnd't they too?

Secondly, if everyone who dies beyond the wall turns into a wight, couldn't they have brought a prisoner 10 feet outside the gate, executed him, and then brought him back after he turns? 

It seems like they could have made their own wight in a single night in relative safety near the wall rather than trekking all the way to find an entire army of wights. ",27,16,False,spoiler,,,,,

The scene when Howland kills Arthur Dayne in a Bran flashback taking some of the sheen off Eddard Starks heroic legacy

The scene when Meera rescues Bran while Hodor holds the door - GOT descends into a full blown zombie movie - absolutely superb - Meera of course shouts  Hold the Door setting up one of the legendary character arcs of GOT - even watching that scene again today its unsettling

Again GOT draws from real history in its use of the term Crannog which was an Scottish/Irish dwelling (dating potentially as far back as 3000 BC in Scotland but more popular in Ireland) with House Reed the head of the Crannogmen and their HQ being Greywater Watch 

I love that that Greywater Watch is essentially a crannog castle that moves around in the swamp - I would love to get a glimpse of it in Season 8

I know its been mentioned its not likely - has it been officially ruled out ?

Can anyone explain what we know so far about the Night King? To me, it seems like 

 Humans fought the children of the Forest

 The children captured and stabbed a human with an icicle, expecting him to all of a sudden be a weapon for them against his old kind. 

 Night King now kills everyone and can raise them from the dead and have all these ice powers. 

 Night King has intelligence, proven by creating plans and giving (telepathic?) orders, which hes used to gain numbers in troops and dragons.

1. Why did the CotF give this dude massive powers, and expect him to suddenly be on their side?

2. How does his magic surpass anything his creators can do, and allows him to create an army only limited by the population of his landmass? 

3. How were the other White Walkers created? He was stabbed by ice, but the others apparently are just touched, going by Crasters son. Does the ice baby grow up? Do Walkers then age? Theyre so much better than wights, why doesnt the NK try and create as many as possible so they can be foot soldiers instead of generals/elites?",10,12,False,spoiler,,,,,

888,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-3-14,2018,3,14,17,84bwk8,self.gameofthrones,[Spoilers] Robb's Karstark Decision: Another Perspective,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/84bwk8/spoilers_robbs_karstark_decision_another/,genkaus,1521017450,"Robb Stark's decision to execute Ricard Karstark for the murder of 2 Lannister prisoners is commonly held up as one of his 3 great political blunders (the other 2 being breaking the marriage pact and sending Theon to Pyke). Its commonly accepted in the fandom that he should've chosen political expediency over his idea of honor and justice. However, I'd like to argue here that because of how Karstark acted, Robb never had any other option. Rickard Karstark's state of mind and his actions are something the fandom usually glosses over as actions of a grief-mad father. But without taking those into account, any judgment about the politically expedient option would be incomplete. 


Now, the first thing to know about Rickard is that *any* peace with the Lannisters was unacceptable to him. In the books, this is made clear when Robb is announcing his peace terms to be sent to KL - terms that heavily favor the North and that everyone knows the Lannisters would never accept - and Karstark walks out in anger. A war of vengeance is an empty and futile endeavor that would only spread misery - and this is something Robb is smart enough to understand. Which is why he sets up reasonable strategic objectives that his bannermen can accept. For Robb, war had always been a means to an end with the end being a return to some sort of peaceful co-existence with the Lannisters with his family safe and his kingdom secure. But because of the death of his sons, Karstark no longer saw any value in peace anymore - he wanted more bloodshed, he wanted as many Lannisters dead as possible to satisfy his own thirst for vengeance and he didn't care how many of his countrymen had to die to make that happen. 


Karstark was in a nihilistic suicide spiral since the beginning. Ofcourse, initially, his loyalty was strong enough to stop him from doing anything drastic, but come season/book 3, peace between North and the Iron Throne was starting to look like a real possibility. At that point, Robb was vastly outnumbered and it didn't look like he'd win or get justice for Ned. Which means, since he is a good king, he might choose not to keep sacrificing his men and try negotiating instead. And since Robb had proven himself quite formidable in the battlefield, the Lannisters might consider negotiating to be a cheaper way out. Especially if Jaime is returned and they don't lose any face by doing so. This was unacceptable to Karstark and he was determined to make it as hard as possible - if not impossible. He wanted to make sure that they'd fight to the bitter end. 


Which is why his actions were carefully planned. Once again, the books made it clear here that the Karstark had started their desertion *before* Rickard murdered those boys. Before Robb passed his judgment. And Karstark gave them a strong motivation not to come back - he announced that he'd marry his daughter to any man who brings him Jaime's head. 


Consider the implications of this: Jaime is a valuable hostage and would necessarily be a part of any final peace deal. By commanding his men to kill him on sight (as opposed to recapture), he is not only making sure that Catelyn's plan fails, but also that there is no final peace deal between Robb and Tywin. And since his men have deserted with dreams of marrying a highborn lady filling their minds, holding Karstark hostage isn't going to bring them back. 


Karstark made sure that any politically expedient option wouldn't work out. His men are not going to come back just because he is held hostage. If they kill Jaime and if the Lannisters kill the Stark girls, it scotches any possibility of peace. And since his men knew what he was planning, Robb couldn't cover up the death of the squires either. 


Even beyond that, he wanted to do as much spiteful damage as possible on his way out. That's shown by his half-hearted defense of his actions - ""it was vengeance"" (wrong targets), ""your mother is a traitor too"" (doesn't justify your treason), ""they were our enemies"" (you need to obey the king to call his enemies your own), ""you'll be a kinslayer"" (kinslaying doesn't apply to distant relations), ""the king means to scold me"" (if you want mercy, try not to insult the guy you want it from). He didn't care about defending himself because he didn't care about living. It was one elaborate suicide-by-Robb. 


At this point, Robb had no other option other than executing him. Holding him hostage wouldn't have brought his men back and even if Robb had sent him to the Wall, he'd have continued inciting his men. A cover-up was not an option. And if Robb had any hope of protecting Sansa from retaliation, he had to send a clear message to the Lannisters that this act was unsactioned and the perpetrator has been appropriately punished. And since Karstark remained defiant without an ounce of contrition, Robb had to send the message to his other bannermen as well that disobedience will not be tolerated. Any leniency here would show Robb to be weak and then he wouldn't be a king anymore. 



Make no mistake - ultimately, Robb made this choice because of his concept of honor and justice. That is what convinced him that this was right and necessary. But its also true that he never had another choice. Atleast, none that would've made any difference for the better. ",84,159,False,spoiler,,,,,

However, I still hold to the belief that no redemption arc can be complete without the character expressing genuine remorse for his actions. 


Its well and good for Jaime to decide that he'd do better and act more honorably in the future - but that resolution rings hollow if he fails to understand exactly why he fell short the first time around. Its not about looking for explanations or excuses for his actions, its about accepting the moral responsibility for them. Its about having a ""What have I done?"" moment where you realize that this choice you made was fundamentally wrong. 


Right now, I've been re-reading some of Jaime's chapters and they seem rather scant on remorse. I definitely saw remorse for his failure to protect Rhaegar's children - how he seemed haunted by Rhaegar's ghost. And there was remorse about letting the Kingsguard fall so low. But not for much else. 


With regards to his relationship with Cersei, he seems more focused on her betrayal and what she has become instead of his own culpability in it. There is more a sense of ""How could I have ever loved this woman?"" or ""How could I not see what she was?"" - but Jaime needs to acknowledge that even if Cersei had been a pillar of fidelity (to him), sleeping with the Queen and fathering bastards was still very, very wrong, because it put the entire realm at risk. Similarly, his regrets about pushing Bran from the window seem to be more about how it messed things up and how Cersei was unhappy with him for it - but no regrets about crippling a 7 year old. 



Are there any parts that I'm missing? Parts where Jaime reflects on his action with remorse? Parts like him watching the devastation of Riverlands and thinking ""I did this. Its all my fault""? ",41,14,False,spoiler,,,,,

Tyrion didn't think to invite all the Lords of Westeros to the Dragonpit meeting. 

The great Lords would witness Daenerys Targaryen calling for a truce to deal with the real threat to the people. Great PR for team Targaryen plus it makes it harder for Cersei to say no or say yes then betray them. Either way the Lords would rather fight for a Queen who fights for them. 

This little addition would also make Tyrion's grab a Wight plan more believable as the stakes would be even higher - if the plan works they can get the whole country behind them.

So what if.... In order to make a WW, there has to be human sacrifice.


With a whole show based around sacrifices this makes so much sense that a WW can only be made this way. To go even further I believe that not only does it have to be from sacrifice but possibly only be though incest. Hear me out here guys....




-Craster's sons are from incest.



-Cersies baby will be from incest.



-Jon and Danny (if they have one) 
will be from incest. 




Maybe incest is key somehow and that's what the Knight King is after. Other than the historical aspects there has to be some deeper meaning behind all of the incest between important characters. There has to be some meaning behind Cercies pregnancy. 





Maybe if this is true of the Night King and Crasters sacrifices, Cersie could potentially sacrifice her unborn child to him in exchange for her life and somehow that's how she becomes the Night Queen. Even if not the Night Queen, since she made the sacrifice he cant kill her so she will have the biggest alliance of all. If not the story line with Cersie maybe Jon has to make the decision to sacrifice his baby in order to save everyone.


 


Cersies love for her children has been driven into us since day one for a purpose. This could be the final act to show she has truly lost it. It was also driven into us how Jon was so torn by the fact Craster was sacrificing his baby boys. It would be quite the Irony if Jon was faced with the same decisions. Either way I think we can all agree All of these babies, incest, and human sacrifice will play a huge role in the end game.

From what I have read, it seems like most fans seem disappointed with Jon's characterization and see him as pretty stupid and not really a leader or hero.  However, I would love to get it compiled into one place. 

I am totally on record at thinking Jon is an incompetent servant.

Edit: I didn't know that pointing out suggesting that a hero should be competent was such a controversial thing.  It seems like there is at least a portion of the fanbase who thinks Jon is ""dumb"" but would be satisfied with him winning because the good guy should win.  Don't you want a story where the good guy outsmarts the bad guy?  Isn't that what makes a heroic arc and a hero's journey satisfying?

We have already learnt the first two, the first one was Shireen being executed and the second one was Hodor being hold the door.

I have a theory which has been conjured up in discussion with my colleague at work, in which we believe we know the third and final big reveal.

To set the scene, it involves Sam and Gilly, who we sometimes wonder what their significance to the whole storey is. So, let me add some key story lines to Sam and Gilly (particularly Sam).

Sam is an outcast, sent to the wall by his Father because he lacks the skills of a warrior and doesn't fit in with his Fathers expectations of a Son, he doesn't want him to hold his name or inherit his land and castle etc. This fits in with GRRM affection for cripples and bastards.

Sam has played a key role in the battle against the WW from the beginning, he found the stash of dragon glass on the fist of the first men, he killed the first WW with the dragon glass, he was also left alone/ignored/unnoticed by the WW (when he hid behind the rock). He discovered that Dragonstone had mines of dragon glass. This is all very important stuff, although it may not have been seen to be at the time.

Other noticeable things he has done, was to have John elected as the Lord Commander, free Gilly and baby Sam from Craster, also saving their lives on an occasion or two, assisting Bran reach beyond the wall etc. He also learnt from books how to cure greyscale and then cured Jorah, he discovered Johns parentage and then told Bran who went back and saw this.

So, you get the picture, Sam is of massive importance. Now, let's have a look how he could be involved the third and final big reveal.

We've seen Sam and Gilly read about the Azor Ahai prophecy, we know that Lightbringer is created by stabbing a sword through Nisa Nisa's heart. Our theory is that Sam, is in fact Azor Ahai, and Gilly is Nisa Nisa.

Sam will read about the steps to create lightbringer, he will tell Bran, who then tells him that he is Azor Ahai. He is then left with the task of creating lightbringer, which he must do by stabbing Gilly through the heart with his sword, none other than the one he stole from his father, ironically called heartsbane. If we think about the 'purest love' in Game of Thrones, it's hard to argue against Sam and Gilly's (John and Danny have only just met and could be described as more of a fling than love). If you take a moment to think about Sam having to kill Gilly, you can already get an idea of the emotion involved, which would be similar to Shireen and Hodor, it's also the least expected, which makes it even more plausible.

Also, what other significance does Gilly play? I would liken her character to that of Shireen and Hodor, we didn't realise what significance they played in the story until they died. I think this will be the case for Gilly as well, as right now, I see no other need for that Character.

Now that we imagine Sam has lightbringer, but he isn't a warrior, so, he simply hands lightbringer to the prince that was promised, most likely John Snow, but possibly Danny and any other possible candidates.

Sam as Azor Ahai is leading the rest into the battle against the WW and has been doing so from the beginning, he doesn't have to be the warrior we may have expected, he simply is the commander or general, directing the forces in order to defeat the WW. He is the creator of the weapon (lightbringer) that is needed in order to defeat the WW.


In my mind, it all makes sense. Let me know what you think.",33,79,False,spoiler,,,,,
965,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-3-15,2018,3,15,23,84n37q,self.gameofthrones,[Spoilers] The Right Meereenese Policy,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/84n37q/spoilers_the_right_meereenese_policy/,genkaus,1521125968,"&gt;*It ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things. Because the innovator has for enemies all those who have done well under the old conditions, and lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new. This coolness arises partly from fear of the opponents, who have the laws on their side, and partly from the incredulity of men, who do not readily believe in new things until they have had a long experience of them.*

- Niccolo Machiavelli. 


Dany's tenure as the Queen of Meereen is usually held up as an example of misrule and how good intentions don't necessarily lead to good results. The prevailing consensus seems to be that Dany was a little too harsh and hamfisted in her attempts to reform Meereen and if she'd only been more political, more patient and more conciliatory in her approach, she might've avoided the Harpy insurgency and managed to bring peace. 


My personal opinion is the opposite. I think that Dany did fail in her Meereen project, but she failed because she wasn't harsh enough. She failed because she listened to Barristan's advice that ""these were all her subjects now"" and Jorah's advice that ""people can change"" and Tyrion's advice that ""burning cities makes you just like your father"". As the quote above indicates, Dany was trying to introduce a new order of things and for it to have any chance of success, much harsher measures may have been required. 


Putting my personal view aside, here is the bottom line for Meereen - it was a city built on slavery. Its main export were slaves. The noble families with slaves held all the political power. The families with slaves held all the wealth and lands. The slaves built the entire infrastructure - they built the roads and the pyramids and they fought in the pits. The city's economy, infrastructure, political structure, wealth distribution - they were all determined and upheld by slavery. 


For anyone to remove slavery from this equation and expect everything else to hold up would be illogical. And Dany was trying to keep the rest of the system propped up. She may have freed the slaves, but the noble families still retained their wealth and political power. Ofcourse the system was going to try to self-correct and get things back to normal. Dany was the destabilizing effect on the system and the insurgency was the system's response in trying to get rid of her. No matter what conciliatory moves she made, the Sons of Harpy would've kept doing their thing. And even within the new parameters, slavery was trying to make a come-back. It simply had a different name, like ""life-long indentured servitude"". 


I think the only way to bring immediate peace to Meereen would've been to allow slavery to take hold once again. Failing that, I don't think any politician, no matter how talented, could've made it peaceful in a small timeframe. Those looking to change, would need to change the entire system - a complete, top-to-bottom, social, political and economic reform. They could either start by annihilating the old system completely and starting from the scratch. Or they could try and do it slowly - power through the insurgency and other civil unrest, keep fending off efforts to return the system to the old status quo and keep changing things little by little until they finally start seeing the fruits about a decade later. Whichever way they choose, they are going to cause a lot of bloodshed and they are going to end up with the moniker of a ""cruel, vicious tyrant"".


But you know what - if it ends with a society free from slavery, I think it'd be worth it?


But am I missing something here? Some brilliant third option that could bring peace immediately and without a return to slavery in any shape or form? People argue that Dany did wrong in Meereen, but what was the ""right"" answer?",9,7,False,spoiler,,,,,

When considering this question, I often think of the following moral dilemma and how the different leaders we've seen would act on it. 


Now the Wall has fallen and the AotD is slowly making its shambling way south. Meanwhile, Winterfell stands ready for battle with sufficient grain in store, dragonglass, valyrian steel, wildfire, scorpions and whatever else is needed. But before the eventual face-off, thousands of refugees from Karstark and Umber lands arrive at Winterfell, seeking refuge. So what does the leader at Winterfell do with all of them?


These thousands of refugees may not be of much use in the war, but you are going to need them to rebuild once the war is over. The survival of as many of them as possible is what you are fighting for. If you let them all in and Winterfell falls, then everybody dies. Not to mention, right now, these are useless mouths to feed. Its entirely possible that if you let them in, your grain stores would be emptied out and you'd all die of starvation before the Night King ever gets there. In that case, the war would be lost without a sword being raised. So the rational choice for the leader would seem to be to tell them to keep moving. Keep heading south - while the rest make a stand. 


But that idea may not go over so well with the refugees. They've just been through a grueling march - they are tired and hungry and desperate and they've already seen a whole lot of their own die in the march to Winterfell. They wouldn't believe that heading south would be their best chance for survival. A march through snow without food or fire? That sounds like certain death. So if they are going to die anyway, they might as well rest a little in the shadow of Winterfell. Maybe the Lord of Winterfell will take pity on them and let them in eventually. Maybe he'll remember his duty and extend them the guest right. Maybe he'll send out some food or firewood or figure out a better way to transport them south. Whatever their hopes are, they'd believe that staying nearby is their best chance at survival - and if they die, atleast they die rested. 


Well, the leader of Winterfell can't have this either. He can't literally hand over dead soldiers to the Night King. If these people won't go on their own, he has to force them to go. Which means taking some particularly cruel and vicious measures to make them believe that marching south gives them a better chance of survival. 


And his actions would have to be really cruel to get that message across. I'm talking about making a real example here - like burning a few alive or feeding some to dragons. And these people aren't enemy soldiers or defiant lords - these are innocent civilians asking for refuge, which the leader is duty-bound to provide. The rational course of action here is almost unimaginably cruel. 


So, among your favored leaders, who would have the stomach for such an action? And since we know that Tywin, Cersei or Roose would do it without blinking an eye, let's count them out. I'd prefer to consider leaders who actually care about their subjects and understand their duty to them. And if a particular leader does engage in something like this, how would it change your opinion of them?

Note: This isnt self-promotion. I created this for my own use and wanted to share it with more people. I even created a completely new youtube channel for this video.


We've all been there, trying to convince someone to start watching GoT. You know they'll love it, but they just won't give it a shot. And you just cant stop nagging because you crave their reactions and want to have someone new to discuss it with. Prejudice about fantasy scares some people off. Fantasy is an F-word in movies and TV, as Peter Jackson once said (paraphrasing of course). 


I've been searching the web for a really good GoT trailer, a trailer for all seasons, (it is one long story after all and the S1 trailers don't do the show any justice in my opinion) and there are none. Only ones that show major spoilers. So, I finally took matters into my own hands and created a trailer. 


I wanted a trailer that:

* Has no major spoilers. Meaning NO dragons!

* Teases the existence of White Walkers, but keeps them a mystery. 

* Gives some insight to the main characters, since the characters are the most important part of the whole story. 

* Focuses on featuring good dialogue rather than just fighting and battles. GoT is more about political intrigue than fighting. This kind of goes along with the previous point too. 


I know a lot of people(me included) who are not impressed merely by dragons, zombies and cool action. I wanted to show that GoT is so much more than that, that it is more like The Godfather set in medieval times(at least the first seasons) with amazingly developed characters and slight, but increasing, elements of fantasy. 


About spoilers: It was very hard to make a trailer for all 7 seasons without any spoilers at all. A lot of things can technically be spoilers. Like showing Cersei with short hair means that viewers know that shes not going to die for as long as she has long hair in the show, because they know that at some point shes going to have short hair. I decided to let things like that slide, because people who havent seen it will not remember every little detail from a trailer. 


Wow, this came out way too long, so here is the link to the video:
[LINK TO TRAILER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4J7Qqn_Owk)


What do you think? Would you show this to a friend in order to convince them? Does it show too much? Of course it is always best to go into a show with as little knowledge as possible, so this trailer is more of a last resort, when you really want someone to start watching but they keep resisting.


Tl;dr - I created a trailer for GoT(all seasons) so that I (and you) can use it to to persuade friends and family into watching the show.

I'm almost certain that Rhaegar knew of the coming of the White Walkers. I remember reading about a book the Valeryions had that foretold the doom of men would come from a land to the west (possible prophecy speaking to the coming Night King). Another interesting point is, during his youth, Rhaegar was a zealous reader and had no interest in becoming a warrior. That is until he read something that immensely motivated him to become a warrior. I think he read some ancient text full of prophecies, which also included the prophecy of the three headed dragon (prince that was promised). Which I think is the same as the ""Lord of Light's Azor Ahai"" prophecy. At first Rhaegar believed himself to be the ""Prince that was Promised"" (interesting that he was born of salt and flame (ref tragedy at summerhall)) however he and the story disprove that. He next believes his children with Elia are the ones the prophecy predicts, but they're dead and I forget what it was, but something convinced him that his current children were not the ones the prophecy spoke of. This one might be a stretch, but I think he stopped believeing it was possible fulfill the prophecy with children born from Elia. Something about Lyana (her wildness, her fire, beauty etc..) convinced Rhaegar she would birth the children that prophecy spoke of. Another interesting note, (cont. after warning)

*******(WARNING SPOILERS FOR THE BOOKS, DOES NOT TAKE PLACE IN THE TV SHOW)****

(cont) the following takes place in the house of the undying and I straight up copy pasted it. 

""The fifth room, finally, shows a man very much alike her brother Viserys, except that he is taller and has eyes of dark indigo rather than lilac. He is speaking to a woman who is nursing a newborn babe, telling her that the child's name should be Aegon and saying that ""What better name for a king?"". The woman asks him if he will make a song for the child, and he replies that he has a song and that ""He is the prince that was promised, and his is the song of ice and fire."". He appears to look at Dany then, as if seeing her, and then he adds that ""There must be one more,"" and ""The dragon has three heads."".

So clearly they're talking about Jon (Aegon) here... but wait... did Rhaegar and Lyana have time to share such a loving moment with their new son? Is this an actual historical event? Or just an illusion to drop hints for Dany? I think it's safe to say that Dany is definitely one of the three heads, also safe to say that Jon (Aegon) is also one. Who's the third? Lots of people think it's Tyrion (as the prophecy states that no specific gender and it doesn't necessarily have to be a Targaryen). I love Tyrion to bits, but I just dont see it. Another issue, is (MAJOR SPOILER ALERT) one of the dragons is dead/undead/destroying the wall, so how can there be a third rider? WELL GUESS WHAT MOTHERFUCKER?!?! Bran Stark baby! He can skinchange, so maybe he's able to take over the undead dragon? The three eyed raven did promise him he would fly again eh ;)

So to summarize, I think Raeghar knew of the White Walkers and the only way to stop them, shacked up with Lyana, knowing it would start a war, but did so for the greater good. The prince that was promised is actually three characters, most likely Dany, Jon and Bran. Obviously I don;t think I'm %100 and can't wait for points/counterpoints to be made. Sorry if I went overboard with the spoiler warnings (new to this sub) and if I made any other mistakes please just let me know. Also written on a phone during company hours so sorry for the lack of correct grammar and maybe even basic spelling lol!

Adding this in, just thought of Lyanna Stark's last words to Ned ""Promise Me!"". Apparently she was wrought with fear when Ned initially arrived, after the inaudible dialogue and Ned making whatever promise to his sister, the fear seemed to leave Lyanna. So whatever Ned promised to her gave her a sense of relief. I'm assuming the promise had something to do with Jon Snow's (Aegon) fate, the coming of the walkers and something that Ned needed to do to guarantee the safety of Jon/fate of Westeros. After Lyanna passed, Ned remained for a while, until Howland Reed came into the room and separated Ned from Lyanna. Ned claims he doesn't remember a thing during the period of time in between her passing and when Howland arrived. This promise must of been some super heavy shit and was quite the burden for Ned to carry. I recently re watched season 1 and noticed how old and tired Ned looks, he's 36 and he looks like he's in his 50's. Obviously war will do this to a man, especially long bloody ones. But still, I think the weight of the secret, one hes never shared with anyone, has something to do with that. That's kind of where I'm at with this train of thought, I'd love to get some feedback on this.

I found out about it first from this video: https://youtu.be/XdLletjWIew And this one here: https://youtu.be/b1gDr1NXjjU

Little tldr if you haven't heard about it, but I recommend watching the first video since I can only butcher it with my words.
The first video is very short (about 4 minutes). The main thing seems to be that littlefinger was talking to a girl in Winterfell that (supposedly) told him ""your time's up"". It goes on to say that the girl he was talking to must've been one of the faceless man and the person dying is not littlefinger but a faceless man wearing the face of him. They explain the ""possible"" link between littlefinger and the faceless man, how his face could've been used even tho he is alive and more.

I have a theory for why they did not do this.

It would make their decision to discuss a ceasefire with Cersei seem purely political and would make it look like they were only trying to get the backing of lords of Westeros. Tyrion knows that any hint of them making a move for political gain rather than purely trying to save the realm would anger Cersei and result in disaster for team Dany, whereas by doing what they did they at least have some chance of appealing to Cersei and Jaime and gaining their support, whatever little chance it may be.",12,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

Drogon is Lightbringer because Mirri Maaz Duur brought him to life in exchange for Khal Drogo's (as if he's Nissa Nissa). Also the prophecy says ""There will come a day after a long summer when the stars bleed andthe cold breath of darkness lies heavy on the world. In this dread hour a warrior shall draw from the fire a burning sword. And that sword shall beLightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes, and he who clasps it shall be Azor Ahai come again, and darkness shall flee before him."" Drogon hatched in the fire, and there is ample proof Daenerys is Azor Ahai come again, so it would make sense since Daenerys and Drogon are so close. And it is said Lightbringer radiates heat, remember Daenerys feeling Drogon's egg being warm?

And some of you might be thinking of Stannis pulling out the sword from the burning statues at the beach. But the prophecy says it is the prince that was promised who'll pull Lightbringer from the fire, and Stannis isn't   TPTWP. 

InA Storm of Swords, Maester Aemon asks Stannis to see the sword. Stannis cannot understand how a blind man can see his sword, but shows it to him. Sam describes the sword in details to Aemon: ""It glows as if it were on fire. There are no flames, but the steel is yellow and red and orange, all flashing and glimmering, like sunshine on water, but prettier. I wish you could see it, Maester"". If you rewatch the scene when Illyrio Mopatis gifts Daenerys the dragon eggs, you'd see Drogo's egg is red at the top, then orange, then a golden yellow, as if it were on fire. 

While they are walking away, Aemon seems to be deep in thought. He asks Sam whether he felt any heat from the sword. Sam admits he saw lights, but did not feel any heat. Aemon does not reveal the purpose of his question (perhaps it is ironic that a blind man noticed what others with eyesight did not).

InA Feast for Crows, Aemon reveals to Sam what he perceived: the sword is not the real Lightbringer, since the real Lightbringer is supposed to radiate heat, and Stannis is not Azor Ahai. He claims that Melisandre has misread the signs, andDaenerysis the one whom the prophecy is about.

We know that dragonfire is one of the few things that can kill ~~white walkers~~ wights, along with dragon glass and valyrian steel. Now that Viserion is a wight, is he susceptible to dragon fire?

Pyat traps Dany

Dialogue as follows

*They miss their mother. They want to be with you. Do you want to be with them? You will be. When your dragons were born our magic was born again. It is strongest in their presence, and they are strongest in yours. You will be with them through winter, summer and winter again. Just a thousand, thousand seasons you will be with them, and we will be with you until time comes to and end. Welcome home, Daenerys Stormborn.*

Its great to watch with the knowledge that Viserion destroyed The Wall - it almost gives Pyat more motive and indeed less nefarious motives than he might have previously had - although its more likely Pyat just wants to trap this source of magic for his own use

When I watched this scene for the first time Pyat came across as some sort of guardian - a bit like the Nights Watch but for magic - it all seemed a bit dramatic to trap her for all of time just to gain power in Qaarth or Essos

If I've done anything wrong, please feel free to correct me. I also did a quick search in this and /asoiaf and I haven't found this theory (although I am certain I'm not the first with this idea).

Theory: Jon Snow is going to kill the Night King, then become the Night King, leading the remnants of the army of the dead back into the lands of always winter after rebuilding the wall, remaining undead for thousands of years while the children's magic rots his mind and moral fiber.

Proof (I'm not looking up direct sources, feel free to correct me as appropriate. All things written should be considered paraphrasing instead of verbatim exact words/phrasing.)

The Children of the Forest created the White Walkers to end the war with the first men. The truce was called sometime after, with men not entering the forest, not cutting down weirwood trees, and converting to their religion. Some time after that (thousands of years apparently), the Night King was defeated by the men, the Children, and 'Azor Ahai', who in turn became the Night King. It has been reported that at least one (if not both) of these leaders of the undead are Starks.

Fast forward thousands of years into the current GoT timeline, and the White Walkers are on the move south again: Benjen Stark was killed, which is not atypical of rangers north of the wall -- ""A good ranger doesn't live to get old"" -- what is atypical and unique is that the Children of The Forest brought him back. Why did the Children bring Benjen Stark back, rangers die all the time. People die all the time. Yet the Children of The Forest randomly decided to stick a dragonglass shard through some random dead guy's chest? Yes, he's needed as a plot point to save both Bran and Jon, but GRRM is not some shallow author who puts things in his story only to serve one white knight purpose. There's a reason the Children brought a Stark back, and I believe it's because the Children were intending Benjen to take the Night King's place and lead them back north. This isn't going to happen because he sacrificed his existence to save Jon's life.

So I'm going to take a leap here and say that the Night King is a Stark, and killing him won't do any good in stopping the army -- if it did, this whole situation would have been settled thousands of years ago. He must be replaced and his humanity will slowly wither over the course of thousands of years. There are only two Starks left: Bran and Jon, and Bran's a cripple. He can't kill the Night King, in addition, becoming the Three Eyed Raven might have screwed everything up (MEERA: ""Bran?"" // THE THREE-EYED RAVEN: ""I'm not, really. Not anymore."").

I believe the Northern arc of the story will end when Jon Snow sacrifices his existence and becomes the Night King. I can't see any other way that the story would remain epic and meaningful. If anyone could become the Night's King, Jorah or Beric could take on the mantle, but it just wouldn't have the same 'bittersweet' tone.",10,6,False,spoiler,,,,,

I love Daenerys for the head strong women she is. She is definitely an amazing character to watch and Emilia plays her character so well. Fire can not burn and dragon and she managed to bring 3 into the world. 

But I cant help but get frustrated when she gets her and all of her followers into impossible situations. And the only way shes able to get out of them is by pure luck, everyone else saving her, or her dragons saving the day at last minute. And then she sits on whatever thrones shes at at the time and has that smug look on her face. It really just deteriorates the idea of this god-like character, shes always fuckin up.

Season 1- Despite EVERYONE TELLING HER NOT TO USE BLOOD MAGIC, she does it anyway and ends up getting Khal Drogo killed, and she got the Khalasar to leave. 

Season 2- After wallowing in the Red Waste for weeks, not able to keep her people alive, she gets LUCKY and finds Qarth, where she never would have even been admitted into if it werent for Xaro. 
The. she manages to get her fucking dragons taken because she left them alone in a tower without her there, the most valuable things in the world.

She then goes to the House of the Undying not knowing what the fuck was gonna happen. She could have just as easily gotten herself killed and then the dragons would have been lost forever.

Season 3- ill give her this one because I really enjoyed the way she handled getting the Unsullied and the Second Sons

Seasons 4,5,6(?) When she gets to Meereen, she just expected to break off their chains, crucify the masters and woooo shes queen of something without any repercussions. She then locks up her dragons (which she never even took out btw they broke out by themselves), loses Drogon and is lost again. 
When she re-opened the fighting pits and the Sons of the Harpy attacked there was literally nothing she could have done. She only lived because she flew away on Drogon and LEFT ALL OF HER PEOPLE TO DIE. Yeah Drogon kind of fucked shit up. ur she had to of known it wouldnt be enough.

She then gets taken by the Dothraki, and again had no hope of leaving until she found Dario Naharis and Jorah. Then, she only got the Khalasar because she killed them in a fire, walked out nakey  and everyone bowed to her. 

Like, at least Jon Snow knows how to wield a sword. He led the move at Hardhome and gets out of situations because he is smart and talented. (Minus when he got stabbed in the chest by his brothers)

Everyone whispers in her ear different ideas, different ways to deal with things. Sometimes she listens and sometimes she doesnt. And when she doesnt she doesnt change her mind until the last second. I dont really see her as the superhuman anymore cause when you put everything into perspective shes only where she is because of luck and everything else around her. Not her herself. I hate it because shes the Breaker of Chains, Mother of Dragons. I want to love her but i just cant. I left out so much too typing this now i can still think of ways shes fucked up situations for everyone. thoughts?

This has recently been confirmed by the cast and showrunners. I think that by near the end (last 2 or 3 episodes) nearly everyone except the very main characters like Jon, dany, Cersei, Jaime, Tyrion, and the stark children will have died. There will be some exceptions but they are not relevant to the overall ending except Sam and the Hound. Jons heritage is revealed to everyone and Jon declines the iron throne. Rhaegal will have been killed and resurrected. Daenerys will also have been revealed to be pregnant.

Anyway, my theory is that at this point the white walkers will have all but destroyed Westeros and the last remnants of the army will retreat to kings landing. There they will be met with the last of Cerseis army which they defeat.The hound will defeat the mountain and Euron will also be defeated. Jaime will speak with Cersei privately, pleading to join them one more time but she will refuse and tell him how it was a mistake to join the enemy, and blows up most of kings landing with the wildfire. This pushes Jaime over the edge and he strangles Cersei. 

Not long after, the white walkers arrive in kings landing and battle the survivors. The hound, Jaime,  and Arya are killed in the fighting. Arya actually dies in Jons arms and is one of the most tragic scenes of the series. Enraged, Jon personally battles the night king but is no match for him and is killed. Seeing the destruction the white walkers have caused, bran ignores his teachings and goes back in time to try to stop the night king from being created and instead becomes perpetually trapped within his mind, making the night king and bran together as one.

Daenerys tries to retaliate and flies in on drogon. Wight viserion is killed, but rhaegal and the night king kill drogon. Daenerys survives. Now completely outnumbered and hopeless, Tyrion makes them escape. Sansa, Tyrion, Sam, and Daenerys escape kings landing with the other survivors and flee to dragonstone, leaving Westeros to be conquered by the white walkers.

On dragonstone, Daenerys goes into labor prematurely and dies giving birth to her and Jons child. Tyrion and Sansa promise to lead the survivors, both southerners and northerners, to victory some day. Sam, having read through all the prophecies and stories, realizes that Daenerys was azor ahai and Jon was the prince that was promised and only together could they forge lightbringer, the sword in the darkness, who is in fact their son and will one day lead the world from the darkness and defeat the white walkers. The story ends with Sam agreeing to raise the child in hiding while documenting down the struggle of Westeros and calling it the song of ice and fire.

I believe that this ending is a possibility because the ending is supposedly going to be bittersweet and nothing could be more bittersweet than just a hope for victory. Also the last book is going to be titled A dream of spring and would imply just dreaming of spring arriving instead of it actually happening.",19,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

Most of all though, a sudden revelation like this seems like one of the top things I could think of that would drive Jamie to the edge and end up having him choke Cercei to death.

To those who might doubt that he'd want to, I've known people who've had sex with people they despised. He may even have done it out of love for Jamie (to save his feelings) and to stop the family from dying out.  This could even be one of the many reasons why he feels guilty throughout the show and tries to make up for it by switching sides.

Is this a common theory?  Do the books make any suggestions on this front?

Edit: Getting a ton of negative comments on here.  I want to clarify that this is just a question, not a theory. I know this is highly unlikely, I'm just interested in seeing if there's a reason (maybe in the books) why it's impossible beyond how much they hate each other.

It was a great two months. Anyway I'm finally ready to jump into the full fandom of GoT now and wanted to ask the question of who's your favorite team up. I'm not sure if this has been asked before but to start I wanted to choose a rather odd couple in my opinion. I personally really liked the relationship between Arya Stark and Tywin Lannister given the circumstances. (I know Arya would have loved to kill him) but the interaction between them flushed out Tywins character a lot and sort of made me like him more.

She's retired and we're chinese immigrants, so I was afraid to because of the sex (from episode 1), swearing and a little of the gore. 

Was afraid she may think I am watching violent porn. Absolutely unjustified concerns it turns out. 

Before I decided I actually searched here how it turned out for others yet didn't find anything from people introducing their parents from more conservative cultures.
Thought I'd share it in case others are reluctant too. 

Go for it, the show is a cool interest to share with your parents and they are more like you than you think. I'm super glad I did.

So let's jump into it: We believe that Jon and Dany will betray the side of the living and join the night king, we believe this from the following pieces of information (note that this theory only works because of a section from the books that is different in the show): So at the start of the books when some men of the nights watch go beyond the wall well everyone knows what happens, but its something about what happens that brings us this theory. During this part of the book when, well i guess ill say leader of the group is killed, it says that he is stabbed by 12 white walkers in unison (keep that number in your head) so that means that there are 12 white walkers, and possibly 1 more being the night king. Following this later on in the series when we get to the part where one of Craster's sons is taken into the woods, we are shown that there are 12 white walkers standing behind the night king as he goes to get the child. So now we get the 12 thing that I told you guys to remember: 12 WW's stab the member of the nights watch 12 men are killed at Daenerys's wedding jon takes 12 companions north of the wall there is a story about the 13th lord commander of the nights watch that states he took 12 men north of the wall on a mission and he later becomes the night king (not on this mission though I'm pretty sure) Now you can see just some of the links of the numbers of 12 and 13, but there is more. After me and my friend finding these connections I decided to look up if the number 12 and 13 meant anything and we found this: - ""the number 13 has a specific meaning. And this meaning is perfectly illustrated by the symbolic aspect of the Last Supper, Jesus' last meal with his 12 disciples (Judas being the 13th apostle, the one that will betray Jesus).""

So, that quote says ""Judas being the 13th apostle, the one that will betray Jesus"" So, the 13th betraying the 12

Now, Back to my connections of the numbers 12 and 13 i said: - 12 WW's stab the member of the nights watch - 12 men are killed at Daenerys's wedding - jon takes 12 companions north of the wall - there is a story about the 13th lord commander of the nights watch that states he took 12 men north of the wall on a mission and he later becomes the night king (not on this mission though I'm pretty sure)

Let's look at them backwards just because the last one ties into the second last one: 4th connection: - there is a story about the 13th lord commander of the nights watch that states he took 12 men north of the wall on a mission and he later becomes the night king So, the 13th lord commander betrays the men he took with him and the nights watch by becoming the night king. --&gt;Follows the meaning of 12/13 from the bible

3rd connection: - jon takes 12 companions north of the wall if jon follows the steps of the previous lord commander (which we think he will because of all the connections) he will betray the 12 --&gt;follows the meaning of 12/13 in the bible

2nd connection: - 12 men are killed at Daenerys's wedding Weaker point but I guess dany betrayed the 12 by letting them die --&gt;follows the meaning of 12/13 in the bible

1st connection: - 12 WW's stab the member of the nights watch weakest of all the points but I guess you could say that that 13 betrayed the 12 by not being a white walker xD

Alright, guys this theory still needs a bit of work if you guys want to do some research into what 12 and 13 could mean in this case then feel free to do so, and know this theory still has some holes so don't hate too much if you don't think it to not be possible.",11,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Now you are probably thinking ""that's crazy and what evidence do you have for it""

Evidence:

- for starters if Jaime is the Mad King son (which I think he is) then he would have a claim

- In the original outline Jaime was suppose to take the throne for himself. But were as he got the throne in blood it he original draft, he will get it as a hero saving everyone in the final version of the story.

- Jaime hero's journey parallels Jon's. They both start out as nothing (metaphorically in Jaimes case) and come on top and a lot of people think Jon will be king but I think it will be Jaime.

- Jaime obviously has the skills and leadership to be one.

- finally it would fit with the unpredictability of GOT.",30,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Season 7 made me hold a bit more stock in this idea...especially after he stole Heartsbane (made of Valyrian Steel). Given that we're all well versed in GoT lore, I don't need to go into detail about the whole Nissa Nissa thing and how AA will have to stab his love...blah, blah, blah.

Regardless, I always said  ""if this were to be true, there is no way that Sam would ever kill Gilly. Not even to save the realms of men."" However, I recently realized that he would stab her with Heartsbane in order to protect Little Sam in the event that she were killed and resurrected as a wight.

If this were to happen, the sword could go in as Heartsbane and come out as the flaming sword Lightbringer. I also like the idea of both Sam and Jon losing the women that they love, Gilly and Dany. Then, at some point in Season 8, the show could call back to one of their first scenes together (when they said their vows and first became members of the Night's Watch) and have them recite the words once more: ""Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.""


Those vows, recited by Sam and Jon years later, would carry a great deal of weight and be more relevant than ever...showing that they've essentially embodied what it means to ""be the shield that guards the realms of men"".

Its odd to see how so many fans simply accept the premise that conquest is a valid source of legitimacy within Westeros. In developing the history of Westeros, GRRM has made it quite clear on what happens when this principle is taken for granted and the Riverlands exemplify the consequences. 


First, let's start by examining what Right of Conquest means in real life. In International Law, it refers to the right of a **foreign** conqueror to claim the territories of the defeated **nation**. That is, it applies to the ownership of *territory*, not the right to the *throne*. In other words, its a method of *extending* your kingship over a greater region, but it **does not grant** you kingship. Which means, it applies when 2 sovereign nations go to war with each-other, but it doesn't apply when a vassal overthrows the king. I'm repeating myself here because this is an important distinction to keep in mind going forward. [1]


The second thing to keep in mind is the difference between a character saying ""X is king because they conquered"" and ""X is king by the right of conquest"". The first is a simple statement of fact. It implies that regardless of any legal right or justification, one can hold the throne through sheer military strength. The second statement presumes the existence of the legal principle. It presumes that conquest actually does grant legitimacy to one's kingship. [2]


Keeping these 2 points in mind, consider exactly what would happen is a ruler actually claims publicly that he he rules by right of conquest. If he establishes ""right of conquest"" as a valid legal principle within his own kingdom. He might have the military strength to keep others cowed for now, but there is no way to be certain of the future. He has just told his vassals that if any of them think they can overthrow him, they are all welcome to try. And these vassals will keep trying - frequently. Even if he somehow manages to maintain military hegemony during his lifetime, his descendants will live and die with the same sword hanging over their heads.[3]


One way for a ruler to maintain his superiority in this context would be by keeping his vassals weak and dependent. And that would be accomplished by limiting their economic and military growth. Paradoxically, this would end up creating yet another incentive for those vassals to gang up and overthrow their king. A king who limits the prospects of their prosperity is not one worth following.[4] 


Further, establishing this principle is necessarily going to create political disunity. If people believe that military might is the key to power and what was lost in a war can be regained by another one, it'd result in an endless cycle of war with every faction vying for military superiority.[5] 


**In short - if any ruler is stupid enough to establish ""right of conquest"" as a valid legal principle to determined legitimacy, then he would end up losing his throne, fracturing his kingdom and destroying his legacy.** I do not believe that any of the kings we've seen would be stupid enough to do that - not Robert, not Renly and definitely not Aegon the Conqueror. Aegon went to great lengths to legitimize his rule through other means - he wasn't a vassal of any of the pre-existing kings, which meant he was a foreign conqueror and the right of conquest would apply here. He got himself acclaimed by the existing kings (never mind that he killed those who refused). And he got himself anointed by the Faith - so his right to rule was more of a ""divine right"" than ""right of conquest"".[6] 


Having laid this out, let's turn to the Riverlands. Riverlands are an object lesson in what happens when the ""right of conquest"" is accepted as a governing legal principle. In Westeros, Riverlands is the only example of a failed state - a nation that lost its sovereignty because of political strife, failure of leadership and internal feuds. [7]


Contrary to popular belief, its not the geography of Riverlands that makes it so weak, but its internal division because at some point, they tacitly agreed to let conquest determine kingship. Every other kingdom justified its kingship by claiming descent from some heroic, semi-mythic, almost ""divine"" figure of the past - thus claiming a divinely granted dominion, instead of mere force of arms. You had Brandon the Builder for the Starks, Lann the Clever for the Lannisters, Garth Greenhand - the mythical High King for the Gardeners of Reach, Durran Godsgrief for the Durrandons of Stormlands, Artys Arryn for the Vale. Riverlands' failure in doing the same type of nation-building has been a roadblock to their growth for thousands of years. [8]


The Blackwood/Bracken feud is the oldest and most famous blood-feud in Westeros and it serves as a microcosm of ""right of conquest"" in practice. Both noble houses claim that they used to be the rightful kings and the other their vassals until they were overthrown and supplanted - and that now they are fighting to get reconquer what was lost. Multiple dynasties have risen and fallen in Riverlands - but because of the lack of internal cohesion, instead of building on the work done by their predecessors, they keep having to start from the scratch every time. [9]


House Mudd was the first we have with some degree of a complete historic record. And Riverlands were pretty united under Tristifer IV Mudd who decisively blocked the Andal invasion for a generation. But when his successor proved less than effective, the Tullys betrayed him and went over to the Andals instead. Rather than finding a ""legitimate"" successor (there had to be some younger brothers or sisters married into other houses) or rallying behind a unifying figure like Artys Arryn, the Riverlords (and Andal warlords) decided to break up into petty kingdoms and started vying for supremacy.[10]


House Justman was the next one that managed to conquer most of the Riverlands and unify it under one rule. But once the direct royal line ended, Riverlands fell into anarchy once again. [11]


House Teague gave it a shot at conquering the Riverlands, but kept facing one rebellion after another. When they decided to bring in the Faith for support, House Blackwood responded by inviting the Storm King to help them in the rebellion. And once the Storm King had won, he decided that he didn't want to hand power back to the Riverlords and annexed the entirety of Riverlands as his territory. [12]


Later, when the Hoare kings invaded, the Blackwoods (loyal to Storm Kings), tried to fight - but then the Brackens backstabbed them and helped the Hoare kings drive out the Durrandons. Except, now the Hoare kings decided that they didn't want to leave and Riverlands became a territory of Iron Islands. [13]


And ofcourse, as soon as Aegon invaded, the Riverlords sided with him in hordes to get rid of the Hoares.[14] 


**Conclusion:** The Riverlands show us what happens when people try to legitimize kingship through conquest. And a king would have to be really, really stupid to use an appeal to force as justification for his claim. A ruler has to be very careful in establishing policy and precedent and he has to keep the long-term peace and stability of the kingdom, as well as his own legacy in mind while doing so. Therefore, while military might can be used to **enforce** his rights/claims, he can never acknowledge his military to be the **source** of his right/claim.[15] ",29,6,False,spoiler,,,,,

Now my knowledge of the lore is limited, I havent read up on it in a while so someone correct me if I get some things wrong. Given the story of Azor Ahai, the man who forged light bringer had plunged the sword into water and a lions heart, both times failing to create the weapon that would save him and the people of Westeros from the long night. It wasnt until he plunged his sword into his lovers heart that created lightbringer from this sacrifice and ultimately assisted in the win over the long night.

Now a very common theory is that Jon will be doing this himself, plunging his sword into Danys heart in the ultimate sacrifice to save Westeros. But I always liked to think of it going a step further. This threat to Westeros is the worst its seen in years. Perhaps this time around the soul of a loved one wouldnt be enough. 

Imagine the War rages on, the people of Westeros are near the brink of extinction. Not many people are left alive, Dany has only Drogon left. Theyre backed into a corner and theres only one thing left to do. Create lightbringer, fulfill the prophecy and the prince that was promised saves the day. Whats more powerful than the soul of a person? I would assume the soul of a dragon. How cool would it be if Jon fulfilled the prophecy of Azor Ahai and created lightbringer by plunging his sword into the heart of Drogon? That would be quite the ultimate sacrifice.

Just throwing things out there, but I always thought this idea would be pretty freaking cool.",12,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

Aegon is obviously the third dragon in the books, but will they bring him out of nowhere in the series?  Or will they combine him with another character or just leave him out?  What do yall think?

He has a better claim than Daenerys, but she is very popular and we all want to see her take the Iron Throne.

I know he would take care of the baby no matter what because

1- He was an innocent child

2- He was Lyanna's son that she made Eddard promise to protect

But consider his point of view. Some dude abandons his wife and children, kidnaps your little sister and rapes her. His father murders your dad and brother and then asks for your head. Eddard had every reason in the world to hate Rhaegar with all his might, and then found himself forced to take care of that dude's rape-conceived baby (as far as he knew) and ruin his honor by bringing a ""bastard"" home. He was shamed for it, and his wife never forgave him for cheating on her, having a child with another woman and bringing *that same child* home to her.

Just shows to what degree Ned sacrificed himself just to protect Jon. Other men would have just said ""Lyanna's dead anyways, so screw this kid"". But Ned did not. He stained his reputation by taking care and raising his sister's rapist's child.

These two probably have the worst cultures of all - they have no concept of money or trade and all they want to do is raid, rape and pillage. As useful as it might be in a time of war, eventually, the ruler would want to bring peace to the Seven Kingdoms and these practices can't be allowed to continue. 

Now sure, you can forbid the Iron Islanders with threats and tell the Dothraki ""Thanks for your service. Bye-bye now"" - but that's just kicking the problem away without dealing with it. The Dothraki would go back to Essos and start their pillaging ways again. Meanwhile, the Iron Islanders will seethe and foment and wait for a chance to plunder again. And about once every century, they'd attempt a rebellion, only to be put down.

1343,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-3-21,2018,3,21,8,85xii5,self.gameofthrones,[SPOILERS] Prove Me Wrong: Jon Snow = Moron,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/85xii5/spoilers_prove_me_wrong_jon_snow_moron/,Doongusmungus,1521588680,"This tirade pertains exclusively to the events taking place in Seasons 6 and 7. Seasons 1 - 5 Jon Snow was a hella decent character, and that's most likely due to his show material still being drawn from G.R.R.M's writing at that point in time. 


**Claim**: Jon Snow is a moron.


**Reason 1**: Taking into account that Jon Snow had 0 idea Sansa Stark + Petyr Baelish were going to save the day at the Battle of Winterfell, he should have perceived the coming battle as a guaranteed loss; end of story. He simply did not have the numbers (which he himself states). He does offer a bit of reasoning behind his decision to proceed with the battle anyway (""Battles have been won with worse odds."") However, he offers 0 strategies that might compensate for his lower numbers. Contrast this with the Battle of Blackwater Bay where Tyrion, faced with the knowledge that Stannis's forces were enough to take King's Landing, devised the wildfire strategy to at least have a fighting chance. You might think that with insufficient numbers AND a lack of brilliant strategy that Jon Snow would at least heed Sansa's advice to not fall into Ramsay Bolton's traps. However, what happens at the very beginning of the Battle of Winterfell? He falls into Ramsay Bolton's -obvious- trap. 

**Reason 2**: Despite not having anywhere near the numbers needed for a victory at the Battle of Winterfell, Jon Snow goes ""eff it"" and decides to proceed anyway. If the battle had been lost, the results would have been -disastrous- for the houses that decided to remain loyal to the Stark name. Sansa Stark would also be placed in extremely hot water having galloped around the North inciting a rebellion against House Bolton. This extreme lack of care about the fates of these individuals is almost entirely contradictory with the value Jon seems to place on Rickon Stark's life. It's also entirely contradictory with Jon Snow's concern about preparing for the fight against the White Walkers. How does a suicide mission help that cause in any way?


**Reason 3**: Accepts the ""King in the North"" title. After the disastrous and tragic events that followed Robb Stark's crowning as King in the North, Jon Snow should have known better than to hastily accept the same title that inspired jealousy of and betrayal towards House Stark (which culminated in the Red Wedding). Indeed, the vast majority of houses in the North remained obedient to House Bolton until the Battle of Winterfell was won. What on Earth makes it a good idea to call yourself King of all these houses? Is that not  guaranteed to lead to spite and hatred? Why would Jon Snow trust the loyalty of the houses who didn't even support him against House Bolton?

Also, why would Jon Snow accept such a title while Ned Stark's trueborn and capable daughter is sitting right next to him? Jon Snow is characterized as the kind of guy that cares a lot about honor and doing things ""the right way"". Knowing Westeros's culture and extreme bias towards bastards, the most pragmatic thing to do would be to support Sansa Stark as Queen in the North. She has a stronger claim AND Jon Snow knows she's not a moron. This makes sense as Sansa effectively won the Battle of Winterfell and is therefore responsible for the North being liberated from House Bolton. Without Sansa it would've been ez pz for House Bolton to squash Jon. 

**Reason 4**: Jon Snow decides to let the Karstarks and Umbers keep their castles, titles, and lands. The houses that decided to support Jon in the Battle of Winterfell were effectively sacrificing themselves out of loyalty. The odds of winning were absolutely awful and they pressed on anyways. They put their necks out for the Stark family and sent their sons and daughters to violent deaths to honor their oaths. Instead of rewarding these families for their sacrifice and providing an incentive to remain loyal to the Starks, what does Jon Snow do? He  prioritizes the ""unfair fate"" of 2 children (who aren't even being executed) for their family's horrible betrayal. Put yourself in the shoes of the houses who fought for Jon in the Battle of Winterfell. Imagine your sacrifices and bloodshed being completely disregarded even though Jon Snow would have NEVER been King in the North without their assistance. 

In addition to a lack of incentive for loyalty, Jon Snow now establishes the precedent that traitorous houses need not worry about their children when they decide to screw House Stark. Their children pretty much have ""insurance"" which gives would-be traitors an ENORMOUS amount of security. They now know that their children and the future of their house are A-ok regardless of the misdeeds they pull off.

**Reason 5**: Probably the freshest evidence in everyone's memory is how Cersei is literally about to swear to support the fight against the Night King contingent on Jon Snow remaining neutral. Jon Snow's entire character revolves around prioritizing the fight against the Dead. That's literally what his entire arc is about. Jon Snow recognizes that if not everyone cooperates to stop the Dead they are pretty much dead. 

What does Jon Snow do? Swears loyalty to Daenerys Targaryen in Cersei's face. This RUINS the entire point of negotiating with Cersei to begin with. This RUINS Westeros's best chance of surviving the fight against the Dead. Just like other characters say, he could have simply lied and attempted to secure Cersei's assistance. But nope. For some reason he let his loyalty to Daenerys completely outweigh his concern about defeating the Army of the Dead and saving Westeros. (Please don't counter that Cersei was going to dishonor her vow anyway; Jon Snow did not factor that into his decision at all). 


**Conclusion**: I honestly feel that this might all be on purpose. It reminds me of Rhaegar Targaryen (who everyone said was an amaaazing person and ruler omg *fangurl squeal*) who decided to run off into the sunset with Lyanna Stark, screwing over his house and pretty much inciting Robert's Rebellion. It's just displeasing to me how the climax of this story seems to be revolving mostly around Jon Snow/Daenerys Targaryen when one of them is just a ""mad dog without a strategic thought in his head"" and seems to face 0 consequences for his impulsive choices.",53,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

I should mention I haven't read any of the books, have watched all of the show, and look online to find most of my lore/backstory info.

From what we know in the show, Leaf and the Children of the Forest created the Night King after stabbing a First Man in the chest with a dragonglass shard. Leaf told Bran that the Children created the White Walkers as a defense against the invading First Men during their war with the Children. 

According to what I've found online regarding the origin of the White Walkers, they were said to have appeared during the Long Night from the Lands of Always Winter (far north of where the wall now stands) and began to push south. The Children and the First Men united against the WW and fought them back to where the wall now stands where Bran the Builder erected the Wall using ice and magic and the Watchers on the Wall formed to keep watch north of the Wall.

Where I'm confused is the time between the creation of the Night King and the Children/Men pushing the WW back behind the Wall. Was the NK the only WW Leaf and the Children created and then he created the other Walkers, or did they make a bunch? Did the NK leave to travel North and this is where he began his own army of the dead? I know the Children and First Men eventually signed a peace treaty, does this mean the WW didn't work? How did the NK and/or WW just slip north and how were they able to become so powerful before either the Children or First Men could stop them? If they were able to push the dead back and build the wall why stop there, why not kill NK and the WW then and there?

I'm so damn anxious for season 8 that I'm driving myself crazy with prophecies and lore but this one threw me a bit, any answers or even speculation if it is not explicitly known would be appreciated!",44,6,False,spoiler,,,,,
1354,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-3-21,2018,3,21,12,85yzgn,self.gameofthrones,[SPOILERS] Roose Bolton &amp; Rickard Karstark theory,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/85yzgn/spoilers_roose_bolton_rickard_karstark_theory/,TheDeepestOfCover,1521601941,"THEORY: Roose Bolton worked actively behind-the-scenes to have Rickard Karstark accompany Robb Starks party to Riverrun, in the interest of getting him out of Bolton-occupied Harrenhal. He may have also privately encouraged Karstark to take out the POWs Willem and Martyn Lannister. Hear me out.

This only occurred to me after revisiting the scene at Riverrun where Robb, Catelyn, Edmure, Blackfish, and Talisa debate how Rickard Karstark should be punished for killing the young Willem and Martyn Lannister, both of whom had recently been captured by Edmures forces. 

For a moment, it struck me as odd that Roose Bolton wasnt in the room, as Robb up to that point had rarely come to a major decision without at least bouncing the idea off Roose. (Regardless or whether Robb actually took his advice). Of course, I soon remembered that there was a perfectly good excuse for Roose not being present at the meeting: he wasnt in Riverrun. Robb had instead tasked him with holding Harrenhal while he and the rest of his inner circle traveled to Riverrun to attend Hoster Tullys funeral and discuss their next moves with Edmure and Blackfish.

On paper, this was a reasonable decision on Robbs partclearly, he considered Roose his most capable general, and viewed Harrenhal as a key strategic position important to hold onto. 

What makes less sense, however, is Robbs decision to bring Rickard Karstark along to Riverrun as part of the delegation. Karstark tells Robb point-blank that he considers attending the funeral a pointless diversion, so its not as though he was an admirer of Hoster Tully eager to pay his respects. Indeed, Karstarks relationships with both Catelyn (over freeing Jaime) and Robb (over breaking his agreement with the Freys by marrying Talisa) were badly strained at this point.

By contrast, the only person outside his own family who Karstark seems to get along with is Roose Bolton. Granted, they only have one scene of dialogue together, but it establishes that Karstarka miserable prick to pretty much everyone else we see him interact withdoesnt dislike Roose. 

On the contrary, one could argue that Roose plays him quite skillfully. Recall that they enter Harrenhal at the same time, shortly after we see Robb, Catelyn, and Talisa get their firsthand look at the devastation. Karstark marvels, in awe and disgust, at how the Mountains forces had left so many Northmen *slaughtered like sheep.* Roose echoes this sentiment: *the debt will be repaid, my friend,* he assures him. *For them, and for your sons.*

Rooses use of the word friend is interesting here, as I dont recall him ever describing anyone else that wayindeed, it would be somewhat out-of-character. Id say with about 99% certainty that Roose is being disingenuous here, as there is a potential advantage in cultivating a relationship with Karstark as his disillusionment with Robb grows. 

The exchange continues, with Karstark openly skeptical of Rooses assurances that justice will eventually be done. *[My sons] rot in the ground while their killer runs free,* Karstark says bitterly. *The Kingslayer wont be free for long,* Roose replies, *Ive sent our best hunters after him.* Karstark says nothing more, only glaring in Catelyns direction before storming off. 

Even though we never see Roose and Karstark onscreen together again, its possible that they might have had additional exchanges offscreen, while both were stationed at Harrenhal. Roose was perhaps the only person outside his family who Karstark could vent to about his bloodlust toward House Lannister in general and Jaime Lannister in particular without being scolded.

Considering both his tension with Robb/Catelyn and his indifference to Hoster Tully, it arguably would have made more sense for Karstark and his forces to remain at Harrenhal with Roose than accompany the royal party to Riverrun. Putting some distance between them for a few weeks might have been a good enough excuse for Robb in and of itself.

Heres the thing, though: Rickard Karstark remaining at Harrenhal could have presented a real difficulty for Roose Bolton. Roose wasnt lying when he told Karstark that he had sent his own people to search for Jaime. Obviously, he couldnt guarantee that Locke would be able to find Jaime and bring him back to Harrenhal alive, but there was a strong possibility of that happening. If Karstark was present at the Harrenhal when Jaime arrived, history suggests that he would have once again wanted to execute him on the spot.

Which Roose probably would have had a difficult time talking him out of. To the extent that Karstark has any positive feelings toward Roose, its likely because he views him as a like-minded comrade. Roose ostensibly agreed with Karstarks hard-line approach and moral outrage; had Roose wavered, in his eyes, its very easy to see Karstark turning against him. Quickly and dramatically.

There were few if any good outcomes for Roose with Karstark being present at Harrenhal when Jaime arrived. If Roose orders Jaime taken into custody, Karstark likely suggests a summary execution; a reasonable enough proposal, given that Jaime had previously escaped custody and killed a mid-ranking Northern soldier (Karstarks son) in the process. Lets say that Roose is able to talk him down, on the rationale that they should wait for Robbs okay to carry out a death sentence. Probably the best-case scenario for Roose, but even then, Karstark likely demands that they immediately send a raven to Robb letting him know that they have Jaime back in custody, complicating Rooses secret hopes/plans of conspiring with the Lannisters. Its at least equally possible that Karstark *wouldnt* back down, probably forcing Roose to pull rank on him. This would also strain their relationship, and Roose would have to decide between hoping for the best that Karstark wouldnt go rogue and kill Jaime against his orders or imprisoning Karstark himself as a preventative measure. (Which would likely result in tension between Bolton and Karstark forces).

Beyond that, it also seems that the Karstarks abandoning Robbs cause was the key ingredient for Robb deciding to reopen negotiations with the Freys, which needed to happen to set up the Red Wedding in the first place. Attempting to patch things up with Walder Frey was very much a last resort for Robb, given both Walders reputation as a slippery character *and* the fact that he had legitimately pissed him off by breaking the agreement to marry one of his daughters. Had he been able to hold onto the Karstark forces, there would have been considerably less urgency for Robb to reach out to the Freys.

Rightly or wrongly, Catelyn, Edmure, and Talisa all believed that if Rickards life was spared, there was a good chance that they could keep the Karstark soldiers in their ranks. Its advice Robb considers, and seems to regret not taking very quickly, when the Karstark forces do leave as predicted.

With all this in mind, its not hard to picture Roose privately suggesting both: a) that Robb bring Karstark to Riverrun with him,  on the rationale that the presence of this hothead at the Harrenhal garrison could complicate his ability to maintain order; and b) that Karstark should just do whatever he feels he has to do, as Robbs approach probably isnt going to get him the vengeance for his sons he so craves. 

I should note that there is nothing to indicate that Roose knew of the Lannister boys being captured and held prisoner at Riverrun before Robbs party left Harrenhal. Still, absence of evidence isnt necessarily evidence of absence. Getting Karstark out of Harrenhal was near-essential for Roose; Karstark killing the Lannister boys and setting that whole chain of events in motion might have been an unexpected bonus. 

One final point: Tywin Lannister complains on several occasionsto his generals and later to Varysthat the intelligence they get out of the North is severely lacking. Interestingly, however, he learns pretty quickly that the Karstarks have abandoned Robbs army and marched home. Tywin frames this to Tyrion and Cersei as effectively the final nail in the coffin for Robb. *His days are numbered,* Tywin says ominously, although neither Tyrion nor Cersei yet knows of the Red Wedding plot. In retrospect, Tywins tone has a sort of *all goes according to plan,* vibe, so perhaps Roose made a point of delivering this news to Tywin (probably through an intermediary) as soon as he could confirm it.",5,14,False,spoiler,,,,,

It's safe to say that Jaquen brought her there solely to help her complete her list. He knew she wouldn't become an official FM the whole time. Although the ""No One"" business has always sparked some confusion, I thought of a logical explanation for it. The FM man can't go and kill whoever they want which is known, ""A girl has taken a life that wasn't hers to take."" Jaquen killed at Arya's request, and the victims of the FM are at others request. I think The reason Arya had to become ""No One"" is because ARYA wanted them dead. If she was going to train as a FM she couldn't kill them herself its against the rules to that's why she had to become No One. If Arya wanted them dead then that's a separate person, so the alter ego No One being a FM can kill them for her just like the other FM kill for others not themselves. see what im saying?

It seems a little muddy. Rooses scolding of Ramsey for losing Sansa seems to emotionally effect Ramsey. At the time of the slaying, Roose clearly states that Ramsey will always be his first born, suggesting that his inheritance remains secure, though the Karstark subordinate is clearly not the least bit surprised by Ramseys execution of his father. 

Even though Ramsey has never shown fear or remorse in any other setting, he clearly respects and even fears his father right up until the murder. Executing  Walda and her newborn child clearly disturbs Ramsey to the point of not being able to watch and potentially shedding tears. 

What advantage do the Karstak subordinates (and presumably other houses) have for supporting Ramseys potentially premeditated plot to kill his father? ",6,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

If so what would that mean? Would he be king at the end (with maybe Sansa or Arya as his queen)? and could the Blackfyre pretender be someone else Perhaps Varys?

We see him develop his network of little birds and hone his skills at manipulation and deception. We see his introduction to the nobility and the beginning of his rivalry with a dangerous young man from the Fingers.

But imagine if the Night King was really smart, and instead teamed up with Cersei? If he's smart enough to know that she would probably do anything to win the war that she was previously at disadvantage in anyways. Whether or not she'd even wants to though, the NK could easily get her into a position where it's her only option for survival either way. 

This would give the Night King a couple pretty huge advantages that simply killing everyone and making them wights wouldn't give him.

1. Every single human Soldier that he could acquire from a Cercei Truce would now be essentially x2 Soldiers for him. Any human that dies will become a wight, without having to take any of the losses he may have had trying to build a wight army from scratch with her army fighting back. Part of their deal would just be that she keeps all capable fighters and whatever select bunch of people she wants to keep alive, and he would just kill the majority of the non soldier citizens to build a new wight army. This would also save him having to deal with the issue of Eurons army being able to easily elude him in the water, since they are loyal to Cersei, so potentially another full army he may have not been able to get otherwise, x2. Cersei's ruthlessness and willingness to do whatever is necessary to win would make her the perfect, maybe even the only, person that the Night King could come to an understanding with. Whether or not the Night King is aware of that fact or not though, is another question, but he has been shown to have access to considerable and meticulous knowledge/information about their world, and whats going on in it.  

2. Having an army of humans as well as wights would give him a whole other dynamic he wouldn't have otherwise. Wights are hard to kill but they have their flaws. Having an army that can think and act for themselves would give him more strategic options i.e. people to operate Cersei's Dragon killing machines, more strategic minds then just his, and Eurons fleet.

Honestly I think she would jump at the opportunity, especially since we still really have no idea what the Night Kings true motives are, he may have no problem sincerely agreeing to let Cersei and the rest of the people that would join his fight and survive live in peace afterwards and keep Kings landing. If he eventually does want everyone dead, then he can simply make that offer while holding her at gun point with the dragon and she will surely agree. It could even be her idea, maybe he's about to finish her and the last survivors off and she yells something about her fleet, and she helps the NK realize the potential that could have.  I think it's safe to say that he will definitely want to keep some humans as allies though, given that human sacrifices are how he creates more white walkers as far as we know right now (or at least have some very valuable use to him). As seen with the truce he and Craster had earlier in the show. Cercei seems like the type that would have no problem with a few sacrifices here and there.

As for the other details that have been predicted, most of them could still exist within a twist like that. It would create a pretty insurmountable enemy for the good guys though, but not a whole lot worse then having to defeat the Night King and Cersei separately. That could also open up the possibility of Cersei becoming some kind of half breed as well, like maybe they could have some kinda crazy relationship similar to the night's king and the female white walker, or maybe her child could become a white walker, making her more loyal to them since she loves her children so much.

Though it would be a massive advantage for the Night King to try, the act of having a meeting with Cersei rather then destroy her might be to risky for the NK, if someone tries to take him out while he's vulnerable. Also GRRM might not consider it for the fact that it might take away to much from the human vs human conflict he's talked about before. But who knows it could be done in a way that it wouldn't, it all depends, and they would need some equally crazy ideas on the other side coming from all the other unresolved character arcs that are still floating around to balance it out. It just kinda popped into my head so I thought I'd get it out there.

I already know the answer to that from the books, but I'm concluding that it has a different and more significant meaning in the show? 

1) I remember that in Season 1, Daenerys became worried after hitting her brother, saying to Ser Jorah: ""I hit him?!, I hit The Dragon!?!"" 

""Your brother Rhaegar was the last Dragon"" - Countered Ser Jorah.

2) The instant after Viserys' death by fire, Daenerys says: ""He was no Dragon. Fire cannot kill a Dragon"".

It's clear that 'Dragon' in the show is not simply a metaphor or another meaning for 'Targaryan' just like in the books, but rather has another meaning, because Viserys is undoubtfully a Targaryan yet not a Dragon. 


So my two questions are:

- What does Dragon actually mean in the show? does it mean that they cannot be killed by fire? or maybe that they can ride a dragon?

- If Rhaegar was the last Dragon, but now we finally discover that Jon Snow is Rhaegar's legal son, does that make Jon Snow a Dragon as well?",44,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

**Features:**

 * Quick and easy access to 100's of pages of interesting information
 * Instantly jump to all related information for *anything* you tap
 * FREE + NO ADS
 * No data usage - WORKS OFFLINE
 * Roll-the-dice button to randomly discover details or brush up on your trivia
 * No weird permissions needed (just photo access - I think to use my own background images)
 * Fun style to put you in that Game of Thrones mood
 * Easy to frequently add more info (if there are any details you'd like to see added, just point me to them).

**Example Uses:**

You're wondering ""Which episode got the most viewers?"" just hit ""Number of Viewers,"" find the biggest number, and tap it to see the episode title, summary, writers, director, etc. Then if you're wondering ""I wonder which episodes were written by this same person.."" just tap their name and see all of them.

Or, if you're trying to remember which of the Great Houses is in which Region, or what the Landscape of each Region is, nothing is more than 3 taps away. 



---


The next big feature I'm working on now is having a YouTube thumbnail &amp; link for each detail screen. Also, probably going to add a custom link to find related products on Amazon.

I built the app in a framework that (in theory) will allow me to also put out an iPhone/iPad app, but I have to jump through a bunch of hoops that I haven't braved yet. Let me know if this is important to you!

**I invented, designed, and coded this thing *all by myself,* so any feedback is MUCH appreciated!**

Thanks for checking this out!

1. Jon sacrifices himself to save everyone because that's just what he does, and the show ends with Daenerys on the Iron Throne.

2. Because all Daenerys has ever wanted is the Iron Throne and Jon has literally no interest in it, the show ends on an ironic note with Daenerys dying right before achieving her goal and Jon being forced to become King.

Which way do you think is more likely? I'm leaning towards the second, as it seems to fit the Game of Thrones writing style more.",39,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

**Was Tywin Lannister an evil man?** A lot of people seem to think that that's not the case. That while his actions are evil by our modern standards, he was simply a product of his time and society he lived in. He is ruthless and pragmatic because he needs to be and fans often point to certain povs to bear it out. 


But I don't think that's an accurate. I think Tywin should be and is considered evil even by the standards of his time. Sure, seizing or destroying enemy assets (or destroying your own to stop the enemy from getting their hands on them) and civilian deaths is a part and parcel of medieval warfare. But even in this context, people draw the line at unnecessary and wanton rape, murder and destruction. We've seen the more ""moral"" leaders draw that line - for example, apart from the Sack of King's Landing, there were no examples of atrocities committed during Robert's Rebellion. And its not like these terror tactics are particularly pragmatic - Arthur Dayne, for example, actually treated commoners well during his campaign against the Kingswood Brotherhood which caused the outlaw movement to lose their support. In contrast, Tywin's actions in the Riverlands were directly responsible for the creation and continued success of the Brotherhood without Banners. Similarly, while women are seen as property and peasants as of lesser value than noblemen, no one, even in this world would argue that Tywin ordering the gangrape of a 13 year old girl wasn't evil. 


There is a frequent element of ""Ends justify Means"" used in Tywin's defense. But that would be the misuse of that principle. What that principle actually means is that if your ultimate goals are moral and beneficial to everyone, then any short term harm done by your methods is worth it. But Tywin doesn't want to bring prosperity to the realm or peace and security to its citizens - he's looking for power and to establish a Lannister legacy. He wants all the others to be weaker and dependent on him - he wants them to be subservient to him. Neither his means, nor his ends are justifiable. 


**Given his character, would he have made a good ruler?** People argue that he'd have made an *effective* one and given his skills, that'd be correct, but is that good enough? 


Once again, here people argue the ""20 years of peace and prosperity"" he brought to the realm as Aerys' Hand. But consider the source here - its his own family singing his praises and that has to be taken with a grain of salt. And based on the other things Maester Yandel wrote in AWOIAF, its clear that he was trying to curry favor with the new Lannister regime. 


So exactly how prosperous was Tywin's Handship? In Westeros, the nobility and the wealthy merchant class would constitute at most of 5% of the population, whereas 95% is made up of smallfolk and commoners. Whom did Tywin's prosperity really benefit? 


We know that one of Aerys' predecessors, Aegon V, had spent a lot of time and effort trying to introduce reforms that would improve the lives of these commoners. Give them better protections against the excesses of nobility. And Tywin started his Handship by undoing whatever was left of these reforms. We know that the royal coffers were full of gold when he left - but is that supposed to be a good thing? Government money is not meant to sit idly by - its meant to be spent improving the living conditions of people. That's the reason why almost every country in the world has a National Debt. His reduction in tariffs saw an improvement in foreign trade - but do we know if any of the Smallfolk ever saw any benefit from that? He punished bakers who mixed sawdust with flour and butchers who sold horsemeat - but whom does this benefit? The rich who can now enjoy unadulterated food would be happy, but the poor who could only afford it when it was cheap due to adulteration are unlikely to thank Tywin for it. Indeed, building and repairing roads is the only public work benefiting everyone that I can credit him with. 


Tywin's rule seems consistent with his worldview. He seems to focus on benefiting the elite political class that actually wields the power and completely ignores the disenfranchised majority. Whether or not any of the benefits actually trickle down to the commoner's lot is a matter of chance. 


I've often argued that simply having good intentions without the political skill to make it happen makes for a poor ruler. But on the flipside, having political skill without the right goals doesn't make for a good ruler either. Where Tywin is concerned, sure, he'd be making some improvements which would stand testament to the Lannister legacy. But in the end, he might do more harm than good. 


Justice would be in short supply under his rule, IMO. Ned was willing to execute one of his bannermen for dabbling in slavery - but do you see Tywin making a similar choice? All his bannermen are valuable tools and I don't think he'd discard one just because he screwed over some peasants. The protection he affords Clegane is evidence of that. Sure he'd reduce tariffs to foster trade - but he is just as likely to increase taxation to compensate for the loss of income. Taxation that would end up worsening the income inequality in Westeros. And if any of his vassals grow too powerful, I can see him deliberately inciting a rebellion in his domain to weaken him. Tywin is definitely not above fostering violence simply to relatively strengthen his own position. He is likely to even weaponize systemic corruption - much like Littlefinger did in his tenure as Master of Coin. 


Tywin's disregard for custom and social morality certainly doesn't make him a better ruler. Consider the the implications of the Red Wedding with one specific example - the farmer and his daughter we saw in season 4. The farmer obviously did not have enough food to last him through winter in that small hut of his. And any silver he might've saved up would be useless once the snows get bad enough to prevent any travel. So how are peasants like him expected to survive the winter? They go to their liege for safety. They leave their homes and farms and head to the closest lord's castle where they can expect to be afforded the Guest Right and protection for the length of winter. But now that the Guest Right doesn't mean anything and Lord Frey is in charge, he and thousands like him have nowhere to go. Does Tywin understand these implications? Would he even care if he did? Small wonder that the smallfolk hate him so much. 


All in all, I'm not certain that he'd make a good ruler no matter how politically effective he might be. Under his rule, I'd expect Westeros to start a definitive slide towards tyranny with more and more power being concentrated at the center and in the hands of a single family and the lower classes getting fewer and fewer benefits. 


**TL;DR** - I don't think Tywin's actions should be excused as those of a ""man of his time"" - we've seen men of his time being better than that. He is evil even by Westerosi standards. And a man like that - focused only on personal power and family legacy - has all the makings of a tyrant. Which means, despite being an effective politician (or because of it), his rule would've been a bad thing for Westeros.

My second favorite is Brienne of Tarth's fight with the Knight of Flowers. She ends the fight by straddling her opponent and pulling a knife. The fight between her and Clegane, Clegane attempts the same thing which she defends against.  

Having said that, I have a prediction about Jamie Lannister.

Season 5, episode 4, Jamie and Bronn go to Dorn and have a little bromance on a beach. They have a conversation about how they want to die.  Jamie says, ""In the arms of the woman I love."" I predict he will die and be in the arms of Brienne of Tarth. 

Thoughts?

The situations stands like this: Catelyn has taken Tyrion prisoner and gone to Vale. Tywin calls his banner and prepares to go to war with the Riverlands in retaliation. Edmure calls his banner to defend his lands. 

What's interesting in this series of events is that Tywin seems uncharacteristically stupid in his actions, while we get a rare glimpse of Ned actually being a good politician. For these reasons, I believe these events deserve a lot more focus than they are given. 


**Tywin's Response:** First, let's take a look at Tywin's decision to go to war with Riverlands. No doubt, whoever told Tywin also told him of the charges Cat levied against Tyrion. At this point, Tywin is completely ignorant of the Lannister conspiracy at KL - he doesn't know that his children are screwing each-other or that his grandkids are products of incest or that any of them had a hand in Arryn's death. But he doesn't care. All he cares about is that someone arresting a Lannister makes his house look weak and he cannot have that. 

What's interesting here is that a peaceful resolution would've actually been of much greater benefit to Tywin. Westerlands and Riverlands aren't independent kingdoms whose only option is to go to war over something like this - they have the Iron Throne as the superior authority they answer to. And Tywin wields a lot of political clout with the throne - given that it owes him a large debt and the Lannisters have infiltrated all parts of the government. Tywin could've appealed to the King for justice here and used his clout to get his way. Played right, he could've gotten Ned fired as Hand for abusing his authority and forced Robert to name himself as Hand. Even if Tyrion ends up dying in captivity, it still works out in Tywin's favor - his hated son is dead, but he showed everyone who's the boss by getting his enemies banished from the court. 

But Tywin's pride wouldn't allow this. He wouldn't go begging the king for justice like some common peasant. No - the slight to House Lannister has to be answered by House Lannister. This kind of thing is common with Tywin - he often let's his pride and ego get the better of him. 


**Plausible Deniability:** To his credit, Tywin is not completely blind to the consequences of his actions. By starting a war, he would be breaking the King's Peace and he'd risk bringing the wrath of Iron Throne down on his head. Which is why he wants to goad the Tully's into breaking the Peace first. By sending Clegane to raid and pillage in Riverlands as an incognito brigand Tywin accomplishes 3 objectives: first, he bleeds Riverlands of their strenght, second, he undermines the commoners' confidence in their nobility by showing them that they cannot protect their own and third, if the Riverlords retaliate, Tywin could claim that they were the ones who started the hostilities and he was the one defending himself. 

As cunning as this decision sounds, there is a glaring oversight here. Tywin sent his most recognizable lackey to do the job and there is no reason for him to expect that the Riverlords would act the way he wants them to. He under-estimated Hoster Tully, who instead chose to petition the king instead of simply retaliating. He sent a delegation to KL to identify Clegane as the perpetrator and Tywin as the mastermind and to ask express permission to retaliate in kind. 

This one move risks turning the tables on Tywin. Now he'd be the one branded criminal and traitor. Which is what makes this oversight surprising. Did he think that the Riverlords would never consider getting permission from the king? Did he think that Robert would simply dismiss their accusations? Or that Cersei would prevail on him to stay out of it? The kind of risk he is taking here doesn't befit his image as a cautious and pragmatic man. 


**The Trap:** Later on, Tywin indicates that he was laying a trap for Ned. That if he managed to take him hostage, they could've exchanged Ned for Tyrion and settled the whole thing. The fact that there was a trap waiting for Beric Dondarrion proves he wasn't just making stuff up. Ofcourse, Jaime attacking Ned in KL screwed up this plan. But even so, this plan seems particularly stupid for a guy like him. 

The only way this plan works is if Ned blunders into this trap as ""Ned Stark - Catelyn's husband and relative of Tullys"" and not as ""Ned Stark - Hand of the King and Executor of King's Justice"". The chances of former being the case is close to zero. 

Let's look at this from the Iron Throne's perspective - 2 of Robert's Lords Paramount are going at war with each-other. Robert might be willing to smooth over a kidnapping and hush up a street brawl, but this kind of political upheavel cannot be ignored. To allow this to happen, would show that Robert is too weak to control his bannermen and any considerations of weak kings being the bane of kingdoms aside, Robert's own ego will not allow it. He is obligated to intervene here and shut it down as firmly and decisively as possible. 

So when the petition reaches the court, King's Men are going to ride out to resolve this mess. And most likely, Robert himself would lead the charge. Let's not forget that Robert hates his kingly duties, but he does enjoy making war. Chances are that he'd leave Ned behind to rule while he deals with his mess personally. And if Tywin attacks Robert, he has just made an enemy of every other kingdom - none of whom particularly like him. 

But let's say Ned is the one sent here - in which case, he'd go as Robert's representative. He is the Hand of the King and an attack on him would mean that Tywin has just defied the Iron Throne. In this scenario, Robert would have to marshal his forces and crush Tywin decisively just to save himself from political embarrassment. 

Let's see the expected reactions from other Houses here: Once Robert brings in the Baratheons into the mix, the Tullys and Starks would naturally join up with them. Lysa might keep the Arryns out, but that's something no one would expect. The Tyrells would see their opportunity to get rid of Cersei and put Margaery in Robert's bed - so they'll jum in as well. The Martells have been waiting for their shot. And the Greyjoys would pounce the moment they sense vulnerability. 

With this foreseeable outcome, I cannot imagine what Tywin was thinking here. Did he really think that Robert was too gutless to actually intervene? Or did he think that Ned would be too stupid and honorable to ask Robert's permission before riding out to defend his wife's family? There is underestimating your enemies and then there is completely misreading the political situation and this seems more like the latter. 


**Ned's Response - the Good and the Bad:** To his credit, Ned has a solid grasp of the situation and the players here. He completely sees through Tywin's intentions and figures out Hoster Tully's hand in it. And his response shows that Ned is NOT the honor-bound idiot everyone seems to think he is. 

Rather than keeping this a war between the Houses Stark/Tully and Lannister, he makes it about keeping the King's Peace and chooses to mobilize the Crown's forces against Tywin Lannister. This is probably the first time he uses the power of the office to commit the Crown in supporting the Tullys. 

But it wasn't an unqualified success. There are a couple of odd things about Ned's decision. First one being him sending a portion of his own men with Beric and thus further weakening his position in the capital. 

What's more odd is that he sends only 120 men to deal with this. Here there were conflicting reports of how many outlaws there were - some said 50, others over a 100 and some suggested hundreds and hundreds. What is clear to Ned, however, is that Tywin is behind it and he has a lot more men than just a 100. 

So why send such a small force here? I think Ned might've been giving Tywin an out in order to avoid a full-blown war. A small force like this indicates that they are only there for Clegane and if Tywin acknowledges Clegane went rogue, the issue can be settled here and now. But if Tywin doesn't and attacks them, then Ned has the just cause to bring the entire might of the Iron Throne on Tywin's head. 

But if Ned was thinking that far ahead, why didn't he send Loras with them? Doing so would've made sure that Highgarden would be involved in the ensuing conflict and they'd be firmly on Baratheon side. If Loras gets killed at Mummer's Ford, there goes any chance of a Lannister-Tyrell alliance. The contradiction between sending so few men and not sending Loras doesn't make sense to me. 


**Stroke of Luck:** Given the setup here, one cannot but see how lucky the Lannisters got with Robert dying when he did. And make no mistake, it was pure luck. 

When Robert went hunting, it was for a White Hart that had been sighted in Kingswood. No matter how drunk Cersei got him, hunting a stag wasn't going to get him killed. Fortunately for the Lannisters, that stag got killed by wolves before Robert could get to it - so he turned his attention to a monstrous boar deeper in the forest. 

Forget about all he political moves being made here - if Robert gets home having killed the stag, he hears of Tywin attacking men under *his* banner in Riverlands and then he has no choice but to start a full campaign of subjugation against him. 


**TL;DR** This is a discussion about Tywin's opening attack on Riverlands using Clegane as proxy and how shortsighted and risky it actually was. In contrast, Ned shows off some of his political chops by completely outmaneuvering Tywin and placing him in a bind, even though he could've done an even better job of it. It was sheer luck that this misguided action didn't cause the fall of House Lannister.

1540,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-3-24,2018,3,24,21,86sp8a,self.gameofthrones,[Spoilers] Historian's Fallacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/86sp8a/spoilers_historians_fallacy/,genkaus,1521894311,"Fans of the series love criticizing or crediting the characters for their failures and successes and there is a lot of judgment and discussion going around regarding which characters are smart/stupid, astute/naive, pragmatic/honorable and so on. But in my experience a lot of these judgments rely on the benefit of hindsight bias. A lot of fans argue that these decisions/events/actions were smart or stupid and consequential or flukes based on how they affect the narrative. 


This is a big mistake, in my book. If we take destiny for granted and assume that things happened because that was the only way they could happen, then none of the characters can be criticized for their actions. Criticizing or praising these characters for their choices relies on the assumption that their choices mattered - that they were capable of choosing differently and if they had, the outcome would've been different. 


Now this is where Historian's Fallacy comes in. The historian's fallacy is an informal fallacy that occurs when one assumes that decision makers of the past viewed events from the same perspective and having the same information as those subsequently analyzing the decision. For fans analyzing the series, it manifests itself in 3 ways:

1. Where events happening beyond the characters knowledge affect how their choices play out. Whether these are events happening in secret or whether they are happening far away doesn't matter - they are often used as evidence regarding how wrong or right a character was in making certain decisions. For example, Ned trusting Littlefinger. 

2. Where the subsequent events are regarded as direct, necessary and foreseeable consequence of certain actions. These consequences, especially if unfavorable, are used as evidence of exactly why the action that led to them was a mistake. For example, assuming that Catelyn was responsible for the war because she arrested Tyrion. On the flipside, fans also credit other characters with unwarranted foresight if events end up happening in their favor. For example, crediting Littlefinger for Tyrion's arrest, as if he knew all along that it'd happen. 

3. Using different values and perspectives to judge a character's competency in context - this one is also known as presentism. For example, crediting Tywin for the ""master-stroke"" of the Red Wedding. 


I think the worth and ability of characters should be judged based on what they know (as compared to what they should know), how the react and how well they can foresee the consequences of their actions. Consequences that happen due to forces or events outside a character's control or knowledge is not something they deserve to be blamed or praised for. 


What are the examples of judgments based on hindsight bias that irk you the most? Where you consider criticism or credit is unwarranted? Conversely, what the examples that others would consider good or bad based on hindsight - but you consider to be good or bad regardless of consequences? That is, you that the character did make the right (or wrong) choice based on the information they had and the foreseeable consequences, but an argument from consequences is unnecessary? 


Edit: I'll share some of mine:

Judgments that rely on hindsight:

- Blaming Catelyn for the war because she arrested Tyrion. At the time, she had every reason to trust LF and Lysa, Ned was still Hand and Tywin had options other than starting a war. It was a risk, but a calculated one - not an action of a stupid, impulsive woman.

- Crediting Cersei for the ""right"" moment of Robert's death - Her plans were so poorly thought out that its a miracle they succeeded at all.

- Judging Ned as naive and stupid for losing the game - Ned was actually quite astute in whom to trust and he had every reason to trust Littlefinger at the moment. Even so, his trust was measured. People forget that Cersei's victory here was a very close-run thing - meaning Ned wasn't as out of his depth as people presume.

- Blaming the Red Wedding entirely on Robb's ""stupidity"" - This judgment over-estimates how consequential Robb's ""mistakes"" were and what role events outside his control played in it. Even Word-of-Martin disagrees with the level of blame put on Robb here.

There are other examples here, but I hope to address them in the discussion below. ",6,10,False,spoiler,,,,,

Yes, Tywin despised the fact that Tyrion was a dwarf and drank &amp; whored his money away but he also saw potential in his youngest son. Unlike Jaime, the arrogant warrior, and unlike Cersei, the conceited queen, Tyrion was--like Tywin--pragmatic and could be ruthless at times. However, let's not forget that Tywin arranged the marriage of Sansa to Tyrion which was a smart political move on his part and gave Tyrion higher status.

With the rest of the Starks presumably dead, Sansa was no doubt the Lady of Winterfell and Tyrion was, through his marriage, the Lord of Winterfell. Once Sansa gave birth to a son Tywin could've easily revoked Roose Bolton's claim as Warden of the North and installed her son as Warden with Tyrion acting in his place till he came of age. Now, let's be honest, the Northern Lords would've probably despised Tyrion at first due to his last name but if they got to drinking with him I think they would've at least found some common ground with him.

If Tyrion had succeeded in securing peace in the North and ensuring a Lannister-Stark rule I think Tywin would've named Tyrion as heir to Casterly Rock since Jaime would've stayed in the King's Guard and Cersei would've still been forced to marry Loras (since the Sparrows would've never taken power). 

Tywin may have acted cruel to his youngest son, but arranging Tyrion's marriage to Sansa Stark proves that he at least wanted one of him to succeed where Jaime had failed. But, of course, thanks to Littlefinger and Olenna that all went down the drain.

EDIT: Just fyi, I am not at all saying Tywin was a kind and caring father who was good to him his entire life. All I'm saying is that he saw potential in Tyrion and used it.",61,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

A Tarly boy thought he could end the war by killing Robert after his horse had taken an arrow. 

Mine was some Tarly boy at the battle of Summerhall, Robert says. My horse took an arrow, so I was on foot, slogging through the mud. He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with a single swing of his sword.

Robert of course crushed him but that made me start thinking of scenes involving Sam because unlike the Tarly boy in Roberts story, Sam is no dumb high-born.

When we first meet Sam, he is shown as a coward. His whole life he's been a coward. His father disowned him because he was ashamed of him not living up to the family name. Fast forward to Sam taking his fathers sword and then forward again to when Sam is in old town talking to Gilly right before they leave:

""Are you sure you want to do this? You've always wanted to be a maester."" In which Sam replies, ""I'm tired of reading about the achievements of better men"".

I propose that all these scenes are foreshadowing Sam dealing the final blow to the Night King, finally being the man his father wanted him to be. He will do this wielding Heartsbane.

If you want to take this theory a step further. The Nissa Nissa is Gilly and Heartsbane turns into Lightbringer through the prophecy. Yes, it's a Sam Azor Ahai Theory.

In the Histories and Lore, it was mentioned that the Children of the Forest warred with the first men. The first men had bronze and they had numbers and they were superior in warfare. They were completely destroying the CoF in warfare. The Children used all the magic they could, but they still couldnt defeat the Men. In a Hail Mary move, they used dark magic to turn the numbers of the first men against them. This, Im assuming, is the army of the dead. The more their people die, the more enemies they have to fight in the battle field. 
Im assuming the CoF didnt create the White Walkers because its said that the FM and the CoF joined forces against a common enemy (this was also shown in the series on Dragonstone in the cave) and drove them back into the deep North and Bran the builder built the Wall. 
If the White Walkers were a branch of the CoF, possibly corrupted by black magic or maybe the Children who actually cast the spell to make the Army of the Dead and it backfired on them, then that would explain a few things. It would explain how the Night King can raise the dead. He simply uses the magic of the Children, most likely because he had it. It was impossible for the first men to copy the magic of the Children (and the magic man has is different from that if the Children) is its more likely that the NK actually has this magic with him. 
It also gives him a motive beyond must destroy and reasons. He is pissed that his people were kicked out of their homeland and hes come back to destroy the occupiers and take his home back. 
If you look at the CoF and the WWs then theyre faces even look sort of similar. 

Please, let me know what you think. 

Edit: Maybe my theory needs to work out a few kinks, but I dont just believe the WWs were created to just destroy. There must be some motive. ",7,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Despite all the intrigue and conspiracy they are involved in, they seem quite content to let things unfold instead of being proactive in seizing the opportunities. 


Consider the Freys, for example. Old Walder gets a new wife everytime one dies even though he has more Freys than he knows what to do with. He is also constantly approaching different lords for marriages and wardships. Or consider the Tyrells - the moment they get a foothold in the Royal court, they start putting their men in the Small Council, including trying to get one of their Maesters to replace Pycelle, they get Loras into Kingsguard and they try to immediately steal Sansa. 


Compared to them, the Lannisters practically did nothing while they were this close to the Throne. 

- Cersei is screwing Jaime and all her kids are bastards, but she is really careless when it comes to hiding it. Both Varys and LF know, sure, but even Stannis starts catching on and its hinted that Renly might've known as well. 

- Even though she knows that both Jon Arryn and Ned are investigating, she never makes a move to deal with them. She got incredibly lucky that LF happened to have reasons to get rid of them himself. 

- Even though Pycelle is already a Lannister spy and stooge, she never gives him any instructions or directions. When Jon was poisoned, Pycelle decided on his own to withhold care expecting that this is what Cersei would've wanted - but she never told him to do so. The idiot also never tried to distract Ned from his investigation - another thing Cersei could've done to buy time. 

- When Robert decides to name Ned Hand, Cersei response is to pin her hopes on Ned refusing - which is why she doesn't press the issue. That seems pretty stupidly passive - to hope that someone refuses status or honor and then it happens to fall into your lap.

- The Lannister response to Bran's coma? Hope that he'd die or even if he wakes up and tells everyone, just pretend he is making stuff up. 

- There is no indication that Cersei ever tried to cultivate LF as an ally before he came to her offering her the goldcloaks. Not only did she not run away when Ned gave her the chance, she didn't even try to take action against him. 

- Her attempts to kill Robert were similarly half-assed. Goad him into a fight hoping someone lands a killing blow? Get him drunk on the hunt hoping he gets into an ""accident""? 

But Cersei isn't the only one here:

- Tywin keeps talking about not wanting Tyrion as his heir, but he never does anything to disinherit him. He doesn't send him to become a maester or a septon - even though there were talks of these possibilities. 

- He never remarries in an attempt to create another marriage alliance or get a new heir for himself. 

- Clearly he wants Jaime to inherit - but he never makes any attempt to get him out of the Kingsguard. Post Robert's Rebellion could've been the perfect opportunity - say that Jaime did the right thing, but admit that some token punishment was in order for breaking his oaths. So how about being dismissed from the KG? Sure, it'd dishonor Jaime, but we know that Tywin isn't above getting a bit of mud on his cloak. 

- He never tried to infiltrate the Small Council like the Tyrells did. Couldn't he have atleast tried to get Kevan appointed as the Master of Coin? 

- A lot of his political actions - reinstating Pycelle, marrying Tyrion to Sansa, naming Tyrion Master of Coin - happen to be reactions to the encroaching Tyrell power. 

- He missed the opportunity in the North presented by the Wildling attack, saying ""Let the North bleed"". His inaction here gave Stannis the chance to act and regain the momentum for his bid for the crown. 

Edit: Missed one for Tywin:

- He never tried groom a successor to ensure the continuation of the Lannister legacy after his death. This is a world where men die of natural causes in their fifties and Tywin was much older. Even Robb understood the necessity of not leaving chaos in the wake of your death. For Tywin, Jaime was unavailable and uninterested, Cersei was inadequate and he really, really hated Tyrion. Had he died of natural causes, it was likely that Tyrion and Cersei might've fought over the Rock (witha few cousins in the mix) and that infighting might've destroyed his legacy anyway. 


Even Tyrion isn't exempt here:

- Tyrion was in court for a while before Jon Arryn died. What was he doing there? Why was his sent there? Surely Tywin didn't send him to sit around? ""A tool for every task and a task for every tool"" - isn't that what Tywin said?

- Whoring and drinking - 2 of the things Tyrion had in common with Robert. They could've become close friends by bonding over this - but it doesn't seem like Tyrion made any attempts to make inroads with the king. 

- Given his intelligence, Tyrion could've sought a beurocratic position in the court long before things went to crap - so why didn't he?

- Tyrion knew all along that Littlefinger was behind the lie that got him arrested and started the war. And yet, he never even tried to deal with him. Nor did he tell his family about it - as evidence of why they shouldn't trust Littlefinger either. 


I'm sure you can find excuses for individual example, but taken together this constitutes a pattern of behavior which is hard to explain. So why were Lannisters so passive? Did they just think that things would turn out in their favor simply because they were Lannisters?",47,13,False,spoiler,,,,,

Ironically their both pretty incompetant as well. I.E. Edmure attacking a mill and failing at his job to lure the mountain. 

 Julius Caesar(Considered by the masses ""The man of the people"" for all his reforms. For instance, addding many new members of the senate to better represent the interest of the masses then just the privileged.) Brutus thought killing Gauis was for the good of the people, killing the ""tyrant"" and saving the republic, like his great great ancestor had killed the last king of Rome, the treasonous senators thought if Brutus dealt the killing blow, the people would love him. Instead, he ironically was the one that brought upon the downfall of the republic. The events that happened later as a result of the assassination transformed Rome into an empire and the rest is history. I often wonder if not for Brutus, mankind might have put it's first man on the moon 1000+ years ago.

I guess it's both a bad cast and good cast at the same time. But I prefer not to see an actor as someone else from a different story. I wish the actor that played Mark Antony was cast in some role rather then the actor of Brutus :(",11,18,False,spoiler,,,,,

- This would basically be redemption for Tyrion because he ""feels bad about the children"" and he loved his nieces and Nephews, plus he still shows some emotion for Cersie. 

- If would be interesting if the baby ended up being a dwarf after all of the talk for years of Cersie hating Tyrion for being a little monster, and killing their mother in childbirth. Now shes faced with the same fate. It is incest afterall and has a chance to be a dwarf even though her other kids turned out normal.

- I feel like Tyrion is going to end up with Sansa. Her endgame will be she got what she wanted in being a ruler, but she didn't get her handsome young prince. She is obviously more humble and has grown up a lot with all she has been though so I think at this point she could find happiness with Tyrion. 

- Cerise told Tyrion over and over the give Sansa a child, and it will make her happy, he was adamant that he would not sleep with her.  Well the ironly is they will be raising Cersies child instead of their own.

1749,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-3-27,2018,3,27,21,87i1v9,self.gameofthrones,[SPOILERS] Most Evil Character - Discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/87i1v9/spoilers_most_evil_character_discussion/,Vacanus,1522154142,"With GoT being on a long break, and most of us probably rewatching the show to get our fill, I decided to answer a frequently asked question: 

Who is the most evil character on GoT?

Before I start, this is likely going to be a lengthy post.

And before I get into the characters, I am going to define evil. An evil action is an action that is meant to harm, torture, manipulate, or even kill another person. Essentially, an evil action is an action that is intended to cause someone else misery or harm. Therefore an evil person is someone who wishes to do bad, and cause others harm, or anything that will impact them in a negative way. 

A couple other differences that I am going to clear up:

There are very few pure evil characters in GoT, many characters are evil. To be considered pure evil (by me at least), a character must have NO redeeming qualities whatsoever.

Pure evil characters therefore are: Euron, Ramsay, Gregor

Evil characters include: Joffrey, Cersei, Littlefinger... etc.

And the last thing before I get into the characters:

Psychopaths/Sociopaths.

The way I (and most leading experts in the field) differentiate them is that a psychopath is a person born without a conscience, or the ability to truly emotionally connect with anyone. They are cold blooded, essentially predators. They also have reduced fear, and are easily bored. Psychopaths can not empathize with others, or feel remorse for their actions. 

Sociopathy, on the other hand, stems from bad environment, neglect, or abuse. These people can still empathize, but to a much small degree than most people. They also have a conscience, but as mentioned, it is to a MUCH smaller degree.

Now, to get into the actual characters:

I think it fair to say that the characters who are obviously in this debate are:

Ramsay, Euron, Joffrey, Roose, Gregor, Littlefinger, Cersei, Night King. 

Now, I am going to claim that Joffrey, Cersei, Night King are absolutely not the most evil, despite the fact that they have all committed horrible crimes, they all have, even if they are very minor, redeeming qualities. 

Cersei loved her children, Joffrey loved Margaery, and was a bit of a coward, Night King we dont know enough about, and may even be a character we know. 

In my opinion, the 3 most evil characters are, Euron, Ramsay and Gregor.

Roose was more of a sociopath, someone who was willing to do anything to survive, and would betray anyone on a dime. Kind of... maybe... cared for his son/sons...? 

Littlefinger was similar to Roose, an incredible manipulator, albeit a coward in the face of real danger. Definitely a sociopath, and not even the worst. 

Gregor, despite having no real intelligence to speak of, is a psychopath who didnt hesitate to burn his own brothers face, for the smallest inconvenience. He also frequently rapes, and murders people. However, it is worth noting that he does work for Cersei, but this is after being brought back, and Im still iffy on whether or not hes being mind controlled/just working for money... etc. Regardless, hes still a horrible person. 

Ramsay is a sexually sadistic psychopath who takes great pleasure in physically, or mentally harming others. Ramsay is without question the most sadistic human to ever set foot in Westeros. 

Euron is a sadistic (not sexually sadistic) psychopath, and a malignant narcissist (an extreme force of narcissism often coupled with sadism). Euron rapes and murders his own family, and is an incredible manipulator. Euron is likely the most psychopathic person to set foot in Westeros. 

Euron and Ramsay are undoubtably the two most evil characters in the show, and possibly in the history of TV. However, I believe that Euron is likely the worse of the two, despite not showing us as much as Ramsay has. 

Euron isnt a sexual sadist, so not every scene with him is going to be torture porn and him skinning people alive. However, this doesnt mean that Euron wont torture/rape someone, he just wont get off while doing it. Euron is incredibly callous with his torture, and will even torture his own family without batting an eye. Euron tortures his own men, family and more, and enjoys it, but is also callous towards others suffering. Euron is also an incredible manipulator who can change his personality on a dime. But his true personality is likely the darkest one in Westeros history. 

Ramsay, despite being horrible, is a one trick pony. Yes he tortures people in the worst ways imaginable, but so does Euron, and unlike Ramsay, Euron will also do other things that are just as horrific, if not worse, and even revels in murdering his own kin.

So in my opinion, the top 5 most evil characters in GoT go:

Euron, Ramsay, Gregor, Cersei, Roose. 

Thats just my thoughts, any feedback is appreciated, feel free to let me know who you think the worst is. I cant wait to see how the show ends, and Im definitely interested to see what they do with Euron. I hope they didnt introduce him too late, Pilou Asbk is rocking it as Euron!

1800,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-3-28,2018,3,28,20,87r8w7,self.gameofthrones,[Spoilers] Regarding Great Councils...,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/87r8w7/spoilers_regarding_great_councils/,genkaus,1522237732,"Are the Great Councils intended to be legislative committees that are supposed to inform the decisions of future issues or are they more like Kingsmoot - more of a popularity contest that applies only to the current issue at hand? 

Here's the statement by Archmaester Gyldayn that bugs me to no end:

&gt;In the eyes of many, the Great Council of 101 AC thereby established an iron precedent on matters of succession: regardless of seniority, the Iron Throne of Westeros could not pass to a woman, nor through a woman to her male descendents.

The first problem here is that qualifier ""In the eyes of many"". If Jaehaerys had called the Great Council with the intention of it being a legislative assembly weighing in on the matter of succession law, why wouldn't that already be clear to everyone? ""In the eyes of many"" implies that whether or not the Council set a binding precedent is a matter of opinion or perspective. People don't go around saying ""In the eyes of many, Andal law says sons before daughters"" - because what Andal law says is a matter of fact, not interpretation.

The second problem is gender wasn't really raised as an issue during the Great Council of 101. All claims were regarded as valid and it was deemed that Viserys' claim, which had the advantage of *proximity* was better than Laenor Velaryon's claim, which relied on *primogeniture*. The implication being that Laenor was a close second and if Viserys hadn't existed or been a woman or been a great-grandson instead of a grandson, Laenor would've won out. 

The question of whether the throne can or cannot pass to a woman or through a woman was never raised - it was simply determined that proximity is better than primogeniture. 


These two things taken together seem to imply that when the council was called, it was never intended to set a binding precedent. Instead, it was about solving the issue at hand. And then the sexist society of Westeros retconned the Council's decision as legally binding when they thought it was in their interest. 

I tried looking at other Great Councils to see if they made judgments that could be regarded as binding. The second set of Great Councils was about electing regents for Aegon III. These regents served their terms and were dismissed later - but this didn't set the binding precedent that any regent had to be chosen by a Great Council. Queens and Hands could still serve as regents when required without needing to call one. 


The third Great Council weighed in on succession again - but once again, here they did not discuss a matter of law or succession, but they tried to figure out who was the most suitable candidate for a king. They chose Aegon, for lack of any better candidate, but whatever precedent it might've set was never invoked. 


Based on this, my view would be that Great Councils are called to deal with current crises but that is where their authority stops. That using the decision made in one to justify future actions would be a self-serving retcon. 


On the other hand, it would make sense for a king like Jaehaerys to think ahead and settle the matter such that not only is the current crisis averted, but any future similar crises are dealt with as well. It would make sense for him to call the council to settle the matter once and for all so that future generations don't have to keep calling one everytime a problem comes up. 

Also, in a society without a written constitution or a legal code, law is often a matter of perspective. In cases where there isn't an explicit statement by the king or by whatever religious code they follow, if enough people consider something as the law, then it is to be regarded as such. 

If we take this view, then yes, you can justify the Great Council setting a binding precedent. 


I'm not sure which way to lean here. First I thought that option 1 seemed logical and later I leaned towards option 2 - but now I'm conflicted once again. 

Is there any information or perspective I've missing here that would resolve it?

The way that I understand it, if Robert had died but hadn't named Ned Lord Regent, then Cersei would have become the Queen Regent by default. It also seems like the Regent is the one that's supposed to rule and have the power, because the actual King (Joffrey) is considered too young to effectively rule the Seven Kingdoms. If that's the case, why does Joffrey still have any power? I get that he's technically the King, but isn't the whole point of appointing a Regent to strip him of power so that he doesn't make any stupid decisions because he's young? 

And then you introduce Ned becoming the Lord Regent, which means (again, this is just my understanding. I could be wrong) that Cersei is no longer the Queen Regent. This was also before she was on the Small Council if I remember right, so why did she still have any power at all? I understand that power resides where men believe it to reside, but if we're talking on a technical level, how does this all work out? ",8,17,False,spoiler,,,,,

- Arya is obviously talking about Yoren or Jaquen here, but I almost think they secretly wrote ""He'd kill you with his LITTLE FINGER"" referencing Lord Belish AKA: Little Finger. Just a sneaky way of letting us know by the choice of words ""little finger"".
Why else say that. Like I said Arya is not talking about LF but the writers want us to know who the real evil is by using the wording.

- After all he is one of the most evil characters in the show. Even though he hasn't physically killed many, his schemes and motives have gotten many people killed without him being detected. That's a real killer hiding in plain sight. 



- Kind of like the quote a fan noticed in the book about the hound saying ""Bloody Wedding"" referencing the Red Wedding. The hound didn't mean it that way but on re-read you can interpret it like a sneaky shadowing. Just a nice little creative tid bits the writers include to make you think. 

It's hard to explain but you get what I mean.

After the wall was built and the white walkers were sent to oblivion &amp; thwarted beyond the wall, Night King might have foreseen the future about the fight of the frozen lake and how he acquired the dragon and used it to make his way past the Wall. He would have known about all the people who took part in that fight (Jon, Beric, Hound, Thoros etc) and might have been influencing their life directly or indirectly by sending visions in the fire. Now, Night King also took the pain of raising the above people from their death to fulfill what he has forseen(He has a dead army and cleary has the power to raise the dead). Beric, Melisandre and other red priests clearly would have mistaken this as some spiritual magic and on many occasions they metion that no body knows what the Lord of light wants. He just wants to get his things done.

So, if this is true, Night King is the song of Ice and Fire and everyone was dancing to his tune and when the Night King dies, Jon snow dies as well.

This could be a foreshadowing. In Season 7 Episode 6 of the TV show at the battle of the frozen lake:

Beric points his sword towards the Night King and says that there is one another way to end this mess. * Jon : You don't understand. * Beric : The lord brought you back and he brought me back. No one else just us. Did he do it to watch us freeze to death? * Hound: Careful Beric, You lost your priest. This is your last life. * Beric: I've been waiting for the end for a long time. May be the lord brought me here to find it. * Hound: Every lord I've ever met has been a cunt. Don't see why the lord of light should be any different. The camera pans and zooms towards the Night King.

I can see it working two ways and both don't seem likely...

A - you are going to write 8 novels. You get to novel 7 and you have a character do something like ""hold the door"" and then you think... damn, it would be cool if back in books 3,4,5 he always said something that sounded like ""hold the door"" - hodore... Well, I don't see how it could work this way because it seems like when the author is writing books 3,4,5 he didn't know himself what was going to happen in book 7 ?!?!

B - you create this elaborate storyboard that connects all the characters together / major things they do / when they die / who they kill / etc and then you use that storyboard to flesh out each novel as you write it. Doing it this way would ensure that you are laying groundwork in books 3,4,5 for something that finally gets revealed in book 7.

This is in no particular order and I have read the books, so my theory is based on my knowledge from the books and the show, but I am ONLY talking about my theory for the SHOWS ending.
Alright, let's jump into it.
First, Jamie Lannister will die. Before I get into how and why, here are some side notes; 
In the books and the show, Cersei was given a prophecy by a witch of sorts. She is said to have only three children, all of which will die, and also she will be killed by a little sibling. Because of the translation of valyrian, it could be interpreted in many ways, but in Cerseis interpretation, the witch meant one of her little brothers. Part of Cerseis hatred and fear for Tyrion has to do with this, because she is convinced the witch was talking about her brother when in fact, I and many others believe it to be Jamie, who is technically younger than Cersei. 
Another side note is the prophecy Danny saw in the house of the undying. In her vision, she saw the Iron Throne room destroyed and covered in snow. When she walks up to it, she reaches out for it, but does not take it. 
Finally, it is said many times in the books and the show that Jamie and Cersei were born in the world together, and they will die together. They other firmly believe this to be true.
Ok. Notes are done. Here is how I think his tale will end; I believe Jamie will join and fight with Danny, and when everything is all but lost, he will go to Cersei and beg her to surrender and as for pardons. He will go to her and learn that just like the Mad King, Cersei plans on blowing up all of Kings Landing with the cashes of wildfire below the city. This goes along with a lot of foreshadowing in the books, which describes Cersies anger/eyes being like wildfire. Jamie will be enraged, and he will kill her by strangling her to fill the prophecy, but he will be too late; the order was already given, and the he and everyone in kings landing explodes in green flames, fulfilling the idea that they will leave the world together as well as the vision of the snowy and destroyed throne in Danny's vision.
Next, is who will sit the Iron Throne. Again, Danny's vision shows her reaching for it, but she never takes or evern touches it. I think that she will never sit the Iron Throne. She will learn from King Roberts failure that conquerors make poor kings/queens, and as a result she will instead stand aside and return to Dragon Stone after pledging her aligence to whom ever she chooses to sit the Iron Throne.
I also believe Arya will die. I don't really know how, but her story give her no place to rule, unless, and this is very possible, she is chosen to become Warden of the north. 
The only way I see this happening is if Tyrion sits the Iron Throne and sees his marriage with Sansa legitimized with her consent. I don't really think that whole senario will play out though. I think Sansa will remain Warden of the North.
Tyrion will sit the Iron Throne because of course he will. The books and the show talk so much about how great a mind he has, and it only makes sense he sits it IMO. Again, that's just my personal theory. I also hold to the theory that he is Targaryen, but I don't want to get all into that (if you really wanna know just look it up a lot of people believe this or at least agree it's possible).
So what about Jon? I think he will go back to the wall at the end to rebuild it and see that men never again forget the white walkers. Lame? Yes. What?!? He won't live happily ever after with Danny? you might ask? No, is my answer. I think the romance will die with the discovery of his true Father, and when everything is said and done, his Honor will come first as it always has. 
Bran will go back North to the tree, leaving Sansa or Arya as Wardens of the North if they live to see the end.
Idk about Brienne of tarth. She might die in the explosion, or she might die somewhere else...or she might live and continue to serve as the first female in the King's Guard. Who knows. Her story in the books has a totally different path haha.",19,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

So despite years of madness and cruelty, this singular plot was enough to convince Jaime to stab Aerys in the back to prevent the death of civilians. I'd imagine that was also the reason why Robert Baratheon kept Jaime in the Kingsguard.

In S06E10, Cersei Lannister ordered for the wildfire to be ignited, and thus, killed thousands (?) of innocents. One could argue that Jamie's love for her prevented him from speaking out, but what about everyone else? It seems that no one has said anything about the mass murder, and Cersei's infamy remained at a similar level. 

In fact, in season 7, Daenerys and Jon Snow were even willing to enter into negotiations with Cersei for a truce. Even Randyll Tarly, who spoke about not being oathbreakers and backstabbers, didn't mention this when pledging fealty to Cersei and House Lannister.

It allowed Tywin to save KL from Stannis and solidify the Lannister-Tyrell alliance, while at the same time screwing up Robb's plan to lure Tywin back West. There has been a lot of debate on who is the blame here - whether it was a command failure and Robb should've told Edmure his plan or if Edmure exceeded his orders for glory. 

I've seen a lot of back and forth on this, but surprisingly, I haven't seen anyone bring this particular point up - **Robb couldn't have known what his plan was going to be when he left Riverlands. Which means, there wasn't *anything* he could've told Edmure.**


**Strategic Picture**

Here's the strategic picture of the war from Tywin and Tyrion's pov. He is situated pretty centrally at Harrenhal from where he can come to the defense of KL quickly if if its put under siege. Robb can't attack KL with Tywin to his rear. He can't attack Harrenhal because its too strong of a fortress. He can't attack the Westerlands because they are well-defended by the mountain passes of Golden Tooth and Deep Den and they are raising a new army as well. As far as the Lannisters are concerned, Robb has no option but to wait while he grows weaker everyday. The Lannisters are currently engaged in chevauchee against the Riverlands - their raiding and pillaging at feeds their army at the cost of Riverlords and also undermines trust in their new king, who apparently cannot protect his own people. So they expect that Robb's troops will start getting demoralized and start deserting. So they think they can win the war with minimal effort.

There are two gaps in their strategic visions - if Renly or Stannis besiege KL, they'll have to respond and that might allow Robb the chance to attack their rear. And a more subtle one - the Westerlands are not nearly as secure as they believe. 


So here's the strategic picture from Robb's perspective. He knows everything the Lannisters know and how they want it to play out. He also understands the gaps in their vision and the possibility of using the Lannister chevauchee tactics against them. So he makes plans - reaching out to Renly to hurry up and attack KL and reaching out to Balon to attack the Westerlands. But he can't sit back and hope for these alliances to work out - he still has to act. And his plan is to go West *through the Golden Tooth*.


**Objective when he leaves:** 

There is no way Robb could've planned to lure Tywin back west - there were too many variables and too many ways for it all to go wrong to set that plan in stone. And given that it'd have been hard to communicate with Edmure on the field, he has to give his uncle the freedom to respond appropriately without having to check with him first. Edmure isn't some upjumped newbie - he is to be the Lord Paramount of Riverlands and thus expected to act while keeping an eye on the big picture. There are cases where he'd expect Edmure to do exactly as he did.

Robb didn't know about the hidden pass around the Golden Tooth until he got there. His original plan was to force his way through and he was riding with 6000 cavalry hoping to use their speed and mobility to his advantage. So what are the things that could've gone differently and how Robb would expect Edmure to respond?

Let's say Robb has to force his way through Golden Tooth - but the defenses prove too strong. If Tywin gets the news that Robb is fighting at Golden Tooth, he might try to march from Harrenhal and try to take Robb in the rear. In this case, Edmure is absolutely expected to stand in Tywin's way and stop him from crossing the Red Fork. 

Let's way Robb does make it through Golden Tooth, but they were able to send out warning to Stefford Lannister who gets his army of 10,000 ready in time. There is a decent chance Robb might lose this fight - so he'd need a clear path of retreat to Riverrun. One that Edmure would be expected to keep secure - so once again, keep standing in Tywin's way. 

Let's say Robb still manages to beat Stefford Lannister - but he doesn't have enough men to make a stand against Tywin. He can go ahead with his raiding and pillaging plan, but now, Edmure is expected to bleed Tywin as he marches west and then prepare to attack his rear. 

Let's say Tywin chooses to swing south and use the Gold Road instead of crossing the Red Fork and using the River Road, Edmure would be expected to bleed him as much as possible while crossing the Riverlands and at the same time, secure a path of retreat for Robb along the Gold Road. 

Let's say before Robb can attack Stefford's army, Renly speeds up and attacks KL. Or maybe Stannis hires a few sellswords to make up for the lack of men and attacks KL. Either of these would force Tywin to march. If the timing matches up Edmure would be expected to attack Tywin in the rear while he is facing Stannis/Renly. If it doesn't, he is expected to stay put. 

Let's say Balon responds to Robb's offer and their combined forces manage to take Casterly Rock. In this case, Edmure would be expected to stand aside while Tywin marches and then consider the possibility of trapping him between Robb's forces and his own. 


There are too many variables and possibilities here - all of which would require Edmure to react differently. But one thing remains constant - **Edmure must not lose Riverrun**. Robb can't educate Edmure on what to do in each and every scenario - he has to trust him to make the right call as the situation demands and only leave him with the instructions about what is absolutely necessary. 


**So why blame Edmure?**

The defense based on lack of future knowledge that applies to Robb, also applies to Edmure. Figuring out that Robb would have a plan to deal with Tywin would've been hard enough. He couldn't have predicted that Stannis would attack KL right at this moment or that the combined Lannister-Tyrell forces would manage to defeat him.

From Edmure's perspective, he was doing something strategically and tactically smart. He feels that his job here is to guard Robb's rear and make sure that Robb's 6000 cavalry is not attacked by Tywin's ~20,000 men unexpectedly. So Edmure thinks that by standing in Tywin's path, he is doing what Robb would've wanted him to. 


But here's where he bungles up - **The strategic objective of the entire war is to get the Lannisters out of Riverlands**. The Lannisters have been raiding and pillaging the Riverlands for a while now - stealing and burning their food, killing their peasants. Now they are finally trying to leave and you fight to keep them there? So that they can raid and pillage some more? Why on Planetos would you think that that was a good idea?


Sure, bleed them as they pass you by and once they are gone, start preparing an exit route for Robb or reinforcements as need be. But for Seven's sake, let them go. Your lands have already suffered enough.

They come across a woods witch, Maggy, where Cersei demands the witch to give her information on whether or not she will be queen. Cersei's third question is if she and the King will have children. Maggy's response is that the King would have 20 but Cersei would only have 3, who will all die before she does.

From this, you can deduce that Cersei will die sometime within Season 8, considering she is currently pregnant with a 4th child, whether or not it be from Daenerys, or Jon, after they, presumably, defeat the Night King, or if the Night King will make it to King's Landing and there is a final defense for the side of the living, or if she will die in some other way.

___
In the books, Jaime says it was Joffrey that gave the order, maybe ""to impress Robert"", he had thought. And GRRM has confirmed that Joffrey hired the assassin to kill Bran: *""After overhearing Robert's claim that men could end the suffering of a horse with a broken leg or a dog that has gone blind, but that they are too weak to end the suffering of a crippled child, Joffrey steals a Valyrian dagger from his father and hires a servant to kill Bran.""*
___
But Joffrey could not have accomplished this on his own. Simply because he had left Winterfell two weeks prior to the attempt. And you can't trust a random assassin to stay behind and manage it all.
___
Like the Order of the Green Hand stated (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z22hStz-oLs), if the Catspaw had been paid in full two weeks before the murder, he would have ran away with the valuable dagger &amp; the gold right after Joffrey had left Winterfell. Why would he risk his life trying to kill the son of the mightiest Lord in the North when he had already been paid?
___
This means there must have been someone else helping Joffrey in this scheme. Someone that was still in Winterfell when the events took place. 
___
___
On the other hand, if the real intention was to get rid of Bran, why hire a middle-aged local that even struggled against the unarmed Catelyn? A man that looked more like a random farmer wanting to make an extra buck than anything resembling a skilled assassin, fit to kill a Lord.
___
And when he entered Bran's chambers and ran into Catelyn, the assassin said: *""You weren't supposed to be here. No one was supposed to be here""*. 

But everybody in Winterfell knew Catelyn had not left Bran's side in weeks. So this means the assassin had been fed some fresh information, from an insider that had ensured him he would not encounter anybody on his way. A source reliable enough for the Catspaw to be surprised when the intel. proved wrong and he saw Catelyn in that room.
___
The assassin had been deceived. It looks like that someone else Joffrey appointed to oversee the job never intended on killing Bran, but had planned to frame the Lannisters for attempted murder.
___
___
Which raises the question: who was that other person that wanted to turn the Wolves vs the Lions? Who would a middle-aged assassin from the North trust to know when Bran would be vulnerable and alone? Who could have discretely started a fire in Winterfell, while assuring the Catspaw he wouldn't meet anyone by Bran's side?
___
Once you take away the Starks and Theon from the equation, there is only one strong candidate left, the traitorous Maester Luwin. 
___
He was one of the few an outsider would believe to hold accurate information regarding Bran's status. He would have been the one advising Joffrey killing Bran was indeed mercy. And he would have known exactly who to suggest for the job. 
___
Like Martin hinted when he was asked: *""Did Littlefinger influence Joffrey to try and kill Bran?""*; he said: *""Well, Littlefinger did have a certain hidden influence over Joff...but he was not at Winterfell. And that needs to be remembered.""*  

Maester Luwin was the only person in Winterfell that would have been able to sent information to King's Landing and plot framing the Lannisters with Littlefinger (Master of Ravens is a key position for a spy). 
___
And if you pay close attention to this scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFLo7gef6Gs&amp;t=65s (1:05 - 1:50), this series of events could have happened:

- Luwin went into Bran's chambers to talk to Catelyn;
- Right after he left, he told the Cat's paw *""The way is clear. No one is by Bran's side""*;
- He then started a fire shortly after leaving Rob and Cat; 
- At which point the assassin went in the room as he had been advised.
- However, to make sure the man would not kill Bran, he immediately sent Summer after him to protect Catelyn. 

Isn't the timing curiously suspicious? 

___
Why would he have done it? For the same reason Maester Luwin had previously plotted to send Jon Snow to the Wall. Because he is one of the corrupted Maesters, working hand to hand with Littlefinger to turn Starks vs. Lannisters and plunge the 7 Kingdoms into Chaos.
___
___
**In short, Maester Luwin is the corrupted traitor that sent the Catspaw assassin. All to frame the Lannisters for an attempted murder on Bran.**",24,0,False,spoiler,,,,,
