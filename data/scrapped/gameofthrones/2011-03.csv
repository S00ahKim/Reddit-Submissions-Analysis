Here's how GRRM first describes him when Jon Snow lays eyes on him in Winterfell: 

*""Tyrion Lannister, the youngest of Lord Tywin's brood and by far the ugliest.  All that the gods had given to Cersei and Jaime, they had denied Tyrion.  He was a dwarf, half his brother's height, struggling to keep pace on stunted legs.  His head was too large for his body, with a brute's squashed-in face beneath a swollen shelf of brow.  One green eye and one black peered out from under a lank fall of hair so blond it seemed white.""*

[Here is what Peter Dinklage looks like as Tyrion.](http://i.imgur.com/wU79j.jpg)

I have zero problem with the casting, what I do have a problem with the makeup.  Peter Dinklage's Tyrion is a dwarf, and a handsome dwarf at that!  He's certainly not the repulsive deformity that GRRM wrote about.


**EDIT:**  After a few comments, I have begun to agree with the feelings that:  
1. The culture of the world is more prejudiced than ours, and more unaccustomed to seeing dwarves and therefore the would think he is hideous.  
2. The difference between his face in the image I posted above and in later books will be that much more drastic.  I just hope the series is as good as we're hoping and it makes it to A Storm of Swords.",35,6,False,self,,,,,

It got me thinking, and more specifically about what happened during Lyanna's captivity with Rheagar. What if it wasn't Elia to whom Rhaegar was speaking but Lyanna. What if Jon Snow is in not the bastard of Eddard and an unknown woman, but of Lyanna and Rhaegar, and that he is in fact Ageon, ""The Prince that was Promised"" and one of the ""Three Heads of The Dragon."" It would tie two of the most sympathetic characters of the series together, give Daney someone to carry on the Royal line (assuming that she can not in fact have children), and explain why Eddard was so adamant that no one dig too deeply into the identity of Jon's mothers.

Eddard's reason for lying would be simple, if King Robert knew that Rhaegar had continued to have a living heir he would have the child killed, regardless, or perhaps especially due to who the mother was. Robert would have seen Jon as the product of the kidnapping and rape of his true love, and would not spare the child for anything.

It's repeated over and over again in book one that Lyanna made Eddard promise to take her home to Winterfell, but even when Eddard is remembering her dying moments he does not go into detail. What if the larger promise was to protect her son from the man who would be her husband?

What do you readers think? Could Jon Snow really be the son of Rhaegar? Is his real identity Jon Targaryen, or rather Ageon Targaryen? I have no clue but its a thought that popped into my head, ideas? questions? comments? Am I way off base or could I be on to something?",20,11,False,self,,,,,
