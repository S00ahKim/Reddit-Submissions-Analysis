Is there a SPOILER-FREE cheat sheet online somewhere with all of names of things and people with images attached separated by seasons?

This is apparently the convention's second year, but the prices for even early registration seem kind of outrageous for a newer fan run con ($160ish for full weekend, $70ish for single days, meaning this will keep increasing in price closer to the convention). The reviews from last year seem mostly positive, but there aren't many of them (I haven't listened to any podcast reviews, just read some text articles). At first, the cost had me thinking that I definitely won't go, but the reviews are changing my mind.

Does anyone know what were the attendence numbers last year and how much did it cost? I worry that if the con increased its prices too much, it might hurt attendence and snuff itself out (they've already extended the early registration prices, presumably because the tickets aren't selling well). Or was the con still fun last year despite only having attendees that can afford large-con prices for a smaller convention?",4,2,False,self,,,,,

""Oh, somebody is going to be sad watching this."" Not that he was angry, or implied any hints that he could be up to something not good.

Along with that, Kit Harington even says the word 'worried' in the background of the commentary, which connects back to Jeremy Podeswa's (the director of the episode) elaboration where he stated that Tyrion is concerned about their safety (Dany's especially) and whether or not their romance will be dangerous for them and everyone involved; similar to what Peter Dinklage also said in one of the S7E7 'Inside the Episode' commentaries on the HBO/Game of Thrones Youtube channel. 

At the end of the topic, Benioff ends with 'aww, Pete-y' Lmfao. 

I have to say, when I was first watching that scene I also felt sad for Tyrion. When he was finally given a purpose again, he became very close with Daenerys but due to his mistakes and some disagreements they've had she starts to look up to Jon more and it's leaving Tyrion unsure of himself and Jon might become more important to her than he is. So while I do think he's jealous in a way, it has nothing to do with romance. Because he was fine with and already acknowledged the fact that Jon and Dany were falling in love, but that was all before he later saw that they're willing to die for each other and now it starting to look like they won't listen to anyone else except each other (an example is when Dany right away favored Jon's approach in arriving at Winterfell over Jorah's, where he wanted her to be a little more cautious and safe since she's stepping into dangerous territory in the North).

The way people are speculating about Tyrion's reaction I find it very similar to Sansa's at the end of the Season 6 finale where some jumped to conclusions and were drumming up drama without thinking through everything logically. Also it might even be something that won't even be that big of a focus, compared to everything else. We still have to wait and see how Jon reacts to his true parentage and how it will affect his relationship with Dany. D&amp;D have already teased conflict, but similar to this I don't think it will be that big of an issue with only 6 episodes left and the season focusing mainly on the Great War.",14,23,False,spoiler,,,,,

If not then these are my candidates for who shall atleast rule by the end), The reason for this is because I've always wanted too make a post where I listed my fav candidates (weather they are realistic or not) to rule the Seven Kingdoms. Also it is the new year so what better way to begin it then with a post on who shall rule. Now let's begin:

1. Jon Snow- Now out of all of the ones I am going to mention this one seems the most likely too happen and for good reason, Jon while he may not want it is still very Honorable, Good willed, and a strong and fair leader that would be worthy too rule the Seven Kingdoms it would also work with the story as Jon would do it NOT because he wants too but because it will be his duty. As for Dany well I don't think Dany will be alive at the end. NO I don't think she will die from childbirth I think after childbirth she will die some other way involving the dragons, But yeah I don't think Dany will be alive by the end for a lot of reasons but just simply because it be too clean too happy, So I think Jon would be a lone ruler. My only problem with Jon is that he is also too obvious, But if he still did become king in the end I shall take it.

2. Sansa- Now I have always been back and forth on this but I think if anyone becomes ruler at the end (that is not too obvious) Then Sansa I think would be fitting. A lot of people don't think she will be or just don't like the idea, But I think she would be a perfect ruler as she has learned a lot through the series in the books and the show (though in the shows case just alittle longer), Also I think after everything she has been through she deserves it and I think she is ready, and too be honest I think that she is one of the candidates beside the obvious ones (Jon and/or Dany) that are actually very likely too rule in the end.

3. Arya- Now this is more of a wildcard one but I think if they wanted too give a big left field twist then Arya Stark would be the perfect candidate as she is a true Dark horse Candidate. I actually made a post on why I think this could happen go check it out if you want a more in depth reasoning https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/7ll3iq/everything_my_arya_theory_updated/ But I think she would indeed be a interesting ruler and for the story it make a very good twist (for the books and the show) and there is actually a lot of believable evidences from her most likely picking some stuff up from Tywin to the fact she was amongst lowborns most of her life after he father's passing and knows some of the problems they face. Which is why I think it could happen do I think it WILL happen sadly probably not. But that is not to say you can't hope for it too happen, especially if there is some actual evidence going for it (and I would personally love it if this happened). Also fair too mention the story usually picks people who do not want too rule to rule (mainly with Jon).

4. Gendry and Arya- And if not the head ruler then maybe a queen too a king. That king Gendry, Now Gendry would be another dark horse candidate because a lot people don't think he will be the ruler. But if he did I think it also be fitting, He is a lowborn and with Arya would no the problems they face, and in history some of the best rulers were people NOT born of royalty (for the most part anyway), and finally it is his birth right (under Robert's dynasty anyway) and with Arya they would be good rulers for the Seven Kingdoms.

But that is the four candidates for who shall rule. Out of all of them Jon or Sansa seem more likely but I definitely it is possible for Arya, Gendry, or both of them too rule at the end as well.",14,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

I am going to present to you, both show and books, why Arya and Cersei's fates are intertwined.  Or why Arya, not Jaime, is going to kill Cersei.  I have split it into three parts, the first post is the foreshadowing in the show while the last two posts are the instances of foreshadowing, prophecy, and such in the books. The first part is basically a simple show version of my theory, so you can just do part one and be done with it.  But if you like it or would want more detail, then you can read the in-depth analysis of the books in the last two parts of this post.

Before anyone says anything, D&amp;D have said that they are going to end the show the same way as the books.  I use the analogy of the interstate and highway: they wander different paths but they can take you to the same destination.

____

#Part I: Show Evidence for Arya killing Cersei

____

Before we get started, there are two things from the books you must know: the valonqar and lightbringer.  Lightbringer is the sword the Prince that was Promised will wield while fighting against the Great Other (Night King and his company) while valonqar is ""Little Brother"" in High Valyrian and comes from the prophecy Maggy the Frog gave to Cersei.  [The show version does not actually say anything about valonqar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6kQJ9HPpQ4).  And the show does not say much about the Legend of Lightbringer. But the important parts about the prophecy and the Legend are:

&gt;___

&gt;[PROPHECY]:  ""Gold shall be their crowns and gold their shrouds,"" she said. ""**And when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you**.""

&gt; - Cersei VIII AFfC

&gt;___

&gt;[LEGEND]: Being a hero, it was not for him to shrug and go in search of excellent grapes such as these, so again he began. The second time it took him fifty days and fifty nights, and this sword seemed even finer than the first. **Azor Ahai captured a lion, to temper the blade by plunging it through the beast's red heart**, but once more the steel shattered and split. Great was his woe and great was his sorrow then, for he knew what he must do.

&gt; - Davos I ACoK

&gt;___

Now you have the context, here is the evidence in the show that Arya is going to kill Cersei.

1\. [Syrio Forel trained Arya by catching cats.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUjPBtlhBls)

 - This actually has more depth in it in the books.  Arya has been described on numerous occasions as a rat and she has self-described herself as a mouse. [Here's an image with most of the references](https://imgur.com/a/bp3OF).  A Lannister lion = cat. Thus the old cat-and-mouse literary trope.  This goes even further with the fact that the Hound is a dog.  So you have the triad of cat, rat/mouse, and a dog.

2\. [The Hound taught Arya how to euthanize someone by showing her where to find the heart with the dagger](https://youtu.be/EroNA0WdIww?t=31)

 - Maester Lewin was euthanized the same way. The show doesn't give a name to the act of euthanizing someone by stabbing him/her in the heart, but in the books it is referred to as [""the Gift of Mercy""](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Gift_of_mercy).

3\. [Jon Snow's First Lesson to Arya ties to number 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdu_lvCTJA)

 - ""Stick em with the pointy end"" - This is, in fact, [one of two of GRRM's favorite lines in the books/TV show](https://today.tamu.edu/2013/03/22/author-george-r-r-martin-is-visiting-texas-am-talks-game-of-thrones-and-texas-am-libraries/)

4\. [Arya was sent on a redemption mission the kill the actor who played Cersei Lannister](https://youtu.be/rz9HviABPgE?t=39) (The Important part is 0:39-3:30)

 - Arya gives Lady Crane advise on how to play Cersei.  Lady Crane asks for her name and Arya says ""mercy""

5\. [For Hands of Gold Are Always Cold But a Woman's Hands are...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BOneWHLaPQ&amp;t=2s)

 - When Ed Sheeran sings the refrain with the rest of the Lannister men ""For hands of gold are always cold, but a woman's hands are warm"" they sing it again ""For hands of gold are always cold, but a woman's hands are..."" and they stop to look at Arya. The song comes from the books and is a song that is used to blackmail Tyrion.  It is a song about him visiting Shae at Chataya's, and the singer threatens to sing the song to Cersei and Tywin. The hands of gold in the refrain refers to the chain of the hand that is a link of golden hands [which Tyrion used to strangle Shae](http://quizinsight.com/images/how-would-you-die-in-game-of-thrones/strangled600.jpg).  But, given an outside look, when referred to ""golden hands"" not only can it refer to the Chain of the Hand, but also Jaime's golden hand.  And the scene with Arya, Ed Sheeran, and the rest of the Lannister soldiers with Arya saying **""I'm going to kill the queen""**.

Arya is going to give Cersei the gift of mercy by plunging Widow's Wail (Jaime's sword) *as* Jaime. Needle or the catspaw dagger would also work here.  The whole series, in fact, started off with Ned giving Cersei mercy in hope that she would save her children from Robert's wrath.

____

#Part II: Arya as Ned's Mercy

&gt;____

&gt;What strange fit of madness led you to tell the queen that you had learned the truth of Joffrey's birth?"" 

&gt;[Varys asked]

&gt;""**The madness of mercy**,"" Ned admitted.

&gt; - Eddard XV

&gt;____

&gt;""A very skilled assassin.""

&gt;""There are such. I used to dream that one day I'd be rich enough to send a Faceless Man after my sweet sister.""

&gt; - Tyrion X ACoK

&gt;____

The show Ned goes on to elaborate the unspoken truth of why he gave Cersei: that it was to save her children. When Ned stumbled upon the truth while reading *the Lineages and Histories of the Great Seven Houses of the Seven Kingdoms*:

&gt;____

&gt;Yet last night he had dreamt of Rhaegars children. Lord Tywin had laid the bodies beneath the Iron Throne, wrapped in the crimson cloaks of his house guard. That was clever of him; the blood did not show so badly against the red cloth. The little princess had been barefoot, still dressed in her bed gown, and the boythe boy

&gt;Ned could not let that happen again. The realm could not withstand a second mad king, another dance of blood and vengeance. He must find some way to save the children.

&gt;Robert could be merciful. Ser Barristan was scarcely the only man he had pardoned. Grand Maester Pycelle, Varys the Spider, Lord Balon Greyjoy; each had been counted an enemy to Robert once, and each had been welcomed into friendship and allowed to retain honors and office for a pledge of fealty. So long as a man was brave and honest, Robert would treat him with all the honor and respect due a valiant enemy.

&gt;This was something else: poison in the dark, a knife thrust to the soul. This he could never forgive, no more than he had forgiven Rhaegar. *He will kill them all*, Ned realized.

&gt; - Eddard XII

&gt;____

Ned could not keep the truth secret, yet he had fear of what Robert will do of Cersei's children once Ned told Robert. So Ned gave mercy to Cersei, hoping that she would flee for the children. Robert then was gravely injured because of Cersei's plotting and ends up dying before Ned could tell him the truth.  Ned then presents Robert's will to Cersei, after having it witnessed by Ser Barristan, and Cersei refuses to give and ends up getting Ned imprisoned which would result in him being imprisoned and then beheaded.

Re-reading Ned's chapters, protecting children is a strong theme very likely because of Tywin's ""presents"" of the two slaughtered bodies of the Targaryen children to Robert.  Ned protects Jon by taking him in as a bastard child of his, he tries to protect Daenerys by protesting Robert's decision to assassinate her, and he calls for justice when Tywin presented the dead children of Rhaegar Targaryen.

Additionally, there is a theme with Ned trying to give justice but failing.  At the sack of King's Landing, Ned wanted to bring Tywin to justice.  But Robert refused. When Jaime slaughtered Ned's men, Ned wanted to bring justice to Jaime.  But Robert refused.  When Ser Gregor burned, raped, and slaughtered in Wendish Town and Mummer's Ford, Ned Stark sent Ser Beric Dondarrion to bring justice to him by sentencing him to die.  Yet again, justice has yet been brought.  And lastly, when Ned Stark found out about the truth of Cersei, Jaime, and their children, he confronts Cersei and tells her she needs to leave before Robert's wrath kills them:

&gt;___

&gt;How long he waited in the quiet of the godswood, he could not say. It was peaceful here. The thick walls shut out the clamor of the castle, and he could hear birds singing, the murmur of crickets, leaves rustling in a gentle wind. The heart tree was an oak, brown and faceless, yet Ned Stark still felt the presence of his gods. His leg did not seem to hurt so much.

&gt;She came to him at sunset, as the clouds reddened above the walls and towers. She came alone, as he had bid her.

&gt;Why here? Cersei Lannister asked as she stood over him.

&gt;**So the gods can see**.

&gt; - Eddard XII AGoT

&gt;____

Robert is gravely injured, dies, and Ned brings Robert's will to Cersei which she promptly shreds to bits.  Ned tries to bring justice to Cersei and Joffrey, but is betrayed, imprisoned, and later beheaded.

Ned has plenty of parallels with the Father in the Faith of the Seven, whom has a beard on a long and stern face and is prayed for for judgement, justice, and when to recognize it.  But, I believe the show provides the description that fits the theme: the Father's Divine Justice.  Arya, one of the two people who has experienced Ned Stark's beheading as well as the Red Wedding, is going to deliver the justice Ned tried to bring Cersei. Except it is not going to be a vengeful Arya, but one who gives the Gift of Mercy. But how? The valonqar prophecy states that it is the *little brother* that will kill Cersei.  Tyrion knows of Maegor Targaryen's tunnels in the Red Keep and Arya knows the ways of the faceless men.  Jaime will inevitably die, by justice or by battle:

&gt;___

&gt;That night Tyrion Lannister dreamed of a battle that turned the hills of Westeros as red as blood. He was in the midst of it, dealing death with an axe as big as he was, fighting side by side with Barristan the Bold and Bittersteel as dragons wheeled across the sky above them. In the dream he had two heads, both noseless. His father led the enemy, so he slew him once again. Then he killed his brother, Jaime, **hacking at his face until it was a red ruin**, laughing every time he struck a blow. Only when the fight was finished did he realize that his second head was weeping.

&gt; - Tyrion II ADwD

&gt;_____

The Lannister dreams are very important, there are four:

&gt; Jaime VI ASoS

&gt;Cersei I AFfC

&gt;Jaime VI AFfC 

&gt;Tyrion II ADwD

Jaime's second dream reveals how their father never liked being laughed at. Tywin made sure to put an end to the mockery of House Lannister that his father, Tytos set themselves up to.  Tywin did not want the family to be laughed at, and in Jaime's dream Joanna Lannister made it clear *twice* that people laughing at the family was something he hated.  Which is why you see the laughing head in Tyrion's dream. Him laughing at his father's wishes, and the face that is crying that is probably the more literal aspect of Tyrion's emotions of his brother dying.

One will have to take my word for it, else he or she will have to sift through numerous quotes in asearchoficeandfire, when I say that there is a strong connection with Arya, rats, and mice.  (Note: Lannister Lion = cat. Thus the old cat and rat literary trope). The mice bit is usually Arya calling herself that, while others have called her a rat on *numerous* occasions. 

In Cersei's dream:

&gt;_____

&gt;She dreamt she sat the Iron Throne, high above them all.

&gt;**The courtiers were brightly colored mice below**. Great lords and proud ladies knelt before her. Bold young knights laid their swords at her feet and pleaded for her favors, and the queen smiled down at them. Until the dwarf appeared as if from nowhere, pointing at her and howling with laughter. The lords and ladies began to chuckle too, hiding their smiles behind their hands. Only then did the queen realize she was naked.

&gt;Horrified, she tried to cover herself with her hands. The barbs and blades of the Iron Throne bit into her flesh as she crouched to hide her shame. Blood ran red down her legs, as steel teeth gnawed at her buttocks. When she tried to stand, her foot slipped through a gap in the twisted metal. The more she struggled the more the throne engulfed her, tearing chunks of flesh from her breasts and belly, slicing at her arms and legs until they were slick and red, glistening.
And all the while her brother capered below, laughing.

&gt; - Cersei I AFfC

&gt;____

She then wakes up and finds out about Maegor's tunnels:

&gt;____

&gt;Her twin's face had a haggard look. ""The shaft goes down to a chamber where half a dozen tunnels meet. They're closed off by iron gates, chained and locked. I need to find keys."" He glanced around the bedchamber. ""Whoever did this might still be lurking in the walls. It's a maze back there, and dark.""

&gt;**She imagined Tyrion creeping between the walls like some monstrous rat**. No. You are being silly. The dwarf is in his cell. ""Take hammers to the walls. Knock this tower down, if you must. I want them found. Whoever did this. I want them killed.""

&gt; - Cersei I AFfC

&gt;____

But this still does not fulfill the valonqar prophecy.

##Arya as Ned's Gift of Mercy

_____

###The Gift of Mercy

_____

&gt;Men of a hundred different nations labored in the mines, and each prayed to his own god in his own tongue, yet all were praying for the same thing. It was release they asked for, an end to pain. A small thing, and simple. Yet their gods made no answer, and their suffering went on. Are their gods all deaf? he wondered . . . until a realization came upon him, one night in the red darkness.

&gt;All gods have their instruments, men and women who serve them and help to work their will on earth. The slaves were not crying out to a hundred different gods, as it seemed, but to one god with a hundred different faces . . . and he was that god's instrument. That very night he chose the most wretched of the slaves, the one who had prayed most earnestly for release, and freed him from his bondage. The first gift had been given.""

&gt; - Arya II AFfC

&gt;___

&gt;And she had prayed. Oh, how she had prayed. Prayer was what they wanted, so she served it to them, served it on her knees as if she were some common trollop of the streets and not a daughter of the Rock. She had prayed for relief, for deliverance, **for Jaime**. 

&gt; - Cersei I ADwD

&gt;____

&gt;His shoulder was swollen grotesquely, and pus and blood had stained his whole left side. There was a stink to him too. He smells like a corpse. The man begged them for a drink of wine. ""If I'd had any wine, I'd have drunk it myself,"" the Hound told him. ""I can give you water, and the gift of mercy.""

&gt;The archer looked at him a long while before he said, ""You're Joffrey's dog.""

&gt;""My own dog now. Do you want the water?""

&gt;""Aye."" The man swallowed. ""And the mercy. Please.""

&gt;....The Hound eased his dagger into the man's chest almost tenderly, the weight of his body driving the point through his surcoat, ringmail, and the quilting beneath. As he slid the blade back out and wiped it on the dead man, he looked at Arya. ""**That's where the heart is, girl. That's how you kill a man.**""

&gt; - Arya XII ASoS

&gt;____

The gift of mercy is when one drives a sword through another's heart.  Maester Lewin received it and it has been referenced a few more times.

_____

##Lightbringer

____

As weird and far-fetched as this seems so far, yes Lightbringer comes into play.  Ned Stark's Ice is going to become Lightbringer.  After Ned's beheading (as in, the very next chapter), the comet appears and its importance later emphasized in ACoK. George RR Martin could not have screamed that Ice is going to become Lightbringer any louder:

&gt;That night she lay upon her thin blanket on the hard ground, staring up at the great red comet. The comet was splendid and scary all at once. ""**The Red Sword**,"" the Bull named it; he claimed it looked like a sword, the blade still red-hot from the forge. **When Arya squinted the right way she could see the sword too, only it wasn't a new sword, it was Ice, her father's greatsword, all ripply Valyrian steel, and the red was Lord Eddard's blood on the blade after Ser Ilyn the King's Justice had cut off his head. Yoren had made her look away when it happened, yet it seemed to her that the comet looked like Ice must have, after.**

&gt; - Arya I ACoK

&gt;_____

I will go further into depth about Lightringer, but only later:

&gt;____

&gt;Darkness lay over the world and a hero, Azor Ahai, was chosen to fight against it. To fight the darkness, Azor Ahai needed to forge a hero's sword. He labored for thirty days and thirty nights until it was done. However, when he went to temper it in water, the sword broke

Ned Stark's Ice is ""broken"" into two swords: Widow's Wail and Oathkeeper.  Brienne has Oathkeeper and Jaime has Widow's Wail.  If Jaime is executed or killed in battle, Arya using his face would mean she would also have Widow's Wail.

&gt;He was not one to give up easily, so he started over. The second time he took fifty days and fifty nights to make the sword, even better than the first. **To temper it this time, he captured a lion and drove the sword into its heart, but once more the steel shattered**. 

Arya is going to give Cersei the gift of mercy.  The reason why the valonqar prophecy says that the valonqar will put his pale hands around her and choke the life from her is because she is going to become a *captured lion*. Syrio Forel taught Arya to capture cats (/u/dixonblues shoutout for the reminder):

&gt;____

&gt;Catching cats was hard. Her hands were covered with half-healed scratches, and both knees were scabbed over where she had scraped them raw in tumbles. At first even the cooks huge fat kitchen cat had been able to elude her, but Syrio had kept her at it day and night. 

&gt;The Red Keep was full of cats

&gt; - Arya III AGoT

&gt;____

Tyrion, Daenerys, and Jon's army will slowly close in on her and Arya will be sent in to prevent further conflict or prevent Cersei from blowing up King's Landing.  And Arya giving Cersei the gift of mercy makes Jon Snow's lesson **MUCH** more significant:

&gt;____

&gt;""First lesson,"" Jon said. ""Stick them with the pointy end.""

&gt; - Jon II AGoT

&gt;____

&gt;Needle was Robb and Bran and Rickon, her mother and her father, even Sansa. Needle was Winterfell's grey walls, **and the laughter of its people**. Needle was the summer snows, Old Nan's stories, the heart tree with its red leaves and scary face, the warm earthy smell of the glass gardens, the sound of the north wind rattling the shutters of her room. Needle was Jon Snow's smile. He used to mess my hair and call me ""little sister,"" she remembered, and suddenly there were tears in her eyes.

&gt;Polliver had stolen the sword from her when the Mountain's men took her captive, but when she and the Hound walked into the inn at the crossroads, there it was. The gods wanted me to have it. Not the Seven, nor Him of Many Faces, **but her father's gods, the old gods of the north**. The Many-Faced God can have the rest, she thought, but he can't have this.

&gt; - Arya II AFfC

&gt;_____


Plus, just to give you a tidbit from my Lightbringer tinfoil, a needle is used for sewing things together and fixing clothing.  Arya's sword is called ""Needle"". Similarly, reforging Widow's Wail and Oathkeeper is fixing a thing that was broken.  It's a wonder why the second paragraph of Arya's very first chapter in AGoT described her hands as that of a blacksmith:

&gt;____

&gt;#Arya

&gt;Arya's stitches were crooked again.

&gt;She frowned down at them with dismay and glanced over to where her sister Sansa sat among the other girls. Sansa's needlework was exquisite. Everyone said so. ""Sansa's work is as pretty as she is,"" Septa Mordane told their lady mother once. ""She has such fine, delicate hands."" When Lady Catelyn had asked about Arya, the septa had sniffed. ""**Arya has the hands of a blacksmith**."" 

&gt; - Arya I AGoT

&gt;___

but I digress.  The real wonder is why Arya calls herself ""Mercy"" in TWoW. Maybe after Cersei loses all her children, goes mad, and is surrounded at King's Landing, Mercy is what she will need.  After all, it was the children which moved Ned to grant Cersei mercy.

&gt;____

&gt;""And when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you.""

&gt; - Cersei VIII AFfC

&gt;____

&gt;""For hands of gold are always cold, **but a woman's hands are warm**""

&gt; - Tyrion IV ASoS

&gt;____

The golden hands song refers to Tyrion visiting Shae at Chataya's.  The ""golden hands"" is the chain of golden linked hands the Hand of the King refers to.  I'd like to think this is one GRRM's cleverness. What if the ""golden hands"" also includes Jaime because he has a golden hand, and the end of the refrain saying ""but a woman's hands a warm"" to say that the valonqar is not the one of Cersei's two little brothers, but a woman?

___

#Part III: Lightbringer: The Sword that brings the Dawn

&gt;___

&gt;""I wish I had a flaming sword."" Arya could think of lots of people she'd like to set on fire.

##The Legend of Lightbringer

_____

&gt;___

&gt;Melisandre was robed all in scarlet satin and blood velvet, her eyes as red as the great ruby that glistened at her throat as if it too were afire. ""In ancient books of Asshai it is written that there will come a day after a long summer when the stars bleed and the cold breath of darkness falls heavy on the world. In this dread hour a warrior shall draw from the fire a burning sword. And that sword shall be Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes, and he who clasps it shall be Azor Ahai come again, and the darkness shall flee before him."" She lifted her voice, so it carried out over the gathered host. ""Azor Ahai, beloved of R'hllor! The Warrior of Light, the Son of Fire! Come forth, your sword awaits you! Come forth and take it into your hand!""

&gt; - Davos I ACoK

&gt;____

It was Arya's chapter in which Ned Stark is beheaded.  At the beginning of the very next chapter:

&gt;___

&gt;For a certainty, Maester Luwin agreed with a deep sigh. The maester was peering through his big Myrish lens tube, **measuring shadows and noting the position of the comet that hung low in the morning sky.**

&gt; - Bran VII AGoT

&gt;___

&gt;That night she lay upon her thin blanket on the hard ground, staring up at the great red comet. The comet was splendid and scary all at once. ""**The Red Sword,"" the Bull named it; he claimed it looked like a sword, the blade still red-hot from the forge. When Arya squinted the right way she could see the sword too, only it wasn't a new sword, it was Ice, her father's greatsword, all ripply Valyrian steel, and the red was Lord Eddard's blood on the blade after Ser Ilyn the King's Justice had cut off his head. Yoren had made her look away when it happened, yet it seemed to her that the comet looked like Ice must have, after**.

&gt; - Arya I ACoK

&gt;____

&gt;""I have attended to it, good ser. Though His Grace frowns so whenever he does see me that I tremble to come before him. Do you think he would like me better if I wore a hair shirt and never smiled? Well, I will not do it. I am an honest man, he must suffer me in silk and samite. Or else I shall take my ships where I am better loved. That sword was not Lightbringer, my friend.""

&gt;The sudden shift in subject left Davos uneasy. ""Sword?""

&gt;""A sword plucked from fire, yes. Men tell me things, it is my pleasant smile. How shall a burnt sword serve Stannis?""

&gt;""A burning sword,"" corrected Davos.

&gt;""Burnt,"" said Salladhor Saan, ""and be glad of that, my friend. Do you know the tale of the forging of Lightbringer? I shall tell it to you. It was a time when darkness lay heavy on the world. To oppose it, the hero must have a hero's blade, oh, like none that had ever been. And so for thirty days and thirty nights Azor Ahai labored sleepless in the temple, forging a blade in the sacred fires. Heat and hammer and fold, heat and hammer and fold, oh, yes, until the sword was done. Yet when he plunged it into water to temper the steel it burst asunder.

&gt;""Being a hero, it was not for him to shrug and go in search of excellent grapes such as these, so again he began. The second time it took him fifty days and fifty nights, and this sword seemed even finer than the first. Azor Ahai captured a lion, to temper the blade by plunging it through the beast's red heart, but once more the steel shattered and split. Great was his woe and great was his sorrow then, for he knew what he must do.

&gt;""A hundred days and a hundred nights he labored on the third blade, and as it glowed white-hot in the sacred fires, he summoned his wife. 'Nissa Nissa,' he said to her, for that was her name, 'bare your breast, and know that I love you best of all that is in this world.' She did this thing, why I cannot say, and Azor Ahai thrust the smoking sword through her living heart. It is said that her cry of anguish and ecstasy left a crack across the face of the moon, but her blood and her soul and her strength and her courage all went into the steel. Such is the tale of the forging of Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes.

&gt;""Now do you see my meaning? Be glad that it is just a burnt sword that His Grace pulled from that fire. Too much light can hurt the eyes, my friend, and fire burns."" Salladhor Saan finished the last grape and smacked his lips. ""When do you think the king will bid us sail, good ser?""

&gt; - Davos I ACoK

&gt;____

Salladhor San doubts Stannis' sword is lightbringer and goes on to tell the Legend of Lightbringer.  Meaning that this is *how* the sword Lightbringer shall be made.  There are three instances of an attempt to make Lightbringer: tempered in water, driven through the heart of a captured lion, and into Nissa Nissa's chest. 

____

##The Making of Lightbringer

____


What I have found is that the prophecy needs *two* read overs for it to fit nicely.  Possibly hinted at by the name of Azor Ahai's lover: ""Nissa, Nissa"".  The first read over points to the sword *which* shall become Lightbringer the second instance tells us *how* Lightbringer shall come about. The first read-through connects with King Joffrey's swords with rubies. First sword, Lion's Tooth, thrown into the Ruby Ford:

&gt;___

&gt;""Mycah and I are going to ride upstream and look for rubies at the ford.""

&gt;""Rubies,"" Sansa said, lost. ""What rubies?""

&gt;Arya gave her a look like she was so stupid. ""Rhaegar's rubies. This is where King Robert killed him and won the crown.""

&gt;...

&gt;That was my ladys sister you were hitting, do you know that? A bright bud of blood blossomed where his sword pressed into Mycahs flesh, and a slow red line trickled down the boys cheek.

&gt;Stop it! Arya screamed. She grabbed up her fallen stick.

&gt;Sansa was afraid. Arya, you stay out of this.

&gt;I wont hurt himmuch, Prince Joffrey told Arya, never taking his eyes off the butchers boy.

&gt;Arya went for him.

&gt;...

&gt;Then a grey blur flashed past her, and suddenly Nymeria was there, leaping, jaws closing around Joffreys sword arm. The steel fell from his fingers as the wolf knocked him off his feet, and they rolled in the grass, the wolf snarling and ripping at him, the prince shrieking in pain. Get it off, he screamed. Get it off!
Aryas voice cracked like a whip. Nymeria!

&gt;The direwolf let go of Joffrey and moved to Aryas side. The prince lay in the grass, whimpering, cradling his mangled arm. His shirt was soaked in blood. Arya said, She didnt hurt youmuch. She picked up Lions Tooth where it had fallen, and stood over him, holding the sword with both hands.

&gt;Joffrey made a scared whimpery sound as he looked up at her. No, he said, dont hurt me. Ill tell my mother.

&gt;You leave him alone! Sansa screamed at her sister.

&gt;Arya whirled and heaved the sword into the air, putting her whole body into the throw. The blue steel flashed in the sun as the sword spun out over the river. It hit the water and vanished with a splash

&gt; - Sansa I AGoT

&gt;___

The second instance, Azor Ahai captured a lion and drove Lightbringer into its heart.  Before the Battle of Blackwater:

&gt;___

&gt;""My uncle's the one who will need mercy, but I won't give him any."" Joffrey drew his sword. The pommel was **a ruby cut in the shape of a heart**, set between a lion's jaws. Three fullers were deeply incised in the blade. ""My new blade, **Hearteater**.""

&gt;He'd owned a sword named Lion's Tooth once, Sansa remembered. Arya had taken it from him and thrown it in a river. I hope Stannis does the same with this one. 

&gt; - Sansa V ACoK

&gt;___

And Tyrion recounts the Battle of Blackwater:

&gt;___

&gt;""I knew Ser Mandon died in the battle."" **Shoved into the river by Pod, half a heartbeat before the treacherous bastard could drive his sword through my heart**. ""Who else was lost?""

&gt; - Tyrion I ASoS

&gt;___

The third instance, King Joffrey gets Widow's Wail, one of two swords derived from Ned Stark's Ice:

&gt;___

&gt;Sansa remembered Lion's Tooth, the sword Arya had flung into the Trident, and Hearteater, the one he'd made her kiss before the battle. She wondered if he'd want Margaery to kiss this one.

&gt;The guests were shouting out names for the new blade. Joff dismissed a dozen before he heard one he liked. ""Widow's Wail!"" he cried. ""Yes! It shall make many a widow, too!"" He slashed again.

&gt; - Sansa IV ASoS

&gt;___

Widow's Wail has rubies in the eyes of the golden lion heads for the cross guard.  The reason why Tywin chose rubies instead of any other gem:

&gt;As he entered his lord father's solar a few moments later, he heard a voice saying, "". . . cherrywood for the scabbards, bound in red leather and ornamented with a row of lion's-head studs in pure gold. Perhaps with garnets for the eyes . . .""

&gt;""Rubies,"" Lord Tywin said. ""**Garnets lack the fire**.""

&gt; - Tyrion IV ASoS

&gt;___

Rubies are gems that luster like fire.  Which is probably why Targaryen kings chose the gem for their crowns, and why followers of Rh'llor, like Melisandre, wear the gem.  The name of the series is *A Song of Ice and Fire* with *A Game of Thrones* being the first book, with Ned Stark's *Ice* on the front.  Perhaps, like /u/SchmedStark suggests, Lightbringer's actual name will be *Fire*.  That way the series name, *A Song of Ice and Fire* is very significant.  Not to mention the description  of the two derivative swordsin Jaime's dream:

&gt;___

&gt;Stay with me, Jaime pleaded. Dont leave me here alone. But they were leaving.Dont leave me in the dark! Something terrible lived down here. Give me a sword, at least.

&gt;I gave you a sword, Lord Tywin said.

&gt;It was at his feet. Jaime groped under the water until his hand closed upon the hilt. Nothing can hurt me so long as I have a sword. **As he raised the sword a finger of pale flame flickered at the point and crept up along the edge, stopping a hands breath from the hilt. The fire took on the color of the steel itself so it burned with a silvery-blue light, and the gloom pulled back**...

&gt;From behind came a great splash. Jaime whirled toward the sound... but the faint light revealed only Brienne of Tarth, her hands bound in heavy chains. I swore to keep you safe, the wench said stubbornly. I swore an oath. Naked, she raised her hands to Jaime. Ser. Please. If you would be so good.

&gt;The steel links parted like silk. A sword, Brienne begged, and there it was, scabbard, belt, and all. She buckled it around her thick waist. The light was so dim that Jaime could scarcely see her, though they stood a scant few feet apart. In this light she could almost be a beauty, he thought. **In this light she could almost be a knight. Briennes sword took flame as well, burning silvery blue.** The darkness retreated a little more.

&gt; - Jaime VI ASoS

&gt;____

Now, for the second read through of the Legend of Lightbringer, tells us how Lightbringer will be made.  First instance, tempered in water, is Ned Stark's Ice being broken into two.  The second instance, Arya will give Cersei the gift of mercy as Jaime with Widow's Wail, Oathkeeper (I'd say Widow's Wail because it is appropriate given Cersei is a widow), Needle, or even the catspaw dagger, if the show the fate of the dagger is to be believed by the show. The third instance, Nissa Nissa.  I will get to the third part later, but Gendry is going to reforge Ned Stark's Ice into Fire/Lightbringer.. Why? Tohbo Mott, Gendry's master, was the one who reworked Ned's Ice into Widow's Wail and Oathkeeper.

&gt;___

&gt;Q:Did Tohbo Mott ever teach Gendry the secrets of reworking Valyrian steel?

&gt;A:Interesting question.

&gt; - So Spake Martin, The Citadel

&gt;___

And plus Gendry was the one who described the comet as ""Red Sword"" when Arya thought it looked like Ice after Ned's beheading.

Catelyn also describes the Smith in the Faith of the Seven as one:

&gt;____

&gt;..**who fixed things that were broken**...

&gt; Catelyn IV ACoK

&gt;____

Ned Stark's Ice is something that is broken. Which is why, I believe, ""Needle"" is significant. Jon and Arya decided on the name because Arya did not like Needle work.  It was even said of Arya's hands:

&gt;_____

&gt;#Arya

&gt;Arya's stitches were crooked again.

&gt;She frowned down at them with dismay and glanced over to where her sister Sansa sat among the other girls. Sansa's needlework was exquisite. Everyone said so. ""Sansa's work is as pretty as she is,"" Septa Mordane told their lady mother once. ""She has such fine, delicate hands."" When Lady Catelyn had asked about Arya, the septa had sniffed. ""**Arya has the hands of a blacksmith**.""

&gt; - Arya I AGoT

&gt;____

Needle is something that mends things together, much like Oathkeeper and Widow's Wail is something that needs to be brought together.

This post talks only about the show.

So, when Ned ""reveals"" the ""truth"" in Season 1 he starts to name previous Baratheons describing them as black haired and blue eyed, which isn't as specific as ASOIAF's version where he describes all Baratheon-Lannister children, where the reader gets to see that all stag and lion children always have these traits. The purpose of this scene in GOT was to say that all Baratheons are black haired and blue eyed, and thus, Joffrey, Tommen and Myrcella aren't Baratheons but Lannister bastards. But when we take a glance at Renly, and later, Stannis and Shireen this statement doesn't add up:

Stannis has the black hair but brown eyes, Shireen has blonde hair and blue eyes and Renly has hair and eyes both brown.

Since the Baratheon trait isn't that strong the possibilites of them looking like that are high enough.

Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen have blue eyes and not green like a Lannister would. If their father, mother, granmother and grandfather had green eyes and golden hair they would have the green eyes too, but they have it blue, like Robert had...

Some people would see Cersei's dialogue with Jaime and Eddard as evidence to them being incest bastards, but how can we take her word for truth? She drinks way more than Robert ever could have and she always tries to look away from the truth when it doesn't favor her, does she know they're Jaime's or does she just believe it to hide from the ""cruel"" truth?",4,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Most of the main scenarios are in the World Wars (A good example might be Fall Weiss or Brusilov Offensive, things for two-four players to play through in an evening or two).

My beta-testers are all huge ASOIAF/GOT fans, keeping up with the wikis and such, so I thought they might have more fun testing Westeros scenarios instead of World Wars. Only thing is, I really have no idea what I could make for them that would fit the bill. Something like Aegon's Conquest is probably too big for what I'm intending, but something like the Faith Militant Uprising seems a bit too small? Although if someone has any ideas for making both of those work, I'm all ears.

I only have one GoT scenario so far, but you could probably use it as an example of what I'm thinking of. With 2-5 players, it's Robb Stark's campaign against Tywin, Robb winning by capturing Casterly Rock but is fighting against a slowly dissolving army and Tywin wins by capturing Robb. So here we have one player as the Stark's side and the other as the Lannisters, but can be added to have one as the Tullys and the other as Joffery (If there's only two players, Tywin controls the Crownlands and Robb controls the Riverlands) with a player optionally playing as Renly or Stannis with extra rules if they want to do that. That's it summed up really quickly, but should give you an idea of what a scenario might look like, although this one is just a bit bigger than normal.",12,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Over the last couple seasons (not sure how much time has passed), he's grown as far as honor.

The fourth was okay, I suppose, and the fifth was better. For years, I intentionally ignored the TV show and avoided most of the spoilers, but a while back I decided to take the plunge and give it a shot, especially because it might now be the only way to ever get some kind of resolution to the story.

The TV show is, of course, very good. I'm now about halfway through season 6. I was excited but also apprehensive, since it's the first time the story will really be going beyond the books, and so far I'm actually rather unimpressed.

It's like the writers have taken leave of their senses. The explanation for the whitewalkers is both completely unimaginative and totally pointless. Everytime the Sand Snakes are on the screen, I feel like I'm watching an episode of *Hercules: The Legendary Journeys* with Kevin Sorbo. Don't get me wrong, I like that kind of pulp trash, but I didn't want it in my *Game of Thrones*. Each episode, it just becomes more like a Saturday morning kids cartoon. At this rate, I expect by the final season Daenarys, Jon, and Tyrion will all place their magic stones together to become Mecha-dragon to fight a giant whitewalker and show us all the power of teamwork.

One of the great things about the books is that they don't give into that temptation to wrap up every narrative thread with a pretty ribbon on top. Increasingly, however, the TV show isn't passing up any opportunity for some kind of melodramatic reckoning between characters, and every battle is beginning to feel like a videogame where the hero fights through all the disposable henchmen before a boss battle, replete with cheesy one liners and ironic deaths.

I mean, some of this is expected, but it's being layered on thick and fast now--way more than before.

I'm still enjoying it, and I'll continue to watch it, but is it all like this from here on? Should I be adjusting my expectations?",22,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

I THINK Dany and Doreah's discussion from S1E2 was a form of foreshadowing. In S1E2, Doreah tells Dany one of the legend of the dragons which is found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9_h0egj9YY

In short: There were two moons in the sky, one wondered too close to sun and it hatched due to the heat and out of it pored thousands of dragons (essentially the moon was a dragon egg) and they drank the suns fire. The other reply by saying that the ""Moon is no egg, it is a goddess and wife of the sun.""

I think this is foreshadowing because in the show Dany calls Drogo her ""Sun and Stars"" and Drogo refers to Dany as ""Moon of my Life."" Dany is the moon that hatched the dragons due under Drogo's heat (she hatched him with the fire used at his funeral.)

The theory goes is that Arya will kill Tyrion before she heads more west (or Rejoins the FM). Now the reasoning for this is that she has not seen Tyrion's good deeds she only saw what was represented at the stage play in Braavos. So she will not be please with Tyrion at WF (well she will have problems with some of the people there ins general), So she will kill Tyrion and every last piece of the Arya we knew in S3 will be officially gone and it will be Bitter that way but sweet because she will be sailing more west.

I don't think this will happen in that way mainly because I think Tyrion will live to the end first of all (but his tongue I think will be cut out), and also I think Sansa would clear up that the play was BS. However if Arya is still skeptical (for some reason) and something like this still happens then maybe I can see her trying too perhaps during a meeting on the strategy to defeat the WW's but the wine glass that was suppose to go to Tyrion instead goes to Sansa, Sansa then ends up accidentally getting poisoned and she dies. Arya realizing she let her vengeance get the better of her this time and she will either go into self-imposed exile or Varys and Tyrion will find out via Varys skills as a ""Spider"" and Tyrion will demand Jon banish her (Remember Tyrion actually cares about Sansa) and Jon will reluctantly banish her with Arya not being able to live in WF after what she did.

But she will sail more west or marry Gendry and be lady of Stormlands which would be the Sweet part of the Bittersweet ending. Now I don't think it will go down like that either sense I still don't think Arya would try too kill Tyrion but maybe like it could happen like maybe Jaqen actually does too frame Arya so she can get her to rejoin the FM or something.",7,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

I believe the TV show will end with Daenerys voluntarily sacrificing herself to become the Night Queen.  She is the princess who was promised, to the Night King, in the original pact between the First Men and the Others.  By becoming the Night Queen, Dany will fulfill her destiny of being the savior of Westeros, honoring the pact and bringing an end to the White Walker invasion.  

In addition, I also think that Jon will have to ""create"" Dany as the NQ her by inserting the catspaw dagger, currently held by Arya, into her heart.  It is this dagger specifically that can be used to create the Night Queen, because it is made from the same piece of dragonglass that the COFT used to create the original Night King, as seen in ""The Door"" episode via Bran's vision.  This is why this dagger is so special and was featured prominently in an ancient text read by Sam and Gilly at the Citadel (in the Season 7 premiere, ""Dragonstone"").  Jon's creation of Dany as NQ will mirror the AA legends regarding Nissa Nissa.  It is a very tidy ending. 

I have seen theories online that get at parts of this potential ending, but I think they are missing some key evidence.  For example, we see the White Walkers begin their march southward at the end of season 2, paralleling the end of season 1 which is when Dany becomes the mother of dragons. Dany unlocks her magic with the birth of the dragons, and her arrival signals to the NK that his bride has finally arrived. More importantly, though, are the events in S7E4, The Spoils of War.  I think this title is a hint, and refers not only at the wars directly shown and alluded to in the episode, but also to the great war between the First Men and the Others.  The spoils of that great war included the pact requiring the delivery of a human queen to the Others (the princess who was promised).  Not just any queen, but a magic queen - the first and only human who would someday give life to dragons.  

In The Spoils of War, the evidence for this theory was strengthened to a point where I now consider it more likely than not.  The cave drawings under Dragonstone are shown, depicting the truce between the First Men, COFT, and the Others.  Why is this at dragonstone?  Because this is the place where the pact was made, and where the princess who was promised would eventually be born.  

At the 23:28 mark of The Spoils of War, we are quickly shown a distinct image of a pair of thrones carves into the wall.  One is occupied, and one is empty.  Above the thrones is the sigil of the Others.  I believe the empty throne is waiting for Dany.  I have submitted this link separately as ""Dany NQ Cave Drawing"". 

So in short, 

- Dany is the princess who was promised, to the Night King

- The pact is clearly documented beneath Dragonstone, which is Dany's birthplace

- To fulfill the pact and end the war, Dany will have to become the NQ

- Dany will sacrifice herself to be the savior of Westeros, and Jon will be the one create her 

I have other ideas for the ending beyond those, such as what happens to Westeros going forward (namely, democracy and president Tyrion) and what the implications are for Jon's role in the story, but am far less confident in those ideas.  I am really confident in D=NQ.         ",43,18,False,spoiler,,,,,

You see, my dad is watching Game of Thrones and so far he has almost ended the 2nd season, however, things are starting to get complicated for him, such as where exactly in the world characters are or what certain things means, such as events from the past or which characters belong to certain houses.

For instance, he was certainly surprised when I explained to him the House Mormont situation, that Jeor and Jorah are actually parent and son and that they are in differents parts of the world because Jorah's slave trader background got him exiled after Jeor abdicated his titles to him and joined the Night's Watch. He did, however, connected the dots when I told him this, because he did know that Jeor had a son that got exiled, as he remembers Jeor metioning this to Jon the moment he gave him Longclaw. Then I showed him a Westeros Map, which surprised him even more when I told him where Jorah (and Daenerys) was and where Jeor is at the moment.

However, the maps I found are pretty low quality and you cant really read the legends on it, so I was wondering if any of you got quality maps, maybe one with both big and small houses on it? Or any other resource that makes it easier to understand the series, such as a family tree (I actually believe this is better) Thanks!

I literally can't watch the show again 1 episode at a time, only all at once. Here are my thoughts on how to get the full experience out of the show:

1) Watch at least 18 episodes a day (Depends how many interruptions you get per day). Things need to be moving. 18 episodes in the realm will be more eventful than whatever else you planned to do that day.

2) This is related to #1. sleep about 6 hours a night. Watching absurd amounts of TV makes you more tired than you think. Especially if you do it for several days. If you watch at least 18 episodes per day and get only 6 hours of sleep per night, you will catch up in less than 4 days (Only 4 days!!!). 

3) Eat cheese and drink wine. Stopping to cook food is a liability. You'll do pretty well for yourself just eating cheese so don't worry about your bladder. Of course you wine too for nostalgia purposes.

4) Invite friends to come over and watch the occasional episode. It's more fun with friends, but I'm sure not all your friends are as hardcore as you. They might also bring snacks besides cheese so you can balance your diet.

5) Cry. A lot. I binge the show twice a year to get all of my TV watching desires out of me before a new semester at college. I associate a lot of good feels with this show and usually end up crying.

6) Post on the Game of Thrones subreddit about how you watched all the seasons (1-7) in under 4 days time because you are strangely proud of this achievement. ",19,40,False,spoiler,,,,,

Jorah mentions that when he first saw the Dothraki he'd say that well armoured knights would beat them quite easily, but after spending some time with them he isn't so sure. 

We've seen them fight against the Lannisters in S7E4, but those weren't knights - just normal soldiers, not battled hardened veterans (and of course the scare-effect is huge when facing them).
 
I'm still thinking Dothraki since they'd probably go for the horse rather than the heavy-armoured knight, but I have an open mind.

He has to know Tyrion is good at it, because he named him Hand of the King for a reason. Once Tyrion asked to be made heir, Tywin also said he'd find a 'suitable position for his talents'. So he also recognizes he *has* talents.

To sum it up: Tywin claims to care about the family name, but would rather have the family lose Casterly Rock through marriage than to appoint his clearly more competent son who might bring a couple of hookers.",15,6,False,spoiler,,,,,

* Show is now like books, HBO dicking around with its delay

* Don't care for the show, S8 will suck just as much as S7

* Storyline is rushed

* Fcuk the show, S5-7 literally cancer

Why is that place so toxic? I'd expect them to be somewhat happy that we all get a closure. GRRM gave up on them years ago, and D&amp;D trying their best to give some closure.

Everywhere the lord of light worshippers goes there is always chaos. Just look at King Stannis, who worshipped the god for many years and what did he gain in return? Absolute destruction of his army and family. Stannis first lost a brother and his army to the lord of light for misleading him. Then it started an all out war in Westeros, Stannis lost a lot of men in Kings Landing to fire and what is lord of light? Right a fire god. Later on Stannis, kept losing, lost half his army for sacrificing his daughter and was then ultimately defeated in Winterfell to Ramsey Bolton. Only for him to be killed by the witness of Renly murder.
Now where do this leave Olly? There is a lot of similarities to where Olly went. He first got his own village killed, because he is the lord of light. Then he went to the Night's watch and soon after they took him in. He started causing chaos by misleading people into thinking Jon Snow was a bad person. Later on he started a war with the freefolk and killed Ygritte, the love of Jon Snow's life. He soon took Jon Snow life by betraing him with other members of the Night's watch, to take control, again chaos has happened because of Olly. This path lead down into more chaos where Jon Snow was revived, thanks to the lord of light and was forced to hang the traitors. Now Jon Snow took a chaotic path too by leading a army against Ramsey Bolton the true warden of Winterfell. Jon Snow was now the main reason thousands of soldiers was killed in the Battle of the bastards and soon Jon Snow started 2 all out wars in Westeros. One by claiming him to be the King in the North which leads to huge battles where many soldiers were killed in battle against the rightful air to the Iron Throne Cersie Lannister. The second all out war is against the Night King which is only here to bring people back together in a peaceful way, but Jon Snow is too desperat to sabotage the Night King plan and Jon Snow only did this because he wanted more power and become the King of westeros.

When Jon Snow died and was resurrected by the lord of light, it was then Jon Snow became a servant of the lord of light. Just look at all the destruction he has caused and misleading people. Just like what the lord of light servant did to Stannis and what Olly did too Jon Snow. 
My conclusion is Olly must the reincarnation of the lord of light, because he never studied the practicing of becoming a lord of the light priest. So the only way for Olly to cause this much destruction was to either have died, which he did not or being the reincarnation of the chaos god. Only after his purpose was completed he died.

So are there anything else that could prove this theory correct?",7,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Either a) the bodies froze quickly and were preserved by the cold, or b) they had already been turned into wights by a White Walker, which magically stops their decomposition. 

If A is true, how did they later become wights and attack Jon? If B is true, were the wights playing dead? Is that something they can do? 

Jafer Flowers has dark eyes, not blue ones, so I'm inclined to think option A occurred and they were somehow raised later, but that doesn't make sense as it would mean there was a WW south of the wall. We never see a delayed raising of the dead in the rest of the series, or a WW raising someone from far away, so I wasn't sure what exactly happened in this episode, and some clarification would be appreciated.

Robert conquered that kingdom and he died while king, so it goes to his sons. 2 died now its time for Gendry to take his rightful place as king, and Bran should have known this, or maybe hes just lying.

500,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-1-6,2018,1,6,18,7oiddn,self.gameofthrones,[EVERYTHING] How possible is it that Tywin purposefully orchestrated the Defiance of Duskendale to either displace Aerys or drive him further into madness?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/7oiddn/everything_how_possible_is_it_that_tywin/,sonnytron,1515231492,"According to the books, Tywin discouraged Aerys from going to Duskendale, which you would think dismisses him from blame.  
However, also according to the books, up until this point, Aerys and Tywin's relationship had gone really sour and Aerys was deliberately doing the opposite of everything Tywin counseled to him as Hand of the King. I find it hard to believe that one of the Realm's most successful and tactical military leaders had absolutely *no* idea Aerys would disobey his advice and go to Duskendale.  
If anything, isn't it possible Tywin told him ""explicitly"" not to go, precisely so that he would?  
Of course, Tywin cannot predict what would happen and that Aerys would be captured, but he was firm in not negotiating with Lord Denys. In fact, the books explicitly state that Aerys' paranoia was a result of Tywin not negotiating to save him. It can even be argued that Tywin felt that Aerys would in fact be killed by Denys and was not negotiating with them specifically to encourage it from happening.  
The next question is, why? Well, at the tournament to honor Viserys' birth, Tywin asked Aerys to marry Cersei to Rhaegar and unify their houses. Aerys rejected, calling Tywin a servant to the king, and again, the books state that it was an insult that Tywin would never forgive. This literally was the last thing to happen before the conflict with Duskendale started.  
Once he realized that Aerys as king would cause irreparable damage to his house (something he literally all but killed his own father to restore), he knew he needed to displace Aerys as soon as possible.  
It's widely accepted that Rhaegar attended the Tournament in order to speak to other Lords about replacing his father. I think that by this point, Tywin wanted plausible deniability, so when Aerys finally insulted him a last time by naming Jaime to his Kingsguard, he resigned from his post. By then everything had been set in motion and Aerys was spiraling out of control.  
And what was the result of this madness? Tywin's daughter marrying Robert Baratheon and becoming Queen.  
Oh and, a lot of people say that Aerys was mad even before the Defiance, because Barristan Selmy specifically says so, however it's important that we consider that the Defiance of Duskendale made him much much worse. He was crazy before, but most believed Tywin and Rhaegar could keep him together at least until Rhaegar came into power. But I think Tywin stopped believing this when Aerys started making plans for Tywin's children which would affect the future of his house. What difference does it make if Rhaegar takes over after Jaime is sworn to the kingsguard and Rhaegar is married to someone else?  ",1,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

But maybe they had faith in their King in the North, so ok. What about Lord Royce? Being from the Vale, and judging by his behaviour, I believe he would believe in and follow a trueborn Stark instead. And the North would believe these stories better.

Anyway, what about Littlefinger? This is a man who only concerns himself with manipulating the living, and turning them against one another, so that he could accumulate human power, and all that. How did he believe Jon Snow so easily? Shouldn't he be secretly thinking that Jon Snow is trying to manipulate the Lords into following him out of a fear of an unknown enemy that doesn't really exist? 

With Daenerys and her dragons, we see that he at least truly believes that, and was concerned with Tyrion being her Hand, and was considering how to tackle her. If he honestly did believe in White Walkers, how was it that he was still concerned with human politics? Shouldn't he AT LEAST, think of a way to ensure just HIS own survival? We of course wouldn't expect him to look out for others.

Maybe he knows they exist, but doesn't think that they're a big threat? ",11,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

What did Rhaegar Targaryen gain in return? Safety beyond the wall where he could start a new family, after gaining knowledge about what happened to his family. Of course he was furious and wanted revenge? What was the best way to get that revenge? Support the White walkers with sons. Jeor Mormont suggested that Rhaegar Targaryen should change his name, because even among the Night's watch his safety was not guarenteed. When they visited his cabin for info. Jeor Mormont and Craster shares a mutual friendship. So How could Rhaegar Targaryen have escaped from the rebellion? He found one who looked like him and paid him a fortune to be him. So the fake one died at the battle of the Trident, while the real one fleeing north, the fake one thought he would be rich and a king now but his poor battle strategy lead him through his downfall, now Rhaegar Targaryen safety was almost secured. Craster is a bitter cruel angry old man, no wonder after what happened to his family. He only have respect for Jeor Mormont and dont trust anyone except Jeor Mormont. Rhaegar Targaryen may have had visions about the white walkers and the the 3 headed dragon who will save the world with fire. He already had a son and daughter but was about to get another one so the prophecy could come true, since what happen he no longer believes in the prophecy about the 3 headed dragon. What do Craster have now? Lots of children, the family Rhaegar Targaryen wanted for so long. What do the Targaryens and Craster have in common? They have several inbreeding children and dont think it's wrong. Who is at the Castle black? Aemon Targaryen which died some episodes ago. What do Craster thinks about himself? He thinks he's a god while Daenerys followers think she is a god. So this prove that at least some Targaryen have escaped, so maybe Rhaegar travel with him to Castle Black and made the deal with the Night's Watch to protect him from the several lords and kings who wanted him dead. So know that the Night King is gonna ride a dragon, this lead me further to believe that the Night King and Rhaegar Targaryen have the same blood line, because Craster gave all his sons to the Night King and the Night King most have Dragon blood in his veins. What did Karl Tanner do to Craster? He killed him and John Snow got revenge on him later on. That must have been a hint that Craster is Rhaegar Targaryen. I think i have made several proof that Rhaegar Targaryen could indeed be Craster, but who cares now his dead. What does this mean for the future? Little Sam could be the prince who was promised and become the new Night King to balance ice and fire.",8,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

On the one hand, I admire her for what a strong-willed she-wolf she is, who ultimately followed her heart and put herself first, when eloping with Rhaegar, especially in a world that is difficult enough for women as it is. 
   Though, I cant help but feeling that surely, as an honourable Stark woman, she should of known of the consequences of her actions? A betrothal, after all, is a very serious thing. Their secret ultimately started a war, and killed Rhaegar, as well as her own father and brother and Rhaegars family, including Rhaegars innocent children and Elia. If she had survived the birth, surely she wouldve never been able to live with herself.
Then again, if they had restrained how they were feeling and she had married Robert and Rhaegar stayed with Elia, neither one of them probably wouldve been happy. (And no Jon!)
I feel conflicted about my annoyance of her and what happened. There are parts of her I like and parts that annoy the hell out of me.

If anything, he is usually the one being saved or bailed out of a situation. It has required a heavy reliance on others to get him to where he is now in the show. Let's look at his resume.

1. Karl Tanner beat him. He was saved by one of Crastor's wives last minute. 
2. The countless times Ygritte saved him from being fucked up by the wildlings while he was undercover.
3. That time he died and the red woman bailed him out of death. 
4. BotB one - when Ramsay's cavalry almost wrecked him and his cavalry came in last minute.
5. BotB two - when Sansa and the Knights of the Vale rode in to win the battle. 
6. When north of the wall Dany flies in on her dragons last minute.
7. When he falls through the ice and Benjen Stark saves him. 

From the top of my head, his best credits are Hardhome and saving Mormont from the wight earlier in the show in terms of saving others. You could argue he saved Mance from a worse death than was coming to him I guess. 
I just can't help but think the only really awesome thing he did was kill the white walker at Hardhome. Even his 1v1 with Ramsay was tainted with his entire army watching on, ready to fill Ramsay full of arrows. Just seems to me like his best traits as a character are without heroism. He seems more like the guy we admire for his honor and bringing the best out of others (Sam, Pip, Grenn, Tormund, etc).

What do you guys think? Am I completely full of shit? ",19,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Pitt bid six figures to watch a Game of Thrones episode with Clarke on Saturday night during a silent auction at Sean Penns annual gala for Haiti, held at Milk Studios in Los Angeles, California.

During the charity gala, the auctioneer announced the opportunity to watch an episode with Clarke, who was in attendance at the A-list event, along with her Game of Thrones co-star Kit Harington, though the cast members were seated at separate tables.

The auction to watch the episode with Clarke started at $20,000, but the race quickly escalated. At one point, the auctioneer yelled out Is the King of the North here?! But as it turned out, Harington had stepped out of the gala to go to the restroom.

Meanwhile, Pitt bid $80,000 to watch an episode of GOT with Clarke. Then he outbid himself to $90,000. When Harington came back into the room, the actor offered to also sit in on the episode viewing. And thats when Pitt raised his own bid to $120,000.

In the end, Pitt was outbid by a gala-goer who ended the auction at $160,000.

But they are all wrong.  Ned Stark's Ice is going to become Lightbringer.  Ice is going to become Fire.  Which is why you see Ice on the front cover of the first book of *A Song of* **Ice** *and Fire*.  Ice is going to become reforged into Lightbringer, making *A Song of Ice and Fire* title much more significant.

#GRRM's inspiration

___

&gt;I revere Lord of the Rings, I reread it every few years, it had an enormous effect on me as a kid. In some sense, when I started this saga I was replying to Tolkien, but even more to his modern imitators.

GRRM's biggest inspiration/influence of ASoIaF/GoT is no doubt is Lord of the Rings.  GRRM even stated that he was aiming for a similar bittersweet ending like LotR.  Ned Stark's Ice becoming reforged into Fire reflects Narsil being reforged into Andril:

&gt;""Very bright was that sword when it was made whole again; the light of the sun shone redly in it, and the light of the moon shone cold, and its edge was hard and keen. And Aragorn gave it a new name and called it Andril, Flame of the West.""

______

#The Legend of Lightbringer

_____

The Legend of Lightbringer requires two read-overs, likely implied by the lover's name ""Nissa Nissa"", in order to understand it.  The first read-through points to which sword is lightbringer (the rubies, gems that have fire to them, point the way), the second read through tells us *how* Lightbringer is going to be made.

First time Lightbringer is tempered in water, and Joffrey's first sword was thrown into the Ruby Ford by Arya.

Second time it was tempered in a lion's heart, Joffrey's second sword is hearteater and it had a heart-shaped ruby inside the lion's jaws. He commanded Ser Mandon Moore to kill Tyrion.

&gt;""I knew Ser Mandon died in the battle."" Shoved into the river by Pod, half a heartbeat before the treacherous bastard could drive his sword through my heart. ""Who else was lost?""

&gt; - Tyrion I ASoS

Joffrey's third sword is Widow's Wail, which parallels with the lover Nissa Nissa crying out in ecstasy and it cracking the moon.  It had rubies in the eyes of the lion. First Nissa in Nissa Nissa is Catelyn Stark.

This is the first read over and it tells us which sword is Lightbringer, the second readover tells us *how* it will become Lightbringer.

First time it was tempered in water and broke - Ned Stark's Ice was broken into two.

Second time it was tempered it was in a captured lion's heart, Arya is going to give Cersei the gift of mercy as Jaime (since Jaime has Widow's Wail).  The gift of mercy was taught to Arya by the hound.

&gt;One day, in an earthen hollow made by the roots of a fallen oak, they came face to face with another survivor of the Twins. The badge on his breast showed a pink maiden dancing in a swirl of silk, and he told them he was Ser Marq Piper's man; a bowman, though he'd lost his bow. His left shoulder was all twisted and swollen where it met his arm; a blow from a mace, he said, it had broken his shoulder and smashed his chainmail deep into his flesh. ""A northman, it was,"" he wept. ""His badge was a bloody man, and he saw mine and made a jape, red man and pink maiden, maybe they should get together. I drank to his Lord Bolton, he drank to Ser Marq, and we drank together to Lord Edmure and Lady Roslin and the King in the North. And then he killed me."" His eyes were fever bright when he said that, and Arya could tell that it was true. His shoulder was swollen grotesquely, and pus and blood had stained his whole left side. There was a stink to him too. He smells like a corpse. The man begged them for a drink of wine.

&gt;""If I'd had any wine, I'd have drunk it myself,"" the Hound told him. ""I can give you water, and the gift of mercy.""

&gt;The archer looked at him a long while before he said, ""You're Joffrey's dog.""

&gt;""My own dog now. Do you want the water?""

&gt;""Aye."" The man swallowed. ""And the mercy. Please.""

&gt;They had passed a small pond a short ways back. Sandor gave Arya his helm and told her to fill it, so she trudged back to the water's edge. Mud squished over the toe of her boots. She used the dog's head as a pail. Water ran out through the eyeholes, but the bottom of the helm still held a lot.

&gt;When she came back, the archer turned his face up and she poured the water into his mouth. He gulped it down as fast as she could pour, and what he couldn't gulp ran down his cheeks into the brown blood that crusted his whiskers, until pale pink tears dangled from his beard. When the water was gone he clutched the helm and licked the steel. ""Good,"" he said. ""I wish it was wine, though. I wanted wine.""

&gt;""Me too."" The Hound eased his dagger into the man's chest almost tenderly, the weight of his body driving the point through his surcoat, ringmail, and the quilting beneath. As he slid the blade back out and wiped it on the dead man, he looked at Arya. ""**That's where the heart is, girl. That's how you kill a man**.""

The captured lion is going to be Cersei and Arya was taught by Syrio Forel to capture cats:

&gt;Catching cats was hard. Her hands were covered with half-healed scratches, and both knees were scabbed over where she had scraped them raw in tumbles. At first even the cook's huge fat kitchen cat had been able to elude her, but Syrio had kept her at it day and night. When she'd run to him with her hands bleeding, he had said, ""So slow? Be quicker, girl. Your enemies will give you more than scratches."" He had dabbed her wounds with Myrish fire, which burned so bad she had had to bite her lip to keep from screaming. Then he sent her out after more cats.

&gt;**The Red Keep was full of cats.**

&gt; - Arya III AGoT

If, indeed, Arya gives Cersei the gift of mercy, it makes Jon Snow's first lesson: ""Stick them with the pointy end"" much more significant.  [Stick them with the pointy end is even one of two of GRRM's favorite lines in the books](https://today.tamu.edu/2013/03/22/author-george-r-r-martin-is-visiting-texas-am-talks-game-of-thrones-and-texas-am-libraries/).

[If you are interested, click here to read my ""Arya is Ned's Gift of Mercy to Cersei"" theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/7jpr67/spoilers_main_arya_is_neds_gift_of_mercy/)

The third time where he tempered it is where I'm unsure about.  But one thing I am sure about is that the third time is when it actually becomes lightbringer.  I believe, personally, the third time he tempered it is just saying Daenerys is going to die around the time it is made.  Why?

&gt;""When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east,"" said Mirri Maz Duur. ""When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves. When your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child. Then he will return, and not before.""

&gt;**Glowing like sunset**, a red sword was raised in the hand of a blue-eyed king who cast no shadow.

Oldtown is where Ice will likely become reforged into Lightbringer.  The sun rising in the West is it becoming forged in Oldtown (which is the location of the astrolabe that is used as the sun in the intro of game of thrones) and the sun setting in the east is when the Others are defeated.

I also believe that Ice will become named ""Fire"" when it becomes Lightbringer.  Making the title ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" much more significant.  I mean, Ned Stark's Ice is even on the cover of the first *A Song of Ice and Fire* book.  So I definitely think it's heading in that direction.

TL;DR - If present-day Brans affected Hodors past, fans he change almost anything? Is what we are watching just Brans altered world?

By now, I cant be the first person to consider the following, so if theres a good thread kindly direct me to it. 

If Bran can influence the past, he can undo a lot of story thus far, provided the change doesnt preclude his becoming the Three-Eyed Raven.

But (everything before it is bull$#!+ amiright Ned?)  IMHO most of the story wouldnt change Brans path. So couldnt he compose a version of events that nullifies quite a lot of the shows story?

Im guessing most of us dont need a deep lecture to appreciate a time paradox. If no such paradox exists, wouldnt it stand to reason Bran has been orchestrating quite a bit of the entire show?

If you don't know the theory then you can go read about if anywhere. If this were true, which I ship it, then that makes him the heir to the Iron Throne. With that said, and I'm not going to go into other details about this theory, I had a thought today, what if the sword Tywin had made (which is important or it wouldn't have been a season opener) is lightbringer, yea I know what your thinking, this is an old theory, I know but here me out. If that were true then this would be Jamies way to the honor he's always wanted and his purpose in the show to kill the Night King. Yea that's kind of an old theory too, but this is where my observations really click. Ok folks here it is.... I started thinking, if Gendry is king then he is the prince who was promised and would have to forge LightBringer in order to kill the night king. But what if that already happened? I thought what if he made jamies sword? So just for fun I looked up the epidode when Gendry was last seen before his return. It happened in the season 3 finale. Well just as I suspected and hoped for, season 4 opened up with Tywin watching people make Jamies sword. One of the men's faces are covered and the others are not for some reason. Then it cuts to Jamie looking at the sword and asking questions about it. Tywin says it was made by three people who know how to make them and one of them was from Volantis. He didn't mention who the other 2 were, and it was done in Kings landing. Now if you think about how clever JRRM is with his writing you could see how this is relevant. The time between season 3 and 4 in show terms is plenty enough time to Gendry to get back to Kings landing, the fact that he was not seen until season 7 hiding the fact he was helping make this, and the simple fact that he is a blacksmith in the first place. Cersies son or not he is the son of a king and if this is true it could be huge. What did ya'll think? (I typed really fast so my punctuation and Grammer is probably off)",16,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

Although their advance was stopped the wights didn't die. Some were able to come back up to the surface and attempted to drag Tormund back under. This scene deeply concerns me in regards to the Game of Thrones universe. 


If the wights can survive and even swim in water then there is nothing stopping them from conquering the entire [known world](https://orig00.deviantart.net/c59e/f/2015/141/1/b/westeros_and_essos_by_grimklok-d8u9ssk.png). They could quite possibly walk under oceans, lakes and rivers to reach new life. 


This also raises a number of concerns for Westeros. If water is not a legitimate barrier then the Northern islands of Skagos and Bear Island will not be safe. The southern islands including Tarth and Estermont will not be safe. The Iron Islands will not be safe. The river separating the North from the South will not act as a legitimate barrier. Dragonston will not be safe. Even Pentos and Braavos may not be safe. Heck even *Qarth* might not be safe (especially given that they have tons of corpses right outside their city). If the Night King isn't stopped then he could even eventually conquer the Golden Empire of Yi Ti. ",25,6,False,spoiler,,,,,

Then Jamie will come and stab him in the back like the mad king with his sword which could possibly be LightBringer, or even possibly Aryas Dagger. He needs to gain his awaited honor somehow. Or maybe like the fight with Bree Arya drops needle and the NK picks it up and stabs her ending the fight like the draw scene between her and Brieane when she drops her sword, then Jamie gets it and comes up behind him. Either way reallt. But the night king will be killed and it will be a bittersweet ending because Jon will run over and finally reunite with Arya while she's dying in his arms. It would be an awesome ending and honorable death for her. I think that's why her and Jon were never reunited back in Winterfell and I think she will die happy.

I also seem to recall that Cersei and Tycho Nestoris referring to it in their conversations. As we learned in season 7, the Iron Bank is backing Cersei and funding her hiring of the Golden Company. If Cersei does indeed lose the Great Game and someone other than her seizes the Iron Throne, how will the Iron Bank ""get its due""? Or, will they then fund someone else (presumably in the future) to seize the throne back and get Cersei's debts repaid? Or, will they just accept those losses?

I am curious how they might mitigate the risk of an investment of this magnitude, since Dany (at least on paper) seems to be able to take Westeros whenever she wants.

However in S07E05 EASTWATCH, Davos is in a couple of scenes that lead may believe that he may the Lord of Light rather than the Prince that was Promised. I recommend you read through the excellent post by u/followthebeard as all of the points he brings up I believe also fit the theory of Davos being the Lord of Light.

S07E05 35m14s - Davos is talking to Gendry when he questions why he isn't worried about being spotted in Kings Landing. Davos replies by saying ""Why should they recognise me, sometimes I hardly do.""

https://imgur.com/Xib7sVx

The framing changes as soon as Davos says ""sometimes I hardly do"" and has Davos standing behind the licking flames from Gendry's fire pit iron forger thing.

https://imgur.com/p12DCDE

His next line is ""Nothing fucks you as hard as time"" whilst picking up a sword from Gendry's rack.

https://imgur.com/kXylb9n

We know that Melisandre changes physical form with the help of the Lord of Light, so this quip by Davos could possibly be touching on the same thing. The framing of Davos behind a wall of fire also adds 'fire to the flames' of this theory. His final line, ""Nothing fucks you as hard as time"", is hinting at his un-human lifespan.

Later in the episode @ 44:39, Davos says ""yeah nobody mind me, all I've ever done is live to a ripe old age"".

Melisandre claims to have seen Jon Snow sister Arya, fleeing from a bad marriage situation to meet Jon Snow in Castle Black. The girl in the vision is wearing grey clothes riding a dying horse. She is avoiding the Kings Road and traveling west of the lakes on a dying horse.

&gt; for you are bastard born. I had not forgotten. I have seen your sister in my fires, fleeing from this marriage they have made for her. Coming here, to you. A girl in grey on a dying horse, I have seen it plain as day. It has not happened yet, but it will. -Jon, A Dance with Dragons

Later in another Jon chapter, a girl arrives at the wall:

&gt;A girls been found.
&gt; A girl? Jon sat, rubbing the sleep from his eyes with the back of his hands. 
&gt;Val? Has Val returned?
&gt;Not Val, mlord. This side of the Wall, it were.
&gt;Arya. Jon straightened. It had to be her. Girl, screamed the raven. Girl, girl. Ty and Donnel came on her two leagues south of Moles Town. They were chasing down some wildlings who scampered off down the king-sroad. Brought them back as well, but then they come on the girl. Shes highborn, mlord, and shes been asking for you.
&gt;How many with her? He moved to his basin, splashed water on his face. Gods, but he was tired.
&gt;None, mlord. She come alone. Her horse was dying under her. All skin and ribs it was, lame and lathered. &gt;They cut it loose and took the girl for questioning.
&gt;A grey girl on a dying horse. Melisandres fires had not lied, it would seem.  - Jon, A Dance with Dragons.

The girl who arrives is Alys Karstark but the important detail is that she is not wearing grey: The girl was curled up near the fire, wrapped in a black woolen cloak three times her size and fast asleep. 

&gt;The girl was curled up near the fire, wrapped in a **black woolen cloak** three times her size and fast asleep. 


Many people seems to think that is fArya who is the girl in the prophecy but that doesnt work either. If you pay attention to Melisandre conversation with Mance about the North you will see it that fArya also doesnt match the prophecy. George RRM even put the map of the North in the book to show that it couldnt be Jeyne Poole

&gt;How well do you know the north?
&gt;He slipped his blade away. As well as any raider. Some parts more than others. Theres a lot of north. Why?
&gt;The girl, she said. A girl in grey on a dying horse. Jon Snows sister. Who else could it be? She was racing to him for protection, that much Melisandre had seen clearly. I have seen her in my flames, but only once. We must win the lord commanders trust, and the only way to do that is to save her.
&gt;Me save her, you mean? The Lord o Bones? He laughed. No one ever trusted Rattleshirt but fools. Snows not that. If his sister needs saving, hell send his crows. I would.
&gt;He is not you. He made his vows and means to live by them. The Nights Watch takes no part. But you are not &gt;Nights Watch. You can do what he cannot.
&gt;If your stiff-necked lord commander will allow it. Did your fires show you where to find this girl?
&gt;I saw water. Deep and blue and still, with a thin coat of ice just forming on it. It seemed to go on and on &gt;forever.
&gt;Long Lake. What else did you see around this girl?
&gt;Hills. Fields. Trees. A deer, once. Stones. She is staying well away from villages. When she can she rides along the bed of little streams, to throw hunters off her trail.
&gt;He frowned. That will make it difficult. She was coming north, you said. Was the lake to her east or to her west? Melisandre closed her eyes, remembering. **West.**
&gt;She is not coming up the kingsroad, then. Clever girl. There are fewer watchers on the other side, and more cover. And some hidey-holes I have used myself from time He broke off at the sound of a warhorn and rose swiftly to his feet.  -Melisandre, A Dance with Dragons

FArya is comming from Stannis camp in Crofters Village, which is  located in the wolfswoodwest of Winterfell, on the west side of the kingsroad and on the wrong side of Long Lake. Whereas Alys Karstark was coming from Karhold, which is located on the east side of the North, but its no where near Long Lake. This makes neither girl the one Melisandre saw in the flames. 

This is why I believe that the prophecy is about Sansa. Melisandre always gets her visions wrong, we forget that Jon Snow has another sister, who is also missing. We know Sansa is in the Vale and there she is been forced to enter a marriage to Harrold Hardyng. Sansa just discovered that Jon is alive and well and was just named Lord Commander of the Nights Watch. 

Now in the show we have Sansa fleeing Winterfell, escaping a terrible marriage to Ramsey Bolton, crossing the North to go to Castle Black, looking for her brother Jon Snow. In the show they made sure to include that Sansa and Theon crossing a frozen. Sansa arrives at Castle Black, on a horse wearing a grey cloak. 

Now, if Sansa leaves the Vale and takes a ship to White Harbor, she will have Long Lake on her west going North towards Castle Black. You also see the landscape doesnt so much of mountains and woods like the other side of long lake (where the kingsroad is at where fArya is coming from), more with hills, fields, and this trees if being compare. It will still be a long journey since the North is the size of the other six kingdoms (and winter coming) that it makes sense her will be on a dying horse once she reached Castle Black.

We see the matriarchy demonstrated in two characters: Margaery and Olenna. Margaery holds the key to the crown while Olenna has her son under her fingers.

But here's the thing. Olenna was not always a member of House Tyrell - she was married into it. This means that the politics within the Reach would have been very different had Olenna's husband married a different woman.

Furthermore, as much as Margaery embodies the [philosophy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36kXaz-qR28&amp;) of House Tyrell, she is ultimately Baratheon by marriage. Her children will be Baratheon, not Tyrell, which implies a lot of uncertainty for the House's matriarchal rule.

I mean, as somebody who got into it very late and only heard about it vaguely before, I have a bit of a different perspective on it than long-time fans. It's obvious from the very first episode that this show is extremely well produced. The plot is interesting, the characters are extremely well written and the presentation is very appealing. The lore and the believable-ness of the world give it an incredibly fleshed-out feel.

But the thing that I do not yet quite get is how fans feel about with the gore, sexual violence, torture scenes and all the other gruesome stuff. I think it's safe to say that GoT's depictions of horrific actions/events are quite a bit more vivid than in most mainstream films or shows. I have only gotten halfway through season 2, but I've already come across a couple of scenes that really stuck with me for days after watching them. Especially the sexual violence. I've actually debated several times to stop watching further because it started to counter my enjoyment of the rest of the show. I mean, one could argue that I'm just a big ol' softie and that this kind of content just isn't for me but with the level of extremity the series goes to (and I've been told that it only gets more extreme in later seasons), I would imagine I can't be the only case. Especially considering how widespread GoT's popularity is, including all the teenage viewers.

So tl;dr: Do GoT fans usually just manage to look past gruesome depictions? Are all GoT viewers just extremely hardboiled dudes and dudettes? Or is that part of the appeal?

I'd be really interested in people's rationales here.

Thanks guys.

I have read now alot of fantheories about a possible ending for Game of Thrones.
George rrr Martin said, that it will be a bittersweet ending. I think alot of people dont seem to know the difference between bittersweet and a fucking massacre. E.G Jon dies and Dany lives is not bittersweet but just tragic like in a drama. I think bittersweet means a happy ending but with a kind of a bitter side (high price for that happy ending).
Or by killing the nightking every Stark dies is not bittersweet its just sad and not a happy ending or sweet at all. 

In my opinion a viable ending could be somethink like jon and dany survive but they end but dany has to give up the throne and give it to someone else and jon isnt her lover anymore. 
Thats bittersweet but not Bran is the nightking, jon kills dany to forge a sword wich he uses to kill the nightking wich causes the death of every stark and jamie kills cersei and gets then killed and tormund gets killed und everybody with fucking like gets FUCKING KILLED and the only one who survives is Sam and facking Tyrion. THAT IS NOT BITTERSWEET AT ALL THATS JUST A MASSACRE!!!
Cant we just dream of something nice?

EDIT

WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU???
Dany dying in childbirth??? I dont really like Dany but I think she deserves a better dead like doing a last man standing with here drogons or in another deadly 1v1 with the nightking and his dragon. But I swear if grrm kills Dany in childbirth I will throw rotten eggs and diapers at his house",46,12,False,spoiler,,,,,

Probably most of the bad guys, but a lot of the good guys too. And I'm really worried that the deaths won't be fulfilling, because of the reduced episode count. If we take most of the major deaths over the series, most of them were built to. Ned, Robb, Ramsay, Joffrey, Tywin, the list goes on - all had at least one episode, if not more, to really prep you for their death and then deliver a satisfying conclusion. It will have moved from ""Oh no, someone might die this episode"" to ""okay, who's dying this episode?"", and it will basically turn into a waiting game to see who gets picked off. 

I would love to be wrong, and who knows, I might be. Whoever dies might have a really fulfilling death on screen that's a proper sendoff to their character, but I'm not holding my breath. What do you all think, do you think that the deaths will be properly served?",94,191,False,spoiler,,,,,

This will not be my full predictions on Season 8 as a whole as I will be doing that some other time (once I figure out how to shorten it into one post rather then multiple posts). But today will be my predictions of the overall ending for the series so let's get started.

Too make it easier I will TRY to give the short version of my predictions...Here it goes....The NK destroys the rest of the wall, Cersei has a miscarriage, Jon finds out his parentage, Jon and Dany's forces get pushed back, several characters die at the battle in the North, Jaime, Arya, The Hound, Gendry, and Brienne get sent on a mission to deal with Cersei, Arya and Gendry hook up at some point, and Bran will go to the God's eye with my boy Howland Reed...Oh and Euron betrays Cersei at some point. Like I said those are not my full predictions I will be releasing the full ones some time before S8 but for now these are my predictions for the endgame.

After surviving childbirth Dany will fight NK on Drogon but Drogon and Dany will die in combat, Jon will be sadden by this once he hears about this but before he does he will be at the God's Eye where Bran reveals to him that Jon is Lightbringer and his father Rhaegar was AA/TPTWP. He also reveals that the WW's have returned to end the curse the children put on them but the only way too do it is to destroy/burn the Weirwood (this idea for the ending was inspired by Smokescreen's prediction for the ending check out his channel he makes really good content), This will be the Bittersweet ending in that Jon will end the curse but he will have to destroy a piece of his heritage and on top of that his lover is dead.

So after Jon fights the NK one on one and kills him the Wights collapse but as the WW's are about to break apart Jon stabs a Dragonglass dagger into his heart turning himself into the new NK to prevent the WW's from being destroyed before they can end there curse. The WW's stop breaking apart and Bran Wargs into Rhaegal and Rhaegal burns the Weirwood in the God's Eye with Jon saving Bran before he gets burnt to a crisp. The WW's including Jon turn back too human and afterwards Bran finishes Warging Rhaegal and Jon kills Rhaegal to bring balance back to the world, Jon would then be offered the throne but he would decline it to go with Bran too live the rest of his days with the now turned human WW's.

Bran would be made king in the North, A New house is made leader of Pyke, Edmure becomes Lord of the Riverlands, Arya either sails off more west with Gendry by her side or marries Gendry and they become Lord and Lady of the Stormlands (if not well then a new house rules the Stormlands), Another Sand Snake rules Dorne, Sam and Gilly are made Lord and Lady of the Reach, Timett the Clansmen is given the Vale, and Sansa is made queen of the Seven Kingdoms.",20,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

The direct counter-example is the Tyrell.

""I learned from the White Bull and Barristan the Bold,"" Jaime snapped. ""I learned from Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning, who could have slain all five of you with his left hand while he was taking with a piss with the right."" 

But reading this quote, Im not so sure:
Robert had been stronger than him, to be sure. The White  Bull Gerold Hightower as well, in his heyday, and Ser Arthur Dayne. Amongst the living, Greatjon Umber was stronger, Strongboar of Crakehall most likely, both Cleganes for a certainty. The Mountains strength was like nothing human. It did not matter.

&gt;My father's army **descended on the Tarbecks so quickly that Lord Walderen had no time to gather his forces, and rode against my father with only his household knights.** Soon his head, his son's heads and the heads of any man with Tarbeck blood adorned the spears of the Lannister vanguard as it marched to Tarbeck Hall. At their approach, **Lady Ellyn Tarbeck closed the gates and sent ravens to her brothers at Castamere. She assumed they'd have more than enough time to muster their armies and break what would be a long siege: my father had trebuchets up in a day and brought down the keep within hours.** Lady Ellyn and her son were crushed in its fall. When the Tarbeck forces surrendered, my father put their castle to the torch.





This is basically repeated in the events at Highgarden where Jaime and the Tarlys were more or less able to get the drop on Lady Tyrell ensuring that they only faced the garrison there and not the full power of the reach (the lords/families that were still loyal to Olenna) As well as siege lasting only a short time (days if not hours) Its also worth noting that the same soundtrack (A Lion's Legacy) is also used and is somewhat synced to the same events (the march and siege)

Personally, i think that not telling us is an alternate form of Chekhov's gun where they have deliberately not told us who she is so that there can be a surprise change in the plot in season 8. 

Game of Thrones just has so much background depth about some many characters who are completely irrelevant to the current story and yet the grandmother of arguably the main character in Game of Thrones (Jon) and the mother of arguably the main character of season 1 (Ned) is just completely unknown to us. I just think its odd and worth discussing.

The battle of the bastards would never of happened.

Jon and dany would have never had happened (you know what I'm talking about ;)

They probably wouldn't have winterfell back.

Arya probably would of went to kill cersei instead of going to see Jon.

This would also probably mean no dragon dying or capturing a wight, since that was Jon's idea.

In a flashback Bran sees the first White Walker being created by the Children of the Forest. They stab a human in the heart with dragon glass. 

In the season 5 final, we see Jon Snow being stabbed in the heart by Olly. Like the first White Walker, Jon Snow lives on (eventually).

Now, my idea (less of a theory, tbh) is that Olly's dagger could have been Valyrian Steel, a supposedly magic substance which, other than Dragon Glass, is one of the only known weapons that can harm White Walkers.

Could Olly's dagger have been Valyrian Steel? - I've rewatched the scene and it's unclear if they all use the same knife, or if Olly has his own.

If it was Valyrian Steel, could it have changed Jon somehow?

Could this have 'paired' Jon and the Night King somehow?

Harrenhal is a pretty good place to be as long as the dragon doesn't show up, Casterly Rock is also quite the fortress, especially since the enemy isn't keen on water, likewise Dragonstone wouldn't be the worst place to be, or sailing to the East, but The Eyrie seems like the ultimate location.

The Eyrie is constantly set up as this impenetrable fortress, but we never see it being used. Thanks to being comically high, there is only one way in and it is brutal. If you wanted to stand any chance, you would need wave after wave after wave of soldiers to make any progress through the narrow passage, and the soldiers that make it need to be tireless to make the climb, and to battle their all the way up as the lines of defense get tougher and at their full energy, there are giant solid gates to pass, it is more or less IMPOSSIBLE to attack.

Impossible of course unless you have an army of the dead and a dragon. The numbers of dead are stupidly high, and they fight without hesitation, you can pick as many off as you can but there are more and more and more. The mountain is a crazy advantage, as long as your enemy doesn't have a dragon.

Other reasons this is a good location is that it is basically right in the middle off everything, in fact the Trident is pretty ideal, The Twins, Harrenhal(right by Gods Eye too), The Eyrie, equidistant from Casterly Rock, Dragonstone(where the dragonglass is being mined), and Kings Landing(lots of Wildfire, Cersei plot), not far from the Iron Islands, and of course there is water everywhere. It's also about the same distance from Winterfell as it is from Dorne. Gives us a chance to see what will become of the young Arryn who was last seen training iirc. It is closer to Braavos and the free cities for potential involvement from Iron Bank, Faceless Men and Golden Company, or anyone in the Eastern continent(s). It would also parallel the prologue in which an Arryn goes beyond the wall to be slaughtered. This is also where Rhaegar was killed, Danys brother, Jons father, Cerseis dream boy, and the catalyst of pretty much everything happening in the seven kingdoms.

It HAS to end up here.

EDIT: 

I also did some pondering today about the Eyrie and think it is worth noting the immediate plot catalyst(aside from prologue who is also an Arryn) Jon Arryn is also connected to Tully(Lysa/Riverrun), Stark(Ned/Winterfell), and Baratheon(Rob/Storms End), connected to Lannisters(Casterly Rock) through stumbling onto Cerseis big secret, he is the namesake of Jon Snow, and he was basically the king of Westoros while Robert lived the high life, which in a way connects him to Dany too since he essentially took over from her father.

Now some people who still think N+A=J is a thing think that it could happen in the books...I don't think so. For many reasons but mainly because 1. If it was D&amp;D would've made it his parentage in the show as well as they were told who Jon's parents were 2. GRRM would just not have Jon's parents be different in the books, It would confuse people and not only D&amp;D but also GRRM himself would get criticism for not making his parentage the same in both sources of Media and I don't think GRRM would want to risk that.

and 3. If GRRM told D&amp;D R+L=J was true and GRRM actually was doing N+A=J that would be the biggest troll ever. Personally I don't think Ned and Ashara had a affair or anything like that, Maybe Ned had something for her but I don't think it led too anything like that.

In our world, eye color follows some fairly basic rules: brown = dominant, blue = recessive. As long as a person has at least one dominant gene (brown) that person will have brown eyes. Only people with two recessive genes will show the recessive trait (blue eyes). 

Everyone has two genes that determine eye color - one from each parent. Anyone with blue eyes can only pass on a gene for blue eyes to their children. This is the simple version. There are of course some complexities that deal with hazel, green and other shades, but thats not important for my point. 

Lets look at the Stark children in light of the above. At least the TV versions. 

Jon Snow has brown eyes. This is easily explained because his mother, Lyanna, has brown eyes (at least the actress playing her does). Also who knows what Targaryen genes are up to.

Ned Stark and his wife, Caitlin Tully, both have blue eyes. This means that all of their children can have only blue eyes.

Sansa - check
Arya - check
Rickon - check

I had an idea I would have LOVED to see in play.

*Maybe* Gendry could had been recognized as legitimate, wether by pardoning his bastardy (although I believe that would require Robert's consent) or by confirming the (now long-disregarded) old theory saying he might have been Cersei's only legitimate child with Robert (Cersei and Robert only had a child in the show, but it's been confirmed he died and wasn't Gendry, killing the theory).

Why am I so interested in seeing Gendry recognized as a Baratheon? Because I enjoy the idea of having Stannis crown his nephew and swear loyalty and protection to the new king (for real, no betrayals), and having Selyse and Shireen and Davos embrace him as a member of the family (Davos deserves to be treated as an uncle, come on), and, this is my favorite part, **having Shireen teach Gendry to read and write**.

I just think there was so much potential for character development and exploration, and I found those potential scenes so heartwarming.

We all know that in season 1 and episode 9 Ned Stark gets beheaded on the command of Joffrey but I'm going to talk about strange the behavior I've seen about this.

I see this attitude a lot towards Sansa haters, and it's the core reason a lot of people hate her. I also think it's one of the dumbest reasons to hate her because she had no say in it at all.

Saying Sansa is the sole reason behind Ned's death pretty much gives everyone else involved in it a path who directly made it happen (i.e. Littlefinger and Joffrey.) People say Sansa wrote that letter to Rob and that was a direct act of portrayal-I'm convinced these people:
1.) Haven't watched the scene
2.) Didn't pay attention
3.) Just hated Sansa from episode 1 and overlook it on purpose.

In the scene Cersei, quite explicitly tells Sansa that the only way to save her father is to write that letter to Rob. In the show it goes a bit faster, but in the books Cersei really pulls at Sansa basically using her love for her father as a way to manipulate her into writing the letter. The show does show that, but it just goes a little more subtle, and I guess that was for the worse since it's glossed over by many people apparently.

Let's also now state the obvious SHE FELL BEFORE JOFFREY IN FRONT OF HIS WHOLE COURT AND BEGGED FOR MERCY ON HER FATHER.

Even then we also need to point out that Sansa CONVINCED Cersei to let Ned Stark live and Cersei was ALSO caught off guard with Joffrey's decision to behead him and she expected Ned to live and planted that into Joffrey's head. It was the fact that Joffrey was a complete and utter psycho that ruined both Sansa and Cersei's plan that caused the beheading and ended Ned's life. Sansa did what she could when she was essentially being held hostage and when they presented her with the option to vouch for her father's life she did all that she could, she can't simply warg into Joffrey and make him take back the decision to behead Ned at the last minute (but damn that would've been awesome, I need to write that fanfiction.) 

People also say she betrayed her family by sticking up for Joffrey at King's Landing, which is again pretty damn false. She obviously hated Joffrey, in fact, no one hated Joffrey more than Sansa. I'm certain. He tortured her endlessly while she was being held hostage, had her beaten, ridiculed, and even threatened to rape her at one point. The only reason she played the goody-two-shoes is because she knew one false move or word and she and her whole family could be dead in an instant.

I'll be making a follow up post to this, because everything else I want to say contains spoilers for season 7 and I really don't want this taken down.

Part 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/7pvp4j/s1e9_sansa_is_not_to_blame/

Continuing, what prompted me to make these posts is that I saw a clip on YT from season 7, episode 5 where Arya is being a total jerk to Sansa. I love Arya, but she really seems to be less of the great, developed and layer character she was and more of this one dimensional internet troll. It's like she did all of that training in Braavos for nothing, she seemed to gain more perspective when she was training with Syrio Forel.

So she finds a letter Sansa wrote to Robb way back in season 1 when she was forced to under the hold of Cersei under the belief that she could save their father, BUT Arya for some reason completely dismisses it and claims that she's just power hungry. Sansa, naturally gets defensive and states that Arya doesn't know what she's been through (she doesn't, and no one can state that what Sansa went through was easy. You try being held hostage in place you're unfamiliar in where everybody pretty much hates you and see how well you handle it.) Arya claims she was selfish (Arya really just argues in circles during this whole episode) and Sansa actually points out the fact that while she was rotting away in King's Landing and getting used by Littlefinger, Arya went across the narrow sea. Now Arya isn't terrible for doing that, she felt the need to train, but it does simply paint the picture that they both did what they had to do in order to stay alive and try not to stir up more trouble than they already had. Honestly speaking, what good would Arya or Sansa be if they were dead? None. They needed to survive.

Then Arya gets mad at Sansa for possibly wanting to rule Winterfell. So what if she does? Robb is dead. Bran doesn't want Winterfell (she even states that Winterfell could technically be Bran's but he refuses because he has mystical duties.) And Rickon is also dead. Sansa is technically the only true living heir to Winterfell considering she's the eldest living Stark and could have challenged Jon's rights to it (if we're talking purely based off of nepotism here.) But she didn't. Arya comes off as wanting Sansa out of the way so that she can have a claim to Winterfell given that with Sansa out of the picture, Arya would technically be the only Stark heir available (again Bran doesn't want Winterfell so excluding him.) The scene was just weird and didn't really to fit in place with what they should be doing, which is working together.

To make matters worse I see a lot of people defending Arya and saying that she's right, that Sansa is a power hungry monster, and that they hope she gets Sansa out of the way. Like what? Arya sounded like a straight up emo brat in that scene, and Sansa was completely in the right. This is coming from someone who loves both of the Stark sisters. Sansa is not to blame for Ned's death and the fact that even Arya fell into that trap of believing it was just disappointing and honestly, comes off as messy.",37,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I am working on a version of a party game mimicking Family Feud but themed in the world of ASOIAF/Game of Thrones. I am looking to get some survey results to use for the game's content. If you would like to contribute, please leave your answers and they will be combined with results from other surveys I have done in the final game! Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Topics:

1) Name a bastard surname

2) If you could bring one character back from the dead, who would it be? (as in, you wish they hadn't died when they did. Like, I miss this person. Wish they hadn't died.)

3) Who would you ask to be your champion if you were left to a trial by combat? (can be dead or alive, excluding legendary characters and such)

4) Name a castle in Westeros besides the Red Keep

5) Name someone who was king after the Targaryen rule was over (Robert's rebellion ended the rule, so from then on)

6) Name a tilte used by Daenerys Targaryen

7) Name a house WITHOUT an animal in the sigil

8) Name something high-born have their servants do for them

9) Name a member of the Night's Watch besides Jon Snow

10) Name something a knight takes into battle",6,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

When I first started reading the books I realized that Daenerys was making a lot of mistakes in Essos ad I thought that those mistakes were completely understandable, she was a young girl, with no experience in ruling and it was normal to have failures BUT by the end of the saga she would have mature and turned into a solid and capable ruler and that would be her character arc. But then I realized that we are on book 5 of a series of 7, in the tv show we are going to the last and final season and she still isnt a capable and reliable ruler. 

Daenerys went to  Astapor and took the city army and ordered all the slavers to murdered, she then left the city (since she had no interest at all in them) and the city fell apart. Daenerys destroyed the power structure of Astapor which is not a tragedy in itself because of how rotten it was. But then she creates an ad hoc council of people she barely know but think are nice and then leave them to their own device. Later when she went to Meereen she decided to stay longer, so that she could not make the same mistake that she did in Astapor. She ended slavery, crucified the master (burning every bridge and chance to ever have peace with the leaders of Meereen) destroyed the local economy and brought the city to their knees. Yes, ending slavery is a good thing, but it needs to be a lifelong decision, not a 6 project. She once again destroy what used to be a rich and prosper city. 

She then is taken as a captive by the Dothraki and while there she is strong enough to save herself, she kills all the Khals and literally BURN DOWN the temple and conquers all the Dothrakis. Daenerys Blood and Fire is the only way she is able to conquer. Thats is her gift and her tragedy!!!!

Daenerys is a good woman, with a kind and gentle heart, but she is also utterly incompetent when it comes to ruling. She had no formal education, her mentor was cruel Viserys. Her advisors are morally corrupted men that want either use her or sleep with her. Add to that the fact that she is hot headed and can be blind by anger. Her decision to burn down the Tallys will have a bad consequences, just like crucifying the masters in Meereen did. 


In the end of season 6, when Daenerys returned to Mereen, she wanted, and I quote:

&gt; I will crucify the masters, I will set their fleet afire, kill every one of their soldiers and return the city to the dirty.

It was Tyrion who convinced her that there was a better way that involved less carnage and death. Then as soon as she arrived in Westeros she mentioned that if Viserys was alive he would already burned down KL and taken the Iron Throne, Tyrion once again remind her that she was not in Westeros to be the queen of the ashes. Then as soon as her plans all failed and she lost her allies she once again wanted to use the dragons to take the Throne and destroy her enemies, this time it was Jon Snow who stopped her and proposed another plan. 

A Queen that has to be restrained over and over about burning down the country is not fit to rule and no, I dont think Jon will calm her down (he is the ice to her fire, the fuck), this is a stupid idea. **The show is trying to show us that Daenerys is not fit to rule the Seven Kingdoms. She is short sighted, when Tyrion wanted to discuss succession she got mad at him and snapped, because this is a painful topic to her since she believes to be barren, showing once again that she is not mature enough to rule; She burned down the Tallys (just like her father burned down Richard Stark and his son); burned down the food from Highgarden; lost allies and in the end of the season she was literally ignoring her advisers and going with Jon Snow ideas because she was infatuated by him (again, not a good sign for a ruler).**

 Daenerys journey in Essos was made by destruction, pure and simple. Yes she had good intentions, but the consequences of her actions were disastrous. Thats why I think her character will take a turn in season 8. Her armies are not ready for the winter, she already lost one dragon and the Lords are not gonna love her and bend their knees at her sight. The cast is doing interviews about season 8 and most of them is telling that ""this wont end like people are expecting to end"". The audience left season 7 with Jon and Dany having sex and looking in love, I dont think this is how its going to end. I think they are preapring a twist for the audience. ",64,14,False,spoiler,,,,,

However I never really could excuse his hatred and mistreating for Tyrion. Tywin always said it was because Tyrion killed his wife at birth, but that felt like a weak excuse and like his real reason was that he just hated him for being a dwarf. However when watching some stuff back Tywin said the following:
'Men's laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors since I cannot prove that you are not mine. And to teach me humility the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my father's sigil and his father's before him. But neither gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse'
This explained so much for me. I know that there are theories that Tyrion is actually the product of Aerys Targaryen raping Tywins wife, but this was never confirmed. But Tywin saying that he cannot prove Tyrion is not his confirmed that he himself is suspicious that Aerys is probably Tyrions father. And that suddenly makes it so clear why Tywin hates Tyrion. Just imagine after being laughed at most of your life, having a deformed child that you not only know will be the laughing stock of your family and killed your beloved wife at birth but also is probably not even yours, but then when instead of letting the child die, you raise him as your own and he doesn't even try to be a good son and goes around whoring and getting drunk whenever he wants.",14,6,False,spoiler,,,,,

It got me thinking about what a sphinx is. In the book I believe its part human, lion, and hawk.

What if the three headed dragon is more of a metaphor. I think Daenerys loses another dragon before the end of the series.

I think three charactors with with three different beasts will make the three headed dragon.

I think two of the three is Daenerys with her dagon, Jon with his Dyre wolf. I just dont know what the third would be.

I know that this couple causes a lot of drama here in the forums, but yes, we have to talk about the chances of a political marriage between Jon and Sansa. Ned Stark marriage to Catelyn was a political move did by duty, to united House Stark and House Tully, uniting Riverlands and North, mind you, because Cat had a sister that married Jon Arryn, the marriage end up uniting also North and Vale, something that its being very useful in the past seasons. And looks at that, Ned and Cat marriage turned out to be one of the most loving and healthy relationship in the books and show, producing 5 well-adjusted kids. 


The show has been hitting at the parallels between Jon and Sansa and Ned and Cat this past season; we saw Jon Snow  leave Winterfell to go find allies for the fight against the Army of the Dead while Sansa was left ruling the castle and taking care of the North and mind you, they make sure to show that she is doing a fine good job.
Sansa was caring about food supplies, armors, soldiers vestments, provisions, not to mention she was quite good at calming the High Lords about their concerns over the KITN. This is all duties of a Queen and remember in the books she said it: If I am ever Queen I am make them love me. She is doing that, the Lords of the Vale and North all love her.

Jon would be a charismatic leader that unites the Kingdom and Sansa would be his consort Queen with experience in the Game of Thrones. They would be great for Westeros. Uniting House Targaryen with House Stark, North and South, bringing peace and stability to the Kingdom.


I know that after season 7 finale everybody  keeps on thinking that Jon and Dany will end up together in the end of the show, but several actors now have given interviews telling people that the end is not what people are expecting.

Thats not happening. This story, A Song of Ice and Fire, is done. Theres no revival, reboot, spinoff talk.

It is a double-edged sword, but there is a sense of reassurance that Game of Thrones will be preserved as is. However, even with HBO vowing to leave show where it ends, that wont stop some far-off rights buyout and a different network remaking the story a la Lord of the Rings in a hypothetical future.

- Theon sacrificing himself to save Yara and the Starks

- Jaime sacrificing himself to kill Cersei and save Westeros

- Daario Naharis leading the Golden Company (and therefore being hired to literally kill Daenerys)

- Drogon sacrificing himself to kill Undead Viserion, and later Jon adopting Rhaegal, the last dragon

- Bran breaking into Aeris Targaryen's mind from 25 years earlier and making him yell ""Burn them all!""

Listen you aren't telling me anything I don't already know, but bear with me. I'm in season one of Game of Thrones (and loving it), and OBVIOUSLY a world of zombies, magic, dragon eggs, etc. is not indicative of good old Earth Prime. However, Game of Thrones has a certain.... unique feel to the community that goes beyond the mystical. Between the political structures, the judicial branches (or lack thereof), the roles of males and females, the interactions of the townspeople to the respective authority, the general community feel, the push to get married at 13, the general mannerisms of the people, etc... I would find myself thinking, huh, I wonder if the culmination of all of these things is what it really used to be like, or if this is an exaggeration or, even crazier, UNDER-exaggeration of the general feel and attitude of the time.

As Jaime leaves Cersei once and for all, his parting words to her are ""I don't believe you"". I was just curious how other fans interpreted these words:

1) Disgust that she would play games with him and threaten his life with The Mountain: ""I don't believe you would do this.""

2) Telling her he thinks her pregnancy is faked: ""I don't believe you, there isn't another.""

3) Neither - something else.

4) Both, double meaning.

I have a new theory on the Queen prophecy!!!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/7qsw1o/everything_until_there_comes_another_younger_and/,juligen,1516115298,"It cant be Daenerys, is literally impossible to be her. Is Sansa Stark, I have no doubts anymore. The prophecy said that ""until it comes another, younger, more beautiful, to cast you down and take all that you hold dear. **We can summarize all Cersei holds dear in 4 points: her kids, her father, her lover and her power and crown.** I think we can agree that Cersei's kids, Jaime, Tywin and her power are the most important things in her life. 

 

Its literally impossible for Daenerys to be the queen in the prophecy, because she had nothing to do with Cersei's children's death or Tywin death and she also had nothing to do with Jaime leaving Cersei, this happens in the books wayyyy before Daenerys arrives in Westeros. Unless we are now pretending that Jofrey, Myrcella, Tommen, Tywin and Jaime are not things that Cersei holds dear and **I can not do that, that would be to ignore everything that the books have been telling us, or even the  tv show.**

 

It was Sansa who was brave enought to tell  Olenna Tyrell that Jofrey was a monster, after that Olenna organized for him to be murdered because she didnt  wanted Margeary to be married to him, that unleashed a chain reaction causing Cersei to lose all her children and her father. Jofrey trial caused Oberyn Martell to be killed in the Trial by combat fight against the Montain, which will eventually  lead to Myrcella death, the trial also causes Tywin to be murdered by his own son Tyrion (after he was wrongly accused of killing Joffrey). Later Tommen marries Margeary (because Jofrey was killed) making Cersei very worried and paranoid, which will bring down the Tyrells and Tommen himself. All because Joffrey was poisoned. 

 

Cersei is also going to lose Jaime to Sansa, remember that was because he made a promise to Catelyn Stark to return her daughters safe and alive to Winterfell that he met Brienne, and that relationship changed Jaime forever and made his affair with Cersei even more strained. In the books they are already separated way before what happens in season 7 and he mentions in one of his chapters in the books  **Sansa Stark is my last chance for Honor** . I now believe that he will ride North alone in season 8 and pledge himself to Sansa, offering his services to her. 

Sansa will marry her cousin Aegon Targaryen (I will talk more about this later) and in the end she and Arya will take the North, Vale and Riverland armies down south to get back the Iron Throne defeating Cersei and taking finally all the things she holds dear.

 

Cersei belongs to Sansa and Arya, she has no connection to Daenerys what so ever, Dany bringing down Cersei and the Lannisters would had no emotion payout for the audience, But the Starks girls?  after all Cersei had  done to them? After killing Lady? Killing Ned Stark?  torturing Sansa?  plotting and celebrating the Red Wedding? After trying to destroy House Stark for years??? 

 

Sansa Stark is the Queen, more beautiful, younger, who will cast Cersei down taking EVERYTHING she holds dear. BTW in the pilot in season 1, the very first thing Cersei says to Sansa after meeting her? ""What a beauty"" ",52,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

It is hard to imagine anyone other than the likes of Kit Harington or Emilia Clarke in their respective roles, and Cunninghams part as Ser Davos is no exception. First appearing in the second season of the ice and fire epic, Ser Davos served as the loyal right-hand man of Stannis Baratheon. While Davos former employer and many other characters have been sent to an early grave on the show, Cunningham has survived the War of the Five Kings to become a major player in the shows endgame.

However, even with Cunninghams gruff sailor being a hardened survivor of the series, it all couldve been so different. Speaking to GQ, the 56-year-old revealed that Ser Davos wasnt the first role he set his sights on:

 They said the old thing: Were going to go another way. But: Weve got more characters coming in Season Two, and we want to see you. And I went, Yeah, yeah. This is Hollywood letting me down politely. But sure enough, they came back.

You (somehow) manage to get a ship (on loan....or for laughs you steal Euron Greyjoys ship while his on land), you get a crew willing to sail you there (they must be high on that new Dothraki bush weed to actually take you near Old Valyria) and you arrive with no sea based accidents.

My questions should be easy to you guys. So here there are. Question 1-

What dangers are you facing there? Stone men being one of them, what else? I hear that the doom of Valyria was volcanic in nature, so poisonous gas and fumes? Molten lava? Scary GOT mythological creatures? (excepting dragons since they're all dead)

And question 2...what are the rewards?

So you survived all that ( God from our world must be really liking you, you know it ain't Rhill'or or The drowned god helping your ass out. And the Old gods be loving the stark club only.) What are the rewards?

Gold? Dragon eggs? Method to forging valyrian steel? Resurrected Targaryen Waifu? ;) White walker flame Bugspray?

As Tyrion is actually a nice person, he refuses to bed his wife until she says he can, so it's unconsummated as she disappears off after Joffrey's wedding and the subsequent fun.

Here's where it gets difficult... In the show, she is then married to Ramsey, but in the books, that part is taken by Jayne Poole, her childhood friend, who is brought out as Arya to seal the Bolton's hold on the North, so technically, Sansa is still married to Tyrion anyway. Either way, with Ramsey's death in the show, and Sansa not being married to him in the first place in the books, she's still legally married to Tyrion.

I keep thinking that Sansa and Tyrion would make an extraordinarily powerful couple if they got it together, not only because of their respective inheritances (since Bran doesn't want to take up the role of Lord Stark of Winterfell), but because of the way their characters are as people. I do think that without Sansa second guessing every nice thing Tyrion does for her, as she did in the past, wondering if it was a trap to get her to say or do something that could be considered ""treasonous"", she could actually come to enjoy being his wife.

I personally would like to see them reconcile in the last series. Anyone else feel the same?",63,16,False,spoiler,,,,,

That was until S6 and S7 where she started to become more independent and seemed like an actual player in the Game of Thrones and I far cry from what she was in S1 (except for that S5 but we don't talk about that....Like...Ever), But how will her story end.

Now I did do something like this already with Arya but unlike Arya it's alittle easier to pinpoint where Sansa's story could end since her endgame is not a enigma as much as Arya's is but she still has some possibilities so let's take a look:

1. She dies- Now this one is a divisive option, Some people think it will happen while others no so much I fit in the category of people who don't think she'll die for a lot of reasons but mainly because it would make her entire arc and storyline a complete waste of time. That being said if done right it could work and in my opinion if it did happen here is how I think it would play out. There is only room for one more person for the wagons that will escort the Stark children so Sansa gives it to Arya (or Gendry if Arya already found a spot and Arya and Gendry hooked up at this point) and she chooses to stay at WF (a captain goes down with the ship situation), and she is killed by the NK.

2. Night Queen- On the other hand it is possible the NK could turn her into his Night Queen or if Jon makes a pact he could have to marry Sansa to the NK and have her become the Night Queen. Now I don't think any of that will happen either nor do I think there will be a Night Queen at this point and if there is I think it will probably be Cersei.

3. Queen in the North- Now this one makes the most sense as it has been set up the most, It does not seem like she wants to go back up South anytime soon, and she wants it anyways and I believe she could be queen in the north by the end if she is not queen of the Seven Kingdoms (weather or not she marries again, Well that is a different story). A lot of people are starting to think Arya could be Queen of the North but I think it will be Sansa.

4. Queen of the Seven Kingdoms- If Arya, Jon, or Gendry don't become rulers of Seven Kingdoms at the end then Sansa may be Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, Because out of all the people besides Arya who deserve the throne the most after what they've been through it is Sansa (Especially if Jon and Dany are not alive at the end and if Arya does not get the throne). There is actually a lot of forshadowing for this in the books with it paralleling the real Virgin queen of England. Now yes she is not a virgin in the show but that does not change the fact she could still be queen in the show.

5. She marries Podrick- Yes I am not joking either. Now a lot of people think she will marry Tyrion or the Hound I don't think her bound with the Hound was Romantic bound I think it was more of a brother/sister bound or a father and daughter bound like with Arya. As for Tyrion well they may be friends and I think Sansa does care for him in that way but I don't think they will re-marry. Some people think she will be with Jon but that is just fanfiction, In my opinion I think if she should be with anybody it should be Pod because she has always wanted to fall in the love with a Prince and I could not have gone worse for her, So if she found true healthy love in the form of a squire I think it would be ironic, show how much she has changed as a character, and overall be a fitting end.",41,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

First, it just made me chuckle, because I pictured someone saying that the day before the NK blew it down at the end of S7. But it also made me realize that aside from most people not believing in the white walkers, most people take the Wall for granted. To most of Westeros, it really is an impenetrable force and most people can't even comprehend a situation where the Wall would come down. 

As readers/watchers, we know that the Wall would eventually come down. We've seen the white walkers, and because it's a fantasy story, we know that it will eventually end in a huge conflict. I knew that the Wall coming down was a big deal, but at the same time I knew it was coming, because that's where the story was headed. But ""in universe"", it's a _huge_ deal because people couldn't ever picture it coming down. It was just a really interesting moment that I wanted to share!",15,67,False,spoiler,,,,,

I think GoT works so well in some regards because we want, need, crave a hero of the story but we are never given one. All of the villains make us long for a hero but all of our heroes are chopped down or shown as flawed to some degree. This is the reverse of the well rounded villain who achieves redemption or has a slither of a good side underneath its the hero we want to root for but the harshness of Westeros shows every hero has a flaw, a dark side or a weakness.

To see our heroes as human with flaws, bad decisions and bad luck makes their triumph ultimately seem more real and more identifiable with

In essence it asks the question who is more heroic. The superhero or the Flawed Hero",10,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

After being declared The King in the North, what did Robb have to gain by fighting a war. What justification is there for not simply returning back to the North. There's virtually no risk of being attacked, as I don't think Tywin would be fool enough to cross the neck. And I don't think a northern Siege of King's Landing was ever in the cards so rescuing his sisters was never going to happen. In fact, I'd say his best chances for getting his sister's back would be to sue for peace with a hostage exchange. Sure the Lannisters wanted the North but especially in S2 with virtually no allies, I think giving up the north in exchange for Jaime and one less front to fight sounds like a pretty good shake.

Robb said at different times that it's not for revenge, glory, not want of the Iron Throne, so what then? Justice? OK maybe that's feasible at the start when all the major houses are aligned against the Lannisters. But how about after Robb fails to make any strong allies beyond the Tullys? When the Baratheons destroy themselves, the Tyrells switch sides, and the Ironborne attack their home? What the hell is he doing down there? Is it really just that he's so green that he thinks he can probably still handle the South because of his battle record? And that he cares about Justice so much he's determined to see this through?

Some justifications I can think of: (1) Maybe he stays fighting because he believes once he travels North and his bannerman return to their homes that it would be too difficult to unify them again when Tywin marches North? or (2) That his going North will separate him from the Tully portion of the army and they'll get wiped or never be able to join again? So essentially just fighting for the reason of keeping the army together? Does anyone have a better explanation? I really think when the Greyjoys attacked he should have rallied to the North as he stands to gain very little in the South at this point beyond protecting the Riverlands from The Mountain.",27,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

3. Emboldening the Greyjoy's invasion of the North by sending Theon, their hostage, as the envoy
4. Putting too much trust in the Boltons despite his mother's warnings
5. Losing much of his army by beheading Rickard Karstark
6. Allowing Jaime Lannister to escape multiple times (the books and shows have slightly different reasons why this happened and Cat's betrayal was somewhat unexpected despite her urging, but this should never have been allowed to happen as this prisoner was one of his biggest cards)
7. The lack of a stronger response to the Greyjoy's attack on his homelands (I suppose this coincides with #4)

Or did they just get to a stage where the army was big enough to start moving south?

-**Loras is the one who first suggests to Renly that he should be king.** Renly initially argues to him that hes 4th in line for the throne and has an older brother. Loras convinces him that this shouldnt stop him because he would be a good, fair ruler and he would be adored by his subjects.

-**Loras relationship with Renly resulted in the Renly/Margaery marriage.** Loras probably sold the idea to Mace that Margaery should marry Renly to support his claim to the throne, because if he was successful (very possible with the Tyrell support) she would be Queen. This would be best case scenario for Loras and Renly to be together, because Margaery knew of their relationship and was fine with being in a sham marriage considering it meant she got to be Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. Olenna disagreed but clearly the men got their way.

-**After Renly dies, Loras is heartbroken and joins the battle against Stannis - his lovers killer.** Stannis would have won the Battle of Blackwater if the Tyrells hadnt joined the Lannisters. This point alone alters the entire story:

* Northern rebellion dies down/ends, no Red Wedding, no more Stark death;

* Sansa probably allowed to go home, her life drastically improves;

* Arya eventually hears the war is over and makes her way home;

* Cersei and her children killed (Stannis probably kills Cersei and Joffrey Cersei would have already poisoned Tommen. Maybe Stannis lets Myrcella live/maybe not). However, maybe Jamie and/or Tyrion find a way to not get killed by some plot twist.

-All that aside, another Loras impact is that **the buzz of his marriage to Sansa results in the Lannisters marrying Sansa to Tyrion.** (I realize in the books its another Tyrell brother, but for the show, this applies). So if Loras wasnt going to marry Sansa, she might not have been forced into her marriage with Tyrion as a Lannister counter-move. And, her marriage to Tyrion linked her to the Joffrey murder, so everything about her escape might have gone down differently or not happened.

-Finally, **Loras homosexuality led to his, and then Margaerys arrests, which ends in their deaths** (and the annihilation of the entire Tyrell house), which results in Tommen killing himself, making Cersei Queen. The remainder of the impact of Cersei being Queen is still TBD.

I think it's pretty impressive and interesting for a relatively background character to have made such an unintentional impact over 6 seasons of the show.",47,77,False,spoiler,,,,,

The theory goes, that Bran accidentally became the Night King, trying to save the world from the White Walkers. He warged into the into the human who later will become the Night King, and due to the fact he's gone too far into the past, for too long, he's stuck there. The quote supporting that is It is beautiful beneath the sea, but if you stay too long, youll drown.

That's a really really basic overview of the theory, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/6vifi4/main_spoilers_the_brannk_theory_explained/) is a great post explaining the ins and outs of the theory, quotes included. BUT, I'm assuming you, the reader, know the theory in all it's entirety and I'm now going to address some of the main missing links from the theory!


MISSING LINK 1 - Why didn't Bran just kill himself when he became the Night King?

A quote from Meera in S4E2 says - Bran will ""forget what it's like to be human."" if he wargs too long. She goes further to say he'll forget his friends, family and Winterfell etc. The 3ER also seconds this, but with less detail. This could be what happened, Bran's mental state completely deteriorated when he became the NK, due to having warged too long, or the magic of becoming the NK corrupting his mind. 


The supporting evidence as to why the NK is Bran, is how the NK knew exactly where young Bran was going to be in one of the first visions, to mark him at exactly the correct time. Then another time, when the NK seemingly lets Jon Snow free at Hardhome. This could be the Bran in the NK being awakened slightly, causing inner conflict.


MISSING LINK 2 - ""The ink is dry"".


""The ink is dry"". The line from the 3ER that possibly corrupts this entire theory. The past cannot be changed, according the 3ER Number 1. However Bran is special. Bran isn't like Jojen or the 3ER. He's a warg AND a greensee-er. He turns Wyllis into Hodor and makes his father look at the tower of joy. It could be a point of interest.



I really only glossed over these because it's 1am and I'm excited. The Bran=NK theory could be complete BS. But I think it makes sense, and is a great plot twist. There's loads more hints and stuff that could explain it but I'm too tired to write them all, feel free to rip me to shreds in the comments, add more to the theory or just be your usual jolly selves.",20,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Fast forward to tonight...  I had watched S7E7, and was all lined up for the next big thing to come... What was going to happen next?

- Would they win the battle of Living v. Dead?
- What would the Lanister Queen do?  
- Would Sir. Jamie make it North ok?  
- Were the girls going to play a big role going forward?

So at the end of Season 6 Benjen told Bran that the Wall has powerful magic that prevents wights from coming across the wall, but Jon and co. brought a wight to King's Landing in S7 and the wight was perfectly fine south of the Wall, therefore we can probably assume that the magic wasn't like a invisible barrier like the one at 3er's cave that kills everything dead going through it. (or maybe Daenerys flying past the wall doesn't count as ""going through it"")

However, at the very end of S7 when the army of the dead finally reached the wall, and the night's watch and wildlings blew the horn three times, every single one of the wights stopped in place immediately after the third blast. If you look closely, not one of them moved at all until the night king emerged from the deep forest and melted down a huge chunk of the wall.

Therefore, I believe the wall's real magic was that three continual blasts of horns would freeze every wight that heard it. I mean, why else would the nights watch have a specific ancient rule to blow the horn 3 times for wights when 2 blasts serves an essentially same function as 3 blasts if not for the magical effect.

TLDR: The Wall's real power is that blowing the horn three times would freeze every single wight nearby that heard it. ",12,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

With that being said, 2 months prior to that would be December, and I cant think of a better day to release a trailer if not the first official trailer than December 21st, the first day of winter.

Is it because they're not the Valkyrian/Andals descendants (is it like their counterpart irl, French/Norman brought in those fancy names to Britain?) or what?

Prior to the Robert's Rebellion, what territory did Targaryen control? I know their castle was in Dragonstone but did they held any paramount lordship title? Like ""The Lord Paramount of Dragonstone"" or something?

If so, since Robert gave Dragonstone to Stannis, why did Robert not give the lordship title to Stannis? I know he was named ""The Lord of Dragonstone"", but it's not the same paramount title like those 6 titles I mentioned above.

Why the king title named as ""The King of the Andals and the First Men"" and not ""The King of the Seven Kingdoms""? 

We've got ""The King of the Andals and the First Men"" and ""The Lord of the Seven Kingdoms"" title, what's the difference between the king and the lordship title in this context? What does each of them represent? Which title is the more powerful one? 

When Ned Stark became the Hand of the King, did he give up his ""Warden of the North"", ""Lord Paramount of the North"", and ""Lord of Winterfell"" titles? 

Is ""Protector of the Realm"" the highest military/warden title?

Are warden and protector titles inferior to lord and king titles respectively?

Since the wardens are the military commander title, does it mean they are the true controller of an army?

Let say the Warden of the North and the Lord Paramount of the North title held by a different person, and then the warden ordered the army to kill the lord paramount and vice versa, which one should the army obey the most? The warden or the lord? 

If turned out that the one an army should obey the most is their warden (and not their lords), does the king have any legal right to stop their act? Does a king need the protector title to control the wardens and their army?

Or am I just exaggerating the warden titles?",5,6,False,spoiler,,,,,

As many are aware he was pressed to the fire like a nice mutton chop by his brother for playing with one of his toys. Since then he has feared fire, basically turns to mush when confronted with it. In the the most recent season he meets big bro again and tells him something along the lines of you know whats comming for you. Is it possible that the Hound has always been able to see things in fire? He does when Thoros convinces him to look into the fire, why all of a sudden can he have fire visions? Gonna go out on a limb here and say he may of always been able to; maybe the real reason his brother pushed his face into the fire was because he revealed to him what he saw in the fire about Gregor's future. Gregor gets pissed about it and pushes his face in, and or maybe the Hound saw his own death relating to firewhich adds to his fear whenever he sees it. Everytime he encounters fire he might be wondering if this is it. ",5,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

S7 hyped up a few of them, and I'm curious to see what other fights people are predicting will happen (and give reasoning for why you believe so).

So far, I've seen foreshadowing for:

1. Cleganebowl (This is obvious. The 30 second staredown at the end of S7 sealed the deal)

2. Theon and/or Yara Vs Euron (Theon is finally on the path to redeeming himself from Reek after the pep talk from John. He's directly going to save Yara, and Euron at this point represents all the fear and self pity he has for himself. Predicting one of them will die fighting him, while the other finishes him off).

Those are the only two that seem all but confirmed to happen, but there's a few others I could potentially see being interesting.

Jaime Vs Bronn could be interesting. Bronn still seems to be employed by Cersei, and Jaime having to fight the guy who trained him, as well as his best friend to truly break his loyalty to his family would be awesome.

The last one I could possibly see happening is Jorah Vs Daario, if the golden company theory is true. It's a longshot though.

Any other fights people would like to see in S8?",29,8,False,spoiler,,,,,

It could have two meanings

1. The usual literally meaning, that a winter season is coming. No question about this. But

2. I guess it can refer to a legend among starks communicated orally. A specific code. A form of prophetic story. 

There are few moments in the show, when the sentence ""winter is coming"" does not fully fit into the conversation. In S01E01: we have this conversation between Ned and Benjin

""Ned: the boy I beheaded, did you know him? Benjin: of course I did. Just a lad, but he was tough ..true ranger. N: he was talking maddness ... N: wildling ambush, B: maybe. Direwolves south of the wall, talk of walkers, my brother might be the next hand of the king.. winter is coming""

There are other moments too. But the above is the best.

This ""winter is coming"" doesn't fully fit in there. I smell that a legend is known to these starks which they heard in childhood: ""direwolf comes south, white walkers are seen, stark becomes the hand, ...""

That explains why Ned is extremely stressed in three moments: when he beheads the lad very quickly, when he sees the direwolf (his look at the man with white beard), when he is proposed to be the hand.

If you watch the show. And rewatch. Ned reactions to characters and events that become very important in later seasons are very stressed reactions. Mostly with one second pause of his face.

What I want to say is that (the exact sentence) ""winter is coming"" is a known code for a terrific story some of the starks knew (bran got close to hearing it from the old women). So some of the Starks knew what will happen, they just tried to postpone it....

Im an Industrial Design student and for my Visualization class we have to pick a fictional character, and design a modern day object that would be useful for them in their story. The brief  is Unlikely Product; Specific User. 

 I wanted to pick someone from GOT, particularly Ned Stark or Jon Snow. Does anyone have any suggestions? Im focusing on problems they face, or hidden problems they might face that affect aspects of their life like fitness, nutrition, transportation, etc.

One example my profesor used was designing a coffee maker for Batman. Since Batman is always on the go and rarely gets any sleep. Any suggestions would be appreacited! Lol thank youu 

EDIT: Thank you for all the replies so far, but I realize I was not clear enough. This should be a product that would be useful to the character, but be something you wouldnt expect them to have/use. An unlikely user.",24,7,False,self,,,,,

This scene had such an impact on me. It was truly a well written scene that revealed so much about both Cersei's and Robert's character in just under 3 minutes.

The best part is when Cersei asks, ""Was there ever a time?"" And then, Robert just sternly says ""No."" That exchange in itself shows just how off their relationship was.

This scene also showed that Cersei had a soft side for Robert. She honestly wished that there could have been something between them. She wanted him to love him at a time.

Robert also mentions that he can't even remember what Lyanna looked like. He said she was the one thing he ever wanted, and she's gone. This shows that even lazy, old Robert had something he would fight for. Now that that something is gone, he doesn't care to fight for anyone or anything truly.

If he had been patient enough to get the Dothraki army, I imagine that he would have not waited long before invading Westeros. He would have probably come over around late Clash of Kings/early Storm of Swords era of the books, where the Lannisters were really at their strongest. They have the support of the Tyrells, and while they would have still needed to control Joffrey, they would have both Cersei and Tywin to strong arm him into behaving how they feel he should.

But if I recall, didn't Dorne have some sort of standing offer in support of the Targaryens? Oberyn still wanted revenge for his sister, so he could have been a very valuable asset to aiding Viserys.

In the end, I don't think that Viserys would have conquered everything, but he definitely would have fucked some shit up. I think that of Tywin was still in charge of the armies, that he was far more intelligent and battle minded than Viserys was, so he would have eventually won the war, but depending on how much support that Viserys was able to muster, they might have been able to make some strides. I should note that this is assuming that the dragon eggs never hatched. I don't see Viserys letting Dany near the eggs, so she would have never taken them into the fire and hatched them.

Why not Arya?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/7rxv1h/everything_who_would_you_want_to_fight_for_you_in/,ascenator,1516543782,"I have heard many people saying Jaime Lennister (two-handed), Brienne, Barristan Selmy (younger version?!), Arthur Dayne or sometimes Jon Snow / Oberyn Martell / Khal Drogo. While all of them are very skilled fighters, Oberyn and Drogo are people who like to show off and thus are likely to lose against very focussed fighters abusing this weakness. Arthur Dayne, Jon Snow, Barristan Selmy and Brienne are very honorful fighters, thus might die against tricky, sneaky enemies that only care for the win and nothing else. Since Jaime was very impressed by Brienne's skills I think Jaime (two-handed), although a very good choice, might not be the fastest / strongest fighter also.
Additionally, *at least* Jaime, Brienne (for example vs. Arya) and Arthur Dayne (expecting always to win and then simply get backstabbed) are likely to underestimate the situation and/or enemy.

This leaves me with the (obvious?) question: why not selecting Arya for a trial by combat?

When it comes to enemies Arya is a pretty ruthless fighter. Everyone strongly underestimates her skills. Additionally, she does not fight with a traditional style, but in a combo of patient, swift and fast movements, only attacking/striking or even investing energy when the outcome is worth it. Furthermore she mixes in her assassin skills. She is ultra focused and does not seem to ever underestimate her opponent or even try to show off. Always fights with patience and skill, just the win in mind.

With that attitude, although she probably is not the most skilled fighter (by now / at that age), she sounds like a very reasonable choice for me, because almost all  enemies will underestimate her (like Brienne did) and even with Brienne acknowledging Arya's skills and fighting serious from that point on, Arya was capable of achieving a draw (Season 7). I think anyone below Brienne's level would be dead in a matter of seconds and even Brienne's level and above (which are probably just a handful of people in total) would have a hard time against Arya or also end up dead early on if they underestimate her.

What do you think?

I do not understand why Arya pretty much never gets mentioned when people think of a trial by combat. Even GRRM said something like Jaime Lennister (two-handed), Brienne or Arthur Dayne when asked who he wants to fight for him.

Am I overestimating Arya's skills?",63,17,False,spoiler,,,,,

- Get the best spear thrower/throwers to ride with Daenerys when taking on the Night King's dragon, or perhaps mount a scorpion on Drogon (does not have to as large, there will be close combat between the dragons)

&gt;The kings seat sat empty at the head of the table, the crowned stag of Baratheon embroidered in gold thread on its pillows. Ned took the chair beside it, as the right hand of his king. My lords, he said formally, I am sorry to have kept you waiting.

&gt;You are the Kings Hand, Varys said. We serve at your pleasure, Lord Stark.

&gt;As the others took their accustomed seats, it struck Eddard Stark forcefully that he did not belong here, in this room, with these men. He remembered what Robert had told him in the crypts below Winterfell. I am surrounded by **flatterers and fools,** the king had insisted. Ned looked down the council table and wondered which were the flatterers and which the fools. He thought he knew already. We are but five, he pointed out.

I couldn't help but laugh a little after reading this. We now know better, there is no fool on that small council. Robert considers them fools, and Ned, a man who shares the same mindset of Robert, agrees with him.

By the time we reach the end of the first book, Robert had gotten himself killed while drunkenly hunting for a boar. His death a product of his negligence, as he decided to hunt instead of resolving the issues between the Starks and the Lannisters. Which involved a Lannister kidnapped by a Stark and a Stark injured by a Lannister. But hey, hunting is more important right? 

Despite Joffrey being the one who killed Ned, it was Cersei who got him. What is impressive is that Ned was warned more than once of what Cersei was capable, by both Varys and Renly, *the men he considered fools.* Ned ignored them, got himself killed, and his own family and the kingdom suffered greatly because of it.

Every single person on that council, save for Ned and his King, *survived the first book.*

I get the impression that the Unsullied are loyal because they appreciate what Dany did for them, are grateful/indebted to her, and would do anything for her.  I get the feeling the Dothraki are only there because they were in awe of Dany's power and had something to gain. (look at how quickly they abandoned previous Khals when the Alpha Male no longer provided)  

Facing the WW risks a lot, and beating the WW gains them nothing--no land, women, money, horses...so how would she keep the Dothraki motivated?  Am I just missing the bond of loyalty that the show tried to portray?  Is glory in battle really enough for them?

Just curious on people's thoughts, especially if there's something in the books I'm missing (haven't read them).",21,10,False,spoiler,,,,,

Argument for Jorah Mormont: He would take the same position that was held by his late father, Jeor Mormont. He would continue the legacy the of watching the realms of men. Just as Jeor joined the Watch when he realized Jorah should use have his time to lead, Jorah could see the future of his house is in strong, capabale by hand in the young Lyanna Mormont. We also saw him admit his guilt and say that Ned Stark was right in trying to take his head after he sold the poachers into slavery. As we know, joining the Watch would grant him a pardon for those crimes. 


Arguments for Jaime: All along the we have heard that the only woman Jaime loves is his Cersei, and now that he has left her this would be a reason to never lay with another woman again. Also, in the only interaction weve seen between Jaime and Jon Snow Jaime mocks his choice of joining the Watch. It would also be one last twist of the knife in the late Tywin Lannister who was deadset on relieving his treasured son from his Kings Guard vows so he could take over as his heir. Now that Jaime has left he could join the Nights Watch and fully remove himself from his fathers legacy. He also said he meant to keep his promise in fighting the Night King. That could possibly mean he takes the black even if they win the War for the Dawn. 


I think either of these men taking over the position could be a fitting end to their story arcs. What do you think? ",29,18,False,spoiler,,,,,

I understand that Stannis is a mutual enemy of the Lannisters and the Tyrells, but the Tyrells previously declared for Renly and supported his claim to the throne. It seems like Joffrey, Cersei, Tywin, and the others just forgot about the Tyrell's treason.

I understand that there are some advantages to allying themselves with the Tyrells, so I guess I'm just more annoyed that they didn't mention it at all, like nothing ever happened. At least I don't think they mentioned it. It seems more believable that Cersei, Tywin, or Joffrey would have them killed at first sight for supporting Renly and then a Tyrell cousin would take over the Reach, and that would have made things interesting.",10,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

This time I will have more evidence and I will also includes elements of a amazing theory I heard that the story of GOT takes inspiration from Norse Mythology mainly the story of Ragnarok. There are many parallels to Norse Mythology and Ragnarok in the story but today I will be mainly focusing on two Jaime and Bran.

I will also be explaining why I believe Jaime is Azor Ahai. So I will get to the evidence of why Jaime, one of the most complex characters in the series is the Prince that was Promised/Azor Ahai Reborn.

Evidence:

- Red star bleeding I think refers to either the Red Comet or the destruction of the sept as the Faith of the seven symbol is a red star. In the books case it could refer to the death of Oberyn as he is from House Martell and the sigil of House Martell is a red sun and spear which can be seen as a red star bleeding.

- Now being reborn admits salt and smoke can refer to anything, It could refer to when Jaime got his hand cut off as there was a fire set up there (fire as in campfire) which gives off smoke with the salt being Jaime's salty sweat or tears. It can refer to his bath where he stats he is Jaime (the smoke is the steam from the bath and the salt the water), it could refer to Field of fire 2.0 with the smoke from the flames and Jaime going into salty water, or maybe it will be a event that has not happen yet like maybe when Jaime confronts Cersei again he is killed but later resurrected by a red Priest on a funeral pyre near blackwater bay (I think it's obvious what the salt and smoke would be there), However in Alt Shift X's vid on Jaime he stats Jaime could be resurrected when the wildfire goes off in the red keep coming out unburnt. Whatever one is the salt and smoke he could fulfill or has already fulfilled this part of the prophecy.

- Now I do believe that Jaime is the bastard of the Mad King so that solves the blood of the dragon part.

- Some believe Jaime's hand is Lightbringer or Widow's wail is Lightbringer but I believe Ice will be reforged and in a poetic act a reforged Ice will be his Lightbringer. Or maybe Widow's Wail will.

- Of course Cersei is Nissa Nissa, and before you start YES I am aware Valonqar is not mentioned in the show but just because it was not does not mean Jaime will not kill Cersei.

- Also if we look at Jaime's Journey it fits with Azor Ahai. Azor Ahai first tempered his blade in water but it broke, then he tried again this time plunging the sword into the heart of a captive lion but the steel shattered again, Then finally with all his heart he made the blade again and tempered it into the heart of his beloved wife Nissa Nissa. Now in the books it may be different as the water could be Lady Stoneheart, The Lion could be Cersei or Tyrion, and Nissa Nissa is Cersei or Brienne. For the Show the water was when he told Brienne the truth in the bath, The Lion is when he helped Tyrion escape, and Nissa Nissa is not only when he left Cersei but when he will return and kill her.

Now I will get to how it relates to Ragnarok. So there are actually some parallel between GOT and the story of Ragnarok. I will not go into too much detail but I would recommend watching these two youtube videos as they are really good and give good analysis on the theory:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geqbQyx2Nug&amp;t=2105s

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4vG28iFpgg

I'd also recommend reading this:

http://gameofthronesandnorsemythology.blogspot.ca/2013/05/jaime-azor-ahai-god-of-war.html

So as I was saying there are some parallels. These include that the Mad King is Odin, Robert Baratheon is Thor, Cersei is either Frigg or Hela, in my opinion Euron is Satur (and I may make a separate post on why I think that), Jaime is Tyr, and Bran is Fenrir. Now in the legend Fenrir was chained to the earth by Tyr, this pretty much made him angry so be bit Tyr's hand off. Jaime pushed Bran out of the tower pretty much in a sense chaining him to the earth and while Bran did not bit Jaime's hand off Jaime did get his hand cut off. Now this is where the theory gets interesting because if this is correct then I think sense Fenrir was a dark character in Norse Mythology then Bran could become a villain near the end with Jaime of course as Azor Ahai.

The reason for this is because in the books Bran is pretty much told be the three Eyed Raven to go into the darkness and even has him drink a paste that may or may not be Jojen Reed. Now in the show I think it may have to be something different like maybe the Bran=Night King theory ends up being true or more likely Bran is captured by the Night King and is turned into a White Walker. But what evidence do I have for this...well not too much but enough:

1. Bran is being setup as a dark character in the books there is what I just mentioned and he has been acting alittle off in the show not to mention kindof creepy. While Jaime has pretty much been redeemed

2. It's obvious Jaime and Bran will meet again but Jaime I think will apologize to Bran which I think would make it harder for Jaime to have to stop him when Bran goes rouge.

3. Maisie Williams the actress who plays Arya stark stated that the ending will be something we don't expect. Yes we should never take what actors or actresses say as actual evidence (especially when this is the same person who claims to love Pepperoni and Cheese Pizza and yet in one interview I saw she says she does NOT eat dairy so...yeah who knows. also sorry for getting off topic) but she did read the script so she may be telling the truth. Jaime being Azor Ahai and Bran being the villain in the end would be a good twist.

4. It's been said there are three twist from the books that will happen in the show. So far those twist from what I understand are either Shireen's burning or Jon's resurrection and Hold the Door (Jon's parentage reveal does not count as we all saw that coming). The third twist could revolve around Jaime being Azor Ahai.

So too recap I believe that Jaime could be Azor Ahai and if the Ragnarok theory is true then Bran in the books could go dark from BloodRaven's influence and in the show could be turned into a White Walker by the Night King. Jaime would kill Cersei to forge Lightbringer and will drive back the darkness and be forced to kill Bran and the NK in order to save everyone. Bittersweet Ending.",15,9,False,spoiler,,,,,

I'm a pretty picky reader... I love SF and fantasy when I can get into it, but a lot of the time I read the first page and feel that it's just not *well-written* enough. Tolkien, Le Guin, Gene Wolfe always pass my tests... I wish more did. :(

Anyway, *A Game of Thrones* passed with flying colors. I absolutely loved it, cover to cover. But I'm 100 pages into *A Clash of Kings*, and it feels of much lower quality. The writing strikes me as clumsy; there's a lot of unnecessary obvious statements, often coming from characters' thoughts; the dealings at Dragonstone (prelude and the first Davos section) feel so obvious and heavy-handed.

So did the quality of writing drop off? Is there any conventional wisdom on this, like does the quality generally get worse over the series, or does it peak somewhere and then get worse? (I'm talking mostly about atmosphere and writing style, not plot or whether things are dragging.) I'm trying to decide whether to go on. The first book cast such a spell on me, and I'm worried the spell is breaking...

Any opinions or observations (spoiler-free, please!) are highly welcome!",12,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Now I have left the link to where I found the theory up top and to be honest I like parts of it but idk it seems like a short amount of time to get married and conceive a kid, also for this to work I think it would've had to have been a secret marriage and they would have to fake Ashara's suicide somehow.",10,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

BUT... the release of the white ravens also happens in season 6 ep 10, there's a scene of a bunch of them flying from the citadel and sansa is telling Jon about them and that winter is here.

My initial response to this was to believe that this meant that the City Watch of King's Landing would protect Ned Stark against the Lannisters. However, upon analyzing this statement I now realize that it was an early warning of Janos Slynt's betrayal of Ned. The one word that hints at this is *behind*. If Janos Slynt had said ""the men of the watch stand *with* you"" then that would have been better. The fact that he said *behind you* technically meant that they hadn't pledged to protect him and therefore the statement left the option of betrayal open.  ",3,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

At the beginning of season 7, would he be the great Lord of House Lannister? 

His father Tywin, the former lord of house Lannister passed away a couple of seasons ago when he was shot by Tyrion. If I remember correctly the title couldn't pass to Jamie at the time, because he was a member of the Kingsguard. But since King Tommen removed Jamie from the Kingsguard in season 6 (in response to Jamie marching against the Faith Militant), that obstacle no longer applied.

Obviously as of the end of season 7 the question is kind of moot. But I thought it was interesting to ask, and can't remember if the show confirms it- was our favourite golden-haired one-handed sister-shagging dragon-charging quipmaster briefly known as 'Lord Jamie of House Lannister?'",14,7,False,spoiler,,,,,

And please note, I have only read one of the chapters of The Winds of Winter as it appears at the end of the other books in the Kindle series, so I may be missing some bits that have been already published

Anyway, moving on:

So, we know that GRRM gave D&amp;D the ending of the saga so they could get on with the TV series, and we also know that there are things missing and changed between the actual book story and the TV series. Here are my questions

a)How much of the omitted work is because of cost?

b) If something is omitted, can we assume that it has no bearing on the overall story as it works out?

c) Can we work out some of the things that will happen in the next book given what has been happening in the TV series?

If the answer is b- that things are omitted because they have no overall bearing on the story, does this mean that as book readers we can ignore the Young Griff/Aeron Targaryen story? If this is the case, then we know that he is not going to be the heir to the throne, as he would be Jons older brother if he was the real one, and integral to the succession in the TV stories as well as the books. In this case, we can possibly extrapolate that he will die in the books, and therefore play no part other than narrative expansion on the part of GRRM.

We can also say that Dorne is unimportant in the grand scheme of things, since the Dorne arc has been seriously played down through the whole TV series, despite the major parts it plays in the books. We saw Myrcella poisoned in the series, however in the books, she has an ear sliced off and her face disfigured by Darkstar before she is sent on her way home. So far, she is still alive, but can we assume that she will die before reaching Kings Landing, because she has already been killed in the series?

The same can be asked about Shireen Baratheon: In the series, she was burned by her father and mother as a sacrifice to RHillor, however in the books, she is still alive at the Wall. We do however have Val saying that she is a dead girl walking because of the Greyscale, despite her supposedly being cured of it as a child, and Val wants the Monster (Gillys baby) out of the same tower that Shireen lives in. In the books, Ramsey has also written to Jon Snow telling him Stannis is dead, so Stannis wouldnt be around to sacrifice Shireen. Selyse is also alive, but in the series, she hangs herself after the burning of her daughter. Given that they are all dead in the series, but only Stannis is dead in the books, can we assume that an end will come for Selyse and Shireen, and them be irrelevant to the main story in the next book?

Similarly, I have seen a lot of theories about Patchface, Shireens fool, and how he is all sorts of different characters. Given that he doesnt even appear in the TV series, can we write off all these theories as being fanciful, as he obviously has no part to play in the finale of the main story? All the theories Ive seen make him a central character of some sort, and occasionally Ive seen comments that he could be a god, father of the NK and all sorts.

Going on to other differences, we have the two babies, Dallas and Gillys, and someone did say that GRRM never really wrote anything without a purpose, so there must be some sort of story for them, although its not played out in the the TV series.

One other major difference is the Hound: In the books, Sandor Clegane is dead (or possibly retired to the Quiet Isle), but the Hound (as a helmeted man) lives on and is doing all sorts of bad things, last heard of as Rorge who bit part of Briennes cheek off, then passing to Lem Lemoncloak. Given that premise, I wonder why he is still alive in the series, and the only thing I can figure out is that they kept him because hes a popular character who says cunt a lot, and theyre working up to a major fight with his brother, the stiff.

There are a lot of things that can be extrapolated from the omissions from the TV series as to what will follow in tWoW, but these are some of the few that stick out as being important differences and extrapolations, and indeed spoilers for the book, although we dont know how some will play out.

I for one will be interested to find out what happens to Shireen, since shes a likeable character in both mediums, and the comments from Val about the greyscale are intriguing. I really wish GRRM would get the book out instead of publishing excerpts in bits and pieces, like breadcrumbs to appease the starving masses though. What do other people think though- will the books and TV marry up in the end, or are they going to be vaguely similar, but not quite? Or something else entirely?

1958,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-1-25,2018,1,25,6,7sqf45,self.gameofthrones,[MAIN SPOILERS] Why is Ice so much bigger than other valyrian swords?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/7sqf45/main_spoilers_why_is_ice_so_much_bigger_than/,CaptainCarten,1516828195,"I have for a long time wondered why the Starks sword Ice so much bigger than all the other valyrian sword. Valyrian swords are expensive and rare but Ice is so big that it could melted into two, so one can be quite sure it's a very special sword. 

So why is it so big? What is the reason that the biggest valyrian sword is located in the North? It has been in Starks possession for centuries and I think that is there for a reason. 

One might think with all the history and tales of the North that the Starks needed a bigger sword for killing giants and what not living beyond the wall, but I have also read the comments on that Ice being to big to wield in actual combat. Ice being to big in man on man combat might be true, but what if Ice is not meant to be used for killing men? Surely there must be a reason that a sword is made that big? Well my theory is that Ice is a sword for killing dragons and I'll try to give an explanation for my wild theory.

First of all the NK was not that surprised that three dragons showed up to save Jon and his gang. My guess is that it wasn't the first time he came into contact with dragons, almost logical to think that he might have owned owned a ice dragon before. He was at least quite aware of them being around..

With the prophecy of hero reborn (AA) that once before won the fight against the NK after wielding Lightbringer. To my knowledge this fight ended at Winterfell, thus the name Winterfell.. 

Some say that Ice can't be Lightbringer because it is not old enough with it being forged in ancient valyria after the Long Night took place and after The Wall was built. Well I'm not that concerned about the historical details, not everything is that black on white in Westeros history. 

Well back to Ice being Lightbringer. If AA fought and defeated NK and the battle was won at Winterfell, wouldnt it be quite possibel that Ice would be left there? 

If you now take into consideration that Jaime is heading North with Widows wail, Brienne already on her way North with Oathkeeper, Gendry being a blacksmith and all also currently in the North. Taking all these things into consideration there must be a reason for this team up, there simply must be a reason for it and in my opinion there can't be any other than that Ice must be reforged. In my opionion there are very few alternatives that could end up being LB, I have read all the theorys about dragons, Jamie's hand etc. being LB but I personally think that Jaimes hand being LB would be quite lame. Would he use it to strangle NK or how would it work? I don't know, but I'm not convinced.

So why is Ice made for killing dragons? Well if you think about it, how could Jon and Dany actually kill an Ice dragon? Well if they risk it all and go up for a dragon fight in the skies they risk loosing another dragon thus giving NK two dragons and the chance of winning the war would be reduced to none. And to be fair, why would the series end with two dragons taking down the Ice dragon, seems a bit to obvious? This is why Ice has to be reforged imo. They will need a sword (Ice) big enough to kill (behead) the dragon with a single blow. I'm not saying there won't be a dragon fight, but I don't think the war will end by danys dragon killing the ice dragon in a dog fight. 

If I were to guess I think Ice will be reforged either because Brienne and Jaime thinks it's the right thing to do (knights honor) or Sam finds a text in his book revealing Ice history and importance in killing (ice)dragons.

So what do you guys think, is this to much of a tinfoil theory? I might have got some details wrong and only sharing this because I'm a big fan of the show and my intention is not to offend anyone. Cheers!",44,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

With all the theories that come up with ASOIAF Im surprised Ive never seen this come up as it fans tend to find clues in a lot more cryptic circumstances.

It comes in Aryas first POV chapter in A Game Of Thrones when Jon and Arya are talking about Aryas hate Of needlework as they watch the Lannister children spar with the other Stark children. 

The longer you hide, the sterner the penance. Youll be sewing all through Winter. When the Spring thaw comes, they will find your body with a needle still locked tight between your frozen fingers.

In regards to the hiding part, this is something Ive only just realised now while checking the exact quote for this post. This could be a reference to Arya hiding by using other peoples appearances as a Faceless Man, with the reference to penance meaning her association with the Faceless Men will lead to her downfall. 

I think the other hints at her demise are a lot more obvious. Jon talking about her being found dead in Winter with a needle in her hands obviously refers to her sword named needle, and being found in Winter is likely referring to the coming war with The Others.

If the show has accurately portrayed the events of The Winds Of Winter, Id like to see Aryas death happen in the defence of Winterfell during a great battle with The Others that we will hopefully see during Season 8.

Little is known about what fans can expect from the popular fantasy series, which is not scheduled to return to HBO until sometime in 2019.

Based on the Song Of Ice And Fire saga by author George R. R. Martin, Game of Thrones has proven a surprising hit for HBO since it first premiered in 2011. A rare critical and commercial success for a show set in the sword-and-sorcery genre, the series has won 38 Emmy Awards including two consecutive wins for Outstanding Drama Series in 2015 and 2016. Among other honors, the show has won three Hugo Awards for Best Dramatic Presentation and a 2011 Peabody Award.

The rumor was first reported as a Blind Item on TVLines website. Without naming Game of Thrones specifically, the site claimed to have confirmed that a wildly popular, Emmy-winning series on a premium cable network is plotting a pregnancy twist that promises to be surprising is an understatement. The report also said that this series was not planned to return until 2019. Game of Thrones would certainly fit the bill on both counts. The questions remains, however, as to which two characters are involved in the pregnancy and what would constitute this turn of events being so shocking as to render the word surprising an understatement?

I think theres plenty of evidence out there that connects him to the prophecy, but I got to thinking about something that I dont see mentioned that often. Melisandra first thought that Stanis was the prince that was promised, and then John, but what if the flames and visions were showing her Davos all along? Davos was there both with Stanis and John, but she would have completely overlooked him because hes just a simple common man in her mind.

So if your army pushes them back the NK can't just leave, re arm off a few un/ lightly protected cities. I'd send word for anyone capable to retreat to these locations; 1. Dorne. Anybody from lands south of King's landing ie the Stormlands and the reach should bring their people to Dorne. The mountain pass acts similarly to the Neck in the north in that it's easily defendable. 2. Harrenhall. For the rest of Westeros, that doesn't have the natural protection of Puke/ the Vale, running all the way to Dorne would be a long trip in the summer. Harrenhall is a massive castle conveniently located in the dead center of Westeros. Men from all over could flock to Harrenhall, unlike other more easily defended smaller castles like the Eerie or Storm's end.

At this point you know the final battle will be humanity's final stand. You throw everything at the NK to try and kill the head. A shield wall composed of unsullied and Westerosi knights protect the main gate, baiting the NK's army against the walls of Harrenhall where militia will rain down arrow fire from the battlements. Also use any wildfire you can get your hands on from King's landing (where I'm assuming if I'm Tyrion that Cersei is still making the stuff after you find out she's not on your side), Ballistas to shoot at the NK's dragon and any other tricks like Lava pots you can think up. Viseryon's flames hopefully keep the NK from roasting the castle, especially if it's being controlled by warg Bran.

 As this happen you have to launch your Gandalf charge. The Dothraki and riders of the Vale charge from a hidden location on the frozen God's eye, led by a vanguard of Drogon/ Dany, Jon and EVERY knight with a Valyrian steel blade you can get your hand on. This includes all your living major characters; Jon, Jaime (or whoever takes his sword if he dies killing Cersei), Brienne, Beric (your red shirt), Arya and whoever Sam gives Heartsbane to (preferrably Jorah).

I've never watched Game of Thrones, I started watching it in 2017, don't know why I waited this long to do so. Is fucking good. I was the one asking a month ago about how Danery's was immune to fire, and how the many face man was captured when he was a pro. I almost got a mini heart attack when I saw the fake him die. I hope he is alive, whoever he is. Cersei Lannister got watch she deserved. Too bad she isn't dead, yet. What happened to Myrcella Baratheon was sad. She didn't deserve to die. Poor, Jaime Lannister after one of his children accepted him. I know that he crippled Brandon Stark, but all the same, I've forgiven him. I just like him ...don't know why.  I hope Stannis Baratheon burns in hell for killing Shireen, and that Melisandre will burn in the seven hells for this. Well, Jon snow isn't dead or is he? I know he comes back in Season 6. Damn, spoilers. I also knew that he is related to the Mother of Dragons because of people talking about spoilers everywhere I go.

I'm just going to finish the next two remaining seasons. Also, can someone explain to me how the many face man works? lol I don't understand his ""magic"" face swap.

* ~~A dragon dies and turns into a white walker.~~

* ~~The Night King destroys the wall with his Ice Dragon.~~

* ~~Petyr Baelish is killed by Arya and Sansa.~~

* ~~Jon Snow comes back to life somehow because he is Aegon Targaryen. Whatever that means. His father is a Targaryen.~~

I am planning on making a character tournament for r/gameofthrones. It will include 128 of the most memorable GoT characters. Each match, 2 characters will be randomly selected and you guys will vote for your favorite. Whoever wins will move on to the next round.

I have most of it planned out. A random number generator was used to determine the matches. There's just 1 question left. How will the winner be determined for each match?

Option 1: Whoever received the most votes wins.

Option 2: The percentage of votes received would equal the probability of that character winning. (Example: if a character received 75% of the total votes, they would have a 75% chance of winning.) A random number generator would be used to decide this. 1-75=win, 76-100=loss.

If I understand right, based off Varys and Illyrios walk 'n' talk in the dungeons, Varys was loyal to the Targaeryns, and trying to keep the realm stable while the Targ's grew up and gained power for a long term invasion. With that in mind, why did he provide King Robert with Intel about Dany's pregnancy and endorse her assassination? I know he would have to play the 'role' of the loyal spymaster and therefore couldn't give obviously bad advice, but as this news came from Ser Jorah who I believe was reporting to Varys directly, couldn't Varys have just covered this piece of intel up?

2. Littlefingers strategy was to start a chaotic war with the intent of taking advantage of it to gain power for himself. To do this he pitted the Starks and Lannisters against each other in a plot that required Ned and Cat to play into his hands in ways that weren't guaranteed to happen. Yes, their behaviour was predictable, but not guaranteed. If littlefinger was wanting to cause chaos and was sitting on information regarding the bastard Baratheon children, why didn't he simply reveal that information to King Robert to instigate a Baratheon-Lannister war instead of the more complex plan to instigate a Lannister-Stark Civil War?",8,6,False,spoiler,,,,,

2251,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-1-28,2018,1,28,12,7thrfn,self.gameofthrones,[Everything] Cersei end of season 7,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/7thrfn/everything_cersei_end_of_season_7/,MagratM,1517109278,"Cersei is claiming to be pregnant again by Jamie, however I am very dubious about whether she is or not. The reasons I feel this are as follows:

First of all, the prophecy, which says she will only have three children, gold their crowns and gold their shrouds. I know she told Catelyn about the black haired baby, but in the books, she actually had an abortion, acquired by Jaime, on the only occasion that she became pregnant by Robert.

On the other hand, the pregnancy could always not go to term, still fulfilling the three children aspect of the prophecy, especially if it happens very early on.

Secondly, given the number of times she and Jaime had sex, and only three children being born, it makes me wonder about her fertility. Tommen was 9 in the books, and older if the TV series is to be used as evidence. Joffrey was 14, and Myrcella was a year older than Tommen, so there were 5 years between the three children. If you add in to that the amount that Cersei was drinking, the stress in her life, as well as the poor diet during her imprisonment in the Sept, its entirely possible that she is merely having irregular periods that she is interpreting as pregnancy. Even a hangover could be mistaken as morning sickness.

The period of time and the technology at hand is pretty much similar to the medieval period of Britain, and there werent any reliable pregnancy tests around at that time. Any missing periods could be seen as pregnancy, and quite famously, Mary Tudor had false pregnancies, one of which may well have been a tumour that eventually killed her. She had at least one period of lying in, when she was due, but no baby was born, and she eventually had to come out of her chambers as childless as she went in.

There is also the possibility of a phantom pregnancy. We already know that she has mental health problems because she suffers badly from paranoia, and having lost three children in pretty quick succession (one of which was directly caused by her actions, although she chooses to blame Tyrion instead), I would assume she is suffering from depression as well. It could be that she is so desperate to be pregnant that her body is giving all the signs without her actually carrying a child.

Finally, she seems to fear she is losing Jaimes loyalty, as he has drawn back from her more than once, and while she was a prisoner of the High Sparrow, she messaged Jaime telling him to come at once, which he didnt. Her paranoia will see him as possibly turning against her as so many others have already, and the news of another child could just be a way to try to bind him to her side. We know she is not above lying to get her own way, and this could just be another example of that.

I dont know really. Is she pregnant? Is she faking it, knowingly or unknowingly? Could it be that shes just mistaken because her periods are out of whack because of her lifestyle and incarceration? Could it be a deliberate lie, and the last straw that will see Jaime snap and kill her when he finds out about her duplicity, thus completing the prophecy about the Valonquar?

Personally Im leaning towards her not being pregnant, but thinking she is, but continuing the lie to Jaime once she discovers the truth, then him finding out. Anyone else have any thoughts?

When Robert dies and gives his will to Ned, how the fuck was Cersei allowed to just straight up ignore it and tear it up? Robert clearly signed off on it, and the Baratheon seal was unbroken. Ned was supposed to be protector of the realm and serve as temp king till Joffrey came of age. Even though Ned wrote rightful heir instead of Joffrey specifically, he hadnt made any indication yet that he was pulling for Stannis, so nobody should have questioned anything.

I just dont understand how Cersei and Joffrey just instantly have complete power over Ned and could do literally whatever they wanted the second Robert died, even when Robert himself had a plan laid out that went against their motives.

I remember being excited to see this story unfold. However in season 7 Arya does what everyone wants and crosses off the names on her list, which leaves the west of Westeros story by the wayside.

But hes also in his late 60s and who knows how much creative time he has left. The series has a large devoted following and after 6 more episodes its over; there may be some prequels, but thats it as far as we know. The issue I see is there is so much potential to take the story in so many different directions with so many characters (past and present), and so many places and story lines. And of course this thing can be a gold mine financially if they dont fuck it up. So if grrm is not interested or is no longer around, you would think somebody has plans to buy the rights to create and tell these stories.

I think this is the reason that their meeting outside Riverrun last season was so significant, it hinted that he loved her (and it's pretty clear he doesn't have any love towards Cersei anymore).

  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47MazYDnmaU

I've always been the best employee at my job with Tim Hortons, super skilled at everything I do, but for years I never really took myself or the job seriously. I was in my early 20s when I started, now I'm 30. About half a year ago the manager quit with rather short notice, creating a power vacuum in the restaurant. Around this time the store owner approached me and we had a bit of a discussion about the future of this business, and how much potential he thinks I have. Basically telling me now is the time to step up, used the specific words that I need to ""be the man I was always meant to be"".

Really reminded me of this scene, but it really did strike true, I was ready to start growing up finally and that was a big trigger for me. I was triple promoted within two months as the store manager, which is actually a pretty decently paying gig, so that's cool.

Oddly enough, as similar as those words were to Tywin's, he's never watched Game of Thrones.",3,6,False,spoiler,,,,,

From time to time I stumble over some things, that after the final episode of Season 6/7, can be seen as massive hints by GRRM about John Snows lineage. 

Just now Ive read this part: (spoken by John)
Mances blood is no more royal than mine own. He has never worn a crown nor sat a throne. Hes a brigand, nothing more. Theres no power in brigands blood.
The raven looked up from the floor. Blood, it screamed.
Jon paid no mind. 

First, him talking about how he has no royal blood and than the raven saying :blood. 

Again and again GRRM throws these hints in between and literally slams us in the face with them. 

But we only see the real meaning much much later.


Sorry if this was posted before, but I wanted to get it out there.

But shouldn't we have had a bit of info on him and his family? Is he still at the Twins or did the Lannisters take him with them? Did Arya know where he was when she killed all the Freys (literally all the male heirs)? Did Edmure starve to death in a cell because no one remembered about him or what?

I would have loved a scene, a short one, where ""someone"" kills Edmure's prison guard(s) and breaks him free, leaving him asking himself who that was.

Also, what about Roslin? What about their child? She's one of the few surviving heirs to House Frey and their child is the legitimate heir to House Tully and... rightful ruler of Riverrun and the Trident?

Even if Edmure couldn't claim those (let's say the Freys have a right of conquest), would Roslin and Edmure's child inherit them from grandpa Walder? Or is there any child before him in the line?

So many unanswered questions, and this is about one of the major 9 houses (Tully) and one of the most important ones in Westeros (Frey). They could have included just a few mentions about the whole thing in S7.",30,27,False,spoiler,,,,,

He was also burnt by fire as a child (smoke) which is a defining trait of his. As far as the lion goes, he served The Lannisters for a long time and had plenty of chances to kill Jophery, but he didn't. This could symbolize his failure to create the weapon by stabbing the Lion in the heart. Or possibly abandoning the Lannister's after The Battle of Black water.

In this one I will be discussing Jon and Euron's role in the theory, Clear up some feedback I got from the first part, and give you my theory on Jon and Jaime both being Azor Ahai so let's begin. Okay so first just wanting to clear up something in the books I think the Jaime Bran situation will be different for example Bran may go dark differently in the books and Jaime's Nissa Nissa in the books will most likely be Brienne (though I still think it could also still be Cersei). For the show I think Bran could be turned into a WW by the NK while Jaime's Nissa Nissa in the show I think will be Cersei. 

Also I did not say GRRM was re-writing Ragnarok I was saying he TOOK inspiration from Ragnarok. Anyways now I got that out of the way I shall continue. So in my last post I mentioned Euron represents Surtr but why do I think this. Well Euron wears black like Surtr, Surtr's role in Ragnarok is pretty much destroying the world just like how Euron wants to take over the world, Surtr is said that he would bring flames that will engulf the earth and Euron wants Dragons and if Euron gets his hands on one he may engulf Westeros into flames (yes I know he has no Dragonbinder in the show but in my opinion it is never too late to introduce Dragonbinder and he still has a thing for dragons in the show as seen in Epi 7 of S7), there are other parallels but I will leave it there.

Now before I continue someone found me a interesting parallel between Bran's apprenticeship and this Norse tradition https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sei%C3%B0r I read it myself and I will not go into too much detail on it but if you read it and compare it to Bran's apprenticeship into the children's cave (shot out to Prof_Cecily for bringing me this info). But now let's get into the next part which is what is Jon's role in all of this. Jon has been setup as the main hero especially in the show but if this is true (which in the shows case some of it) What would his role be. Well Jaime could have to deal with a now turned WW Bran (in the books case a turned dark Bran) While Jon deals with the NK.

Now yes I am implying that both Jaime and Jon are Azor Ahai, But before I explain why I came to this conclusion I will quickly go through the evidence of Jon being AA:

- R+L=J solves the blood problem

- He was reborn admits salt and smoke at Castle black in his resurrection. The smoke form the small fire thing Mel made and the Salt I think is actually Snow misinterpreted as Salt.

- The red bleeding star could be Arthur Dayne's sword when Ned brought it to the tower of Joy after Ned was born.

- Lightbringer I think is either Longclaw or Dawn (though idk how Jon will get his hands on Dawn)

- Awakening Dragons out of stone could be when he finds out, convincing Dany to help him, or maybe he awakens a dragon from the crypts.

- Now for Nissa Nissa it could be either Daenerys or....well i'll have to explain that one, So in one of Jon's dreams he is on top the wall with a flaming sword fighting off Wights and one of them ends up having red hair..yep before he knew he killed Ygritte. Now yes I am aware it did not make it into the show but it could give us a clue to who his Nissa Nissa could be (atleast for the books though it be cool if this person was his Nissa Nissa in the show) Now yes Ygritte is died but she did not die at the hands of Jon nor was it with a flaming sword. There is only one other person I know that has red hair and that Jon love's (weather it be romantic or not) and that is....Sansa Stark.

Now I will get too where I got to the conclusion of Jon and Jaime being Azor Ahai. Jon and Jaime's stories kindof parallel each other in a separate side of the coin kindof way, This video explains it better then me https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pyIvXQ8I5g

But if you really look at there stories (even in the show) they have some parallels but in away that's sort of two different sides of the same coin. When we first see the two they are portrayed as such especially when they first meet. So in conclusion I think Jaime with possible help from Jon will stop Euron from destroying Westeros, Then Jaime will kill Cersei or Brienne to forge his Lightbringer (with his being a reforged Ice) and Jon will sacrifice his Nissa Nissa Dany Or Sansa to forge his Lightbringer. With Jon having to fight the NK and Jaime having to deal with a now turned dark (or in shows case WW) Bran, Maybe after Jaime is forced to defeat Bran he could help Jon with the NK a la Howland at Tower of Joy.",6,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I understand why Dany might think that - she's rather prideful herself and thinks Jon sees bending the knee as losing face. In fact, Jon just wants to avoid 

a. Losing the support of the Northern lords by bowing to a southern ruler once more

b. Being dragged into a pissing match between the Targ and the Lannisters instead of focusing on the WW

His pride has no part in it, he never asked to be King, and is about as attached to his title as Ned was to his life. While I understand why Dany thought that, I don't know why Jon didn't correct her perception. 

Now Tormund is a whole other thing. He *knows* that it's not pride that's stopping Jon. He knows exactly what the situation is. I have no idea why he would tell Jon to drop his pride when he knows the consequences of bending the knee. And *again*, Jon doesn't correct him. 

What do you guys think? Why do you think these scenes were written this way? Is Jon indeed prideful and I'm just missing it? Was he too caught up in the moment with Dany and too taken aback by Tormund to say anything at the time? ",9,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

I know they need to work and move around often so lighter clothing makes sense. It may also make it easy for people to distinguish them. However, if you look at the handmaidens from vassal houses, they also wear less than the noble women they serve (have their arms exposed). Those handmaidens are highborn women so why do they wear a kind of clothing that shows a lower status?

Where does this come from?",9,0,False,self,,,,,

I love it so much, but it pains me to finish every time. I need more. I often end up re-watching other things to fill the hole when I do this.

I was thinking of re-watching LotR or Harry Potter, however I love them too. So this leaves a hole there too. It's a never ending cycle of consumption.

So I was hoping someone might have  a suggestion of how they break through the heart destroying period of time after a re-watch of GoT?

Now yes you could just say well don't watch them, but if your like me and use the same sites everyday for news/entertainment (yahoo) they know what you are interested in and always have article captions that give a lot away.
