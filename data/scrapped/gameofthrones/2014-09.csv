|:---|
|Discuss your reactions to the episodes with perspective from the whole show. Talk about details you missed the when you first watched the show. Point out foreshadowing details that you noticed. Discuss an actor who is totally nailing their part (or not). In general, what did you think about the episodes and where the story is going? Book vs. Show comparisons are welcome, but you need to use spoiler tags for any book differences that do not appear in the show.|

* **This thread is scoped for SEASON 4 SPOILERS** - Turn away now if you have not seen all of the episodes! Open discussion of all aired TV events up to and including episode 4.10 is ok without tags.

* **[Book spoilers still need tags!](#b)** - If it's not in the show, [tag it](/r/gameofthrones/wiki/spoiler_guide).  Events from episodes *after* this one need tags.

* **Please read the [posting policy](/r/gameofthrones/wiki/posting_policy) before posting.**

* **[Use green theory tags for speculation](#g)** - Mild/vague speculation is ok without tags, but use a warning tag on any detailed theories on events that may be revealed in the remaining books or in the show.

* **Posting policy reminder:** Don't post or ask for non-pay sources.

It seems a lot different to the rest, like it's been written in a different style or by someone else. I think the way it's stepped back a bit and introduced some new characters is pretty cool, I'm actually really enjoying Cersie's POV's, I didn't think I would but when I see her name on the next chapter I can't wait to read it. 
 
I like the introduction of Oldtown and thoroughly enjoyed the first chapter with Pate and the other Maesters. Also Arya's first chapter where she arrived in Braavos was quite exciting. 
 
It seems the book is bringing the series more into the fantasy world with these new characters and locations. To me it's going in a completely different direction, at first I didn't know how to feel about it, but now I can't put the book down. 
 
The introduction of the Dorne characters was quite strange and there seems to be quite a few of them, mainly all the female characters, so a lot of new names to remember and think about. All in all I'm really enjoying it.

    Her: i dont think ill watch the 2nd episode
    
    Me: alright haha
    Me: the first episode isn't really a good representative for the whole show though
    
    Her: i know but its put me off forever
    
    Me: what part?
    
    Her: thanks but no thanks
    Her: ugh the violence and sexual parts
    Her: and the dialogue sucked
    Her: nothing happened it was just silly imo


Basically this happened because we've noticed we're struggling to make conversation, I thought it'd be cool to watch each other's favorite show so we have something to talk about. Her favorite show is Pretty Little Liars. I'm like 12 minutes in and *hoooooly shit* it's bad, it's like a porno with better editing and without the sex. All the interactions just feel robotic and forced, not human or realistic at all. That coupled with the fact that I *hate* that cheesy American accent and music, I'm really not liking this show but that's my opinion. Seriously, it has everything she criticized Game of Thrones for, minus the extreme violence and sex. I mean, there is sex in PLL, but it's not as extreme as in GoT. Also, ""nothing happened""? If anything, GoT has a little *too much* of stuff packed into every episode, it gets hard to follow along sometimes. 


Honestly, throughout the conversation, it felt like she was just shitting on GoT because that's what I like and she was mad at me, but that's all I'm going to say about our relationship. You guys don't want to hear that! 


So anyway, what's the worst criticism of Game of Thrones you've heard? The more extreme and hypocritical it is, the more points you get! ",10,0,False,default,,,,,

I just got passed the red wedding. WHAT THE FUCK! He was the best king out of all of them, he actually gave a shit about his people and tried to be honorable, who kills someone for not marrying their daughter! I mean, jez, I never liked Caitlin but I didn't expect her to die. Like, jes, WHAT THE FUCK. I watched the seen on youtube because I was curious, in the show does his wife die? cas in the books she isn't at the wedding at all (that seems like a pretty important plot point)

I kinda expected Eddard to die, I mean he was pretty stupid, but really, are ALL the ""good"" guys going to die? whats next, is john snow going get eaten by his direwolf and aria going to fall in love and have children with the hound, is thats whats NEXT!

My only constellation is that the little shit on the iron throne is dead to, with Sansa getting away, though to be honest I was hoping that Sansa's marriage would actually work out, she had grown up a lot in this book, and Tyrion is the only half way not so horrible person in his family, so you know, I was kinda hoping that would work out, but NOPE , what the fuck does LITTLE FINGER want with her. Like, where the hell did THAT come from.

Fuck it, I hope Daenerys wins, she is the only halfway decent person left, which is the biggest surprise.

/endrant (no don't tell me what happens next, I'm honestly not sure if I can handle reading another one of these books, it reminds me WAY to much of ""a series of unfortunate events"" that I read as a kid)

I quote: ""I'm just tired of so much disappointment in this series. I'm tired of all the corruption, prostitution, orgies, murder, back stabbing, money grubbing, and rear licking. That's all Westeros is.""

Yes that is all what westeros is, it shows the cruel, dark and harsh realm where those people live in. And what people have to do to survive. That's what makes this series so great. If it were all happiness and love without the gruesome and unexpected murders and slaughters this show wouldn't be so popular. It's the constant fear of the character and the viewers themselves what makes this show so awesome.

I wanted to know, if other people feel the same way or think about it differently.

Thanks.

Now that 've started reading it, and almost finished half of the first book. However there's nothing different in the storyline except for a few details and characters' their view point. what i want to ask is will it go this way for the entire series or will this deepen in the next pages?

He did it because Melisandre told him to, he did it because some women said he needed too. and as for him going north people are saying how its so noble to go north and help instead of fighting the war. but that's not why he did it. he did it because Melisandre told him to. hes her puppet, for what I don't know.

Firstly: People say that the plot starts to differ, but it doesn't really. Yes, there are some changes to characters like Brienne killing the Hound instead of Polliver/Tickler, but those details really don't make much of a difference.

*Things that I thought the TV show did better:*

- The scene where Daenerys gets her unsullied.
- In general the show does a good job of the scenery and costumes. The Iron Isles for example are well described as a picture rather than text.
- The Red Wedding came as much more of a surprise. In the book he's laying on it pretty thick with 'You can't trust the Freys, but now they'll be safe'. 
- Arya's experience in Harrenhal was better in the show, especially regarding who chose to kill. I thought her killing the two guys in the book was a bit weak.
- I think it's better aging all the characters. I can't really take a 16yo commanding armies seriously.
- Stannis makes more of an impression on me in the show. 


*Things I thought the book did better*

- It made heaps more sense that when climbing over the wall, they would drop down ropes for the rest to climb up.
- The dynamics of the war were HEAPS more clear in the book. In the TV show, I didn't quite understand why Edmure had made a blunder by attacking the Mountain. Similarly I didn't really get where Renly's/Stannis' army was when watching the show. 
- It was a lot more clear that the Ironborn had taken over the North, and that Robb Stark and his army were stuck in the south. 
- It would have been cool to see Moat Cailin the show. 
- The hallucinations in the tower of the undying.

1. No-one likes him at all. The only way he can make allies is through Davos, who manages to salvage a little from Stannis' disastrous diplomacy. The Eunuch and Littlefinger would easily manipulate the people around him, who all seem to have little feelings for him save Davos. Furthermore, a disliked King will be unsuccessful when it comes to ruling his people, which may lead to a revolt.

2. Does he even have the best claim to the throne? Daenerys is a Targaryen who held the throne for hundreds of years, surely Robert's rule will be seen as a minor interregnum if she is to take the seven kingdoms. And, if we are claiming that Robert was a true king and his descendants should rule, surely Joffrey is the next true King? Regardless if Robert knew he wasn't his, Robert's death wish was for his sons to rule after him. It was Ned who changed it to true-born heir not Robert.

3. Stannis doesn't follow the Seven. [AFFC](#b 'With the Sparrows in mind especially') , it is important for the King to get on with his people. He will be seen as an outsider following some poxy eastern religion. Hardly going to help with his lack of personality. Worse, it wouldn't be too hard for his enemies to draw links between him burning his enemies and another certain mad king who did the same thing.

Have I got any of this wrong? Stannis should have swallowed his pride and joined Renly's side. After relatively comfortably taking King's Landing, Renly would rule until he died and his brother, Stannis would rule after. Renly's affable personality would help him rule as a great King, (Stannis concedes that Renly would make a better King), then Stannis can have his turn after.

I have been reading A Dance With Dragons and the Prologue brought up a few questions about Wargs/Skin-Changers, and I was hoping someone in this magical place might have an answer (perhaps I have missed some crucial information somewhere along the way, in which case, please forgive me). 

1) Does the word 'Warg' refer to all 'Skin-Changers', or is it specific to people who Skin-Change into wolves? The line ""The wargs were the most numerous in that company, the wolf brothers, but the boy had found the others stranger and more fascinating."" (followed by several examples of Skin-Changers who had other animals instead) seems to imply the latter, but I know that in the show Orell was referred to as a 'Warg' despite the fact that his animal was an eagle, and Jojen talks about Bran having 'Warged' into Hodor, so I'm a little confused because prior to re-reading the prologue I always thought the terms 'Warg' and 'Skin-Changer' were interchangeable. Could someone clarify?

2) Can skin-changers simply enter a new skin right before death, and survive that way? In the prologue of ADWD, Varamyr recalls his numerous deaths as various animals, and his spirit always returned to his human body, but he plans to skin-change into Thistle before dying in order to survive. Can all skin-changers to this, or is it simply because he is exceptionally powerful? ",1,3,False,self,,,,,

The only picture I could find that was good enough was this: http://i.imgur.com/5XQoDzs.jpg but I'm not a huge fan of that picture.

Ideally, I'm looking for a picture that shows Ygritte's best quality (her emotional side). Something like this: http://i.imgur.com/nwjmk0V.jpg. Anyone have any ideas where to find high quality images of her?

TL;DR: Looking for high quality images of Ygritte to put on a 36x24 inch poster, preferably portraying the emotional side of her character.

I was advised threads with [Spoilers All] tags do not require hover spoilers, so I won't be including any.

The big one: Lady Stoneheart/Brienne/Jaime.

Daenerys getting back to Mereen and eventually to Westeros. I personally did not like how her story ended in ADWD. 

Stannis - Was Ramsay lying?

Davos and Rickon. Osha, too, she's pretty cool.

Melisandre. I hope she becomes even more active, I've been very curious about her. I want R'hllor to be integral to the storyline. We've seen too much build up for there not to be some answers.

Victarion's dragon binding horn.

Tyrion and Penny *actually* interacting with Dany, and the big Dany/Jorah reunion.

Walder Frey's comeuppance.

The Sparrows and their new militarized presence.

Finally, and importantly, The Others and Winter's consequences everywhere south of The Wall.

Storylines I'm not too interested in, but curious to see where they go: The Damphair, Aegon &amp; ""Griff"", Euron, Lancel.

I know you may have already seen this post around before, but Im not sure it was ever done justice. Please don't downvote it just because you've seen it before!**

* Come check us out on the [IRC](https://kiwiirc.com/client)! (#asoiafpowers)

Joining /r/asoiafpowers has literally one of the most fun experiences Ive had in a long while. The people are friendly, the lore is VERY interesting, and I get a lot of good practice writing and reading. Ill be honestits a little time consuming, especially in the beginning. But if you set yourself up for the future, time becomes less of a problem.

Personally, Im the kind of guy who loves board games, and table-top RPGs. And /r/asoiaf is very much like a board game/strategy game online. Only with more perks. If I could summarize the game in the simplest way possible, it would be: Risk &amp; DnD on the interwebs. 

If you love the GoT universe as much as I do, joining /r/asoiaf is a good way to get a better perspective on the different holdfasts and regions that arent talked about as heavily in the books or the show.

Here are some highlights and lessons weve compiled:

* Dont get drunk as a Targaryen
* The illuminanti can happen. Even in Westeros.
* [Dont insult the honor of a Northernmen. In particular, dont tell them youd rather see your daughter fuck a horse than her son.]( http://www.reddit.com/r/westerospowers/comments/26bzcb/event_northern_lords_there_is_a_rebel_in_our_midst/)
* [Sellswords cant take Lorath for shit.]( http://www.reddit.com/r/westerospowers/comments/277ev3/conflictscore_the_first_battle_of_lorath_2as/) [They died twice.]( http://www.reddit.com/r/westerospowers/comments/277it5/conflictscore_the_second_battle_of_lorath_2as/)
* [Never fight RHollor.](http://www.reddit.com/r/westerospowers/comments/27cqcu/duel_godemperor_rhllor_x_jorah_mormont/)
* [Some people are a little ridiculous]( http://www.reddit.com/r/westerospowers/comments/25yptt/claim_kings_landing_storms_end/)
* [The God-Emperor cannot die.]( http://www.reddit.com/r/westerospowers/comments/285xqq/duelscore_greyjoy_vs_godemperor/)
* [Never let the wildlings near Dorne.]( http://www.reddit.com/r/westerospowers/comments/28kttv/conflictscore_sunspear/)
* [Never let the Umbers lead the Van]( http://www.reddit.com/r/westerospowers/comments/28ff9g/event_the_greatjon_has_been_captured/)
* [Kings Landing isn't always safe](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiafpowers/comments/2dhubt/raidscore_kings_landing_173_ac/)

It's a small list, but hopefully it gives you a little glance into the fun community. (Yes, I know, most of these are from /r/westerospowers, which was a subreddit modded by the same community.)

Either way, I hope to see you all there! Feel free to ask any questions, as Im more than happy to answer.

Now this would be one of two ideas.

Initially I wanted the season 4 three-eyed-raven on my back, but think it would look kind of weird (Opinions?).

The two options I'm presented with are as follows:

**SIGILS**

Various Sigil's and words belonging to the houses I like.
These are:

1. The Lannister Lion - Hear Me Roar! - On my right forearm (outside).

2. Martell Sunspear (Possible bleeding eyes) - Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken - Right Shoulder (Ball)

3. Baratheon Antlers - Ours Is The Fury! - Each antler along the collarbone.

4. Bolton Flayed Man - Our Blades Are Sharp - Right Calf 

5. Greyjoy Kraken - We Do Not Sow (Or possibly the words of the drowned God 'What is Dead May Never Die.') - Left Calf

6. Targaryen Three-Headed Dragon - Not sure where - 'Rhaegar'

or my second design is

**BATTLE**

It would basically be the aforementioned house sigils (Minus The Targaryens) battling it out in a field. Think:

A Kraken throws a spear in front of the sun, and into the back of a lion, who rears in pain as a stag rams it in full force. A few of the Krakens tentacles have been mutilated and trapped in the crucifix of the flayed man.

I don't know where to get this. I was thinking a sleeve, but there's just too much going on...

I've found I'm not a very big fan of Arya whatsoever. She goes around thinking shes so much harder than she actually is and threatens grown men who would fuck her up in a legitimate swordfight. I also think she's way to quick to judge people and lets her emotions get the better of her. For example, Thoros of Myr and Beric Dondarrion sell Gendry to the Lady Melisandre because they need the money, which I didn't disagree with because their cause is noble, they're trying to protect villagers from people like The Mountain. And what does Arya do? She adds Thoros and Beric to her kill list. I mean what the fuck? They were so kind to her, they never took her prisoner, they fed her, didn't rape or torture her or sell her for money, but as soon as they sell Gendry she gets all butthurt and decides she wants to kill them. And then you have the Hound, who protected her for a long period of time and kept her safe from people who would have raped/killed her, and was rather kind to her considering she was his prisoner, and then he gets himself mortally wounded protecting her from Brienne and Pod and she just leaves him there to die a slow painful death? Who gives a fuck if the Hound killed the butchers boy in season 1, he pretty much made up for that by guaranteeing her safety and she just leaves him there like a total bitch. Maybe I just like the BWB and The Hound way too much but she hasn't done anything to make me like her. So how about it r/gameofthrones, who do you like that everybody hates/ who do you hate that every body likes?  ",258,37,False,self,,,,,

Looking for bandmembers and getting together to play can sometimes be less than succesfull, so I thought maybe I'd check for interest in teaming up online. Writing together, recording at home and sending each other tracks to come up with a 'finished' song. The idea I had was using the known songs, lyrics or poems from Westeros and writing our own music to it, as if we were there and were to perform these songs at weddings, feasts and celebrations :). If you think this sounds like fun let me know! For example I've already written a full kind of blueprint for 'The Last Of The Giants'. If enough people have an interest I'll place a link here. It's only instrumental though the vocal line is played by an instrument, I forget which exactly.. But there's no saying nothing can be changed about that idea of the song. Also no 'I would like to do this but I'm absolutely horrible at [thing]', there's always something to do and no end to imagination :)

In the ruined halls and keeps of Winterfell, lords hushed other lords, horses nickered, and sleepers stirred in their dark corners.

However since I haven't read the books I don't know how to spoiler tag my new post. lol So I'm asking someone who has read ALL the books (I don't want to spoil anything) So I can ask them what book said spoiler happened in.

I don't want to google it because I don't want anything else spoiled for me.

This was written by me for my [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/discussionoficeandfire) and is scheduled for tonight. I thought I'd put it here too, get a feeler for how it might be recieved. 

Now this is something that I have been wanting to write for quite some time, but haven't gotten around to for one reason or another. Is there a scientific explanation to the irregular seasons in the world where A Song of Ice and Fire takes place (from here on in I shall be referring to it as ""Planetos"")

First, here is a quote from a piece by ELIO GARCA and LINDA ANTONSSON

&gt;Its been a popular topic on the A Song of Ice and Fire forums, this whole matter of what causes the weird seasons. Suggested theories have ranged as far as suggesting dark planets in the near vicinity, perhaps a binary star, and more. But its rather fruitless; the author is prosaic on the topic and has provided the direct answer: its magic, trying to figure out a scientific, realistic explanation is bound to fail. If the magic means that some sorcerous force works on a planet-wide scale to tilt the planet this way or that... well, thats what it means. Or is it? Can there be some combination of physical causes that would approximate the apparent-unpredictability and lengthiness of the seasons? Ive yet to see someone manage anything convincing, but it may be an interesting puzzle for the more scientifically inclined.

Now, I would like to think of myself as scientifically inclined, so I'm going to take up that challenge.

Now, first I'm going to quickly refresh you all on what causes our own seasons. There are two main factors at play, the strongest of which is our axial tilt. The Earth spins on an axis between 22.1 and 24.5 degrees from the plane of it's orbit around the Sun. (Co-incidentally, it is the moon that keeps our Axial tilt so regular, without the moon, our tilt could wobbly much more drastically than it does now, to the point where we could be orbiting ""on our side"" like Uranus does)
When we are in summertime, it means that the Earth is tilted towards the Sun, and when you are in Wintertime, the Earth is tilted away from the sun (relative to your location of course) This is why when it is Summertime in the Northern Hemisphere, the Southern Hemisphere is experiencing Winter.
The second factor at play is the orbit itself. Earth's orbit is not perfectly spherical, and we vary in distance from the Sun by about 5,000,000km from the Perihelion, that occurs in January (147,098,290 km) and the Aphelion, which occurs in July (152,098,232 km)
This is also why Summers in the southern Hemisphere are generally hotter than those in the Northern Hemisphere, as their Summer occurs when the Earth is closest to the Sun.


Planetos likely does have axial tilt, but this is unlikely to be the cause of their seasons purely because of the time frame involved. Planetos' seasons change within years, sometimes decades, and for axial tilt to have a hand in this, their tilt of, let's say 20 degrees, would have to shift over to -20 degrees within just a few short years. This is an astronomical amount of angular momentum and really isn't possible unless you have another massive body in their solar system acting upon it, which is something I will get back to.

There are a number of geographic possibilities that might also be able to replicate this seasonal phenomenon; If, for example, there was a river or sea that ran through a large landmass on the planet, and this body of water was quite warm, it could give a certain amount of warmth to the planet, imitating a Summertime. If, however, this body of water froze over, that warmth would be lost, and it could plunge the entire planet into a Winter. This is something that we might have to worry about on our own Planet in the not too distant future. Due to global warming/climate change/whatever your preferred term is, we are worried that the ice caps in the Arctic circle would melt, and those sheets of ice float into the Gulf Stream, which is a powerful warm Ocean current that originates near Florida and travels to Western Europe. The climate of Europe is a lot warmer because of this, and if this Stream is blocked or cooled by these ice sheets, the climate of Europe will get a lot colder.
Now, the seas that we know of on Planetos are The Shivering Sea to the North, the Summer Sea to the South, the Sunset Sea to the West and the Narrow Sea between Westeros and Essos.. Unfortunately, none of these really fit the bill, none are large enough to hold such a current that would affect the Planet in this way, so this theory is largely proven false.

Another geographic explanation, which actually holds some promise and evidence, is Volcanic eruptions. Volcanic winter is a reduction in global temperatures caused by Volcanic ash and other such Volcanic material in the Planet's atmosphere that obscures the sun and increases the reflection of solar radiation. Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines erupted in 1991 and reduced Global temperatures by about 0.5C for about 2 years. 
In Planetos, we know already of an event called the ""Doom of Valyria"" which, while not explicitly stated to be a Volcanic eruption (among other things, such as heavy seismic activity), is largely thought of as such. This ""Doom"" could very well have brought about a long, cold, Winter that would last for many years. And with us having no way of predicting when exactly a Volcano will erupt, they are, in effect, completely random. If the books had mentioned an abundance of Volcanic eruptions, or mentioned a single eruption other than this Doom of Valyria, then this would be quite a promising explanation. As it is though, this theory must be set aside also.

Moving on to more astronomical possibilities, we have spoken already about how Planet Earth is warmer when it is at it's Perihelion, when it is closest to the Sun.. what would happen if our orbit was even more elliptical? We would get a long Summer type spell when the planet is closer to the Sun, and get a lot colder when we were at our orbits Apoapsis. Now, this would absolutely fit the bill for Planetos but for one glaring detail; The seasons are far too predictable in this orbit. Your orbit will always take 1 year (Our orbit is how we define the length of a year) and you will always get both your summer and winter in that year. So how do you ""deregularise"" your orbit? 
Well, one possibility is for the planet to orbit around a binary star system. A binary system is where there are 2 stars in orbit around one another, and a planet can fit into this in 3 ways. Firstly, a P type planet would have it's orbit around both of them. Nothing would really change in this kind of orbit as the two Stars gravity would for the most part act as though there was a single massive star and angular momentum is conserved, what you'd need is for the planet to start interacting with the stars in different locations to one another.. so we get:
An S type planet orbits just one of the Stars. In effect it is a satellite of that Star. With this type of orbit your planet would have it's warming and cooling dependant on the distance to it's parent Star, but it would also be affected by the second star depending on where abouts in it's orbit happened to be. Unfortunately, while the star would certainly affect the degree of axial tilt, enough to cause the season to change, this is also far too predictable if observed over a long period of time.
The third type of orbit that a planet could have in a binary system is one where it orbits both. Sometimes orbiting Star A, and then moving over to Star B, and of course during the ""switchover"" the planet would get relatively cold, being further away from both stars. The problem with this is that the planet will likely end up eventually on an orbit that brings it too close to the Star and be burned up by it. It would not be very habitable at all.
There is also the added fact that if Planetos was to orbit around a binary Star system, it would likely have come up in the books at some point where someone mentions the existence of a second sun. This sun may be very faint, if for example it was a White Dwarf, Brown Dwarf or  Neutron Star, but it would still be visible from the Planet... so I'm going to rule this one out too.

The best scientific explanation in my eyes is a Star with a variable output. In our own universe we have observed Stars that seem to pulsate, becoming brighter and dimmer as time goes on. Some of these are quite regular, and some are entirely random. It is likely due to Sunspot activity on the surface of the star, the more sunspots there are, the more active the star is, and the brighter it becomes. Even our own Sun has this variation, with a notable example being the ""Maunder Minimum"" that occurred between 1645 and 1715, where sunspot activity was effectively 0, and resulted in a little ice age in Northern Europe. 
If Planetos orbited around such a star, with a varying output, one with low activity for a few years, then much activity for a few years, then this could absolutely be the best solution, and the best explanation for the seasonal phenomenon. 

However, there is but one problem. 
During winter time, the days are shorter, and the sun hangs lower in the sky, and this only occurs because of axial tilt. For the axial tilt to coincide with the pulsating star is not only highly unlikely, but also pretty impossible, as I've already talked about how axial tilt cannot be to blame.. So the only conclusion I can come to is.. it's magic. Which is exactly what GRRM has already stated. 

Westeros is a fictional land set on a fictional planet in a fictional universe. Magic exists in this universe, and the only conclusion I can come to is that magic also governs the seasons. It would be nice if there was a scientific explanation for the seasons, but it does not seem to be the case. Unfortunate, but true. 

Thank you for reading, it took a long time to research this and gather all the information into one place. I am only 1 man though, and I have likely made some mistakes, please don't hesitate to point them out to me if you spot them.

2) I didn't understand a THING from Quaithe's words when she says stuff like: ""To go east, you must go west"" etc. what does she mean?

5) Why does no one make another bridge at the Green Fork? Seriously it's so weird that only Frey has a bridge on a giant fucking river

ASOS

AGOT

ACOK

ADWD

AFFC

Not that I necessarily agree with it, but it got me thinking... ASOS is -full- of deaths. Major characters die left and right. AGOT has several unexpected major character deaths, ACOK has a small few, ADWD only has one that really comes as a shock, and there's pretty much nothing that comes as a surprise in AFFC.

Just seemed amusing to me. I mean character death has become one of the series biggest traits, it's what even casual viewers/readers associate the series with, it seems like maybe this has also impacted their feelings about what necessarily makes a good ASOIAF book.

What are your thoughts? Does the number of surprising deaths have that much of an impact on the quality of the book? Were you disappointed at how little death occurred in the last two books?",23,4,False,self,,,,,

They were wrong.

Coming off the shitstorm that was the second half of ASOS, i found the change of pace refreshing. I loved being able to see the inner workings of Cersei's bat shit crazy mind, and the shift in her and Jaime's relationship. 

I loved the final chapters for all characters, especially the reveal of Doran's plans, and Cersei's downfall. And of course the question of who is the Faceless Man (I assume?) masquerading as Pate there to send to an early grave. 


TL;DR AFFC isnt a slog; Cersei is bat shit crazy; left everyone off in a good place; who's shit is Pate the Pig Boy going to tear up?",33,86,False,self,,,,,

|:---|
|Discuss your reactions to the episodes with perspective from the whole show. Talk about details you missed the when you first watched the show. Point out foreshadowing details that you noticed. Discuss an actor who is totally nailing their part (or not). In general, what did you think about the episodes and where the story is going? Book vs. Show comparisons are welcome, but you need to use spoiler tags for any book differences that do not appear in the show.|

* **This thread is scoped for SEASON 4 SPOILERS** - Turn away now if you have not seen all of the episodes! Open discussion of all aired TV events up to and including episode 4.10 is ok without tags.

* **[Book spoilers still need tags!](#b)** - If it's not in the show, [tag it](/r/gameofthrones/wiki/spoiler_guide).  Events from episodes *after* this one need tags.

* **Please read the [posting policy](/r/gameofthrones/wiki/posting_policy) before posting.**

* **[Use green theory tags for speculation](#g)** - Mild/vague speculation is ok without tags, but use a warning tag on any detailed theories on events that may be revealed in the remaining books or in the show.

* **Posting policy reminder:** Don't post or ask for non-pay sources.

Anyways I joined my mom in watching a few episodes of season four and decided, while I'm waiting for another season or two to release, why not delve into the literary side of the story before I end up seeing to much and spoiling certain things or confusing myself.


A few basic questions...
-what books do I read and in which order

-is there things as an experienced GOT fan you think a newcomer should learn or study before picking up the books or watching the show. (Prior knowledge of the known world, or races, time lines etc. etc.)

I have quite a bit more questions that I've some how managed to miraculously forget in my stoned delirious state of mind.. In the mean time id just like to know the things you think a newcomer should know. Something that will make the experience more personal, in depth, and understanding.

Again, there are some great claims open right now, so join soon if you have the inclination.


There are many claims open! Look here for the remaining spots. The game is about to start so hurry up an lay claim to your house! https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UNLrzHNtRcv_KwPQG2bpXDI5E5Ed9pUgxDuGVn8sVJk/edit#gid=0[2]

If Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark really are the parents of Jon Snow, then it is up for debate who named him. Ned Stark would have you believe he was named after his beloved foster parent, Jon Arryn. Maybe this has been mentioned before, but it is possible that Rhaegar had an influence on his name. Possibly he was named after Jon Connington, Rhaegar's best friend, former Hand of the King, and a true hero of the Realm. Perhaps Rhaegar and Lyanna had this child out of love, the war took them both and left Ned Stark alone in the tower with his dying sister, and a newborn baby in his arms. We know the last words of Lyanna Stark from the POV of Ned Stark, but we don't know if he left anything out. ""We were going to name him Jon"", she might have said in the last moments before her death.

So I grew up a diehard Tolkien fan, I've read most of his work a few times over, Silmarillion, Extended Tales, all that stuff. It was basically the only fantasy literature I ever cared about (everything else seems so... derivative, generic to me). I could go on about what I think of other big-name fantasy brands but I'd rather not get down-voted into oblivion.

But like the rest of the world I was utterly captivated and entranced when Game of Thrones Season 1 came around. Shorty after I snagged the first four books from amazon for some stupid low price of about 14 dollars and decided to dive in. I got about 100 pages into it and realized it was pretty much word for word the first couple of episodes of Season 1 (a testament to the adaption for sure), so I thought to myself ""Why am I reading this?"" and put them down for about three years (I had other books in my backlog to catch up on at the time). Immediately after watching the excellent Season 4 however I thought ""okay, I can't be away from Westeros for another year, it's time to try the books again"".

So I began again and sure enough by about page 150 I was spiraling into a sea of word-porn that wouldn't let me go. I found myself going to bed to read around 11pm and looking up all of sudden to see it was 2am (and often wide awake from the excitement of the story, which kind of sucked to be honest). This is particularly impressive considering I knew what was going to happen to every character... more or less anyway, the major plot beats are still there.

However, I said to myself that I would only read up through A Storm of Swords because I really enjoy *watching* the story unfold for those glorious two days a year I set aside to binge on the current season (pretty much the day after the last episode airs). I get that as the books progress they diverge more and more from the show but because the major events still seem to be intact I think I'd rather wait. Plus I know if I read the books ahead I'll constantly be criticizing the show and complaining about why they didn't include event x or scene y. I find it more enjoyable to flesh the world out after the fact in the book.

I think its worth mentioning that this is one of the very few book to TV (or movie) adaptations where I completely understand why they changed the things they changed and am not mad about it. The only other adaptation I felt this way about was Jackson's LOTR. Sure I had some nitpicky issues but the good far outweighed the bad and I barely remember what I *didn't* like about the movies at this point (okay Faramir). There are the obvious time/budget constraints involved, but its obvious there isn't some shithead Hollywood producer overseeing things going ""I really like giant spiders, how can we fit that in there? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgYhLIThTvk"" and the audience/me going ""WHY IS THIS IN HERE, WHY DID YOU THINK THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA!?"" (probably my least favorite and most common thought that goes through my head watching anything that has been adapted from one medium to another). With the show there's obviously a team of writers (and GRRM) thinking this through, fitting in and condensing what makes sense, while also making it a little bit their own which is a super delicate balance but has worked really well (so far) in their favor in my opinion.

But anyway, I can't think of a single book or series that I could more readily define as a ""page-turner"" as this. Sure I've come across a few others, Ender's Game, The Beach, The Hobbit, Jurassic Park (geeze these are all books I read when I was a kid, I need to read more...), what would you guys suggest? It certainly doesn't have to be fantasy, though obviously I'm more interested in fiction here than non-fiction.",18,6,False,self,,,,,

Joffery deserved to die and I hope he burns in all 7 hells. BUT, I think he was sort of setup for his tyranny in a couple of ways:

1. His mom told him that if he did not like his queen, no big deal he could fuck painted whores. Good life lessons on how to respect a marriage.

2. Hid *dad* was a drunk who admitted that he did not spend enough time with him as he was whoring and drinking every five minutes. Good father figure.

3. No one ever told him No save: Tyrion and Tywin. Learned bad behaviors at a young age without consequence would continue to use them through his teenage years.

I should also mention that it dosen't have to be a GoT quote, it could also be from a different fantasy book. 

What i'm looking for is a quote that gave you a epic feeling when you first read it. When i watch the show it often happens stuff that is really big, or that just makes you pumped, and im looking for something like that. The perfect example is probably this clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl6Y0HBV-ps

I would prefer the quote being somewhat short, and that its easy to understand that something big/epic happened, even if you don't know anything about GoT. If there is a really good quote that spoils something past season 4 i would probably still be interested, but tag it. 

Not sure if what i'm asking for exist, but if anything comes to mind to anyone, then it would be great. 

EDIT: I have realised that the way i wrote this post probably wasn't precise enough. I'm not looking for a quote said by a person in the book. What i was thinking of was an big happening. Exsample could be when Stannis shows up at the wall. Its a moment that changes how everything is going, and that looks awesome. But i need a text-version, and the Stannis example require too much information about what is happening.",7,0,False,default,,,,,

I was always under the impression Joffrey didn't know or was ignorant to the truth of his parents and so wouldn't know he is a Lannister but a Baratheon, so this scene confuses me as to why he clearly refers to himself so openly as a Lannister.

I understand that the show has time restraints and I really enjoyed that episode (definately in my top 10), but the book was so much better.

First off, that naval battle was pretty ridiculous. And it answered the question of ""Why didn't Davos sense a trap when there were 0 ships defending King's Landing?"". It also lets youexperience theimpact of Tyrion's decision to send men to their slaughter to set up his trap (did he seem somewhat non-chalant about it, or is he just well aware of the causulties of war).

But by far my favorite part was when Tyrion went outside the gates on his horse and became blood drunk. That would have been so awesome to watch. Riding and slashing through the enemy. That and his battle across the ship bridge. His actual fighting in the show was way too short.

Another aspect I liked was the Hound. When we get to Sansa's chapter and he's in her room, pulls his knife to her and makes her sing, cries. Much deeper character traits we see in the book rather than the show. Even though Rory McCann is f-ing badass.It also makes much more sense as to why Sansa didnt leave with him.

tl;dr If you only watch the TV show, read (or listen) to the books. They are incredibly well done and they provide you with a ton of extra content",18,32,False,self,,,,,

Anyways, got that out of my system! I'm really liking this book as a whole as a first time reader.

Even the details that the book has really adds to the world of Westeros that we thought we knew, oh, so well!

Sansa would easily be my favourite in Book 1. I think it's because her perspective is a lot *different* to the others. GRRM writes her really well, where you can see that she's a silly girl, but you get to experience it from her perspective. The TV show did ok job of expressing that, but you get it a lot better in the book. 

What I liked about Catelyns POVs, isn't so much her character, but that there is a lot of plot development [books 1-2](#b ""re: the war against the lannisters"") in her chapters. 

Least favourite, probably Jon Snow (Books 1-3). I found his chapters quite boring! Samwell's chapters were more interesting. 

In Book 4 - I liked Cersi's chapters! Also really enjoyed all the minor characters. 


**tl;dr** My least favourite show characters, are the characters I most enjoyed reading.

My name is Alex.  I'm new to Reddit, but I'm a big fan of Game of Thrones, and I thought that some here might be interested in checking out the new song I recently recorded.

It's called ""The Cave (A Song of Snow and Rose's)"", and it's an acoustic ukulele and vocal duet.  I was inspired to write it immediately after viewing ""The Watchers on the Wall"" for the first time.  It's still technically a demo (I plan to re-record it with a female vocalist), but I couldn't wait any longer to share it, so I hope you enjoy it!

I will admit though that Mance's death seemed a bit odd. I remember thinking that this man doesn't sound like he was ever King at all, little did I know how deep the lie actually went. I thought perhaps Tormund would turn out to be the real King or something to that effect.

So I'm, I dunno, a fifth? of the way through ADWD but it looks like things are really shaping up for the long-game, particularly with Daenarys. Quentyn and Tyrion are going to see her, and I've got my suspicions about a certain young knight in training because I looked up the Rhoyne in the wiki and it used... names... From the looks of things, Dorne would welcome Dany's return, especially if her and Quentyn unionize, and from there the rest of Westeros seems a toss-up. Stannis has put a lot of effort into securing his claim to the throne, though, and he did side with his brother during the rebellion. However, his brother is dead and the throne is in the hands of people who don't give two shits about law, honor or justice, and Dany has the most legitimate claim to the throne.

This post is meant for speculation, and yeah I'm not done the book so I'd rather if you don't spoil the rest for me but I do want to talk about this scenario.

After reading this far I'm rewatching the show and I just love and appreciate the characters so much more.  

I really encourage the show watchers to read these amazing books.  They bring so much more insight to the characters.  It gives you such a deep look into how they feel.  I personally didn't love Arya or  Dany quite as much,  but getting to read their thoughts makes their struggles so much more real and makes them much more likeable. 

I just had to get this off my chest. 

Also,  the Starks' theme...  It is so very sad.  I can't take it.  :(

When Stannis saves the Wall in the last episode of season four, Jon says ""my father died for him,"" to Davos. 

Did this seem oddly specific to anyone else? It was common knowledge that Ned had declared Stannis rightfully as The One True King, but his death came about more as a direct result of refusing Renly's offer, something that Jon wouldn't know. Saying that Ned died for Stannis feels more like a reference to Renly rather than Cersei and Joffrey. 

I could be reading into that more than I should, but I thought Jon's wording was weird considering what he would have known about the situation. ",9,0,False,self,,,,,

1606,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2014-9-26,2014,9,26,14,2hi596,self.gameofthrones,[Spoilers All Show] Need some opinions on a discussion I'm having with a friend concerning Jon Snow,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/2hi596/spoilers_all_show_need_some_opinions_on_a/,Saeito,1411709633,"So my friend and I have recently been discussing the Game of Thrones characters and which DnD Alignment chart would each character fall under. We're using the basic 3x3 Alignment grid that everyone knows and loves, and we're currently at an impasse. In the spirit of disabling OP Bias, I'll try to present both of our arguments from a neutral standpoint. We both fully agree that on the Good--Evil axis, Jon Snow is Good. Our disagreement comes from the Chaotic-Lawful axis.

One of us thinks Jon Snow falls under the Neutral Good category. The reasoning behind this being that while Jon Snow tries to be a Lawful character, he has broken his vows on multiple occasions. Once when he ran from the Wall after finding out Robb was going to war, once when he didn't kill Ygritte when they first met like he was commanded to do, and once when he slept with her in the cave. This makes Jon Snow a Neutral character, as his viewpoint can be swayed towards disobeying his vows, thus no longer a Lawful character. Even if in service to the Night's Watch, breaking his vows states that his mindset is such that his Lawful nature can be compromised.

The other of us thinks that Jon Snow falls under Lawful Good, despite his sometimes Unlawful actions. This standpoint claims that Jon Snow only tried to desert the Night's Watch because at the time his Lawful Code was to his family, and not yet to the Watch, that he broke his vow in the cave with Ygritte because he was left with no other choice (as she would have outed him as a crow if he didn't sleep with her), and that he didn't kill Ygritte when they first met as a single sign of weakness, and that his Good side prevailed over following his vow in saving her life. Everything Jon Snow does has been in service to the Night's Watch, and even in breaking his vows, he is still trying to do his duty to the Wall.

Just looking for any kind of outside opinion on what you guys think. We seem to be at an impasse where neither of us can concede that the other is correct. It may be that both viewpoints have their own merit, and that GRRM is just so good at creating characters that they don't fit within the scope of 9 different Alignments, but it's still fun to discuss nonetheless.

|Discuss your reactions to the episodes with perspective from the whole show. Talk about details you missed the when you first watched the show. Point out foreshadowing details that you noticed. Discuss an actor who is totally nailing their part (or not). In general, what did you think about the episodes and where the story is going?
