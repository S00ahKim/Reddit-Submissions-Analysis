So obviously I did not read the books and I am concerned about missing some truth. I did not understand some parts exactly when I did my research, as English is not my native language, such as Baratheons not actually being a noble house and they just massacared Storm's End people or something and took their land I think?

Is there anything I should know which could make me regret getting a Baratheon tattoo in the future? The reason why I love them so much lies mostly due to them being merciless, furious and relentless(World Of Warcraft helps with vocabulary) If they turned out to be having regular homosexual orgies in the books or some crazy stuff like that, I might pass and get a Lord of The Rings tower guard tattoo or some other stuff(I have nothing against homosexuality)

For those wondering my tattoo will look like this : https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/villains/images/1/14/Robert-baratheon.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160715020507
but the helmet will be different and the tattoo will be in black and white, only the eyes of the helmet will glow red and ""Ours Is The Fury"" will be written above or under the warrior.

So it will look a bit like this : https://www.instagram.com/p/BAH5oOULxit/?taken-by=memed_mutlu  ( My current tattoo, looks weird on this photo as i took it from a way too high angle w/e) but the new tattoo will be on my lower arm I don't know what its called.

&amp;nbsp;

*What is honor compared to a womans love? What is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms or the memory of a brothers smile? Wind and words. Wind and words. We are only human, and the gods have fashioned us for love. That is our great glory and our great tragedy.*

&amp;nbsp;

Thats why I think everything thats happened in this story is the result of a doomed relationship between Stannis Baratheon and Cersei Lannister -- and their attempts to change their fate.

# I. The Damsel in Distress

As the beautiful daughter of the most powerful man in Westeros, Cersei was expected to marry and have children with a man of Tywins choosing. 

Tywin forced Cersei to marry Robert Baratheon against her will, something that she appears to have held against Tywin for the rest of his life; she's extremely sensitive when it comes to young girls being forced to marry against their will/being treated like broodmares. When Tywin tries to force her to marry Loras Tyrell, she is defiant and eventually breaks down, begging him not to make her do it again, to which he angrily responded by ending the conversation. That scene showed how Tywin never gave Cersei (or Tyrion) any personal agency, especially when it came to their love lives.

On top of that, Jaime appears to be sexually abusive toward Cersei and it is my belief that he would kill anyone who comes between them. In Season 1, he grabs her and refuses to let her go despite her protests, telling her that if anyone reveals the truth about them, he'd kill ""every last one of them."" The controversial rape scene in Season 4, in my opinion, was no mistake at all -- I think the audience just has a hard time accepting that Cersei is a victim in their relationship (and that Jaime isn't as ""good"" as we'd like to think). 

# II. The Knight in Shining Armor

Evidence suggests that Stannis was the man Cersei truly loved  and that he was fighting for her the whole time. 

There may be more to Stannis being called the one true king than it seems. When Davos is trying to recruit Salladhor Saan to Stannis cause in Season 2, Salladhor says hell do it on one condition: that he can have Queen Cersei. Davos outright tells him he cannot promise him the queen, potentially linking Stannis' claim to his inability to promise Queen Cersei to anyone else. When Matthos angrily tells Salladhor that he should support Stannis because hes the one true king rather than for his own greed, this is Salladhors response: 

&gt; I've been all over the world, my boy, and everywhere I go people tell me about the 'true gods', they all think they found the right one. **The one true god is what's between a woman's legs. And better yet a queen's legs.** 

Moments later, Salladhor asks Davos if he really believes Stannis can win, to which Davos replies: 

&gt; **He is the One True King.**

By using the same language Salladhor just used to define the ""one true god,"" Davos could be making the point that Stannis is the One True King because he's the man Cersei actually loves. 

Cerseis nerves at the prospect of Stannis fighting to take Kings Landing in Season 2 appear to mean that shes excited to see Stannis but afraid for his safety. In the episodes leading up to the Battle of Blackwater and during the episode itself, Cersei is uncharacteristically anxious and sensitive to any mention of Stannis. This could be simply because she was afraid of what he would do to her, but in the books she talks about how Stannis wouldnt let his men sack the city in the way she describes to Sansa. Thats why I think she was actually nervous about the prospect of Stannis being killed in the fight. 

When Cersei talks to Tommen about Margaerys imprisonment in Season 5, she expresses an understanding of the difficulty of seeing the person you love suffer and not being able to do anything about it. Her attempt to persuade Tommen not to do anything reflects how she wouldve responded to Stannis if he wanted to rescue her from Tywin and Jaime  she would rather him stay alive without her than die fighting for her. 

When talking to Sansa about Stannis in the Red Keep in Season 2, Cerseis statement that shed have a better chance of seducing his horse expresses an inability to stop Stannis once hes made up his mind about something. 

Stannis refusal to become a page in someone elses history book and decision to march forward to victory or defeat reflects his bravery in the face of overwhelming odds against him  which they would be if he were fighting against Tywin, the most powerful man in Westeros. And they were; throughout Stannis entire attempt to take the throne that rightfully belonged to him, the entire realm denied him. This could be the result of Tywins political maneuvering in an attempt to prepare Jaime to take the throne for himself (which he all but revealed in his infamous deer-carcass tent conversation with Jaime in Season 1). 

# III. Happily Never After

**Even though Stannis failed, it appears that Cersei was fighting in her own way the whole time.** 

Ever since Stannis death in Season 6, Cersei has been wearing black and appears to be heartbroken. Shes also hungrier for revenge than ever.

While this could be the result of the deaths of Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen, I believe they were meant to be red herrings (see the end of this post for a link to my theory about the children) that distract us from seeing the connection between Stannis death and Cerseis change in character. 

Whereas she appeared to be on Jaimes side while Stannis was alive, in Season 7 it becomes increasingly clear that shes been hiding things from Jaime and manipulating him. At various points she snaps at Jaime and suggests that shes been using Tywins tactics against him (and Tywin) from the very start. That would mean that shes been secretly working against Jaime while pretending to be on his side to avoid suspicion. 

Back in Season 1, she warned Joffrey that when the winter comes, the seven gods together couldnt save you or your royal army. This, to me, was a reflection of her true motive: **to break the wheel.** 

According to the red priestess Kinvara, everything is what they are and where they are for a reason.

Now that Jaime and his royal army are fucked, I cant help but wonder if Cerseis behind it all. 

# IV. The Seed is Strong

In [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/79wf4z/everything_theory_mothers_mercy/) I argued that Cersei lied about being the mother of Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen in order to protect her real children. 

In my next post, Ill explain my theory that Cerseis real children were fathered by Stannis Baratheon, that theyre still alive, that theyve each been given different names for their own protection  and that theyre **Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen, and Bran Stark.** ",64,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

In the end season 8 is less episodes and might still take an extra year despite the shortened season. Considering fans noting that season 7 felt rushed and that elements they enjoyed had to be cut from the show (character development and the wider cast) to fit it in the shorter season...is it ending the way it should or would they have been better suited to extend the production schedule and do full seasons for 7 and 8?

I was hesitant in making this post because I didn't really want to reveal anything just yet, but I know what sword lightbringer is.  This is post is one of many in my theory to end all theories: A Song of Tin and Foil and I am using it as a promotional to let y'all know that I know how it is all going to end.  Enjoy.

#Lightbringer

_____

To understand the Legend of Lightbringer, you need to read it over two times and interpret it differently each time to get to the final conclusion.  The first time reading through and interpreting it points to what sword is going to be Lightbringer.  The second reading and interpretation of the prophecy is how we *achieve* Lightbringer.

&gt;___

&gt;Darkness lay over the world and a hero, Azor Ahai, was chosen to fight against it. To fight the darkness, Azor Ahai needed to forge a hero's sword. He labored for thirty days and thirty nights until it was done. However, when he went to temper it in water, the sword broke. He was not one to give up easily, so he started over.

&gt;___

First sword Joffrey had was thrown into the **Ruby Ford** when he tried killing Arya with it.

&gt;____

&gt;The second time he took fifty days and fifty nights to make the sword, even better than the first. To temper it this time, he captured a lion and drove the sword into its heart, but once more the steel shattered.

&gt;____

The second sword Joffrey had was called ""Hearteater"". The pommel is a **ruby** cut in the shape of a heart between a lion's jaws. Three fullers are incised deeply in the blade.  He revealed this blade before the Battle of Blackwater, where Joffrey ordered Ser Mandon Moore to kill Tyrion (it is revealed as such in the show, I don't know about the books).  Ser Mandon Moore tried to drive his blade in Tyrion's heart.

&gt;""I knew Ser Mandon died in the battle."" Shoved into the river by Pod, half a heartbeat before the treacherous bastard could drive his sword through my heart. Tyrion in Jaime I -ASoS

&gt;____

&gt;The third time, with a heavy heart, for he knew before hand what he must do to finish the blade, he worked for a hundred days and nights until it was finished. This time, he called for his wife, Nissa Nissa, and asked her to bare her breast. He drove his sword into her breast, her soul combining with the steel of the sword, creating Lightbringer, while her cry of anguish and ecstasy left a crack across the face of the moon.

&gt;____

The third blade King Joffrey has is called ""Widow's Wail"" blade has **red and black ripples** through the steel and its scabbard is garishly decorated with gold, cherrywood and red leather with golden lions' heads. The eyes of the lions are **rubies**.  Widow's Wail is one of two derivative swords from Ned Stark's *Ice*, the other one is ""Oathkeeper"". The person who broke down Ned Stark's Ice is Gendry's master, Tobho Mott. Ned Stark's Ice is going to be Lightbringer.  It is why Ice is on the front cover of of *A Game of Thrones* because Ned Stark's Ice becoming Lightbringer is part of *the Song of Ice and Fire*.

&gt;____

&gt;The comet was splendid and scary all at once. ""**The Red Sword**,"" the Bull named it; **he claimed it looked like a sword, the blade still red-hot from the forge**. When Arya squinted the right way she could see the sword too, only it wasn't a new sword, **it was Ice**, her father's greatsword, all ripply Valyrian steel, and the red was Lord Eddard's blood on the blade after Ser Ilyn the King's Justice had cut off his head. Yoren had made her look away when it happened, **yet it seemed to her that the comet looked like Ice must have, after**.

&gt;____

Gendry is going to reforge the sword.  It is also noted that there are seven wanderers/planets in the sky (planet is greek for wanderer).  The Red wanderer is associated with *the Smith* in the Faith of the Seven.

Catelyn praying to the gods:

&gt;____

&gt;Lost and weary, Catelyn Stark gave herself to her gods. She knelt before **the Smith, who fixed things that were broken** - Catelyn IV ACoK

&gt;____

Now for the second read through and interpretation:

&gt;Darkness lay over the world and a hero, Azor Ahai, was chosen to fight against it. To fight the darkness, Azor Ahai needed to forge a hero's sword. He labored for thirty days and thirty nights until it was done. **However, when he went to temper it in water, the sword broke.** He was not one to give up easily, so he started over.

Notice the use of the word ""broke"" as opposed to ""shattered"" in the second one.  The word ""broke"" parallels with what Catelyn said about the Smith who ""fixed things that are broken"".  Ned Stark's Ice was broken into two.

&gt;The second time he took fifty days and fifty nights to make the sword, even better than the first. To temper it this time, he captured a lion and drove the sword into its heart, but once more the steel shattered.

Jaime has Widow's Wail and he is going to drive it through Cersei's heart.

&gt;The third time, with a heavy heart, for he knew before hand what he must do to finish the blade, he worked for a hundred days and nights until it was finished. This time, he called for his wife, Nissa Nissa, and asked her to bare her breast. He drove his sword into her breast, her soul combining with the steel of the sword, creating Lightbringer, while her cry of anguish and ecstasy left a crack across the face of the moon.

Ice's two derivative swords become Lightbringer. Jon Snow is going to have to kill Daenerys for lightbringer (or is he?...).

I think the second readover is necessary which is why the wife is called ""Nissa Nissa"" and not just ""Nissa"".",52,17,False,spoiler,,,,,

The last season left me with an understanding that the faceless men were helpful toward Aryas character and being a ninja assassin but beyond that I don't understand what the point of including characters like Jaqen was. I can't even call him a developed character because he is just mired in mystery that never got resolved. 

My only conclusion is that the writers of the TV series probably bit off more than they could chew from the books. But I'm just wondering if anyone else thinks differently.

You fool), and he just stands there and takes it. It makes me wonder if Tywin did something to him specifically to earn that degree of 'respect', or if he's just heard stories of how ruthless that Tywin can be and doesn't want to cross him.

Jaime and Bran meeting each other again is even a scene Nikolaj Coster-Waldau is eager to see (from what I've read). I would love it where Jaime tries to apologize to Bran for making him a cripple, but with him losing his right hand he understands the difficulties he must be struggling with because of his doing. It has the potential to be a very emotional scene I feel. This season I think a part of it will be about Jaime trying to make it up to everyone he wronged in the past starting with Bran.

Jaime and Daenerys I feel is another scene that could be both tense but very emotional as well. Season 7 I think has given big hints that we'll be getting a scene where they will interact, from where Jaime tried to kill Dany and was almost killed by Drogon to Jaime asking her in the Dragonpit how many soldiers are in the Army of the Dead. They have a lot to discuss about from Jaime murdering her father and the events of The Spoils of War. I would love it if they made peace because they both know how much Tyrion cares about them both, but I think too that she will appreciate how Jaime kept his word to help with the Northern threat when Cersei didn't. Which would eventually leave her to forgiving him for killing her father since she knows (courtesy of Tyrion) that he only did it to save lives. I really think this would mean everything to Jaime, and if Brienne and Tyrion were present in that scene I think it would be even more powerful and leave a strong emotional impact.",32,89,False,spoiler,,,,,

I watched the entire series in the space of a fortnight, and all I can say is I'm heartbroken that I missed out on the real experience of watching each episode as it came out.

More or less EVERY big event/twist/revelation just seemed like another event that was inevitably going to happen very soon, and with each big event all I thought was ""finally! I've been waiting for that for days!"" When Jon Snow died at the end of season 4, I wasn't bothered at all - I knew he was going to come back to life because I'd read Kit Harrington's wikipedia page a while ago and seen he was still acting in the series.

The most irritating thing is that because everything blurred into one, I didn't really learn the backstory - I watched season 1 in the space of 2 days, so knew none of the details. Anytime I didn't understand something, or missed an important part, I knew that I'd be watching the next episode straight after and so would pick it up during that one anyway. Regarding the *main fucking story* I only knew that King Robert had been pissed off because Dany's father (""or was it his brother? Something to do with the mad King - I think that's the one who Jamie killed, right?"") did something shitty to a woman he loved. The revelation at the end of season 6 meant absolutely nothing to me. In fact, all I thought of when I saw it was ""wait, so it's Ned's nephew? Or did Ned Stark fuck his sister? What's he doing at this tower anyway?"" It was only when I read some of the comments in YouTube videos that I realised how big it was.

I'm so gutted I gave such an incredible show so little respect. I have missed out on a truly special experience by arrogantly refusing to watch the show as everyone else did and then deciding to binge watch it so quickly. I am so in love with the characters now, and I feel that by watching their character arcs develop so quickly I didn't have the opportunity to really get to know them.

Oh well.. I hope series 8 will be just as epic as 1-7 so that I haven't completely missed out.

Be sure to check that out first. https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/79zpna/everything_my_predictions_for_season_8_the_final/

Bronn finds Jaime in a Pub near the border of the Riverlands. He meets with Jaime and it is revealed he has left Cersei after finding out she was not going to send men to help so he has decided to leave on his own to help Jon, Dany, and The Allies However Bronn mentions if he is going to help him. Jaime stats that Edmure was locked up in the hold of House Payne in the Westerlands but had escaped. Bronn stats he can go to the Westerlands to try and get some 100 Sellswords while Jaime goes to find out what happened to Edmure and his armies after he escaped. So Bronn goes off to get some 100 sellswords while Jaime goes to the Riverlands to get help for the Great war from Edmure. When Jaime arrives near Riverrun he sees a huge base NOT outside of the Riverrun castle but around the area of where it is.

Jaime finds out Edmure has started a Resistance made up of his Army, the Commonfolk, and the remaining Frey's (if they are any if not then just the first two I mentioned). Jaime meets with Edmure and apologizes for how he treated him and wants to help. Edmure does not believe him at first but Jaime tells him that the long night is coming and also tells him he is the only chance he has to getting his castle back. Edmure reluctantly agrees to let him help. Jaime decides to get some Lannister armor and walk into Riverrun informing the soldiers there to return to KL at once and that was an order from the queen herself. They do as they are told pack up and leave. Edmure then has his men take the castle now there is no one in it. After this Edmure finally accepts to march his forces with him to the North to help Jon, Dany, and the allies in the true war to come. Bronn also arrives with the 100 Sellswords and they begin to march to the North with Jaime now wearing Blackfish armor. Meanwhile Cersei awakens to a miscarriage and starts flipping out. Her screaming is heard from Qyburn and he along with the Mountain rush to see what's wrong only to find a bed of blood with a miscarriage. Qyburn then puts blankets around Cersei to try and comfort her. Later Cersei gets word the Lannister forces send to Riverrun have returned. She gets suspects it was Jaime who did this and she puts out a Bounty for Jaime and ask Qyburn to send a Raven to The Brave Companions.

Cut back to where we left off. Jaime has finally had his time alone returns to the group. Sansa will also return from her time alone with Gendry or Arya will open the letter and it reads ""Earn This. Kill Cersei"" (depending on which stark girl stayed.) Tyrion suggest to Jaime that they should fly the Stark remaining Stark kids to the Eyrie where they would be safer. Bran stats he must be in the Riverlands for he and Howland have some things to deal with and Arya or Sansa will want to stay and see if Jon made it out. Tyrion will let them stay and Jaime along with Tyrion the group with Tyrion and the Stark children all get on the dragon and fly to Riverrun. Jon thanks to Howland made it back safely, Dany made it back safely as well with Drogon, and Tyrion returns with his brother, Beric, Meera, one of Dany's advisor (Missendei), Pod, and the two remaining Starks. Bran reunites with Meera. He also see Jon but has no time for reunions as he and the two Reed's prepare to leave to the God's eye.

Davos informs Jon that everybody should be at either the Vale or the Riverlands and Jon is satisfied with this news. Later while Beric and The Hound meet again and share a pint, Dany meets with Lord Manderly again this time Lord Manderly reveals what he said do Dany when they first met was a lie his family was actually wrongfully accused and not the other way around. The reason he lied because he legitimately thought Dany would be good for the realm and wanted to make her feel welcome. Meanwhile Tyrion and Varys walk around discussing how to rebuild once this war is done and Jon and Davos are walking around discussing what to do next, While these two things are happening either Sansa and Pod are bonding alittle with Pod flirting alittle or Arya will meet with Dany after having a bonding scene with Gendry where she reveals the deal Tyrion and Varys made with some of the Northern lords.

Jon and Dany have another private meeting. Jon apologizes for asking her to drink moon tea to get rid of the child he was simply over reacting as he was not raised seeing incest as a norm also he does not want another bastard in the world. Dany understands she promises the child will be legitimized once it is born. Jon also promises to help take care of the child as a friend and family not a lover. Meanwhile Bran, Meera, and Howland make there way to the God's eye where Howland shows Bran the reason the NK and his Others are attacking. While this is happening everyone at Riverrun is asleep and Pod finally tells Tyrion what he did to those prostitutes, but while this is happening (If Arya lives) Arya meets with Gendry again and they bond alittle more and Arya reveals where she got her training and informs Gendry not to worry as she would nothing hurt him.

Either Arya leaves or Arya and Gendry confess there feelings and they makeout (not make love just makeout). Later however Jaime and Tyrion are outside looking out from the castle walls where they notice Lannister forces with the Brave companions looking to attack Tyrion tells Jaime to wake up and then informs a Solider who was with them to prepare the soldiers. However out of nowhere some hidden Lannister and Payne forces led by Illyn Payne the camp outside the castle (containing unprepared soldiers and innocents). Jon and Dany woken up gets all the Citizens, Dany's unarmed advisors, The remaining Northern lords, and Arya or Sansa out of there while Jon along with his advisors, Jorah, The Hound, Beric, and Jaime stay with there forces to fight off the Lannister and Payne forces. (also Jon's advisors are Davos and Edmure. Also Pod and Gendry left with everyone else via hidden exit). Dany leaves on her dragon.

The Dothraki come in and take care of the Lannister and Payne forces that killed the people in the camp area. while this was happening Jon and co. where fighting off the forces but could not hold them off any longer and had to fall back. Jon remained and tried to escape but was brought down and near death. The Lannister soldiers there assume he is dead and put him in with the other corpses. However A strange figure in ragged robes finds him in the mug puts him on a horse and rides him to The God's eye. Several moments later after Illyn and the Brave companions and the Lannsiter forces took back Riverrun the NK on his dragon comes out of the nowhere and the corpses immediately turn into Wights.

To Be continued in part 3. Also If Sansa lives instead of Arya instead of a makeout scene between Arya and Gendry there is another bonding scene between Sansa and Pod. Also I wanted to put this in but mine aswell put it in now Lord Manderly while the attack on Riverrun was going on he got killed by a faceless man hired by a unknown person which will be revealed in part 3. Also yes I will start focusing on the other stories in part 3 I promise. ",13,6,False,spoiler,,,,,

In contrast, I almost feel like Jaime _has_ to die in order to finally complete his arc. If he did something like kill Cersei but live, I think that would be satisfying, but I feel like him dying doing some final heroic act will really tie off his character in the perfect way. That being said, I really don't want him to die because it's Jaime! What a great character.

Also, I feel like either Jon or Dany will end up dying. If I had to choose between them I think I'd want Dany to die, simply because Jon has had such a shit show and I want him to finally have some happiness. Dany hasn't had it great either, but then again I don't really want either of them to die. But I still feel like it's being set up where only one of them will end up surviving.

According to Maggy Jaime has to wrap his hand**s** around her throat and choke her, but he doesn't have the ability to wrap one of his hands around anything. The fake hand's just there, it can't move, much less be used to choke someone, and the prophecy explicitly mentions two hands.

Seasons 1-4 it seemed like the writing was very realistic. Everything that went down in those seasons really felt like that would be the way it would happen if it was real life. Seasons 6 and 7 has kind of transitioned to more poetic. Battle of the Bastards, Arya killing Walker Frey, Cercei getting revenge, Jon Snow being the true heir to the throne. Dany and Jon, the two people in Westeros who are truly good are on the same side fighting. It is also poetic that Bran, Arya and Sansa would be the ones who killed littlefinger because he is the reason they have suffered over the years. Jon, Jorah, The Hound, Beric have all escaped certain death or have even died and all meet to go on a suicide mission like it was their destiny. There are many more moments these were just off the top of my head.

Sure some of the thing that happened people think were illogical but they have to be poetic because if they kept it insanely realistic this show would never get an ending. That was the problem with The Wire. It stayed so realistic to the point the final season didnt really feel like a final season. It seriously felt like it was just another day and that the story could easily go on. In Breaking Bad, not everything seemed like it would realistically be the way things would go down writing wise yet the poetic things that happened is one of the things people praise it for as one of the best TV shows ever.

To the people that say this show is getting predictable, I think they are:

Trying to give the fans the best ending possible with all these fan theories.

They are trying not to fall into the same trap other shows did by not trying to be too unpredictable. Dexter is a good example, everyone pretty much had the ending that shouldve happened built up in their head that when it didnt happen and the show went a completely different route, people hated it and it is highly regarded as a terrible last season. I agree. (obviously there was a lot more wrong than that but anyways)....

My theory is that once this show ends and 10 years down the line no one will remember the little bit of hate the last few seasons had and they will just remember it as this incredible well told adventure of a series that everyone needs to experience that is so iconic that it broke the Emmys record by a landslide, SO MANY TV shows, movies and pop culture outlets reference it in some way.",26,8,False,spoiler,,,,,

I just have a few questions, if any of you care to help me out.  

1. Could the Iron Throne be made of Valyrian Steel or a substance close to it? We know Valyrian Steel was made when steel was combined with a dragon's fire and some magic. Well, the Throne is a bunch of steel swords that got blasted by Balerion's fire. 

2. Can Arthur Dayne's sword Dawn be Lightbringer or connected to it? The dawn is literally light being brought to repel the dark/night, which is matches nicely with Lightbringer and the stories. Lightbringer is supposed to be a special sword with special properties, which Dawn can also claim. 

3. Is the Mountain alive or (un)dead? I'm not really sure what Qyburn did to Gregor to keep him kicking. Was it magical like necromancy, more medicinal like potions, alchemy and the like, or is this just medieval take on Frankenstein and Frankenstein's Monster? 

4. Directly related to question 3, could the Night King possibly control characters related to death like the Mountain or Jon Snow? What if the Night King happens to learn about Jon's death and tries to control him like the wights he raised at Hardhome? 

5. Will Sansa ever marry? We might see Dany and her dragons at Winterfell in season 8 because it seems DanyxJon is set in stone, and that unites the Starks and Targs, but what of Sansa? She's learned to play the game quite well and surely knows the power of marriages. But then she also went through... her ordeals. Who would she marry? Some lord or heir like Gendry or Jaime? 

Thanks for any answers or input and sorry for longish post. :)",87,151,False,spoiler,,,,,

https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/7ag9vd/everything_my_predictions_for_season_8_the_final/

Also I was informed that non of my predictions have featured any of the Ironborn which is why in this one I will go through what Theon and Euron have been up to while part one and two occurred. Now let's begin:

Theon arrives at the Iron Islands only to find that Euron and not even Damphair are there. Some of the Ironborn who stayed there inform Theon that they had received a Raven from Euron stating he has left to pick up the Golden Company for Cersei. Theon then orders his men to begin to sail after Euron and also convinces the Ironborn on Pyke to change sides to him and Yara's side. They do and they stat they will stay on pyke and keep it guarded while he is gone. After giving a motivational speech he along with his forces sail off. Meanwhile on the Silence Damphair and Yara and chained up in the Dungeons of the ship Euron comes out of nowhere and forces them both to drink a strange FORSAKEN Blue Drink. Which leads to the show's version of the Forsaken chapter.
Later that morning Euron arrives at the location of the Golden Company. There he reunites with a old friend and his mercenary company....Daario and the Second sons. It is revealed that Daario was a spy for Euron this whole time and shortly after Dany left he abandoned Mareen and Slaver's bay. Both meet with the leader of the Golden company and they have a little chat which afterwards Euron along with his forces, Daario and his forces, and the Golden Company set sail for KL. Euron tortures Yara some more, While this is happening Melisandre returns to a Red Priest temple in Volantis where she reunites with Kinevara and some of the other red Priest we have seen on the show so far. Kinevara graduates Mel for having Ice and fire meet Melisandre is grateful but also stats she has done things she is not proud of not anymore atleast.

Kinevara stats that the people she burned where to protect the realm and they did what they had to do. Melisandre is horrified by what she said and admits she did burn that little girl to help Stannis forces but she did not know that Stannis was not the prince that was promised and also it did not matter Stannis's men were going to die anyway and because of that she can not help Jon in the war to come. Kinevara pretty much also reminds her that they will need there help if she is too help The Prince that was Promised. Melisandre then leaves the room but before she does she stats she saw Thoros die in the flames and besides him giving Gendry away he was still a better person then she (she as in Mel) would ever be and she regrets all the bad things she did.
Melisandre then leaves back to Westeros without her red Priest Robes and now in Rag like Robes (similar to something you would see on the High Sparrow but don't worry she does not all the sudden believe in the Faith. Me pretty much sort of between believing the lord of Light and starting to question it. She still believes it but is starting to question it. Similar to how in the new star wars film it seems Luke is still a Jedi but is starting to question it's ideas.) She gets on a boat to Westeros now unsure what to think of her believes.

At KL Euron arrives with the Golden Company and the Second Sons. Cersei informs Euron she can have his Gift (her) but before he can he has one last mission. He must go take Dragonstone for House Lannister then she can have her. Euron sends Daario and the Second Sons to go and take Dragonstone. With Dragonstone empty Daario with his forces and some Lannister forces easily take back Dragonstone for House Lannister. However Theon shows up with his fleet and destroys the Lannister ship and small handful of Second Son ships sitting outside of Dragonstone.

Theon and his men go onto shore and attack Dragonstone shredding through the Second Sons. Theon then fights Daario one on one in the throne room. Theon demands to know where his sister is Daario reluctantly reveals she is a prisoner on the silence and Euron is now in KL with the Golden Company. Theon wants to kill Daario but decides to spare him and imprison him instead so he can await trail from queen Daenerys. After he imprisons Daario in his ship he has some Ironborn stay at Dragonstone to hold the castle while he is gone confronting Euron.

Meanwhile Euron meets with the leader of the Golden Company and asks if he has it. He informs him yes and gives him a chest Euron quickly leaves to his quarters. It is revealed via him talking to himself that he plans to betray Cersei when the time is right and to take the throne, Dany, and her dragons once all is set and done. He then opens the chest and what is in the chest.....Dragonbinder. Later back at Riverrun after the battle and Jon is saved by the mysterious person NK and his Ice Dragon arrives and all the corpses awaken as Wights. The Wights then kill all the Lannister and Payne forces in the castle and NK on his ice Dragon destroy the Forces outside the castle. NK then gets off his dragon where he finds Illyn Payne wounded so he touches his forehead and turns him into a white walker. All the dead Lannister and Payne soldiers awaken as wights as well and then the NK flies off on his Ice Dragons as the wights leave Riverrun to cause havoc. While that is happening the mysterious rider who got Jon out of that pile of bodies arrives at the God's eye where Howland, Meera, and Bran have been waiting for both of them. Jon awakens to see that Melisandre (still wearing the Glamour by the way) saved him he also finds Bran hooked up to the tree. Jon wounded ask what's going on why is he here instead of in the Vale. Howland informs him that they brought him here because they must show him why the white walkers are attacking and why he must stop it.

To be continued in Part 4. The reason i am stopping it here because i need more time to think about why the white walkers are attacking and what is the NK's big Plan. But yes i am setting up that the final conflict will be a human one (mainly Cersei, Euron, and the Red Priest) instead of the white walkers but that will go down in Part 4. ",10,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Jon will end up on the other side of the Wall, his true home is among the wildlings and after the defeat of the Others, he will choose to stay there as the ultimate watcher keeping the peace if they ever return (he already can't die.) Jamie will lead the Night's Watch. Dany will have died in the fighting, though I'm unclear on how the show timing is going to go and if or not she will have had her and Jon's baby before she dies. Arya will have succeeded in her mission to kill Cersei and will continue the rest her life as a Faceless Man (that whole storyline can't have been for nothing.) Bran is no longer Bran and so is not a Stark. He will have to sacrifice himself in the final defeat of the WWs. 

KL's will have been destroyed in the Great War, but I think there will have been some previously unknown ancient magic that will protect Winterfell, while most of the rest of Westeros will be destroyed. 

This leaves only Sansa as the last remaining Stark and she will become the Queen of Westeros, ruling from Winterfell which will be the new capital. She will not marry but will choose to rule alone, raising Jon and Dany's child as her heir (if that timing works out.) Brienne will be her Queensguard with Tyrion as hand. I can't see Varys surviving to the end, but Sam will be Maester of Winterfell. 

I think this all fits with the ""bittersweet"" ending, but more importantly with GRRM's bigger themes: someone underestimated constantly will end up as the ultimate just ruler. This has been Sansa's arc the whole time, learning horribly cruel and harsh lessons from everyone she encountered, which will in the end make her into one of the greatest and fairest rulers in Westerosi history. Her suffering will have been in aid of her becoming a great leader who will have the compassion and honor of her father balanced with the political smarts she learned from her dealings of the brutal rulers she was tortured by (but she will not be cruel herself.) 

Also, having a woman ruling alone while raising a child: this is very GRRM. We're meant to think Jon is the hero, and he is to an extent, but the true heroine of the story will be Sansa. ",88,39,False,spoiler,,,,,

Many theories had been coming  Since GRRM said there will be a bittersweet ending in the season finale. So I have decided to come up with one based on the story arcs of previous seasons.

First of all I myself thought there will be a bittersweet ending before even GRRM said  when I saw Tyrion's shocked reaction to Jon &amp; Daenerys getting intimate . He was like ""What the hell are you both doing"". Yeah we all felt the same for the incest reason . But Ryrion is socked for some other reason.

Now this immediately made me think what would it impact all the winterfell lords and others in Westeros. Being a Stark also King in the North falling in love with a Targaryen would really make everyone in Winterfell to rally against their own King in the North Jon Snow.

Let's Recall the end scene in Season 7 ep6 where Jon is in the bed resting after the Whight walkers fight. And Daenerys holds his hand. She tells hope the people in Winterfell will invite her as the Queen. And so Jon promises they will for what she is.  Now every TIME I see a lovely scene like this in GOT it always turns out to be the opposite . 

Now let's say Jon &amp; Dany arrive at Winterfell but they don't reveal their relationship. He meets Bran but bran decides not to reveal Jon's true identity because of the Night King's breach at the Wall &amp; urge to prepare battle plans ASAP. So  Episode 1 - 3 will involve the battle with the Undead army with both Night King &amp; Bran and few other main characters like Jamie, Melissandre, Varys dying including Drogon &amp; Viserion. There will be situation where bran &amp; the Night King are burned alive by Raeghal. 



********************AFTER THE GREAT WAR**************************


So after the Great War Daenerys gets pregnant &amp; the Northeners coming to know about it. They rebel against Jon now &amp; don't want him as their King as he has betrayed all the Northern houses by becoming a father of unborn Targaryen child &amp; also another Stark (Bran) burned alive . Sansa might be furious too that their only legitimate heir to Winterfell is lost.  This is where Tyrion will betray Dany &amp; join Sansa+entire North when they rally against Jon &amp; Dany. Jon &amp; Dany are forced to leave Winterfell with Arya &amp; hound joining him later in Dragonstone. When Jon thinks he is now become really a bastard now Sam reveals that he is the son of Raeghar &amp; Lyanna And his name is Aegon Targaryen &amp; Howland reed confirming it.  

Cersei comes to know that Dany is pregnant with Jon's child &amp; the Northeners rally against Jon. With half of the Dany's men lost at the Great War &amp; without the Northern army She decides to go war with Dany &amp; kill her with the Lanister army. Tyrion &amp; Cersei meet and is revealed that it was a pact made by Cersei at Season 7 ep7 when Tyrion asked help from Cersei in return to betray Dany &amp; join her as the hand.  Cersei asks for the Northern army to Join her as she has decided to Rage a War with Dany &amp; co. Tyrion accepts reluctantly.  

Dany learns that Jon is also a Targaryen &amp; consoles emotionally that each of them matters more than anything in this world for both ( Same words said by Yigritte once ). They receive a Raven that Cersei has declared a war against Dany. Jon becomes furious &amp; sends back a Raven that he is ready not only for Dany but for the Targaryen dynasty as he is not Jon Snow but Aegon Targaryen now. The whole Westeros is Shacken knowing that Dany is not the last Targaryen alive but there is another one ~ the son of Raeghar &amp; Lyanna whose name is Aegon Targaryen ~ready to fight &amp; protect his Targaryen unborn child &amp; his dynasty against anyone. 
 
Sansa asks Jon to leave Dany &amp; come to Winterfell secretly through a raven but Jon refuses halfheartedly that he is a Targaryen now
Sansa asks why did he betray Dany. He says Dany is becoming more ruthless &amp; mad like her Father That's what made him leave her. 
The back2back war begins with left over Unsullied+Greyjoys+Dothraki fighting for House Targaryen against Golden company + left over Lanister army. House Stark that they are not going to take part in the war as they have already lost more men in the Great War. 
Jon arrives in Raeghal . The war begins Jon manages to outnumber the Lanister army &amp; Golden Company with  Raeghal. 

Tyrion goes to Cersei that they are losing the war now as he expected &amp; finds out Cersei has given birth to a baby. Tyrion holds in his arms &amp; sheds tear emotionally. Tyrion advises Qyburn to safely escort the baby &amp; Cersei to Castely Rock along with the mountain &amp; some guards. Arya &amp; the hound follow them and stop in the middle of their way &amp; thus CEGANEBOWL Happens with the Hound winning. Arya Kills all the guard &amp; Cersei with her needle. Qyburn escapes takes the baby back to Tyrion. 


&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;*********Bittersweet ending**********&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

Jon &amp; his army win the 2nd war. Jon , Dany , Davos, Missandei , enter the throne room with Tyrion with his last Lanister baby of Cersei &amp; Jamie. Dany asks Tyrion Why did he betray her. At first Tyrion says he betrayed because he didn't like her because of her similarities with the Mad king &amp; she has slept with Jon. Dany doesn't believe this says there is some other reason suspecting Cersei might have persuaded in their meeting for truce. Tyrion accepts it that he has made a pact . Dany says she has forgiven him. But Tyrion say a "" betrayal is always a betrayal no matter what the reason is""  drinking a glass of wine. Immediately his Nose &amp; mouth bleeds falls fainting . Dany helps him in her arms . Tyrion asks Sorry for betraying her &amp; requests to grow the baby as the real lion as he is the last Lanister alive now. She agrees . Finally Tyrion dies. They bury him and perform a funeral. 

After the funeral Jon says she is the Queen conquered the Iron throne &amp; can sit in it now that her dream has come true. Dany sits in the Irone throne saying her dream isn't over yet . She says the wheel with spokes are broken but the wheel is still there (The Iron throne). Dany steps aside from Iron throne and asks Jon to destroy it. Jon burns the Irone throne with Raeghal . Months pass &amp; we see the Spring coming . Dany gives birth to a baby in Winterfell . And the Spring arrives ..........!


PS: I have left out the Night King , AZOR AHAI theories because this theory focuses only on the ending. The Game of Thrones show started with a political way &amp; has turned Supernatural/fantasy way now which is why I believe it will end in a Political note thus with  BACK TO BACK WARS .

I think facing the end of the phenomenon that is Game of Thrones, we all have our thoughts on how its going to end. Which means I will irritate you now with my thoughts. Enjoy :)


________________________________________________



After the war against the white walkers is won, the future of the country is yet to be decided Jon has claim to the throne before Dany, **but most likely refuses it as he feels to belong in the North.**

Dany is offered the throne, **but refuses as well as she has realized how the power that has been given to her already corrupted and hardened her, and knows that it can drive her down the same path as Cersei.**

Stannis (who I believe is alive) is still struck with his fall from power and **refuses to let himself be blinded with power again.**

The last one to be offered the throne is Gendry (if he is around), Robert Baratheons last living son **who refuses immeadiatly since he plans to leave Westeros along with Arya westwards, and explains that the throne should not be given to someone just for his name instead for his fitting with the role.**

They agree he has a point ... one single ruler sooner or later may make a mistake, or is corrupted by power... noone, no matter who genuine or strong, is really safe from it. Also, haven't the rulers of the seven kingdom been ruling on their own for so long anyway?

The question is asked: 

**why is a throne, why is a single ruler necessairy?**

So... 

____________________________________________________________________


They bring in the dragons.

**And the iron throne is burned.**

________________________________________________________


It is decided by all those involved that a to assure a stable future for the realm, the rulers have to rule together.

They decide to stay in raven contact and let all members of the new formed great table know of issues and new plans. Also, it is agreed to meet regulary in Kings Landing to discuss and decide together.

Afterwards, the rulers and trusted ones return to their lands, or in Danys case Essos, and start a new era.

So, what do you think? Will Westeros become seven kingdoms ruling together in peace?

Please leave a comment if you have anything to add.

Thank you very much for reading :)",12,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

Then we have the lyrics, which are simply brilliant. They just show how ruthless Tywin Lannister is and I love how well they fit the events of the Red Wedding.
The song is about the rebellion of House Reyne and House Tarbeck, their vassals against House Lannister, Lords of the Westerlands. At the time the Westerlands were ruled by Tytos Lannister, Tywin's father,  a weak man and a weak ruler. The Reynes, the second most powerful house of the Westerlands at the time, saw this as an opportunity and rebelled against their liege lord. But the rebellion was quickly put down by a young Tywin Lannister, still in his teens. By the end of the war there was no male Reyne or Tarbeck alive. The song shows the defiance of the Reynes and how they were wiped out.

The study worked out that in the last two seasons there are more miles travelled than in the entirety of seasons 1-5, which pretty much confirms what we all thought.

Really interested to hear what you guys think about the travel times for a potential quote in the article that will be alongside the study. eg. Did it impact your enjoyment of the show? Can you see why they cut down on the travel time to much compared to the early seasons? How important are the journeys in Game of Thrones?

Personally the travel did impact my enjoyment, it messes with the agreed geography of Westeros and kinda took me of the episode where I was working out how they'd gotten where they had (Brienne managed to travel the 1450 miles from Winterfell to King's Landing in the snow in like, half an episode), but I know people who didn't care as much, so it's deffo an opinion splitter.",11,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

It was an idea I thought about a while ago but only now decided to put it into practice and here we now have the group stages of the Game of Thrones World Cup! 

The group stages each include 5 names of characters, of which have been randomly grouped! You can only vote for one character in each group, and the two with the highest votes will go through as winners of the group and second place will go through as runner ups. There will be knockout rounds shortly after the results are finalised, but they shall be discussed more thoroughly until then! 

Im really not sure whether this has been done before, but i myself havent really seen anything too much like this and Im on this subreddit quite a bit, but if that is the case dont give me too much hate please!

I would very much appreciate you filling it out, it should take a few minutes max, and any upvotes would be highly appreciated so others can hopefully see this!!

Any feedback would be also very highly appreciated and any questions, feel free to ask!

Yesterday, during my rewatch, I found the following scene, which had WAY bigger implications than anyone would've thought:

https://youtu.be/Ti8k4hqqXy8

In his impatience Edmure attacked the Mill and forced The Mountain into retreat, instead of enacting Robb's plan to draw The Mountain out, surround him, and kill him.

But let's say Edmure obeyed and Robb's forces killed the mountain. 

I can't justify this event changing Robb's love interests so Robb's Rebellion is still crushed at the Red Wedding because he marries Talisa. 

The next time the mountain is really important is at Tyrion's Trial. With no Mountain, Cersei chooses another champion to represent her interests, meaning Oberyn Martell has no reason to enter the fight representing Tyrion. Tyrion is left without a champion and is forced to fight, and with Westeros' best fighters at Cersei's disposal, of course Tyrion dies :(

Tyrion was not able to kill Tywin before his execution, because of that whole 'he's dead' thing, and Tywin lives!!

There's no way Tywin would allow Cersei to arm the Faith, so Margaery and Cersei's imprisonment and Loras' assimilation to the Faith doesn't happen, no Walk of Shame, and NO TRIAL AT THE GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR!

The Sept of Baelor still stands, Margaery is still Queen, and Tommen still King. Tywin is still the most powerful man in Westeros, and the Crown is strong. 

Meanwhile, in Meereen, Queen Daenerys is left without a Hand with Tyrion dead, with no one to guide her to resolving the Sons of the Harpy situation peacefully, she maintains her original plan to ""Reduce their cities to ash"" and probably spirals into becoming the Mad Queen, with no one to ""check her worst impulses.""

There's no telling what a Mad Queen would do to Westeros, but I think we can all say we're glad we don't have to see it. 

Why don't we have to see it?

Ramsey Bolton was killed by Sansa Stark*

This was the example given yet not topped. Ive been thinking of others but with many people still alive, death not via another man, etc. complications occur. I, as it often happens, am sure this sub can provide more examples!

548,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2017-11-7,2017,11,7,5,7b7upx,self.gameofthrones,[EVERYTHING] How do Jon Snow and this character that was not adapted into the show relate in the finale?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/7b7upx/everything_how_do_jon_snow_and_this_character/,fearsundown,1509999696,"With the revelations that:

- Lyanna and Rhaegar were married in secret (not many saw that coming)

- Ned was handed a baby at the Tower of Joy by Lyanna (most people guessed that was where Ned's baby came from) 

- Called it Aegon (no one thought that would be his name, many predicted a different Targ name like Jaehaerys or something) 

Now we know Jon was named Aegon which is the same name as a character omitted from the show that appeared in the books, he was the returning first son of Rhaegar who apparently survived Kings Landing sack and was smuggled out, grew up to return to Westeros under the fake name Griff with the Golden Company as his army under the name *Griff.* All of this was cut out of the show but what replaced it and why?

The most popular assumption is that Griff is a waste of time because he's a faker or will die before the end and be a non factor. 

My issue with this is that GrrM is a very meticulous writer, maybe the most meticulous working today, and while a zombie Catalyn Stark might not effect the overall narrative (and they admitted was merged with Beric's character) Griff is an invading force and would be king, I don't think he will be unimportant in the grand scheme. 

Griff's relationship with Tyrion was replaced with a relationship with Dany and his invasion was replaced with her invasion. Jon seems to have taken his name and his destiny to marry Dany. They also might have switched the origins around/blended them so things might get even more confusing. 

GrrM has called Game of thrones fan fiction and claimed to have stopped watching it. I wonder if this is because of changes they made to his core story that annoyed him and specifically if he ever intended R+L=J to come to pass or if this was Griff's destiny and true origin that was merged with Jon's and he has elements from both characters now. The videos below explains the book theory better than I could. If nothing else they are well produced and easy to watch.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tj1cxYCn0XY

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCZmUUFfeLQ

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ripntwHT77M

If the showrunners altered Jon's core story to match a fan theory and appease fans while ""streamling"" the story on such a key plot point, this might cause the dismissive attitude GrrM seems to have developed in the last few years as they have deviated more and more from his work.

Stannis, the Lannisters, Griff, Dany and the impending Night King all active in Westeros which is different than the current environment. So maybe the books will have a more complex ending with five or six sides at war than the show with just Jon/Dany, Cersei and the Night King. 

The ending of the show and books will be different, with Griff involved it has to be since he's a major player in Westeros but will/have any elements from Griff changed the show/Jon's origin and arc (especially with the Golden Company coming) or will they be able to cleanly excise it the way most assume, book and show Jon end up in the exact same spot and it will be like Griff never existed in both stories by the end?

/u/Jsizzle124 made [their own post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/7bbclg/main_spoilers_white_walker_flashback_in_season_8/) yesterday with a prediction for the Season 8 opening.  I think it's a good prediction, but I wanted to provide an alternative, and see if others also had ideas.

First let's look back at all of the previous Season Openings and Closings:

(*) Season began with a Cold Open (scene before the opening credits)

**Season 1*** 

* Opening - Three men of the Night's Watch are attacked by wights and white walkers North of the Wall.
* Closing - Daenarys becomes the Unburnt and Mother of Dragons.

**Season 2**

* Opening - Joffrey's name day tourney, where Tyrion arrives at Kings Landing as Hand of the King. (This is probably the weakest season opener of the series.)
* Closing - The White Walkers and the Army of the Dead march past Sam Tarly, who hides behind a rock.

**Season 3*** 

* Opening - Starts pretty much where Season 2 ended.  The Army of the Dead has just attacked the Night's Watch at the Fist of the First Men, and Sam Tarly is fleeing, before being saved by Lord Commander Mormont.
* Closing - The freed people of Yunkai hold up Daenerys and chant ""Mhysa!""

**Season 4*** 

* Opening - Ice is melted to create Oathkeeper and Widow's Wail.
* Closing - Arya sails to Braavos.

**Season 5*** 

* Opening - Flashback to Maggy the Frog's prophecy.
* Closing - For the Watch.

**Season 6** 

* Opening - Starts where Season 5 ended, with Ser Davos finding Jon.
* Closing - Daenerys sails to Westeros with her Unsullied, Dothraki, Ironborn, Tyrells and Martells.

**Season 7***

* Opening - Arya eliminates the Freys.
* Closing - Bran discovers R+L=J is legit, while Jon bones his aunt.  Bran then watches the Night King attack Eastwatch by the Sea and take the Army of the Dead south of the Wall.

**Notice any patterns?**  As I typed this, I noticed one possible theme for all the openers is Death.

- S1 - wights kill men of the Night's Watch
- S2 - the Hound killing a guy at Joffrey's tourney
- S3 - more wights
- S4 - Death of the Stark House (from Tywin's perspective)
- S5 - Cersei's children's deaths
- S6 - Jon
- S7 - the Freys

**Prediction for Season 8 Opening**

First, I think Season 7 ending on the Night King provides some support for /u/Jsizzle124's prediction.  But if they don't start with the Night King or the Army of the Dead attacking some random northern town, then - 

Like Season 2, Season 8 will begin with a random death at a tourney.  The cold open will be the Tourney at Harrenhal, and will show the story of how Rhaegar Targaryen fell in love with Lyanna Stark.  This tourney has been mentioned many times in the books, is an important moment in the history of Westeros leading up to Robert's Rebellion, and has barely been mentioned on the show.

To make it fit the current story, it'll be seen from Bran's perspective as the three-eyed raven, and will be a montage following Rhaegar, showing him with Lyanna, him learning about the prophecies, and ending with Rhaegar and Robert at the Trident.

Maybe just wishful thinking since I think it would be a cool scene to include in the show.  Other possibilities are:

- The Golden Company arriving in Westeros, and Daario with them
- Theon rescuing Yara
- Tormund and Beric in aftermath of the attack on Eastwatch
- Jon and Dany, full-penetration scene

**TL;DR: Season 8 will open with Rhaegar and Lyanna at the Tourney at Harrenhal.**",58,124,False,spoiler,,,,,

Today I want to talk about my opinion on who will be the Valonqar to take down Cersei Lannister. Many theories are already there, but Season 7 seems to have added another option :)

So enjoy :)



_______________________________________


**Cersei:**

*When will I wed the prince?*

**Maggy:**

*Never. You will wed the king.*

**Cersei:**

*I will be queen, though?*

**Maggy:**

*Aye. Queen you shall be until there comes another, younger and more beautiful, to cast you down and take all that you hold dear.*

**Cersei:**

*Will the king and I have children?*

**Maggy:**

*Oh, aye. Six-and-ten for him, and three for you. Gold shall be their crowns and gold their shrouds, she said. And when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you.*


____________________________________________________


**The Suspects**


So far, the role of the Valonqar, ( Little brother/sibling) has been thought to go to several people: the Stark Siblings, ever since Robbs death all younger siblings, Tyrion and Jaime.

I dont believe its going to be Tyrion. He has other parts to play in this story.

The Starks, in my opinion, arent going to play this part either. Jon, Arya and Bran also all have more important tasks to tend to, and Sansa.

 I believe, **is the younger queen mentioned in the propecy.**

Indeed. Since Cersei is already conspiring against the new formed alliance she is part of, and most of the members will be busy fighting the coming winter (especially Dany and the dragons) Sansa is alone in charge of the North and its allies. I believe that once she finds out about Cerseis sceme, she will do anything in her power to stop her. And also

 take everything she holds dear.

Which brings us to her brother. 


_____________________________________________________


**Jaime**

By the end of Season 7, he leaves Kings Landing, and Cersei most likely for Winterfell. Since we only have one season to go, I believe he will inform Sansa of what is to come. But will she trust him?

We may get a well-acted speech and the fact that she knows Tyrion is trustworthy... and maybe **Brienne will stand up for him**. She did so before referring to him as Ser Jaime, becoming his friend after all, and in the end even questioning loyalty in general for the greater good to convince him.

So, they may inform the alliance and stop the Iron Banks army on the shores of Westeros and Cersei will realize her defeat.

And soon she will get to know that Jaime has deserted from her.

And then, winter arrives.


______________________________________________________________


**Cerseis fall**


I believe that by the time the northern armies arrive in Kings Landing, they will not be stopped (since the public hates the Lannisters). They will approach the castle, but not to kill her Jaime will have informed them that she carries his child. But Cersei will have barricaded herself in the castle defeated.

She will have lost all her children, her brother, her realm, her power. She will know that whatever life awaits her wont be golden.

She will be in deep depression, probably partly starved through this, weakenend through alcohol consumation over the years (Film Theories has confirmed that she is actually the heaviest drinker of her family) and still struck by the loss of her family.

And then she sees the army arriving.

________________________________________________________________________


Cersei could now easily kill herself, take a poison and escape like this but this would endanger her child. Maybe shell try to escape, but the stress will be extreme.

This could turn out as a scene alike Lyannas death I do believe that she went into labour because when she saw the knights coming, she was terrified for her babies life.

I can see some similarities Lyanna also had lost members of her family, with her lover dead and the future she dreamed of burned away and she was possibly partly starved as well through emotional trauma. At this point, the authors may explain what led to her death this way.

And since Cersei is not only much older and bodily and mentally weakened by this point, but also had problems giving birth in the past (Joffrey was a day and a half) **the blood loss, pain and physical effort during birth will be fatal **


**What ultimately kills her is her childrens younger sibling.**


Thats right. Cersei dies during the birth of her last child.

Which draws an odd line to **her own mothers death** as well.

This is my theory so far. But what will happen then? 


_______________________________________________________________


**A new beginning**


Jaime will arrive first at the scene, I think. He will find her in her own blood and they will share some last words. And most of us will cry, despite everything that happened.

He will take the baby (decide if its a boy or girl) and take it with him.

I believe Cersei will then be cremated and buried on the ground of the former sept accompaniing her family.

Jaime will then, after the war is over, probably return to Casterly Rock with Tyrion and the baby. Maybe Brienne will come with them too
Anyway, this will be a new beginning for house Lannister. Now without any hardship or greed, with Tyrions ideas and the chance to restore the family name, to take more care of the people.

By the end of the series, we may see the child a few years later, happily living with its family, surrounded by people who love it dearly (could you imagine Brienne as a sort of mother to the child? You dont need to be any kind of female to be a mother I think she would be good at this.)

And Jaime would finally activily take part in one of his childrens lifes.


So, what do you think? Will the Valonqar be Cerseis last child?

Please comment if you have anything to add :)

Thank you very much for reading :)

Could this be evidence that the old three eyed raven did indeed cause Aerys to go mad? I think he probably tried to get King Aerys to burn all the white walkers, or perhaps store the wildfire in kings landing for its future defence against the dead? 

Could this be why the three eyed raven warns Bran not to stay too long in the visions? Could this be a similar instance as the ""Hold the door"" occurrence with Hodor?

So many questions...

Edit: Here is the link in case you guys missed it:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qsQUroPq3g

Edit 2:It's around 2s mark

Edit 3: This doesn't necessarily support that Bran is the old 3er or that there is some sort of infini time loop, but that the whisper in the vision, which I havn't seen anyone mention yet, could be significant in that someone whispered ""burn them all"" or even more, which is interresting and has gone unnoticed in my opinion.",31,42,False,spoiler,,,,,

How close does he have to be to summon dead? It seems like he can be pretty far away. He could easily fly all over Westeros summoning dead as he flies overhead. He would quickly create an unstoppably large army.

This might leave him exposed to an attack from Danny's dragons (if she could find him), but he would have an army almost anywhere he went as he summons them and it's not like an army could do much against a dragon anyways. He could strap a few of those ice spears to Viserion and he would be set. They seem to be the only thing that can take down a dragon and he has ridiculously good aim.

I ask this because I think the T.V. show has created a few major plot holes.

So a while back I was thinking about what the NK actually wants and having read some things about Islam (I won't expand on that) and inspired by some memes, here I throw a theory that probably isn't original or rational, and I expect to be bashed for it, but here I go, just so the subreddit isn't all about costumes and the GoT actors' social media pics. TV show only!

So let's say that Night King actually wins (meaning there is noone left to oppose him or stop him) and he conquers the whole world (or just Westeros or whatever, let's just stick with the entire world for simplicity). Everyone who could be is turned into a wight. So the only beings left ""alive"" are Night King, the White Walkers and wights. That would in a sense mean that the world peace was achieved. Why?

Well, the wights are perfect servants (or slaves rather) to the White Walkers. They don't fight each other, kill or steal from each other, harm each other in any way. There wouldn't be any famine, war, civil war, conflict or plague. In other words - peace. 

Now, just to unnecesarilly complicate things... how much are the White Walkers subservient to Night King? Are they also slaves to him, or did he let them have some degree of free will? If he did, then perhaps the interWW war could still be possible. Some random White Walker may aspire to get himself the title of king. To what end however, I don't know.

If I have to back it up with something, Cersei said that being a soldier in the army of the dead would be an improvment for most people. Ok I'm done, I apologize for my english but mainly for this post, but hey... it's offseason, what do you expect?!",5,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

You have Littlefinger and Sansa in the Winterfell crypts talking about Lyanna. Sansa says that Rhaegar kidnapped and raped her, and Littlefinger responds with a Did he?. We dont know if Littlefinger knows the truth, but the doubt in his tone is at least a subtle hint for the audience. 

Then you have Stannis talking about Jon and it is brought up that he is a bastard and his mother is likely some tavern wench. Stannis says something like Perhaps, but that wasnt Ned Starks way. So we have Littlefinger questioning Rhaegar and Lyannas relationship, and Stannis questioning Jons mother in regards to Neds honor.

The third and biggest piece of foreshadowing is from Maester Aemon. He isnt feeling great, and laments that being a Targaryen alone in the world is a terrible thing. Then it cuts immediately to Jon walking into the room. 

Rewatching this, I was stunned with how many subtle hints were placed throughout the episode. Just enough to make rewatching interesting but not enough to spoil the twist. It really lays the groundwork for his parentage to be revealed an entire season and a half later. Pretty impressive -

Anyways let's get started:

Now a lot of people think Jon and/or Dany are Azor Ahai and I still think it is possible that either Jorah, Jaime, or Davos are Azor Ahai. While I think all of those are possible I have a new interesting theory inspired by a theory I heard that Rhaegar is Azor Ahai and I think it is possible that Rhaegar could've been Azor Ahai. Now my theory goes is that Lightbringer is a person not a sword and he and TPTWP are one in the same. Azor Ahai is just the father and that Azor Ahai will create the Prince that Was Promised/Lightbringer to save the world in his place.

Now what evidence is there for Rhaegar being Azor Ahai:

- He has the blood of the dragon.

- he was most likely born admits salt and smoke at the tragedy of Summerhal. Smoke from the fire and salty tears.

- there was a red comet in the sky at his birth.

- Lyanna is his Nissa Nissa.

- He awoke a Dragon. Jon Snow

- Jon Snow is his Lightbringer (well okay the Lightbringer he used to create Jon was...You know. But Jon is Lightbringer in the sense he is the one saving the world)

Now for the second part of my theory as we all know last season Jon and Dany hooked up and I think they will most likely have a child. I think history could repeat itself with Dany dying during child birth and Jon either sacrificing himself to save the white walkers or he has to become the Night king to keep them away from Westeros. There twins (yes I think they should be twins id prefer they are named Rhaegar the II Targaryen and Arya the I Targaryen) Would be raised by either Sam and Gilly or Arya and Gendry (also if the final conflict is a human one and Jon and Dany are out of the picture early along with the white walkers then we could see the show ending with the Stark sisters going up against Cersei and/or Euron)",9,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

Later, in S7E7 we learn from Cersei Lannister that she has hired the Golden Company to help out in this latest conflict to grace the lands of Westeros. At first, this struck me as odd given that the Golden Company are traditionally seen as Targaryen loyalists, but I thought ""It's the TV show we're talking about, not the book. It's entirely possible D&amp;D have changed things up a bit for the sake of story!"" But then I had a thought...

What if Melisandre travelled to Volantis with the explicit intention of hooking up with the Golden Company? Cersei may well be the ones to transport the Company over - believing that she holds (or will hold) a contract with them - but it could be that Melisandre has been working to bring them over to Daenerys Targaryen's side (there's no evidence as yet that she's aware of Jon Snow's true parentage).

And I get that some shows cost more to produce than others. But as good as Game of Thrones has been this show seems like one big wasted opportunity in my opinion. I can never recall a show that has really captured the audience like Game of Thrones has. And the crazy thing is that it's not like Stargate SG-1 for example that has a targeted audience. 

The main part of this show should have been minimum nine seasons for the main plot. And IMO, there should have been nine accompanying movies that focused on the seven major realms of Westeros and one that covered Essos. For example, a Game of Thrones Story: Storm's End. This movie could have been about the ensuing power struggle that happened after the events of the War of the Five Kings. With their being no Baratheon male in the city who sits on the throne? Then make the story about a power struggle between the nobles from the perspective of a young solider who is trying to support his family. 

Something like this would have given us an in depth view of what life in the Stormlands is like. It would have given the opportunity to flesh out lore by visiting the towns, people who live in the castle, it's defenses, it's major families, etc. And they would have been able to make major $$$ by casting (no-name) actors.

When Ned found Lyanna at the Tower of Joy with baby Jon, she said to him something like ""Robert will kill him if he finds out. Promise me you'll protect him.""

I'm not sure of the timeline with the murders of Rhaegar's other children, but they were apparently killed at Tywin's command.  Ned probably wasn't sure what Robert would do if he found out about Jon.  As his best friend, I think Ned would want to believe that Robert wouldn't kill him if he found out about him, but he wasn't going to risk it.  So he kept that secret from everyone, including his own wife.

So then what happens when Daenerys comes up later in life?  Another Targaryen still alive, and her location is now known, and Robert immediately makes the decision that she must be killed, even though she poses no immediate threat to Robert or Westeros.  Ned is furious.  He isn't just against the assassination, he goes as far as handing Robert his Hand of the King pin.

This was confirmation for Ned that Robert definitely would have killed Jon had he known about his true parentage.  And that even now that Jon was a man of the Night's Watch, Robert would still kill him if he found out.  In a way it justifies Ned's lying for years to everyone, but I don't think he wanted to be justified, or to keep the lie much longer (he had told Jon that the next time he sees him, once he's in the Night's Watch and no longer a threat to anyone, that he'd tell him about his mother).",9,26,False,spoiler,,,,,

I'm talking main players like Dinklage, Coster-Waldau, even Harrington or Clarke, or even Heady. And I'm not saying it has to be exclusive to a scandal. House of Cards was easily one of my favorite shows, and seeing the plug pulled so fast when shit was really expected to go down, made me think about what or if something like that could happen to Thrones. 

I know a lot of people have considered the possibility of GRRM passing before he can finish the the books, and this show has no problem replacing or reusing a character (the Mountain, Martyn/Tommin, TER). So what if something were to befall a main character like Jon Snow or Dany? 

Probably a shit post but I'm genuinely curious, and gods forbid something were to prolong season 8 further.

So a thought i had about season 7 is about the scene with jamie and the queen of thorns. In that scene she revelas that it was her that killed joffery and not tyrion which was a big deal at the time but not as big as it could have been. 

This is due to the fact that to my memory tyrion doesn't lie to jamie when they are escaping and tells him that he did kill joffery like he does in the books. So what i think is that if this scene plays out similarly  in the books it will be a huge moment for jamie amd he might question everything tyrion told him that night and could push him back to cerci.

First of all, Varys did not show up in Mereen towards the end of season 5.

Season 6:

Doran is in the Water Garden, accompanied by Ellaria, Tyene, and Areo Hotah. He received the message that Myrcella was dead, and in that very moment, Ellaria and Tyene attempt to assassinate him, but are stopped swiftly by Areo. Obara and Nymeria rush in, but are overpowered by the guards following them. The Sand Snakes and Ellaria are then dragged away as they scream and curse.

Later, Trystane returns to Dorne and meets his father. Doran has the Sand Snakes and Ellaria bring to him, and tells them that he did not forget his siblings. He will take away everything the Lannisters built.
""With fire and blood"", says Varys as he shows up.
Doran then sends Obara and Nymeria to guard the Boneway should the Lannisters strike. As for Tyene, she was dispatched to King's Landing.

A few episodes later, in King's Landing, Tommen was approached by a young septa. The king is smitten by her and talked into joining the High Sparrow. The septa is then revealed to be Tyene Sand.

Under the influence of Tyene and the High Sparrow, Tommen bans trial by combat. Meanwhile, Qyburn informs Cersei the Wildfire beaneath the Great Sept of Baelor was not removed. Then a scene of Qyburn meeting Tyene reveals him as an agent of Varys.

Cersei blowed up the Sept as Qyburn expected. With the beloved Queen Margaery and High Septon dead, the people of King's Landing are infuriated. As Cersei crowns herself, the people are only held back by the fact that Jaime has returned with the Lannister army.

Thus Tyene succeeds in leaving King's Landing in turmoil, and the Seven Kingdoms are on the brink of chaos. Perfect for the Dragon Queen to seize.

Unbeknownst to Olenna that Doran and Varys planned the destruction of House Tyrell, she joins them in their goal to restore House Targaryen on the Iron Throne.

Yeah, so this is how I'd fix the Dornish plot, what do you think?",8,7,False,spoiler,,,,,

I think the books will play out an additional thread in them that leads to Lady Stoneheart and might pertain to Catelyn being involved in the plot to kill Jon Arryn. I think the show removed some of this but kept Catelyn's bad decisions, making her more sympathetic and that's why the show omits Lady Stoneheart, since they don't need closure. 

Re-reading the book to me made it seem like she almost expected the raven to come with news of the Lannister's killing Jon Arryn. Catelyn has a whole speech planned with Maester Luwin about how Ned needs to take the job and thought at length about the victory it would be for her family. She had to push Ned to become the Hand despite risk. Her book reaction always seemed odd as opposed to the show that was more natural asking Ned not to go as any loyal wife would. I think this is a key change. 

Is it possible book Catelyn knew her sister and childhood friend were going to kill Jon Arryn and her husband would be offered the job? Did Petyr bring her into his scheme in the book (not the show)? We know what book Catelyn thinks of Petyr. 

*""Petyr Baelish loved me once. He was a boy. His passion was a tragedy for all of us, but it was real, and pure, and nothing to be made mock of. He wanted my hand. That is the truth of the matter. You are truly an evil man, &lt;Tyrion&gt; Lannister.""*

Catelyn had as much (in theory more) to gain as Petyr and Lysa. 
- Her husband now 'hand to the king', 
- her daughter in line for queen 
- her son lord of winterfell,
- jon at the wall 
- if she played her cards right and she could get out of Winterfell where she complained of the cold. 
- If they successfully framed the Lannisters then her family would take the Lannisters place at court. 

This would be Petyrs pitch to her. But then the plot goes bad when Bran is seemingly attacked by the Lannisters in possible retribution for discovering the plot (as far as a panicked Cat would know) and she won't leave his side...out of possible guilt, in the books at least and she spits hate at Jon wishing it were him, maybe because getting rid of Jon was a big part of the reason she went along with the scheme in the first place. 

From here on events match up but the books will explain why Cat does a lot that she does, where the show it is very surface level fear and grief. Catelyn has to run to kings landing to warn Ned about the Lannisters plot (or get her story straight with a co-conspirator Littlefinger and figure out what to do now that the Lannisters may be on to them). 

Catelyn kind of flails around and makes bad decision after bad decision impulsively capturing Tyrion and taking him to her sister, (a possible co-conspirator) who would likely freak out not wanting to be dragged down and have her scheme revealed just because her sisters family is unraveling.

Bran was attacked first on a coincidence and then second by Littlefinger taking an opportunity to point Cat at the Lannisters. She jumped to the conclusion pretty quick (one gold hair?) and was quick to believe Petyr on Tyrion almost as if they both had similar info on why the Lannisters hated them. 

- Petyr and Lysa know they killed Jon Arryn and have told the Starks it's the Lannisters doing.
- Cat supposedly thinks the Lannisters killed Jon Arryn and now that Ned is the hand the Starks might suspect it so...they tried to kill her son? Doesn't make much sense... Unless she thought she was caught framing the Lannisters and now they are *paying their debt* and want revenge...then she better get to Kings Landing and see Petyr to clear it all up since it was his plan. When that fails get Tyrion and go to your sister...maybe that will help. 
- The Lannisters have no clue about anything other than having incest and throwing a kid off a roof, they don't know why Jon Arryn is dead and probably at most aren't thrilled Ned is coming to Kings Landing but never suspect he is to blame them for a murder they didn't commit. 

So Cat is in the middle of this being played in both the book and the show. In the book she seems to be running around like a guilty person trying to cover up a crime almost, making quick irrational moves. 

Book and show Catelyn died because they trusted Petyr, as did Ned at her request.   In the books she might be much darker and in line with Lady Stoneheart where in the show she was just foolish. She got Ned killed in many ways even without a plot to kill Jon Arryn.      

I think her incoherent actions were the attempt (in the books) to put her errors right and save the family she put in danger which is why she didn't listen to Ned repeatedly and kept acting on her own because he knew it was her fault and she thought with the added info she had she could clean up the mess better. Lady Stoneheart is the guilt of what **she** caused where the show just went a more straight forward sympathetic route in trusting Littlefinger and so Stoneheart isn't needed.

I understand that his story is likely to end much differently in the book but, just as a scene on its own, I thought it was the perfect cap to his arc and I like how they actually included the battle that the whole season was building to (rather than in the book where it ends in a cliffhanger).",12,27,False,spoiler,,,,,

All things in fiction (and otherwise, more or less) adhere to certain traits that can be found in anything worth it's salt.

Game of Thrones being so ripe with characterization, I was wondering how closely you think some of the characters in these stories follow alongside the archetypes Jung mapped out. 

I don't know Martin's familiarity with this as a whole but he seems to have stuck pretty closely to it as Lucas did for Star Wars. So who is who, would you say? Some are more obvious than others.

Here are the archetypes-

The hero- who pursues a great quest to realize his destiny.

The self- the personality striving towards its own complete realization.

The shadow- the amoral remnant of our instinctual animal past.

The persona- the mask and pretense we show others.

The anima and animus- our female and male roles and urges.

The mother- primarily in the sense of our need of her.

The father- primarily an authority figure often inducing fear.

The child- our innocent beginning with all our potential in front of us.

The sage- or wise old man, one who has the profound knowledge.

The god- the perfect image of the Self.

The goddess- the great mother, or Mother Earth.

The trickster- a rascal agent pushing us towards change.

The hermaphrodite- the joiner of opposites.

The beast- a representation of the primitive past of man.

The scapegoat- suffering the shortcomings of others.

The fool- wandering off in confusion and faulty directions.

The artist- the visionary and inspired way of approaching truth.

The tree- the growth towards self-fulfillment.

The wizard- knowledgeable of the hidden and of transformation needed.

* ~~**Jojen Reed** died far north as well but wouldn't make as much of an impact~~

Everyone who died around the rebellion at Craster's Keep was burned, right? (Craster, Jeor Mormont, Karl, Locke)  
Everyone who died around the wildling attack on Castle Black was burned.  
Did I miss anyone?

My money's on Hodor, Benjen, Thoros and Karsi. Hodor because it would have the biggest emotional impact, Thoros because it was a recent death and Karsi because it was so explicitly shown how she joined the army of the dead. Benjen really fits all of these 'criteria' to some extent.

I personally in a way think he is, but for the most part he loves her out of respect, admiration and care. But the more I think about it, I wouldn't blame him if he was. When most people interact with him, the first thing they take notice is that he is a dwarf including some of the people who come to warm up to him eventually. Daenerys on the other hand, looks past that and doesn't even focus on that part of him (she even feels guilty if she makes a reference related to his height 'he's too little for me') and pays more attention to what kind of person he is. 

Dany really has done a lot for him that I'm sure he wishes his family would've done for him his whole life. She gave him a purpose and a reason to live after he was ready for death after he lost everything in the entirety of Season 5, has stood up for him when people talk down upon him and demands they treat him with respect (in the scene where Ellaria openly admits that she regretted allowing Oberyn to fight for him. I'm sure she would've done the same when Euron threatened him in the Dragonpit but wasn't in a position to do that and was sticking to Tyrion's advice on not acting out on impulse since the whole meeting was sitting with people who want them dead.) and is overprotective of him from being hurt or killed, when she said she likes that he isn't a hero because she doesn't want him to make choices that could lead to him dying and was the very first and pretty much only person in the Dragonpit who was against Tyrion speaking with Cersei out of fear of him being murdered. Can anyone ever remember a time where someone didn't want him in danger in previous seasons, because I can't. Maybe there is one, but it's hard for me to remember. I'll have to rewatch the show again to catch those moments.

I like it better that Tyrion hasn't shown any romantic or sexual interest for her and is mostly focused on attempting to make her vision on the world become reality after devoting his life to her, but at the same time I wouldn't blame him if he DID develop some feelings.",27,18,False,spoiler,,,,,

Since I already watched everything, didnt really pay attention to the actual story, I instead focused on the acting and it was just so fucking well done that you could just empathize with Viserys.

Here we have the son of a universally hated tyrant, kicked out of his home at the age of five and forced to run away into hiding with his young sister finally old enough to secure an army and take his throne back. The only thing that he needed was his sister who ended up stealing the throne and all of his power. He was forced back into the shadows, out of the spotlight again because of his sister. Then Jorah stops him from taking his only way of getting back to Westeros and possibly attempting an army, you can see see Viserys finally losing it.

While he was a cunt, he was still an excellent character and I really would have loved to see him evolve throughout the series.",25,15,False,spoiler,,,,,

The shiver down my spine made me feel some type of way, almost felt sorry for Septa Cunt. 
What a great scene!
Lena Headey is really some actress! 
Might as well ask, what do you think happend to her besides being tortured by The Mountain... do you think we will see her next season or is she pretty much dead as one can be?

This was a house who helped save the blackwater, who produced great knights like Loras Tyrell and had a huge fighting force. Renly was favored to win the throne because of Tyrell support. Yet in season 7 the Tyrells lost Highgarden, despite having a defensive position, in a single battle. How in the absolute hell does this happen? You could say the Tyrell forces abandoned the castle, but that loses all credibility when you think that Olenna Tyrell herself was present at Highgarden and Olenna being the last Tyrell left would mean she would be accompanied by a well provisioned, highly trained army in an incredibly defensive stronghold. The show shows that the Lannisters allowed Casterly Rock to be conquered in order to take Highgarden implying it was a feint. Well the Unsullied took Casterly Rock without the help of the Tyrell army. The Tyrell army isn't mentioned or shown. They would be residing at Highgarden. It makes absolutely no sense that Highgarden could be so easily captured. It's a sloppy way to end the story of a powerful house.

Jenny, a descendant of the First Men, brings a woods witch with her to Kings Landing.  The witch in turn brings her prophecies that influence the marriage of siblings Rhaella and Aerys in the hope of the prince that was promised.

In 259 AC, King Aegon tries to restore dragons to the Seven Kingdoms, resulting in the Tragedy at Summerhall.  Much is unknown.  Perhaps the woods witch filled Aegons head with dragon prophecies.  Jenny of Oldstones dies in the resulting fire.  Yet, the much older and slower wood witch escapes the tragedy.  Was Jenny sacrificed to the shock and horror of all those who attended?

The woods witch lingers in the ruins of Summerhall for 15 -20 years, mourning the death of her beloved Jenny.  Sometime during this period, Prince Rhaegar Targaryen begins visiting the ruins and encounters the woods witch.  Rhaegar becomes friends with the woods witch and learns the tale of Jenny.  He shares music with the old woman as the witch shares stories about Jenny, the First Men, and prophecy.  Rhaegar writes Jennys song, a sad song about a girl born of ice who dies tragically in fire.

The Tourney at Harrenhal in 281 AC brings Prince Rhaegar and Lyanna Stark together.  He sings the sad tale, and when Lyanna cries from the story, her little brother Benjen teases her, which results in Lyanna pouring a cup of wine on his head.

By the end of Roberts Rebellion in 283 AC, Benjen Stark loses his Father Rickard, sister Lyanna, and brother Brandon.  Though the teenager Benjen remained safe in Winterfell during the war, this great family loss at the hands of the Targaryens scars him.  While hating the one Targaryen that started it all, Rhaegar , Benjen remembers the song of ice and fire, obsessing over the meaning.  Where others only heard story, he begins to find truths in the words.  Influenced by the song, he joins the Nights Watch.

Most of the song has been withheld from reader with the opening stanza our only clue:  High in the halls of the kings who are gone, Jenny would dance with her ghosts...   Jennys song would not start with her death, but her childhood.  The kings who are gone are not Targaryens, but those of the First Men, Starks, or perhaps the first Nights Watch.  The halls could be Harrenhall, Winterfell, or the Nightfort.  Whatever the true contents of Jennys song, Rhaegar had unknowingly provided enough clues for Benjen Stark to find his ghosts and hatch his secret quest for revenge.

Benjen rises quickly in the ranks of the Nights Watch to become First Ranger, which in turn gives him the freedom to explore the abandon castles on the wall, like the mysterious Nightfort.  As First Ranger, he spends much time north of the wall, not to fight wildlings, but to find The Others.  

Perhaps it was a forgotten pact with The Others, or a magic item that gives him dominion over them, a horn that wakes the sleepers, either way, Benjen is now in league with The Others.  
Benjen and The Others begin building their army by killing Wildlings, adding them to their army of the dead.  To bring this growing army south, they have to open the wall.  

To do this, they need an ice dragon, so they devise a drag trap.  (Presuming there will be a dragon trap in the forthcoming book.)  Knowing that their enemies would burn a fallen dragon on the battlefield, they set the trap on a frozen lake.  Moreover, to raise a dead dragon from the bottom of the lake, they needed chains, chains most likely taken from one of the abandoned castles along the wall before Benjens change.  (If this happens in the book, Benjens sacrifice to save Jon is most likely faked to make Jon think he had escaped when he was actually let go.  Benjen may also have the ability to control wights and had them intentionally gather around him.  Maybe he married a female Other as part of the pact, giving her his soul, making him half wight.  There are a lot of maybes here, but Benjen could be key in the next book.)

With only a couple surviving Targaryens, why would Benjen go to such lengths for revenge?  He does not just blame the Targaryens for the many Stark deaths; he blames the Lannisters, the Daynes, the whole lot not connected to the First Men.  Benjen ultimately wants to eradicate anyone not connected to the old Gods, avenging all the First Men, the Children of the Forest, and Jenny.

I'm sure people have mentioned this before on this sub, but I can't help but continuing to image the shocked and devastated look on her face. Not similar to when Viserion died where she couldn't move and was having a hard time processing what she just saw, but more like a 'it can't be.' look since she'll know right away who it is when she hears that dragon noise coming from a distance when the Army of the Dead is standing out of Winterfell on the battlefield and the Night King arrives flying fast on Viserion's back. I'm sure it will shook the other characters as well.

Although I'm still kind of surprised that it never crossed Jon's mind to tell Dany that Night King could use Viserion as a weapon if he was able to get his hand on its corpse. Maybe the fact that he sunk in the lake made him believe he couldn't get a hold of him since the White Walkers and the wights can't swim. Regardless, I'm very interested to see her reaction.

His vision and life fades as the last of weirwood trees die to the frost. The screen fades to black...

Bran wakes up in a comfy bed looks at his digital clock, it's 7:45 he's going to be late to school! Cathryn Stark comes in and tells him to wake up, get dressed and get to school young man. During a rushed breakfast his dad Ned Stark wishes Bran, and his siblings, Sandra Stark, Ana Stark, Robert Stark, and their adopted brothers, Jonathan, and Theodore a good day, as he goes to work as the boss of the local nuclear power plant.

Bran arrives at school and is scolded by his teacher for being late, ""Brandon were you up all night reading again, you look exhausted!"", Brandon replies, ""No teacher, I had a horrible nightmare, all of my family and friends died to horrible creatures, there were dragons, wars, Carl and Dany were in love, and so were the lancaster twins!"". Carl overhears and cries, ""Ew no I would never ever ever like Dany, the weird lizard girl, she's gross, and dumb, and she has cooties, and she has a boys name"", ""well its not like I could ever compete with your horse you love so much you dumb stupid idiot"" Dany replies.
The teacher unsettled by the unruly class, raises his heft, ""Alright children quiet down, stop fighting, Brandon don't say such things about the lancaster twins it's not nice to spread such rumours, but it seems you had an interesting dream young Brandon"". At this point the camera reveals that the teacher is non other than George RR. Martin, who is now looking straight at the viewer, ""Maybe you should write it all down, it could be an incomplete book series, or TV series"", at the final word George winks at the audience.

The screen fades and a looney toons closing slide pops up and George taking the place of porky pig says ""t-t-t-t-that's all folks"", he wasn't stuttering though, he was actually having a heart attack, and he dies, this is his actual death.

At the end of everything, I think she's doing to get the exact opposite of what she wanted - what she wants now. 

If there's any hope for happy endings in Westros, I think Sansa weds Tyrion for real this time. Tyrion isn't pretty, Casterly Rock doesn't have any gold and he doesn't seem to want money, and his ambition is to serve Danny.

Yes the issue with cersei and be dealt with after if the final conflict is a human one and while I think it is possible I also think it could go either way as it is still highly likely the final conflict will be the white walkers.

But if so that would mean cersei would have to be dealt with so that is why I think Jon and Dany could send some men to deal with her the only way they will be able to win this war is if Cersei is out of the picture and I thunk they could send Gendry with some forces to deal with her along with Arya and the hound. 

So why do I think this. Well I think it would be Poetic if Gendry was to usurp the throne like his father did except this time it will be to usurp the mad queen and gendry may possibly get the stark girl in the end. Also Jon and Dany will be too busy with the WW'S so they can not go do it themselves perhaps they could give gendry the last living baratheon a chance to get his birthright. Jaime could also go with him to help lead the forces Jon and Dany send with him (which means he can still fulfill the valonqar prophecy but weather or not that is a smart move I'll leave up to you).

The Hound will want to go for obvious reasons and arya will also want to get some vengeance on cersei and also maybe protect gendry.",17,10,False,spoiler,,,,,

If I'm not mistaken, he was one of Gregor Clegane's captives at Harrenhal and when Clegane bailed he killed everyone and Qyburn was left for dead. Rob Stark/his wife/Northerners found Qyburn half dead and healed him. He serves under Roose Bolton until Jaime comes, heals Jamie, and then goes with him to King's Landing supposedly in hopes to get his chain back. And he eventually ends up being Cersei's #1 bff. 

My question is, shouldn't Qyburn feel indebted to Starks/Northerners cause he would have definitely died without them tending to his wounds? Not to mention that it was Clegane/Lannisters that held him captive, probably tortured him, and attempted to kill him. So why would he go against the people who saved his life and join the people who tried to kill him? Just so he'd get his chain back, get into a position of power, and be able to practice his creepy experiments? ",9,13,False,spoiler,,,,,

This seizure moment Bran warged to see, in the distant past, seemed to have been *caused* by what happened when Hodor held the door in reality, ~20 years later. 

In that single moment, as a child, because of an event that happens in the distant future, Hodor is mentally and developmentally transformed completely, for the rest of his life. . 

This has big implications, right?, that future events can literally and physically alter reality in the past.  

Is it Bran who causes it?   Could it happen in other situations?  

Apologies if this has already been discussed on other threads...  Thanks in advance for your thoughts &amp; insights!  

Cheers to Hodor!  Hodor!

I love Game of Thrones, and have ever since I read the first book when I was 8 years old back in 2004! I've wanted to get a GoT tattoo, but nothing ever really interested me besides the Stark Logo, as Jon Snow is my favorite character. Until this season, I didn't know If I would ever find something, until I saw this Logo:



 https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5_AidT-yBGI/hqdefault.jpg






It led me to searching, until I finally found this one and decided this is the one: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DGE6bk3VwAAUDiO.jpg





I am not sure how it goes with tattoos, but I planned on getting it on my right forearm, as I really like the logo and want to be able to see it, and having it look just like this picture, except subtract the words and make the wolf grey. A lot of people have given me mixed reviews on it, and so I figured why not get opinions from the people I identify with the most, and that is the people who love GoT as much as I do! So please if you can, let me know what you think of the design; if I should get it; and if I need to get permission from whoever created this design! I get on here almost everyday, and would be really indebted if you guys could reciprocate some love with some feedback!Thank you so much to whoever looks at this!",7,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Melisandre predicted her own death when she returns to Westeros and Jon had promised to kill her when she returns.

What if Jon kills her and in turn loses his own life?! Maybe he would even do it knowing it would mean his own death because of his honor. Also he might be ready to die at that point when he has found out that he boned his aunt (/sister?).

Im not an expert on Westerosi history, but Im guessing the realm was better prepared to face the White Walkers in past winters than they are currently. The Kingdom is at war and many houses and armies have died in the crossfire. 

For such a gritty and unforgiving TV Series Id find it a little unrealistic if the White Walkers were defeated swiftly and relatively quickly. They have been built up and shown to be a force to be reckoned with. Realistically their siege of the seven kingdoms would be a long and tiring one. It took them literally seven seasons to conquer the land north of the wall.

My question is: will the TV Show find some way to have the White Walkers defeated in combat in less than six episodes after the buildup they have given us? Will they be smart and hit us with some plot twist like the White Walkers are actually allies to House Stark and have marched south to destroy the realm after the Starks lost power in the North?

Or will we have a time jump sometime in Season 8 (before the epilogue) which shows us what the Seven Kingdoms looks like after years of war with the White Walkers? Personally I find that six episodes is not nearly enough to finish the series, but Im not a professional show runner or bookwriter so there is a good chance my opinion is moot.

So I'm pretty  big into the fantasy/action/adventure genre.

I'm looking to try and start this show since I constantly hear great things but I've got a question or two.

I've heard that the show is very involved in ""political drama"" of the fantasy world it discusses. Is the show entirely set upon this ""political drama"" and tends to drag? Or is it more along the lines of the political drama influences the story/fantasy and adventure aspects.

I'm really looking for something more along the lines of a ""grand adventure/journey"" with different magical places being discovered/loads of world building. 

Similar to Lord of The Rings style.

In short, does this series mainly focus on politics with a background of slight adventure/fantasy, or does the political aspect influence the adventure/fantasy within the show! ",15,0,False,self,,,,,

I just finished rewatching season 1-5. One thing that always bothered me was the way Arya left Sandor Cleagane to die in S04E10. I always wondered if it was hatred or love that didn't let her kill him.

During the scene, when he begs her to kill him. She steals his coin purse. And he tries to take it back! Do you remember that in one of the previous episodes, he punches the farmer they stay at to the ground and steals his purse? When Arya gets angry at him he says ""dead men dont need silver"". 

When Sandor tries to take the purse back from Arya, does it give her hope that he will survive? 

I am completely biased, I would love to see Arya admit that she cared for the Hound, and i would love to see them become a duo again. The theory is thin but what do you think? ",11,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I just finished A Dance with Dragons and I thought I'd post my thoughts.


First of all, wow.  This is a very complicated story with a plethora of characters and backstory.  I don't know how you all keep your facts straight, as I constantly had to refer to the wiki as I was reading to remind myself who someone was or brush up on the backstory of a character.  Martin definitively puts a lot of time into his stories.


I thoroughly enjoyed the first 3 books.  Granted, they all started off pretty slow and I struggled to retain interest through chunks of them, but the stories culminated nicely towards the latter 1/3 of the books.  In my opinion, I don't see how a Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons needed to be 2 separate books.  Sure there's a lot of chapters in each, but the story really drags out.  Also, it's a bit overwhelming having so many small side-plots that I have to keep up with.  All the Dorne and Iron Men chapters could have been summed up in some sort of news briefing during a Kings Landing scene, in my opinion.  Also, after finishing these last two books, it feels like the story is branching out like a tree with a thousand branches, yet it's starting to feel like the plot advancement has slowed to a leisurely Sunday walk through a park.  In the first book, we follow the Starks and witness the descent of the kingdom into chaos.  By the time we reach the last 2 books, some characters move around a bit and maybe someone dies.


The imagination of Martin is astounding, but I think his books would tell a more engaging story if he kept the plot more streamlined and advanced it at a more consistent speed.  I also dislike how I had to start guessing which character had the POV when I opened a new chapter.  I read ""The Kingmaker"" or some such, and I have to spend the next page or two trying to figure out who the heck I'm reading about.  Might not have been so bad if we were only talking about 4-5 characters.  Instead, we have:


**Bran:** Running North from Winterfell and ends up north of the wall with some magic tree dude

**Rickon:** Ran from Winterfell, and is currently hiding somewhere.

**Davos:** Acting as the Hand of Stannis, heads to White Harbor and supposedly goes out looking for Rickon

**Theon:** Broken by Ramsay and escapes

**Asha:** Captured by Stannis

**Mellisandre:** Who knows what she's up to...

**Jon:** Tries to live up to the mantle of the commander of the Nights Watch, but apparently gets betrayed

**Victarion:** I honestly don't know why he's a POV character.  All we know is that he has some sort of dragon horn.  Uninteresting character.

**Arys Oakhart:** Pointless POV character

**Arianne Martell:** See above

**Aegon Tragaryen:** Arriving at Westeros

**Selmy:** Overthrew Hizdar, currently seems to be acting as the ruler

**Daenerys:** She has a lot of character development, but it doesn't feel like her story is going anywhere

**Jaime:** Probably dead

**Brienne:** Probably killed Jaime

**Tyrion:** Now a sellsword

**Catelyn:** Zombie mode thanks to Beric, who is now dead

**Sansa:** Who the heck knows what's going on with her...

**Arya:** Training in Braavos

**Cersei:** Awaiting Trial

**Quentyn Martell:** Seems pointless POV character - probably dead after having practically zero affect on story line.

**Sam:** Down South doing who-knows what now.  There seems to be an entire sub-plot with the mysterious shape-shifter down there.

Plus all the many now-dead characters.  I've probably missed a few as well.


My point is, there's just too much going on and not enough plot advancement.  I like it when I read a story and I feel the characters are going somewhere, like there's something just over the horizon of the next chapter awaiting them.  Instead, it feels like even the author doesn't even know where they're going.


Just my 2 thoughts.  Overall, I enjoyed the series, but felt it was lacking.

Was the death actually an accident? I think in the book (haven't read) she kills him cause she knows it is roberts?

2) Why didn't Cersei or Jamie try to kill Bran when he survived the fall. Seems careless

3) Why were the Tarly's on Aegon's side during the rebellion?

4) Do you think Arya will try to kill the hound again? He is still on her list. 

5) Why didn't Robert try to kill Aemon targaryan? 

6) Did Shae only sleep with Tywin to get back at Tyrion? Or did Tywin illicit her. Who approached who? 

7) Did Drogo's witch doctor actually cause Daenarys stillborn child? 

8) Did the witch doctor actually cause Drogo to die? Was he going to die anyway if she didn't do anything? Couldn't she just have done nothing? What DID she do to him? 

9) Rickon and Bran have the same dream about their dad in the crypt. Does Rickon have the same power as Bran?

10) Did Daenarys try to commit suicide when she went into the fire with khal drogo? She didn't know she would survive I assume? 

11) The guy who tried to poison Mellisandre, he was ok dying? He drank from the cup knowing it was poison?!

12) How did Tyrion get the city watch to betray their commander and install Bron. I thought they answer only to the king.

13) How did Jaqen get caught when we first meet him? Any theories? Seems like he could've easily escaped if he wanted to. 

14) Did littlefinger actually want Ned dead? 

15) Would Stannis have won if lady in red on ship when they lost to wildfire?

16) Why did Mance join the wildlings?

17) When did Roose Bolton decide to betray the Starks?

18) Jamie kills his own cousin in s2e7 to escape, in the middle of his redemption ark. Thoughts?

19) Why did Stannis fleet at blackwater only have 25k men. Didn't he get like 100k from his brother when he died? Or even half of that?

20) Read theory that Tywin made tyrion hand because grooming him in case Jamie dead (captured). In s3e1 he's mean to him again. Is it cause he already struck a deal with Roose Bolton?

21) Barriton Selmy joins Daenarys just cause he served her father. Isn't that a bit of stretch considering he was the mad king?

22) In the show, why do the white walkers re arrange the dead bodies in special patterns/symbols like a sumoning circle

23) Who contacted who with roose bolton + tywin alliance?

24) How did high garden fall so easily in season 7? Shouldn't they be decently defended and able to last a seige? We never see effective seige weapons anyway. 

25) S3e4 varys/olenna are talking and have an ""obvious solution for Sansa"". What is it?

26) How exactly does Daenarys control the dragons? As in, why are they suddenly following her, when before she couldn't control them. 

27) S4E1 with symptons did qyburn help cersie with. Was she pregnant with her cousins baby?

28) How did Janos become head of nights watch. I thought you renounce all titles and such.

29) S4E6 a big problem with the dragons was them roaming and killing livestock/pets/children. Is this not a problem anymore?

30) Varys was helping spy on and try to kill Daenarys early on in the show. Then he decides to help her? When does he change his mind. I know it's before he meets her in person. 

31) Did Ramsay want to be a bolton just to inherit stuff? He clearly didn't care about his dad

32) How did stannis' men get beyond the wall. Sail?

33) How can 2800 cavalry (Stannis men he bought) take on 100,000 wildlings

34) Why is Varys helping the ""other side"" (good guys) if Tywin+tommen could effectively rule.

35) Do you guys think Tommen+Margaery would have been a good king/queen? 

36) Why did little finger give sansa to the boltons?

37) How is Jamie controlling lannister army. Thought he can't inherit cause he's still Kingsguard (after dad dead)

38) Would the winterfell people/soldiers captured when Ramsay took winterfell fight for the boltons? Or were they all killed? 

39) Why can't Margery order the kingsguard to free her brother? When Cersei was queen she had a lot of men/guards under her command. And not just Lannister army. 

40) S5E10 - why isn't drogon helping her? She wants food or something? Or at least take her home? I thought she has control of them now 

41) Does hodor actually know what will happen to him? 

42) Was he holding the door cause bran was warging into him? Or cause he was told to. If the latter, they basically sacrificed him? 

43) Why didn't Cersei have the lannister army ot city watch storm the sept long before (immediately after she was ""returned"")

44) How does dothraki work. Is there just one horde and one leader? Or a bunch all the time

45) What rumor is qyburn talking about in s6e8?

46) What happens to the tully forces at riverrun after they surrendered.

47) When did Sansa and Arya start working together? Who approached who?

Obviously Littlefinger and Varys are two of the most prolific players. They're linked together often as chaos vs order although in my opinion Littlefinger sewed the chaos and Varys watered it for his own ends. 

Littlefingers master stroke in my opinion was Jon Arryns death, well played and caused tons of devastation while putting him in charge of the Vale, the one land that managed to survive most of the wars. 

Varys - A lot went down at that Tourney, who knows how much a hand Vary's had in it all. 
- *alerted Aerys to the possibility that his son Rhaegar was using attendance at the tourney at Harrenhal as a pretext to rally lords to his cause in removing Aerys as king. This caused Aerys to attend the tournament, the first time he had left the Red Keep since the Defiance of Duskendale.[18]*

Most often though Varys is the keeper of info who gives out snippets to get the effect he wanted. His effect on the story is harder for me to trace...

There is also Tywin who I would say is another fantastic player, he was treated poorly by the king but managed to take him down and get revenge on his whole family while putting his own on the throne without much risk or cost of his own. It fell apart for him on the toilet but he had played the game very well. You might call sitting out Robert's war and riding in at the end his master stroke. 

There is a school of thought that say Tywin likely got in Rhaegars head and encouraged him against his father (in the books) which both drove the mad king mad and caused Rhaegar to be willing to do what he did with Lyanna and rebel/cause trouble (as noted in the wiki above). If Tywin had a hand in that then he is Machiavellian to the core since Roberts Rebellion somehow benefited him as much as Robert and in the end more. 

If the above about Vary's is true, either he worked with Vary's on Rhaegar/Mad king splitting them apart or more likely Vary's did what he did with Littlefinger (he knew about Jon Arryn as well and stood silent I believe) and allowed Tywin to make trouble so he could try and benefit from it. 

In that case Varys really played both Littlefinger and Tywin. 

Which deception (theorized or proven) do you think was the smartest and which player played it best?

Melisandre is said to be over a century old and we see that in season 6 episode 1. She also takes off the Asshaii necklace we see her wearing often. When Kinmara shows up in Meereen during the door she is wearing the same necklace. Would this imply that the necklace has some mystical power? I would assume so but I also wonder if it could just be a fashion statement.

I am familiar with the notion that season 4 episode 7 when Melisandre is talking to Selyse that she may have been in her true form. On the other hand maybe the blue potion actually meant something?",8,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

Hear that guys, The Night King not the Night'S King. See that there that's a possessive ""S"" because these character's are not the same person. The Night king is a First Man who was turned into the leader of the White Walkers by Leaf during the First Men invasion of the Children Of The Forest's homes. Meanwhile the Night's King was a First Man who was the 13th Lord Commander of the night's watch, an order founded to fight the Night King and his armies after the long night, and after the Night King WAS the Night King. I have now seen so many videos, posts and people refer to the Night King as the Night's King, with that cheeky possessive ""S"", that I literally full on nerd raged and had to post about it on Reddit, please just stop. If you see anyone make this mistake, especially on a theory video or worse, a lore video, just let them know that their mistake is adding another slit to my already mangled wrists.

Those who did not know Ned would not have known his sence of honor would protect the young Targaryens. Robert would not have liked this either.

Also list any pros and cons the team has and who didn't make it.

**My choice:**

- **Tormund Giantsbane**: knows most of the lands beyond the wall, team **scout**

- **Jon ""the White Wolf"" Snow**: Has experience fighting white walkers (and killing them), previously Lord Commander of the Night's Watch so has connections. Has a ***Valyrian steel sword, LONGCLAW***.

- **Ser Gregor ""the Mountain"" Clegane**: basically an 8ft tall one-man army, performs the role as the team **tank**

- **Ser Arthur ""the Sword of the Morning"" Dayne**: Nuff' said. Team **warrior**. The only downside is that we don't know if ***DAWN*** can kill the army of the dead since it isn't actually Valyrian steel.

- **Ser ""Bold"" Jon Roxton**: Fucking badass from the Dance of the Dragons who cut Hugh Hammer (huge guy who used a hammer, basically = Robert in his prime) in half with his ***Valyrian steel sword, ORPHAN-MAKER***. Also team **warrior**.

- **Lord Randyll Tarly**: team **strategist**, has ***Valyrian steel sword HEARTSBANE***. He might be an egotistical dick (bit of an understatement, really) but he knows what he's doing considering he beat Robert (in his prime) and the entire Baratheon combined land force with only the Reach's vanguard once.

- **Lord Brynden ""Bloodraven"" Rivers**: exceptional swordsman with ***Valyrian steel sword DARK SISTER***, exceptional archer with his weirwood bow, ruthless commander and formerly Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. Has been beyond the wall before. **Is a WARG, which makes him a massively superior team scout to Tormund**. He would be my team **leader**.

**Pros:**

- five people have Valyrian steel or a suitable equivalent.
- a warg is on the team
- at least two great warriors (Arthur Dayne, Jon Roxton, etc.)
- an 8ft-tall one-man army (the Mountain)
- three people (Tormund, Jon Snow, Brynden Rivers) who have been beyond the wall before
- Two team strategists who are pragmatic and very competent, and have Valyrian steel (i.e. Randyll Tarly and Brynden Rivers)

**Cons:**

- a glaring one, *they will not get along*. Jon Snow would hate working with the Mountain, Arthur Dayne *might* look down on some of the others as being less virtuous knights, Randyll Tarly is racist to free folk and would hate being told what to do by a bastard, especially one as infamous as Brynden Rivers.
- the Mountain would just be there because he's a big guy (for you) and more importantly loves killing so would do something stupid which would make the wights gang up on him and make his purpose in the team useless.
- we don't know if Dawn can kill the army of the dead, because it's not Valyrian steel. We *could* assume it does but there's no way to tell because we've only seen it be used against living humans.
- Randyll Tarly and more importantly, Brynden Rivers are extremely ruthless tacticians and would not be closed off from the possibility that they need to ""sacrifice"" someone for the sake of the team.

**Who didn't make it**:

- **Thoros of Myr**: would have been a team medic but got ruled out in favour of the Mountain. If the Mountain *or* Arthur Dayne don't work out so well, I'll replace one of them (probably the Mountain) with Thoros.

- **King Stannis Baratheon**: arguably superior commander to Randyll Tarly and *slightly* more amiable (in spite of his lack of social skills) but didn't make it because Tarly has a Valyrian steel sword.

- **Ser Barristan Selmy**: Literally the only reason he isn't part of the team is because Jon Roxton has a Valyrian steel sword and he doesn't.

- **Ser Jaime Lannister**: great swordsman, probably marginally better than Jon Roxton and now has a Valyrian steel sword (i.e. Widow's Wail) but I don't want to get into the conundrum of which Jaime we're talking about.

- **Ser Gwayne Corbray**: Knight of the Kingsguard in the First Blackfyre Rebellion and showed that he deserved the esteemed position by dueling *Daemon fucking Blackfyre* in single combat for an entire *hour*. Even if he eventually lost, he is still an undoubted badass. Depending or not whether Dawn works on white walkers and/or wights, if it doesn't, then I'm happy to replace Arthur Dayne with this guy.

**No dragons please.**

It was a strange and personally unexpected round of results, and with over 500 votes here we now have our two finalists:

The Hound Vs Jon Snow

Now this draw ended up 58.6% to 41.4% in favour of The Hound, so he will be our first finalist rather surprisingly in my opinion! 

Jaime Lannister Vs Davos Seaworth  

This was a little more of a one sided affair as it ended up finishing 62.8% to 37.2% in favour of Jaime! 

So here we are now, onto the final:

All the major characters gathered together, and they splitted as the story progressed and as this world expanded . As we saw in Season 7 , all characters have reached or are progressing towards Winterfell. Arya, Bran, Sansa are already there. Jaime has left King's Landing and might be heading North ,Sam and Gilly have reached Winterfell ,Jon and Dany might head towards The North too . The army of the dead have destroyed the wall (though it might happen in some other manner in the books, we have to wait for that) and so they are  heading towards Winterfell too . I also see some possibilities that Cersei might lead her army to Winterfell,  as she has no major enemies left in the south, to crush the last of her enemies, the Starks,Dany and her dragons . So the civil war amongst the Great Houses might end there too. I also think about some possibility that Cersei might die at Winterfell , though it's completely my opinion. So the ""Great War"" between the living and the dead to might happen to protect Winterfell, because the White Walkers bring winter with them and ""winter"" might ""fell"" over there.

Free folk and Northern houses: Tormund and some other Northern Lord cuz Jon would lead all the armies collectively.

Like maybe this could work as it would be a big misdirect Just like how we all thought Robb would defeat Joffrey only to die, Just like how we thought Arya would become a faceless man only for it not being what she thought and her ultimately leaving. This could fit as we all think Jaime or Tyrion is the Valonqar only for Jaime to be killed by Cersei via Poison or the Mountain.

If this is right I believe then either Arya, Euron, or Cersei's unborn child would be the Valonqar instead. Tyrion is still a possibility too but I think he is too obvious. ",5,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

+ what is the deal with those white walkers. Villian is hero from the other side, so they cant be all bad, yet they look so bad at the moment. How can they not be bad?
+ the prophecy of Azor Ahai, all of us know that there is no such thing as a white knight savior in Martin belief, and yet the prophecy is so intriguing, how can it not be real. (quick answer: to me it is just a rabbit hole to bait all the fantasy fans).
+ what is the bitter sweet ending all about. 

So Im gonna try to make one theory while waiting for the upcoming season. So stop reading if you dont want to go down this rabbit hole.



It is widely known that Martin made this novel based of the wars of roses, and so many have made their theory based on the real events of this war. But no one has made a comparison of Vietnam war to his work? Vietnam war is one of the most influential factor to his work, it made him an anti war believer, it is one of the most intriguing, most bloody war mankind has ever faced and it is irrelevant to Got? I dont think so my friends.

First I agree that the first half of the novel is widely based on wars of roses, but I see the final battle for the dawn is mainly inspired by Vietnam war.

Let face it, the battle between the evil North and free South. The war which is so important that if fails the whole world will be forever in ice (domino theory that started Vietnam war). If it isnt about Vietnam War, then seriously I dont know what it is about.

Dany to me represents America. Lets see, she was once dominated by a royal brother, growing up to be one of the most powerful force in the world. She freed slaves, liberated cities, every time she opened her mouth she talked about freedom and the liberty, but everywhere she went, she left chaos behind. She also has a powerful air force and a knack for violence and like to burn people alive ( Im talking about Nepal bombs in Vietnam). Lets be real, who better represents America that an young powerful incest queen? ( incest in a sense that Americans love themselves little too much, and queen because we have too much drama -lol).

Westeros is South Vietnam during 1960s, completely in chaos with coup after coup, it rigged with corruptions, bribery and scandals, prostitutes. It is a lot like Kings Landing to me. And at once point, South Vietnam actually had a priest as their president, he was completely insane and manipulative and he died in a coup that overtook him. 

And wrights and white walkers, an army of the deaths, mass in number,  bony corps with broken weapons and dirty clothes, it alot sounds like a fearless, ready to die peasants army of the Commy to me. During the whole show, we just saw just a long line of wrights walking down the south ( like VC walking down HoChiMinh trail to fight).

So what? That means white walker is going to win, the whole world gonna be in a never ending winter? Answer is no and that is my point. In Vietnam war, the north won, and domino effect did not happen, in the end Communism did not last in Vietnam either, there was a sense of freedom planted in the country, in the end, the nation opened up and healed itself, well it still one party country so Westeros still gonna be king or queen country but freer i guess.

So how that translates into Got, so Dany and Cersei and Jon will form an alliance, they will help each other for a time, but ultimately they will fail, the alliance will not hold up (betrayal or abandoned?). From all the crappy things they did in those previous books, chance to heroically win against an undead army is just unrealistic. Dany and Cersei dies. Dany will pass on the torch to some else to keep fighting of course (like few generations of US presidents) very likely Tyrion. The final battles will be a lot like the final battles in 1975 in Vietnam, strong holds fall after strong holds. Brandon will fall into white walker hand and Westeros will be in complete control by white walker. We will see some brutality in the country, white walker force people to turn white/wrights, hunger everywhere. It is all hopeless, Jon and Tyrion run away,  from oversea will try to attack again, they may be find the way to influence Bran, helps him wake up. And Bran will plant the seed in all the peasant which were force to turn white/wright, helped them wake up and drives all the white walkers away. Or in a realistic way become a peace broker just like 8000 years ago or again like Vietnam War. For the TV show, the war cant be for years, so they will shorten that down, but for the books that i see how it would end, it also fits rumor plots for next season. So I either be so right or absolutely wrong.

In the end, may be some random dude gonna be king, i dont think it will be Bran though. Or maybe all are dead, and one smart guy takes all the credit and make himself king. If that the case then maybe it will be Euron Grayjoy. Then someone will expose what a fraud he is and dethrone him (just like Nixon). Azor Ahai, battle for the dawn, they are all just a conspiracy just like domino theory drives people insane. They certainly have some truth, but in the end, they have little to do with the story.

The white walkers by all means are no good, in Got there is no such side that is all-good or all-evil, but they just a tool (literally) so yea, no hero or villain bull crap from them. They represent Communist power/system that North Vietnam borrowed from China and Russia (the children), it destructive but in the end did not last.

There had to be a choice between Ghost and Wun Wun in BoB in S6. Come S7, there was a lot of Dragon action and obviously the long awaited Polar Bear (a long time wish of D&amp;D)..

So whoever is more knowledgeable on this, please share your thoughts on what is the CGI cost we are dealing with here. There would have been a conscious decision to cut off Ghost vs. what's included in that show. How much would it cost to include large scale action sequences with CGI and how much would it be to include Ghost or Wun Wun or a Polar Bear.. 

We know the budget is huge, though not unlimited.. But in a do or die battle like the BoB, it did not make sense to cut off Ghost from the war sequence as he was Jon's companion all along until then.. Even in S7 they could have very well added the one scene with Ghost instead of editing it out.. Wouldn't it look odd for Ghost to be back in S8 after being not on screen for so many important events? Does the cost really warrant the loss of continuation of Jon's companion character?",8,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

I am currently writing about the inexperienced Bran Stark as seen in Season 1 episode 1 who is laughed at by his older brothers but is inspired by his father, a much older and experienced role model and I am also writing about the scene where Ser Barristan Selmy is dismissed from his lifelong vow of being a devoted knight of the Kingsguard by King Joffrey on the grounds of old age and his inability to protect Robert. If anyone could help me find additional scenes I could study and include that would be great!
I personally enjoy the show myself however I am not too knowledgeable when it comes to the lore of the show and the characters so it would be great if I could get insight from those who truly love this series and I hope I can get some from you guys! Thank you all in advance!",13,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

I would totally go for Jorah. I haven't finished reading the books, but so far it seems like GRRM's concept of their relationship was pretty ambiguous: maybe they end together, maybe not. The show screenwriters put her up with Jon, and I personally didn't like that. The romance was too fast paced. There wasn't that much chemistry between the two (like Jon and Ygritte). It felt like the typical young pretty girl meets young pretty boy situation we've seen a million times on screen.
This is just my opinion, but if I found myself in Daenerys's shoes I would absolutely drag Jorah to my room. No one's going to protect her the way he does (saving her life more times than anyone else), or care for her, cherish her and love her more than he does.",25,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

  So I know it's a heavy stoner theory, but it's supported by explicit evidences in the show. My theory is that Jon Snow was not resurrected by the lord of light, he's in fact immune to death by himself. I haven't seen this theory elsewhere, so let's begin.

  Just like Daenerys is immune to fire, Jon Snow is immune to death; maybe because he's a mix of Targ and Stark, that would be my only explaination for it; that's the weakest point of my theory, I admit it, so it would need more research, perhaps from book readers. Jon could also be blessed by the gods with the gift of immortality since he is the prince that was promised.

Now for the evidences: Jon Snow refused to die in multiples occasion; while at first glance you could think that it's lazy writting, it make sense if you believe this theory. Jon survived multiple situations where most people would have died, especially in the world of GOT.

-He had pneumonia as a baby, Catelyn thought he had no chance to live, but he did.

-He survied 4 arrow in the chest shot by Ygritte; some arrows  clearly touched vital organs. It's ambiguous since you don't know if Ygritte wanted to kill him or not. But when you shoot someone 4 times in the chest, it's for the kill; but I leave the benefice of the doubt for this case.

-A Thenn banged Jon's head hard into an anvil during the watcher on the wall's episode. Jon kept on fighting and wasn't bothered by it.

-A white walker hit Jon in the chest using the non sharp edge of his spear during Hardhome. Given how strong white walkers and their weapons are, his insides should be gellified.

-During the battle of the bastards he was stomped on by a dozens persons, but he managed to survive. 
 
-During Beyond the wall, he fell into freezing water, being dragged by multiple wights. After going out of the water, still wet, he still survived the trip back to the wall while the weather was frozen hell.

-Now there is of course the case of his death; here is my interpretation. He lost so much blood that his body went numb, he also froze during the night. So, during the following day, his body slowly defrosted, and he slowly regenerated, Wolverine style. The red woman's ritual was just a coincidence.

- Robert: He was a warrior, plain and simple. He was not even aware of the game (or just did not care enough to play).

- Robb Stark: Smarter than Robert, but tends to not think of the consequences of his actions. Average intelligence at best.

- Joffrey: Must be the stupidest person to ever sit on the Iron Throne. Way below average intelligence.

- Tommen: He never thought with his head at all. Perhaps if Tywin had more time with him or if he had the chance to grow up he'd do okay, but putting a lovestruck teenager on the throne's not a good idea.

- Balon Greyjoy: Asha described him as a ""brave man but bad lord"". He did not make quite the smart decisions either.

- Dany: While she is not stupid, she tends not to think things through. She decided to meet Cersei with all her might to intimidate her and did not even realize she made her enemy aware of the fact that her Dragons are very much vulnerable, achieving exactly the opposite.

- Cersei: Not as smart as Tywin or Tyrion, she's made stupid moves like giving power to the Sparrows but I'd say she's still way above average intelligence, especially compared to her predecessors on the throne.

- Stannis: I'd say he's one of the best contenders here. While sacrificing Shireen out of blind faith was a very low point for him, he has also had some bright ideas occasionally.

- Jon: He is a special case because while not stupid his sense of honor sometimes leads him to the wrong choice like pledging allegiance to Dany in front of Cersei. Also in the battle of the bastards he got emotional instead of thinking with his head and this almost cost him everything. I'd say he's of average intelligence while Ramsay is probably above average.

- Olenna Tyrell: Probably ahead of every ruler as far as intelligence goes. Then again Mace was the head of the Tyrells until the Sept incident...

- Doran: He looked wise but we did not see him enough to make out a verdict... Ellaria is driven solely by vengeance and intelligence is not her strong suit though.

There are many examples in the series to support this, with many characters who shouldve or couldve died in water, only to somehow survive.

- Most recently, **Jon Snow** beyond the wall, when hes tackled by the wights into the frozen lake, and somehow doesnt drown (or drowns but comes back again), is shielded by the water until the wights start to leave, and then the drowned god spits him out of the lake.
- **Arya** gets stabbed by the Waif, and falls off a bridge into water, is protected by the water until the Waif leaves, and then climbs out of the water.
- **Jamie** charges at Drogon, and Drogon is ready to kill Jamie with dragon fire, until Bronn tackles him into the lake.  Jamie shouldve drowned in that lake, weighed down by his armor.  But somehow after the water shields them from the heat of the dragon fire, the drowned god spits them out on the opposite end of the lake.
- **Davos**, at the Battle of the Blackwater, falls into the bay and is protected from the wildfire, and is then spit out by the drowned god onto the rocks, where hes eventually rescued as the sole survivor.
- **Tyrion**, when the stone men attack him and Jorah, falls into the water to protect him from being touched and infected.
- **Theon**, when Euron attacks and takes Yara, throws himself into the sea, where hes protected from death until being rescued by the iron born.

Edit: **TL;DR:**  The drowned god has protected/saved many of the main characters throughout the series who should've died in water.  He could be the most merciful god in the series.",47,50,False,spoiler,,,,,

after rewatching, the way aria talks to sansa all the time seems very unlikely to me. 

especially the scene with the knife. why would she hand sansa that knife, it is so odd. you would think she sees bigger problems other than her sister, threatening her sisters life. 

obviously the pay off in the end - lord baelish's death - is very cool. it just seems like the whole story line running up to that moment is nothing but a setup.

after aria shows her that letter, sansa should have said ""so what do you want me to do? what would be the right thing at this point?""

what could aria say to that.. it makes no sense to me.",63,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

Firstly, about prophecy; in the novels, Aegon V (Egg) Targaryen was famously well-read, some may say bookish, and had a great interest in prophecy. His first son Prince Duncan married a girl that brought her friend, the woods witch, to King's Landing, and this prophetic witch told of the Prince that was Promised, who would be born of Targaryen blood from the line of Egg's son Aerys (II) and daughter Rhaella. Aegon forced the two to marry in light of this prophecy, and they had three children. This is where Rhaegar thought that he came in, and why he was so obsessed with prophecy. However, it just so happens that Dany is the child of Aerys and Rhaella. In order to forge Lightbringer, Azor Ahai had to temper it by thrusting it through the heart of his wife, to which the flaming sword was born. Dany, heartbroken, also killed her spouse, her husband Khal Drogo, and I believe that this also fits in with Melisandre's quote in chapter 10 of Clash of Kings, where she said that the wielder of this flaming sword would be born amidst smoke and salt and hatch dragons from stone, all while the stars bleed. Born at the island hosting Dragonstone, she was born amidst the salt of the sea, and ll throughout season 2 of the television program, the red comet was streaking across the sky, a bleeding star. After Dany suffocated her husband Khal Drogo, parallel to Azor Ahai killing his wife Nissa Nissa, Dany and Jorah lit a funeral pyre for Drogo, to wit Dany and her three dragon eggs joined in the fire. Dany emerged unharmed, having birthed the dragons from their petrified eggs. She was reborn amidst smoke, and now wielded her weapon of fire, her dragon children. I know that all of this is out of order, but all of the staples of the prophecy have been redone by Daenerys. And one may think that she isn't or won't be Azor Ahai because Dany doesn't fight with swords, and thus wouldn't be a wielder of Lightbringer, but I think that is why Dany will be Azor Ahai; Dany's dragons are fire made flesh, weapons of fire just as Lightbringer was, and they were drawn from the funeral pyre, essentially from Drogo, just as Azor Ahai's weapon of fire was drawn from Nissa Nissa. You, of course, may take this as you will, but I think that the clues have all been presented. ",67,7,False,spoiler,,,,,

In short, instead of Arya, Sansa secretly learns to be faceless man off screen, and will be the one to kill Cersie using Jamies face.

I've just recently gotten into the show, and this is my first post on here. I had this huge post typed out with quoted and fact and what not, but I accidently deleted it. I am not typing it again so ill just keep it short and simple and you guys can piece it together and see what you think.

So basically, in short the theory that Arya will Kill Jamie and use his face to kill Cersie is just too predicable. The shock of that plot happening came with slaying the frey's. She same climax wont be reached doing it a second time unless its spiced up a bit (No Pun intended). The scene where Sansa finds Arya's faces is just too weird and the worlds that were exchanged didn't makes sense. I believe when Arya was telling Sansa of how different their lives were and how they wanted to be other people, and furthermore how arya could be her in she wanted. Was merely a subplot to what will happen with Cersie. The whole scene in translation was meant to tell sansa that she too could be like Arya just for one time only if she wanted. Why else would Arya hand sansa the dagger and say the strange things she did. She Learned to be a faceless man and will accompany Arya to kings landing off screen, where Arya will kill Jamie, then off screen Sansa will come in and take his face, only to kiss Cersie their after. I mean I know Arya wants Cersie dead more than anyone but it is Sansa who has been tormented by her most. It's only fitting that she kills her instead. What do you guys think?",15,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

One is Cersei's exchange with Margaery in 308 Second Sons (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT9cBJ5hj8g) where she tells the story of the downfall of House Reyne and then threatens Margaery directly. I had remembered this, but had forgotten that the conversation actually takes place within the Sept itself, and also with Loras looking on in the background, the same place where Cersei will carry out her threat to destroy the Tyrells at the end of season six.

Another is Cersei's conversation with Oberyn in 405, First of His Name (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZKgxzW4J3o) when she mentions Myrcella and talks about the boat she is building for her, as Myrcella loves open water; then at the end of season five, Myrcella is ultimately poisoned (by Oberyn's family) while on a boat on open water, which had been taking her back to Cersei.

As well as Cersei's story, I also remember one of the directors saying that season four in general would have a lot of foreshadowing of future seasons, so it will be interesting to look back on it again once the series concludes and see what other hints were there.",6,7,False,spoiler,,,,,

What actually made me want to make this at first was that nobody in the EP threads took the opportunity to shitpost ""The Roose is Fastened"" or whatever the opposite of Loose is. You'd have gotten at least like 5 internet points. Dropped the ball.

I'm absolutely flabbergasted at the development of my feelings of each character. In season 1, I hated every living Lannister (except Tyrion of course because he was the cool one). Come season 6 episode 10 I find myself with my fist in the sky, in a Freddy Mercur-esque celebration as Cersei bunks her trial to drink wine and watch the show. I loved the piano soundtrack in this episode btw. I'm hoping it features more in season 7 and my girlfriend got me excited by showing me the S7 trailer, and it had that soundtrack! I thought Daenerys was the sweet and merciful character but NOPE CRUCIFY THEM! I'm also loving dark Sansa. I can see her becoming what Catelyn was to Rob, to Jon (woman with good ideas who isn't really taken entirely seriously in tactics). Stannis went from being one of my favourite characters with ""Don't touch my daughter"" to having me happy he lost to the Boltons with ""lol ok burn her anyway."" Battle of the Bastards was horrendous. Imagine being in Jon's position with people trying to kill you trapping you with your own fallen mates, and your own living mates are unknowingly trampling you to death. Christ I regret not watching this earlier so I could actually contribute to discussions.

I initially didn't watch GoT with my friends when it came out because I was all pretentious and ""It's all just naked people, why spend 1 hour on something that could take 10 minutes on pronhub?"" But I was convinced by my girlfriend to watch it. I was right about the naked people but the series has been captivating nonetheless. I've binged it more than anything else before (it's also my first non-anime/ated series so that's something I guess), and am only stopping just before S7 because of my last 2 exams coming up shortly. I look forward to meeting you all in the S8 release threads when the episodes come out at 3am here!

Yesterday I was listening to the great music pieces of the show performed by the symphony orchestra of Prague and the choir of the University of Augsburg. The concert was in Leipzig, Germany. There was also a female vocalist. 

They made breathtakingly good music for more than two hours and so many times I had goosebumps. It's just so entirely different in a house with such great acoustics (Gewandhaus). 

Among others of course they played the intro, rains of castamere and the piano piece of the season finale of the seventh season. I never realized how often ramin djawadi included the main theme as well as some pieces of rains of castamere in most of the titels so that you always recognize it.

Just wanted to share an amazing experience and I would love to know if someone else visited such a concert and to hear how their experience was! ",14,24,False,self,,,,,

I am studying history and currently writing my bachelor thesis. In it, I compare the world of GoT to the historical world. More specific I compare Tywin and Cersei Lannister to Richard of Warwick and Margaret of Anjou, both persons from The Wars of The Roses.
Besides that comparison, I am going to discuss how the Tv-show uses history. This is both in sense of historical realism and society in general. So an example would be, how are the battlefield represented? How is the average village shown, how accurate is the display of power politics etc.? Or does it even use history, and instead, just make things gritty and ugly enough to a certain extent.
I thought I'd just pop the question on this subreddit, just to get a feel of your opinion on the matter.
I hope you want to take part in a talk about it :)",13,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

Plus it really showed us Tyrion's true side, all he wants behind serious matters is to enjoy life with people he would consider genuine friends and craves love from a family that sees him as a person who matters rather than a disgrace.

The cook is then turned into a rat that can never cure its hunger and kills everyone its ever cared about. The reason for its punishment was not killing people, but breaking the sacred rule of guest right.

On October 26th Matt Damon and Julianne Moore were in a video uploaded to the YouTube Channel Wired. They were answering questions people had googled. One of said questions was if Matt Damon was on Game of Thrones and he answered no, saying that he was into Game of Thrones, but not on it. But I remember way back to the series opening Matt Damon being there. He and the two men he is with are killed by White Walkers.
I've always thought that was Matt Damon, but it evidently wasn't. So, who was that guy.
TL;DR: There's a Matt Damon lookalike in the opening of the first episode of Game of Thrones; who is he?
Thanks in advance!",28,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Currently at season 2. Something i've really began wondering this time around (my 12th time rewatching this series, lol) .. while Arya was serving as cupbearer to Tywin Lannister, why did she not simply poison his food? Everyone always asks why Arya did not ask Jaquan to kill him which is an easy answer: she wants to kill her true enemies herself. Why not kill Tywin, the man leading the war against her brother?  She could have very easily poisoned his food and snuck out before anyone noticed. She could have even slit his throat from behind as he sat in his chair. Does anyone have any thoughts on this? Just want to hear some opinions :) I've been rewatching the scenes between the two and they have very charming dialogue between one another; i began to wonder if Arya grew some sort of fondness for Tywin.

Since that happened I bought my own supplies and started a small side business and just got my first large order from a bike shop near me!

So right now Ive been trying to make more content and thought it would be cool to have pictures of my designs being worn. My idea is if you guys wanna send me pics with your shirts on I'll post them and can tag you and I'll send you a promo code for 50% off anything in my shop.

As we know, bastards in various parts of Westeros are given last names that are a characteristic of the area they were born in. Snow for the North, Sand for Dorne, Stone for the Eyrie etc. So if you met someone of that name in Westeros, the assumption is that they are a bastard. 

However, what happens when a bastard with their special name grows up and has kids of their own? Their kids would also have their bastard last name, even though they aren't bastards. So after the first generation, how do you tell a bastard from a legitimate child, grandchild or other descendant of a bastard?

Then, of course, we see how Dany puts an end to that later in the series.

So, were expected to believe that thousands upon thousands of Dothraki soldiers, men, warriors, are submitting to the most beautiful woman in the world- I know she has dragons and that she burned them alive in their holy place- but were expected to now believe that these Dothraki men fight with such passion.....and then are not even allowed to release this passion in the form of raping women or having slave women? Right.

Listen, Im not here to talk about the ethics of this situation. Dont flame me about that. Im talking real world. George Martin would NEVER have something like this happen in his books, or at least I dont think he would. As a matter of fact, maybe he plans to. But it just seems so freaking fake. Its a show about magic, so yeah, but add SOME realism to it. Please.

In the words of Jorah Mormont, all it takes is one arrow through your heart, your grace, and its all over.

Dany is not invincible. You dont let men like the Dothraki release their testosterone, it turns into anger. Its just such a hard to believe scenario.

Based on the scene Tyrion had with Oberyn in Season 4 as he was telling him about how he met him before when he was just born, I would assume Cersei and Jaime were pre-teens to teenagers around that time. I'm also guessing he wasn't even born yet around the timeline we see a flashback featuring a younger Cersei in the opening scene to the Season 5 premiere episode.

Now just hear me out on this. We already know Cersei is planning to betray her alliance with Jon, Dany, Tyrion and co. by using the Golden Company to wipe out what remains of them after the Great War has ended. But what if it all backfires, when the Army of the Dead comes at her by surprise.

I think that the first battle will take place at Winterfell, and after the death of a number of characters, the major characters that are left along with little forces they have will have no choice but to abandon it, retreat and come up with something else on what to do next. Right before the GC can take action, they are ambushed by the dead in King's Landing. This would have everyone fighting in the same place once the major characters arrive to try and protect the city once they've figured something out and learn that they are heading South. This could probably trigger Cersei to blow up the city with the rest of the wildfire that is left underneath the Capital.

Just a theory. What do you think?",13,9,False,spoiler,,,,,

Personally I think the last one will be Arya Stark. Why? Well for a few reasons. For one it would be probably a very shocking twist sense not a lot of people think Arya could live to the end but I think she will. Another thing is that Arya has always been considered a survivor. Finally I think it would be very tragic if she lost her two last siblings and became the last of her kind.

Now what about Sansa and Bran. Well if magic will be gone by the end then that means Bran may die and Sansa lost Lady and if the Direwolf dies then that means the Stark with it could die. Now Bran I think will either die trying to warg into the Ice Dragon or will get killed by the NK at the tree in WF paralleling the Three eyed Raven's death. As for Sansa I think she will either die at WF too or she will be captured by Cersei and get executed. By the end Arya will be the last of her kind (besides Jon but he is technically a Targ) but I think she will marry Gendry and they will continue the Stark/Baratheon line.

Also Arya cans till go on adventure and not be a lady. Perhaps Gendry could just go with her.",12,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

1. Bran can influence the past as seen in him making past Ned Stark hear a voice and turn around, and obviously with Hodor.

2. The Mad King was said to have voices in his head (kinda like how bran spoke to young Ned Stark), and they were often telling him to burn things. He was famously quoted as he died saying over and over ""Burn them all"" (which brings to mind another character in this show is famous for repeating a phrase incessantly).

3. The most effective way to kill the army of the dead is burning them. Ideally burning them all. 

Now you probably see where I'm going with this but to clarify I think Bran pulled a Hodor situation again but with much bigger consequences this time and ended up making the Mad King mad. It's admittedly a bit of a stretch as to why Bran would do this, but I think it probably has something to do with Bran trying to use his powers to burn the white walkers and messing with Aegon's head.

But, I can't help but think that Edmure might very well be one of the most important characters from a political/military strategy standpoint going into S8. With Jaime Lannister potentially headed up North to warn Dany and Jon about Cersei's betrayal of the truce, the smart thing to do would be to shore up the defenses against the Lannister army. Geographically, this means the Twins.

I might be wrong, but with Hoster dead and the Frays nearly having been made extinct, Edmure Tully would be Lord of the Riverlands if not for the current Fray family survivors (obviously Lannister puppets at this point). In fact, he may very well be twice-entitled of the title: once by birth as a Tully and once by marriage to the Frays. My thought is that Jaime would not have too hard a time reinstalling Edmure to his rightful place (the Frays may not know about Jaime's leaving his sister per her pride, and thus listen to him). The truth is that with the North/Targaryen forces focused on the White Walker incursion, there needs to be a defensive focus to the south that they cannot properly address by opening a second front - my guess is that Edmure will be the rightful one to lead this defense.

Of course this all kind of depends on where Edmure has been kept under house arrest. If he was left in Riverrun or the Twins this is the best case scenario for this concept since it's a straighter shot for Jaime from King's Landing to Winterfell. If he was in Casterly Rock, he's either dead, has been moved to Highgarden, or is already in Targaryen custody (though if this is the case Jon and Sansa would pretty easily demand his re-appointment as Lord of the Riverlands pending Jaime's confirmation of events in KL/assistance in his installation).

I know that political and military strategy matters in the story have been simplified in the past few seasons of the show, especially in S7. My fear is that the show-runners, given tight constraints re: episode count in S8, are basically going to eliminate a seven-season buildup to the respective showdowns with the White Walkers and the Lannisters, with the liberal application ""Dragon-ex-machina"". I would prefer a more detailed and nuanced approach, which is why I think Edmure could end up being incredibly important.

TL/DR: Edmure should be Lord of the Riverlands, and would provide a much-needed southern defensive front for the North. Jaime could help make this happen. This would be so much more satisfying than ""Dragons win everything"".",8,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

Not in the way you are probably thinking though.

He betrayed her out of love, love for his brother.

You couldn't go anywhere during season7 without hearing people point out how stupid it was to get a wight to convince Cersei, which it was.

If Tyrion's plan was to convince her, I don't believe that. I feel the wight heist was a plan to get Jamie out of the line of Dracarys.

He knew that Jamie would choose to defend the realm over serving Cersei if he knew the danger to the realm was real

Some clues: 
Tyrion knows his sister and brother more than anyone.

He knows how each would react to seeing the zombie.

He had recently seen what Dany does to enemies that 
refuse to bow and it really shook him up.

He saw Jamie miss death by inches when he charges Dany.

He was desperate to keep Dany from risking herself to aid Jon, because he knows the plan to capture a wight was not serving Dany's interest, it was serving his.

He really doesn't have a problem with using fire to kill his enemies, (Blackwater) 

During the meeting everyone was looking at either the dead man or looking for Cersei's reaction. Except Tyrion, he was looking at Jamie too.

It might explain his poor tactics, he was trying to win the war in a way that didn't result in Jamie's death and it backfired on him.

Also, his plan worked, Jamie finally left Cersei. Though it came at the cost of one of his queen's dragons and the fall of the Wall.",23,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

During Daenerys's attack on the Lannister troops when they're taking the gold to King's Landing, wouldn't it had been better if Drogon had actually killed Bronn? Him jumping to safety in 1 second like 4 feet away from the crossbow seemed ridiculous. How the hell did Drogon miss him? Also, killing Bronn would give the battle much more significance and weight.

Then, when Jaime charges on his horse to kill Dany, wouldn't it had been better if Drogon had used its tail to whip Jaime and the horse 60 feet away, leaving Jaime heavily injured and unconscious, perfectly set to be captured? We would have gotten an interrogation scene between King Aeris's killer and his daughter, and Tyrion's stretched ""sneak into King's Landing to tell Jaime about a truce"" plan wouldn't have been necessary.

The show, while having a few fantasy elements, seems to ground itself in realism - with courtly intrigues and personal stories taking top priority, as well as showing gritty and unglamorous violence. Its approach to magic seems much the same, introducing only a few magical elements throughout the entire series and keeping them low key enough so that they don't interfere with the drama (compared to a series where magic is rife and so more or less anything can happen, undermining the dramatic stakes).

GoT has also taken pains to make its magic precedented, as moments where magic proves to be pivotal in the later seasons have already been demonstrated earlier in the show. For example, Dondarrion has been resurrected by R'hllor many times before Jon Snow is, so it doesn't feel as much like Deus Ex Machina. Likewise we've seen undead animals before Viserion is made into a White Walker, so this too doesn't feel terribly out of place.

Therefore given the show doesn't like to drop in new Deus Ex Machina style magic at pivotal moments, I was trying to think of how existing magic in the show could be worked into remaining unresolved storylines, especially combatting the Night King. I came up with...

What if Jon Snow dies, gets made into a wight or White Walker, and then someone also tries to resurrect him by way of R'hllor too? This might overturn the Children of the Forest's magic, and or otherwise give him some sort of power to defeat the Night King. It also requires little to no exposition (which is good given the episodes will be tight for time if there's only 6 of them), as we've seen people become a White Walker in the show, and we've seen people being resurrected - putting those two elements together doesn't take any sort of leap for the audience.

Lastly, getting onto the GRRM quote, he said in an interview with Time magazine concerning R'hllor's resurrection, ""[...] poor Beric Dondarrion, who was set up as the foreshadowing of all this, every time hes a little less Beric. His memories are fading, hes got all these scars, hes becoming more and more physically hideous, because hes not a living human being anymore. His heart isnt beating, his blood isnt flowing in his veins, hes a wight, but a wight animated by fire instead of by ice, now were getting back to the whole fire and ice thing."" Making someone simultaneously an ice wight and a fire wight seems very much an embodiment of, ""He is the prince that was promised, and his is the song of ice and fire.""

To me it matches the overall arc of Jon being the reluctant and self-sacrificing hero, and seems like a natural fit to the Azor Ahai prophecy. It's also one of those things that while it would be surprising doesn't feel unprecedented, because all those magical effects have been in the series already - they just haven't been combined in that way. In that regard the audience wouldn't feel cheated or that something had been plucked from thin air.

I'm not sure where this leaves Daenerys, maybe she makes Lightbringer by killing Viserion with something Valyrian Steel, if the old Lightbringer was made by Azor Ahai killing his wife - who knows!

EDIT: Replaced some mentions of wight with White Walker. Really either would fit this scenario, I think (if he was a straight white being resurrected could mess with the link back to a White Walker, if he was a White Walker maybe resurrection would ""cure"" him in some way. Imagine if the blueness that we saw spreading when the Night King was first made replaced in the same way with a human appearance if he was resurrected by R'hllor).

What do you think to Jon Snow being White Walkered (or wighted) and revived again? What's your own personal theory about how the battle with the Night King might wrap?",45,35,False,spoiler,,,,,

It's certainly possible that the ""secret"" is something we've already seen, like Shireen burning (although that already happened when this show aired) or Davos helping resurrect Jon Snow.  But I haven't ever seen any follow-up confirmation from Cunningham either way.  Does that mean that the secret is still out there?

Hey, 



I've been bingehearing In Deep Geek, GrayArea, The Last Harpy, TalkingThrones and some others (about 4 or 5 I missed) since last Saturday and I feel I have a pretty good idea on what is gonna happen with the 4 Valyrian Blades in the show and a take on Gendry and his role in this. This will fit in with quite some theories



1st of all, Gendry is working with Valyrian steel, only not with the 5 Valyrian Blades called Catspaw Dagger, Widowswail, Heartsbane, Longclaw and Oathkeeper. At least not before the war is over. 



The Catspaw dagger has seen it's purpose. It is entirely possible Arya is gonna use it once more to defend herself to kill a White Walker, but the Catspaw opened in the series with a blade owned by Littlefinger, and it has killed Littlefinger. So it will probably not have a major role anymore.



Oathkeeper from Brinne will not be reforged into Ice, because Brinne still has an Oath to keep. She will probably use it to save Sansa at some point, as Arya has her own fightingskills.



Widowswail will still be in Jaime's possession until he fillfills his prophecy and complete his redemption arc. Cersei will have a miscarriage, adding to Maggy the Frog's prediction of her only having 3 children. This will send her to become the Mad Queen, as she will have lost everything. In episode 6 she will decide to use Wildfire to ""Burn them all"", recalling back to the Mad King, after the Night King is defeated where the Golden Company has switched sides to fight, She will say this after they are under attack. Here Jaime and the Hound step in, first killing Qyburn (the pyromancer, done by Jaime) The Hound killing the mountain with firerelated stuff, and Jaime fullfilling the Valonqar prophecy with Widowswail, as Cersei is the widow who wails.



Heartsbane of Sam is the one im least sure over, but I think it will be the new Lightbringer, pierced through someone's heart. I feel this is gonna be the hearth of Bran Stark, as he is the Nightking with the Dragonglass in his hearth, and that this happens on the Isle of Faces, whilst Bran holds his band against the Weirwood Trees who are there



Longclaw will be used in the final battle by Jon and will be part of a huge battle earlier in the season against the Nightking at Winterfell, where it will shatter. He will than get Heartsbane to do his final trick.



Back to Gendry. He is gonna make Valyrian Steel. Thanks to the books Sam has stolen, he has besides his weapon also the last major reveal by him, which how Valyrian Steel was made, which will be Dragonglass and Dragonfire. Gendry will possibly make a bunch of Valyrian steel blades for the some Maincharacters.

Edit:
I have a bunch of other theories too, if you are interested, let me know. I've been listening so much theories that I think I can give a good prediction

He's a big fan of killing characters that dothe right thing. With all the similarities between the Mad King and Cersei I think she is going to burn everyone in King's Landing and get killed for it. Now that seems pretty expected since everyone thinks Cersei is a villain. However, I think she will set off the wildfire caches throughout the city to defend the realm from the Whitewalkers and specifically the Night King. 

I think she will be outside the city walls with Jaime when the explosion happens. The army of the dead will be inside King's Landing and she will take most of them out along with a Whitewalker or two. Jaime will not realize the bigger picture of the sacrifice and will choke her out to fulfill Maggy the Frog's prophecy.  We will know that Cersei has redeemed herself and Jaime will feel tremendous guilt over murdering his sister and take his own life. 

I think this would be a great way to wrap up Cersei's arc as well as fulfilling Maggy's prophecy. This would also fulfill the prophecy (well kinda) of Cersei and Jaime coming into the world together and leaving it together. ",5,6,False,spoiler,,,,,

Also, we didn't see a death scene of The Wineseller. So we don't know if it's dead or not.

Perhaps the reason why the Children of the Forest turned the humans into White Walkers: so they didn't have to dirty their own hands using such dark practices.

Also, Bran has shown us through Hodor that it's possible to warg into other people - I think they just have to have an inferior mind. The Night King is immortal and the humans are dead, so they shouldn't be too hard to control once you figure out how.

Additionally, this would explain how the wight in Season 1 knew to look for Lord Commander Mormont - the Night King could have been seeing through the Wight's eyes similar to how Bran saw through Hodor's or Summer's. Wights don't seem to have any substantial intelligence of their own, so there's no way one would be smart enough to understand the importance of the Lord Commander and actively look for him unless he was being directly controlled.

Finally, the eyes - when normal Wargs do their thing, the eyes turn white. But what if this particular form of Warging turns the eyes blue?

It's clear that the Night King does have some sort of Warging ability, as shown by how he interacts with Bran, but the question here is whether or not his necromancer powers are just another form of Warging or their own separate thing.

I'm tinfoil hatting at this point, but what if the series will end with Bran tapping into the 'dark side' of Warging and wrestling control over a portion of the Army of the Dead, in order to make them fight each other? This could distract them so Jon and crew can reach the White Walkers. Or maybe the Three Eyed Raven's destiny is to become the new Night King (not the past Night King/NK we have now, but a completely new one) in order to assume control of the White Walkers after the Night King's death and send them back north.

TL;DR: The Night King's control over the Army of the Dead might just be an advanced and taboo form of Warging, which Bran's own Warging powers could be compatible with.",9,11,False,spoiler,,,,,

Great and powerful men have been an influence on Jon: Ned Stark, Benjen Stark, Maester Aemon, Mance Rayder, Lord Commander Mormont, Stannis Baratheon, etc. While Jon has a natural sense of duty, I think Stannis sense of duty and conviction rubbed off on Jon, making his stronger in the process. In season 5, Stannis frequently kept observing Jon and asked him to join him, offering to officially make him Lord Jon Stark of Winterfell. Davos informed Jon that Stannis saw something in him. Melisandre affirmed the observation. Even Shireen noticed it, feeling like a disappointment when she saw how her father looked proudly at Jon (glad Stannis assured her he loved her). I got the vibe that Stannis viewed Jon as the son he wished he had. Stannis noticed almost immediately that Jon was special. Id like to think that his stay at Castle Black had some influence on Jon and a little bit of his legacy will live on in Jon, especially with Davos as his right hand man after Stannis fell.
