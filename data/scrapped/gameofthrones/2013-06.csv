There will be more than just that, but I haven't planned out the rest yet. I will hit some other important points in history (Blackfyre Rebellions, Wars with the Faith, War of the Ninepenny Kings, Robert's Rebellion), but I also want to talk about the individual Targaryen kings for a bit and what they did. If you have any ideas for other topics I can/should include, please let me know in the comments here.

**EDIT: I've added two planned posts about religions. I also think that when I'm done talking about the Targaryen kings, I'll focus on some of the lesser houses histories (Bolton, Tarly, Yronwood, Royce, Frey, etc.) so I'll have plenty of material.**

**EDIT 2: After a summer break, I'm back. I'm ready to start the Targaryen kings, and have mapped out what I'm doing for the rest of September.

What am I doing?

On Wednesday I talked about the ancient Essosi empires of Ghis and Valyria. This week, I will talk about the remnants of Valyria that became the nine Free Cities, as well as the other civilizations we're exposed to in the series.

**A Note on Spoilers:** I won't spoil things past the current episode of HBO (S3E8) in terms of plot. Of course, the whole point of this series of posts will be to give some extra information to non-readers about the history of this wonderfully-constructed world, so most of what will be here is taken from the books, even if it contains no spoilers.

[Central Hub](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1fh2tl/westerosi_history_central_hub_learn_about_the/)

[Detailed Map](http://www.sermountaingoat.co.uk/map/versions/speculative_map.jpg)

I also found [this](http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130127004525/iceandfire/images/3/37/Ice_and_Fire_World_Map.png) map, which doesn't have as much detail as the above one, but it is based off GRRM's *The Lands of Ice and Fire*. It's more accurate when it comes to the areas of the world east of Slaver's Bay, including Qarth.

##PENTOS

Pentos is the first Free City we are introduced to. In S1E1, it is where Daenerys and Viserys are. Its a major port city, run by a prince and his magisters. The most notable of the magisters is Illyrio, a cheese-monger, who first arranged Danys marriage to Drogo.

In Pentos, slavery is illegal, though there are a number of servants to the nobles. Illyrio in particular is mentioned to have a few Unsullied to guard his palace. [This]( http://i.imgur.com/gfvJ5KQ.jpg) picture illustrates the original design for Unsullied in S1 before they became relevant.

The prince of Pentos is a purely ceremonial position, and the real rule lies with the magisters. In Pentos, power comes solely from wealth, not from family names or titles. The figurehead position of the prince is chosen amongst a number of noble families by the magisters

One man, later known as the Tattered Prince, was chosen to be prince after the magisters killed the previous one. Fearing for his life, the Tattered Prince refused and fled to the Disputed Lands in the south. He later established the sellsword company the Windblown.

##BRAAVOS

Braavos is the only Free City to not be a Valyrian colony. It sits on a lagoon in the northwestern end of Essos, at the junction of the Narrow Sea (between Westeros &amp; Essos) and the Shivering Sea (above Essos). Braavos also claims the coastline to the southwest. The ruler of Braavos is known as the Sealord. Braavos has one of the largest ports in the world.

Braavos was established 500 years before Aegons Landing (which means 800 years before the series). For future reference, Aegons Landing is considered the center point around which time is registered. The year 0 (like between B.C. and A.D. in real life) is Aegons Landing. In S3, we are about 300 years AL (After Landing).

Braavos was founded by slaves fleeing Valyrian expansion. They were led by the Moonsingers, who wished to hide in the lagoon to keep away from the dragons. For centuries, it was a secret city and remained relatively unknown to the rest of the world. After the Doom of Valyria, it was publicly revealed, roughly 400 years after its founding. The city is sometimes known as the Bastard Son of Valyria.

The city itself is hard to really describe. [Here]( http://imgur.com/9W4H87I) is the city of Braavos, though you cant see specifics. For those interested, Braavos is one of the maps contained in the map book I mentioned.

The culture of Braavos is centered around sea trade. Braavosi ships paint their hulls purple, and their ships trade with all corners of the world. The Iron Bank of Braavos is one of the major moneylenders of Braavos, and has even leant money to the Iron Throne. In a recent episode this season, Tyrion spoke with Bronn about the kingdoms debt to the Iron Bank.

The city is also known worldwide for its courtesans. Each courtesan has their own barge and servants. Their beauties inspire songs, and they are showered by gifts. Nobility and rich merchants pay for courtesans to be their dates at events.

Braavos culture created a unique form of sword fighting, called Water Dancing, in which the fighter stands sideways and wields a slender blade. Bravos fill the city, dueling to display skill.

The symbol of Braavos is the Titan, which is both a fortress and a statue, immense, which sits over the entrance to the Braavos port. The only notable Braavosi in the show so far is Syrio Forel , the First Sword of Braavos for a time.

Braavos is also the location of the Faceless Men, a group of assassins who change their faces. Weve met Jaqen Hghar (if that is his real name), though we dont know his place of origin.

##VOLANTIS

Volantis is the southeasternmost Free City, sitting at the mouth of the Rhoyne, east of the Disputed Lands. It is said that the Volantis port could hold the entire city of Braavos. Volantis is the closest Free City to Slavers Bay, and has a close friendship with the Yunkai. They deal extensively in slaves. In Volantis, every slave is branded with a tattoo. It is said there are five slaves for each free man in Volantis.

Volantis was the first colony established by Valyria, and believe they are the inheritors of the world. After the Doom, a Volantene fleet took Lys and a Volantene army took Myr, and for two generations, all three cities were ruled from the Black Wall in Volantis. When the Volantene tried to take Tyrosh, Pentos aided Tyrosh. Volantis asked Aegon Targaryen (before the Conquest) for help, but he entered on the Pentos/Tyrosh side, as did the Storm King of Storms End. During the war, Myr and Lys both rose up in rebellion. The resulting war left the Disputed Lands a waste, and freed Lys and Myr from Volantene rule. To this day, Volantis holds the town of Sellhorys.

Volantis is ruled from within the Black Wall. Only those of Old Valyrian blood can pass the Black Wall. Volantis is ruled by a triarch, a group of three, elected once a year. Two political parties vie for control. The elections are ten days of madness, a free-for-all to curry favor of the candidates and for the candidates to curry favor with the voters.

Only those of old blood that can trace ancestry to Valyria can be a triarch. The two parties that vie for control are the Elephants and Tigers. The elephants are the merchants and moneylenders, while the Tigers are the old aristocracy and warriors. Elephants advocate trade and tigers advocate war.

Volantis is home to the largest temple to Rhllor, the Lord of Light, in the world. It is three times the size of the Great Sept of Baelor in Kings Landing.

The only Volantene in the series is Talisa, Robbs wife.

##LYS

Lys is another Free City, one of four located on islands off the mainland. It sits more south of Essos than the others. It is southeast of Tyrosh and west of Volantis. Like Braavos, Lys is spread over a number of islands. Blonde hair, blue eyes, and fair skin are common among Lyseni, remnants of the Valyrians of old.

Varys claims to have been born a slave in Lys. As a girl, Daenerys and her brother spent some time in Lys as beggars. One of Aerys Hands, Jon Connington, supposedly drank himself to death in Lys after being exiled from Westeros.

The women of Lys are renowned. The pleasure houses of Lys are famed around the world, as they train girls from young ages to be concubines and whores. Of course, all are bedslaves, (slavery is legal). Lys frequently fights for the  Disputed Lands.

Lys also contains one of the largest temples to Rhllor, the Lord of Light.

Some other Lyseni: Sallador Saan, the pirate who fought for Stannis and then rescued Davos in S3E1. Doreah, one of Danys handmaids, was bought by Viserys to please him. She ended up sleeping with Xaro Xohan Daxos and being tapped in his vault.

##MYR

Myr is one of the Free Cities on the Essos continent mainland, and sits east of Tyrosh. The inhabitants are renowned for being great craftsmen. Its main exports are finished goods, such as carpets, glass, and lace. The city is ruled by magisters, much like Pentos. Unlike Lys, the Myrmen tend to be dark-haired and dark-eyed.

Slavery is legal in Myr, as in many of the Free Cities. The Myrmen often fight with the Lyseni over the Disputed Lands. During the series, at around this point in the books, Tyrosh and Lys are on the verge of war, and both seek to bring Myr into the conflict.

The Faith of Rhllor is strong in Myr. Thoros of Myr, a red priest, is currently in the Brotherhood Without Banners.

##TYROSH

Tyrish is a coastal city, sitting on an island of the Stepstones. It is famous for its greedy citizens. Slavery is dealt in extensively. They have many brothels, though none as celebrated as those in Lys. Tyrosh is home to many sellswords, and is often drawn into conflicts over the Disputed Lands and Stepstones. Tyrosh often have forked beards and pointed mustaches, dyed in bright colors. It is ruled by the Archon.

Tyrosh had been taken over by a band of pirates, and sellswords known as the Band of Nine. At the end of a Westerosi conflict known as the War of the Ninepenny Kings (which I will get into in a few weeks), they ended up losing control of Tyrosh. Timewise, the WoNPK took place a decade or two before Roberts Rebellion, I would say (rough estimate).

The only notable Tyroshi is Daario Naharis, Danys new friend from the Second Sons. In the books, he was flamboyant, even by Tyroshi standards. Much of that was omitted from the show. Dany and Viserys spent some time in Tyrosh as children, and the brother of the Archon of Tyrosh attended her wedding to Drogo in Pentos.

In AFFC Genna said the following to Jaime:

&gt;""Jaime,"" she said, tugging on his ear, ""sweetling, I have known you since you were a babe at Joanna's breast. You smile like Gerion and fight like Tyg, and there's some of Kevan in you, else you would not wear that cloak...**but Tyrion is Tywin's son, not you**. I said so once to your father's face and he would not speak to me for half a year. Men are such thundering great fools. Even the sort who come along once in a thousand years.""

I always took this to mean that Tyrion inherited Tywin's military and political cunning and forethought, but would it be possible that this was meant to be ambiguous, and that Jaime was in fact Tywin's bastard son, possibly even from a Lannister mother? It could explain the ""unnatural"" attraction between him and Cersei and would make an interesting plot point later on in the story.

- **Reek**: Looks like Theon is going to learn his name.

- **I Have To Go North**: I'm confused on this one. They changed Robb's motivations to have him decide to march on Casterly Rock, and explicitly had him say that going North was a bad idea. I don't know what else this could be about other than his plan to take the North back from the Greyjoys. Maybe there will be some development in Episode 9 after he learns about Sansa and Balon?

While the first two seasons were sharp and exciting, the third season has been plodding along at a snails pace with very little character and plot development.

Dear nonreaders, by now [your heads have exploded](http://24.media.tumblr.com/a3b9f41a0efc679113ceae58710e9536/tumblr_mizweciZx51s59p90o1_1280.jpg) because of the [Red Wedding](http://cerque.deviantart.com/art/The-Red-Wedding-325470316) in today's episode. As written by the [evil and cruel George R. R. Martin](http://i.imgur.com/t9iFn.jpg), the Starks and their friends were horribly massacred during [Edmure and Roslyn's wedding](http://robbstarkalypse.tumblr.com/post/49131956769/inked-commission-from-cross-edmure-tully-roslin) by [assassins disguised as musicians](http://media.tumblr.com/034e6e162abb1591791762a428e0d56f/tumblr_inline_mkls9x0UrO1qz4rgp.jpg).

If it is any consolation, you have witnessed one of the greatest moments of television history. The only equivalent examples I can think of have become famous: [The ending of *The Prisoner*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-uQ84-waV0), [Colonel Blake's death on *MASH*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g450eyrN7Pg), and [Bobby Ewing in the shower on *Dallas*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCEjeTb1rrs).

We readers [knew this was coming for years](/r/halfwaythroughasos). For many, it was an [incredibly traumatic experience](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtlQ1rWcEf0), complete with threats of [book throwing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1S1pucB8qlI) and [suicide](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omZBpQRL-qs). (Even [Hitler found it shocking](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKqF8lg_M7A).)

Since misery loves company, and since everyone loves watching the many funny reaction videos to Ned Stark's beheading,^1 we secretly organized Operation WaW to document your reaction to the Red Wedding as widely as possible. We hope that you will enjoy watching the videos WaW participants post below once they edit and upload them, in the comments, as much as we will.

PS - The first video features /u/awarzz's [nonreader girlfriend](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1fjyxm/s3e09_operation_waw_reaction_videos_for_the/caazz7b?context=3), while /u/BMoreBeowulf has contributed a photo of [his nonreader wife rejoicing in](http://imgur.com/FFkJFfr) the defeat of the usurper northern king.

PPS - [To cheer you up, a bonus song](http://robbstarkalypse.tumblr.com/post/49544142153/video-link-in-original-post-was-dead-enjoie) as played by an [expert Frey guitarist](http://media.tumblr.com/e3de974d5ac63b5b4dcf13958846629c/tumblr_inline_mmgczr7nBw1qz4rgp.gif). To celebrate the Freys and Boltons cooperating in defeating the false king Robb Stark, the moderators have changed everyone's sigils for 24 hours. [Happy Frey Day](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1fk02l/mod_ravenno_spoilers_happy_frey_day/), one and all! And remember, the [Lannisters send their regards](http://i.imgur.com/hzPfO.gif)!

You just wittnessed one of the most gruesome betrayals in ASOIAF. We readers have been waiting for this for years

You might be feeling angry, upset, confused. Readers have been known to throw the book to the floor upon reading the events of the Red Wedding. We understand if you need some time alone, to think about what the fuck just happened. Please, take your time

But I just have one last piece of advise for nonreaders: Please, keep watching. It may be a bumpy road to whatever end GRRM has dreamed for his universe, and sure that road will be filled with death, and betrayal--and hopefully none as bad as this, but who knows with George--but in the end, we hope to experience the twisted, fucked up world that is Westeros for all its worth, and I hope that the lot of you continue to watch the series.

For winter is coming, and the North remembers

""events""... that transpired on tonight's episode, and that topic is ""Guest Right""...

So, what was it that made the slaughter of King Robb, his mother, and men so especially reprehensible?  The viewer got a subtle hint at this at the beginning of the episode, in the scene where Robb and his men shared ""bread and salt"" with Walder Frey (well return to that in a bit), and that was the invoking of the ancient custom of hospitality, ""Guest Right""..

Guest Right, as I said is an ancient custom of gods and men (among all the religions of Westeros, not just the faith of the seven) dating back to the first men, that states if a guest shares food and drink under the roof of a host that the guest is offered protection by the host. Neither guest can harm host, nor host harm guest during the duration of the stay, and breaking of this custom of hospitality, as we saw tonight, is considered very egregious by all men and women of Westeros, and the person who violated ""guest right"" is considered accursed and loses any reputation they may have had... It's a big deal..  As I mentioned above, regardless of religion, regardless if you're a lowborn bastard, or the King himself, ""Guest Right"" is sacred.  Walder Frey did not only commit a heinous act of treachery, but went far beyond that in the violating of ""Guest Right"" 

Now, as I said above, Guest Right is automatically observed once the host shares his table with his guest, no matter what the meal or drink or who the host or guest is, but among the Lords and highborn families there are some traditional formalities associated with Guest Right. The first is what we saw in tonight's episode, Bread and Salt.  Bread and Salt are traditionally presented to a guest in highborn circles as ""officially"" recognizing the custom of Guest Right, it may be presented to the guest and it may be requested by the guest, either way it is an official way to state among all parties that said law of hospitality is invoked.  Guest Right ends when the guest takes their leave from the host, though there is some formality with that as well, traditionally the host will present his or her guests with ""guest gifts"" signifying that the custom Guest Right has ended, the guest usually also present the host with gifts as a token of gratitude for protection while under the host's roof.  Guest Right, can be denied if the host chooses, in Westerosi custom if a Lord bares naked steel across his lap when his guests arrive, it is a token that Guest Right is being denied and they do not have ""understood protection"" while under his roof....

There have been a few examples of Guest Right being violated in the backstory of ASOIAF.. One example is that of the ""Rat Cook of the Night Fort"".  The Rat Cook was a member of the Night's Watch when a King (prior to Aegon's Conquest) traveled to the Wall as a guest, the cook was wronged in some way by the king so the crow murdered the son of the king, and cooked the prince into a huge meat pie which he later fed to the guest King.  Legend goes that the gods took such error with this that the cook was transformed into an enormous rat who could only ever eat his young.. A song about the Rat Cook is still sung around the seven Kingdoms as a reminder of the sacred law of Guest Right..

The second example that we've seen in which Guest Right was violated was when the men of the Night's Watch murdered Craster under his own roof, as we saw several episodes ago.  This serves to remind that even though it was not ""invoked"" traditionally, it is still observed. There is a line in the books that didn't make it into the show that lends this credence.  Mormont states that ""There is no worse crime than murder at a host's dinner table"" and that they're all accursed, another clear violation of guest right, and illustrates that, in this case, how the guests can be the ones who violate the observance.  

And lastly is the example of what we saw tonight, the Red Wedding, all traditional observations were noted, bread and salt were exchanged and offered. (Though in the books Walder, was reluctant to give it to them when Robb and his banner-men arrived at the Twins) And Walder by murdering the King in the North, his mother, and his host has committed one of the most vile acts the people in Westeros can think of.  

I hope you enjoyed this, and are a bit more enlightened on the subject of Guest Right, and why it is so vile that it was violated on tonight's episode..  Thanks to both Tower of the Hand, and Wiki of Ice and Fire for some of the finer details... until next week, happy... uh... nothing's ever going to be happy again.  Have a week!

It depends on what they say. What can you say to someone who says theyll never read your book again? People read books for different reasons. I respect that. Some read for comfort. And some of my former readers have said their life is hard, their mother is sick, their dog died, and they read fiction to escape. They dont want to get hit in the mouth with something horrible. And you read that certain kind of fiction where the guy will always get the girl and the good guys win and it reaffirms to you that life is fair. We all want that at times. Theres a certain vicarious release to that. So Im not dismissive of people who want that. But thats not the kind of fiction I write, in most cases. Its certainly not what Ice and Fire is. It tries to be more realistic about what life is. It has joy, but it also had pain and fear. I think the best fiction captures life in all its light and darkness.

I'm going to get into a little background information to start things off with my thinking process here (no spoilers past what we've seen so far, and nothing past where we are in the book story progression either):

In the books, although much less so in the show, it's implied that Robb's success in battle is partially due to the fact that he can warg into Grey Wind and go scouting to find passage through enemy defenses, etc.

In addition, during Orell's death we see him last second warg into his bird and eat Jon Snuh's face. This is actually pretty significant in the book because when a warg dies, he goes into one of his creatures.

The reason why I bring these two things up is that I had always thought that Robb dies first at the feast hall, his spirit then enters Grey Wind, and he goes through death again when Grey Wind dies.

Although I think that it would have been extremely brutal to have Robb suffer death twice, I think it would have been interesting to have Robb die first, enter Grey Wind, then with his last moments in Grey Wind, he sees his sister Arya looking back at him.

I guess part of the reason why they chose to do it the way they did in the show is that Cat's scream and death has more of an emotional impact on the viewer versus Robb dying a second death in Grey Wind, but I just thought it would be interesting to open up this discussion.",5,6,False,self,,,,,

The show is great don't get me wrong but I just find it painful to wait more than half a year for a 12 week season. I have really bad memory and by the time a new season is starting to be announced I already forgot what happened in the last one.

My question is. After watching every single episode where can I start to read ? Is there a lot I am missing if I don't read the books like it happened in LotR (I for the life of me don't understand why Tom Bombadil never made it into the movies) ? Also how long do people that have read the books think it will take for HBO to tell the whole story ? Will they ever or will they skip big chunks of it ? Or have they already ?

Thank you all for your suggestions in these regard.",24,15,False,self,,,,,

Robb's army being defeated.

But I have a question about two things, and it's kind of a complaint.

1.) People keep saying Robb's army is gone now... why? Didn't he have thousands of men? How could the Freys have possibly killed all of them? And were the Freys with the Lannisters? When/how (is it just implied since Robb didn't marry Walder's daughter that he went to the Lannisters?)

2.) I found Robb's death, while equally as dramatic as Ned's to be less meaningful than Ned's and somewhat redundant, since Ned's death effectively started the game of thrones.

Ned and Robb were basically the same character. I loved them both, by the way, but they were both exceedingly honorable and honest men whose good faith (ironic, in Robb's case - he didn't marry who he swore to) got them killed. I feel as if Robb never got any kind of differentiation from his father, even though I liked him a lot. Overly Noble leader of the north with a loving wife. 2/3 seasons now have had the hallmark instance be the death of the leader of the Starks. I was disappointed that we never really witnessed Robb's dominance on the battlefield (apparently he won numerous battles?) and the reiteration that Tywin Lanniser (I think?) effectively killed him without even fighting him. 

TLDR - I loved the scene, but I felt that Robb wasn't a unique enough character to justify me, personally, feeling the depth of feelings that people seem to be reacting to this twist with. And I wanted to, too... I'm honestly jealous.

edit- i can see the symbolism and mirroring between Robb and Ned and their deaths, it's obvious. But I wanted to also get some perspective from others on why GRRM would want to make a point of it to make the character so similar and have them mirror each other? ",17,2,False,self,,,,,

* Did Jon Snow really just leave Ygritte? 
* Where will Arya go next?

Nothing more to add. The story takes a different direction after the events of Season 3, but some characters are still there!

Jon Snow! Hes a nice guy... He just flew away from the Wildlings, leaving Ygrid behind. Don't you want to know what happens? Can he reach the wall to warn them? Will he want to see Ygrid again? Are the others members of the watch gonna trust him after all that he did? Don't forget there is a HUGE army of wildlings coming for the wall...

There's Bran and Rickon too! Is Bran gonna make it to the other side of the Wall? What's up with that strange kid Jojen? And is Rickon gonna make it? Is he gonna tell the world the Starks are not dead?

Don't forget Arya! What is she gonna do now? What is the Hound gonna do to her? Is she going to kill him like she said? What will happen to her plan of revenge?

And Sansa... she got offered an escape! Is she going to take it? She wanted to stay when she tought she was gonna marry Loras, but now, everything has changed! What will she do?

What about Dany? She started as a scared young girl living with her brother to a Khaleesi and now she is Queen, Mother of Dragons and she frees the slaves! She is the one character that progressed the most in the story. Don't you want to see what happens next? Is she going back to Westeros? What's up with that new guy Daario? And Jorah just got heartbroken so hard, don't you want to see what happens in Yunkai?

There is also Tyrion! Badass little smart mouth. He's the only one that has the guts to talk to Joffrey likes that brat deserves. He's now married to Sansa. His family hates him... and no one less that his majesty Joffrey the 1st. Poor little guy. How is he gonna handle that?

Then there is Jamie and Brienne! Jamie changed a lot since he got his hand cut off. He's starting to become a good man. What will happen when he comes back to King's Landing? Is someone gonna tell him all the things his sister did while he was gone?

Don't you want to know what will happen to that crazy bitch Cersei? She is so jealous of the new little Queen-to-be right now.

Talking about Margaery? Is she really innocent or is her smile and kindness just a facade? Her family is about as greedy for power as the Lannister. They don't have as much gold but they have food, and you can't eat gold during a war.

And Theon! Who's that sadistic motherfucker playing cruel games with him? Why is he held prisonner? Why torture him? And what happens to his sister?

And what will Edmure do when he finds out in the morning? What about Blackfish? He went out to take a piss, where is he?

And Sam is still on his way to the wall! Imagine, he is coming back with a wildling and a baby wildling... if he can make it at all... What will people think?

Meanwhile, Stannis the Mannis and his red witch are playing with fire... and with Gendry. Was Robb death linked to that ""magic trick"" he pulled with those leeches? He also names Joffrey and Balon Greyjoy... And what will Davos become?

And there are many more new characters to come! Some more twisted development to the story!I have read all the books, and this is the best thing I ever read! Don't give up!",46,114,False,self,,,,,

If you'd like to try to figure out what that song was on your own, try starting with the Blackwater episode [S02E09], especially Bronn with his whore and the end credits.  Also try the episode from 2 weeks ago, Cersei and Margaery chatting before Tyrion and Sansa's wedding.",12,0,False,self,,,,,

The other explanation is that he was simply ""done"" with Ygritte after she shot the horse breeder. If this was the case it certainly is disappointing and feels unjustified. She was clearly doing it to protect him and was ready to fight as his side until he pushes her out of harm's way.

But everybody thinks Bran is dead, so they will assume Sansa is now Lady of Winterfell, which makes Tyrion Lord of Winterfell.  

If Bran announces his survival, will he become the Lord of Winterfell?

I'm sure Stannis had little (or more likely, nothing) to do with Robb's death, but something I noticed is that despite all the bolts that pierced Robb, he didn't truly die until he was pierced in the heart with a dagger, much like how Renly died (albeit a shadow dagger). Not only the weapon, but the blood spurt that came out even looked similar to me. Maybe that's just how blood spurts look, but it honestly seemed very familiar and I later realized it reminded me very much of Renly's.

Don't spoil it, I'm really just thinking aloud, but if R'hllor took out Renly and then drank King's (bastard) blood via leeches to the names ""Robb, Balon, Joffrey"" then maybe their deaths will be similar in nature (i.e. daggers, blood spurt, bawling woman).

Why should the Freys and their men throw away their lives to defend the honor of the Starks? The Lannisters already defeated Stannis and now have joined forces with the Tyrells. The Starks have lost Winterfell and Robb drove away a huge chunk of their own forces in the Karstarks. The Starks will not win this war. Yet they must fight to the death because a peace treaty is not acceptable after Eddard is killed.

Walder Frey took a big chance on Robb when he picked his side during the War of the Five Kings. Robb threw it all away when he chose not to marry one of the Freys. Now that Walder won't have a king as son-in-law, he has very little stake left in this war.

The people of Westeros, especially the Riverlands have been ravaged by the war. It makes no difference to them who sits on the throne. All they ever wanted was to have enough food to survive the long winter. Walder Frey and Roose Bolten ended the war with minimal loss of lives with the red wedding.

There was Tormund grabbed Ygritte, but Orell and at least 3 other wildlings were free to attack him.

* What happened to Orell? At the last minute he warged into his bird and attacked Jon Snow, but then the bird just flew off.

Is his consciousness still in the bird and he flew off before Jon could kill him (again), or did his mind die with his body and the bird flew off because it was no longer being controlled to attack?

* What are the Wildlings south of the wall even doing? I was under the impression that they were going to assault the Night's Watch but it appears that they're headed south.

Then I watch the episode. I couldn't have been more surprised that the red wedding was referring to the frey's wedding. Just like the other show watchers, I'm still in disbelief.

Sansa's wolf was killed by Ned which sorta shows that Sansa is ""dead"" but not really.
Arya's wolf was set free and Arya basically survived by herself in the wild
Bran and Rickon both still have their wolves and are travelling with them. 
Jon's wolf is with the Crows which shows that Jon is still a member of the Crows.

I had a feeling this event may cause a huge backlash. Television watchers tend to be more fickle than book readers in general, not just in the GoT world.

Do you think the ratings will be impacted? Do you think viewership will drop enough to put future seasons in jeopardy?

I can't help but be extremely nervous. I've encouraged everyone I know to not give up, because it does get better, but a few people are just so adament about being done with the show all together.

I'm sure I'm not the only one. But it seems S2E9 busted that theory. The only way I can see to potentially salvage it would be based on the fact that she remained painfully unaware of her surroundings despite Cat shouting a warning to Rob and Roose scurrying around behind her. Perhaps she knew what was coming for the Starks but didn't realize she was also on the chopping block. A long shot to be sure.

So let's assume, the Honeypot is wrong and Talisa is what she claimed to be. What potential ramifications are their for Westeros now that a member of a prominent and militaristic Volantene family has been murdered? It'd be a major departure from the books of course, but a reasonable one. She apparently maintained contact with her family in Volantis and had informed them that she had married the King of the North. Eventually the news of the Red Wedding will spread across the Narrow Sea and reach her family.

I have never thought that I could call this show too gruesome for my tastes, I have never thought I would hate another character more than Joffrey and I have never, ever thought that a writer could kill his own characters so easily.

This episode made me want to read the books, because goddamnit, I truly wanted to throw everything off my table and just break something and the book would be a great start.

This episode made me so angry, that I can truly call GRRM a genius and HBO the greatest TV show channel ever.

I honestly had NO idea this was happening, and I'm browsing the internet and reddit on a daily basis, ofc I try to avoid spoilers as best as I can, but you will always have those dickheads trying to spoil everything for everyone. And this I'd have to say is a HUGE thing, and I'm amazed how I got SO caught off guard by it.


With all this being said, THIS is what makes me LOVE Game Of Thrones, the fact that ANYTHING can happen, the fact that there are no ""heroes"". And there are no happy endings because THIS IS NOT A MOTHER FUCKING FAIRY TALE. &lt;3

But is it possible that the RW will have a real and significant impact on the future of the show?

With the books we were able to stop reading to take in the full impact of the RW and continue later. Some of us journeyed on immediately, others took weeks or months to recover before picking up our books again. With the television show this may not be an option.

And yet Arya repeated how she will kill him. Even in this episode where her pain has reached and all time high, there is simultaneously an extremely strong argument and reason for her to learn how to forgive. Whatever it is she put him on her list for, killing the butcher's boy? It seems like a pretty shitty reason to kill the Hound anymore after what he has done for Arya and Sansa. ",6,9,False,self,,,,,

From an outside perspective, the Starks are a family of traitors, oath breakers, and betrayers. Ned defied the king, Robb started a war and declared himself King of the North, Kat took an innocent man prisoner, Robb broke his word with Frey, Robb beheaded one of the Lords of the North over Lannister boys.. it's a fairly long list of offenses that without proper context or explanation, makes the Starks look quite bad. So while the Guest Rights have been broken and that is a major offense, the fall of the Starks can essentially end a war and seemingly bring peace. Basically, from a lot of people of Westeros perspective, the bad guys just lost. (Can't wait to see the backlash of comments, but hopefully some real debate also.)",11,32,False,self,,,,,

Ok so given that Edmure (&amp; blackfish) were going to the twins, I would imagine some of their forces would go with them. Same as Roose and his forces. So there would be Frey, Stark, Tully and Bolton soldiers present at the twins for the wedding right?
So here's where I'm confused the Frey's kill the Starks and all that but... If the Tully's noticed their allies being slaughtered wouldn't they do something about it seeing as their lords are family to the Starks whom they've long been fighting along side of and all, regardless of the new marriage?
Now the Bolton's, wouldn't they side with their own fellow North-men who they've been along side with this whole war not suddenly and so easily switch the side of the Lannister's whom they've been killing and killed by in the war, regardless of their lords change of stance?

Tl;dr were Tully and Bolton forces present at the twins during the red wedding and if so why would they/ wouldn't they find it odd their stark allies are being massacred and do nothing about it?

I started reading the series a few years ago before the TV series had been announced, and I liked the first couple of books a great deal. I loved Stannis and his Onion Knight, Eddard Stark, and the grittiness of the series. That said, around books 3 and 4 I just stopped caring. Because of Catelyn's out of the blue resurrection, the Red Witch's strange powers, Bran's strange powers, the weird stuff with Daenarys and the magi, and the strange magical events happening in the north, it increasingly felt like GRRM was using magic as a crutch to make interesting things happen without ever intending to explain how this stuff works. 

I'm alright with magic being a mystical element in a universe; it can add a good deal of charm to a story. That said, it seems like GRRM has instead been using magic as a cure-all for whenever he wants to spice up the plot without having to make reference that twist's plausibility within the universe. In the end I had the sense that GRRM was going to do whatever he wanted to do and I was just along for the ride. A sprinkle of magic here or there to make things interesting--bring a character back here, tip the scales in a battle there--and in doing so, I lost interest in the universe as its own organic thing.

More than anything else, the universe of ASoIaF intrigued me from the start. The grittiness, the high-stakes politics, everyone's moral ambiguity, and GRRM's wicked attention to detail--that's what I loved about the first couple books. By the middle of the fourth one, though, I put the series down. Was I right to put the series down like so many people will after tonight, should I stick it out and keep reading?

Dany's at her best not when she's taking a back seat to some sexy warrior man, but when she's actually kicking ass in her own unique Dany way. I actually laughed at what they did last episode with Jorah, Daario and Greyworm fighting hoards of slave soldiers, it just seemed so silly, like some lame scene out of The Borgias or something. I laughed even harder when 'sexy blood covered Daario' tells her that they've taken Meereen. I understand that Dany's had a lot of screen time this season, but I wish they hadn't glossed over one of my (and many other book readers) favorite scenes with Strong Belwas, who could have easily been introduced right before the siege as someone is Dany's company who had so far been overlooked. 

Speaking of which, why is show Daario so unappealing? They picked a ridiculously handsome guy and made him every girl's wet dream. I refuse to believe that Dany, having been married to Khal Drogo, is going to be so enamored by some guy who 'believes in her beauty' and all the bullshit.

What really worries me is that soon Dany's story line is gonna start to slow down and I shudder to think of how boring it's going to be a season or two from now, unless they make significant changes to the story.

This week's edition is subtitled ""You Totally Should Have Seen That Coming"". (Actually, you couldn't.

&gt; ""I've always hated the bells. They ring for horror: a dead king, a city under siege...""  
&gt; ""A wedding""  
&gt; ""Exactly""  
&gt; - ninth episode of season two about his forthcoming brother from season three

[Your journey is over](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUg7bHErk1s&amp;feature=youtu.be). This was THE moment we've been all waiting for, the true gamechanger. Ned's death might have been a surprise, but Robb manning up and taking revenge on him wasn't something new or strange and many people have ignored that the immense cast might mean that Arya's ""Anyone can be killed"" is absolutely literal.

**TL;DR: Explaining scenes - Trivia from books - Many errors that you're free to correct so I can polish (pun intended) the text**

This week, no poor attempts of jokes in headlines. By the way if you're new here, read the [previous ones](http://www.reddit.com/user/lukeatlook/submitted/) as I don't feel like repeating the whole history of Yunkai.

Warning: Might contain some information about future episodes - for example if there is something I think helps understanding the story and it gets mentioned in the next episodes, or if there is something readers say about a certain character that differs from the books now, but is yet to come in the show. A good example were the Reeds, or rather lack of them, in season 2 - my followups back then contained parallel story of Bran that contained Reeds in it even though they haven't been cast yet.

-----

Usually I go on location by location in the order of their first appearence in the episode. This week we'll do it the GRRM way: first write about everything else, and leave *the scene* for the very end.

* This is the first episode since ""The Kingsroad"" to have no scenes in King's Landing. It's also the first one since ""You Win or You Die"" without Tyrion Lannister's appearence.

* I would like to list all the major characters who held political power that died on screen in the last seasons for you to see something. Keep in mind this is a quite subjective selection. Season one: Viserys Targaryen, Robert Baratheon, Eddard Stark and khal Drogo; a total of four. Season two: Renly Baratheon and Xaro Xhoan Daxos, a total of two. Season three (so far): Jeor Mormont, Kraznys mo Nakloz, Rickard Karstark, Robb Stark, (arguably major) Catelyn Stark. Point is that with the count of four to five it evens season 3 with 1 while it covers only the first half of *A Storm of Swords* and believe me, this is far from over. Total named body count is AGOT 54, ACOK 72, ASOS 97.

* The Sam scene, once again, answers more questions than it asks and it kinda leaves me jobless (thanks to the book split this kind of thing is more and more often). There is a major difference with the book about how has Sam possessed the knowledge of the location of the Black Gate - in the books it's long forgotten and he learns that from a mysterious character that is apparently yet to appear on the show. Anytime you'll see ""Coldhands"" mentioned in casting for season 4, expect book readers to be very excited.

* This is the moment when Rickon Stark and Osha the Wildling Woman disappear from the books. Now you understand all those jokes about Rickon: he said in this episode more lines than throughout 6000 pages of all books combined. It doesn't mean we won't see Osha in the show, oh no. As a matter of fact GRRM liked Tonks's performance so much he decided to alter Osha's future story. Book readers will be just as surprised with Osha's story as you.

* Bran mentions his great-great-(many times) grandfather, Brandon the Builder. This is an important historical character as he is the one responsible for founding House Stark, building Winterfell and the Wall (as the legend says, with the help of giants), he also took part in building Storm's End, capital castle of Stormlands and seat to House Baratheon (the one Robert gave to Renly, we haven't seen it, but the shadow baby birth happens in a tunnel beneath it. It's complicated.)

* As you see, when a warg dies, part of his consciousness moves within the animal he possesses. We'll come back to that later.

* Yunkai... I'm impressed - no new names, no new places, nothing. Oh, and no dragons.

* Hound's story isn't supposed to be common knowledge. In fact the books don't mention anybody else than Sandor and Gregor knowing it and Sansa is being told it by Clegane himself, not through Littlefinger.

* We're getting close to the Twins, so the last noteworthy mention is the suckerpunch Arya chapter right after Catelyn's that ends on her getting blacked out with an axe to the head, which fooled less emotionally resistant readers into believeing the Stark death toll was even higher - just to find her name at the top of one of the next chapters. This wouldn't be the first POV character to die since Eddard was one (and Catelyn, just before Arya's) but the rule of thumb is that POV characters don't die that easily.

-----

Don't you think writing about it is easy or that I waited for this to happen.

* ""Was it Melisandre's leeches?"" - Who the hell knows. All we know is that she can see the future (""Death by fire is the purest death""), so it might be that she saw Robb's death and made up the leech ritual - possibly she believes that leeches ensured that her vision becomes a reality, but in fact the plot for Frey's betrayal was orchestrated a long time before that.

* ""Red Wedding"", that's the name, straight from Walder Frey's quote ""the red will flow and we'll right some wrongs"". Tyrion's wedding was ""Golden"", there are more weddings to come and get their own colour.

* Once you go back to the beginning of season 3, or even further beyond that, you'll see countless scenes that foreshadow this event - or rather you'll know how to intepret things such as Rickard Karstark saying ""You lost the war the day you married her"" or Tywin Lannister saying some wars are won with pens and quills.

* We've been bombareded with ""Rains of Castamere"" (first time we've heard it it Tyrion whistlign in S02E01, then in credits for S02E09) and it's a right approach - the song is very popular in Westeros (if I'm correct, Olenna jokes to the minstrel ""Play Rains of Castamere, I forgot how it went"").

* I think the biggest ""Oh God, I should have seen that one coming"" is still to come in the next episode as you'll probably learn the identity of Theon's torturer [hint](http://i.imgur.com/D2E1PHd.jpg) by then. Some people figured it out on their own already. This is connected to RW so I was wondering if I should mention that, but more about that next week.

* Boltons have been loyal to Starks for the last few centuries, but that's surprisingly a small fraction of the history of the North. Before that, Boltons tried to rebel and take the North for themselves.

-----

Well... let's get this over with. I've already listened to [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjR2NaCuzF8) over 20 times (I'm not kidding, I lost count and I haven't been listening to anything else for the last 6 hours) so I think I'm ready.

* You might remeber that the emissary from Yunkai reached for the cup to drink in a very swift and strange gesture. The Guest Right is an ancient custom that guarantees everyone eating and drinking by the host's table his hospitality. Once the emissary drank from the cup, Daenerys couldn't scorch him. What this means for Walder Frey is that everyone with a tiniest bit of dignity considers him cursed and condemned. This is possibly the worst stigma a man could have, the only ones competing would be kinslaying and kingslaying.

* Lord Walder's signature line is his ""heh"". Now you know.

* Don't get me wrong, but by many means the book Red Wedding is much more bloody, grim and sad. Mostly because you know the names of almost every single man slaughtered by the tables and you read how they try to fight back. And it's not like those names didn't matter.

* None of the kings is a POV character. We see Robb's story through eyes of Catelyn and her perspective doesn't really help cope with the scene. She freaks out right when musicians start playing *Rains of Castamere* and recalls Roslin Frey crying. Her despair and how gruesome the events got made many readers throw the book. Literally. Her last thought is ""No, don't, don't cut my hair, Ned loves my hair"".

* Robb's last words are ""Grey Wind"". Most popular interpretation, and I really wish it got shown as it had a perfect buildup, is that Robb warged into Grey Wind as he died (just like Orell got into his eagle). The timing was a little bit different in the books as Grey Wind fought back and killed some people, but the result would essentially be seeing Robb dying twice. I think seeing what could be described as second death of Eddard Stark was quite enough.

* Oh and about that one: This was a huge shocker for the readers as Jeyne Westerling, book equivalent of Talisa, wasn't present at the wedding and it was never certain if she was pregnant or not. After seven years of theories we got a bloody definite conclusion.

* Blackfish was the second one not present at the wedding in the books so he's probably quite alive.

Do we really want to get into more details here? I might come back to write more, but I really have a hard time continuing this. I'll be back in an hour or something.",841,1545,False,self,,,,,

In addition to that, the map from Yunkai to Mereen is barely any movement.    
  
As such, I believe that Dany will have her great battle in the city of... Volantis.   
  
Tyrion gets hijacked upriver by Jorah and goes through Volantis on his way to Mereen. Victarion goes right past Volantis. It would mean that Dany is getting closer to Westeros because she'd have actually progressed west instead of slightly north. The Dothraki would be nearby still, so Dany's ADWD ending could still happen just the same. And the culture of the city wouldn't be an almost exact copy of Astapor and Yunkai. They'd have the walled city with the Tigers and Elephants, the tattooed slaves, and vast marshes instead of more desert for two seasons. And in the books, Volantis sends its navy to attack in Mereen. Why not the opposite?    
    
The drawbacks of this that theory are minor, I think. Penny wouldn't spend that time on the boat with Tyrion, but does she really need to? Probably not. And that's if she's included at all. Victarion could have most of his ship's adventures prior to arrival at Volantis.    
  
In my ideal situation, she could spend next season defeating Mereen with the Strong Belwas style champion thing that Yunkai originally had, where Dany more or less skips it (while making more enemies). Then having an abbreviated version the Mereenese events taking place in Volantis for both a change of scenery and a feeling of progression in the story. I just think having what is essentially a slight variation on where she spent this entire season for the next two seasons will lose viewers quickly. Having a major change of scenery for the city she tries to rule (plus having it significantly closer to her endgame) will be much more compelling.   
  
As mentioned in the title, this is totally speculation. However, I really do feel like it would keep the momentum of the story going if Dany would keep _moving._ Thoughts?",9,5,False,self,,,,,

""it gets better"" ""remember Ned? it got better right?"" 

First off, who cares if they keep watching. 

Secondly, in my opinion the books and the story get nothing but worse. Originally Dance with Dragons was going to be the 4th and final book after SoS, but it's like he just added a bunch of fluff to make them longer and continue the story. 
As in, character arcs that go nowhere (Quentin Martell, I can only assume Aegon Targaryen), 
characters haunted by one line over and over again (""the crossbow thrumbed"" ""she's been fucking Lancel and Osmund Kettleblack and probably Moon Boy for all I know.""), 
the whole Mereen debacle (oh hey, let's conquer these cities and be a complete badass, then move on, now let's stay in Mereen for forever and have the most boring chapters of all time). 
Bringing back Mance Rayder just to die.
Having Stannis just fail in his attempt to take Winterfell.
Jon Snow had almost no good moments throughout DwD, besides killing Janos Slint, and then right at the end when he has this incredible moment of rousing the wildings to take back winterfell, he gets Julius Caesar'ed. Almost nothing has happened since the end of SoS. The story has barely moved forward, and especially not at the rate it did in the previous books. Of course I'm going to continue now because I have to, but I DO NOT think the story gets better after this, and actually think that DwD is a poorly written and disjointed book that seems slapped together (despite the fact we waited 5 years, when he said at the end of FFC that he was over half done). 

Now I'm sure the next episode will have Stannis at the wall, and Joffrey's death. Two badass moments, but they don't make up for the Red Wedding. And they will give all the show watchers hope that the story is about to get badass, when in reality these two things end up meaning nothing really.",8,0,False,default,,,,,

I'm developing a nasty habit of inferring what may or may not be important in the future books based on what Martin and the developers are cutting from the show. 

For example, Gendry has replaced Edric Storm's role in the book as the - possible - sacrificial lamb. Based on this, do you think it's fair to predict in future books that Gendry will not have a pivotal role in The Brotherhood Without Banners (Since his involvement with them is pretty much over in the show)? 

There is also a wild theory that [Spoilers](/s ""The Jeyne Westerling Jaime Lannister saw was really her sister, and the real one is hiding somewhere and pregnant with Robb's child"") Since Talisa is now dead, can we just assume that this will not happen.

In the books Yunaki is not sacked but simply their champion is defeated and they send out their free slaves so that Daenerys doesn't sack their city. Meereen on the other hand is where she sends in her men in secret to open the gates so that the city can be sacked. With the sacking of Yunaki last night it would be pointless to have Daenerys move on to another city. Also I noticed in the opening credits last night that their isn't even space to put another city on slavers bay on the credit map. I'm thinking we will get this clarified a bit more next episode as it is titled Mysha, the name the freed Yunaki slaves call Daenerys. By merging Yunaki and Meereen the show has cut down the size of Daenerys plot but this would pose a problem as to who then will start the war against her...

So, without actually spoiling anything, has anyone who has read further along got anything to say that might cheer me, and others who just suffered a massive kick in the feels, up a bit? 

For instance, one thing that I've cheered myself up with is the idea that every noble house motto/catchphrase has thus far been proven accurate. During the summer season in Westeros, the rose of the Tyrells has grown strong roots in Kings Landing, the Lannister lion has roared across the lands paying it's debts in gold and blood, and so on. However, when would a rose and a lion suffer most? Winter. And Winter is coming. The Starks were regarded as the kings of winter in ages past. While each Stark that tried to go south in summer has melted away, in the winter there may come some bittersweet revenge. Because, when winter does come, the north remembers. ",27,5,False,self,,,,,

It seems to me that the point of several scenes in the series (and the book, even though I am a non-reader) are to show how petty and horrific monarchies can be. And now that the Starks are effectively destroyed, it only amps up the question even further.

So with the threat beyond the Wall lurking and the fallout from this event possibly causing everyone to turn on each other out of mistrust, the numerous houses that remain are likely to destroy themselves with the possible exception of Stannis. What if the Brotherhood without Banners leads a citizen uprising? What if the Wall is breached? There are too many questions.

(this is all ""suspension of disbelief aside"", as in, yes i get it's fiction and for fun, im just curious if it's realistic)

So presumably the Freys and Boltons have been corresponding with Lannisters for the Red Wedding.  Now let's keep in mind that Robb has with him a reasonable army, which even if not all there are still substantial in number at and around the twins.  How many people exactly are ""in the know"" regarding the betrayal?  I mean, how do you kill several thousand people like that?  

Yes I know they were drunk, but still.  That means you have to let your army know NOT to drink the wine, or only drink from the correct un-spiced flagons.  So how many people are we talking bout here?  a couple thousand?  
 
So you need several hundred if not thousand people to commit the massacre.  Logistically, that's a LOT of people.  And remember, these are people that have been fighting side by side with Starks in battles, campaigns, camping, etc for months if not years.  Not to mention theyre all ""northmen"" (the Boltons i mean) and thus have a natural affinity, which if not quite the same as our contemporary nationalism, is certainly somewhat close.  And culturally they also worship the Old Gods, so there's that. Surely friendships, bonds, etc. will be formed.

Remember, most of these are conscripted peasants or petty lords, if not outright mercenaries or hedge knights.  (The lords with castles are a minority, the top dogs... who might actually be even more cunning and likely to betray Bolton's plan).  All it takes is ONE guy, maybe with a conscience or religious who doesn't like the dishonorable betrayal/affront to gods of killing house guests who tasted food, or ONE guy like say Bronn who decides the Starks (far stronger than Boltons) would pay a lot of money for someone to reveal the betrayal.

And I don't buy the ""ooooh, Bolton's reputation for torturing people.""  The Starks I'm sure also are feared in the North, after all they're top dog.  And they're respected.  

My main conclusion, and please feel free to disagree, is that it was not terribly realistic.  I could absolutely be wrong, but that's just my amateur intution.  I loved it as fiction, but it does not seem very realistic from logistical standpoint.

I was curious if any historians in the crowd have real life examples (pre-nationalism, so not Barbarossa surprise attack on SU or white US settlers betraying indians repeatedly; I'm thinking more Middle Ages) of a big betrayal like that.  Maybe Renaissance Italy had something, or England/Scotland tribal wars back in the day.  Anyone know of any real historical examples that approximate the Red Wedding?  ",7,0,False,self,,,,,

I only remember a few, though they are not my own. I've only come to expect the worst and realize and accept that I don't know the worst to come (hah).

Some rules, please feel free to add more of what you know:

1. Don't get attached, GRRM tends to do horrible things to the likable characters. *Valar morghulis.*
2. However--Do not believe a death until you see the head; preferably detached from the body. [More complicated] (#g ""wargs!"")
3. Do not trust anyone's faction.
4. Do not trust anyone's word.
5. Do not trust anyone in general.
6. No one has a happy ending.
7. No one will ever be reunited, ever. [But] (#g ""I suppose this really pertains to the Starks more than anyone else"")

Granted, these aren't ""truths"" since GRRM is unpredictable and a lot of things happen that outside the scope of these rules, so this is really more of a ""guide to not completely freaking out when watching/reading"".

I'm curious about Jon and Samwell. It seems like they are both deserters of the Night's Watch and we saw early in S01E01/02 that they behead these guys, like when one ran from the white walkers. 

It doesn't seem like it's really discussed or covered. They don't mention it, and I don't sense a lot of fear from them about this. Jon could make the argument he was just trying to survive, and given events from last night he could make a pretty good case. Samwell, on the other hand not so much. Yet Jon roams the north freely, and Samwell is heading back towards Night's Watch outposts. Shouldn't these two fear being found? Maybe this is covered in the books more.

For those unfamiliar with it, it's a series of books who's main character is a private detective solving mysteries in California in the 1940s and 50s. It's the definition of noir. Very good series.

They basically took the books and dramatized them. Including different actors for each roll, sound effects in each scene and so on. It was like listening to a play. Really well done. [This page has a short sample if you've never heard a dramatization before.](http://www.audible.com/pd/ref=sr_1_1?asin=B005AOMN10&amp;qid=1370290087&amp;sr=1-1)

When I decided to start reading the books a few months ago, I was looking for a version like that for the first 2 books. I wasn't stoked about reading such long books when I knew much of the outcome from watching the show. I was sure that such a huge and successful series would have that type of audiobook version but after searching around it was clear that it didn't. Regular audiobook versions tend to be a bit dry for my taste so I ended up just reading them.

I gotta tell ya though, if they produced a nice dramatized version of those books, I would throw a bunch of money at them for it. I think many other people would too. It would be like experiencing the series in a different and unique way, somewhere between books and show. I really wish they do this one day.",2,2,False,self,,,,,

Now that Edmure is married to Rosalin, the Freys/Lannisters/Boltons may have ended an uprising, but it seems like they also just started a civil war within their own family. Unless the Tullys were in on it and sacrificed Catelyn ""for the good of the realm""? Can someone shed some light without spoiling too much about the future episodes?",5,2,False,default,,,,,

Robb- Did you see any of them?

Catelyn- Yes

Robb- and... how were they?

Catelyn- One was.... okay. 

And she gestures her head such as to signify that she wasn't that good looking. 

Could someone explain this to me?

Just look at his fight scene in last night's episode compared to the one with Jorah, Daario and Grey Worm. That's one of his better ones and it wasn't very good. I've had the same problem with him throughout the show.

For many book readers, it's the most shocking moment of the entire series.  But the series is far from over.

Both the book readers and moderators did a great job keeping it a secret, but as the shock wears off and discussions ramp up, it may become more and more tempting to hover over those ""ASOS"" tags.

I'm sure most of you know by now that the third book, A Storm of Swords, has been split up into two seasons.  Episode 10 next week, and most/all of Season 4 will contain events from ASOS.  There are still a lot of big spoilers lurking under those tags.

So if you want to continue to be surprised by the TV show (and I promise the surprises aren't all as soul crushing as last night), do yourself a favor and don't hover over ""ASOS"" tags until a year from now (the end of Season 4) or until you've read the entire book.

I apologize if some of this stuff is immediately obvious but I tried to search online and have not found answers to my questions. Please don't answer with any spoilers beyond what I *should* know so far :)


So in episode 9 we understand that Walder Frey betrays the Starks because he obviously felt cheated/wronged when they broke their vows the first time. A few questions arose for me.

1. Why would Bolton betray the Starks? So far nothing in the show has demonstrated any ""real"" reason to do so? I mean there have been disagreements but nothing that should lead to such a harsh outcome.


2. Walder Frey, were his actions in anyway motivated by external forces? Tywin or other?


3. Now that Robb is dead and Bran/Rickon are ""lost"". Wouldn't Sansa automatically become Queen of the North and Tyrion King?


EDIT: 4. What of Baelor in all this? Stannis names him as one of his ""targets"" but so far he has shown 0 motivation for the thrown. Is stuff omitted in the show?


Again I apologize if these are dumb questions. If the answers for any or all my questions is: you'll see, please let me know :)

The death of a single family member gave him the first hints of his power. In the latest episode, Bran reveals he has the power to control other humans with his warg skill. Such a power is unknown to any other warg before him. Immediately following his discovery, the mass murder at the red wedding occurs. It took so many deaths to reveal this ability.

* Not immediately trading Jaime for Sansa whom  he could have married off to secure more allies.  That nobody ever mentions this possibility to him in either the book or show is perhaps the biggest plot hole in the series.
* Sending Theon back to the Iron Islands
* Breaking his vow to the Freys and marrying Talisa who had no political upside at all
* Killing Karstark
* Attending the wedding at the Twins without taking proper precautions
* Not bending the knee to Stannis early on in the war, especially considering he did not wish to sit the Iron Throne.  I understand Catelyn and Renly were close to a deal before Renly's murder, but anyone with a brain could have recognized what a poseur Renly was, and that Stannis was the real player of the two.
* Not torturing Lannisters during the war; perhaps he could have learned Tywin's plan to fight the Blackwater and sent a raven warning Stannis

Spare me the arguments about how Robb was full of honor.  He was.  But then he shouldn't have tried to play the game of thrones.  Bolton nailed him early in season 2 when he said something to the effect of ""you can stroll down the high road but you can't lead an army down it.""

Other mistakes by the Starks:

Ned:

* not listening to Renly at the end of season 1
* not bending the knee to Stannis

Sansa:

* not escaping Kings Landing with the Hound

Spare me the ""she was just a little girl!"" argument...anyone in a like situation from any of the other major houses in the game would have gotten the hell out of there.  She's a moron.

Arya:

* not using her three deaths more strategically

See the criticism about Sansa.

Bran:

* sending so many men to fight the Ironborn in Deepwood Motte, leaving Winterfell defenseless against Theon.

Catelyn:

* Leaving Winterfell to go on a fishing expedition for evidence about what she already knew about Bran's fall.  Send a fucking raven to Ned and remain at Winterfell.
* Taking Tyrion hostage; although hindsight is 20/20 on this one, and I can see how at the time it could have seemed like a smart strategic move
* Not trying to commandeer the Tyrells after Renly's murder, but this is more of a criticism of show-Catelyn because in the books the Tyrells think she is responsible for Renly's death
* releasing Jaime without Robb's consent and causing cognitive dissonance within his camp

Feel free to add other stupid mistakes by the Starks that I inevitably missed.

Cheer up everyone!  The Starks lost the game of thrones fair and square, and the characters left standing are real players.",28,0,False,self,,,,,

Even if you can argue that he did the right decisions, still if someone like Ned Stark was at the head I really don't see him betraying his word/marriage of the Freys, betraying (yes it is kind of a betrayal, or more or less a ""fuck you"" to) the Carstarks.

I think how beautiful they made the Frey bride to look like really rubbed it in to Robb about what a bad decision he made. So many people seem to agree that the Frey bride is better looking than Talisa and it really portrayed Robb to have made a bad decision in a material sense of beauty as well.

Many-a-reader have come to this and other subreddits to proclaim their mourning when they get to the RW. They explaim ""fuuuuuck I just got to THE pat"" ask things like ""WHAT IS THE POINT OF GOING FURTHER????"" We are always here to console and commiserate with you. We all went through it. And the respose is always , ""keep reading.""

So, my answer to you is: KEEP WATCHING.

BUT if are one the people proclaiming that you are going to stop watching because of last night and feel like there is no point in watching the show any more,  or if you know someone who says they aren't going to watch the show any more, I have a suggestion. This comes from experience. One of my friends said that the whole point was to have the Starks winning and that was the only reason she was watching, blah blah but then

**READ NO MORE IF YOU WANT ABSOLUTELY NO SPOILERS FOR E10 OR S4**









My friend is not a book reader at all, but I had her read the epilogue to ASOS  and she completely changed her mind. She was happy, and started getting really enthusiastic again. Then I told her a few more spoilers to cheer her up and she now wants to start to read from AGOT. 

So, if you really think you  can't go forward, try to get your hands on a copy of ASOS and read the epilogue. It won't make any sense at first, but this happens to readers as well. Prologues and Epilogues tend to involve characters that you are supposed to be unfamiliar with. The major names mentioned in the chapter are all characters that every show watcher will know, and you should understand every important reference made. It is not TOO spoiley in terms of the major plot, but it is a very feel-good moment in what can be a very ""WHERE-THE-FUCK-ARE-MY-FEEL-GOOD-MOMENTS"" kind of show. ",12,0,False,self,,,,,

The rest of his army is to the south around Riverrun.  So the whole Northern army, except for the Karstarks and the Boltons, is outnumbered and surrounded.

On top of that, we remember in Season 2, some farmers came to Winterfell to complain that there weren't enough young men around to get any work done.  Then Theon takes Winterfell with 20 men.  A society can only fight a war if it still has enough young men to replace the casualties on the front lines.

Here's my premise.

* Sansa believes in fairy tales with happy endings; we all thought Robb would avenge his father, save his siblings, and become the true King in the North

* Sansa trusts in people despite not knowing their true nature nor understanding their ulterior motives (Littlefinger, Tyrells, Lannisters); we believed in a man as petty as Walder Frey to overlook a significant slight rendered by Robb's actions despite this point being reiterated many times by Catelyn Stark

* Sansa sees people in only black and white, no grey lines in between; many of us seem to feel that the Starks are ""good"" while the Lannisters are ""bad"" when in reality Robb Stark broke a solemn oath and spat on the honour of a significant Lord. The Starks are not angelic beings incapable of fault. They simply make it easier to relate to them than the family dynamics of other great houses which causes us to sympathize with their version of the story.

* Sansa is naive; we were/are naive

Therefore we are Sansa Stark",188,750,False,self,,,,,

For the record, i have not read the books in their entirety. I have read some passages and know a bit about what happens in the books. This is speculation that i haven't really heard but makes some sense from what i know. I'm going to say that this is spoilers for everything thus far. This includes the show as well as the books. 

[Speculation](#g ""So i know that Grey Wind's head is sewn on to Robb's body. Obviously this has some great significance in terms of symbolism. However, with the resurrection of Cat as Lady Stoneheart, i can't help but think that there is a more practical purpose for this. Later in the books, i know that Cercei is given some sort of protector in a suit of Gold armor. The popular theory is that this is the Mountain. This, matched with Lady Stoneheart, leads me to believe that a Frankenstein's monster type deal is possible within the world. Thus, i believe that Robb/Grey Wind will eventually be resurrected. This is a very literal interpretation of the Hound. But who will he be resurrected for? The most obvious is Lady Stoneheart. I don't know much of what happens with her after her resurrection other than that Arya ends up near her at some point. Arya is another whom Robb could serve. However, after watching this week's episode, I couldn't help but think Bran as he was able to control Hodor. While the consciousness of a warg and the rules surrounding that may be a bit murky, i think that if the time came when Bran needed a new body, Robb's would be ideal. Nothing would strike fear into the enemies more than a warrior with the head of a wolf."")

Sorry for the wall of text.

The speculation probably has some holes. As i said, i'm not a hardcore book reader so i don't know all of the plot let alone the intricacies. However, i hadn't really seen it discussed. I'd like to hear what others think of this and if anyone can add to it or debunk it.

When the whole stark family gets killed during the wedding, I thought ""good"". 


Why? Well, first I don't like Catelyn Stark, she is a self righteous bitch whose ill actions are too numerous to speak of. But come on... She managed to forgive her husband for his ""mistake"" and love him like the first day but couldn't do it for an innocent child that was the unwilling result of this ""night out""? 


Some people might think that the Stark ""had"" to declare war because it was a matter of honor for what the Lannisters (mainly Joffrey) did to Eddard Stark. I see the things differently. By waging war against the Lannisters they engaged and destroyed countless lives of soldiers along with their families. How in the wolrd sacrifying thousands of life is considered good or just?


Now, now. I know that it was a ""different"" time with ""different customs so mapping a 2013 ""humanist"" culture to a different time is stupid. Well, that's also my point. If you don't care about thousands of lives why should you care about tens of lives? Tywin Lannister certainly didn't and Rob should have known better. 


By killing the Starks and (certainly) putting an end to this war (and only this one, ofc), Tywin Lannister (I don't think Joffrey is smart enough to have devised a plan like this one) saved a lot of lives.


You may not like it but I think that's how it is.


For me, the only innocent victims (to this point) of  the red wedding were Jeyne, the wolf and in a certain extent, the soldiers that were slaughtered along with rob.

The same goes with Moon Boy (Jester at King's Landing) and Jinglebell (retarded grandson of Lord Frey and jester at the Twins). Neither of these would require much introduction, if any, and they could dance with bears and joke around a bit.

Jayme opens the large box to reveal a contraption made with leather and metal. Upon further examination it is a device that as Tyrion shows him, fits his sword. It attaches at the wrist and other parts of the arm. It can safely sheath or extend the blade out to a normal sword's length.

    that's all the truth I know.
    In a coat of grey or a coat of red, 
    A beast still has claws,
    And mine are long and sharp, my lord,
    as long and sharp as yours.
    And so he spoke, and so he spoke, 
    that wolf of Winterfell,
    But now the rains weep o'er his hall, 
    with no one there to tell,
    Yes now the rains weep o'er his hall, 
    and not a soul to tell.

I was hoping that even if Jon chooses to remain with the Night's Watch (and, ya know, survives), it would be as a Stark of Winterfell.

  (Small note to non-readers in this thread, There is one very minor future spoiler in the first paragraph of my post, but other than that I made my OP as intentionally vague as I can, but don't expect that in the comments, a particular theory most likely will be discussed, at length, in the comments.  But know that while popular, it is a theory, and not a confirmed ""spoiler"".  I tagged this with a ASOS scope, so this thread for the most part should be safe for you)


Correct me if I'm wrong, but hasn't Meera told Bran the Knight of the Laughing Tree story by this point in the books, and could we expect it soon in the show?  It's this story told to Bran, which was a veiled recount of the tourney at Harrenhall, along with the Tower of Joy sequence as was presented in book 1, that forms the main pillars of a particular popular and generally accepted theory.

So for readers as we have not had either of these backstory scenes presented to the non-reader in the show, I imagine that viewers have no possible way to come to the same conclusiob as the particular theory I'm referring to. Given the importance of these two bits of backstory and the possible, most likely probable implications of these scenes that they have to come up ""at some point"" in the show..   When do you think the Tower of Joy and the Tourney at Harrenhall/Knight of the Laughing Tree will be brought up, and how do you think they will be brought up?

-------------------------
The knight of the Laughing Tree/Tourney at Harrenhall story I think can be brought up as it was in the books , with dialogue between Meera and Bran, when is another question, with just one episode left this season I doubt we'll hear the story this season, but sometime next season would be great

The Tower of Joy is another matter, readers were presented with this through a fever dream Ned had in book 1, while unconscious after his leg was hurt after the confrontation with Jaime.  He recollects the entire sequence there.... But as Ned is no longer around to have said fever dream, how it will be presented in the show will totally have to change... How, I imagine presenting it to Bran through Meera and Jojen (as their father Howland was involved with that as well)  is the most obvious route as well.  But when?  No friggin clue. 

Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think both the ToJ, and the Tourney at Harrenhall have been referenced through the animated backstory features on the Season 1 and 2 Blu-Ray sets.  But if they were they did not go into the same detail as the books, and certainly not to where non-readers can draw the ""same conclusions"" book readers have.  Plus while very well done, you cannot rely on viewers to have seen those for them to get those bits of backstory, they still need to find their way to the show...

So let me know what you think.

We try to be lenient with people who seem to be doing that by accident, but it's more than out of hand with the EP9 traffic.  **So this a general warning: [Posting careless spoilers will get your account banned.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/wiki/posting_policy)**  If you're not sure how to post with a good title scope or follow the scope that's been provided, [read the Spoiler Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/wiki/spoiler_guide); that's what it's for.

Non-relevant content posts are also growing common again.  The subreddit has [a content scope defined in the Posting Policy](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/wiki/posting_policy), and anything outside that will be removed.  So stop wasting your time with stuff like:

* **generic non-GOT memes** - generating a new one with GOT text doesn't make it relevant.  Post those to /r/asongofmemesandrage.
* **non-GOT reaction GIFs** - Just like the memes, if it's not made with GOT media it's gone.
* **""X"" reminded me of GOT** - stuff you see in the real world that isn't GOT-related but sorta-kinda makes you think about it should go to /r/earthoficeandfire

And lastly, you must provide a [**bracketed spoiler scope at the beginning of your post title**](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/wiki/spoiler_guide) or it will be removed.  There are no exceptions to that; it'll be bot-automated soon, so don't expect your post to be read before it's pulled.  

**EDIT: Also if you want to talk about BOTH the book and show, like how they are different, set a show/book scope, like [S3E9/ASOS]**

I am talking  about only things that happened in the show and information king's council and Joffrey know. 

They assume that both Bran and Rickon were killed, Jon Snow and Benjen Stark are in Nights Watch, arya is missing - Now can Sansa inherit the title if there are no male heirs? Or will it be her husband Tyrion? Or will be Starks sacked and Walder Frey will get their titles (I am thinking maybe he got that for switching sides)? 

Also who is heir of Casterly Rock and all other things Lannisters own? When Tyrion asked Tywin, I thought he refused because even tough he is his oldest son, he still has Jaime, but I forgot that Jaime is in Kings guard and can't own land or have a wife. And all children Cersei will have will be named Tyrell not Lannister.

So my question is what is Tywin's plan at the moment? What he planns to do with the North and his possessions? If he hates Tyrion so much, then why he didn't get another wife and have more children? Or he secretly loves his son and wants to give him more than half of Westeros and all their wealth?

I have the audio books rather than physical copies which makes it a bitch to go back and find parts to listen to again. Can someone please confirm/debunk something that's been eating away at me for a while?

Basically while I was thinking about wargs the other day I remembered how Arya saw through the eyes of the cat while she was blind. I also remember her still being in control of her own body while doing so, a trait that is not apparent in any of the other wargs we have come across. If she is able to warg yet still control her own body then this would make her a far more powerful warg than I first thought. Probably more powerful than Bran!

So yeah, if someone could look it up for me I'd really appreciate it.

Feel free to discuss any of your warg theories here as well, it'd be great to read them. ",2,8,False,self,,,,,

However the episode is entitled Mhysa, so I have a odd feeling Dany will be the leading character again.


I put my tin foil hat on for the last one, so bear with me.

The seasons have alternated between fire and ice with the closing of each one. First with the dragons (Fire) then with the reveal of the Walkers Army (Ice). Both literal adaptations of fire and ice, but what if this seasons ""Fire"" was metaphorical. The Dornish Sigil is the sun and spear, wouldn't it peak interest for non-readers if they saw sails coming into kings landing from a faction they know nothing about?",11,4,False,self,,,,,

Hear me out.

Before the Red Wedding, what are Walder Frey's crimes? Being unpleasant to be around? Insanely promiscuous/lecherous? Step in his shoes for a minute - at least he has the decency to marry all the women he has kids with, to acknowledge them and to do what he can to give them some measure of security in the future. Robert Baratheon put bastards on half the women in the realm EXCEPT his wife, who he only married because of how rich and powerful her father was, and whose rebellion was touched off because Rhaegar Targaryean made off with his fiancee.

He's supposed to support Robb because his liege lords, the Tullys are allied with them through marriage, and because they're the ""good guys"", so honorable and above the petty treachery of the Game of Thrones. If anything, the Freys and Starks should be natural allies, both holding in contempt the pretense and falsity with which the great lords attempt to play each other - though Walder is rightly upset that more often the Tullys and other great lords have snubbed him and his family. He's upfront about wanting to be compensated for his support and he's hated for it. It must baffle and infuriate him that all the great houses spend so much time scheming for advantages over each other, and it's accepted common knowledge that they do so, and yet when he's straightforward in wanting marriages and promises in exchange for his support, he's reviled.

So, we come to Robb's Rebellion - the justification for which hinges on Robb insisting that his father was a just and honorable man and so he must have been lying about being a traitor to the crown. To Walder, either Ned was a traitor and no better than the Lannisters or other great houses, or he wasn't and still participated in the scheming and deception that the Starks insist they're above in order to secure his family's future.

So, finally, the value of the Freys is acknowledged - this young and determined new King insists upon his honor that he is not being false and promises Walder that his daughter, and by extension his family will have a high place in the New North, makes use of the crossing, and then betrays his promise and tries to fob Walder's daughter off onto one of his vassals, and not even to make the North stronger, but just to marry some pretty young Volantine/Westerling.

To him in must seem that these Starks, who demand loyalty through the promise of their honor, have been phenomenally false, treating his house with greater contempt and disregard than any who had come before. That their image of honor is just the boldest and falsest pretense of all in the Game of Thrones. He's not betraying honor for money, to him it seems he's just repaying scheming and falseness in kind. That he breaks the guest right must seem only fitting in the face of the enormity of the Starks' pretense.

I have to see Walder Frey not as the evil, vile snake who betrayed Robb, but as a wretched, tragic old man trying to keep his house together, promised the world by a silver tongued young wolf (Or more precisely, by his mother, which may have made it all the worse - he may have hated himself for trusting the Tullys who had always before treated him with contempt) and then made a fool.

**TL;DR:** If you strip away all the surface unpleasantry of the Freys, and don't take for granted that the Starks and the honorable, naive good guys - consider that to Walder it looks like Robb was intentionally lying to get what he wanted from House Frey... I'm not sure I can hate him for the Red Wedding.",4,2,False,self,,,,,

    ok, onto the question...
 
Ok, hopefully I can remain coherent here. So, in the TV show, Dany locks Xaro Xhoan Daxos in the vault with one of the wenches. If I recall correctly, this never happened in...I'm going to say ASOS? It's been a while so I'm not sure which book. But I'm sure they part ways on better terms than that.

Now, in the discussion thread for S3E09, Xaro was mentioned as one of the politically important deaths in the series. 

This now has me quite puzzled as I'm now about 27% into ADWD and in a recent Daenerys chapter, Xaro has returned to Dany with 13 ships and a plea to leave Meereen for Westeros.

What gives? Will the show imply that he escaped his vault somehow? Surely he'd want to now kill Dany rather than give her 13 ships. Maybe they'll have a different character offer her the ships and I shouldn't be so confused.

Should I just shut up and keep reading? Believe me, I will. ADWD is so good.

P.s. I'm currently up to the Jon chapter after Stannis has left Castle Black, so please consider any ADWD content. I think the last thing Dany did was decline the ships, so this might not feature in the TV show anyway!",5,8,False,self,,,,,

I've read Asos, feast and I'm currently halfway at page 700 in ADWD, but it's been a while since I read Feast and ASOS.

So, my first question is; Did every single Stark man die during the red wedding, or how many percent manage to survive? (Counting both the ones during the feast and the ones staying in tents outside.)

So, season 3's highlight or what I should call it, was the Red Wedding, just as season 1 and 2 had the execution of Eddard Stark and the Battle of Blackwater Bay. So I'm wondering what you think will be the season 4 and 5 ""highlights"" (Episode 9)?

The trial combat between Oberyn and Gregor could be episode 7-8 and the battle on The Wall could be ep 9, and then Tyrion getting rid of Tywin and Shae in the last episode, leaving the season in a cliffhanger where we dont know what Tyrion's plan is, or where his going from this point. (Non-readers ofc.)

But here's the million dollar question, I can't make up my mind on what events should be the ""highlight"" of season 5 (which prob will focus on AFFC and ADWD. 

Could you guys be speculating a bit about this?

I hate that beIN Sport USA got the contract.  I don't fault them, they are just a business that made a business offer for a service.  I get annoyed at ESPN and NBC - ESPN/ABC gets the home matches... how did they let themselves be outbid/undercut/whatever for the away ones?  Makes little to no sense to me.  NBC on the other hand is now promoting that they are the end all be all to Premier League soccer in the United States - why not go all in and try to corner the market?  I would argue that besides MLS, the two most followed soccer things are the USMNT and the Premier League.  NBC Sports already picks up some MLS games... why not go with the tagline 'We are soccer', and pick up the trifecta?

I understand that television rights are tough to wrap one's head around (the host country owns them, i.e. why home games are on ESPN, US Soccer sells the rights to them).  I get that Traffic Sports USA (a sports marketing firm that handles the away rights for a TON of Concacaf qualifiers and regional league matches) will sell to the highest bidder, i.e. beIN Sport, without regards to how many people can see a match.  I more blame FIFA's rules for this one - imagine if the north of England couldn't watch the last match, Brazil v. England, simply because England was away?  Wouldn't be pretty.  FIFA should still consider the USA an expanding market - a lot of untapped potential, and try to provide access to as many people as possible to grow the sport.    

It's probably a whole lot of business decisions and whatnot that I am not privy to/don't understand, but it is just ridiculously frustrating.  I will go out with some buddies to a bar in my town (Morristown, NJ), where there will be one television in the corner not showing the Yankees or Mets surrounded by soccer fans.  No volume (which, granted, can sometimes be a good thing with the announcers we sometimes get subjected to), bad angles, etc.  It's not so bad with a weekend game where we can travel to Hoboken, NJ or New York City to a soccer bar, which will probably be the case this weekend... but those midweek away qualifiers are tough to go out to a bar and stay out late.

I guess I'll just go back to calling Cablevision and trying to explain to the customer service rep after waiting on hold just what beIN Sport actually is (spelling it four or five times) and hoping that magically it is picked up...

Would the northern houses bend their knees to a house involved in a brutal violation of Guest Right? The only plausible allies the Boltons can have besides the Lannisters and the Freys are the Karstarks. Although they are powerful, the Freys aren't THAT reliable as a military force. 

Catelyn's death will put two major houses against the Boltons (Arryn and Tully) and on top of that, House Umber and House Reed are still very loyal to the Starks. If Osha succeeds taking Rickon to Last Hearth and Bran survives his antics beyond the Wall, both houses will know the Starks are still alive and will be much more inclined to obey their vows than side with people who commit high treason and violate Guest Right. Spreading the word of the Starks' survival will divide the North into those who will maintain their vows to House Stark and those who will side with the Boltons. 

tl;dr This war is far from over.

Is that based on history too?""**

""The Red Wedding is based on a couple real events from Scottish history. One was a case called The Black Dinner. The king of Scotland was fighting the Black Douglas clan. He reached out to make peace. He offered the young Earl of Douglas safe passage. He came to Edinburgh Castle and had a great feast. Then at the end of the feast, [the king's men] started pounding on a single drum. They brought out a covered plate and put it in front of the Earl and revealed it was the head of a black boar  the symbol of death. And as soon as he saw it, he knew what it meant. They dragged them out and put them to death in the courtyard. The larger instance was the Glencoe Massacre. Clan MacDonald stayed with the Campbell clan  overnight and the laws of hospitality supposedly applied. But the Campbells arose and started butchering every MacDonald they could get their hands on. No matter how much I make up, theres stuff in history thats just as bad, or worse.""

I finished only the first book (I read it before I began watching the show, strangely enough) and couldn't go on due to a rather heavy workload for my academic year, though I did manage to read around 400 pages of A Clash of Kings during that time. Anyway, I'm thinking about continuing the series now.
I have some trepidation about this, however, because I read that A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons were quite ""bad."" Some of the most caustic critiques I've read claimed that it undoes much of the work the first three books did. Others claimed that it was plodding and boring... at least compared to the first three books. 

So I want to ask, are A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons books ""bad""? If they are, in what way are they bad and to what degree, and are there any redeeming qualities to them? No spoilers, please, obviously. I think odds are good that I will go on reading the series (as well as watch it), but I would kind of like to know what to expect, quality-wise, about the series.",0,1,False,default,,,,,

 *****

I, like the majority of viewers was left in shock after the latest episode. Here is my review of it:

Lady Stark has always had strong maternal, yet highly paranoid qualities about her. She cherished her children, particularly Robert, her first born. She constantly feared about their decision making, and the death of her husband only exacerbated these qualities. In this dramatic and climatic scene, we see Catelyn undergo the five stages of grief which were very clearly exhibited. 

It was indeed her who noticed and looked up towards the musicians as they played their tune, a piece of music which almost peaceful and un-foretelling about what is to come. Her suspicion is even more aroused when she sees the guard closing the door of the wedding hall. This part may be considered as the **denial** stage as although she becomes uncomfortable, she still doesn't react. 

Roose then taunts her and guides her eyes to look down at his coated wrist. Upon seeing in horror that Roose is wearing his chain-mail under his coat, we see the fear in her eyes as she simultaneously slaps Roose and warns her son. We may consider this the **anger** phase, which is soon followed by her grabbing Walder's wife in what seems like an act of sheer desperation. 

Towards the climatic end of the scene, we see her **bargaining** to save her son's life, even offering her own life to save him. Lady Stark uses Walder's wife as a bargaining tool, which proves futile nonetheless. She swears by both sets of gods and appears to be willing to 'forget' the incident as long as her first born is allowed to leave the blood-shed hall. 

We then see her going to the brief, albeit powerful **depression** stage as she sees her first born, take the final stab and collapse in front of her, all whilst maintaining powerful eye contact. After a long and distraught wail, we see her in the **acceptance** stage as she drops the knife after killing Walder's wife and simply stares blankly at her dead son, waiting for herself to meet the same faith as did her husband and first-born son. 

The scene also depicts the murder of an unborn baby, something that is rarely depicted in television due to the macabre and insensitive qualities associated with it. Even the choice of weapon by Walder's men portrays his cowardice. By means of the unchivalrous crossbow, even a peasant is capable of taking down an armoured knight who underwent life-long training.

The lack of music during the closing credits is also an attempt to sympathise with viewers after such a gruesome, unexpected and devastating scene that left virtually all hope of the Stark family from ever gaining control of the kingdoms. ",2,0,False,self,,,,,

http://i.imgur.com/6obbyzz.png

Which seemed weird to me. What could be going on here? Who the hell is the guy on the left? Could this be the part where coldhands saves Sam (after he catches up with other night's watch ppl being attacked by wights)? I thought Coldhands would have been scrapped until s4, but we might get to see him after all!

Speculation: This scene is quite early, shows coldhands but not what happens. Middle of episode in the nightsfort we get the scene where Bran and co hear someone. Alluding to the monster we saw early on in the episode, but turning out to be Sam. Second to last scene, Bran and co go though the black gate and see Coldhands.

Watching the episode the other night, I found myself horrified and sickened. Although the scene was different from how I imagined it in the book, it was still a very realistic depiction of the scene and had its own details that made it uniquely horrible. After I watched it, I brooded for a while and struggled to sleep that night.

The next day I told my Dad to watch the episode ASAP. He's a non-book reader, so I was excited to hear about his reaction. After work that day, he watched it. He called me, and when I asked what he thought, this is what he said:

""It's about fucking time. They got what they deserved.""

I was about to snap on him, using terms like Bolton-lovin' and Frey-fuckin, but then I decided to let him clarify. I calmed down and asked for an explanation.

""I never liked Catelyn. She is bitter, impulsive and too arrogant for someone who is so codependent. Yes, she lost her children--but releasing the Kingslayer was part of what lost them the war. Her grief is no excuse for making decisions like that. And Robb, yeah he's won all the battles, but he failed to redeem his father, failed to hold the north, beat the Lannisters or save his siblings. He didn't make any differences. He failed because of his own choices. They deserved it.""

While I'm still slightly appalled by his opinion, I understand it. Robb and Catelyn were killed with treachery, but they sowed the seeds of that treachery. However much they deserved it, the intention of both GRRM and the writer's of the show was NOT to create this kind of reaction. The reaction was supposed to be horror and sadness--a great shock that is both a surprise and a logical result. It made me wonder:

Did other non-readers react this way? Perhaps the show's set-up was not as emotional as the book's--did some fans find the scene to be a 'comeuppance' of sorts?",29,47,False,self,,,,,

You'd have to assume it wasn't part of the plan, and if she was stupid enough to mention the mistake in one of her letters, perhaps she had to pay for that mistake with the unexpected ""abortion.""

It seems clear that the unborn baby was their concern rather than Talisa's own life, and that would also solve the issue of wondering how they even knew she was pregnant.

I loved seeing these, I hate to use this word because the show is anything but, ""cliche"" heroic characters like Robb and Ned who were doing everything they did out of honor and justice compared to and interacting with, not villainous, but cynical and harsh characters like Little Finger or Vaerys. The fact these characters die forces me to realize that this is show is one where honorable truly good men die, and we get to see the aftermath of it. The chaos. There's no room to be good. Everyone has blood on their hands. It's also a show where mistakes can't be made. Cersei was very right when she says, ""In the game of thrones you live or you die"". There's no room for missing a rung on the climb of the ladder. Robb made a mistake of acting ignorantly and marrying someone beautiful and he pays the ultimate price for it. I shame myself admitting that I was believer of the whole ""Robb takes the north cause he's a Stark, and Starks don't give a shit, Mother of Dragons takes the iron throne because it technically belongs to her and dragons beat White Walkers."" and I would have loved to see that happen but ever since this turn in the story I feel a heightened sense of excitement on what will happen next! I was torn apart by Robb's death, but now I just can't bear to wait for the finale and Season 4. Mormont is my new favorite character, and I guess I'm finally forced to root for Jon Snow. Perhaps those Lord of Light leeches will do the trick on Geoffrey. George R.R. Martin has truly created something special, a definite stepping stone in creative fiction, he makes a compelling story to say the least and the show is presented in such a fantastic way. It has inspired me to read the books just to get more out of the characters AFTER the seasons because in my opinion the show is presented in a better dramatic fashion. Once people get over it, I'm hope they realize it's never been a better time to be A Game of Thrones fan. Out of curiosity, which Episode 9 was the best in your opinion? Season 1's we lost Ned Stark, Season 2's was the battle of Black Water Bay, and then there was this recent one. Please yell at me, disagree with me, make points and conversations, let's immerse ourselves in this universe! tl;dr: Game of Thrones is SO good. ",6,0,False,default,,,,,

But I was wondering, what the hell is up with Young Griff. From Jon Connington's POV we know that Varys switched Aegon before he died, or at least convinced Jon, that Young Griff is truly Aegon. I have several questions.

1) The first is about the line of succession. Since Rhegar died before his father, does the throne rightly pass to Aegon, the Prince's son, or Viserys the king's remaining oldest son?

2) Assuming that Young Griff is truly Aegon (even if he's not everyone involved with the plot seems to believe it which pretty much achieves the same results), and is the true heir, what was the whole point of trying to raise an army of Dothraki behind Viserys? Why did Varys and Illyrio scheme to place him on the throne while all the time having another Targaryen they were planing to place on the throne as well? According to the golden company their original plan was to invade with Viserys and the Dothraki, yet all the while there was this ""true heir"" in their back pocket?

3) Conversely if Viserys, was the end game the whole time then what was the point of plotting Young Griff in the first place? Why keep him a secret from even the other Targaryens? 

My confusion is not about whether he really is Aegon, but why Varys plotted with both him AND Viserys. The only reason you would go through all this trouble with Aegon is if you suspected that Viserys would get killed or fail, and if he suspected it, why even bother with Viserys in the first place? If Aegon is the first in line it makes no sense to plot with Viserys in the first place, if he failed it would be a waste of resources that could be allocated to Aegon, if he succeeded the Seven Kingdoms would already be firmly under Viserys' rule and this questionable (in the eyes of the Westerosi who believed him dead) new Targaryen would be harder to place on the throne

The Red Wedding while I was reading the books was a massive turning point not only in the immediate story but for my expectations for the further story.  Mainly, it made me lose attachment from almost all the characters that I held dear. 

GRRM's writing style creates a realistic logic of events with the characters he has created, although when are the deaths too much, in a way they are detrimental to your feeling towards the characters, is it worth it?

They said they had never heard of it. After my initial shock, I told them it was a fantasy book series whose popularity exploded after being made in a TV show. 

My friend, of course, asked what it's all about. I was taken aback. I didn't really know where to begin. I'm also not very good at thinking on my feet. I told her some nonsense along the lines of how the story depicts the things happening on two continents of a medieval fantasy world. I followed that up by listing concept like war, politics, drama and murder, and concluded by saying it was very dark (~~and full of terrors~~), gruesome and sexual. 

That discussion prompted me to make this thread. The question is in the title. I'd prefer brevity here. I know it's a very complicated story, but a 1000+ word dissertation is not the kind of thing I would say to someone in person should this situation ever arise again.

1. At the start of Tywin's sack of King's Landing (after Aerys allowed him in), Jaime was told to bring Aerys the head of Tywin.

2. As Jaime was leaving to obey the king, Aerys Targaryen commanded his pyromancers to destroy the city.  (I believe that it was this point that Jaime decided to kill the betray the king and kill the pyromancer instead of his own father.)

3. Jaime kills the pyromancer out in the city somewhere, kills at least one more pyromancer, and returns to the king to prevent Aerys from sending out more pyromancers.

4. Eddard Stark makes it to the throne room before anyone else, and finds Jaime sitting on the throne, still pondering what he had just done.",5,5,False,self,,,,,

Eddard, Robb and Catelyn Stark have thus far all died, their key attributes have been the way they conduct themselves their Honor and Pride. Another key attribute is that they have also been extremely trusting, Ned of Littlefinger and Robb of Roose Bolton and the Freys. These qualities have had a key aspect in their demise. Sansa on the other hand has spent her most recent years surrounded by intrigue and deceit (most notably Cersei and Margaery's jossling over her due to her birthright) and has had the trust beaten out of her by Joffrey (Sansa incapable of trusting her new husband Tyrion, a Lanister). 

Sansa has most recently taken off with Littlefinger to the Vale where she has been further schooled in intrigue and stands to gain substantial standing through marriage to the heir of the Vale. Sansa looks set to become a major player who will not be as bound to Honor as her parents and brother were, ultimately making her a more dangerous Stark. In terms of other claimants, we have Arya, Brann, Rickon and a possibly legitimized returned from the dead Jon Snow as claimants. Arya has a lesser claim than Sansa and her path seems to be one of vengeance with no real political ambition. Brann is the strongest claimant but appears to be fulfilling a role similar to Blood Raven and staying beyond the wall with the Children of the Forrest. Rickon although possibly the strongest claimant due to being male and having working legs has disappeared to Skagos with Osha and is not a POV character. Possibly Davos' mission to locate Rickon will be fruitful and Rickon will fulfill Stannis' potential role for Jon as heir to Winterfell which is the only way I can see Rickon reentering the narrative aside from becoming a new POV character. Jon is a tricky one to pin down, he is either dead, dead but revived by Mel, survives his wounds or Azor Azhai reborn. He also has a potential legitimization making him lower than all trueborn heirs in line for Winterfell but Jon has frequently showed that he stays true to his oath as a member of the Nights Watch, even if he does err when it comes to red heads. I doubt Jon will be so quick to put down the black. The way things are transpiring Sansa seems like the Starks best chance at reclaiming the North.

When Walder was going on about how hot Robb's wife is, my boyfriend and I expected him to permanently mar her face at the very least, as way of repaying Robb for his insult and betrayal. It seemed like a just and reasonable reaction, however unpleasant.

But then he seemed like he was going to forgive Robb, and I kind of went into an immortal main character sulk where I was disengaged by what I perceived as poor writing.

When the music started playing, I was just completely confused. The slow shots indicated that I was meant to realize *something*, but what? I remember Cersei talking about it in an earlier episode, but I didn't remember the tune or anything. I don't think I notice the music in the show at all outside of the opening theme. (That and the bear song.)

Then the stabbings started, and my reaction was ""Well, why didn't he just do that earlier? &gt;:/"" (Yes, I realize now that the idea was to get the army drunk.)

Then they showed Grey Wind in a box. IN A **BOX**. I said to my boyfriend, ""Have you noticed how all the living Starks with living dire wolves don't chain up their protective death machines? These people pretty much deserve it at this point."" The stupidly off-hand way of his death removed any emotional impact the scene might have had for me. Who puts a goddamn dire wolf in a box? It just felt like ""Well, he has to die somehow... Let's put him in a box!""

~~Arya realizing her brother and mother had died when she was so close to reuniting with them was a chance for me to shed some sympathy tears, but I don't feel her acting was up to par for this. I just didn't feel it. I saw an actor trying to play a sad girl rather than someone who'd just had their heart ripped out. (Which is odd because I've never had any problems with the actress prior to this.)~~ /u/strongbad3689 pointed out that there's no reason to assume she believed them dead at this point. This was purely my own error.

The only person I really sympathized with was Edmure and his wife. Was she in on it? He was so happy, and it would be sad to see him murdered. And if that happened, was she murdered with him? Maybe she had no idea how she was being used. Was *he* in on it? It would be absolutely shocking if the entire thing had been an act on his part. And if he was in on it, and she wasn't, what would happen to her then? I was worried about them to the point that I actually went out and looked up what happens.

Catelyn was an amazing character. She was a very believable human being, and her actress was great. But she wasn't a very nice person. Has everyone forgotten how she treated Jon? How she broke an oath made to the gods? It's quite possible that every bad thing that's happened up to this point is directly her fault, as punishment. I was sad to see an interesting character leave the series, but not sad in an emotional way, not sad that a person died.

Talisa was always likeable enough, but she never struck me as very interesting. Since she was introduced, I felt like the writers had been saying, ""Hey, you should like this character. She's someone you should like,"" as if she were a prop. And in hindsight, I'm now convinced she was contrived entirely for this point, to manipulate people into crying. Baby Ned was contrived as fuck.

And then we come to Robb. Robb, who decided to claim a throne not rightfully his when he ought to have backed Stannis. Robb, who broke an oath that started this mess. Robb, who put a dire wolf in a box. Not really feeling the sympathy.

So I see all these reaction videos with people crying, and all these posts about how everyone hates GRRM now. I don't get it. Dude seems like a fantastic writer to me. A lot of the things I've complained about here went down differently in the book, in a way that makes everything make a lot more sense. (I read some mildly spoilery things after seeing the episode.) Maybe I'd have felt something if I'd been a reader. I'm really fired up to read the series now, just as soon as I finish another.

tl;dr: Is anyone else out there not bawling their eyes out, or am I a heartless monster?

Edit: I should probably also mention that I'm really glad there aren't any more Starks trying for the throne because now I don't have to worry about Dany killing them all when she makes her try. Arya vs. Daenerys is not a situation for which I'm prepared to choose sides.",13,0,False,default,,,,,

But some people are suggesting that because of his hypothetical Targaryen blood, Jon might come back to life after being burned in a pyre... Well, not all Targaryen's can survive fire/heat, Viserys was killed by molten gold, and Jon burned his hand while fighting an Other in aGoT and took weeks healing.

I guess I'm asking is there any real reason to hope he's not really dead?

He mentioned something about the ending being ""bitter sweet"" somewhere else as well and this got me thinking and I'd like the opinion of book readers and show watchers alike. Please keep discussions within where the show is currently, you can add insights into where you've read up until but please don't forget the spoiler tags.

I gave this some thought and I've concluded that the ending for GoT really can not be a final type ending like in LOTR etc. simply because there is no real defined single enemy. Everyone has their own agenda and even though there are some ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" they aren't absolute.

The ending will simply be a point in Westeros' history/future where someone probably takes The Iron Throne in epic like fashion. It will be kind of like at the end of Robert's rebellion and we all know that the story didn't end there.

The world that GRRM has created has endless possibilities with new characters as well as plot points if you really think about it. Let's say Stannis takes the throne somehow (I am only on book 1 so I have very little insight here, just an example). Even if he does this, it is in no way the end of the story as there will be loads of houses out to get him and even his ""allies"" might plot against him.

When Robert visited Winterfell, he and the Royal Family were at the Lord's Table, with Ned and his brood.  The ""common"" folk sat below.  Why were Robb, Talisa, Catelyn and Roose all sitting down at the tables below with the bannermen, etc?  

Of course there's nothing to be done for it, but it's a natural human instinct to think, ""How could they have saved themselves,"" or something along those lines.  Some [weak] part of me wants to think that something as little as this might have helped but it doesn't really matter, I'm still curious why the King shouldn't sit at the Lord's table with his banner-lord, and why he should be summoned to stand at Lord Walder's behest.  

(I know they were trying to get him to give his armies, and that they had already sleighted him, but still, Robb's the king.  Maybe that was one of his flaws?  Showing weakness through apology?)",8,5,False,self,,,,,

Pick any event in the aired 3 seasons and make it different. Either due to chance, or because somebody made a different decision. Post the different outcome as a main comment.

Now all sub comments can project what happens next in that timeline. Further sub comments can continue the story step by step. Make a branch comment if you think the story would unfold differently.

Upvote main comment if you find the different outcome interesting and upvote the sub comments if you think the story continues realistically. So we get a kind of crowd-sourced story tree of lots of different alternate stories of the Game of Thrones world.

I will create quick samples to get it started in the next minutes after this is posted.

I've compiled a good sized list of some of my favorite shots that do a lot in terms of foreshadowing, illustrating characters and their relationships, visual metaphors, etc.  I'd bet most of these are intentional, but I admit that some of them are probably film school bullshit.  As the saying goes, sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.  But sometimes a cigar is also a penis.  So if that sort of thing interests you, read on.  If not, turn back now!  
  
Also, I'm sure some of these have been posted before, but I'm including them anyway.  
  
**Illustrating the Scene**  
  
-One of my favorite visual storytelling techniques is simply illustrating what is happening in the scene with composition, lighting, framing, etc.  Probably the most popular example of this is [Ned's choice](http://i.imgur.com/lxOhObF.png) in the pilot episode.  Simple scene composition illustrates the choice he must make between family on the left and duty/honor on the right.  It's also a good reflection of Ned's character.  *(See Below: Illustrating Character)*  
  
-This almost exact same shot is used to illustrate [Theon's Choice](http://i.imgur.com/h3g2kPZ.png) as well.  The quill on his right, the candle on his left, showing his choice between writing a letter to Robb or [burning that bridge.](http://i.imgur.com/obtvhyN.png)  That second shot is also a good example of illustrating character.  
  
-Or you can look at what the character is doing in the scene, like in [this scene with Arya.](http://i.imgur.com/9nkm6R0.png)  Here, Yoren tells Arya a story about how he got vengeance on a man who wronged him, planting the seeds of revenge in Arya's mind and giving her the idea of saying her ""prayers"" where she recites the names of those she's going to kill.  So how do her actions reflect what's happening here?  She's cleaning Needle.  I also find it interesting that her companions are shown sleeping behind her, almost resembling corpses.  
  
-In an early Daenerys scene, she gets into an argument with her brother Viserys.  She calls Drogo's khalasar *her* people, and Viserys corrects her, saying they're *his* people.  Then they cut to [this shot of the khalasar.](http://i.imgur.com/RUHoe0V.png)  Dany's right amongst the group, and Viserys is so far out front by himself it's almost hard to notice him.  So who's people are they again?  
  
**Illustrating Similarities**  
  
-Sometimes two scenes can be shot the same way or include similar happenings in order to relate them to each other, such as this one that I've seen posted before -- [a wolf in the lion's den.](http://i.imgur.com/ACywa4w.png)  
  
-[Catelyn protecting her sons.](http://i.imgur.com/5kklh0H.jpg)  
  
-[Sansa's doll in Season 1 vs. Season 2](http://i.imgur.com/uA1pJZr.png)  
  
-And here's a callback to events that happened before the show's timeline.  [Ned and Jaime in the throne room.](http://i.imgur.com/f6Me4ID.png)  What do they talk about in this scene?  Jaime killing King Aerys.
  
**Foreshadowing**  
  
-Probably the most obvious and well-known foreshadowing is the [dead direwolf](http://i.imgur.com/0EGya7d.png) and [stag](http://i.imgur.com/uXe2tBz.png) in the pilot.  
  
-Another one that pops up often is [Tywin flaying a stag](http://i.imgur.com/abv2y8i.png) in the same episode that King Robert dies.  
  
-But sometimes it's more subtle.  Right before Lord Commander Mormont eats it, the Night's Watch lights up [a funeral pyre for a fallen comrade.](http://i.imgur.com/3fl9E5c.png)  In the very same shot, the camera pans up and for a moment [Mormont's in the pyre as well.](http://i.imgur.com/RZQNUpo.png)  A couple shots later [he's there again.](http://i.imgur.com/oaUzrlc.png)  No other character in the scene is [shot like that.](http://i.imgur.com/2wHHPyk.png)  Mormont dies in the next scene.  
  
-I've listed two more at the bottom of the post for spoiler purposes.
  
-Sometimes it's not direct foreshadowing, but more of a simple foreboding image for what's about to come.  For example, [Arya snapping a pigeon's neck](http://i.imgur.com/cRM7dxj.png) moments before her father is beheaded.  
  
-Or [red wine spilling](http://i.imgur.com/eoiehXj.png) moments before the Red Wedding.  Or another Red Wedding one, [the Freys and Boltons looming behind the Stark direwolves.](http://i.imgur.com/f3SLUdN.png)  
  
**Illustrating Character**  
  
-Foreshadowing is fun and all, but my favorite has to be when a single shot can tell us a lot about [what's going on with a character.](http://i.imgur.com/obtvhyN.png)  
  
-Without ever being told, we know that there's some kind of connection between [Bran and his wolf.](http://i.imgur.com/ptw7jSo.png)  
  
-And again, [Bran looks at his reflection in the pool,](http://i.imgur.com/FqAQvHs.png) where moments before, [so was his wolf.](http://i.imgur.com/JBXw7wK.png)  
  
-Reflections are used a few times.  At Tyrion and Sansa's wedding, Tyrion makes sure there's nothing stuck in his teeth by using a beat up dish, [which makes him appear distorted and grotesque.](http://i.imgur.com/W1VOKF5.png)  That tells us a lot about how he sees himself, how others see him, and how Sansa sees him.  
  
-Speaking of Sansa, after supping with Cersei and her children, [Sansa looks at her own reflection.](http://i.imgur.com/JOCi9Mt.png)  The mirror is fogged and dirty, and only a portion of her face is clear.  She's spent so long pretending to be a Lannister she can barely see her old self.  A season later, while getting fitted for her wedding dress for her marriage to Loras (or so she thinks) she looks at her reflection again.  The mirror is still dirty, but [she can see herself much clearer now.](http://i.imgur.com/bYn9Flj.png)  
  
-[When Stannis visits Davos in jail,](http://i.imgur.com/5aj0hd8.png) Stannis looks like the one behind bars.  His current mindset makes him less free than Davos, a man who is more sure of himself.  This shot also says a lot about their relationship, which brings me to...  
  
**Character Relationships**  
  
-The way characters are arranged in a scene can say a lot about their relationships.  Davos quite often represents Stannis's conscience.  He's usually close by, [hovering over his shoulder giving Stannis counsel.](http://i.imgur.com/6jkq3Xg.png)  Now compare that to this shot in season 3, after [Davos first returns from Blackwater.](http://i.imgur.com/aOLucoj.png)  Davos is a blurry figure far in the background, Stannis facing away from him and [toward Melisandre.](http://i.imgur.com/RdFuv3t.png)  What's that say about where Stannis is at as a character?  Compare it to one of the [first scenes with the three of them.](http://i.imgur.com/H34ODZS.png)
  
-One of my favorites, [Jaime peeing by a tree, his stream going right over Brienne's head.](http://i.imgur.com/NPOZgWL.png)  It's pretty obvious what he thinks of her.  Now compare that to a few episodes later.  Roose Bolton threatens the both of them and Brienne grabs a knife, but Jaime grabs her hand and stops her.  And for a moment, [they sit holding hands.](http://i.imgur.com/IdQIKSX.png)  They are growing more fond of each other.  
  
-Here's a simple one.  Varys and Littlefinger, [two sides of the same coin.](http://i.imgur.com/HuFXgG2.png)  
  
-Another simple, and extremely common one, [Tyrion and Cersei.](http://i.imgur.com/06gDSFG.png)  Characters at odds with each other often face away from each other.  That's a pretty standard one.  
  
-Here's more of an artsy one.  [Tyrion watches his new wife undress.](http://i.imgur.com/HbTwCuC.png)  Not the most intimate wedding night.  
  
-This one got a lot of upvotes recently, [a small flame vs. a tall flame.](http://i.imgur.com/wRT2FNN.png)  But how about [this one?](http://i.imgur.com/imDD1OM.png)  Joffrey sits high above Tywin, yet Tywin still towers over Joffrey.  
  
-Here's a good illustration of [Jorah being in the friendzone.](http://i.imgur.com/OsON3dk.png)  
  
**tl;dr** A bunch of over analyzing.  
  
There's way more than the ones I posted, what are some good ones I missed?

I think these sum up my feelings a good deal.

http://filmcrithulk.wordpress.com/2011/07/11/hulk-read-a-book-exactly-why-a-feast-for-crows-a-terrible-waste-of-1000-pages/

before reading these I want to add a disclaimer that simply linking you to an article from the Film Crit Hulk where he goes on to deconstruct Martin's writing does the Hulk a huge disservice. He is an incredibly honest and thoughtful writer with a good sense of humor but between his style and the more sensative content of these articles I think some of you may take an immediate aversion to the him. That is something I desperately want to avoid because alienating anyone from a super nice guy like the Hulk would make me feel like a terrible person. That being said, I think he articulates some fantastic points against Martin's books in general and really reinforces why I think the show show is great.

tl;dr I totally understand if you guys don't want to read two very long essays in all caps, I really only posted them there because they sum up my feelings rather well and instead of writing out a lengthy argument that can't possibly do justice to the Hulk's points, I thought that I would just link his articles. So when in doubt just go with the title question.

Of course, the whole point of this series of posts will be to give some extra information to non-readers about the history of this wonderfully-constructed world, so most of what will be here is taken from the books, even if it contains no spoilers.

Before we talk about the actual Conquest, its necessary to take a good look at the way Westeros feudal system has developed the nine regions of Westeros. For those who want to keep everything straight in their minds, here are the nine regions I speak:

##REGIONS

Region  Current Lord/Castle for referencePre-Conquest ruler

* NorthThe Starks of WinterfellKing Torrhen Stark ruled the North from Winterfell
* Iron IslandsThe Greyjoys of PykeKing Harren the Black of House Hoare ruled from Pyke. His kingdom included
* RiverlandsThe Tullys of Riverruna subjugated kingdom ruled by the Ironborn.
* WesterlandsThe Lannisters of Casterly RockKing Loren Lannister ruled from Casterly Rock.
* The Vale of ArrynThe Arryns of the EyrieQueen Regent Sharra Arryn ruled for her son Ronnel from the Eyrie
* CrownlandsStannis Baratheon on DragonstoneNot very united; Aegon and the Targaryens ruled solely Dragonstone. Kings Landing didnt exist yet.
* StormlandsThe Baratheons of Storms EndKing Argilac the Arrogant Durrendon ruled from Storms End
* The ReachThe Tyrells of HighgardenKing Mern Gardener ruled from Highgarden
* DorneThe Martells of SunspearPrincess Mariya Martell ruled from Sunspear

##THE NORTH

The Starks have been the rulers of the North from Winterfell since before the Conquest, as you can see. The Starks are descended from Bran the Builder, who I briefly mentioned a few weeks ago. He is called the Builder because he built the Wall, and probably Winterfell as well. Brandon is a repeating name throughout the Stark family tree.

At this point, the Starks call themselves Kings in the North. Sons that did not stand to inherit often went to serve the Nights Watch for the honor of the family. The Starks were notoriously uncontested as Kings for their entire history, except by one house, House Bolton. The rivalry between the two houses was a fierce thing, and the Boltons rebelled multiple times.

##IRON ISLANDS/RIVERLANDS
Some hundreds of years before the Conquest, the Storm King attacked the Riverlands and conquered most of the various areas that lesser kings had once claimed. Just recently, however, the Ironborn attacked and pushed them out. King Harren the Black was celebrated in the Isles for his defeat of the Storm King.

Afterwards, Harren built himself a castle, meant to be the grandest of them all. It would have countless hearths and towers and halls. It covers at least three times as much area as any other castle. And what did Harren call his castle? Harrenhal (I believe were all familiar with it). Well talk about Harrenhals fate a little bit when we get to the actual conquest.

##THE WESTERLANDS

The Lannisters, like the Starks, have been controlling their region since before the Conquest. House Lannister was started by a trickster named Lann the Clever, who tricked the head of House Casterly into giving up their seat, Casterly Rock. Eventually, after the Andal invasion, Lanns descendents married the Andals, and House Lannister was formed.

##THE VALE OF ARRYN

The Arryns are another family that have been in power long. If youll recall the Arryns: Jon Arryn was Roberts first Hand, killed before the pilot. His wife is Catelyns sister, who breastfeeds their child who is long past weaning age. House Arryn was formed when the Andal Ser Artys Arryn slew the last Mountain King and pushed his people into the Mountains of the Moon. He became the King of the Mountains and Vale, which was later renamed the Vale of Arryn. At this point, a young king, Ronnel, has inherited the Throne, with his mother Sharra as his regent.

##THE REACH

House Gardener were the Kings of the Reach. Not much is really known about them. Their castellan, the man who ran the castle in their absence, was Harlen Tyrell. As you could probably guess, this becomes important later.

##STORMLANDS

The Stormlands, which are currently Baratheon lands, were sworn to the Storm King. House Durrendon was the royal house of the Stormlands, and Storms End was raised by the founder of their line (much like Winterfell and the Starks). Its sigil was a crowned black stag on a yellow field, and its words were Ours is the Fury. If that sounds familiar to you, it should. Those are the sigil and words of House Baratheon, though it was adopted much later by them. The current House Baratheon is descended through the female line of House Durrendon.

##DORNE

Dorne, which has been an ethnical mix of Rhoynish and Andal, is probably the most unique kingdom in the realm. As I probably mentioned before, Rhoynish tradition dictated that an older sister inherits before a brother. For instance, in regular law, the Stark line of succession goes RobbBranRickonSansaArya, while under Dornish law, it would go RobbSansaAryaBranRickon, by age.

Princess Mariya Martell (they are called Prince and Princess instead of King and Queen) was an eighty year old woman at the time of the Conquest. She was fat, blind, and almost bald. While there isnt much to say about the Dornish before the Conquest, they have probably the best response against the Targaryen invasion.

There are some other areas where there are Kings that just rule their own castle and nearby lands. Maidenpool had a king named Jon Mooton, but he ruled over such little land that he and the kings like him are considered insignificant.

##DRAGONSTONE

At this point, Aegon I Targaryen is the head of the House. He has two sisters, Rhaenys and Visenya, both of whom would become his wives. Aegons dragon was named Balerion the Black Dread, and is considered to be one of the largest, strongest, most fearsome dragons in history. Rhaenys rode Meraxes and Visenya rode Vhagar. Not that its important, but Aegon considered Rhaenys his favorite sister-wife.

When the Targaryens were approached by the Valyrian remnants after the Doom, with some minor lords and families wanting to unite the fallen Freehold and reclaim their former glory, Aegon ignored their pleas for help. He and his dragons (and his warrior/princess sister-wives) had a bigger fish to fry, and it was to the West, not the East.

##CAUSE OF CONQUEST

The Conquest officially begins when Aegon and his sisters land at the mouth of the Blackwater Rush with their dragons and a host of ~1600 men. The spot where they landed would later become known as Kings Landing, and it would become one of the largest cities in the world, as well as the capital of Aegons kingdom. But well get to that next week.

As Harren the Black neared completion of Harrenhal, the Storm King seemed to be nervous that the Ironborn would try and conquer his kingdom. Having grown afraid of the Ironborn, Argilac proposed an alliance with Aegon, hoping Aegon would be a buffer between him and Harren. To seal the deal, he offered the hand of his daughter, Argella, as well as a dowry of lands (though much of the lands belonged to Harren in truth).

Aegon refused to marry the girl, but instead offered the hand of his best friend and bastard brother Orys Baratheon. Of course, the Storm King took this as an insult and had the hands of the envoy cut off and sent back to Aegon with the message These are the only hands you will receive.

Aegon decided that there would be only one king in the realm, and sent ravens to every ruler in the Seven Kingdoms, and that those who bent the knee would keep their lands and titles.

In response, Queen Regent Sharra Arryn of the Vale offered to marry Aegon and seal an alliance, provided her son would be Aegons heir. Mariya Martell of Dorne replied that she would be his ally against the Storm King, but would not yield to him. Aegon rejected both offers, and it seemed none of the other rulers would submit.

For the war, Aegon has the Painted Table constructed in Dragonstone, a full scale table in the shape of Westeros with all of the castles and towns and cities mapped on it. He took his wives, and landed at Kings Landing.

When he landed, he began construction on a small keep to be his base. He sent envoys to nearby towns and castles. Jon Mooton of Maidenpool was the first to bend the knee. Rosby, Stokeworth, and Duskendale all also bent the knee to the new King. The region around King's Landing, which includes most of these areas, is now known as the Crownlands.

The major parts of the Conquest will be covered next week. Well see him butt heads with the Arryns and the Starks and the Lannisters, among others. Some will bend the knee easily, and some must be destroyed. Alliances will be forged and smashed, and by the end of the Conquest, only one sole region will defy him.

* Bran warging Dany's dragon(s) and laying waste to her army
* Rob holding Ned Jr.

&gt;In a room sit three great men, a king, a priest, and a rich man with his gold. Between them stands a sellsword, a little man of common birth and no great mind. Each of the great ones bids him slay the other two. Do it, says the king, for I am your lawful ruler. Do it, says the priest, for I command you in the names of the gods. Do it, says the rich man, and all this gold shall be yours. So tell mewho lives and who dies?

He ultimately concludes that ""Power resides where men believe it resides.""


I want to introduce a concept that helps shed more light on how power works: [Schelling Points.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schelling_point)

&gt;Consider a simple example: two people unable to communicate with each other are each shown a panel of four squares and asked to select one; if and only if they both select the same one, they will each receive a prize. Three of the squares are blue and one is red. Assuming they each know nothing about the other player, but that they each do want to win the prize, then they will, reasonably, both choose the red square. Of course, the red square is not in a sense a better square; they could win by both choosing any square. And it is the ""right"" square to select only if a player can be sure that the other player has selected it; but by hypothesis neither can. It is the most salient, the most notable square, though, and lacking any other one most people will choose it, and this will in fact (often) work.


Power works much the same way. The soldier must serve whoever he thinks people around him will serve, so as to put himself on the winning side. Powerful people are like human Schelling points, and having ""a strong claim to the throne"" is like being a square with a bright red colour. People think other people will serve you, so people flock to you. In the game above, some people might choose the brightest square, while some will choose the biggest square. In Westeros blood and marriage ties are the arbitrary feature that determines power, but the Dothraki see personal strength as the mark of a Schelling point. People of the free cities are more likely to follow wealth.",32,341,False,self,,,,,

&gt; **Struggles with the Douglases**

&gt; ----

&gt; In 1449 James II reached adulthood, yet in many ways his ""active kingship"" differed little from his minority. The Douglases used his coming of age as a way to throw the Livingstons out of the shared government, as the young king took revenge for the brief arrest of his mother (a means to remove her from political influence) that had taken place in 1439. Douglas and Crichton continued to dominate political power, and the king's ability to rule without them remained arguably limited. 

&gt; But James did not acquiesce with this situation without argument, and between 1451 and 1455 he struggled to free himself from the power of the Douglases...  In 1440 the young William Douglas, 6th Earl of Douglas and his brother were invited to dine with the ten year-old King James II of Scotland. The dinner was organised by Sir William Crichton of Clan Crichton. 

&gt; The king of Scotland was fighting the Black Douglas clan. He reached out to make peace. He offered the young Earl of Douglas safe passage. He came to Edinburgh Castle and had a great feast. Then at the end of the feast, [the king's men] started pounding on a single drum. They brought out a covered plate and put it in front of the Earl and revealed it was the head of a black boar  the symbol of death. And as soon as he saw it, he knew what it meant. After the dinner the Douglas chiefs were dragged out to Castle Hill, given a mock trial and beheaded in the courtyard.

Also, I'm curious as to the book/show split - so are you a book-reader?


For me, as a lowly show-watcher (I'm saving the books as a reward for myself once I accomplish some big goals) I don't see any other choice but the Targs (except maybe Hodor) - I mean the Starks are boring, the Lannisters cruel, the Tullys seem weak, the Greyjoys are so bleak, the Tyrells are cool and all - but motherfucking DRAGONS! Dany's got DRAGONS!

I feel a lot of the 'lesser houses' will be book-readers by necessity - us show-watchers either aren't aware of them yet/never will be, we only know the big houses that have been shown, really.

So - is your flair your vote for the Iron Throne? Who you relate to the most? The most badass house?",253,37,False,self,,,,,

---
**Thesis-y Thing**

---

I spent a lot of my time awake without other people around: my sleep schedule is more fucked than a whore on the day of the Hand's Tourny. So I play Game of Thrones a lot in the background and I couldn't help but notice a lot of events that precede RW but try to accomplish the same goals via the same means. Sort of.

---
**Assassination Attempts**

---

The first comparable instance comes with the numerous failed assassination attempts on Daenerys' life : 


Robert Baratheon: The whore is pregnant.

Eddard Stark: You're speaking of murdering a child.

*RB*: I warned you this would happen, back in the North. I warned you, but you didn't care to hear. Well, hear it now: I want them dead. Mother and child both, and that fool Viserys as well. Is that plain enough for you? I want them both dead.

*ES*: You'll dishonor yourself forever if you do this.

*RB*: Honor? I've got Seven Kingdoms to rule! One king, Seven Kingdoms! Do you think honor keeps them in line? Do you think it's honor that's keeping the peace? It's fear! Fear and blood!

*ES*: Then we're no better than the Mad King!

Although never really succeeding, Robert fosters the same brutal habits that his wife, father-in-law and vassel all show at RW: he plans to kill a women and her child, and her hubbie, for the sake of protecting the realm.

But the real comparison, I think, is to be made between the methods : the RW isn't special because it is brutal. Brutality is rife. But it invokes fear through lack of honor. House rites are broken, as are the welcoming rules. They change the rules to win.

---
**Bastards Galore**

---

Joffrey, as heir, goes about ordering the culling of his claimed-father's bastards. Incomparable considering it is against his own people rather than an enemy, it still highlights the inherit violence dealing with the Game of Thrones.

---

So I could be barking up the wrong Weirwood tree but could it be the only thing that separates Robert's attempt on someone else's life and Tywin's is that one succeeded? 

If so, why is RW heralded as a ""game changer""? It seems to have been a part of the game for a while.

What I'm wondering, if my memory serves me correctly, I remember Sansa's direwolf dying to Ned, I remember the Frey's killing one Direwolf outside the wedding, I think the other 3 have run away and haven't been seen with the exception of Bran's recent episode.  Could it be that the 3 dead direwolves (the pilot, sansa's and the wedding one) could be seen as Ned, Catelyn and Robb dying?

Book-readers are forced to tread lightly, speak in spoiler tags and ambiguous statements, and can't openly discuss theories and concepts that would be dangerous for a show-watcher to hear. Not to mention, the mods ban anyone who says anything even mildly negative about show-watchers, and the vast majority of posts cater to, are made by, or strictly involve people who watch the show (or book-readers regarding how show-watchers react). It's a little sad that somone can respond to a post querying the return of a character book-readers know all about with a very harmless, non-derogitory, playful comment and still be banned because they might have hurt a show-watchers feelings. There is favoritism here.
There needs to be a subreddit for book-readers. A place where we can discuss conspiracies and later events without having to worry over the mental health of a show-watcher. There needs to be a place to openly converse about things that strictly show-watchers will never know about. I love the GoT subreddit, don't get me wrong, but with the high popularity of the show and how much it eclipses the popularity of the books, we need to give ourselves (as book-readers) freedom to speak on what we wish.
So that's why I would like to start a new subreddit; a true ASoIaF subreddit, wherein show-watchers who fear spoilers beware, and book-readers may freely speculate and gush about the books without worrying over being banned or having to slap spoiler tags on their every other sentence.
Who's with me?

I finally recovered from the last episode, so here it goes. If this is your first time here, everything's made up and the points don't matter.

Walder Frey +15 (Season Total: +15): Father, lord, wedding planner extraordinare. 

Roose Bolton +9 (Season Total: +19): Tha Roose Is Loose!!!!!  Roose is a treacherous bastard, but selling Robb out was probably the only way to save his ass so I can't blame him. But damn.

Bran Stark +7 (Season Total: +11) Warging like a boss.

Daenyrs Targaryen +6 (Season Total: +45): Great, you liberated Yunkai. Now can we go to Westeros?

Daario Naharis +5 (Season Total: +13): Everybody was Yunkai fighting, Daario was fast as lightning

Jon Snow +4 (Season Total: +25): Well you blew your cover, but it was bound to happen. At least you got a few good licks in before you ran away like a bitch.

The Hound +3 (Season Total: +11): Aside from wanting to kill the the old food merchant on the road, the Hound is an all around good guy in my book. Just misunderstood.

Tormund +3 (Season Total: +3): Wilding ax: 5 pieces of silver. Fur parka: 9 pieces of silver. Horses: Free. Getting to give Ygritte the ""I told you so"" face: Priceless.

Arya Stark +3 (Season Total: 6): Plus one for being late to the wedding, and plus two for standing up to the biggest, scariest man in Westeros. 

Hodor +2 (Season Total: +2): Hodor. Hodor, hodor hodor hodor. Hodor.

Now I understand some of these roles might not appear in season 4, but Ramsay wasn't supposed to appear this season either, so we never really know.

1. Oberyn Martell - Daniel Bernhardt (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0076780/?ref_=sr_1)
I'll start off with an obvious one. This guy would make a perfect Prince Oberyn - everything about him is right for the role. He's got the Martial Arts experience (Matrix &amp; Mortal Combat) that make me think he'd be perfect with a spear, and it'd make his big fight more entertaining. And he's got Oberyn's angular looks.

2. Euron Greyjoy - Ian McShane (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0574534/?ref_=tt_cl_t4)
He's 61, and still does combat roles. He played King Brahmwell in the Jack the Giant Slayer this year, and already has a history of pirate roles with Blackbeard (the next best thing to Euron Greyjoy) in 2011. He might not be the perfect age for the role, but I think he'd make a great Euron.

3. Victarion Greyjoy - Vladimir Kulich (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0474520/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1)
Who better for the role of Euron's big, muscly brother than Ulfric Stormcloak, Eric from ""Vikings"" and Captain Tiberius from ""Ironclad""? I noticed this guy in Ironclad, which I watched a couple days ago, and immediately thought he'd be perfect for the role.

4. Aeron Greyjoy - Craig Walsh Wrightson (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0942952/?ref_=tt_cl_t7)
That guy from Spartacus. While bigger names like Campling and John Ryan seem to be the favorites, I always imagined Aeron to look like this guy. Give him a grey wig and a sparse beard, and he'd be perfect.

5. Ellaria Sand - Freida Pinto (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2951768/?ref_=tt_cl_t4)
Ellaria isn't supposed to be traditionally good looking, but if they can make Ygritte (who was only reasonably attractive in the books) THAT hot, it shouldn't be a problem with Ellaria. Much like Kulich, when I saw her in Immortals, I thought she HAS to be Ellaria. She just has to be.

6. The Kindly Man - Jaqen H'Ghar
Honestly, there are too many theories about them being the ssame person, and even if it ends up not being the case in the books, it would reduce casting fees, and make for an awesome turn of events. If we need a kindly man, we'll need a Waif too, but honestly, any blondde child star would do - as long as she shows the same maturity Maisie did in Season 1.

7. Donal Noye - Viggo Mortensen (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001557/?ref_=sr_1)
I wanted to do this without calling up huge names, but Viggo would be the perfect Donal. The one-arm thing will have to be fixed (though honestly, with all the changes the show's made, doing away with thaat would be nothing). Honestly, this is a two or three episode role, and who doesn't wanna see Aragorn in Game of Thrones?

That's pretty much all of the really big characters we get to see. Lord Manderly, Lord Blacktyde, Cotter Pyke, Denys Mallister and many more might appear but also might not. And if Mace Tyrell was shunned this season, there's no reason to assume he'll be around in the next one.",4,2,False,default,,,,,

When the flames were blazing nicely Meera put the fish on. At least it's not a meat pie. The Rat Cook had cooked the son of the Andal king in a big pie with onions, carrots, mushrooms, lots of pepper and salt, a rasher of bacon, and a dark red Dornish wine. Then he served him to his father, who praised the taste and had a second slice. Afterward the gods transformed the cook into a monstrous white rat who could only eat his own young. He had roamed the Nightfort ever since, devouring his children, but still his hunger was not sated. ""It was not for murder that the gods cursed him,"" Old Nan said, ""nor for serving the Andal king his son in a pie. A man has a right to vengeance. But he slew a guest beneath his roof, and that the gods cannot forgive.""

She does say: 

&gt;**HBO**: Are you a book reader? When did you learn about the Red Wedding and Catelyn's fate?

&gt;&gt;**Michelle Fairley**: I read the series so I knew what was coming and I knew how many years I signed on for. 

But she doesn't mention if ""this is it"" or if she actually did sign up for longer.

How do you guys think D&amp;D will handle this? 

* Cut Lady Stoneheart out completely? Would kind of make a mess of a bunch of story lines (Brienne, Pod).

* Just wait until the right time before reintroducing here, following the timeframe of the books.

* Or maybe do ""a Theon"" and show what is happening from a PoV that isn't in the books.",8,4,False,self,,,,,

I have read up through aSoS and while reading, I seem to recall someone mentioning a coat of arms/heraldry that contained a lathe, or else the family name Turner connecting it with a lathe (ie, lathe-turner), or at LEAST mentioning that such-and-such family was famous for producing items from the lathe.

I have little hope of ever finding it again on my own short of reading all of the books again with an eye to that particular phrase.

Does anyone else remember seeing this?

If you have the books on an e-reader, would you be willing do a search for that term?

Thanks in advance for help with this completely unlikely-to-be-successful request.

PS, I already did a search on the westeros.org heraldry section, went into each link and did a ctrl+f for lathe and turner, no luck.

They say they have no interest in his storyline and are ready to fast-forward him from now on.

As I talked with them more, I came to realize that they didn't understand that the killing of the Halfhand was set up. They didn't understand that he was undercover, trying to get info on Mance's plans -- they thought he really was a turncloak, or possibly just lying to save his own skin until he could get away. They didn't know what the group Jon was with was doing or where they were going. They didn't get that the Wildlings are about to launch a massive attack on Castle Black. They basically didn't understand much of anything that was going on in that storyline.

Jon who not only in the show but in the books bears a strong resemblance to Meera Reed.

It is said that Howland was a very good friend of Ned. One that would possibly take in a child not his own.

With a similar build, slight but strong as well and of an age wouldn't that have placed Howland with Ned around the same time he supposedly fathered Jon Snow? 

Doesn't it seem a bit strange that the Reed children were sent to assist Bran in locating the Crow?  Why would Howland send his young children on a perilous journey in a land currently in the midst of a civil war. 

What if he wants to get Meera out of the picture much in the same way that Ned got Jon out of the picture as well, assuming R+L is true in an effort to keep what would be the realms true heir hidden? 

Ned brought a bastard back from the war with him, one that his ever faithful and loyal wife never warmed up to. Now imagine if he would have brought back a daughter as well. That I think would have been much worse and may have ended differently. 

What if Meera is Jons twin, separated at birth and hidden from Robert who would not take the illegitimate children of his one true love and enemy and true heirs to the Iron Throne as people that should be left living. 

And what better place to hide someone than in a place that moves and no one can easily find? Howland was Neds friend, he fostered Jons sister to keep her hidden and keep them being in the same place at the same time.

The two people who know the truth of their parentage are missing or dead.

Jon was the backup plan, Meera is the ace up the sleeve.

Edit: Just read that Howland was the one to find Ned with Lyanna.

Despite this, in both the book and the show he seems to be one of Robb's main men.  I figure that he puts him in charge of shit since he's a seasoned soldier (fought with Ned and Robert on The Trident) and he's the only northman other than Robb who actually uses his brain, but I figured pretty early on that he's up to no good.

For the people who don't remember who said it it was [ADWD](#b ""Ramsay Snow/Bolton"") or ""Boy"" to Theon Greyjoy.

Boy isn't a wizard, he isn't talking about the whole series. He's a sadist with a knife, and he's talking to Theon. By now you all should have worked out that there's probably no happy ending for Theon. Even if Yara breaks him out, Robb's ghost forgives him or he finds a magical amulet, he had his dick cut off, and probably flayed. We've seen his fingers flayed. And considering that the trailer has him apparently in pain, again, it's probably not going to improve.

TL;DR Just because a sadist with a knife tells a tied up man he's in a bad situation, it isn't the end of the world

Perhaps this has already been asked before, but what content from the novel will HBO draw on to produce the fourth season, given that essentially no major plot points occur in A Feast for Crows (none that any TV show-only person would care about anyway)?

I had heard that the current season is actually only half of A Storm of Swords, but I don't see how that's possible seeing as the rest of the major plot twists will surely be in the upcoming episode (although I could see the battle at the Wall being pushed into the next season perhaps).

Given that roughly the first half or so of DwD runs parallel with AFfC, I could maybe see the TV series combining those two into a series? Certainly won't be as action-packed as the previous seasons in any case.",15,0,False,default,,,,,

For those of you just tuning in there are a series of pub quizzes occurring throughout the U.S. where we're attempting to set up meetups. These quizzes are happening in the following places:


* 6:00pm: Rock Bottom Brewery, 550 106th Avenue, Suite 103, Bellevue, WA


* 7:30pm: Charlie Hoopers, 12 West 63rd Street, Kansas City, MO


* 9:00pm: O'Niell's Pub Nob Hill, 4310 Central Ave SE, Albuquerque, NM


* 7:00pm: Gibson Bar, 1109 South Lamar Boulevard, Austin, TX


* 5:00pm: Tommy Doyle's Harvard Square, 96 Winthrop Street, Cambridge, MA


* 7:30pm: West End Pub, 1801 North Lamar St # 100, Dallas, TX


* 2:00pm: The Rackhouse Pub*, 203 S Kalamath St, Denver, CO


* 6:00pm: Lucky Strike, 1201 San Jacinto Street, Houston, TX


* 8:00pm: The Cardinal Restaurant &amp; Bar, 2920 E 38th St, Minneapolis, MN


* 7:30pm: The Capitol Garage, 1500 K Street, Sacramento, CA


* 7:00pm: Lumpy's Downtown, 145 Pier Point Ave, Salt Lake City, UT


* 5:00pm: Complex, 806 E Colorado St, Glendale, CA


For those of you asking about format, this is what I know so far:

&gt;It'll be an eight round quiz. Two will be audio rounds, another will be a visual round. Each round will have a set theme. For plausible deniability's sake I don't know what the round themes are going to be, but there'll be plenty of variety.


For more information and to sign up for the event check out their facebook page [here](https://www.facebook.com/events/131066040418182/?ref=2) and check out this sweet article USA Today wrote about the event [here](http://www.usatoday.com/story/popcandy/2013/05/16/game-of-thrones-pub-quiz/2166015/). 

For my part I will be attending the Bellevue event in which I will be captain the winning team ""Tib's Titans"" though at the time of this posting my team is somewhat.....empty. Teams are capped at 6 persons, so anyone in the area is welcome to sign up here. For those of you not in my area, please feel free to recruit for your own teams here as well.

I'm going to do a recap afterwards as well, so if you plan on going, take pictures!

And remember, in the Game of Pub Quizzes you win or you.......eat....wings with....friends

of a king they had crowned: more a boy than a man,
More a pup than a wolf, with the cold of the realm in his eyes

Hed broken a vow to the lords of the Twins:
Wed a stranger, a beauty, but a promise thered been
So the Lord Frey demanded a bridegroom as compromise

And the timbers groaned
River wind softly moaned,
Oh, the King in the North doesnt know
How a red wedding goes

Well, the feasting was plenty and the singing in tune
And the Stark wolves, they howled neath their northern moon
So loud were their cries that the closing of doors was drowned out

Lady Catelyn alone had the rivers sharp ear
Heard dancing reels turn to the Rains of Castamere
In her skin and bones growled a creature of doubt

And the timbers groaned
River wind softly moaned,
Oh, the King in the North soon will know
How a red wedding goes

There were arrows and daggers, and the touch of them burned;
From players to slayers in an instant were turned
And the foreigner Queen was the first to fall under the knife

With two arrows in him, the King crawled to her side
While his mother, she pleaded for the Lord to subside
But hed taken their word, and to break it meant no right to life

And the timbers groaned
River wind softly moaned,
Oh, the King in the North, now he knows
How a red wedding goes

Lord Bolton approached; with a thrust to Robbs heart
He gave him the Lannister Lions regards
And the kings mother wept, for his last word had called her to him

There was nothing she felt cutting Lady Freys throat
And she felt nothing more when they slashed her own
The North will remember, she thought, and theyll have all your skins

And the timbers groaned
Now the wolves lie below
Oh, the King in the North, if hed known
How a red wedding goes

And the timbers groan
But the North waits; they know
That one day the blood they ared owed
Will run neath their soles""",0,0,False,default,,,,,

Did anyone really begin to watch that scene thinking they were just going to walk out of there all happy holding hands with Walder Frey?

I always thought Robb was a little dumb, he claims he fights for the honor of his family yet thousands of people died and lost their families fighting for him, he then loses half of his army over two dead Lannister children... He claims to have honor yet cannot even keep his word for Walder Frey. 

He could not even get his priorities straight! Falling in love in the middle of a war and betraying a lord who helped you? Talk about burning a bridge...Pun completely intended. 

He was declared King of North, he literally had taken over about a Third of Westeros and apparently that was not enough? I think that's a fair enough trade for Ned Stark's head. And considering the moron/tyrant who took over King's Landing, all they had to do was sit tight and wait for the south to tear itself apart from inside out.

Truth is, the Stark's should have learned that honor only gets you so far in Westeros. Especially after Ned's head got chopped off. But I don't blame Ned, Ned was older, he lived by his code of honor his whole life. But his children and wife should have taken note that it's not just honor, but cunning and patience.

The Starks so far are mostly one dimensional and uninteresting characters who often times act on impulse and don't know when to keep their mouths shut. (Like when Arya tells the hound she's planning on killing him)

And Catelyn killing Walder Frey's wife at the end made me completely lose pity for her. I also could not stand the way she treated Jon Snow.

Then everyone claims Sansa is an idiot but it seems she is doing something right... Sansa knows how to slip through the cracks, she knows how to keep her mouth shut. She can keep her real intentions hidden and maintain her posture. She might sound dumb socially, but she's just young, and clueless.

The Starks, for the most part, just have no depth to them. I have a feeling this will change though... I hope, because it's been nothing but facepalms for the past three seasons.",5,0,False,self,,,,,

I'm sorry if this sounds like a dumb question to many but I've been wondering... 
1. Does Jamie know that Joffrey, Myrcella, Tommen Baratheon are his children? Or is he unaware of this as well? 
2. Vice versa, do the Baratheon siblings know Jamie is their real father?
3. Is twin inbreeding even possible? or could the Baratheon siblings actually be from Robert but just somehow Cersei had blonde dominant genes in the GoT universe?

I saw in a GOT Wiki that ..
""Ser Gerold Dayne attempted to kill Myrcella to force Doran Martell into a war against the Lannisters,"" but why would he want a war between Doran Martell and the Lannisters?

Why does Tyrion kill Lord Tywin?

How did Sandor Clegane die?

Do we know who killed Joffery? I know Ceresi went crazy accusing people. I read somewhere it might have been the Queen of Thorns - did Ceresi do something to her, suspecting her involvement?

Why does Arya kill Dareon who abandoned The Night's Watch?

What is the deal with Theon? I thought he was absolutely dead, and then  [Not sure if this is spoiler for book 5, but just in case..](/s ""someone spilled the beans that he is actually still alive and is going by Reek?

I originally posted this over at /r/asoiaf, but I've decided to post it here as well for a little more feedback

As some of you may know, a few months ago I spoke about doing an essay using GRRM for a Romantic literature course. So, I present to you my final product. I will be updating it eventually to add some things I excluded due to me not wanting to spoil my professor, but even with this exclusion I do believe that it turned out rather well.

Feel free to critique

On one last note, someone suggested that I summarized way too much and should have provided some textual evidence--I am assuming quotes? My original reason for summarizing everything was because I was writing the essay as if my target audience was unfamiliar with the piece, or to provide more context for those unfamiliar with the books, but after giving it some thought I realize that there are other ways of getting my point across, which would simultaneously help my argument

Either it will be insanely drawn out in order for ep 9 to be [warning ASOS](#b ""Tyrion's trial, the red viper and the mountain duel, and tywin shitting a bolt""), since that happens within what, 300 pages of the red wedding? But at the same time, AFFC has literally no events, and ADWD also is pretty much limp when it comes to massive twists or surprises.

So I'm wondering, have we seen the end of the pattern of shocking ep 9 with this season? What do you speculate will be s04e09 and s05e09? Food for thought. ",34,11,False,self,,,,,

##BATTLE OF GULLTOWN

Aegons first major move was against the Vale of Arryn. After being crowned, he sent his fleet (commanded by Daemon Velaryon, a surviving Valyrian noble) to take Gulltown with his sister Visenya and her dragon Vhagar. In the battle, the Arryn fleet was able to defeat the Targaryen fleet, and Daemon Velaryon was killed. Visenya, on her dragon, durned the Arryn fleet in response.

##HARRENHAL BURNS

After losing his initial battle, Aegon looked towards the Ironborn King Harren the Black, who had conquered the Riverlands and made the gigantic behemoth of a castle, Harrenhal, to be his new seat. Harrenhal was a monstrous fortress (I literally cannot stress how amazing it was when first built). It was considered impregnable against siege or storm, an impressive feat for a castle with no natural defenses (cough cough, Eyrie and Moat Cailin).

When King Harren refused to bend the knee, Aegon used his dragon (Balerion the Black Dread) to overcome Harrenhals defenses. The castle wasnt meant to defend from the sky, so Aegon ended up burning Harren and his sons alive in what would later be known as the Kingspyre Tower in Harrenhal. The remaining Ironborn fled to the Iron Islands, though Aegon pursued with the help of the Riverlords who didnt particularly like their Ironborn conquerors.

The Ironborn would eventually swear fealty to Aegon, fearing his dragon. They would elect Lord Vickon Greyjoy of Pyke to lead them, and the Greyjoys swore fealty to Aegon. They were made Lord Paramount of the Iron Islands.

The first Riverlord to abandon the Ironborn and swear fealty to Aegon Targaryen was Edwyn Tully, who was later made the Lord Parramount of the Trident. Since then, the Tullys were the overlords of the Riverlands, making all other Riverlords swear them fealty.

##CREATION OF THE CROWNLANDS

If you look at the map, right above Kings Landing and Dragonstone is a small peninsula known as Crackclaw Point. After the death of Harren the Black, Aegon sent Visenya to demand the submission of the lords of Crackclaw Point. The lords understood that they stood no chance, and so they bent their knees.

To this day, there is no overlord or Lord Paramount of the Crownlands. They have no Starks or Tullys or Greyjoys to serve, they are direct vassals of the Targaryens and would answer directly to the Iron Throne and Kings Landing. This area would also include smaller castles such as Rosby and Duskendale, Masseys Hook (the peninsula south of Dragonstone) and the islands in the Blackwater Bay.

##THE LAST STORM

In the east, Aegons alleged bastard half-brother Orys Baratheon led an army against Storms End with the aid of Rhaenys and her dragon Meraxes. King Argilac the Arrogant (known as the Storm King), would prove that his name was justly given. Rather than stay behind in Storms End (which, as you could assume from the name, would be the ideal place to ride out the storm), Argilac decided to meet the Targ army in the field, confident of his victory.

It was a huge mistake. In single combat, Orys Baratheon slew Argilac. His daughter, Argella Durrendon, declared herself Storm Queen and continued to hold Storms End. However, the garrison of the castle knew that resistance was futile. They took Argella and brought her to Orys naked and in chains, surrendering the castle. Orys clothed her at once (how gallant). Aegon would give Orys the castle and lands, as well as Argella to wed. House Baratheon was formed, and Orys took the sigil and words of the Storm Kings of old. The Stormlands now joined the Crownlands, Riverlands, and Iron Islands in Aegons Kingdom.

##THE FIELD OF FIRE

After separate engagements, Aegon and his sisters met with their dragons and army at Stoney Sept (for those looking at the map, Stoney Sept is near the Blackwater Rush in the Riverlands by the Westerlands.

The union between Lannister and Tyrell with Joffrey and Margaery are not the first times the Westerlands and Reach united against a common enemy. King Lorren Lannister of the Rock and King Mern IX Gardener of the Reach made an alliance, startled by the Targs' rampant success. They assembled their armies, which would be later dubbed by historians as The Host of the Two Kings, and it numbered 55,000. The Targs only had 10,000 men, many of uncertain loyalty and reliability. Oh, and did I mention the Host of Two Kings had 5,000 mounted knights.

Lets just say it wasnt so pretty for the Targs. But they realized this, and so Aegon and his sisters deployed ALL. THREE. DRAGONS. It was the only time all three took the skies at once. Their combined fires scoured the battlefield, immolating more than 4,000 men, including King Mern and his heirs. The Battle would be given the name The Field of Fire.

After being captured, King Loren Lannister bent the knee and was allowed to remain Lord of Casterly Rock. He became the Warden of the West and Lord Paramount of the Westerlands. With Mern Gardener and his heir dead, Aegon accepted the surrender of Harlen Tyrell, Merns steward, and appointed him the Lord Paramount of the Reach. The Tyrells were given Highgarden, and the rest, as they say, was history.

This appointment infuriated House Florent, who had a claim through a distant relation to House Gardener. Aegon ignored their claim. Weve already met two Florents in the show: Sam Tarly is the first son of Randall Tarly and Melessa Florent. Stannis wife Selyse (fetus jars) is also a Florent. The Florents are the most significant house of the Reach to stay with Stannis after Blackwater (though they were initially with Renly). The House didn't even garner enough notoriety to make the HBO series.

##THE KING WHO KNELT

Now Aegon had all but three kingdomsDorne, the Vale of Arryn, and the North. After subduing the Reach and the Rock, he set his sights North.

A host of northmen under the leadership of the King in the North, Torrhen Stark, marched south towards the Riverlands, and Aegon mustered his troops and dragons to meet him on the banks of the Red Fork of the Trident, east of Riverrun. Torrhen intended to engage Aegon in battle, but upon seeing Aegons vast host and dragons, Torrhen realized he couldnt win.

Instead of wasting the lives of his vassals, Torrhen Stark bent the knee in submission. He was named Lord of Winterfell, Warden of the North, and Lord Paramount of the North. Stark would go down in history as the King Who Knelt, the last King in the North until Robb Stark, The Young Wolf rose in rebellion against the Iron Throne nearly 300 years later. In later years, an inn known as the Inn of the Kneeling Man was built on the site of Torrhens surrender.

##THE CUTE CONQUEST OF THE VALE

Recally, if you will, King Ronnel Arryn of the Vale. He was but a boy, very young, and his mother Sharra Arryn ruled as his regent. The penultimate kingdom that Aegon wished to subdue would eventually fall under his rule without bloodshed.

Sharra sent a massive army to the Bloody Gate, which stood to protect the Eyrie and the Vale. She herself returned to the Eyrie with Ronnel for safety. Visenya Targaryen simply rode Vhagar up the side of the mountain. Sharra rushed outside to see the young King Ronnel seated on the dragon begging for a ride. The regent acknowledged Aegons supremacy, and the young king got his ride.

##DORNE'S RESISTANCE

Rhaenys led an invasion of Dorne in an attempt to secure the southernmost lands as well. The army was taken through the Red Mountains, but the Dornish refused to give open battles (learning from the Field of Fire) or hide in their castles (learning from Harrenhal). Instead, the Dornish struck at supply lines and engaged in guerilla warfare. Before they could be attacked by dragons, they would have already melted away.

Rhaenys captured holdfasts to no avail, as their people had already fled, leaving only those who could not fight. Frustrated, Rhaenys flew to Sunspear to demand Princess Mariya Martells surrender. Mariya instead informed her:

&gt;*This is Dorne. You are not wanted here. Return at your peril.*

Rhaenys replied that she would return with *Fire and Blood*, the words of House Targaryen.

Mariya simply replied *Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken*, the words of House Martell.

The Targaryen army withdrew, leaving the country untaken. The Dornish managed to stay independent from the Conquest, something that no other King could do. Aegon chose to withdraw and leave Dorne as an independent nation.

##CROWNED IN THE LIGHT OF THE FAITH

Oldtown is the southwesternmost city in Westeros, home to the Maesters of the Citadel. When news arrived of Aegon and his sisters, the High Septon (of the Faith of the Seven) fasted and prayed for seven days and nights under the dome of the Starry Sept. He then announced that the Faith would not have them oppose the Tags because the Crone had shown him that to do so would mean the destruction of Oldtown.

A pious man, Lord Hightower of Oldtown kept his forces at Oldtown, and when Aegon marched south, he opened his gates to submit to Aegons authority. The High Septon anointed Aegon and acknowledged his placeas King of Westeros, destroying much of the remaining opposition of the Westerosi people.

I've been spinning theories around while watching, and it's occurred to me that something doesn't add up.

As of the opening of season 1, the show states that Robert's Rebellion, and hence the killing of the Mad King and Rhaegar and the driving out of Viserys and Danerys to Essos, was 17 years ago. But, Danerys - especially from what I've heard from book-readers - seems clearly younger than 17. She's certainly younger than Jon Snow, who seems about right for 17, and who was born in the year of Robert's Rebellion. 

Am I wrong about Danerys's age - perhaps all of the years were adjusted for the show? - or was she indeed born after the Rebellion?  Was her mother killed when Aerys was? Was she born late enough that Aerys could not have been her father?

If the answers involve spoilers, I'll take a simple yes or no and then come up with my own tin foil hat theories.

EDIT: Thanks to all! Knowing that the show increased the time since the rebellion too, and that Dany was conceived toward the end of the rebellion really helps!

since orys baratheon was a targ bastard, is baratheon the name of valyrian bastards or did he somehow got/kept his name? afaik (thanks to the ASOIAF wiki) orys only took his sigil and words when he took storms end, so does anybody know where the name comes from? according to the wiki the name of his mother isn't known yet.
i just thought it was ""funny"" that baratheon seems to be a bastards name and joffrey is a lannister bastard carrying a targ bastards name but actually being the first king for about 300 years that does not carry any targ blood in himself.


ps: i failed at the title, sry ...
since i'm not done with ACOC yet it would be awesome if you tag spoilers about this properly as long as they spoil some future events.

Could be in any order but this is just a guess. If Zombie Cat doesn't make an appearance on the last episode she'll also be in the next season.

In the books Jayne Westerling does not travel with Robb to the Twins and is thus not killed (assuming Talisa is dead at the Twins  in the TV show, and it looks fairly conclusive that she is).  In the books she remains at Riverrun, and while her current whereabouts are unknown, it is possible that she is alive, and with Robbs child (The heir to Winterfell).  My question is unless Benioff and Weiss know who the key characters are going to be in the final two books (and beyond) then how can they risk killing off potentially important characters in the TV series?  Imagine if Jayne was with child and he turned into the future Lord of Winterfell/King in the North in, or beyond, book 7, how would they reconcile that?

Thanks.

I don't know exactly how the Skagosi roll, but we do know that the Umbers are very loyal to the Starks &amp; very connected to the politics of the North. In ADWD we see House Umber split between Bolton &amp; Stannis... but I wonder, if the Umbers had Rickon or knew he was alive, would any of them side with Bolton or Stannis? Would any other Northern Houses?

These are the ten reasons to throw your flag in with Stannis Baratheon.

Stannis Baratheon:

10) Is brutally honest.  He doesn't lie, he doesn't exaggerate, he doesn't fib, or even bluff.  It's the cold, honest truth with Stannis, because he believes that there's more value in that than there is in lies - good or bad.  *""Hundreds will die!""* ... [""Thousands...""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af0dSZXGK9Q)  *""Mother said you fought in a battle. Did you win?""* [Nope.](http://youtu.be/ZWHCvOInshk?t=3m50s)  You have to respect that Stannis will always offer you a straight and honest answer and never sugar coat it.

9)  Committed to a war against four opponents; all of whom held more land and had larger armies.  And he did this because - and only because he has the rightful claim to the throne.  Despite anything else about him, that takes a double dose of guts and righteousness, to face overwhelming odds and low opinions simply because what you say is true. 

8) He **is** the rightful king of Westeros, at least as much as Robert was.  He might not be popular, but that doesn't change the fact that he is right.  Joffrey is an inbred Lannister, Renly was the younger brother, Balon is a crazy pirate-viking, and Robb, while honorable, tried to usurp the crown and take half of the Westeros landmass with him. 

7) Melisandre.  Her magic seem evil and treacherous and just sinister at times, and her visions may be grim and terrible, but she sure does put on a show.  Her magic seems to be the one with the most observable power we've seen so far.  I still dislike and distrust her, both as a character and her intentions, but she sure isn't an empty presence. 

6) Davos - the Yin to Melisandre's Yang.  Davos, on the other hand (pun intended), is so loyal, so good, so righteous, and so moral it hurts. He's kind, just, and loyal to a T.  He always finds a smart reason to do the right thing and to be clever about it. And Stannis listens to Davos.  And from time to time the best of Davos seems to rub off on the otherwise cold and indifferent Stannis.

5) He's just.  *""A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad act the good. Each should have its own reward.""*  You might complain that he is more ""lawful neutral"" than ""lawful good,"" but there's no denying that Stannis lives by rules and a code.  And that having a rigid and sometimes terrible code of ethics still beats total lack of any ethics seen by so many other powerful characters.

4)  [Chaos is a ladder.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG3H9E-B464)   Many who try to climb it fail, and never get to try again.  The fall breaks them.  [Stannis climbed to the second highest rung of the ladder.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXI2cgpVOFU)  And Stannis fell.  Plummeted to the void below.  **AND STANNIS.  DID.  NOT. BREAK.**

3) He's tragic.  Many Stannis supporters suspect that he wont win or even survive, but - like Atticus Finch - they come to support him anyhow.  He's not a Luke Skywalker *boy of destiny* like Jon Snow, he doesn't have powerful dragons like Daenarys.  He doesn't have Lannister gold or Tyrell charm.  He's not popular or likable - to the people of Westeros or even much of the TV/book audience.  He's probably as doomed as a character can be, but he fights all the same.

2) He's never been given a chance.  At anything.  He's a loser in everything in his life.  Stannis mentions how Robert always bested him in everything they did together.  He's has a tragically disfigured daughter, the creepiest wife in Westeros, no real friends, and he's never been accepted by anyone for anything.   Robert even gave Storm's End to Renly!

These are the ten reasons to throw your flag in with Stannis Baratheon.

Stannis Baratheon:

**10)** Is brutally honest.  He doesn't lie, he doesn't exaggerate, he doesn't fib, or even bluff.  It's the cold, honest truth with Stannis, because he believes that there's more value in that than there is in lies - good or bad.  *""Hundreds will die!""* ... [""Thousands...""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af0dSZXGK9Q)  *""Mother said you fought in a battle. Did you win?""* [""Nope.""](http://youtu.be/ZWHCvOInshk?t=3m50s)  You have to respect that Stannis will always offer you a straight and honest answer and will never sugar coat it.

**9)** Committed to a war against four opponents; all of whom held more land and had larger armies.  And he did this because - and only because he has the rightful claim to the throne.  Despite anything else about him, that takes a double dose of guts and righteousness, to face overwhelming odds and low opinions simply because what you say is true. 

**8)** He **is** the rightful king of Westeros, at least as much as Robert was.  He might not be popular, but that doesn't change the fact that he is right.  Joffrey is an inbred Lannister, Renly was the younger brother, Balon is a crazy pirate-viking, and Robb, while honorable, tried to usurp the crown and take half of the Westeros landmass with him. 

**7)** Melisandre.  Her magic seem evil and treacherous and just sinister at times, and her visions may be grim and terrible, but she sure does put on a show.  Her magic seems to be the one with the most observable power we've seen so far.  I still dislike and distrust her, both as a character and her intentions, but she sure isn't an empty presence. 

**6)** Davos - the Yin to Melisandre's Yang.  Davos, on the other hand (pun intended), is so loyal, so good, so righteous, and so moral it hurts. He's kind, just, and loyal to a T.  He always finds a smart reason to do the right thing and to be clever about it. And Stannis listens to Davos.  And from time to time the best of Davos seems to rub off on the otherwise cold and indifferent Stannis.

**5)** He's just.  *""A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad act the good. Each should have its own reward.""*  You might complain that he is more ""lawful neutral"" than ""lawful good,"" but there's no denying that Stannis lives by rules and a code.  And that having a rigid and sometimes terrible code of ethics still beats total lack of any ethics seen by so many other powerful characters.

**4)** [Chaos is a ladder.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG3H9E-B464)   Many who try to climb it fail, and never get to try again.  The fall breaks them.  [Stannis climbed to the second highest rung of the ladder.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXI2cgpVOFU)  And Stannis fell.  Plummeted to the void below.  **AND STANNIS.  DID.  NOT. BREAK.**

**3)** He's tragic.  Many Stannis supporters suspect that he wont win or even survive, but - like Atticus Finch - they come to support him anyhow.  He's not a Luke Skywalker *boy of destiny* like Jon Snow, he doesn't have powerful dragons like Daenarys.  He doesn't have Lannister gold or Tyrell charm.  He's not popular or likable - to the people of Westeros or even much of the TV/book audience.  He's probably as doomed as a character can be, but he fights all the same.

**2)** He's never been given a chance.  At anything.  He's a loser in everything in his life.  Stannis mentions how Robert always bested him in everything they did together.  He's has a tragically disfigured daughter, the creepiest wife in Westeros, no real friends, and he's never been accepted by anyone for anything.   Robert even gave Storm's End to Renly!  And Stannis has always taken it in stride and done his duty.  Now that it's his turn to finally be the big fish, no one is even willing to hear him out.

**1)** Finally, Stannis Baratheon was Ned Stark's pick for king. Ned died because of this endorsement, and he rightfully claimed that the crown belonged to Stannis.

After discussing it with a good group of friends, I'm pretty stoked about it. However, my wife and I do not enjoy nudity/sexual content in what we watch. I'm sorry if this bothers you, but we are not trying to push our opinions onto other people. We simply would like to enjoy this show, without viewing incest, and the other sexual content the show has. Watching someone rip another person's tongue out through their throat? Sure. A guy get's a gold crown fresh? AWESOME!

Now, I'm not a pirate. I do not now, nor will I ever mind paying money for content. So, here's my request. Is there a way to watch A Game of Thrones censored? If you don't know, or if it's not possible, I understand. I want to watch this show, but I don't want to watch sex. I'll admit that it's hypocritical for me to claim I'm OK with violence and not sex, but I'm a recovering porn addict who almost lost his marriage because of his addiction. So, I'd rather not go down that road again.

Once again, I'm sorry if any of you are bothered by my request.

I understand she needs boats but couldn't she get it somewhere closer? And why Quarth? I don't remember them saying anything special was there. It's not until season 3 when they finally go the right way. 

Anyway, that probably makes little sense but any help would be great. I'm hoping the book explained it all better

In particular it gets a lot of praise for its supposed ""realism"" even within a world with magic.  GRRM is in particular celebrated for not giving the viewers/readers guarantees that when the loved protagonist is surrounded by enemies, you know hell escape in some improbable fashion  because that is after all, not the way things would really go down in reality.   There are allegedly no characters predestined for a particular plot-advancing destiny. 

I am calling bullshit.  

There is nothing realist about the Game of Thrones plot, it relies on deus ex machina interventions to thwart the cause of the protagonists (even when they are protagonists only relative to worse villains) in a manner that smacks of divine (or demonic) interventions to write the way out of a corner of the heros success into the predetermined result of the heros failure and defeat.  

Deus ex machina, though a concept from ancient Greece in origin, meaning god from the machine in Latin, is a plot device where problems are abruptly resolved with contrived interventions drawing from new events or characters introduced for that purpose rather than coming about as a result of a natural development within the existing plot.  

Aristotle in the *Poetics* wrote:

&gt; In the characters too, exactly as in the structure of the incidents, [the poet] ought always to seek what is either necessary or probable, so that it is either necessary or probable that a person of such-and-such a sort say or do things of the same sort, and it is either necessary or probable that this [incident] happen after that one. It is obvious that the solutions of plots too should come about as a result of the plot itself, and not from a contrivance, as in the Medea and in the passage about sailing home in the Iliad. A contrivance must be used for matters outside the dramaeither previous events which are beyond human knowledge, or later ones that need to be foretold or announced There should be nothing improbable in the incidents; otherwise, it should be outside the tragedy

Rather than getting the protagonists out of trouble, Game of Thrones introduces improbable interventions outside of that contained in the plot to ensure the opposite, often in a maximally emotionally manipulative fashion.  

This is just as much sloppy and immature writing as it is when improbable external intervention swoops down to save the hero  it only seems superficially novel and daring because it is used in the opposite fashion: a diabolus ex machina to kill the hero.  Just as lazy but seems somehow more sophisticated because of its tougher emotional quality!  

To illustrate, here are some examples and explanations for why they fall into this category:

**The Red Wedding:** 

So, the alliance with Frey is about to be the salvation of the North, Ayra is about to be reunited with her family, Edmure is happy to be wedding an unexpectedly hot bride who hes never previously met, Talisa is pregnant with Robbs heir named Ned - clearly this situation is intolerable for a series that thrives on grim unhappiness.  Better make an implausible and thus shocking resolution by having the previously boring model citizen Walden Frey team up with the creepy but previously unrelated Roose Bolton to kill three main characters and their entire army.  

Oh, and since the viewers have up to this point no reason to think that Bolton even knows Frey, throw in a line about how they are actually in-laws, right in the last scene where this would be possible, so this near spontaneous yet 100% effective conspiracy seems at least logistically not impossible.  

This made no sense.  

The Red Wedding might have made a bit of sense if Frey had been the one to attempt to reinitiate relations with Robb, but this wasnt the case: an alliance with Frey was Robbs idea, not Freys.  Are we really to believe that Frey, a very old set in his way guy who has done nothing interesting the whole series, would have just hung out in his dilapidated twin fortress except that he got a raven from Robb and thought opportunity for hugely elaborate murder!

Robb is at war, and he has ample reason not to trust Frey  why doesnt he have spies in Freys house?  Or, really, spy, since apparently all of Freys minions were in on it since they all killed not only the wedding guests but all the Starks (and Tullys?) outside the castle meaning that literally thousands of soldiers would have had to know in advance what was going on.  Its not like spies are a foreign concept to Game of Thrones  Robert Baratheon managed to track one person a world away  while Robb may not have those capabilities youd think that he might have made the slightest effort in that department.  They wouldnt have had a single defector, someone who maybe preferred House Tully as overlords over-creepy Frey?   Everyone has perfect discipline, even in a world where ravens reliably communicate faster than armies march and gold represents a stable currency?  

How about body-guards?  All the other Game of Thrones monarchs (even Dany) have the sense to always have some armored up knights protecting them even when meeting with outsiders in their own camps.  If Frey was offended, wouldnt that just give Robb reason for suspicion?  Weve certainly seen Robb and his buddies go to social events armed before.  

Why are they even getting married at the Freys hall instead of the Tullys hall anyways?  Arent the Tullys the higher ranked and more wealthy and powerful family?  They clearly have a nicer venue to offer, and theyre closer to the front - (its easy to see how it could be recognized as a strategic necessity).  

Why did Robb take Telisa to the wedding when it would only infuriate Frey and make Telisa uncomfortable?

The reason why Robb had no spies or body guards and they met at Freys not Tullys and Telisa was present rather than absent is of course  because otherwise Robb and Telisa wouldnt have died.  But thats not a reason internal to the plot, thats a failure in the plot.

But, you protest, the red wedding really was expected, there was so much foreshadowing!  On the show, there really, really wasnt.  Sure, Karstarks statement that Robb lost the war when he married could be foreshadowing of Robb losing the war, but in context, losing the war as a result of insufficient troops not implausible ambush by Walder Frey.  Likewise Caitlyns warning not to trust Bolton hardly makes a previously undiscussed background conspiracy between Frey and Bolton (which they apparently put together in the short space of time of Robb deciding he needed to go back to Frey) part of the plot  in fact Bolton hasnt actually shown himself within the confines of the show to be conniving at all  and this is from a show that spends huge amounts of time demonstrating the guile and cunning of Petyr, Cersei, Tywin, Margary, Olenna, Varys, Tyron and so on  but someone who hasnt been established this way pulls off the biggest coup (in both senses of the word)?  I dont think so.  

Besides, inserting some foreshadowing so that the move doesnt seem 110% cheap doesnt actually change the fact that it is a contrived and lazy plot device to exploit an audience emotionally, rather than resolve the plot in a way that makes sense.  It just means the author and showrunners thought to go back and write a few lines of script after already making up a ridiculous plot anti-solution.  

If GRRM had wanted to kill off Robb and Caitlyn in a way that made sense, the Stark host should have been defeated on the battlefield at Casterly Rock as already mentioned Lannister reinforcements trapped Robb between the fortress and a larger and better supplied force.  

This would have 1. Made sense 2. Been an illustration that sometimes, often, bold military gambles dont play off 3. Demonstrated Robbs tragic hubris having thought he could not lose a battle given his prior successes, rather than killing him off in a way that didnt enhance his character development at all.  


**The Shadow Baby:**

So, Renly, the easier to identify with, nicer, more ought-to-be-king Baratheon claimant, and Stannis, the at the time gruffer more assholish Baratheon claimant, square off.  The only problem is that Renly has a much bigger army  we cant let the good guy win!  So, out of nowhere Mel with never previously discussed magic kills Renly remotely.  

What?  

In a phrase dictionary a photo of the shadow baby should appear next to the phrase Deus Ex Machina because this is the worst example of it pretty much in literature, film, or television, ever.  

Maybe if magic had previously played a central part of the story this would have made more sense, if for example all the kings were worried about the possibility of shadow assassins, but it didnt, so it doesnt. It came out of nowhere. 

More vexingly, if this was going to be then incorporated into the plot as a thing that Mel can do, really, she should have just killed Robb and Joffery and Balon and Tywin. 

Instead GRRM and the showrunners make this a one off deal: the shadow assassin intervenes into the plot ONE TIME ONLY to spoil Renlys rise, but cant be used in the manner that someone with that power would certainly use it, to resolve the rest of the plot neatly and quickly in Stanniss favor.  

Ridiculous.  

If GRRM wanted to kill off Renly in a plausible fashion, spend an episode or two developing a plot whereby Stannis has a loyal Storms End bannerman in Renlys camp who kills him, possibly in such a way that it looks like Brieanne and/or Caitlyn did it.  


**Battle of Blackwater Bay:**

We spend the whole season 2 hearing about how the Lanisters are losing the war, how Stannis outnumbers them, how Kingslanded is about to be sacked  we see Cersei make preparations for mass murder/suicide of her guests and family to prevent themselves from being taken alive.  

Then Tyrion sinks half Stanniss fleet with wildfire.

Actually you know what, that was totally okay: there were multiple prior discussions of wildfire and it was clear that Tyrion was planning something like that and we knew him to be highly competent and creative.  

But that still wasnt nearly enough to win the battlefor that we had Tywin Lannister making it just in the nick of time literally opening the throne room just as Cersei was about to kill her own kid, riding in on a white horse announcing he had won the battle.  

Wait, if they had this sufficient-to-defeat-Stannis army waiting in the wings, why werent we hearing about it?  Why was the Lanister in Kings Landing narrative Were all gonna die! rather than We are fucked if Tywin doesnt make it here before Stannis!

Really just to artificially heighten tensions and drama.  Still this isnt as bad of a case as the Red Wedding and Shadow Baby events.  


**Robert Baratheons death**

Nothing wrong with a main character dying a pedestrian death in a hunting accident.  It was the *timing* that was a bit too convenient.  Just as Ned finds out about Jofferys lineage Robert dies?  His death is perfectly timed to create the conflict such that had it happened either before or after it wouldnt have had that effect.  Still this is not nearly so bad of a case as the others discussed.  


**Caitlyn freeing Jamie**

Caitlyn freeing Jamie was the catalyst for the eventual loss of the Karstarks.  It also made little sense.  So she didnt want Jamie to die such that shed lose her preferred prisoner to exchange for Sansa  but sending him off to Kings Landing with Brianne wouldnt deliver Sansa back it would just help Jamie, personally.  That makes no sense.  It would make far more sense to order Brianne who is immensely tough to be Jamies personal guard both against his escape and against Karstark retaliation.   Have Robb adopt a policy of delaying all executions until they can take place in front of Joffreys chard remains in Kings Landing.  

...

Note that I am not complaining about Neds execution.  That was an interesting way to demonstrate Joffreys unstable character and lack of impulse control.  Although, still, how is it that Joffrey goes against his family and advisors insistence that he send Ned to take the black and thereby avert civil war, when hes only been king for about a day and his rule is actively being contested but by season 3 he is firmly under Tywins thumb?  Ill still let that slide since maybe Tywin is just such a more powerful personality than the others.  



**In summary:**

I think many of the *characters* (Jamie, Tyron, Arya, Theon, Petyr, Caitlyn, Cersei, Jorah, Margary, Brianne, Ygritte) are fantastic and provide great reasons to watch the show 

But with regard to the much-celebrated plot, I must dissent.  It is riddled with what could be regarded as a Diabolus ex Machina - forces and events outside of the scope of the previously developed plot swoop in to defeat the heros and give the 'bad guys' victory, in a way that makes far less sense than is given to it.  I imagine that in some ways everyone both good and powerful on westeros more or less has to die not because it makes sense for the plot but because eventually regardless of what else happens, 
[by the end of the series](#g ""Dany is going to eventually get back to Westeros and we couldn't have Dany killing Robb and Stannis and Renly because she actually is a predictable predestined for difficult but ultimate success character, the type that GRRM promised we wouldn't see, and she is meant to be kept principled.  Yeah so, at some point Stannis is going to die too, I predict."")

My comments apply to the show and not the books because I dont have time to read the books and I dont really have interest since I prefer to watch the show as a self-contained work and, as mentioned, do not think much of the plot.  

UPDATE/EDIT: 
If you would rather read and ridicule a critique of the show as viewed as a form of media parasitic on the books rather than as a television series meant to stand on its own, I invite you to comment on someone elses essay.  Mine is about the show, as a work in its own right, in a subreddit meant to discuss the show, and thats the way Ive chosen to confine my remarks.  If you think you need special knowledge outside of the show, to engage in discussions about the show as the show, then you should discuss it with people who share your beliefs.  

**UPDATE EDIT:**  **Making a case that ASOIAF has a plot that makes sense does nothing to refute the argument that the television show Game of Thrones has serious plot problems.  And, yes GRRM was and is very closely involved with the show too and references to him are references to his role in that capacity. **",31,0,False,self,,,,,

I'm just going to post here why I think Game of Thrones event's - even the shocking ones - make sense..** 

I'll provide book examples and tag them, but they won't go past the show plotwise.


* The Red Wedding

The Red Wedding was inevitable. Here are a few things that caused it to happen.

1. Edmure. Edmure was tasked to hold Stone Mill by Robb. When Sandor Clegane crossed the River, Robb was hoping to trap him between the river, Edmure's army, and his army. Edmure, being headstrong, chased him back. Tywin then received word of the battle and didn't have to cross back over and was allowed to return to King's Landing in time. This caused Roose Bolton to be wary and ready to switch sides especially because of

2. Theon. Theon Greyjoy had taken the heart of the North and seriously hurt Robb's credibility as King. Roose Bolton sent his Bastard from the Dreadfort to take Winterfell and it was promptly burned to the ground. We can safely assume [ACOK] (#b ""This was an early sign of Bolton switching sides."") 

3. The Red Wedding was **completely** uncalled for. At the beginning of the episode, the guests were given bread and salt. This signifies guest right, and that no harm will come to them. There is only 1 recorded instance in the whole history of Westeros where it has been broken, and it ended badly. Here is the tale of The Rat Cook

&gt;According to legend, the man who would later be known as the Rat Cook was a simple cook at the Nightfort. He became infamous when he served an Andal King a pie that was made of bacon and, unknown to the King, the King's own son. The Cook killed the King's son, a Prince, in revenge for a wrong the King supposedly did to him. The King was unaware of this however as he ate and praised the taste and asked for a second piece. The gods, angry because the cook had slain a guest beneath his roof, cursed the cook and transformed him into a massive rat who was doomed to be unable to eat anything but his own young.

The Gods were ok with him exacting his revenge, but not breaking Guest Right. Guest Right is the most sacred thing in Westeros, and all religions forbid breaking it. What Frey did was unprecedented and Robb couldn't expect it.

Also, in the books, [ASOS] (#b ""Frey made sure all of the troops were extremely drunk and hung up their swords. He also rigged tents to collapse outside and lit them on fire."")

For Foreshadowing, (**This contains a minor spoiler detail from the books, which will be revealed next episode.**) [ASOS] (#b ""In the books, Dany saw a man with a wolfs head on a throne with people slaughtered all around him holding food. This is obviously Robb at the Red Wedding. GRRM had had it planned out since the beginning and hated writing the scene, but knew it had to happen."")


* Roose's betrayal.

Besides my first two points, House Bolton has historically been at odds with House Stark. House Karstark was created because the King in the North's brother put down House Bolton's rebellion and was granted ""Karl's Hold"" (Karhold). Also, Robb placed half of his army with Bolton for good reason. The Bolton's had fought very well in Robert's Rebellion and Ned had placated them a bit. Also, Roose was an excellent commander at the Battle of the Green Fork. In AGOT Robb has to choose a commander for the Battle of the Green Fork. He is trying to choose, and is leaning towards Karstark and Umber. Catelyn tells him he needs pure pragmatism or something along those lines, instead of headstrong men, and he chooses Roose Bolton. 

&gt;Lord Tywin puts his undisciplined men on the left, so to tempt the Northern commander (whom he believes will be the untested Robb Stark) to overcommit should the undisciplined clansmen rout, as he expects. He then intends for Ser Kevan and the center to wheel to the left and take the northerners in the side. However, the commander, Lord Bolton, proves to be cautious and fails to fall for the trap. Once he sees the battle is lost, he retreats.
This stalls the Lannister Army, and allows Robb to take Riverrun.

Again, this showed Roose's competence.

[ASOS] (#b ""After Robb starts marrying Jeyne, losing the north and Karstarks, and generally being a bad king, he starts hedging his bets. He releases Jaime Lannister to Tywin, and kills almost all Stark loyalists at the Battle of Duskendale. He commands Robett Glover to take Duskendale, knowing full well Randyll Tarly, the sea, and Gregor Clegane will entrap the army. This annihilates a **huge** portion of the North's foot, and Robb is furious. Roose blames it on Robett, and Robb believes him."")


* The Shadow Baby

The Shadow Baby was used well. Using the baby on Joffrey wouldn't do anything, Tywin would still rule in actuality and Tommen would become king. Killing Robb with it would incentivize the North even more, and Balon would have his son or daughter succeed him. Renly had no heirs and was holding together the Reach and the Stormlands. Killing him promptly gave Stannis a huge army and Storm's End.


About using it again, [ACOK] (#b ""Stannis considered it, but it nearly killed him. It took an incredible amount of energy from him and Davos described as looking really bad after it. Also, no one else can create them as only King's Blood (or semen) works."")

* The Battle of Blackwater.

I gave the first point about Edmure which allowed Tywin to return, but there are a couple other factors.

[ACOK] (#b ""Ser Imry Florent, commanding the ships, was way too confident. He sent all the ships up without a scot, something Davos advised against. Stannis, anxious and not wanting to upset his biggest bannerman, listened to Florent leading to his ships demise."")

* Robert's Death

[AGOT] (#b ""Cersei killed him, that's why it was so convenient. Robert went hunting a lot, so it was normal timing. She had Lancel Lannister give him excessive amounts of wine, and knowing Robert, she knew he wouldn't resist killing a boar."")

* Catelyn's freeing of Jaime

She was incredibly distraught, and in ASOS we get a POV from her. When she heard the Lannister's still had her daughters, she made an impulse move and released Jaime. She had him guarded by her sworn sword Brienne. No one else though it was a good idea and she was punished for it.

Wich means he will appear in S4 and if we follow the story he has to appear. Now since he is so important to the dornishmen they will probably give him a bit more screentime so showwatchers can start to like and understand dorne. Wich they have done with several imporant characters before like robb.

My question is about his relationship with Daemon sand his squire. Will they remove it, hint at it like in the books or out right show it like they did with renly and loras.  

I personally hope for the last but I fear they might remove it because it would take to much time and that would make me a saaaaaad panda",11,0,False,self,,,,,

What I find so fascinating though is that Stannis and Melisandre will credit this death to their own actions and the Lord of Light.  The Red Wedding was planned by the Lannisters and the Freys but oh so conveniently Stannis and Melisandre can look at it only as further validation of the real power of the Lord of Light.  The way religion is handled in this show is just really intriguing to me.  Also as a show watcher who is just starting the books I can't help but wonder then what fate has in store for Joffrey and Balon.  That's just me speculating though.

The Winds of Winter seems to suggest that someone from The North will conquer Westeros- and who is more representative of The North and winter now than Jon Snow? It also wouldn't seem right if the next king never won a war himself, which Jon Snow is on track to do. A Dream of Spring- which major character is most associated with Dreams? Bran Stark. I feel that GRRM is setting it up so that the Starks will win the Game of Thrones. The Starks start the series with a tragedy and end with a triumph. The TV series starts with the Starks, including Jon Snow and Bran, so it would come full circle to end with them as well.

Like the [Episode Premiere and Book vs. Show Discussions](/r/gameofthrones/wiki/episode_discussion), we have a third ""official thread"" type this season for next-episode predictions.  What do you think is about to happen next?

 * **Comment on only what will happen in the NEXT season.**
 * **This is a TV Spoiler-friendly zone** - Turn away now if you are not currently watching this season! Open discussion of all aired TV events up to and including episode 3.10 is ok without tag covers.
 * **[Book readers use red book spoiler tags for your comments](#b)** - You know what's coming, so predict what will be aired, or comment on what you think will be cut.
 * **[Non-readers use green theory tags](#g)** - Post what you think will happen next based on your show-only info. Warning to book readers: don't pretend to be a non-reader.
 * **Please read the [spoiler guide](/r/gameofthrones/wiki/spoiler_guide) before posting if you need help with tag code or understanding the policy.**",451,60,False,self,,,,,

""Mhysa"" felt like little more than a race to the Daenerys scene at the end. Most scenes feel rushed and underperformed. So much is left out. Jaime and Cersei's reunion felt like a kick in the balls, it was so underwhelming. I don't know what to make about Asha and her new adventure. And despite this, Dany's scene is still the most funded. It was satisfying enough, but not as a finale, and did not make up for everything they took out. For a show that has no qualms about cutting scenes to fit their budget, I felt they could've easily lost the dragons and some slaves and shown the Black Gate and Coldhands (if he's ever coming). It left me seriously disappointed.

But the worst part, though, is we're seeing a perfect Daenerys. A Daenerys that did not come from the mind of GRRM. At least it seems like that now. The promotional stuff all attests to that: it's all advertisements with Dany and her dragons. She feels like the only legitimate hero, and the only one we can feasably root for. If you aren't rooting for her, you're doing something wrong. That's what I'm getting so far from the series.

I hope the show changes direction, fast, and we see more to Dany than this. The show is making me resent her more and more. [ADWD](#b ""Much of Dany's imperfections come from Book 5 as we watch her rule, I know, but in my mind it doesn't excuse the show's constant posturing of Dany as the favorite. It's incredibly excessive."") What do you all think?",27,35,False,self,,,,,

Explained inside.",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1g115l/season_3_e10_spoilers_after_the_red_wedding_last/,[deleted],1370841623,"What I mean is....I was a HUGE Stark lover.  I love each and every one of the Starks.  I think the characters are the easiest to relate to, the easiest to root for, and the most interesting to watch as they try to adjust to their differing environments.  I had the general notion that Robb was going to avenge his beloved father's murder.  Obviously, GRRM made me pay for that last weekend.  I picked up the first book immediately after and started reading, I'm about 75% done, and it has only made me love their characters more.  (No spoilers past this episode please!)  

I know this isn't the type of story where everything has a Hollywood ending, and I get that by now, believe me.  But as I was watching tonight's episode, I couldn't help but feel...distant?..while watching it.  Yes I love Tyrian whole-heartedly, and I love Dany to an extent...I also am really starting to like The Hound and I think Sam is awesome.  But I just feel lost.  I don't know who or what to root/hope for now.  

Dany's story is kinda just same old, same old.  She never really had my full attention anyway, though I do love her to a point.  She's still so far away from everyone and I think that is a big part of it.  
 
Stannis?  Maybe I'd like him more if he wasn't a slave to the Red Woman's will.  

Am I supposed to care for Theon's story?  Or his sister sailing to save him?  Because I just can't.  His sister's a nice girl.  But Theon lost my sympathy long ago.  I just want him dead.  I don't want to watch him tortured anymore for seemingly no reason.  I hate Ramsay as much as anyone.  

I hate the Boltons, I hate the Frays.  I think the Lannisters have the the biggest appeal and awesome characters, but I hate them.  I can't root for them at all.  

I found myself just waiting for Arya and Sansa and Jon and Bran scenes tonight, and those were all quite depressing.  Yeah, Arya had a seemingly awesome scene on the outside, but when I really thought about it, I just felt more sadness about it since she is just this little girl who is killing people without remorse, and I understand why, but it doesn't make it any better.  As far as Sansa goes, I don't know what I can reasonably expect for her story.  No one is coming to rescue her.  As much as I love Tyrion, I don't want her to have to bear his children.  And then I almost had another heart attack when I thought Jon was going to die.  

I guess I was just seeing if anyone else felt like this.  Particularly non-readers.  Like I said, I'm almost done with book 1, and hope to catch up by season 4, so I'm sure the readers have a way better perspective on this than me.  I still LOVE the show and cannot wait for next season, I guess I am just confused as to where it's supposed to go and who I am supposed to root for now.  Sorry if this was rambly.  

TL;DR  Felt empty without my main Stark storyline (avenging Ned/reuniting the family.)  Trying to figure out who to root for now/what to hope for.  Wondering if anyone else felt the same (particularly non-book readers).",0,1,False,default,,,,,

Explanation inside.",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1g13ar/s03e10_after_the_red_wedding_last_week_did_anyone/,GreeneRockets,1370843964,"What I mean is....I was a HUGE Stark lover.  I love each and every one of the Starks.  I think the characters are the easiest to relate to, the easiest to root for, and the most interesting to watch as they try to adjust to their differing environments.  I had the general notion that Robb was going to avenge his beloved father's murder.  Obviously, GRRM made me pay for that last weekend.  I picked up the first book immediately after and started reading, I'm about 75% done, and it has only made me love their characters more.  (No spoilers past this episode please!)  

I know this isn't the type of story where everything has a Hollywood ending, and I get that by now, believe me.  But as I was watching tonight's episode, I couldn't help but feel...distant?..while watching it.  Yes I love Tyrian whole-heartedly, and I love Dany to an extent...I also am really starting to like The Hound and I think Sam is awesome.  But I just feel lost.  I don't know who or what to root/hope for now.  

Dany's story is kinda just same old, same old.  She never really had my full attention anyway, though I do love her to a point.  She's still so far away from everyone and I think that is a big part of it.  
 
Stannis?  Maybe I'd like him more if he wasn't a slave to the Red Woman's will.  

Am I supposed to care for Theon's story?  Or his sister sailing to save him?  Because I just can't.  His sister's a nice girl.  But Theon lost my sympathy long ago.  I just want him dead.  I don't want to watch him tortured anymore for seemingly no reason.  I hate Ramsay as much as anyone.  

I hate the Boltons, I hate the Frays.  I think the Lannisters have the the biggest appeal and awesome characters, but I hate them.  I can't root for them at all.  

I found myself just waiting for Arya and Sansa and Jon and Bran scenes tonight, and those were all quite depressing.  Yeah, Arya had a seemingly awesome scene on the outside, but when I really thought about it, I just felt more sadness about it since she is just this little girl who is killing people without remorse, and I understand why, but it doesn't make it any better.  As far as Sansa goes, I don't know what I can reasonably expect for her story.  No one is coming to rescue her.  As much as I love Tyrion, I don't want her to have to bear his children.  And then I almost had another heart attack when I thought Jon was going to die.  

I guess I was just seeing if anyone else felt like this.  Particularly non-readers.  Like I said, I'm almost done with book 1, and hope to catch up by season 4, so I'm sure the readers have a way better perspective on this than me.  I still LOVE the show and cannot wait for next season, I guess I am just confused as to where it's supposed to go and who I am supposed to root for now.  Sorry if this was rambly.  

TL;DR  Felt empty without my main Stark storyline (avenging Ned/reuniting the family.)  Trying to figure out who to root for now/what to hope for.  Wondering if anyone else felt the same (particularly non-book readers).",25,4,False,self,,,,,

If you haven't quite noticed, the book readers are kind of disappointed by the ending. 

Going to remain particularly vague so as not to spoil anything, but you should remember that this was the first season to split a book in half. Season 1 and 2 represented Book 1 and 2, respectively, so it was clear cut what would happen at the end of each season. This was not the case for Season 3...not even the book readers knew where the producers were going to split the show and at what point it was going to end.

The book readers had plenty of ideas of what *should* have been included or how the Season should've ended. All i would say is that most of us are pretty disappointed with how Season 3 ended.

The GOOD news, loyal TV watchers, is that any of the awesome stuff we were hoping for in Season 3 finale is now going to be pushed back to Season 4. So, know this: Season 4 is going to be a fantastic Season, maybe even the best one so far.

Also...public service announcement: as a reminder, the ASOS book was split into S3 and 4, so you should still avoid any ASOS spoiler tags.",102,686,False,self,,,,,

Ok, we all know what happens to Shae in a Storm of Swords. 

She's caught by Tyrion, naked....in the bed of his father Tywin, this coupled with her earlier betrayal and mockery in court, along with the answers she gave him at bedside enraged him to the point where he strangled her to death.

However,

In the show, she is presented as a more sympathetic character.

You honestly believe that she cares for Tyrion, whereas in the book series, (in hindsight) you could buy that she never really cared for him at all.

This, along with the fact that Lord Tywin is so darn likable in the series causes real problems when it comes time for Tyrion to kill them both.

Tyrion is by far the most liked character in the show, but killing off two  liked characters side by side would cause backlash against him.

I believe the workers on the show realized this, and are going to implement a deviation in the series, as compared to how events take place in the books.

Lord Tywin (Charles Dance) is too likable in the show right now. I believe next season they are going to make a concentrated effort to make him universally hated, and what better way to do that than for,......**HIM** to be the one that kills Shae instead of Tyrion.

The way Shae's character is now, I think she is too sympathetic for the writers to have Tyrion kill. Demonizing her next season would just seem too far out of character for her. I mean she **turned down diamonds**, and refused to leave when given the chance, knowing that her life was in danger; having been warned by Tyrion of his father's threats to kill her in the past.

What I think happens is, they continue to demonize Lord Tywin, eventually he finds out about Shae, has her killed; Tyrion finds out about it when Jamie breaks him out of prison, and he goes off to kill Tywin in revenge.

Anyone else have any thoughts on the matter?

Here's the dialog excerpt from S3E10:

&gt; Stannis: ""When did you learn to read?""

&gt; Davos: ""Matthos taught me before he died so I could be of better service to you.""

As a reminder, here's a dialog excerpt from S2E2, when Matthos tried to convert the skeptic Davos:

&gt; Matthos: ""Let me teach you how to read.""

&gt; Davos: ""Oh, you and your mother...""

&gt; Matthos: ""It won't take long. You already know the letters. The holy books are much more persuasive than I can be.""

&gt; (And later...)

&gt; Davos: ""You want me to have a God? Fine. King Stannis is my God. [...]""

&gt; Matthos: ""Stannis is my King, but he's only a man.""

Of course, only knowing the letters is not enough to read. Here's an excerpt from S3E5, when Stannis' daughter Shireen offered a book to read for Davos:

&gt; Davos: ""Thank you my lady, I'm sure it's a fine book, but it's wasted on me.""

&gt; Shireen: ""Take it! I have more.""

&gt; Davos: ""My lady, I can't read the words.""

&gt; Shireen: ""You can't? ... I'll teach you. I'll come when Bert's on duty and teach you.""

Recall that Stannis is aware of Shireen's friendship with Davos. Here's another excerpt from an earlier part of S3E5:

&gt; Shireen: ""Did the Onion Knight come back with you?""

&gt; Stannis: ""He did. [...]""

&gt; Shireen: ""He hasn't come to visit me. He said he'd bring a present from the capital.""

&gt; Stannis: ""He won't be visiting, child.""

&gt; Shireen: ""Why not? He's my friend. Look."" (goes to rummage something)

&gt; Stannis: (doesn't look surprised; looks dejected, if anything)

&gt; Shireen: (comes back with a ship toy) ""He made this for me. But don't tell mother I have it. It's a secret. Mother doesn't like the Onion Knight.""

&gt; Stannis: ""Ser Davos is [preoccupied for some time]. Best forget him.""

It looks to me that Stannis knew that Shireen had a longstanding friendship with Davos, and that he visits her occasionally, and that they're close enough to keep little secrets from her own mother. It's true that this friendship is officially ""on hold"" at S3E5, but that period has already passed by S3E10.

So given all this, why didn't Davos just say that Shireen taught him how to read? It looks to me that at best, Matthos only taught him the letters, if at all. Worse, on the one occasion that we saw Matthos offering to teach, it was driven by fanatical religious proselytism, rather than to directly serve Stannis.

I don't recall Davos ever being ambiguous, deceptive, or telling a white lie to Stannis. Certainly he's not the ass-kissing kind, not to Stannis. So when asked who taught him how to read, why not just say that it was Shireen?",6,4,False,self,,,,,

The styles I've been thinking of are The Braavosi which seems very elegant but as shown with Syrio despite him being a better swordsman he was unable to match a knight in armour.

The Dothraki which is fast but again ineffective against armour

Then the style used by knights and so on which is appears to be slower slower but seemingly unpenetrable due their armour.
Any discussion on these hypothetical would be really interesting.

Tywin tells Tyrion that the one thing he did for someone else was not murdering him when he was born. Tywin is a cold, calculating, absolute shit to everyone (his own children included) but is still family first. 

Balon, upon receiving a parcel containing a piece of his son, gives no fucks, and even tries to rationalize why Theon isn't worth his time. 

I really liked how they did this, because I think it is developing Tywin a bit more. As with Joffrey/Ramsay it's interesting for the show to present you with an awful person, and then bring in another one to give you another person to provide perspective.

This was, in my opinion, the greatest difference between the television series and the books so far. Tyrion is a fan favourite and the apparent true love of Shae towards Tyrion obviously alters the importance of the impending revelation of Tysha, as well as his reaction upon finding her in Tywin's rooms later in ASOS.

I loved the way the books handled this, the reveal from Jamie of Tysha loving Tyrion was a huge moment imo, and this undermines that. Also, if he is to kill Tywin in the books, does he also do the same to Shae? Surely this impacts his decision to leave; either he wouldn't leave without her, or would continue to love her after leaving.

Unless it's somehow shown she didn't love him (highly unlikely now given the direction), I think she must be killed, after Tyrion is captured or when he kills Tywin. Cersei perhaps?

In my opinion the Daenerys scene was a really powerful scene, as it showed the difference of her to almost any other person in the series (There is a reason why the Davos scene was before hers). She was willing to trust every single one of these people, while you had the Unsullied, Jorah and Barristan standing in the back hands on their swords/spears looking mistrustful. The entire world of ASOIAF seems to consist of people backstabbing each other for personal gain and I thought the Danerys scene provided a strong and positive contrast to that, especially after having the Red Wedding massacre one episode ago.

Keeping that in mind, we have 2-3 years before the next book (Winds of Winter) should be coming out... followed by another 3-4 before A Dream of Spring. Obviously this is all subject to change. 

The show right now, having just finished its third season, will probably spend next season finishing ASOS and then maybe the next two combining AFFC and ADWD. I think that's being extremely optimistic... because nothing really happens in one of those books. So MAYBE three seasons I am guessing? What do you think, Reddit?

I will discuss his backstory, go into depth into his book-to-show differences, and delve a bit into his relationship with ""Reek""...

**Notice of the Spioler Scope:  This post is safe for non readers, the ""ADWD"" spoiler tag is there because a good deal of Ramsay's backstory is revealed in that novel, and I will discuss some of that info.  That being said it is just backstory, and no plot details from ADWD will be discussed outside of a regularly marked tag.   With that out of the way, let us begin.....**

Ramsay Snow, is an interesting character, that so far the show has illustrated very well.  An endlessly sadistic person with a love of torment on a whim, he has garnered the reputation as one of the most brutal characters amongst book readers, and amongst the people of Westeros.  These traits are mostly inherited from his father Roose, who in the books can be as malevolent as his son, but whereas Roose keeps himself restrained and reserved, Ramsay is unfettered and unmindful of his actions.  While his first love is flaying, he also has a love of ""hunting"", rumors of him have reached the ears of nobels through the land, but the truth is much worse.  If Ramsay sees a woman he lusts for he takes her prisoner, sets he loose in the wild and hunts them down, once caught he will rape them, kill them, and flay them.  And if he feels that the women have given him ""good sport"", he'll do it in that order.  He keeps a pack of feral hounds called ""his bitches"" each of which are named after the women he's hunted....  He also hates to be reminded of his birth, and loaths being called ""bastard""...So yeah, Ramsay's a pretty down to earth, likeable guy, don't you think?

Roose Bolton in the last days when Rickard Starks was his liege lord had come across a newly married couple while hunting, a miller and his wife; as from Roose's point of view the couple had married ""without his leave"" he hanged the miller and claimed his ""lords right to the first night"".  The ""lords right"" is an old custom in Westeros where a Lord or a King can claim the bride for night when the smallfolk (or even his bannermen) married.  The practice was banned two and a half centuries ago by King Jaehaerys I after his queen was so offended by the practice, though a few northern lords (such as lord Bolton) still practice the ""first night"" secretly.  Regardless Roose's rape of the the Miller's wife produced a son, who was brought to the Dreadfort a year after his birth, and that would be Ramsay Snow. 

Roose did not want to keep the child, and wished to kill Ramsay, but after seeing his eyes, knew the son was his and spared the child not wishing to become cursed as a kinslayer.  He gave the mother land and money to buy her silence and raise the child, and so word of his rape would not reach the ears of lord Rickard Stark.  It was 12 years later that Ramsay learned of his identity when his mother Returned to the Dreadfort seeking a companion for Ramsay who was growing increasingly violent, Roose sent him a Dreadfort stable-boy known as ""Reek"".  After publicly acknowledging his bastard when he sent Reek to Ramsay, Roose's only son and heir Domeric, while squiring in the Vale, wished to form a relationship with his half-brother and reached out to Ramsay.... He died mysteriously a short time later, leaving Roose no trueborn heir.  It wasn't until 2 years before the start of the main story that Ramsay was brought to the Dreadfort and named as his heir (something very uncommon for a bastard)

In the books we hear of Ramsay in the second book and hear the aforementioned rumors of his misdeeds, but his crimes come to the forefront when he captures, forceably marries, and imprisons The freshly widowed Lady Hornwood and steals her lands and titles.  He in doing so forgets his new ""wife"" locked in a tower where she starves to death, but not after eating her own fingers.  Bran, while in charge of Winterfell, while his brother is fighting a war, sends Winterfell men to deal with the issue.  A short time later the men return after supposedly bringing justice to Ramsay and his men, and return with one captive, a man named Reek, who as I mentioned above had spent the last several years as Ramsay's closest friend and companion.  

On Reek for a second, as I said he was a stable boy at the Dreadfort before he was taken to Ramsay as a companion.  His true name is unknown, but his name ""Reek"" came from the issue that he constantly smelled terrible.  No matter how many baths he had, or how perfumed he was, Reek reeked.  He however did find very close companionship in Ramsay in those several years.  

When Theon Greyjoy stormed and took Winterfell, he freed some of the captives in the Winterfell dungeons, Reek among them, who formed a bond and friendship with Theon while he struggled to hold Winterfell, acting as somewhat of an advisor, and it was under Reek's suggestion that Theon murdered smallfolk children to pose as a dead Bran and Rickon after their escape.  

When it became apparent that Theon would lose Winterfell, Reek offered Theon aid in the form of reinforcements, if Theon would let him do so.  Seeing no other alternative Theon sent Reek for aid.  As the Ironborn prepared for battle by Stark men set to retake Winterfell led by Rodrick Cassel (who wasn't beheaded by Theon in the books, that was Mikken, the Blacksmith), aid did come for Theon.  The Stark men were tricked, when perceived as allies men from the Dreadfort arrived and murdered Rodrick Cassel and his men, led by the man Theon knew as Reek (and had killed ser Rodrick himself), the Ironborn were apparently saved.  Reek went to Theon and revealed himself as Ramsay Snow.  The real Reek prior to being captured and taken by the Northmen earlier had donned Ramsay's clothes, and Ramsay's Reek's; the real Reek was killed when justice for Lady Hornwood was served, and Ramsay took on Reek's guise when brought to Winterfell.  After the Reek reveal, Ramsay and the Dreadfort men turned on the Ironborn as well, captured Theon, and put Winterfell to the touch, and blamed it on the Ironborn.  

Now, to what we've seen with Theon, and Ramsay this season... The torture.  Theon is not a POV in ASOS, and we do not read what he's going through in the books, but from a minor scene with Robb, Catelyn, and Roose just prior to the Red Weeding, Bolton presents King Robb with a bit of Theon's finger skin provided to them from Ramsay, to which Robb responds that he only wants Theon's head, not his skin..  So the readers knew Theon was alive at this point and knew he was being tortured, we as readers did not get this firsthand though.  The show however shows us directly what was happening..... Poor Theon.  And now with season 3 finished and with Theon taking on the identity of Reek (or the new Reek, by book canon), what will happen with him?  But that goes into spoiler territory, and I will leave you with that..  I hope you've enjoyed this analysis and discussion on one of the truly most vile characters in ASOIAF, and I cannot wait for viewers to get to see more of him, but we have 9 months to wait for that.... Here's to a good off season.

To those who have read this and all my other ""adding context"" posts this season, thank you very much.  As I said at the beginning I plan to do a few of these during the long off season, but they will be irregularly posted, and whenever I can think of a good topic without getting ahead of the show.... So stay tuned, and until next time, see you next season.... 


EDIT TO ADD:  some have been requesting I post a list off all the adding context entries I have done, and I'm happy to oblige

The two that come to mind are Michael McElhatton (Roose Bolton) and Michelle Fairley (Catelyn Stark), and I think it's because their voices alone provide a really significant glimpse into their characters. Roose's constantly baritone and slightly coy manner of speaking hints that there's something questionable about him, while Catelyn's voice has that familiar maternal warmth and wisdom that gives way to a very affable personality (for the most part).

It's definitely not limited to these two, either. Just felt it was worth mentioning though. I love this show and I hate that I have to wait another thousand years for another season :'(",2,2,False,self,,,,,

But the end scene this season didn't really work on any level. It didn't leave any kind of cliffhanger (which obviously is not always needed of course), it didn't really bring any storyline to closure and on top of this, it felt really disconnected from the rest of the episode storywise and thematically.

The use of the Braavosi coin and Arya attacking the man's neck were details quite deliberately similar to her POV kill during her escape from Harrenhal in book 2 (pages 901-902 if you are interested in rereading). This scene got me reflecting on some of the book 2 continuations found throughout season 3. While each season is strongly associated with the details of a specific book number (e.g., season 1= book 1) the depth of this show does offer the treat of giving, lets say, a season 2 plot detail at the end of season 3. 
Other examples of this that come to mind are for instance Orell's death in episode 9. In book detail and time, this event should have occurred North of the wall and back in book 2, yet the show renders it in such a way that when Orell finally wargs into the eagle by the Queenscrown, the show barely skips a beat in book continuation. Has anyone else picked up on these mixed chronology or deferred book details throughout season 3? If you come up with any, additionally, do you think mixing the time frames of the book in show time still does the book scenes justice?

I, as probably many other after this seasons last episode want to start reading the books, however when I'm looking it up online, I can find two different sets, first one is with 5 books, these: http://s.cdon.com/media-dynamic/images/product/book/book/image0/a_game_of_thrones_5_books_box_set-18663733-frntl.jpg

I can see that the second set has 2 of the books from the first link in 2 parts, why is this? I've been trying to google it, it's more than double the cost for the 7 set book and I can't find any info about the 2 books that have 2 parts in wikipedia so I just want to know if I will waste money in buying the 7 book set instead of the 5 book set?

Seriously... I'm at a complete loss.  Either Shae is really good at pretending to love Tyrion, or they're taking a different direction with her (which I hope they're not, because Tyrion killing Shae is super important for his character).  

In the book, Shae didn't love him.  She was just sticking around because of all the perks.  It would have made sense for book Shae to take the diamonds offered to her by Varys.  But in the show she declined.  

The only thing I can think of is that she's *already* betraying Tyrion and is spying on him for Cersei or Tywin, and they're just playing dumb so that she can keep spying.  

Otherwise, it just wouldn't make sense for her to testify against him and then sleep with Daddy Lannister.  If she truly loved him as much as the show makes it seem, that would be completely unexplainable.

Don't read unless you have seen S03E09 for yourself.

**Like:**

* *Music*

The way the soundtrack progresses from light and pleasant melodies to low and sonorous ones. The tonal shifts that introduce the ambush are subtle and suitably ominous, especially the plaintive cello music the orchestra plays after a Frey soldier shuts the main door to the hall. Also, the ambient music heightens in pitch and volume as Catelyn discovers the chain mail Bolton is wearing underneath his doublet, signifying his betrayal.

* *Lighting and Set design*

The arrangement of tables and candles to create an atmosphere of foreboding. During the scenes of revelry the hall is lit radiantly, while before the ambush takes place torches are removed from the hall enveloping it with shadow. Similarly, the wedding guests are seated with their backs against the main door to restrict their awareness of events and make them more vulnerable. Lord Frey is portrayed as being in control of events, as his orchestra plays in a gallery above him. In addition, after Lord Frey gives the command, he takes on more of a spectator role, watching the slaughter take place whilst drinking wine on the dais.

* *Acting*

Michelle Fairley conveys the anguish and torment of a mother witnessing the murder of her son very convincingly. She expresses exasperation, desperation and finally resignation in such a way that her death becomes all the more powerful. Meanwhile, David Bradley portrays a character so lecherous and selfish that his appearance immediately provokes a strong reaction in the viewer.

**Dislike:**

* *Violence*

The killings seemed a bit excessive and gratuitous at times. The sound effects and blood spurts sometimes felt too accentuated and verging on cartoonish. The killing of Talisa, in particular, seemed a bit over-the-top and the show's use of violence akin to a B-movie horror film - other examples include Jory Cassel getting a dagger in his eye in Season 1 and the soldiers having their heads ripped off by rocks during the battle of Blackwater Bay in Season 2. I feel that sometimes the use of excessive violence detracts from the credibility of the conflicts by relying too much on shock factor. Compare the scene at the end of this episode to the beheading of Ned Stark, which did not explicitly show his killing and instead used surreally poetic shots to convey the chaos and tragedy of the event.

* *Melodrama*

When Talisa talks to Robb about calling their child Eddard if it turns out to be a boy and then being brutally murdered through repeated stabbings to the stomach. These scenes seemed like an obvious ploy to heighten the tragedy of the murder and, consequently, rendered the affair a bit too staged and exaggerated. 

* *Dj Vu*

We have already experienced the injustice of Ned's execution as well as the various deaths of innocents in King's Landing. With the killings of three principal members of the Stark family at the hands of devilish characters the plot is beginning to feel too much founded upon a comic book sense of villainy.

Also, I think they should have sped events in King's Landing up to make Joffrey's wedding in episode 10 with the RW. So they would have both weddings in that episode and they could switch back and forth between the two. Then they could have Joffrey's death to make everyone happy and then immediately switch to the RW's bloodbath to tear everyone down. 

And they should end with the Hound coming at Arya with the axe as she's running like in the books and then right before the axe hits, it should go black and that would end the season. Because then no one (non bookreader) would be 100% sure if she survived like how in the book he ended it at that in that chapter so we had to keep reading to know.

Since there are many many storylines developing right now, this one decided to share some thoughts as to how the showrunners will/should/may present some of them.
Right now this one only has one storyline developed for the series, but hopes to have others as well.
This one believes that the story of Oberyn Martell should be one of the two or three stories on which there is most focus, or in other words, the story about how Oberyn is awesome and how he ultimately gets killed(in true GRRM style).

Think about it. Right now, the viewers are pissed at the Lannisters for killing the Starks and they want vengeance. So from the beginning of the season we introduce the legend of the Red Viper of Dorne and how he's such a badass and whatnot, but they should also emphasize that he absolutely HATES the Lannisters (thusly getting the support of fans). Oberyn arrives in episode 2 and immediately bonds with Tyrion (who at this point is the only Lannister the fans like since he keeps telling the other Lannisters that they're assholes). And they present Oberyn as a man who is after justice (much like Ned was) since he wants to avenge the death of his sister, but, unlike the all-noble honor-to-the-point-of-stupidity Starks he doesn't mind using some shady methods of achieving his goals (e.g. poisoning someone).

Then, all of a sudden, Joffrey dies and everyone will, after they have high-fived each other, begin to suspect that maybe Oberyn did the deed (he didn't, but that's not important right now). Now the fans will REALLY start to love Oberyn - the Lannister killing, womanizing hedonist with the wits of Tyrion and a sense of justice of Ned Stark. But then, Tyrion is blamed for it and he is put on trial. Oberyn acts amiably towards Tyrion throughout the trial and then announces that he will be his champion (The fans go wild). Then, in episode 9 we see have the awesome build-up towards the fight between Oberyn and Gregor (when someone asks Oberyn: ""you mean to fight that man?"" and Oberyn says: ""No, I mean to kill that man."" and Oberyn's there being all badass and chanting ""Elia of Dorne, you raped her, you killed her, you murdered her children!"" over and over again until you have the viewers chanting with him. He then defeats Gregor and then, obviously, suddenly dies. Fans are in shock. Their new favorite character is dead (again) and Tyrion (their long time favorite character) is going to die. Fans explode in rage. Twitter becomes censored due to the swearing and GRRM enters witness protection. Then in episode 10, you have the nice ""clean up"" and catharsis when Tyrion escapes (Jaime gets sympathy points) and kills Tywin Lannister). And then the heads of HBO hear ""ka-ching""!

That's it for now. Please comment your opinions and bear in mind that this is a new user to reddit and may not understand everything right now. Hopefully this one think through other storylines for the 4th season as well.",5,0,False,self,,,,,

I moderate a show watcher only subreddit that is /r/hbogameofthrones, a place where show watchers don't need to worry about being corrected on their speculation and book information isn't allowed. Not everyone agrees with that, and that is fine, that is what this subreddit is for! 

So I have seen half a hundred comments across the GRRM Network subreddits saying that people are going to pick up the books at the end of the season, they ordered the books after Rains of Castamere etc. Per request of some of the at /r/HBOGameofThrones I made a private subreddit for people to read-a-long to the show with.

We are starting with the Prologue of Game of Thrones this week, and then getting the pacing from the average read speed of that to plan the rest of the reading schedule. If you read fast, you just won't be able to comment on things in the future, and all threads will be marked with a scope, so if you also read slower than the average, you don't need to super rush since we will keep the titles clean of spoilers as well.

The goal is to be caught up to the show in time for Season 4.

We will not ever read ahead of where the show is and it will provide a safe place to talk and discuss it, similar to this /r/hbogameofthrones and this subreddit, except for one large difference. It is a private subreddit, so there is zero risk of spoilers, and your name won't be out there for people to PM.

**This subreddit is open to any show watchers who have not read past where the current season is. Message here or PM me for access. Alternatively you could send in a modmail to the /r/hbogotreadalong by going into private messages and typing /r/hbogotreadalong in the ""to"" section.**

To those that are wondering, yes I have read the books to the point where I can keep the show watchers safe from reaching into spoiler parts once we catch up to the show. I recently had to buy a new set of paperbacks because mine were kind of in pieces. 

Thank you to Kriptik for pointing out that I wasn't very clear. The subreddit that is for the read-a-long is /r/hbogotreadalong. Don't mention the books in /r/HBOGameofThrones .

EDIT: I haven't had power in 2 days, if I didn't add in your request today during my brief internet time, please message the mods at /r/hbogotreadalong to add you into the subreddit.",35,75,False,default,,,,,

I enjoyed it, but thought it was a bit of a snoozer. In my opinion they should have ended the season on the Red Wedding. A lot of last night could have waited until next season. The scene with Roose Bolton and Walder Frey. The scene with Arya and the Hound. 

They could have shown scenes that are unconnected to the Red Wedding, like Sam and then John returning to Castle Black, Davos telling Stannis about the plight of the Nights Watch and the decision to go North, the scene with Ramsay and Theon, the scene with Yara and Balon Greyjoy, the scene with Dany receiving the former slaves of Yunkai.

Ending the season with the Red Wedding would have given it a lot more drama, and left non-readers positively freaking out over what a crazy season ending cliffhanger that would have been. I predicted they would end this season with that cliffhanger, and the more I think about it the more I'm disappointed that they didn't.

Pretty much everything we've seen him do is self-involved and callous.

* He locked his daughter in a dungeon for being ugly.
* He locked his right-hand man in a dungeon for telling him not to kill innocent people.
* He wanted to kill innocent people. (Or, he did kill people? I'm not entirely sure what was going on with the burning towards the start of the season.)

I guess he also performed some redeeming acts?

* Uh... I guess he freed his Hand? And then sentenced him death right after (for saving the life of an innocent man.)

So what's with all this ""Stannis the Mannis"" business? Are these the acts of a mannis? He hasn't even had a victory, much less one over a negative force in the story.

Jon Snows long unkempt hair and beard worked well for when he was out beyond the wall with the wildings, but now that Jon is back at Castle Black does anyone else think that for season 4 they should change up his appearance? Maybe cut his hair and shave his beard. Give him a new look. Start fresh? 


I think it would be neat if they changed up his appearance a little. Give him a new look.

Anyone who was shocked or sad basically get told that they should have seen it coming from way off, and that he chose honor over logic and was losing/going to lose the war either way.  Other viewers/readers still support it for the unpredictability of the series.  I would like to point out, however, that many other characters/families make just as bad decisions/mistakes, and never pay for them, while the Starks are dropping like ships in the Blackwater.  I would like to rebut this argument for a few reasons:

* **There is no evidence that the Freys were not going to betray Robb from the get go.**

They Freys were not quick to jump on the King in the North Bandwagon, it is explicitly said that ""If you go up there alone he will sell you to the Lannisters as he likes"", and he does not welcome Cat and specifically shows his lack of regard for his oath to her (""I said some words"").  Who is not to say that his intention the entire time was to hold a Red Wedding, and murder all of Robb's bannermen/army while holding Robb prisoner in the same way Edmure is now, only to become the effective Lord of Winterfell by getting his daughter knocked up by prisoner Robb.  The Edmure-Frey girl match was just another opportunity to pull the same trick.  A hint to this would have been how quickly Walder Frey wanted the wedding.  Why is the timing important?  If Robb married Talisa, they could have promised Bran or Rickon to marriage instead, and if Frey's intention was good it would have been exactly the same.

* **People who are saying he should have listened to Roose Bolton fail to notice that he did.**

Roose gave advise twice in the show.  One time, he recommended flaying enemy officers.  This was not an option because it was outlawed in the North.  Discipline is important in an army.  If the King/Commander exempts himself from the law, so will they soldiers, and they will lose respect for him.  One of the reasons Robb was such a great commander was his ability to inspire his troops.  The second time, Roose Bolton recommended allowing his bastard to retake Winterfell instead of Robb marching North.  This turned out disastrous for Robb.  Outside of this, Robb was winning every battle.

* **Killing Rickard Karstark was not a mistake.**  Sure it cost him a lot of troops, but it was the only option.  Karstark openly disobeyed an order from a King and Commander, and unless he went punished, so would every other General.  Also, if he had not, if the Lannisters caught wind, they certainly could be lead to believe the killing of their cousins was intentional, and would bring harm to Sansa in retribution.  Killing Jamie would have meant Sansa would die.  Karstark didn't really have ground to stand on... one son died in battle and one son died being a jailer who was terrible at his duty and let the kingslayer escape.

* **He was winning every battle but losing the war.**  He was only losing the war because of treachery.  If Theon didn't betray, Winterfell wouldn't have been burned, Bran and Rickon would be alive and safe.  If Cat didn't betray, they would still have Jamie, and the Boltons would never get him.  If Rickard Karstark didn't betray, they wouldn't need the Freys.  If the Boltons didn't betray, they would have survived the Red Wedding.  Robb was really making all the right moves, but his people weren't.

To add to my argument, here are a list of people that messed up just as bad or worse than Robb who are alive:
* Joffrey- cuts off Ned Stark's head/Yells ""Kill them all!!"" In a mob of angry peasants

* Cersei- cheats on the King with her brother, has multiple incest kids, kills the hand of the king, tries to kill Bran, maybe tries to kill Tyrion, and threatens everyone including the Tyrells, Littlefinger, Starks, etc

* Tyrion -threatens the king multiple times in front of people of importance, nobles, etc/ directly disobeys daddy lannister for love

* Jamie -sleeps with the King's wife, kills a hand of the king, fights in the street with another, kills a bunch of the hand's men, gets captured in battle, talks shit to his captors repeatedly, gets Breanne and himself captured by the Boltons, tries to kill Bran, puts the kingdom in danger for love

* Stannis- doesn't listen to Davos or Mel at inopportune times, burns his men alive, kills his brother, etc

* Theon- betrays Robb, makes advances on sister, doesn't listen to Daddy Greyjoy or his sister and attacks Winterfell anyway, doesn't listen to Maester Luwin and go for the wall

* Jon Snow- Doesn't kill Ygritte, gets lost, doesn't listen to Lord Commander at Craster's house, gets on Orell's bad side, etc

* Samwell Tarly- basically same as Robb, neglects duty for love, but somehow he is a hero for this

* Dany -Stops the Dothraki from raping, trusts the witch, gets Drogo killed, runs by herself into the house of the undying, attacks Yunkai for no apparent reason, goes back on a deal for soldiers by just outright killing the guy selling her the soldiers, trusts a guy who sneaks into her tent and pledges his allegiance to her by delivering her the 2 heads of former bosses and basically tells her he does whatever he wants to, walks into a crowd of people she just met with no protection and known assassins (sorrowful men/warlocks), too many to name....   I could do this all day.

As far as unpredictability, it's only unpredictable for the Starks not counting Arya.  Lannisters are alive and well (although I suspect one of them at least has to go some time soon), and so is everyone else.  Dany has the biggest plot shield in the world, and is not very unpredictable.  I don't know how I am supposed to be worried for her, when I know she basically can't be touched.

**TL;DR**  cut Robb Stark some slack.

I would love to have a discussion about where I may be wrong or on to something, but I still think it is way too easy to jump on the Robb hating bandwagon.  Thanks for reading!",104,152,False,self,,,,,

Everything is pretty subjective, I just wanted to share my thoughts on some of these with you.

House Lannister - ""Hear me roar"": We have heard the Lannister lions roaring quite often, at their harshest possibly during the Red Wedding

House Stark - ""Winter is coming"": If we see winter as a metaphor for decay and destruction this is definitely true given the events in the show and the books

House Greyjoy - ""We do not sow"": Theon agrees...

House Baratheon - ""Ours is the fury"": It applies to Robert Baratheon in general, I think, being impulsive and all, and it also applies to Stannis, but in a different way, since he is furious that no one will accept his rightful claim to the Iron Throne.

House Targaryen - ""Fire and Blood"": One of the most prominent examples: Aerys II Targaryen, cooking people in their own armor and finally setting King's Landing to the torch

House Arryn - ""As high as honor"": Jon Arryn knew about the little secret between Cersei and Jaime and wanted to reveal it; we all know he didn't succeed in his honorable quest

House Bolton - ""Our blades are sharp"": Ask Robb about it - or Theon

House Frey - ""We take our tools"": Walder Frey quite outdid himself with taking the toll for Robb's refusing his daughter

House Baelish - ""Knowledge is power"": Littlefinger is one of the most mysterious characters in all of the series and he always seems to know things unrevealed to others so this definitely applies to him

House Tyrell - ""Growing strong"": One of the examples this applies to is Margaery in my opinion since she definitely takes a stand against Cersei and displays how much ambition she really has

House Mormont - ""Here we stand"": Jeor Mormont as Lord Commander of the Night's Watch took his stand against the evils north of the Wall; Jorah stood beside Daenerys with all his heart but played a double-game: his stand was somewhat damaged thereafter

House Tully - ""Family, Duty, Honor"": #1 Catelyn, #2 Edmure, #3 Brynden

House Clegane - ""A Hound Will Never Lie To You"": This fits Sandor Clegane quite well since he is always pretty honest about what he thinks and does; no matter the harshness; a little reminder: ""Anyone dies with a clean sword, I rape his fucking corpse!""

House Seaworth - ""Service and Truth"": Davos is a prime example of a loyal follower, no matter what it costs him; he put a death warrant on his own head when he set Gendry free but he thought it to be the right thing

House Martell - ""Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken"": The Dornishmen always dwelled quite isolated from the other Houses of Westeros, so their ""Unbowed"" and ""Unbent""-part applies easily; what applies to a lesser extent is that ""Unbroken""-part to Oberyn's head...

House Manderly - ""A Promise Was Made"": Just one phrase: ""The North Remembers"" (which I would like to have as their House's words)

House Dondarrion - ""It shall be done"": ""Over and over again"", said the Lord of Light...

House Selmy - ""Valiant and Honorable"": A picture of Ser Barristan 'the Bold' Selmy is displayed next to this entry in the ""Great Contemporary Westeros Encyclopedia""

House Tarly - ""The First in Battle"": Sam the Slayer showed it; first to kill a White Walker in ages! Take this, Winter!

This should be enough for now. There are so many more Houses and maybe I'll drop some lines on some of them in the future.

Since the last post got deleted due to confusing spoiler scope (information about Talisa's book counterpart that aren't a spoiler for non-readers, but technically could be labeled as AFFC spoilers) and it's been 9 hours since I asked for reapproval, I'm posting this again without any controversial scopes.

If you're new and want to catch up, take a quick look at my [previous followups](http://www.reddit.com/user/lukeatlook/submitted/) (link leads to my reddit submissions, 90% of them are the followups anyway).

**TL;DR: ""It Made Sense In The Books"".**

-----

Keep in mind that the things I write about might get introduced later on in the show when it's needed. A fresh example would be the story of the Rat Cook that got mentioned by one of my fellow readers a week ago. I don't really think it counts as a spoiler, but keep in mind said situation might reoccur.

We're back to location/storyline spreadout. ~~Warning: I haven't read *A Storm of Swords* in English, so the book quotes may be way off.~~ (Nevermind, I dropped the book quotes, which I can't precisely paraphrase, and I used Tywin's quotes instead, since they're awesome and surprisingly relevant)

**The Roose Is Loose**

&gt; ""Explain to me why is it more noble to kill ten thousand men in a battle than a dozen at dinner"" - Tywin Lannister, disregarding the massacre of drunken Stark forces

* So, there has been a huge conspiracy theory among the readers that Talisa is a Lannister spy. [No, really.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsTVnZm9hFg) What's particularly funny is that the theory could still be true - fortunately we got an official confirmation that her latest letter was indeed addressed to her mother.

* Last season there's been some rants about Daenerys's visions in House of Undying. The book visions were numerous and thrilling. What the show couldn't recreate, though, is the unawareness of what the visions mean - book describes the vision as what Dany sees and understands (mostly she does not), but if same scene happened in the show, people who've seen the other characters would immediately recignize them.  
One of the visions featured a wolf-headed man sitting by the table of corpses with a piece of meat in his hand as his scepter.  
I waited a year to post that.

* The Late Walder Frey - reminder: in Robert's Rebellion Starks fought alongside with Arryns and Tullys. Freys were supposed to fight for Hoster Tully just as Stark bannermen fought for Ned. Lord Walder waited until the battle of Trident was practically over. The difference between Tywin and Walder is that Walder got called by his liege lord and didn't come while Tywin's liege lord was the king himself.

* Jon Arryn... you remember the guy whose death was supposed to mean something at the very very beginning? Yeah that guy. He was almost as obscenely old for Lysa as Walder Frey for his latest unlucky wife, but Lysa (books hint this, it's easy to miss on the first read) wasn't a maiden so her hand in marriage wasn't worth much.

* You've noticed how they used salt to clean the floors, same salt that was meant to be the symbol of their hospitality?

* And the Father of the Year Award goes to... Roose Bolton! As you see the intrigue has been planned for a very long time. Now you know what exactly happened in the finale of Season 2. If you wish to learn more about the Bastard of Bolton, /u/GRVrush2112 made a [nice essay](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1g1mve/s3e10adwd_the_bastard_of_bolton_context_for/).

* Arya's theme is back! You might remember that music from her dance lessons with Syrio Forrel and meetings with Jaqen H'gar. This is a great example of how the show delays character development for the right moment - in book, she uses the coin drop trick to get rid of the remaining guard at Harrenhal, so quite a bit earlier. Putting her first blood right after Red Wedding came out great, to be honest.

**A Lion Still Has Claws**

&gt; ""Some wars are won with swords, others with quills and ravens"" - Tywin Lannister, enjoying his pen-and-paper turn-based strategy

* I've already written a few times about how Sansa percieves Tyrion, so go back and read if you don't remember: *Tyrion is supposed to be hideously ugly*.

* Book Joffrey isn't 16 yet, so it's absolutely legal for Tywin to boss him around. Once he comes of age, though, gods help the council. Waiting for Joffrey to become an adult is also why his wedding is so much postponed (especially compared to instantly prepared Tyrion's).

* ""Killed a few puppies"": this is actually really relevant. [Warning: This part of backstory comes from a future part of book but a) it's backstory and b) it's very very relevant.] When Joffrey was a little boy, he had been told that a cat is pregnant. Curious, he took a knife and slit the cat's belly. Then, he brought the cat fetuses to show his father, but unsurprisingly Robert beat the living crap out of his son. Cersei was mortified and threatened Robert that she'll kill him in his sleep if he lays his hand on her son again - and that's how Robert lost any influence on his heir.

* Tywin didn't ""hide"", he was waiting to decide which side to pick. He gladly took revenge on Aerys for years of vitriol between them as he served as his Hand, but until the battle of Trident was won, he didn't want to take the risk. Besides, Tywin's hestitation allowed him to deceive Aerys into believing he's coming to King's Landing to help and that got him the gates opened.  
He sacked the city. Whatever you thought Stannis's forces would do to the citizens in the capital in the episode ""Blackwater"", the Lannisters already did that and more. Oh, and the head rapist-murderer Gregor Clegane still walks free.

* Cersei-Jaime reunion happened a significant bit later in the book and there are some circumstances that make earlier meeting interesting (those bloody road trips are either instant or neverending), so don't judge the scene by not showing any real reaction or dialogue, S4 will deliver.

**Toll Booth**

&gt; ""Let them remember what happens when they march on the South"" - Tywin Lannister, clearly not meaning the White Walkers, who don't give a flying fuck about the Guest Right

* So, I was wrong the last week. I extrapolated kingslaying and kinslaying as the capital offence from European history, but it seems that in Westeros violating the Guest Right used to be unthinkable of, while kings and family members seemed to die a lot.

* The tunnel below the Wall isn't just a regular tunnel... in the books. There is a magical Black Gate made of weirwood that opens only to a sworn brother of the Night's Watch (as it happens, Sam took the oath before a weirwood tree along with Jon). Seems like a talking gate (""Who are you"" [Sam says oath, ""I am the sword in the dark""] ""Then pass."") was too much. Glad they recurred the oath in the conversation with Aemon.

* This is the moment where I address the rant ""The Finale Had No Supernatural Things"". So yeah, there are two powerful scenes in the books that readers expected to see, but as someone wisely pointed out, here's a thing: unlike dragons and White Walkers, those two entities have no direct impact on the main storyline and don't reoccur nearly as often. Said scenes have codename, in case you want to remember for the future seasons, [names from later ASOS](#b ""'Coldhands' and 'Stoneheart'""). The former gives a better explanation of why Bran goes north of the Wall and how Sam finds about the Black Gate. Avoid the living hell of googling the latter.

* Dragonglass (obsidian) is imported mostly from Asshai (where Melisandre is from) and there are lots of it at Dragonstone. It's common, but so far there hasn't been much use for it.

* Okay, so I'm mentioning this for the new guys who didn't catch up with previous posts: by the customs of the Wildlings, Jon and Ygritte are considered a man and wife since he took her his prisoner - this is what makes their conflict of love and duty so tragic.

* Pyp hasn't been a part of the expedition. This means that fates of Dolorus Edd and the other members of the Night's Watch present at Craster's Keep remain unknown.

* Notice the similiarity between how Jon and Daenerys get carried over by their people (that's just cinematography note).

I frequent this sub *a lot* and I was thinking it might be cool if each week was assigned a particular theme or topic of AGoT to analyze. 

Perhaps weekly, we could appoint a volunteer to be in charge of coming up with an open-ended question to provoke a deeper discussion (and avoid reposts). This could help keep the dialogue in this sub as fresh as possible and enable us to delve a bit deeper into some of the material we may have overlooked watching AGoT.

She's been handed everything and anything she did get was gotten through treachery 

Her dragons were a gift, her army of unsullied was gained through lies and deceit, her main adviser was gained because she was attractive, Barristan joined her because he had nowhere else to go.

Her unsullied

You may say that she gave them freedom however she sacked their city killing thousands and then left it there without even trying to rebuild it, she says they can leave if they want but where would they go? The only cities nearby are slaver cities which would imprison them in a heartbeat, they gained no freedom at all by joining Dany.

She does nothing

All she does is bark orders and let her advisers act for her, she doesn't even lead her army.

She is a psychopath

This is mostly shown in the books however it is shown somewhat in the show too, for example she locked a man inside a vault with his lover and left them to starve to death without a second thought. She sacks a city and kills thousands just because she decides that slavery is wrong in a day, she watches smiling as her dragon burns down the city (also probably killing thousands of normal families) and as the unsullied massacre the slavers.

There are more points I could make however they are mostly from the books and not the show however just using the material from the show is enough, can someone please explain why you like her so much?

- The Hound asks Arya what her coin means.
- Cut to the Twins, still with Arya speaking (explaining valar morghulis). Frey soldiers dispose of Cat's body into the river.
- Cat's body is shown flowing down the river, washing up to shore eventually.
- Cut to Pyke, with Aeron Damphair talking aloud to the Drowned God. 
- Still Aeron speaking, cut to Cat. Inconsequential members of the Brotherhood find her, bring her to the camp.
- Thoros of Myr prays over Cat. Around the time that Aeron says ""what is dead may never die, but rises harder and stronger"", Lady Stoneheart arises.

I've already got a stack of books to read, it sounded too complicated, is far too thick, and I've hear too many people grumble about it.

Over the weekend my girlfriend bought a copy and ended up leaving it at my house. When I got home from work I picked it up and decided to read the first few sentences to get a feel for his writing style.

Four hours later I'm a third of the way through it (skipping Danny chapters). I had no idea it would be this easy of a read. It reads like a soap opera, but has this weird habit of naming everybody and going into unnecessary information (worldbuilding I guess), and dipping into flashbacks a lot so that much of the book is out of order. The sentences are short, simple, and the language is easy. Chapters are also extremely brief, and each one doesn't take much more than ten or fifteen minutes to read.

Anyway, I just wanted people who were scared, like me, to know. The first book is extremely easy to pick up and read, follows the show surprisingly well, and it's a delight. So don't be afraid of it, especially now that we're in the off-season.

TL;DR: The book is long, but very easy to read. It has a lot of unnecessary information used for world building that is just filler, it's why the show is able to cut out so many characters without effecting the story.",59,3,False,default,,,,,

Jon, Ygritte, and the wildling raiders just reached the top of the wall, and Ygritte is crying. When Jon tries to comfort her, she gets mad saying she's not crying for fear, she's ""crying because we never found the Horn of Winter. **we opened half a hundred graves and let all those shades loose in the world**, and we never found the Horn..."" 

Maybe I'm thick, but is Ygritte saying she believes that she and the rest of Mance's court, for lack of a better term, are to blame for the return of the Others and Wights? Or, is she just lamenting that they let. Bunch of Wights free to no effect? 

I always thought the wildling host on the Milkwater was organized because Mance saw that the Others were stirring for reasons unknown, not because he woke them. I can't find any other textual evidence, but it's also been a year or so since I read the rest of the books.

Many of you have made subtle jabs about how the quality of this subreddit will fall now that there are no new episodes. While I don't think the quality will change, I do believe that the type of content will.

We're probably going to see a lot less show-specific material and more stuff about the book, past seasons or just random fun about anything and everything GoT. This is good news, because it gives us some time to relax and let our hair down between seasons.

What I don't want to see happen is a bunch of negative jabbering about how good this subreddit *used* to be or how we've lost our way somehow. If you game to r/gameofthrones just for show-specific material, then your best option now is to just take a leave of absence for the off-season and come back when the next season is upon us.

This subreddit is going to be a very casual, light-hearted soup of ASOIAF material for the coming months, so lets get ready.

**In the books...**

Dany goes to Yunkai, and the situation is that they have low walls (no good for a seige) but can put a strong army just outside of those walls.  That army consists of slave soldiers + three companies of mercenaries.

She gets Daario to turn on his co-captains at the last moment, so that the mercenary companies suddenly switch to fight with her instead of against her while her main force attacks at night.  Together, they easily rout the slave soldiers outside of the wall.

Then she demands that the now-undefended Yunkai turn over all the slaves in their city and allow an inspection to prove they've done so, in order to avoid being completely sacked.  They submit to this deal.  The expulsion of the slaves would correspond to the last scene in S03E10.

Next, they move on to Meereen (which has better walls and doesn't station an army outside), and use some sewer tunnels to have her strike team sneak into the city and let their army in.  this would correspond to the Jorah/Daario/Grey-Worm special-forces attack via the ""whore gate"" that we saw in S03E09.

**In the show...**

Daario turns on his co-captains well before any battle.  I'm OK with it being one mercenary company with three leaders instead of three mercenary companies, it's just the timing that seems fucked up; them blatantly switching sides was supposed to be during the attack, not well before.

Next they do the ""sneaking in"" thing to open the gates for their army.  Then they sack the city (explicitly mentioned), and only *then* for some reason, we're supposed to believe that her entire army withdrew from the city and waited outside the gates for the slaves to be sent out.

This doesn't make any sense even by itself.  Why was she waiting *outside* a city she'd already taken control of?

**What the fuck?**

Not only is this completely backwards by itself (if they were already in the city, why leave and wait for the slaves to be sent out?) but it combines the tactics used on two different cities in reverse order.  It's like they shuffled all her ""attacking a city"" scenes together and used them on Yunkai in random order.

Are they even going to do Mereen?  If so, how?  And why did they have her pointlessly and illogically blow all her tactics on Yunkai, backwards?",3,5,False,self,,,,,

However the Starks still have a lot of power in the name, and most importantly, Robb (and his family, which makes this even more intense) died as martyrs

So.. that brings us to Bran Stark (the warg). Most of the north probably assumes everyone related to the starks is dead, so imagine him coming on down, he could easily be seen as a messiah figure. Not only that, but he would be a king with the warg power, something that might grow into something so powerful that he'll hold an almost legendary mythical status to his people, much like Daenerys Targaryen has aquired with her following (she can't be burned, mother of dragons, etc).

I'm looking forward to how the story progresses with him. I have a feeling he'll become the next ""Eddard"" and ""Robb"" in the storyline in due time, except with a messiah-like status given to him from the northerners south of the wall and with a name that is martyred. I can easily see him quite literally becoming a ""jesus-like"" figure especially with his warg ability.

Of course I haven't read the books, so for all I know he's been killed off already! But it's just fun speculation.",49,21,False,self,,,,,

*Chaos is a ladder.*

*Many who try to climb it fail, and never get to try again. The fall breaks them.*

*And some are given the chance to climb, but they refuse. The cling to The Realm, or The Gods, or Love.*

*Illusions. Only the Ladder is real.*

*The Climb is all there is.*""

           - Petyr Baelish, Game of Thrones (series)


I am excited to introduce **Southron Ambitions**, a play-by-post *A Song of Ice and Fire* chronicle set in the Riverlands at the cusp of the War of the Usurper. Following the path and fate of seven noble houses sworn to the fealty and ambitions of greater houses, they will find themselves at the center of the conflict to come.


The premise of the game we want to run explores from this perspective. The consequences of great romances, heroic overtures, and complex intrigues come down to the houses that must live on this battlefield of the Seven Kingdoms. It is up to the players to decide whether they will take the helm of fate for their own, or be a casualty of it. If you are new to role-playing, play-by-post, or the *A Song of Ice and Fire* setting, or system, you are more than welcome to invite yourself in and take part regardless.


The setting we have built uses an equal part based on the Chronicle Starter and custom work by the GM.


*So how does this work?*


The ""chronicle"" will be organized into individual ""stories"", limited-run setting pieces and adventures in which people will take their characters, while the setting itself remains persistent. These stories will take place over perhaps 1-2 RL months at a time, depending on their scope, and in between some downtime is given for further story and development, through events, decisions, and scenes done independently of those stories as the Houses march through the wheel of fate.


A story will contain the bulk of the role-playing, and will be divided into ""Days"", which are further divided into time slots. These Days will progress over time, keeping the game moving at a decent pace while also providing for people of different schedules and time zones to interact. The current story is ""Summer 281 AL: A Tourney at Harrenhal"", our first story and opening game for the ***Southron Ambitions*** chronicle. If it's a success, we plan on it extending much further, so long as the interest remains.


#*So how do you join?*


You can create any number of accounts you like, though we prefer you only make accounts under your character(s)'s name. Only accounts tied to characters sanctioned for play can post in the in-character forums and the private forums for each faction.


Joining though is quite simple. Once you feel comfortable with the setting and rules, you can get to [Creating Your Character](http://southronambitions.com/viewtopic.php?f=67&amp;t=11) and submitting it via e-mail. At any time you can contact Stranger, the head Narrator, via the e-mail juvenalian.satyr@gmail.com. Alternatively, if you'd like to take a concept already baked into the setting and perhaps are not entirely comfortable with the character creation yet, you can pick one of the [Pre-Generated Characters](http://southronambitions.com/viewforum.php?f=89)


Once your sheet has cleared, the account under your character's name will be added to the appropriate usergroups. Eventually, you may change characters in between stories, or perhaps even have your character die or otherwise removed from play. You can have multiple characters accepted, and multiple accounts to your e-mail address.

So after thinking long an hard I've decided I have to stop reading the books. I just finished SOS. I'm that bad show viewer who gets pissed off when they omit things or invent filler. I hated alot of the changes made to the harry potter movies. So I've decided to give it up.

1. When I was reading the books after I had seen the show, every difference between them was ""neat"". When I watched Season 3 where I was mostly ahead of the show all the differences pissed me off.

2. My fiance cant read the books, they put her to sleep and she cant keep all the characters straight because she hasn't been reading the whole time. This sucks when I hit epic plot points like the wedding and I cant talk about them with her because shes not reading.

3. I can do foreshadowing math, when certain characters dont make it in the TV show but make it in the books, I can guess whats coming down the line.

4. I'm bad at keeping my mouth shut when the TV show is different or filled with filler fluff to retain actors. So combine that with #2 and #3 and I have a problem.

Because of this I have decided that its in my best interested to stop reading the books, I'm happy I finished SOS because of it's epic nature but in an effort to avoid the nerd rage, feast for crows will just sit on a shelf for 2 years. I know i'll enjoy the TV show much more not knowing whats coming next.

(X-post from r/asoiaf)",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1g75rs/no_spoilers_should_we_really_be_worried_about/,GRVrush2112,1371049217,"I know this has been a big topic of discussion since the inception of the show, the fact that the show could catch Martin if he does not get the last 2 books out quick enough, and alot of people are cite their reasons for worrying as ""how long it takes him to write a book"".  But I think some of those people don't realize the issues that plauged him with the two most recent books ""A Feast For Crows""  and ""A Dance With Dragons"" and why he took so long to get those books out.  We'll return to that in a bit, but if you look at the publication of the first three novels, you can see that GRRM is certainly capable of writing quickly, and without sacrifice of quality, let's looking at the publication history to demonstrate...

-  Start of writing to to publication of ""A Game of Thrones"": 1991-Aug 1996

Writing Time: 5 years/2 years

At first glance it seems like the first and shortest of the novels in ASOIAF took him a good deal of time to write, that being 5 years, and while technically correct, his main gig was still screenwriting at the time, and for three years after he started AGoT was sparingly being written.  GRRM didn't really start working on the first novel ""in earnest"" until 1994...  So if you want to look at this honestly it really only took him about a couple of years to get out the first novel..


-  ""A Game of Thrones"" Aug 1996 - ""A Clash of Kings"" Feb 1999

Publication Gap: 2 years, 6 months

The second novel was more rich, dense, and longer that the first, Martin now working on an Epic Fantasy series was able to expand his world building and create a plethora of new characters and interweave them into a better follow up in only 2 and a half years, not to mention the first of the Dunk and Egg novellas ""The Hedge Knight"" was published during this time. 

- ""A Clash of Kings"" Feb 1999 - ""A Storm of Swords"" Aug 2000(UK)/Nov 2000(US)

Publication Gap: 1 year, 6 months (UK)

Wow, if you need definitive proof that GRRM can write fast and with the best of quality, just look at this.  Only a year and a half to write what many consider the best, and one of the longest and densest novels in the series.  And according to the Wiki of Ice and Fire (where I'm sourcing these dates from), ASOS was considered ""several months late"" by his publishers.  But still, seeing this fact can't help but make someone optimistic for TWOW.

---------------

Now to the not-so-good publication times going into the two most recent novels, and the reasons why people cite this as their worry that the upcoming novels are still a long way off and that the series may catch up with the books, I want to illustrate some of the issues GRRM had with the two most recent books, and why since those issues no longer plague him that these worries are (to a degree) somewhat in-founded.

- ""A Storm of Swords"" Aug 2000 - ""A Feast for Crows"" Oct 2005

Publication Gap: 5 years, 4 Months

To understand why GRRM took so long to write book 4, you need to understand how the planned publication of book 4 changed multiple times.  When GRRM set out to write book 4 (Then titled ""A Dance With Dragons"") he had planned to advance the story 5 years after the events of ASOS and had begun work on a long extended prologue to do so, sometime later he decided against that route and had to take what he was working on in that prologue and translate that into actual chapters, including several more viewpoint characters, and had to start the book from scratch.  But the real biggest set back came when the Novel's length had grow larger than the 1500 manuscript page length of ASOS with (directly quoting GRRM here), ""No foreseeable end in sight"", he determined he would have to split the book in half.  As most people know (readers as well as non readers) ""A Feast for Crows"" and ""A Dance With Dragons"" were split geographically, not chronologically, and only half of the characters appeared in book 4, and the others appear in book 5.  Both pick up immediately after the events of ASOS.  When GRRM decide to split in this manner it forced him to again, almost start the book from scratch as many re-writes and edits were required to release the book in this fashion... but finally after 5 years ""A Feast for Crows"" was published.  He did however also publish the 2nd Dunk and Egg during this time as well, so blame a bit of the wait on it... Lol (but D&amp;E is worth it and helped readers at the time cope with the long wait).

- ""A Feast for Crows"" Oct 2005 - "" A Dance with Dragons"" July 2011

Publication Gap: 5 years, 9 months

With AFFC finished and GRRM heading into book ADWD readers were given a promise by GRRM when he stated that book 5 would ""be out next year"" in a authors's note present in AFFC.  GRRM also stated at that time that ADWD was half finished to back that up.  Since he didn't dispose of the ADWD POV chapters that were already written when ADWD and AFFC were one book, most assumed that he meant he was already halfway to home and would use those chapters...  Alas, no as with AFFC most of those chapters had to be re-written and he had to start ADWD from, you guessed it.... Scratch.  Whereas the problem with AFFC long write time was the decision to split the novel that forced re-writes, the big problem was organization and where to fit and how to structure ADWD. Not only was ADWD an organizational nightmare for GRRM, just within itself (more on that in a second), but he had to take great lengths to make sure the even though the books were split that the events taking place are chronologically in order. (Certain characters make references to other plot threads, and plot threads relate to each other cross-book). And making that all consistent was a major hurtle and influenced the long delay. But the biggest reason GRRM cites as his delay for ADWD is the ""Mereenese Knot"" (don't google that non-readers) which, without going into spoilers, was the complications that GRRM had within ADWD of getting a handful of interwieving characters to certain locations at certain points and have it all logically and chronogically consistent with each other. And if you've read ADWD, you know how interwoven some of these plot threads are and how such a thing could pose a problem.

Another thing to take into consideration into the delay for ADWD was the start of the HBO adaption of the novels that began in when HBO acquired the rights and started work on the show in the late 2000s... I'm not too sure of how involved George was early on, or if it was more than just the role of consultant and writing one script a year, but I'm sure once the show was greenlit, a considerable amount of his time was taken away by the show.  George also wrote and published the 3rd Dunk&amp;Egg novella during this time as well.  

- A bit of Optimism for a quick(er) ""Winds of Winter"" 

If there is any good news in looking forward to a quicker book 6, it is that the massive issues that plagued AFFC and ADWD are over.  As readers know 2/3 of the way through ADWD the plots from the split were rejoined when ADWD caught up with AFFC, and characters from the 4th book appeared in the last third of ADWD.  This means going forward GRRM is back to writing a straight forward and focused narrative.  I therefore, with the struggles of Feast and Dance behind him, see no reason fans should be overly worried about the final two books taking an overly long time to be finished, when he's demonstrated that when he writing on a focused story he can do it well and quickly.  

I don't expect the short gaps in publication for the final 2 books that we saw with the first 3, but I'm fairly confident that the era of 4+, or even 3+ year waits are over.   The biggest problem GRRM has now with getting the final books out are distractions.  We know he writes an episode a year, and still acts as an EP and consultant for the HBO show; as well as several public appearences he's made and interviews he's done are a large part of that distraction.  But I also think people over estimate exactly how much of a distraction it really is.  Several evenings a year to make these appearences, and some time to write a screenplay are not as large of a distraction as I think people make it out to be.  

I think it's within reason, that even with the distractions, that readers could possibly be reading ""The Winds of Winter"" by mid-2014.  We have not had a good update on his progress for a while now, but I'm optimistic that the light at the end of the tunnel is within Martin's view.  I also think while it will be close, that if GRRM keeps up a good pace ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" will be finished up with a nice lead way ahead of the show when ""A Dream of Spring"" will eventually be published..

These are of course my opinions, though I'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback.  Thanks for reading.

Rickard and Brandon were murdered by the Mad King, while Eddard and Robb were subsequently offed by the Lannisters. If its any foreshadowing, Robb had become the hot headed, emotionally driven type, like Brandon, while Jon has become more like Eddard. Calculated, logical and honor driven. I'm really hoping he doesn't die in the same manner but I hope he follows in his teachings. I guess my main point is that we shouldn't give up hope for the Starks, they seem capable of overcoming these type of events. Just wanted to share a thought.

Even worse, after that fight with the other Wildlings in E9, Jon just rides away even though Ygritte is clearly on his side.

PLEASE USE SPOILER TAGS FOR ALL BOOK SPOILERS. 

I'm a show watcher that recently started reading AGOT. I've seen a few spoilers due to my own impatience but I'm trying to stay away from them.

I know that Joffrey and Tywin both die. I think Tyrion is going to die and Jaime will get Casterly Rock. Sansa will hopefully get back north somehow. Bran is going to die defeating the White Walkers and Rickon will survive the winter with Osha and become King in the North when he grows up.  I think I saw a spoiler that says Jon becomes Lord Commander of the Night's Watch which I already thought would happen anyway. He will find Benjin Stark and learn about his mother who is probably Lyanna Stark.

King's Landing will be destroyed by Dany and her dragons. Stannis will die in battle against Dany's army and her dragons  but Dany will either die or at least lose her dragons. Either way she isn't going to get the Iron Throne.

But I believe Tommen will be on the Iron Throne at the end. GRRM said that the story will have a bittersweet ending. Tommen is a Lannister but he is not as fucked up as Joffrey was. So if Tyrion molds Tommen before he dies Tommen could be a good king.

That's all I got. Was wondering what everybody else thought of my theory. Please use spoiler tags for any comments that need them.",24,0,False,self,,,,,

Some are more time consuming than others, but you probably won't want to overwhelm yourself with a million GoT-related things only to become uninterested quickly! Pace yourself.


1. Read/Re-read the books.
1. Re-watch the first two seasons until the 3rd is out for purchase.
1. Read/watch more about the lore and events that happened prior to where the show starts off.
1. [Understand the ""web of thrones""](http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/30600000/A-Web-of-Thrones-game-of-thrones-30670278-1280-1055.jpg) look up about each character at a spoiler-free place.
1. Watch behind-the-scenes of the seasons and episodes.
1. Purchase yourself some GoT-related merchandise.
1. Listen to the complete soundtrack.
1. If you're creative, make something GoT-related (sculpt, draw, craft, write, etc).
1. Memorize the lyrics to The Rains of Castamere song.
1. Write to GRRM or your favorite actor from the show, and ask for an autograph!
1. Read fanfiction (there's always plenty of talented writers writing wonderful side stories).
1. Throw or attend one or two GoT-theme parties before the next season.
1. If you have musical talent, learn to play the popular themes.
1. Speculate with your friends.
1. Try the GoT FB game (I've no idea if it's good).
1. If you're a girl (or, heck, even a guy), try to copy one of the hairstyles from the show.
1. Check to see if GRRM or any GoT actors are going to be present at a convention near you, and attend!

Feel free to add to the list, I'll try to update with popular ideas. Please keep this spoiler-free.

Here is a selection of actors who I would love to see added to the show:

[Jeremy Irons](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000460/?ref_=sr_1) - Amazing in The Borgias.

[Brian Cox](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004051/) -I enjoyed his role in Deadwood, and he's just good in anything.

I know many book readers, like me, love watching non readers trying to figure everything out so please share your theories and expectations (and even hopes!) with us!


Some points to think about:


* What's next for Dany? She's got a massive infantry now and the slaves she liberated loves her. Do you have any predictions for Jorah, Barristan and Daario?


* Where will the Hound and Arya go?


* What will happen to Bran and his gang north of the Wall?


* What will happen to Jaime now that he is back in KL? Will Cercei treat him differently? Will he treat her differently? And his position as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard? What about Brienne? Many still believe she killed Renly.


* Littlefinger and Lysa Arryn


* Sansa and Tyrion. Also Tyrion and Shae.


* Joffrey and Margaery.


* Gendry


* Stannis and his gang. What's next?


* Jon and Sam at the Wall? Will the wildling raid party still attack Castle Black even though it is warned? There is Mance and his army as well.


* Theon, and Yara coming to rescue him


* What new locations do you expect to see?


* Anything else? Hot Pie? Rickon? Podrick?

If it turns out we really need somewhere to comment on the replies here, make a separate thread for it. I don't have any authority on here of course, but I'm hoping everyone will comply.

I've read the book a while ago and may have forgotten bits and pieces, but correct me if I'm wrong - Theon's only mention in all of book 3 was that of his finger skin being sent to Robb?  

If so, why would the creators of the show spend so much of the valuable screen time developing a non-existent storyline when they could have instead concentrated on actual plot development and detailing?

R'hollor sports a champion which is known to all as Azor Ahai Reborn and as we know from Melisandre she believes Stannis to be this messiah (whereas Benerro believes Daenerys to be it). According to AWoIaF also the Great Other sports a champion, at least Melisandre believes so. In her flame visions she sees a boy with a wolf's head beside him and thinks this is the champion of the Great Other. The link of this boy leads to Bran Stark. Could it be that Bran Stark is possibly to be the great scourge of Westeros as the champion of the Great Other? Would anybody hop on that speculation train?

There are a ton of spoilers about the show in this so I hope I was able to include that warning properly. 

A friend and I have been arguing about this since Sunday. Based on the three seasons, and not on the books because he and I haven't read them, who has been dealt with harder cards? Sansa or Daenerys? I understand that there could be other characters that you could compare but we decided that those are the two characters who have received the most shit. 

In my opinion Sansa has it worse and she definitely suffers the most for these reasons which definitely contain **spoilers** : 

*She's promised that her father's life would be spared...It's not 
*She sees her father being executed
*Her Direwolf gets killed
*Joffrey isn't the boy she thought he was: he doesn't like her, he torments and abuses her, and eventually drops her like a hot potato. 
*She is forced to marry someone she doesn't even like. 
*She's married into a family who uses her as a pawn and she has no power to make her situation any better. 

My friend has made good points about Daenerys having it worse but holistically, I think Sansa does. Thanks for reading this!! ",10,0,False,self,,,,,

Each of you has 10 positive points and 10 negative points to distribute as you wish in the comments below. After one week I will add these points to each character's current season total to determine the winner of this season. Here is your chance to reward characters I have slighted and punish those I have been to generous to. You may also reward points to characters who haven't earned points yet. See the link at the bottom for the current standings.

onto the rankings:


Game of Thrones Season 3 Finale

Tywin Lannister +10 (Season Total: 45): T-Lan gets some overdue points for masterminding the best wedding ever.

Arya Stark +10 (Season Total: 16): This could be the beginning of a beautiful kill streak.

Yara Greyjoy +10 (Season Total: +10): Better late than never. Yara has been missed this season, and she is back with the 50 baddest ass Ironborn. Epic exposition bro.

Stannis Baratheon +10 (Season Total: -2): Stannis finally nuts up and makes a good decision (I will ignore for the moment that he still only made the call because Melisandre told him to). 

Samwell Tarly +10 (Season Total: +9): Sam may have just bumbled his way into saving the entire continent.

Davos Seaworth +8 (Season Total: +15): As hand of the king, I advise you not to execute the hand of the king. Classic Davos. Plus he rescued Gendry. 

Jaime Lannister +8 (Season Total: +10): Glad to see him home, at least 95 percent of him.

Ramsay Snow +6 (Season Total: +20): Finally we know who this dude is. Pro tip: Cook burgers if he is coming to your family cookout, hot dogs could lead to some awkward moments.

Gendry +6 (Season Total: -5):  If he drowns: oh the irony.

Daenyrs Targaryen +5 (Season Total: +50): Have you assuaged your white guilt yet? 

Cersei Lannister +5 (Season Total: +1): Are you ready for some incest? She is.

Tyrion Lannister +4 (Season Total: +4): Defended Sansa's honor and made Joffrey look like a bitch in one fell swoop.

Jon Snow +3 (Season Total: +28): Took those arrows like a champ.

Melisandre +3 (Season Total: +15): Totally missed out on the whole White Walker invasion business, but had Davos back in the end so that's good.

The Hound +3 (Season Total: +14): Nice assist.

Ygritte +3 (Season Total: +9): It probably hurt her more than it hurt him, but shooting your lover like that is some epic white trash wilding shit. He had it coming, you go girl.

Roose Bolton +2  (Season Total: +21): Making an appearance for no reason but to cackle and be evil, and I love it.

Walder Frey +2 (Season Total: +17): Ditto. Also, does Walder remind anyone else of one of the old guys who sit in the balcony on the Muppet Show?

Theon Greyjoy +1 (Season Total: -36):  Theon has fared worse than any of the characters who died this season. With the Ramsay reveal I can only hope the worst is over.

After seeing the Red Wedding, I have only just realized that a year ago, whilst on a road trip, my brother trolled me and (somewhat) revealed the Red Wedding. 

My brother asked what songs I was currently listening to, and I included the Rains of Castamere in my list of songs - I was constantly humming it for about a week straight.

Upon hearing that I listen to the Rains of Castamere, my brother asks, ""Oh, you mean that, like, Lannister song? Their murder-song?""

""Yeah, I guess,"" I replied.

""The one they play when they murder people?"" he asked again, seeming curious, *playing me like a fiddle*.

""I suppose - I mean, it's about murder, right?"" I continued, not getting the hint.

""Oh, okay. That's cool, man.""

I wouldn't say that I *hate* her, but there's little reason for us to root for her on the show. 

Sometimes I even feel sympathetic for her; I think she's an intrinsically moral person overall and has decent intentions. That says a lot in GoT. It's her constant whining that irritates me. As the series has progressed, I can't help but view her as overly entitled. 

Stop whining Shae, you have it pretty good.

It seems the king with a wolf's head at a feast of corpses is Robb being killed at the Red Wedding.

The one with the king saying ""let him be the king of ashes"" is Mad King Aerys giving his pyromancer King Of The Hand instructions to burn the city with wildfire, which is why Jaime eventually kills the king.

Rubies flying like drops from the chest of a dying prince is Rhaegar being defeated at the Trident by Robert.

The red sword in the hand of a blue-eyed king, is that Stannis with Lightbringer?

The smoking tower from which the great stone beast takes flight, is that Drogon flying from a burning pyramid in Mereen?

But what is ""the corpse at the prow of a ship, eyes bright in his dead face, grey lips smiling sadly?""

And what is ""the blue flower grew from a chink in a wall of ice, and filled the air with sweetness?"" That seems pretty clearly to refer to Jon Snow's wall, but what's the blue flower?

I love all the small bits of detail that the show only briefly describes, or in some cases completely skips over, that fill in more of a back story for some of the characters. I am also completely caught up on the show. 

My question is for those of you that have read the books first then watched the show. How well do the actors portray how you interpreted the characters? Are there any where there is a stark contrast between how you imagined them and how they turned out in the show? It drives me a bit nuts when every time I try to imagine a scene playing out while reading that the actors pop into my head, rather than using only what I know. I'm sure once I get to the 4th book I'll have a couple more characters to try to imagine first.

I think so far for me one of the most accurate representations has been Lord Baelish. You just get the sense of how plotting/scheming/sly he can be. Lord Varys' actor also seems to do a good job of portraying how I would imagine someone who had plenty of spies, avoided conflict, and made very calculated decisions.

What does everyone else think? Obviously only discussing Season 1-3 because Season 4 isn't out for the show yet. If you have any thoughts about a 4th book+ character keep it general without going into spoilers. :)",11,5,False,self,,,,,

And Boltons, Boltons are so fuckin' insane that it makes me like them, just like with Joker in Batman. Someone made a comment, that the one torturing Greyjoy is a Medieval Joker.

Daario Naharis is one of the fun ones too. Loved the way he killed the other two captains and went to Daenerys with their heads.

How would the rest of the story have been affected?



* Would the Hound (with Sansa) still be captured by the Brotherhood? How would Arya have reacted to seeing Sansa again?

* How would the Lannisters react with neither Stark sister as a hostage? How would Littlefinger react?

* Without Sansa in King's Landing, how would the power struggle between the Tyrells and Lannisters have played out?

* Would the Stark sisters have made it back to Robb and Catelyn in time? Would this have affected Robb's battle plans? Or would they still perish at the Red Wedding, but now with two more casualties?

I have watched all of the show so far and read up to Feast, but I do not remember anything about this. Isn't it somewhat weird that a man conducting a large aquatic invasion did not have any way of seeing a large army of reinforcements coming towards the capital, or did Stannis know but expected to not lose so many from the wildfire?

Ned remembered how she died in a room that smelled of blood and roses. AND she made him promise something before she died.
As a truthful series follower, I know that Rhaegar really loved her.
As soon as I read the part about the promise Ned had to make, all wheels in my head started spinning immediately and I came up with this theory about Jon Snow's heritage.
How was it possible that Lyanna died all bloodied up? Who would want to kill her? Rhaegar loved her and so did Robert.
Nobody would stab the trophy wife of the Targaryen crown prince...
So, how was it possible she bled like crazy to fill the room with the scent of blood?
I think she passed away while giving birth to Jon Snow, she bled to death because Ned Stark isn't exactly a schooled maternity nurse.
Now, there are 2 guys who could have knocked her up: Rhaegar and Robert.
Since Targaryens all have silver\white hair, I think Robert is Jon's father and Lyanna made Ned promise that their son would be raised as Robert's son.

After having that said, you remember how Ned changed Robert's will in the tv series?
I don't remember exact details, but Ned ended up writing that the Iron Throne would go to Robert Baratheon's rightful heir.
Since Jon is Robert's oldest son, and he was kinda legal since Robert was bethroted to Lyanna at the time, Jon would have been next in line to be king on the Iron Throne.

He was just so incredibly useless, and in the show he didn't become useful at all until he managed to kill the Other. I started reading the books though, and I'm about 3/4 of the way through ASOS and I've found Sam to be much better in the books.

For one thing, while he is immediately just as useless as he is in the show, Jon has a line (or it may have been part of his internal monologue) that made me reevaluate him, something like ""It takes a certain kind of brave to admit you're a craven"". After that you learn more about Sam, you find out he can read, count, cook, sing, etc. I don't remember any of that happening or being mentioned in the show, although it's been some time since I've seen the first season so I could be wrong. 

There's more than that though, in the show, during the wights attack on the Watch, Sam fucks up his only job. In the book he has two and he pulls them off without a hitch, he also kills an Other earlier on before going on to kill another Wight. All in all, Sam in the books is way more likable than Sam in the show, who, for like two and a half seasons, felt more like a burden than a character I actually cared for. 

How does everyone else feel about Sam's change in the show? It feels like a bad decision to me. They neglected like two to three seasons worth of character development for the guy and instead just made him a fairly flat character who is utterly useless. A nice guy, sure, but again, useless. It's not even like the book had extra stuff that the show neglected, all the scenes which could have helped towards his development or characterization were in the show still, they just changed them in a negative way that made Sam fairly unlikable at first I think. I wonder why they changed his character in the ways that they did especially.",38,48,False,self,,,,,

In other news, it's the offseason. 

I wrote lyrics about Roose and the Red Wedding to the tune of Footloose called ""The Roose is Loose.""

[Here are the lyrics I wrote.](http://shorttext.com/ZcgyXZa)

[Link to the actual song ""Footloose"" by Kenny Loggins.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhHynAxHURA) 

To get an idea of how they match up, it's a good idea to play the song while you're reading they lyrics. So, I'm wondering if any Redditors out there with more musical talent than I would be interesting in singing/playing the cover?

Any suggestions for modifying the lyrics is also welcomed. Thanks!",8,16,False,self,,,,,

During the second part of Dany and Khal Drogo's wedding in the pilot episode, Magister Illyrio mentions that the dragon eggs that Dany receives are from the shadowlands beyond Asshai.


I took an interest in Ulthos, the continent in the very far South East. I speculate that there may be more dragons there.


1) Ulthos has an even darker and more foreboding purple coloration from The Shadowlands (I assume these two places are filled with thick magical forests).

2) Asshai is a powerful city, filled with magical powers. It makes sense, at least in speculation, that the areas surrounding them would be magical too.

3) According to GRRMs blog, [Souce: http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Ulthos[2] ] Ulthos is a large island (and I assume not inhabited, at least, not by non magic users), and I speculate that this island may contain more dragon eggs.


I have not read any of the books (plan on reading them after finishing the TV series again), so I don't know if any of this has been mentioned in the books, but I think it raises a fair question and am interested to see what other people think.
Seems logical enough for me that there are more than three dragons left, and Ulthos seems like a place that they would lurk...",15,20,False,default,,,,,

There are still things that are unclear so hopefully you guys can shed some light on it. Or maybe these will be revealed in the upcoming seasons, in which case I hope you guys don't spoil it for me.

So here it goes:

- What happened to the remains of Ned Stark? I recall Littlefinger bringing Ned's remains to Catelyn. She was supposed to bring it to Winterfell so he could rest besides his family, but since she never made it to Winterfell, I assume she had Ned's ""body"" with her the entire time.

- A similar question to the above, what happened to the bodies of Robb, Catelyn and Talisa? Robb was beheaded, but we didn't see what happened to the in the season finale. 

- Robb's army was deafeated in S3E9, but does that mean all of them died or were taken prison? Or did some of them make it out? I know Brynden Tully made it out, but what about Robb's bannermen. Also, how many men did rob have at that time? Assuming the Karstark men left, he should have had app. 10,000, correct?

- The dead turn into white walkers, but what do the white walkers do with the baby boys? Kill them and turn them into baby white walkers?

- Sansa married Tyrion. It seemed to me like she didn't have a choice, but why is that? She is very naive and still very young but one would assume she would be allowed to choose who she marries. Do the Lannisters have such a big influence on her? It seems she didn't even resist or try to escape the city.

- What was the cause of Robb's death (and his mother's and wife's of course)? Was it due to Melisandra's spell? Or was it because the two Lannister boys were slaughtered by Karstark men while under Robb's protection? Was that Robb's punishment by the Gods?

- Did Edmure die? Was he killed in the events of the Red Wedding or did he make it out as well?

So, did I actually miss something in the show or will these be revealed later on?

(I hope I did the spoiler tag correctly)

I like fantasy well enough but have never been a diehard fan, and I didn't think it would hold up to the hype.

And then my neighbor lent me the DVDs of the first season. Within 20 minutes I was hooked. I watched the whole first season in a weekend, then got the second, and I'm now current with the end of the third season. Once I'd caught up (took me about two weeks), I went out and bought all five books to keep myself occupied reading until the next episode aired. I've now read the first two books while rewatching the corresponding episodes, just to get a better sense of the characters.

For those of you experiencing the pangs of Westeros withdrawal, I HIGHLY recommend reading the books if you haven't done so. The first and second seasons hew quite closely to the original source material, but there are some little differences that give an interesting perspective on the major plot arc. There are also characters in the books that don't make it in to the show (or haven't yet anyway), and reading the story from the point of view of the major characters gives you some insight into their motives and feelings that you won't get from the show.

Plus, if you read the books, you'll get to be the one filming your friends' reactions next season when major events occur. Go borrow them from the library, or a friend, or buy them if you're lucky enough to have a stable income. I haven't devoured books like this in years- they are a highly engaging read. Don't let the 800+ per book page count scare you off; even if you only read a few chapters a day you can easily be all caught up by next March.",84,147,False,self,,,,,

He's mentioned a few times, often in regards to Sandor, but for such a menacing character he's completely absent from the story. They made such a big deal about him in season 1, and during season 2 he achieved less screen time and plot contribution than Hot Pie.

I've been spoiled already in regards to his future in the series, and it's this knowledge of events that leaves me to wonder why they aren't developing his character for what's to likely to be a very climatic point in Season 4.

Did the character just not appear in the books during the events of Season 3? Does it have anything to do with them casting Ian Whyte in place of Conan Stevens, and the fans (rightfully so) not agreeing with the casting choice? 

Side note: Please tell me they are pumping Ian full of steroids as we speak, because it's goddamn insulting to go from [this guy](http://www.magweb.com/picts/actor/167493/conan_stevens.jpg) to [this guy](http://www.bigdonsboys.com/basketball/pages_9_12/images/7_1_ian_whyte_005.jpg) without at least throwing in a line about how badly malnourished his character had become for whatever reason.",5,0,False,self,,,,,

There's interviews with the cast... behind the scenes of awesome stuff, like an hour of behind-the-scenes footage for S02E09... There's even about 2-3 hours of content where the main actors (like Margaery, Catelyn, Joffrey, etc) voice over storyboard-like history about Robert's Rebellion, the different houses, and more.

The contents of the extras is full of so much content, and is definitely worth the extra cost of the Bluray, and will help satiate your desire for new Game of Thrones content, especially if you aren't a book reader.

I do warn you, however, to only watch the extras AFTER the season they come with, as the extras contain [spoilers](http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/32457686.jpg).

I'm definitely looking forward to grabbing the Season 3 Bluray to watch the extras that come with it, and I'm sure that will help me cry less waiting for Season 4.

In the show's pilot I always liked the quote Ed tells Bran:
""he who passes the sentence, should swing the sword...""

I love the way the book handles this patriarchal lesson: 

""If you would take a man's life, you owe it to him to look into his eyes and hear his final words. And if you can not do that, then perhaps the man does not deserve to die. A ruler who hides behind paid executioners soon forgets what death is.""

These weapons are known for being incredibly rare, and incredibly deadly.

But my topic focuses on the creation of these weapons. The ancient art of creating Valyrian Steel is said to have been lost for generations, and the ability to reforge Valyrian Steel only known by the greatest blacksmiths.

So, we have proof that Valyrian steel can be reforged, (Ice turning into Oathkeeper and Widow's Wail), so why can't the numerous, unnamed, seemingly limitless number of Valyrian steel daggers found throughout Westeros simply be used in the same way?

The ridiculous number of Valyrian steel daggers is proven through a variety of in-book instances, such as Joffrey's ability to just, ""pick out a dagger from his father's collection"" to give Bran's would be assassin, as well as Euron's gifts to all of the ironborn consisting of these daggers and other things.

Why wouldn't someone just gather all these daggers up and then forge them into some badass weapon like the smith that reforged Ice?

I mean, I'm pretty sure Tywin Lannister (who was said to have been searching for a Valyrian Steel blade for quite some time in books 2/3), would have been able to find a smith and an ample number of Valyrian steel daggers and turned them into a reputable Lannister blade, but why didn't he?

but, we'll see if GRRM expands on this kind of thing.",16,9,False,self,,,,,

white walkers? Of all the knowledge to preserve in all of history,
that should be about the most important! From reading ancient books
Tarley seems to know details from thousands of years ago, but not the
most useful detail. And uncovering the buried dragonglass should have
at least been a hint! ""Why would a brother hide it here?"" ""I expect
it's 'cause he wanted somebody to find it."" Come on, no guess about
what it's used for?

2.  Mag the Mighty and Donnal Noye - I really hope they show up but I think not.  
3.  Ellaria Sand - She could easily go       
4.  Garlan Tyrell - He is already gone right? (will miss him at the Purple Wedding)  
5.  Brown Ben Plumm and Strong Belwas - Not seen yet, I doubt they will be added

This is all speculation, and while there is strong evidence to the validity of this particular theory, it is just that, speculation... However, possible discussion in this thread deals with backstory that has not been given to the non-reader (whereas readers had all this information by the point where the show is now), and these important bits of backstory could still be brought up in the show, indeed the point of this thread is to figure out how that could happen... That being said lets begin....


Book readers are very aware of a particular theory regarding Jon Snow and his parentage, the common, pretty much accepted theory that Jon is the son of Rhaegar Targaryen, and Lyanna Stark.  And that Ned raised Jon as his Bastard to protect him from Robert, after Lyanna made Ned promise to do so...this theory is often referred to as ""R+L=J""

To Catch up on all the evidence read this from towerofthehand..a lengthy article that gives pretty much every bit of evidence on the matter..

(For the non-reader towerofthehand lets you set a spoiler scope to the books you've read, so if you see nothing when you open the link below, set the scope to ASOS, as all the evidence comes from the first 3 books you should be safe even if the scope is set to ADWD.  There is one minor spoiler in the write up, as the article mentions a bit of backstory Meera tells to Bran, and that could still happen, and I will mention it again in a bit, but it is also backstory, and safe for you)
http://towerofthehand.com/essays/chrisholden/jon_snows_parents.html

If you read through the article, you can see there is a mountain of evidence in the first 3 books that supports R+L=J.... The issue is that all this has been left to the books, and nothing of this has been incoperated into the show...

We did not get Ned's Fever dream referencing the Tower of Joy...

We did not get Dany's vision of Rhaegar, or the blue flower in the House of the Undying...

And we have not been given any information (in show, though I think it has been covered in the Blu Ray animated extras) on the Tourney at Harrnenhall...

So, if R+L=J turns out to be true, how on earh will it be handled on the show?  Say readers do find out in the next book for sure, will the show just lay it on the viewer when the show gets to that point without building it up with the evidences book readers got, and explain afterward?  Or will the show over the next few seasons start giving non-readers these subtle clues so they can draw the same conclusions and theorize before it is hypothetically revealed on the show?

Should R+L=J hold true I think the showrunners will lay down the evidences before hand, as GRRM did for us readers... How is a different question.  The Tower of Joy scene is tricky as it could be relayed through diologue through a number of characters, as many knew Ned went there to rescue Lyanna, and cut through several Kingsguard to do so, though no one has the full story, other than Howland Reed.  I guess he could have told some of the story to his children Jojen and Meera (not the full truth, I doubt Meera and Jojen would have been told the full truth of the baby Ned adopted from his sister) and that could be later relayed to Bran on the show...

The same goes for the ""Knight of the Laughing Tree""/ Tourney at Harrenhall story, just have that info relayed to bran as well.  

If those bits of info are given to the non-reader, I think it would be enough for the show only person to start speculating what readers have long speculated about Jon... Sadly the related visions Dany has in the House of the Undying (Rhaegar/ blue flower in a wall of ice) I think are gone, and have no idea how they could be implemented.  Those two bits however are not the most important, and I think non-readers can piece the theory together from the other evidences that could be revealed through diologue.

However, I really wish they would do something other than ""just diologue"", I know the show runners said they're not doing flashbacks, but man it would be nice if they did..  

Those are my thoughts, but let me know what you think and how you can see the concept of R+L=J could come up on the show..",25,17,False,self,,,,,

As I became fascinated with the tv series, I decided to look up some lore about the Targaryens and the Barathians. What interested me the most was Robert's Rebellion and most notably Rhaegar Targaryen in this rebellion. I can't stop thinking about how interesting of a storyline this was (More-so interesting than the current tv series storyline IMO). Can any book readers give me insight on Rhaegar Targaryen? He seemed like a very interesting character that had tons of potential; much different than his father appeared. It just feels weird that he's become my favorite character even though he's not in the active show. 

Also, another conflict I have in my mind is Viserys Targaryen. All throughout the show, I hated this guy so much. After looking into his background, I can't help but feel sorry for the guy. Yes, he should have been more humble but IMO it's rather sad that they killed off another Targaryen so easy. I understand that him and his sister couldn't co-exist but I just don't understand why he had to go out that way. 

Sorry for the wall of text, I just thought I'd take advantage of how insightful and active this board is since I've been actively reading every post here for months now.",19,8,False,self,,,,,

My mother came home from work today and came in to see whats up, I was in that stage of sleep where you're awake but you don't know you are. Almost a sleepwalk. Eventually get up an hour later and my mother tells me I was going on about Jon Snow and how he must get back to the wall and save the Seven Kingdoms from winter.

It's been ~~a hell~~ seven hells of a season, and as with every season, the show has gained more and more viewers. A lot of this is going to be a rehashing of old things for new subscribers, but I'd suggest everyone read it.

1. **ALL posts need a bracketed spoiler scope in the front of the title.** This is a relatively new rule, implemented to make spoiler scopes clearer. The scope not only tells the casual redditor what the post itself might spoil, but it sets the tone of discussion in the comments. A picture from the first episode may have different discussion with a [S3] tag on it than if it had a [S1E1] tag in front of it. Relatedly, **[Possible Spoilers] is not a valid scope.** You must be sure to clearly define the spoiler scope in the beginning of the title. Your tag may say [No Spoilers], [S3], [AFFC], whatever you want as long as the scope is clearly defined.

2. **[All Spoilers] denotes spoilers for all the books and all the episodes.** If you see a post with [All Spoilers] in the title, it means that everything is okay to post without a tag (except speculation on the future of the series, which still requires the green speculation tag). If you post with [All Spoilers], be prepared for people to talk about the later books. **If you want to define the scope as the most recent episode, then use [All Show], [Season 3], or [S3E10].**

3. **[No Spoilers]** means that the post and discussion should contain no discussion about the story. So [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1gmsh9/no_spoilers_tormund_giantbro/) and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1gmjpr/no_spoliers_happy_warg/) violate the spoiler rule. **[No Spoilers] should be used for meta discussion about the show, books, or subreddit.** For example, if someone asks how to get a copy of ADWD's paperback, that can say [No Spoilers], because it doesn't have anything to do with the story itself.

4. Remember that spoilers should be clear and direct. This next one applies to both spoilers in a comment and in a title. **Do not use clarifiers like ""early,"" ""minor,"" ""soft,"" etc. in the scope.** It doesn't matter whether it's a minor ASOS spoiler, it still gets a regular [ASOS] spoiler.

3. **The third season only covers the first half of A Storm of Swords!** Well, the first ~2/3s, but that's not terribly important. Even if you're totally caught up on the show, do not hover over ASOS book spoilers. A lot happened this past season on the show, and a lot still remains from the third book.

4. Likewise, I suggest that all book readers try to make it clear to any readers that what is under the tag is in the latter portion of the book. **I strongly encourage people posting about ASOS material left out of Season 3 to use a tag such as [ASOS pt 2] or [ASOS/S4] so that no one is accidentally spoiled.** This isn't a rule that will be enforced, but again, it's strongly encouraged. Think of it as being helpful to your fellow fans.

5. On the sidebar, there are links to four different ways to view the subreddit. **NORMAL MODE** lets you view the subreddit as it normally appears. **SHOW SPOILERS** lets you view the subreddit with all the spoilers showing so you don't have to hover, and is only recommended if you've read and watched everything. **TALK ONLY** lets you view the subreddit's self posts, while **MUTE TALK** lets you view the subreddit without them. Feel free to use these filters to your advantage.

6. Please remember that only content relating to the show or book series is allowed on the subreddit. An image macro over a picture from the show is perfectly fine to post. But if the image itself isn't related, then it doesn't belong. For example, a Confession Bear meme about the series doesn't belong here. All of those posts can go to /r/ASongofMemesandRage. A good rule of thumb is that **if it isn't relevant to Game of Thrones without the title, then it doesn't belong here.**

7. Please check out our [posting policy](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/wiki/posting_policy) before submitting a link. We on the mod team keep reposts down to a two week limit, so we'll remove anything we've seen recently. We also remove certain content that is overposted. A list of overposted content that we try to limit can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/wiki/dont_post).

10. As always, be respectful to each other. We don't like people namecalling or being rude. This extends to the actors. Please don't objectify them, especially the young'uns. I don't like to think how many inappropriate comments I've read about Maisie Williams or Sophie Turner. SMH

11. **IF YOU ARE A SHOW-WATCHER WHO WANTS TO READ THE BOOKS, START AT THE FIRST ONE.** I get at least three questions about it a day that I personally answer (and they always violate the spoiler title rule, so I have to remove the post too), and I can't answer as to how many the other mods get in addition. Not a single book-reader recommends starting in the middle of the series.

----

Thanks for reading all that. Be on the lookout for a mod post in the near future about what sort of things will happen here on the off-season. And in honor of the new Superman movie that I have to get out and see, [here's](http://imgur.com/kL8STCG.jpg) the obligatory cute dog.

I have the impression that the brotherhood led a mission beyond the wall to do reconnisance on the white walkers.

If this is so, why did they go to the ruined fortress of the first men?  A good vantage point?

Why did the brotherhood then decide to reconioter the wildlings?   Did they surmise that they would invade the south to get away from the white walkers?

Why not just form an alliance with them to fight off the white walkers?

Was Jon Snow's mission to confirm that the wildlings had invasion plans?

Why did Jon Snow's mission commander get into the mock fight with him?   Was it that he was a long standing enemy of the wildling leadership, that he was likely to be killed and he decided to make use of it to help embedd Jon Snow as an undercover agent?

*Just eat, drink, and be merry*, he remembered Cersei whispering to him the night before. *Tomorrow will be a grand day.*

This day was, by all means, supposed to be a festive affair. Families, friends, allies across the Realm had gathered into King's Landing for this very day - the day that the King would finally be wed.

*My son is getting married today*, Jaime thought. *I should be happy. Right?*

He should have been happy, but deep down inside, he felt nothing. He didn't know if it was because he never had the chance to hold his own son in his arms, or that Joffrey grew up believing that Robert Baratheon was his father, but it didn't matter. This King was not his son.

But Cersei loved him. Oh how she did. He remembered entering her chambers shortly after Joffrey had been born. He could never forget the twinkle in her eyes as she rocked him gently to sleep.

It was the same look as when he and Cersei made love for the first time. She was vulnerable, then, unhappy with the arranged marriage to Robert. She needed a shoulder to cry on, and he was there to comfort her. He was always there for her.

The spark between them was always there as well, but neither of them had ever acted on their impulses. They both had a father they didn't want to disappoint. In the heat of that moment though, their lust for each other was undeniable. He leaned in to kiss her, and she made no attempt to push him away. He was hers, and she was his. The affair began, and this forbidden love grew with each passing day.

Journeying back from the reaches of death, he had time to assess what he would ever do if he ever reached home, for there were surely times he thought that the idea was a mere fantasy. There was only one thing in this world that he wanted, and that was Cersei at his side. His resolve strengthened with each step closer to King's Landing. When she was in his arms the night before, he knew that that was what he wanted. Let the world be damned. He no longer cared even for what their father or others might say. He loved her, simple as that.

Which was why when she voiced her disapproval the night before, the words cut deep.

*You've changed, Jaime.*

He took a long drink of the golden ale.

""What troubles you, dear brother?"" Tyrion, who had previously been trying to get his wife, the Stark girl, to eat, seemed to have given up hope and turned his attention to him instead. ""You haven't looked so glum since the day of Robert Baratheon's wedding.""

Jaime smiled. His brother knew him well. A bit too well. ""Affairs of the heart,"" he replied. ""Another wedding, another reminder that I'm not getting any younger.""

""I thought you very much enjoyed your bachelorhood. If you prefer it, we can switch places.""

""And risk your lovely wife murdering me in my sleep? Lords, you must be joking. I cannot fathom what goes through that poor girl's head.""

Tyrion smirked. ""That makes two of us.""

""Have you two...""

""No,"" he said firmly. ""That girl has been tormented enough.""

They shared a brief moment of silence before Tyrion spoke again.

""Come, it's only custom for guests to be drunk at a wedding, right?"" he said, waving across the banquet hall. At that time, a third of the way into their seventy-seven course wedding feast, more than half the guests were already drunk, and a few passed out even. ""And, you, dear brother, seem to have quite a bit of catching up to do.""

Jaime raised his chalice. ""I'll drink to that."" They clinked their cups and drank. He didn't have the tolerance his brother had, but he was more than willing to drown his sorrows. ""Tell me, are the rumors about Joffrey as bad as they claim to be?""

""Now, now, you know speaking ill of the King, is treason. And even worse on his wedding day.""

Jaime scoffed. ""You've never been one to hold your tongue.""

Tyrion leaned in so that only Jaime could hear. ""He threatened to serve Robb Stark's head to Lady Sansa at this very wedding.""

Jaime simply nodded. He glanced briefly at Sansa and felt a pang of regret, unable to keep the promise he made to Brienne and Catelyn Stark. When he got word of the Red Wedding, he knew he was no longer bound by the contract that permitted his release, but that didn't make him feel any better. Even if he was able to somehow secure the Stark girl's release, she no longer had a family to go back to. *At this point, Tyrion is her family. The gods are cruel.* Even though they were once his enemy, the Starks deserved a better fate.

""Have you talked to father yet?""

Tywin Lannister was seated on Jaime's right, between himself and Cersei, and beyond her were the newlyweds. His father's face was stoic and expressionless, eyes gazing off into the distance. Their last conversation still weighed heavy in Jaime's heart.

*You are not my son. You say you are the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, and only that. Very well, ser. Go do your duty.*

He nodded. ""Much has changed in King's Landing since I was last here.""

""More than you can imagine.""

""I hear you've become the master of coin. Never thought you for role.""

""One can only spend so much time getting drunk or bedding companions,"" Tyrion replied wistfully. ""Now I'm wed, and Lord Baelish has left for the Vale, so father thought in some perverted fashion that I would be fit for the role.""

""And?""

""It keeps me occupied."" He downed the rest of his drink. ""Now, if you'll excuse me, I've consumed too much wine and am in much need of relief."" Tyrion hopped off his seat and left the hall, leaving Jaime to only his thoughts.

The feast had reached its twentieth meal, and the band had just finished its rendition of ""Bear and the Maiden Fair"". At the corner of his eye, he spotted the bride, Margaery, the lone daughter of the Tyrell family, excusing herself from the table. She was young, and pretty. He wondered if there was more to this wedding than just a political marriage to unite the Tyrells and the Lannisters. This game of thrones began to sicken him.

Not long after Margaery had departed the banquet hall did Cersei follow in tow. Most of the guests were either too drunk or entertained by a pair of dancing dwarves, to notice. Jaime rose from his seat and left as well, despite feeling his father's watchful gaze on his back.

A long corridor ran from where both Margaery and Cersei exited the banquet hall. He could hear commotion further in the hallway, and hid around the corner rather than expose himself in what began to sound like a quarrel.

""I know what you've done."" The voice was Cersei's, and he detected disdain in her words.

""And what exactly is it that?""

""I have eyes and ears throughout this city. You didn't think I would know that you hired your maiden to try and poison me?""

Silence. Jaime risked a peek, and saw Cersei had removed from her sleeve a small glass jar no larger than his fist. Inside it was a purple liquid he could not identify.

""The Tear of Lys. A rare and fatal poison you took great lengths to acquire. Unfortunately for you, you should've tested it out before having your maiden pour some in my wine.""

The realization dawned on Margaery. ""You knew the merchant.""

""Smart girl. Not smart enough, I'm afraid.""

""Joffrey loves me more than you. Even if he discovers the truth, I'll be pardoned, especially now that I am the Queen.""

And then Cersei leaned in. Margaery was unprepared, too stunned to react to the dagger that had penetrated her stomach. She stumbled backwards, eyes wide and mouth agape. The blood ran down her thighs, staining her lily white dress.

""You will not use my son against me,"" Cersei said. There was an unexpected frailty in her voice. ""My son...""

Blood gurgled from her mouth. ""But I already have..."" Margaery said and fell against the marble wall. A pool of blood began to form from where she lay.

The sounds of footfalls behind him threatened to reveal his position. He turned around and found Joffrey standing there, guards flanking his side.

""Your Grace..."" He bowed his head, realizing he needed to think fast. Cersei would need an alibi. ""I'm afraid something terrible has happened.""

""I heard arguing in the hallway, and Margaery came this way last I saw.""

""About that...""

""Stand aside."" Jaime did as he was told, begrudgingly.

The King and his guards walked past him and a started look dawned on Joffrey's face. ""Margaery!"" he squealed, and rushed down the hallway.

Jaime followed. Cersei was breathing heavily, and her blood-stained hands shaking uncontrollably. He didn't know if she was feigning shock, but he put a reassuring hand on her shoulder regardless. She was firm and rigid. *It'll be okay, sister.*

Joffrey knelt down to examine his bride's lifeless body. ""What have you done, mother?"" His voice was filled with contempt.

When Cersei didn't respond, Jaime spoke for her. ""Lady Margaery attacked your mother. She only acted out of self defense.""

""I didn't ask you, Uncle."" Joffrey stood up, fists clenched. There was anger in his eyes.

Jaime gave her a light squeeze on the shoulder and she finally broke out of her spell. ""We were arguing, and she came at me with a knife. We struggled and... I defended myself, just like your Uncle Jaime said.""

""LIES! I know you hated Margaery from the very moment you laid eyes on her."" Joffrey's face grew a bright red. He reached over, and unsheathed a sword from one of his guards. The look in his eyes was unmistakable - the look of someone who had just lost the very love of their life. The look of someone ready to exact vengeance for those who had done him harm.

She would never be forgiven. Margaery had won.

Jaime drew from the other knight's scabbard with his one good hand and lunged. The sword impaled the child's soft flesh. *What good was a son who would attempt to slay his mother?*

Cersei let out a blood-curling scream as Joffrey's sword struck the ground. He could feel the child's heartbeat slowing down.

Joffrey looked into his eyes and, with his last dying breath, muttered, ""Kingslayer."" His body became slack in Jaime's arms. Cersei's wail had turned into a heavy sob. The child he helped birth was no longer with this world.

And in that moment, he had become a kinslayer as well. *What good was a father who would kill his own son?* She would never forgive him. She couldn't.

*Oh the things I do for love.*",0,0,False,self,,,,,

There is no doubt in my mind (and I'm sure most will agree) that the Game of Thrones intro sequence is (if not the longest) one of the finest and cryptically detailed introductions to a program I have ever seen.

But I noticed something in Season 3, so I went searching to see if anyone else had noticed it also. There were a few sites dedicated to explaining the imagery and meaning behind the intro, like on here also but something seemed missing.

This description is from GoT Wiki -
_The title sequence consists of a three-dimensional map of the world, with the continents of Westeros and Essos located on the inner surface of a sphere. At the center of the sphere is a light source, effectively a sun surrounded by an astrolabe-like arrangement of rotating rings. The details of the title sequence change each week depending on the locations visited._

We also have the imagery meanings on the astrolabe explained, but what it seems has been overlooked, is that this sun seems to have become more predominant and appears more in the intro since season 2... Almost as if it was of some significance or even as if it were a character. A character that has _also_ become more predominant throughout the series... 

tl;dr I believe the _Sun_ in the intro actually represents R'hllor, the Lord of Light.

I am more than halfway through AFFC and would like to order ADWD on amazon along with a few other books to fill the gap between now and when Winds of Winter is released.

A few that caught my eye were the **Dunk and Egg** short stories that are set before the events of GOT, but there seems to be quite a few different versions and I don't know which to get.  Also, are they all graphic novels?  Because I have never been into those and I would prefer short story versions.

Other than that I am lost, there seems to be a bunch of backstory and universe related novels but unless it is written entirely by Martin I don't know if it's worth buying.  I would like to hear opinions on books that fall into that category as well.

Here are the final scores for the top 10 characters for the season. Bonus points were awarded democratically so don't blame me if you don't like the way it turned out!

1. Tywin Lannister, Bonus Points: +127, Season Total: +172
Clearly the most dominant character this season. 

2. Davos Seaworth, Bonus Points +44, Season Total: +59
For being the most moral character of the show, Davos gets mad props.

3. Arya Stark, Bonus Points +42, Season Total: +58
Who doesn't love a murderous teenage girl hellbent on revenge?

4. The Hound, Bonus Points: +41, Season Total: +55
The real outlaw of Season 3, The Hound has nothing to lose.

5. Roose Bolton, Bonus Points: +21, Season Total: +42
While treacherous, Roose probably made the best strategic decision possible to protect his own interests, and maybe the North as a whole.

6. Samwell Tarly, Bonus Points: +32, Season Total: +41
Dragonglass bitches!

6. Tyrion Lannister, Bonus Points: +37,  Season Total: +41
Seems like Tyrion is taking Varys advice and playing it low key this season. Can't wait to see him kick things up a notch. 

8. Olenna Redwyne, Bonus Points +4, Season Total: +38
The only character to stand up to Tywin.

9. Daenyrs Targaryen, Bonus Points -23, Season Total: 27
A lot of love hate for Dany. 

And the bottom 5: 

Craster, Bonus Points: -10, Season Total: -33
Nothing to say here, he is creepy as fuck.

Cat Stark, Bonus Points: -4, Season Total: -34
Poor Cat.

Robb Stark, Bonus Points: -20, Season Total: -50
Yep.

Joffrey Baratheon, Bonus Points: -42, Season Total: -51
He may be the king, but he sucks and everybody hates him. Except for maybe his mom. Go to bed now.

Theon Greyjoy, Bonus Points: -50, Season Total: -86
Dick in a box!

In the books, after Shae testifies against Tyrion and Sansa, I thought she was just a filthy harlot using Tyrion and generally being a jerk. In the show, however, there's a scene where Varys and Shae are in private, and Varys offers her a pouch of diamonds to use to sail to Pentos. She refuses and asserts that she loves Tyrion too much. She also says that she loves Sansa and would never harm her.

Is this just a simple matter of changed events for the TV show or am I missing something? I figured that it could be part of Shae's character that we just don't see in the books, as the show has added things like that before.",87,26,False,self,,,,,

 In the first book (and season), Varys and the small council are well informed as to what is going on with Daenerys (her being pregnant and what not).

My question is this - As of season 3, what does Tywin know about Dani, The Unsullied, the dragons and everything else?

I can see why Varys would withhold that information for the realm's interest, but is that the case?
What does Tywin know? 
Is he doing anything about any of it? Am I missing something?

If so, why did he still decide to make her his cupbearer, I mean, she could very well be a psycho serial killer that was given the choice execution or the wall. I wouldn't want one of those running around with knives and stuff in my office. Right?",15,0,False,self,,,,,

Little info on Kickstarter and the USPCC. To put an order in with the United States Playing Card Co. you need to order 2500 decks. With the cost of the cards, setup fees, and shipping, l might actually be losing money if I just hit my goal of $6500.

That's the thing with Kickstarter, though. I get $0 funding, unless the project gets fully funded, so even if you pledge now, you won't actually get 'charged' unless the goal is met. With a product such as playing cards... people want their cards, probably more so than helping me get on my feet as an entrepreneur. So, ideally, I'll get even more support after the goal is met, because the project is guaranteed to be funded.

I wouldn't call it a gamble... it's a calculated risk. This is a numbers game, though, and this needs as much exposure as possible. Even if you don't want to get in line to receive your custom deck of cards from a buddy, other people you know might. So if you could share this, tweet it, text it, email it... it would help out immensely!

The first question is why did Jaime join the kingsguard. At first the kingsguard just seems to be an elite organization, a cush job and a reason to be close to the king / cersei. But then when Tywin is ""negotiating"" with the Queen of Thorns he threatens to ""honor"" Loras with a position in the kingsguard, preventing him from being married, owning land or titles for life. In short it seems like the kingsguard is a vow thats closer to the night's watch than a cherished appointment. Something to send a second/third son to so you dont have to split up land or worry about a dispute over titles when the head of a house dies.

But here is the thing, unless I have missed something, Jaime is Tywin's oldest son, really with how he treats tyrion his only son, and chosen heir to castlery rock and all the lannister land/titles. Even if he knows that the baratheon children are really lannisters, they do not hold that name and it seems all tywin wants to do is keep his family name strong. The timing is odd too, Jaime joined the kingsguard under the mad king, so it wasnt to get close to cersei and I would think if Tywin wanted someone around to kill the mad king, he had other loyal men he could have sent off to the kingsguard.

Now for the related questions, unless there are other children i don't know about, tywin is placing the fate of his dynasty on one male child, a dwarf/imp and a female child (useless in keeping the name going). Has his plan always been for tyrion to father children, how does he know they wont end up with his ailment. It seems that a man so intent on keeping his name alive, and forcing his children into marriages, would of remarried after his wife's death but that doesnt seem to be the case.

So actually who is heir to castlery rock, when tyrion kills tywin, Jaime can't inherit lands, im sure the king could release him from his vows, however unusual that would be, but he also deserted and is moping around with one hand. I know there are some other lannisters around, the stupid one who was serving robert wine but he doesnt seem like he is really being groomed for leading a major house, ",39,6,False,self,,,,,

10521,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2013-6-23,2013,6,23,4,1gvbr7,self.gameofthrones,[All Spoilers/Theory] The best theory about Varys I have ever read,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1gvbr7/all_spoilerstheory_the_best_theory_about_varys_i/,AllegraGeller,1371929506,"The **""Varys is secretly a merman""** theory!  Behold:

&gt;1\. When Arya is stalking Varys and Illyrio:    
&gt;1a. She hears water dripping in the distance.    
&gt;1b. Next she observes Illyrio and Varys coming up from a vast 'well'(this is the word GRRM uses) that goes down out of sight.    
&gt;1c. Varys pulls a lever and a wall descends blocking the well from sight.    
&gt;1d. After the two come up, Arya trails them for quite a long distance, gradually descending.    
&gt;1e. Finally she loses them, stumbles forward and finds herself at the end of a sewer emptying into the river. She dives in and swims for a while to get clean, washes her clothes, then scampers off home.

&gt;2\. Varys and Illyrio are both noted for their abnormally large size, while also noted as being incredibly light on their feet. This suggests an abnormal strength.

&gt;3\. Varys is noted to have a peculiar, slimy smile. This could be interpreted to mean he does not show his teeth, and that could be because he has very abnormal teeth.

&gt;4\. When Tyrion threatened to throw Varys overboard, Varys retorted that he would be sursprised at the result.

&gt;5\. There is noted to be no bed in Vary's quarters. If he is a Merling he would likely sleep at sea or like most fish perhaps not at all.

&gt;6a. Another character we know with peculiar teeth is Biter, another abnormally large man with enourmous strength.    
&gt;6b. The idea that this barely sentient being sat around and filed all his teeth just to scare people is absurd.

&gt;7\. Varys and Illyrio both associate humans with birds, naturally as these are two lower species to them. Explains the ease with which they chop off children's tongues.

&gt;8\. From their one meeting, it appears that the Merlings are experts at manipulating the humans in secret. And also there is a hint these two have plenty of patience, they seem to be comfortable waiting years for their plans to bear fruit. Perhaps they have very long lifespans or are just more patient than humans.

&gt;9\. When the subject of eating people came up, Varys licked his lips.

&gt;10a. Varys likely is not a Eunuch, as there is a point where he is parlaying with Tyrion where Tyrion notes that his voice seemed deeper than usual.    
&gt;10b. Even if he is a Eunuch, it doesn't mean he has to be human.

&gt;12\. Since he probably isn't a Eunuch, Vary's lack of sexual interest in human females is explained by being a Merling.

&gt;13\. Littlefinger comes from a seafaring merchant family of Braavos and is an accomplished sailor himself, if anyone is likely to ever see the reclusive Merlings, it's the merchants and fisherman.

&gt;14\. One of Littlefinger's ships is named 'The Merling King'.

&gt;15\. Littlefinger claims to have Varys completely under his control.

&gt;16\. House Manderly. Hugely fat, port city, can't ride a horse, they even have a Merling as their house crest. Wyman Manderly bakes Freys into pies.

&gt;17\. With no readily apparent motivation, Ser Mandon Moore tried to murder Tyrion on the Blackwater. When thrown overboard, it is noted he did not scream.

&gt;18\. Mandon Moore is referred to repeatedly as having dead eyes or fish eyes, and of having ""no life but duty"".

&gt;19\. Before being attacked, Tyrion had just set Blackwater Bay on fire using wildfire which would be deadly to any creatures living underneath.

&gt;20\. The Drowned God. Very handy to have a large group of humans willing to do anything for you, and it provides a ready source of spies in places of power, such as Patchface, who often tells riddles about life under the sea.

&gt;21\. There is something more to Patchface, as he foretold the Red Wedding.

&gt;22\. Doesn't it seem suspicious that Euron Greyjoy was so well prepared for the Kingsmoot? Almost as though he knew that this ancient ritual for selecting a ruler would resurrected -- almost as if it was done specifically for him. Perhaps Euron has been playing his brother Aeron for a fool by filling his head with ""voices from the sea"".

&gt;23\. Davos Seaworth's visit from the ""The Mother"" may have actually been a siren or a mermaid. After his rescue, Davos was primed and determined to kill Melisandre. Like Aeron and Patchface, it seems Davos's drowning may have filled his head with ideas.

&gt;24\. Melisandre is afraid of Patchface.

&gt;25\. Brienne is told about 'squishers' by one of her companions. They are described as man eating fish people that walk on two feet.

&gt;26\. If you were to give a baby the name Varys in our world today, it would mean the following: Varys - Vari - Stream; Varish - Sleeping on the Sea

&gt;27\. ""The storms come and go, the waves crash overhead, the big fish eat the little fish, and I keep on paddling.""

&gt;28\. What do Varys and Illyrio want with Dragons? This is more speculative, but consider that:    
&gt;28a. When you bring Ice and Fire together, you get water.    
&gt;28b. Is it as simple as this? Bring the dragons north and melt the Ice, including perhaps the entire Wall. What you have done then is raise the coastlines around the entire world. Magical global melting...    
&gt;What do the merlings get out of it? Liebensraum. More ocean real estate.    
&gt;28c. If the flooding were extreme enough, only a few islands would remain, places like the Eyrie.    
&gt;28d. Littlefinger, ""The Merling King"", has made his seat the Eyrie.    
&gt;28e. If this theory is correct, Littlefinger would have been made King by Merlings, giving a new take on the meaning to the ship's name.

I believe Ramsay ~~Bolton~~ Snow is a shadow of Roose Bolton, the only difference is that Roose knows how to control his sadistic urges while its evident that Ramsay does not. Although, I dont think Roose is quite as sadistic as Ramsay, I do believe he has an unhealthy enthusiasm or passion for violence. 

I think Tywin and Tyrion Lannister are quite similar in regards to their way of critical thinking and efficient, pragmatic ruling style. 

I also imagine the young Ned Stark behaving very similar to Jon Snow. It's clear how Jon's views on honor and the importance of keeping your word are analogous to Ned's as time goes on in the series. I would even argue that Jon behaves more like Ned than Robb and Bran.

However, one could argue that Theon Greyjoy is a character foil of his father, Balon Greyjoy. Theon so desperately wanted to be this emotionless, detached son but he found it was impossible for him to achieve. 

Im curious if anyone has any thoughts on this subject.

The popular speculation going around is that there are three dragons, and as the old days go each of the dragons would need a rider. Some believe that among the rider candidates are [Speculation](#g ""Jon ""Targaryen"" and Daenerys Targaryen"") 

If such tedency stays consistent and [Speculation](#g ""Jon snow really turns out to be Jon Targaryen""), it seems that a most likely candidate for the third rider would be a [Speculation](#g ""Targaryen"") aswell. So onto Shae. I've been watching the show again the second time around as Season 3 has ended and I've picked up a small subtlety.

In S01E09 there is a scene with Tyrion, Bronn, and Shae where they are fooling around with games. Before they start Tyrion's game of truths we see that Tyrion has to withdraw from the flame because it is too painful (their previous game of putting fire on one's arm.) Tyrion remarks something along the lines of ""Damn woman are you immune to pain"" while she replies ""Just used to it"". 

Or does this immunity to fire speak to some other truth? While the possibility of her being a TRUE Targaryen seems to be out of the question as I'm sure they would have been better tracked. But perhaps she is a half blooded Targaryen sent to live in another land? Her remarks seem to imply that she is of noble birth. Her foreign accent can be explained by the fact that she was either sent away at birth to live in a foreign land or otherwise grew up in that foreign land.

Whilst this isn't the most important of theories, and I've only ever seen the show to provide any basis (and going off such small details) this scene has intrigued me. I'm not sure if Shae would make the best dragon rider, but hey who knows

Also if I haven't properly put a spoiler tag around something please let me know!

EDIT: It seems to come to my attention two things. The first being that GRRM has confirmed that they aren't IMMUNE to fire, but it seems Dany must have some resistance to fire because of two earlier scene (hottub/egg). The second being that perhaps this link is relevant to the fact that she is a woman (Shae is too), we haven't seen an example of a woman Targaryen getting harmed by fire yet.",57,23,False,self,,,,,

The Brotherhood may feature a bit more in coming seasons than they do in the books. Paul Kaye's Thoros is a bit of a fan favorite, and we have some possibilities for some chilling scenes with Stoneheart. If Gendry needs to end up back with the Brotherhood for the story, we can have an arc written in for his character. I don't think he'll disappear, considering Joe Dempsie was promoted to Starring cast this season.

first id like to start off by saying what ive been spoilered with basically every Main Character that dies [example:](#b ""like the Hound and John Snow or Joffrey "").

Either through 4chan or CounterStrike (thanks random stranger with that magnificent Name!!)

I simply cannot forget something like this.
Ive even been spoiled about the Red Wedding 1 Day beforehand through the Internet and random reading through online forums that weren't even remotly thematically close to GoT.

The Question is, should i even care to continue watching the Series (i dont have time to read the Books - thats a no for me, except they are **very** rewarding and i really set time aside in the future...but normally id say i dont have time)

Ive also heard that the ending is very disappointing in the Books (but nothing more, so please dont spoiler this)
[parenthesis: as far as i know the books have not ended yet but i really dont get that, english is not my main language and i get confused very fast ;) ]

So my Questions are:

a) should i continue watching the Series even though basically there is nothing to ""discover"" anymore

b) or take the Time to read the Books? (even though i have very few spare time and as you guys say all the time ""everyone you like dies""

c) or spoil myself deliberately so that i dont watch the series anymore :D

Ive also been spoiled about something in BioshockInfinite and that was 1 Week after release - and i still remember it - so ""simply forgetting"" is not an option.

hope you have some advice,
thanks",8,0,False,default,,,,,

How to write like Game of Thrones:

Take one part honourable guy trying to do the right thing.  The honourable guys attempt to do the right thing will have unbelievably tragic consequences.  Honourable guy is always too stupid to realize the obvious tragic consequences that will result for him, his family and his friends.  Kill honourable guy, replace with next honourable guy.

Take one part great and stupid evil person.  This great and stupid evil person can be any age, but they must be unbelievably stupid and unbelievably evil.  They will act in ways that no human being would act, both in terms of doing things that are incredibly evil and incredibly stupid.  Kill great and stupid evil person, replace with next great and stupid evil person.

Take one part, the puppeteer behind it all.  This will be the real power behind everything.  Hes the real bad guy, but the readers and viewers dont hate him that much because they wasted all their  energy on hating the great and stupid evil person.  Kill puppeteer behind it all, replace with next puppeteer behind it all.

Take one part, ambiguity on who is the hero.  This will keep the readers guessing and make them think you are a great writer.  Reveal as little as possible about multiple different characters, but allude that any of them could be the hero while at the same time wasting hundreds of pages describing their affairs.  These affairs must have nothing to do with the main storyline and if you can make the reader forget that there even is a main storyline, then you have done your job.  Kill ambiguous hero, replace with next ambiguous hero.

Mix these four parts and write a book once every five years.  Initially you must claim that you are going to write a trilogy.  Once the money starts rolling in, claim that it is now a seven book series (hey it worked for JK Rowling).  Get HBO to make a series out of your books, but make sure you have only written five books so far.  By the time HBO is on its third season, ensure that there will be at least six more years before the last book comes out.  Leave all readers and viewers clueless about how this is actually going to work.  Congratulations, you have successfully completed the Game of Thrones formula.

http://youtu.be/U1-zz9GL_Ug?t=3m19s

It could be wish fulfillment and reading too much into the subtext, but perhaps Tywin looked upset after voicing his wish to commit infanticide when Tyrion was born -- it's not always that Tywin walks out of any room first, let alone his own, seemingly overcome with emotion (I can't recall this ever happening in the series -- he's rock steady so far as I can recall)... Charles Dance's chose for Tywin to speak the confession with a voice that was shaking a bit.

http://youtu.be/G99YcTJc0iA?t=2m55s

Perhaps there's conflicting recent internal pride that his youngest son is acting worthy of the Lannister name and shame at the hateful way Tywin has treated Tyrion in the past (i.e. the horrible ""lesson"" about Tyrion's first wife); contrasted against long term shame and embarrassment concerning Tyrion's size and behaviour combined with hatred for Tyrion being the cause of Tywin's wife's death?

I'd love a deathbed stoic roundabout apology by Tywin followed by a merciful understanding, but unforgiving throat-slitting done by Tyrion to which Tywin kind of looks at peace because he knows he has it coming.  Tyrion would say, ""For [insert name of prostitute wife here].""  

Tywin gurgling blood but with tired quizzical eyes.  

""My first wife.  That was her name and I loved her.""  

Tywin nods in quiet understanding, holds Tyrion's hand says gently, ""I'm glad I did not do the same"" and then *death rattle*.  Tywin sits quietly, then cries.",28,4,False,self,,,,,

So, this is going to seem like a strange request, but here goes. I'm working on a special present for a friend of mine - basically, a re-edit of the first three seasons of Game of Thrones to just focus exclusively on Daenerys' story.

Since I've not really watched the show, if you were to summarize her story in a non-spoiler fashion over the first three season for the back of a DVD box, how would you write it?

I appreciate any help anyone can get! Self post, of course, because I don't care about karma in this situation. Thank you all in advance!",15,12,False,self,,,,,

However, Ive noticed that some people, (particularly non-book readers) have posted very fair questions regarding the show or the series and are, in turn, downvoted to oblivion. 

I dont understand the rational in this. Isnt this a sub that's meant to discuss all aspects of GoT? Doesnt every question warrant an answer? It's discouraging to automatically downvote a self post when someone is asking for clarification on the show.

I dont understand how tired memes that have been reposted to death are upvoted, when self posts that inspire a thought provoking dialogue are downvoted.

Perhaps instead of automatically downvoting a self post because we know the answer to the OPs question or because the OP sounds ignorant of GRRMs works we should just ignore the post rather than downvoting it and ensuring that no one gets a chance to read it.

In episode two of the second season why is Jon sharpening [Longclaw](http://i.imgur.com/OLzL5Ol.jpg)? I thought that valyrian steel was already incredibly sharp and I am curious if a normal sword sharpening stone would even sharpen valyrian steel? Unless Mormont possessed a stone that could ~~hone~~ sharpen their ancestral sword?

edit of the edit: It is hard for me to tell whether he is trying to sharpen or hone the sword. Hopefully someone can enlighten me on which he is attempting to do in that segment? He starts the stone at the middle of the blade and slides it straight across the blade. It would make sense for him to hone the sword since it may still get nicked and whatnot from use and if he is sharpening it it may be out of habit or the fact that he just wants to be sure his blade is in the best shape it can be. A sword can never be too sharp, I guess.

And thank you to /u/bsavery for pointing out the difference between sharpening and honing, I was stupidly using the words interchangeably.

Its probably pretty bad, but figured some people may enjoy it.

After reading the casting ideas i really fell in love with the idea of Henry Cavill as Ned, Chris Hemsworth as Robert, and Jason Isaacs as the Mad King. So i tried to imagine what i film with them in the roles would be like. Somehow, the idea for the TRAILER for that movie/series came into my head instead. In it, Mark Addy reprises his role as older Robert Baratheon. 

Unfortunately, you will have to imagine the background music for yourself, slowly building from beginning to end. I imagined it as a very short trailer, thats very quick and emotion-driven, building in intensity. Perfect for a teaser trailer.

""How could you? Robert asks softly, yet with a tinge of anger, hinting that he may have been drinking
""You were barely there!"" he says a bit louder, shifting his eyes toward Jamie at Jamie, then back into a blank look, thinking.
""I remember it all too well. Its all ive thought about for 17 years.""
-Cut back to Roberts eyes. He closes them

""Seven hells, that was a good war!"" he says loudly, yet one can hear a sting of regret in his voice.
-Cut to older Robert's eyes again. He appears to be trembling, attempting to hold back an incomprehensible rage. His fury can be seen in his eyes, alongside the onset of tears.

Thanks to my roomie I've been hooked on this series since spring. There was this post about an OP's confused friends who were watching the show and made this sheet to help them that the OP found the next day. The sheet was hysterical to me as a newbie at the time and it was this chart of characters that they made and all the names were wrong (like Sissy instead of Cersei)
Anyways, at the time we died laughing and I've spent all night looking for it since now I've seen all the episodes and am deep into book 1.

I'm not sure if this is shunned or anything, I didn't see it on the rules, but does anyone know of what I'm talking about? Yes I know this subreddit is huge, but this would be front page material and was probably posted in March or April, we would browse the first page or two together.

Anyways, if the OP happens to see this, or someone remembers/bookmarked it or something I would love the link. It's probably a silly request but I thought it was worth a shot.

I look forward to posting more with you all since I am now so addicted to the show and I feel fairly educated about it.",1,7,False,self,,,,,

 I didn't pay much attention to those in the cage when Arya and Gendry are heading North to the Wall. So when Arya saved them, the 2 rapists and Jaqen I thought ""what of it"". Anyway so later we are greeted with the great surprise that Jaqen is from Braavos and he's a faceless-man etc.

The circumstances of Lord Rickard and Brandon Stark's executions, for example, is never really explained fully in the TV series but is incredibly disturbing when revealed fully in the books. 

The one downside would be that we all know how it would end, but still would make extremely compelling television, and would be a no-brainer for HBO in the event of the series catching up to the books, or a new GOT property to produce once the series is over.

Apologies if this has already been discussed many times. I imagine it probably has, but I'm so captivated by the whole world of Westeros right now that I wanted to hear some other thoughts.

Animating three 40-50 foot dragons in CGI could easily double or triple the budget of the show and make post-production take much longer.

I'm thinking they might try theme park-like animatronics or something and build mechanical dragons.  How do you guys think HBO is going to handle the issue?",14,4,False,self,,,,,

Do you read both English and your own language versions or maybe patiently wait for translations?

In Finnish version almost everything that means something has been translated. Names like Snow, Stormborn, Black Walder are all translated, but the official surnames like Greyjoy are left. Mostly the translation is done smoothly but some names like Hot Pie, Rattleshirt etc are somewhat horrible.

I found the name Mirri Maz Duur hilarious since Mirri could be translated to pussy which expands the meaning of name so much. Also Shavepates make me me roll eyes since Pate is a common male nickname here so in my head it sounds like Shaved Ricks or Mikes. We don't have translation for ADWD yet so no idea how it will be in final Finnish form.

Some of it is obvious like Jon Snow's albino white wolf stands apart from the others because he's a bastard. He doesn't howl because in the game of thrones, Jon Snow has no voice. I also realized that his wolf is always striking out on its own, but he always comes back at opportune times. Sort of the way [ASOS](#b ""Jon Snow left the watch and joined the wildlings and then returned when he was needed to defend the wall from their attack""). 

[AGOT](#b ""Sansa lost her wolf when she betrayed her sister for Joffrey. Ever since then, she hasn't really been a Stark. She no longer wanted to be a stark and when she lost her wolf, she got her wish. I guess more than just her wolf died that day."") 

[AGOT](#b ""After being betrayed, Arya's wolf was forced to run away, thus separating her from the pack. Looking back, we can see the obvious foreshadowing this event implies."") [ASOS](#b ""Just like Arya, the wolf is lost. Martin hints at the wolf's activities by talking about roving bands of wolves terrorizing farms. I even thought they might be re-united a time or two just like when Arya is traveling with the Hound and is almost reunited with her brother and mother. Arya is lost; just like her wolf."")

The rest of the connections are not as deep, but I'll list them quickly anyhow. I would appreciate any additional thoughts. 

[ASOS](#b ""Robb's wolf was fearsome in battle and lost his life along with Robb when they were betrayed by the Frey."")

Bran's wolf is a tool that Martin uses early on to hint at the possibility that [ASOS](#b ""Bran is a Warg""). [AGOT](#b ""He even climbed like Bran in order to come to his rescue."")

Rickon's wolf is wild like him. Can't think of anything else specific really.

He of course started out as a bully, but Arya and Gendry quickly put an end to that. Since then, he's been a bit of an oaf, but all in all, he's not a bad person by any means. 

Still, the way some people talk about Hot Pie on this thread, it's like he's Crabbe/Goyle from Harry Potter; a gluttonous bully just looking to walk over people. Thing is, Hot Pie is an orphan boy from King's Landing; his childhood was probably bleak and devoid of any real happiness (unlike Arya's) and we don't even know if he even had a mother or father figure in his childhood. When you're brought up in Flea Bottom, you're treated like scum, and you have to fight for the scraps just to survive. It's not surprising he turned out the way he did, but him baking a loaf for Arya when he stayed at the Inn shows he's still a good person on the inside.
