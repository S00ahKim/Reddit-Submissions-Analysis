Mostly I have left such comments to others with more acute memories for the fine details of GRRM's original story.

But there's an aspect to the show we are still only beginning to consider, entirely beyond the books, and that is the musical soundtrack. We've had some love for the GoT theme and opening title sequences, and especially for the [heavy version](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GC-ZmlwBWKM) that I hope is considered for next season's openings.

*I'll present the news first, before I go further off into my own speculation:*

I've been watching the soundtrack's sparse [Amazon page](http://www.amazon.com/Game-Thrones-Ramin-Djawadi/dp/B004ZQRETK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1306891978&amp;sr=8-1) hoping to be the first to announce they've finally got 30-second clips to listen to. Unfortunately we do not have that yet, but elsewhere we *do* finally have a track list. The label *Varse Sarabande* has a page for the [Game of Thrones soundtrack](http://www.varesesarabande.com/servlet/the-777/Game-Of-Thrones/Detail) that lists 29 song titles, that I know many of you will peruse with great interest. (Personally, I get so caught up in the story I have not noticed anywhere near that number of tunes playing during the show. But though a fan of the soundtrack, I'm not sufficiently skilled at music for that to really register on me anyway.) When the audio clips are available I'll come back and say so... or I'll happily go listen if someone else gets it up first.

(Let me take a moment here to bring up a point of Reddiquette, which is that we should not promote commercial products in our posts. I'm considering my implied promotion of the soundtrack to be as permissible as all the times we say *get the books and read them!* I get my internet connection through Comcast. I do not have cable TV service and do not want it. I certainly don't want to pay to get a hundred channels so I can pay to get all of HBO so I can get one television show that I do want. We've talked of this at length; here's one of the ways for some of us to show our support. I do not profit from this in any way except our shared fun.)

*Now back to ""Musical Thrones Part II"":*

[In my original thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/he44v/musical_thrones/) I called attention to two tunes given special prominence: those playing over the closing credits of episodes three, four and five. Bringing that up to date...

**Episode 1:** Bran goes down. *The GoT theme plays over the credits.*

**Episode 2:** Bran comes up. *The GoT theme repeats.*

**Episode 3:** Arya's dancing lesson. *A different tune plays over the credits.*

**Episode 4:** Cat at the inn. *Another new tune, this one slow, simple and haunting.*

**Episode 5:** Ned in the street. *The tune from #4 repeats.*

Since then:

**Episode 6:** Viserys gets honored. *The GoT theme repeats.*

**Episode 7:** Littlefinger tells the truth. *The GoT theme repeats.*

Since the original post, it increasingly looks like the closing credits tunes for episode three and then for episodes four and five really were something out of the ordinary. The tune for four and five I previously said might be our first variation on *The Rains of Castamere*. The tune used at the end of three is really more interesting though. It's a strange tune that *maybe* ties in with the strangeness ahead for Arya.

So... am I off on my own with this? or is the soundtrack also entrancing others? Mad speculation is not only welcome but gleefully encouraged.",0,6,False,self,,,,,

Bran is in bed, comatose.  She was so much meaner, telling him to leave right away, multiple times, threatening to call the guards, and finally telling him that it should have been him.)

I think that was a really important piece of dialogue that really shows how much she hates him.  I mean I know she disliked him a lot but I didn't get the same feeling I got in the book.

Poor little Rickon gives chase through the meadow, past a village, over hill and dale, past rivers and streams and finally into a cave. Knowing full well that it could be dangerous, Rickon goes back past the rivers, past the streams, over both hill and dale and into the village to ask for assistance.

He enters a tavern and says the men there, ""I'd like someone's help in recovering my dog."" Immediately three men leap up to do the job. So, in order to determine who is best-suited to help him, Rickon organizes a series of contests, the winner of which will help him recover his wolf from the cave. For the first contest, Rickon has the men wrestle in a triple-elimination round-robin tournament. In the first match-up, Eldrin beat Trake. Trake then lost to Ren putting him decidedly ""on the ropes."" Ren and Eldrin then wrestled for three hours with neither man giving in. It was eventually determined that relying on submission would not work so Rickon, with the help of an elder, developed a point system by which a victor could be determined in instances where a fight lasting more than 5 minutes could be called in favor of one combatant or another. Next was the task of training judges to officiate the fights. The elder recommended Bentry the bartender since he was such a well-respected man. But someone informed them that Bentry had fallen ill with superating purple lesions and Rickon, recognizing that it was quite serious, set off to the market to purchase a salve to hopefully draw the sickness out of poor Bentry.

Unable to get a fair price on salves, Rickon (always shrewd in matters of business) decides to vist the neighboring village where we was pleased to find the salve readily available at half the price. Upon his return, Rickon administers the salve and Bentry improves. Everyone thanks Rickon for saving teh beloved bartender and the contest continues. Eldrin and Ren again wrestle with no clear winner and so, after 5 minutes, the fight is called and, after consulting the scoring rubric, Bentry declares Ren the victor. Now Ren must wrestle Trake again. Whether it was fear of elimination or the new rules, nobody could say but Trake beat Ren on points and, after losing again to Eldrin, Ren was eliminated. Now Trake and Eldrin had to face off to see who was truly the most worthy. Trake, employing a strategy that maximized points while minimizing his exposure defeated the bigger and stronger Eldrin by a wide spread. But this was only Eldrin's second loss so Trake and Eldrin had to wrestle one final time. Again, Trake took a strategy to maximize points but just as time was expiring, Bentry collapsed to the floor; his lesions were back. Suddenly, Rickon realized why the salve had been half the price: it was only half as potent. Fortunately, had bought two salves (it had seemed foolish to pass up such a good deal!) and so, applying the second, Bentry was cured for good.

In the confusion, everyone had forgotten about the combatants! When Rickon, the elder and Bentry turned back to the ring, they saw that both Eldrin and Trake were dead; choked to death by each other. Thus, Rickon was left with no option but to take Ren with him on his quest. As he was leaving the tavern however, Bentry called after him and said, ""since you saved my life, I would be honored if you'd allow me to come with you!"" Rickon agreed and so the three of them set off past rivers, past streams, over hill and over dale to the mouth of the cave where Rickon had last seen his wolf. Ren, who always came prepared, produced three torches and led the way into the cave. Before they have take a dozen steps however, the floor gives way beneath their feet and they fall into a deep pit. Ren, who fell first, broke his neck and died instantly. Rickon and Bentry landed on top of him and, while injured, were at least still alive.

For days they tried to find a way out of the pit but it was no use. It was too steep and too smooth to climb. The walls were too hard to dig into. While some water seeped in through a crack in one of the walls, there was nothing to eat in the stony hole and the two became hungrier and hungrier. Eventually they decided they would have to eat poor Ren. Taking a knife out of Ren's pack (he was always prepared), they butchered him and subsisted on his flesh for nearly two weeks. Then, just as Rickon began to lose hope that they would ever leave their stony prison, he heard a sound at the top of the pit. It was his wolf! Hatching a plan, Rickon told the wolf ""sing boy!"" (a trick he had developed in order to annoy his innumerable greasy-haired siblings) and the wolf began to howl. It howled long and it howled loud. Its howls carried past streams and its howls carried past rivers. Its howl carried over hill and its howl carried over dale. The howl eventually reached the small village that was Bentry's home and was heard by the elder.

Recalling that Bentry, Ren and Rickon had gone out searching for a wolf, the elder followed the sound. He followed the sound past rivers and past streams. He followed the sound over hill and over dale until he came to a cave where he found a wolf. Always, protective of his master, the howl turned to a snarl as the old man approached. The elder called out ""Rickon, are you nearby?"" and Rickon replied, ""Yes, we in a hole in the cave! That's my wolf up there! He's just being protective. Try to make friends with him!""

""Okay,"" the elder said, ""what's the wolf's name?""
""Shaggy Dog""
""Shaggy Dog?"" said the elder, ""He doesn't look that shaggy to--""
But, in that instant, the wolf pounced and ripped out the elder's throat. He devoured the old man and took a nap. Bentry died later that afternoon and Rickon the next morning.",2,2,False,self,,,,,

[spoilers for those who haven't read the first book],https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/hqs22/its_good_to_be_the_imp_spoilers_for_those_who/,[deleted],1307109480,"I just finished the first book, and I have but one question:

**Why in the world would anyone *want* to be king?**

(Or: ""It's good to be the imp!"")

The new king is a psycho brat, who is fairly miserable himself, and I have suspicions that his mother (who is trying to pull the strings) [Book Speculation](/? ""will be miserable as the queen behind the king."")  And I imagine [Book Speculation](/? ""that he'll be killed at some point. I can't imagine him surviving through three or more books."")  (I have them on order; I'll know soon enough.)

The previous king Robert hated being king, and just wanted to whore and drink his way around.  Which is what many do, so why not just do what you want?  If you want to whore around without responsibility, go do that.  If you just want to tend to your own territory and house like Ned, go do that.  Did Robert really *want* to be king at some point in the distant past?  In any case, *he* ended up fat, miserable, and eventually, being poisoned by his wife and then killed by a pig.

The king before hated being king so much he apparently went mad. And *he* was killed.

Now there are three people vying for the throne.  The two brothers of Robert and Robb.  I can only imagine that [Book Speculation](/? ""at least two or three of them will *have* to be killed at some point."")  

At least three previous, miserable kings, all [Book Speculation](/? ""killed or about to be killed."")  Who wants this job?  Why?  Ego?  What are the perks?  What can you get as king (wealth, whores, etc.) that you cannot already get as a lord/nobleman?  Can't these people see what happens to the previous kings?

And is having a king really even necessary for the stability of the Seven Kingdoms? Seems like having a king (or people vying to be king) just screws everything up, gets people killed, and starts wars.

This is not a Mel Brooks film; it is *not* good to be the king.

Tyrion is lucky he was born an imp; he is denied nothing he wants (except his father's respect) and what other things he is denied are things no one should want.  Tyrion travels, reads, drinks, fucks and eats.  It's good to be the imp!

(spoilers?)",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/hr6wg/why_is_the_realm_called_the_seven_kingdoms_when/,amdesch,1307148854,"**Disclaimer:** I'm about halfway through ASoS at this point (I just got past [Book Spoiler](/b ""The Red Wedding"") ) so *please* tag anything spoiler-y past that point.

So, it's entirely possible that I missed the explanation, but it seems to me that Westeros south of the wall should be called ""The Eight Kingdoms"", if anything. As far as the major houses go (excluding Targaryen of course), you've got:

* House Stark from the North
* House Greyjoy from the Iron Islands
* House Tully from the Riverlands
* House Arryn from the Vale
* House Lannister from the West
* House Baratheon from the Stormlands
* House Tyrell from the Reach
* House Martell from Dorne

...and that makes eight houses. So, why only seven kingdoms?


**Edit:** Okay, I see. Because the Greyjoys were in control of the Riverlands when Aegon the Conqueror arrived, the riverlands and iron islands are considered to be one kingdom. 

I guess that does make more sense than my idea: I was thinking for some reason that Dorne might not be included in the count of seven because it wasn't incorporated into the realm until the reign of Daeron II nearly 200 years later. ",10,8,False,self,,,,,

I was reading the non book readers speculation thread just now, and enjoying it thoroughly. It got me to thinking about the next episode of GoT, and how we'll be building up to it.

WARNING MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD

Well, not spoilers really, but this bit is only for people who have read the book, and I strongly recommend you to stop reading here if you haven't. 


Seriously.


Ok. We all know how ""Baelor"" is going to end. There's only one way it can end, really. Its a pretty shocking moment, to say the least, and it had a big effect on me when I read the books. As it did on all of us I'm sure.

What I'm worried about is not ""spoilers"" per se. We have a system for that, and it seems to work fine. What I'm worried about is the constant ""you'll never believe what happens"" type commentary that we're likely to see as episode 9 draws closer. 

Basically, if every second post and comment references some shocking twist at the end of the episode, people will quickly conclude its a [Book Spoiler](/b ""death of a major character""), and once we get to that point you-know-who is at the top of a fairly short list of likely candidates.

Because I've already been ""spoiled"" as it were, the main event won't be a surprise to me, and a big part of the fun will be seeing the reaction of fans of the show who haven't gotten to that point in the book. 

In other words, I want to enjoy the weeping and gnashing of teeth of unsuspecting fans who thought they were enjoying a fairly standard fantasy story. I want to see posts in all caps, rage comics, elaborate escape theories (assuming we cut away at the last moment) and all the other stuff reddit does so well, as the unsuspecting masses adjust to a new, harsher worldview.

And also, tv show fans deserve that sickening shock just as much as we did.

So lets keep that in mind in the days to come, shall we?

These are one of the most important parts of this subreddit and can be very effective, but they need to be used correctly. Everyone should know what they can safely read, and what they can't. Currently, it seems like people (rarely) use TV spoilers to cover upcoming events in the series, book spoilers to cover all the books (including GoT) and speculation spoilers correctly. That means TV spoilers are basically filling the same role as book spoilers, which doesn't make sense.

In this subreddit we have a small but significant number of people who have picked up the TV show partway through, or haven't yet seen the latest episode. These people should be protected from spoilers within the show, i.e. **TV spoilers are used to cover things which have *already* happened in the show.** This means that anyone who has watched the latest episode knows they can safely hover over a black spoiler. Using them any other way seems illogical to me.

Then we have people who are up to date on the show, but haven't read the books. Book spoilers are a complete no-go for these guys (hence why **you should not use a book spoiler for events that have already happened in the show**; you're needlessly blocking them out). We also have those who are partway through the books; you can help out that group of readers by marking your spoilers - it doesn't take much effort to write (Book 1) or (Book 4).

As I said, speculation spoilers are apparently being used correctly already. But to reiterate: **If it isn't stated or made obvious in the books, it should have a green tag.**

One final note, that I read over in /r/asoiaf: **Don't tease people.** For example, writing:
&gt;""I was really amazed when [TV](/s ""Bran fell""), why would [TV](/s ""Jaime"") do that?""

gives no useful information at all without hovering over the spoilers. Just tag the entire sentence.

Finally, making untagged puns, jokes and hints about things to come is simply not acceptable. You might think you're clever and subtle, but you really aren't. Someone is bound to make the connection, and even if it's not confirmed to them, you've reduced the level of surprise.



Rant over. I think my tone was a bit dictating there, and obviously let me know if you disagree with any of the above. It's just that I hate to see the hard work our mods put into spoiler tags being wasted through inefficient/ineffective use.",27,24,False,self,,,,,

Here are some ways through which the story's been spoiled for some:

* That know-it-all jerk who wants to ruin the story for others: eg. 'Snape kills Dumbledore' fiasco

* Improperly marked spoilers: eg. [Book Spoiler](/b ""Dany is a 

shemale! Also, you cannot insert paragraphs into a spoiler!"")

* Unintentional slip of the tongue: eg. Talking about a character (eg. [these minor characters](/s ""Lady, Jory"")) in the past tense.

* Replying to TV-follower's comment with something like, ""Oh you naive little thing, you have no idea, do you?"". Telling someone ""what *isn't* going to happen"" is a spoiler too!

* Intentionally dropping tantalizing hints in open-text that are borderline spoilers (if read correctly).

* Accidental mouse hover on a small piece of spoiler: eg. Direwolves love [Book Spoiler](/b ""chocolate"")

* The TV-follower's own inability to resist the temptation, and subsequent regret. (nothing we can do about it).

For all these above reasons, I suggest that the TV-followers stay away from the comments section of this subreddit for the next two weeks.

Most of all, the idiocy towards the end when Khal Drogo gets wounded.  It seems pretty obvious that there is going to be some deception on the part of the woman who claims to be able to heal his wound.  The whole thing seemed horribly contrived in order to get rid of Drogo (I haven't read the books, so just guessing) and leave Danaerys on her own to lead the Dothraki.  There is all sorts of hinting that she is acting like a ""true queen"" and that she and her son will be the ones to lead the Dothraki to victory.

Anyways, that scene bothered me because: 1) the wound was hardly serious or life threatening, 2) the Dothraki are a warlike people and would no doubt have their own surgeons / field medics, 3) the witch would have every reason to take the opportunity to hurt / poison Drogo, 4) Drogo is the king!  Everyone and their grandmother would keep the enemy witch from the king, Danaerys especially.  Heck, there was just an attempt made on her life with poison!  Everything about the scene seemed artificial, and if it does indeed kill off Drogo in such a contrived way, I will be really disappointed.

Please follow the guidelines below to insure everyone has a good time here and enjoys the TV show and book series to the fullest.

**About Spoilers in this Subreddit**

This is not a 100% spoiler-free community; this is a spoiler-light community.  Sometimes people post spoilers without warning, and then those posts get removed through moderation.  Moderation sometimes happens seconds later, but sometimes it can be hours later.  Not all spoilers are reported, and the mods are human.  So do not expect a 100% spoiler-free environment; that is not possible to achieve with open posting like Reddit.  


----
**What is a Spoiler?**

Opinions differ on what exactly is a real spoiler, but for the purposes of clarity, the following descriptions use ""not a spoiler"" to mean ""not a spoiler moderated in /r/gameofthrones.""  This is not meant to define what a spoiler is to you, only to describe what types of spoilers are moderated here.

Spoiler moderation for /r/gameofthrones is limited to ""events from the show or books.""  That basically means anything that ""happens"" in the series is spoiler information.  Things that simply ""exist"" in some form at the beginning of series are not spoilers, but changes to something during the course of the series are spoilers.  Very early story events that are ""setup"" for the rest of the series (like Starks getting direwolf pets) are considered established ""setting"" information that is not a spoiler.  Some examples:

* **Not Spoiler | Spoiler**
* Saying a character is a hero/villain/badass/jerk  **|**  Describing a character's heroic/evil/awesome/lame deeds
* Saying a character is handsome  **|**  Saying a character is now ugly due to an injury during the series
* ""Let's talk about Hodor in book 8""  **|**  ""Let's talk about Hodor's death in book 8""
* ""I wish Dany and Hodor would marry!""  **|**  ""Dany and Hodor get married!""
* The Starks have direwolf pets  **|**  [ ](/s ""The orphaned wolves' mother was killed by a stag"")
* Lannisters are incestuous like Targaryens  **|**  [ ](/b ""Cersei and Jamie go at it in a Winterfell tower"")
* Jon Snow is a bastard  **|**  [ ](/g ""Maybe he has two highborn parents?"")

Spoilers need warning.  That means don't put spoilers in your post's title.  If you're linking to an image, check the thumbnail to be sure it's not a spoiler.  If you're writing a tag cover, check it to be sure it's done right and actually works.  If you're posting from a browser that doesn't allow tag links, don't post any spoilers.  And refrain from teasing with spoilers like: *""I can't believe that [ ](/b ""direwolves"") really did [ ](/b ""exist in history"")! Can you believe it?""* Cover the complete thought, not little bits of it.

The spoiler warning in a post title has scope.  For example, if a title says ""ASOS spoilers,"" then the warning covers book information through ASOS, and those events do not need cover tags, but spoiler events from later books do need warning tags.  A title with only ""spoilers"" may contain information from any episode or book.  Be aware of the warning scope with each post.  There are ""minor"" and ""major"" spoilers but there are never ""possible"" or ""somewhat"" spoilers.  Waffling on a warning likely means the warning will not be good enough.

Jokes that pretend to be a spoiler may also require tags if they are explicit enough to be taken seriously by some people.  Revealing the joke may result in a reverse-spoiler, and even without confirmation such posts tend to cause a lot of drama.  So if you're posting a joke like that just use a spoiler tag to cover the joke to prevent confusion.

----
**What is Speculation?**

Speculation spoilers are detailed theories regarding information that has not yet been revealed in the published books or broadcast episodes.  Examples of speculation that always needs a speculation warning/tag includes:

* The true secret heritage of any character, including talk of different what-if parents for a character and any formulas: A+B=C.
* The surprise return of any character thought to be dead for whatever reason.
* The meaning of any prophecies that have not yet been revealed.

Minor speculation may be included under a regular spoiler tag while talking about other event details, but major speculation like the above is considered ""more spoiler"" than regular events and must be under separate speculation tags.

When posting speculation-specific threads, using ""spoilers"" is not enough.  By default that means only published/produced information.  Speculation threads need ""speculation"" explicitly stated in the title or posts inside the thread will need tag covers.


----
**What is not a Spoiler?**

There are exceptions to the above ""events"" rule.  Some types of information consistently contain spoilers and are automatically considered ""view at your own risk.""  You need to be aware of what to expect and where a link may take you.  The non-moderated expect-spoilers content includes: reviews, previews, interviews, casting articles, behind-the-scenes show information, obvious parodies, maps, photos of book pages, videos or songs of any kind, and sites that have open comments below the posted content (like YouTube and Facebook). 

References to common event types like weddings and battles with a location are allowed as long as any details about a given event are not mentioned. For example you can post a thread title with ""Battle of the Blackwater"" or ""Wedding at The Twins."" 

References to a character in a book are not moderated.  That means titles like ""Let's talk about Hodor in book 8"" are ok.  Yes, that means you may assume a character remains alive till at least that book, but all the details about what actually happens to the character or just how alive they may be remains unknown--there's still plenty of suspense to read. Being able to state a name with an episode or book makes post titles more informative and promotes better targeted discussion.  Consider that spoiler-level equivalent to a movie trailer, where you may see a hero fighting the villain in a climax clip, but the trailer allows you to know if the movie (or post) is right for you at all.


----
**What to do with a Spoiler**

If you encounter a live spoiler without proper warning, report it immediately.  Downvoting is good but isn't enough.  There's a link labeled ""report"" under every post, and you can [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23gameofthrones).  If you post a reply to the spoiler don't add an uncovered copy of the spoiler in your comment; it just makes the problem worse.  Also don't just reply with ""SPOILERS!""  You may be wrong, or be making a bigger deal out of a mild spoiler.  You can post your ""SPOILERS!"" reply using a cover tag to draw less attention to the post, and/or simply report it to the mods for review.

When you see a tempting spoiler warning beyond your exposure level, have some self-control.  You don't have to look at that spoiler.  You know you'll be mad if you do.

When replying to a warned spoiler, be conscious of the need to tag your own comment appropriately.  If a post's title has a warning in it, it's ok to reply without a tag if the title warning also covers your content.

Of course, loving and hating characters in a very dichotomous way is not really what GRRM's books are about but nonetheless it is a fun activity as a fan. As a fan community I like to imagine that we collectively love and hate most every character from the books. Spoilers ahead. If you haven't read the books I suggest you sign off now and go read them.

 [Book Spoiler](/b ""What I find so interesting about Sansa is that she arguably goes through the biggest change in the series. I also find her to be the most tragic character of the series, yes even more so than Robb, because her entire view of the world and people in general is completely and utterly destroyed. Robb, Ned and Catelyn, while they clearly underestimate the amount of sh*t their fellow humans will do, have awareness that people are conniving and evil. When Robb executes Lord Karstark, he knows it's a bad tactical decision but he does it because there are just some lines he is not willing to cross. Sansa however is wholly unprepared for her prince and her queen, or really anyone for that matter, to be lacking honor or decency so completely. And when she finds herself captive in a world that she is unprepared to handle, she quickly figures out to use the only two things she has, her manners/innocence and her beauty. And in a world where you either win or you die, she manages to do neither. And there is something respectable about that. Let's face it, if it had been any other Stark that got stuck in King's Landing, I don't think they would have lived long. Now perhaps this is giving her too much credit because she is often saved by situations beyond her control, but I was impressed in how she was able to handle herself. I would not have predicted that the Sansa we met in the beginning would have survived that physical and emotional torture, staying true to herself and her family internally. Especially because she is supposed to be like 11 years old. When I first started reading the books I found her useless and annoying but by the end I loved reading about her progression. I have every hope that she is going to be the character to finally give Littlefinger what he deserves. I mean I love Arya as much as the next person, but she doesn't really change or grow much throughout. She is just badass, has something sh*tty happen to her, and becomes more badass."")

Anyway, those are my thoughts on why she is one my favorites but I do admit to having many favorites so maybe I'm just predisposed to like likable and unlikable characters alike.

I anticipated this show highly, not knowing it was based on a series of books.

It's three days later now and I am halfway the second book. 



I am glad I saw the show first, if only because they depicted the characters and world so nicely. I think I prefer this mental image compared to anything I could have conjured on my own. 

Also I find it marvelous how they manage to take from the books and make the episodes without faltering much (if at all) in depicting the true storyline.

You probably know, as we know, that it cannot all fit; much has been omitted in the adaptation. But you probably have no idea how much is really missing.

If you intend to read the books, you don't need this thread. Go away now. If you are satisfied just watching the show, there are some details that will help you make sense of what is going on, and you might not ever get this from watching HBO:

Let us begin with a certain knife....

Consider the blade carried by Bran's would-be assassin. There was a lot of fuss made over that knife. From the discussion, you already know it is a fine weapon, too good for the likes of the man who carried it. But the TV show has not conveyed just how rare a blade it is.

Valyrian Steel is an extremely valuable artifact in Westeros. Think of it as original Damascus steel, nurtured and reinforced by magickal spells. Nobody makes it anymore, because nobody knows how. It is lighter than normal steel, holds an incredibly sharp edge, and is essentially unbreakable. Of all the weapons appearing in *Game of Thrones* so far, only two are Valyrian Steel: the knife put in the hand of the man who was to ""finish the job"" on Bran, and the two-handed greatsword named *Ice*, which is a family heirloom carried by Eddard Stark. It's likely a third such blade will appear in the next episode... not that it will get any more appropriate attention than the previous two. But now you'll recognize it if that does happen. (And that is *all* I have to say about the future.)

(Somewhere in this world, there is at least one blade even more exotic than these... it is a sword called *Dawn*, ""forged from the heart of a star"". Once upon a time, Ned Stark went up against the bearer of that blade; he credited another man for saving his life. But this is trivia and unnecessary to know.)

Valyria itself started as a pastoral society that grew into an advanced civilization until it hit a cataclysm. The family Targaryen escaped that doom, and invaded and dominated Westeros by their ability to control dragons. Over time their dragons became smaller and sickly, eventually dying out. By then they had unified the various kingdoms of Westeros into a single entity.

Jon Arryn, Lord of the Vale in the mountainous region north of King's Landing, accepted two boys from other Houses to mentor. From the Baratheons in the south of Westeros, and from the Starks in the north, Robert and Eddard came as children to train for their future duties. They became close friends, and in time Robert met and fell in love with Eddard's sister Lyanna.

In a series of events that have never been fully made clear, Eddard's older brother Brandon learned that Lyanna had been kidnapped by King Aerys Targaryen's son Rhaegar. He went to King's Landing demanding her release. He and his friends, sons of Stark banner men, were arrested for treason. Eddard's and Brandon's father Rickard Stark was summoned to the capitol along with the other fathers. There, they all died. King Aerys demanded that Robert and Eddard also be sent to face the same fate. Jon Arryn refused, instead raising his banners in revolt.

War raged across much of the realm. In the final decisive battle, Robert Baratheon came face-to-face with Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, on the bank of the Green Fork in the place called the Trident. (Years later, in the same place, a large group of people spent a night while traveling, and a young girl practiced fighting with sticks with her friend the butcher's boy.)

The last Targaryen king of Westeros, ""Mad King Aerys"", died during the civil war that brought Robert Baratheon to power. In the end Aerys was killed by one of his own guards, Jaime Lassiter, who broke his oath and thereby earned the derogatory title ""Kingslayer"". Queen Rhaella and young Prince Viserys escaped to the island fortress Dragonstone, but the queen died giving birth to Daenerys Targaryen. The children were smuggled across the ocean into exile.

Robert became king and spent years consolidating his power. He enjoyed his food and wine and wenching, but above all he enjoyed putting down rebellious lords. In the last major uprising, he defeated Balon Greyjoy of the Iron Islands. As part of the settlement Balon's young son Theon was sent as hostage/guest to live in the Stark household at Winterfel.

Ten years later, *Game of Thrones* begins. 

This has been a small portion of backstory. Of all that I have described, we will likely see none of it onscreen.  

Although I began with a vague premise of helping those who do not intend to read the books, I hope by now my real ulterior motive is clear: *if you are enjoying the story, then you must read the books*. There is a richness to this tale that the actors and directors and cameras cannot present, however hard and however successfully they might try. What we are watching is the completion of a sprawling saga that began long ago.

Other people will likely want to fill in other gaps in this history; I really did breeze through it. To them... please remember the words of the Wicked Witch: ""These things must be done *delicately.*"" Let's leave the future a blank, and be satisfied with bringing the story up to the present. (And *you know* which parts of the past to leave alone.)",1,1,False,default,,,,,

There have been too many leaks, failed tags, blatant hints, suggestive asides, and patronizing questions. 

I will not say anything important about what's left in this season, or the seasons to come.

You know we are nearing the end of the first book. You know we ""past readers"" think the HBO series is mostly staying faithful to the book. You have heard that it cannot all fit; much has been omitted from the adaptation. But you probably have no idea how much is really missing.

If you intend to read the books, you don't need this thread. Go away now. But if you are satisfied just watching the show, there are details that will help you make sense of what is going on, that you might not ever get from watching HBO:

Let us begin with a certain knife....

Consider the blade carried by Bran's would-be assassin. You already know it is a fine weapon, too good for the likes of the man who carried it. But the TV show has not conveyed just how rare a blade it is.

Valyrian Steel is an extremely valuable artifact in Westeros. Think of it as original Damascus steel, nurtured and reinforced by magickal spells. Nobody makes it anymore, because nobody knows how. It is lighter than normal steel, holds an incredibly sharp edge, and is essentially unbreakable. Of all the weapons appearing in *Game of Thrones* so far, only two are Valyrian Steel: the knife put in the hand of the man who was to ""finish the job"" on Bran, and the two-handed greatsword named *Ice*, which is a family heirloom carried by Eddard Stark. It's likely a third such blade will appear in tonight's episode... not that it will get any more appropriate attention than the previous two. But now you'll recognize it if that does happen. (And that is *all* I have to say about the future.)

(Somewhere in this world, there is at least one blade even more exotic than these... a sword called *Dawn*, ""forged from the heart of a star"". Once upon a time, Ned Stark went up against the bearer of that blade; he credited another man for saving his life. But this is trivia and unnecessary to know.)

Valyria itself started as a pastoral society grown into an advanced civilization until it hit a cataclysm. The family Targaryen escaped that doom, and invaded and dominated Westeros by their ability to control dragons. Over time their dragons became smaller and sickly, eventually dying out. By then they had unified the various kingdoms of Westeros into a single entity.

Jon Arryn, Lord of the Vale in the mountainous region north of King's Landing, accepted two boys from other Houses to mentor. From the Baratheons in the south of Westeros, and from the Starks in the north, Robert and Eddard came as children to train for their future duties. They became close friends, and in time Robert met and fell in love with Eddard's sister Lyanna.

In a series of events that have never been fully made clear, Eddard's older brother Brandon learned that Lyanna had been kidnapped by King Aerys Targaryen's son Rhaegar. He went to King's Landing demanding her release. He and his friends, sons of Stark banner men, were arrested for treason. Lord Rickard Stark was summoned to the capitol along with the other fathers. There, they all died. King Aerys demanded that Robert and Eddard be sent to face the same fate. Jon Arryn refused, instead raising his banners in revolt.

War raged across much of the realm. In the final decisive battle, Robert Baratheon came face-to-face with Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, on the bank of the Green Fork in the place called the Trident. (Years later, in the same place, a large group of people spent a night while traveling, and a young girl practiced fighting with sticks with her friend the butcher's boy.)

The last Targaryen king of Westeros, ""Mad King Aerys"", died during the civil war that brought Robert Baratheon to power... killed by one of his own guards, Jaime Lannister, who broke his oath and thereby earned the derogatory title *Kingslayer*. Queen Rhaella and young Prince Viserys escaped to the island fortress Dragonstone, but the queen died giving birth to Daenerys Targaryen. The children were smuggled across the ocean into exile.

Robert became king and spent years consolidating his power. He enjoyed his food and wine and wenching, but above all he enjoyed putting down rebellious lords. In the last major uprising, he defeated Balon Greyjoy of the Iron Islands. As part of the settlement Balon's young son Theon was sent as hostage/guest to live in the Stark household at Winterfell.

Ten years later, *Game of Thrones* begins. 

This has been a small portion of backstory. Of all that I have described, we will likely see none of it onscreen.  

Although I began with a vague premise of helping those who do not intend to read the books, I hope by now my real ulterior motive is clear: *if you are enjoying the story, then you must read the books*. There is a richness to this tale that the actors and directors and cameras cannot present, however hard and however successfully they might try. What we are watching is the completion of a sprawling saga that began long ago.

Other people will likely want to fill in other gaps in this history; I really did breeze through it. To them... please remember the words of the Wicked Witch: ""These things must be done *delicately.*"" Let's leave the future a blank, and be satisfied with bringing the story up to the present. (And *you know* which parts of the past to leave alone.)",156,250,False,self,,,,,

Martin's work.**  The general focus of this subreddit is the show, but discussion of the ASOIAF book series is also welcome here whether it references the show or not.  

Another update to this is coming to reflect the results of the recent [content survey poll](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/qh7ga/). Consider the results of the poll to already be active, with specific wording here forthcoming.

When discussing specific events from either the TV show or GRRM's books, please refer to the [spoiler policy](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/hvg3r) for how to do so ""safely.""

It's ok to post any information or links to any external articles, images, or videos as long as:

* **Content must directly relate to works by GRRM** - Vague references with only a single name or word to make the connection are not enough. Jokes and memes are *currently* ok as long as the reference is direct and strong.
* **Discussion of events is appropriately marked per the spoiler [guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/iamws) and [policy](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/hvg3r)**
* **Don't post inflammatory or derogatory remarks** - Don't criticize someone for what they have not yet seen or read.  Don't belittle them for their feelings about story events.  Be positive and don't target specific people.
* **Don't encourage the harm of minors or sexually objectify the actors or characters** - No sexy photos of any kind no matter what an actor did in their past.  This builds slightly on the [new Reddit-wide rule](http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/pmj7f/a_necessary_change_in_policy/) of ""No suggestive or sexual content featuring minors"" to prevent misunderstandings with adult actors playing underage characters.
* **Don't post links or direct people to illegal downloads/streams or ask for links to illegal downloads/streams** - Support the show and HBO so the whole series gets made.  Support the books so GRRM keeps writing them.
* **Don't post excessive profanity, slurs, or any needlessly offensive or insulting comments** - If you go out of your way to be rude, we'll go out of our way to ban you.
* **Don't spam** - Bot-like accounts used to direct traffic to another website are not allowed.  Commercial posts are currently ok as long as they are done by a human participating in the community.
* **Reposted content should be older than two weeks** - Check the [new posts list](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/new/) before you submit to be sure it's not already been submitted.   Reposts submitted sooner than two weeks need to add value with additional information or media. Intentionally circumventing the Reddit spam filter is not a good idea.

The WW weren't as bad the BotGF though.  First of all the halfman speech was a disappointment, and then to just have Tyrion get knocked out before it even started was just ridiculous.

GRRM kills off a lot of the likeable characters or puts them on the back burner for one or more books(not counting when they aren't there at all). This works in the books but with TV shows people need to be able to invest in the characters or at least hope that the ""bad guys"" will get what is coming to them sooner rather than later. This just isn't the case with Game of Thrones.

I have to wonder how many people will keep tuning in week to week when they have to watch 45min of despicable characters to get 15min with the only likeable characters left.

1. There are 4 books in the series (and another one coming). It is a long, detailed story that has a lot going on at one time. If you try and think ahead you need to think long-term, not just in the rest of the season, but think about the fact there is much more than just this one season of the show.
2. The book is written in a unique way. Each chapter is from the point of view of a different character. This makes it so that the book has MULTIPLE main characters. This is important.

I just recently finished the 1st book this week, and plan to finish the rest of the series within the month. I do not know what happens (much) beyond the 1st book as I am writing this post. Because of this, when I say that the 2nd fact I mentioned should warn you of things to come, I am not referring to any specific main characters because I do not know first hand what happens to anyone.

It's like my brain is still in the middle of processing what I've read, so my perspective on the show is in between that of viewing GoT as a stand alone show (as if it were not based on any book) and as a show that is based on an established narrative. I actually can't say I've ever been in a position to have viewed a series so quickly after having read what it's based on. This makes it very difficult - and very maddening - for me to judge whether or not I'm viewing the series objectively, without comparison to the book, or with comparison to the book series. It's also unclear which to me is the better kind of evaluation (or if they are two separate, but equally valid, interpretations). Once again, maddening.

So here's what I think:

I like Shae. I think she's much more engaging to Tyrion's character in the show when compared to the books, at least overtly so. That is to say, one of the interesting problems in making a show based on books that so heavily involve characters' perspectives (their thoughts being of central importance) is that in a TV show or film one generally accesses a character's thoughts through his/her actions as supposed to any inner dialogue. This strikes me as one of the challenging things in converting a book series to a video series is that you lose the ability to talk in that ""inner"" perspective and thus must be all the better at conveying it overtly, through character action. I like Shae because the character she is in the show helps bring out that part of Tyrion, once again OVERTLY, so that we can see it - because we can't see his thoughts. I think thus far in the show Tyrion has been a fairly stoic, though compassionately so, cynical kind of character. Admittedly brilliant and brilliantly portrayed. In the first book, however, Tyrion seems a bit less that way because we can read what he thinks, and in his thoughts he can be much more doubtful, much less certain. I think this particular version of Shae has helped to make it reasonable to bring out that doubtfulness in his character, that vulnerability, not to say this is the first time we've seen it. I can't speak to what Shae becomes, and whether or not you think this Shae will do that justice, because I simply haven't read that far (I'm about 200 pages into book two), but I will say that she seems pretty interesting thus far.

I appreciate how much time they spent on the scene with Tyrion, Bronn and Shae, and once again I think this speaks to wanting to get at more of Tyrion's backstory, and his uncertainty/vulnerability/sadness (whatever you call it) through speech/action as opposed to inner thought (because they can't do that). This allowed them to get at it fairly easily and reasonably through the show's narrative, and I think that the scene itself was wonderfully done. What I don't like is how much time it took - and more particularly how much time it took away from other scenes. Think about it this way. We are, I imagine, going to have Tyrion around for a long time, plenty of time to get at that part of his character more, the uncertain side, his history, past etc.) We do not have that luxury with Ned or with the battle at hand. These are things we will never see again, why not spend more time on them and do the imp later?

I think I have the normal complaints about the battle scene: I wish they had included Tyrion's perspective on the battle, though I understand that - probably for budgetary reasons and time constraints - it would be difficult to include. 

One thing that I would like to mention that I haven't seen anyone say yet is how I felt that the lack of battle scenes, and that part of the book narrative generally speaking, sort of did a disservice to Robb's part in the story, and the capture of Jaime Lannister. Even in the books, I feel like it sort of came out of the blue that he'd been caught, and why, but in the show I felt like we cut from one essentially non-existent battle scene, a scene in which not that much was explained, to all of a sudden Cat looking worried and Robb coming back with the Lannister Prince. Why? How? And then he (Robb) gives this speech at the end of it all as if we'd really witnessed something accomplished. Give me a speech at the end of a battle that I VIEWED, that I went through, not something that we view after the fact or hear about. I found it cheapening to the strength of that speech that we'd never really seen anything happen. He hadn't earned it, because we, the viewers, hadn't earned it (we hadn't experienced any sort of battle ourselves). So that sort of fell flat for me. One thing I did like was the short interaction between Jaime and Robb. That was very nicely done.

As for Daenerys' narrative and Jon's, well I think those were both very nicely done too. I actually couldn't complain about them, though I'm interested (and sort of nervous) about how they'll portray all that weird dream/tent shit that *should* happen in the next episode.

The end of Ned's story arc was also well done. I liked that he saw his daughter because that gave him all the more motivation for the decision he was to make. I think that, while an addition of sorts, it fell in nicely with his character and added more than it took away. Once again, it felt rushed, but if any scene deserves to be frantic and intense it was that one.

I don't know, the pacing just seemed a bit off this episode. And it's frustrating because this was certainly one of the more important ones. I don't know why I've singled this one out in particular. What do you guys think?",0,1,False,default,,,,,

The nature of HBO shoots itself in the foot here for the people who don't want to subscribe just for GoT. Fewer viewers, less money, and it's not like HBO has hundreds of millions to bandy around anyway (I would imagine).

So, in the interests of preserving the action, to serve as advertisement for the show and to hopefully draw more intrigued viewers to the television series, would you agree with a split between TV and film?

I don't profess to knowing how it would work out logistically. I imagine the film would have to come out significantly before or after the shows release and have enough self contained story to hold itself up, which would make things difficult for the writers.

However, we've seen some interesting animated exposition recently in Harry Potter that most people thought was great I think, and they would have the entire TV series to fish into for flashbacks or a quick recap at the beginning.

Thinking of season 2 [Book spoiler](/b ""There are things they could put in just to set the scene; Renly's death, Tywin trying to ford the Trident, some new Tyrion scenes."")

Having a movie show the most expensive set piece of the season would allow the show to have a little more breathing space in terms of story, and a fair amount more budget to invest elsewhere.

Personally, for an extra 7 I would happily go and see a GoT film in the cinema. I think it could be incredible if it was written properly, fitted in with the series and didn't have to tone itself down (keeping it to a 15, which is moderate violence).

I mention this because I heard that this idea was being thought about with regards to the Dark Tower series, and a little more time and money sounds like it would do the books considerably more justice. Thoughts?",3,1,False,self,,,,,

In prior weeks things have been pretty cool, people have been friendly and helpful to each other, we all love the show/books/etc. But recently the number of bad spoiler posts and downright troll posters has increased dramatically.  I've been VERY lenient to date, and until recently would even explain to people why their post was removed and how to resubmit or change it to make it ok.  In the last few days I've just been removing without comment because there have been too many of them.  And now it's getting stupid, like some people aren't even trying.  

It's very simple: Talking about non-show/book events, actors, behind the scenes stuff, non-specific jokes about characters, or even general feeling about certain characters like the fantasy shipper threads--all that non-spoilery talk needs no introduction.  **If your comment talks about something that specifically happened in the show or book, it must either 1) be in a thread marked ""spoiler"" in the title or 2) be covered in a spoiler tag.** 

I'm not requiring spoiler covers on everything anymore, but **if the thread title doesn't warn spoilers, then it's your responsibility as a poster to cover your comment.**  There will always be people new to the show.  Next season there will be many more people just starting it fresh.  It's no different than all the brand new book readers the show created. this season. The rules are for EVERYONE'S benefit here no matter what season is airing or book is published.

Read the [Posting Policy](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/hxu9c/posting_policy_for_rgameofthrones/) and the [Spoiler Policy](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/hvg3r/spoiler_policy_for_rgameofthrones/).  I used to only ban serious trolling-offenders, only two total in the previous month.  But I've already banned ~~two~~ five more in the last 24 hours that were just as bad.  I'm expecting to find many more today.

I about to go through the huge pile of newly-reported comments, and starting today there will be one more change.  I'll still be removing the bad ones, but now I'll also start tracking names.  If you violated the posting or spoiler policy, you should try to fix your post before I find it.  **Repeat offenders will be banned.**  I really didn't want to have to come down on people, but I clearly have no choice anymore.  All my warnings are being ignored.

**UPDATE: Just a note for people.  If you notice one or more of your comments have been removed, that is your warning.  That means you posted something inappropriate, and it's time to review the policies.  It also means the comment wasn't bad enough to get an instant-ban, but repeated minor problems are being tracked too...**",73,245,False,self,,,,,

In the book Tyrion wasn't knocked out before it even started, as he was in the show. That is lame. Tyrion was in the middle of a great battle. I believe that the book describes it as 30,000 Lannister soldiers vs ~18,000 northern and river soldiers. Clearly the show was too cheap to put together a real battle scene so they used the cheap, unrealistic, unsatisfying plot device of knocking Tyrion out instead. They couldn't even do it from CGI from a far vantage where you couldn't tell the difference?

I was even more excited for the Robb Stark vs. Jaime Lannister battle scene around Riverrun, where Stark's 2,000 knights kicked ass in an interesting tactical victory against Jaime's much larger force because, as the book describes, the natural geographic features of the land around Riverrun force sieging armies to be split into 3 parts. I was really excited for how cool it was going to be to see the northerer's take on each third of Jaime's army, while the Riverrun garrisons would be able to sneak out themselved and fully surround each Lannister group as they were surrounded. And then of course the battle scenes with Jaime Lannister, supposedly one of the greatest fighters in living matter, where the book describes him as personally killing 10 knights as they were trying to capture him, would have been awesome too. But this HBO production has really cheaped out towards its end it seems. There were supposed to be 2 epic battles, and we were given zero.

Finally, the scene where they behead Ned Stark, it was described on the book as happening at the Sept of Baelor, one of the 3 great buildings in King's Landing, making it one of the grandest buildings in the entire SoIaF universe, and the book made it seem like everyone in town came to watch. King's Landing is supposed to be ~500,000 people. In the show... it was set before an unimpressive building and a thin crowd of 100 seemed to be looking on.

Haven't these producers ever heard of CGI? I wanted battle scenes, I wanted a massive city square filled with tens of thousands of people witnessing the beheading of ned stark, I wanted the hands tourney to show tens of thousands attending as was described in the book, I wanted Robert Baratheon's party who headed north to Winterfell early in the series to feature the thousands of men and two storied horse coaches that were described in the book...

I think that the show overall has been good but they definitely have been squandering some of the epic feel that GRRM intended for the story. Shows like Spartacus, Rome, and others don't seem to have had as much of a problem filling random CGI faces into large crowds when necessary. I don't know why it should be so hard for Game of thrones to do the same with the crowds and massive buildings and castles that are featured in the books.

Now 70% through book 3 in about 5 days and this series is totally destroying my GCSE revision. Anyway George R. R.

I did guess in advance that [Book Spoiler](/b ""Barristan would end up with Daenerys""). But HBO overall has done a great job with turning this ridiculously good book into an equally amazing program and all the casting is brilliant, Bronn, Tyrion and Jon Snow being personal favorites, Joffrey being king douche in my families' TV room. I have to say some of the sexually intimate scenes were awkward, I'm 15 and even though I have three older brothers I believe my parents think I'm in the dark for that sort of thing, I'm happy to say I'm not at all in the dark but it was quite awkward and funny to see their reactions. Keeping a lid on the Ned Stark death was very hard, my brother said he would be so pissed with me if I pointed anything out in advance. I did sorta laugh at the end with the relief, not that upset Sean Bean is gone, he was good and he was bad. Looking forward to books 4 then 5-7 when they are out. Hope this show runs for many seasons I just wish I could be an extra on something this awesome.

Recall from the books the feeling of **overwhelming jubilation** you were feeling after the battle at Whispering Wood?  And then Martin pulled the earth from beneath our feet right after we were floating on cloud nine.

Now, in the episode, after the battle Robb makes a small speech which dampened the high the viewer likely felt from the victory.  I would have preferred the victory to be poured over the viewers heads like a refreshing shower, so they're just bathing in delicious exultation.  And then the Baelor's Sept scene (left just the way it was, perfect!) would come along and shatter the viewers world.

However, I did enjoy it and I do like where the plot is heading. The thing I enjoyed the most was the development of the characters. Also, I felt like a lot of pieces came into play in this book...to set up major events in book 3. All signs are foreshadowing an all out balls to the wall disaster.

I've heard that Storm of Swords is generally considered to be most popular of the series. Also, I heard that it delivers action in spades. This is good news for me as I thought that Clash of Kings spent more time having the characters talk about the events that were happening/had happened/will happen instead of describing the events themselves.

Two examples from the last episode:

1. Ned actually asked Yoren to save Arya. When reading the book I was sure Yoren just happened to pick Arya from the crowd, picking neglected kids that no one is likely to miss, definitely not doing Ned a last favor.
2. The decision to execute Ned was not made by Cersei, but by Joffrey. Cersei actually intended to let Ned join The Night's Watch. I know Joffrey may have just said that to make his mother look good, but you can actually see Cersei looking quite shocked and running to him trying to undo his decision. Up until now, I was sure that Joffrey was merely speaking the words of his mother.

I'm not sure if these were GRRM's intentions in the first place or if it's just HBO's way of filling the gaps for the viewer.

I have read through Martin's books twice now, I love them so much that I buy multiple and give them to friends.Thus Sunday's ""happening"" was not new to me, yet I need to say this to those who were surprised: If you are experiencing anger about this event for the first time, **awesome**. Seriously, I envy you. 

I wish I could go back and experience the countless moments throughout the series where Martin's phenomenally merciless writing sent shivers up my spine. Few pieces of media have had this effect on me, another example being the end of Dexter season 4 (the one with the Trinity killer; I won't spoil it here, but **HOLY SHIT!** if you know what I'm referencing).

When this happens to you, when a piece of media puts you in a blind rage (or any extreme emotion for that matter) here is my advice: cherish that rage. The people who assembled that moment put a vast amount of thought and creativity into it. You are supposed to be angry, that anger will fuel your emotions throughout the rest of the series. 

When events occur in the future which remind you of this, and many will, you will feel that anger again, and that anger will influence this new emotion you are made to feel towards another character or action.

**TL;DR** I am encouraging those new to A Game of Thrones to allow the series to infuriate them at times. This is intentional; cherish the emotion. Good media throws you into a roller-coaster filled with the full spectrum of human emotion. No emotion is superior or inferior to another.",52,37,False,self,,,,,

----

Lately I've been seeing a lot of people shedding tears for the life of a traitor and terrorist who attempted (by his own admission) to overthrow the legitimate King Joffrey and deposit his treacherous ass on the Iron Throne.

I really can't understand this attitude. The lives and properties of all the good people of King's Landing are being threatened by the terrorists and rebels coming from the North, with their weird old gods and their wolves. And when the great King Joffrey does what must be done to send a message to them, people complain. Well, I don't know about you, but I did see all that people in the Sept of Baelor claiming for justice to be served to the traitor. King Joffrey did what any good leader must do at every turn. He listened to his people, and delivered justice.

Sure, you might argue that sometimes showing a little mercy is something to be desired. But there's a time and a place for everything, and when the Realm is being threatened at the same time by the barbaric Dothraki and the treacherous Northmen, it's not a time to show weakness, it's a time to show strength and resolve.

Sure, Robert might have done things different. Robert was a good man, but as a king he was ineffectual and he ignored the threats coming from the terrorists in the North, even appointing one of them as his Hand. But King Joffrey is different. Unlike his father, may he rest in peace, he has been raised all his life for the post he now occupies, and he's just the strong and resolute leader the Realm needs at these trying times.

Have you forgotten that the traitor stormed into the throne room, backed by troops he thought loyal to him? He planned and tried to execute a coup, presenting a forged document. Even after his attempt at a quick takeover of the Throne failed, the always good Joffrey attempted to keep the peace with the treasonous Northmen, and only requested that the traitor's son travel to King's Landing to swear fealty to him, as all lords of the Realm must do.

And what was this terrorist's response? To coerce those who have sworn their loyalty to him into conscription, and march them against the legitimate King Joffrey. To destroy the peace and the lives of the good people of the Realm. All for a lust for power, and to deny the King's justice for the traitor.

So yes, I'm happy the traitor is dead. He deserved it. He tried to destroy the kingdom with his actions, but King Joffrey showed that the kingdom is stronger than that.

[Spoilers for 1.09],https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/hzye6/dae_rage_at_how_stupidpolitically_incompetent/,[deleted],1308104863,"I know that the series (as well as ASOIFA) is more of a realistic take on fantasy and the power politics compared to say, *Lord of the Rings* and the like, but the sheer amount of stupidity/political miscalculation that the lords and kings &amp; such in GoT is astounding. For example:

* Ned Stark refusing Renly's offer to help take the palace overnight and take Joffrey &amp; Tommen from Cersei, and instead trusting **Littlefinger** (who, like he said, told Ned point-blank not to trust him) to secure the City Watch for his attempt to unseat Joffrey.

* None of the characters who complain about Ned's ""treason"" are at the very least (except for Littlefinger) aware of the irony that pretty much all of them helped commit treason (in the Targaryens' eyes) by ousting the Mad King 20 years before.

* Robert and his small council deciding that assassinating the last [TV Spoiler](/s ""non-ancient, Night's Watch"") Targaryen, is a great idea, despite the fact that now Daenarys is pregnant with Khal Drogo's son, and is Khaleesi to the Dothraki, which would (and did) rightfully piss the Khal off.

* Joffrey's kingship so far. Taking the unprecedented step of forcing Ser Barriston (probably one of the deadliest knights in Westeros) into retirement, despite him being the exemplar Kingsguard, in order to blatantly put Jaime in charge, despite Jaime being the Kingslayer. This would probably make all of the other houses (besides Stark, who hate the shit out of them already) aware that the Lannisters don't care about anything other than advancing their own, even if it hurts other, non-adversaries who you don't want to piss off. [TV Spoiler](/s ""Then there's the whole 'allow Ned and the Small Council to work out a plea deal so that he doesn't get executed, and just kill him anyways', even if everyone thinks it's a horrible idea that will just inflame Rob and make peace impossible."") 

* Viserys (his stupidity could fill a thousand posts, so I won't list it here) deciding that the Dothraki will be the army that he will need to take Westeros for the Targaryens. Except that the Dothraki have a religious belief against going across water that their horses can't wade across and are a foreign army who have gained a reputation as savages who rape and pillage (and not much else), which would make a restored Targaryen dynasty pretty unpopular (using ""uncivilized"" foreigners to retake a throne that your insane father was forced from generally doesn't endear one to the people) and would make people realize that maybe King Joffrey/Stannis/whomever would be much better than a Targaryen who gave the Dothraki a free reign over Westeros.

* Ned not even hinting at the reason why Joffrey isn't the rightful king during his attempted arrest of Cersei &amp; Joffrey. All he had to do was plant the seed in the heads of the courtiers that Joffrey might not be the rightful heir (even point out the evidence that Jon Arryn had uncovered), and propose that until the matter could be settled definitively, have Stannis be regent or have him act as Lord Protector.

* Ned failing to take Littlefinger's plan of using his position of Lord Protector to keep an eye on Joffrey and if he (and Littlefinger) think that Joffrey will be a terrible king like the last two, they will leak the information that he is Jaime's bastard out and put Stannis or Remly on the throne, whichever one would be a better ruler. Granted, this *is* Littlefinger we're talking about, so it may have been a ploy to trick Ned, but the plan still is very solid.

* The cream of the crop: Ned telling Cersei that he knows that Joffrey &amp; Tommen (as well as Myrcella) are not Robert's children, and giving her plenty of time to move against Robert &amp; Ned and solidify her control over the throne (via Joffrey Bieber).

Okay, if I promise I won't list any more except in the comments. It's just...gah! As a political science major, this shit infuriates me, since all of the characters (again, except Littlefinger &amp; Cersei [TV Spoiler](/s ""until King Joffrey decides to fuck things up"")) who have any influence or control over the kingdom or any realms, are spending more time herpderping than trying to figure out how to solve any fucking problems or stop the fighting.",19,0,False,default,,,,,

So much so that I think I may start read ASOIAF. I have a few questions for you guys. How close to the book is Game of Thrones so far? About where in the book (chapters) does season 1 end or are they doing it where the season and the book ends at the same time?

The reason for this is because I don't want to be bored reading this book and if they're pretty accurate in the TV series then I don't see a point in reading that part. I know the purists will disagree with me and that's fine, we're all entitled to our opinions. But if the book and the TV series are overly different, then I'll probably just read it from the beginning.

What are your thoughts?

**Update:** Thanks for all the wonderful advice. I think what I'm going to do is grab the audiobooks and get started on Monday with the first book.

**Update 2:** About 1/4 of the way through the audiobook. Very well done and I'm already seeing some of the differences in the book. But I'm also seeing how close they came to it as well. Thanks guys!",30,7,False,self,,,,,

The show makes him look almost like a bad ass goofball and I don't remember liking him this much when I read the books.  Either way, I think the way the actor is playing him is hilarious and very well done.

However, we missed out on both battles.

Is there any chance we'll be getting a 'big battle' in the season finale? Me and several friends have been watching very much in the hopes of catching one large 'epic' confrontation, or at least a skirmish that's a little larger than the street scuffles we've seen so far.

From what I know, the next episode will see several claims to the throne arise and Daenerys' plot taking a turn, but and battles?

Jorah: He seemed a lot more serventile rather than mentor in the book.  Definitely like him better now.

Tyrion: Yeah, never ever would have thought it possible, but I think everyone likes him even more. 

Theon Greyjoy:  I had a hard time giving a shit about this guy.  The series definitely put a face on this character for me. His acting is a bit under appreciated too.  He adds a lot to the character IMO.

Catelyn Stark/Tully: Loved her character in the books, but Michelle Fairley somehow brings even more to the table.  Awesome acting.

Alliser Thorne: Like Theon, I just had a hard time giving a shit about this guy in the books, but in the show Owen Teale does an awesome job bringing out and highlighting the animosity between him and Jon Snow.

Tywin: I was really surprised at how well the character was brought to life in the series.  The scene where is is skinning the deer is bloody amazing.

Varys: I had a hard time getting a mental image or any feelings towards this guy in the books.  The TV series definitely did the character justice.


Characters I thought were better when I imagined them vs on the show:

Jon Snow: Anyone else feel like he's Keanu Reeves-ish?

Robb Stark: It seems like the character is way too forced.  For example, when Catelyn comes back and tells him Frey's terms for crossing.

Syrio Forel: I definitely like him on the show, but I imagined him to be totally different.

Everyone else I feel matches up pretty much perfectly.  For example, King Robert, Ned Stark, Jeor Mormont, Samwell, Jon Umber, Pycelle, Barristan Selmy, Petyr Baelish, Daenerys and Cersei (both had the bar set high and met).

TBH I'm undecided on Jamie.

How have the characters matched up for everyone else?

Khal Drogo is definitely going to die soon. It's the classic ""life for a life"" archetype; Daenerys will have a healthy baby boy, and Drogo will eat shit and die. I will miss him.

AND

Jamie Lannister is fucked the moment the remaining Starks find out about what happened to Ned. Jon Snow will leave the Nights Watch (at some point, maybe not this season, but the guy isn't going to stay there for long) and Drogo is going to go crazy as fuck on anybody who threatens Daenerys (or she will run, not sure)
And Tyrion is going to continue to provide comic relief.

**1.**  In the show, [TV Spoiler](/s ""there was a whole lot of reaction by every single character when Joff pronounced the sentence, as well as many shots of the crowd reacting. Also, Ilyn Payne paraded around with Ice for a *long* time before carrying out the sentence. I assume this was to ensure that non-reading viewers knew that the sword was Ice, though I am not sure how many of them caught it anyway."")

In the book, [Book Spoiler](/b ""it was very quick. Joff pronounces, Ilyn Payne acts, *then* everyone goes WTF?! It was very obvious that nobody had any idea what Joff was about to do. They all assumed he was going to let Ned take the Black. Tywin actually pointed it out later to Tyrion: Joff had surprised everyone and Payne had acted before anyone else could react. Tywin implied Cersei, if nobody else, would have interceded had she had time, but it all happened too quickly. I wish they had paced it like it was in the book: Joff pronounces, Payne acts immediately, *then* we see everyone's WTF face. "")

**EDIT:** Regarding point 1, it has been pointed out in the comments that [TV Spoiler](/s ""you can't really keep the pace of the book and still allow a glimmer of hope for poor Ned. Reading obviously happens a lot slower than viewing the show, so we had plenty of time to hold out hope for Ned as we read, even though it progressed very quickly in the book. For the show, they had to extend the moment a bit to allow the viewer to hope for some amazing rescue to play out. Excellent point."")

**2.** In the show, [TV Spoiler](/s ""Ned points Arya out to Yoren, Yoren finds Arya and consoles her as the sword comes down."")

In the book, [Book Spoiler](/b ""We dont see Yoren, and dont even know its Yoren until a few chapters later. Arya watches the execution on her own, then gets grabbed out of the crowd by an unknown man with a dagger. We are left to wonder who it was and what exactly was happening. I think that would have made for a much better ending for the episode, though much darker. "")

**EDIT:** Regarding point 2, it has been pointed out in the comments that [TV Spoiler](/s ""the way this scene was changed allowed us to feel a little more for Ned before his departure, as well as making the ending a little more palatable, and making Ned the focus instead of Arya's disappearance. Another great point."")

Thanks for the comments folks, you turned me around :)

And for the record, I absolutely love the show, and am constantly amazed at how well the writers adapted such a large book into such a short season, while keeping all of the important elements and the overall feel of the book.

Pretty much all of the characters that were under 18 had their ages bumped up by a few years and I can completely understand why HBO had to do that, and think they've done a good job.  So this isn't meant to be complaining or griping about it, however I do think it changes our perception of the characters some and wanted to get some feedback from other readers if they felt the same way.

First, from my recollection I think the age changes went something like this.
*Jon: 14 -&gt; 17/18
*Robb: 14 -&gt; 17/18
*Sansa: 11 -&gt; 15/16
*Arya Stark: 9 -&gt; 11
*Daenarys: 13 -&gt; 16/17 (Actress is 18+ obviously)

As I've watched the show on TV, I haven't had quite the same feeling of ""Young kid having to grow up really really fast"" as I did while reading the books.  I still see how someone can have that impression, but I don't think the actors and actresses ages really gives it off quite as strongly.

A few examples:
Comments about Robb being 'just a green boy' and not ready to lead an army seem forced.  I look at him on screen see him as a young adult, not as a teenage boy.  Sure, it's more than he's ready for even at 17 or 18, but a boy goes through a whole lot of changes mentally and physically in the 3-4 years from freshman in high school to senior.

Sansa's foolish infatuation with Joffrey.  I found it far easier to forgive her when I imagined her being 11-12 than I do seeing her as a 15-16yr old.  At the age she is in the show, I see it more as a character flaw and less as an age/experience problem.

Daenerys actually still gives off much of the same impression I had from the book.  A couple years doesn't change much when you go through the stuff she is going through.  However I would still say that my impression of her being in over her head was amplified while reading compared to the show.


Just curious to see if any other readers interpret these characters and their actions/capabilities different due to the age changes.",28,9,False,self,,,,,

We watched Doctor Who, Chuck, Fringe, IT Crowd, Dexter, Community and Californication this way, plus a bunch of other failed attempts.

She generally prefers 21 minutes TV Shows episodes to 42 minutes ones, because her point of view is that most TV shows of 42 minutes could really be shown in 21 minutes.

The reason why Chuck and Fringe made the cut is that they clearly make good use of their 42 minutes. Doctor Who usually does, but from time to time, she thinks it's way too long and that there are time fillers.

Same with Torchwood. In comparison, she liked Sarah Jane Adventure, because with 21 minutes per episode, they had to keep only the essential.

But even on her favorite 41 minutes shows, in some of the episodes, she feels like they could have been shorter: it's the end of the day and we are all tired, so why waste time?

When she heard of Game of Thrones, she was interested but turned off by the 57 minutes duration.

That means 15 more minutes of screen time to focus on, but last week, we began Game Thrones anyway, watching 1 episode per night (or almost) ending with The Golden Crown yesterday.

This morning, she told me: **You know, Game of Thrones doesn't feel like a 60 minutes show. It's grabs our attention and when the credits roll, you think ""Already?""**

Minor non-plot spoilers, plenty of show spoilers",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/i2iba/what_information_do_you_believe_the_show_hasnt/,[deleted],1308349502,"**Geography-** I'm not even really sure how many continents there are, but he two that are important so far are already featured on the show. There's Westeros where most of the action takes place, and Essos where Dany is. Westeros and Essos are separated by two seas. There is the Narrow Sea off the Eastern shore, and the Jade sea off the Western sure. The Jade Sea is much wider. 

Across the narrow sea are the Free Cities. They're basically city states each with their own unique culture. They have a close relationship with Westeros since they are not that far away. In this area is Valyria. It's dead now, but is the ancient homeland of the Targaryens (Dany's family). The Free Cities were the home of characters like Varys and Syrio. 

If you were to go even further east (or alternatively west across the Jade Sea), you'd eventually run into a bunch of different city-states. They're like the Free cities but weirder, more foreign (more like asia), and more magical. In this area is a city called Asshai. It's particularly infamous for it's magic. In the book the lady that Dany saved that was in the tent, and saving Drogo by singing had gone to Asshai to study. Asshai borders an area called the Shadow lands. Not much is known about them except that they are creepy. 

**History** - 300 years ago Aegon Targaryen brought his two sisters and three dragons to the Westeros mainland and conquered every..almost everyone. There were seven kingdoms in those days. The Starks in the North (the whole half of the continent that is north), The Gardeners in the south West (the Reach), The Lannisters in the  north west, The Arryns in the north east, The Martells in the South (Dorne), The GreyJoys on the Iron Islands ruling over The Riverlands, and The Storm Kings in the south east (the stormlands).

When Aegon the Conqueror came conquering he rewarded those who helped him. There was some turn over in the great housed. Most importantly The Greyjoys lost control of the Riverlands. The Iron Islands kind of suck for livelyhood so this was a big blow. Aegon placed the Tullys (catelyns family) as lords of the Riverlands. The Gardners were replaced by the Tyrells, and the Baratheons replaced The Storm Kings. Aegon conquered six of the Kingdoms, but it was a generation or two before Dorne was conquered too. 

Aegon liked to bang his sisters, and I guess they liked it too. So all future generations kept it up. Dany was expected to be Viserys's wife till he sold her for his crown. At least he got some nipple first. The Lannisters DO NOT practice this. Jamie and Cersei are just a special sort of fucked up. 

It's said that you could flip a coin to decide if a Targaryen was destined for greatness or madness. King Aerys ended up being the latter, and eventually it was too much. When he murdered Ned's brother and father it sparked the rebellion, but at that point it was already well primed to happen. It was just the spark that lit the gasoline covered bonfire. So three of the great houses rose up, the Starks, Arryns, and Baratheons. Ned and Robert were fostered together with Jon Arryn at The Eyrie. They grew up friends with Jon as a father figure. House Tully rose as well as Ned's brother had been betrothed to Catelyn, the daughter of the head of the house. House Dorne and House Tyrell rose for the Targaryens, as well as many of the lords who were sworn to the Arryns. The Lannisters stayed neutral.

The pivotal battle was called the Trident, and at the Trident the pivotal fight was fought between a much much fitter Robert, and King Aerys's son, Rhaegar. Rhaegar, despite one sketch instance, is spoken of in the books as a really great guy. The sort of guy you want as King. But Robert killed him and took the throne. Robert had a better claim to the throne because of a Targaryen ancestor. After the Trident, but before Kings Landing was taken The Lannisters joined the war. So, it had already been won, but the Lannisters just showed up and took the big prize. Jaime had already killed Aerys when they got there, hence the name kingslayer. 

A few years later The Iron Islands and the Greyjoys decided that they could rebel too. It was put down, and to keep them in line Ned took the heir to House Greyjoy, Theon. He's the guy that paid to see the girl's vagina.  

**Way back history-** I don't know how far they'll go into this, so I'll try not to go too far into this. There used to be, assumedly, another race called The Children of the Forest, but they've been gone for a long time now. The Others came 8000 years ago, and the Children were instrumental in defeating them. The Others are different from Wights. A wight is what you saw that Jon Snow killed. The others are another race entirely. They fucked up everything when they came, but were eventually driven back. In response The Wall was built. There are 19 castles along The Wall, but there are only three occupied now, and it's more of a penal colony now. 

**Other tidbits-** Seasons are random. A long summer seems to indicate a long winter, and it's been a long summer. 

Rickon is the 5th Stark child, 6th including Jon Snow. He's seen intermittently. He's not really important. To be honest he's kind of an annoying useless little cunt. 

Direwolves are a lot bigger than in the show. As in holy fuck I pissed my pants pony sized. They're definitely around more in the book. It's hard to work with them in the show. For instance, in the battle that Robb was in, his wolf, Grey Wind, killed something like a dozen horses. Also, Rickon, Bran, Robb, and Jon all still have theirs, and they do more in the books, but it's hard to get the dogs to do any of it. 

The battles were a lot cooler in the books, not only in the action, but in what they actually were. Tyrion did not get knocked out, he fought.

Valaryian Steel is just super awesome sharp swords. It can not be made anymore, and there are not many swords left. The Stark's sword was called Ice. It was used to behead Ned. John received house Mormonts ancestoral sword Longclaw. In the book it is explained that the memories are too painful that are attached to it. Many other houses have swords. 

Tyrion is not only a Dwarf, but an ugly dwarf, not a big deal, but still.

Most people agree that Renly is awfully portrayed. He's got tons of swagger and confidence and is ripped. For instance he rode in the tournament in the book. The Tournament was a bit bigger and more majestic in the book. 

Stannis is Roberts other brother and is older than Renly. Renly is a real people person, pretty much everyone loves him. Stannis is the opposite.

Joffrey has a brother and a sister. They've been seen like once in the second episode. They're Tommen and Myrcella. 

Maesters. There's an old man in winterfell that is one. Aemon Targaryen (a different one) is on the wall with Jon and is very old and blind. Grand Maester Pycelle is the old man in King's Landing. Basically most houses have one, and they're all trained in a place called Old Tower. They're sort of advisers and professors mixed. When they are apprentice maesters they have to forge a chain out of links. Every link represents knowledge that they have mastered. Masonry, farming, healing, warcraft etc etc. 

Maesters usually handle ravens which are the messaging system of Westeros. 

The Kingsguard guard the king. There are seven of them. Historically they're the greatest bestest knights in the land. Jaime Lannister was one, and why him killing the king is considered so vile. Barristan Selmy was the Commander of the Kingsguard. The last man Syrio fought was a member of the Kingsguard. The Hound, burnt face man, was appointed to the Kingsguard when Selmy was dismissed, and Jaime was appointed commander of the Kingsguard.

**The Free Cities = Europe**: ***Separated from Westeros by an ocean, city-states/nations far more independent than Westerosan kingdoms/states***

Wildlings in the provinces while The Others live in the territories, obviously.

Posting in a manner that does not reflect the scope described in those policies can be grounds for banning. Banning is not done lightly, but please do not think getting a ""warning"" means we're soft about it.

**People are banned for:**

* **Intentionally posting unwarned spoilers.** Every now and there a real Troll (capital T) shows up and starts to post open spoilers everywhere in this and other subreddits.  Trolls are instantly banned.

* **Repeatedly posting unwarned or mislabeled spoilers ""by accident.""** Sometimes people just don't seem to be paying attention; it happens.  We try to explain the situation to hopefully prevent future problems.  But repeated careless posting can't be ignored and will result in a ban.  Mild spoiler information may get multiple warnings about it, but major spoilers, especially those posted in titles or shown in thumbnails, will get only one warning  before a ban if it happens again.
  
* **Intentionally rude, trollish remarks.** Jokes are fine, even the lame ones.  But posts that cross the line into complete a-hole territory aren't tolerated.  Be respectful to others reading this subreddit.  This also relates to limitations outlined in the [Posting Policy](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/hxu9c/posting_policy_for_rgameofthrones/).  

* **Intentionally breaking any other rules outlined in the posting or spoiler policies after receiving clear warning.** In the past that was done under the ""intentionally rude"" point, but it's become apparent that a more specific description was needed.  It's important to at least try to follow the policies.  People who make it clear they don't care to try won't be welcome.

Most anything else is ok, and since 99% of the people here don't have a problem with the above, this seems to be working well.  Also for the people worried about the above, you should note from my posts in this subreddit that I *constantly* talk with people and reply to posts to make it clear what's going on.  I often repeat myself by directing people to just read the posted policies multiple times a day.  The ultimate goal is simply reduction of the amount of reported problems so everyone can enjoy their time here.  So please don't go out of your way to create a problem.

Now that the season is over, with all of the positive reviews and a growing number of viewers, could it be possible that HBO will give the show an even larger budget to convey the coming events? For example, [Book Spoiler](/b ""The Battle of the Trident is a huge part of ACoK and I do not see how they could just gloss over it as they did with the minor battles of AGoT."") I really hope they don't, because the only part of the show that has let me down is the lack of fighting and the scale of the armies on each side, and knowing that there will be much more of this in the next book/season makes me really hope they go all out!

The Direwolves were played way down, which I feel is a shame, but there's still opportunities to resolve this. I feel that the parts where Tyrion gets some battle experience in the books are missing as well, as they show him evolving and becoming more invested in what's going on around him.

In fact, I discovered the show via Reddit only.

I have a few questions which burn my mind and while I do not want to be spoiled the whole future, I do want these answers to help me decide if I will read the books or not or simply wait for the next season.

I am afraid that if I take a look at websites, it will spoil it for me, so here are the questions. Please answer them with yes or no, do not elaborate unless it's impossible to answer yes or no:

- **Is Joffrey dead or a least deposed by the end of the 5th book ?** I don't want to know if he is dethroned or killed, but if NO ONE manages to kill him or replace him, it's going to be very depressing 4 books for me. 
- **Do the three dragons manage to make babies?** If all three are males or all three are females, the answer is no. If these dragons cannot makes babies, the answer is no. If they die before they can, the answer is no. If at least ONE egg is made but doesn't hatch, than the answer is yes. If all of their babies are killed and they are also killed, then the answer is yes.  I want to know if at least at some point, I will get chills that the Dragons may get a rebirth and bring a new Dragon Age or if it is doomed that these are the last 3 dragons. I don't care if later, that is ruined, it's what drama is for.
- **Are the Dragon somewhat useful west of the narrow sea?** If Dany only uses the Dragon to unite the Dothraki (sp?) and they are killed by envoys of the mainland, they are not useful. I want to know if at some point, the Dragons manage to kick some ass on the mainland or if they are just a plot device to build an army and discarded afterwards.
- **Is the wall story actually interesting?** I know you folks all love the wall and the nightwatch, but my initial impression is that there are the Wight Walkers who are a formidable foe, but perhaps on an ""animalistic"" fashion: they are bent on destruction but not on building an empire of wight with an agenda other than killing everything on sight. If it's just an clone of a zombie apocalypse movie, I'll be rather disapointed because the south will have all these intricate conspiracies while the north would just be a hack and slash marathon. If there is a twist somewhere, like I don't know, a magician controlling everything or the Wight Walkers having a secret agenda, or perhaps they are used to kill the dragon or something like that, then say yes. If all they are, in essence, is monsters in the night to fight, then sorry, I will have felt that the excellent and amazing Jon Snow will be a waste of footage. He is awesome, conflicted, interesting, and all he has to do is fight like a dummy? 
- **Is Sansa going to amount to something?** She sounds like a spoiled brat, and talks like a spoiled brat, but in the finale, she contemplated pushing Joffrey down the planks and was stopped. Will she actually at least TRY to do something to redeem herself in our eyes ? I hope she doesn't just marry him and stay quiet for the rest of her life. I don't mind if she makes a pointless last stand in which she is killed. Will she at least grow a spine someday?

That's it.

For record, I hope the answers are yes on all of them, but please don't elaborate... I don't care if Joffrey is dead or deposed, I just want one of the two.

And if it's Sensa who kills him, PLEASE, don't tell me, just answer yes on the first and last question.

""I really like the scenes where Varys and Littlefinger face off. But they gt me to thinking. (Since the show is sticking so closely to the material, Im going to treat anything seen in the show as having the same weight as having been written in the book). They are such similar characters in the way they operate, yet the show is making it explicit there is a sense of rivalry between them. And so I got to wondering why that might be, besides that it makes for good one liners.

In SoS, it is revealed that Littlefinger has been playing an extremely long game in trying to get Sansa under his tutelage (also trying to have sex with her) and trying to bolster his station. His plans are so subtle and executed so flawlessly that I found it literally jaw dropping that he had planned for so much of it all along. He is truly a master of the Game of Thrones. However, it is not clear whether Littlefinger actually intends on taking the throne for himself. Its not clear if he even thinks thats possible. But when asked what he wants in Season 1, he says simply, Everything. Now that doesnt mean he wants to be king necessarily, it probably just means he wants to be the guy in control of everything, and so far he is doing a really good job of that given where he started. 

Now compare him to Varys. The two basically work off the same MO, subtly influencing people in the direction they desire. But what is it that Varys desires? The most important moment for answering that question comes when Ned Stark just asks him straight up, What is it that you want? He responds that he wants peace. To Whom do you serve? He replies, I serve the realm. 

Now you might take his meaning to be, I consider myself a humble servant of the throne and Im just doing that the best way that I know how. But I dont think its that simple. When I first read it, I thought, thats bullshit, and when I saw it in the show, I thought the same thing. There is something more to that claim.

Consider the following issues  GRRM repeatedly hints that Varys is a wizard of some sort and that Varys is aware of the prophecies that have been going around regarding the Prince That Was Promised and the return of the three headed dragon.

In GoT, he comes to Neds cell but he does not look like himself, and Ned asks him something along the lines of, Just what sort of magician are you? and Varys gives him a response which is basically like, Dont worry about that right now. (I dont have the book in front of me sorry, otherwise I would do the actual quote.). Its interesting that he dismisses the question rather than denies it. I was very disappointed to see that they cut these lines, but I think that means something.

In SoS, when Tyrion is brought to Varyss chambers to meet with Shae, Varys shows up in disguise again, and disappears very suddenly. Tyrion asks how he does it, and Shae explains that Varys demonstrated his bed lifting up and down by magic. Tyrion laughs it off and says, Yes. A counterweight spell. Now, is this more of the Spiders trickery? Or is it Varys hiding his magic in plain sight? Telling Shae wont matter. Shes just some whore. No one will believe her that someone did magic. Not even Tyrion. 

The final one I can think of, and the most important one for my speculation, is in GoT when Arya gets lost in the lower levels of the Red Keep. Remember that she overhears the conversation between the two guys talking about Neds demise and the coming civil war. In the show they make explicit that this is Varys and Magister Illyrio- the guy who gave the dragon eggs to Danaerys. It is obvious from their discussion that they are planning something big because they are discussing how the political situation in Kings Landing is interfering with whatever it is they are both trying to do. Yet we learn nothing of what that is. 

Then in FfC, we learn more about the prophecy of the Prince That Was Promised. According to a wiki of Ice and Fire, 

&gt;The prophesy states that ""when the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers, Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone."" This will occur after a long summer when an evil, cold darkness descends upon the world. It is said that The Prince that was Promised, wielding Lightbringer once again, will stand against the Others and if he fails, the world fails with him.

Now we know that this prophecy preoccupied some important Westerosi people like Rhaegar Targaryen and the Maesters of the Citadel, but it is also something that Melisandre, from somewhere very far off, knows about too. She came to Westeros to deal with it, in fact. Now consider that there seems to be a decent chance that Varys is some kind of wizard. Consider that even if he isnt, he is a mysterious person with mysterious methods and an uncanny, even supernatural seeming, ability to collect and exploit information about people. Consider that we know nothing of his past besides what he claims, and that we understand very little about what he is aiming to do. Consider also that he is in some yet unknown way in league with Magister Illyrio- another person whose motivations were mysterious- yet both he and Varys are part of a plan so big it concerns the basic political structure of Westeros itself. And consider that it was Magister Illyrio who gave Danaerys the dragon eggs and that those dragons awoke out of stone just as the red star began to bleed in the sky. 

Varys is playing a*very* long game here people. What Varys means by serving the realm and wanting peace is that he is trying to make sure that Westeros and the Prince (or Princess) that was promised have a united Westeros behind him or her so that when the Long Night begins, Prince (or Princess) that was promised can get the job done. So if you were unconvinced by his purported selflessness, it isnt because he is actually selfish or lying. He's just saying, ""You wouldn't understand."" He is considering something grander than the silly little games these petty lords are playing. Hes got the fate of the world partially in his hands, but if he were to come out and try to explain that to people they would laugh him out of the room. 

I would even go so far as to say that Varys's presence at court is inexplicable without this theory. He doesn't seem to want the throne. It would never go to a eunuch anyway. To say that he is building his power and influence, well, he never seems to exercise it in a way that is beneficial to him. And he arguably holds more influence than anybody else at court, being the master of whisperers. He isn't even trying to accumulate any wealth for himself it seems. He lives in like a one-room cell bordering on a dungeon with nothing in it. It's not like he lives an easy life, so he must be up to something.

So back to the show. Thinking about Varys in terms of that, it paints the Littlefinger-Varys exchanges in a whole different way. They are rivals not just politically but philosophically. Littlefinger is an extremely cunning dude capable of doing what Varys is doing (except for the magic), but it is purely out of vanity and greed. Varys suffers the disdain and hatred of others, but hes trying to save the world. Littlefinger thinks hes just some smart ass who can match wits with him that he has to compete with. 

But Varys is on some shit that no one can else can even contemplate right now. It explains the obvious disdain for Littlefinger that he portrays in the show, but it is also explains why GRRM would have two major characters who seem to serve the same purpose- they are point and counterpoint. And that is reflected by their literal point and counterpoint in the show, and I think its great foreshadowing and hinting by the producers and writers (if Im right)"" ).

__TL;DR__ Littlefinger and Varys are both gangsters, but they are two sides of the same coin. One is selfish, the other is saving the world.",4,4,False,self,,,,,

Then **BAM** Episode ten was 100% pure, media genius. I was honestly in tears for the last couple minutes as Daenarys rose from the ashes.

Fifteen years prior to the novel, the Seven Kingdoms were torn apart by a civil war, known alternately as ""Robert's Rebellion"" and the ""War of the Usurper."" Prince Rhaegar Targaryen kidnapped Lyanna Stark, arousing the ire of her family and of her betrothed, Lord Robert Baratheon (the war's titular rebel). The Mad King, Aerys II Targaryen, had Lyanna's father and eldest brother executed when they demanded her safe return. Her second brother, Eddard, joined his boyhood friend Robert Baratheon and Jon Arryn, with whom they had been fostered as children, in declaring war against the Targaryens, securing the allegiances of House Tully and House Arryn through a network of dynastic marriages (Lord Eddard to Catelyn Tully and Lord Jon Arryn to Lysa Tully). The powerful House Tyrell continued to support the King, but House Lannister and House Martell both dragged their feet due to insults against their houses by the King. The civil war climaxed with the Battle of the Trident, when Prince Rhaegar was killed in battle by Robert Baratheon. The Lannisters finally agreed to support King Aerys, but then brutally turned against him, sacking the capital at King's Landing. Jaime Lannister of the Kingsguard executed King Aerys and House Lannister swore loyalty to Robert Baratheon. The Tyrells and remaining royalists surrendered and Robert Baratheon was declared King of the Seven Kingdoms. Unfortunately, during the war, Lyanna Stark had died, apparently of illness; Robert Baratheon instead married Cersei Lannister to cement the alliance. Despite Robert's victory, the Mad King's youngest son Viserys and youngest daughter Daenerys were taken to safety across the sea by loyal retainers. After the war House Martell chose a path of isolation, since Prince Doran's sister Elia Martell (Prince Rhaegar's wife) and her young children had been killed by Lannister armsmen during the storming of the capital.

Six years later King Robert proved his resolve by defeating a rebellion by Lord Balon Greyjoy of the Iron Islands. Balon's two eldest sons were killed and his youngest son, Theon, was given to the care of Eddard Stark as a ward. 

I recently finished the books and am still fuzzy about some of this:  Why did Rhaegar kidnap Lyanna?  Just a Helen of Troy type of thing?

I wonder if we'll learn more about Rhaegar.. [Book Spoiler](/b ""it seemed like they were setting up some sort of reveal via Barristan's conversations with Daenarys"")

1. Theon Greyjoy has developed into one of my favorite minor characters. I understand his position as ward of the Starks, but what is the relation of House Greyjoy as a whole towards House Stark (are they sworn to the Starks as a result of their previous rebellion)? Are they generally considered a ""northern"" house? If not, then [TV Spoiler](/s ""Theon's pledge to the KING IN THE NORTH"") is a pretty big deal [Book Speculation](/? ""which might not go down well with his dad"").

2. Why did the Lannisters attack Riverrun? It seems that Jaime's army lay siege to it as soon as Robb called in his bannermen. I understand Cat is a link between House Stark and Tully, but I don't remember the Tully's declaring war on the Lannisters.

I remove them in due course, but most often the person making the post gets simply a warning about it while I mark their name down to see if they do it again.  The [banning policy](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/i2wyh/banning_policy_for_rgameofthrones/) explains that I've not been insta-banning people for spoilers; it's repeat-offenders who can't stop posting them that get banned (and that's still only happened once).  But now with all these thumbnail posts over the last couple weeks people have started to ask specifically for more bans. So here's my question to you all: 
***
**How soon do you think thumbnail spoilers should result in bans?**

****
This poll is UPVOTE ONLY.  Just pick the option you like and upvote it. ** *Downvotes will be ignored.* ** Using just upvotes will insure the options remain hot so people can vote easily.  

I'm not guaranteeing a harsher ban policy will go into effect after this, but it's a big deal so I'd like a more scientific survey if possible.  The poll will also be left running a while to get a wide sampling. 

**The results of this poll may also effect how spoilers in titles are handled too.**
***
Since not everyone has the plugins to show up/down breakdown, I'll put current numbers here for reference:

* #1 (no change, 3+ warnings) - +49
* #2 (1 warning then ban) - +79
* #3 (don't do it or ban) - +11

**VOTING IS NOW CLOSED.  The results are above.  This will likely mean a new, tougher 1-warning policy for spoilers in thumbnails and titles.  If you wish to express any comments about that, please [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23gameofthrones).**

    [all]
    This was a triumph.
    I'm making a note here: HUGE SUCCESS
    It's hard to overstate my satisfaction.

    [all]
    Fans of G. Martin:
    We do what we must because we can
    For the good of all of us
    except for the ones who are dead

    [all]
    But there's no sense crying over every mistake
    You just keep on trying 'till you run out of stakes
    And the Game of Throne's done and you make a neat pun
    For the people who are still alive

    [the beheaded deserter]
    I'm not even angry
    [Viserys]
    I'm being so sincere right now
    [Robert]
    Even though you broke my heart and killed me
    [Ned Stark]
    And torn me to pieces
    [Mirri Maz Duur]
    And threw every piece into a fire
    [Kahl Drogo]
    As we burned it hurt because we were so happy for you!

    [all]
    Now these plots of stories make a beautiful rhyme
    And we're hoping DVDs get released on time
    [Drogo] So I'm glad I got burned (others sing : ""he got burned"")
    Think of all the things we learned
    For the people that are still alive

    [Lyanna Stark]
    Go ahead and leave me
    I think I prefer to stay inside
    Maybe you'll find someone else to help you
    Maybe White Walkers
    That was a joke, ha ha, fat chance
    Anyway this crypt is great, it's just so creepy and moist

    [all]
    Look at me still talking, when there's gaming to do
    When I look out there it makes me glad I'm not you
    I've got fantasies to spun, there is magic to be done
    On the people who are still alive

    And believe me we are still alive
    We're doing magic and we're still alive
    we feel FANTASTIC and we're still alive
    While you are dying we'll be still alive
    And when you're dead we will be still alive
    STILL ALIVE

I remember when the first fights started happening between Jaime and Ned or Bronn and Ser Vardis Egen, I was quite annoyed with those who were disappointed. The swordplay seemed spot-on to me, yet people complained of it seeming sluggish and poorly executed. 

However, now that we have reached the end of the season and war has erupted throughout Westeros, some people seem to be upset about the lack of combat scenes in the final few episodes. This annoys me, as the only battle that one would even get from a first-person account would have been very little in the beginning of Tyrion's battle in the vanguard. From what we all have read, this proved difficult to film and the makers decided to go a different route that, while not necessarily sticking true to form to the books, was fine. 

The Battle of Whispering Wood was read through the point of view of Lady Catelyn Stark as she awaited away from battle for Robb's return. This was, actually, one of my favorite scenes in the book. I believe the makers of the show did a wonderful job of adapting it to the silver screen, and if any of the battle was actually seen, it would take away horribly from the scene itself. 

I do not want this show to stray from George R.R. Martin's vision by trying to cater to a crowd that gets off on cheap action shots. Part of the appeal of the Song of Ice and Fire (at least to someone about halfway through aCoK) seems to be the ability to see the inner workings behind things like warfare. The reader gets a behind-the-scenes look at the political dealings and bargains that go into this war for the seven kingdoms, not the war itself. The makers of the show should stick true to how battles are written in the books (which so far they have done a decent job of doing). I fear if this desire for more action becomes commonplace, the makers of the series will begin to bend to their will.

So, discuss. Is there a place for large action scenes in the show? Should there have been more detail of them in the first season that go beyond what the books showed? Am I just being protective of something that I have come to love? I know that in an interview there was discussion about filming a huge battle scene in season 2. I hope it goes well and sticks to what the book describes it as. Don't get me wrong, I like a little swordplay just as much as anyone else. I just hate mindless action shots that serve no purpose other than a few viewers' simplistic bloodlusts. 

Also, for the love of the king, tag spoilers from the books. ",17,0,False,self,,,,,

*""Do you fear death?""*

*She bit her lip. ""No.""*

*""Let us see."" The priest lowered his cowl. Beneath he had no face; only a yellowed skull with a few scraps of skin still clinging to the cheeks, and a white worm wriggling from one empty eye socket. ""Kiss me, child,"" he croaked, in a voice as dry and husky as a death rattle.*

*Does he think to scare me? Arya kissed him where his nose should be and plucked the grave worm from his eye to eat it, but it melted like a shadow in her hand.*

*The yellow skull was melting too, and the kindliest old man that she had ever seen was smiling down at her. ""No one has ever tried to eat my worm before,"" he said. ""Are you hungry, child?""*

I think a few of those, Arya and Bronn, benefit from roles that come naturally. I'm fairly confident Maise feels very close to Arya and can just throw herself in the role. Bronn's job description is sarcastic dick, and if you've got a sarcastic dick streak in you, you're in a good position. I always felt that some of Ned's best scenes were with the kids, and he's a father himself. That sort of deal. I'd imagine roles like Viserys or Varys would be tougher, because you have to make yourself be a way you're probably not, and care about things that don't came as naturally.

Anyway, my top 5 are Viserys, Varys, Jorah, Robert, and Ned

The only one out of everyone that I've had a problem with acting wise is Sansa

People I find criticism for, the people playing -

Tyrion - He's got one of the best characters to play, with some of the best lines, but I just don't believe he's been as great in the role as everyone makes him out to be. And yes, I have noticed that he's a dwarf.

Renly - This might all be attributed to the fact they cut his balls off, it remains to be seen. 

Maester Aemon - He's got old dying man down pretty well, probably because he's an old dying man. His voice is like nails on a chalkboard

Catelyn - She's good, but she just has no range. She delivers all her lines in this sort of intense shuderring serious voice. 

Robert Arryn - I know he's a kid, but he sucked. 

Daenerys- She's good, but she tends to overact a bit. 

Everyone else has pretty much just been ""good"". Jon Snow, Theon, Samwell, Drogo, Joer Mormont (commander of the nights watch), Sandor, Cersei, Bran (want to see more from him), Robb, Jaime, etc...

It has a very similar feel to the timeline of ASoIaF, and you will be very similar to the storyline if you have played any of the Dynasty Warrior video games, as they are also based on the same epic.

The film has some good battles, so anyone who has complained about a lack of battles in GoT can satiate their hunger for medieval combat.  Also the climax of the film has a battle very similar to the Battle of Blackwater Bay in ACoK.

It also features some of the coolest battle tactics and trickery I've seen, it would make Tyrion Lannister proud.",5,10,False,self,,,,,

* Should I read the books?

* Should I read the books first or watch the series first?

* Can I skip Book 1 and just start reading Book 2?

* Are there similar books in the same genre that I might be interested in?

I completely understand that people are excited about the show and the books, and that's why there are so many posts about the same thing. But I honestly think some kind of a FAQ section would be extremely useful to new fans of the series, especially if they've never even heard of the books before the HBO show. 


Maybe the FAQ could just have a link to all of the posts already pertaining to certain topics? I don't know. There are excellent opinions and suggestions in many of these threads, but because there are so many posts of this nature, people get fatigued by it and don't respond as well by the time they see the same post for the sixth or seventh time. If you've typed out a well-written response to the question ""Should I read the books?"" in three posts already, the chances that you're going to take the time to do it for the next three posts are slim.


Sorry if this is a terrible idea, and I'm really not trying to rag on anyone who does submit these questions. I just think it would be beneficial if new fans knew their questions had not only been asked already, but have been responded to with great answers by people who are genuinely trying to help them.

(ep. 4-10 spoilers)",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/i7em2/ep_4_cripples_bastards_broken_things_after/,qp0n,1308855855,"**note: rather than block out the text I'm just going to blanket this as a general TV spoiler post.**

Just a little breakdown of why I was so impressed with this episode:

* **Sean Bean for your consideration** - Ned's 'detective-like' investigation of Jon Arryn's death is so well acted it's hard to describe. You can see just how quickly Ned caught on to what happened, who is lying, and how disinterested he is in hearing the lies that are clouding Arryn's death. Sean Bean's facial expressions during his inquisition with the Grand Maester are so perfect. Also, the look on his face as he looks into the face of Robert's bastard son is priceless. Re-watching this episode really deepened my respect for Bean's performance.

* **Tyrion the innocent &amp; empathetic** - I was stunned by how well Dinklage captured the essence of someone who has clearly learned not to judge anyone &amp; empathize with how one's history grows to define them, hence the title of the episode. The subtle hostility towards him by Robb Stark simply because he is a Lannister irritated him &amp; it showed. His gentle demeanor in the offering of the riding harness schematics to Bran really felt sincere and effectively made me feel like Tyrion clearly had many obstacles to overcome in his life. Also, in the last scene before Cat accuses him you can really tell that Tyrion is innocent. 

* **Ser Allister the misunderstood** - 'Drill sergeants' are never supposed to be gentle people but I thought the series was really trying to hammer him down as a cruel and uncaring bully... but his monologue @ Snow &amp; Sam made me feel like he is just a soldier that has seen hell and is now scared shitless. His bullying might be the best thing for them. Excellent scene.

* **Jorah Mormont the penitent** - I absolutely love his character and Iain Glen deserves praise. I think his conversation with Dany as they ride with the horde is under rated; he is clearly somewhat of a victim of his ex-wife's greed but he does not use it to justify his actions. He comes across as someone filled with regret &amp; accepting his own punishment. His description of the 'new people running the kingdom' (i.e. Ned) does a good job indirectly showing viewers that he has a long history from Westeros, the Starks, etc.. It feels like if under different circumstances, Jorah and Ned would have been great friends as they both similarly personify a code of honor.

* The foreshadowing in this episode is everywhere. King Robert's bastard as mentioned, Arya's declaration that she doesn't want to be a lady, the bard in the mead hall, the burning wax poured on Viserys, Tyrion's distaste for his family, Sansa's confrontation with death, etc..

* Another thing that struck me was that I think Varys may be the unappreciated good guy in all of the mess. Take note of his subtle mannerisms and expressions if you watch the series again. Whenever Ned does or says something unusually honorable (unusual @ court at least) he seems to have an expression of amazement and admiration. Almost as if he is relieved to see someone with integrity again, however he knows he must mask such admiration to keep his disguised ""role"". [Three good examples to keep an eye out for: when Ned offers 20 of his own men to the guard @ court in ep. 4, when Ned issues his sentence on The Mountain in ep. 6, and just after Joffrey demands Ned's head in ep. 9]

... My only qualms with ep. 4 is over-acting of Sam's character. He comes across far far far too timid and weak for someone to have grown up in that world. He would put real world beta males to shame, I just can't see anyone like that even surviving.",30,44,False,self,,,,,

- Characters who have been already cast IRL are fine. Same for characters who will almost certainly not appear in the actual show (eg. Dunk and Egg characters).

- Don't worry about logistics, like the fact that Natalie Portman isn't terribly likely to be within budget. Hell, you're welcome to bring up dead actors if you like (but do specify at what age).

- Try to stick to actors whose demographics give them a decent range of options. A woman in her eighties can play the Queen of Thorns, Old Nan, the Ghost of High Heart, and that's about it. A ""Summer Islander"" doesn't have that many options either.",81,15,False,self,,,,,

Ive read them a couple of times and I kind of resent the writer for the few times they let us down after announcing a release date (I wouldnt mind waiting, but I re-read the books to the announced 2008s release only to be let down by whoever was responsible)
When the first Lord of the Rings came out I was so invested I read the whole thing, and to the day I regret it, because it ruined the second and third film for me. 

The thing is: when you watch the show basically you get the main plot points because theres really little time. Reading the books afterwards gives you inside and nuisances about characters and situations, because of the little time to develop stories in ten episodes by reading after watching youll get what makes ones not so bad and others not so good, so you can really enjoy the reading and value the writing (side note: I have a friend who is a writer and he uses to read the end of the book first thing, I don't agree with this but he says plot doesn't interest him). You could even go back to the show and enjoy it from a new perspective: how the show managed certain things, what's different, and so on. 

On the other hand, once you have read the books you only get to experience part three of the aforementioned, that is: the adaptation. You wont be surprised and youll lose what is in my opinion the strongest part of the tv show: the plot (again, because of the little time they have). 
 
I know this because I read the books a couple of times and, while I still enjoy the show, it feels a bit boring-ish plot-wise (obviously). In fact I think many of the readers turned watchers are enjoying the fact that we know what's going to happen while many others don't (the same way you would enjoy watching the sixth sense with someone who doesn't know).

For readers out there, consider also this: a big part of Lost's success was not knowing what would happen in the end (as much of a rip off as it was IMO). I'm kind of afraid many people will be turn off from the show once they know all the plot and come season 2. 

*Tl,dr*: Watch and read: both things interesting. Read and watch: loses the plot's punches. The biggest thing the tv show has to offer: Plot (not time for more). The book enriches the experience of the watcher but it doesnt work the other way around. 

One last thing: Every time I suggest not to read the books I get downvoted and dont know why, I guess some people feel really strongly about what everybody else should do.

This only gets more pronounced in later books, if I remember correctly, especially after the Red Wedding.

I think that this is great characterization on GRRM's part- he makes Arya a deconstruction of that ""action girl"" idea, and actually focuses on the fact that, by wanting to be manly and learn to swordfight, she is learning ways to kill people. But I feel like this is often overlooked, by fans who just think that she's awesome, but overlook some of the disturbing implications of her chapters.

The changes are not done; this is just the first rollout of what's fairly set.  I hope you like them, and if you find anything out of place please let me know, thanks.

Rundown of current changes:

* **New header images with red theme.**  My original design for the header used red as you see today, but DafyddLlyr asked for a more Reddit-default orange version.  That's worked fine for a while, but since it was time for some improvements I went back to the original red that IMO better fits the focus of the subreddit.

* **Red, gray, and white.**  The overall theme is being converted to match the new main colors. The arrows and links have been changed, but you may note that visited links are currently still coming up blue/purple.  That reference bug will be fixed shortly. 

* **New redditor name format.**  The CSS hit the character limit last week, which prompted this whole overhaul.  I've drastically shortened the amount of CSS needed for the name+group+icon display while at the same time spiffing it up a little.  Ultimately the CSS size was nearly cut in half, so there should be a lot more room to grow for a while. 

* **Gray sidebar.** The sidebar I'd like to do more with, and at the moment it simply has a new gray backing.  The content was updated a few days ago, and there will be more to come.

* **New announcement bar.** The main announcement bar has been polished a good bit to match the rest of the theme.  

* **Subreddit home link.** The /r/gameofthrones logo can now be clicked to go to the subreddit home.  The alien on the throne still goes to Reddit's home, and the sigil shields still link to the subreddit home.


Definitely more to come.  Some CSS support for Reddit Enhancement Suite (RES) and Reddit Gold features will also be coming soon.  EDIT: and the Stylish addon!",38,34,False,self,,,,,

I was at an event before the show was aired earlier this year where George RR Martin was talking about the show and he mentioned that it just wasn't in the production budget to show such battle scenes (costs, time, ability).  In my opinion AGOT is on course to be as good (better?) than Lord of the Rings as THE medieval/fantasy story to LOTR as Star Trek is to Star Wars (purely my opinion/speculation) and the inability/lack of putting in such epic battle scenes is really disappointing to me.

* Lysa then spends the better part of the next 14 years in King's Landing (where Peter ends up after being sent away from Riverrun)

This is my first through of the book.  Started reading the series after the second episode of Game of Thrones. I can only assume I am in for a roller-coaster of book if tibxero wanted me to do this.  

I will try and hide all spoilers for those reading or those who will be waiting until Season 3 or 4 for HBO, but if you haven't read this far, then GTFO b.c there won't be any lady bits here.

I am just going to give my reaction and whatever random questions I have after each chapter.  Any suggestions, requests, or questions you want to ask then fire away.

The Prologue:

[book spoiler](/s ""Well, even before the prologue, I laughed at GRRM's dedication to Phyllis: Who made me put the dragons in.  As you can tell by my sigil, I thoroughly every chapter about the Night's Watch and anything beyond the wall.  However, there's one Chet I've liked and that was Chet Steadmen.  Small Paul is Lenny from Of Mice and Men, but instead of bunnies, it's ravens.  Also, was Chett going to just roll into Craester's Keep, kill him, and then start saying, ""All these wenches love me""? The most intriguing item of the prologue:  The Night's Watch attacking the Wildings like Mel Gibson in The Patriot.  The same group Snow is now apart of."")

Jamie's Chapter:

[book spoiler](/s""SEVEN HELLS!  A JAMIE POV!  This. Is. A-MA-ZING!  It's weird to me that I can read about brother sister incest it now doesn't faze me in the least.  Fun chapter just to read Jamie's thoughts.  Brienne seems to be bounded by honor much like Ned Stark was, hence the cutting down of the whores that killed.  Nice to see her actually do something as a ""knight"".  What do you call her?  For me, the biggest question still left unanswered since the first 100 pages of GoT, who hired the assassin to kill Bran in his bedroom?"")

Not too much happened, so nothing major, but any feedback from others would greatly be appreciated.

Varys and Littlefinger are much like incarnation of an Angel and a Demon, representations of God and the Devil.

Please bear with me.

They have much in common with each other, much as God and the Devil do: their divinity, the fact that they are removed in some essential way from all of westeros/mankind but have power in a very real way.

* They are both to a degree foreign, Varys is from Lys and Bealish's grandfather was Bravosi.
* Unlike almost any other characters (except for perhaps some examples from the nights watch and maybe the maesters) both are not tied to any of the houses by blood, not any true allegiance. 
* Both have access to almost EVERY secret of every other character.
* Both have a very invasive but very limited power. Most of their power is found in being relied upon for information, and in Littlefinger's case also money.
* Both are the councilmen of Kings.
* Neither are loved.
* Both keep secrets to themselves, as God and the Devil would, (consider the story of Job).
* They both flee from the council of kings when the kingdom starts falling apart with a Major character they choose to save.

They are also each other antithesis:

* Desire/Lust: **Varys** has no known carnal cravings. He seems in fact as sexually pure as a person may ever get, not even having genitals. **Littlefinger** owns a damn brothel and wants to conquer Catelyn (maybe Sansa).

* Motivation/Ambition: **Varys'** motivation seems unclear, he himself claims to want to 'serve the realm'. Whether this is true or not, he seems to want stability, has little desire for war and death, and conserves life when possible. However, it doesn't seem like he's in it for the money or comfort, it is shown how sober he lives and how dirty he gets himself. He has no personal Ambition.
**Littlefinger** seems wants to own the world. That and vengeance on Catelyn/Brandon, or at least sate his envy of Ned.

* Methods of Influence: **Varys** rarely tells a character a lie. He does withhold some crucial information it seems, but perhaps too much information would cause more grief that it would prevent. He is sparing with the information he gives away, but rarely seems to be luring anyone into a trap. **Littlefinger** is taking advantage of everything that comes his way and sows chaos wherever he goes, advising people to kill, framing people and planting the seeds of war for his own profits. Also he becomes popular/necessary among high lords because he redistributes money very well, the root of all evil.

* Personal Description: **Varys**: 'I serve the realm.' **Littlefinger**: 'distrusting me is the wisest thing you've done'

Let's look at their influence on Ned. Varys warns him of the danger his friend the King is in, and that the former hand knew too much. He later motivates Ned to confess for his daughter's sake.
After planting them himself, Littlefinger helps him find and unearth the seeds of war and then offers him to reach for the throne. When denied he betrays Ned.

Varys seems like the tortured individual who wants to save the world but remain unpartisan and rely on the goodness of others and not remove any free will, which would explain the erratic way he gives out his information and support.

Littlefinger seems like the devious selfish person who uses every existing grudge and character property to his own benefit if possible, and ultimately leaves destruction in his wake. 

Of course both characters are simply that, characters with a story and a human motivation (be it an extreme one in both cases), I just thought this was an interesting way they represented Good and Bad.",16,23,False,self,,,,,

What I mean is this:  Lots of (especially fantasy) stories happen when they do because they're telling some really meaningful event for their world.  Lord of the Rings takes place when it does because that's when an ancient evil is expelled for ever.  Harry Potter takes place when it  does because that's when Voldemort is finally destroyed.  Similarly for Star Wars, Redwall, and lots of other stories- they're all at a significant and extraordinary time for world events.

It doesn't seem like this is the case for Westeros, where this sort of political turmoil is really common.  Why is GRRM telling us about this world now?  It seems like the story, while captivating, isn't necessarily very extraordinary for the inhabitants of the world.

While Catelyn's impact on the overall story does not change, a lot of the more subtle parts do. 

For example, in the show she is far less cruel to Jon Snow as she is in the books.  In the books, another factor in Jon Snow going to the wall was the fact that, without Ned there, she would never allow him to stay in winterfell.  And of course, when he comes to say goodbye to Bran, she says: ""It should have been you.""

Also, Catelyn is the one to say originally that Ned must go to Kings Landing.  Even when he does not want to, she tries her best to convince him to go.  She takes a largely opposite role in the Show.

And based on the number of recent book cover posts, it seems like a sizable number of people have also had the chance to read through the series. 

For the most part, I think HBO did an admirable job of adapting a complex and already highly-regarded story that does not easily lend itself to TV/film, into an enjoyable show. But as a huge fan of the books and of GRRM in general, my expectations are high. And I feel that HBO made some decisions that I simply can't understand. 

I don't want to monopolize the thread, so I'll just offer a single example of what I'm talking about: 

HBO is horrible at dealing with issues of the ""unknown"" or ""supernatural,"" and apparently doesn't understand the notion of subtlety. This is particularly apparent in characters' discussions about the Others (white walkers) or dragons. The first season of the show is riddled with lingering camera shots of the dragon eggs and new (inserted) dialog about hatching dragons, all in a seeming effort to prepare viewers for what is to come.

That said, I'm trying to come to some predictions regarding the fate of Lord Arryn.

""1. Joffrey isn't Robert's son but is actually the son of Cersei and Jaime. Hence Arryn's last words of ""The seed is strong.""
2. I'm not sure of the chronology, but since incest is already on the table due to the Lannister twins and the Dragons' marriage traditions, I'm predicting that Snow is the son of Ned and his deceased sister (though I admit that this may be waaaaay off the mark). OR the son of Robert and Ned's sister... another idea.
3. I'm not sure if the Lannisters actually killed Arryn due to Catelyn's sister's willingness to execute any Lannister without trial. I think it may actually be Catelyn's sister who murdered him due to Arryn's decision to send the son away to ""man up"".

The guide below is intended to help you understand and use ""spoiler warnings"" with /r/gameofthrones.  There are two types of warnings:

* Spoiler warnings in post titles
* Spoiler covers in discussion text

Once a spoiler is warned about, it's your job as the reader to decide whether to read further.  

****
**Posts with ""Spoilers!""**

When browsing this subreddit you will see many posts with spoiler warnings explicitly written in the title.  They may look similar to one of these examples:

* Let's talk about this character [Spoilers!]
* Spoiler talk, what do you all think about this
* Predictions about the next book (Spoilers for book 5!!)
* Episode Discussion - 1.10 ""Fire and Blood"" [TV Spoilers]

In the above examples you can see some are specific about a book or episode, and others could be spoilers for anything in the show or books.  Take that warning to heart, because once a warning has been posted, any events covered under that warning can be posted without a cover.  Also note the spoiler range may also be further limited after the title in the OP text.  Please try to respect the range given in the title and OP, and use cover tags for any spoilers after that.

Please be careful with the word ""mild.""  A mild spoiler or speculation should not reveal any major plot points.  Major character events, twists, etc. should never be labeled mild, regardless of which book they occur within.  The term is a useful tool for telling someone the information is a spoiler, but without seeing the show or reading the book first the spoiler is unclear.  It's also ok to use it to describe background or incidental information that could be described almost as more ""setting"" than ""events.""
 
****
**Spoiler Cover Types**

When there isn't a title-warning about spoilers, or when a comment is outside the scope of the posted warning, a post should use cover tags.  There are three tags set up to cover spoiler information:

* **TV Spoilers** are specific events that have been aired on the show.  It doesn't matter if it aired 3 weeks ago or was shown live 3 seconds prior.  

* **Book Spoilers** include any events in any of the books.  Events in Book 1 that have not yet aired on TV are book spoilers.  Events in the books that differ from what has aired on TV is a book spoiler.  

* **Book Speculation** is discussion of not-yet-published events.  It's specifically designed to cover references to what might be coming up when the information deals with one of the many well-established theories (for example: Jon's mother's identity) often discussed online.  These ""figured out"" events are considered spoilers for readers unexposed to them, and that's where the speculation tag comes in. Speculation comments need cover tags even with the title warning ""spoilers for all books,""  but they do not need tags if ""speculation spoilers"" have been warned about in a post's title.

Events in the books that match past-aired TV events can be marked as either TV or Book Spoilers.

****
**How to Read Covered Spoilers**

To read a covered spoiler, just mouse over the colored text.  The spoiler text will turn white, allowing you to read it.  Try this example  below:

[Put your cursor here](/s ""Now you can read the spoiler"")

The coding has been tested it in Firefox, Chrome, IE, Safari, and Opera, and should work the same for most everyone. IE users may have problems with the coding; The trick used to create the safe spoilers does not work well with IE.  If you mouseover in IE  and wait a few seconds the pop-up title should contain the spoiler text.  If you still don't see the spoiler in the pop-up, then you will need to use one of the other browsers. 

If you see a tagged spoiler in a comment replies or use a mobile device browser to read the subreddit you should be safe from the spoiler.  It usually only shows the warning text in either case.

****
**How to Make Spoiler Tag Covers**

TV Spoilers look like this: [TV Spoiler](/s ""your text"") and are made this way:

    [TV Spoiler](/s ""your  text"")
    
Book Spoilers look like this: [Book Spoiler](/b ""your text"") and are made this way:

    [Book Spoiler](/b ""your text"")
 
Speculation Spoilers look like this: [Speculation](/g ""your text"") and are made this way:

     [Speculation](/g ""your text"")

Use the speculation syntax to cover up spoiler-type details or theories of what might be coming up in the books (for example: Jon's mother's identity). **NOTE: the old tag /? no longer works; please use /g instead.**

The only difference between the types is the ""/X"" part of the tag; that determines the color.  The text in the [brackets] describes the spoiler, and the spoiler goes in the ""quotes."" It's recommended you use the description text to specify the episode or book you are referring to like this: [ACOK Spoiler](/b ""read about events in book 2"").  If you need to post without a label, you can use a space for the description, and it'll look like the old tags: [ ](/s ""OMG you've just been spoileried!"").

****
**How to Make Long Covers**

The spoiler cover tags do not work across multiple paragraphs. For example, this does not work:

&gt; [Ep4 TV Spoiler](/s ""First part of a long spoiler. First part of a long spoiler. First part of a long spoiler. First part of a long spoiler. First part of a long spoiler. 
&gt; 
&gt; Second part of a long spoiler. Second part of a long spoiler. Second part of a long spoiler. Second part of a long spoiler."")

To create a longer spoiler you must use a separate tag for each paragraph like this:

[Ep4 TV Spoiler](/s ""First part of a long spoiler. First part of a long spoiler. First part of a long spoiler. First part of a long spoiler. First part of a long spoiler."")

[more from Ep4](/s ""Second part of a long spoiler. Second part of a long spoiler. Second part of a long spoiler. Second part of a long spoiler."")

****
There are no plans at this time to add more spoiler tag types.  If the system gets too complicated people will ignore it.  If you want to mark a spoiler as relating to a specific book, just say so in the description text.  You don't need a new color to let people know.

As most of us know, in the book, Dany's wedding night is much more consensual in than it is depicted on the HBO series.  Dany is seduced by Drogo during a romantic scene where she eventually gives in to his advances and they consummate their marriage.  This, everyone can agree on.

What we cannot seem to agree on is what follows the wedding night.  I believe that, based on this passage from the book, that Daenerys is raped violently on a nightly basis for at least several weeks following her marriage:

&gt;Even the nights brought no relief. Khal Drogo ignored her when they rode, even as he had ignored her during their wedding, and spent his evenings drinking with his warriors and bloodriders, racing his prize horses, watching women dance and men die. Dany had no place in these parts of his life. She was left to sup alone, or with Ser Jorah and her brother, and afterward to cry herself to sleep. Yet every night, some time before the dawn, Drogo would come to her tent and wake her in the dark, to ride her as relentlessly as he rode his stallion. He always took her from behind, Dothraki fashion, for which Dany was grateful; that way her lord husband could not see the tears that wet her face, and she could use her pillow to muffle her cries of pain. When he was done, he would close his eyes and begin to snore softly and Dany would lie beside him, her body bruised and sore, hurting too much for sleep.

&gt;Day followed day, and night followed night, until Dany knew she could not endure a moment longer. She would kill herself rather than go on, she decided one night...

The Dothraki way of life makes both Dany's days and nights utterly unbearable to the point where she contemplates suicide.

My opponent seems to think that this is all rubbish and that Daenerys is never raped by Drogo.  He believes that the pain she experiences is due entirely to size and that the sex that happens between Drogo and Dany cannot be considered rape because the word ""rape"" is never explicitly used by Daenerys.

He also believes that Dany begins to contemplate suicide, not because of Drogo's nightly rapings and the long hard day of saddle-sores, but because Viserys is cruel to her.

TLDR:  Please, give me your thoughts on what you think happens between Daenerys and Drogo *in the book* immediately following their wedding.  Was she raped, or was it consensual?  **Note that we are not discussing Daenerys' wedding night, only the nights that *follow*.**",31,8,False,self,,,,,

Why did Ned's brother (Benjen) take the black?  Did he do something wrong?  Was he ostracized like Jon?  Or did he just decide one day, ""Hey, I think I'm going to go celibate and hang out at a frozen glacier for the rest of my life?""

Now, if I'm not supposed to know this yet, don't tell me!  The reason I haven't looked it up is I don't want to spoil anything for myself (I already got spoiled by that New York Times bestseller list...), and I'm worried that looking up Benjen Stark in a Wiki would give me a lot of information I don't want yet.

But since he graduated two weeks ago and the book isn't out yet, I decided to present it in a crafty way: I hollowed out an old Tom Clancy book from the thrift store to make a book safe! I put a fake dust jacket to disguise it as the real thing. Here is what it looked like:


[the false cover](https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/260525_555475915309_65800390_31776793_3410073_n.jpg)

As you can see, the pre-order form for the real thing is hidden in the hollowed out book. :) I was particularly pleased to find this book at the thrift store because of its title, which almost sounds like it belongs in the book series to me.

It would also be fun to shout out something too upon hearing that name.

So what are some good, short associations with the house names? Lannister is easiest. Not sure on the others...

* Lannister = Twincest
* Stark =  (howl like a wolf)
* Targaryen = Trogdor
* Baratheon = Hail to the king
* Greyjoy = Release the kraken?
* Arryn = Falcon Punch!?
* Tyrell = Flower Power?
* Tully =
* Winter is Coming = So put your coat on

Probably a few too many but the ones that don't work out can be cut. I'm hoping Reddit can provide some good suggestions.",15,0,False,self,,,,,

To consolidate discussion all ""unofficial"" attempts to create a general discussion post will be removed. 

**Please be aware these threads will contain spoilers respective to the episodes they discuss.**  Example: A thread for season 2 episode 3 has open discussion of all show events without tags up to and including episode 3.  

**Book spoilers still need tags!** If it's not in the show, [tag it](/r/gameofthrones/iamws/).  Events from episodes *after* a topic's focus need TV tags if the later ep has aired; if it has not aired, the later events are book spoilers.

**[Live chat](http://www.seddit.com/?join=gameofthrones) is also available.**  The chat is essentially unmoderated and should be considered a participate-at-your-own-risk spoiler environment.

They say he is 17 when he kills the Mad King but do not say how long he had been with the guard. Why would Tywin let his son and heir take an oath like that? The guard is a brotherhood, sworn to protect the king until death. In joining the guard does Jamie loose his hold to Casterly Rock? Or when his father dies can he still go and become the Warden of the West?

Hope that the spoiler warning in the title was adequate and I wasn't supposed to spoiler tag this entire conversation. But if I was, and I messed up, let me know and I'll fix it.

But please, for anything else in Book 3, especially later on, please spoiler tag it. I already get the sense that something really huge is going to happen, and I'd rather not have that spoiled. 

Anyway, reaction, right. I just finished reading the trial by combat scene between the Hound and Beric Dondarrion, and I was really moved by it - more moved by that than by most of the other stuff that has happened in this book.

Back when I was about halfway into Book 2, one of my friends who is a big fan of the series asked me who my favorite character was. I had a hard time answering - I loved the show and the books so far, but a lot of the characters in SoIaF tend to surround themselves with a certain emotional distance, there's a lot of jumping around (so you don't focus as much on any one person), and I found the ambiguity around people's relationships, motives and what was happening to them made me less invested in any one character than I might otherwise have been.

This isn't a bad thing, of course, the stylistic choices that made me feel this way are a big part of what makes the books great, and I was invested in each of the characters in turn. But it did mean I didn't feel a really strong intuitive or emotional connection to any one of them - although that's probably just me.

But in the scene where the Hound fights Beric Dondarrion for the crime of killing the butcher's boy, I really felt connected to Sandor. Not because of the goodness or badness or justice or injustice of anything he did, not because what he was involved in happened for any of the right reasons, it was just this really strong emotional gut response.

The chapter is a tricky and very well-written one - at this point Martin knows you know his style, so there are layers of expectation as to what is going to happen. Because of the scene in the Eyrie with Bronn in GoT, you expect the Hound to beat Dondarrion and for Arya to be disappointed, just like her mom. 

But Martin knows you think that, and there's not much to be gained from writing that same scene twice. So the Hound probably isn't going to just beat Dondarrion in order to make Arya sad.

But it also seems way too obvious for Martin to just kill off the Hound at this point - the only purpose it would serve would be to reintroduce Dondarrion as a huge badass for showing up and killing a character you thought was strong. Martin doesn't really write scenes like that - this isn't Dragonball Z.

At this point, there's been so much death and mutilation and stuff, and so much sinister stuff built up around the Lord of Light, that you don't expect the fight to end without something bad happening, but it's not clear exactly what. The most likely thing seems to be there will be a horrible accident and somebody unexpected will die, like the singer or something.

Perhaps it's because I was kind of mentally busied by all the possible endings for the chapter that the Hound's agon and pathos kind of snuck in under my guard.

The Hound has asked people to kill him so many times at this point and is so clearly unhappy with what's been happening that, when his shield catches on fire and he shatters it - and then his *arm* catches on fire, it was poetic that he still had the will to live or win or whatever to still bring down that terrible overhead blow that breaks Dondarrion's sword and wins the fight.

The moment is heightened by the suggestion that the sword might have been Lightbringer - that one possible way for the chapter to end would have been having a horrible revelation about Dondarrion and the lord of light - but no, in this case, the sword shatters, the Hound is right and nobody is special.

But then, when he's crying because of the horrible burns on his arm and the memory of his childhood trauma, and the flesh is literally falling off his arm, and they stop Arya from trying again to kill him - it really puts in sharp, palpable relief what the Hound's struggle is all about - his struggle with his past, everything he's learned, and everything he has to do - and the way a lot of it is really *human*. 

So many characters in the books externalize what they feel like they need to do - there are so many obligations people feel and so many times people pass the buck on making decision authentically because of honor or family or tradition or politics or oaths or any number of other abstractions. The way the Hound denies so many of these abstractions and takes so much of it all on himself - while at the same time seemingly missing most of the beauty in the world and debasing himself and the people around him in the process - it's a tragedy, but it's a human tragedy.

It doesn't make him good, of course, he still was right hand man to a tyrant and an executioner of children. But there was an honesty and sublimity in this moment that really got to me.

The Hound is kind of like us - he shows up in the books all badass and confident, but he's under no illusions about the story of life and death and pain and exultation - he's a bit outside of the fantasy everybody else seems to be living in. He seems to like what he does an awful lot, even when he's complaining about it, and he's both very powerful and very vulnerable - he feels trapped, too, as we find out when he sympathizes with Sansa over her marriage to Joffrey.

And here he is going through something that the pretentious people around him think is probably some sort of purification, but is really just pain and awfulness -- and, and this is just speculation, but [Book Speculation](/? ""a new abusive, self-righteous master who's going to dick him around and enlist him in their brutality, just like the Lannisters did, and just like his brother"").

It seemed like every major scene in the book was used word-for-word as dialogue in the show.

However, what was the basis for the homo-erotic scenes between Loras and Renly?

Likewise, the scenes dealing with Theon Greyjoy and the prostitute/Osha don't seem to have any correlation to the books (or at least the first one). 

Are these scenes (and others) talked about in one of the other books that they wanted to lay down early? Perhaps simply devices to convey parts of the story that wouldn't be mentioned otherwise? Or are they just made up to up the sexuality inherent to HBO shows?",8,3,False,self,,,,,
