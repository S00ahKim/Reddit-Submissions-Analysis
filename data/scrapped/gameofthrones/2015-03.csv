1) Some choices didn't really matter :_( Example: Forging the letter ( I conquered Elaena Glenmore with my charm and some Ironwood) or Stopping Beshka from killing the man ( I know my uncle was proud of Asher being a leader and so, but still...)

2) [Mira's Fate](#p ""Mira may be coming back to Ironrath or wherever the wedding is. Tyrion says in the next episode preview: Good luck on the wedding I know that it could perfectly fit it to be the Purple Wedding, but I don't think they will give us the pleasure"")

3) I'm actually starting to have some hope. When the game series was announced I was completely sure Forresters wouldn't endure, but now, with me (Rodrik, lol) alive, Asher getting his sellsword rmy, Mira having Highgarden's favor and Royland and Duncan both being more respectful now that the Lord is back. Maybe after the Purple Wedding Margaery could tell Tommen to give us a hand.

4) I cannot understand why everybody helped the Coal Boy. Mira couldnt risk killing Damien, perfect excuse for she being charged of murder by Cersei. Even if you hide the body, the guard last saw him with Mira. Plus, we know the Coal Boy is alive, probably because another guard found Damien whilst holding him in the fountain (Pay attention when Mira flees, a guard is heading that way). 

5) And Lord Whitehill's daughter Gwyn introduced another POV to the conflict between Forresters and Whitehills. War seemed imminent, yet she suggests peace is an achievable objective. My opinion: this is fucking Westeros, honey, this ain't Candyland. Here men will fight and men will die.

This chapter was awesome, a clear 9.5/10, because it developed an amazing story with an elegance only Telltale could have matched. They gave us hard decisions, character development, action scenes and memorable quotes: Gared: Why are you here? Cotter: Fucking Potatoes Gared: You fucked potatoes?!

My new novel, ""The Pen is Mightier"", an homage/satire/love-letter to A Song of Ice and Fire, Game of Thrones, internet fandom, and George R. R. Martin himself, is published and for sale.  I'm proud to say that reddit (more specifically, a fictional subreddit that has a lot in common with r/ASOIAF and r/GameofThrones) plays a very prominent role in my book.
 
Here's the back cover blurb:

*College student Sedrick Weir is the biggest fan of the brutal fantasy epic, 'Those Accursed Chronicles'. Its author, Paul Breston, has created a unique series of novels rife with debauchery and betrayal, in which no character is safe.*

*Through a miraculous fluke, Sed is transported into the mythic world he loves so much. When he returns to his own world, he must convince Paul that his imagined realm actually exists. And if that world is real, can Paul keep killing people who are no longer merely fictional? Must Sed's favorite characters really have to die?*

*Both satire and homage, 'The Pen is Mightier' is a love-letter to one of the most popular series and television programs in the fantasy genre.*

(end blurb)
 
For any John Scalzi fans, this book is kind of like ""Red Shirts"", except its targets in loving mockery are A Song of Ice and Fire and Game of Thrones rather than Star Trek.  In all seriousness, this novel was written for YOU (and me).  It was written for those of you who, like me, love ASOIAF and/or Game of Thrones so damn much that you spend a lot of your free time poring over plot theories (even the tinfoil variety!), casting announcements, hints from author/producers/cast, and general minutiae from the series.  It's for those of you who have the maps of Westeros and Essos on your wall, and when you happen to see a feature or a city that looks interesting, you google it (or have a searchbot find it in the book texts) to see if it's mentioned.  It's for those of you that not only regularly check the GoT and ASOIAF wikis, but actually contribute to them.
 
It's for everyone that desperately hopes Wyman Manderly will make it into the TV show :)
 
""The Pen is Mightier"" is my second novel.  It's available as an ebook ($3.99) at Amazon [here](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00U2L6SU8), and at Smashwords [here](https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/522185).  You can check other online retailers as well.  The paperback ($14.99) is for sale at the Amazon link.

It's one of the biggest events of modern television, and a grand achievement for the medium. HBO, knowing it's their most popular show in the network's history, decides to dedicate one ten-episode season to showcasing one of Westeros's many key conflicts and events. It could be *anything*; Aegon's Conquest, Robert's Rebellion, even the Blackfyre Rebellion. What would you like to see and why? 

I have two choices, but for a ten-episode season I don't think one of these is feasible. That would be the Greyjoy Rebellion. I think it would be nostalgic for everybody, and quite invigorating, to see all of their favorite characters working together. The burning of Lannisport and Tywin's rage at this, Stannis taking on the Greyjoy fleet like a badass, Robert and Eddard, still in their prime, Jory Cassel and Jaime and Barristan joining the fray with goddamn Thoros of Myr charging in with his flaming sword. And then its finale would be Ned taking young Theon home to Winterfell. But the reason why I don't think that would be feasible is because of a) the budget, since it would be pretty much half a season of 'Blackwater'-type episodes, and b) there would have to be a lot of padding to make it ten episode. The Greyjoy Rebellion was a very short-lived conflict, mind you.

My other choice would be the 'Dance With Dragons'. Again, budget up the wazoo, but it's just such an epic and tragic story that simply retelling it to you guys won't do it justice.

Knowing this I've come to think about how it could go. 

Because we have the whole Bran and the Children thing going on, magic and what not. Throwing fireballs if I remember. Then you have the whole white walker situation, the dragons.

I don't know any of the story outside the show and the first two books but is there some way we could see Bran controlling dragons to destroy the whitewalkers? Because like... They're kinda hard to kill. They need to be burnt to stay dead and Bran is north of the wall already so we'd need to understand why exactly the dragons end up above the wall. WHICH I HAVE AN IDEA ABOUT. 

Before we go there I just have to say.. If this show is going towards an epic finish, everyone uniting, everyone dying, white walker battles, dragons everywhere, dragons eventually reaching Kings Landing (hopefully).... They are really going to have a high, high budget. 
This is ahead of the show or even in the show without you knowing about it but it's a theory I have so don't read if you want to figure it out on your own. (It's in relation to Jon Snow's mother.)

[] (#s ""So Jon Snow has no mom yet in the books right? And well. I can't exactly remember how I came to the conclusion but I after connecting Robert to Lyanna, then Lyanna had a connection to the Targaryen's right? Rhaegar I think? Then 'A song of Ice and Fire' so.. Am I right, at least in the ball park of thinking Jon Snow is somehow related to Dany? Now I understand it's all just theories right now but after enough evidence can you figure it out? I've heard there are forums everywhere but I'm afraid to go there. Spoilers and all."") 

I just realized I made this post to talk about the differences the show could have to the book and ended up just ranting on about something else. 

I just meant.. The show could go full hollywood and do everything I've said and then the books could come out, and be really relaxed (as relaxed as Martin can write). So I am honestly happy they're going to be finishing first, it gives them room to work around the story, although I've heard they're already doing that pretty well. ",8,0,False,self,,,,,

As book readers know, in a A Dance with Dragons, Tyrion is taken to Illyrio's house before he is sent on a boat down the river Rhoyne with a boy who may or may not be Aegon, Rhaegar's son who was thought to have been killed by the Mountain that Rides, before eventually getting abducted by Jorah. While Jorah is bringing him to Daenerys as a kind of peace offering, they are both captured by slavers and sold into servitude. 

We know from the preview he makes it to Illyrio's house (we see him talking to Varys in a very similar set to the house where Daenerys stayed in episode 1), and that on the way there Tyrion was cooped up in a box until he arrived. The newly released poster shows Tyrion standing at the stern of a boat ""seeing"" Drogon through the fog. While I see Drogon more as a metaphor for heading towards Daenerys, I think that the fact that he is standing at the head of the boat is very telling. 

While a lot of people is the ASOIAF and GoT community have conjectured that the show will cut Tyrions boat cruise down the river Rhoyne, I see this as confirmation of that cruise. I still think that the inclusion of Aegon may be iffy, but is quite possible that the trip itself is still included. There is actually a great scene in ADWD where the boat is attacked in the fog by men who are seriously afflicted with greyscale, the disease that scarred little Shireen's face. Fingers crossed this makes the cut into the show. 

What do you think? Will Tyrion take a boat to Dany down the Rhoyne? Is this any possible hint st Aegon's inclusion?",9,13,False,self,,,,,

Highgarden or Sunspear 

Baby isn't it clear 

Riverrun or Storm's End


Sitting around the bend 

King's Landing...


Off the coast of Essos,

There's a place called Westeros

That's where you wanna go

To win or die in the game


Bodies in the field

Going to maesters to get wounds healed

Starks and Lannisters fight

With bow and arrow, spear and sword and shield

Down in Westeros


CHORUS

Winterfell, King's Landing 

Ooh you could be standing 

In Highgarden or Sunspear 

Baby isn't it clear 

Riverrun or Storm's End

Sitting around the bend


Ooh I wanna take you down to Westeros

We'll go to Pyke, hang with the ironborn

You'll play the game of thrones way down in Westeros


The Rock or Tarth 

The Dreadfort or Last Hearth


We'll go to the Wall

Maybe a joust with Ser Duncan the Tall

or we can go a feast

Of lemon cakes in Summerhall




Don't go to the Twins


Those Freys have many sins

Just want to defend their kin

Get hitched and maybe they'll let you in

Way down in Westeros


CHORUS 

Winterfell, King's Landing 

Ooh you could be standing 

In Highgarden or Sunspear

Baby isn't it clear 

Riverrun or Storm's End 

Sitting around the bend


Ooh I wanna take you down to Westeros

For good King Stannis head to Dragonstone

Flying through the Moon Door way down in Westeros


Ashemark, The Vale

The Neck and Duskendale

LUTE SOLO


Everybody knows a little place like Westeros 

Now if you wanna rule and take the Iron Throne

Go down to Westeros


CHORUS 

Winterfell, King's Landing 

Ooh you could be standing 

In Highgarden or Sunspear

Baby isn't it clear 

Riverrun or Storm's End 

Sitting around the bend


If you wanna get away from Westeros

Just find a ship and then sail to Braavos

Valar morghulis to all in Westeros

All art/craft works inspired by GOT are welcome, so most things posted to this subreddit are ok there.  That includes costumes, sketches, baking, music, poetry, paintings, metalwork, cooking, woodwork, etc.  They don't want fanfic or work that's based on book-only events.  You can also [browse existing submissions](https://www.gameofthronescompendium.com/app/explore) on the site to see what's been submitted the last few weeks.

Here's a quote from HBO about the Compendium:

&gt; The Game of Thrones Compendium site is an official, creative space for fans of the HBO series to showcase their passion for the show. All fan submissions will be viewed by the Council and their favorites will be curated into a printed compendium. If your piece is included you will receive a copy of the book. It will not be for sale.

All submissions will remain on display at the website.  The pieces selected as the ""best"" in the Compendium are going to be published in a print book that will be given to those winners.  I suspect HBO will also use the print book as a special gift similar to [other creative promotions they've done in the past](http://scentmarketingdigest.com/2011/03/24/hbo-spends-a-bundle-on-scent-kit-to-promote-game-of-thrones/).

And why do you think it will play out in such a way? S1-S4 semi spoilers",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/2xx4xd/show_theories_for_the_fellow_nonbook_reading/,Mel_Gibsons_Sanity,1425486602,"My theory is that it will be Tyrion Lanister.  Partly because I want him to.  My reasoning is probably rather simple but many book readers I have given it too actually hope I am right.

Theory (not tagging because it's based strictly on the show and it's pure speculation):






My Theory is kind of 2 parts on why Tyrion.  The first is the conversation Tywin lannister had after Joffery died, when he went on about what makes a good king.  And all the answers like just, faithful etc were ""wrong"" and he gave responses as to why these seemingly strong and positive traits were wrong.  So to me that eliminates a lot of characters.  Stannis uses the God of light too much, Dany is too just, when she should use mercy (i'm thinking hanging the slavers on posts like the kids, and then it had a slight backfire)  As well as I think her dragons won't be in her favor later in the show because I think Bran will fly them, and not allow her to kill so many people of his country or something to that affect.  Petyr would seem like a good fit, be he is consumed by wanting power.  Tyrion is the most neutral character whose ""weaknes is tits and wine"", which is seemingly not all that bad compared to the rest when it comes to leading the kingdoms and protecting the realm compared to the others.  

The other part of this theory is the one I tend to see book readers love that I come up with.  Again, it's pure speculation.  But my theory is that most if not ALL the gods in the show, are real.  Yes, I am thinking all these gods, the old and new, the god of light and darkness exist and all play a part in the story.  A few examples of why I think this.  Pretty much everything Melisandre says, comes true (for the most part) and for crying out loud she birthed that thing.  She also stared in to Arya's eyes and say all those colors of eyes of dead people staring back at her (she becomes a faceless woman maybe and completes her list?) for another foreshadowing example.  You also had a lot in season 4 people saying the tales from the gods adults told children were just tales to scare kids, but some have surfaces like the giants and such.  Plus you have things like the trees (forgot what they are called, but the white ones with the faces), so this leads me to believe the old Gods are present.  That combined with the thing Cat stark makes, which she said she made 3 times to help her kids, has worked all 3 times, 2 we know for fact.  Brandyn lived, the girls are still alive and ""safe""  So these little hints if you will, lead me to believe, in the world GoT takes places in, there are more than one God, so they might just all actually be real.

So how do I think those things will all play together?  Well tyrion seems to be the character who is always going through hell and back, and becomes stronger and a little more wise each time, be he also gets just a little more abrasive.  He has killed a few people, but none have been senseless if you will, he can both merciful and just.  He doesn't rely on the gods where int eh show, it plays him off as one of the more atheist characters, but he is still a good hearted and fair man for the world this story takes place in.  Then you have little hints like Varys telling tyrion a small man can cast a large shadow and things to that affect.  Varys seems to be favoring Tyrion of Petyr and I think that is a huge huge deal since Varys is only concerned with nothing, but the realm.  I combine that with the God's, if the gods are seemingly helping those that believe in them, the fight for the throne becomes a God's battle, but why would they do that when all the Gods could let or help together one of the few people who would be good with power, and doesn't desire it?  Tyrion doesn't reject the Gods, he just doesn't follow them and worship them blindly, so he is not favoring one over the other, so I would assume they don't dislike him.  Maybe they are the ones who keep helping him get out of all these situations in different parts of the map.

So there you have it, my personal, wishful thinking, show only theory. Everything is based of context and dialog from the show only with some wishful thinking and hopes behind it.  

TL:DR I think Tyrion wins because he is the least ""flawed"" (ruler wise)  character who keeps overcoming the odds, so it's a positive moral story.  He is not fighting for the throne, but would be good with it (like that saying those who want power tend to be the ones who are bad with it).  His ruler weaknesses (tits and wine) don't harm/kill others like the other trying to obtain the throne.  He will get the backing of all the God's in this world because he is not favoring one over the other and this allows the Gods to not play favorites and determine the throne with their own believers.  I obviously think Tyrion will get other help and stories will change and so on.  But as long as he is alive and has Varys helping and backing him, I think he wins based on being one of the more nutral, just, merciful and intelligent characters in the show who also happens to have a name of power and is already known by most people in Westeros.

What are your thought on who wins, why and how?



EDIT:  Many of you keep bringing up the claim to the throne, which I understand.  But I would also add I don't think it actually means much in the show (otherwise why would Petyr be gunning for the throne?).  But can someone whose read the books, without spoiling, tell me how teh Targarians had the throne in the first place?  I mean did that always have it since the beginning of time there?  Did they rebel with Dragons and take it?  I don't recall in the show ever hearing that the Targarians should always rule and always have, IIRC, they took it with dragons (don't know from who, etc).  I just feel if they took it, then the whole claim to the throne is kind of a moot point, because that family would be usurpers themselves.",78,13,False,self,,,,,

I received a few PM's and questions about it so I thought it'd be fun to share it here (league's also open for sign-ups if anyone is interested).

# Basic Fantasy League Explanation

The idea of the Fantasy League is fairly simple and similar to Fantasy Leagues for real-life sports like football, baseball, etc. Every player has a team, and before the season we hold a draft to pick characters from the show - those characters will then earn points for your team for doing certain things on the show, like killing people, drinking wine, or saying 'Hodor'. There's a few different scoring formats, but the basic idea is that the team with the highest number of points at the end of the season wins.

# Scoring Categories

So what can a Game of Thrones character do to earn points? There's 7 categories for scoring that we're using:

 * **Kills**: A point for every kill, half point for every major injury
 * **Insults and Funny Lines**: Anything that's a witty insult, intimidating threat, serious burn, or is just plain funny (this is our super-subjective category that causes lots of debates).
 * **Acts of Intercourse**: Any sex or nude scene. Being nude in a sex scene stacks points.
 * **Glasses of Wine Consumed**: Every alcoholic substance that is drinked.
 * **Political Wins**: A catch-all category for, for lack of a better phrase, ""playing the Game of Thrones"". This includes stuff like gaining a new title or castle, getting married, imprisoning another character. This is a category made for likes of Tywin, Varys, Littlefinger, etc - characters who are power players but don't get too involved in the other stuff.
 * **Deaths**: A consolation category - you get points when your character dies.
 * **Special**: To spice things up, almost every character has a ""special ability"" that earns them points. Joffrey gets a point for every slap received. Hodor gets a point for every 'Hodor' he says. Maester Pycelle gets a point if he walks 5 consecutive steps without stopping (not sure this last one has happened yet).

There were a few balance adjustments along the way to take into account certain events happening more or less often than others. So for instance Glasses of Wine have a 3x multiplier (so 3pts per glass), while Sex/Nudity had a 5x multiplier (so 10pts for a nude+sex scene).

The full list of characters (and their special abilities) is listed here: www.fantasora.com/game/1/season/2/chars

If you're really interested in knowing how the points are recorded, there's a super-detailed rulebook here: www.fantasora.com/rulebook#scoringInfo

# Scorekeeping Website (www.fantasora.com)

We got into the fantasy league idea enough that we ended up with a website for keeping track of teams and all of the scoring. You can find that site here: www.fantasora.com

Some other neat links from S1: 

 * Full list of points from S1: www.fantasora.com/league/14/eventlog
 * Full table of character points from S1: www.fantasora.com/league/14/chars
 * The character leaderboard at the end of S1 ws:
    1. **Tyrion Lannister**: 117pts
    1. **Daenerys Targaryen**: 87pts
    1. **Robert Baratheon**: 63.5pts
    1. **Ros**: 63pts (60 of them from sex scenes)
    1. **Eddard Stark**: 62.5pts
    1. **Khal Drogo**: 61pts
    1. **Jon Snow**: 52.5pts
    1. **Varys**: 46pts
    1. **Cersei Lannister**: 44pts
    1. **Joffrey Baratheon**: 32.5pts

If you're interested, we're in the midst of our S2 rewatch currently - you can create your own private league with friends (or maybe we can have a public /r/gameofthrones league?)

I'm the scorekeeper for our league, so if you guys have any game balance thoughts or fun ideas for new special abilities, feel free to chim in!

Despite biased searching through this sub, /r/asoiaf, and the entirety of the Interwebs, I can't find any evidence that gives me hope that we'll ever see LSH on the big screen.

Let's (sadly) assume that is the case...no LSH on the show, ever. Then, what was the purpose of introducing the Brotherhood Without Banners and showing Beric and Thoros and the Lord of Light's resurrection powers? It made for interesting TV, but I've heard over and over that LSH is cut because her impact would be so minimal given that the show is limited to 10 hours per year of storytelling time. Yet they spent a good chunk of that limited 10 hours in Season 3 showing BwB and displaying to us that people can be brought back to life. We saw none of them in Season 4, and I haven't heard that they'll be back for Season 5. So...why even include them at all? What is the BwB's purpose in the show if LSH is completely cut out? The *only* reason I can think about is if Jon get's his stabby stabs this season, the viewers would have some hope that he can be brought back given Beric and Thoros's ability to do the same.

I just realised I'm quite uncertain on how to phrase this, but whatever, here goes nothing!

I have read ""a game of thrones"", ""a clash of kings"" and ""a storm of swords"". I really liked those books, a lot. However, when I began reading ""a feast for crows"", I was unfortunately interrupted in my literary escapades by something we all know and fear: school. The schoolwork consisted of many different, dreadful and disastrous doings for my own part. This included reading other books (which in itself is no problem, mind you). Since then, some two years have passed, and I'm thinking of diving back in to this amazing world. However, I have forgotten how the last book ended, regarding the main characters.

Now that I have wasted your time, I might as well waste some more by requesting a recap of what happened in the end for all main protagonists. I do not need the entire story written out, just what was the last big thing that happened, and maybe some relevant background info. For instance: ""John was chosen as commander of the nights watch, after the big fight at the wall"" (if memory serves). I realise this might be a difficult request, but I have faith in all you wonderful people! Any and all answers would be greatly appreciated, and you would forever have my thanks :) 

I really hope that I have tagged and written correctly, seeing as this is my first ever post.

We know Season 5 Episode 9 will include a pit of some sort. During a brief shot in the Season 5 trailer, we see a bunch of people in it. If you look closely you can see The Unsullied and Missandei in the shot. Later we see a bunch of people being attacked by people in golden masks. If you look closely you can see The Unsullied.

Now, not saying that I have any concrete evidence to support this theory or my continuation of the theory but I did find it very interesting to contemplate. My first thought when I read the bit about how obsidian kills the others but we don't know why... IF this theory is correct and they other are just re-animated first men who died of a severe Grayscale infection, then it seems that it would make sense that obsidian would kill them because, from what I understand, obsidian in this realm is just dragon bone and dragons are fire made flesh. So, if Grayscale needs the cold and the damp to be deadly and infectious then if someone who was severely infected such as the Others was pierced with what is essentially fire solidified into stone, then it makes perfect sense that it would have such a detrimental effect on someone whose body was so consumed by the disease. I am interested to hear what other fanatics have to say about this.",0,1,False,default,,,,,

Now, anyone who's read the books and watched the show has probably noticed that Jeyne Westerling, Robb's wife in the books, has been replaced by Talisa in the TV show. We also know that Talisa is killed in the Red Wedding in the TV show, but in the books Jeyne Westerling simply rides off after Robb's death and we haven't heard from her since. In the books, the possibility remains that Jeyne could be bearing Robb's son, but in the TV show, this is clearly not a possibility. If David and DB already know what's going to happen from GRRM, would this remove any possibility of a little Robb occurring in the books?

After contacting your subreddit moderators, I was graciously given permission to share our fundraising efforts with you!

I help run WesterosCraft, a project that is recreating the entire continent of Westeros in minecraft. We are a part of the GRRM network on reddit; you may have also seen some of our stuff on reddit.
I post this thread to request support in our effort to get WesterosCraft a booth at the upcoming Rooster Teeth Convention in Austin, Texas. We are not heirs to the gold of Casterly Rock and we can't afford the Iron Price, so we have set up an Indiegogo page to gain your support for the booth. Anyway, the page does a better job of explaining (complete with a quick narrated video explaining our project and fundraising efforts). If you can't donate, sharing this wherever you see fit is equally helpful. Any support provided is thoroughly appreciated!

392,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2015-3-8,2015,3,8,11,2yav6x,self.gameofthrones,[S5/AFFC][Start of ADWD] Regarding Jaime's storyline in S5...,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/2yav6x/s5affcstart_of_adwd_regarding_jaimes_storyline_in/,skiumah8,1425782655,"Although the S4 finale was a great episode of television, I felt it could have been even better with the Tysha reveal and subsequent reaction.  While Jaime and Tyrion leaving as brothers was nice, their break is a crucial element of Jaimes and Tyrion's arcs - Tyrion kills Tywin and risks discovery only out of anger about Tysha's death and clearly feels regret for his treatment of Jaime in ADWD, and Jaime... becomes an entirely different person.  Particularly shocking to him is the line, ""she's been fucking Lancel and Osmund Kettleblack and probably Moon Boy for all I know,"" which is in his thoughts for the entirety of AFFC.  This is the primary motivation for his mistrustfulness and eventual abandonement of Cersei to her own devices.  After reading ASOS, I thought Tysha should have been brought up to provide better motivation for Tyrion.  After reading AFFC, I think it is vital she should have been brought up.  Her mention is what insprires Tyrion to attempt to hurt Jaime through his relevation that Cersei was lying with others, which in turn inspires Jaime to drift away from her and eventually throw her plea for help in the fire (which would be a badass season finale). Also, the ""fucking Lancel and Osmund..."" quote is repearted by Jaime throughout AFFC and creates the whole ""Jaime wants to question Lancel"" arc; in my opinion, Benioff and Weiss are really restricting their creative abilites by excluding this scene, but I still trust they can pull it together based on their success with other shortened arcs and their close relationship with GRRM and his advice.  Just my 2 cents... what does everyone lese think?

EDIT: According to the trailer, Jaime does not (at least immeadiately) go to the Riverlands, but instead to Dorne with Bronn (another change). Forgot about that.  Do you guys think Jaime could learn of Cersei's behavior from some other means, and he and/or Bronn take the role of Arys Oakheart or Darkstar from the ""crown Myrcella"" storyline?",8,11,False,self,,,,,

That's it. After climbing over the Wall, give Jon and his band of Wildlings a scene in the night when they're camping. Have them gathered around a fire, Tormund maybe tell a story, and maybe actually get one of those rare Jon Snow smiles. Why do I think this? Because I think it would have greatly benefited Jon's story and lent weight to his inner struggle to abandon the Wildlings for the Watch. 

The show did a decent enough job, but I just think it would have been more compelling for the viewers of Jon had more of a connection with his new Wildlings brethren. On top of that, it would have emphasized the sort of brotherhood Wildlings share like real people, which was one of the major points Jon's story was trying to make in ASOS. We never really got anything like that in the show, at least not out of a couple moments between Tormund interacting with Jon and/or Ygritte. 

This was just an idea I got on my rewatch of the series preceding season 5, and in the scene where Jon is tasked to kill the old man and Ygritte does it for him when he hesitates, when Orell points out the hard truth that Jon is still a man of the Watch, we see Tormund, the leader of the band, looking *very* hesitant and uneasy before blurting out ""Kill him!"" I was thinking after watching that, ""Man, it would have been great if we got a real brother-brother scene between Tormund and Jon."" 

Ah well. Season 5 will hopefully get some scenes like that, and maybe hear the legend of Tormund's legendary member. ",17,34,False,self,,,,,

So a while ago I posted on this subreddit asking for some help on playing my character, Petyr Baelish, in a model UN setting right before the War of the Five Kings (Here is the link to that: http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/2xpngo/all_spoilers_everything_my_school_is_doing_a_game/ ). 

HOW THE GAME WORKED

Here is a bit about how the conference actually worked. There were 4 sessions where multiple crises occurred during each. The Houses/People that were initially represented (there was some shake ups during the whole thing) by my classmates were House Lannister, House Martell, House Tyrell, and my role as Master of Coin. There was a crisis committee of a few college students who represented all the other Houses, forces, and people of Westeros and beyond. There were chairs to keep it like an actual Model UN setting; however because there were only four delegates there it was incredibly loose and the parliamentary procedure section of the whole deal wasn't incredibly important. We were all given a designated amount of money and troops to use at our disposal (I however received an extensive network of informants instead of troops, also whomever controlled the kingdom had control over propaganda). Also, if a house became conquered or irrelevant or someone died, then the delegate would select a new house to represent that was still in the picture.

WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED

SESSION 1 

So we began with the Lannisters on the Throne. They quickly forged an alliance with House Tyrell promising that eventually Joffrey would be married to Lady Margaery. The Lannisters also used the advantage of having Gregor Clegane captive to reel in House Martell as an ally. Of course I, Petyr Baelish, remained ""loyal"" to the throne. Stannis began a 40,000 strong march on King's Landing and also blockaded the port with a fleet of warships. At the same time Robb Stark marched on the fairly unguarded Casterly Rock. The three houses who were delegates chose to call 40,000 troops of their own to King's Landing before Stannis could get there (they also had 20,000 more Tyrell soldiers headed incase of a prolonged siege). I sensed that Stannis might kill me if I did not outright pledge loyalty to him so I secretly formed an alliance with him and fed him enough information to capture Tommen and Lady Margaery, who tried to escape in secret from King's Landing. The 3 Kingdom alliance formed an incredible battle plan to destroy Stannis' ships in an effective way using Wildfire and ended up winning the battle at King's Landing - from that point named ""The Battle of the Night Fire"". The Lannisters still believe I am on their side at this point as well. This Ended the 1st of Four Sessions. --- at this point in the typing I want to see how many people pay attention to this and to see if they want a continuation of what happened or not. If this receives enough attention, I'll finish the post at a later time (plus I'm super tired and I'm not even a fourth of the way through the material I need to explain).

To look at a brief summary of what all went down, you can visit this twitter page where they posted many of the updates as the sessions went on: https://twitter.com/wlumodelungot . Again, shit got real. Anyways let me know if yall wanna hear the rest! P.S. so long as one person wants to hear the alternate series of events and wants me to continue, I will.

SESSION 2
 
So at this point we have reconvened for the 2nd of sessions. Stannis immediately sends a message saying that he will not be easily defeated. Due to Stannis defeat the Martells, Tyrells and Lannisters begin a massive march on Casterly Rock to fend off Robb Stark who then choses to retreat to the Riverlands and not really do anything because we have a massive amount of troops and there would be little point in continuing to march. Stannis begins threats to burn the hostages if there is not concession of the throne, but other than that it is pretty much quiet from him as he rides south. While this is going on Lisa Arryn mysteriously (and as far as I can tell, miraculously falls through the moon door and Nestor Royce becomes protector of the Vale (the Vale has remained neutral throughout this and we contacted them very little). The 3 allied families see this as a good time to march on storms end with about 70,000 troops. Stannis lost close to 10,000 leaving him at around 30,000. We had recently received a statement from the Iron Bank saying that we were deeply in debt and that they would begin to fund our enemies if we did not submit a plan to deal with this. Initially I had offered the bank their own borrowed money to try and trick them in exchange for promise as Lord of Storms End and Sansa Stark. The iron bank picked up on this trick and said they needed some other form of plan. Baelish did not get either of the promised things because of the rejected down payment, however because there is a port at Storms End we figured that we could capitalize on that and create a tariff there once we conquered Storms End. This seemed jolly and perfect until my friend, acting as house Martell, stabbed the alliance in the back and attacked the Tyrell soldiers they were marching with, pretty much obliterating 15,000 or so of the Tyrells troops. House Martell and Stannis began a march on High Garden. Since the Tyrell troops had committed to helping Kings Landing and Casterly Rock they were all mobilized but on the other side Westeros pretty much. At this point, once they reached High Garden they surrendered to Stannis, who awarded Martell with large plots of southern reach territory making Dorne much larger. This is where Ill stop for this part, but be expecting 2 or 3 more updates soon. 

SESSION 3

First thing that happened was Jamie was freed, and more Lannister troops were available. I, Baelish, sensed that it might be a good idea for me to sneak out of Kings Landing at this point, since the last time I was in Kings Landing during a battle I had to maneuver a tricky situation of who to side with outright and how to secretly ally with the Baratheons. Due to some miscommunications on part of the Lannisters, prior to my decision to leave I had ended up having Sansa Stark. The Lannisters were working on getting Robb Stark to leave them completely alone and Robb would only accept that offer if we could return Sansa and Arya. The Lannisters claimed that I had abducted Sansa and it seemed I might die if I did not surrender her, so I did. I helped the Lannisters clarify to the Starks that the location of Arya was unknown and we could do nothing about it. Robb then agreed to these terms and he was officially the independent King in the North. Now that the ordeal with Sansa had blown over I chose to spring on it and head to the Vale to give my condolences to Sweet Robin. I was no longer in peril of Kings Landing attacks. Pretty much as soon as I left, Joffrey was mysteriously poisoned. There was no king on the throne at this point. Using my informant, I ended up learning that a group of rebel Greyjoys had been the murders, but we assumed that this would be an isolated incident involving them (NOTE- we were idiots). Stannis then ended up gathering up all of the troops from the Tyrells  I should point out that at this moment since Stannis controlled the Tyrells the delegate who controlled them had to switch over to House Arryn and represent them. Since Joffrey was dead now and Stannis has Tommen, he executed Tommen, making him the rightful heir to the throne whether or not you believed in the incestuous love affair between Jamie and Cirsei. The Lannisters were pretty much stuck in a corner with little to do. I came in secret contact with Stannis again and told him I was willing to help him win the throne again. For some reason (the kid was kind of confused) when Stannis demanded that the 5 (no longer the north or Riverlands) remaining kingdoms pledge fealty to the Throne House Arryn pledged fealty to Tywin Lannister who House Lannister had placed as interim King. The Martells, (Florents who took over from the Tyrells), and the Baratheons pledged to Stannis. Since I was at the Vale, I chose to pledge fealty to Tywin Lannister, while making it very clear to Stannis I only did this to avoid executing in the Vale. At this point Stannis began a massive march on Kings Landing and house Lannister refused to abdicate the throne. Stannis obliterated them, leaving with very little influence over Westeros other than retaining Casterly rock and most of the Westerlands. House Arryn then refused to pledge fealty, claiming they wished to remain neutral. Stannis threatened a massive march on their capital and they ended up surrendering. Stannis rewarded me with lordship over the Vale for my loyalty. He also gave me his daughter with the weird face in marriage (I know its super creepy cause Baelish is like 20 years older than her, but I wanted a possible claim to the throne). The delegate controlling House Lannister had to switch over to House Baratheon due to the limited impact that the Lannisters would have under these circumstances. This is where the 3rd session ended. 

NOTE: Before I start the final session (where shit gets nuts)  I should mention that I forgot to say that the iron bank was still pissed with us because we totally forgot about them in the midst of the king switching stuff. Also,  Tywin, Jamie, and Cersei all died by betrayal or suicide. Tyrion was the only survivor. 

SESSION 4

NOTE: Before I start the final session (where shit gets nuts) I should mention that I forgot to say that the iron bank was still pissed with us because we totally forgot about them in the midst of the king switching stuff. Also,  Tywin, Jamie, Joffreys sister, and Cersei all died by betrayal or suicide. Tyrion was the only survivor. Also during the other sessions there were mentions of a girl with dragons who was across the narrow sea; however we paid no head due to massive problems mentioned before. There were reports from the wall that said they were severely undermanned, but we failed to act on that as well. Both these issues came to a head during this session

The guys who was originally House Tyrell and then switched to house Arryn had to switch over to House Stark and act as the independent north since I now controlled the Vale.When we started we were kind of at a stand still and helped arrange a reverse red wedding, where I offered Sweet Robin to the Frays and then we ambushed him, just for sweet justice of what actually happens in the books. Once that was over we received reports that there were massive amounts of wildlings at the wall that were ready to attack. The Starks allied with the throne and we collectively sent a boat load of troops up to the wall and demanded negotiations with Mance Rayder. He said that his people were not kneelers and that they would need to live free if they passed through the wall (this was all acted out by a person on crisis who temporarily represented Mance). There were 100,000 wildlings in total, many women and children. We decided to let them into the north, where they could leave as free people. Some would help serve on the wall since they feared what was north of it. This was fine and we proceeded onward. We then got wind that Daenerys Targaryen had gotten many ships and an army of 10,000 unsullied. She began sailing across the narrow sea and it seemed as though she would either land somewhere on the eastern coast of Dorne or make her way up to Kings Landing or Storms End. We mobilized nearly every troop in the land to the coast and the crown paid a shat load of money to hire Daario Naharis to assassinate her. According to Crisis Naharis decided to side with her, saying her victory seemed imminent. So of course while this whole massive thing was going down, we lose contact with the wall. The Starks leave Winterfell and travel south to the River lands. On top of this the Greyjoys summonded a massive fleet of warships and we were headed this way. At this point I took time to do a very Baelish thing and offer my services and betray my kingdom to help them claim the throne so long as I was not killed and not stripped of my position (I sent notices to Daenerys Targaryen and the Greyjoys). Another update soon after said that we lost contact with the entirety of the North and that it was confirmed that White Walkers were ready to march south. Since the Greyjoys had no idea that the North was absolutely effed, we offered them the North without combat. They soon landed, and after that we heard nothing, so Im assuming they got destroyed. Daenerys Targaryens army landed in Dorne and they decided to march on Kings Landing with her 3 fully grown dragon, 10,000 unsullied, and the recent addition of former Dornish troops. Stannis offered to abdicate the throne and leave it to Daenerys so long as every kingdom marched on the white walkers with the dragons to save it. Somehow this worked and she agreed to the terms. I would imagine that it was the most epic fight ever, but the kingdoms won. Daenerys on the throne, the Lannisters smashed, the Baratheons honorable and in control of the Stormlands and the Reach, Petyr Baelish established house Baelish while becoming Lord of the Vale and remaining master of coin, Dorne got loads of land, Tyrells lost the reach and were destroyed, Robb Stark alive and ready to reclaim the separate North as king, and the Riverlands irrelevant as hell. 

I think that is all. I hope yall had fun with this, because I know I loved every second of posting and seeing responses as well as actually playing the game as well. I ended up winning Honorable Mention for Best Delegate, while House Lannister/Baratheon took home the main award, which came with a gavel that had GAME OF THRONES inscribed into it. 

Remember all: Chaos isnt a pit. Chaos is a ladder.

So Dany has the two dragons in the catacombs, and the black one is running around free? Did it escape? If so, how? Or were all three of them running around free and two of them just happened to be in the catacombs and so she grabbed them while she could? 

Have we ever heard the gender breakdown of the dragons? Will they mate and lay more eggs?

422,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2015-3-9,2015,3,9,4,2yd4by,self.gameofthrones,[ACOK] [SOME SPOILERS] I just did a Game of Thrones Model UN and it was absolutely insane. (Repost),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/2yd4by/acok_some_spoilers_i_just_did_a_game_of_thrones/,[deleted],1425843784,"So a while ago I posted on this subreddit asking for some help on playing my character, Petyr Baelish, in a model UN setting right before the War of the Five Kings (Here is the link to that:http://bit.ly/1EDgu5I ).

HOW THE GAME WORKED

Here is a bit about how the conference actually worked. There were 4 sessions where multiple crises occurred during each. The Houses/People that were initially represented (there was some shake ups during the whole thing) by my classmates were House Lannister, House Martell, House Tyrell, and my role as Master of Coin. There was a crisis committee of a few college students who represented all the other Houses, forces, and people of Westeros and beyond. There were chairs to keep it like an actual Model UN setting; however because there were only four delegates there it was incredibly loose and the parliamentary procedure section of the whole deal wasn't incredibly important. We were all given a designated amount of money and troops to use at our disposal (I however received an extensive network of informants instead of troops, also whomever controlled the kingdom had control over propaganda). Also, if a house became conquered or irrelevant or someone died, then the delegate would select a new house to represent that was still in the picture.

WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED

So we began with the Lannisters on the Throne. They quickly forged an alliance with House Tyrell promising that eventually Joffrey would be married to Lady Margaery. The Lannisters also used the advantage of having Gregor Clegane captive to reel in House Martell as an ally. Of course I, Petyr Baelish, remained ""loyal"" to the throne. Stannis began a 40,000 strong march on King's Landing and also blockaded the port with a fleet of warships. At the same time Robb Stark marched on the fairly unguarded Casterly Rock. The three houses who were delegates chose to call 40,000 troops of their own to King's Landing before Stannis could get there (they also had 20,000 more Tyrell soldiers headed incase of a prolonged siege). I sensed that Stannis might kill me if I did not outright pledge loyalty to him so I secretly formed an alliance with him and fed him enough information to capture Tollum and Lady Margaery, who tried to escape in secret from King's Landing. The 3 Kingdom alliance formed an incredible battle plan to destroy Stannis' ships in an effective way using Wildfire and ended up winning the battle at King's Landing - from that point named ""The Battle of the Night Fire"". The Lannisters still believe I am on their side at this point as well. This Ended the 1st of Four Sessions. --- at this point in the typing I want to see how many people pay attention to this and to see if they want a continuation of what happened or not. If this receives enough attention, I'll finish the post at a later time (plus I'm super tired and I'm not even a fourth of the way through the material I need to explain).

To look at a brief summary of what all went down, you can visit this twitter page where they posted many of the updates as the sessions went on: https://twitter.com/wlumodelungot . Again, shit got real. 

Anyways let me know if yall wanna hear the rest! P.S. so long as one person wants to hear the alternate series of events and wants me to continue, I will.

Just about every franchise out there has an mmo right now. Lotr, Star Trek, Star wars, etc.

But... Can we just imagine  a GOT mmo for a moment? The world that we all know and love comes to life even more than it already is. 

I've thought out a few pieces. For starts, you'd choose your sex. then where you are from in the world, choose to be a northerner, southern, bravos etc. Then choose the house you represent. Then your class. Then off you go.

For each choice, like most mmo's, your starting choices will have effects.

For example: If you were to be from the north you could have cold resistance.

If you were to be represent the Lannisters you get extra starting gold, a higher cap or a bigger inventory.

Dothraki could have +fire damage or fire resistance. 

Greyjoys could have something water related. Hold breath for longer or ship combat could be a thing which they excel at.

Starks of course, if they choose a hunter could have a direwolf as a pet. 

Stannis could of course have a god mode with zero cooldown. 

This is just an idea I thought up while making pizza so it could be an awful idea but I'd genuinely love this. It of course would takes years and because of it, it could be in the works already. I just hope if/when this idea comes around it is someone who cares about the world at the helm of it.

The new trailer seems to show he is pushing for her to take the Iron throne and there was also a conversation he had in season 1 that implied that as well.
However, he advises Ned and King Robert to kill her. Of course this may be only talk but he also tells Ned that ""those birds have already flown"" when Ned tells him to unmake his plans. This is followed shortly with an assassination attempt that is stopped by Ser friend-zone.
So what is the deal? 
Is his end game really to put Dany on the throne. If so why did he go through with plans to kill her?",18,18,False,self,,,,,

This amazing trailer reveals a lot to crave for the upcoming season. There will definitely be deviations from the canon that we should expect, since it is known they do exist. This album explores speculative changes that I think will be included this season.

We have learned that many deaths are expected, as per interviews from some of the cast. One of the deaths that is highly speculated to occur is Grey Worm's. His characters been given more screen time than a book reader would expect from last season.

http://cdn3.denofgeek.us/sites/denofgeekus/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/5/50//12_sansa.png?itok=4bOcc00e

Of course, as far as we know in the books, Sansa hasn't ever gotten back to Winterfell yet, and doesn't seem particularly close to doing so (though LF does have a longterm scheme to help her reclaim it). This pretty much confirms that some major changes are coming to both the Sansa/LF plot and the Winterfell plot. 

From the picture, Sansa appears to be in the crypts of Winterfell, dressed in attire somewhat similar (though a bit less flashy) to her getup when we last saw her last season--from this we can at the very least infer she is not there as a prisoner or anything like that (because we already know how the Boltons treat prisoners, and they typically don't look that put together unless they're being shown off to the public). If she's not there as a prisoner, this means she's there of her own volition, and that the Boltons have allowed this to take place (this is assuming the Boltons still hold Winterfell, but I'd be very surprised if they got to the Battle for Winterfell until the later episodes of the season, especially since they usually like the major battles between important characters to occur near the end).

So, why would Sansa be at the crypts of Winterfell of her own volition and with the Bolton's apparently letting her in? I can think of two possibilities, both involving pretty major changes from what happened in the books

**Option #1: They're cutting Manderly, and the role of ""ostensible ally who betrays the Boltons and fucks over the Freys out of desire for vengeance"" will go to the LF/Sansa duo, with Sansa still posing as LF's daughter as they plot to retake the North from those who fucked over the Starks (and from LF's perspective murdered Cat).** This strikes me as the most likely possibility.  Manderly was one of the most popular new additions in Dance, but he's also an entirely new character who of the major characters only interacts directly with Davos and whose role in the plot can be fairly easy given other characters, i.e. LF and Sansa. This also has the added benefit of letting LF and Sansa be out and active and engaging in interesting ways with other major characters, rather than just plotting up in the eyrie or dealing with random vale lords we don't give a shit about. As a supposed Lannister ally, LF is someone that both the Freys and Boltons would treat with, but in a somewhat suspicious way--which is pretty much how they dealt with Manderly, and LF is clever enough to plausibly outsmart them the way Manderly did. And with Sansa still posing as his daughter (as far as we know, none of the Boltons or Freys have ever met her as a Stark), Sansa could accompany him and facilitate his schemes. This also sets up the potential for interaction between Sansa/LF and Theon, and we know the showrunners love putting characters together that don't get to interact in the show.

**Option #2: They're cutting Jeyne Pool, and Sansa will reveal herself and agree to marry Ramsay as part of a plan to murder him and retake Winterfell**. This strikes me as perhaps possible, but somewhat less likely. I know they're accelerating Sansa's evolution into a master schemer, but having her singlehandedly put herself in the Bolton's clutches and then outwit them entirely by herself seems like it could be a step too far (and I can't see LF signing off on that kind of plan at all). Plus, Ramsay is going to do truly horrific stuff to his wife, whoever she ends up being, and the Sansa we see in that screenshot doesn't look like she's received the Jeyne Pool treatment. 

What do others think? How does Sansa end up in Winterfell this season?",9,18,False,self,,,,,

It might be difficult for many who aren't from there to comprehend just how brilliant this has been for my small country. NI is the most deprived region of the UK with the highest unemployment, and GoT has brought in around 150 million to the economy (so far!). I have several unemployed friends who got work as extras, and had a great time while being paid 100 a day. The show has hired hundreds of locals, from things like set-building to creating weapons, to being producers and cast officials (Not to mention some great actors like Conleth Hill and Michelle Fairley). I fondly remember seeing Samwell in my local music shop with a giant stack of blu rays in his claws, my sister seeing Jaime Lannister while at the bus shop, and my friend from school eating at Subway while Theon Greyjoy was tucking into his. I do hope the show stays around for another few years and more people are inspired to come visit us, NI is not like it used to be, it's a bustling place filled with great sights for the tourists and friendly, helpful people. So thanks Game of Thrones for helping me and my countrymen out, we'll be forever grateful. Also map: http://interact.discovernorthernireland.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Mapnewsmall.jpg

Also, completely unrelated, but back in S2, why does Jaime keep trying to run away from Brienne when she was instructed to escort him back home?

686,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2015-3-12,2015,3,12,6,2yq0zc,self.gameofthrones,[TV] What characters do you want to see more of in Season 5?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/2yq0zc/tv_what_characters_do_you_want_to_see_more_of_in/,annarborjack,1426108790,"What characters don't get enough screen time that you want to see more of? This is mainly for the show, but I guess you can do it for the books as well as long as you don't spoil anything without warning. Here are my top 10.

Ten: Grey Worm- Grey Worm seems as though he could be cool, but he doesn't do anything. We know he can fight, but we only saw him fight, what, once? The Season 5 trailer shows we are gonna show him fight again, so that's nice. In Season 4, all he did was stand around and not do much. There were scenes where he literally just stood there. I think Grey Worm could turn into a more liked character on the show if they give him more of a personality and give him more fight scenes, and it looks like they are doing so in Season 5!

Nine: Bronn- He appears enough, but I want more of him! The reason why he is so low on this list is cause I guess he appears enough, but he didn't appear much in Season 4, so I hope we get more of him in Season 5. If you look closely at some shots in the trailer, you see him and Jamie are fighting some people.

Eight: Blackfish- A Tully who made it out alive in the Red Wedding. Where'd he go? How is he after the Red Wedding? WHERE is he?

Seven: Mance Rayder- The King beyond The Wall! Mance Rayder is the badass leader of the Wildings with some of the greatest quotes in the series such as, ""I'm gonna light the biggest fire the north has ever seen!"" ""We do not kneel."" and in the new clip, ""Fuck my pride!"" The new clip confirms we are gonna see more of him, and that makes me happy. 

Six: Beric Dondarrian- So, what happened to this guy? Where'd he go? He died 6 times and we have not heard a word from him since the middle of Season 3! Where'd he go?

Five: Gregor Clegane- We only saw him in two scenes of Season 4, but both of those scenes left a mark on who he is, one of them will impact the rest of the show. Give us more of him, please!

Four: Theon Greyjoy- Theon, or should I say, Reek, only appeared in 3 episodes in Season 4 and we saw him for literally only a second in the first Season 5 trailer. I hope we see more of him this season.

Three: Olenna Tyrell- She is the woman who poisoned Joffery. Give us more of her! And she always seems to be enjoyable whenever we do see her. 

Two: Podrick- For some reason, I wanna see more of this guy, a lot. Not sure why but I do. Make him kill someone again! Maybe him and Brienne get attacked and he kills someone? That could be intresting, though Podrick isn't really a fighter. 

One: Roose Bolton- I want to see more him just being a badass ruthless man you do not want to mess with. We already get this sometimes, but I want more. Well, saying Roose is badass is a bit of an overstatement, other than the way he killed Robb Stark, just walking up to him like ""THE LANNISTERS SEND THEIR REGARDS"" then stabbing him, but he is ruthless and cold for sure.

So what characters do you want to see more of in Season 5, and if you want, the books as well?

EDIT: The reason why these are lettered like ""Ten, Night, Eight..."" is because for some reason it flipped the number around putting Grey Worm at 1 and Roose Bolton at 10. Not sure why, but it did.",28,14,False,self,,,,,

As I'm sure many of you are aware Game of Thrones Season 5 is to air simultaneously with HBO this year in over 170 countries. For some reason Sky in the UK think it's best to exclude themselves from the festivities: http://www.sky.com/tv/show/game-of-thrones/article/simulcast

I can assure you ""To encourage UK fans to watch, enjoy and discuss their favourite show together"" basically translates to ""If we simulcast the show at 2am we'll lose out on a huge portion of ad revenue"".

Boooooo!

But now a petition has been put together to help counter the decision.

I'm five chapters away from finishing it for the first time and I'm shocked that people feel this way.

AFFC might not have a grand climax or an important shocking death like AGOT or ASOS, but it does the political scenes and just overall smaller-scope scenes so much better than the previous books IMO

I've been thinking of parts that really stood out to me and listed a few:

- Arya's whole storyline in the House of Black and White overall is great
- The Crow's Eye taking power over The Iron Islands and vowing to take all of Westoros with the horn
- Arya killing the singer for betraying the Watch
- Jaime's Aunt telling Jaime ""Tyrion is Tywins son, not you"" 
- Cersei's plotting to take out Margeary 
- Doran revealing that Arienne was betrothed to Viserys and that he plans to have Quentin marry Daenerys to get revenge
- Sam caring for Aemon before his death
- Brienne fighting Biter with the Hound's Helm

Honestly, I fail to see how so many people thought it was a weak point in the series and I'm looking forward to ADWD so much more now. I wasn't even going to read it before S5 started but now I don't think I can wait.

I gave it a chance and was pleasantly surprised by some tracks.

**Track 1**

The Oath - Method Man

Probably one of my favorite hiphop tracks on the mixtape. He reiterates the Night's Watch Oath but in his own words. 
9/10

**Track 2**

Run for Cover - MNDR

Pretty nice. Not my genre of music but it wasn't as bad as I thought it was gonna be. 6/10

**Track 3**

Never Back Down - Ty Dolla $ign

I was scared about this one. I thought he was going to completely butcher his attempt to make a good song for this from the preview. I'm glad I got to hear it all before I passed on it. It wasnt that bad, i mean it wasnt good but it wasnt bad. 5/10


**Track 4**

Loyalty - Killswitch Engage

I don't know much about metal but I do enjoy some of the music of the genre. This is one of them. 7/10

**Track 5**

Surrender Now - Kap G

This track surprised me as well. I listened to some of this dude's other music and I, again, judged too early.
This dude's flow on this track was amazing and he,more or less, kept it related to GoT. 7/10

**Track 6**

Fight Through It - Melanie Fiora

This track. Let me tell yall about this track. Musically, this is the best track on the mixtape. 10/10 

**Track 7**

Lannister's Anthem - Snoop Dogg

Snoop D-O Double G. Rapping from the point of view of the House of Lannister, he throws shade on all of the other houses. 8/10

**Track 8**

Marcando Territorio - Yandel

I don't know what the hell this dude was saying but the beat was nice and his voice was kind cool. ?/10

**Track 9**

Soror Irrumator - Anthrax

Pretty sweet track from Anthrax. It sounds pretty nice, and a cool song about the wars. 7/10

**Track 10**

Let Me Go - Estelle

This sounds like a ode to Margaery Tyrell. Really nice track. 9/10

**Track 11**

Lord of the Light - Talib Kweli

Best Rap track. Talib Kweli brought his A game with this one keeping it very GoT related. 10/10

**Track 12**

White Walker - Mastadon

A really dark track. It also has this mysterious feel that really embodies the white walkers theme. It also embodies the hope the Night's Watch brings. 8/10

**Track 13** 

Legends - Raquel Sofia

The mix of English and Spanish is pretty neat. Pretty cool tribute to Aria too. 7/10

**Track 14**

All Mine - Stalley

Stalley, my brother. What the hell was this? Skip this track. Only thing good about this is the instrumental. 1/10

**Track 15**

I never heard of them before this mixtape so before the release I went go check their stuff out. Unfortunately I didnt like any of their stuff. This,however, I can mess with. Still not my cup of tea but I probably wont skip it if it comes on. 6/10


There's my review. Mixtape is better than the first imo. I like variety and GoT is very diverse in terms of personalities and ideologies. Its only right to have different musical genres to highlight that trait of the show. Give it shot. Its free.

They're on the Northern Ireland set, and their last scene is shot in the rain.

Here's the quote from the actor/actress: ""It proves you should probably not read the books. I thought this season I was going to have more to do, and I was really looking forward to that. And then I got my dates from my agent and I though, 'That doesn't tally.' Because there was no way if they were sticking to the books I should be in it for that number of weeks. It seemed to me they must be writing me out. The showrunners rang me and told me, 'Your time is up in the series.' I'm disappointed but you have to accept that the demands of TV are different.

Hear me out: Podrick Payne and Brienne are together, and have just seen Arya. Moving forward, it feels entirely possible to me that the Brotherhood finds the pair and takes them to their new leader. Queue to a dramatic scene where we follow some path and at the end of the path it's none other than Lady Stoneheart!

So Since Benjen Stark isn't Coldhands, where could he be? Why was Benjen Stark at Winterfell in the firstplace in Book 1? Don't men of the Night's Watch leave their names and Houses behind when they join the watch? Benjen has one of the highest ranks in the Night's Watch, but does this afford him that much privilege to go on recruiting missions to other kingdoms in the realm? What about kingdoms outside of Westeros, like Essos? If Benjen was there to recruit, that completely failed. 

Is it possible that in order to fight the forces of Ice, Benjen Stark learns from Maester Aemon the beliefs about Fire being an opposing-force to Ice? The Maesters at the Citadel are well aware that Magic exists in the ASoIF universe, but seem to deny its existence, perhaps to dissuade others from using it. I know of only one other Targaryen Maester besides Aemon, but there may have been others. Since there exists a Valyrian Steel link in a Maester's Chain for studying ""Magic"" and the ""Mysteries"" (such as the Ancient Grecian occult/drug-induced Eleusinian Mysteries or the Mithraic Mysteries) it's clear the Maesters know Magic exists and it's logical that they would have books on the matter. 

Being a Stark, it is very likely that he is literate. Perhaps he read something in Maester Aemon's library about Fire magic? We know Maester Aemon has, at the very least, books about dragons, which are themselves considered supernatural in the GoTverse. Did anyone else in the Night's Watch know Maester Aemon was Aemon Targaryen? 

From there, Benjen would have went to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea and ""borrowed"" a boat and sailed to Essos, encountering the temples/worship of R'hollor. He would inevitably head for Asshai to learn more about fire magic, but coincidentally caught wind of the rumor of the ""Khaleesi with 3 dragons."" If there's anything Benjen knows, it's how to track savages. He would follow the Dothraki trail, disguise himself as Daario Naharis, temporarily ally himself with the Second Sons and infiltrate Dany's camp...

For those who don't, here is the explanation once again:

Backstory: In 2002 my ""friend"" Mark and I were going to see a movie. On the way in to the theatre he hands me 20 dollars.

Me: ""What is this for?""

Mark: ""No big deal, just so we can have fun this weekend.""

Me: ""Awesome, thanks man.""

What he was actually doing was setting up a lifelong guilt trip that he could use at his whim to attempt to force me to do whatever he wanted.

""Remember that 20 bucks I gave you that one time?"" - Dozens of times.

He insisted I owed him nothing, but about 4 times a year for the past 13 years he uses this bullshit as an excuse for why he did something to me or to make me do something for him! I have paid him back (even though he said I didn't have to) on 2 or 3 separate occasions monetarily, and made dozens of deals that he said made us square throughout the past decade. This son of a bitch won't let up! I've been too short sighted and trusting in the past to video tape the exchange and his admittance that we're even, and now he's turning others against me! Some day I will have my revenge.


[I had no idea he planned on going character to character, but the relentless douche Mark went far beyond last year's betrayal, and enlisted the fucking hound to call me out!](https://i.imgur.com/wU5jRIe.jpg?2)

He's systematically turning the entire cast against me somehow, all in a lame spiderman hoodie.  What should I do?

At the moment I'm binge watching the TV show from the first season and onward, even though I already spoiled myself from a recap video by The Fine Bros.

My question is why is the Iron Throne itself so important? I understand that the one who sits on the throne rules over the seven kingdoms. What I don't understand is how the throne itself enforces that rule. If it's just a symbol of power and wealth, then what's stopping anyone from ignoring the king or armies from disobeying orders? If they were fighting for fertile territory or a wish-granting Macguffin, I can understand why such conflicts are a big deal. To me, they're just fighting over a chair made of swords.

Until I understand the appeal of the Iron Throne, it just comes across as contrived to me. So seeing the characters fight over it comes across as a bit alien to me when I can't relate to why they want it so badly. At least the Night's Watch and the White Walkers interest me the most in Game of Thrones so far.

*""Faegon""
*Greyjoy Family Matters
*The Bachelor, Quentyn Martell
*Tyrion's Walk of Shame
*Victarion and The Hate Boat

I'll agree with the bits about any Greyjoys, except for Asha and Theon/Reek. When I got to bits about any other Greyjoys I just wanted to get through them as fast as I could to get to more interesting characters. For me, they work great as background characters and Asha is an interesting strong character in her own right, but the others were ho-hum. Yes, they are sort of like Vikings. I get it. It just wasn't engaging. They mystery of Dragonbinder was interesting, but not enough to keep me hooked.

I disagree with their dislike of Tyrion's plot in ADWD. I enjoyed his travels through Essos. We got a different look at the continent than Dany did and a different perspective. Some of the most interesting visuals in the series yet - yes I know, not plot - came from his chapters. 

So, agree or disagree with i09?",4,4,False,self,,,,,

&gt;As they say on reality shows, eventually a persons journal endslike it will this season for one cast member (well just call them an actor) who has been with the show for several years. In their trailer, Northern Irelands seemingly endless rain patters on the roof as this person puts a good face on their situation. They just shot their final Thrones scene. Their death will be as surprising to fans as it was to them.  
&gt;It proves you should probably not read the books, the actor says. I thought this season I was going to have more to do, and I was really looking forward to that. And then I got my dates from my agent and I thought, That doesnt tally. Because there was no way if they were sticking to the books I should be in it for that number of weeks. It seemed to me they must be writing me out. The showrunners rang me and told me, Your time is up in the series. Im disappointed but you have to accept that the demands of TV are different. I find myself being quite emotional about it. Im going to miss it. Never mind being a professional, theyre very nice people.  

A well-sourced listing of who it can/can't be because the actor hasn't read ahead in the books.  The quote indicates clearly that the actor knew enough about the books to assume they would have more to do this season:  
Obviously, spoilers are present through the end of ADwD.    

As many actors haven't read the books, (sources and lists below), that leaves Daenerys, Jon Snow, Jaime Lannister, Littlefinger, Brienne of Tarth, Samwell Tarly, or Ser Barristan.  

Ser Barristan is Daenerys' only remaining general-type.  Sure, perhaps Tyrion and Varys could serve in this capacity, but I don't think it's yet time for Barristan to say goodbye.    

Samwell Tarly has a large plotline in the second half of Storm of Swords,  in books 4/5 he leaves the wall giving us a lot more insight into the Maesters of the Citadel, which has not been thoroughly explored at this point.   They might cut the plot as unnecessary and kill off Sam.  Going further on his plotline into books 4/5 would likely add a new shooting location, further expand the already massive ensemble cast, and it might be too much for the shooting schedule.  On the other hand, after the deaths of Grenn and Pip, Sam is the only remaining foil for Jon Snow, and as Jon assumes more leadership, it would be important to provide their interactions for continuity (though they could just kill him after).  After he leaves the wall, he provides insight into the maesters of the citadel, an otherwise unexplored part of GRRM's world (as of yet).  

Jon Snow and Samwell Tarly are also the two characters in the books that have the most remaining written book material, with the Walls plotlines ending season 4 midway through A Storm of Swords.    
Jon Snow is up in the air whether he's alive or dead in the books, and the quote suggests that it's someone who is certainly alive in the books.    

Unless they introduce Lady Stoneheart this season (which I think would be left for the last episode regardless for a cliffhanger), there probably isn't much for Brienne to do this season, as I don't think she'll find Arya.  She might find Sansa and that could either go the way her meeting with Arya went or she might enter Sansa's service, which I think would be awesome (and Sansa can know that Arya survived).    

Daenerys's plotline has been showcased throughout the series as one of the major threads, I don't see them cutting that short anticlimactically.   

Jaime Lannister.  I would like to see Jaime redeem himself more as the character everyone loved to hate and then slowly you realize there's more to him than the worst things he's ever done.   

So, my money is on Littlefinger.  I would love to see Sansa kill Littlefinger and take control.  She began the series as a powerless and foolish little girl that got her father killed due to her naivete, but every season she grows stronger, and she pretty much stopped being a fool the moment Joffrey took Ned Stark's head.  Littlefinger on the other hand has ever been the manipulator.  I would love to see Sansa seduce Littlefinger to lower his guard and then murder him.

The 'No' list:

Davos Seaworth (Lord Onion Knight): Liam Cunningham hasn't read the books (http://www.accesshollywood.com/access-countdown-to-game-of-thrones-season-2-qanda-liam-cunningham-talks-davos-seaworth_article_59908)  

Reek/Theon: Alfie Allen said in 2014 that he stopped midway through the 3rd book to avoid reading ahead.  http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/game-of-thrones-star-alfie-allen-on-theons-torture  

Bran: Not in the season, but said in 2014 the most he's read is wikipedia.  http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/game-of-thrones-stars-maisie-williams-isaac-hempstead-wright-on-arya-and-brans-journeys  

Tyrion: Peter Dinklage never read the books http://www.rollingstone.com/tv/news/peter-dinklage-has-not-read-any-game-of-thrones-books-20140327  

Cersei: Lena Headey said in 2014 she hasn't read the books (but her mom has) http://screencrush.com/game-of-thrones-lena-headey-books/  

Arya: Maisie Williams hasn't read the books as of 2014, though her parents have and she knows the overview of her arc.  http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/game-of-thrones-stars-maisie-williams-isaac-hempstead-wright-on-arya-and-brans-journeys  

Tommen: Dean-Charles Chapman doesn't seem to have read the books.  In an interview he was quoted as being surprised to find out that Tommen inherits the throne.    

Margaery Tyrell: Natalie Dormer said in 2013 that she hadn't read them yet and that she probably will read them retrospectively.  I'm ruling that a no.  http://collider.com/game-of-thrones-season-3-sophie-turner-natalie-dormer-interview/  

Bronn: Jerome Flynn hasn't read the books as of November 2014, and notes that his role is greatly expanded from the books already.  http://winteriscoming.net/2014/11/12/jerome-flynn-confirms-bronns-story-changing/  

Varys: Conleth Hill said he hasn't read the books.  http://www.vulture.com/2015/02/conleth-hill-varys-game-of-thrones.html  Also, Varys has maybe 1 scene in AFfC and ADwD.    

Stannis: Stephen Dillane implied he hadn't read the books as of 2014, and appears very hesitant to make the assumption that he would be in the next season, in my opinion that makes it unlikely that the quote is from him. Ruling that a no.  http://www.denofgeek.com/tv/stephen-dillane/28822/stephen-dillane-on-the-tunnel-and-game-of-thrones  

Missandei: Nathalie Emmanuel says she reads the books alongside the show, and that she doesn't want to get ahead of the show or pre-empt anything in her storyline.  Ruling this one a no.    http://www.gamesradar.com/game-of-thrones-nathalie-emmanuel-interview/  

Melisandre: Hasn't read the books http://www.westeros.org/GoT/Features/Entry/Season_4_Interview_Carice_van_Houten_Liam_Cunningham

Roose Bolton: Michael McElhatton stopped reading after book 2 http://www.accesshollywood.com/game-of-thrones-qanda-michael-mcelhatton-talks-roose-bolton_article_91774  

------------------------------------------  

Who it can't be because the character has almost no role in the books during this timeline and the quote indicates the actor thought  there would be more this season:  

Rickon, Osha: Neither character had a role in either book IIRC, though GRRM has implied that Osha at least will return (he said Natalia Tena's performance in S1 made him want to expand her character in the future books)  

----------------------------------------  

Who has read the books:  

Daenerys: Emilia Clarke said in 2012 she has read all the books multiple times http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/game-of-thrones/9266973/Games-of-Thrones-interview-Emilia-Clarke.html  

Jon Snow: Kit Harington has read at least through AFFC as of 2013  
   
Jaime Lannister: Nikolaj Coster-Waldau has read book 3 as of June 2013.  http://www.avclub.com/article/nikolaj-coster-waldau-aka-jaime-lannister-talks-hi-98673  

Littlefinger: Aidan Gillen has read all the books (http://www.latintimes.com/game-thrones-season-5-spoilers-littlefinger-actor-aiden-gillen-reveals-show-will-surpass-188374)  

Brienne of Tarth: Gwendoline Christie has read all the books.  http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/game-thrones-gwendoline-christie-shreds-4624860  

Samwell Tarly: John Bradley said he read all the books http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/game-thrones-star-absolutely-catastrophic-693186  

Ser Barristan: Ian McElhinney read the books thoroughly   

-------------------------------------  

Unknown:    
Myrcella Baratheon (Lannister): Not enough press yet to know if Nell Tiger Free read the books that I'm aware of.  However, the way the quote is worded, it does not seem as if the character dying just came aboard the show.  (Nell Tiger Free took over the Myrcella role this season).    

Sansa Stark: Sophie Turner said in 2013 that she reads the books ""season by season""  I'm not sure on the specifics.  http://collider.com/game-of-thrones-season-3-sophie-turner-natalie-dormer-interview/  

Mance Rayder: In a 2013 interview he said he was hoping to begin reading the books in the summer.  http://www.vulture.com/2013/04/game-of-thrones-mance-rayder-ciaran-hinds-interview.html  

Podrick Payne: In Sept. 2014 said he had read AFfC before Season 2, but said he hasn't read any since being cast.  http://nerdbastards.com/2014/09/04/nerdbastards-interview-with-game-of-thrones-podrick-daniel-portman/  

Yara Greyjoy: I couldnt' find an interview where she said whether she read the books or not.

So long time reader, first time poster. I'm a big GOT nerd and work in the media so I got invited to the Tower Of London thing tonight. It's 1am here, I had a few champagnes etc but wanted to give a big update on what happens in S5.E1 The Wars To Come.

Edit: I got confused with spoiler tags etc and have been to bed so a lot of this info is out there, but still of some use for some of you.

First: what isn't in it. No Arya, no Dorne/Sand Snakes, no Theon/Ramsey/Roose. Winterfell IS on the map, despite no chars being there in the ep, pretty much as it was in S1/S1, but with the flayed man sigil rising up.

We also get Pentos back, as Varys and Tyrion are there. No Dorne on the map yet, but I read on EW that 'Dorne' is on the map as opposed to Sunspear. There is a funny bit in The Wars To Come where Loras and Olyvar (the dude from the brothel) are trying to remember all the places in Dorne and they realise they all have 'sand' 'stone' 'sun' or 'snake' in them in some form.

Anyway in the ep is: Cersei/King's Landing, Pentos with Tyrion, Meereen with Dany, The Vale with Sansa/LF/Brienne, The Wall, and a nice Maergery/Loras scene too.

So here we go.

- Ep open with the flashback. Young Cersei mocks a very young looking Maggy, who reveals she will be queen, but a younger queen will come etc etc. 

- Present day. Cersei arrives at the sept to see Tywin, shouts at Jaime a bit. Later she sees Lancel, who is now a sparrow, and has a shaved head, old cloak and barefoot look. I didn't even recognise him. Kevan (!!!) explains that with Tywin gone, the sparrows are more confident to come to the capital.

- Tyrion falls out a crate. Varys and he have a slightly elongated vers of the chat in the trailer. Expanded version includes: Tommen is too meek, Stannis is too cold, and V is off to Meereen whether Tyrion goes with him or not. Varys explains Robert's rebellion went all wrong, and lays his cards out as a 100% Dany supporter. Whether this is a ruse or not, who knows? But his case for bringing Dany to Westeros is compelling. No sign of Illyrio.

- At the Wall, Jon goes to meet Stannis, who asks him to get Mance to bend the knee. Jon tries, but Mance refuses, and talks to Jon about his politics. For him, having the freedom to make a bad decision is empowering. They're doing a lot here, through dialogue, track shots etc, to really show Jon caught between Mance and Stannis, not just as leaders, but as father figures, and it works really well. Both of them are showing him how men, and leaders, choose to behave. Stannis burns Mance alive, but, seeing him suffer, Jon shoots him in the heart with an arrow, killing him (and presumably ruining Mellisandre's sacrifice)

- M and Jon have a quick chat where she asks if he is a virgin. He says no. She says 'good'. !?

- Davos also explains that Stannis wants to utilise the wildlings as an army against Roose. Pretty sure this is a deviation from ADWD, where he wants to recruit the mountain clans, but it's achieving the same goal I guess?

- Brienne and Pod get mopey in the Vale. 

- Meanwhile, Sansa and LF are watching Robin train against a young boy. They're in a lush green field so I'm guessing they descended the Eyrie etc. Robin gets his ass whupped. It sounds like he gets left here (possibly with Royce) to foster. Sort of weird given that LF/Sansa keep a hold of him IN ORDER TO strengthen their hold on the Vale in the books. LF and Sansa go off on an adventure. LF tells her he's taking her far away from Cersei. Then they pass Brienne and Pod, which is a bit #derpy.

- After ripping down the Harpy statue, an Unsullied soldier goes to a brothel, gets his throat slit by Sons Of The Harpy. Dany insists on a proper burial for him and sends other Unsullied to patrol the city. She goes to visit her dragons, but they're incredibly violent (AND ABSOLUTELY HUGE BTW). Whole thing leaves her very traumatised. I think Daario suggested she send the dragons to Yunkai to freak some people out and re-assert her authorit.

- Messandei asks Grey Worm why an Unsullied would go to a brothel if he has no genitals. GW has no idea, which isn't what M wanted to hear. From the scene though, where the soldier gets cuddled and sung to, I think the freed Unsullied are getting in touch with their emotional side.

- The harpy statue gets pulled down. Kind of surprised that was in Ep1. You see Targaryen banners around the city, which is kind of cool.

- Dany is just bedding Daario, NBD. He gives her bad advice, saying she can't call herself a dragon queen if she has no dragons.



Anyway it was a good ep, a bit typical of any E1 in that it sets things up, but it was exciting. Odd re the Sand Snakes being omitted, but the S5.E2 description specifically mentions Cersei fearing for her daughter so I guess that's when the show goes all Dorney. Someone I spoke to from Sky tonight said one of the SS doesn't appear til Ep 5, and they had a hard time on the red carpet getting the press to talk to her. Not 100% sure if this is true.

Also a friend who was presenting on the red carpet, and interviewed most the cast, tells me episode 3 has a MASSIVE wtf ending/something happens that will freak book readers out.

Will answer anything if you guys have any qs about tonight?",38,27,False,self,,,,,

edit:  Link to actual 501 synopsis from watchers on the wall.  I did read another review which gave a synopsis which corroborates this as legit.

http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/2zjhea/spoilers_all_episode_501_synopsis_posted_on_wotw/

Also, another spoiler post which is seeming very likely for the end of the season as he knew about the locations:

http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/2npj40/spoilers_all_nights_king_in_season_5/



The August post hit nail on the head for the most part compared with the synopses which have been posted by multiple sources who were at the premiere.  Only difference is Mance isn't burned yet.

I'll put the text here in case it gets removed:

Leaked script summary for Season 5 Episode 1.

-1)Flashback scene! Maggy the Frog and Cersei's prophesy.

-2) Aftermath of Tywin's death.Over his corpse Cersei asks Jaime if he freed Tyrion, he denies it but she knows he's lying.

-3) Cersei finds her surrouned by Tyrells after she leaves Jaime. Cersei refuses to look Loras in the eye while he gives his condolances. Margaery comforts Tommen.

-4) Cersei bumbs into Pycelle but avoids him.

-5) After that she meets Lancel who is barefoot and has joined the Sparrows ( not warriors sons?)...and Kevan. Lancel looks dreadful.

-6) Later on she sees Lancel again who wants her forgiveness about what happened between them before...and also discusses the nasty business with Roberts ""hunting accident"". Cersei pretends she doesn't know what he is talking about. Lancel is a religious nut now...who knows what he will tell others.

-7)We turn to Meereen where an Unsullied soldier is looking for time with a whore...to cuddle. 
It ends in disaster when the man is attacked while with the woman.

-8)The Harpy's sons have become a problem in Meereen and Dany has her men patrol the streets.

-9) Daario and Hizdar come back from being in Yunkai and tell her to attack Yunkai first with her dragons...she must show no weakness. 
The Yunkai are eager to attack her.

-10) Dany goes to the dragons in the pit...she will suffer no more ""accidents"" ,so she can't use the dragons unles she can control them. But havethey have grown and try and attack her. She realises she will not able to use them or control them...ever.

.-11)Final scene takes place at the Wall where Stannis talks to Jon about attacking Roose Bolton. Melisandre isn't far behind.
Stannis wants Jon to convince Mance to kneel, he needs the wildling army to attack the Boltons. 
Jon has until nightfall to accomplish this task.

......................................

More of the leaked script ( EP2 or EP3 perhaps):

-1)A scene takes place between Jaime and Cersei where they receive a box with a dead viper in it, a lion necklace in its jaw. Cersei tells Jaime that there are only two such necklaces in the world  the one she is wearing around her neck, and the one she has gifted to Myrcella. Jaime agrees that this is a threat by the Martells. Cersei is furious that their daughter is in danger.

-2)A short scene where Jon Snow is elected Lord Commander of the Nights Watch. That was expected.

-3)Then another scene with Pod and Brienne where they are chased by Vale guards on Littlefingers orders implies a scene that took place before it. Basically it implies that Brienne was successful in finding Sansa in the Vale, but Sansa refused Briennes help and sent her away, deciding to side with Littlefinger. Not sure how I feel about this if true.

-4)Arya arrives in Braavos, no surprises here. What bugs me here is that she doesnt hide Needle but carries it with her. She asks the Kindly Man for help who refuses her, but a few days later he decides to train her and he puts on Jaqen H'ghars face, that should please some fangirls. He tells Arya that he is not Jaqen though, but no one, and that Arya must become no one too.

-5)Barristan finally reveals to Daenerys that her father was in fact the Mad King and cruel and burned people for no reason. With that he stops her from executing a Son of the Harpy.

-6)Biggest disappointment we get another scene with Tyrion and Varys where Varys urges him to join him on his journey  to Meereen. He tells Tyrion that he still has a part to play in the war of Westeros and that the Seven Kingdoms need a better king than Tommen.  Tyrion tells Varys good luck finding him and Varys goes all who said anything about HIM? Tyrion then agrees to join Varys on his journey to the young QUEEN as long as he can keep drinking.

They go to Volantis after this. So I guess that place is still in the show, maybe Jorah kidnaps him there

Jaime has been seen with Bronn filming in ""sandy"" locations.

Brienne and Pod have been seen in the same place as ""lords of the Vale"" where filming.",14,30,False,self,,,,,

The books of course give us so much more information than the TV show, however since the TV show has to condense a complex narrative into a single scene or so it often gets straight to the heart of the matter, as it did with Littlefinger's Chaos is a Ladder speech in the S3 episode ""The Climb"". In the book Game of Thrones, it seems that even Varys doesn't understand what Littlefinger's ultimate goal is, a mystery. the gods only know what game Littlefinger is playing says the spider, a notable admission indeed, since it seems that there are few secrets in King's Landing that Varys isn't aware of.

We now know of course that many of the major events of the series were orchestrated directly by Littlefinger. Jon Arryn's Death, Ned Stark's Death, The War of the Five Kings, the Lannister-Tyrell Alliance, Tyrion's Marriage to Sansa, the Purple Wedding, Tyrion's Framing for Regicide, Lysa Arryn's Death, and much and more. No character, with the possible exception of Varys or Melisandre has singularly influenced more events in the series and been acknowledged from the readers point of view for his or her manipulations. We will have to read further on to know the extent characters like Quaithe, Marwyn and Doran Martell have influenced the Game, for now Littlefinger is the master manipulator. 

But why? What is his end game? When the dust settles, where does Lord Baelish see himself? The aforementioned episode ""the Climb"" finds Littlefinger in the throne room in King's Landing, watching the iron throne with ambition written across his face. Varys seems to think, and Littlefinger doesn't deny it, that his goal is to rule the Seven Kingdoms from the Iron Throne. Again, pages and pages of character development in a novel often have to be compressed into a single scene in a TV series, so this seems to be the collection of all of Littlefingers plots and schemes, ultimately culminating in a crown. And indeed, this is the Game of Thrones we are playing. There is no prize for second place. 

But of course that is just something Cersei throws out at Ned Stark on the eve of his downfall. While it is true if you are going to make the ultimate power grab, as Cersei and Ned are doing, the loser usually ends up dead. There is however, plenty of opportunity for those who support the winner, and Littlefinger benefits immensely for backing the Lannisters at the outset of the War of the Five Kings. Yet it is clearly not out of loyalty that Littlefinger does so. To say he abandons the Lannister ship soon after is an understatement, as he orchestrates the death of the Lannister monarch. Indeed, he has more direct involvement in Joffery's death than he did with Ned's. 

I will come back to Littlefinger's shifting loyalties in a minute, I just want to point out here that what makes him so continually successful is his willingness to adapt to the changing circumstances. Littlefinger did not have a hand in King Robert's death, that was all Lancel and Cersei, and yet he is quick to take advantage of it and side with the Lannisters. If, by chance, Ned Stark had taken up Renly's cause instead of offering the throne to Stannis, it is possible that Littlefinger would have sided with Ned. Who can say? Littlefinger is also careful no to burn his bridge with Renly, in case he had survived the War long enough to march on King's Landing. Stannis would have had no use for Littlefinger with his smiles and his scheming, Littlefinger knows this and after Renly's death, another event he had no hand in, he is quick to broker and alliance between the Tyrells and the Lannisters.

Tyrion Lannister throws a wrench in Littlefinger's plans while ruling as Hand of the King. While players like Cersei and Lord Tywin are easily manipulated by greed and ambition and their desire for power, and players like Ned Stark and Stannis can be blinded by their precious honor and integrity, Tyrion possesses the mind of lord Tywin and the honor of Ned Stark, a dangerous combination and one that Littlefinger underestimates at first, falling into Tyrion's scheme to flush out Cersei's informant on the small council. Littlefinger doesn't forget this, and maneuvers Tyrion into taking the blame for Joffery's desk by hiring the dwarf mummers at the Purple Wedding, knowing it would force the Imp into some kind of confrontation with the King. It is also Littlefinger that proposes a match between Tyrion and Sansa, knowing this would be far more to his advantage than a marriage between Sansa and Highgarden. More on this later.

So what's his goal, ultimately? We know he is willing to do almost anything to achieve it. We know his plans are always changing as the board changes around him. By the end of Feast of Crows when we last see Littlefinger his is Lord Paramount of the Trident, ruling over the Riverlands in his own right, and Lord Protector of the Vale, ruling the Vale in Robert Arryn's name. And of course he has the daughter of Ned Stark, to his knowledge the only living heir to Winterfell and the North. That is two of the Seven Kingdoms he is actively ruling and he's working to claim a third. 

A boy of low birth, he took advantage of a friendship struck up between his father, a landed knight, and Lord Hoster Tully, during the war of the Ninepenny Kings. Fostered at one of the great castles of Westeros, Riverrun, he became close to the daughters of the High Lord, Catelyn and Lysa. A classic love triangle ensued, with Catelyn enjoying his attentions knowing she would never be required to return them, and Lysa desperately wanting them. His eventual challenge to Brandon Stark tells us that Littlefinger wasn't the sly manipulator we know him for today, that man would never directly challenge a great warrior in single combat. Soundly beaten by Stark, he is sent back to his dingy keep in the Fingers to recover from his injuries, but not before bedding at least Lysa. When next we meet Littlefinger, he has taken advantage of Lysa's affections (not for the last time) and been charged with customs in Gulltown, quickly rising in the Arryn's service due to his ability to generate revenue, and eventually coming to King's Landing in service to Jon Arryn, then Hand of the King. His talents boost him to Master of Coin and a seat on the small council. 

Now we have seen the key moment in Littlefinger's life. His failure to best Brandon Stark for the hand of Catelyn. The direct approach had failed him, however he clearly hadn't given up his goal of landing a Tully bride, and we begin to see, perhaps, what his endgame truly is. Indeed, the betrayal of Hoster Tully, spurning Littlefinger's suit for his daughter and sending him back to the Fingers in shame, one could say that debt has already been paid. Hoster Tully is dead, his daughters are dead (seemingly) his brother is in exile and his son a captive of the Freys. Hoster Tully's title Lord Paramount of the Trident has passed to Littlefinger. 

But what of the debt owed to the Starks? What of Littlefinger's desire for Catelyn? Brandon Stark and Ned Stark are both dead. Robb Stark is dead. Winterfell is a ruin. The North is held by Boltons and King Winter. Enough for Littlefinger? No, I don't think so. A public shaming in front of those he thought were his family, I believe only when Littlefinger rules the north from the Great Hall of Winterfell, in the seat that should have gone to Brandon Stark will that debt be paid.

As for Catelyn, I believe his maneuvering Lysa to kill Jon Arryn, the event that began the march towards the War of Five Kings, was ultimately put in motion to leave Cat a widow in time to marry the newly christened Lord Paramount. However, when Littlefinger met Sansa, young, beautiful, empty headed Sansa, Littlefinger did what Littlefinger does. He changed his plan, and Sansa became his new goal. 

Of note here is that it was Littlefinger that snatched up the steward's daughter Jeyne Poole after Ned Stark's household was slaughtered. And no doubt Littlefinger suggested to Lord Tywin how useful it would be to have a northern girl familiar with Winterfell and the Starks to pass off as the missing Arya. Of course, as one of the few with this knowledge, and in possession of one of the few people who could denounce Jeyne as an imposter (Sansa) Littlefinger now has a card to play for the whole of the North when the time is right. 

So why allow the marriage to the Imp to go through? And why tell Sansa, now masquerading as Alayne, that he has arranged a match for her with Harold Hardyng. Clearly, having Sansa shipped off to Highgarden to marry Willas Tyrell doesn't suit Littlefinger, but Tyrion Lannister, the reluctant bridegroom, Littlefinger correctly guesses that the Imp will content himself with his whores rather than sully his child bride, allowing the marriage to be annulled when it suits, you guessed it, Littlefinger.

With Harry the Heir, and obscure relation to the Arryn's, the only known claimant to the lordship of the Vale after Sweetrobin, it goes without saying the line of succession after him is quite muddy. Indeed, it is possible that a frustrated crown might just award the lordship to the Lord Paramount of the Trident, especially if he marries the newly widowed Sansa Stark, Lady of the Vale and Heiress to the North. 

And should Aegon Targaryen or Daenerys Targaryen or any of a hundred other claimants to the Iron Throne march on King's Landing and overthrow Tommen or whoever, they will no doubt find a loyal and leal subject, Petyr Baelish, Lord Paramount of the Trident, Lord Protector of the Vale, Lord Consort of the North willing to hand them more than half of the Seven Kingdoms for a seat at the right hand of the throne. And then, it's only a matter of time before the most powerful lord in the Seven Kingdoms usurps the rightful monarch and rules Westeros in his own right, with no one left to stop him.

However, I don't know if this requires a THEORY tag since it doesn't deal with any major theories.) I'm also not a book-reader, which is why this is here as opposed to /r/ASOIAF.

If Stannis did manage to take the Iron Throne, who would his Small Council be? Obviously, Davos would be Hand of the King, but who else would serve him? I don't know if he would retain the services of the advisers at King's Landing or not, since I don't know how far his knowledge of Baelish's treachery extends, or Pycelle's, for that matter. With the exception of Davos and Melisandre, nobody in his retinue really jumped out as an advisor (with the exception of that old guy who died in S2E1), and Melisandre doesn't seem like the sort who would sit on the Small Council proper, so right now in my head, his Small Council chamber is looking pretty barren.",12,15,False,self,,,,,

Just a quick update regarding the actor Reece Noi, who was in Season 4, Oathbreaker as random slave. He is returning in Season 5, initially under the name Keyr, but I have it on good authority that his name has been changed to Mossador at the last minute.

As people who read the books know, Mossador is one of Missandei's brothers (as well as Marselen), who is purchased by Dany with his sister. It's unsure at this point whether the show will retcon Noi's appearance last year as a random slave and make him Missandei's brother; he appears with her and Dany in a throne room scene in S05E01, and speaks in some Valyrian, but it's mainly about the slave pits, and there's no mention of the two characters being related.

In addition to that, he is dressed in a simple Meereen tunic, not any Unsullied clothing like he is in the books.

That said, it seems odd they'd give him a name from the books. My source mentioned that the producers felt Keyr, which they made up, sounded too much like a destination so opted to change it last minute. Noi's character had no name in his S4 appearance.

Source: I was at the premiere on Wednesday in London, have contacts working on the show/close to the actor in question but I'd rather not say any more.",0,0,False,self,,,,,

This bothers me because I completely supported Robb's marriage and it reminded me of dear old dead Ned, he follows his heart and sticks to his beliefs and convictions to the point of stubbornness ie marrying for love rather than a bridge 
And so people say Walder Frey killed him because he was an Oathbreaker blah blah blah but they forget that Roose Bolton and Tywin Lannister were the ones who plotted the entire Red Wedding and they could give two shits about who Robb is married to, the Red Wedding wasn't about who broke who's oath it was really about ending the war. The ordeal with the Freys just gave them a time a place a motive and a pawn, Walder Frey did what he did because he was promised The Riverlands and The Trident, a man who murders people in his home after guest rite obviously doesn't care about honor or keeping your word he saw an opportunity to seize power and took it, like everything in Game of Thrones it's all about the power, his committing murder and regicide because he was offended just doesn't fit his character. If Robb never met Talisa instead of being murdered at his uncles wedding he'd be murdered at his own, Walder Frey had a choice between supporting the Northern Army which was on shaky legs and having a daughter become queen of the north eventually, or himself become lord paramount of the Riverlands. He being the sly weasel that he is picked the safe bet. In short Talisa was good for Robb and I thought made a very interesting character arc and I was very upset when she died. When Robb really lost the war was when he executed Rickard Karstark thus giving him need to go seek Walder Freys help. So if anyone is to blame for the Red Wedding it's Tywin Lannister and company. 

Talisa is literally an innocent bystander leave her alone. ",29,42,False,self,,,,,

My old man and I just finished our rewatch of the series before Season 5 stars. As we were watching 'The Children', in particular the portion involving Dany's crew, I noticed some very interesting shots and edits made as former slave, a man named Fennesz, asks Dany to let him become his Master's servant again.

When he speaks of the younger slaves rejoicing in her world, Fennesz goes on to say older men like him have no other purpose and cannot change. As he says this, there's a close up of Barristan flicking his eyes towards him. This occurs at 2:03
Not long after, Dany says that being free means making your own choices and Barristan glances at her as she says this. Occurs at 2:27
I just thought this was a brilliant and subtle move by Alex Graves to show what is occurring really relates to Barristan Selmy's little personal journey. He is a knight. He is too old to be anything else, which likely gave the man an even worse feeling than when Joffrey shunned him from the Kingsguard. But since he is relieved of his vows, Barristan is able to make his own choice of King, or in this case Queen, to serve.
I think Graves earned a lot of unwarranted hate a few weeks back when people were giving him shit for his commentary on the finale. I watched it for myself, and honestly, his errors weren't as bad as when we were just reading about them.

Graves is a director. Not a writer. And seeing how he films his episodes, 'And Now His Watch Had Ended' 'The Mountain and the Viper' 'The Lion in the Rose' and this one, I've noticed how Graves always works in these interesting and stylistic shots and camera angles/positions. And I think it's both a shame and a loss he won't be around for season 5.",6,71,False,self,,,,,

That give you just over two weeks now to post your works.  All art/craft works inspired by GOT are welcome, so most things posted to this subreddit are ok there.  That includes costumes, sketches, baking, music, poetry, paintings, metalwork, cooking, woodwork, etc.  They don't want fanfic or work that's based on book-only events.  You can also [browse existing submissions](https://www.gameofthronescompendium.com/app/explore) on the site to see what's been submitted.

For anyone not already familiar with the Compendium, here's a HBO quote with the main details:

&gt; The Game of Thrones Compendium site is an official, creative space for fans of the HBO series to showcase their passion for the show. All fan submissions will be viewed by the Council and their favorites will be curated into a printed compendium. If your piece is included you will receive a copy of the book. It will not be for sale.

All submissions will remain on display at the website.  The pieces selected as the ""best"" in the Compendium are going to be published in a print book that will be given to those winners.  I suspect HBO will also use the print book as a special gift similar to [other creative promotions they've done in the past](http://scentmarketingdigest.com/2011/03/24/hbo-spends-a-bundle-on-scent-kit-to-promote-game-of-thrones/).  I've been told some of the ideas for the print book the winners get, and it should be something quite special and unique.  So if you've created something other fans might enjoy, give it a shot.

- Varys tells Lady Olena that LittleFinger is the most dangerous man in Westeros and that he'd burn it all down if he could be the king of its ashes. Why does she then still conspire with LF to kill Joffery? Also, she seems to care for Sansa, she respects Lord Eddard Stark, then why does she team up with LF to involve Sansa in this scheme when she could've easily brought the Stranger in her own pocket/locket?

- Before Theon is given the priviledge to become Reek, he's at Winterfell with the other Ironborn scum. Lord Bolton tells Lord Frey that the Ironborn turned on Theon as was expected and were given a safe passage. What happens to those men? Surely if they would've returned to the Iron Islands sans Reek, they would've had to answer some questions. What does Yara think happened at Winterfell?

This run through I am paying much more attention to the intricacies of the story and it's obvious Varys and Little Finger are going to have it out in one way or another. Are there any hypotheticals you all can think of ? 

The other big deal that is coming to my mind is who is going to kill Cersei although  I believe the post on the front page answers that rather convincingly. 

It is hard for me to create an end game for little finger as his biggest opponent and most clever adversary is Varys. However Varys displays no lust for power but has a desire for control of information (which yields it's own power). while Little Finger blatantly states his intentions and is going to make some sort of play. What that is who knows I'm either not perceptive enough or it's going to come out of nowhere. 

You all always seem to have great insight so I figured I bring this here.

In the books however. Robb just shows up about 150 pages in and introduces Cat to Jeynne Westerling. 

Is this the first time we meet the character in the book or has the show blurred out a past mention of her?

I don't know how reliable is this source, but I really hope it's fake.
However, if it's not, book readers who want to read the books first are going to have a tough time avoiding all the spoilers for the next 5-10 years (we all know how GRRM takes his time) and staying off internet is not possible. The problem is that internet is as you all know, a neverending spoiler source. Since leaving internet until the next book isn't an option here's my  question: would it be possible to create an add-on for firefox/chrome that would allow you to block any page that contains keywords that relate to GoT in order to avoid as much spoilers as possible ?

Right. So I'm about to start reading the books since I got AFFC and ADWD recently. So I'm going to start of from where the show left of. And I know that's an unpopular opinion and that most people think  you should start from book 1 but I'm just not going to do that, you won't convince me so don't try. So I was wondering, where in ASOS does the show end? I've heard that I should read the Epilouge of it since it has a plot twist or something they're going to leave out of the show. I've also heard that I should start from somewhere in the middle.

Basically deleted the last post of this podcast as, since RoddyRuin pointed out to me the name (A Podcast Of Ice &amp; Fire) was already taken, I decided to rename the podcast and thus changed the url as well.

Hopefully the new name isn't taken either, but I did make sure to do a bit of checking this time around. lol. So for those interested (and didn't catch it last time), here's the new link.

NO BOOK SPOILERS, PLEASE. *""



IMO, the last season is all about setting up the real battle to come: The battle of ""fire"" and ""ice.""

The setup is simply placing the characters where they need to be for the battle. Essentially, coincidentally, half the characters end up in the same place at the same time, and the other half at the other place at the that same time.

**Arya, Tyrion, and Varys** have gone across the narrow sea to Essos. There they join the obvious leader of ""fire"" **daenerys** and her supporting cast, including **daario, Jorah, Selmy** and her army of unsullied and more. 

On the ""ice"" side, we have **Jon Snow** the most likely ice leader, most recently joined by **Stannis** and his army, **Mance** and his army, also just reached that part is **Bran** and his small group, including **Hodor**. Also **sam** and **gilly** and the rest of the remainders up north.

Meanwhile, in the middle of these, we have **cersei** who has obviously been fucked by the recent events, accompanied by **Jamie**, and their people. Further north, you have the **Boltons** including **Ramsay,** And in between them, you have **Littlefinger** and **Sansa.**

So, essentially, you have two huge factions on either side, with some stuff in the middle.

Now for some speculation: Wouldn't the biggest fuck you to cersei be, that for all her machinations, when the big war comes, its all for nothing. she will be quashed like a fly between both sides. Same for the Boltons. 

Littlefinger can go either way, either his worminess can only get him so far, or he will always remain that guy in the middle who can play all sides of the game, and always come out on top.


Also, the Tyrells are obviously going to be important this coming season, but I have no idea what they will be all about, so, I can't really speculate yet.

Daenerys paid for the lives of her dragons with those of her son, her husband, and the witch.

While her son was already used as payment to keep Drogo alive, it was not "" life"" as Dany said.

I think the fate of her dragons will match those three in some ways. One will promise Dany what is most valuable to her, but betray her and end up paying for it with his life (the witch). One will remain loyal to Dany up until he is killed by the betrayer (or at least mortally wounded and mercy-killed by Dany) as a consequence of Dany's actions (Drogo).

Anyway, about a month ago my mother out of the blue decided to watch it, and she loved it (even though she wasn't that great with keeping up with the finer detail in the story-line like family tree's, names &amp; locations, but she understood the general outline of what was going on).

So my sister is currently living with us for a few weeks, and she has always said terrible things about Game of Thrones (even though she hadn't watched it, or seen anything to do with it, it was simply because I was obsessed with it). But mum decides to show her it, and she'd watch seasons 1-4 again with my sister who'd be watching it for the first time.

And oh my sweet jesus, I can't take it. I can hear them talking 75% of the time during every episode. Most of the time about irrelevant things, but even worse is when they talk about the show while it's on, and completely over thinking things &amp; saying the stupidest shit. My mum keeps referring to the Nights Watch as ""The Black Knights"". They think Rob Baratheon is Ned Starks brother. They keep saying stuff like ""Daenarys &amp; Rob Stark [even though they pronounce there names wrong] want the throne"" as if it's all about who sits on the throne. They keep getting Tyrion &amp; Tywin mixed up due to there names. They pay no attention to some scenes that mean so much to the plot. AND THEY HAVE NO IDEA HOW PAINFUL IT IS.

The only way I can stop getting annoyed is when I realize, hey, Game of Thrones is the most popular story in the world. My mother &amp; sister's opinion mean nothing. There are millions out there just like me who are just as obsessed, and known everything to the smallest detail.

Anyone else out there ever been through something like this?

I'm sorry but I had to express my feelings as I was about to burst with rage! Thanks for reading if you did! (P.s. I'm 22, male. my sisters 24)

Counting the days til' season 5. I'll definitely be watching seasons 1-4 *again* before April 12th. #ValarMorghulis",9,1,False,self,,,,,

No Lady Stoneheart or new main characters introduced in this episode :("")

Now that that's out of the way, here's what I remember. Trying to write it all down before I forget more details! Scenes not might be in exact order. It's off the top of my head. Sorry in advanced that I suck with names.

First scene is flash back of Cersei as a child where she gets her fortune told about someone more young and beautiful replacing her as queen.

Next scene is Cersei in the present at the funeral of Tywin. She and Jaime visit Tywin's body privately. Jaime says they need to make sure the other houses don't destroy everything their father built. Cersei is, of course, obsessed with getting revenge against Tyrion and blames Jaime for indirectly leading to their father's death. Jaime has a guilty look. She makes him feel more guilty by saying that Jaime was Tywin's favorite person.

Next scene is Tyrion getting out of his barrel. Funny moments ensue where he complains about having to throw his shit out of a hole through the barrel...Varys tells him he had to throw shit from outside the barrel into the ocean. Tyrion drinks copious amounts of wine, throws up and drinks more wine right after.

Next scene is the one from the trailers of a giant statue being torn off a pyramid.

Next scene is one of the unsullied going to a brothel to get cuddled. Suddenly their throat is slit from a person wearing a golden mask.

Next scene is Daenarys being pissed off about this and ordering more unsullied patrols. She feels guilty about her locked up dragons and goes for a visit. I jumped a little in this scene. The room is very dark and then suddenly both dragon's are roaring out fire...not directly at her but you can tell they are very unhappy being locked up. Daenarys seems unsettled and scared and runs quickly back out of the dragon's dungeon.

Scene where Brienne is despondent and doesn't know what to do anymore with her life. Talks to her squire Podrick about how Arya didn't want her help and Sansa is probably dead. She also tells Podrick to go off on his own, she isn't a knight so he isn't a squire. She says she isn't his mother. Sansa and Little Finger ironically are riding by in a fancy carriage right after this scene but Brienne doesn't know or care who is inside. Little Finger is taking Sansa West, somewhere where Cersei would never think to look, he says. In a scene before this, they drop off Robin Arryn with another lord.

Here's where I get more hazy on scene ordering.

Tyrion and Varys are talking again. Varys explains how he wants Daenarys to rule the iron throne and wants Tyrion's help in getting her there. He says he can either drink himself to death or help out Daenarys. Tyrion suggests on a compromise of drinking himself to death on the way to helping out Daenarys.

I don't remember where the wall scenes happen in ordering but here is what happens there.

Jon Snow is training some kid how to fight. Melisandre comes for him saying Stannis wants to see him. They ride up the wall elevator together and Jon asks if she is cold. She says she is warmed by the light or whatever. Jon meets with Stannis Baratheon and Stannis explains that he wants the wildlings to fight for him in the North to get the North back. He thinks it'll be easier now that Tywin is dead. He wants Jon Snow to convince the king beyond the wall to take the knee. Jon meets with the king beyond the wall and of course he doesn't agree to do it. Jon says he's making a huge mistake because he is better alive then dead. He tells Jon that he respects him. The show ends with the king beyond the wall getting burned to death, right as he's about to suffer the most from the fires Jon mercifully puts an arrow threw his heart. [Book Spoilers](#b ""...(or is he dead according to /r/asoiaf theories)"")

More scenes where I can't remember the placement:

Oh, I also forgot there is a gay scene with Loras Tyrell and Maergery walks in on it. She is unfazed because brothers and sisters have weird relationships in the Game of Thrones universe but tells her brother he should be more discreet. He replies, why? everyone already knows anyway. Everyone knows everything about everyone at King's Landing. They discuss how he is supposed to marry Cersei and he says he doesn't have to now that Tywin is dead. He says that she wants him to marry her to get rid of her at King's Landing. If they married she'd move to the High Garden and Maergery wouldn'y have to worry about Cersei at King's Landing anymore.

Also, another scene with Daario and Daenarys. A previous scene was with a politician saying they would concede to Daenarys demands, just let them reopen the fighting pits. In this scene, Daario is naked (lots of man butt this episode) trying to convince her that the fighting pits are good. He says he was a slave who was freed because he was so good in the fighting pits.

Also remembered there was a scene between Cersei and her cousin Lancel. He is super pious now with the Seven Gods. Cersei is laughing at his piousness. He asks for forgiveness for his wine serving murder plot of Robert Baratheon and for their inappropriate love. She laughs everything off.

&amp;nbsp;


Take Tywin for example. In the show, he shares a few scenes with Arya (which never happens in the books) and he seems to have a nice side to him as he talk to her about his past. I would even go as far as to call him likeable, as we even see him smile a few times. In the books however, he is always cold and serious and never shows his true feelings or any kind of appreciation for another character.

&amp;nbsp;


Another example: In the show, Ygritte escapes Jon when his first swing with the sword misses, and then he chases her and finally catches up with her. In the book however, it is Jon who CHOSES to let her go, showing that he has a good heart and is not able to kill a defenseless woman. Not showing this in the show takes away an important scene imo, where we see a very important quality of Jon Snow's character. I could go ahead and talk about Gregor Clegane, but i think you get my point.


&amp;nbsp;


So this made me wonder what you guys think? Am i exaggerating a bit or do you feel like the show portrays some characters in a different light as well??",32,10,False,self,,,,,

I'm assuming that most would know about Robb's marriage to one of the freys, and they would know how the freys might react. Based on this, it seems that Tywin might have orchestrated this in order to kill Robb. Some evidence around this includes the fact that Tywin wasn't really mad about the Westerling betrayal, in fact, Tyrion remarks that the Westerlings weren't even punished. Along with that, it was said that Jeyne was sent to Robb to ""comfort him"", implying the father planned this. Thoughts?",8,11,False,self,,,,,

She barely had enough to buy 10 soldiers when she were negotiating with the slave master, so I would assume that she doesn't have enough gold to afford the required resouces.

Then her dragons burnt down the city, there shouldn't be much left for them to eat either. 

8000 men is a not a small number. Imaging the amount of water and food needed to just sustain 100 normal people for a week, all while on the move too, then times that by 80. 

I don't think she even has that much men to keep the supplies moving. The unsullied definitely aren't carrying things, they have to hold shields and spears in their hands. So who's carrying the supplies for her then? 

I know this is fantasy, but the more I think about it the less I'm convinced that Daenerys actually has a ""scary army"" alongside her. More like ""8000 starving skinny men who can barely wield their weapons"".",13,6,False,self,,,,,

That being said, I was watching S2E10 last night when Daenerys enters the House of the Undying and walks through the various prophecies. While the show version is very different than the book version, I never could quite figure out the final part of her vision.

The first part where she enters the snow covered throne room is open to a few valid interpretations, but the second part where she meets Khal Drogo again and her unborn son had always thrown me for a loop. Then I was watching last night and I started thinking, ""In what scenario would she encounter Khal Drogo and her unborn child again?"" I couldn't think of anything else besides in the after life; but what does that have to do with The Wall, where she found them?

Then it finally hit me, what if this prophecy is so literal that I glanced right over it. I think with the general consensus of the story arc that it is safe to say that Dany will be an integral part in the fight against the White Walkers towards the end of the story. What if this vision is showing us that once she goes to The Wall, she will be going to the after life; aka she will die?

If you believe what Mirri Maz Duur says in AGOT about Daenerys never having children again, she wouldn't be a great fit to sit in the Iron Throne at the end anyways.

**TL;DR** I think Daenerys will die at the end of the series in the battle against the White Walkers/Others

As we all know the show is split up in to little sections for each storyline. There's scenes about The Hound and Arya, scenes about Kings Landing, scenes about Daenerys, scenes up at the wall etc etc.

Each episode, there is only a few scenes from each of these storylines shown. I'm wondering if anyone has ever taken the individual sections and complied them all together in one string. For example, take Bran's storyline. What if someone was to take all of his scenes and put them together, so it was exclusively showing everything Bran had been through.
I'm not sure if I'm wording this well at all. It's 4:30am and I'm quite tired. Hopefully you guys understand what I mean. If not, maybe I can try and word it better.

After the fight between them and Beric's resurrection, before the Hound is released Beric says:

""The Lord of Light isn't done with you yet."" 

Now this could mean that he will die and the punishment for his crimes would have been delivered. But it also leads me to believe in the small possibility that the Hound may still be alive, saved by the Lord of Light",7,5,False,self,,,,,
