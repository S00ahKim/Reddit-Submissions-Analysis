The reveal of Jon's true origin was emotional but even further so because it made me realize what a man Ned was. 

His one glaring flaw was that he had a bastard. Everything else about him was the image of a leader, gentleman, just lord, and knight. He endured that throughout his life. He put the safety of Jon so highly that he didn't even let his wife know the truth. 

He's out of place in a world filled with dishonor and he was killed for it early on. Still, he managed to raise great children (despite the fact that his children could easily choose to abuse their power), was a great lord, and earned the respect of pretty much everyone. 

Ultimately, Ned is who raised Jon to be the man, leader, and likely savior of the realm. He's more than just that guy who died in Season 1. The North remembers. 


EDIT: He's also the reason that people unite in the North and why the Stark name lives on. People remember the man he was and see that through his children. Had he not been such a respected lord, the North would've been lost without question. ",12,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

I know there's been a lot of theories about it, but I think it's going to be as simple as Tyrion being the one to kill her. Where I am in the books, Cersei has a bounty on Tyrions head after he killed Tywin and fled. In one scene she hears out someone who claims to have brought her Tyrion's head. When she's listening to him he states ""I bring you justice. I bring you the head of your volanqar"" The book then states how that word sends a chill through her. I think it's going to be as simple as Dany overtaking The Red Keep, having Cersei cornered, and Tyrion being the one to actually kill her.

1. It'll be a trial by combat style of duel in an arena

2. There will be no one there to hand a replacement weapon and no one can interfere 

3. Anyone who fights Jaime will be in his/her prime

4. Whoever fights Jaime will be given the armor and weapons of their choice (no magic or curses) 

5. No pets of any kind (that means you dire wolves/dragons) 

6. NO Non-Humans 



My own opinions:
TIER S: Arthur Dayne: Chance of winning= 99%. Jaime is screwed. He is the best swordsman to ever live that we are aware of. The TV show reveals that he is a video game character in an otherwise ""realistic"" fantasy world. 



TIER A: Barristan Selmy: Chance of winning= 70%. He has more experience and is easily regarded as one of the best fighters in the realm. We see him well past his prime and he's still better than almost anyone. 



Tier B: 
Brandon Stark: Chance of winning= 50%. We don't really know enough here but I think this would be by far the most even fight. 


Oberyn Martell: Chance of winning= 50%. He's a beast and he beat The Mountain. His own anger and arrogance got the better of him. 




Tier B-: AKA Jaime would win but it would be very tough: Khal Drogo, The Mountain, Bronn, and Robert Baratheon  



Tier C: Jaime would win but it would be tough: Brienne of Tarth, The Hound, Grey Worm 



Honorable Mention: Karl (Jaime would slice him into pieces but it would be interesting), Loras (not enough battle experience, an extremely talented swordsman but still a child of war) 



There are tons of other characters and I'm sure I missed some. I didn't want to type out a bunch of other names just to state that Jaime would wipe the floor with them. I'm sure some people would love to argue for a Wildling. 



Would love to hear your opinions.

Why didn't the children of the forrest have dragon glass? They used it in the past. Did they suddenly forget that dragon glass kills white walkers? Did they lose it all? They should have had some stashed away somewhere. They could have had dragon glass tipped arrows to shoot at the night king instead of those bombs that appeared to not harm the white walkers at all. 

2. How did Meera kill that one white walker? She chucked a spear at him. Was the tip of the spear made of dragon glass? 

3. The white walkers were asleep for thousands of years. You can tell some of them are more aged than others. A little odd that the night king looks the youngest out of all the white walkers, considering he was the first one.... right? With that said, where are the baby white walkers Craster was offering? Are they just going from baby to grown ass white walker ready to fuck shit up in a matter of days? Or is there some kind of mother white walker watching over them as they get older?

4. Why did the last child of the forrest sacrifice herself? She could've just chucked the bomb she had with her at the end of the hall and it would've had the same effect. Was the the last of the children of the forrest? Are they extinct now?

5. The look on Bran's face when he realizes that Hodor's entire life was to serve, protect, and die for him..... Bran was crushed. You could see it in his face. It's like his soul left him at that moment. Poor Bran. Poor Hodor. ",14,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

GRRM has confirmed that Dunk and Egg and Robert's rebellion are out.  To be honest it quite baffles me. Dunk and Egg was out which could also means that Blackfyre rebellion is out too since these two are closely related and occurs at the same era/timeline. Robert's rebellion is out too because there will be no surprise events and the end results is pretty much known. But the implication caused by this choice would be enormous.If we follow the same premise, this pretty much rules out  Aegon's conquest, Andal's Invasion, The Doom of Valyria, The First Long Night even all the way back to when the First Men arrives in westeros.

Atleast, they are supposed to be. One big difference on the show is that the characters seem take a lot of these things very lightly. That, IMO, sort of detracts from the rich world of the books. 

Sansa is a good example, being married to Ramsay while Tyrion was still alive with the excuse ""they never consummated the marriage"". Jamie and Cersei seem to have foregone all pretense about their relationship and where the kids came from. Dorne actually accepted bastard leadership. Even if Doran was weak and needed to be removed, actually accepting a bastard instead of looking for a distant Martell cousin is unconventional. 

Then there is Jon. We, as fans, accept the loophole of his vows pretty easily - but for all the Northern Lords to not even question his desertion? And then declare him the King while the ligitimate heir sits right next to him? 

Ofcourse, they need to move the story along pretty fast and having the characters quibble over the details only to eventually end up at the same place would be a waste. But I still think that flouting convention out of convenience was a bad plot device.

A lot of characters seemed like they were in a stable place and it seemed logical to skip ahead a few years while they got better prepared for their next step. Dany could've stayed in Mereen and learned to rule, while also learning how to control her dragons. Jon could've remained the Lord Commander, preparing for the WW. Cersei could've stayed in prison. Riverlands would've had a chance to get back shape a little. Arya would've continued her training and the same goes for Sansa. And Davos could've looked for Rickon. Brienne could've kept looking for the Stark girls. Basically, for most of those books, it felt like characters were treading water anyway - so why not have them do it offscreen?

And then the story could've restarted right in the middle of winter - with spring looking a lot closer. At this pace, however, even when the book ends, we'll be left in the middle of the Winter with years of cold and starvation ahead. Not to mention, some of the character growth is likely to end up feeling rushed. 

I think I read somewhere that GRRM was dead set against any time-skip. Is that true? How would you have felt if we'd had one?

Rape scene. Yes, I know that there is much debate about whether it actually was rape or not. But, let's assume for the duration of this post that it was. Let's assume that Cersei did mean ""No, not here"" and Jamie didn't care. 

What was the big deal about it? 

And I don't mean from a feminist pov or something about depiction of rape on media or latent misogyny or using female characers as a tool for male ones. I'm not interested in all that - I'm talking about this being a problem from the perspective of Jamie's character development. Because I recall that that was a complaint a lot of people had - that after some great character development in season 3, Jamie just went back to being his usual dick self. 

But I didn't see much in the way of character *development* in Jamie. I saw nuances being added to the character - which was well done - but not much in terms of actual change. Before, we saw him as an arrogant, entitled dick and thought that that was all to him. But eventually, we saw that he did have a heart and some decency, that there were some lines too horrible for him to cross, that he could genuinely grow to care for other people and not be a selfish bastard all the time. But he was still arrogant and entitled and that part of him never went away - despite losing his hand and being humiliated. He felt entitled to demand that Brienne come with him and even after Roose had refused, he forced the issue. You might see it as being heroic for Brienne's sake, but only someone with a sense of entitlement would presume to make demands like that. 


With Cersei, it sure looks like more of the same. He had risked his life to come back to her. He had sworn those stupid oaths to Catelyn for that. Even killed his cousin. He was entitled to Cersei's love for his efforts and her refusal was just meaningless, petty torment. Having some good qualities doesn't mean that everything bad is just erased. Nor doing something bad mean that you aren't capable of being good again. Jamie is a grey character - he can be heroic for saving Brienne and he can be villainous for raping Cersei. So, what's the issue people have with it?

In the final encounter between the Waif and Arya, the theory goes on to say that the Waif actually killed Arya and stole her face, which is why Jaqen said that she had finally become ""no one"" when the face is brought/added to the wall of faces, as if she was dead. Arya's behavior after this also leads to believe she could be the Waif if you look at her posture and how she walks and carries herself, it's identical to the Waif, not Arya. She also uses her right hand, despite Arya being left handed. What do you guys think of this? At first, I thought it was a stretch but after watching the video and looking at the evidence, it seems plausible. Honestly, I hope this is fake and it doesn't happen in the show or books (I follow both) but it does make a LOT of sense. What do you all think about this theory? Do you think it could be true?

The only time we've seen him in the show is in flashback. We're told he was one of Ned Stark's closest allies, yet even when Ned is killed and the North goes to war, Howland is nowhere to be seen. He eventually sends his children to pledge allegiance, but we learn from them that their father has never talked about the Tower of Joy. In the book, it's more clear that Howland has never left the Neck since returning from the Tower of Joy, but I'm not sure that's been made explicit in the show.

From the book and show, I'm under the impression Howland has made a conscious choice to remain in the Neck as part of his effort to never reveal Ned Stark's secret. Does anyone else think this?",25,51,False,spoiler,,,,,

Needle in a haystack. If this isn't the time for exactly that then I don't think I know what is. 

I've been redditing a lot more than usual lately and noticed a recurring prediction that Arya will sail 'West of Westeros', in many comment boards, from a range of people, or at least a broad agreement that she will factor in the end-game and see the end of the story outright... My question is this... HOW??!

She's not Frodo Baggins, Vincent Vega has more in common with Frodo than Arya does and Arya has more in common with Vincent Vega than Frodo does. She's a killer. We've seen her progress down a specific path and absolutely key to that journey has been isolation. Syrio, The Hound, Jaqen and even The Waif have passed through her life. The Hound nearly became a source of reliably consistency (in his own way) until he was struck down, Pot Pie and Gendry came and went, and as such she was left un-distracted from her ultimate goal which was that list, her short-term goal was to become powerful enough to do so. 

So she starts 'taking names', has her first kill, then another, learns how to kill through instinct then through finesse, she has discipline and focus for one thing only, and that's the point, Arya Stark has to disappear. If she wants to be the killer she feels she needs to be then she has to forget herself and let 'a girl' do what must be done. So how does she wake up from that? How does she carry the weight of each kill forward and not have some penalty to pay?? 

I know thrones is essentially 'chaos on random' but there's only one direction this arc is headed and it's to the pointy end of a sword. I know it's a divisive topic and I'm far from bucking the trend but you don't just come back from what she's experiencing. Infact, I wouldn't be that surprised if Arya isn't a shock death come Season 7's end. She's headed for Cersei, we know that everything indicates that, and we've just found out how easily she can slip in and out of chaotic situations when she successfully 'ticked' Walder off the list... We also clocked her acknowledgement of Jamie's presence. 

Season 1, episode 1. Jamie/Cersei + Stark Kid = Break the Internet
Why wouldn't something like that happen again, a mirrored situation where instead of pushing a child out a window to protect himself and Cersei he opts instead to help the child and sacrafice himself or Cersei in the process. My best guess is Cersei and Arya die...

... side by side... on the floor... Jamie left stricken...camera pans out over the statue outside(if still standing)... 

... sparrows...

I'm just saying, she needs/deserves something less Frodo B and more Walter W for her conclusion.

""Beneath his cowl all she could see was the faint red glitter of candlelight reflecting off his eyes. ""What place is this?"" she asked him. ""A place of peace"", His voice was gentle. ""You are safe here.""

He asks her if she fears death, she says no and he tests her.

""Let us see."" The priest lowered his cowl. Beneath he had no face, only a yellowed skull with a few scraps of skin, still clinging to his cheeks, **and a white worm wrigling from one empty eye socket**. ""Kiss me, child,"" he croaked in a voice as dry and husky as a death rattle.""

And then from Bran -

""Seated on his throne of roots int he great cave, half-corpse and half-tree, Lord Brynden seemed less a man than some ghastly statue made of twisted wood, old bone, and rotted wool. The only thing that looked alive in the pale ruin that was his face was his one red eye, burning like the last coal in a dead fire, surrounded by twisted roots and tatters of leathery white skin hanging off a yellowed skull.

The sight of him still frightened Bran -- the weirwood roots snaking in and out of his withered flesh, the mushrooms spouting from his cheeks, **the white wooden worm that grew from the socket where one eye had been**. He liked it better when the torches were put out. In the dark he could pretend that it was the three-eyed crow who whispered to him and not some grisly talking corpse.""

Arya has been learning from death. 

Has Bran also been learning from death?

I know we see the face of The Three Eyed Raven in the show, so it's a reaching idea. I just think it's interesting that such a similar description was used for such powerful, magical characters. ",3,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

Davos was reborn amidst salt and smoke under a bleeding star. Davos resurrected Jon Snow and woke the dragon from stone. Davos is the savior that will protect the world from darkness. Davos is the Prince that was Promised.

The prophecy of Azor Ahai reborn (or the Prince that was Promised, Warrior of Light, the Lord's Chosen, etc.) can be tied to several characters, including Jon, Dany, or even some combination of multiple people. ***Here I will lay out the case for Davos Seaworth, the Prince that was Promised.*** 

Note that I am primarily a show watcher, and so this argument will be largely drawn from that perspective, with some quotes from the books and Wikis to fill gaps where needed. Show clips are linked throughout the post.

***Season 2, Episode 1: Sword***

&gt; In the ancient books it is written that a Warrior will draw a burning sword from the fire, and that sword shall be Lightbringer. Stannis Baratheon, Lord of Light, your sword awaits you. ~ Melisandre, S02E01

* [As seen in this clip, this quote is spoken](https://streamable.com/6nqj1) by Melisandre as she burns effigies of the ""false gods,"" with Stannis and his followers in attendance. This is the first TV mention of the prophecy. Stannis walks forward, pulls the flaming sword from the fire, [and sticks it in the sand as shown here.](https://streamable.com/d6r9e) By now, obviously, we know Stannis was not the true Warrior as Melisandre had believed.

* However, sixty seconds after Stannis plants the burning sword among the pyres, when everyone has left the beach, [Davos walks over to the sword and casually picks it up, then walks away with it, as seen here.](https://streamable.com/h4vjs)

***Season 2, Episode 9 &amp; Season 3, Episode 1: Rebirth***

&gt; When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers, Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt... ~ Melisandre, ADWD Jon X

Examining the heavier part of this quote first, ***""...Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt...""***

* At the Battle of the Blackwater, Davos is [blasted from his ship by wildfire](https://streamable.com/opkwx):

&gt; Everyone thought you were dead. ~ Salladhor Saan, S03E01

&gt; I had heard you were dead. ~ Stannis Baratheon, S03E01

* Water is used pervasively in literature as a metaphoric mechanism of ***cleansing and rebirth***. Fire is also widely used as a symbol for ***rebirth, renewed life, burning away corruption,*** etc. Davos ""comes back to life"" in the Season 3 premiere as he wakes up on an island, rescued by Salladhor Saan, who even says:

&gt; You've only just come back to life. Stay alive a little longer, my friend. ~ [Salladhor Saan, S03E01](https://streamable.com/kvlei)

* Thus, Davos is reborn amidst smoke (wildfire) and salt (seawater). The metaphorical implications of Davos's rebirth can be thoroughly examined, but that's for another post.

As for the first part of the quote, ***""When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers...""***

* This is likely the most ""on-the-nose"" portion of the prophecy. The bleeding red star likely [refers to the red comet shown in this screencap,](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/0/06/Red_Comet.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120402222532) which is noted and commented upon by several characters across Westeros and Essos, throughout Season 2.
* Darkness could literally refer to the nighttime Battle of the Blackwater, or metaphorically to impending winter, cold, death, doom, unknown and all the other symbolic interpretations of ""darkness"" that need no further explaining.

***Season 6, Episode 2: Waking a Dragon***

&gt;...shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons from the stone. ~ Melisandre, ADWD Jon X

* By Season 6, Melisandre has become disillusioned with the Lord of Light and her powers. Empty, lost, and directionless, she loses faith until [Davos convinces her to try and resurrect Jon Snow, as seen in this scene here.](https://streamable.com/el3cq)

&gt; I saw you drink poison that should have killed you. I saw you give birth to a demon made of shadows. Fuck [the Lord], then. Fuck all of them. I'm not a devout man, obviously. Seven gods, drowned gods, tree gods, it's all the same. I'm not asking the Lord of Light for help. I'm asking the woman who showed me that miracles exist. ~ Davos Seaworth, S06E02

* During the resurrection scene, Jon Snow is laid out on a stone slab. Melisandre performs the ritual and...nothing happens. Tormund leaves, Melisandre leaves, Edd leaves. [Only Davos stays. He lingers, as seen from this clip here.](https://streamable.com/wp36m) He approaches Jon, internally begging, pleading, willing, praying for his return. Shortly after, Jon gasps his first breath.

* The delay between the ritual and first breath was not a dramatic pause. Melisandre did not resurrect Jon Snow. She never believed she could, nor did she have any faith left in the cause. Davos did. ***Davos, not Melisandre, brought Jon Snow back to life. Davos woke the dragon from stone.***

***Misc***

* [In this interview here with Rolling Stone](https://streamable.com/rw1va), Liam Cunningham (who plays Davos) says that the first time he met GRRM, he was told a secret that he hadn't told anyone, and that he was excited about it. Could mean that Davos has a big part left to play in the story. [He mentions it again in this Conan interview here.](https://streamable.com/l20bo)

* In fantasy epics, the secondary character or companion is often the real hero of the story. Notably, in LOTR, from which GRRM takes much of his inspiration, Samwise Gamgee is the true savior of Middle Earth. Is Davos Seaworth the true savior of Westeros?

I was reading this passage between Jon and Melisandre:

""Would you know if the king was dead?"" Jon asked the Red Priestess.
      ""He is not dead. Stannis is the Lord's chosen, destined to lead the fight against the dark. I have seen it in the flames, read of it in ancient prophecy. When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers, Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone. Dragonstone is the place of smoke and salt.""

Jon goes on to argue a valid point that while Stannis was the Lord of Dragonstone, he wasn't born there.
So, take it in and read it again (if someone has posted this exact thing before, my apologies!)

DAENERYS IS AZOR AHAI!

*She was born of smoke and salt - at Dragonstone.

*She was REBORN out of fire/smoke in the fire that did not kill her.

*She woke dragons out of petrified dragon eggs - basically stone - during that same fire.

All of this points to Dany. No one else fits the bill, unless Mel is a complete whack-job.

So, Daenerys is Azor Ahai, confirmed?

Ive had this theory for a while now and just thought someone else might have it too but I havent seen anything on here or anywhere on the internet. Also yes, I am aware this is cliche/predictable but it was fun to come up with. Here goes nothing: the Iron Thrones is destroyed, everything is back to the way it was before Aegon and his sister came to unite the kingdoms. Bran is a very old man now. He may be part of a tree, like how Bloodraven was before him; not dead but not all alive either. There is a young kid with Bran, a greenseer just like him. Everything from Ned beheading the Nights Watch deserter to Cersei blowing up the sept to everything that is happening in season 7 and eight has been in the past. Bran has been showing all these events to the young kid to teach him to be the next Three Eyed Raven. Bran is doing exactly what Bloodraven did to him, he is showing this kid everything. Again this is just my theory and if you dont like it thats fine. I know this wont happen but I love this theory anyway. I know it's cheesy and bs you don't have to remind me but I like it and I thought I should share it! Anyways hope you all are having a great day:)",16,11,False,spoiler,,,,,

In the scene where Davos confronts Melisandre, it also comes out that she and Stannis murdered Shireen in order to appeal to the Lord of Light, who also (supposedly) resurrected Jon. Does anyone else thinks that this could furthers contribute to Jon's uneasiness and ambivalence about coming back to life? He was already distraught about the fact that he was murdered by his own people for doings whats he believed was for the greater good and now he learns that a child was burned alive and that it could have been why he was allowed to return from the dead. Now he's Kings of the North and has to fights the White Walkers. Lords only know what he is going to have to sacrifice in orders to defeat them...

This all leads to my theory that at the end, humans will indeed come out victorious and that Jon will play a crucial role but instead of taking the Iron Throne or being an integral part in the rebuilding of Westeros, he will instead go off into exile by himself (my personal theory would be up north where the Wall once stood) as he will be unable to handle all that he has done and all that has needed to happen in order for the war to be won. This not only would constitute a ""bitter sweet"" ending but also mirror Lord of the Rings, one of Martin's major influences.

# Introduction

We all know about how GRRM loves to subvert fantasy tropes. Liam Cunningham admitted that GRRM told him a secret unknown to the rest of the cast that has him excited in [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTUV6n2mOVY). So, what could it be?

Davos, rather than being the Prince Who Was Promised, is actually Lightbringer.

---
# The Legend of Lightbringer

Lightbringer is not fully described in the shows, so here's the description from the [asoiaf wiki](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lightbringer);

&gt; Darkness lay over the world and a hero, Azor Ahai, was chosen to fight against it. To fight the darkness, Azor Ahai needed to forge a hero's sword. He labored for thirty days and thirty nights until it was done. However, when he went to temper it in water, the sword broke. He was not one to give up easily, so he started over. The second time he took fifty days and fifty nights to make the sword, even better than the first. To temper it this time, he captured a lion and drove the sword into its heart, but once more the steel shattered. The third time, with a heavy heart, for he knew before hand what he must do to finish the blade, he worked for a hundred days and nights until it was finished. This time, he called for his wife, Nissa Nissa, and asked her to bare her breast. He drove his sword into her breast, her soul combining with the steel of the sword, creating Lightbringer, while her cry of anguish and ecstasy left a crack across the face of the moon.

To summarize the dense text:

* Azor Ahai needed a hero's sword to fight the darkness (Others, White Walkers).
* He labored for 30 days and 30 nights, but when he tempered the steel (likely valyrian) in water, it broke.
* Then, he labored for 50 days and 50 nights, but when he tempered it with a lion's heart, it broke.
* Finally, he labored for 100 days and 100 nights, and he stabbed the sword into the heart of his wife, Nissa Nissa.
* It is said that the sword of fire, Lightbringer, was created.

## Take the literal meaning with a Grain of Salt

Remember, this is a legend that's the basis of a religion. The tale of Azor Ahai is meant to sound magnificent, and it's highly unlikely that anything happened literally; but, the interpretation is likely the same.

## An Interpretation

Lightbringer is a tool used by Azor Ahai to defeat the Others (White Walkers). Although this has been interpreted as a sword, a tool could also be a commander. The man telling the soldiers how to swing their swords is more effective than a man who swings a sword.

His will be the interpretation that I will be using as the basis of my argument.

---
# Evidence

## Quotes

Most of the information about lightbringer comes from Davos' chapters. 

Davos' shadow is unusually described as;

&gt; The wind sighed through the chamber, and in the hearth the flames gusted and swirled. He listened to the logs crackle and spit. **When Davos left the window his shadow went before him, tall and thin, and fell across the Painted Table like a sword.** (ASoS Part 2, page 290 UK paperback edition) 

Melisandre, recognizes their is power inside of him;

&gt; Is the brave Ser Onion so frightened of a passing shadow? Take heart ,then. Shadows only live when given birth by light, and the kings fires burn so low I dare not draw off any more to make another son. It might well kill him. Melisandre moved closer. With another man, though**a man whose flames still burn hot and high**if you truly wish to serve your kings cause, come to my chamber one night. I could give you pleasure such as you have never known, and with your life-fire I could make (ASoS Part 1, page 347, UK paperback edition)

Although this does not prove Davos is Lightbringer, it shows that Mel recognizes ""fiery"" power within him.

When Davos is released to Stannis in ASoS, there is an interesting line;

&gt; Take the torch, Ser Axell commanded the gaoler. Leave the traitor to the darkness.

&gt; No, his brother said. Axell, please, **dont take the light**gods have mercy. (ASoS, Part 1, page 489, UK paperback edition)

Here, Davos is literally being referred to as ""the light"". 

## The Rebirth

One of the most prominent parts of the legend of Lightbringer is the three attempts. Davos, has been figuratively remade three times.

### First Time

Becoming Stannis's Knight. Davos was first remade when Stannis cut off his fingers. Davos was a smuggler and pirate before his tenure under Stannis. After Davos' actions led to the end of the Siege of Storm's End, Stannis knighted Davos; however, as punishment for his past actions, Davos was to have all his fingers above the joints on his left hand removed. Davos kept the sack of fingers on his neck, as a symbol of bringing his family into a better environment. Davos, as a pirate, was tempered in water.

### Second Time

The Battle of Blackwater Bay. During this time, Davos was nearly killed, while his son died. He lost the pouch on his neck which signified his connection to the past and his ideals. Davos was lost; yet, he was found by Stannis once again. He continued to be tempered. In fact, the Lion's Heart plays a role here; the wildfire was sent by Tyrion of House Lannister, whose sigil is a red lion on a gold field.

### Third Time
Note: this is the shakiest one

The death of Shireen. Shireen was the most important person in Davos' life, as he acted as her father in lieu of Stannis. When Shireen died, Davos died figuratively. Davos' children have all died, and now his proxy child was dead. Davos finds Shireen's wooden toy among the ashes. There is a beautiful [shot](http://highlighthollywood.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/got-bastard-31.jpg) of the sun rising as Davos discover's the ashes. Sun rising is often associated with rebirth. In the original tale of Lightbringer, the sword is created as it merges with Nissa Nissa's soul; here, Shireen's soul has permanently been ""merged"" with Davos as he carries a memory of her, the wooden horse he made her.

#### A Contradiction

The Time Periods. None of these events happened in the span of 30, 50, and 100 days respectively. However, it is likely that the original tale's days just for show. 

## Jon Snow and Stannis Baratheon

Melisandre originally envisioned Stannis as the Prince who was Promised. Later, she realized she had misinterpreted, realizing that Jon Snow was. Melisandre is a greater seer, but terrible at interpreting her visions. What remains constant between her two interpretations?

That's right, Davos. 

With Stannis, Davos served as the hand of the king. He commanded Stannis' forces loyally. Under Jon Snow, Davos played a pivotal role in the Battle of the Bastards, and he will continue to. 

---
# It would just be cool as hell.

For every theory, there is an equal and opposite theory. GRRM hates fantasy tropes and Game of Thrones exists as a subversion and deconstruction of the genre. The Prophecy of Lightbringer, a red herring for fans to interpret as a sword, might as well be a man. If it is a man, it's the best man in Westeros: Davos.

The fight against the others is approaching. Jon Snow already possesses a sword of Valyrian Steel, a sword capable of killing the Others. However, what Jon doesn't have is the wisdom. Tywin Lannister, in his infinite wisdom, once said, ""[a] wise young king listens to his counselors and heeds their advice until he comes of age. And the wisest kings continue to listen to them long afterwards."" Davos is one of the only people who has their head on straight in Westeros, and with Jon under his tutelage, he will be able to stop the next Long Winter, stop the darkness.

Me: Tywin, Cersei, Joff


How it would change the story:

The Freys never would have had the Red Wedding without Tywin's backing. With Tommen as king and no Cersei, Kevan Lannister would be the reigning power, but there would probably be many people ready to jump from the royal ship since the crown would look so weak, and people trying to weasel into power through a weak crown as well. The battle of the blackwater would have started the same, though without Tywin's forces and the Tyrells coming in as reserve, Stannis would probably have eventually breached the gates. After losing Tywin, Kevan/Tommen may have recalled his forces to King's Landing, which may save the city from Stannis, but allowing Robb to march far south. More likely they would have tried to fight the northern host, and lost without a trustworthy commander. 

A big question I've wondered is, would Stannis really fight Robb? Robb would want to make peace, as he had no quarrel with Stannis, but Stannis is uncompromising and calls Robb a usurper. Stannis would likely hold Sansa captive, and Robb might be willing to relinquish his crown to get her back, though after all his men have been through they might not accept it. They could retreat back north, and wait for stannis to come, or, Stannis's forces were greatly depleted by the battle of the blackwater, so he could march on King's landing, but his chances would be bleak without ships.

Anyway, Cersei's death is the one I'm looking forward to the most right now.",36,10,False,spoiler,,,,,

On the show, at least, Varys seems to be genuine in his desire to help the realm. He saw Robert Baratheon as a disaster who left a crippling war in his wake and that's why he is looking for a wise and just ruler with the right family name and a powerful army. It seems clear that he genuinely believes that with Tyrion and himself serving her, Dany would end up being one of the best monarchs Westeros has ever seen. So far so good? 


But then why, in season 1, was he trying to put Viserys on the throne? It makes sense for him to safeguard the Targaryen heirs as a contingency plan, but he was ready to put that plan in motion back in S1. 5 minutes with Viserys should've made it clear that he was poised to be Mad King 2.0. The realm was still united behind Robert at the point, so putting Viserys on the throne would've required a long and costly war. And he was inviting the Dothraki over who wouldn't have left without their due. Which means a lot of raping, pillaging and enslaving of Westeros had Varys' plan come to fruition. Dany was still a scared little girl getting plowed by Drogo at the time - so there was no way to know that she'd become the monarch he wanted. 


All of this points to a huge short term loss with no long term gains. Leaving  Robert on the throne - or even Joffrey under Tywin's control afterwards - would've been better than his plan. I can't fathom why someone truly concerned about the realm would do such a thing. Am I missing something or is there more to Varys' motivations than the apparent?",74,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

This would be pure speculation, based on a hypothetical. 

By season 3, Tywin didn't have many active enemies left. Renly was gone, Stannis was more or less neutralized, Doran wasn't doing anything, Daanerys was in distant future, Balon was irrelevant and the Tyrells had joined him. The biggest problem left for him to deal with was Robb Stark and since the Red Wedding was already in motion, Tywin just had to sit back and watch it all unfold.


But what if Robb hadn't had the run of bad luck that he did? Let's say he didn't end up making some of the other mistakes and some of the other events turned in his favor. Roose Bolton decides that betraying his liege would be too big a risk - so he chooses to stay loyal. Karstarks don't move against his wishes and stay loyal. The Freys are still pissed off, but breaking the Guest Right never occurs to them. So they settle for a pound of flesh - maybe another marriage proposal once Sansa is free of Joffrey, tax cuts, lion's share of loot of war etc. Back in the North, Bran goes beyond the Wall, but Rickon shows up at the Umbers who, still being loyal, send Robb the good news. And since Bolton betrayal isn't happening, Ramsay's actions are covered up and everyone pretends that Ironborn burned Winterfell - but now, Stark loyalists have it back. After Jamie's return, the Lannisters keep their promise and return Sansa. Arya shows up on her own (i.e. with the Hound, who is paid and probably ends up getting a place there). 


Robb Stark's position is much stronger in this case, but Tywin still has the advantage. He had the Tyrells backing him now. Robb still has to deal with the Ironborn in the North. And though he still has a plan for Casterly Rock, its not an easy thing to accomplish. However, Tywin has learned and acknowledged that Robb can still be hard to deal with despite the disadvantage. He also understands that Robb is backed into a corner - he can't surrender and lose face without having anything to show for it. If things stay the same, Robb would have to fight to the bitter end. 

So, here are the questions:

1) Does Tywin keep fighting fully intent on destroying Robb? Does he do that despite the huge military and monetary cost? Or does he make the pragmatic choice and offer terms of peace - ones that would be acceptable to Robb (i.e. allow him to bend the knee while saving face)?

2) What peace terms would be acceptable to Robb in this case? Clearly he cannot accept complete Northern Freedom or Joffrey's head on a spike - but short of that, what can Tywin offer that wold allow him to save face? To say to his Vassals ""We fought well and we have something to show for it. I want no more death and I want you all to go home and live peacefully"" - and for his Vassals to believe him?

3) Does Joffery's eventual death at the wedding change the equation? Would anything change in the peace terms or would the existing terms become more acceptable to Robb?

Edit: 
Addendum to 3) How would other projected events change the peace terms? Events like Robb succeeding in taking Casterly Rock or Sansa getting home?

4) One of the common features of of peace treaties would be one side giving hostages. Since Tywin has the advantage and Robb is expected to surrender, its likely that Tywin would ask for hostages against future betrayals. But given what Sansa went through, Robb wouldn't want to put any other member of his family through that. Do you think this impasse could be resolved? If yes, then how? ",9,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

It's been a long time coming and would be one of the most tear jerking moments in all of television. Looks pretty on paper, doesn't it?

Here's the problem. What happens to Arya after she reunites with her family? You don't actually think that Jon, let alone Sansa, would allow her to keep fighting or do anything even REMOTELY dangerous, do you?

No, Arya would be sidelined by her older siblings to protect her from more danger. Of course, they may not be able to stop her from trying to help, which brings up another issue.

What in seven hells can Arya possibly accomplish in a full fledged battle? I'm not questioning her ability to kill. I'm simply putting out there that all of Arya's fighting skills are those of a covert assassin (as they should be). The last place you would ever want an assassin to be would be on a battlefield. There's no place to hide safely when you're surrounded by thousands of enemies.


That's why I'm putting my own theory out there. **Arya will have the opportunity to reveal herself to her family, but will reluctantly decide to remain in the shadows.** She will realize that, for now, she can help her brother and sister far more by stealthily killing important people that are enemies of her family. Think about it. It fits perfectly. I can actually see the scene playing out in my head.

*Arya looks at her brother Jon/sister Sansa with genuine happiness. Then, just as she is about to approach them, a different character talks about how many enemies they have and how little information they have. She hears how they're running out of time before the true war begins. Arya then decides, with tears in her eyes, to retreat further into the woods, knowing what she has to do. Goodbye Brother plays in the background.*",68,42,False,spoiler,,,,,

**Tywin Lannister**

Tywin is presented as a pragmatic villain - but is he really that pragmatic? He claims that he is doing things in the interest of his House, but is that always the case? And this isn't about his irrational hatred of Tyrion - let's put that aside for the moment. 

In the Reyne and Tarbeck rebellionhe mercilessly obliterated the two houses. And not just the heads, he killed women, children, servants - everyone. Sure, he cemented his position and anyone thinking of rebelling against him would think twice from now on - but he also cemented his reputation as a cruel and merciless man. A reputation that wasn't helped when he killed the Targaryen children. This pretty much ensured that anyone facing him in war would never surrender - because they know they can never expect any mercy from him. 

And then there is invading the Riverlands in response to Tyrion's abduction. All in the name of preserving family prestige, right? Except, doesn't war sound like a real overreaction? And let's not forget that at that point, all the houses were united under Robert Baratheon. As far as he knew, he'd might end up facing the Tullys, Starks, Arryns and most likely Baratheons. That sounds like some unnecessary escalation to me. Was it really the pragmatic thing to do? Tywin got really lucky that Robert died when he did. 


**Jamie Lannister**

Why didn't Robert fire him after the rebellion? 

Yes, I know Kingsguard serve for life and there is no precedent for dismissing one. But there is no precedent for a KG stabbing his king in the back either. Well, that's not exactly true - one of the KG in the past did sleep around was gelded and sent to the Wall as punishment for breaking his vows. So there is precedent for dismissing a KG. 

So why not dismiss Jamie and let him return to Casterly Rock? Tywin would've certainly welcomed this move. Also, dismissal from such a high position would be seen as punishment and dishonor. Ned Stark, who wanted Jamie punished, would've been mollified a little. And most importantly, as a new king, you want to send a message that regicide is never acceptable. Ofcourse, execution or wall would've been the ""proper"" punishment, but Robert couldn't do that without alienating Tywin. But dismissal seems like a win-win-win move. Did no one think of this? 


**Cersei Lannister**

So, Tywin considers Cersei a disappointment because she got to be the Queen because of the family name, but she didn't do anything with the title. She didn't further the family interest in any way. But what exactly was she supposed to do with her position? 

She got 2 of the small council members to be loyal to her - Littlefinger and Pycelle. Atleast, that's what it looks like on the surface. She put Lannister loyalists in significant positions - like having Lancel as king's squire and who knows who else. She got the Crown to borrow heavily from her father. So what more did Tywin expect her to do? ",23,7,False,spoiler,,,,,

While I think the show has to reveal it to Jon somehow, and LF typically has that kind of knowledge, how would he know?

If LF has known for years before Jon returns from the Wall, why is he just revealing this now? Would this not have helped in manipulating Ned in KL years before without using his ""treason"" instead? If Robert or anyone in the royal family knew Ned had lied and was harboring a Targaryen child, especially Rhaegar's, that would be grounds for execution or at least the loss of Winterfell. LF could have used that to his advantage.

On the other hand, if LF didn't know before Ned died, who told him? There are a very small number of people that know the truth (Bran, anyone at the Tower of Joy including Howland Reed). Even then, say LF visited Reed, why would he tell him? I doubt a handmaiden at the tower knew the situation and what happened to the baby so Reed and Bran are likely the only two who know the connection.

Even then--does Bran know? The show was unclear about what he heard and saw. Likely that he did, but that wasn't explicit.

Lastly, I think Jon needs to find out somehow. Say Bran doesn't know--who tells him? Maybe a visiting Howland Reed at Winterfell? Does perhaps Benjen know?

Now obviously there's been a running theory on who is actually the remaining Targaryens - Dany and Jon both being confirmed now. That just leaves the third (the dragon has three heads) with the most popular choice being Tyrion - the theory being he is the Mad King's son and not Tywin's.

I've always sort of thought this to be true, especially after Tyrion's interaction with the dragons in Mereen, however never really found much evidence from the show to support it. I'm currently rewatching all the seasons in prep for July and just came across an interesting exchange between Tywin and Tyrion in S03E10.

When arguing about Tywin's intentions in what he does Tyrion questions when he has ever done something solely for the benefit of the Lannisters. To which Tywin replies ""The day that you were born. I wanted to carry you into the sea and let the waves wash you away. Instead I let you live and I've brought you up as my son... because you're a Lannister.""

I may just be reading too much into this but it was Tywin's pause after saying he brought him up as his son that got me thinking. At first I just assumed it was another dig at Tyrion being a dwarf but it's almost as if there's another reason behind it which Tywin isn't saying; like perhaps he never fathered him? And he only threw the Lannister line in there because his mother was a Lannister at that time. 

Again, I may just be overthinking it but do any of you think this may add some credibility to the theory? Or just another throwaway line?",15,11,False,spoiler,,,,,

Season 6 on the whole was a massive improvement on the lacklustre season 5 but to this day one thing irks me about episode 9 -  Ramsey's fate. Jon Snow is a Stark. He is the Starkiest Stark who ever Starked and is basically his ""father"" with a wolf. Ramsey was evil, he had to die and Jon should've been the one to do it.

""He who passes the sentence should swing the sword"".

Ramsey was Jon's prisoner. He was right not to beat him to death on the spot (although that would've been satisfying to watch). Ned Stark believed that only if you can look the man in the eye and here his last words did he deserve to die. I believe it would've been more fitting with Jon's character for him to kill Ramsey personally, rather than giving Sansa her revenge in what can only be described as a brutal manner. Did the writers choose shock value and fan service over writing to fit the characters here? 

Since the first time I saw that episode it bugged me, but the more I've thought about it the more wrong it feels.

So today i wanted to ask what is your least Favorite fan theory what are the ones that just make you angry or mad or just wonder why they even bothered. Here are some of mine:

- Varys Merman theory (Now to be honest this one my have some evidence to it even if it is alittle bit crazy but everytime i read it i still perform a face palm. Like if this was your typical fairy tale story that's one thing but this is not this Game of Thrones is a realistic story still has fantasy but more grounded so Varys being a Merman who wants to have the Merling's take over the world does not make sense not to mention it DOES NOT WORK with Varys's arc.)

- Ned is still alive (If Ned is still alive not only would that Cheapen the story but also it would make his death pointless as his death had a huge impact to the world of ice and fire (mainly Westeros) so if he is still alive it would make it pointless. Also if he was he would not just stay quiet while his family was being slaughter)

- HS=HR (okay so i am cheated alittle as this was debunked int he show and while i think it WILL be debunked in the books it has not yet so i can still talk smack about it. So you are saying ""Well it will be in the books because the books and shows are different now) two things 1. They are still going to the same endgame just different paths but also same story beats 2. Why would George confirm HS=HR like i am suppose to believe that Howland Reed with all this stuff going on in the north decided to go to the riverlands travel around there on foot faking his own religion creating basically a cult just to take down the Lannisters so he can take the throne and reveal Jon's parentage. HOW DOES THAT MAKE ANY SENSE)

- Jon and Dany hook up and marry (Do i even need to say why it is bad. It's dumb, it makes no sense for the story, it makes zero sense for the characters arc, and it comes off as wish fulfillment)

- Jon vs Daenerys (now this one is more tolerable then the latter but still dumb. Basically it goes that Jon will control the others and Dany goes mad. No Just no)

- D+D=T (Tyrion the time travelling son of Dany and Drogo. Need i say more)

- Mance = Rhaegar (yes there is some evidence but 1. i think the fact that he is dead in the show is a sign that he is not Rhaegar and/or will die in the books but differently 2. also i think it would be a copout)

- Jon and Arya hook up and marry and/or run off like Lyanna and Rhaegar before them (so this started when it was revealed in the original draft they where suppose to fall in love. Now hear this i think GRRM made a wise choice when he changed this. Not only would it also make no sense for the story and the characters arcs but it also comes off as wish fulfillment, It would make Jon a Pedo as he is older then her, and Gendry is the better fit for Arya if she lives in the end and even if she decides to settle down)

There are others but these are the top ones i dislike. What are your least Fav fan theories. I may do another post on my most Fav soon. ",75,27,False,spoiler,,,,,

What if Daenerys is still in the House of the Undying?


I am a TV only pleb, only reading the 1st Half of the 1st book, so if they show more visions and area's in the House of the Undying, or there is an explanation to my question in the books, lemme know.
But what if? I mean in the show we see her walking beyond the wall, walking in what I assume is a throne to come or has been, we also see her with Khal Drogo and her son, so is it a big of a far stretch to say that all of what happened to her from S3 -&gt; is just an illusion by Pyat Pee, I mean we see him kill the other members of Qarth when he created illusions of himself, we saw him chain Daenerys with two other versions of himself, how crazy is it to say that he created the Illusion that Daenerys dragons killed him so she would no longer think she is bound to the house of the Undying and what if (to put it in Rick and Morty terms) She is on a treadmill, the world is dissapering behind her and being made infront of her


I know its probably really dumb because Tyrion and Varys have both met Danerys after the House of the Undying and they were in the story before she visited the House of Undying so if it were true they can't of been an illusion made by Pyat Pee, but its just a thought was re-watchign S2 and thought came into head",6,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

That is, not whether they are true, but whether you want them to be true. 

**Remember, this *isn't* about evidence supporting those theories. This is about not wanting them to be true because they don't fit the narrative logic or the character development we've seen so far. Any evidence about canonical events indicating the truth of a particular theory are completely irrelevant.**

For me, here are a couple of theories - relating to books and the show - that I don't want to be true. I realize that the writer(s) can make it come true anyway and make up facts supporting it along the way, but I'd much rather that did not happen because, IMO, it'd take something away from the overall story. 


A) Jon Snow is the legitimate son of R+L - Jon's entire character arc is rooted in him being a bastard. Specifically, Ned's bastard. If it turns out that he was a legitimate heir all along and people just throw their support behind him the moment that happens - then his entire character growth would count for little. The great thing about Jon is that he doesn't fight because of some destiny or prophecy, he does because he chooses to. Because he has something to prove. But if the theory turns out to be true, he never had anything to prove at all and all his character development didn't mean much. 


B) A+J = T - Tyrion's complicated relationship with his father is also a major motivation for him. Its not like giving Tywin extra justification to hate Tyrion would change anything. Tyrion being Tywin's son at the core - being so similar to him and yet so different - that is a big appeal for the character. Its a great juxtaposition of characters and it works *because* Tywin is Tyrion's father. Taking that away from Tyrion's character would be a bad idea. 


C) Bronn is a secret Reyne - Unlike the other two, Bronn's character is great because of his simplicity. He wants money and a comfortable life. His skills lie in killing, so that's what he uses to get what he wants. He doesn't have any secret agendas or master plans - he is not interested in gaining power or influence or ruling or revenge. He is a simple man with simple needs who just isn't interested in all the political games. Why ruin a great character like that with unnecessary complications? 


D) Ice Dragons - Despite their hype, dragons aren't the be all and end all when it comes to military power. Even Aegon deployed his dragons sparingly. In his conquest, he used them twice - once on Harrenhal and once on the Field of Fire. He primarily relied on soldiers to get the job done. And even with dragons, he wasn't able to conquer Dorne. This realistic aspect is established pretty well in the show and the books - dragons are a great asset to have, but they are not everything. So, instead of turning the final battle into a dragon vs dragon fight, it'd be a lot more interesting to figure out a different way to use them. Ice dragons coming out of Winterfell or the Wall does not serve the narrative logic well. 


E) Arya reuniting with her family - A lot of her character development has been about becoming colder and harder and learning the skills for revenge. To simply forgo that in favor of a heartfelt family reunion would not do her character justice. If that is to happen, I'd rather it happen after her list is done. 


F) XYZ is Azor Ahai/PtwP/Valonqar - Right now, in the threads, it seems like everyone and their mother somehow qualifies for one of the prophecies. Or in some cases - all of them. Its a very common fantasy trope - ""Oh look, here's a prophecy twist whereby this is the salt and smoke, this is the prophesied sword and this is the little sibling"". But subverting common fantasy tropes is a big part of this particular work of fiction. Playing the prophecy straight like all the other works of fiction would be a disservice to the narrative, IMO. 


Do you agree? Disagree? Why or why not? And what are some of the other theories you would like to see discarded because they don't fit the narrative?

Clearly Varys doesn't know everything and there are a lot of LF moves he wouldn't know about - killing Jon, Lysa's letter, lie about the dagger, Ned's betrayal, convincing Joffrey to kill Ned, the dwarf show, etc. But Varys does know that LF is a dangerous man and he should be keeping an eye on him. And Varys has the most extensive spy network in the whole country, which should include Vale. 

Now LF shows up in Vale with a young woman in tow who he claims as his bastard daughter. Surely Varys would've heard of this. This young woman, however, matched the description of the recently absconded Sansa Stark. Furthermore, Varys knows that LF had tried sneaking her out of KL once before. To confirm that the girl is Sansa would not be a big leap. And if he has any doubts, he can investigate more to confirm. 

Since Sansa disappeared right as Joffrey was murdered, its not a leap to figure out that whoever took her knew that the murder was about to happen. Which means LF was probably involved with the murder itself. 

It seems in-character for Varys to both have this information and get to that conclusion. So, do you think he got there or was he as clueless about Sansa's location as everybody else? And if he knew, why do you think he didn't use the information to take down LF? Yes, Cersei was convinced that Tyrion was responsible, but it shouldn't be stretch to sell that he had an accomplice. Was not getting Sansa in trouble a factor here? Or if he was saving it for future use, where and when do you think he'd have used this information?",5,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

In season 2 at Harrenhal, she had Ilyn Payne on the list, but missed out on Meryn Trant. In season 4 she added Beric, Thoros, Mel and Tywin to the list, but dropped them all inexplicably in season 5 (she shouldn't have known that Tywin was dead yet). Season 5 also saw the return of Meryn Trant to the list but removed Ilyn Payne. Arya also alternates between ""The Freys"" and ""Walder Frey"". She does end up killing Black Walder and Lame Lothar, despite neither being on her list explicitly. Does that mean she killed the rest of the Freys as well? 

Basically, now there seem to be only 2 names left on Arya's list - Cersei and The Mountain. But given the shows tendency to be inconsistent here, do you think they'd just pad her list and give her a few other names? And pretend that they were already there?

&amp;nbsp;

This just occurred to me this morning after I had my coffee (and I guess this has occurred to many others), but I hope you could share some information and not maybe DESTROY, but prove my theory wrong, since this just felt too right and I can't see why not this couldn't be happening in the world of GoT.

&amp;nbsp;

*Start by ditching the idea that Jon is the Prince that was Promised. Although he has been ""prince in the shadows"", like Aragorn in LOTR and now that that Jon is one of the Targaryen's and we have all the theory backing up that he could be the prince too.*

&amp;nbsp;

So,
We have seen glimpses of the spiral made of stones and/or bodies (left behind by NK) many times in the series. The newest sight being in the trailer and in the eye of the Night King. We know that the Night King was ""born"" strapped into a tree surrounded by a spiral of stones and Bran gets visions of the tree all the time throughout the series. 

&amp;nbsp;

[The Spiral](http://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2016/05/23045728/spirals.jpg) (IMAGE)

&amp;nbsp;

When Bran finally reaches the 3ER and talks to him, the 3ER tells him ""You will not walk again, but you will fly"". I always thought  ""oh, Bran's gonna warg into a dragon or something, that's cool"", but somehow it seemed too obvious after a while. So I was thinking maybe he will learn how to fly through **TIME**. Like he has done with Hodor in the past and with his father. I only point out these events, because these are the times when he actually ""interacted"" with another characters. His father heard him and Hodor.... well Hodor went Hodor. :(

&amp;nbsp;

[Young Hodor](http://img.wennermedia.com/article-leads-horizontal/rs-242971-hodor.jpg) (IMAGE)

&amp;nbsp;

So, let's say he learns how to move through time and will keep doing that in these future seasons. We might get to see how the voices inside the Mad King's head arent't actually ""voices"" but Bran yelling stuff. Dany is hearing voices too throughout the books, so it might be Bran too(?). 

&amp;nbsp;

[The Mad King](http://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/the-mad-king-game-of-thrones.jpg) (IMAGE)

&amp;nbsp;

Here comes the point of the whole ""set-up"" for this theory. Bran doesn't understand that the ink has already dried. With little to no education from the 3ER his ego or something just wants to save everybody, but it's too late to try and affect the past and what he is actually doing is just interfering. With horrible results as we've seen already (Hodor, Mad King). We just think it's a part of a crazy history of Westeros, but things could've/might've been different all along. So Bran just goes on and on and tries to help everyone and everything with his newly harnessed powers and actually goes back in time so much that he somehow ends up to be in the situation where the Night King is somehow conjured/created/magically be drawn out of a hat like a rabbit and turns out that it's **actually Bran**. Don't lose me yet, read to the end and I'll try to explain why.

&amp;nbsp;

[Night King with Bran](https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/a/aa/Night_king_the_door_with_bran.jpg) (IMAGE)

&amp;nbsp;

This would explain to me why Night King is the **ONLY** person who can actually **SEE** Bran during the time jumps (not your ordinary LSD trip). He is just looking at himself. And we know NK has some kickass powers in his arsenal. This could maybe explain how and why the Night King looks at Jon with so keen eye during the fights at Hardhome. Yeah I know he might be just in awe how Jon actually defended himself against one of NK's Lieutenants with his sword and we thought that it just means that the Night King is ""scared"" of Jon. Maybe he's just looking at his brother, deep inside hoping him to survive the fight? I don't know, maybe too far-fetched. Here we all maybe got the idea that ""ok.. Jon got resurrected, he is fighting White Walkers with his sword, he's gotta be the Prince that was Promised.""

&amp;nbsp;

[White Walker fighting Jon](http://images.buddytv.com/articles/White_Walker_Jon_S_3325482b.jpg) (IMAGE)

&amp;nbsp;

So the Night King is on a mission now. Just coming south all the time. But somehow I can't help but to notice that the series has shown nothing but Night King going after Bran all the time. To the 3ER's cave first. In S7 we know that Bran will go to the Wall and we know that the NK will attack the Wall too (maybe bring it down with an undead dragon). Maybe just to get through, to follow Bran and end the spell/curse somehow? Killing Bran or connecting with him somehow? This is still a blur at least to me how it will happen or is that the true idea. All the men who stand in his way are just pawns and they don't matter to the actual storyline at all.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;**Just to end, just imagine this idea:**

&amp;nbsp;1. We need the Prince that was Promised

&amp;nbsp;2. Maybe Bran was in the early legend the PRINCE that was Promised to **BE SACRIFICED** for the greater good (or so the Children of the Forest thought).

&amp;nbsp;3. Everything went haywire and Bran's sacrifice or courage or something that he did (again as a interference to the things that should've happened how they should've) created Night King

&amp;nbsp;4. Night King now wants to have a revenge on the Children of the Forest and get Bran to end the curse that is currently upon him. Just to be free.


&amp;nbsp;

And so the Prince that was Promised turned to a King. Just like Prince's become Kings. Not in your ordinary way, but in a way still. This feels (if you think about the writers/producers of the show) something that could be surprising to the majority of the watchers/readers, it would feel something that could happen in GoT universe, would answer so many questions and riddles that have been sprinkled throughout the show.
 
&amp;nbsp;

I actually cursed when I realized this idea; because if this is true - I just spoiled everything to myself. So please, blast me with alternative facts (no pun intended) and/or better theories so I could be wrong. Or if you think this could be true, pat me in the back and tell me to move on and try to enjoy the series anyways. This is exactly what happens when TV Series gives you too much time to think about everything without bringing you new episodes. I hate myself for overthinking. 

&amp;nbsp;

No matter how everything goes, I'm (or we, if you count us others from our band too) still super excited! A little over a month to go anymore :)

And the reveal makes sense for the story by tying together themes like prophesy and fate. And it'd have been pretty disappointing all around had they just glossed over or ignored this mystery. It was a big setup with a big payoff. 

But is there any payoff to Jon Snow finding out? Would the story be better served with people knowing about this? 

1.Jon Snow - His story was about proving himself despite being a bastard and with being declared the King in the North, he has done that. And he's always been more Stark than Targaryen. Even if he finds out, he wouldn't suddenly go after the Iron Throne. And he is plenty motivated to fight the WW already - don't think this knowledge would add anything to that. So I can't see any advantage to him finding out - it'd only create more conflict and angst for him. 


2. The Family - Catelyn and Sansa were the only ones who had a problem with Jon being a bastard. Catelyn's dead now and Sansa seems to have gotten over it. And if she still resents Jon for cutting the line, finding out that he is her father's younger sister's son instead of her half-brother isn't going to change that. Bran and Arya never had a problem with Jon to begin with, so it won't change how they feel. Other than Bran's future choices in his role as 3ER, I don't see the point of their knowing either. 


3. The Northern Houses - These guys have already declared for Jon despite believing him to be a bastard. Knowing the truth wouldn't change anything there either. 


4. Dany's Camp - I don't see the truth changing things much here either. Dany and Jon don't have that much of a conflict to begin with - she wants the Iron Throne, he wants to fight the WW. Pretty sure they can reach a compromise without knowing about Jon. Where the issue of Northern Independence is concerned, I don't see this making a difference. If Dany isn't willing to fracture Westeros, then finding out Jon is her nephew wouldn't change the equation. And it'd only create unnecessary conflict in regards to the issue of Dany's legitimacy. Jon being a bastard might've in a political marriage, but since Jon has already been declared King despite that and Dany's own court has a few bastards in positions of power, I don't see that being a issue. Also, Dany and Jon knowingly restarting the practice of incest seems a little but too icky.


5. Southern Lords - I don't see them changing their minds about Jon because of Targ blood. If they are looking out just for themselves, I'd expect them to fight Jon all along the way - question the truth of this outrageous claim no matter what evidence is provided, claim that he remains a bastard regardless, claim that he broke his vows as the LC etc. But if they want to support Jon because of what he is doing or what he has done, his heritage won't matter. 


6. Prophecy - Sure knowing the truth about Jon might make it easier to point to him as the prophesied savior and therefore the one who should be leading. But the Red Priests are the only ones who actually care about the prophecy. Other people who have heard of it either don't believe or don't care. 


The only point where I see this doing any good would be if Dany dies, the truth can be used to avoid another war for succession. And it might play into explaining why Jon can ride a dragon. But apart from that, the story might play out better with the secret never being revealed at all. 

Thoughts? Are there any major advantages to letting people know the truth here?",119,53,False,spoiler,,,,,

. 
Just opposite to that scene, the very last scene of the same season(just before the scene where Arya sails off to Bravoos),the same man died in the most disgusting way possible,in the toilet by the hands of his own son, and ironically the song ' The Rains of Castamere ' instrumental version was played again , the song which previously signified the glory of the Lannister now signified the cracks on their house which would further 'weaken' it.

We see throughout the trailer all the important characters of Season 7. We see Jon ruling not only in the North but also Beyond the Wall, meaning he's going to be a huge character this season. We see Cersei as she prepares to fight against Danny and all of her enemies, and we see Jaime possibly supporting her in this war (pray for valonquar prophecy). We see Danny a ton ruling at Dragonstone preparing for her war for Westeros. We see Davos telling people that if they don't get over their shit whoever sits on the Iron Throne in the end will be a skeleton forcing them to focus on the White Walkers. We see Arya going North stirring up trouble, and Little Finger trying to turn Sansa against Jon. We only see Tyrion once, and that's as he watches the three dragons rise above the cliffs of Dragonstone. What's interesting is as he is shown Cersei says the line

&gt;We're the last of the Lannisters. The ones who matter.

And maybe she's right. Yes, Tyrion is Dannys hand and will give her advice in the war but I don't see him actually doing anything very substantial. Do you think it's possible he might be the huge death of the season as we saw nothing of him in the trailer?

In the season 7 trailer it looks like the unsullied are attacking Casterly Rock this made me think that  perhaps as part of this Edmure Tully is freed and then aligns himself with the Targaryen forces and possibly gets back control of the river lands. Especially as the Freys will be in a bit of a mess and a lot of people dislike them. I guess it would only be a small side plot but it would be nice for Edmure to reclaim his home.

&gt; I wrapped up just before Christmas, and then they did some CG component work and some green screen work in the new year. Season 7 is going to be fantastic. **We did a showstopping, pretty epic scene in Europe** just before I came back, and its really going to be great. I dont know the facts and figures, but they only did seven episodes this year, but I think their budgets probably the same, so I think youre going to see  **whereas before, wed have one or two showstopping, major episodes per season, this season, probably at least half of them are whoppers.** Theyre not going to disappoint.

Literally everyone from actors to writers to producers are hyping the hell out of S7, but I don't think they're overselling. [The trailer](http://imgur.com/i4iM91M) looks wicked in this regard so that's a great start. Their extra per-episode budget and the extra time they took this year will definitely pay off.

S8 airing in late 2018/early 2019 doesn't bother me so much. I'm having serious withdrawals now waiting for S7 and I don't look forward to waiting 17-18 months for S8, but I'm also dreading the show coming to an end. Alas it's gonna end sooner or later and I'd much rather it going out with a bang than with a whimper. Imagine what they can do to six episodes with a 10-episode budget and about 1.5 years of intensive work. 

**TLDR: The scenery (among many other things) in S7 will kick ass; the writers are favoring quality over quantity so episode length probably won't matter so much; delaying S8 may be for the best.**",15,35,False,spoiler,,,,,

But Rast brought up a valid point: why not just kill Ghost? What purpose does he serve for their group? By continuing to keep him alive and feed him they waste valuable food. 

And what were they planning for the long run? Later on in the scene he states that he doesn't need another mouth to feed (referring to the newborn baby that he tells Rast to leave in the woods on his way to feed to Ghost). Would they wait for Mance to catch them and make common cause with the King Beyond the Wall? Would they offer Ghost to him as a pet? I'm also wondering how they even managed to trap Ghost in the first place.

GoT Academy, a YouTube channel of two actual historians who are fans of the show hit the nail on the head, imo.

They said that Azor Ahai is essentially not any one person but a collective effort by individuals and society as a whole to beat back the darkness.

Lightbringer is not a literal sword.

It's a metaphor for a new era.

It does not yield light physically, but it brings en-light-enment.

This doesn't even mean the ending of ASOIAF will have man moving towards progress, though...

It just means that's what is needed to do so.

The ending will be bittersweet. It's going to involve sacrifice.

In the original AA story, he cannot wield LB without driving it into the heart of his love, Nissa Nissa.

Nissa Nissa is a metaphor for the cost of war that is a repercussion of violence.

George RR Martin is vehemently anti-war. Although, perhaps he is hinting their will be a glimmer of hope. A Dream of Spring so to speak.

Not that man's future is bright, but that, even when winter subsides, there's a chance to start over. An opportunity for a new flower to blossom.

At the end of the day, this is a fantasy story, with magic and dragons, etc.

It's possible someone in the show/books will play the role of Nissa Nissa, and, if that's the case, I think Daenerys and Arya are the two strongest candidates for that (maybe Jon Snow?).

But yeah.....I just thought that was super fucking deeep.

Or at the very least, have both of those Valyrian swords back in Stark household. 

Valyrian swords are big legacy objects in Westeros. Tywin had wanted one for ages but people would sooner sell their daughters. And even though the Lannisters had Ice since season 1, they didn't melt it down because they thought they might have to trade it back to the Starks one day. It was only after House Stark was thought to be destroyed that Tywin reforged it. 

Tywin's legacy is already falling apart big time and I do want to see it completely undone. He was so happy at getting 2 Valyrian swords for his family that I want them both lost to the Lannisters so that even that part of his legacy is gone. It would be fitting if the only shred of his legacy left is carried on by Tyrion - the person he hated and despised and who killed him. I can imagine him rolling in his grave at this turn of events and the thought pleases me.

Which means, even if he is outmaneuvered or killed, he'd never actually have to answer for them. 

Here are his moves (and possible moves) in chronological order. Which ones do you think he'd have to face before he is done?

1. Lying about Lyanna - Purely speculative one here with no evidence whatsoever. But there is a theory floating around that he witnessed Lyanna and Rhaegar eloping, but chose to tell Brandon that this was a kidnapping and kicked everything off. But even if this is true, the only one to know it would be Brandon and he is long dead. 

2. Bankrupting the Realm - Yes, Robert was the big spender, but LF made it seem like they had a lot of money. It isn't really a secret that LF borrowed heavily, but I doubt people realize the intention behind it - that he wanted to destabilize the realm. You think this would be brought up anytime in future? Maybe if he wants to be the Master of Coin for the North?

3. Killing Jon Arryn - Another huge move that set off the story to begin with. Lysa was the only one who knew and she's dead. Interestingly, he was behind the death of both of Robin's parents and yet Robin trusts him the most. He might end up losing that if and when the truth comes out. 

4. Lying about the Dagger - Cat, Ned and Varys knew about this one and 2 of them are dead. And Varys doesn't seem like the type to share information. Tyrion was the one most affected by this lie and he has been ""friends"" with Varys this whole time. Varys could've revealed it at any time to undermine LF but chose not to. And I can't recall if Cat ever told Tyrion where she got the information. It may not be seem as important on its own, but its another piece of evidence that shows LF to be the grand architect of the War. 

5. Betraying Ned - It seems to be common knowledge that LF and the City Watch sided with the Lannisters in that confrontation. But LF could easily justify that he was doing his duty - that Ned had just stupidly assumed that City Watch would follow his orders. Not only that his duty was to follow the king, but he'd had no influence on the City Watch to begin with - they followed Slynt. But would anyone know that he had promised Ned otherwise? Ned knew and Cat knew - but I doubt they told anyone. Janos Slynt would know as well and possibly Pycelle, but they are dead as well. The only ones alive who would possibly know would be Varys and Cersei and I doubt they'd bring it up. 

6. Convincing Joffrey to kill Ned - Based on the fact that he was smiling, instead of rushing to Joff's side to stop him or looking shocked, it seems likely that he convinced Joffrey to go rogue and order Ned's execution. It wouldn't have taken much to manipulate him - just a few well-chosen words about how it'd make him look like a strong leader and not a mama's boy.  But Joffrey would be the only one to know and he's dead as well - so that's unlikely to come up again either. 

7. Screwing up Sansa's betrothal - Obviously, if he hadn't spilled the beans about the possible Loras-Sansa marriage, Tywin wouldn't have forestalled it by marrying him to Tyrion. Despite the fact that Tyrion had been kind to her, it was a pretty big blow to her. I doubt Sansa would take kindly to knowing that he'd been screwing with her for such a long time. But I'm guessing only Cersei knows about this one. 

8. Joffrey's Murder/Sansa's Escape/Tyrion's Framing - This was the riskiest and the most open set of moves he ever made and simply too many people know about it. And even if they don't, they stand to easily figure it out and those people are coming together. Tyrion knows that he didn't kill Joff and he smart enough to suspect that whoever took Sansa would've been involved. Theon knows that LF gave Sansa to the Boltons and he is with Tyrion. If they get to talking, Tyrion can easily put 2 and 2 together. Olenna is there as well and she can confirm everything - excusing her part by saying that she never expected Tyrion to take the fall. And he was the one behind the dwarf show so that Tyrion and Joffrey would be publicly at odds making Tyrion the obvious fall guy - but no one would know about that. The only positive is that the only one to care about Joff's murderer would be Cersei and she no longer has the power to reach LF. Tyrion might hold a grudge for the frame-job, but he might just let it go. It'd be ironic if the one ""heroic"" act LF did becomes his downfall. 

9. Killing Lysa - He already faced the court on that one and got off scot-free. Sansa is the only one who can tell on him but she can't do that without implicating herself. I don't see this coming up again either. 

10. Bolton Marriage - I guess this is the one that he has had to answer for. He has already lost Sansa's trust over this and if the Lords of the Vale learn the truth - which they could from Sansa - he might end up losing the Vale over it. 


Are there any other I've missed? Which one(s) do you think he'd have to answer for?

EDIT: Does anyone think we might get to see a complete villainous breakdown from LF at some point? Something like all his plans coming crashing down and him losing it completely and admitting to everything? ""Do you know the things I've done to get here? Do you have a clue?"" - stuff like that? Or would that be too trite? ",69,64,False,spoiler,,,,,

Even though this theory is popular, I know that it has more than it's share of nay-sayers. I happen to be one of those nay-sayers, but I although think that Dany bringing three dragons to the wall should kind of be a really easy win against the white walkers. 

Like, honestly, in my mind the white walker's army of wights for sure can be burnt up in a minute by dragons, right? I mean... we saw them really going at it at the end of season 6, but if the dragons are in the sky and are breathing constant fire on the wights then it's basically over for them. (it might not be over for the white walkers, because we have seen that they can only be killed by dragon glass and valyrian steel, but the wights have been shown to be killed by fire... and while dragon fire is probably different from normal fire in terms of magic stuff, I'm not sure that it will be enough to take down a white walker.)

Without their army of wights, the white walkers would be so much easier to take down (still not an easy task... just easier in general). It would be boring to just have three dragons come in, scorch the battlefield of wights and then have the heroes follow with valyrian swords and dragon glass to kill the white walkers. SO I think that the white walkers need some variation of this ice dragon theory to level the field. 

As much as I'm saying that dragons taking out the wights will be easy, I do still think that it could take awhile I'm not sure IIRC, but I feel like the white walkers can resurrect dead wights? I'm not sure if that's a thing, but I feel like it is (even if it's OP) and so if it is, the white walkers can just have their wights shooting arrow after arrow at these dragons and maybe they'll actually end up killing one. If they can kill on of Dany's dragons, they can resurrect it as a wight dragon that will fight on their team instead.

I'm not sure if this will happen, but I think it would be an interesting spin on the popular ice dragon theory. The point of GoT/ASoIaF is that people get so sucked into the politics and relationships that they forget about the real threat that doesn't care about the politics and relationships. Many people in Westoros regard magic as dead and are ready to believe that it could come back. The focus is on the very real existence of magic in the known world. Despite this, GRRM and the showrunners aren't about to make this series all about wizards shooting lightning bolts out of their asses; the magic is a lot more subtle (for lack of better term). Having an already existing dragon die and be brought back to fight for the other team is (in my opinion) a lot more subtle than just adding a whole new dragon to the mix.

 TL;DR: basically there's no way that there's a fourth dragon living inside the wall as many fans have predicted... if the others are going to have a dragon on their team it's going to be because they killed one of Dany's dragons and bring it back as a dragon wight.

I'm sorry if this post is really scatter brained, I'm pretty lazy about stuff like this. Let me know what you all think! If this does happen, I think that it'll be at the end of S7 &amp; TWoW or even ADoS. ",25,19,False,spoiler,,,,,

Tywin was a big time hypocrite in many areas this is often used as an example of his hypocrisy - that he'd forbid Tyrion from whoring around, but had no problem whoring himself. But was it really an example of hypocrisy? 

In Tywin's backstory, his father had a mistress after his mother's death - a mistress that ended up gaining too much power within the household. People used to make fun of Tytos saying that if you want him to hear you, speak between her legs. She'd flagrantly use Tywin's mother's clothes and jewellery and gained quite a bit of influence and power within the house. Basically the type of stuff that dishonored the proud Lannister name. 

So maybe Tywin's problem isn't with sleeping around with whores but with giving them too much power or position.

Tyrion had already proven himself untrustworthy in that regard - he had sex with one commoner and ended up marrying her the next day. He couldn't be trusted to use sound judgment and keep the whores at a safe distance once he started sleeping with them - so better forbid it altogether. Tywin himself, however, would know how to keep them in their place, so there was no danger in him sleeping around. 


If that's the case, Tywin wasn't being a hypocrite with Shae. Is there anything in the books or the show that contradicts this interpretation? Something that shows that he was contemptuous of whoring in general and not just with Tyrion? Because that would make him a hypocrite.",49,94,False,spoiler,,,,,

I have read recently the meaning of the names of the dire wolfs which probably many of you already know.
 Robb : Grey Wind. The name is symbolic of how meteoric his rise and fall were. 
Sansa : Lady. It's simply what she aspires to be. 
Arya Stark : Nymeria. Named for a warrior Princess who ruled in Dorne. Someone who Arya may aspire to be.
 Bran : named his Direwolf Summer. Could suggest the hope he has against the evil that is coming!
 Rickon : Shaggydog. The literal meaning of ""shaggy -dog"" is a long-drawn-out circumstantial story concerning an inconsequential happening that impresses the teller as humorous or interesting but the hearer as boring and pointless, some argue this is like Rickons role in the show. I also think the name ""Shaggydog"" shows to us that Rickon is still a child and still is innocent despite what is going on. 
Jon Snow- Ghost. The name relates to Jon dying and then being bought back to like. He's a ghost in his own way 

https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4koi1e/everything_each_direwolfs_name_has_a_very/ 

Although these names clearly correspond with the Stark children and represent them we could further look into how else the wolfs represent the Starks.

The dire wolfs represent the lives of the Starks. 
When Greywind dies so does Robb. Greywind is placed inside a kennel so he is trapped just as Robb is trapped inside the hall, where he will be killed. Grey Wind starts to grow restless, having sensed the impending betrayal of the members of House Frey. It's as if Grey Wind could sense what was going to happen. When the men turn on the Starks, Grey Wind is shot several times by Frey crossbowmen. Robb direwolf represented his life, he could sense the betrayal and died alongside Robb. Both Grey Wind and Robb's corpses are decapitated, with Grey Wind's head sewn onto Robb's headless body and paraded atop a horse. 
When Lady dies we could argue that this is when something changed in Sansa as if she lost any loyalty she had to the Starks at that time. For example in King's landing Sansa's enmity towards Arya and her father continues. Eddard tries to regain Sansa's affection by buying her dolls but fails as she argues she hasn't played with dolls for years. Eddard explains to Arya that Sansa could not defy Joffrey if she wished to maintain his goodwill in marriage. Sansa direwolf died as her loyalty to the Starks decreased and to the Lannister's increased
Arya direwolf represents her life as she can successfully runway from the Lannisters. Nymeria was supposed to be killed not Sansa's dirwolf, Lady, however like Arya was able to escape the Capitol, Nymeria was able to escape death caused by the Lannister's. 
Bran's direwolf Summer died in season 6. Summer died by attacking the wights in order to save Brans life. We could argue that Summer (like Hodor) always had the task to help Bran and keep him alive,this can be seen in season 1 when Summer kills the assassin who tries to kill Bran (however this could just be the direwolf being loyal and protective of its master.) Furthermore we could say that Summer had to die as once Bran left the cave he would no longer be Bran Stark he would be the Three Eyed Raven. 
Rickon's direwolf Shaggywolf was decapitated in order to show proof of his identity, the death of the direwolf hinted to us of the death of Rickon. Rickon and his dire wolf faced the same fate as Robb and Grey Wind, death.
Jon Snows direwolf Ghost was known as the runt of the litter, Theon Greyjoy mocks that the wolf is like Snow. (Jon is the bastard son of Eddard Stark and therefore the runt of the family). However after finding out Jon Snows true heritage we could argue that Ghost is not an albino direwolf to show that he is the outsider of the Stark family but to hint to us that Jon Snow is a Targaryen. The Targaryen's have platinum blonde hair just like Jon Snows direwolf.

The link between the direwolfs and their masters I think can be argued in season 2 episode 5: The Ghost of Harrenhal. 
In the conversation between Tywin and Arya she says: ""They call him 'The Young Wolf'... They say he rides into battle on the back of a giant direwolf. They say he can turn into a wolf himself when he wants."" In my opinion I interpret this into showing us that the direwolf represent their masters. Obviously the Starks can't turn into their wolfs however the wolfs act so similarly to their owners that it's as if the direwolfs are the Stark children. I also think this could be a link to Bran, even though Arya is taking about Robb. Bran is a warg and it's able to send his consciousness into the mind of an animal meaning he is able to turn into a wolf when he wants. However this could just be coincidence.",4,10,False,spoiler,,,,,

With Jon the Riverlords weren't there, but some of the Lords and Knights of Vale were. I couldn't make it out exactly, but they joined in with the King in the North chanting. What I do know, however, is that Lord Paramount of the Vale and Warden of the East - Robin Arryn - wasn't there. 


So, is Jon King of the Vale as well now? I'd think that the actual Lord of the Vale should have some say in the matter. His underlings just handed over his kingdom to a complete stranger without even asking. ",57,11,False,spoiler,,,,,

Still, we all have some sort of background (education, job, life experiences, etc.) that makes us pay attention to certain things more than others. As a result, there are inevitably things that may distract us that other people may overlook. 

For example, I studied human anatomy and physiology in college, and so I often notice situations where there is an inconsistency between a given injury and its outcome. Thus, my personal peeve of choice occurs in Season 6 during the Arya training montage that is the Braavos arc. Waif repeatedly whacks Arya in the head with a quarterstaff, which would result in fairly severe injuries, notably, multiple lost teeth, numerous broken bones (facial bones are quite delicate FFS), and almost certainly brain damage from the near-constant concussions. (I won't even get into the gut-stabbing fiasco...that's in another league of ridiculousness entirely. Please feel free to discuss it in the thread, I just won't go into my personal rant here.)

Ser Davos is Azor Ahai and Melisandre is Lightbringer the Red Sword of Heroes. 
 
Davos first attempts to be a hero (forge his sword) when he saves the people of Storms End from siege by smuggling in food via the water, for his actions he must sacrifice the ends of his fingers to the lawful Stannis.
He makes a 2nd attempt to be a hero during the Battle of the Blackwater has he leads Stannis fleet against the Lannister (Lion) held Kings Landing, for his actions he loses his son(s) when the wildfire decimated the fleet. 
He makes a 3rd attempt with a heavy heart obeying his Kings command to ride back to Castle Black despite severe misgivings. His absence brings about the circumstances that allows Melisandre to burn Shireen. 
From this 3rd attempt a weapon of great power is reforged, in burning Shireen Melisandre is bonded with the spirit of Rhilor and reforged into Lightbringer a powerful weapon that gives off a constant glow and heat no matter its surroundings. Theres more too but its just hard to summarize just read it if you care.
 
 
 
Information taken from books, show, and wikis.
 
Azor Ahai and the Prince that was Promised are different prophecies/people 
 Azor Ahai is Davos 
Prince that was Promised is Jon
 
 
Davos Azor Ahai Evidence
 
* As we know Rhilors power seems to be connected pretty closely with sacrifice. Keep that in mind.
 
Most of Davos story has been figured out in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/6eow24/everything_theory_ser_davos_seaworth_the_prince/) post but there is even more...
 
The 3 Forgings
(Now for this to work I am assuming that the first 2 swords are not Lightbringer and only the 3 try is the weapon described in the prophecy.)
 
Now Davos forging attempts are the big moments in his story (at least the ones that are emphasized) which coincide with him losing something dear to him. I believe these to be: saving the residents of Storms End during the Siege during Roberts Rebellion, Leading Stannis fleet at the Battle of the Blackwater , and according to the show losing Shireen Baratheon his surrogate daughter.
 
Forging 1
	Rescuing Storms End
 
Azor Ahai needed to forge a hero's sword.
Now what makes a hero other than doing heroic things, like slipping through a heavily fortified siege line to bring desperately needed supplies to a castle full of starving people. Now he did it because he knew they would pay the best price but still he saved all of their lives and that is what is stressed in both the books and show. 
 
He labored for thirty days and thirty nights until it was done. However, when he went to temper it in water, the sword broke. He was not one to give up easily, so he started over.
Davos brought the supplies through the siege line in Shipbreaker Bay. I think this represents the water described in the prophecy. 
And how is Davos repaid for his bravery by the acting Lord of Storms End Stannis Baratheon? 
 
 
As a reward for his service, Stannis knighted Davos, giving him choice lands on Cape Wrath and allowing him to choose Seaworth as the name of his new house. However, as payment for his past crimes, Davos lost the first joint from each finger of his left hand. Davos found the ruling just, and agreed to the terms if Stannis would swing the blade himself.
 
Undeterred by his loss as a result of smuggling food into Storms End (the ends of his fingers) Davos accepts what must happen and starts over with what he is offered.
 
 
 
* -Forging 2
	The Battle of the Blackwater 
 
Bear with this repetition but it is important:
Azor Ahai needed to forge a hero's sword.
Now what makes a hero other than doing heroic things, like leading a fleet to assault a heavily fortified and prepared Kings Landing which is being held by the Lannisters. 
 
 
The second time he took fifty days and fifty nights to make the sword, even better than the first. To temper it this time, he captured a lion and drove the sword into its heart, but once more the steel shattered.
During the battle Davos attempts to heroically crush the Lannister (lion) army but fails when his army is shattered by the wildfire. Additionally Davos also loses his son(s) during the battle another sacrifice of something dear to him.
 
 
* Forging 3
	The Sacrifice of Shireen Baratheon
Azor Ahai needed to forge a hero's sword.
 
Now what makes a hero other than doing heroic things, doing whatever it takes to win the Great War even if it means losing what you hold most dear. Obviously he would not have allowed it to happen if he had been there but it's clear from his reaction when he find out what has happened that this is one of the largest sacrifices he could ever make.
 
 
The third time, with a heavy heart, for he knew beforehand what he must do to finish the blade, he worked for a hundred days and nights until it was finished. This time, he called for his wife, Nissa Nissa, and asked her to bare her breast. He drove his sword into her living heart, her soul combining with the steel of the sword, creating Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes.
Now it can be argued that Davos didnt know what was going to happen to Shireen. But if you watch the goodbye scene in Dance of the Dragons (S5E9) try to tell me that isnt more of a goodbye forever than a see you next month. Also Davos definitely seems to sense something is up when he briefly questions Stanniss motives for sending him back to Castle Black. So the sacrifice of Shireen mirrors the sacrifice of Nissa Nissa. And as I mentioned before R'hilor power/magic seems to demands sacrifice in order to work.
 
 
Now here is where it gets interesting. 
 
	*Keep in mind- I am assuming that the first 2 swords are not Lightbringer and only the 3 try is the weapon described in the prophecy.*
 
 
	Whats the difference in the 3rd forging other than the stepped up severity? MELISANDRE or as I like to call her Lightbringer the Red Sword of Heroes!!!
 
Yeah thats right Lightbringer isnt a literal sword its Melisandre. Remember the emphasis on how Stannis chose not to bring the Red Woman to the Battle on the Blackwater, she claims that she is would have made the difference between success and failure, maybe shes right. Who leads the ceremonial sacrifice of Shireen? Who is later blamed for Shireens death by Davos and seems to have some regret for what she has done? Melisandre! 
 
 
 
 Lets remember what we know about Lightbringer.
Lightbringer is a sword of legend, forged and wielded by Azor Ahai, chosen by the Lord of Light to fight the darkness. The sword was said to glow and radiate heat, burning whoever touches it.
 
 
Okay so what else do we know of that does things like radiate heat, glow, and burns what it touches? Melisandre! What else do we know about her?
 
When Melisandre works magic, the ruby setting (in her choker) glows with power, and it may be able to burn her if the magic worked is particularly demanding.
Hmmm when channels the power of Rhilor the symbol of Melisandres power glows and radiated heat so powerful it can burn.
 
At some point prior to the start of the War of the Five Kings, Melisandre travels to Dragonstone on her own in search of a prophesied prince, Azor Ahai, who will lead the war for the dawn against the Great Other, the enemy to her god, R'hllor.
At Dragonstone,  she finds Stannis and the ever faithful Onion Knight Ser Davos. 
 
 
There are no shadows in the dark. Shadows are the servants of the light, the children of fire. The brightest flame casts the darkest shadows.
-Melisandre to Davos (right before she gives birth to a badass shadow assassin)
 
 
She even smells red. The scent reminded him of Mikkens forge, of the way iron smelled when red-hot; the scent was smoke and bloodYou are not cold, my lady? he asked her.
She laughed. Never. The ruby at her throat seemed to pulse, in time with the beating of
her heart. The Lords fire lives within me, Jon Snow. Feel. She put her hand on his
cheek, and held it there while he felt how warm she was.
-Jon describing Melisandre (ASoS Ch 76)
 
Sounds a lot like the imagery you would use for a weapon. Notice that she also exhibits the constant warmth and light associated with Lightbringer again here. Also whats up with all of the the red imagery around her. We have seen other servants of Rhilor (Thoros and Kinvara) but neither of and while both can channel Rhilors power they lack both the constant warmth and overbearing association with Red that Melisandre possesses. Lightbringer is also known as the Red Sword of Heroes and the army of Rhilor are called the Red Hand. Its clear that translation error have happened before so is it so much of a stretch that an ancient word meaning weapon was mistaken translated to sword. most likely the common weapon at the time?
 
 
I am a knight of sorts myself, sweet ser. A champion of light and life.
-Melisandre to Davos
More like the weapon of the champion of light and life
 
Many called her beautiful. She was not beautiful. She was red, and terrible, and red.
-Maester Cressen
More of a stretch but famous weapons are often described as beautiful despite their intended bloody, terrible use. People often disagree on whether a fancy weapon gun is beautiful even when its purpose it to kill. I also thought of that verse from Battle Hymn of the Republic, He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword. As I said more of a stretch.
 
Stannis: And you, my lady, what do you need?
Melisandre: To serve my Lord.
 
I only do what my Lord commands!
-Melisandre
 
Both of these quotes seem to portray her as helpless to make decisions, only being capable of carrying out commands. I believe that she also describes herself as a tool of the Lord of Light following his commands wherever they may lead. Kind of like a sword is only as good as its handler or Guns dont kill people, people kill people huh?
 
According to prophecy and reforge the great sword Lightbringer that defeated the darkness those thousands of years ago. If the old tales are true, a terrible weapon forged with the lifeblood of a loving wife's heart. Part of me thinks man was well rid of it, but great power requires great sacrifice.
Thoros of Myr
	""The Lord of Light, Histories &amp; Lore Season 3 
	Blu-ray Special Features
 
My theory on this is as follows. As we know Melisandre is really old, she once says that she has long waited for death but that Rhilor was not done with her yet. I think shes kind of like a Sword in the Stone, a chosen one of Rhilor possessing enormous power that can only be unlocked under the correct circumstances. 
The unworthy try to wield her only fail (Stannis), only the worthy can unlock her true power (Davos). This is why we see some hints that Stannis might be Azor Ahai, he was not worthy but he did have half of the puzzle, Melisandre. Melisandre admits that her visions are not perfect so it would come as not surprise that the had the right idea generally about Azor Ahai, going to Dragonstone and aligning with Stannis. She was just wrong about the individual she was suppose to be supporting. Now we know that the power magic has declined in the GoT universe over the past few centuries only to stage a comeback with events such as the birth of the dragons. Maybe over the centuries the amazing power of Melisandre/Lightbringer has begun to wane. Maybe she needs to be reforged in the power of Rhilor via a terrible sacrifice (Shireen) to become effective for the coming War.
 
We also know that GRRM loves Tolkien but disagrees with his good vs. evil approach to his Middle Earth works.
	
 The battle between Good and Evil is a theme of much of fantasy. But I think the battle between Good and Evil is fought largely within the individual human heart, by the decisions that we make.
-GRRM
 
It is certainly a genuine, legitimate topic as the core of fantasy, but I think the battle between Good and Evil is waged within the individual human hearts. We all have good in us and we all have evil in us, and we may do a wonderful good act on Tuesday and a horrible, selfish, bad act on Wednesday, and to me, thats the great human drama of fiction. I believe in gray characters, as Ive said before. We all have good and evil in us and there are very few pure paragons and there are very few orcs. A villain is a hero of the other side, as someone said once, and I think theres a great deal of truth to that, and thats the interesting thing. In the case of war, that kind of situation, so I think some of that is definitely what Im aiming at.
-GRRM
 
Now look at this quote from Davos and Mel:
Melisandre: Are you a good man, Davos Seaworth?
Davos: I am a man. I am kind to my wife, but I have known other women. I have tried to be a father to my sons, to help make them a place in this world. Aye, I've broken laws, but I never felt evil until tonight. I would say my parts are mixed, m'lady. Good and bad.
Melisandre: A grey man. Neither white nor black, but partaking of both.
 
 
 
 
Jon is the Prince that was Promised. Heres what the prophecy says will come about:
 
The birth of a male child - a prince
 
Maester Aemon claims this is an error, as High Valyrian is a neutral language. I think that GRRM is trying to trick us into believing that Danny is the PtwP with clues like this, yeah it's a neutral language which means it could be a girl or a boy. And is GRRM really giving away his big reveal with little clues like this and quotes from Red Priests claiming that Danny is PtwP or AA? No way this guy is all about the little twists and turns of dialogue, it's just too easy.
 
The prince is of the blood of the dragon.
Pretty self explanatory, hes a Targaryens.
 
Born amidst smoke.	
Jon is born during the height of Robert Rebellion, amidst the smoke of war. Another classic misdirection towards Danny by GRRM, nice try bud.
 
Born amidst salt.	
Jon was born amidst the salt of his mothers tears as she lies dying in the Tower of Joy. (Ned may have cried too who knows)
 
A bleeding star in the skies/ being born beneath a bleeding star
Jon was born in the Tower of Joy in Dorne. Dorne is ruled by House Martell with a house sigil of a red sun pierced by a golden spear. The sun is a star, when something is pierced it bleeds&gt; Jon is born on Dornish lands under control of the House of a bleeding sun. Again more misdirection by GRRM but it's one of the biggest clues. The comet seen over Planetos when Danny hatched her dragons is a comet, referred to such that way several times, not as a star. 
 
Possibly the return of dragons
Now until around the time that Jon is reborn, Danny just has 3 dragons. She hasnt really figured out how to use them as her ancestors, the Targaryens did. The dragons snap at her on occasion and she is unreliable in her control/bond with Drogon. After Jon executes his mutinous brothers he renounces his Nights watch vow to his name and all that went with it. Wait arent the Targaryens commonly referred to as Dragons? Jon, son of Rhaegar Targaryen is back. In that same episode Danny kills the Khals after they refuse to serve her, asserting her dominance over the horse lords (after all she is a dragon). THis is when we really see that Danny had seized the reigns, shes pulled it together and is really a Targaryen dragon of old, actual dragons and all. It was Jons rebirth that allowed him to regain his title as a Targaryen dragon allowing him to be the PwtP. Only after this happens does Danny get out of her slump and start dominating every enemy she comes up against with east. Jon renouncing his Nights Watch vow allows him to become the Targaryen PtwP and bring about the return of dragons (the magical Targaryen bloodline connected to dragons)
 
The Song of Ice and Fire
Jon is the son of Rhaegar (fire) and Lyanna (ice) his song is one of what happens when the Targaryen and Stark bloodlines come together. Rhaegar loved to sing and compose songs, he kind of seems like the kind of guy who would write about himself like that.
 
 
 
 
Unified theory
 
Melisandre: It means that the battle is begun. The sand is running through the glass more quickly now, and man's hour on earth is almost done. We must act boldly, or all hope is lost. Westeros must unite beneath her one true king, the prince that was promised, Lord of Dragonstone and chosen of R'hllor.
 
 
The dragon must have three heads
-Maester Aemon
 
These quotes may hold the key, a common theme throughout the books is that the Targaryens are the rightful rulers of Westeros. 
Look at the end of the Melisandre quote:Westeros must unite beneath her one true king, the prince that was promised, Lord of Dragonstone and chosen of R'hllor.
What is is not several descriptors of a single person but in fact 3 different people. The rightful rulers of Westeros are the Targaryens (also called Dragons), Westeros must unite beneath her one true king okay the true kings of Westeros are the Targaryens, but in this time of great need a single headed dragon is not enough. The dragon must have three heads  the prince that was promised (Jon), Lord of Dragonstone (Danny) and chosen of R'hllor (Davos/ Azor Ahai).
Together they can unite Westeros against the White Walkers, and save mankind.
 
 
 
 
Bonus stuff
 
Once Azor Ahai fought a monster. When he thrust the sword through the belly of the beast, its blood began to boil. Smoke and steam poured from its mouth, its eyes melted and dribbled down its cheeks, and its body burst into flame.
-The Jade Compendium
 
Okay so Ive got absolutely no proof for this part but if would be awesome and slightly unanticipated if Davos and Melisandre defeat the rumored Ice/ Wight Dragon. Think about it, yeah Danny and Drogon vs Night King and his dragon would be awesome but also predictable, this alternative would be a surprise and ties into lore in the GoT universe. In this scenario Melisandre would probably die.
 
I recently saw a [theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/6dx676/spoilers_main_ive_been_working_on_a_theory_about/) saying Jamie Lannister is Azor Ahai. One of the main points of the theory was the idea that valerian words had been mixed up through the ages.
Valyrian words for gold and hand are aeksion and ondos. Valyrian words for lord and light are aeksio and onos. He claims that Jamie and his golden hand is the actually meaning behind the diety worshipped as Rhilor the Lord of Light. I say close but no cigar, instead only half of the message was lost in translation, the words ondos and onos. What is the new incarnation of Azor Ahai is Aeksio (Lord) ondos (Hand), who is/was the Hand of the King (sometimes called Lord Hand) to the only ruler in Westeros history pledge himself to Rhilor the Red God? Ser Davos.
 
Additionally GRRM is known for drawing heavily from Norse Mythology and the theory draws on a [blog](http://gameofthronesandnorsemythology.blogspot.it/2013/05/jaime-azor-ahai-god-of-war.html) post that contests that Jamie represents Tyr -- the one-handed god of war -- the champion of mankind. The blog goes further to say Jamie is the only possible candidate to be Azor Ahai (Tyr) because he is the only one handed main character. False! Ser Davos is missing the ends of his fingers on one hand. Tyr dies in the final battle, killing the biggest monster and being killed by it. See my ice/wight dragon theory above.

**My question is this:** How might one explain the differences in accents among the Free Cities? Shae is from Lorath and has Germanic accent.  Syrio Forel (my favorite, albeit short-lived, character) is from nearby Braavos, and has a Mediterranean(?) accent. Melisandre is from somewhere(?) in Essos and has a Germanic accent as well (presumably Lorath). And then there are Varys and Thoros (from Lys and Myr) who have accents that wouldn't be out of place in Westeros.

ALL AVID GAME OF THRONES FANS GOTTA READ THIS",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/6fceb2/tv_this_is_a_theory_on_the_tv_show_using_mainly/,420theories,1496642016," In this theory, Jon and Danaerys have sex, and perhaps get married and the end of season 7. This fits in with the long time tradition of Targaryens wedding Targaryens. At a certain point in season 7, Jon will find out he is a Targaryen (whether from Bran or another source). A marriage/relationship between him and Dany is not only something fans have been hoping for, it also makes sense for both Jon and Dany. Jon, as King in the North, can bring the North under Dany's dominion through a marriage, and in return, Dany would come to realize the true danger the White Walkers and their army of the dead hold to the Seven Kingdoms. Although the battles in season 7 will be awesome, the battles in season 8 will be truly phenomenal. All the combatants for the iron throne will have to band together. Jon and Dany will already be in an alliance, and through Dany, Dorne and the Tyrells* will be in the fold. Thus, it would come down to Cersei to join the anti-White Walker alliance and unite the Seven Kingdoms for the Long Night. However, being the manipulative, power hungry, near insane queen she is, she will refrain from sending sizable reinforcements, or wont send at all, and she will hope that the white walkers kill her enemies. (*Btw, I believe in Season 7 Cersei will defeat the Tyrells early on, in order to cut down the amount of enemies in her path). At this point in season 8, when Cersei withholds her support and Jon/Dany/the others begin the engage the walker army, Jamie will truly come to realize his sisters insanity. Now, this whole time that Cersei has been plotting and withholding her help, Jon and Dany have some significant scenes as well. They would naturally grow closer. At the end of season seven, Viserion, Dany's dragon, will be killed and resurrected as an ice dragon. Season eight will see some nasty, and fucking amazing scenes of Drogon and Rhaegar fighting Viserion. Now, the Long knight begins, with the armies of the Vale, the North, Dany's massive army of Dothraki and Unsullied, perhaps some Dornish men, and others also (but not any Lannister men), fighting the massive army of the undead. Many battles and confrontations will occur in season eight, and also some in late season seven (specifically pertaining to living vs dead) will occur. The living will suffer worse losses than the dead, through Viserion being killed. I read somewhere that Jon will be turned into a half white walker, like coldhands, and this too fits in with this theory. At a certain point, the war will reach a tipping point, with a massive battle to take place. Prior the battle, Sam will have told Jon the legend of Azor Ahai, specifically the part about Nissa Nissa. Jon will come believe that this is the real way to combats the White Walkers. Perhaps Melisandre will verify this information for him. He will need a lightbringer, a sword of fire (if Jon becomes a half White Walker and attains this sword, than he is truly a ""son of ice and fire). Jon has to kill Dany, in order to turn bearclaw (or perhaps a different weapon..Dawn??) into light bringer. Dany's death will be the bittersweet aspects of the ending GRRM has mentioned. Anyway, Jon will kill Dany, stabbing her through the heart, and he will assume the role of Azor Ahai. After Dany's death, Drogon will refuse to let anyone ride him, so Jon will ride Rhaegar. This fits perfectly, as Rhaegar was Jon's father. Drogon will kill Viserion, and he himself will be killed in the process (resurcted? possible, but not probable). Viserion and Drogon are both dead, and Jon has Rhaegar and Ghost (another Ice and Fire reference). At this point, the battle of the dead vs. the living is still raging on. Jon kills the Night king with his flaming sword, and all the other white walkers. While this battle is happening (Jon vs. the white walkers...Drogon vs. Viesrion) the armies of dead and living will be fighting. At the tipping point, Lannister reinforcements will arive. Back at King's Landing, Jaime becomes increasingly aware of Cersies madness, and begins wondering what his father would think of House Lannister sitting doing nothing while the whole realm is in danger. What type of legacy is that? Jaime is forced into a position where he must kill Cersie, but honestly, it is more of a release for both of them. Cersie is hanging on by a thread, and she was truly mad. Jaime takes command of the lannister army, and marches them north in times to turn the scales of the battle. This leaves Kings Landing Empty of any occupying force or ruler. At the end of the battle, after the wights are destroyed and the White Walkes defeated, everyone reconvenes. Jon is declared Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, protector of the realm...etc. Jon was actually the rightful heir. He had more of a claim then Dany, and thus he will be elected similar to the way he was made King in the North. He will not seize power, it will be given to him by the masses. Note that Dany really never could end up queen, because she cannot have children, and thus will not leave an heir. Jon however, can have kids, and he can leave an heir. Jon will be put on the throne, the north will be in stark hands, and the rightful order will be reestablished. A meeting between Jaime and Bran will no doubt happen, probably after the final battle. Jaime will either put himself in exile, or be forced into it (not executed for his crimes due to his timely assitance). This meeting will be amazing to witness though. Littlefinger will have been executed by on the order of Sansa prior these events. As to Euron and the Ironborn, i can only assume they will not play an extremely significant role. Jon will probably not keep Tyrion as his Hand, probably choosing Davos. Thus, Tyrion will be made Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West. Endgame is Jon as the rightful King on the Iron Throne, with Rhaegar as his dragon and Ghost (significant through symbolism). Dany dead as a hero, Drogon dead, Viserion dead, the white walkers finished, Bran as lord of Winterfell, Sansa as lady of Winterfell (will Sansa have a Kid from Ramsey??) Tyrion as Lord of Casterly Rock. Jamie is in exile, either forced or or voluntary. As to the fate of the Reach, the Stormlands, the Vale, and Dorne, either rightful rulers will be restored or new ones placed their by Jon. Jon will arrive back at Kings Landing and establish order, as the city begins to descend into chaos. He is appointed King, and that will be how the show ends.",2,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Let's put aside other possibilities like ""Jon won't survive"" or ""Sansa is already pregnant"" or ""Dany can't have children"". Also, this one is from the audience's perspective most of whom are - or atleast should be - skeeved out by incest. Assuming Jon has to marry one of them before the end, which one would skeeve you out more?

Dany is a full-Targ, Jon is 1/2-Targ, 1/2-Stark and Sansa is 1/2-Stark, 1/2-Tully. Blood relation-wise, I'd say Jon is closer to Dany than he is to Sansa. Dany is his aunt, whereas Sansa is his first cousin. Put in those terms, his marriage to Sansa does sound slightly better. OTOH, Jon was brought up thinking of Sansa as his sister (and vice-versa). And despite his Targ blood, he wasn't raised to find incest acceptable - and I doubt that would change. Dany is practically a stranger - so not thinking of her as his blood-relative might help. So, which union would you find more palatable? 

Would Jon not knowing his heritage change the equation? Is is better to marry your cousin believing her to be your half-sister or is it better to marry your aunt without knowing that she is your aunt?

And is considering the possible progeny be a factor? Jon/Sansa's child would be a 1/2-Stark, 1/4-Targ and 1/4-Tully. Jon/Dany's child would be 3/4-Targ and 1/4-Stark. Also, historically Targ blood has been purer (read: more inbred) than Stark blood. Jon/Dany's child would have a much higher risk of inheriting the Targ mad gene. Jon/Sansa's child would probably be more viable and better off with less inbreeding in its genetic heritage. Does this change your view on the matter? ",25,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

Also, who is true leader from the Targaryen side? After Rhaegar dies, the mad king dies: Since Rhaegar dies before the mad king his son wouldn't be the rightful heir. Instead Viserys would be...

With that out of the way, this was the zenith of the Hound's redemption arc up to this point. At his confrontation with Brienne, he was actually caring for Arya. He wanted to protect her. He was almost crossing the line to being a good person. Then Brienne shows up out of nowhere, wearing Lannister made armor and demanding the Stark girl handed over to him. When Arya clearly refuses, Brienne draws his sword and attacks the Hound. Brienne's attack was the lowest her character ever reached while the Hound was at the peak of his character. In this instance, the Hound was right and Brienne was the bad guy. Anyone who would have seen this scene without having watched/read any of the previous scenes about them would have placed Clegane in the right.

And yet, after a bloody and very undignified battle, Brienne won. It wasn't a victory of a good guy against a bad guy, but a total destruction of a redemption in process by the most dishonorable act an otherwise good character had committed. When though about it, the Hound's one chance to redeem himself being thrown into the trash for no reason is a very cruel prospect and imo was one of the darkest and emotionally impactful moments of season 4. Arya's refusal to grant the Hound the mercy killing was all the more salt over the wound, though I think that it made her seem unnecessarily cruel. 

I know a lot of people don't enjoy this scene, but I feel that the fact that the Hound is a better fighter than Brienne as well as him havin been in the right have made this scene both very powerful and very in line with GoT's messages about moral ambiguity and justice. It was one of the best examples of the show's own creative direction, which unfortunately kind of went to trash in season 5.",173,612,False,spoiler,,,,,

Despite spending a lot of time on it in seasons 5 and 6, I feel that the world of the faceless men needs more elaboration. We haven't really seen many different people use this technique and we don't know what the implications are of such a religion.

It seems like kind of a big deal that's getting glanced over, the concept that there is a cult of highly trained assassins able to disguise themselves as anyone. It seems odd that Arya is the only one to use that technique to further an agenda and change the political game. I feel that the 'faceless men' thing should have been expanded to include more characters, more surprises, another force to be reckoned with in the show. The conclusion to Arya's story in Braavos felt a bit anticlimactic because after all those mysteries, it turns out there wasn't that much left to discover.

I know that the FM thing is supposed to be mysterious and that the FM live by a certain code and that the show is overcrowded as it is, but I just feel like the potential for an expanded FM universe is there.

Now the reason I am making this is because with the new season coming out soon (In July) I thought it be a good time to rank each season so far from worst to best and be sure to let me know how you rank the seasons. Anyways let's get started:

- S5 (I think we can agree and that all Book readers, Show Watchers, and even non-book reading show watchers will agree that season 5 is the weakest season of the show so far. For starters really nothing happens in the season besides The Gift, Hardhome, and Mother's Mercy. Oh and a certain burning (and yes this means I do not count a certain scene that may or may not have happened in episode 6) Also it made very unnecessary decisions that even myself someone who has not even read any of the books will even think is unnecessary, had a surprising amount of filler, and was just depressing even by Game of Thrones standards and please do not even get me started on Dorne. However it was not all that bad for example Tyrion and Jorah's plotline and Daenerys plotline in my opinion was actually pretty enjoyable and I like the banter between Jorah and Tyrion, Hardhome is one of the most memorable moments on the show, Ramsay proves that he is indeed a brutal villain which is a Plus because the most hated villains make the most memorable (and do not get me wrong I hate Ramsay to the end of the earth), and I do atleast respect them for trying to go off books)

- S2 (now this an unpopular opinion but I am sorry I just was not that into season 2. Not only is it also (in part atleast) to depressing even by GOT standards but also it was in my opinion is the least memorable season (besides some exceptions which i'll get to later), Dealing with Joffrey as much as the actor does a good job is still a hard task (not saying he is a bad villain but still), and also I feel Arya's stay in Harrenhal could've been made shorter. That being said though Arya's stay at Harrenhal still had some important moments to her arc (a la Tywin's conversations and the scenes with jaqen), Dany's plotline and Pretty much the whole KL plotline were the highlights for me, and also the battle of blackwater bay was pretty cool. Also the chemistry between Jon and Ygritte is very well done)

- S1 (now this one is the season that got us introduced to the world and set up the rest of the story for us to follow and it also broke the fairytale troupes which is something the rest of the season would do. Though at the sametime though it has less big shocking moments then the other season (minus Ned's and Viserys death), It is not as epic as the seasons after, and also that this is a setup season basically setting up the rest of the season)

- S3 (This season was a very good season a lot of stuff happened in this season, Arya's plotline, Dany's plotline, Robb's plotline, and Jaime and Brienne's plotline were highlights, we get to see the dragons in action, and of course the red wedding. Now for downs I would say that the actor who played Daario in season 3 was not that great anyone else could've played him instead, we still have to deal with Joffrey, and this season is infamous for having Gendry row into the abyss never to be seen again)

- S6 (this one is the second best in my opinion. It learned from the mistakes of S5, it has a lack of filler, Bran's plotline, Jon and Sansa's plotline, and KL plotline are highlights, we get the siege of riverun which is something fans wanted last season and we got here, Battle of the Bastards, Winds of Winter, Tower of Joy, faster pace, and Hold the door. However it is not perfect for explain Tyrion and Sam did not really do much, Dorne is butchered...again, And while I did enjoy Arya's plotline for the first six episodes after that it did start to drag on)

- S4 (this is still hands down the best season to date. A lot of big moments happened like the purple wedding, the battle at the wall, and Trial by combat, Oberyn is an awesome character, Sansa's plotline, Arya's plotline, Jon's plotline, and Tyrion's plotline are highlights, it has the most big deaths, and also it changes the story so much. If there was one problem I had is that Dany's plotline does drag alittle)",132,189,False,spoiler,,,,,

I'd much rather see a Dunk and Egg spin-off. Or something from the long night and when the others first arrived (that ones not very likely, but I would still like it). That would be really cool. I know that from a production stand point Robert's Rebellion would be probably the easiest since they can use pretty much all of the same sets and locations they've already used.

The comment was: 

&gt;Jorah is such a well written and multi dimensional character. One mistake and he's still paying for it every day of his life, and no matter how hard he tries at redemption and becomes an honorable person, that stain will never leave him. He's one of the most relatable characters in the series and I really wish him a happy ending, but it will probably end up like Ned. 



Who else do we know has committed a dishonorable act and is still paying for it every day? Jaime ""Kingslayer"" Lannister. I have never really thought about these characters in relation to each other, in part because their storylines have never really overlapped. Upon further reflection, Jorah and Jaime actually seem to have several things in common:


* Both are reviled for an initial act that is considered dishonorable - Jorah enslaves poachers and sells them, and Jaime kills the king he was sworn to protect. It is important to note that Jaime's reason for killing Aerys is a sound one, but very few people know the reality behind his actions. Jorah's reason is rather weak by comparison (doing it to fund the fancy lifestyle his wife desired). You could also argue that neither of them would have been in the position they were in if not for the women they love. One of Jaime's primary motivations for joining the Kingsguard was so that he could be close to Cersei...and his role in the Kingsguard is what placed him at Aerys' side at the pivotal moment. As for Jorah - it seems unlikely that he would have engaged in the slave trade if not for his desperate need to fund Lynesse's lifestyle, which was essential to preserving the marriage. 


* Both have committed crimes in the name of the women they love - women who are superficial and manipulative, and certainly do not seem to exhibit the same degree of love as their counterpart. These traits are admittedly more evident in Cersei, since she is a main character. We don't know as much about Lynesse Hightower - it seems that she did initially fall for Jorah - but it is made pretty clear that she quickly fell out of love with him, and was unhappy in their marriage (she hated the north and missed the lavish lifestyle she had previously led in Oldtown/the Reach).  


* Both are still paying for crimes committed years ago. In this case, Jorah has arguably only done one particularly shitty thing that we are aware of in the intervening years (informing on Dany), whereas Jaime continues to do some pretty horrific stuff (pushing Bran out of a window, threatening to launch a baby over Riverrun's battlements with a catapult, etc.). The thing to remember here is that Jorah's wife left him, and so the motivating factor for his prior misdeed is now gone. Jaime, on the other hand, still has Cersei manipulating him, so I feel his waffling makes a little more sense (although is certainly far from excusable). 


* Both are *trying* to be better men, in part because they were inspired by women who see the good in them - Brienne and Dany. Unlike Jorah, Jaime backslides, but he typically backslides in areas where Cersei is concerned, and even then, he does his best to uphold the oaths he made to Catelyn. He has done things that he was in no way obligated to do - he went back to Harrenhal and saved Brienne, and he gave Brienne his fancy valyrian sword, supplies, horses, and a squire, and explicitly sent her on a mission to find and protect Sansa and Arya. I don't believe that the ""old"" Jaime would have done either of those things...certainly not the later, since it involved going against the wishes of Cersei (and, presumably, Tywin). 


* This last point is by far the weakest, but is a similarity all the same - both have, in essence, forfeited their inheritance in the name of love. Jorah likely knew the ramifications of his actions, and Jaime absolutely knew what he was giving up when he joined the Kingsguard. Both ultimately made the choice to lose (or risk losing) the lands they would have otherwise inherited. Both have also given up valyrian steel swords in the process - Jorah made the conscious decision to leave Longclaw when he could have easily taken it, as stated by Jeor...and this says something, because, had he kept it, Jorah could have sold it for large sum, which would have possibly kept Lynesse with him a bit longer. Jaime chose to give Brienne Oathkeeper (not once, but twice, in fact) - Jaime was keenly aware of how long (and how badly) Tywin had wanted to procure a valyrian steel blade for house Lannister, and by giving the sword to Brienne, he makes a decision to face Tywin's wrath. (Jaime was somewhat ""fortunate"" in this regard - Tywin did not live long enough to realize the sword was gone. I don't think it's a stretch to say that Tywin would have been *furious* - Jaime would have needed to lie about its absence, otherwise Tywin would have sent out a force to hunt down Brienne and reclaim the sword.) Thus, I'd argue that both part with their inheritance in the name of *love*, and similarly part with their families' valyrian steel swords in the name of *honor*. 


In the end, I'm not sure what this reveals to us about these characters - I'm still thinking this over. My gut reaction in instances like this is to consider the fact that the characters are possibly meant to be foils, but I really don't know if this entirely accurate. The show seems to portray Jorah as more of a reformed hero, and Jaime as a bit of an antihero, and in that sense they could very well be foils, but there is potentially much left to be seen. The show has passed the books in terms of Dany's storyline, and only caught up to and surpassed the King's Landing arc at the very end season 6. There is quite a bit left to unravel - perhaps what will be truly telling in regards to these characters is how things play out in relation to the women they admire...the women who brought honor back into their lives. Would Jorah be able to kill Dany if he had to? Would Jaime be able to kill Brienne? (While it would be pretty interesting and extremely telling if Jaime had to choose between killing Cersei and killing Brienne, I am somewhat doubtful that scenario will crop up...I'm not quite sure how Brienne would wind up in KL, since she has no real motivation to travel there.) 

What do you guys think? Is there perhaps something to these similarities? How do you think things will end for Jorah and Jaime in regards to the women in their lives, and what does it say about who they are / who they have become?

543,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2017-6-6,2017,6,6,1,6ff3wn,self.gameofthrones,[EVERYTHING] (Another) Arya S6 Theory,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/6ff3wn/everything_another_arya_s6_theory/,Zerve,1496678703,"Alright alright, I don't really frequent around here so my apologies if this has been posted, or sounds kinda erratic, but just another theory regarding Arya and the whole ""a girl is no one"" thing. So let's look at some facts first:

* Arya was given a job to kill the Actress, Lady Crane
* Once a target is named, death is certain, but it can take anywhere from a few minutes to months (mentioned in season 2)
* During the whole Waif vs Arya encounter, ""a face needed to be added"" to the hall (or some quote like that), either the Waif or Arya's

With that in mind, Arya completed her mission. The actress was killed, fulfilling the first two points. Why? Because it doesn't matter how the death occurred, just that the many faced god receives what was promised: the death of the Actress. The way that Jaqen words everything, it seems as if it's not ""him"" who is promising ""giving"" the gift of death; rather, it is a faceless man's duty to ensure that the target ""receives"" the gift. A man could argue that Arya's whole botched assassination attempts were all part of her facade which inevitably lead to her death. Even though the Waif was the one which struck the killing blow, Arya's injuries lead her to Lady Crane's residence (infiltration) allowing ""no one"" to take the life and give the gift. In other words, point one ""Arya was assigned to kill Lady Crane"" could more or less be described as ""Lady Crane must die,"" with no mention of ""who"" should do it (since obviously it is no one). After the Actress's death, we then see the whole chase scene, with the candles going out, and see the Waif's face being added to the wall. Point three is now satisfied. After seeing this, Jaqen names Arya as ""no one,"" and her ""mission"" is now complete.",1,20,False,spoiler,,,,,

To think, two weeks ago I didn't know my Tyrell's from my Lanister's.

Favorite 5 Characters: Jon Snow, Sam THE SLAYER, Arya Stark, Tyrion, Bronn.

Favorite Episode: The Watchers on the Wall. (Battle of the Bastards is a close second)

Favorite Death: Oberyn Martell, because YOU RAPED HER, YOU MURDERED HER, YOU KILLED HER CHILDREN.

Most Shocking Moment: The Red Wedding. I knew it was coming, but I was absolutely certain that they wouldn't kill Robb because he's in the middle of his story. How wrong I was.... Close second is when Tommen jumped off the balcony..... or maybe when Jaime got his hand cut off. 

Favorite Quote: Too hard to pick, or remember. But basically everything Bronn said.

Favorite Thing to Do After Every Episode: My favorite thing to do after every single episode was to come and see the responses on the episode discussion threads (https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/wiki/episode_discussion). It was really cool to see people from 6, 5, 4, etc. years ago reacting to the things I'm reacting to now. 

Thing I'm Looking Forward to: Being able to react ALONG with the people of this good subreddit. 

Thanks Comcast (Never thought I'd say that) for randomly giving me 3 free months of HBO and pushing me over the edge. Now on to Westworld!

The logistics must've been brought up before, right?

In the beginning of the season, the Boltons were expecting the Lannister army to eventually march on them. It'd make sense for them to fortify and defend the strategic choke point of Moat Cailin. Its importance was made clear on the show as well - Roose Bolton had to sneak into the North while the Ironborn held it. Littlefinger left the army near Moat Cailin as well and smuggled in to talk to Sansa. So how did the whole army make it past without the Boltons knowing about it?


Bypassing Moat Cailin with help from the Crannogmen seems like an unlikely solution. LF only had the letter from Sansa to prove that he was on Stark side - so he'd have to first get the letter, find Howland Reed and then take the long and slow detour - doesn't sound like there was enough time between Sansa writing the letter and the battle. 

The garrison at Moat Cailin might've been defeated, but for that to happen without so much as a message being sent to the Bolton's? That seems unlikely as well. 

Another option might be that some of the other Northern Lords were helping them - that they might've pretended that it was an order from the Boltons to let the Vale army pass. And they might've covered for their movement upto Winterfell. But given their neutrality, that seems unlikely as well. 

These theories are plausible, but not conclusive.

I don't think it has been made clear on the show, but are there any hints to how it might have actually happened?",20,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

""An aquiline nose,high cheekbones,a strong jaw. He kept his face clean-shaven, but his *THICK HAIR* fell to his collar like a silver glacier, divided by a streak of *MIDNIGHT BLACK*""

JON IS THE SWORD OF MORNING. ARTHUR DAYNES KID. 

He (Arthur Dayne) was in love with Lyanna. She was in love with him. This is why HE was there protecting her. THIS is what he wanted to talk to Ned about before Ned brought all his friends with him and THIS is what Lyanna whispered in Neds ear. And he will find Arthur Daynes sword Dawn in the Crypts.

I also think Dany had one of her stronger seasons, as it had been a while to see Dany not being able to control something, this time meereen.

5. Jon during the battle decides to not give up living and Sansa comes in with the Vale.

6. Jon is proclaimed King in the North and is truly reborn.

The one thing that I am hoping for is the sad, mopey, undecided, deferring Jon is dead. If the story they were trying to tell is he is reborn now at the end of the season (not when he was actually reborn), then they really need to show it. We need a more aggressive, assured, and non mopey Jon or even the sense of what I tried to make out of the S6 plot still doesn't make sense. His interactions with characters need to be different.

&gt; Wow. I'm left speechless. Murder, execution, incest, all in the pilot episode. Figured it was going to be a slow grind and build up to get to the good parts, but nope it just throws you right into it. Gave me the same feeling as the first time my old roommate sat me down to watch the pilot of Breaking Bad. 


&gt; Only a little more than a month left to binge watch the remaining six seasons. Wish me luck, hopefully I'll be able to watch Season 7 live with the rest of you!


&gt; Edit: 

&gt; **Ep 2 - The Kingsroad**  

&gt; * Poor Lady :/ 

&gt; **Ep 4 - Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things**  

&gt; * So winter isn't yearly? I was wondering why people were freaking out so much. That's pretty cool.

&gt; * Damn that joust scene is far from the realm of A Knight's Tale.

&gt; **Ep 5 - The Wold and the Lion**

&gt; * ~~Borimir~~ Ned stays getting impaled. The Lannisters are no doubt evil but they're pretty badass. 

&gt; **Ep 6 - A Golden Crown**

&gt; * I'd be so down to go to jury duty if all trials had that giant hole in the sky. 

&gt; * Sooooo I know that Joffrey Baratheon ""Golden hair"" thing was important but no idea why. All the others had black hair? So he's a bastard too? 

&gt; * Dragon girl's brother reminds me of Loki a lot. 

&gt; * reminded. this show is so metal 

&gt; **Ep 7 - You Win or You Die**

&gt; * Oh the father Lannister is still alive. Interesting. 

&gt; * Little Finger is a sneaky bitch. 


&gt; **EP 8 - The Pointy End**

&gt; * Seems like the Snows are more brave than the actual Stark sons

&gt; * Zombies?

&gt; * So it's been a couple of episodes but that wall is freaking massive. Can't wait to find out why. 

&gt; * That one guy who only says his name makes me crack up everytime. ~~Odor?~~ Hodor. 

&gt; * Man I hope this little Draco shit gets what he deserves (Sansa sucks too)



**Ep 9 - Baelor**

* Curios as to why the Targaryens were massacred.

* Khaleesi straight up rewriting the rules of a entire culture like its nothing

*  **WAIT WHAT**. I kept waiting for someone to come save Ned like ""okay how are they going to pull this off"" but NOPE THEY JUST KILLED HIM. *slice* :O

**Ep 10 - Fire and Blood**

* I've really grown to like that captive prisoner from North of the wall. Which as I'm starting to learn means she'll be dead soon. 

* Even the cousin. That Lannister queen sure loves her incest.

* Killing off Drogo's son and Drogo? Quick end that storyline I guess.  ~~Also thought Khaleesi was going to throw the witch off the cliff.~~ Burning her alive was better.  

* Oooo Dragons. 

As far as a first season goes, that was amazing. Usually it takes until the 2nd or 3rd  season for shows to really get going. 

# Season 2 

**Ep 1 - The North Remembers**

*  Something definitely happened when they killed Lady and the crippled Stark woke up.
* I like how the red velvet lady just drank the poison while maintaining eye contact. She seems fun.
* Got a serious ""kill every firstborn male"" vibe from the ending  

**Ep 2 - The Night Lands** 

* The Starks sure have managed to piss off a lot of people over the years

**Ep 3 - What Is Dead May Never Die**

* So Theon definitely felt up his sister. Thought this whole time that he was a Stark-bastard like Jon is. 

* Tyrion telling each person he'd sell Myrcella to someone different was so smart. Hated that old dude anyways.  

**Ep 4 - Garden of Bones**

* Joffrey is really starting to feel himself 

* Hollllly fuck that rat scene had me cringing and grabbing my chest

* So Melisandre just gave birth to the black smoke monster from Lost. It all makes sense now. 

**Ep 5 - The Ghost of Harrenhal**

* Damn I really liked that stag King guy. Smoke monster is just as sneaky as the Little Finger. 

* Poor Lancel always getting picked on. Dude never can get a break

* Not too fond of Theon's sister

**Ep 6 - The Old Gods and the New**

* Can't wait for Robb to come back and beat Theon's ass. 

* Father Lannister seems like a reasonable man. 

* Someone seriously stole the dragons. Khaleesi doesn't seem like someone I'd cross. 

This was probably my favorite episode so far. You see Theon go all Anakin on the Starks, the city start to turn on Joffrey, and Snow finally get a chance at Ranger duties (although he fucks up like usual).

**Ep 7 - A Man Without Honors**

* ~~Hate that they're humanizing Jaime simply because I can't wait to see his head chopped off.~~ Well fuck.. Killed his cousin as I'm writing that.

* Qarth is screwed. 

* Tyrion almost comforted his sister. Almost. 

* Was that really Bran burnt at the end? Regardless you could tell Theon knows how much of a dick he's become. Him and Anakin parallel each other well. 

**Ep 8 - The Prince of Winterfell**

* Theon's sister just called him a dumb cunt. Maybe I do like her. 

* ~~The lady Robb likes seems fishy~~ Well he married her.

* Lady Stark really just traded Jaime for Sansa what the FUCK. No one even likes Sansa!

* Poor farmer boys and family. But heyyy at least Bran is alive!

**Ep 9 - Blackwater**

* Tyrion definitely has a plan just dont know what exactly.

* Oh wow. Boom. That was gorgeous.

* Couldn't help but laugh when Lancel got shot with that arrow

* WHOA the Hound has PTSD from the fire! 

* Huh? Did I just see a Kingsguard attack Tyrion? 

**Ep 10 - Valar Morghulis**

* Thought Sansa left with the Hound. She really is that dumb. Tossed aside like a piece of paper by Joffrey. 

* Heh. Theon got punked.

* Assassins Creed dude just changed faces what

* How tf did Sam not die there. 

Great season. Overall, I think I like this one more than the first. All the stories are starting to hit their pace and I'm really getting to know the characters. However, the first season still has the better overall shock moment with Ned's decapitation. Favorite character so far is either ~~the Wildling taking care of Bran~~ Osha or Arya. 

# Season 3 

**Ep 1 - Valar Dohaeris**

* Quite a few characters owe their lives to the decision not to kill the dire wolf pups. They've definitely come in handy. 

* Whoa there are giants

* Tyrion no doubt has daddy issues 

* The little girl warlock with the scorpion-filled pokeball was legit creepy

**Ep 2- Dark Wings, Dark Words**

* hehehe Theon getting what he deserves

* Can't figure out Joffrey's new bride for the life of me. 

* They really do look like crows

**Ep 3 - Walk of Punishment**

* Okay the scene where Tywin is sitting down staring at his counsel, waiting for them to join him has to be my favorite scene so far

* The whitewalkers? (dead dudes with blue eyes) seem to lay their kills out in patterns. Interesting. 

* She's really going to give away one of her Dragons?

* DAMN JAIME'S HAND :O like a hot knife through butter. 

**Ep 4 - And Now His Watch Has Ended**

* Cersei doesn't seem to like Joffrey's new girl

* Wow Theon just got played so hard. Good. 

* Feels like the Tyrell siblings are plotting with each other to steal the Iron Throne through marriage. 

* Yes! The old fart with the daughters is dead!  

* NO not Lord Commander though! :(  So many emotions in five seconds.

* Ohhh fuck Khalisee understood him the whole time, she's not giving up any dragon. 

* The Unsullied are awesome too. They seem ever stronger than the Dothraki.

**Ep 5 - Kissed by Fire**

* Fighting the Hound with a flaming sword seems a bit unfair. Wait that eye patch dude didn't die? o.O

* Can't help but feel like Robb made a mistake executing the Lord who killed the two boys. 

* ~~The Kingslayer~~ Jaime has more layers to him after all. 

* Oof. These arranged Lannister marriages will go well. 

**Ep 6 - The Climb**

* Wonder what Melisandre meant about the blacksmith kid making Kings rise and fall

* Blue eyes, Green eyes (Joffrey?), and Brown eyes. The names Arya repeats?

* oh HELL no. I could never in a million years climb that wall.  Come get me White Walkers. 

* Whew buddy Theon's really getting it now 

* Yep that's exactly why I wouldn't climb that wall

**Ep 7 - The Bear and the Maiden Fair**

* Seems like Jon is going to ""betray"" his Irish Wildling girlfriend in the end

* When Jaime just swore to return the Stark girls, he didn't say alive.

* Man this guy **really** hates Theon for some reason. 

* Dammit do I like Jaime now? Didn't think that was possible but he went back for the lady knight

**Ep 8 - Second Sons**

* Arya won't give the Hound a second chance when i feel like he's trying to protect her

* Bit late but this map has been invaluable to me throughout this binge-fest: [World View - Westeros &amp; Essos](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/18/08/4d/18084dc915ff2fb10753da442ac0acd5.jpg)

* Three seasons in and still don't know the name but the blacksmith kid is so screwed

* Joffrey is loving the shit out of Sansa's misery right now. Complete sociopath. Even Draco had some likability, but this kid is straight up out of The Omen. 

* If only Tyrion wasn't a half-man, he'd probably have snapped on his father instead of always venting it on Joffrey

* His toast ""and so my watch begins"" when Sansa says she never wants to share a bed was amazing. 

* Sam, the White Walker slayer. Although did seem a little easy to kill.

Thanks to /u/NX_IAmBecome for providing me with an even better [map](https://quartermaester.info/).

**Ep 9 - The Rains of Castamere**

* Damn Jon just left his Wildling girlfriend behind and she was protecting him. Her face said it all. 

* ~~Surprised Bran didn't notice Jon right there when he entered the wolves head.~~ oh he did

* Awww no. bye Osha :/ hopefully she returns to the storyline.

* Bedding ceremony is pretty creepy

* Maybe it's just the pessimist in me but Robb's new wife seems destined to die. -YEP. IT WAS JUST TOO HAPPY. 

* Wowowowowowowowowow so many people just died

* **WHAT. DID. I. JUST. WATCH**


The way Rob and Catelyn are shot makes you think they'll survive. Then she makes her plea and Frey  just laughs in her face. I'm waiting for Robb to pull his sword and run at the king in a 300-style final stand, but all he says is ""mother"". 

Then I finally hear maybe the most famous words in GOT history (at least to an outsider like me). Robb, who after Ned's death, I had assumed was the new ""main character,"" is gutted, and then Catelyn just autopilots the execution of the wife (yay!). 

There she stands, completely broken with no reason left to live, and has her throat cut. Fade to black.

The choice of no music for the credits was brilliant. No one in my house is home, so I was left in complete silence, hand covering my wide open mouth. Didn't move till the fuzzy HBO logo played at the end. 

**Ep 10 - Mhysa**

* I'm shocked that there's another episode and the last one wasn't the finale

* Tyrion doesn't look like he's playing around with Joffrey anymore

* Don't trust anything after last episode, I'm just expecting every single person to get an arrow to the face out of no where while watching this. 

* Yara is more loyal to Theon than I thought 

* Cersei seems pretty set on not marrying Loris. Wonder what she has planned. 

* Arya &amp; the Hound are awesome to watch together. She went from just a little side character to one of the storylines I like the best. 

* Shooting someone with 3 arrows sure is one way to break up with them 

* Sir Devos saving Gendry. My man. 

So that's that. The mini-war is over, with the Lannister's prevailing while the Starks have been all but decimated. It's really fun to experience a show where the good guys don't necessarily win. I've been so conditioned to expect the protagonist to pull it out that the death of the Starks came out of left field for me. My prediction for how the next three series play out is that the Lannister's reign continues to spiral into chaos, the focus shifts to the war on the Wall, and then just when that ends, Dany and her dragons will come from the South to really cause havoc. 

# Season 4 

**Ep 1 - Two Swords**

* Didn't take long for them to get to the title of the episode 

* Tyrion walking into the room while the Dornish Prince pulls the knife out of the man's wrist like ""Yep, exactly what I expected"" 

* Jaime will never regain the respect he once had. Even Joffrey is  burning him.

* Sir Dontis giving his necklace to Sansa makes no sense. Sell that if its worth so much and escape Kings Landing. 

* Hmm Hound has become one of my favorites now in place of Osha

* Oh wow Arya repeated every word the dude said while stabbing him in the neck with Needle. 

**Ep 2 - The Lion and the Rose**

* The bastard dude who tortures Reek...goddamn...makes Joffrey seem like a kitten. -Ahh name is Ramsey Snow. 

* Absolutely loved loved loved Reek's face when he found out Robb died.  *It's all just a game.*

* Bye Shae. In the end it is for the better, although Tyrion was pretty cold about it. 

* The tension between Joffrey vs Tyrion at the royal wedding is crazy.

* ~~Stupid pie ruining the moment~~ oh wait hold up

* Muhahahahahahaha the little shit is dead. I didn't think they'd actually do it. So that only leaves Balon left then from the leeches spell. 

The poison had to go into his wine when he was cutting the pie or something. But who did it? My bet is on Margaery since she's the one Joffrey hands the cup to and also the one that feeds him, the Spider since he wants to protect the realm, or the Dornish Prince. 

**Ep 3 - Breaker of Chains**

* Why does anyone trust Little Finger anymore

* Raping your sister next to your dead son...umm...wow.

* Didn't even notice the Freys offered breadright to the Starks at the wedding

* Tywin killing Joffrey actually makes a lot of sense

**Ep 4 - Oathkeeper**

* So Little Finger wants the Throne for himself

* Just when I think I know who killed Joffrey they make me think it's someone else

* White Walker with crowns? So there are even more powerful ones than the dude with dead Sea Biscuit 

**Ep 5 - First of His Name**

*  Oooo Margaery just called Cersei sister again

* Wow Catelyn's sister is shady and the Lannisters are basically poor.

* Wouldn't mind Robin falling through the moon hole

* This whole quest with Bran is very strange. 

* Other warg kid's hand just lit on fire. Um alright. 

* Bran taking over Hodor, now that's pretty cool 

* All these crows fighting each other much be pretty confusing 

**Ep 6 - The Laws of Gods and Men**

* Talk about Stockholm Syndrome with Theon/Reek

* Dragons are getting pretty big now

* When is someone not trying to execute Tyrion 

* Damn Shae is so salty

* *Rains of Castamere* playing for the credits. Symbolic?

**Ep 7 - Mockingbird**

* Feel like Stannis' daughter is going to be sacrificed 

* Oberyn vs The Mountain only $99 on PPV 

* Oh shit Sansa actually did something for once and just slapped Robin. 

* Sansa kisses Little Finger, then goes and stands right next to his wife looking down the moon hole. Like what did you expect?

* Paused the show cause LF just walked over to hug his wife and he's so about to throw her down the hole. 

* Ooooooo and he did it was sass too 

**Ep 8 - The Mountain and the Viper**

* Already can tell from the title Tyrion's trial by combat is happening this episode

* Felt bad for Ygritte, but now not so much. She and the Wildlings slaughter too many innocents.

* Oh Sansa how I hate you

* Ramsey is going to be twice as bad now that he's a Bolton 

* Love the genuine bonding of Jaime of Tyrion 

* Man I was so excited to find out why Orson was smashing those beetles and they just left me hanging

* Oberyn has Inigo Montoya written all over him. *You killed my ~~father~~ sister, prepare to die*

* Most gruesome death I've ever seen on a tv show. I've seen stuff on r/watchpeopledie more timid than that. Oberyn's a fool. 

* Bullshit that Tyrion is sentenced to death. They both died. 

**EP 9 - The Watchers on the Wall**

* There suddenly seems to be a lot more men of the Night's Watch

* Ya no shit you should have sealed the gate

* Attacked from both sides, they stand no chance 

* Badass Ygritte killed by the little boy they let go from the village. Have to admit that although I tried to front like I didn't like her anymore, I was pretty sad when she died.  

**Ep 10 - The Children**

* What the hell is Jon doing

* Should have just stayed behind the wall with Sam instead of going all Rambo

* Cersie has really gone over the edge. Can't believe she just told Tywin.

* *Lets dragons roam free, is surprised when they kill people*

* On the flip side, don't know if they'll be as obedient/trustful of her now that she locked them up 

* Now THIS is a fight to the death - ~~Except no one died... awkward~~ 

* I need to wait before I update, RIP Hound :( Interesting choice by Arya not to mercy kill him. 

* Please tell me Tyrion's not going back for Shae after Jaime just saved him. 

* .....................

* After the story about Tyrion's first love that was paid for, finding Shae in Tywin's bed, and then seeing that look in Tyrion's eyes...run Tywin run. 

* Thought Tyrion was going to chicken out again till he called her a whore. Is it weird that Shae's death shocked me more than Tywin's? 

* Hahahahahahahahahahahaha nooooo the Spider turning around and getting on the boat after the bells. His face is so done with everything.

-Four down. Third season is still my favorite, with this one now a close second. Glad Tywin was killed off, more for story progression rather than not liking him. Interested in seeing what becomes of Cersie and Jaime now that their father isn't there to hinder them. 

-Want to see more of Bran's storyline, although I did think that was the weakest one of this season. Didn't really feel anything when the other warg kid was killed, and never felt like him or his sister fit well. 

-With Osha gone, Arya has become my sole favorite. 

-Sticking with my prediction after Season 3 of Dany bringing her Dragon's from the South to attack Westeros, I think Stannis will take the Iron Throne first. That way Melisandre will be able to be killed off to one of the dragons since she loves fire so much. It just seems fitting (plus I still just don't like her). 

# Season 5 

**Ep 1 - The Wars to Come**

* Tyrion probably didn't even think about how guilty Jaime would feel toward's Tywins death. 

* Khaleesi is starting to become just as bad as the people shes persecuting 

* I can't be the only one who doesn't like Daarios and finds him creepy

* Oh yeah Dragons are pissed

* Jon showed his true leadership by shooting that arrow into Mance. 

**Ep 2 - The House of Black and White**

* What a useless coin

* Ayee Assassins Creed dude is back

* How the hell did Khaleesi think beheading him would be a good idea? 

**Ep 3 - High Sparrow**

* Margaery persuading Tommen to move Cersei out of Kings Landing happened way too soon. 

* Little Finger is the true villain in Game of Thrones

* Don't agree with Jon staying behind at the Wall

* Could have just hid the silver with the sword Arya

* Oh shit that lady just said the North remembers to Sansa. 

* If Jon cuts this dudes head off I'll be so happy -  :) Stannis looking on like a proud father, love it. 

* aaaaaaand Tyrion is prisoner again

**Ep 4 - Sons of the Harpy**

* Yeah didn't think Jaime was going to be fond of Tyrion anymore.

* Cersei just overstepped her bounds. Hopefully Margaery has the rage inside her that I think she's been hiding this whole time. 

* Oh Tommen you weak little King. 

* Jaw dropped when Melisandre said ""you know nothing Jon Snow"" 

* Jaime grabbing the sword with his metal hand hahahaha 

* Grey Worm :(

**Ep 5 - Kill the Boy**

* Ohhhh Grey Worm lives? - :)

* 

Random Crow: ""Less enemies for us"" 

 Stannis: ""Fewer."" 

Sir Devos: ""What?"" 

 Stannis: *licks teeth* ""Nothing."" hahahahahaha ~~has Stannis become my new favorite character?~~ -  Fuck Stannis.

* Can't imagine what'd be like looking at Sansa through Theon's eyes with how far he has fallen. Beyond degrading. 

* Can someone please kill Ramsey.

* Funny how Jon asks about his mother, but Ned refused to tell him about her. Ramsey doesn't care, yet Roose tells him the story voluntarily. 

* Melisandre looks at Jon like she's already read the rest of season 5's script and knows some juicy information. 

* Dude went from being on death row to Khaleesi's fiance in two seconds whaaaat

* Man Jorah can't catch a break

**Ep 6 - Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken**

* ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh so Jorah is Lord Commander's son. *Whoosh*

* He didn't know his father had died... Jorah really can't catch a break.

* ~~It's a trick Arya don't fall for it~~ No trick. Can't figure these faceless men out. 

* They managed to take goofy Lancel and make him a douche.

* Why do I keep getting surprised by all the sneaky shit Little Finger does. 

* Hahaha anytime Bronn comes on screen I know I'm in for a good time.

* Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck the Sparrows

* Every time Cersie smiles I just remember the first scenes from this season where she learns as a young girl that she'll be ""defeated"" by a much more beautiful young princess. Margaery may have been taken away, but I fully expect this season to end with Cersie's demise. 

* ""and how long have you loved him Miranda?"" DAMNNN Sansa with the burn. 

**Ep 7 - The Gift**

* Aw no Theon is going to tell Ramsey and they'll trick Brienne 

* I have a feeling whatever Sansa just grabbed off that barrel will be important later 

* KNEW IT. Melisandre just couldn't leave the little girl alone. 

* Hmmmmm thought having Ghost come save Sam was a little weak

* Loris and Margaery's mom is going to cut the heads off of everyone of those sparrows

* HAHA SUCKS TO SUCK CERSIE. KARMA'S A BITCH.

**Ep 8 - Hardhome**

* Jorah's story is a lesson everyone must learn at some point. Sometimes you mess up so badly that it can't be undone.

* Shit even I don't trust these ships the Wilidlings are getting on.

* Winter has come..

* These wights are intense AF its like they just snorted the world's best cocaine

* **WHAT?!** His sword didn't break!! Honestly thought it was going to be another shocking death. 

* ~~Giant is going to die 100%~~ - guess not

* Ice King gives no fucks. All that wildfire they used at Blackwater really could have come in handy now against this undead army. 

**Ep 9 - The Dance of Dragons**

* High hopes for this episode since I've noticed that the climax tends to happen in ep 9 with the resolution coming in ep 10, along with the lead in to next season. 

* okay what. everything just caught fire. 

* He may hate Snow, but at least he has honor and opened the gate.

* Sir Devos knows exactly what Stannis is doing. Hope he ""kidnaps"" the princess. 

* So the Dance of Dragons is a book the little girl is reading. She's going to die at the end of this episode huh :(

* Can't wait to find out what Bronn has to do - fair enough.

* Nononononononono stop girl you don't want to help your father 

* Out of all my predictions why is this the one that was right :(

* Oh ya now you try to save her...no sympathy for the mother. 

* ~~Feel like this is where we say goodbye to Jorah as well.~~ Literally the opposite happened.  

* I find it odd that the Sons of the Harpy kill the unsullied so easily. Maybe there are just that much more of them. 

* Only way she gets out of this is her Dragons. Although to be honest I care more about Jorah and Grey Worm's girlfriend than Khaleesi. 

* Thought Drogon was about to come wreck everyone. Turns out spears are effective against dragons. Pretty cool that she rode Drogon like all her ancestors did in the stories we hear about them, even though she did leave everyone behind with the Harpys.   

- On thought I had while watching was the idea of them talking about the Targaeryn battle where the siblings fought each other with their dragons. We saw the two that we chained up are hostile towards Khaleesi while the one that wasn't came to save her. Could there be another dragon battle later on? 

**Ep 10 - Mother's Mercy**

* Curios to see if the climax happens here, or if it was Dany riding away on Drogon.

* Oh half your men mutinied after you burn your little girl alive? Their princess? *shocking*

* Haaaaaa Stannis' world is falling apart now. Wife hangs herself, and Melisandre ditches him. 

* Ohhh Sansa grabbed a screw back in Ep 7

* So Brienne just stands all day watching that window. She's so dedicated.

* WOOOOOWWW and right when she leaves it's lit oh commmmeee onnnnnnnn

* Whoever played Stannis is amazing at acting. You can tell everything he is thinking just from the facial expressions portrayed, no words needed. When he sees the oncoming Bolton army on horses, then breathes out, looks away, and pulls his sword, you know every thought in his head. Every wrong step. What he did to his daughter. How he could have used those horses right now. But most importantly, it's the realization that its all over. It's the feeling of watching the clock hit zero in the championship game, only to see the confetti raining down is the color of your opponents. The thought that ""this can't be real, it wasn't supposed to go this way"" except it is real and it did go that way. In this moment, the man Sir Devos once knew has returned. He's realized his errors, and the only thing left to do is die fighting gloriously as King.  

* Damn he's still going

* ~~Whoa Brienne just found him what is happening hahaha~~ oops forgot about the whole Renly thing, probably should have seen this coming. 

* :/ reaaaaaalllllyyyy wish they killed Stannis off with that scene of Sansa watching the Bolton cavalry surround and collapse in on him. 

* AYYEEE Reek! Think he finally got the courage when Miranda mentioned Ramsey hurting Sansa's private parts. 

* Ummm did they just jump off a castle hahaha like how much has it snowed goddamn 

* Usually I look away when the gore factor just gets ridiculous but I thoroughly enjoyed watching every second of Arya assassinating Trant. 

* I knew Arya was in trouble when she said ""So you know who I am? I'm Arya Stark"" but  WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON WITH THESE MANY FACED PEOPLE?

* ~~Myrcella is going to die from that kiss. Calling it now.~~ Wow that took a turn I didn't expect. What an understanding daughter. 

* She did die! Posted that update right as she hugged Jaime. Leaving it crossed out though because I think it's cool how it shows how quickly GOT messes with your head. 

* So many Dothraki. Where did they even come from?

* High Sparrow just granted Cersie ""mother's mercy"" when we all know she's going to turn right around and get revenge on them all.

* Wow that image of Cersie on her hands and knees staring up at the high tower castles is powerful. Literal representation of how far she's fallen from power and grace. 

* Are you serious...............don't even know how to react. In the episode with the most updates, I'm left without words at the end.....who the fuck is even the main protagonist now. **SANSA?!**

-Ya the climax was **definitely** not Dany riding away on the Dragon. 

-Season 5 over. Started out a bit rough, found it harder than the other seasons to keep pressing ""next episode."" The final three episodes, however, could be argued as some of the best in the series up to this point. 

-Jon's death completely shocked me. When Ollie came into the room claiming they saw his uncle, I found it really odd. To me the uncle story line had died out long ago, and the fact it was even mentioned again struck me as weird. Like how would he even have survived? They saw no trace of him through multiple journeys beyond the wall. Then when his rival (still don't know the name) is too helpful with information I knew it was a trap, but I still didn't expect him to die. He see's the traitor sign and turns around to what I think is going to be a punch but then he gets Julius Ceaser'ed to death. Even has the line ""Ollie"" mirroring Ceaser saying ""Et tu, Brute?""



-Like Jon's death being symbolic, I think Miranda's was as well. It reminded me instantly of Vader throwing Darth Sidious over the railing to his death. In the same way, it showed Theon breaking free of Ramsey's control and reverting back to the person he once was, just like Vader does before he dies. 


-Predictions for Season 6: The Wildlings kill everyone at the wall after Sam escapes and tells the Red Haired dude what happened. Little Finger finally dies. The Boltons meet their ends. Cersie gets revenge on the Sparrows. A new king sits on the Iron Throne by the end. We finally see Dany and her army cross the Sea. Tyrion *doesn't* get taken captive.

-Bronn dethroned Arya as my favorite. I still miss Osha (._.) 

# Season 6

So here we are. The last season to catch up on, and the one that has been pretty unanimously described to me as the best one of the six. Seriously can't wait to see what is going to happen. 

**Ep 1 - The Red Woman**

* Ghost howling and trying to get to John :/

* Ollie is looking like a real smug little shit for somebody that skinny 

* Brienne is to sword fighting what Sharapova is to tennis. So much grunting. 

* Find yourself a Dornish woman to marry gentlemen 

* Maybe it's just an effect of always having proof nowadays, but man do a lot of people just take what people say as true at face value. 

* If I was Arya, losing my eye sight would only make me hate those who took it from me. I wouldn't be willing to learn anything form them. 

* Red woman takes robe off    ) 

   Red woman takes necklace off (_

**Ep 2 - Home**

* Hey look Bran is back after what, a season-long absence? 

* Hodor is named Willis and talks. Wonder what happened to him. 

* Ooooooh baby Sir Alliser is going to get it now

* Started of not liking Varys at all, but he's really grown on me. 

* These dragons are about to think Tyrion is a little bite-size slider

* HOLY SHIT [I CALLED IT.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/6fm5vi/everything_so_after_years_i_finally_just_finished/dj3gurf/) RAMSEY JUST WENT KYLO ON ROOSE. 

* With Balon's death, that takes care of the last person cursed by Melsiandre's leeches.

* Suggesting to bring back Jon from the dead like okay ya sure  _

* Okay what in the fuck. I guess Melisandre is going to turnout to be some demigod or something insanely powerful to justify what just happened.  


-On one hand, Jon being back alive is awesome. We get our main protagonist back, because lets be real, Sansa sure isn't going to be the one to regain the Starks' glory. On the other, however, I'm never a fan of anyone ever coming back from the dead, in any show. ~~Especially GOT, where death plays such an important rule and up to this point seemed absolute.~~ Forgot about the Brothers without Banners priest. 

**Ep 3 - Oathbreaker**

* There was Oathkeeper back in season 4, and now here's its counterpart. ~~Is this where we see the death of Brienne?~~ -Pretty sure she didn't even show up once in the episode hahaha 

* I'll admit it's going to be glorious watching Alliser's, and *especially* Ollie's, faces when they see Jon alive. 

* Hahahahahahaha Melisandre's face seeing Jon _ 

* Stabbing one of the greatest sword fighters in the back to win...shady.

* Bran's ~~""Ghost of Christmas Past""~~ ""The Giver"" storyline is starting to pick up? Now I at least want to know what's in that tower. 

* Really can't wait for Arya to beat TF out of the girl training her

* **NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO THEY BRING BACK OSHA ONLY TO GIVE HER TO RAMSEY?!**  (  

* At least she has Rickon their to act as a meat-shield for Ramsey's attention

* Awwwwwwww what they're hanging them all? Wanted to see some heads hit the ground.  

* Ollie's dead  () I can sleep well tonight. 


-So basically all storylines besides Mission Save Osha^^^^^and ^^^^^Rickon ^^^^^I ^^^^^guess... have been put on the back burner. If she dies I'm taking my talents down to ~~South Beach~~ team White Walker. 

-No Osha flair. Sad day.

**Ep 4 - Book of the Stranger** - 

* Yay we finally get a reunion of Starks

* It's crazy to think of how different the Stark's lives would be had Ned just refused Robert that day in Winterfell

* Still waiting for Robyn to fall through that moon door. 

* Hahaha okay Daarios has grown on me. Him secretly keeping the knife was great.

* DAMNN they've broken Loris big time. Margaery though does seem to be the force I thought she was. 

* The Lannisters will use the Tyrell army invading King Landing and killing the Sparrows against the Tyrells. Probably to oust them from Kings Landing. 

* **NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO**   (`) 

* **WHY'D THEY EVEN BRING BACK OSHA. ONE SCENE IS GIVING HER TO RAMSEY AND THE ONLY OTHER SCENE IS HER DYING**  _

* **YOU ALL KNEW THIS WAS COMING HOW COULD YOU**

* *Season 6 is the best season they said, you'll love it they said*

* Heeeeeeeeeyyyyyyyyyyyy so I know I said that whole ""I'm never a fan of anyone ever coming back from the dead, in any show"" thing but ya know this one time wouldn't be so bad....

* Yeah if a girl walked out of a flaming building that just roasted all my other leaders alive I'd for sure kneel too. 

-Watching this knowing Osha is dead is like watching the Office knowing Michael left for Holly.

-Top 5 Least Favorite Episodes So Far: 

1. S6 E4 - Book of the Stranger

2. S6 E4 - Book of the Stranger

3. S6 E4 - Book of the Stranger

4. S6 E4 - Book of the Stranger

5. S6 E4 - Book of the Stranger



**Ep 5 - The Door**

* Title of the episode I'm predicting is about Arya

* Wow go Sansa, look at her scolding Little Finger. Ironic how the person I viewed as one of the dumbest characters is the first to see Baelish for what he really is. 

* I just called Jaqen and the faceless men Assassins Creed dude at first as a joke but it's starting to become more and more realistic. 

* So the White Walkers were created by the Children of the forrest 

* D'awwwww Khaleesi with the feels towards Jorah. He finally caught a break! \ () /

* Whoa there are other Red Women

* ~~Wheeewww buddy Varys is going in on this chick. Love him calling her a fanatic.~~ Well she sure shut him up quick.  


* Can't get mad at Bran. I would have done the same exact thing. Although I probably would not walk through an army of zombies.  

* Really like the Three-Eyed Raven. Seems like all my favorite characters are the side characters (Osha, Bronn, Three-Eyed Raven). Arya is the only one that's not a side.

* She's talking to Hodor the way Sam talked to Frodo while waiting to die in the lava on Mount doom. Something bad is going to happppppppennnnnnn.

* Ohh fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck _

* Whatever that sound is, like a distant thump, whenever the White Walkers are seen is one of the little things I love. 

* Seemed like an unnecessary death for Summer. Is Ghost the last living dire wolf?

* Ohhhhhhh she's about to go all Will Smith in I Am Legend - damn and she took hundreds of stabs wounds with a smile on her face. 

* ( _ ) um WHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT

* So his own name this whole time refers to the moment he dies; that's pretty grim. Watching him look out into nothingness, all alone while staying loyal to the end was heartbreaking.


-What an amazing origin story for the name though. So Willis becomes Hodor because of Bran going back and warging into him. Which means at one point, the original Willis actually lived a normal and healthy life. Then the original Bran is born, grows up and goes through everything until he wargs into Willis for the first time, thus starting the infinite cycle. This is all assuming Willis still falls into the role Hodor plays, although if he was normal he most likely wouldn't be.

-The interesting concept is that although Bran thinks he is changing the past when he goes back, he is really just causing it. Which means he was always destined to be touched by the Night King, and Hodor was always destined to hold that door. 

**Ep 6 - Blood of My Blood**

* So after sleeping on it for a night, I wonder if Hodor made the connection between the day he had that seizure causing him to yell ""hold the door!"" with the moment of him dying, hearing Meera yell ""Hold the door!"" to him. 

* Wait Sam is actually wealthy? I thought he was from a little farm family and that his inheritance was nothing much. Not a huge castle.  

* Tommen is getting played so hard

* Sam stealing Heartsbane right now is the greatest thing ever. Standing up to his old man. 

* ~~Damn Ayra is going to have to watch her Lady crane die right in front of her huh?~~ Guess not. There's the Arya I knew before. 

*  She's going back for Needle!!! Awesome now time to go kill that chick who thinks she's so much better than her. 

* Oh yes please please please fuck these Sparrows up

* TOMMEN YOU FUCKING IDIOT. 

* Kicking out Jaime...wow he's completely brainwashed. 

* FULL GROWN DRAGONS! I'm interested in seeing if we get a Drogon vs the other 2 battle ~~since Tyrion might have won their affection~~ nah that's dumb.
 
**Ep 7 - The Broken Man**

* Only broken man I can think of is Theon. 

* Failed to mention it last episode but the flashback of Bran seeing Jaime kill the Mad King was great. I'd love to see more glimpses into stuff that happened before season 1. 

* **THE HOUND IS ALIVE!!** 

* ~~I remember the guy that saved the Hound but I can't remember from where~~ awkward..checked his filmography on imdb...remembered him from John Wick 2 that I watched the other night. 

* I still maintain that Margaery is just putting on an act this entire time.

* ""Does it move or talk?"" hahahahaha I love Lady Olenna 

* Just when I think maybe Margaery is really on the Sparrows side she hands Olenna a note. ()

* A rose? Wonder what the significance of that is. 

* ""I wonder if you're the worst person I ever met, at a certain age it's hard to recall."" I really don't think I've shown enough love to Lady Olenna, every time she appears on the screen the dialogue is golden. 

* Bronn is back ()

* Blackfish you badass  ( )

* Wow I got serious Catelyn vibes from Sansa walking into Lady Mormont's chambers

* 62 men um alright 

* Who wants House Glover anyways

* They're just going to stay there after they got threatened by the Brotherhood? Obviously at night they're going to get attacked.

* Wow really didn't think Arya was actually going to get hurt...idk how she gets out of this. Plus Jaqen said ""don't make her suffer"" and that bitch twisted the bladed inside Arya. 

* I thought the Brotherhood were good people. Oh well now the *true* Hound is back.  

**Ep 8 - No One**

* Title prediction makes me think we get more of Arya and the faceless men.  

* ~~Lady Crane is surely about to die~~ Oh nope just Arya

* ~~Noooo dont drink that Arya its Jaqen!~~ damn 0 for 2

* oh wowowoowowowowow that axe to the crotch sweet jesus 

* ""I choose violence"" Cersie, for this one moment, I love you. FUCK 'EM UP MOUNTAIN ('-')

* Ripped. The. Dude's. Head. Off. With. His. Bare. Hands. 

* Oooooo what's this rumor give us the details. Maybe Cersie has one last hope.

* Wow they actually listened to this dumbo and surrendered to the Lannisters  

* The ships with the flaming catapults are dope

* Oh the Brotherhood is executing the men. Guess they are good. 

* ""You're getting old Clegane."" | ""He's not."" *kick* hahaha 

* Why is Arya running I just want to see this girl with no name die so badly. 

* Oh my god that was so smart cutting out the candle. 

* ~(~) YESSSSSSSS seeing her face cut out and on the pillar was so satisfying (~)~

-So if I'm correct, Arya just became no one and then took on the role of herself?

**Ep 9 - Battle of the Bastards**

* Ramsey vs Jon *ding ding*

* Ummm I'm no military leader but shouldn't Drogon be out there roasting those ships?

* Do these idiots not realize how big Dragons can get

I just want to get it out there. (If it has been talked about before, please forgive me, and feel free to tell me so I could link the source at the top of my own thread here).

Now, this is pure speculation, with little evidence, but I think that Dany is going to die near the end of the series, and Jorah, the man who loves her most, is going to be the one to kill her. Hear me out:

Jorah contracted greyscale, which with enough time, turns men into monsters. Dany, in the show, sends Jorah off to find a cure. I think he is going to fail to find it, and in his last moments of humanity, will try to spend what little time he has left next to Dany. The scene of the two's departure had heavy romantic implications, so how tragic would it be, that Dany's death would be at the hands of a mad and bloodthirsty, greyscale stricken Jorah?

I think they'll be put into a room together, alone. It will be both sad and romantic, but it will end once the greyscale finally causes his mind to snap, and will cause him to kill her while she's grieving him, letting her guard down for just a moment.

Again, pure speculation, and I am fine admitting that it very well may not happen. I just think it would be an interesting and tragic way for one of the more beloved characters of the series to die.

On the surface it looks pretty straight forward that Shae betrayed Tyrion with the help of Tywin not only at the trial but also proved that her love for him was essentially not entirely real. 

For some reason it never sat right with me that Shae was essentially bought off by Tywin and in the end betrayed Tyrion because I think there's a lot more to it. I'm sure this subject has come up more than once with different theories and this is theory I came up with;

Shae never really betrayed Tyrion and Varys has been pulling the strings the entire time to get him out of King's Landing and put his skills to better use in Mereen. This is what I think really happened:

Lets start off with Tywin. More than once in the series Tywin is shown to have contempt for Tyrions lifestyle mainly towards his fondness for prostitution. Instances such as Tyrions first marriage and general conversations with him on the subject. Another instance not related to Tyrion is in S04E03 when Tywin walks in the brothel to offer Oberyn a position on the small council as well as being a judge at the trial. Tywin looks generally uncomfortable when he walks in. The point Im trying to make here is that I dont believe Shae and Tywin were sleeping together at all and Ill go even further as to say that he had no knowledge of Shae even being in his room while in the bathroom. Never once are they shown together at all and even when Tyrion confronts Tywin when he on the can its never mentioned that they were together. Tyrion mentions that he killed her and Tywin keeps calling her a whore but never once is it mentioned that they were together which would be more in line with his character depicted on the show. Come to think of it was Shaes body ever mentioned at all that she was found in Tywins bed? I dont remember Jaime, Cersei or anyone ever mentioning it which is very strange.

Next lets focus on Both Shae and Varys. Hes the only other person besides Tyrion or maybe Bronn that actually knew about Shae and Tyrion. Since day one Varys always saw Shae as a huge liability for Tyrion because he loved her which puts not only a big target on her but will also effect his judgement. Varys offers her a nice sum of money to leave Kings Landing which she flat out refused because she wanted to be with Tyrion. I really think Varys knew that there was no way to get her or Tyrion to leave without good reason. Even in S02E10 after the battle of the Blackwater, Shae wants them both to leave and take a boat to Pentos but Tyrion says that he likes ""playing the game"" and outsmarting everyone in Kings Landing. Tyrion also suggests that Shae will probably leave him to which Shae replies I am yours and you are mine. There was plenty of opportunities for her to leave him and take money but she stayed with him. Which brings me to my next question why would she pull a 180 and betray him for money? Throughout season 4 we do see that there is a lot of friction between them, jealousy mainly and Tyrion did tell her harshly that he never loved her and a boat as waiting for her to leave for Pentos (for her protection) however, the only people to know this was Tyrion, Bronn, and of course Varys. According to Bronn no one was following them when escorting her to the ship and assures him shes gone. The only person that knows about this is Varys and would be the only to intercept the ship or maybe have her never leave at all with an offer. The offer being that she testifies against Tyrion at his trial so that he is found guilty but also sacrificing herself to save Tyrion. Bear with me as this might sound like its a stretch however, I think it makes a lot of sense. I believe that both Varys and Shae know the only way for Tyrion to leave kings Landing for good is if he has nothing left for him to stay or hold him back. Basically the two major reasons being that he has no more Power or Place in Kings Landing and secondly Shae being the liability that poses to Tyrion. They both also testify against Tyrion at the trial (Shae making it look like she was paid by Tywin) and Varys (assuming hes doing so to protect his position). Varys testimony always confused me because there was no reason to make Tyrion out to be guiltier than what was already presented. Assuming Varys did so as to protect his position doesnt make much sense since he was already planning to leave for Mereen with Tyrion most likely. Finally, Varys had Shae sneak into Tywins room while he was in the bathroom (I think he may have been poisoned) and also had Jaime break his brother out of prison. Varys, knowing that Tyrion would see his father one last time before he left would essentially see Shae and feel that there is nothing left for him in Kings Landing.  


Like I said its just a theory and maybe Im looking way too much into it. Let me know what you guys think.

I've listed some thoughts below, please feel free to discuss and add more.

Aerys II Targaryen (aka The Mad King) : inspired by Roman Emperor Nero

Whitewalkers led by Night's King : inspired by either Mongols led by Genghis Khan or Huns led by Attila

Wildfire : inspired by Greek fire, used by the Byzantine empire 

House Lannister : inspired by the British House of Lancaster (i think this one is pretty obvious, even their sigils are almost the same)

I have been a huge fan of the show since season 2 (have not read ASOIAF...YET. I stayed away to avoid spoilers and admittedly have no excuses for not doing so since we're past the books at this point and ive spoiled everything along the way anyhow).

I am not certain this is common amongst enthusiasts but i rewatch the series every year prior to the new episodes. 
As with every year, I instantly fell back in love.
Not sure if its just been too long this offseason or the developments last year brought it all together to prepare us for the end but i feel more at home in the seven kingdoms than ever before.
Even after so many watches i cant help but be amazed by the quality, as well as the fact there are people who still don't watch this story religiously.
Even the smallest details (a close zoom of jamies right hand shaking Jon's in 102 is eerie) are outright fascinating. 
The big picture is obvious from the opening shot. Easter eggs and foreshadowing are in almost every scene. Emotional moments hit hard again and again.
Writing, direction, cinematography, wardrobe and set design have all been top notch since day one and only gotten better. The actors truly have had the opportunity to flesh out these characters and almost all of the cast impresses me at every turn as their stories expand and take turns for the worse.
I have no point here other than i love this show and i needed to share. 
I want to thank all associated and my former brother-in-law for opening my eyes!! 
This is easily the greatest series ever made (RIP too early Deadwood) and will likely stay on top for the foreseeable future. 
Sry for the length and rambling but i have no one near me (why does it have to be like this) who appreciates this show. I needed a safe space to share my feelings.
Please share yours, until then ill be watching Jon arrive at the wall and be holding back my tears throughout ",17,13,False,spoiler,,,,,

Yes she made quite a number of kills (made significant because how young she is) but she didn't do it because she enjoys killing people.. she did it to avenge her loved ones and in her mind that was justice.


When she was with the hound he was about to kill innocent people in more than one occassion and she argued with him and stopped him.


When she was assigned targets to assassinate she didn't blindly follow through.. on the contrary she risked herself by stopping an assassination she believed not warranted.


If a person is bloodthirsty and a killing machine they wouldn't stop.


Also, the number of kills Arya made is much lower than many other major characters in the show and none of them is called a bloodthirsty killing machine!


So Arya kills for revenge and get dubbed thus.. but when Tyrion kills his own father for revenge over his whore lover no one bats an eyelash!


Why is revenge is acceptable for one person and not the other?

I do NOT want this to be how the series ends i do not want this to be how it ends at all but as a writer and a theorist you must always have a worst case Scenario planned out for...Well...The Worst case Scenario and that worst case Scenario is Jon and Daenerys becoming enemies at the end. Now in my opinion i think it would be very out of character, out of place, and a copout if they became enemies but if this does happen there is a way it can go down while still fitting with the tone of the story.

One of my friends on reddit named JackStargaryen stated it could be a disagreement over the others Jon believing peace can be made and Daenerys's wanting to destroy them and of course Jon seeing Daenerys burn KL with Citizens still in it. While this is interesting i don't really see burning citizens unless it was accidental of course. But i think Jon will want to make peace or try before they attack them i also think there will be a disagreement over what the fate of Gendry would be. If Jon finds out he was with Arya he will want to spare him but Daenerys will want to do something to him for Roberts Rebellion.

(it is also possible that Daenerys mistakes Arya for a assassin if Arya sneaks to Dragonstone and Dany kills her) Jon will then leave to try and make peace it could be revealed the Night king is the true threat as he is as mad as the mad king was and the others are his slaves. Jon could combat him and become the new night king and King beyond the wall with the wights collapsing. Then there will be war between Jon and Dany but i think it will be in the same way of captain America: Civil War where in that film you could understand boths sides reasons. I think they should make it where you can understand both sides and switch who you root for through out the think.

Like i said though i DO NOT think they should be enemies at the end i think it will end with them teaming up to fight the others but at the same time i do not think they will marry and i also think the ending of book and show will be bittersweet. ",35,8,False,spoiler,,,,,

and have been noticing a lot of what i'd say to be really prevalent theming regarding the monarchy, nobility, and general power structure of Westeros. and more importantly, how outdated, and almost UNNECESSARY it might actually be.

My big question is, after all is said and done, will the Monarchy and nobility of Westeros be completely restructured? or potentially even abolished?



there's a lot of small moments pointing towards major characters and the series composition itself moving to criticise the established order in Westeros and an implied desire to utterly uproot it.

For instance, the Kingsroad incident with Arya, Micah and Joffrey.

1. Arya's the only one we really see in both books and tv really interacting with people far 'below her station' and having no ulterior motive for doing so.  

2. Arya's behavior as a whole is deemed somewhat unbefitting of nobility at all times,

3. Micah (the Butcher's boy) is then made to seem utterly expendable and without value in the eyes of the nobility.

in short,  Nobles who show disdain for 'lesser people' are 'good nobles'.

Now this is concrete world-building at the stage that it happened in the story. but it may have a more interesting significance soon enough. I'll leave that thread hanging for now, and tie it in later.



there's also a quote from Jorah Mormont when addressing Dany, that the common folk don't give a damn who sits on the iron throne, their only concern is that years crops etc.

It's an accurate observation, reinforced later when the Hound and Arya find that injured peasant farmer,  Arya gives her name, and the farmer clearly has no knowledge of the significance of her last name.

finally, Daenerys, in the most direct example, talks about 'breaking the wheel' potentially breaking the chain of houses trying to rise above one another, essentially breaking the purpose and ambitional aspects of Westeros' nobility.



To tie it all together at last.
the Characters who generally were fine, heavily rewarded or complacent, or particularly those who have been trying to uphold the status quo within the established system have been dropping like flies. Tywin, Joffrey, the Freys, Boltons, Viserys,  Robb Stark, Catelyn Stark, all the damn Baratheons etc.

and the characters that have broken the mold,  the 'nobles unfit to be nobles'  are now at the forefront of all plotlines,  the Dwarf who serves as Hand of the King, the wild girl who was comfortable amongst peasants, the Bastard king, the Woman or Eunuch who stand to rule the Iron Islands, the paramour and her three bastard daughters, an old woman who only desires vengeance, the first ruling queen in Westeros' history who literally blew up the established religion,   the conquering would be queen who has literally stated her ambition to be 'to break the wheel'  
with the exception of Sansa and Peter Baelish, all of our current major political players conform to this more anachronistic theming.

my speculation is that No-one will be sitting on the Iron Throne come the end of the series, (And No, I don't mean it in the 'HARDY HAR, ARYA JOKE!' way.  I think the Iron Throne will cease to exist by the end of the series.

But a deeper study of bloodlines and laws of Westeros would dispute that. More specifically, the laws of Westeros make it almost impossible for a woman to inherit the throne. 


Let's get the issue of *legitimate* succession clarified first. Note that when talking about the legitimate succession, we are ignoring the obvious use of ""bigger army diplomacy"". Ofcourse, we are not sure how well the laws of Westeros are clarified on the subject, but it does seem to be somewhat modeled after the real-world rules of inheritance - so we'll start there. 


**Male-Preference Primogeniture** - This seems to be the law of the land as far as most of the Lords are concerned. Sons come before daughters, but a lord's children come before his siblings. Using house Tully as an example and assuming Edmure had both a son and a daughter, the line of succession would look like this: Hoster Tully, Edmure, Edmure's Son, Edmure's Daughter, Catelyn, Robb, Bran, Rickon, Sansa, Arya, Lysa, Robyn Arryn, Blackfish. 


**Modified Male-Preference Primogeniture** - Unlike the rest of the land, the crown uses this algorithm to figure out the line of succession - a rule retroactively established after the Dance of Dragons. This puts all the possible female heirs behind all the male ones. Only when the male heirs are exhausted do they consider female ones. Basically, if this was applied to House Tully the line of succession would look like this: Hoster Tully, Edmure, Edmure's son, Robb, Bran, Rickon, Robyn Arryn, Blackfish, Edmure's Daughter, Catelyn, Sansa, Arya, Lysa. 


Based on this, a recent picture of the line of Royal succession would look something like this (assuming bastards were legitimate): 

Aerys Targaryen, Rhaegar, Aegon VI, Jon (if Legit), Viserys, Robert, Gendry (if legit), Joffrey, Tommen, Stannis, Renly, Rhaenys (Rhaegar's daughter), Danaerys, Rhaella (Aerys' sister-wife), Myrcella, Shireen. 

Basically, due to being a woman, Danaerys is automatically behind Robert and Stannis in the line of succession, despite being more Targaryen than they are. **This line of succession is borne out by the show. In a conversation between Renly and Loras, the line of succession says Joffrey, Tommen and Stannis are ahead of Renly, but makes no mention of Myrcella. Similarly, Sansa says to Septa Mordane that if she gave Joffrey only daughters, the crown would go to Tommen.**


So what does this have to do with Cersei? Here it is...


Robert may have jumped the line using bigger army diplomacy, but he still derives his legitimacy through the Targaryen bloodline. He just acts as if the Targaryen heirs ahead of him are already dead (and would love to have it so). That's why the idea of Danaerys having a son so terrified him. Dany, if she'd come earlier, would've followed the same logic. Despite being behind many others in the line of succession, she'd have simply declared them effectively dead - and made that a reality using ""bigger army diplomacy"". The laws of Westeros governing the rules of inheritance have remained the same despite the the apparent change in regime. 


This means that even if the Baratheons are regarded as the ruling family, the laws of royal inheritance mean that Cersei still isn't the legitmate ruler. Even if you regard Jamie as KG and thus out of succession. Even if you regard Tyrion as sentenced to die and therefore, out of succession. Jamie spoke of having cousins to Tywin and even though he only named Lancel Lannister, he implied that there were others still whose names he'd forgotten. Well, those forgotten ones would be ahead of Cersei for the Royal throne, even if they are behind her for Casterly Rock. 


However, the Baratheons aren't the ruling family. Its still the Targaryen blood that rules - current generation of Baratheons simply happened to have some. The next legitimate ruler in line would need to be related to the Targaryens in some way. 


So who is the legitimate ruler? Now, Dany is in exile and thus regarded as out of line of succession. No one knows anything about Jon and Gendry is still a bastard. Let's disregard them all for now. The Targaryens didn't marry outside their family very often, so its hard to figure out if there are any survivors still in Westeros. We know that a Martell married a Targaryen once before, but on the show, that line is apparently dead. There are Velaryons who married Targaryens most frequently and in the books, there is a surviving Velaryon who'd be regarded as the rightful king - but there has been no mention of the character or the Velaryons in general on the show. 


The only other house I can recall having a few Targaryen marriages would be House Arryn. That's right - assuming the family tree bears me out, it might just turn out that sweet, spoiled and sickly Robyn Arryn is the legitimate heir to the Iron Throne and Cersei is just an usurper using a bigger army to take what she wants.

The main reason is that Bran's visions and green seeing is always around Jon and focus on him only. So he is the key person to win the war as Bran and the earlier three eyed Raven thinks.  
Jon is the only person (along with few fellows) knows what is coming and trying to unite all the men.  
From the first season itself it clearly indicates he is the odd one out  on all cases, which made him to have no selfish goals, like interest in throne or happy drinking life..etc  
He knows the value of life, he never enjoyed killing even though he is good at it. Against the wild lings or against Ramsey, he tried his best to prevent the life losses. (This is the way exactly Raeghar did  told by Barrastion Selmy to Dany ""He never enjoyed killing or war""  ).  
The only thing I strongly believe why he is the prince promised is that the three eyed Raven. He is the only person knows how the War is gonna be and how to end the war. Why he always focus his green seeing on one person rather than all other men. Is Bran preparing for the final war ever since the Tower of Joy (We know clearly he can control people's mind by going to the past).

The tension of the ships approaching in the night, drums blaring, the look into the tactical side of the battle with Tyrion's wildfire plan, and the desperation of Stannis as he sends good men in on foot as a last resort. Even the scenes with Cersei in the red keep really paint a grim picture of the war.

And I just wanna share my favourite scenes and I wanna hear your guys' faves too.

3rd favourite scene: Ramsay Bolton gets eaten by his dogs. I love this scene so much because for a long time we always wanted Ramsay to die. I mean, he tortured poor Then and raped Sansa. His death was incredibly satisfying.
2nd favourite scene: Daenerys survives the fire and her dragons are born. I love this scene so much, it's basically her awakening. How she survived a fire and made the people bow down to her was awesome. Very very badass.
My favourite scene: Lyanna, Ned, Bran and baby Jon Snow. This was undoubtedly my favourite scene. Everything about it is perfect, the execution, the music, acting, etc. The moment that made me love it was the jump to baby Jon to DAKINGDANORTH. It shows how much he progressed through the series, being the brooding bastard of Ned Stark to the leader, damaged, white walker slaying (who had a standoff with fucking Night King), great warrior who was now the Son of Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen.

S1E3 - This is the first time the Jorah talks with Rakharo about their weapons and armor. Rokharo says his father taught him that speed defeats size.

S4E8 - Mountain and the Viper, a literal demonstration of speed vs size. Size wins.

S5E9 - At the fighting pits Daario and Hizdahr debate about it again. Daario says as a smaller more agile man he was happy to see a large opponent. Hizdahr says in all the fights he has seen size wins more often than not. In the fight they are watching, the larger man wins.

Can anyone think of other times this has been discussed or come into play?

Implications

Dothraki - Maybe the Dothraki don't fare well against Westerosi armies. The only instance we can judge from is when Jorah kills a couple Dothraki on mission save Dany.

Arya - Arya vs the Hound? Arya vs anyone of size? She is the only character I can think of that is clearly small and agile.

Sand Snakes - Good god I hope the Mountain slaughters them

In some ways, it sounds like she got incredibly lucky. 

In the beginning, IIRC, Cersei was worried that Jon Arryn knew about her secret and might've told someone. The implication being that that was why she had him poisoned. But she didn't. So was there a plan in place for dealing with him or was she just lucky that someone else acted first?


Later, Ned tells her that he knows the secret and is going to tell Robert once he gets back from the hunt. So Cersei arranges for Lancel to give Robert lots of potent wine which ends with the boar killing him. But how did she arrange that? IIRC, Robert was already on the hunt by then. Did she send the wine and the message to Lancel hoping that it won't be intercepted? Did Lancel always carry strong wine with him just waiting for a signal from Cersei? Or had she planned Robert's death before he left for the hunt, anticipating that Ned knew and that Robert must not return? 


So, she ensures that Robert gets drunk - doesn't mean he'd necessarily die. He still had Renly and Selmy with him. What was supposed to happen if the boar hadn't killed him? Was Lancel supposed to shoot him with an arrow? Or arrange for him to fall of the horse and break his neck? Or put a sword through his back? Was he expected to do that with the king's brother and kingsguard right there and get away with it? He is a poor, scared squire pouring wine, not a Faceless Man. The chances of the ""assassination"" succeeding here seem really, really low. Not a good plan - unless there is more to it?


And now that Robert was dead by a stroke of luck, did Cersei have a plan beyond crowning Joffrey king? She had a contingent of Lannister guards backing her up, but all the other forces in the capital were up for grabs. Renly might've decided to be honorable and support Ned Stark. LF might've decided that supporting Ned creates just as much chaos and swayed the City Guard to his side. It certainly doesn't seem like Cersei was the one to approach LF and tell him to betray Ned. Was there a plan in place to handle this turn of events? Would she have delayed the coronation until sh was sure she had the men to back it up? 


Yes, I'm aware that Cersei isn't as smart as she thinks she is. No doubt, she regards these turns of events as the result of her ingenious and masterful planning. But from what I can see, she got incredibly lucky every step of the way, especially with having LF covering for her. But she didn't know that he was covering for her - so did she really expect all her half-assed plans to go flawlessly or had she actually made any backup plans that we didn't get to see?

Maybe its because it doesn't seem to be where her path lies, but if she had a chance, I think Arya might end up being a great player. 


Sure, she is young, impulsive and brash and doesn't always see the big picture, but unlike Sansa, she has shown great instincts. She distrusted the Queen and Joffrey pretty much from the start and continues to distrust people even through her journey. In the books, telling Roose Bolton of her identity might've seemed like a good option, given that he was Robb's bannerman, but knowing what we know now, it'd have been a terrible mistake. She also seems to understand when to stand up for herself (when you have a big, bad Hound backing you up), when to bow down (serving Tywin) and when to get the hell out of dodge (after she was left with the Mountain). 


Apart from being a good judge of character, she also seems good at lying. She can come up with some pretty convincing lies on the spot - unlike her sister. (C'mon, does anyone ever really buy her ""I'm loyal to Joffrey, my one true love"" line?). Yes, there are occasional risks involved - like in lying to Tywin - but for those less observant her lies seem to work flawlessly. 


So that's a good judge of character, good at reading the situation and good at lying - 3 significant qualities that make for a great player in the game of thrones. With a little bit of maturity, experience and putting down roots, she might end up becoming as dangerous as Varys or LF. Thoughts?",220,733,False,spoiler,,,,,
986,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2017-6-9,2017,6,9,20,6g7t73,self.gameofthrones,[EVERYTHING] We need to talk about Gendry,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/6g7t73/everything_we_need_to_talk_about_gendry/,regardingwestworld,1497007520,"Bringing up Gendry (again) on this board is just asking for punishment. Envisioning anything more than a peripheral role for him in the story tends to touch a few nerves. People feel very strongly about the respective houses and when you suggest anything that hasn't been stone-wall signposted in the books you have those who know their books stuff to deal with. I'm a show fan, so my opinions are based solely on the show, and any clues I can scavenge there. With that in mind I'll propose this much... Gendry could well be the legitimate heir of Robert Baratheon and Cersei Lannister. I know this theory isn't new and hasn't been completely discounted but it doesn't carry much favour, there are however a few factors worth taking into consideration. 

1. *Black haired boy* - Way back in the first few episodes of the first season are two conversations. The first was when Cersei told Catelyn Stark of losing her child. Her first-born. She comes across sincere which could be genuine or evidence of a well rehearsed routine. She then brought up the same lost child to her husband not long before his death. ""Even after we lost our first boy. For quite a while, actually. Was it ever possible for us? Was there ever a time, ever a moment?"" (The Wolf and the Lion). It's established they had a son before Joffrey and that he died. 

2. *But Maggy said?* - Yes Maggy predicted Cersei would have 3 children and that Robert would have many, so that should be a bullet in the discussion right there, but by only recognising her children by Jamie Cersei upholds the prophecy, now as confusing on her end as it is on his, it's possible her decision to disregard her first-born. She had her first child, yet Maggy told her she would have 3. We know she had 4. We know the first has a back-story of 'death as a shroud' yet this child isn't acknowledged in the prophecy. 

3. *Row, Row, Row* - Why remove Gendry from the narrative for so long if he yet has a meaningful role to play in the story? You've got me there, Gendry was a 'proxy Jon' plot device for long enough. A way by which Ned's subtext could be explored without revealing anything. A fact which we've only seen properly upheld now, six years later. Jon is, like Gendry was, in danger of being hunted down, and when Gendry had touched base with Arya and Davos he was shipped off to the land of memes, but there's every indication he will return.

4. *Daddy Davos* - One of the most genuine relationships we've seen to date was that of Davos and Shireen Baratheon, she taught him how to read and he was her friend. When she was burned we expected a reckoning for Melisandre, which may yet come, but it's left a hole in Davos' life. His leadership cost his son his life, and now he's lost someone who was like a daughter to him. He knows Gendry, he saved his life, and when the game has played itself out I wouldn't be surprised if the two fleabottom boys find themselves back in Kings Landing together.

5. *Why now?* - Gendry needed to get gone for long enough to become even a fraction of Robert Baratheon then he might be useful come this endgame, and he can forge, again, another skill which has measurable value as all eyes turn to the North. Most importantly though, Cersei has lost all her children. If she where to acknowledge another child, now would be the only time she would consider it. And it separates her further from Jamie, Gendry is not his son. Whether it's just mentioned, or she literally looks for him, I wouldn't be surprised if this is how Gendry is legitimised, and why his return is now. Tie in Arya and her final destination meeting setting it's sights on Cersei, it all should make for a gloriously bitter-sweet bust-up and all bets are off, though I'd be surprised if Jamie didn't live to redeem another Day, having finally seen to balancing the scale of what happened at the end of the first episode.

6. *Anything else you lunatic?* - Yes, the reason for all this... Gendry would then be an ideal suitor for Dany to marry. Davos knows who he is, as does Mel, either would vouch for him, but the added weight of legitimization through Cersei's grief would actually make Gendry the most logical choice for husband material. If a story that starts with Robert hunting down Dany and her unborn child, like he hunted down Dany as a child and was the reason Jon Snow lived his life in northern exile, if that story can 'break the wheel' and find a conclusion that see's Dany unite with not only the child of a Baratheon, but a Lannister too, then it would be exactly the anti-arrangement we should be expecting from a story this thoughtful and complex. 

Go on then, destroy it. I know it has practically no chance of coming to fruition, that's the thing about theory cracking though...

Now you will probably leave this thinking I just want fan service though hear me out. I Believe that next season that Daenerys and Jon will be allies but not for too long as Jon will see via Bran that maybe the others can be reasoned with however Daenerys wants to burn them all before they destroy her kingdom. Also Jon will be shocked from seeing Daenerys dragons burn soldiers and innocent people (accidentally in the innocent people's case by the way) and also Daenerys will want to kill Gendry for what Robert did but if Jon finds out that Gendry was with Arya he will not want him dead.

The wall will go down and Jon will meet with the night king where it is revealed the Night king is the only one who is truly corrupt and the other white walkers are basically forced under his rule. Jon challenges the night king one on one and Jon wins the wights collapse and he is made the new night king and with help from Bran controls the others. Meanwhile with Dany losing her a important ally, Most of her other allies (Missendei, Grey Worm, Olenna, Yara, Half the Dothraki, and her most beloved Dragon Drogon dead and Tyrion and Varys switching to team Jon), and the fact she has her father's blood Daenerys will go mad and imprison Arya and Gendry and also hangs Brienne and Pod.

In which Jon is the PTWP while Daenerys is Azor Ahai the true villain of the story and Jon will have to sacrifice his love Sansa to forge Lightbringer. Now I will not get into why Jon will get the throne:

- First I'll establish Jon does not want the throne if he was offered it but Jon has always been forced into positions of leadership and he has always been the best leader so if anyone leads the seven kingdoms it is him.

- Jon is the most honorable man in Westeros next to Ned.

- He has Targaryen blood

- It would fit the story and be bittersweet that Jon does not want the throne but he is forced into due to high demand and he will take it as it is his duty. Also that George I think is trying to tell us that people who do not want to rule and are not even in any league to rule (like a bastard) are the best rulers.

So to recap Jon is the PTWP and the song of ice and fire and will have to Sacrifice his love Sansa to forge Lightbringer not from fire but from ice and Challenge with his army of the north, The Vale, The Riverlands, The Neck, Clansmen of the Vale, The BWB, Wildlings, Ironborn (who have changed sides), and White walkers will combat R'hollor and his campion Azor Ahai and her Dragons and when all is set and done he will be offered the throne but declines it at first but due to high demand and that it is his duty he will take it and rule but never have children. However Arya and Gendry's child would rule after he passes.  ",10,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Anyways here's some thoughts, would be interested to hear what other people think of these events.

S1E1: Hearing Jaime and Cersei talk about Jon Arryn's death while knowing how he actually died. So interesting to think that though we're meant to believe at that time that the twins had something to do with his murder, they were in reality just as clueless as we were/are. I wonder what Cersei would think if she ever found out what actually happened to the King's Hand.

S1E9: If you pay attention  you can see that Cersei is just as shocked as everyone else by Joffrey's decision to have Eddard beheaded. Clearly this was not the outcome she expected but the love she has for her son overrides any sort of political self-preservation she might otherwise feel. She chooses to defend his actions rather than try to curb his journey into maniacal power.

S1E10: I still just do not get why Jorah carried Dany into the tent while Mirri Maz Duur was performing blood magic. Surely he's seen enough in his life to know that if there's dark clouds and demonic sounds coming from a tent, you do not carry your pregnant queen in there. And had none of the other women ever given birth? Sure they may not be midwives but I'm sure they could've kept Dany safe until the morning. I guess in the moment though we all make bad decisions, he meant well...

Also, just how mind-blowing would it be to wake up and see a women who walked into a raging bonfire stand up without a scratch on her? It makes sense why people follow Dany the way they do when there's stories like that about her.

S2E9: Really enjoy some of the slow moments in this episode. All of the dialogue between Sansa and Cersei is really interesting and man your heart just goes out to poor Sansa. She's so confused and terrified and while in retrospect perhaps going with the hound would have been the best choice in her situation, really nothing ever would have turned out good for her. She's not as tough as Arya and I don't think she would have fared well on the road with the Hound. Eventually she probably would have found herself in a situation where her life is at danger and the Hound has to sacrifice himself to save her. Maybe she would have risen to the occasion, but ultimately I believe that through her time with Littlefinger and her own trials she finds a different kind of strength that better suits her. Still, what a terrible choice she had to make, I can't imagine how she must've felt wanting to flee but having this out standing right in front of you.

Also, Cersei and Shae. Wow. Like Cersei sees right through Shae and was just starting to play a game with her, too bad they got interrupted. Would have loved to see how that could have gone.

The conversation between Bronn and The Hound is so great. Like I'm sad that the Hound just wants to kill him so badly, I guess he sees Bronn as a bit of a blowhard and doesn't realize what a great fighter he truly is. I love that Bronn just wants to be friends and even saves The Hound's life later with no thanks.

S3E5: Hearing Ygritte say she doesn't want to leave the cave is just so heartbreaking. You can really tell she exists between two worlds. She loves Jon but she's also loyal to the Free Folk and to herself. The betrayal that eventually comes from Jon choosing the Crows over her really make their time inside the cave so bittersweet.

I don't know if I've just watched these episodes enough times or if the revelations from S6 give more context but the conversation between Beric and Thoros carries so much more weight. I believe on my first watch through I really was on Arya's side in wanting her father back. But after seeing Jon come back and say that if he dies again to leave him dead, I wonder if Ned dying the way he did was perhaps for the best. I don't believe he would have wanted to come back.

S4E1: Seeing Ice melted down still hurts. It's like the final goodbye to Eddard. Especially when Tywin burns the wolf pelt. Good to have Jaime ""back"" but it was too late for Cersei. ""You took too long"" I think the first time I saw this it was like ""ugh, Cersei, nothing is ever good enough for you!"" but this time I kind of understood. She's been alone in the capital worried sick and of course over time feelings can change. We like to think that true love is forever, but humans are fickle. Even star-crossed lover twins can fall out of love. 

S4E2: I love Bronn so freaking much. He's just says all the right things at the right times. You can tell Jaime is so not ready to be humbled like this but Bronn isn't pulling any punches. Also, who doesn't want to learn to sword fight by the ocean after watching this?

I really tried this time to place myself on Shae's side and it has really changed how I see some of these conversations. I definitely feel sorry for her as Tyrion breaks up with her and her later actions make more sense to me now. 

I think one thing that's really helpful is to not think ""what would I have done differently"" when watching GoT which is something I really had a hard time not doing my first few watch throughs. I never understood Shae because it's easy for me to see why Tyrion does what he does. But these are all flawed characters and they don't have the benefit of seeing things from the outside and being able to judge things that way. They make poor decisions and they pay dearly for them. Sure, it would have been great if Shae could see that Tyrion did love her but he didn't want to see her hanged and he knew that would happen eventually if she stuck around. It would be wonderful if Rob could understand that even though he's just a teenager, he's being expected to make adult decisions and sacrifices and that maybe killing Rikard Karstark and backing out of his marriage to the Frey girl aren't the best decisions mid-war. 

Seeing Joffrey die though is always good. Mmmm... poison wine...


Anyways, just some random thoughts I had while watching. If I got something in the wrong episode, apologies. I've been watching on my iPad while working so I haven't been paying 100% attention. Still have a few more episodes to go and am really so freaking excited for Season 7.

Ask yourself, is their anything I wouldn't do to stop that from happening? The hounds will find the scent again, I'll beat them until they do, I'll whip every man here until I have both those boys in hand.

To me, this says a lot, not only is it referencing what will happen in the future (being a eunuch, and not being seen as a worthy Greyjoy) it is also a sense that Ramsey does just about everything to Theon that he says in this monologue.

My guess is that during Season 7, Gendry will meet with Samwell Tarly. Sam, who is already at the Citadel, studying a million books, will eventually discover the mystery of forging a Valyrian Steel sword. Along with Gendry, who is a blacksmith, subsequently aware of the procedure forging a sword, they will try to forge a VS sword. Bear in mind that Valyrian Steel is being forged by using magic and spells.
So, a presumable lost bastard and a fat guy, rejected by the vast majority of Westeros society (father included), will forge a sword which will be handed over to the hands of the hero, who will save Westeros from darkness. Lightbringer.

EDIT : ADDITIONAL INFO

Earlier today i read some additional facts that could support this theory. Gendry, while in King's Landing, was an apprentice to master blacksmith Tobho Mott, who reforged the Valyrian greatsword Ice to Oathkeeper and Widow's Wail. He is by far the best (and most expensive) blacksmith in King's Landing and he's one of the few blacksmiths of Westeros that can craft armor and swords using Valyrian Steel. He came to King's Landing from the Free City of Qohor, a place famous for its skilled blacksmiths, who possess the rare knowledge of reforging Valyrian Steel. So, Gendry being an apprentice to such a skillful blacksmith, with such a rare knowledge being presented in front of him, most probably points to the same direction as the theory mentioned above.

But first I apologize for the redundancy if this has been brought up before. I'm trying to make connections between valyrian steel and Azor ahai's burning sword. In the book, Sam told Jon that beside dragon glass, white walker can also be killed by dragon steel which is valyrian steel that was used by the hero of the long night. And most of us know about the legend of azor ahai's burning sword. So, my theory is this, valyrian steel will be enhanced by fire, especially by dragon fire. In other word, burning the valyrian steel sword will not only enhance it but also make it stronger and unbreakable. For instance, take a look of the duel between the hound and berric, one of the reason why berric lost is because he put flame onto his sword, mimicking azor ahai, thus making his sword easier to break. I believe the valyrian steel sword is the exact opposite. It will become stronger by the presence of fire. So therefore I think that's the connection between valyrian steel and azor ahai's burning sword. What do you guys think?",10,8,False,spoiler,,,,,

So I'm rewatching season 6 to refresh my mind for upcoming season 7. During episode 2 tyrion meets the dragons. So he decides to go touch and free rhaegal of his chains first.
I feel like this is significant because he recalls and speaks out loud of his childhood dream to get a dragon for his birthday (I believe). He then touches rhaegal. After freeing him of his chains he turns around and viserion is in his face w that ""let me go bro"" body language... to which he does.
Ok so my theory. Tyrion chose rhaegal to be the dragon he wants to be his pet. Rhaegal obviously appreciates and had a quick connection with tyrion. Also, viserion, at the very beginning of the scene, ""turned the safety off"" and almost torched tyrion but didn't actually pull the trigger and eat him for dinner.
I see significance in this scene. Tyrion got along with rhaegal who is a green dragon. Viserion, white/creme and gold, almost killed him but didn't. I see potential foreshadowing. Jon snow, the king in the north could match into the color sceme and behavior of viserion and his reaction towards tyrion. 1) jon could possibly get very angry with and want to kill tyrion at first glance because hes a lannister and could still possibly believe he was involved in the crippling/attempted murder of Bran in season 1. 2) Even though the king in the north has a basic pewter/steel/iron crown, royalty is generally portrayed with gold. And 3) Jon snow can be portrayed with the color white/creme.
This could even further support the theory than Jon could eventually become king of the seven kingdoms to rule alongside danaerys with tyrion as hand. 3 heads of the dragon.
Iv been a lurker on this sub for a long time and have been right on most of my predictions so far but wanted to share this with you guys because I haven't seen this theory brought up in this sub with this episode as evidence.
For those interested. S6E2 scene starts at approximately 26:13. Can't wait for season 7.",8,9,False,spoiler,,,,,

When Ros and the random whore are trying out for Lord Baelish's establishment, she asks him to join them. He then says he is promised to another. Ros says something along the lines of, ""she must be beautiful"" and then he says ""Not really, impeccable blood lines though."" He then goes on to tell the story of what we now know is him losing to Ned's brother in a duel over Catelyn Stark and that when he then died, she married Ned.

This seems like wayyyyyy to much info for Lord Baelish to tell to some random whores that just walked in. I think, in the heat of the moment, he almost let it slip that he was playing the game with Catelyn's sister, Lysa. He says, what we are supposed to assume is Catelyn, ""is not beautiful but has impeccable bloodlines"". However, we hear him say multiple times throughout the series that Catelyn was the most beautiful girl he'd ever met. As we later find out, he is the one that killed Jon Arryn so that he and Lysa could be together (his part in slithering his way to the Iron Throne). It could be a reach, but i feel that he is too calculated to relinquish that much information to random women he just met, unless he is trying to cover for a mistake he almost made. 

TL;DR Lord Baelish tried to use the story of him and Catelyn (which everyone knows) as a smokescreen because he almost gave up his main party trick, something we don't find out until many seasons later.

A few examples: 

Most obviously, RAMSEY BOLTON - hunted his exes, raped Sansa, killed his mother-in-law - killed by SANSA 

STANNIS BARATHEON (The One True King) - burned his daughter - killed by BRIENNE 

MARYN TRANT - loved to beat and screw little girls - killed by ARYA 

JEFFREY LANNISTER-BARATHEON - Killed Ros, taunted Sansa, etc - killed by QUEEN OF THORNS
 
KARL TANNER - Raped Craster's daughters, a lot - killed ultimately by Jon, but it was one of CRASTERS' DAUGHTERS who made that happen

Im rewatching GoT for the seventh season and i just got past Joffrey's poison scene.


So with Joffrey's death episode, i wanted to ask when Olenna slipped the vile into his cup. I know she gets the vile from sansa's necklace but is it when joffrey starts eating the pie?

I would think that would be the only time she would not be seen doing it because the cup is near her and everyone is focused on joffrey slicing the pie up. So if you guys know when you can actually see her do it, thatll be cool or if she just did it off camera. ",6,6,False,spoiler,,,,,

Rincon is running toward Jon before he is shot in the back by an arrow. Even the Sansa-Jon reconnection is only made possible by the Red Woman as Jon dies as Sansa is on her way to see him.

Is it possible that everyone has just completely misinterpreted this? Why does Rhaegar saying ""the dragon has three heads"" mean three dragon riders? The quote comes from the books, in which Dany sees Rhaegar in a vision where after the birth of his second child, Rhaegar says ""there must be a third. The dragon has three heads."" Well, what if this was just a hint to Jon Snow's parentage? Rhaegar wanted three children and was known as 'the last dragon'. I can't quite figure out where all this talk of dragon riders first came from. Dany has three dragons and leading up to season seven, only has a real relationship with one, which makes the other two expendable. I personally can't see all three dragons surviving this season and think at least one or possibly even two will die before the final battle with the white walkers begins. One by possibly Euron or Cersei and the other by the Night King. Adding to this, are three riders really.. necessary? We've seen Dany ride Drogon into combat and the other two would just follow with ease. Look at what they did in S06E9 for example, or when Dany got her unsullied army. Three characters riding dragons sounds awesome and whatnot, but I don't think its very realistic. What are your own thoughts?",15,30,False,spoiler,,,,,

I think all in all through everything I've watched, I liked the Starks the best but my favorite character is probably Sandor Clegane. Seeing him back in Season 6 made me happier than some (not all) of the deaths in episodes 9 and 10 of S6.

I apologize if this post is kind of random, just this is kind of a milestone for me. I avoided this subreddit like the plague because once I got into the show in May I didn't want to accidentally spoil anything for myself. So it feels kind of nice going on a subreddit for a show (and book series) I care about now knowing I've caught up.

To Season 7,

and the King of the North.

Really do. But does anyone else think that he WON'T become King of the Seven Kingdoms in the end? It seems a little too neat and safe, at least for GRR Martin.  I'm definitely seeing a pattern about Jon with power. In both his ascensions to power, he is not actually actively seeking it and rather it pushed by others to take that role (Sam and Lyanna Mormont). Unlike others, Jon doesn't use his power to serve himself but serve others. As Lord Commander, he uses his position to  save and ally with the Wildings to safeguard Westeros from the White Walkers and I suspect he will use his new position as King in the North to do the same.  

I think he'll be offered the position of King of the Seven Kingdoms (after his Targaryen heritage is revealed) but for the first time he'll decline and won't be pushed by others to take the role. He's not looking for power, only to serve others and really after the Great War will there be anyone to serve? It'll be peace time and he would've played his role to protect the people. He's done serving. 

I think the ending for Jon should be simple, almost anti-climatic. He's been fighting almost all his life and now he can finally put that aside and pursue a regular life. He'll be able to enjoy the things he once swore against: a wife, children etc. I see him settling down as a farmer with his new family up north, abdicating his title to Sansa or whoever. I know a lot a people wouldn't like this ending for being kinda boring - but that's why I love it. It seems a more realistic path considering we're already beginning to see a battle-weary Jon in S6.

Rough support, if I remember more of my arguments I'll update;

- Foreshadowed greatly that he will kill the Cerseinator, with him being her only heir as Tyrion is technically banished(?)
- Has already sat the iron throne but didn't claim it, instead he was curious to see who would.
- Known as kingslayer, oh the irony
- Read on here once that the Lannisters may be the legitimate heirs to the Targaryens through a previous Baratheon marriage (citation needed).
- Jamie tells Bronn that he could be the /hand/ he lost..
- The power triangle of Jon, Dany, and Tyrion is too good to be true. High stakes that Dany will die before/soon after claiming the thrones, Jon will sacrifice himself as Azor ahai (Stays king with 2 seasons left? yeah right) and Tyrion is going to die in the most unexpected death of the series.
- In the books, the Baratheon brothers first trip to the capital left them with the impression that Tywin had a kingly appearance. Pretty sure it is also referenced that Tywin was good-looking as a young man, meaning Jamie should also look kingly as he ages.
- Is one of the few people that never appear to be tempted by the throne, his only motivations being Cersei, and eventually the much more deserving redemption arc.
- Perfectly GRRM-esque finale to have the initial antagonist win. #teamlannister

Theon Grejoy: He always boasted about how good Grejoys are in love making. After he turns evil, his cock was cut off.

Jamie Lannister: He was considered one of the best sword fighter. After he pushed Bran through the window by his hand, His hand was cut off and he is not a good soldier anymore.

Cersei Lannister: She only loved her children and said she will do anything for them. All her children are dead.

Stannis Baratheon: He was a great warrior. But he did some terrible doings including burning her daughter. Killed by a woman (not a good farewell for such a great fighter)

Joffrey Baratheon: He was always a cowardly monster who used to hurt people just for fun. Died in a terrible way in front of all people.

Ramsey Bolton: This one was quite clear. He used hounds for torturing innocent. Killed by his own hounds.

Roose Bolton: He betrayed his own lords which were starks. Got killed by his son.

Septon: I think his death depicted something else. He preached about religion and gods. But was killed by the wildfire which we can assume as a science. So I would say that it was religion vs science battle.

Meryn Trant: He abused young girls. killed by a young girl Arya

Tywin Lannister: He always bragged about his legacy and him being the lion. Killed sitting on a toilet seat. What a terrible way to go.

I think there are also other incidents. Can you recall some? Also how the remaining villains will go?

This image is just amazing. I mean all the thought that must have gone into it. This is when Davos finds shireen's deer toy at the remains of the stake she was burned at. Notice how the sky right above the remains of the stake create the appearance of flames. Also the contrast between the color of the burning sky and the icy plane surrounding just perfectly reflects the show: ""A Song of Ice and Fire"". I don't know who to credit with this amazing image, but this is just overall fantastic cinematography and is one of the reasons I love this show

Either as an undead wight who I suppose may be particularly powerful due to her 'magic' she seems to have. Or maybe she may become part of the Others' army some other way. This theory applies as much for Jon as it does for Daenerys. Especially seeing as the whole Jon becoming part of the Others' army theory is much more common than Daenerys. Their Targaryen heritage being what would warrent them the name 'Ice Dragon', and the fact they are fighting for the army of the Others adding the 'Ice'.

Looking at the majority of the comments, I see a lot of people wishing LF's demise and stating what a horrid person he is. Which is true, he's the furthest thing from an angel. But like how it can be said about nearly anyone, everyone is a hero from their perspective. Good and bad is ultimately a measure of the lesser of all evil. Since there is no completely good person, who was always a saint and had no crappy personality all their life (minus kids and maybe Davos :)). And even bad people have reasoning to their choices in life and are capable of some positive traits. Cerseri loving (mostly, dunno what happened with the whole Tommen thing) her children and driven emotionally by them e.t.c

And well renowned good characters like Jon and Tyrion, Jon who was a spoiled brat when arrived at the wall, if not for Tyrion he would've either been killed as a spoiled brat or lived as a spoiled brat. Tyrion who was for the longest time helping the 'bad' guys and only left their 'side' when he was forced to, he didn't have a change of heart to go help Daenerys because he wanted to.

Bringing it all back to Littlefinger, I think people are too harsh on him, especially in his recent acts of 'good', he is personally responsible for the deaths of Jeoffery and Ramsay Bolton, he is the reason the self-conceited 'honourable' lords of the Vale moved their fat arse to go aid the good guys in need and finally got the Starks some victory. They, including her sister, wouldn't help Catelyn in their hour of need and one of the most important war for them.

And even more, talking about the starks. People claim betraying Ned was such a heinous act. The same Ned, who almost choked him to death, when he was trying to protect his wife. Didn't show concern or care when Cersei revealed that Robert is an abusive husband and negligent 'father' (even more so for Gendry, the only thing he ever got was his heritage, along with a world of troubles) and just gave her a head start to run away, ignored LF's somewhat reasonable request to make peace between the Starks and Lanisters (he was right, you only make peace with your enemies, the same thing Robert did), then went on to ask LF to bribe the city officials (put their lives on the line for a stranger and gold) to stand against their monarch, (in the show) didn't show concern for the well-being of his daughters while he was trying to stage a coup and finally denied Renly's VERY reasonable claim for the throne, a friend of Ned i might add, by lecturing him for trying to disrupt the line of succession, the same thing the Baratheons did to gain power and stop the slaughter of Starks, to begin with.

If LF didn't betray Ned and allowed Ned to give power to Stannis, that would've been the end of Littlefinger. Either physically or financially, most definitely socially. Littlefinger was too close to the Lanisters, so he could've been seen as a threat. Brothels were his source of income, which Stannis may have closed down. Dunno if Stannis needed LF as a master of coin. And he would have almost zero percent chance of 'climbing the ladder' with Stannis as King. All of this could happen if he helps Ned, so not that surprised he betrayed him. I don't think LF hated Ned and held much malicious attitude towards him as some might be left to believe, he did tell Ned not to trust him (pretty much preparing him for the game) and tried to give him advice (like when Ned foolishly declared a ruling on Tywin, if he hated Ned and wanted him to fail from the beginning, he could've egged him on further to go to war with the Lanisters). It's just that Ned was obstinate on putting Stannis on the throne, who seemingly no one wanted on the throne.

And people also give him too much of a hard time over Sansa. First, he never forced her to marry Ramsay. He even says, they will go back if that's what she wants. But he wants her to stop being a bystander and pretty much get involved in shaping the future. He really didn't know of Ramsay's true nature, when he talks to him on the walls, they were alone and he sounded sincere when he said he didn't know much about him and he cares greatly for Sansa. Betrothals in the first place is taking a gamble, at least in those days and going off Ramsay's timid acting in front of him, probably thought he was just another case of John Snow.

And IMO the reason he needed them to wed, was to sever the connection between the Boltons and the Lanisters, long enough for Stannis or the Vale to get some work done. In hindsight, it was really dumb for Roose to fall for that crap. Or he didn't think LF, Stannis or the Cersei led Lanisters were much of a threat.
He thought she could manipulate Ramsay, through the skills I'm assuming she gained from her gown of seduction (+32 charm, not effective on anyone with Bolton blood) at least until Stannis could divert everyone's attention. And he would swoop in with the army of the Vale to do...something, kill Stannis or Ramsay? Really no one could've predicted Stannis's conquest for the second time, would fail so spectacularly. Everyone goes on to claim he is a military genius and then he goes and pulls that crap.

Even more when he comes to see Sansa, he was feeling discomfort at someone elses suffering (which is significant because its him), to the point he was testing out the possibility that someone else would end his life. He also gave her a 'gift' (more valuable than Lannister gold, hint hint Brienne) of knowledge, with the whereabouts of Blackfish. Which if Blackfish and pretty much everyone at Riverun wasn't a moron, would've come to Sansa's and the Starks aid, thus diminishing the need for LF to play a part in Sansa's life.

So in the end, crap happens, bad people die thx to Littlefigner, but he still gets the finger. The heck is up with that. People are often judging their world with the system we have in place, in our world. Unable to distinguish the difference in setting and environment, the two world posses. Simply put, in their world, if you want power (the same power that lets you decide your fate and how you choose to live your life, so it's pretty important), either you're born with it or you kill for it. Littlefinger is trying the latter, the same way Tyrion was trying, but with his own manipulative take on it.",14,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Saying the drogo thing makes everything wrong is a worthless argument)

....Burned Dany's first fleet/Is the Harpy/plans on marrying, not a Wolf Queen, but a Dragon Queen... he MAY, POSSIBLY, IMPROVABLY COULD, have also killed Drogo and Rhaego

Think back, have you ever heard Littlefinger mention Dany?

Doesn't that seem odd? How can a man so smart ignore such an asset? 

He isn't. 

He told Sansa to never reveal your plans to your enemy and keep them guessing what you want. His seeming disregard of Dany feels too intentional and suspicious, he doesn't want people knowing that he thinks about Daenerys Targaryen.

His plan isn't to trick the lords of Westeros into crowning him king via manipulations of pawns and kings.

All his planning is to make himself one thing, the most eligible bachelor in Westeros.

He weakened the great men of the seven kingdoms through his control of Lysa Arryn, having her poison one Lord Paramount, and have her tell another that a third did it. Before long both Lords and their heirs were dead. Or eneligible. Jaime will never leave Cersei. 

There is a theory (not mine) that Littlefinger is the one that pushed Joffrey into killing Ned, he is the only person at the execution (other than Joffrey) not upset about it.


(One Side Note: Baelish is not flawless, Tyrion being alive is an error, he expected him to either die or be sent to the wall. Jaimie and Varys saving him took him by surprise, and it would not surprise me if that's partly what Varys saved Tyrion, to keep an high-born heir out of Petyr's clutches.)

So: 

Stark: No male Starks except a cripple that may be impotent, two girls, a bastard and wight beyond the wall.

Lannister, All dead or unwilling to marry ('cept Tyrion, a loose end)

Aryyn: One sick boy he can easily manipulate, and sick children die all the time...


That leaves 5, Baratheon, Greyjoy, Tyrell, Martell, and Tully.

Baratheon - Dead or bastards.

Greyjoy - dead, implotent or an enemy.

Tyrell dead. He negotiated them into the capital, the most dangerous place in Westeros (south of the wall).

Martell dead. (Oberyn did like his brothels, he also drank right before his fight with the Mountain, how did Joffrey die again?)

Tully stripped of power.

Two more lords took the place of two fallen: Bolton and Frey.

Both are now extinct.

There is only two males greater than him. One is a sickly boy under his thrall and the other is the brother of his protege.

He also needed Dany to come home, Dany cant marry him if she arrives with a Khal husband beside her, if her son had lived she would have stayed with the Dothraki, so he sent an agent to make sure neither lived.

He knew that Varys was meeting with Illyrio not because he was following Varys but because he was following Illyrio, or Illyrio works for him.

But Dany moved to fast, before long she had conquered Slavers bay and had an army ready to sail, and he needed more time.

He was far from the most eligible bachelor.

He started funding the sons of the former slavers and they called him ""The Harpy""

He assinated a king knowing Tyrion would be blamed and thinking he would be executed or sent to the Wall.

This would also give him total control over the Key to the North.

Once again Dany moved to fast she was quickly ready to sail home. So he burned her fleet. It was not the Masters, they wanted her to sail to Westeros and leave them alone, burning her way to get there makes zero sense.

His agents in the Night's Watch hampered Jon at every turn as Littlefinger knew his parentage and knew his potential greatness should that heritage become known.

He manipulated a paranoid queen into thinking her own family was her enemy leading to her killing the last eligible male Lannisters.

I don't know how he did all this. But I'm more and more sure he did. Every eligible male is either dead or no longer eligible from Robb Stark to Lancel Lannister. And an unwed Dragon Queen is coming for her throne.

One last thing: Littlefinger is far down my favorite character list, I always disregarded him as a doomed wannabe villain, till I was rewatching season 4 and his speech tonSansa on the boat sent my mind into overdrive.",161,432,False,spoiler,,,,,

That having dragons on her side almost ensure her victory in any battle. But I'd argue that dragons are overhyped. Sure they are a major asset in any battle - their firepower is a force to be reckoned with and they are great for psychological warfare - but they are nowehere near as strong as they are made out to be.


1. Dragons flying in a battle is subject to weather conditions. They aren't that effective during rains and are basically grounded during storms. This would work against them in a WW fight where the NK brings the snow-storm with him to each battle. 

2. Heavy artillery like scorpions and catapults can likely take them down. We saw Drogon get injured by regular spears thrown by men. So even at his current bigger size there are still weapons that can be used against them. 

3. Their wings seem like an obvious weak spot, being made of thin membranes as they are. Put enough holes in them and the dragon won't be able to fly. And falls from great heights kill dragons as easily as they kill its rider. 

4. They burn without distinction, so they can't be used as indiscriminately. You don't want your own soldiers getting roasted by dragons in melee combat and you don't want to burn the regular citizens that you are later planning on ruling. 

5. While of tactical use, they are of little strategic use. The dragons can still only be on 1 battlefield at a time. So if you are fighting the enemy on 10 fronts, winning 3 battles while losing the other 7 wouldn't be much helpful. 

6. They need a rider to be useful. Left alone a dragon would either just kill indiscriminately or simply go around doing its own thing. You need a rider directing it at the enemies, moving it to the right battlefields and telling it when to fire. Which means, armies that avoid the dragon-riders can easily avoid the dragons as well. 

7. They are of no use against unconventional warfare like guerilla tactics. Their usage is limited to open-field warfare or castle sieges. 


And ofcourse, we don't know of their vulnerabilities to things like magic. 

Are there other weaknesses I might be missing here?

2- Jorah will go to the Citadel of the Oldtown to ask help from masters. Maybe he will meet with Samwell Tarly and talk about his father and Jon Snow. Also Samwell Tarly has Heartsbane so Jorah can see that sword then shall learn that  Valyrian sword of his house is in the hands of Jon Snow.

3- More misterious and exciting one: in season 2 in Qarth Jorah met with possible red priest of R'hllor with covered chain face. That priest knew Jorah and has  remembered him
that he is one of the Andals. In a later scene she was making treatment to protect a traveller  from diseases of ancient Valyria through his journey.

he characters that got aged up in the show. Like Joffrey, Robb, Tommen, Sansa, Jon, Arya, Dany, Visrys, Bran, Rickon, Theon, Robin Arryn.

As a book reader, I am more forgiving of these characters mistakes, yes even Joffrey, there is a reason. Even if the characters are aged up in the show their actions are taken from the books where they are much younger. Hence 17 year old Joffrey acts like a 14yo because he is supposed to be. 

19 year old Robb stupidly married Talisa because he is supposed to be 16 and the show didn't age up his personality with his body.

Sansa is a sheltered 12 year old girl, and Sophie Turner portrays a 12 year old girl, mentally.

I think we should take these characters age with a grain of salt, because the show forgot to age up their actions and minds when they aged up their bodies.",78,349,False,spoiler,,,,,

Now we know the Hightowers do exist as we met one in the flashback revealing Jon's parentage, Lord Commander Gerold Hightower.

In the books there is a prophecy that if the Hightowers ever side against the Targaryens, Oldtown will be destroyed.

Lord Gerold knew of this prophecy and that Jon was a Targaryen, or at least had their blood, it's possible even likely that he warned his family not to oppose this person and the resident Lord Hightower, with undeniable proof of Jon's heritage from the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, will reveal this information to Sam.

And if the Hightowers were not important why not cut out Gerold Hightower from the Tower Of Joy altogether like they did with Oswell Whent? He didn't contribute anything, just a warmup for Eddard.

YUP. I'm on that bandwagon too. I know there are a TON of speculation and theories around this, so apologies if this is obvious and repetitive. Essentially, the thought behind it is, Bran's version of ""time"" isn't linear, but rather, connected to certain events. THAT's why the Hodor thing was significant to show. The idea that he can transcend himself across timelines so help certain events happen. Hodor becoming Hodor, wouldn't have happened, if Bran never became Hodor to save them - creating a loop. That's why the blood raven said: ""the ink is dry, the past is already written"" and THAT'S why Old Nan always confuses Bran with the other Brans, because in some ways he IS or at some point has been all those other Brans. I still think Bran is the reason the Mad King goes mad, and if Bran wargs back in time to see the wall being built and sees that it's not, perhaps he wargs into Bran the Builder to help get the wall started, because future Bran knows it needs to be built. IF you're still following, the theory is basically that Bran wargs into the mortal that eventually becomes the Night King before he becomes the Night King to try to stop the creation of the white walkers. Thus is turn, the children are threatened by this ""unknown version of Bran"" and turns him into a WW NOT knowing this was the Bran Stark that would rejoin in the future. If you rewatch the scene where the NK is getting turned into a WW - the way in which it was shot, ties the NK and Bran by how it's framed and how they cut back to Bran during this transition. It's almost as if future Bran feels the pain of the NK being turned because it is actually HIM getting turned. When Bran asks the children why they did what they did their response was: ""to protect us from you. From men""...I think they literally meant Bran, but the Bran back then that they didn't know WAS Bran at the time. and thats why people always tell him ""dont stay too long or you'll drown""....cause thats literally what happens to Bran.
Now, if this is true, I'm sure the leading question is now ""why would he become so evil and hell bent on destroying Westeros?"" Well, remember, when Bran wargs into Summer he feels like a wolf. Imagine being trapped in an endless winter when all you've been trying to do is save the people of Westeros. In my opinion, Bran is over it. He blames Westeros for this and he wants to wipe out the thing that caused him and his family so much pain. He wants, as Dany puts it, to break the wheel. He will not stop until he has destroyed the iron throne. Bran being the NK, also explains the NK's green seeing abilities and why he was able to see/touch Bran. It could also explain the NK's weird fascination with Jon Snow. The small part of Bran that is left inside the NK, sees his brother. His brother who has the power to put his cause to rest.
Lastly, the Blood Raven told Bran he would fly someday. I personally am also on the bandwagon that the NK will get his hands on one of Dany's dragon, creates and ice dragon, and rides it.

So let's talk about Daario Naharis (with regards to the TV show). He was sold into slavery at a young age, trained to fight in the fighting pits of Slavers Bay and eventually became the king of fighters, revered and loved by all.

In season three, he is approached by Khaleesi and and asked to join her cause to overthrow the slave masters of Slavers Bay. He betrays his fellow captains, kills them, and assumes sole command of the Second Sons. He sacks the city of Yunkai and takes a right hand spot to Khaleesi for his actions.

In season four, he travels with Khaleesi to Meereen and overthrows the masters there. Khaleesi takes full control of the cities of Slavers Bay and discontinues anything having to do with the fighting pits. I can only assume the fighting pits were prime grounds for betting, making some of the fighters rich, and the masters even richer. Hizdahr Zo Loraq surfaces as a character.

In season five, Hizdahr requests that the fighting pits be reopened to preserve tradition. The Sons of the Harpy begin terrorizing the city of Meereen, killing masters, unsullied, and even Ser Barristan. This angers Khaleesi as she suspects Hizdahr is the leader of the SOH or may know who the leader is and she gathers the leaders of the great houses of Meereen and threatens them with her dragons. She decides to keep her enemies close and reopen the fighting pits under the condition that Hizdahr and her become man and wife.

In the episode ""Dance of Dragons"" (RIP Shireen) Hizdahr is executed by the SOH and Drogon rescues Khaleesi and flies her to Dothraki Land where she is captured by the Khalisar.

In season 6, Khaleesi's companions are left behind to rule Meereen while Jorah and Daario head out to find Khaleesi. They find her in Vaes Dothrak, bring her back to Meereen, she seemingly kills the remaining SOH and kills the city's attackers once and for all. At this point, she prepares to leave for Westeros, tasks Jorah with finding a cure, and tells Daario to stay behind and rule the city in her stead. He is reluctant, but does as he is asked. She leaves, and that brings us up to speed.

Here's the theory, which will be 100% fact this coming season...

Daario is the leader of The Sons of the Harpy. I think The Sons of the Harpy are Daario's Second Sons.

Homeboy is playing the game. Playing Dany HARD.

I just finished rewatching the series and there are some suspicious camera cuts towards Daario during small council conversations and foreboding lines that come out of Daario's mouth, enough to make you raise an eyebrow in his direction. Like the directors did it on purpose. I believe that he has played Dany into a position of her trusting him enough to rule over Slaver's Bay (now the Bay of Dragons) and will establish a corrupt order in which he will return the cities to their former state and rule as a kingpin like figure.

I don't think this show is done with Daario Naharis, and Michael Huisman, the actor who plays Daario, has stated that he is returning. Jorah and Daario are the only two major characters still in Essos. These guys are natural enemies. I think Jorah will hear about Daario's reign and abandon his quest to find a cure for his greyscale, and will travel to Meereen to fight Daario for Khaleesi's honor in one of the coming episodes. Jorah will perish and somehow Dany will receive word of this and return to uproot Daario and the corruption in The Bay of Dragons once and for all.

Seems like a reasonable enough plan, and at no point is it ever indicated this plan is not viable.

Now at the end of Season 6, Dany is finally off to Westeros to claim what is hers, however the composition of her forces are entirely different. She now has

 - 3 well matured Dragons, now the size of large planes 

 - The backing of the Houses Tyrell and Dorne and their forces

 - A significant percentage of the Ironborn's best ships and crew

 - The seized fleet of the Masters

 - 8000 Unsullied

 - Around 100'000 Dothraki, the % that is battle worthy is unknown.

This is also without mentioning that since the original invasion plan was set in motion, the War of the 5 Kings has ravaged Westeros, killing many of it's best Generals, and heavily depleting the Armies, Navies and food reserves of Westeros. The North has also once again declared Independence from the 7 Kingdoms. 

What I'm asking is that compared to the original plan, the Targaryen forces are now orders of magnitude more powerful, with a huge army and navy, large dragons; while at the same time Westeros has torn itself apart the entire time and is now fractured and depleted. How could the invasion of the 7 Kingdoms possibly be of any difficulty given the remarkable turning of the tide in Dany's favour?",17,20,False,spoiler,,,,,

Think about it.  He is Littlefinger.  If you could think of one person to be ""the little brother,"" who would it be?  He was the ""little brother"" to Catelyn and is often mocked for that. Who fits the term valonqar better than him?

What got me thinking was that Cersei thinks Tyrion is the valonqar.  Tyrion has been blamed for much of Littlefingers evil.  He was blamed for poisoning and killing Joffrey, he was blamed for possessing the Valyrian steel dagger, and he went on trial in season one for killing Jon Aryn (Littlefinger was the perpetrator of all three crimes).
 
What if Tyrion is blamed for one more of Littlefingers evils: being the valonqar?

There is a lot of talk about ""valonqar"" being a misinterpretation of little sister or something like that, but it could also be a misinterpretation of ""littlefinger.""

In season 7, as the pace increases, Littlefinger will be looking to paint his picture: him on the Iron Throne.  The main obstacle in the way?  Cersei Lannister.  Other than Arya and Olenna, he probably has the best motive out of anyone in the show.

Think of Hardhome as a test case for him. He's waged war against men before but it's been thousands of years; he needs to assess their capabilities. He could have made quick work of the wildlings, skipping the avalanche entrance, attacking at night, and swiftly recruiting thousands to his army. But how do the humans react to a frontal assault? Do they organize quickly? Instead of sending in his full force, he sends a small detachment against the fort's defenses.

1456,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2017-6-13,2017,6,13,20,6gzd55,self.gameofthrones,[EVERYTHING] Rights to the Throne...,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/6gzd55/everything_rights_to_the_throne/,genkaus,1497354743,"""Who is the rightful ruler of Westeros?"" - its a question that comes up quite often here. Previously, I've discussed the laws regarding the legitimate line of succession and who has the best claim on that basis. But a lot of people keep bringing up the right of conquest as a valid path to the throne. So let's talk about that an other possible avenues to the Iron Throne here. 


**Why does it matter?** - Why are we talking about these things at all? Aren't these laws and customs and claims of legitimacy just for show and pageantry? All this is just a way for the victor to justify what he has done. Anyone who wins the throne can make up his own laws justifying his claim to it and no one can do a damn thing about it. Its ""might makes right"" all the way.

Except, things are never that simple - not in Westeros nor in the real world. If Westeros was ruled by just the ""might makes right"" principle, it'd have never grown beyond the warring tribes era. You wouldn't have 7 kingdoms, you'd have 7000 kingdoms each fighting over its neighbors over small pieces of land. Laws and customs about what is legitimate or illegitimate form the basis for lasting peace and civilization. That's why these things matter. 

Rather than ""might makes right"", its usually the case of ""right makes might"". A ruler's ""might"" comes from his armies and his armies come from the local lords supporting him. But without some sort of legitimate claim to the throne - no matter how contestable - he won't be able to raise enough might to take it. And even if he does take it somehow, he won't be able to keep it for long. ""Might makes right"" is a terrible precedent to set because its an open invitation to any man who thinks he has enough might to make a bid for the crown. The rule would never be secure and the ruler would have to keep fending off pretenders from all directions which would keep chipping away at his might till the day he falls. And the cycle would continue with whoever takes his place. Even if it doesn't look like there are any contenders right now, things will settle down in a few years and conflict will rise again. 

So yeah, even if its just for show, the ruler has to make some form of legitimate claim to the throne - one that fits with established laws and precedents. And that's why these laws and customs matter - so that we can judge who is likely to have most support and whose rule is likely to be most secure. 


**Line of Succession** - The best legitimacy to any claim in Westeros seems to come from birthright. That has been the established custom that was practiced for ages and we've already gone down that road in quite a bit of detail. We've discussed the different rules of inheritance based on position, lineage, gender and bastardy. Suffice to say that if this was the only law in play, Robyn Arryn might be the rightful king. 


**Right of Conquest** - People simply love bringing his one up here. Aegon was the rightful king because he conquered the seven kingdoms. Robert was the rightful king because conquered them from the Targaryens. Renly would've been the rightful king had he succeeded. Cersei is the rightful queen because there is no one left to challenge her. And Danaerys would be the rightful queen once she wins. 

But that's not how the right of conquest works - not in the real world and most likely not in Westeros either. In the real world, right of conquest applied to International law - to the territories seized from other countries by force, not the ones seized from your own. It is not, repeat not, just another phrase for ""might makes right"". 

Take Aegon, for example. He was not a citizen of any of the 7 kingdoms. He was not bound by their laws or customs. Nor did he have any treaties or pacts with those kingdoms. There was no legal prohibition against his annexation of territories from those said kingdoms - which is what he did and that is how he became the rightful king. The same would apply to Danaerys conquering Astapor or Yunkai or Mereen. 

But Robert was a citizen of the Seven Kingdoms. He was already bound by the laws and customs of his country. And he was bound by oath not to raise arms against his king. His army was the king's army that he was illegally using against the king - which would make his war illegitimate and his claim void. That's why Robert never claimed the throne by ""Right of Conquest"" - he claimed it by a combination of ""Right of Rebellion"" and ""Line of Succession"". 


**Right of Rebellion** - This one would be the trickiest one to figure out, because there is no clear precedent in Westeros regarding this and the issue is plenty unclear in the real world as well. But rebellions do happen in GoT and rebels do need some justification to rally behind. 

Basically, the idea here is that just as citizens are bound by their oath/duty to the existing regime, the existing regime is bound by its oath/duty to its subjects. If the existing ruler fails to do his duty by his subjects them he loses the right to rule and the rebels are justified in overthrowing him. Whether or not the ruler has actually failed in his duty would be a separate question and its often a matter of perspective. But the more important point here is that just because a ruler loses the right to rule, that right doesn't transfer automatically to you. Robert might claim that he had the right to rebel because Aerys had failed in his duty to uphold the law, but that doesn't mean he has the right to rule just because he won. His right to rule still derives from his Targaryen heritage. 


**Right by Divine Mandate** - Another favorite trick of the rulers and a great way to secure your reign - act as if you were anointed by the gods. Which usually translates to having the leader of the dominant religion declare you so. Every King of Westeros has had to be approved by the Faith of Seven - even if that approval was mere formality. This is the reason why Stannis would've had a hard time ever winning the throne, much less managing to keep it. Even if it was nominal, he was still a follower of a foreign religion. That alone would disqualify him from the rule in the eyes of many of the lords of Westeros - lords whose support he'd need to gain and keep the throne. 

In a manner of speaking, this was how the High Sparrow became the de-facto ruler in King's Landing - he gained support because he was gods' chosen, whereas all the other nobles were an ungodly lot. 


**Right by Popular Vote** - While not having much of a legal precedent in Westeros, if you want to secure your power, this would be the best way to do it. The right to rule, after all, is always contingent upon the consent of the governed and no ruler is secure without that. Robb Stark's legitimacy came not only from his lineage, but also from his subjects declaring him to be the king. The same goes for Jon Snow. The only region in Westeros to actually practice this as a law would be the Iron Islands and being elected was what made Euron their rightful leader over the more legitimate birthright of Yara or Theon. The Great Councils held in the past to decide a new king were also an example of choosing a ruler through popular vote. 



**Final Words:** Basically, in order to have a secure reign, a ruler has to establish his legitimacy through one or more ""rights"" - consistent with how these rights have been established as part of the laws and customs of Westeros. Aegon might've claimed ""Right of Conquest"", but it doesn't apply to his descendants. They've had to rely on birthright or popular vote or divine mandate to secure their rule. Danaerys, however, can claim Right of Conquest once again, since she is essentially an outsider with an independent army. And while Cersei might argue right of conquest or succession to sit on the throne, her claim wouldn't pass legal muster and is therefore unlikely to be secure or very long.

I'm asking because we have these two main plots that we know will surely happen (WW and Daenerys in Westeros), but I still haven't figured it out how the producers will organize them. On one hand, it makes sense for the Walkers to attack now - not only has winter come but we now know how big of a threat these creatures are. On the other hand, Daenerys has been planing to arrive at Westeros since S1, and she finally set sail on the last episode of S6, so it makes sense for her to conquer the Seven Kingdoms now.

I think it's obvious Daenerys will participate in the fight against the White Walkers, but will this happen before or after she tries to conquer the Seven Kingdoms?

Back in Season 2 when Stannis was headed for King's Landing, Tyrion told Lord Varys that back when he was a young adult [he was put in charge of all of the drains and sewers of Casterly Rock](https://youtu.be/m-mRcaQIU48?t=92) by Tywin. 

Now back in the Season 7 trailer, we saw Unsullied troops sacking a castle belonging to House Lannister, leading to the theory that it could be Casterly Rock itself (the home of House Lannister). Could all this experience that Tyrion had manning the drains and sewers lead him to ordering his men to enter the castle through a secret route - a concept we have seen so many times in so many episodes (think of Mereen, Yunkai, King's Landing back when the defenders had to get rid of that ramming device, etc.). Just an interesting thought... 

EDIT: 8 days later and the second trailer is up. Not only am I absolutely surprised with how this blew up obviously, but it seems that my theory is likely correct! 

In the trailer Grew Worm appears seemingly outside a drain, and a small squad of unsullied open up the gates to a much larger force outside! So yeah... Good chance everything I have mentioned has proven right.",299,3941,False,spoiler,,,,,

Like many other aspects of GRRM's books, trial by combat can also find reference in real world medieval history. Unlike those other aspects, however, its not nearly as well-crafted or thought out. 


In the real world, trial by combat usually came with its own rules and regulations. For example, it was invoked mostly in cases where there were no eyewitnesses or evidence or confessions - basically, no way for the humans to judge guilt or innocence, so they had to leave it to the gods. Another common aspect would be for the combatants to be of similar size and speed so that you could argue that it was actually divine intervention that allowed 1 party to win. Without such rules and regulations, these trials would end up being blatant cases of miscarriage of justice. 


But no such precautions seem present in Westeros. It seems obvious that any and all facts of the case would be irrelevant because the accused can simply demand a trial by combat. And if the accused is rich enough, they can simply hire the biggest and baddest fighter to prove their innocence - even if they are guilty as seven hells. Its not just injustice obvious to us, it should be blatant injustice even for the given setting. 


I find it hard to believe that even the best and just Targaryen kings of the past didn't see the obvious. Even if the practice was too entrenched to be abolished completely, reforming it should've still been possible. Even kings like Jahaerys I - known for his excellent legal reforms through the realm, Daeron II the Good - known for his diplomacy and intellectual nature or Aegon V the Unlikely - known for his concern for the smallfolk - didn't see this barbaric practice for what it was and allowed it to continue. Even Maekar - who ended up killing his own brother in a trial by combat - didn't think that it was a bad idea. 


Interestingly, before Tyrion's trial for killing Joffrey, this practice seemed to lack the most glaring flaws. In his first trial at the Vale, there really was little to no evidence against him and the combatants would appear evenly matched. Similarly, for the Hound's trial, there was little evidence supporting the charges. Its only in his latest trial that the injustice becomes obvious. Even if the evidence is manufactured, there was a whole lot of it against him, which means a trial by combat shouldn't have been allowed in the first place. 


Ultimately, it ended up being a weak and ineffectual king who got through a major reform in Westerosi justice system - something that all the wise and mad kings alike failed to do. ",62,9,False,spoiler,,,,,

1) Its going to make for a great twist - After Neds death, the red wedding and Jon's stabbing, the show writers are going to look for new ways to shock the audiance, and this is going to be a great way of doing this.

2) It make sense from a charecter arc prespective - D&amp;D used to talk about Sansa's charecter in interviews, and one of the things they said is how her charecter has been changed by her surroundings. Think about it - Sansa spent her last couple of years sourunded by people like Cersei, Joffrey and most importently Littlefinger, all people who are power hungry, cruel and self serving. It makes sense that some of it rubbed on Sansa.

3) It explains some plot holes - If this theory is correct, it would explain why Sansa didn't tell Jon about the knights of the Vale before the battle. Jon is a threat to Sansa's claim to the north, maybe Sansa planned to first let Ramsay kill Jon in battle and then swoop in with her Vale army and be proclaimed the queen in the north.

4) Things are just too good - The political situation in Westeros right now is just too great for our good guys. The 
Starks rule the North, Dany is coming with a massive army, Bran is at the wall and Arya will reunite with her family. Things are just too good and safe for our heros, the show needs some sort of conflict to up the pressure and a Stark civil war is a perfect way of doing it.",32,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

He says ""In the shadowlands beyond Asshai, they say there are fields of ghost grass with stalks as pale as milk that glow in the night. It murders all other grass. The Dothraki believe that one day it will cover everything. That's the way the world will end.

I see two possible interpretations of this quote.

1. What the Dothraki believe to be the shadow lands is the north in Westeros, and what the believe to be ghost grass is snow. Snow/whitewalkers will cover the earth.
2. The ghost grass is a metaphor for Dany and her ""pale as milk"" hair. Dany will destroy the world. 

Either way I'm now convinced GOT with the end of the world. I would love to hear your opinions and your own interpretations.

Recently, watching some theories I came up with the idea that Jamie is Azor Ahai (I'm not the only one with this idea). 
In the third book (ASOS) in Davos V it says ""Azor Ahai tempered Lightbringer by thrusting it through the heart of the wife he loved. He slew his wife to fight the dark"".
I think that Jamie Lannister is going to kill Cersei (The one he loves), we have to remember that Maggy told Cersei that she will be killed by his ""little brother"" and we know that Cersei is older than Jaime by minutes.
At the end of Season 6 in the coronation of Cersei we can see Jamie with what I think it is an angry face. The fact that Cersei triggered the death of Tommen by destroying the Great Sept of Baelor killing Margaery and hundreds of people could changed Jamie's feelings with Cersei.
On the other hand, we can see that it says ""wife"", this could mean that Jamie will in fact marry Cersei or is talking metaphorically.
This theory, obviously, may or may not be true, but thats the idea I came up while watching Alt Shift X's video called ""What do Dany's Undying visions mean?"". 

If you know more about this theory or Azor Ahai or you don't agree please let me know. ",38,29,False,spoiler,,,,,

1. The two people in the show who've been brought back to like are Beric and Jon. When Melisandre ask Thoros how and that he's not supposed to have this power. When she ask Beric what he sees he says blackness. Jon is asked the same and answers blackness too. So if they both only see blackness where is the lord of light? Or the seven? Or the old gods and the new? If the lord of light brings people back from the dead, talks to people (red priest and priestess), or does magic when you throw body parts into a fire (Gendry and Varys) where is this lord of light? Is it safe to assume it's just magic? If it were just magic where did the name come from? Is it Bran (another theory)? 

2. What do you think or where do you think the Dothraki and the Unsullied will live or be when the war happens? We obviously believe Dany will best Cersei and the Lannisters but where will all these new people reside? What will happen to them? Do you think they will want to go back to Essos after they've taken a new land?

In the next paragraph GRRM goes on to talk about Gregor Clegane. Saying the only peace the mountain had given anyone is the peace of the grave. 
Littlefinger in the Alayne chapter told her that he(LF) will never go to harrenhall as it is truly cursed. Everyone that has ruled there has died. Badly. So. Could GRRM be setting up Jaime's death. Maybe by the mountain. As the mountain now is Cersies guard??  Jaime kill Cersie only to get killed by the zombie mountain. Or ser Robert Strong in the books? 

Edit: THEN. Later in the chapter Jaime himself says the same thing. To the septon. 

&gt;"".....Every man who holds this castle seems to come to a bad end. The mountain, the goat, even my father""

Jaime does not realize he holds harrenhall at that moment?

Anywho. Have a nice day. 

EDIT 2:  HOLY CROW. THIS JUST IN

Later in the chapter. He is trying to remember the connington that was hand to arys. He thinks

&gt; It all came back to him. Jon connongton had been prince rhaegars friend. When Merrywheather failed to dismally to contain Roberts rebellion and Prince Rhaegar could not be found....

However I noticed in [this](https://youtu.be/TOt5PZwbnKM?t=359) clip from S01E05 that Ser Vardis has a very distinctive accent. When compared to Littlefingers' accent in [this](https://youtu.be/5QtRPT_zYHc?t=26) clip, there are quite clear similarities, at least I think so.

Could it be possible (and it's probably a longshot) that Aidan Gillen was told about the accent and changed it to suit the fact that he's been living in the Vale for a long time now?

Included in the promotion is a sweet bobble-head of one of our pitchers, Chris Devenski, riding a dragon! What's great about this is that his nickname is Dragon, for his fiery stuff and aggressive mentality. He is a unicorn of sorts, where he is used in high leverage situations with incredible diversity (he can get you out of a jam for an inning, or even go 3 if needed!). The catch is, that only certain sections come with the bobble-head, I have just secured my seat/bobble-head. Pic in the link

Also! There will be the Official Iron Throne that will be available for pictures (to all fans not just those with Promotional Tickets). I thought this community would find these interesting. After the game I can post pictures of the bobble-head and of the Iron Throne itself, if people wish.

""That is not dead and can eternal lie. And with strange aeons even death may die""  
  
Along with this is similarities between Ironborn mythology and Cthulhu. Cthulhu is said to have a rivalry with the Air Elemental Old One known as Hastur, the Drowned God has a rival in the form of the Storm God, who blew the Andals to the Iron Islands.  
  
To add to this, during the reign of Aerys I, the Iron Islands were ruled by Dagon Greyjoy. The name Dagon comes from a Mesopotamian agriculture and fish god, but in the Cthulhu Mythos he's a Great Old One who rules over the Deep Ones. 
  
On the topic of Dagon, I've found a few interesting tidbits about the Manderlys, such as how they rule an area known as 'the Mouth of the North' (Shadows Over Inns**mouth** anyone?), their sigil is a mermaid (half human, half fish, a deep-one possibly) and one of the Manderlys was said to have had webbed fingers and a Greyjoy was named *Dagon*, most likely after the Mesopatamian water god but it could be the Great Old One.
  
Qohor reveres a deity known as the Black Goat, who may be Shub-Niggurath, the Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young.
  
Finally there is the Church of Starry Wisdom, established by the Bloodstone Emperor of the Empire of the Dawn, the Church shares its name with a cult dedicated to the worship of the Outer God Nyarlaphotep. The Church revere the Stars and a strange oily black stone that fell from the sky made from the same material as the Seastone Chair, the Five Forts, Asshai and the ruined city of Yeen. It is said that the actions of the first High Priest lead to the Long Night.  
  
Star cults, necromicon quotes and alien cities, is Westeros in the Cthulhu Mythos?  
  
Probably not. These were probably just references but a man can dream.

But why then? What was he doing until that moment? That letter was probably the most important political tool in his arsenal, but he deployed it too late and lost much because of it. 


Take Robb, for example, sitting in Riverrun with the Riverlords and the Northmen trying to decide what to do next. As of this moment, they do not know that Joffrey is a bastard or that Jamie and Cersei are having an affair. Ned Stark figured it out in the capital after Catelyn left and he had no opportunity to tell her or Robb. So, right now, they think that by the laws of succession, Joffrey is the legitimate king - but they obviously can't acknowledge him. Tommen would be the next logical choice, but he isn't even making a claim. Not to mention, with either Joffrey or Tommen, the Crown remains in control of the Lannisters with whom they are currently at war. 


The next logical choice is Stannis, but he doesn't have much of an army or much of a chance at winning. Renly has an army but he has his own set of problems including having the weakest claim and the rumors about his sexuality. The lords here are facing a dilemma - either they honor the line of succession, in which case, they'd have to bend the knee to the very person they are rebelling against or they throw it out of the window simply pick whoever they think is lesser of 2 evils, which sets a bad precedent. Left with no good choices, they opt for option 3 and declare independence. 


I don't think Robb's court was alone in this dilemma. Lords throughout the kingdom - but especially in the Stormlands and Reach - would be facing similar choice. The Lannisters have a poor reputation throughout the seven kingdoms. Tywin is reviled as ruthless and tyrannical (his actions at Castamere, at King's Landing and with Targaryen children cemented his reputation), Cersei isn't particularly loved as a Queen, Jamie is reviled as a kingslayer, Tyrion is the whoring imp and Joffrey is unstable as proven by his execution of Ned Stark - a man almost universally admired. If Joffrey or Tommen remain on throne, the Lannisters remain in charge, which is something nobody wants. The other two options aren't particularly attractive and it does set a bad precedent, but given Renly's politicking and personal charm, he'd be seen by many as the lesser of two evils. After all, if you are going to ignore the line of succession, why care about Stannis being the eldest?


This is the point where Stannis' letter would've been crucial. It'd have given them the out and the direction they needed. They could get the Lannisters out while still maintaining the line of succession. But Stannis didn't send the letter until it was too late and by that time the lords had already declared for one king or the other. Sure, the Tyrells would've still supported Renly, but Stannis could've gained quite a few Reach lords and Storm lords. And all of North and Riverlands. But the die had been cast and there was no squirting the cream back up the udder. 


Compare his actions to that of Queen Alicent during Dance of Dragons. In order to place her son on the throne over the heir presumptive Princess, the queen moved swiftly before the king was even cold. She stopped all information about the king's death from getting out, secured the small council to her side, put a crown on her son's head and started sending ravens to lords all over the place affirming their support. She moved quickly and decisively and made major political moves before the opposite side even knew that the king was dead. Speed is the key and if you wait too long, you lose out on supporters. 


So why was Stannis just sitting there instead of fighting the war of quills and ravens? The king was certainly dead long enough - Robb Stark had the time to get the news, then find out about his father, call the banners, march South and fight a couple of battles. And let's not forget that Stannis was the first to figure out that Joffrey was a bastard. I can't fathom why he wouldn't send that letter to the Lords as soon as he heard that Robert was dead. Was he waiting for someone to invite him to the Iron Throne? ",17,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

I honestly hope this to be the case. Imo that's the only way for the show and thr story to maintain integrity. 

I can't help but think of how unstoppable Dany and her army have become... how it couldn't be more clear that westeros is hers for the taking. Anyone who has watched these 1st 6 seasons of the show can see that even the combined power of cersei and house lannister, Euron and whatever bunch of thugs he can round up, and even the north (which I don't see joining anyway) would really be no match for the mother of dragons and all she brings with her. 

I also can't help but think... how totally awful it would be if Euron Greyjoy just shows up with some massive fleet, or even worse some kind of magical weapon , or item that can control dragons for himself and all of a sudden is able to stand toe to toe with the massive force Dany has strived to build for the last 6 years. In short, it would be the silliest, most unbelievable thing in Got history... the 1st example of downright STUPID storytelling. 

He's supposed to be essentislly swatted away like the gnat that he clearly is... I'm fine if he takes down a couple ships before he dies... or even somehow manages to take a big name character down with him. But that's it. In short... if Euron is presented as a real legitimate threat to danearys and her armies... that would seriously be just too ridiculous to handle... not that I BELIEVE the showrunners would actually attempt to force a contrived plot like that down their audiences collective throat... I have more faith in them than that... but still, there are rumors online of him having some kind of horn that he can blow on and become all powerful magically or something... so it's got me worried. I hope it's not true.. that'd be enough to ruin this entire season real quick. 

What do you guys think? Am I worried over nothing? Surely you all agree that Euron is just as weak and pathetic as every bit of information we've been given thus far suggests?? ... right?",81,18,False,spoiler,,,,,

While I do believe that he will be fighting the final battle and his story will be the most interesting. The ending will surprise everyone which is GRRM style.

Bran Stark is The Last Hero: The Last Hero went to the far north when WW came and somehow received help from the Children of the Fores. Apparently, Bran did the same.

Bran Stark is Azor Ahai: Some say that Azor Ahai and The Last Hero are same. There was a theory that when Bran escaped Winterfell after Theon had sacked it, he escaped through crypts of Winterfell and there was all smoke. He also sacrificed Jojen, Summer and Hodor. Bran will wake a dragon under Winterfell.

Bran Stark is Lord of The Light: Bran creates an alternative timeline where he whispers to certain people to prepare for the fight against WW. Red priests hear him in flames.

Bran Stark is Bran The Builder: This is likely to be true. Bran time travels to build the wall against WW.

Bran Stark is 3rd head of dragon: You will not walk again, but you will fly.

Bran Stark is 3ER: They both are the same person.

Bran Stark is Night King: This is the craziest theory and could turn out to be a deadly twist in GOT.

Do you think this is because Robb is choosing to mistakenly execute a man just as theon did? Do you think they are trying to make a parallel between the two Or is it just fitting music? Interestingly, both executions take place in the rain.

I'm not complaining because the soundtrack sounds perfectly dramatic and ominous. Anyway, just a cool thing I noticed.

(I may say some disagreeable things, so feel free to discuss down below)

1. Her invasion is exactly that, an invaison:
 -Dany hasn't spent a day in Westeros, has gathered an army of foreigners to plunder their way across a foreign nation to seize power. Whether she will liberate or annihilate is a personal belief for now.


2. The people in her invaison: The unsullied are viewed as vile in Westeros, barely even alive in their eyes. They are unfeeling to a great extent and don't follow any pleasures in an opposite manner to the decadence of the Westerosi. The Dothraki are literally pillaging rapists, slavers and murderers. A terrifying wave of death that people fear all around the world due to their complete absence of humanity. She keeps the counsel of the most hated exiled men of Westerns,  and allies with the Greyjoy Raiders (hated), the Reach (viewed as vultures) and Dorne (kinslayers and let's be honest, everyone in Westerns already kinda hates the Dornish).


3. Giant-ass firebreathung dragons: OKAY, I know the dragons are incredible but let's step back. These things literally forged the 7 kingdoms 300 years ago, melt steel, flesh and stone without a damn problem. And worst of all? Dany has taught them to eat human flesh with the feedings of her enemies. These things literally look like demons to the exhausted people of Westeros. They are not cool to anyone else other than the viewers.

4. And lastly; Her plan to ""break the wheel"": We don't really know what this is, but it can be assumed she will either surrender power to the people, work to undermine the might of each Lord Paramount or all together remove the lords and declare herself the one and only important Liege in Westeros. The problem is that the entire society is built on this system, it's what fuels their honour and dignity. It's the reason lords and small folk alike died. You can't really take that away after around... 4 civil wars in 20 years?


It seems to me that a plundering army of foreigners lead by a girl with a hated name and flying demons isn't the picture of a hero, it seems like the picture of a villain... (plus they all wear black so I mean)...


Once again this was just the way I interpreted it. I don't think she'd necessarily be a bad ruler, just that it's reeeeaaaally not a good time or fashion in which to reach that goal. Hell she freed a city of slaves from their chains and they still hated her lmao


Feel free to discuss, I love talking about characters and motivations :D",23,28,False,spoiler,,,,,

In season one, Gendry says he doesn't know his mother, just that she had blonde hair. 

In season one, Cersei tells Cat that she lost a son at birth (or shortly after I can't remember), and he had black hair. 

Is it possible Cersei was pregnant with Robert's child instead of Jaime's and when she saw his black hair, she gave him away after the birth?

This would make Gendry's blood ""stronger"" in the Lord of Light's eyes certainly, as he's the true heir to Robert and not the king's bastard. His blood was clearly strong enough as all 3 of the blood slug kings that he was used for would eventually die. 

Why Cersei would do it: she didn't want children with Robert, just Jaime, and certainly wanted the heir to Robert to be a full Lannister. Robert would go off on hunts when she was about to give birth so she wouldn't have to do much besides have other Lannister who are loyal to her be in the room when the child was born. She would seem psycho enough to just kill the child but I can't remember her reaction when all of Robert's bastards were murdered by Joffrey.

Just before the Battle of Blackwater Bay, Brown is singing, drinking, and whoring with some Lannister soldiers in a cheap inn or brothel in King's Landing. Clegane enters the brothel, gets a horn of brown ale; but despite Bronn's welcome he is nasty towards him. Nasty enough that Bronn feels threatened enough to put his hand on his back dagger.
Why this animosity of the Hound towards Bronn? They had no interaction till then (and none in the future), were on the same side (serving the Lannister's) and there was enough of a fight in the future to release rivers of testosterone. Bronn was commander of the city guard, so an attack on him was also an attack on whoever gave him that authority (in this case Tyrion). Seems a lot of trouble to get into just to vent some fury.

So why did the Hound pick a fight with Bronn?",16,7,False,spoiler,,,,,

I'm talking, ofcourse, about the executions of Lord Karstark and Mossador respectively. 


Executing those two in that context was not the politically savvy choice - something both Robb and Dany were well aware of. Both characters had the public sympathy on their side and became martyrs to their sympathizers in their death. Robb and Dany, on the other hand, would come off looking too harsh and cruel. Sparing them would've been the smart move, but it'd have also meant ignoring what is just. 

That comes with its own set of problems. Yes, they'd both come off looking weak - someone who can't control their own subjects. That's never a good thing for a ruler, but there is more to it. A ruler is supposed to be the champion of law and justice. His subjects rely on it and derive a certain sense of security from it. A ruler who doesn't respect the law can simply take away whatever he wants from you on a whim. Sure, he may be dismissing the law in your favor this time, but he could just as easily dismiss it in his own favor in the future. That's why its important for a ruler to uphold law and justice - so that his subjects don't keep getting insecure and rebelling against him. 


In this case, there was a prize to be paid either way - a politically expedient choice with long-term negative consequences or the legal choice with short-term but crucial loss of support. 


But maybe there was no need for the dilemma at all. Why wouldn't the law already have a middle ground written into it? A form of punishment that is harsh enough to uphold justice, but soft enough so as not to alienate the public? Robb and Dany couldn't have been the first rulers to have found themselves in such a position. It makes practical sense for their predecessors to have included a loophole in the legal code itself - for themselves and the future generations. Yes, I know that being sent to the wall seems like a good middle ground, but the prisoner has to request it as a formal plea of mercy. A ruler cannot mete out that punishment at his own discretion (and Dany can't send people to the Wall anyway).   


It seems like a glaring oversight for the lawmakers of Westeros to have not included this middle ground in the law itself. Something like life-imprisonment or loss of limb or something else that is left up to the judge's discretion - so that the judge in question can uphold the law without committing political suicide.

Personally, I think a lot of the hate Clarke gets is unwarranted. No, she may not be as sophisticated and refined an actor as say Charles Dance, Peter Dinklage or Lena Headey but she has made this role her own and I honestly couldn't imagine anyone else playing the mother of dragons. It has been great to watch Clarke's range in the role - from an innocent young girl to a confident and at times brash ruler, playing both sides of Dany with believability and with clear dedication to the character. While many tend to criticize her delivery in some lines (""Where are my dragons?!""), she can convey her emotion beautifully when needed. the best example of this is her interaction with dragons where she's required to prove a heartfelt relationship between herself and basically green balls, usually without much dialogue. And she does it. She pulls it off. 

Here's one of favorite scenes that allows the emotional side of Dany to really shine - something that I think should be done more going forward. **Clarke is a good actress. Nuff said.**

A few on here might have grown watching Samurai Jack but I'm unsure anyone knows that the final season was aired this year. So spoilers for that too.
So hear this patiently.
Across both universes, different lands have people with their own unique set of habits, accents and traditions, that too, being not far away from each other too much.
They all face one common threat in the name of The Night King/ Aku.
Most of them seriously ignore this threat, some of them fight it off when it poses as a threat.
Jack is a mix of Azor Ahai &amp; Jon Snow. He travels all these lands and interacts with people, helps them and considers all equal, while looking at the bigger picture, just like Jon. He also carries the katana, which is the only sword that can kill Aku, which is remarkably similar to the Azor Ahai prophecy. Jack's sword was forged by gods, the Azor Ahai one was due to the sacrifice of a loved one.
Now for spoilers.
There comes a moment when Jack is captured by Aku, thanks to Aku being able to take control of his daughter Ashi, who wanted to be free of will and helped Jack in the last season. This sounds so much so similar to the White Walkers.
During this time, all the different kinds of people unite to help out Jack. Here's when I feel like Westeros will unite as one to help out Jon
In the last episode, when Ashi frees herself of Aku's control, she time travels with Jack into the past, an ability like her father, to go back and kill him. Ashi obviously disappears after that, but the problem is gone forever.
Here's where it sounds strikingly similar to Bran's time traveling capabilities. I believe in the end, he ends up being the Night King by going back in time, or helps Jon (or Ser Daavos if you believe him to be Azor Ahai) to get back and kill the problem.
The most funny part is that both stories were written along the same time and it makes me happy to have been born in the 90s, where people could write such amazing stuff.

Best Ending: Jon and Daenerys defeat the coming darkness the white walkers and Jon and Daenerys marry and make out and seat the iron throne with Tyrion as lord of Casterly Rock, Arya is married to Gendry and is hand of the king and queen, Sansa is Warden of the North and the Vale, And everything is fine and Targaryens rule once more and win the game of thrones.

Worst Ending: Night King and the white walkers kill everyone Cersei Is made the night queen, Night King sits the throne, Sansa is made into a lady Stoneheart and kills all north bannermen, and Arya, bran, Sam, Gilly, Little Sam, and Bronn are forced to flee to Essos. (even the Worst Ending's need a spark of hope)

Second Worst ending: The Lannisters win. Cersei blows up the Red keep with the Night king and his others in there and she is at a safe area. Then she has Jon executed, Qyburn is still hand, Cersei is still queen and poisons Jaime, Daenerys is forced into the life of a Peasant, WF is destroyed with wildfire with Brienne, Pod, Bran, Meera, Sansa, and Lyanna Mormont in there, and Tyrion, Arya, Gendry, Sam, Gilly, and Little Sam leave to Essos (like I said even the worst endings need a spark of hope).

How I personally think it will end: Daenerys will go mad after losing most of her allies and Drogon and the fact she is the mad king's child and will imprison Arya and gendry and Hang Brienne, Pod, Bronn, and Sansa.

First, for context, the text post I saw about the Hound was an argument that he was the most chivalrous and ""knightly"" of all the knights he is surrounded with. He displays the most care for the weak and puts his own moral code above the oaths that he takes, even if he has unconventional methods and is ugly on the surface (and appears to have an ugly personality through some characters' eyes). I really connected with this post, and paid attention to Sandor's behavior throughout the first season.

Starting with Micah, though it does seem rash to think that killing him would be less despicable than bringing him back alive, there was no way to know what Joffrey or Cersei could have insisted upon this child's punishment being. As it is he feigned a more severe injury, Sansa did not back her family, and ultimately Robert sided with his wife and didn't think the direwolves should be pets. Bring Micah into this equation, and the fact that he's the butcher's boy, and things would not have ended well for him. I think the Hound's chivalry could be argued using this example, but still I believe he acted with good intentions, knowing the cruelty of his master. 

The first real example of his chivalry is during the Hand's Tourney, when Loras defeats Ser Gregor. It's clear that Gregor is a Hulk-like force that does not care about consequences. He would have killed Loras no question if the Hound had not defended him. Loras was in a defenseless position, and the Hound went to his defense as soon as it was clear he did not understand or notice what was going to happen. 

In S1e10, there are two examples. 

The first, in court, when the singer's tongue is getting cut out. The Hound walks up the steps and into the camera's view. Upon a rewatch, I believe that he was trying to shield Sansa from seeing this unwarranted violence. Joffrey has asked Sansa to come with him, and the Hound ensures she does, but also hides this violence from her view. Then, shortly after the infamous be-ned-ing incident, Joffrey shows Sansa her father and her only allies' heads on spikes. Ser Meryn slaps her and she starts bleeding. When she takes a purposeful step towards Joffrey to push him over the side of the walkway, Sandor steps in front of her, dabs at the blood, and helps her, allowing her to keep his handkerchief. He cannot outright defend her or stop her from getting hurt, but it seems he is doing all he can to prevent her from suffering further. 

TL;DR The Hound is much more chivalrous than any other knight, particularly to Sansa (who only wanted to be treated like a proper lady should), despite constantly stating he is ""no Ser."" ",29,54,False,spoiler,,,,,

In the books, Tywin has a quote - ""When your enemies defy you, you must serve them steel and fire. When they go to their knees, however, you must help them back to their feet. Elsewise no man will ever bend the knee to you."" 


The lesson he is trying to teach Joffrey here has a sound political logic behind it. If your enemies think that they are going to be killed if they lose, then they are going to keep fighting to the bitter end. Which means you'd have to keep fighting them and keep draining your own resources to do so. Much better to leave them an out - let them know that the option of surrender won't be all bad. Being magnanimous, merciful and gracious in victory is a good way to establish this reputation. 


Its ironic then that Tywin's reputation in Westeros is completely opposite. He is regarded as most as a merciless and ruthless hardliner who won't show compassion to defeated enemies. Yes, it started with him completely eradicating the houses of Reyne and Tarbeck. He didn't even spare servants, women or children who were innocent of any wrongdoing. The sack of King's Landing where several civilians were killed and women raped further cemented his reputation. Killing the Targaryen children didn't help any. And then there was beheading Ned Stark - which wasn't his choice, but spoke to his reputation as well. Now, you could make excuses as to why he needed to make those particular choices in those situations - and maybe those would be justified - but they all had the effect of making him look ruthless. And he didn't do anything to mitigate that image either. 


A ruler has to balance showing strength and showing mercy in equal measure. Too much strength and you are despised as harsh and cruel. Too much mercy and you are reviled as weak and ineffectual. Tywin's father was on the opposite side of the spectrum - he was too weak of a ruler. Tywin was so afraid of looking weak that he reveled in looking strong, apparently not realizing the possible political cost of such an image. 


In season 3, everyone, including the Northerners, could see that Robb was at a major disadvantage. He was facing the combined Tyrell-Lannister host, he'd lost the North and he was hemorrhaging men due to his political missteps. This was the moment Robb would've seriously considered any peace proposal. But Tywin's reputation made that seem impossible. 


This was also the moment for Tywin to practice what he preached. He was in a clear position of strength - offer peace now and he comes off looking good and merciful and Robb's bannermne might simply lose the momentum for war. But there were no peace offers on the table. What else could they do but keep fighting? Even after the Red Wedding, he could've projected a gracious and charitable image. He could've helped restore the Riverlands which had been ravaged by the war and he could've helped with expelling the Ironborn from North. Instead, he left the North to the Boltons and his men kept raping and pillaging through the Riverlands unabated. Even without a second uprising, this sowed the seeds for further war - like Blackfish retaking Riverrun and Boltons being displaced in the North which has yet again declared its independence. 


Its hard to believe that someone who is supposed to be one of the most politically savvy people in Westeros could be so blind about the detriment his own image would cause. If only he'd been less concerned with appearing strong and more concerned with how he should appear, perhaps the war could've ended with a lot less bloodshed and a lot less dishonor.

The second time I realized that It was going to be nearly impossible to watch on a big screen because I live with my parents and I was quite young at the time. The couple of times since, I tried but never made it past Season 1 episode 3.

I started feeling that I would need catch up and it was just so overhyped that the show couldn't match the hype. So I accepted the fact that I would be a social pariah and embrace the counterculture. (I have also not seen Star Wars and LOTR for similar reasons)
 Some friends suggested skipping the first season. I don't like doing that. Now, I have binged the entire series in around 8 days. (Barely any sleep) And I LOVE IT!!!!!

Good enough for characters from GoT to learn from. 

One is where Caesar has an advantage in war over Pompey, but instead of attacking, sends him terms of truce. Terms that would be unacceptable to Pompey, but acceptable to his allies. It'd end up creating division among them and would have the advantage of making Caesar look like a reasonable peacemaker and Pompey, if he refuses, a warmonger. 


Another was when a subordinate disobeyed order but his subsequent actions gained him significant public sympathy. I think Caesar's quote sums it up pretty well: ""You present me with a dilemma. By right, I could have you thrown off the Tarpeien rock. But people, simple souls that they are, have made a great hero of you. If I were to punish you the people would be made extremely angry. I do not wish to make the people angry, ergo I cannot punish you. If I cannot punish you, I must reward you, else I shall seem weak."" Basically, Dany could've learned from this when deciding what to do with Mossador. 


And then there was Octavian who played up the rhetoric of Antony becoming an Egyptian in order to justify going to war with him. The phrase ""He worships dogs and crocodiles"" was used in his public denunciation. I'm surprised Renly didn't play up Stannis' new religion to legitimize his own claim. It'd have been a great narrative for him - Stannis gave up right to be king when he gave up the Faith - the official religion of Westeros.

The Starks are higher than ever.**
""It is less about the quarrels between the families,"" says Sophie Turner. ""There is a bigger picture. There's more at stake this season, with the threat of the White Walkers growing."" So we are going to see characters uniting, in some rather crowd-pleasing ways. "" People who you've always rooted for to meet, and you didn't know if they'd get along, are meeting in order to form alliances.""

**2. We're getting fewer episodes, but just as much action.**
Orginally, D&amp;amp;D planned a seven-season structure. But now they've pushed to eight, with the final two seasons slightly shorter. ""It's only seven episodes, but we still spent the same time on them,"" says Pilou Asbk, who plays psycho-Viking Euron Greyjoy. ""They have really raised the bar with the production values.""

**3. We're watching it later in the year for a good reason.**
What was once a spring treat is now a summertime one. But only because the arrival of winter in Westeros meant pushing location shoots later, ""so we could get some grim, grey weather even in the sunnier places we shoot."" Gemma Whelan, the seafaring Yara, didn't 'enjoy' as much studio time as Cunningham. ""They needed the darkness so much,"" she says, ""but you're looked after well, even if you're in the water for a long time. We're taken career with foil blankets.""

**4. Sansa's not 100% on Team Snow.**
""Team Snow? I don't like that,"" says Turner. ""I'm on Team Stark."" For all her talk of alliances, there's a suggestion that Sansa isn't hugely comfortable with the fact that Jon is in charge. ""She has this newfound power, but not as much as Jon. This season's all about her struggles with that.""

**5. There's tension between Cersei and Jame.**
Nikolaj Coster-Waldau drops hints about Cersei considering suitors, and Jaime having to ""step up and take his father's place."" So while the might mean he becomes Cersei's Hand, it doesn't spun like he's happy with the situation. Plus, on-set photography has revealed that, while the Queen's got a new black-and-silver look, Jaime's still very much in Lannister red-and-gold. It hardly feels like a house united.

**6. The Hound's getting 'sociable'.**
For Rory McCann, being Sandor Clegane has often felt like being ""on a road trip on my own."" But for Season 7, he's says, "" I've been socialising and working with more actors, which was a good thing."" It remains to be seen how many of those actors are playing people Clegane will back to death; this season has been McCann's most physically strenuous yet. ""I think my body can only take one more season. I'm sore,"" he's laughs.

**7. There's no reunion for Jon and Sam.**
""Jon and Sam have said goodbye a lot,"" says John Bradley. ""But you felt there was finality to that last goodbye between them. This season I've never felt more cast into wilderness, really."" Though it's wilderness of bookshelves, as Sam has arrived at the Citadel. Chances are, he'll be spending a chunk of his scenes with Jim Broadbent, who joins the cast this season as Archmaester Marwyn.

**8. Euron Greyjoy's going to out-bastard Ramsay Bolton.**
If you were worried that the grisly, dog-inflicted death of Ramsay would leave the show short of a proper-psycho, then Asbk is here too assure you. ""The psychos I've encountered have so many different sides to them,"" the Danish adore explains. ""So each scene I've done with Euron, I pick a new thing I wanna show. 'This scene I wanna be charming.' 'This scene I was a be a molester.' 'This scene I wanna kill someone.'"" He grins. ""After this season, Ramsay's gonna look like a little kid...""

**9. Bran's sitting on a huge secret.**
Bran's psychic time-travelling 'greensight' revealed the tue nature of Jon's birth and his real name: Jaehaerys Targaryen. ""Bran's now in this precarious situation in which it's just home and Meera, and he has a.l this information that could change the entire story,"" says Hempstead Wright. And it's not just about Jon. ""He knows about the origin of the White Walkers, too.""

**10. Ed Sheeran's in it.**
Why? Because Maisie Williams is a fan and D&amp;amp;D thought it'd be a nice treat for her. ""I do a scene with Maisie,"" Sheeran told The Hits Radio recently. ""I sing and she goes, 'Oh, that's a nice song...'""

**11. Melisandre's not licked yet.**
For Carice van Houten, playing fanatical seductress Melisandre was never more satisfying then when the last season revealed her vulnerable side. ""I was almost crying,"" she says. ""That never happened before."" But, though the priestess is banished by Jon, she's still in the game and regaining her strength.

**12. Daenerys has a new throne.**
The throne on Dragonstone.

**13. The cast now have a strong sense of an ending.**
Though there's still six more episodes to come next year, the actors are already feeling the sweep of the final curtain. ""It's terrifying,"" says Turner. ""I'm really sad to leave Sansa behind. Though it'll mean I can change my hair colour to black now, or cut it chin length..."" And it's not just the cast who are worried. ""My bank manager is ducking shitting himself!"" laughs Cunningham.

**14. There won't be unicorns.**
Protecting secrets, Daniel Portman (Pod) and Jacob Anderson (Grey Worm) have a simple technique. ""When people ask me what's happening,"" says Portman, ""I just lie. That's the best way to avoid trouble."" Anderson's more specific. ""I just tell them, 'There's gonna be unicorns this year. Purple unicorns...'""

**15. But there will be spin-offs.**
There's five scripts being developed on at HBO, all prequels. Though some of the cast have their own ideas. ""Grey Worm and Pod!"" cries Portman. ""Send these two characters off and just watch their wacky adventures unfold."" Anderson been has a them tune: ""Podrick and G-Dubs,"" he sings. ""Friends forever..."", while Hempstead Wright would prefer to see something that's ""all abut Bran. You could call it 'All-Bran'.""",165,181,False,spoiler,,,,,

So I just did an entire Game of Thrones re-watch, and noticed something during the ""Oathbreaker"" episode that I hadn't before.

Is there any significance for the twelve white walkers standing behind the Night King? I thought this was pretty symbolic of the ""twelve disciples/apostles"" chosen by Jesus. I'm not religious by any means, but even I couldn't help but notice the interesting choice of number.

Then at Hardhome, there were four White walkers on the cliff...all on horses. I couldn't have been the only person to have thought they symbolized the four horsemen of the apocalypse - which is another biblical reference.

I can understand the four horsemen reference - because Hardhome was a disaster aka apocalypse for the Wildlings (a little on the nose for symbolism - but I like it nonetheless). But why the twelve disciple reference? Or am I just reading into it too much?",16,23,False,spoiler,,,,,

But as soon as the gates were opened to him his army began killing civilians and raping women. Jamie Lannister stabbed the Mad King in the back and Gregor Clegane killed Elia Martell and the 2 Targaryen babes. Everyone sees this as a ruthless act of treachery and brutality. 


But why did Tywin really do it? Tywin's own explanation is that they were late to the party and they needed to prove their loyalty to the rebels. They needed to show Robert Baratheon that they were firmly on his side and they had cut off all Targaryen ties and this act was an effective way of doing that. While Tywin claims that the specifics of this massacre were not his intention, there is no doubt that the result was what he wanted. 


But Tywin's justification here doesn't sound right to me. Why would he feel the need to prove his loyalty at all? What did he imagine would happen if he had just stayed put and never moved?


Tywin wasn't the only Lord Paramount to have not declared his loyalty to Robert. The Greyjoys had stayed neutral as well (apart from some opportunistic raiding which was typical of them). The Tyrells and Martells had fought on the Targaryen side - Tywin definitely would've been better off than them. Robert had no personal enmity with Tywin, so Tywin had no reason to worry about reprisals for not supporting his side. And after the war, Robert's armies were depleted, whereas Tywin's were still fresh. Robert was the one likely to be more interested in preserving peace. Basically, if Tywin had simply stay put, Robert would've been the one coming to him asking him for his loyalty and to bend the knee - and Tywin could've extracted a price for that. Withholding his loyalty and keeping his options open gives Tywin more bargaining power and I can see no advantage to giving it away without a deal in place. Robert could've just as easily decided to give him nothing - given that he already had Tywin's loyalty. (Cersei you say? I'll get to that later)


Sacking the city doesn't make sense for other reasons as well. Robert wanted to rule the city, not destroy it. Sacking it would set the people against the ""invaders"" - instead of being seen as saviors from the Mad King they risked being seen as oppressors themselves. Having an intact capital to begin his rule would've been good for Robert and Tywin did not serve him well by brutalizing it instead. And let's not even start on what might've happened if Aerys hadn't opened the gates. 


But maybe Tywin wanted to get on the ground floor of the rebellion - belated though it was. Maybe he thought that by firmly aligning himself with the rebels he'd get to share in their gains. But again, he should be smart enough to know what this move would look like. It'd be seen as sucking up to the winning side and he wasn't likely to get a lot out of it. Which, as it happened, he didn't. 


Now, let's look at what he actually gained from this action. A royal marriage for Cersei and Jamie staying in the Kingsguard. It seems to me that he'd have gained that anyway - even if he didn't attack KL. Robert had already shown himself to be gracious and merciful in victory by sending his own Maesters to tend to Barristan Selmy. In fact, his move was likely to endanger Jamie, who was effectively a hostage under Aerys. There is no way Tywin could've known that Aerys would ask Jamie to bring him Tywin's head, instead of sending him Jamie's. And since the Victors would've needed some way to bring Westerlands back into the fold, the best way to do that would've been through marriage. Tywin was already looking at a probable political marriage for Cersei. Since Lyanna was supposedly still alive and betrothed to Robert, Cersei would've either married Edmure Tully or Stannis Baratheon. That was the best Tywin could hope for at the moment. And once Lyanna turned up dead, Cersei was the only eligible match of standing left for Robert, so she'd have ended up Queen anyway. Apart from that, Tywin didn't gain any prestigious appointments, he wasn't named Hand or Master of Coin and Robert's brothers took the other posts. Tywin couldn't have expected to be named to these high posts above Robert's existing friends and family and he wasn't. Whatever he gained from his actions could've been gained without doing anything at all. 


So, what's missing here? Why would Tywin take this risk with nothing to gain when doing nothing held the same reward and less potential loss? Why would he sully his reputation just to prove his loyalty that nobody bought anyway? Was Tywin just looking for some spiteful revenge here? Payback for years of insults that he cloaked in the guise of ""doing it for the family""? ",29,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

I've been thinking a lot about how the show loves repeating events and correlations between the history of Westeros and what's happening in the current timeline. 

It would be remarkably cool if that Bastard of Robert and the ""Bastard of Ned"" led a rebellion in the same fashion that their ""Fathers"" had. This would likewise conclude with many believing Jon should take the throne, but him wanting no part in it. It would be very similar the circumstances of which Robert got the throne originally.

Whether Dany or Cersei plays the part of the mad queen remains to be seen, but I think that its not out of the question that Arya could be kidnapped as she tries to kill cersei. Creating a very ""Lyanna"" type situation that puts the whole thing in motion. 

What do you think? I think GoT loves repeating events from a new perspective. I this could all work really well.

Why?

1) They have always stayed in power from Season 1 to now. Face it: Cersei has never left King's Landing, apart from that time where she went to Winterfell in Season 1. She is tied to King's Landing. Although she's lost all her children she hasn't lost power.


2) The Starks have always been their biggest rivals, as seen when Robb Stark challenged the throne. But ultimately, they have always failed. Ned Stark is beheaded. Robb Stark dies to the Freys, paid by Lannisters. Bran Stark almost died from falling from the tower. Conclusion: When there is a Stark v Lannister encounter, Lannisters will ultimately prevail.


This means that Jon will not win his war against Cersei. He is doomed to fail, because his entire family has failed until now. It is like a dream that will never happen, no matter how strong the dream is.


3) Daenarys has no chance. Why? Conquering the west has always been a symbol, perhaps a reflection of the spanish conquistadores in America. But it will never work. Do you remember at the end of each season, almost all seasons end with a scene on the continent of Essos, whether its Daenarys and the dothraki, or Daenerys and the Unsullied or Daenerys with her dragons, every time the series is screaming at us: 'she is coming to Westeros sooner and sooner, be careful!'. Well what if it will never happen. I expect her not to make it there. I think there will be a shipwreck or something, or a disaster, or she will lose to Euron Greyjoy or something. It is like the Stark dream: it will never succeed, no matter how long you set it up for. You'll argue: yes but look at her army and dragons, she will win. I answer: when the Lannisters were doomed to fail - what happened? At Blackwater, they eventually won. They eventually beat Robb Stark even though they were losing battles. And Cersei eventually beat the Tyrells and all other odds and threats. There is no way Daenerys will somehow 'pierce' through this. No. She will fail.


My conclusion: Jon and Daenerys will lose rapidly to Lannisters, and the Lannisters will have to face the White Walkers. I expect Lannisters to win and Cersei to end the show alive, as Queen.",24,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

In one of the very first episodes we meet Ros (the red head girl throne was with) and at the end of the episode she rides off in a cart to Kings Landing.

Now it may be because there are so many explicit sex scenes that tend to involve women of the worlds oldest profession, but I never noticed how many pivotal scenes that Ros is in. She is there when the gold cloaks are rounding up/murdering Roberts Bastards, she is there when Joffrey makes her torture the other girl on his birthday, and she even has a couple conversations with Little Finger that really help develop his character.

These by themselves don't seem like a big deal, but Game of Thrones is not a show that just throws things out there for no reason.

1886,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2017-6-17,2017,6,17,6,6hpfb5,self.gameofthrones,[EVERYTHING] Theory on Littlefinger for S7.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/6hpfb5/everything_theory_on_littlefinger_for_s7/,MaximusNerdius,1497647728,"I have been trying to think about how Littlefinger might get taken out and I think I found a hint  It is actually given to us in [Season 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3PSTvAbfac&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=78) and triggered at the end of season 6.

Lady Olena knows the truth about the murder of Joffrey and certainly can implicate Littlefinger especially with the help of Tyrion.  Through Vary's little birds the truth of the purple wedding will reach Kings Landing and as a result the little birds will tell Qyburn who will tell Cersei.  Since LF says he has declared for the Starks it would give Cersei all the reason she needed to believe it since he is with Sansa and word came from Olenna who is with Tyrion and she thinks them both guilty.

Cersei could take away his title of warden of the east and lord of harrenhall and the vale.  She might even send troops after him not caring about the cost in money of military strength which then weakens her elsewhere perhaps even at home when other invaders arrive.  When this happens it would give Sansa no reason to hold the truth about the death of her aunt Lysa from the other lords of the vale or Robyn himself who Sansa can assuredly manipulate to her favor.  

From here Littlefinger has no lands no titles and no army.  He is clever though so he will likely run or try to use his use of the vale knights to help the Starks now when Lysa wouldn't earlier to justify his actions and retain his hold on power but word of not only his involvement with the purple wedding will get out but Varys and the Hound could also be 2 sources of info about his betrayal of Ned.  When word of that gets out he will be the most hunted man in the continents because I am sure once he is stripped of everything the iron bank will be looking for him as well.

This would be his greatest fall from the ladder into chaos from which he can't recover.  He would run then but perhaps Arya gets him since she knows all about him after her time in harrenhall and the word of his betrayals gets out.  She finds him at an inn and after he attempts to bargain for his life maybe by promising Arya something she might just kill him anyway citing his breaking of his promise to Ned and the shot we see of her looking for something is her looking for what LF promised her for his life.


I think everything except the Arya part is actually very possible/plausible.  The Arya part is just hoping for icing on a cake I'll probably won't get to eat.

tldr:  Lady O will use her knowledge of the purple wedding and Varys' network of little birds to trigger the spectacular downfall of Littlefinger.

edit:  To further the theory, it is rumored that a group from the north will go south to meet with Danny when she hits dragonstone.  Maybe as a means of trying to get dragonglass for the coming war, but Tyrion will be there who sent Janos Slynt to the wall.  Jon beheaded Slynt so there could be a conversation between the two since they were relatively friendly and he gets brought up, Jon asks why Tyrion sent him to the wall and he tells Jon why and when he finds out LF is in the north with them he tells Jon that LF literally held a knife to Neds throat.

Hell maybe the timing gets turned around and Jon finds out first and takes that knowledge back with him to the North.  LF denies it and that is when we see Jon grab him in the trailer perhaps while mourning his father in the crypts and LF comes to talk shit not knowing what Jon now knows.  When the Hound reaches them with the brotherhood he corroborates the story and bing bang boom there is Littlefinger's doom!",8,11,False,spoiler,,,,,

For sake of simplicity, let's assume that Aegon and Rhaenyra were still murdered by Tywin's men, but Stannis was able to take Dragonstone before Viserys and Danaerys escaped. So now, Robert is the king and Stannis is returning with 2 Targaryen children in his grasp - one of them a newborn girl. 

Would Robert murder them in cold blood? The obvious answer seems yes, definitely. He hates the Targaryens and they are forever a threat to his reign. Kill them as soon as possible and be done with it. 

But cooler heads may prevail here. Like Tywin said ""Robert saw himself as a hero in this story and heroes don't kill children"". Killing innocent children would definitely be a PR disaster and Robert doesn't need that so soon into his reign. Ned Stark, his best friend, is certain to counsel mercy. And Jon Arryn, his politically savvy mentor, is likely to do the same. After all, if Robert demands the death of children for the sins of their father, he is no different than the Mad King. There is a risk involved with keeping them alive, ofcourse. Any lord can, at any time, start a rebellion in the name of Viserys Targaryen, the third of his name. But that risk pales in comparison to the very tangible bad publicity of killing babies. 

There is advantage to keeping them alive as well. When they are suitably grown, Robert could marry them to his own children and then the legitimacy of his grandchildren would be iron-clad. Ofcourse, there is always the option of just killing Viserys and saving Dany for later. 


As I see it, Robert has 3 options:

1. Kill them as quickly an quietly as possible and hope that no one raises a fuss. 

2. Send them to an exile where they are expected to live out the rest of their lives. A particularly risky proposition if they were fall in the wrong hands. 

3. Hand them over to someone he trusts - someone who wouldn't use them as pawns against him - and raise them as wards. Given that Jon would be in the capital, a risky place to raise them and Robert doesn't like Stannis much, Ned would be the obvious choice for this. Ned would probably accept since it'd mean he could both keep the children safe from Robert and raise them not to have rebellious sentiments.


Given these options, which one do you think Robert would've chosen? Would stubbornness and hatred win out or would he listen to reason and sound advice coming from the 2 people he trusted the most? ",35,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

We all know the Starks and Direwolves have so much in common but i think its a lot more than that. 

I feel as if all the Stark Direwolves will die to men/beings that pledge their allegiance to the people that kill the Stark children. The evidence of the two stark children that have already died leads me to that. This also leads me to some assumptions of how the Stark children will die or not die.

Sansa(i feel Cersie will kill her) - Lady(dies at the hands of Ned on the orders of Robert/Cersie)
Rickon(Ramsay killed him) - Shaggydog(Umbers kill him)
Bran(i feel Bran will sacrifice himself to stop the Night King) - Summer(Wights kill him)
Arya(missing in the Riverlands)- Nymeria(missing in the Riverlands)
Jon(The White Wolf) - Ghost(accompanying jon as the white wolf)
Robb( killed by Walder Frey and Roose Bolton) - GreyWind(killed by Frey men)

Want Jon and Sansa to get married once R+L=J is revealed, as a way to firmly seal his place in the north.
As for Dany, she loses a nice chunk of her fleet when Euron blindsides (blindside with ships?) her. Euron will for sure marry Cersei as a way of sealing their alliance. Dany's army won't have an easy victory towards Kings Landing, and will only be defeated with Jon playing some role with reinforcements and such (in order for favor with dragons).

As for Dany, a drift comes when it is realized that they need her dragons in order fight the white walkers. It is during this time where Jorah returns, a cured man after Sam or someone at the citadel finds a working solution. Jorah will then marry Dany and take his place as the lord of Bear Island, taking the place of the little Lyanna (let her be a kid for once, jeez). I don't think a lot will happen with the white walkers this season, outside of them maybe breaching the wall due to something Bran does. Don't think a major fight will happen, outside of little interactions like the once we see in that trailer when it looks like Jon and them go beyond the wall.

Random deaths: all the sandsnakes, Bron, Grey Worm. Can't make guesses for bigger characters without saying how. Just curious what other people want to see.
PS. Want to see Arya and Gendry reunited. Also, looking forward to the reaction when the Hound and the B.W.O.B make it to the north and find Jon Snow. I want to see Sansa have a heartfelt reaction to the Hound, that way he and Brienne see eye to eye.

The Lannister takes one look at the unadorned statue of their law-giver sitting in the middle of the village and says, ""Great Chief, if you permit me to send a message home, I promise that a ship will return with enough gems to cover the statue of your most sacred law-giver and you will be the envy of Southros.

Even in far off Southerous they had indeed heard that a Lannister always pays his debts and the chief agreed to spare his life if the gems were delivered.

But this is mine, and it has never been told before:

Now, we all know that the top contenders for the throne are Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen, given that: Jon is the grandson of the Mad King, son of Rhaegar Targaryan and Lyanna Stark, and well, Daenerys is the daughter of the Mad King himself. Tyrion can also be one, if and only if he proves to be a Targaryen. 

1. Jon's character has been very much like Ned Stark, despite turning out to be only Ned's nephew and not his actual son. Ned was a man of honor, with no hopes for power and titles. Jon is very much the same. Also, he's taken the black, which means he's given up EVERYTHING and pledged his whole life to defend the land/Wall. Breaking this Oath will discredit him one way or another. Thus, he can no longer be King.
2. The last Targaryen King was usurped, we couldn't have possibly gone all this way only to end up bringing the throne back to solely just another Targaryen. Daenerys has the army and all to reclaim her place in Westeros, but someone has to be King. Also, it makes no sense to put Daenerys anywhere other than Queen considering this is all she's ever worked for the whole series and she isn't linked to anything else other than their House and the throne AND she has dragons, so... makes her Queen of Badassery and everything else LOL
3. Everyone seems to forget, that there is one more heir to the throne -- Gendry. 

I don't believe that Gendry was put in the series only to be Robert's bastard. There has to be some reason why his character IS Robert's bastard. I think Daenerys will legitimize Gendry giving him claim to the throne, and they will marry (the build-up to this: they will probably team up in the last two seasons) with Tyrion as the Hand of the King, considering his wit and intelligence. Gendry has had a hard life (not to mention he could also be Robert AND CERSEI's black-haired son who was known to be dead), which makes him one with the lowest of people. Also, House Baratheon was one of the major houses introduced in the series. It is emphasized every now and then that the house is extinct after the deaths of the Baratheon brothers. This union will bring the house back to life. 

So what happens to Jon? Jon, given the factors I mentioned above, will not and will not want to be King. BUT, he will turn out to be the Azor Ahai. The inclusion of the White Walkers in the plot, redirects the fight over the Iron Throne to the People of Westeros vs. the White Walkers, and it shall be the biggest battle. Jon will be the major savior, but his desire to live peacefully and keep his honor will make him decline his rightful place as King.

I've read the comments and people think Jon's watch ended with his first death, okay let's consider that. Maybe he will become King for a while, legitimize Gendry and give up the Crown to him. Whatever other factors there may be, I still think the ending will be: Gendry = King, Dany = Queen, Jon = Savior",11,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

Cat has known or known of Ned for years.  He has a reputation of being noble, loyal and honorable.  Ned bringing a bastard, just isnt him.  You'd think, him doing this would instantly raise eyebrows and everyone would know something isnt right.  
  
Yet, Cat believes this 100%, so much so that she ostracizes Jon.  Id atleast think she would have doubts.  As the years pass and Ned being Ned, this is his only blemish.  Before Jon goes to the wall, why wouldng Cat reflect on Ned and Jon and think maybe its not as it seems.

""Its also interesting to me that the possible war crime Daenerys commits in Meereen is sometimes cited as an example of her madness whereas the war crimes of others such as Tywin Lannister are often lauded by some fans of ASOIAF as necessary evils to maintain order. My opinion of this is that Daenerys is viewed in a negative light because of the cultural constructs that we have for gender roles  Women are traditionally nurturers and those that break their societal role are labeled as hysterical or mad.""

Is this really the case for the female characters of GoT? It certainly rings true with both Cersei and Danaerys. Were some of their actions horrific? Yes. Were they ill-conceived and without long-term benefits? Sure. Were they insane? I don't see that. Similar actions from a male character would be seen as cruel and ruthless, but not insane. 

Yes, actions of Joffrey and Ramsay do go into the ""mad"" territory. And yes, Lysa is crazy with her obsession with Baelish. But nothing Dany or Cersei did seems to rise to that level of madness. Is it really just latent sexism on the fans' part that sees them as Mad Queens?  ",45,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

Will he die by Cersei's direction? 

Let's hope not but unlike a few other remaining characters there's definitely an argument that he could die this season and still feel like his story has run it's course. 

It'd be a shame (shame..shame..shame) to see but far from impossible. ",29,23,False,spoiler,,,,,

So we all know at the end of Roberts rebellion Jaime Lannister killed the mad king to save the city from being engulfed in wildfire. Shortly after Ned Stark stormed through the throne room doors and judged Jaime for breaking his sacred vows

Well how cool would it be if perhaps Jon Snow and daenerys team up in S7 or S8 to overthrow cersei. 

A major battle takes place in kings landing, as cersei knows she is losing she orders qyburn to set off the wildfire all around the city. Jaime then is again forced to kill cersei because of it. This time Jaime distraught from what he just did. It's Jon snow who storms through the throne room doors. But instead of judging Jaime, Jon wants to kill him for all the torment the lannisters have done to the starks past seasons.

It would bean awesome parallel and an incredibly emotional scene for viewers. Jon and Ned have had a # of parallels past few seasons so this would be a great one to add.",4,56,False,spoiler,,,,,

1. Unpredictability - I don't want to know exactly where this season is going. I want there to be some unexpected moments and surprises.

2. A big white walker reveal - I'm really hoping we don't get generic evil white walkers trying to kill a bunch of humans. Hopefully we'll get a great and surprising reveal about what they are trying to achieve.

3. No questionable writing - There were a few instances of stupidity in season 6. You had those moments with Arya in Bravos and Sansa for some reason not telling Jon about the army of the Vale.

Here are three more things:

1. More faceless men: I'm really hoping we're not done with them. I find Jaqen H'ghar extremely interesting and I love the mystery surrounding the faceless men. I hope to find out more about them and their goals and to see Jaqen H'ghar doing some engaging stuff in season 7.

2. Tie in the Ned Flashbacks from season 6 into the story: What was the reason why the three eyed raven was showing bran flashbacks of Ned at different points in his life? These flashbacks might simply have been there for those two reveals (Jon and Hodor) but it would be really cool if there was more to it than just that. 

3. Maybe reveal that Jon's death had an effect beyond him just being a little more depressed than usual. What was the point of killing him and then bringing him back as the exact same person? It would be cool to find out that there's something more going on with that situation.

He has Heartsbane and anything Valyrian is a Chekhov's gun. I don't see Sam the Slayer taking out anymore Wight Walkers so what's Heartsbane for?

It is commonly believed that Sam will find the ""recipe"" for Valyrian steel in some ancient text. However, since he has Heartsbane I believe he may use it to reverse engineer Valyrian steel or perhaps test Valyrian steel capabilities with Heartsbane. Maybe he does find out how to make it from the Citadel Library and uses Heartsbane as his ""control group"" to make sure his designs are on the level. 

When his use for it is done. I can see him giving it to Ser Jorah (once cured) for his quest. Or perhaps give it to Gendry. He's going to need a blacksmith and Gendry is the best we know. Although I wouldn't mind seeing a Valyrian steel war hammer!

TLDR: Sam the Slayer uses Heartsbane to become Sam the Scientist. He may then give it to a key player bc we'd hate to see a Valyrian steel sword sitting on a shelf when there's Wight Walkers still to be dealt with. ",23,31,False,spoiler,,,,,

I didn't like him in the books or the show. Like he's okay. But i never really understood why everyone was soo obsessed with him. Renly was cooler. Davos, I love, of course. His moments with Shireen made him my favorite character. But Stannis? I just don't see the appeal? Even if he doesn't burn Shireen (like he did in the show) in the books, he still let Melisandre's weird shadow baby kill his own bro Renly. Not cool. No one lets Jaime off the hook for the Bran incident in season 1 but Stannis can kill his brother? And the guy wasn't even the ""rightful"" king technically. The Baratheons were usurpers so technically, the throne belongs to the Targs.

- Lady Stoneheart is not a good character. Zombie Cat is just so random. Coming out of the blue to get revenge for the Starks. Like it's a nice fantasy but it just didn't resonate with me in the books. I'm glad they're not taking that route in the show. It honestly steals the spotlight from Jon's resurrection. Now that we know it can be done, we are expecting it to happen to Jon (in the books, he's still dead af). Disregarding the show already bringing Jon back, his return (however it happens) would have been more shocking/exciting if Catelyn hadn't done the same thing a while back. And plus, she has no purpose. She isn't really her old self so she's not gonna go and find her kids. She's very bloodthirsty, actually. So she's just gonna kill people now for revenge? We have living Starks who are going to f*ck sh*t up in Westeros and get revenge. So no, I didn't really like the Lady Stoneheart storyline.

- This last one is even more controversial. Like very controversial. So as it states in the title, i've read all 5 books and watched the show (i'm caught up) and i'm a fan of both. BUT...ILikeTheShowBetterThanTheBooks *ducks as ASOIAF fans chuck the books at my head*

I'm sorry but i do like the show better. The books were great, I liked reading them since they were well-written and provided so much background for the show (I read the books after watching 2 seasons). But there came times that there was just too much detail. To the point where I was wishing certain chapters would end so the story could progress. Especially since there are a million characters in the books. And I love GRRM but maybe every tertiary character didn't need a backstory or long lines or long scenes dedicated to them? There's good tertiary characters like HotPie but not all of them need so much focus. In my opinion (of course others will vehemently disagree), having so much focus on tertiary characters drew focus away from the main characters and their already intricate storylines. Also, even some of the main and secondary characters' chapters were a bit too lengthy and overly detailed. Again, this was great for providing a detailed backstory for everyone but at times, it distracted from the main story. This is why I personally like the show better. IMO the only mistake the show made were the Sand Snakes and making Elia Martell really stupid after Oberyn's death. How these women handled Myrcella and Prince Doran was just impulsive and random. Season 5 is controversial in general since it had the long Arya in Braavos storyline and the Dorne storyline but judging by the standard set by other shows, season 5 was still amazing. GoT just sets such a high standard that season 5 just wasn't AS mindblowing as the other seasons. But it was still crazy good. Also, you can argue that GoT isn't better than the books since the show has to cut out so much detail for it to be watchable but as i stated above, sometimes the book provided way too much detail.

So how did the sorry state of Westerosi economy come to be? I can't find a decent explanation for this. I've seen differing explanations, but none of them fit very well. 

Littlefinger was brought in as Master of Coin because he had the ability to ""rub two dragons and breed a third"". Except, he wasn't doing that, he was borrowing money to give the appearance of cash-influx. But while the public in general might be fooled, people in the Small Council knew the truth. Baelish made no secret of the fact that he was borrowing heavily - he told Ned about his plans to borrow from the Lannisters and about their debt situation completely unprompted. Even Robert knew that he was half a kingdom in debt to Tywin Lannister and he cared very little about the affairs of state. Then there is Pycelle's statement about Jon giving wise and prudent advice to Robert, which went unheeded. All this tells me that Jon Arryn was actually aware of the economic status. That he was completely ignorant of the status seems extremely unlikely. 

Then there is the explanation that he couldn't rein in Robert's spending regardless of his desire. But it wasn't the spending that needed to be reined in, it was Baelish's borrowing. The Hand has the authority to overrule the Master of Coin. He has the authority to direct him to make investments, raise taxes and find alternate sources. Since Robert wasn't involved with running the government, Arryn would've had a free rein in deciding where the money came from. 

Then there is Baelish's flippant comment about him finding the money and the king and the hand spending it. Arryn was pragmatic enough as a politician to realize how destabilizing this bad economic situation would be. This was the de-facto leader of the rebellion who oversaw the successful overthrow of a 300-year old dynasty - you do not get there without some good common sense. To allow things to get this bad without *any* kind of push-back would've been as foolish as being ignorant of it altogether. 


What's the explanation here? Was Arryn really that bad of a Hand despite his apparent political pragmatism? Was he simply blind to this obvious incoming disaster? Or is there more that I don't know of?",31,7,False,spoiler,,,,,

What do you think his endgame is? 

Like Jon Snow, I've noticed Mormont has also had a good amount of action sequences in the show, each of which I found myself to be on the edge of my seat. His duel with the Dothraki Bloodrider and the fight in the arena at Mereen are two of my favorite scenes, right behind BOTB. It makes me wonder why he's been able to make it so far from the beginning episodes. He HAS to have a larger role to come...

...which is why I don't think we should be so quick to rule him out as Azor Ahai. I know that Jon Snow and Dany make the most sense, but I think they almost seem too obvious. This is the greatest story ever and I don't think GRRM is going to hand it to us that easily. There's got to be a curveball that we don't see coming. Jorah's arc is predominantly based on his love for Dany, and I think he's stuck around this long because he's going to have such a huge impact on Dany's endgame. I have a feeling it might be Jorah who puts a sword through Dany to forge Lightbringer; he's the only character other than Jon Snow that I can see fighting the Night King on screen. It'd play well into the ""bittersweet"" ending GRRM has been teasing us with.

4. Suicide/destroys city with wildfire

Even though Cersei hates Tyrion, I reckon she knows that he didn't kill Joffrey. I think he'd show her mercy too, despite enjoying making things difficult for his sister, i doubt he'd enjoy seeing her die.

Edit 3: Jaime killing her is now the most popular choice. Some people saying, Arya using Jaime's face, which I love.

Dunno if this has been brought up before, but if that's the case, why is NK so hell-bent on killing him? Bran is his ticket South - it'd be dumb of him to kill him before he fulfills his purpose. 

And if NK truly needs Bran to cross the Wall, then that means Benjen wasn't ""saved"" at all - he is a wight and an agent of NK, not the 3ER. The whole rescue as staged - with the Wights following and Benjen coming in just at the right moment. And because they've only ever seen mindless Zombie Wights, they got deceived by one that could talk and could remember stuff. Not just that, despite what happened at the Weirwood, Benjen still tells Bran to go south of the wall and gives absolutely no warning about the possibility of NK following.

Me and my fianc's always discussing the little details in GoT that we can easily miss and this week I thought of one I haven't seen anyone else mention.

In episode 1 of Season 3 when Bronn stands off against two Kingsguard outside Tyrions Quarters while Cersie is inside he exchange's some words with Merynn Trant. 

After a quick back and forth. Comes the kicker from Bronn. 

""You're a grub in fancy armour who is better at beating little girls than fighting men."" 

And that is when Trant almost loses his temper before Cersie returns to calm the tension. 

Now I had and I'm assuming most viewers took this to mean him beating on Sansa in the previous season. 

But after 
season 6 I think its safe to say Bronn (being the whore mongering legend we all know and love) would have heard the rumours of Trants 'Habits' from the kings landing whores and was speaking quite literally. 
It's the little details like this that keep me rewatching this show. 

So that's my favourite almost missed piece of foreshadowing.

In season 1, episode 2, in a scene between Ned and Jon, Jon asks Ned if his mother is alive and if she's knows where he is. Ned looks back at Jon, struggling to contain his emotions, and promises him that ""the next time we see each other, we'll talk about your mother"", before parting ways.

Fast forward to season 6, Bran sees a vision of the past that reveals Jon's mother to be Lyanna (Ned's sister). We know that Bran is now the Three Eyed Raven and that he has the ability see the past when he wargs into a Weirwood tree.

If and when Bran makes it back to Winterfell, he will be able to tell Jon about his mother. More than that, he might be able to show him. Just like how the Three Eyed Raven showed Bran visions of the past, Bran might be able to show Jon.

I imagine Bran taking Jon to a vision of young Ned and baby Jon, where Ned is telling Jon all about his mother. I think it would be a really important moment for Jon and a very powerful piece of TV. Much better than Bran simply telling Jon.

edit: I don't think Jon will be able to speak with Ned, he simply see's young Ned telling baby Jon about Lyanna.

He knows this because he understand true love as corny as it sounds and him being young is the reason he came to the truth of Jon Snow's origin. At the time that he lived with Catelyn he was madly in love with her which lead to him challenging her husband (Ned's brother) to be in a duel . The reason I say the love part is because LF was present at the tourney where Rhaegar gave Lyanna flowers instead of his wife. LF says this to Sansa in Season 5 while they were in front of Lyanna's grave before he rides off to Kings Landing. There he tells Sansa about the tourney, he speaks of it strongly because I believe it's a memory that he is very fond of. I believe after LF witnessed the display of Rhaegar and Lyana's love it gave him courage needed to Catelyn's love. 

During his tenure as Master of Coin before the events of the series he used  Lysa (Catelyn's sister whose madly in love with him) to get close to Jon Arryn to learn about Ned Stark. Well to learn what kind of man he was since Arryn was his guardian for some time. Since the public deduced Rhaegar was the one behind Lyanna's kidnapping but not everyone knew about Ned's presumed bastard son he brought home after the rebellion. LF knowing the type pf man Ned was and seeing the relationship of Rhaegar and Lyanna he matches up the dates of the kidnapping and when Ned returned home from the Tower of Joy. Thee public also knew of the Showdown at the Yower of Joy cause there was various famous knights at that battle. So news got out that's where Ned found Lyanna. LF being obsessed with Catelyn and jealous at Ned he was crazy enough to believe Ned's bastard was in fact Rhaegar's bastard instead. Yes I know Jon's a bastard either way the irony!!!!! lol. However LF needs proof to prove this. So he found out info of the Tower of Joy, only issue with my theory here is that the Tower of Joy is located in Dorne. 

How would LF get his network of spies over there cause it is possible for him to find the midwives who were present or maybe he spoke to the surviving men from the battle. He already believes that this is true so a conversation with someone that was there would cement his stand on it through their tone of voice. So there you have it that's how LF knew or knows the truth cause someone has to tell Jon about the truth. Ik your saying Bran but looks like LF and Jon talk in the under keep of Winterfell in the promo for Seaosn 7 so we'll see. Now Ik your saying if our dear friend Lord Petyr Baelish knows this delicate info why wouldn't he use it. Simple answer is that it benefited him because he saw how Ned bringing home a bastard affected Catelyn so he said nothing to try to win her heart. Which failed..... After Catlyn died, LF's mission became becoming King and ruler himself, in my opinion I'm not sure if he wants Sansa for himself it makes sense he does  since Sansa is said to share similar appearance to her mother. I'm still waiting to hear LF's thought son Catelyn's death, we've seen how angry and scary he can be just imagine how he was when he heard the news. But with him knowing Jon's true parents Jon wouldn't be accept cause as I said he is still a bastard cause Rehegar was already married to Elia Martell. Plus take it in he kept Lyanna in Dorne where Elia was from, Rehegar's some playboy lol unless Elia herself knew the truth. 

If you agree with me do you believe LF can use this information to use Jon for his purposes as his used many others. In all honesty you gotta respect LF's hustle. Another question is how didn't Varys recognize this, he favors the Targaryen's and everyone who described Rhaegar only had good things to say about him so Rhaegar would be his prime candidate as Ruler of the Realm and he would've kept close taps on him. Unless Varys wasn't present during the Rebellion, seems like he was though. Another thing is why would Lyanna name Jon Snow after Arryn? Did she look up to him as well ? Unless she only named him in the series and Ned named him in the books. Thanks for your name and reading up all this shit lol.",8,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

We know that Greenseers can only look through the past not the future. For this to be possible we would have to believe in two  theories. The first one being that the Three Eyed Raven is the notorious Targaryen, Bloodraven. Now we can re count for his past before going to the tree. If this is true Bloodraven saw the future himself because he was rumored to practice Blood Magic and Blood mages who worship R'hllor can see the future through the flames. This is more plausible and might be the answer as opposed to the other theory I want to discuss.

If it's true Bran warged into Bran the Builder's body to create the wall in the past . Now we know that it's possible to warg into someones body in the past if we believe in this theory and Bran has shown to attempt this.

Taking this into consideration, when Bloodraven was Lord Commader of the Night's Watch someone must have informed him about Bran and to search for him. That someone had to be from the distant future after the battle against the white walkers. So it must be Bran himself who told his teacher to search for him so that he can become a Greenseer that saves the world. But what if it's someone else from the future who informed Bloodraven and that person is alive in the present and survives the war. Who do you guys think it is? Cause I highly doubt Bran would be able to go into the past, warg that much and still have some power left to notify Bloodraven about his duty cause we've seen how much of a toll it can take on hisbody. And being Bran the Builder must have killed him in my opinion. Bloodraven is an exception to that because he had one of the last Trees the Children of the Forest worshiped which nourished his body. 

I believe the Bloodraven saw it himself through Blod magic more as opposed to someone else notifying him in the past by warging. But the second one is more interesting lol, me and my crazy theories. I just wished the show would have teased that the Three eyed Raven was Bloodraven because I love me some Targaryen history which they drop info about time to time in dialogue. I guess it isn't needed cause they're not doing the thing with Varys trying to marry Rheagar's supposed son to Danny who in fact might be a Blackfrye and Brightflame descendant. And Vary's network of birds can't compete with all those ravens lol.",9,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

Is she going to full play the ""game"", i mean doing political stuff like alliances, speaking with lords etc... maybe marriage...

Th fact is Arya is not a warrior nor a general that leads armies, she is an assassin so i really don't think she goes into battle with Jon (btw i think he would never allow it).

They start by talking about how Daenerys is pregnant and if she manages to give birth to a son, Robert not doing anything, will potentially lead to a rebirth of the Targaryen dynasty. Talking about the ramifications and a possible Dothraki invasion, we see how Robert, for all the drinking and downtime he spends, still knows quite a bit about warfare and what characteristics the people need in a king. 

They have quite an intellectual discussion about how they would tackle a potential Dothraki invasion before the conversation moves in the direction of Lyanna Stark. Here is where I think the scene is the most powerful and Robert's most influential dialogue till date, comes into play (apart from ""BOW TO YOUR KING, YOU SH*TS"") ""17 years and our marriage is the only thing holding it all together."" Cersei talks about how , initially she did have feelings towards Robert and that is why she refused to talk about Lyanna, out of fear that he wouldn't pay any attention to her. To which Robert asks,""Why now?"" ""What damage could Lyanna Stark's ghost do to us that we haven't done to each other already?"" There you have it. Their entire marriage summed up, their problems laid bare, open and out for everyone to see.

This was an intervention.This was the two of them making peace (I think). Years of infidelity, lying and backstabbing and, towards the end, they sat down and made peace.They spoke the truth. Add to that the masterclass by Lena Headey, when she manages to show a tinge of sadness when Robert admits that the marriage could never work out before restoring the stony facade and you have, in my opinion, the setup for all that is to follow, right there in that masterpiece of a scene. Hats off to Mark Addy and Lena Headey and, of course the writers for that scene.

He was charged with multiple sins like Cersei - fornication, buggery etc. He could've confessed sleeping with Olyvar but denied the affair with Renly. Then he'd have made the Walk of Shame for his confessed sin like Cersei did and put in reasonably comfortable quarters until his trial.

Yes, Cersei's Walk was a bad idea because she lost all respect of the people and her dignity and she brought shame upon her house. But like her, Loras seemed too far gone to care about these things as well. Margaery was strong enough to resist because she understood what giving in here would mean, but Loras didn't seem like it.

We know that men can make the Walk of Shame as well, given that the High Septon was made to walk. And the High Sparrow gets to publicly degrade and humiliate another member of the nobility - so I don't see him raising an objection.

He checks all the boxes of what's expected of one. He is smart, loyal, and noble, ofcourse. He is the underdog who rose to his current position by popular acclaim and unbeknownst to others, he is the ""secret prince"" who has a birthright to that position. He is a messianic figure with an air of prophecy surrounding him. He often follows his heart and is compassionate even when it goes against cold, ruthless pragmatism. Most importantly, he is the ideal fantasy battle-commander. He is a skilled and accomplished fighter. He is the first to volunteer for dangerous missions. He cares about his men equally - even if they were enemies before. He leads the charge from the front, inspiring his men to follow him. He is a firm believer of ""if I don't fight for them, why should they fight for me?"". He is pretty much like Aragorn in many respects. He wouldn't be out of place in any fantasy series....


.... Except for this one. 


This is what I find particularly annoying - especially for the show. The series is built on subverting the typical fantasy tropes. For it to have the ""hero"" who hits practically every fantasy hero trope there is seems really out of place. Its not as blatant in the books, but the show hits Jon's fantasy hero status really, really hard. 


No, Jon, you are a commander, not just a combatant. Act like it. At the wall, you should've stayed at the top, keeping an eye on the battles going on on both sides. You are supposed to order men to go and fight as needed, not hand over command to someone else and start fighting yourself. But the hero who just stands back and gives orders doesn't make for good tv, so Jon had to join the fight. 


Sure, banishing the witch for her crimes regardless of what she has done for you is noble and good - but she could be useful in future. Did you think of that?


And yeah, facing down the galloping horde with just a sword makes for a very cool visual and only a cowards would run away - but again, you are the commander, not a combatant. Your job is to get back to the rear lines and command your army. If by some grievous error in judgment you find yourself within enemy lines, your duty is to retreat, retreat, retreat. 

Most importantly - no, all lives are not equally important. And yes, you can expect to send men to their death and never choose to risk yourself. That's what they signed up for when they chose to follow you. Yes, you can treat people like sacrificial pieces and no, not every piece has equal value. You are the one holding things together - if you die, fighting breaks out and a lot of people die needlessly. Do not be so callous with your own life. 


I'd hope that he'd get better in the coming season, that he'd be less typical fantasy hero and more  ruthless, pragmatic hero suited to the show. But based on trailers and other spoilers, I don't see that being the case. 


You are the King in the North now. Which means you send men to risk their lives on dangerous missions while you stay safe in your castle. You do not, repeat, do not go north of the wall no matter how significant that mission is. Sure you are a great fighter, but your job is to do more than that. Your ability to assemble and keep together an army is what would help you against the WW, not your fighting skills in a mission. You do not waste your time traveling into the enemy camp - especially since the enemy can easily decide to imprison or kill you. That's what your trusted envoys are for. Your job as the king is to sit back and move all the pieces - not move around yourself. And yes, despite your promise to protect Sansa, if you have to marry her off to get a bigger army, that's an option worth considering. 


I think a series like GoT deserves a much darker and more controversial action hero. Someone fitting the theme of realism. But books, TVs and games have been peddling the same angst-ridden, noble and brave fantasy hero like Aragorn for ages and  they already know it makes for good television, so they make Jon Snow fit the mold to a tee.

I desperately want him to exit the stage, because I don't want him interfering with the good thing that Jon has going on in the North. But on the other hand, what would have been the point to his character if he doesn't end up on the throne? The whole message behind his character is that one of humble birth can aspire to the throne; if one knows how to play the game of thrones.

To get him out of the way, relatively close to his goal, seems like a waste. I mean, it would fit perfectly with the theme of the show if all the great houses and kings destroy each other in pursuit of the Iron Throne only to be wiped out by the Walkers. With one man emerging - not from the ashes - but from the shadows.

A man who couldn't be further removed from what we call a hero. But a man who was simply smarter than everyone else... ",48,26,False,spoiler,,,,,

I prefer that kind of idea that theres this whole predetermined, weird paradoxical cycle that Bran in the future is going back [in time] to make sure young Bran had all these dreams and went up north so that he could do [the things that Bran has accomplished since getting injured], the actor said.

He added, Hes kind of been guided and predestined ever since he fell off. Bran lost more than just his legs after that fall. He lost his entire family, because they all had to leave without him. He lost a huge chunk of himself, and I like the idea that in the future hes being guided to regain that through a different aspect of his personality. Its the idea that Bran has basically been working to recover what hes lost.

The actor continued, He hasnt really got any designs on going back and just say Oh, Im just going to hang out with my family again, hes got a higher purpose which he understands.

Im not sure about the Bran the Builder theory. I know we can play fast and loose with the time difference, but I think that would really require some really weird type of acting. It wouldnt make sense anymore, he said.",2,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

I see a lot of people proclaim Dany as an ""obvious"" Gryffindor, because of her bravery and chivalry in ending slavery in Essos. While I do not deny that she is brave and could definitely be a Gryffindor, I would personally place her in Slytherin. That being said, she would be a GOOD Slytherin (I hope this does not turn into an argument where some people still believe that Slytherin automatically means evil). She is wildly ambitious with her main goal always being to conquer the Seven Kingdoms. And honestly, attempting to end slavery in a place like Meereen in such a short time is wildly ambitious as well. She is also cunning, in that she is able to deceive others for her own benefit. For example, in episode 3.04 she deceives Kraznis by letting him believe she did not understand Valerian and that will give up baby Drogon for the army of Unsullied. She then has Drogon kill him and sets the Unsullied free, but because she set them free they all choose to follow her, which was the goal of the whole scheme. Finally, she is possibly the most determined individual in the show in my opinion.

I don't think anyone could deny that Jon is a Gryffindor, could be a Hufflepuff too. Tyrion is of course a Ravenclaw, and Cersei a Slytherin. I would say that Jaime is a Hufflepuff; the one constant that drives his character is Cersei because of his loyalty towards her. He even says multiple times throughout the show that Cersei is the only thing that matters to him and that he would do whatever needed to be done to be with her. Of course after the season 6 finale, it seems like that may change.",27,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

Despite the awesome King-In-The-North moment and the cool callback to season 1 finale, I think it was a mistake. That all the characters on the show would simply ignore all precedent, prejudice and questions of legitimacy makes the detailed world of GoT poorer for it - but I've already covered that at length elsewhere. Let's get to some thematic and narrative issues with this choice. 


To begin with, for any other fantasy series, this bit of theater makes perfect sense. The underdog who has been overlooked his whole life finally gets his due. The ugly duckling becomes the swan. The people recognize a man's actions and finally raise him to the position of leadership by popular acclaim. The idea fits the usual fantasy theme pretty well. But not GoT. GoT is what happens when fantasy themes meet cold, hard realism except, realism lost out in this instance. 


Then there is the theme they were going for the season. Whether you like it of not, there was a strong undercurrent of female empowerment in season 6. Cersei was crowned Queen, Dany made her comeback, Yara teamed up with Dany, Olenna and Ellaria joined forces and Arya took down the leader of the Riverlands. Like it or not, ""Winds of Women"" might as well have been the title of the finale. It'd have made perfect sense to round it off with a Queen of the North to complete the set. 


The choice would've made sense for the future as well. Following the War of the Five Kings, you'd have had the War of the Three Queens. ""War of the Two Queens and the Bastard King"" just doesn't have the same ring to it. They could've had some interesting parallels with Queens' right-hand men. Cersei has her actual brother, Sansa has her foster-brother and if A+J=T is true, Dany has her half-brother. Plus those aides would be a set of bastards, cripples and broken things. That would've been pretty poetic, IMO.


Let's come to the narrative now. According to D&amp;D, the Northerners chose Jon because they realized that he was their best, their last and their only hope in surviving the wars to come. But he doesn't need to be their king for that, he needs to lead their armies for that, which he'd be doing anyway even with Sansa as the queen. To make Sansa the Queen and Jon the commander of her forces would make a lot more narrative sense for both characters. 


Fighting and ruling are not the same thing - that lesson has been hammered in pretty well by the show. Jon's character arc is about fighting the War with the Whitewalkers. He doesn't need to be a king for that, he needs to lead an army for it. Sansa's arc is about learning to rule, learning the political game - and becoming the queen would be a part of it. 


Jon never wanted to be the king in the first place. He never wanted power - he wanted recognition and a place for himself despite being a bastard and that usually came with status, but he never wanted to rule over others. Besides, putting those desires in perspective is part of his character development - which is why he refused when Stannis offered to make him the Lord of Winterfell. His character arc is about understanding the significance of the upcoming war and fighting in it. Becoming the king heaps a lot of other responsibilities that he simply doesn't have the time for that. He can't be worrying about courtly intrigue or political manipulations or economy or food supply or infrastructure - he needs to be focused on fighting the White Walkers. He needs to be in the middle of all the action - going on missions, convincing other lords to join the war effort, leading armies etc. A king doesn't go around doing all this stuff himself, he delegates it to his subordinates. 


Sansa's character arc, on the other hand, is about power. Getting the power so that you don't become a pawn in someone's game. Being in an unassailable position so that no one can use or abuse you at whim. Being the Queen and dealing with the matters of ruling would make sense for her character. She has figured out her need for power, not she needs to learn the cost of it. 


While Jon is being the heroic leader facing the zombie horde, Sansa needs to be the quiet strength behind him. Not as a subordinate, but in her own right. She should be the one making alliances with Vale and Riverlands to get Jon his army, to figure how to feed and supply said army, to deal with all the political bickerings within the court and to figure out how the hell they are going to survive the Winter even if the Whitewalkers are defeated. 


Putting those two in positions they don't want to be in and which don't fit their character arc or purpose doesn't make sense. Creating unnecessary conflict because of it would make the choice even worse. ",48,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

I wholeheartedly agree that a showdown between The Hound and The Mountain would make for an epic bit of television. And I think I have seen this opinion voiced before in a thread, so if this is a repeat discussion - my apologies.

But, at this point, with The Mountain having been ""altered"" by Qyburn, can the showdown really be as satisfying or fulfilling as it would have been had Gregor survived the fight with Oberyn without having suffered a mortal wound? The show hasn't exactly delved into the depths of to what extent Gregor is still Gregor, but I think it is fair to say he has mostly been portrayed as a mindless killing machine at Cersei's beck and call. If Cleganebowl does happen, all of the emotional charge stemming from Sandor and Gregor's past - which is really what makes the notion of the fight so interesting, has essentially been removed. We do not know if Gregor has any sentience with regards to his past life, and if Sandor is wise - he will realize that he isn't actually fighting Gregor, either - just a FrankenMonster that Qyburn concocted using Gregor's body.

I'm not here to dump on the hype that was promised, I'm just wondering if anyone else shares the same thoughts on the imapct of the fight itself as far as Sandor's journey goes. ",64,83,False,spoiler,,,,,

Maybe nothing, maybe something but either way it really caught my ears this time.

Oberyn-""we spoke a great deal about her (Cercei's) daughter. How worried your sister is about her. She was trying very hard to pretend she had not come to sway me against you, I think she may have even believed it herself.""

Tyrion-""making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts.""

But then later in the Vale in the snow.

Sansa (to Peter)- ""why did you really kill Geoffrey. Tell me why.""

Petyr-""I loved your mother more than you could ever know. Given the opportunity what do we do to those who have hurt the ones we love.""

Okay. Cool. But then cut to Se06(?) I think? Where he admits all he wants is the Iron Throne. I guess it's obvious, and I know no one trusts him as a viewer. But I thought this was cool to have Tyrions words ring true all the way to the North-East from his dungeon in the South.

Now this will be my post about my Most Favorite fan theories. Now these are the theories that you love and you think are just awesome and make sense. So let's discuss what are Fav fan theories are. I'll Start first now this is not all the ones i like just and hand full with some of my own:

- R+ L = J (Now i know i am cheating here since this was confirmed already. But it did start as a theory so i feel it is still worth mentioning. What is there to say though that has already been said this theory is just a fantastic theory)

- Jaime and Cersei Targaryen (Now alot of people seem to think Tyrion is a targaryen. But i do not like that theory in my opinion a better story is that Jaime and Cersei are the mad king's children why well because it would be shocking, It makes more sense, and It would be a better story that Tyrion was Tywin's only true son and Jaime and Cersei were truly Areys children)

- Rhaegar still alive/Old Man Rhaegar (Now this is my own theory but like i said some of my own theories would be on here. Now this does not say he is Mance or Gerold or anything like that it is just him alive as himself (maybe resurrected after the battle of the Trident) and he is now living in hiding as a old man. Now that would be a very interesting twist)

- Bastards, Cripples, and Broken things (this is one of my favs for the end game that Bastards, Cripples, and Broken things the things Tyrion holds dear rule the seven kingdoms. I think it would just be a great way to end the story)

- Jonsa (need i say more)

- Jaime Lannister or Arya Stark is the Valonqar and Daenerys or Sansa are the more beautiful queen (now we all know why Jaime being Valonqar and Dany being the more beautiful queen so i will focus on Arya Valonqar and Sansa being more beautiful queen. I think it would be Poetic if this happened the Stark sisters getting revenge on the Lannisters the people that killed there father. But maybe sounds to fanfictiony so that is why it be more poetic with Jaime and Sansa instead of Arya and Sansa)

- Gendry and Arya hook up and possibly marry (yes I AM AWARE that Gendry is older then Arya but here is thing first they still have good chemistry. Also Arya dies not need to you know what with Gendry atleast not until she is older. Also it would be poetic and full circle if a Stark and a Baratheon married)

- B + A= Daario (another one of my own theories this one is that Daario is the son of Brandon stark and Ashara Dayne i think it would be awesome. We can learn more about Daario this way, It adds more to his character, and it is a thousand times better then oh he is Euron or Benjen or Aegon or something)

- Blackfyre Conspiracy (Now of course this is that Aegon is a blackfyre i will not go in depth because we should know about ti by now but man it is a good theory)

- Arya queen of the seven kingdoms theory (now this is also one of my own theories and it is Arya will be queen in the end. In my opinion it would be a interesting way to end the series as she is the last character you could see on the throne, She is obviously worthy of it, and it would just be awesome)

- Cleganebowl (need i say more)

- Multiple Azor Ahai Theories (now this one is a well known theory now i will not go into much of it but i will mention my favs. Not the most likely is Jon and Daenerys but for me some of my personal favs are Jorah, Bran, The Hound, Davos, and Jaime) ",20,9,False,spoiler,,,,,

Personally, I would say Daenerys. Because after Rhaegar was killed, Viserys was crowned heir passing over Rhaegers' son Aegon. Also, after Aerys was killed, Viserys was initially crowned king. So since Rheagars children were initially passed over in favor of Aerys other children, it seems likely that the crown would pass to Daenerys before Jon.

Also, as far as we know, Jon is still a bastard. But a bastard of Rhegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark rather than Ned and a random woman. So although he is the son of two great houses, he is still a bastard. Now it's possible that there's some sort of secret marriage certificate from Lyanna and Rhaegar buried deep in the Citadel. But considering that Rhaegar was also married to Elia Martell and polygamy is forbidden in the faith of the seven (which the Targaryens were apart of), that seems unlikely.

It seems like every Game of Thrones fan including myself has a weird fixation of Gendry. As I prepare for the next season of Game of Thrones, and started thinking about how the White Walkers will ultimately be stopped, I realized that Gendry may play a crucial part in the inevitable battle.

We know of three things that can kill a White Walker: fire, obsidian, and Valyrian steel. I think the main threat to the White Walkers will be Dany's dragons, since they can breathe fire and fly (which I also think is why GRRM specifically chose dragons as a crucial part to the story), but there's gonna be a whole lot of White Walkers and only three dragons. So how will the men and women battling the White Walkers ever be able to have a chance against them?

One option is wildfire. We've seen twice now how dangerous wildfire is twice now, and I have no doubt it will be deployed again in the coming battle. However, it may be difficult to make enough to turn the tide of battle since Cersei just used so much for her power play. We also know that Thoros would use wildfire to light his sword on fire, but this practice as already been said to damage his sword, meaning it needs repairing every time he does this. Therefore, it would be impractical to have a whole army brandishing flaming swords.

Another option is dragonglass. However, as far I know there's no way to create dragonglass, meaning that unless somebody finds another bag of dragonglass knives there won't be any way to use it on a large scale. Also, in the show most, if not all of the dragonglass the Night's Watch had was left at Hardhome.

This leaves Valyrian steel, which would be the most impractical method yet, seeing how little Valyrian steel remains and the fact that no one knows how to make more, which means fighting the White Walkers with Valyrian steel isn't a real possibility.

Or is it?

If somehow the armies of Westeros had access to a lot of Valyrian steel, they would be more than a match for the White Walkers. In A Feast for Crows, Jon sarcastically says when told that Valyrian steel can kill White Walkers, ""So if I can just convince the lords of the Seven Kingdoms to give us their Valyrian blades, all is saved?"" But what if he's not wrong? What if Valyrian steel blades are what will ultimately take down the army of White Walkers? Unfortunately, since nobody knows how to make Valyrian steel anymore, there's no real way to create more, unless they could somehow find out how to create Valyrian steel. How would this be possible.

The answer to this is simple, and I can't believe I hadn't thought of it before: Bran. Bran now has the ability to see into the past, which means that he could theoretically go back in time to before the Doom and discover how it was made. If he did this, it could give the humans a huge edge. But even if he did manage to bring to the present the secret of how to make Valyrian steel. very few people know how to work with it, and we'd need every person who does to help out.

So who do we know that can work Valyrian steel? The only one named so far is Tobho Mott. In case you forgot, he's the blacksmith at King's Landing who created Oathkeeper and Widow's Wail from Ice. However, he's notable for another reason: his apprentice was none other than Gendry.

We don't know for sure if Gendry can work Valyrian steel, but having work under Mott, it seems like a distinct possibilty that we would have at least some experience with Valyrian steel, which would mean that he could become paramount to victory over the White Walkers. How will he make his return? I don't know, for the show maybe Bran will find him or he'll come back of his own volition. He never rowed away in the books, so he should have an easier time returning in those. But if Gendry actually does know how to work Valyrian steel, he could very well save thousands of lives. Especially for the show, this will give Gendry a far more satisfying conclusion to his character arc than what we currently have. Is this scenario likely to happen? Probably not. Do I hope it will with all of my heart? Abso fucking lutely.

TL;DR: If Bran can find out how to make Valyrian steel, Gendry may be one of the few people who can work with it",20,21,False,spoiler,,,,,

Her arc in the books is different but they discussed something that I thought could relate to the show.

We know that Brienne takes vows and oaths very seriously. But I am relating this more to the vow that Sansa makes to her. She says:

*You will always have a place by my hearth,*

*Meat and Mead at my table,* (thanks Pod)

**And I pledge to ask no service of you which would bring you dishonour.**

*I swear it by the old Gods and the new.*

I wonder about the third line being that she is still to a certain extent taking some counsel from Littlefinger, or at the very least has learnt to play the game with him.

What could Sansa ask that may make Brienne feel she has broke her vow to her? The first thought obviously something to do with Jaime but it could be the slaying of somebody strategically important but of no clear and present threat.

It would be interesting to see Brienne in the same dilemma Jaime was in where his vows as a knight and his vows as a member of the kingsguard conflicted.

Be interested in other people's thoughts. And also if you are a fan of the books in  particular I really do recommend radio Westeros. They've given me some great insights into characters.",5,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

Me and my friends have spent a lot of time arguing about hypothetical battles between GoT characters and trying to figure out who would win. The Mountain is a pillar we always talk about as a pillar to measure the worth of other fighters since he is absolutely one of the scariest warriors described in the books and show. 

However I've been rewatching the series and I had forgotten a little bit about what a fucking boss Khal Drogo really was. Damn the dude is a beast, and I figure he is known throughout his homeland in similar legend that The Mountain holds in Westeros.

Undoubtedly the biggest question is which style of fighting is superior, the fast and relaxed style of the East, vs the iron-clad forceful style of the Knights of the West. I think just observing the show, it seems like GRR believes in the Dothraki mindset that ""fast beats strong"" which we have seen examples of when it comes to Bronn vs Ser Vardis and The Red Viper vs The Mountain. In addition we did see that although the Mountain in truly a force of nature and super dangerous, he isn't the most skilled duelist, and was outfoxed by Martell and his quick Dornish spear. I don't think there is much doubt that if Oberyn's lust for vengeance hadn't gotten the better of him, he would have come out on top, leading me to believe that Drogo would have the advantage in a duel with the musclebound behemoth.

What do you guys think? Am I way off base? Id love to hear arguments either way and I certainly don't have all the information since I haven't read the books. So i'm not sure how much fighting either character does in the books that i'm not aware of.

Sansa only wants to marry joffrey and merge the houses. Even though Ned doesn't want to particularly do it he wants to just live out his days in peace in the north, Sansa begs her mother to ""make him say yes"" which intern leads to it her staying in lannister captivity for like a million years. Arya all she wants is to be a warrior, she doesn't enjoy girly things like sowing she wants to fight. She goes so far as to keep position of the sword she gets from Jon and present it to her father without hiding it in shame. This leads for her to begin classes with the Syrio. Jon all he wants is to be on the wall with uncle Benjen stark. He pushes and pushes, Benjen convinces Ned to let him go become a man of the nights watch. I'm not sure if this is some big conspiracy fan theory that is going to change everything or anything at all. I just thought it was super interesting that these people in house stark are pretty much the only remaining ones of the house and seemed to have it the hardest throughout the story. The only ones I really didn't see much that had to do about anything were Catlin who really didn't seem to want anything. She just wanted Ned to live out his days in winter fell, Rob who didn't seem to want anything but to serve by his fathers side and tried to follow in his example. This led him to a fate similar to that of his father. Bran is also exempt from this because he has basically been forgotten about and seems to be no longer important to the story. 

I guess what I am trying to say is that those characters(Sansa, Jon, and Araya), they all sowed there own story line and yea most of it sucked. They suffered horribly threw rape, beatings, humiliation, and even death. but in the end even if there lives were stupid hard. They have become all the stronger for it and they survived for it. They seemed to have been the ones who choose correctly. The others in there house the ones who choose to follow Ned's leadership it led them to there death(Catlin, and Rob), or being forgotten about in the case of Bran.

By now we all know the theory that states that Gendry is actually Cersei's son, not going too far into that. I don't really know if it's a really popular one but oh well.  
  
Anyways, and I might be an idiot for just now noticing this, sorry if that's the case, but when I was rewatching Season 1 Episode 2 last night, during one particular scene Cersei and Catelyn were having a conversation about their children (when Bran was still unconscious in his bed). During this conversation, Cersei talks about her firstborn son, and how he died of a fever shortly after birth. After this scene ends, the screen shifts to another scene, and the first character we see is a blacksmith's apprentice (Mikken's apprentice actually).  
  
Now, we all know that Gendry was once a blacksmith's apprentice, and we also know that Game of Thrones loves this kind of foreshadowing, so would that be a possible hint at the theory that Gendry might be Cersei's legitimate firstborn son (assuming he didn't actually die of a fever)?

They're not slaves, they're not her enemy, and they don't need conquering and they CHOSE their ruler already. Jon is not the evil slave masters she came across in Essos. He's a man that only wants and does what is best for his people. The North only allowed themselves to be ruled by the boltons, because it was that or be skinned alive by ramsay, like lord cerwyn when he refused to pay their taxes.


It's a bit out of character for Dany to want to conquer a kingdom that has already chosen their ruler. It is even worst because she'll probably hear about jon, she'll know that the north is in good hands. Plus, when she left Meereen, she told Daario that the people should choose their own leaders. So what's her deal with the north?



I'm interested to see how she's gonna deal with this particular situation. Pulling a Aegon The Conqueror would make her a hypocrit. I know people like to think of Dany as Aegon with tits, but IMO she's nothing like him. or perhaps she'll become just like her ancestor once she lands in westeros.

And, before anything else is said, Jon is my favorite character.

Anyway, out of all the hated characters on the show, Olly stands out to me as the least deserving of the hate, and I will attempt to defend him and his actions below, after a short summary of Olly's story.

When we first meet Olly, he is a kind Northern boy living in his village with his family. Then, the wildlings, including Ygritte, Tormund, and the Thens, show up out of nowhere and butcher every one of the innocent villagers. The leader of the Thens finds Olly and tells him that he is going to eat Olly's father and mother, and sends the boy to the Castle Black as a mockery of the Night's Watch.

At Castle Black Jon takes Olly under his wing, and begins training him and treating him like a beloved little brother. Olly looks up to Jon and respects him. At the battle of Castle Black, Olly kills Ygritte to protect Jon, while also getting revenge for his dead parents and Night's Watch brothers.

Olly backs Jon to become Lord Commander and then becomes his squire. Then Jon continues to go out of his way to help the wildlings. Eventually, Olly becomes part of the mutiny that kills Jon because he is fed up with Jon's love for the people who killed his family. After Jon comes back to life, hangs all of the mutineers including Olly.

****************************************

Defense:

As a Northern boy, Olly no doubt heard and maybe experienced wildling incursions of his village. He would naturally have learned and been taught to fear and hate the people who would kill, raid, and rape his neighbors. Then while still a tween, he sees his parents, friends, and neighbors brutally killed and is told that they will be eaten.

The Night's Watch gives him and place of refuge and safety to recover from witnessing something nobody, let alone a 12 year old boy, should ever have to experience. Jon treats him like a brother and he becomes Olly's role model and best friend. Olly kills Ygritte to save Jon, knowing her only as one of the leaders of the people that killed his parents. We the viewers knew her better, but Olly never knew anything more about her than what he saw, i.e. her helping lead attacks that left loved ones dead. He saw her help kill his parents, he couldn't let her kill his new brother. 

Then his new wonderful brother who he loves and greatly cares for starts defending the people who killed his family, destroyed his old home, attacked his new home, and killed his fellow Watchers and friends like Pyp and Grenn. Jon continues to rescue and fight for the wildlings, to us viewers having mercy for humanity, to Olly defending merciless killers. I think Olly just feels betrayed by Jon and doesn't know what to do to avenge his parents. I think that to him killing Jon is the only way that he sees to destroy the the threat that is the wildlings. I think Olly feels like this is the last resort option. He certainly isn't happy about (he's barely holding back tears). 



TLDR: Although he made some choices we as the viewer hate, when looking at the events from Olly's perspective I think he is a tragic character who deserves some sympathy. Now that being being said, LONG LIVE THE KING OF THE NORTH",61,34,False,spoiler,,,,,

1. There is the scene where the COTF are plunging the dragon glass through the mans chest.... and it is a very nice and green environment. Flash forward to bran walking around the site where the he sees the same pattern made by the stones. Are these the same locations or just a reconstructed design to send a message? If this is the same location, they must be north of the wall, right? Does this mean that the lands north of the wall were not always cold as they are now? 

2. Do you guys think bran and the night king are the same guy? Like is the night king simply a more developed bran who wargs into the distant past and made into the night king because the COTF recognize his power and seize it as a weapon? I think the power to resurrect the dead is the night king warging into all these corpses. This explains why they are all completely mindless and not bothered by pain. This also explains why he has so many animals at his disposal.

I lost my mom very suddenly last year. Like most mother/son relationships, ours had many ups and downs over the years (I'm an adult now). We could both be very stubborn, and would sometimes have arguments that would leave us barely speaking (or not speaking at all) for weeks or months at a time. 

More recently, especially after the birth of my son, it seemed like she and I had finally learned how to communicate well, how to let things go, and generally how to have a high-functioning relationship. We seemed to do best when we had something we could share an interest in - my son was acting as our shared interest. Following that logic, I constantly told her that she should start watching Game of Thrones. She was a fan of sci-fi and the occasional fantasy show, so I knew she would enjoy it. After literally years of good-natured prodding, she finally starting watching last year. I would constantly check in on her progress, looking forward to hearing from her when she hit the major milestones.

Our last text message was about Jon Snow. It was sent the day before she died, suddenly and very unexpectedly. She made it most of the way through season 5. 

I used to read this subreddit all the time, watch fan theory videos, and re-watch episodes whenever I could find a spare moment. But now it all just reminds me of losing my mom. I waited weeks to even bother watching the season 7 trailer, and I only watched it once, as opposed to the half-dozen times I would usually repeat a new trailer. I just happened upon some GoT related videos on YouTube, but it quickly got me upset, and that's how I found myself writing this post.

As I mentioned above, I'm just posting this in the hopes that somehow getting it out there will help with the grief. So, thanks for reading.

Thematically, they are opposites of each-other as well. While both work from the shadows and are the men behind the contenders, their playing style and their motivations seem as different as it gets. 


Littlefinger is the agent of chaos, ofcourse. Beyond certain strategic objectives, he doesn't bother thinking through exactly what he wants to achieve or how. More often than not, he is making moves to create chaos and seizing the opportunity when it presents itself. He is in it to stick it to the man - the nobility that looked down on him. Like Varys said, ""He'd burn the realm if he could be king of the ashes"". 


Varys, on the other hand, is more of an agent of order. While not above causing chaos to create opportunities himself, he prefers to remain focused on his long-term goals. Yes, situations change and he has to adjust with them, but he knows what he ultimately wants to achieve and he is always working towards that goal. 

Something you may not agree with here, but I do think that Varys wants to do what's best for the realm. Even if I do not agree with his ideas about it, I think his intentions are genuine. He wants to reform the feudal system of Westeros in a way that betters the life of common people and creates lasting peace and order. Sure, he wants to be the man behind the man, the voice in king's ear influencing his every decision but he wants to do that towards those ends. Right now, in Westeros, no matter which way the political winds blow, the results will always be the same - more civil war and rebellions while the commoners keep suffering. Some people have tried to make things better - like Aegon V - but it always ended in failure die to entrenched nobility. He is looking for a monarch who'd ""break the wheel"" and if he can't find one, he'll make one himself. Aegon VI (or fAegon) fills the role for him in the books and Dany does the same on the show. Putting that monarch on the throne would, in his view, be like the second coming of Jahaerys and worth all war and misery preceding it. 


Given this view of him, his support of Viserys and his methods didn't make any sense to me at all. Yes, he wanted a Targaryen restoration, but if it wasn't done the right way, it'd all be for nothing. Even if he planned on restoring the Targaryen dynasty, but getting rid of Viserys later, the nature of Westerosi politics would still not change. Viserys was the Mad King's son through and through and people would never expect him. Not to mention, bringing the Dothraki horde to rape and pillage through Westeros would hardly convince the people to follow him. Its more likely that the whole country would unite against such an invasion. Dany didn't become a viable candidate for monarchy until after she had the dragons and proven himself in Mereen. In the books, you could say that Aegon VI  was Varys' real candidate and Viserys was just the backup - and heir and a spare. But given his nature, keeping Viserys around in any capacity as a candidate did not make sense. Especially for a mastermind like Viserys.


Basically, Varys is telling a story here - the realm grows corrupt, decadent and miserable under Usurper's rule and warring lords and the long-lost, noble heir returns to heroically put the land together. He did everything right to cast the current regime as the villains, but Viserys and his Dothraki horde hardly made for good heroes, even in a backup capacity. 

It didn't make sense to me until I read this analysis:

&gt;With Varys spending a generation crafting the players, he turned to setting into motion the tale he meant to tell. He had his villains, his heroes, but on its own, the tale wouldnt resonate as well as Varys would prefer. Despite his skill with the craft, Varys understood that the Targaryen dynasty was despised by much of Westeros, and its seventeen-year hiatus off the Throne robbed the dynasty of its staying power, since any king that was overthrown could be overthrown again. Even worse, the last Targaryen king was undoubtedly insane, paranoid and vindictive. Nobles no longer held the support for the Targaryen dynasty that they had in ages past, and this meant that Varys needed to distance Aegon from the storied Targaryen madness. To that end, he needed a supporting player: a mad Targaryen for Aegon to defeat, to sway doubters that looked to Targaryens past.

&gt;That honor was to go to Viserys Targaryen, Aegons cruel and vengeful uncle. At the head of a Dothraki horde, Viserys would cause chaos in Westeros, painting a picture of Westeros at its absolute worst, suffering under invading barbarians and mad pretenders, bloated and decadent from Baratheon rule, suffering the thousand wounds that it had been inflicting on itself for generations. When all hope seemed lost, however, a light would come from Essos. Aegon Targaryen, saved from death and back to heal his homeland. In a single stroke, Aegon would eliminate the Dothraki, slay his mad uncle for bringing ruin and despair to Westeros, and take up the mantle of his namesake to bring Westeros into a new golden age.


That makes so much sense to me now. Viserys was always meant to be the villain and never the scion of Targaryen family. That is why he was allowed to slowly descend into madness and paranoia when Varys could've easily ensured that he grew up the right way. 


But that also means the character of Varys is made less on the show for the absence of Aegon from the storyline. The Varys on the show is shown to be more concerned about the welfare of the realm and its people than his book counterpart. Certain actions, like trying to get rid of Shae, would've have no purpose beyond showcasing that. And yet, for some reason, Show!Varys wants a Dothraki invasion led by another Mad King despite the fact that it wouldn't do the realm any good in short term or the long term. Seems like he wrote the story with 2 villains, but forgot to include the hero. 


The differences in his relationship with Tyrion also make sense. Varys on the show seems a lot more sincere in his efforts to help Tyrion (and Dany) because now they are the only ones left to play the role of heroes in his narrative. But in the books, he might be trying to cast Dany in Viserys' role now - the Mad Queen with dragons and a scheming dwarf whispering in her ear. But the choice of Dany as his hero on the show is clearly a recent development. 


TL;DR: By failing to include the Aegon storyline from the books, the showrunners have made Varys out to be less of a master player than in the books. His thematic contrast with LF suffers from this exclusion as well. Thoughts?",15,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

Which other characters in the books and/or show receive a lot of, in your opinion, unjust hatred and can you write a write a piece defending them?

I'm irked at the reception Randyl Tarly got in the show - because we've seen Sam for so long, having someone outwardly hostile towards him (and his own son, no less) drew a lot of dislike.  
From Randyl's point of view, though, he has no idea about 'Sam the Slayer'. He doesn't know he rescued Gilly from being killed at Craster's keep, and that he's helping to look after her. He hasn't seem Sam be brave.  
All Randyl saw was a fat son unsuitable to become one of the most powerful men in Westeros - which is, given what we saw of Sam when he first arrived at the Wall, accurate - so sent him off for the benefit of the land. His son was an overweight coward who couldn't ride a horse, defend himself or fight a battle, so the best place to send him would be somewhere where food and luxury are scarce, and where his life is dedicated to serving as the shield of mankind fighting off the wildlings that are trying to invade the country he's spent his life fighting for (and against).

When he next sees his son, it's not under the circumstances he would like. His son has come home (to a family he should have forsaken), still seemingly as fat and as cowardly as ever, having broken his vow (I shall father no children), and with his only defence being the equivalent to 'well, I killed a yeti'. The wall was (in Randyl's eyes) supposed to force Sam to become a man, and it failed. Not only that but he had a child with a wildling, the very race Sam had sword to protect his people against.

Because we've seen so much of Sam, we know how incredible he is. His father hasn't seen what we've seen, though.",145,101,False,spoiler,,,,,

To restore the proud lion that his father had almost destroyed. Set things up so that the Lannister name is feared and respected throughout the kingdoms for generations to come. 


But did Tywin truly think about what he wanted his legacy to be? Or was he simply a man haunted and bound by his father's weakness? For a man of his supposed vision and pragmatism, it made sense to not only consider what he wanted the family image to be, but also whether that image was consistent with long-lasting legacies. But from what I can see, he was pretty short-sighted in that regard - acting more out of a desire not to be like his father and less out of long-term considerations. 


After his weak father who'd almost destroyed the name, Tywin was in a unique position to re-brand the name Lannister and he had a the whole history of Westeros to learn from and decide what kind of brand he wanted it to be. He wanted the House to be perceived as strong and unassailable and that fit very well with the martial culture of Westeros. The Westerosi value things like military strength and bravery and courage - but that's not the sum of it. It has to be strength tempered with wisdom, generosity and honor, otherwise that strength is simply seen as cruelty. Compare and contrast the cultures of Dothraki or the Wildlings or even the Iron Islanders. These are groups that value strength and personal charisma above all, that believe that if you can't fight, you are not fit to lead - and yet, these cultures are regarded as backwards and barbaric by the Westrosi. These are not the images Tywin should want his house associated with - not the ancient and noble House of Lannister. 


Look at the qualities most highly valued by the people of Westeros. The Starks are known for their devotion to honor and duty. Their courage is exemplified not by battle prowess, but by their commitment to upholding the law and doing their duty despite it being hard. They truly live by their values and that is where their strength and respected status comes from. The Tyrells, on the other hand, are quite ambitious, but they recognize the value of good PR. Publicly, they uphold the notions of chivalry and generosity and that's a carefully crafted image meant to win over hearts and minds and ensure their legacy. Or consider the Targaryens - they are certainly a mixed bag, alternating between madness and greatness. But the kings that are truly well-remembered were not only known for their strength, but their honor, compassion and wisdom as well. 


These aren't empty platitudes. The power of a House ebbs and flows, but building a reputation is what allows its legacy to survive for generations. If it only relies on a reputation of brute force, it ends up similar to the Greyjoys - hated and despised. Regardless of whether Tywin personally considers these qualities important, it behooves him to craft a public image based on them, because his reputation speaks to that of his House. 


In this, I think, Tywin failed utterly. Under his tenure as the Lord, the Lannisters came to be regarded as ambitious and greedy to an almost comical degree. Grasping, naked ambition is not a good reputation to have because it makes them look like a threat to other houses. Unlike the Tyrells, he failed to cloak his agenda in values like generosity or chivalry. Not only that, his own actions cemented him as ruthless and vindictive. Sure, he proved his redoubtable strength, but it was perceived as brutal and merciless strength that is despised, not the noble and merciful strength that's truly respected. 


Consider his actions in wake of Tyrion's abduction. Yes, its an insult to his house and if he does nothing, he looks weak. But there are other ways of showing strength - ways that are less brutish. He could've chosen to ride to King's Landing and demand that this outrageous and unlawful act be punished. He certainly had the political clout to get results - his daughter was the Queen, hi loyalists were all around in the court and he was a major creditor to the crown. At the very least, he could get his son back and a very public apology from both the Starks and Tullys. This way, not only he'd look strong, but noble and civilized as well, while his enemies end up looking foolish. 


Instead, he acted on his first instinct and responded with violence. What exactly did he think would be the outcome here? There was no way for him to know that Robert would die soon - so he should've definitely expected the king to step in. And since he was in no position to face a kingdom united behind Robert, he'd have to back down. Even if his ploy to capture Ned and exchange prisoners had worked, a king cannot simply overlook this disturbance of King's Peace. Just like he is responsible for keeping his bannermen under control so is the king responsible for him. Sure Catelyn would be censured and forced to return Tyrion, but he'd face some censure as well. In an effort to look strong, he ends up looking like one of the unruly children who were smacked down by their parent. That shows weakness, not strength. 


The result of the reputation he built - or rather, failed to built - was that his legacy barely survived his death. Sure he commanded fear, but that was fear of his personal reputation, not his family name. Yes, he commanded respect, but it was the type of respect that doesn't survive a show of weakness. For all his talk of putting family first, Tywin actually put his personal pride and agenda first and the reputation of his House suffered in its wake. ",6,11,False,spoiler,,,,,

Well, that and I love speculating :)

Everybody knows, by now, that the White Walkers were created by the Children. Ostensibly to help defeat the First Men. And the first of them was created by plunging a shard of dragon glass into the heart of a man.

Everyone also should know by now that underlings betraying their lord/lady's wishes because they don't understand it is a theme on this show. Jamie very directly betrayed the mad king. Littlefinger betrayed Ned. Karstarks betrayed Robb. Roose betrayed Robb. The freed slave from Meereen betrayed Danaerys by killing the master awaiting trial. Olly betrayed Jon. I'm sure there's countless more.

So here's the question that drives my idea: What if the Night King isn't the First White Walker? 

We know from the books about the Night's King, a man who did dark magic in the Night's Watch as it's Lord Commander.  Supposedly he was defeated, either by Stark men or an alliance between north and south of the Wall. But that's all legend.

What if the First Men made peace with the Children of the Forest, but it didn't sit well with everyone. And this Night's King wasn't defeated, but escaped into the North. Supposedly he was a necromancer. Perhaps he used some crazy necromancer magic to resist the control Children of the Forest usually put on White Walkers. He wants to destroy the Children, using their own creations against them. So he intentionally violates the peace, and incites the Children to turn him. But with his magic, all that does is give him control over the other White Walkers. He betrays the peace established by his kind, and begins destroying the Children. 

But the alliance between men and the Children is respected by their leaders, and together they end the Long Night. They do so by suppressing magic across the world. This is the true cause of the Doom of Valyria (volcanoes no longer can be controlled with magic). And somehow, some way, magic was restored and the Night King began anew.",6,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

I think the shots of Jaime charging happen after the battle at Casterly Rock.  While the Unsullied storm the castle, the Dothraki face off Lannisters on the field.  Based on the first trailer, we know at least one of the dragons is with them.  So I think that dragon is going to wreck shit and then Jaime is going to somehow take cover, but he will charge at a much bigger army with either a few supporters or by himself and could potentially die or get captured.",208,117,False,spoiler,,,,,

I was thinking about this and I don't quite understand the ""rules"" of the many faced god/ god of death. 
When we first meet Jaqen and he tells Arya to give him 3 names to repay the deaths that were taken from the many faced god, it doesn't matter who they are. To MFG, a death is a death, doesn't matter who. Also, Jaqen kills more than three to help her escape Harrenhal, so this implies extra deaths are fine, so long as you get at least the ""quota"" for MFG. 
But then later, when Arya kills the wrong guy (Trant) she is scolded. Then when she doesn't kill the actress they send the waif to kill her. But she isn't in trouble when she kills the waif. 
I just don't understand their rules. If Arya doesn't kill the actress, can't she just say, ""I would rather kill this guy instead""? I mean, Jaqen had her ""un-name"" him so that he wouldn't have to kill himself, why can't she ""un-name"" other people she doesn't want to kill? ",4,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

Here's why:,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/6in42f/main_spoilers_i_am_convinced_benjencoldhands_knew/,Hey_its_me_Frank,1498064102,"Re-watching the scene where Benjen/Coldhands drops off Bran and Meera near the wall, all of B/C's actions are with the purpose of revealing Jon's parentage to Bran.


1) B/C takes Bran off his horse and specifically places him next to a weirwood so Bran can look into the past.


2*) After placing Bran down next to the weirwood, B/C lingers ever so slightly and winks at Bran just as he gets up, a subtle action that says, ""I know what I'm doing.""  (Note: I think this is a wink, but with his facial scars and the lighting it might just be a weird angle on his eye.  If he doesn't wink, it's not a dealbreaker.)


3) After B/C mounts his horse to ride away he says as a farewell, ""I wish you both good fortune...""  Now I know that this is a somewhat commonly used phrase in S6, but following his words, he stares at Bran knowingly and lingers absurdly long.  It is literally 6 seconds of him just staring.  This is what acting is all about: saying something with your body language.


4) After B/C rides off, we get a shot of Meera looking confused and Bran looking around before his eyes drift to the weirwood face.  **LIGHTBULB!**  Bran puts it all together and makes a beeline for the face (or as much of a beeline as he's able to).  Bran has only heard that phrase once before in his on-screen life, during a very dramatic and influential trip back in time.  He knows what B/C is referencing and goes straight back to the point where he left Ned at the ToJ.  Next we get the big reveal and everything is wonderful.


All of B/C's actions in this scene point toward him know about Jon's parentage.  My guess is that Ned told Benjen the full story about the Kingsguard and Arthur Dayne (the fight, famous last words, etc) but maybe he found out some other way.

If you're skeptical, please just re-watch the scene with this in mind.  I'm willing to bet B/C's actions will convince you.

I imagine this goes without saying, but this only applies to the shows, so r/ASOIAF, just cool your jets and appreciate a good scene from the show that may or may not appear in the books.

**EDIT / TL;DR - Benjen sets up Bran to look back in time and learn R+L=J by placing him next to a weirwood and strongly hinting that Bran should re-visit the Tower of Joy vision.**",50,105,False,spoiler,,,,,

Simply put the Night King is Bran.  
  
The Night King will mortally wound Bran, when he does Bran will use his powers to warg into the Night King in the past.  
To not cause a ""time paradox"", as in maintaining the timeline (as the three eyed raven says you can't change the past), Bran is forced to do everything the Night King did including raising an army and all the atrocities he commited. This means it is Bran who marks himself (explains why the Night King can see him, he can see himself), it also means it is Bran who kills the three eyed raven. This would explain why the three eyed raven seems sad and accepts his death as something ""destined"" when he dies.  
  
Night King Bran is basically forced to do everything the night king did as he was the one who did it. The time loop is closed when Bran kills himself in the future and ensures that he was warged into in the past. As for what Bran (the night king) does after, it could be that when he is defeated - he wargs into Bran the builder and builds the wall and fathers children - making him his own great ancestor.

I think this could be during the possible death of Littlefinger for three reasons:

1. They don't show Sansa saying it which leads me to wonder if they had shown the scene, there might have been a spoiler. 
2. Littlefinger has never been part of a pack in the same way as a house like Stark, Lannister, or Tyrell, for example, operates. He has been one the most prominent metaphorical lone wolves looking out solely for himself regardless of the actions taken to bring him ever-closer to where he wants to be. Not to mention I'm not sure how many other lone wolves there are for Sansa to say this to. 
3. Sansa's voice sounds separated from more of a monotone voice in the beginning then in the next audio bit, a whisper. Maybe it's simply my imagination dreaming this up, but I could definitely see her whispering to him as he dies regardless of the cause.

It could be her encouraging Jon not to face the white walkers on his own, not that I think he would. Jon is both smart enough not to try something like that and knows enough to not need Sansa's counsel. Though it wouldn't seem like Sansa would kill Littlefinger seeing as he's been loyal to her throughout the show, (Killing Joffrey w/ O. Tyrell, getting her out of King's landing, killing Lysa when she was threatening Sansa's life, bringing in the Vale to save her and Jon) the show likes to throw in twists and shocks as we've observed, and anything can happen. I'm aware this is a reach based just off of an audio excerpt, but thought the wolf speech could be allegorical, and if it turns out to be true, you heard it here first. Just thought I'd throw this out there. 

First time I've posted something here. If I completely missed something let me know, I'd love to hear other opinions or more reasons why this could make sense. Thanks for reading. Excited for July 16th.",74,90,False,spoiler,,,,,

From the Television Show perspective,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/6ink1u/main_spoilers_revisiting_jon_snows_parents_theory/,theuone,1498067959,"I do understand how popular(or confirmed) R+L theory is, after the last aired season, and It obviously makes a lot of sense from the book perspective. But since the episode has been aired, it keeps bugging me as to why they did not disclose the father's name. And considering the fact that the book and series can and might go in different directions what if the series flips the theory.

And continuing the same line of thought I was thinking of usual suspects and it occurred to me that timeline in the series is not as well defined as the book. So what if Tyrion Lannister/Targaryen is the father. I know this has been discussed before. But a couple of thoughts,

1. As per awoiaf.westeros.org, there is a difference of ten years between when Tyrion was born to the year in which Lyanna died. But the series has no such timeline defined. So they could very well co exist for longer.
2. There is no news of Tysha, after Tywin apparently 'gave her' to his soldiers.
3. Both had dark coloured hair. Tysha had black hair and Lyanna had brown hair. Enough similarity to embellish the fact in the series.
4. There is almost zero interactions between Ned and Tyrion throughout the series. So no way to tell what he felt about Tyrion.

Any thoughts?

Is this the foreshadowing of the death of some Stark? A Stark who is alone, and left out from the pack. There are only three Starks left: Bran, Sansa and Arya. If this is truly some foreshadowing, then who do you think will die? My bet is on Sansa Stark, who during the course of the Season will be left with Littlefinger to rule Winterfell, while Arya goes to war with Jon, and Bran to provide evidence (with the help of Howland Reed?) that Jon is half ice, half fire. And, during this time, Littlefinger plays another gamble by holding Sansa hostage when he sees that he can't be king even of the ""ashes"", and in the end, Littlefinger will for the first time lose control of the situation and kill Sansa and for this, Jon will kill him (that part in Trailer 1, anyone?)

I did a quick google search on it, and I found an article of someone having had similar thoughts. 
It is in regard of Game of Thrones aiding the debate on climate change, and I would love to hear your thoughts on it.

First a quick disclaimer; I'm not one of those climateheads that wants to shove climate change morals down everyone's throats, so if you disagree that climate change is real; That's fine, I won't argue with you. Personally, however, I do think climate change is a real threat, and that this theory, if true, makes GRRM a true genius. 
Also minor SPOILERS if you haven't seen the new trailer, towards the end of the post. I've marked it with SPOILERS before it as well.  

So to the theory; 
In essense the theory is that everything South of the Wall represents all of humanity, and the White Walkers represent the threat of climate change.
It is not very hard to draw lines between Westeros and Essos and the real world: Slavery, racism, wars, different religions, religious extremism. Add that on top of the underlaying threat to humanity, that everybody has heard about, many believe to be true, but do litte about, and very few deny.
My theory is that GRRM wants to tell the world that none of the protesting, wars, fighting amongst ourselves. None of it matters in the slightest, if we can't unite and fight together against the one ultimate threat to humanity; White Walkers/Climate change. 
I mentioned in the beginning that the new trailer supported this theory, and these are the lines I was referring to; 

SPOILER on the new trailer if you haven't seen it. 
- ""Our ancestors fought together against their common enemy, despite their differences. We need to to the same, if we are going to survive""
- ""Because the enemy is real. It's always been real"" 

Thoughts?

From the [Wiki page](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Faith_of_the_Seven) the Seven is 7 aspects of one god. So far in the story we have a few different gods with confirmed power(s). 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***^The ^Seven ^aspects***
 
**The Father:** represents divine justice, and judges the souls of the dead

**The Mother:** represents mercy, peace, fertility, and childbirth. She is sometimes referred to as ""the strength of women""

**The Maiden:** represents purity, innocence, love, and beauty.

**The Crone:** represents wisdom and foresight. She is represented carrying a lantern.

**The Warrior:** represents strength and courage in battle.

**The Smith:** represents creation and craftsmanship. 

**The Stranger:** The Stranger represents death and the unknown. It is rarely prayed to.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Right now the confirmed gods we have are The Red God, The Old Gods, and The Many Faced God. The White Walkers could go here as well but I am unsure of how to categorize them, however what is clear is they are in a war with The Red God. 

From all of this I have abstracted an interesting Matching game of who is who. 

**The Father** is *The Red God*. The Red God has judged the dead upon a red priest praying for the dead and grants divine justice by bringing them back to life. The Red God is also commonly referred to as R'hllor or 'The **Lord** of Light'.

**The Stranger** is The Many Faced God. 

*The Old Gods* I have trouble narrowing down, but I believe they could be **The Crone**. The Old Gods at this point are seemingly interchangeable with *Bran Stark*. Bran knows ""all"" through Weirwood.net and combining this theory with another common fan theory. The foresight The Crone is known for could be Bran becoming Bran the Builder, and building the wall in effort to hold off the White Walkers.

**The Mother** is *The White Walkers*. As far as we know, new White Walkers are created from Craster's Son's after being originally created by *The Children*. I can't think of anything showing **the strength of women** more so than Craster's daughters being repeatedly raped by their father, their sons being taken and turned into monsters or their daughters raised to live in the same hell they have been put through. 

Other possibilities for unconfirmed gods: The Warrior being The Drowned God. The Smith being Gendry and The Maiden being Lyanna Stark.

-------------------------------

Conclusion: GRRM has dragged us through an ugly divorce battle between The Lord of Light, and The White Walkers. I'm not sure what started it or how it will end but it's clear.

&gt;""There will come a day after a long summer when the stars bleed and the cold breath of darkness falls heavy on the world. In this dread hour a warrior shall draw from the fire a burning sword. And that sword shall be Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes, and he who clasps it shall be Azor Ahai come again, and the darkness shall flee before him.""

In the trailer (At about 1:06) we see Beric using a flaming sword. Now I know what you're thinking - ""But Fluffguck, he used a flaming sword before, and it didn't mean shit!"" Hear me out. If you watch the trailer closely, you see the sword is not lit until he grips it. 

See here:

[Flame Off](http://imgur.com/VhGVmWR)

[Flame On](http://imgur.com/z8SvQxX)

So what, right? Maybe something lit it on fire, and he's used the flaming sword gimmick before. 

Except, the fire originates from his hand. See here:

Beric used a flaming sword before, but this was before the end of the long summer (the prophecy specifically states Azor Ahai will appear *after* the long summer), and may have just been foreshading.


Now we already know that Beric can, for no explained reason, be revived by followers of the lord of light. Further, Thoros cannot explain how he knew to revive Beric, as if the idea just came to him. He is also shown to be largely just, a rarity in this show. Lastly, Beric claims that every revival has cost him a large piece of his memory, with his current state rendering him unable to remember almost his entire life. What if this is way of establishing a 'clean slate' so he can awaken as Azor Ahai, and avoid any weird dual-personality rubbish?

Unless there is some mechanical reason that this sword (which, if you look closely, doesn't appear to be covered in anything flammable) can ignite itself from Beric's hand, I think the trailer just dropped a huge hint that Beric, not Jon, is the prince that was promised.",15,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

So earlier today I was rewatching GoT for the thousandth time and was on the final episode of last season, the Winds of Winter. I noticed something interesting during the scene with Dany dumping Daario like last week's garbage. When she first says he's not coming with her, he assumes she is sending the Second Sons elsewhere to help in the war effort. Daario is a smart man and a skilled tactician, so I thought it was interesting that he assumed she was sending him to Casterly Rock, so that when the main assault on King's Landing took place the Lannister's would have nowhere to run. That just makes a ton of tactical sense, but Dany dismisses him so quickly that you don't think twice about it.

Link: https://youtu.be/x6EIcOECVk8

After watching the new trailer today however, I'm convinced Dany was paying more attention to Daario's advice than was first apparent. During the trailer there is a scene that shows Grey Worm leading his forces into a cave-like hole in a rock wall. With Tyrion formerly overseeing the sewage systems at Casterly Rock, I (and admittedly several other redditors before me) don't think it's too big of a stretch that the cave is actually the entrance to the sewage system of the Rock. A scene shortly after that shows the Unsullied opening the gate to a fortress, allowing more Unsullied to storm the castle. Therefore I believe Dany sent Grey Worm and a small band of forces to take King's Landing, following Daario's sound advice almost to the letter, albeit without him or the Second Sons.

Let me know your thoughts, and sorry if someone on here has already posted something similar. But like I said - I'm a noob.

It's from the first book. Ned was telling Arya that they needed to stop fighting each other. I saw some people thinking Sansa was applying ""the lone wolf"" to Jon. Sansa is remembering the lesson her father taught her and is referring to herself. Basically, if she doesn't stick with her family, she will be a lone wolf, and she won't survive.


""Let me tell you something about wolves, child. When the snows fall and the white winds blow, the lone wolf dies, but the pack survives. Summer is the time for squabbles. In winter, we must protect one another, keep each other warm, share our strengths. So if you must hate, Arya, hate those who would truly do us harm. Septa Mordane is a good woman, and Sansa... Sansa is your sister. You may be as different as the sun and the moon, but the same blood flows through both your hearts. You need her, as she needs you... and I need both of you, gods help me."" - Eddard Stark

My theory is that once Bran crosses The Wall, he'll unwittingly enable the White Walkers entrance south of The Wall by breaking The Wall's magical barrier. 

In addition to this, Uncle Benjen saves Bran from the Walkers at the end of season 6 and escorts him to The Wall. Uncle Benjen is sort of half-white-walkered at that point. So the theory is that he's actually some kind of mole - half-white-walkered in order to allow Bran to trust him into being an escort to The wall.

We see in the second gif Jon chopping down a man (wildling/wight?). After viewing the trailer a hand full of times, we initially see Jon standing atop of that rock structure (in the 1st gif), with who i assume is Beric due to his burning sword. So we know Jon and his company (beric, tormund, maybe the hound), go North, are atop that rock structure, then get surrounded by a ton of wights (we also see Jon fighting a WW in the trailer). We then have this scene of Jon off of that rock structure (currently on fire in the back) chopping down a man w/ what looks like wights surrounding him.

My initial reaction was, ""lets gooo Jon!"". But after viewing it again, why would Jon look so calm in a moment like this? Has me wondering if he has turned full wight or White Walker (since it looks like he is surrounded by them). In the trailer we also have a shot of a man on a horse (who i believe is Jon based on hair/Long Claw on holster) who looks to be injured and fleeing. Could this possibly be after the battle?

I have soo many questions after viewing this trailer. Does Benjen come in to save the day? Does a Dragon fly in to save the day? Does Jon get turned into a full fledged Wight?",7,8,False,spoiler,,,,,

Daenaerys banded together with the Dothraki, Tyrion, and the slaves. Yara is joining with Daenaerys. Jamie in a smaller way joined with Brienne and will make a move in this season, betraying Cercei (a lone wolf) and join the pack.

The remaining Starks (including Jon) have all had very unique mentors and experiences that have left them with unique skills. Individually, they each have serious weaknesses, but Combined, they are a force to be reckoned with:


**Jon is the Commander.**

His major mentors were Eddard Stark, Ser Rodrik Cassel, Lord Commander Jeor Mormont and Mance Rayder.

Jon learned how to lead, especially to lead men into battle. He is a man of honor; a man who others will choose to follow. He inspires loyalty, and will stand at the head of the northern army.


**Sansa is the politician.**

She has learned her lessons from Catelyn Stark, Septa Mordane, Cersei Lannister, Tyrion Lannister, Littlefinger and Ramsay Bolton

Sansa learned how to play the game of thrones. She learned how to plot and scheme (I know Tyrion) by being used as a pawn over and over again. Littlefinger more than anyone taught her overt lessons on how to get what you want. She is not encumbered by honor like her father or Jon. She will be able to make hard decisions easier than Jon Snow, and can act without his knowledge to achieve a desired goal, allowing him to retain his honorable appearance while solving a problem. She would be helpless facing the army of the dead (where Jon will excel), but she can out-think and outmaneuver an enemy off the battlefield (unlike Jon and her father).


**Arya is the fixer (or the Assassin).**

Her mentors have been Syrio Forel, Yoren, Tywin Lannister (Roose Bolton in the books), The Hound, and the faceless men above all.

Arya is a killer without scruples. She is the Ray Donovan or Mike Ehrmantraut (Breaking Bad) of the Starks, willing to do whatever is necessary to get what she wants (mostly vengeance). She can take a piece off the board with relative ease. If Tywin Lannister were still alive after she returned to westeros, she could probably kill him and escape with relative ease.


**Bran is the scholar (aka, the greenseer)**

His Mentors have been Maester Luwin, Osha the Wildling, Jojen Reed and the Three Eyed Raven.

Tywin Lannister told Tommen that the most important quality of a king was Wisdom, which is exactly what Bran brings to the table. His own life experience is limited, but he can travel through time to view basically any event in Westerosi History, and experience is the foundation of knowledge. He is an encyclopedia, who can illuminate many mysteries of the world (such as who created the white walkers, and who Jon's parents are), but he is also a powerful weapon (probably more powerful than an army when the enemy is the white walkers). His body may make him the weakest Stark, but his mind makes him the strongest and most important. With the other three protecting his person, his mind can protect the realm of men.


**tl;dr:** So there you have it, Jon can lead men into battle, Sansa can play the game of thrones, Arya can kill anyone causing problems, and Bran can teach them what they do not know, and fight like no one else can (perhaps by controlling dragons). 

Individually they all have gaping weaknesses; Jon's honor is his weakness (ask Ned Stark), Nobody would follow Sansa into battle, Arya could never rule, and Bran's legs make him completely dependent on others. But they combine to form a team that can defeat any enemy and rule without rivals.",15,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

Many people have pointed out the flaw in this plan because of the lack of trees on the Iron Islands, but I have a completely different thought as to how this won't work. That is, who will man the ships? How many people does it take to carry out the functions of a ship, I wonder? 10, 20? If it's 10 then there has to be no less than 10,000 fighting men in the Iron Islands still loyal to Euron. If it's 20 then there has to be 20,000. Does anyone happen to know the population of the Iron Islands? It was my understanding that those Islands were barren and it's always been hard to sustain life there. Hence Theon saying ""they're a hard place, and hard places breed hard men"" or something along those lines.


The wiki states that

&gt;According to a semi-canon source from 2005, the Iron Isles can raise approximately twenty thousand men and five hundred longships.


Okay so if 20 men are required for each ship then it will be fine, but how many of those 20,000 are left after the ironborn's failed conquest of the North? And how many did Theon and Yara take?

Don't get me wrong he was a bad person, but I dont see him as that much worse than many other characters in the show (havent gotten through all the books yet so I wont comment om those). He did rape Sansa which was probably his worst act, but outside of that and maybe torturing that girl in the woods, all of his actions have been to improve his standing in the world (killing his father and mother/brother), as with a legitimate brother now in the family he would most likely be cast out when brother comes of age to rule. As far as not giving Winterfell back to the Starks from his perspective it was granted to house Bolton by the crown so legally it is his right as the lord to hold the castle and fight anyone trying to take it back. I also don't see his treatment of Theon as anything other than cruel justice for Theons actions. Theon betrayed his lord and gad everyone believe he had murdered 2 stark princes. I think Ramsey doled out justice for those crimes. In my opinion Ramsey's only truly evil acts were raping Sansa, murdering that girl in the woods for sport, and maybe killing Rickon (although again Rickon posed a threat to his claim to Winterfell as the North might rebel against him with a living stark). I'm not saying Ramsey is a great guy, but if you see the larger picture of why he did most of his acts, he isn't any worse than Littlefinger, Meryn Trant, or the Mountain who are all bad people but do not receive nearly as much hate as Ramsey due to the perspective that is used to portray him.",23,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

So yea I've been rewatching a lot of old material the last couple weeks, though oddly enough for whatever reason, out of order. But it occurred to me, an aspect of Dany's character that, far as I can tell, hasn't been brought up or referenced in any way whatsoever in a LONG damn time, and actually it's wound up making me doubt myself a little bit in a way. Because if I do have this right, I don't see how this WOULDN'T likely become a MAJOR element in her story throughout these last 2 seasons. But if my thinking's off here, please do set me straight.

DANY CAN'T HAVE ANY KIDS!!

I mean, I don't have this incorrect, no? Just that with that whole mess of how the ""witch"" did her thing with supposedly trying to have the birth of Dany's son (but then subsequent death.. womp womp) supposedly paying for the saving of the life of Drogo in season 1. Regardless of the witch's ulterior motives, it still left Dany without the ability to mother any more children. So she can't help further her family line any more. I suppose with what we know about John now, HE can still keep the Targaryean blood line alive, but not with HER (since I've seen plenty of people say they like the concept of those two joining together by the end and marrying). But yea even the people who would be in total support of the idea of Dany taking the iron throne and being queen, would they still hang in there if they realized she can't provide any more sons or daughters? So like, perhaps would an attempt of trying to keep this a secret from anyone else potentially be a big story point the last two seasons? It just seems like the awareness of this fact for a greater number of people is sitting out there like a ticking time bomb.

We know the White Walkers have the same powers that Bran has to explore the past, so is it a possibility that during their battle up north that episode, Jon fights off a large portion of the army of the dead, and theres a brutal, sad massacre of multiple characters up north accompanying him. 

And then when it seems Jon is going to die again, and all hope is lost as the Night King approaches him, he enters Jons mind and presents him a series of visions. 

Then, we get a better elucidation of the intentions and motives of the White Walkers, so they dont come across as an exclusively evil force. Quite possibly, they have a great respect for rules. And also a possible agreement with the Starks, as there are theories that they signed an ancient peace treaty with them, and the reason a Stark must always be at Winterfell, is because the White Walkers will only honor peace mediated by the Starks. And Winter can only fall through the Starks (Winterfell). And the Night King after it all presents him with an opportunity to join them. If Jon refuses, they might take matters into their own hands and force the issue. 

And convert him into a White Walker, as the Night King was converted before him. By force, with an obsidian dagger to the chest. 

Then the whole of the realm is in serious trouble, because the legitimate heir to the Iron Throne is a White Walker being forced to claim his birthright. And were suddenly left with Jon Snow as the primary antagonist of the song of Ice and Fire.

I'm familiar with the 7 Starks/7 faced God theory. However, to whit I haven't seen this theory really discussed. 
That said, here goes:
I'm calling it The Living Seven for lack of a better title. 
I have a theory that the 7 are a prophecy, and that the 7 are characters who we already know. I haven't matched each of the 7 just yet, but here's my best guess. 

The Mother: Danny. We have already seen her called Mhysa, and we know she can be merciful. 
The Father: John Snow. The Father judges the souls of the Dead, and we've seen Snow hacking down White Walkers (the dead). 
The Maiden: *Unsure, Clearly the theory needs mopping up. I suspect it could be Sansa. 
The Crone: Varys. The Crone is depicted as a woman with a lantern, and is supposed to be wise. Varys slinks about with a lantern, and is definitely wise. With his...pride...having gone the way of Theon's, it's possible the prophecy is mistaken. 
The Stranger: Arya. We see Arya changing faces, remaining a stranger. She's also become a pretty serious agent of death. 
The Warrior: The Hound. Strength and courage- we've seen plenty of strength and burgeoning courage.  
The Smith: Tyrion. Creation and craftsmanship- we've seen creativity and craftsmanship such as his defense of King's landing against Stannis Baratheon. 

Towards the end of the last season we see this group on a collision course, and there's no reason to believe the group wouldn't work together. 
It's a little half baked. Go easy. I'm new here.

I don't think it would be likely for Jon to swear simple fealty to Danny and just go back to being warden of the north after the story starts wrapping up. I think it's much more likely that Jon and Danny end up married. 

This leaves Sansa as warden of the north. Tyrion would likely take over house Lannister. Gendry somehow ends up head of house Baratheon. 

And at the end of the series the heir to the throne, Danny and Jon's son, begins to show hints of madness. Bringing the story full circle and showing how sometimes things just never change ",19,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

*  The wall door will open twice I think, once to let Bran and Meera pass and once to let Jon and his team go north.
* Some people in the crowd are clapping in the KL shot. I think it could be when Euron brings Ellaria/Yara/both as prisoners to Cersei.
* People arrive on the shores of Dragonstone on a boat. Could be either Dany and team or Jon and Davos accompanies by some guards.
* Arya looks at something on a horse, shocked, possibly a Stark banner at Winterfell.
* Jaime walks along the battements of KL(?)
* The Tyrion shot could be the continuation of the ones we've seen in previous promos
* The speech Jon gives could be when all the lords meet up at KL to discuss the threat of the Night King. They need to fight together the same way they did to depose Aerys/to end the long winter centuries ago.
* Grey Worm is gonna go into that cave which may end up inside Casterly Rock via the sewer system, which Tyrion knows inside out.
* Bran wargs into a Raven, and we have a shot of the Night King looking up, but I don't think that's what actually happens. I think he actually looks up to see Dragons
* Euron's fleet sailing to KL
* Unsullied open the gates from inside, which mean they do get inside through a tunnel or something
* Shot of Dany turning around should be when she meets Jon
* Is that the Hound in the dragonpit?
* The shot of Dany and Drogon could be when Jon sees dragons for the first time, and to everyone's surprise the dragons are friendly with him (hints of R+L=J to Jon and others)
* I think that's Jon injured, riding away on the horse after Benjen saves him and dies.
* We see a situation similar to BotB with Jon standing in front of thousands of wights, and that may be when Dany intervenes

Mainly about the prince that was promised. 

Aka: Azor Ahai.

It is foretold that he would return. (Born from the ashes). With a sword of fire. Well, Melisandre currently interprets this to be John. After Stannis decided to step out. He was reborn. From death. Some also think it's the mother of dragons. More literally from the ashes. 

But this has all happened to Baric Dondarian as well. Right? He weilds the sword. He had been brought back to life what 7 times. Each time losing a little part of yourself. 

But this leads me to another. Who was originally believed to be that prince? Was it not Rheygar Targeryan? He died as well. And if fate were to choose him, would have risen from the ashes too. From death. But what if it was from the same red priest that Baric knows. He has been raised 7 times. 

What if Baric = Rheygar ? Could they be the same person. Things like to take an unexpected twist in this series and who best to be the prince than the person who has been down played. The usual suspects taught me that. 

From what I understand you need to be pretty important to be raised just once. So how important is Baric? Could he be 7 times raised from Rheygar? If he was really him, it could make sense. Since you lose a part of yourself. He's a different man than he used to be. Was his groups original goal not to put an end to bad people. Though it may have been twisted since.

I feel like it is more him that queen of the dragons. And that some theorize that it's the king Slayer. Jaime.

If true, it could also mean that Baric (Rheygar), John, and Dany are all the 3 siblings to ride the 3 dragons. I buy it more than Tyrion being a Targeryan. So far at least.

Keep in mind I have not read the books. So there may be bits I'm missing.

The gate opening to the north of the wall that is shown in the trailer does not match the gate shown at castle black (the bottom of this gate is flat and shown when Jon returns from hardhome but the gate in the new trailer has a different bottom).

I was wondering if anyone else noticed this? 

To expand my theory is Jon and Tormund sail to east watch after meeting with Dani to travel north of the wall. There they meet up with the Hound and Berrick Dondarion who are traveling north. Both groups join together to meet up to go north of the wall for some purpose (gathering proof of the Others or walkers for Dani or Cersea or people in Westeros who do not believe in such things). I personally don't think this would be a smart mission.

 To take it a step further I think davos stays with dani and works to convince her to join Jon and take a Dragon after them (awful lot of flames in the second trailer where Jon is alone fighting what look like zombies and after being with a group including Berrick and Tormund. Then he is suddenly alone?). I think Dani or a dragon (maybe Bran does some wording?) go and  save everyone but Jon (who is cut off or falls off the dragon) and then barely gets away on his uncle Benjins horse (shows up just in time?) who dies trying to save him. Maybe the last parts a reach but anyone agree about the castle gate theory?",3,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Cersei's line at the beginning of S07T01 ""Enemies to the east, enemies to the west, enemies to the south, enemies to the north, whatever stands in our way, we will defeat it. We are the last Lannister's, the last ones who count."" Compared to Baelish's line"" Don't fight in the north, don't fight in the south, fight every battle, everywhere, always, in your mind"". 

With knowledge of the situation of Cersei (a crumbling power) and Baelish (an ascending power with growing competition), one sounds a call to rally the troops and allies; the other planting seeds of doubt and dissent. Cersei is probably talking to her brother, who is confronting her with bad news, and that is her cry of resoluteness and fierceness to fight. Baelish instead is probably talking to Sansa, telling her that the enemies aren't only in the North (White Walkers) or in the South (Lannisters or Targaryens), but are everywhere, and must be always wary, ready to confront any potential enemy.

The two trailers then end with calls of unity. S07T01 ends with Seaworth's line ""If we do not put aside our enmities, and bound together, we will die.  And then it doesn't matter who's skeleton sits on the Iron Throne"", closely followed by Jon's line ""The Great War. It's here"" S07T02 ends with both Jon's and Sansa's call for unity. One recalling the history of houses fighting together, the other with the allegory that during winter the lone wolf dies, but a wolf pack survives.",3,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

I'm organizing a fantasy draft for season 7 and would like your guys' help. Ideally, in this draft, each player would draft one tier 1 character (Cersei, Jon Snow, etc.), two tier 2 characters (The Hound, Grey Worm, etc.), and two tier 3 characters (Robin Arryn, Ghost, etc.). I made a [spreadsheet](http://imgur.com/a/zDefV) of these tiers, based pretty much on their tiers from last season (provided by the website that does these fantasy leagues). I moved some characters around (for example, moved Sansa to tier 1 from tier 2), but have left some in their older tiers that probably don't belong (for example, Yara Greyjoy, a top 10 points finisher in season 6, is a tier 3 character). 

Based on the spreadsheet I provided, are there any tier changes you would make?  Thanks!

Plus, it's been years since season 1. Both epic and depressing events are going to take place soon. So regardless of what happens to any characters, I'm hoping that Little Finger finally gets his due...

I'm not saying I hate the character. He's very well written, and the actor portraying him has done a tremendous job bringing him to life. But he's the reason or the main catalyst for everything that has happened to Ned's family. Even though his scheming predated the first season (or book), it felt like everything went extremely downhill for the Starks when he betrayed Ned in Joffery's court. I don't care if it's Sansa who gives the order, or Arya introduces Needle (or some other clever weapon) to his throat, I just want it to happen. My vote is for Arya.  

There are numerous other events or character fates I could have mentioned (blows airhorn), but I can't help but think this is my number one. Anybody else feel the same way? ",7,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

Now yes I may be thinking to much into it but it did get me thinking what just happened. Here are some of my theories:

A. She was meeting Jon and she and Jon awkwardly kissed or had a forbidden temptation or something like that and Sansa just storms off confused.....Okay probably not that but there is other theories.

B. She just got word that Bran and/or Arya have arrived and she is walking away to see them again.

c. and this one is the most likely in my opinion and that is that Sansa was meeting with Littlefinger and right as you think she is on his side she stabs him in the heart or neck with catspaw (or just a random knife) and she walks away from his body.

Obviously he wanted him dead after not liking his son for being a dwarf, BUT, this does not explain why he did not investigate the actual case further.

Behind closed doors, you would expect him to investigate who the REAL person who did it was.

Based on Martin's penchant for and description of bitter sweet and what the Starks have been through, I believe they will all reunite as an immensely powerful Direwolf pack. 

Bran: Greenseer and warg, a mystic oracle is being built up to be even more powerful and knowledgeable than the Three-eyed Raven.

Sansa: Shrewd ""Gamer"" and Politician, cold and calculating. Allusions being made that due to her witnessing and experiencing the Game in King's Landing and being mentored by Littlefinger. She has already displayed cunning, albeit reckless in the sense that her moves have the goal of benefiting her. 

Ayra: Master Assassin and Killer, trained in stealth, cruelty, and death. Bravosi water dancer, wilderness survivalist, desensitized to extreme violence, able to fight in the dark, and a Faceless woman. 

Jon: The most tested and experienced leader and warrior in Westeros. Trained at Castle back, lived with the Wildlings in the North, skirmished with turncoats and mutineers, defended the Wall in impossible odds, faced and battled wights and White Walkers, united the Wildlings and the North, conquered death, and retook Winterfell. No one is more fit to battle and fight in the North and the real threat than he is. 

And of course, Ghost and Nymeria. 

So far they have all been alone and away from one another. The circumstances in which they were separated and what they have had to endure as lone wolves has nearly killed them all many times over and left immense psychological scars yet have made them who they are. They had to endure the betrayals and murders of their father, eldest brother, mother, and youngest brother. They will be united again as a terribly powerful force and it will be a incredibly sweet feeling, but the weight of what it took to get them to where they are will forever be a bitter taste in their throats and horrible burden.

So the Rider could be Jon, but how the hell did he get a horse?

- Well, the answer could be really, very easy. It's Uncle Benjen's horse...

In the trailer we see Jon's company being surrounded by walkers, so maybe, just like in the last season, Benjen arrives just right on time to save Jon (ONLY JON, CAUSE JON'S WHOLE COMPANY IS ALREADY DEAD), but the walkers clearly outnumber both of them, so he makes Jon to flee the battlefield and sacrifices himself, buying time for Jon to get to the safety.",11,8,False,spoiler,,,,,

Do you think we will see them actually interact, one on one? I figure that we'll have to- so much build up, for them to never even meet.

I'm totally hyped, open to feedback (hope I got all the spoiler labels right), and  I hope this theory wasn't mentioned already. Also: not a native speaker, please have mercy on my foreign soul.*

A common theory is that Dany will somehow eventually end up with Jon in a romantic way. The ice-and-fire-theme, the whole buildup of the series, and their similarities just seem to match up. But let's be honest: This is GRRM we are talking about, so he's been probably practicing his evil laugh all summer long, because this would be too romantic, too cheesy, and simply too good to be true for GoT. So here's a scenario I could imagine:

**Dany ends up with Jamie.**

This is a possibility that would have a nice twist and would fit three main characters in particular:

**Dany:** She likes to have a good looking guy around that she can jump into bed with from time to time. At the same time, she's not the kind of person to develop deep emotional feelings for a man, and she doesn't have the time for that anyway. Her true and only passion is the Iron Throne, if she would get emotionally involved this would be only a distraction. In an [interview](http://sstylemagazine.com/trending/iron-maiden-emilia-clarke-060910108), Emilia Clarke said herself:
&gt; I think that she has ultimately put aside her own need for a man, she says. She is so engaged and wrapped up in leading and being the queen and ruling and fulfilling her birth right that the idea of someone coming in and sharing that title is probably something shes not comfortable with.

Therefore, if she will ever have a partner again at all, it will probably be someone less of a ""main character""-type than Jon.

**Jamie:** Cersei has been the love of his life, but she's been going way over (or under?) the line on the [hot-crazy-scale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agy6KOSwyA8) over the past few months. He's disillusioned. And while there are tons of theories, that he will be the one killing Cersei eventually, adding ""Queen-Slayer"" to his title collection, it's not that far fetched that he will eventually find (to love) someone new. Dany kind of fits his type, too - at least hair-wise. At the same time he is used to being the subordinate part in a relationship (if we forget for a moment about the fact that he raped Cersei next to the corpse of their child) and giving all the attention and power (!) to his woman without any claim to it - exactly what Dany needs. Plus: It would kind of result in a family reunion with Tyrion, and that's just so sweet.

**Cersei:** She must have been thinking about her [prophecy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwHGNoMjHn8) a lot lately (that all her kids would die and a younger, more beautiful queen would come along and take all that she holds dear). She might have thought that these two dramatic events belong together, and that either Sansa or later Margery was this queen. Her kids are in fact dead, but the queen is yet to come (whether Cersei still expects it or not), and the only things the she still holds dear are the Iron Throne (very much) and Jaime (at least a little). Taking not only the political power from Cersei but also stealing her partner, brother and only friend in the world would be the ultimate heartbreak for her. At this point, she wouldn't even mind to be killed any longer.

**I like the idea of this, and would also say that this would be quite a GRRM-thing to do. These were my two cents, let me know what you guys think!**

*TL;DR: I could imagine Dany hooking up with Jamie as his obedience would go perfectly along with Dany's lust for power. Plus it would drive Cersei mad and would be her ultimate defeat.*",42,26,False,spoiler,,,,,

I hope the Night King is powerful and have some more spells than the ones he has shown this far. The telekinesis on the ground outside the three eyed raven cave and raising dead people with just a move with his arms.

In the trailer we see Berric, The Hound, Jon and probably Tormund and that alcoholic pedophile priest. What's his name? Thoros? He is kinda cool. But nvm. We see them hold their ground against thousands of incoming undead &amp; zombies. And later Jon somehow breaking through(?) and reach a small hill/platform and stops. The zombies hold their ground because probably the Night King is holding  them back and is coming forth upon that hill. I guess Jon and the Night King will fight? A duel?

All other spoiler tags remain the same and do not cover this content.**

So far, we've tried to avoid allowing discussion on leaked production spoilers as far as possible, because it lowers the risk of accidental spoilers.

But, with their quantity and how often we're seeing them pop up without tags, it's obvious that this won't be possible. There's a fairly large group who want to be able to discuss the upcoming season with the knowledge they've gained from fan sites, and there are those who don't want to risk being spoiled in [Everything] posts, where leaks aren't allowed.

---

##**So, we're introducing a new tag. Here's a basic rundown of the system:**

* ***New* [S7 Production]** - This is a free-for-all. Leaked production spoilers are fine. Don't go into posts like these if you want to stay unspoiled, in any way. Do go into these posts if you don't care about spoilers, and want a discussion on those grounds.
* **[S7]** - Trailer details are fine, and all the aired episodes, but no leaked production spoilers that have come out through media reports etc.
* **[Everything]** - This isn't changing. Trailer details are fine, show details are fine, book details are fine, but again - no leaked production spoilers. This might seem counter-intuitive given the name, but it's just a quirk of spoiler systems on Reddit.
* **[Main Spoilers]** - Again, this isn't changing. This is for people who want to discuss the show/books, but don't want to know anything about the upcoming season - not even trailer info.

**Do not discuss the leaked production spoilers spoilers outside of [S7 Production].**

---

We've discussed this at fair length, and based it largely on the survey we asked people to fill in a while back (thanks again to everyone who responded) - but we're still very much open to feedback. And if you have other meta questions regarding the season ahead, this is probably a good chance to get those out of the way too.

But hes currently on a course to create more bloodshed in Westeros than has been seen in anybodys lifetime in the form of an overpowered Targaryen invasion, which seems contrary to his deepest motives. 

I know Cersei just blew up the Sept of Baelor, killing a ton of people indiscriminately, political enemies and innocent civilians alike. But Daenerys has the capability to exact that type of death toll basically anywhere Drogon feels like breathing.

So, within the swing of the battles after enough people have died and Varys starts to realize just how destructive Daenerys can be, will Varys at some point make a move inconsistent with his recent moves but consistent with his core belief that useless suffering for the realm should be avoided at all costs?

While I think this is a valid opinion (especially when you compare her to other performances on GoT), there may be an explanation for her seemingly flat portrayal of The Mother of Dragons. 

If you look back at season 1, Clarke's performance appears much more compelling and, I believe, it really does justice to the character. This could be partially chalked up to better writing and more interesting character development. But at the same time, what it tells me is that Clarke can be a talented actress. So instead of blaming the rigidity of Daenarys on the acting, I like to take a perspective that helps me better enjoy her scenes...

Nearly all her life, Dany has been under the complete control of someone else. This stemmed mainly from her brother, but she was also used as a pawn by Illyrio and I'm sure others along the way. Even when she gained a little power as a Khaleesi, she only had it because of her husband, Drogo. We see her develop more confidence during her short time as a Khaleesi, but when you've been a helpless child your entire life, those feelings don't just disappear. Dany must still have plenty of self-doubts. Even as Queen of Mereen, she was extremely reliant on her advisors and rarely made independent decisions that she stuck to. This doesn't mean that Dany is a poor leader or still just a pawn, but she's also not the ultra-confident and unwavering figure she pretends to be. Clarke's seemingly flat acting is a representation of the character herself trying to act. Dany wants people to see her as strong, steadfast, and self-assured. But, there's a part of her that's still an uncertain child. When you consider this theory, it allows you to better appreciate/understand Emilia Clarke's Daenarys Targaryen. I realize there's a chance this idea isn't valid, but it's still an easy way to make her story a little more entertaining. Let me know what you think :)",48,86,False,spoiler,,,,,

**Probable Season 7 Spoilers!**

This theory has some fairly strong evidence of some pretty major deaths to come in season 7, so turn back now if that doesn't interest you.



The tale of the last hero goes as such:

""He set out into the dead lands with a sword, a horse, a dog, and a dozen companions. One by one his friends died, and his horse, and finally even his dog, and **his sword froze so hard the blade snapped when he tried to use it**.

The most convincing fact here is this shot from the trailer, where we can jon snow, presumably, leaving the major battle alone, wounded, and **without longclaw in its sheath.**

* [Floppy Sheath Link](http://imgur.com/a/z2Gk9)

You can see the sheath is VERY floppy and couldn't have a sword in it. 

Here is where we see the 12 companions in Peril, probably as jon is fighting elsewhere solo at the end of the trailer.

* [12 Companions Link](https://i.imgur.com/g1kNM0m.png)

In addition, there is also speculation that the horse he is riding isn't his own in this post below. Again, giving speculation to the line about even his horse dying.

* [Horse Speculation Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/6iutil/everything_the_horse_in_the_trailer/?utm_content=comments&amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=gameofthrones)

---------------------------------------------------

So from what we can gather, Jon Snow enters the major battle with his twelve companions, ghost, and long claw. And is shown leaving with none of those things.

He will enter and will leave under the exact circumstances of the last hero, allowing history to repeat itself. 

Its heavily implied that Jon's companions include the hound, beric dondarion, tormund, possibly gendry, and some other A-Listers. Can you imagine how depressing it will be if they all get slaughtered? Seasons 7's ending definitely has the potential to be the ""Empire Strikes Back"" of the series in terms of leaving our heroes completely crushed and having to seriously regroup to defeat the big bad.

Maybe he even defeats the night king in that scene and season 8 is something completely out of left field. Maybe the night king spares him due to some upcoming twist. Who knows. 

The last piece of speculation here is that game of thrones used the marketing line of **""The lone wolf dies, but the pack survives""** for this shot. GoT loves the old switcharoo, and this theory gives the viewer the opposite of that expectation. The pack dies, but Jon Snow survives.

**TL;DR, there is some decent evidence that Jon is the only one coming out alive from that all-star assault.**

Bonus Speculation: Perhaps we see the shot of Jon acting not concerned about the icy battle around him is because he has been made aware that he will be the only survivor no matter what.

**Edit: To the people claiming he has had a ""Floppy Sheathe"" before, watch the trailer. The way it moves definitely looks like it is empty. Not just ""Bendy"" like in that famous BotB clip.**",167,159,False,spoiler,,,,,

I had not read anything on this matter, and it is something that I have theorized over the last 3 seasons. I am by no means the creator of this theory, but people who I have explained this to seem to think I am crazy. 

I want to present some evidence before I provide a more cohesive explanation for how it all comes together. 

1) Tywin consistently says ""You are no son of mine"" in some for in regards to Tyrion. Now simply this could be easily a Dad being angry that this child is a dwarf and more importantly killed his wife at birth. 

2) Tyrion has extremely blonde and almost white hair. 

3) Aerys easily and likely raped Joanna because he could do it without repercussion. In addition, Tywin was in no position to protest the occurrence of it because of the Targaryens holding the throne. 

The above is clearly seen in the show and books. Also, as a second source I would like to add this link, as I have read his piece. https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1exibx/spoilers_all_is_tyrion_andor_jaime_cersei_a/

Now I want to add a piece from the show that in my opinion seals the deal, yet is so subtle at the same time. In season 6, episode 2. Tyrion goes to the chamber with Varys to unchain the dragon. Before they go to the chamber, Tyrion asks Missandei a question about the dragons. He asks her if they have ever hurt her or been aggressive towards her and they have not. Tyrion says that the Dragons are very smart and ""more intelligent than men"" according to some maesters. Tyrion goes on to say that they will show affection to their friend and have fury for their enemy. Tyrion says ""i am their friend"" Varys follows by asking, ""do they know that?"". Tyrion replies ""They will"" 

This is my first addition to the theory. It is fair to say that Tyrion would have no clue he is a Targ, but this in my opinion is the 1st step in truly introducing Tyrion Targaryen. The preceding conversation I included was essential to establish the fact the Dragons can sense the beings around them. They can naively determine if a man is friend or foe. 

Now comes the second portion of the scene. The unchaining of dragons. I will include the video to explain and visually show the interaction so i do not mis-tell the scene. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8hGAcZ8cJI

The dragons, while initially intimidating relax in the presence of Tyrion. As Tyrion tells the story of how he always wanted to ride a dragon and have one himself, he releases the dragons and the Dragons trust him enough to motion for them to be released. The dragons did know Tyrion is a friend.  As in when he approaches the dragons, the dragons will know he is a friend, not he will inform them he is a friend.  

Personally, I feel that this whole scene is GRRM telling us that we have much more to see from our favorite dwarf. The story he tells is pointless otherwise. He could have just released the dragons in good faith without the story, but with Tyrion telling the story, the show is able to tell us who Tyrion truly is in the most subtle way. Remember we know 2 of the 3 heads to the dragon, one more must pop up. 


I firmly believe Jon, Daenerys, and Tyrion will ride the three dragons. Let me know what you all think. I know this could have been better written, but I feel this is will be a reveal that will surprise people. Especially if they heard the theory and are in denial.

I think this is probably the most plausible since it's not unusual for the movement of a token/mark/symbol to symbolize an invitation in many stories.

I just had a random thought upon the upteenth viewing of Trailer 2. Please note, I take full responsibility for this not being fully-baked. It is a random thought.

What if Jon contributes to the destruction of the Wall?

He is technically ""undead"". The Wall was built by Bran the Builder and the Children to keep the Walkers and the ""undead"" out (as Benjen mentioned he can't cross as an undead man)  but what if the warding magic doesn't work from within?  Maybe they didn't anticipate Qyburn-types making undead things. 

If Bran passes through causing a crack; the Wall is weakened and subsequently Jon passes through from within breaking the magic completely. Once the warding magic is gone, the Night King can just smash through the physical Wall. 

*TL;DR* Jon Snow and Bran's passages through the Wall from either side breaks the warding magic and the Walkers can enter.

I was originally going to make a list building up to my least favorite until I realized that I actually do like just about all of the acting in this show save one person:

Sophia Turner.  Man, the trailer's opening and the focusing on her face just....argh.  I don't think it's the writing of her character, which actually IMHO is quite good and I can see how the writers attempted to quickly mature the naive little girl that fell in love with the wrong guy.  But the actress herself just doesn't strike me as believable.  I do not get the feeling that there's anything going on in her head.  It may be due to some of the interviews she's given, but she strikes me as extremely shallow.  The one scene where I will definitely give her credit was the scene where she turned and supported Littlefinger by lying about how Lysa died, oh and she gave one hell of a great slap on Robyn's face, but other than that I cringe every time I see her on camera.

I'm sure there are a lot of fans of Sophia Turner, and I'm also sure a lot of people were expecting the Sand Snakes or Olly to be the focus of this post, but alas, it's Sansa.  If you're so inclined convince me otherwise!  Or join me in this roasting!

This new trailer fancies the line, the lone wolf dies but the pack survives. Everyone seems to be relating this quote to Jon and his group past the wall. The line is very explicitly foreshadowing the death of Jon (the lone wolf) and the survival of his group (the pack). But the trailer also shows most likely jon on his horse, alsp probably alive. I mean DD wouldnt kill jon snow fucking AGAIN....right? 

Ok lets assume that he lives (which he probably does), but that would mean the opposite of the quote is happening. The Pack will die...but, like, will they? DD Likes throwing these curveballs, so wouldnt be too surprising for them to do the exact opposite. And thats the thing, itd be too easy. I mean im certain that people will die, but the whole pack? I dont think so. Gendry is very likely a part of this group, and if they kill the pack theyll probably have to kill him too. But they wouldnt kill him right after bringing him back. So, jon probably lives, th3 pack should more less survive, which would give this hint of foreshadowing no credence. (Maybe it is also possible that ghost, the last remaining wolf that gets any screentime at all, will sacrifice himself to ensure the survival of jons group, but thats just a thought)

But lets think about this, if anything, Jon Snow isnt really a lone wolf anymore. I mean this guy has literally the fucking north on his side. Jon was named the white wolf, but not the lone wolf.

But you know who fucking is lonely as a motherfucker right now, Arya fucking stark. Shes a lone wolf. Weve also heard rumours of her meeting nymeria this season, with HER PACK. Im thinking that DD may have put that line in, implicating the possibilty that arya will sacrifice herself, in return to save the Pack, possibly directly referencing nymerias pack, or also possibly doing it to save the rest of her siblings, thus allowing the pack to live on. 


TL;DR i think arya might die to save some sort of ""pack"" whether it be the stark kids or nymerias wolf pack.

This will only work in the show, as book Sansa owns a hairnet instead. I realised that Sansa still has the necklace with the Strangler poison. If she learns from Littlefinger about its use, and it seems like Arya might potentially reunite with Sansa, it might be possible that Arya will disguise as Jaime, give her the necklace as a ""gift"" while spiking her wine with the poison.

When the poison takes effect, Arya will strangle her with the necklace and break her neck, as revenge for how Joffrey executes Ned. While it's not necessary to physically strangle her, Arya might still do it for the sake of revenge.",10,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

We have never received a time jump before, as every season has started directly where its former left off, but I think it'd make sense to do one now.

There are some people in the trailer who appear to be very far from where they last were. Obviously, they can travel, but it seems like there would be a lot of travel involved.

For example, Jon looks like he is beyond the wall, because winter is fiercest there, and the Others are everywhere. The Hound, Beric Dondarrion, Thoros, and the rest of the Brotherhood without Banners were heading North. But there is also a shot of Jon in Dragonstone. So when does he get to Dragonstone? Before? After?

So, Jon is in Winterfell until the Brotherhood without Banners makes it there from the Riverlands, and then they go beyond the Wall, and then he travels all the way south to Dragonstone. 

Now, this can be done in a season, there's no doubt. But I think it's more logical for us to start the season off with Jon and the brotherhood at Castle Black, about to storm past the Wall.

The only arrow in this theory is the shot of Bran and Meera coming into Castle Black. Or did they go to the Nightfort? I can't remember where Coldhands/Benjen took them. Either way, that's the only dagger.

Many people have brought plenty of possible indicating details of this from the books, but I was struggling to find any specific support of this in the television series. Until I was happening to rewatch season 4 and I paid special attention to this scene.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cudxwhDO0gQ

Things that stand out:

* Oberyn notes that Varys gives off the air of nobility to the point where people over estimate his level of birth.
* He knows that Varys is from Lys (claiming to recognize his accent). When Varys points out that he no longer has a Lys accent, Oberyn's quip boils down to ""well I just know you are from Lys"". This CLEARLY causes Varys a moment of concern, something difficult to achieve with the master of whispers 
* When Varys says ""most of us aren't princes"", Oberyn snickers and responds ""you..."" pausing for a moment before continuing onward.

I feel like if people can look at Littlefingers reaction to Sansas recount of Rheagar and Lianna and say ""This mufucker knows something"", then like Oberyn was definitely hinting that he knows Varys is actually a highborn from Lys. 

What I find most likely is that Oberyn may have trained with the Golden Company during his time in Essos, there he may have learned about whatever it is that Illyrio and Varys set in motion with Daenerys.

Being as they have not really mentioned the Blackfyres in the Tv series, I doubt that Varys would be revealed to be leading some plot to restore the Blackfyre name to Westeros. But judging by the fact that we know from that scene that Varys has at least some desire for the iron throne, it would seem likely in the series that he plans to double-cross Dany at some point.

 speculation from scenes as seen in the trailer, so nothing leaked) correctly.

So I was just watching Smokescreen's breakdown of the new trailer for the 7th season and I came up with this. The Hound was there when Ned Stark tried to remove Joffrey from the throne and was then betrayed by littlefinger, and he was close to the Lannisters all the time so we can assume he knows most of the plots. Now the Hound moves to Winterfell with the Brotherhood, and we know he is going to go with Jon to the North since we see him in the snow and we also see Berric fighting with Jon in the North. So can't we just assume that if he indeed meets with the Starks, and sees that Littlefinger is there, won't he tell them that he is the one who betrayed their father/uncle?

I believe he won't go to Casterly Rock, and if he does, it will be later in the season, after he makes an important stop at another major city.  

**He's going to Highgarden.**  

There are a couple clues to this, but we weren't able to start really putting the pieces together until the most recent trailer came out.  

**The first clue** was a brief scene of the Dothraki fighting Tarly soldiers in the previous trailer. Why would Dany be fighting the armies of Randyl Tarly, her ally Olenna Tyrell's bannerman?  

**The second clue** came in the latest trailer. There's a brief scene of Jaime walking along the ramparts of what looks like it could be King's Landing or Casterly Rock... except one eagle-eyed viewer pointed out a dead Tyrell man on the ground, leading speculation that this is in Highgarden. But what's he doing there?  

Our only direct experience with Randyl Tarly is that he's a hard, military-minded jerk who values power and might above anything else. With House Tyrell's virtual eradication at the hands of Cersei, I believe the new Queen will offer to make Randyl Tarly the Warden of the South and Lord Paramount of the Reach in exchange for his loyalty against the shattered Tyrells and their alliance against the invading Eastern hordes: Unsullied and barbarian Dothraki, neither of whom he would respect. She'll send Jaime, a military man and leader of House Lannister. Together, Jaime and Randyl will capture Highgarden, which is where that scene with Jaime on the ramparts will come from.  

It's after the sack of Highgarden that the Lannister/Tarly forces will encounter Dany's Dragon &amp; Dothraki army, which is where the scene of Tarly men being jumped comes from. Jaime's lion-charge on the flaming battlefield is probably from this battle scene as well.  

Now, none of this means that Casterly Rock isn't being takenwe know there is a force of Unsullied there (Dany divided her armies). And it doesn't mean Jaime won't eventually go there, either to attempt to free it, or alone after his army has been ravaged. We don't have enough information. It's possible that the shot with Jaime, Bronn, and the wagon train is his army en route to Casterly Rock from Highgarden when the fighting breaks out. We'll learn the details soon enough. :)

I was rewatching episode 10 of season six. Lyanna Mormont had an interesting strategy at the meeting of the Northern Lords. 

She called out those who refused the call and then urged people to make Jon King. The houses late to the war effort like the Manderlys and the Glovers were obligated to show even more zealous support for Jon. That's why they crowned him King.

Because not supporting Jon at that moment would make them look even worse. Jon could at that moment wipe them out for not honoring the call. 

This echoes Tywin's sack of Kings-landing. Because he joined Team Robert last, Tywin said he had to kill Rhaegar's children brutally to show his seriousness in killing Targaryeans. 

As to why the Northern Lords chose Jon over Sansa, Lyanna Mormont's initially chose Jon. To rebuke her and pick Sansa would not only sow discord, but plant their political demises should Jon seized power in the end. 

For the Manderlys and the Glovers, they really didn't have the political capital to disagree with Mormont.

I will start by saying i loved the trailer, probably the best one yet but am i (hope not) the only one who thought it showed more than it should have?

I will pick two examples to try and explain what i mean.

1) ~~Jon Snow's speech and~~ the way he appears dressed later in the trailer just confirms he is meeting Dany

2) The battles 

-With the shot showing the Unsullied opening the gate from the inside it seems confirmed that Casterly Rock will be taken.

-Then it shows Jaime rushing on horse with a lance in a field of fire... Jaime is supposed to be the general and not really someone fighting because a) the Lannister forces need him alive for his commanding skills and b) he can't really fight without his best hand which makes me think this is a desperate move in the end of another lost fight for the Lannisters.

-Finally comes the sea battle between the Greyjoys and it seems safe to assume Cersei and Grejoy take the best on this one and that Yara dies in the process. Why else would [Theon](http://i.imgur.com/e1XjZIR.png) be kneeling like this with someone who looks like Euron behind him? Maybe he wins the fight anyway and is just exhausted and sad because of his sister's death but to me it seems like a sign that he lost the fight.


Of course this includes a lot of assumptions but i think they are logical, at least in my point of view. I get it why they would show more of this battles than they did on other season's battles because this one has less episodes but i think the difference was in some shots that they should have not placed in this trailer and just left out for the audience to find while watching the season for the first time.

Then there's Bran at Winterfell, The Brotherhood with Jon going on an expedition and etc but those ones i understand since they were kinda obvious, those characters had nowhere else to go really.

Thanks for taking the time to read and for your replies, just wanted to share this opinion to know if anyone agrees with me.

I know how OP Dragons are, I mean Aegon conquered, and brought a country to the feet of one ruler (with the exception or Dorne) to his feet, I know how powerful they are, I mean after all, they fly and breath fire, what more could anyone ask for in a war? But I feel like people are forgetting the fact that Dragons can be killed, I mean, after all, Rhaenys and her Dragon Meraxes were killed by the Dornish, and I believe that was with one big fucking arrow.


I see people saying that Drogon riding above the dothraki, charging at the enemy is cool, and believe me, I think that too. But, if I'm not mistaken, the Tarlys are very good marksmen, with alot of archers, and alot of arrows. It only takes one of the hundreds of arrow to hit drogon in his eye, chest, or enough through one of his wings which might effect his ability to fly, so sending Drogon, Rhaegal and Viserion straight into combat when Daenerys already has a huge army, wouldn't be a smart move, yes, flying the dragons above, in clear sight of the enemy would be good, because I don't know about you, but if I was fighting for any House, and I saw three Dragons up above, id nope the fuck out of there before the battle even started.


In addition to this, I don't think its incredibly wise for Dany, or any of her most trusted advisers, to be riding any dragon into battle. Remember, if the dragon falls, so does the rider, so why would Dany even risk herself? Not to mention she had Rhaegar and Viserion locked away for the better part of a year, and as Tyrion said, Dragons do not do well in chains. So, for all we know, Drogon might just be the most ""tame"" of the three, riding Rhaegal and Viserion might not even be possible.


I know all of this is just my opinion, but I think that the logical thing for Dany to do would be to use her Dragons in scare tactics, to weaken her enemies mentally, and then, once the battle is almost won and done, she could ride in and clean up, and feed the Dragons at the same time. Now, believe me, I would fucking LOVE to see Dany and her dragons in active combat, but I'd be pretty bummed if she lost say two of them, I think alot of people are confident enough to say that at least one of her Dragons will die, but if she pushes it too much, she may just lose them all.


So yeah, thats my two cents on the whole topic, I hope she fights with them, but not in a stupid way that results in them being seriously maimed in anyway, I mean look at what the sons of the Harpy did to Drogon with spears in S5, that sure put him out of action for a couple of weeks.",53,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

Me and a bunch of friends play the Pen-n-paper RPG (This weekend they'll be attending the Red Wedding, so that'll be fun). But I was re-reading one of my history books after watching Rains of Castamere to prepare for this week's game, and noticed something I thought was kinda weird/fun. Robb Stark and Charles XII of Sweden (Better known as Carolus Rex) are a lot alike. While I'm certain the Starks have inspirations from lots of Scandinavian history, this one stood out to me. I feel explaining this works best if I explain the history to you, so bear with me, I'll try to be short.

Gustav II Adolf (Better known as Gustavus Adolphus) was a brilliant man who made decisive intervention in the Thirty Years War on the Lutheran side, particularly with the battle of Breitenfeld. Unfortunately, Gustav was killed, and a triple alliance of Poland-Lithuania, Russia and Denmark-Norway was formed to stop the Swedes from becoming too powerful.

Carolus was the next great king of Sweden after Gustav (there were a few in-between them, but the parallels don't really fit for anyone else), and went to war to fight the triple alliance. Despite overwhelming odds, Carolus won many battles, particularly Tsar Peter's Russian forces, which greatly outnumbered the Swedes. Carolus was a military genius, and only ever lost one battle (To my knowledge), but was politically inept (In my opinion, which is a bit controversial). Whether through his lack of political skills or through a people sick of war, he slowly began to lose support among his people, and his army, whose morale ran low.

Eventually, a major defeat at the fields of Poltava struck him, and his army lost purpose and momentum, with many of his soldiers wanting to go home. Despite this, Carolus would not be defeated, and made a plan to attack a major enemy stronghold in Norway that was relatively undermanned, Fredriksten.

History has a big debate on what came next, but one way or another, he was killed before the attack could be carried out, either being betrayed by his own, or being assassinated by his enemies. It's my opinion that he was betrayed, but this is up for debate. Either way, he died and his army fell apart, as well as his Swedish Empire.

I'm probably thinking about this too much, but doesn't that sound exactly like Robb Stark? You have to use your imagination a little, and account for Game of Thrones being a story, but the parallels stand out to me:

Both had a predecessor who was considered great, and decisively intervened in a great war (Eddard Stark in Robert's Rebellion, Gustav II in the Thirty Years War). They were both military geniuses who only ever lost one battle (I'm counting the Ironborn sack of Winterfell as a loss for Robb). Their loss ended the momentum of their army and lost their purpose, causing their soldiers to want to go home, but they resolved to restore momentum with a great battle at a relatively undefended enemy stronghold (Casterly Rock, Fredriksten). Before this battle could happen, they were betrayed and killed, destroying their armies and their kingdoms.

I'm probably looking into it too much.",3,11,False,spoiler,,,,,

Bran making the mad king go crazy won't have been for nothing, so maybe Bran caused all this wildfire to exist and now they can save the world with it.

1. a Miscarriage. Very Likely

2. Daario. I know this will sound crazy but for starters Daario has black hair in the show (and yes in the books he has blue hair though that is dyed hair), the timeline fits, and it would add more to his character.

3. A new character we have not met yet. This is also very likely that the son of Brandon Stark and Ashara Dayne is just a completely new guy or girl we have not met yet no one like Jon or Daenerys or Aegon just some new original character we have not met yet. This would also be a cool twist maybe he is under the alias of Howland's bastard paralleling Ned and Jon or maybe we meet him bumping in to Arya and tags with her traveling back to WF.

So the stark kids have good relationships w their wolves and targaryens rode dragons. House sigils represent a family and their lifestyle but a few houses tend to have control over their sigils. Tyrells harvest is the largest of all houses they the rose makes sense. The mormonts don't control bears and the lannisters don't control lions. My point is some specific houses have closer relationships with their sigils th an others.

So my theory regards the greyjoys. The kraken. So euron manipulated his ass into the salt throne. He's the best commander the iron born and kings blood. Asha/theon has the best ships and daenerys on their team. So what if euron pulled some greyjoy shit and brought a kraken to the fight. Dragons couldn't really touch a squid and it would explain why asha, theon and daenerys's forces (based on my s7 trailer assessments) could have lost the sea battle to euron.

In addition, with hbos budget a kraken scene could be super cool lol.",64,126,False,spoiler,,,,,

What a journey the last 17 days have been, and I loved every second of it. From the first scene in Episode 1 to watching Khaleesi ride across the narrow sea at the end of Season 6, never was there a question why this show receives so much hype. 

Just wanted to say thank you to this subreddit and its amazing community. Originally I posted to just let people know how much I liked the first episode, until a couple people mentioned to continue with updates. Figured sure, that sounds like fun, but never did I imagined it would grow into a post that passed the length-limit of 40,000 characters, topping out at 48895. Nor did I think that there'd still be people there reading the updates at the end of Season 6, but there they were, keeping me company the whole time, like friends on a couch watching along with me. 

 It was surprising how welcoming members of this sub could be but it just made watching each season that much more enjoyable. Being able to comment my reactions and get live feedback from people with deeper knowledge gave me an experience with watching this show that I've never had with any other. 

For the updates, almost 99% of them were made by pausing the show the moment I had the thought occur to me. It'd usually cause me to be hilariously wrong, but in a few rare occasions, gloriously right. It was interesting to see how few and in between I'd write them at the start compared to the amount at the end, and watch myself grow as a fan of this show. 

Probably the best thing to come out of all of this though, it the fact that I get to join all of you now for Season 7. That was the original goal set out in my first post, and I couldn't be happier to have achieved it in time. Shows like Breaking Bad and The Sopranos I had to watch after the final seasons had already aired, but I knew this show would be talked about more than either of those two combined, and I just had to be a part of it live. 

Grab a coat everyone. *Winter is here.* 


Major thank you to

for being the names I saw constantly in my inbox, helping me out along the way. Honestly without the three of you commenting towards the end, I doubt I would have finished updating past season 3. *You the real mvps.*

This ones on top and that ones on top and on and on it spins, crushing those on the ground. Were not going to stop the wheel. Im going to break the wheel. - Dany T

Just thinking there are so many houses now that either don't have heirs (either all dead or only bastards), or ladies that may or may not have children/carry on the family name. Daenerys Targaryen lists them all, in this quote. The Lannister twin's kids are dead, Gendry is a Baratheon bastard, only male child that has the Stark name is Bran and we don't even know if he can have sex to make people. Olenna Tyrell herself has said the Tyrell house is done for with the death of Loras and Margaery. The only house Daenerys doesn't list is her own, and she believes she can't have kids.

Of course it's possible that all of these lines won't die out. Tyrion could still wed and have kids, saving the Lannister house. Gendry could be legitimized. Sansa may finagle a way to retain the Stark name in Winterfell, she or Arya (unlikely) could at least insure that the Stark blood remains in in the north through marriage. Jon Snow could be legitimized as a Stark or a Targaryen if he can prove his father is Rhaegar (to himself and others).  That leaves the Tyrells. There are [unnamed cousins in the books and show apparently](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/House_Tyrell#Current_Status) but they may all be women. It's possible after the war to come the titles of 'Lords Paramount of the Reach' and 'Wardens of the South' may go to one of their vassals, maybe House Tarly to Sam's brother or House Hightower. It probably will depend on who can prove their loyalty to whoever wins in the end. Also unnamed are the Greyjoys. Theon may possibly have a salt wife bastard he doesn't know about yet. Yara could perhaps survive and have kids but she has the same problem all women of the surviving houses have. Women generally take on their husband's name in this world... although whoever rules may be able to override that perhaps.

I'd be interested to see if that backfires on the Starks though... It's no mystery that Robin loves Littlefinger and that Petyr takes advantage of this. I think that if Sansa kills Littlefinger it would anger Robin, possibly to the point of the Vale then switching sides again. I think Robin would go to the Lannisters, swearing loyalty to the crown on the condition that Sansa and the rest of the Starks are destroyed, avenging his beloved uncle.

When he pointed out the similarities between Jon's mission in the North and the legend of The Last Hero I started to wonder how they would integrate The Last Hero's sword freezing and breaking into it. If Jon's mission does mimic the legend then he'll probably just drop Longclaw and lose it (wouldn't be a first). But I was thinking that when Jon is kicking ass, perhaps the Night King will emerge personally to fight him. It's already been established that White Walkers can shatter weapons other that Valyrian steel, so to show how much more dangerous the Night King is than an average Walker maybe he'll simply grab Longclaw and shatter it. It would be more accurate to the legend as it would involve his sword freezing over and breaking in his hands and would further demonstrate just how serious the Night King is.",2,6,False,spoiler,,,,,

They are trying to make us think it is about Jon. Jon is not a lone wolf as he has so many people around him and working with him to save the realm right now during the Long Night. That includes the Night's Watch, the people we see in the trailer in the North with him, Sam working at the Citidel to learn something, etc.


I think it has two meanings:

1) Sansa's mentor is the biggest Lone Wolf in the show. Who is Littlefinger's pack? No one, he shifts alliances all the time. In the summer you can have these squabbles but in the winter there is no time for this. Basically, she can either go the Littlefinger route and die like the lone wolf during the winter or join the pack. 


2) That line is also a big metaphor for the realm as well. We hear Jon's voice over talking about working together. During the Long Night, it is all about survival and working together. Because if not, you die. The Lone wolf dies and the pack survives.

The story thus far, as we approach its final act, has certainly been set up in such a way that such a bleak ending could feasibly happen without it being a diablous ex machina, and obviously this is a very dark and gritty franchise as a whole where tons of good guys die throughout, so what I'm ultimately trying to ask is: who here would, with these established dark facts being considered, be accepting of a truly tragic ending for the whole thing, provided it was written as being basically what we currently fear might end up happening but still hope won't, i.e. in a way logically-consistent with what has been established up to this point, not coming out of nowhere?

Alternate version of this scenario for additional consideration: what if the White Walkers won, and GRRM's reason for writing this was to use the series as a warning on climate change?

I, personally, would be very upset if the series ended this way, to the point of regretting ever getting into it. I generally don't mind downer endings in single-volume works (Shakespeare's tragedies are obviously the ultimate, archetypical examples of such negative resolutions being done well), but for a long saga published over many years with long-term audience-investment in the characters and setting, a happy ending, or at least some loose semblance thereof in ASoIaF's case, is generally much more imperative.",17,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

There have been some events in the show that have caused some people to stop watching altogether; either a death of a favorite character or some sexual scene that the viewer felt went too far. Here are a few examples of scenes which definitely caused some viewers to bail-out of the show: the death of Ned, the death of several starks in the red wedding including Rob and Catelyn, and the rape of Sansa by Ramsay Bolton. So my question is: What would it take inside of the show to make you not want to watch any more? 

For me the sexual violence in the show is much more difficult to watch than pure violence alone. The scene where the night's watch deserters rape Craster's daughters was really hard for me to watch and consequently I skip over that scene every time I re-watch the series. But I'm still here so obviously I didn't stop watching, but if that continued I would have stopped watching for sure.

Consider:

&amp;nbsp;

* Targaryens typically have light hair.

* Targaryens have a history of incest.

* Barristan's quote about ""two sides of a coin"" perfectly encapsulates Jaime and Cersei - Jaime is the ""greatness"" side of the coin, Cersei is the ""madness"" side.

* Cersei is obsessed with wildfire just like Aerys (in the books, her POV goes even deeper into this when she burns the Tower of the Hand).

* I'm not sure if this is addressed in the show, but we know from the books that Aerys lusted after Tywin's wife Joanna Lannister, and there are rumors of him ""taking liberties"" on Tywin's wedding night.

&amp;nbsp;

Thematically, I also think Cersei and Jaime are much better candidates to be Targ bastards than Tyrion. Consider:

&amp;nbsp;

* George RR Martin loves irony in the series. Tywin shuns Tyrion, saying he only has one true son in Jaime. The truth could well be that Tyrion is in fact his only true heir and offspring, which to me fits perfectly with GRRM's style of usurping expectations and making characters eat their words.

* GRRM likewise does not like wish fulfillment. The plotline of Tyrion Targaryen becoming a dragon rider goes against much of what the tone of the show has set as precedent. It's too ""shiny"" of a plotline to fit in the series. Alternatively, Jaime's redemption arc would culminate nicely if he turned out to be a Targaryen and master on of Dany's dragons (along with Jon Targ, perhaps?)

* Cersei believes Tyrion to be her *valonqar*, but it seems obvious that Jaime is the more likely candidate, again fitting better with flipped expectations and dramatic irony. But if either Tyrion or the twins are Targs, it certainly can't be Tyrion.

* Cersei has fought so hard to protect her children from the ""bastard"" label. Again, the dramatic irony of her herself being a bastard would fit well into the show.

* Robert's hatred of Targaryens and his hatred of his wife would coincide. Not a huge point, but worth noting.

* Jaime and Tyrion would both have committed patricide. Jaime is haunted by ""kingslayer,"" but currently the ""kinslayer"" title belongs solely to Tyrion.

&amp;nbsp;

The two main issues arising from this theory are the same two that threaten the ""Tyrion is a Targ"" theory: 

1. Timeline. When did Aerys rape or lay with Joanna? The wedding night uncertainty seems like a better bet than any proposed union after Jaime's and Cersei's birth, which would have been necessary to support the Tyrion Targ theory.

2. Consequence: What's the point of having any of the three be Targaryens? I think, for Jaime and Cersei, the main points center around their characters and the tone and irony of the series. Jaime's potential dragon-rider status, Cersei's valonqar fears, Tywin's favoritism, Tyrion's commitment to his family name, and the twins' relationships with bastardism are all brought to light better through Twin Targaryens than Tyrion Targ. What could this mean for the future of the characters? Only GRRM really knows.

&amp;nbsp;

I haven't read one like this yet, but if you have please let me know.

So I think that both Jaime and Tyrion will be responsible for her death. I think Jaime will take her and himself out because let's face it TV Jaime is not gonna distance himself from Cersei not even in death.

I'm thinking he might show up battle ridden and tired to Cersei after practically having lost the war against Dany and the others, he begs her to run with him to abandon the throne, Casterly Rock, to abandon Westeros. She'll refuse after all it's Cersei. She'll use the reminder of the wildfire to deal with the approaching enemies.

Jaime will see her true madness and in attempt to end the madness and end it all he will kill her, but he won't or can't live without Cersei by his side. He'll probably embrace Cersei so that her guard is down and will impale himself and her with a sword, widow's wail anyone? 

But she won't succumb to the sword wound alone. As she will pull away bleeding from her wound she'll look at her dead lover/brother, her twin and weep. In her grieving madness she'll not notice Tyrion who will be the final killing blow and ends her misery by strangling her like prophesied.

I don't think it'll happen this way, but I wish it was Cersei who managed to bring it down. She realizes that she's about to face a war on two fronts, with Dany getting ready to invade and The North still in open rebellion. Taking a page from the books we get the short sighted Queen who thinks she's playing 3D chess but is actually playing Hungry Hungry Hippos. She still has a huge amount of wildfire left, and she wants to punish the treasonous northern lords. Or its her last option as she's losing the war and she decides to bring the rest of the realm down with her. Someone actually does bring her proof of the White Walkers or she hears about them from someone she trusts, so she decides to send Castle Black some ""reinforcements/supplies"" from The Capital. A wagon supply train that has a couple wagons full of wildfire. Her men arrive at Castle Black talking a good game about realizing that The Wall needs reinforcements now that winter has come, and ask if they can rest for the night prior to heading back. Some time during the night Edd wakes up hearing the main gate opening and horses making noise. He looks out the window and sees a man who was guarding the gate laying dead and the Queens men hauling ass out of Castle Black. He runs outside towards the main gate and sees fire behind him, then turns around and sees half a dozen wagons on fire in the tunnel leading beyond the wall. And then they blow up, right in the one weak spot of The Wall... underneath it. 

I just think something like this is way more believable than someone the Nights King touched breaking a magic barrier, or someone blowing a horn. It fits in with Cersei's character, her complete lack of seeing the big picture. Like I said, I don't think anything like this actually *will* happen... I just wish it would.",21,16,False,spoiler,,,,,

- Littlefinger will continue to push Sansa to turn on Jon

- As others have speculated, The Hound will arrive at Winterfell and inform Jon of Littlefingers betrayal of Ned 

- Jon will take Baelish down into the crypts before confronting him near Neds statue, eventually killing him and further confirming that reborn Jon is cold and ruthless 

- Jon visits the Vale to explain Littlefingers meddling plans, and to personally ask Robyn for help in the wars to come (this is where we hear the ""our families have fought side by side..."" line from the trailer"")

- While at the Vale, a raven arrives saying that Dany is in Dragonstone and claiming the right to the iron throne, demanding the great houses to bend their knee or face her wrath

- Jon takes the opportunity to visit her and ask for her mercy and help in the North

- While Jon and Dany are at Dragonstone, Sam Tarly arrives with Arch Maester Marwyn after Sam discovers the prophecy of Azor Ahai (alluded to in promo pics) and Marwyn abandons the Citadel when the raven concerning Dany arrives (as he does in the books)

During all this, Bran somehow passes his knowledge of Jon being a Targaryen on and it is then believed that Jon is Azor Ahai and this is why he travels North of the wall with a group of companions.

3602,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2017-6-26,2017,6,26,1,6jfdnq,self.gameofthrones,[Everything] A theory on .... Death,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/6jfdnq/everything_a_theory_on_death/,Rampage1995,1498409996,"Seven months ago I read a [theory u/Troiswallofhair presented](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/5c8hya/everything_a_theory_on/) on how he believed that all three of Daenerys dragons would die in a similar fashion to the men they were named after. Viserion would die at the hands of Drogon (perhaps after threatening Daenerys after being warged into), and Drogon would be mercy killed by Daenerys after being seriously wounded in battle. Now if this theory did turn out to be true, Rhaegal would arguably have the hardest death to predict. Rhaegal's name counterpart Rheagar died fighting for the Targaryen's at the hands of Robert Baratheon, whose warhammer crushed his chest (god he was strong back then) and caused Rheagar to fall into the trident. For awhile I tried to figure out how Rhaegal's death could occur in a similar fashion and after watching the newest trailer for Game of Thrones for the hundredth time I started to wonder weather a certain scene might reveal how Rhaegal will die. 


In the second trailer, you can see what appears to some sort of [fireball being shot at the Iron fleet](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Mlhnt0jMlg&amp;t=1m17s) (similar to the ones the slave masters used on Meereen in season 6) by Euron Greyjoy. What I'm thinking is Euron uses one of these fireballs to kill Rhaegal. I think what might happen is that Daenerys is going to send Theon and Yara to attack the mud gate (remember Tyrion is her hand, and Tyrion knows how close Stannis came to taking Kingslanding when he attacked the mud gate) while Daenerys and the rest of her army attacks Kingslanding from the other side. It's quite possible that Daenerys leaves one of her dragons (Rhaegal) to protect the ships and attack the mudgate, when Yara and Theon are ambushed by Euron. After seeing how [destructive those fireballs were] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvqzywRDsSw&amp;t=0m10s) I don't think it's out of the question that a direct shot could cave in a dragon's chest. This would also fit in because like Rhaegar, Rhaegal would fall into a body of water after being killed. Granted this theory is depended on Rhaegal following Theon and Yara which he might not be willing to do, but overall I think the theory makes some sense, and it's always fun to speculate on how events might occur.

In the season 5 finale we have Reek helping Sansa escape after the battle. Right before they jump from the walls of Winterfell Reek and Sansa share a look and then grip hands. This is the first time since they've been reunited that Sansa hasn't been repulsed by him, and that Reek finally regains a bit of courage and can look her in the eyes.

I think this moment is his first step away from being Reek into becoming Theon again. We know it takes a while and it isn't until he's on deck the ships at the end of Season 6 with Yara and Dany that he is really ""reborn"" but I just though Sansa and Theon finally just trusting each other was a big step. They realized they couldn't go back and even death from the fall would be better than living under Ramsey another day, especially because they killed Miranda.

Here are some thoughts.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/6jgo2f/tv_i_never_watched_game_of_thrones_until_about_5/,The1WhoKnocks-WW,1498423833,"* What this show does with characters is amazing. Ones i loved I now hate, ones I hated I now love, ones I wanted to suffer have suffered too much... It's really impressive.    
*  I think season 1 was still my favorite. I miss Ned and Robert.     
* I never thought I'd want Tywin Lannister back, but holy shit have things gone haywire without him. If only everyone hadn't treated Tyrion like dirt.        
* I've read a lot of archived episode discussions and... Why did so many people hate Bran? Him and Arya are the two characters that I was sure I like from episode 1, and never had reason to question it.          
* It took me a while to warm up to Jon Snow, and the wall story line in general, but that was the best part of the show in seasons 4 and 5, especially 5.      
* I hated the Sparrows, and I loved the Tyrells. I had very mixed feelings about what happened at the Sept.       
* I was Stannis fan until he killed his daughter. I loved watching him storm Kings landing, I loved his character.  He should have listened to Davos more. He'd have made less mistakes, but no one should think fewer of him anyway.     
* I've loved Danys storyline, except for Qarth which I found tedious.         
* I hope Jorah finds the cure for gray scale.        
* the Mormonts are one of my favorire houses. They kick ass. Lyanna is fierce as a bear should be, and Jeor almost crushed a guy throat after he'd been stabbed through the torso.        
* Sansa is one of those characters that I didn't used to like, but now I love her. She was such a spoiled brat in season 1, but she's more than paid her penance.      
* Speaking of penance, holy shit Theon!. After season 2 I wanted him to get gutted and left to rot. But Ramsey got to a point where I'd said that's more than enough, and then he went on for 6 more episodes. I have nothing but  sympathy for Theon now.        
* Reunions are tough to come by in this show(except morbid ones, like Arya seeing robs corpse with grey wolf's head being paraded around by the freys. ). That made Jon and Sansa meeting at the wall a huge moment. Now if only Bran or Arya could show up.         
* I don't expect many lords to bow to cercei. Taking Westoros might be easier than anyone thinks for Daenerys.     
* The end of Season 6 was full of great revenge. Starks killed Boltons, Starks killed Freys, Cercei leveled the Sparrows. I'm excited to see how season 7 begins.       
* When I met Sam in season 1, I never would have guessed that he'd still be around in season 7.       
* One or two times per season, over the course of the last 3 seasons, they should have cut to a shot of Gendry rowing.         
* This show has killed a lot of great characters, so I'd like to stop and thank the old gods and the new for Bronn.        
* Arya is such a bad ass. I hope she gets to cross Cerceis name off her list before this show is over.        
* I never thought I'd despise a character more than Joffrey. Then I met Ramsey. They both died too fast.       
* Of all the deaths on the show, the saddest for me was hands down Hodor's.

I am willing to pay for them (books, guides, etc) but the goal is to help her along and giving her some reference points to help her remember the names of the characters and their basic information at the start of their character arcs, including what family they are for, where they are from and static characteristics.

But the problem is both Ellaria Martel and Olenna Tyrell were responsible for the deaths of Marcella and King Joffery, the latter leading to false accusation against Tyrion. 

Tyrion seemed pretty fond of his niece, so it would be interesting to see how he reacts to Ellaria upon finding out that she poisoned his niece, if he ever finds out. What if Tyrion ends up betraying Ellaria and The Sand Snakes in some way, like sending her fleet to a suicide mission? He is the hand after all, so he has military authority. 

Regarding Olenna, I can't decide how he would react if he were to find out he was indirectly framed for Joffery's murder. He seemed satisfied that knowing Joffrey is finally dead, but being accused led to his trial, which led to him not only killing his father but also killing Shae, who he loved. Who knows if Tyrion would decide pay Olenna his debts. What do you guys think?

From what we can see in the new GOT trailer, Jaime lannister's army is 100% most likely be at war with the unsullied and dragons. Jamie almost gets killed by dany's army... however as Tyrion shows up,  he see's  dying his brother on the battlefield and he will manage to either control the dragons  or attempt get the dragons killed in order to save Jaime's life...

I've been following this subreddit for a while but this is my first post here, I hope the formatting is correct. Also I'm not a native English speaker, so apologise for my bad English.

So get to the point, I think most of you can agree that the most interesting shot of the new trailer is [this shot of Jon](http://imgur.com/DsWxuu9). I was watching this [Chinese trailer breakdown](https://youtu.be/6ITzzz68XDE) and it raised an interesting point about that scene, basically ""Bran might be connected with the Night King due to the mark so the Night King might come up with a deal with Bran which would be only allowing Jon alone to meet with him"".

I do agree Bran might have a connection with the Night King but I don't think the Night King would form a deal with Bran this early on as the Great War hasn't even started. I'm pretty sure the Night King is quite confident his army can crush Westeros at this stage.

So my prediction is this event would take place after [this battle North of the Wall](http://imgur.com/Y5NvGkk) and Jon would likely be injured and separated from the rest of the crew, escaping with a horse. (Probably Benjen's) But the horse carries him to the Night King (if it's an undead horse maybe the Night King has the power to control it?), as the Night King has shown interest in Jon previously in Hardhome. (Maybe he knows Jon would be the Last Hero?) Then he comes to the place of the shot alone, facing the Night King. (Probably standing in front of Jon in that shot)

The Night King or some white walkers have to be around that place as the the wights seem to stand there calmly, possibly under control. (I'm quite certain those aren't wildlings but wights as you can see their zombie-like movements) Also I don't think the wights couldn't sense Jon as he was dead, you can see wights are clearly rushing towards Jon directly [here](http://imgur.com/Y5NvGkk). The fire behind is quite interesting, it might be from the the flaming sword of Beric Dondarrion, which means Jon might be carried away to the opposite side, or it might be from Dany's dragons.

In that scene the Night King would probably be toying with Jon as it seems like he sends out one wight at a time to fight Jon, like a 1 on 1 combat, to torment Jon with his army of the dead until Jon agrees with his terms, possibly be the next Night King or showing Jon how powerless humans are, or simply just giving him a slow death?

Although Jon slicing the wight like a badass, his energy will run out eventually, then maybe Dany and her dragons would come to the rescue? And maybe it would be the occasion where Jon rides Rhaegal and an epic dragons vs wights + white walkers battle and ends with the Night King killing Viserion and raising an ice/wight dragon? *hype*

When she got to Winterfell, sans dragons, the only person she found was Littlefinger sitting at the pond in the Godswood by himself. Despite her misgivings, she accepted his request to come sit by him and talk. He kept talking more and more quietly until she was leaning over him, then he cut her throat, and the dream jumped to King's Landing where her dragons knew she was dead and burned everything and everyone in their grief, then flew away. Ashes and scorch marks covered the throne room, then dust as time passed. Finally, soft footsteps came across the hall and Littlefinger sat down on the Iron Throne, for he would rather be the King of Ashes than nothing.

What I've been unable to find is a solid discussion about who the greatest warriors are AS OF NOW.. 

So that's what I'd like to talk about here. As of right now, the end of season 6, who are your ten fighters who are still alive and fighting on game of thrones. I'll start with my top ten, giving a brief reasoning for each one.  *also, I'm only including 'living' people so warriors like the nights king and the mountain won't be included.

10. Grey Worm -
Leader of the unsullied. We mostly seeing him utilizing his skill as s general, leading troops in battle... organizing defensive formations, attack patterns...etc but that's not to say we don't have plenty of evidence to support grey worm being one of the deadliest warriors in single combat, in the entire world of GoT. He's fought countless battles, normally dominating wether it's solo combat or an actual battle between two opposing squads. He might not be able to compete with the very elite, but Any average, or even above average warrior is no match for him. 

9. Jamie Lannister -
Would have been number 1 or 2 on this list if not for that unfortunate incident involving his hand... and yes, it did take him a while to get adjusted to fighting one handed.. and left handed at that... but he showed his resilience in doing just that. Having only one hand, Jamie will never again be on the same level as the very greatest in the world, buy will undoubtedly make short work of 90% of the warriors he will face even still. Hell of an accomplishment.

8.Darrio Nahaaris - 
Most of his one on one fights have not exactly been straight-up duels. Despite that, he's definitely shown that he is an elite warrior on some occasions. He cut through a dozen guards in astapoor basically without effort, as well as taking down their champion with one swing of his blade. (2 if you count the dagger he used for the horse). Cocky, but based on all evidence, he can back up the shit he talks

7.Barick Donderrion -
Another warrior who is this high on my list, partially based on opinion/educated guesses. We've seen him hold his own against the hound, but haven't really seen him fighting many battles. His skill is largely based on speculation but based on that one duel, one sure thing is he definitely has some top-tier skills

6.Tormund Giantsbane -
This dude is absolutely ruthless. I struggled with putting him even higher because... well have you watched this guy in a fight? Total savage, unrelenting way of fighting. Survived the battle for castle black, and the battle of the bastards... only his lack of witnessed feats keeps him this low... I'd give tormund a good chance against anybody in the world.

5.Brienne of Tarth - 
When we first see her, it's after she won a tournament composed of 116 of renlys best fighters, including loras tyrell. She (almost) singlehandedly slaughtered 5 or 6 of ramsay Boltons men when she rescued Sansa and then from them. Defeated a ( admittedly hands tied) Jamie lannister. And her greatest accomishment: winning a duel against the hound. Yeah, he was clearly not at full strength, but imo she is still one of only a handful of warriors who could have pulled that off. Even on sandors worst day.

4.Jorah Mormont -
Few are able to slaughter numerous enemies, and look as graceful doing it as Jorah. He states killing a dothraki blood rider as one of his most impressive accomplishments, but imo it's not even in the top 3. What about how he was able to dominate in the fighting pits, against several opponents at once, all while ensuring all his blows were non-lethal? (The first time... 2nd time he was slaughtering mfs) What about the way he sliced through enemies like they were made of paper during the liberation of astapoor? Or when he saved dany from the sons of the harpy? Sheer badassery.

3.Bronn -
Our first glimpse of bronn in action was clearly less than impressive... granted he did win the fight, saving Tyrion from a death sentence, but he hardly looked convincing for most of the duration. But imo, that should be looked at as an argument FOR his greatness, not against. For one He doesn't like to fight for free, which technically to him that fight was for free, and also its my belief that he really had no desire to kill his opponent, nor did he feel any major threat from him. As we've seen countless times since, when he has the incentive ( be it money, rewards, or his own life he's fighting for) bronn has, at least imo, looked essentially flawless in battle. During battles, we see him hacking through several enemies almost effortlessly, as if he knows 100% none of them stand a chance against him. *I will admit, he may be slightly high because he happens to be one of my favorite characters* 

2.Jon Snow -
Normally when you see lists like this, Jon snow is lucky to Crack the top ten. More often he's left out entirely. But I have a couple reasons for that: first, all those lists are ranking all time fighters from both books and t.v., dead and alive, which surely brings him down a few spots... and second, those lists are just wrong. Who on the show has a greater set of feats than Jon Snow? The hound? Maybe... can't think of anyone else. We're the all ingredients a out the man who singlehandedly killed a white walker in single combat, the guy who we've watched rip through countless thenns, wildlings(living and dead), Boltons. .. among what is arguably an entire castle full of above average warriors, at castle black, he was clearly unmatched. At times even when it was 3 on 1 combat. Jon Snow doesn't get the credit he deserves. Dude is a beast.

1. Sandor ""The Hound Clegane"" -
 This guy is just one bad MF. We've seen him. 
 Involved in countless fights over his 5 seasons on the show, and there's only been a handful of times where he has even shown that he was being challenged. Most recently we witnessed his rampage against the rogue former members of  the brotherhood. That fight was 3 on 1 and they never stood a chance. We've seen similar fights at the battle of blackwater,  and the inn vs. Polliver and co. (Granted Arya provided a small assist there) His lone defeat came at the hands of Brienne, who as you can see from my list, I consider to be one of the greatest warriors also. And it's popular opinion that he only lost because of how hungry, dehydrated, and I'll from infection he was. Aside from that one fight ( which was still a brutal, evenly matched, endurance test of a fight, he has essentially dominated. Even when greatly outnumbered. In short, he's the man.

Its a big deal in the books, sure, but the show is quite different. They skipped that detail altogether in Maggy's prophecy despite that being just 1 extra line. The characters are in a pretty different place as well - Jamie, in the books, pretty much despises Cersei by now whereas he still loves her in the show. The other possible candidates - Dany, Sansa, Arya, Tyrion etc. are all in a different place as well.

I've believed for a long time that Jaime is a hero who has been warped and corrupted by the intense hatred he has received as Kingslayer. 

He grew up idolizing Ser Barristan Selmy

He chose to be a man of the kingsgaurd rather then the Lord of Casterly Rock. He valued that honorable life rather than the immense power of his families patriarch.

He told the Mad King not to trust Tywin. Only Varys did the same. 

He killed the King to save the lives in Kings Landing. Before Aerys commanded them burned Jaime showed every sign he would die according to his vows. 

I imagine being judged by Ned, a man he more than likely respected, along with every other person he sought to emulate crushed his spirit. He always wanted to be the White Knight, the romantic hero, and instead he was cursed to be the villain. Only one person, two if you count Tyrion, still showed him love and acceptance: Cersei.

If the world is determined to believe you are evil how long can you hold out before you crumple under those expectations? How far would you go to protect the few people who loved you? Would you kill a child? Would you set them free after they may have killed your biological child, and then forgive them for killing your father?

Cersei is the one Jaime does things he shouldn't for, the one he acts a fool for. And she will probably be the death of him.

He tells the story about the mad king, the pyromancer and the wildfyre. Tyrion tries to convince her to let Jaime take the black but she doesn't want to forgive him. He doesn't back down, reminds her that Cersei was gonna execute him if Jaime didn't save him, goes on about how he betrayed his own family for Dany by letting the Unsullied to Casterly Rock through the sewers, asks this favor in return, threatens to resign as the hand of the queen but Dany doesn't listen.

Let's say at this point, for some reason Dany's jugdement is clouded or she is obsessed with something in an unreasonable way so she is not doing the right thing.

Then Tyrion and Varys help Jaime to escape to the Wall to take the black.

I think it would be super cool to see Tyrion saving Jaime's life and making it up to him for killing Tywin. Then of course we could see Jaime fighting in the north.

Now I dont know what liberties means exactly, but it could mean that Aerys impregnated Joanna Lannister somehow.

I've no idea if this has been asked before.

Apparently Jaime and Cersei grew up sharing a bed and started 'experimenting' when they were quite young. They were caught in the act by their mother's maid, who told their mother. They were ordered never to do it again, but Joanna didn't immediately tell their father Tywin about the matter - she would have done if they'd been caught again.

Jaime was moved to another room and a guard was put outside Cersei's door. I can't imagine Cersei being very happy about this, even though they were only about 8 years old. (book and show ages &amp; dates of birth vary)

Not long afterwards their mother died during childbirth.

Cersei has always vociferously 'blamed' Tyrion for killing his mother because it was his fault it was a difficult birth, but is it possible that Cersei, as young as she was, gave her mother poison so as to be able to continue her liaison with Jaime?

Is it a case of she who shouts loudest bearing the most guilt?

Very similar to her tone of voice when killing Ramsey. 

My theory is that she's saying these words to Littlefinger because she wants Jon to die. Jon is going to fight white walkers; it sounds like some sort of suicide mission north of the wall, possibly suggested by Sansa. 

It appears Sansa thinks of Jon as almost a fool. She didn't trust him at the Battle of Winterfell. And she is jealous of Jon being the King in the North even though he is a bastard. While i doubt Sansa trusts Littlefinger to any degree, she may want to use him and throw Jon under the bus to be put in a higher position of power. Perhaps with marrying Robin Arryn. 



Set photos and trailers allude that Jon and Davos meet Daenaris in Dragonstone, likely before their mission north of the wall. Danny probably wants to marry Jon, but who knows what he thinks of her. Assuming this occurs early in the season, the two must separate for one reason or another. Danny invades Casterly Rock and Jon goes north... perhaps with dragonglass from dragonstone? 

I doubt Jon dies on his mission. Perhaps he almost dies and Benjin saves him and sends him riding south badly injured on a horse. Jon could be the cloaked figure riding a horse in the trailer. That figure appears to have his/her chest very low, likely do to injury. 

Also this battle could occur in defense of Winterfell if Bran destroys the magic of the wall in the same way he ruined the three eyed raven's protection. 



Also calling it, Euron allies with Cersei, kidnaps some Martells, destroys a bunch of Danny's navy, and kills Yara. This would leave Theon to take a position of power, growing in his storyarc as Reek. 


Anyway, what do you think? Do you think Sansa is just going to let Jon be king? What do you think Jon is doing in that snowy battle? Do you think Bran will reach Winterfell before Jon leaves?",10,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

During the Season 7 2nd trailer, when Jon was standing on the ledge and while the others behind him looked like they were struggling to fight the wights.

1. Attempted Child Murder: He pushed Bran out of the window to kill him. 
2. Fucking her sister and cheating over Robert. The king did not know that Cersei's children are bastards.
3. Killed Ned Stark's men and he wanted to kill him too.
4. Killed his own cushion to escape from the prison
5. Stood by Cersei despite all the cruel decisions she made. 
6. Almost raped Cersei near the dead body of their son.
7. He disrespected and insulted Catelyn Stark and Brienne. Surely he does not know how to speak with ladies. Also insulted Jon Snow. Seems that he was too arrogant and looked down upon all others. Always bragged about my father and Lannisters.
8. He was in the Kingsguard when all the Targeyans were killed and raped. Even the children were not spared. He has served them for quite some time so he should have tried to save them.

If I remember then only good thing he did was saving Brienne. So can anybody tell me that how he has turned into a good character? He is still fighting the battle for Cersei.

One of the biggest mysteries in this entire story is the question of what the White Walkers' intentions are.

We know they want to wipe out mankind, but it doesn't seem to only be that, in and of itself. The inclusion of the reveal of how the White Walkers were made in the show is more significant than most think, in my opinion. The fact the Children of the Forest created them isn't only instrumental in understanding *why they exist*, but also to show *why they want to destroy man*.

It should be very apparent, that the WWs themselves are George RR Martin's metaphor for **weapons of mass destruction**. They are Medieval nuclear weapons gone haywire. The COTF made them to fight against man, their bitter enemy. As we know, the WWs, at some point, became too powerful to control, too conscious of their own abilities, and became, essentially, the ""monster than took over the lab"", so to speak.

But the reason they want to destroy the COtF and man doesn't appear to be solely due to a blind thirst for blood. It seems to be motivated by *hate*.

And why hate?

**Because their existence, is a miserable one...**

Becoming a near immortal entity, doomed to live in ice and cold for eternity takes meaning away from their lives. They believe that the circumstances that lead to their creation (war between men and the children) are at fault for their doomed eternal suffering.

But why are they coming back now?

I think it's because they are responding to two things: Jon Snow's birth and the return of dragons. They don't solely want to destroy men and the children...They want to rid the known world of the *magic that created them*.

How do they do that...?

Well, to get an idea of how this is possible, look at the scene in Bran's flashback to when the first White Walker was created...He had a large shard of dragon glass shoved into his chest.

I think the Night King wants the dragon glass shard pulled out of his chest, possibly by Jon Snow.

What would happen if the shard is pulled from his chest?

**He will become human again**. 

They want to die, in peace, as humans, but not before wiping out as many people as they can.

If they want to die, why not just let Jon Snow take the dragon glass shard out of the Night King's chest? Why do they need revenge in the process?

Because they want to demonstrate that they have *not forgotten* what happened to them, all those thousands of years ago.

--------------------------------------------------------

PART II:

BITTERSWEET ENDING:

I believe **at least two** of the three most key figures in this story, who are instrumental to the Walkers' defeat, must die. These three characters are Jon, Bran, and Daenerys.

If Dany does die, it'll be either one of two ways: 1) At the Wall, fighting the Walkers, or 2) In childbirth, giving birth to Jon's child.

Either way, she will not sit on the Iron throne.

If Jon dies again, I think it'll be through one of two ways: 1) Through a blood sacrifice by fire with the Weirwood trees on the Isle of Faces, or 2) He, himself, will have to take on the role of the new Night King, and return with the wights back to the Land of Always Winter, for eternity, as part of, again, a sacrifice via brokered truce.

If Bran dies, I think it'll be through a reveal that *he is* the Night King, and that Jon will have to kill him to end the conflict.

The larger scope of the bittersweet climax for ASOIAF is that many will perish, including several main characters. Westeros will mostly be in ruin, with the survivors left to rebuild from the ashes and begin a new beginning.",10,13,False,spoiler,,,,,

In the trailer, he is seen with what looks like a lance or spear charging rapidly in a field of fire towards something - likely a dragon - full force. One of the factually known dragonslayers is the Burning Knight who slew the dragon Morghul in the Storming of the Dragonpit. It is said, in *The World of Ice and Fire*, that he **rushed headlong into the dragon's with spear in hand, thrusting the point into the dragon's eye repeatedly, even as the flame melted the steel he was encased in and burning his flesh.** (http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Burning_Knight) 

It's possible that Jaime follows suit and casts the final blows to one of Daenerys's wounded dragons earning the title Dragonslayer along Kingslayer. It would finally earn him the acclaim King Joffrey faulted him for not having in the Book of Brothers in Season 4, Episode 1. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBb15PQn-gQ)

Are the showrunners given free reign to the fates of some of the ""lesser"" characters?",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/6jvqlq/everythingwe_know_that_grrm_has_met_with_the/,WhiteWolfofUtah,1498597264,"Like many, I came to the universe from the show. I was a bit late to the party, and didn't start watching the show until about halfway through the airing of Season 6. After I finished it, I decided that I wanted to read the books to further immerse myself in the lore, and now I'm watching the show again to prep for Season 7. In watching the show again, I had forgotten how many smaller differences that there are between the books and the show.

As I put in my title, we know that the showrunners have met with GRRM multiple times about how he plans on ending the show, and the fates of the major characters. But with the smaller, more minor characters are the showrunners essentially given free reign? For example, Myrcella was killed in Season 5, when in the books she was scarred but left alive (implying that she wasn't going to die, but I could be wrong). Sansa ended up with Ramsay instead of Jeyne, Dondarrion gave his life in order to revive Catelyn, the list goes on.

The reason that I ask is that it would just be a shame for the showrunners to decide to take one route for these lesser characters when GRRM had a better plan for them. I'm not saying things one way or the other, I think that there are things he's done better, and things that the show has done better. It was just something I was thinking about as I'm watching through the show again. ",4,7,False,spoiler,,,,,

I have no doubt that the surprises will continue but we're down to the final seasons and books so there are only a certain number of things that could happen at this point.

The idea of not knowing which (or none of them being right,) is something I can get behind, but at this point multiple religions have been shown doing fantastical and other worldly things because of their religious followings. The followers of the many faced god do some clearly incredibly magical and other worldly stuff like the faces and turning Arya blind for not following the rules of the religion, but then someone like the red woman comes along and by making sacrifices to a god (not the many faced god) and can do stuff like seeing the future (which we know is accurate because of the part in the TV show where she knows she saw Jon in the fire.) so I'm just really confused about which religion is right, or for a more exact summary of the question, how are multiple of them right when they all contradict each other in beliefs and restrictions so much?",5,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

Dannys invasion route will be from the West, even though she will have her seat in Dragonstone, the bulk of her army will attack from the West. 

The Greyjoy(+Dornish) battle in the high seas will probably be the first battle we will see. The Unsullied will then capture Casterly Rock following Tyrions plan, but I dont think that the castle will be well manned. The bulk of the Lannister army lead by Jaime will be in the Reach. They will take Highgarden, but this victory will be short. I think the main battle we see in the trailers will happen in the Reach. This is where the Lannister army will be defeated by Danny/Drogo and her Dothraki warriors. I do not know what will happen to Jaime though; I think the most likely scenario will be that hell be captured but I think this battle will happen towards the end of Season 7.

The North, these two regions plus King's landing and Dragonstone will be the main focus this season and I think the other regions of Westeros will be mostly irrelevant. 

I think by the time that Jon reaches Dragonstone, Danny will have everything she needs to take King's Landing.",5,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

Had a lot of time on my hands so I decided to watch this show, which has been recommended to me countless times. Here are my thoughts

- God damn. Hands down, best show I've ever watched. Plot. Action. Everything. Can't wait for S7
- The way this show can make me hate a character at one moment and love them the next is crazy
- Saddest moment for me was the Red Wedding. I loved Robb's cause and loved him as a character. Hearing him being called the ""Young Wolf"" and being described in battle gave me chills every time
- Another sad moment was when Aemon was calling Aegon ""Egg"" on his death bed and looking for him. Got a sad vibe as if he was an older brother looking for his pure, wonderful little brother before he became King and turned evil and all that. Not sure if that's what it actually was, but that's what it seemed like to me. I'm not quite sure how exactly that went down
-  Arya Stark is a badass of the highest degree
- Cersei Lannister gives so little fucks that she gives negative fucks. I think we owe her fucks to give. Blowing up the sept with all the people in it was one of the craziest things I've seen
- They did such a good job at revealing the whole storyline with Ned and Lyanna Stark and Jon's true lineage. That cut from the baby to Jon's face in front of the Northern Lords was awesome
- I'm glad Ramsey got the death he deserved. Would have liked it to be a little more painful, though

Tormund's POV:
I was in me Ruddy Hall, with only a cask o mead to keep me company and nothing to do but drink it. The more I drank, the more I got thinking about this woman lived close by, a fine strong woman with the biggest pair of teats you ever saw. She had a temper on her that one, but oh, she could we warm too, and in the deep of winter a man needs his warmth.

The more I drank, the more I thought about her, and the more I thought the harder me member got, till I couldnt suffer it no more. Fool that I was I bundled meself up in furs from head to heels, wrapped a winding wool aroud me face, and set off to find her. The snow was coming down so hard I got turned around once or twice, and the wind blew right through me and froze me bones, but finally I come on her, all bundled up like I was.

The woman had a terrible temper, and she put up quite the fight when I laid hands on her. It was all I could do to carry her home and get her out o them furs, but when I did, oh, she was hotter than even I remembered, and we had a fine old time, and then I went to sleep. Next morning when I woke the snow had stopped and the sun was shining, but I was in no fit state to enjoy it. All ripped and torn I was, and had me member bit right off, and there on me floor was a she-bears pelt. And soon enough the free folk were telling tales of this bald bear seen in the woods, with the queerest pair o cubs behind her. Har! He slapped his meaty thigh. Would that I could find her again.

Ellaria - Keeps saying that Oberyn was murdered when he volunteered to fight AND would have won if he would have just finished the mountain off.  Kills the only sane person in Dorne just because she's sad.

The Waif - needlessly vindictive toward Arya and always has that smug look on her face.  Just a flat, annoying character.

**The Targaryen Invasion** --Daenerys and her allies sail for Westeros. They likely land first at Dragonstone, seemingly abandoned by Baratheon forces. However, we get a glimpse of Melisandre standing somewhere on the battlements. If so, Daenerys will likely receive intelligence of Jon Snow and the White Walkers from Melisandre. Daenerys will ask for advice from Tyrion who vouches for Jon Snow's honor, having come to know him well at Castle Black. Knowing that the North could prove a strong ally in the war for the Iron Throne, perhaps Daenerys sends ravens to Winterfell and requests an audience with the new King in the North.

**Winterfell and the Wall** --We see Bran and Meera outside of the Wall. This likely means that Dolorous Edd, serving as steward of the Night's Watch, takes the children in and sends a raven to Winterfell. Sansa, upon learning that her brother is still alive, sends Brienne and Pod to escort Bran back home. At Winterfell, Bran seems to take residence as a kind of Doran 2.0 but with greenseeing abilities. At some point, Bran and Meera must have a conversation about Howland Reed's role in the combat at the Tower of Joy. Hopefully, we get to see Meera travel to Greywater Watch and maybe Howland will come forth to confirm Bran's claims concerning Jon's parentage. Littlefinger tries to sink his fangs deeper into the politics of the North, attempting to manipulate Sansa and telling Jon stories he doesn't seem to want to hear.

**The Riverlands** --Arya has scratched a name off her list and travels throughout the Riverlands, most likely towards Winterfell. One hopes she encounters an old friend deep in the woods.

**The Iron Throne** --Queen Cersei names Jaime the Lord of Casterly Rock. Cersei allies herself with Euron Greyjoy against the Targaryen threats. 

**Wars in the South** --Tyrion, Grey Worm, and the Unsullied sack Casterly Rock through the drains and cisterns before Jaime can arrive. Or perhaps, they come upon the Lannister forces at unawares and take Jaime prisoner. The Dothraki and at least one dragon begin a siege against Lannister troops at what appears to be the fields outside of King's Landing. The dragon(s) lay waste to the battlefield, decimate the Lannister forces, and cause Jaime to ride out alone against some unseen enemy.

**Wars at Sea** --Yara and Theon lead a naval battle against Euron and seemingly suffer Daenerys's first military defeat.

**Wars in the North** --Somehow Jon crosses paths with Sam, Sandor Clegane, and the Brotherhood Without Banners. We see them, along with Tormund and probably Benjen, fighting wights and White Walkers north of the Wall. ",17,11,False,spoiler,,,,,

The game is simple: 

- You have 20 points available to you and can select up to 10 characters (minimum of 5) from the below list

- Each character has a point value designation, which signifies how many points it costs to have them in your deadpool

- You must spend ***all*** of your allotted 20 points

- If a given character on your deadpool is dead at the end of the season, you get the points you spent on them back

- If a given character on your deadpool is alive at the end of the season, you lose the points you spent on them

- In theory, the best score at the end of the season is 20 points, and the worst score is 0 points. 

- If there's significant interest, I will post the results at the end of the season, featuring a special call out to our 1st place winners.

- Please submit your responses [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1j71Ryck7t8jhdrQthXIPOI3zBXcGsbYZGBGXrF1hQ2s/viewform?edit_requested=true) https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1j71Ryck7t8jhdrQthXIPOI3zBXcGsbYZGBGXrF1hQ2s/viewform?edit_requested=true

What I am really wondering is; what is up with that Giant Weirwood tree and by extension all the stone pillars surrounding it. Is that some sort of holy ground? Why were the WWs congregating there? Is that the ""heart of winter""?
What is the significance of that location other than the origin? Is it a power source ?  Are the WW's guarding it?

We still don't understand the motivation of the WW's or the night king. He's vengeful, but towards who and why? Watching the origin scene carefully, it didn't appear that he volunteered to become the children of the forest's ""weapon"". So they capture him and for some reason thought they could maintain control.
i'd love to hear speculation on: at what point and how did he go rogue? and what is he doing with all of Craster's babies? Is he looking / waiting for a specific baby?",17,7,False,spoiler,,,,,

So my question is: given Arya's newly acquired skills, how threatening is she at this point going into Season 7? Which people do you think she could beat in a fair fight? Could she beat Podrick?

I'm also wondering how her water dancing is coming along. Do you think she'll ever get to the point where she's as good as her former teacher, Syrio?

Don't read if you don't watch the trailers.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/6k4dbe/main_spoilers_thought_of_a_super_dark_and/,jakeyeah111,1498691202," So I stated a couple times around here, Tyrion is my favorite but I wouldnt be surprised if he died in S7 at all. Past his knowledge of Casterly Rock, he doesn't really serve a big purpose in the big game. I don't think S8 would be much different if he was alive or not. 

So i think Jon will get to Dany and the gang in s4, and let her know of the white walker threat. The episode ends with Dany attacking the Lannister army (like we see in the trailer,) and both armies are hit hard. Dany captures Jaime (when we see him charging in the trailer,) and both armies are hit so hard that they step back to regroup. 

In episode 5, Jaime, Tyrion and Jon talk and they sway Jaime to let Tyrion, Varys, and The Hound to go talk to Cersei and attempt to get her to aim her focus at the white walkers, if Dany agrees to do the same. Jaime gets ahold of Cersei and tells her if she tries to pull any tricks, he will kick her off the crown and take the army himself. 

In episode 6, they are pleading their case when Cersei tells the mountain she wants Tyrion, Varys and The Hound killed. The mountain smashes Varys's head and impales Tyrion, killing him. The Hound has a second to react and CLEGANEBOWL. During this, Jaime is fueled with rage over his dead brother but can't bring himself to stab Cersei because it's too gruesome, but he finds the strength to choke her to death with his gold hand. The Hound wins cleganebowl. 

In episode 7, Jaime names Dany queen, because he came to trust her and knows she wants to help Westeros, and isn't anything like her father, plus he doesn't want the crown. He bends the knee and takes over the Lannister army. 

This would kill Cersei and name Dany queen, and set us up for the inevitable Humans Vs White Walkers in season 8. It's also pretty unpredictable too, and not just a Dany vs Cersei battle where Dany wins and takes the crown. D&amp;D and GRRM know how to kill our hearts, and this would truly be the darkest part of the show. Tyrion dying in season 7 would be worst than Ned, Hold the Door and The Red Wedding. It would surely be an unpredictable, depressing and shocking twist, meanwhile would set up season 8 nicely.

So I'm re-watching BOTB and I happened to come across something which I am wondering if it's a mistake on the show. In S6 E9, when Jon and co. meet up with Ramsay in the open field, Sansa looks at Ramsay and tells him he will die the next day and to sleep well. Shortly after, [Ramsay mentions his dogs are hungry and that he hasn't fed them for 7 days.](http://i.imgur.com/4pEfxRw.png).

Sansa was not present to hear this.

At the end of the episode, Ramsay says his dogs are loyal and would not harm him but [Sansa replies, saying he said it himself that he hadn't fed them for 7 days.](http://i.imgur.com/svS7z6a.png). My question is when did she get to know about this? Would it be likely if Jon mentioned it to her at all during the night before the battle? It seems highly unlikely that it would be the case so I'm wondering if I missed anything or is it a plothole / show inconsistency.

Thank you.",11,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

I am re-watching S6 and I am at the scene where Bran is with sleeping 3-eyed Raven. The 3-eyed Raven had been showing him scenes from the past by using the big tree. As 3-eyed R sleeps, Bran uses the tree to project into what he probably assumes is the past, just how the 3-eyed Raven was showing him scenes of a younger Ned, however, I theorize (or maybe it is obvious) that it is actually the present, and not the past. I believe, that in the present the Ice King is able to sense when wargs are looking through this weird tree thing that allows you project yourself, but only if they are looking at current events. This might also be why Bran is able to have an impact, but not as big, when he is looking at the past. For example, he calls out to young Ned, and Ned turns around. Another famous example, is Hodor, and how we sent Hodor a message through space and time ""hold the door"". This is not him actually being visible to them, but his voice somehow traveling back to those moments. 

Okay, now back to the Ice King and the scene where Bran is seen by him and is touched by him. At the start Bran only sees the wights and is walking through them, but they do not notice him. When he gets to the Ice King, he is looking away, but finally the King turns and looks at Bran and right after that all the wights start to notice Bran too and turn to face him. This leads me to believe the Ice King is warging them.

Hold your horses, another important scene to note was featured in the S7 trailers. There is a point where Ravens are flying over a snowy landscape and below them are wights. Soon thereafter they show a shot of the Ravens (Bran) being noticed by the Wight King. This is a bit more speculative, Bran may or may not be actually warging into some Ravens and flying way the heck up north, but I am speculating he somehow uses the Weirwood tree in Winterfell to project himself up north, catching the attention of the wight king. Having the tree in Winterfell will allow Bran to keep projecting himself like the 3-eyed Raven was doing from the big tree: having this power would be huge to keep track of where the Ice King is leading his army. Where do the Ravens come in? I think instead of projecting himself as Bran, he will project himself as Ravens, maybe even a 3-eyed one, fully taking on his new role and identity, and also allowing him to not be touched by the Ice King. 

Why is this important and how would it make sense? Think about this, Independence Day. Or rather, any alien movie. When you kill the mothership AKA ""Ice King"" then all the little drones also go down. I suspect a major plot point will be them trying to take out the Ice King, and avoiding fighting the massive walking dead army. 

Also, by extension, if he is able to warg into dead bodies, then he could easily do that if any of the 3 living dragons die in battle.

This has been brewing in my head for a while, and I have not read many people getting this far in their speculation, so I wanted to put it out there, apologies if someone has made this connection before.  ",7,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

Although I feel like I know what would be a great ending for her character. So she's been on this vengeful path ever since she was ressurected and I think it would be a nice conclusion to have her die again but this time in peace. Maybe she finds out that Arya, Sansa, Bran and Rickon are still alive and it brings her peace right before she dies. I was thinking she should also encounter one of them, maybe Arya. Seeing her daughter alive would bring her a joy she hasn't had since before her death. I also think Arya would be well suited since she's already seen some fantastical things. Someone like Sansa hasn't seen any sort of magic so it might be harder for it to work well without her just freaking out the whole time, although Arya would still be freaked out for a little bit at least.

Then when they attack the cave, you see the same three WW with him, two without a beard and one with a beard. Meera kills the one with the beard in the cave. 

Now here is the strange thing. The WW that Jon killed in at Hardhome looks a lot like the one that Meera killed in the cave. In the Trailer of Season 7, when you see the NK looking at the ravens, you see two horses behind him. If you stop the frame you will see another horse to the right. Also the WW that Jon is fighting looks a lot like the one(s) he and Meera killed. 

I am sure there is a reason why there are always three other WWs with him. I am wondering is the NK also able to revive any WWs that are killed? Or can he turn others into a specific WW of his choosing?

We know they are INCREDIBLY valuable.  We know that they can kill White Walkers.  How can they?  Is it the ""Magic""?  Is it the Dragon Fire?  Who knows.

The only time we see/hear of a sword being forged is when Tywin, melts down Ice and reforges to make Widows Wail and Oathkeeper.

Now with him....reforging this steel....could it have potentially lost its ""magic"" that makes these things so valuable?  Or when Tywin tries to like dye them Lannister Red, and the steel rejects the dye.

So in the first season Varys is working with Illario right?  Iliario gives dragon eggs to Dany,  I assumed it was something Varys was in on,  but then of course,  Jorah the Andal is given a royal pardon* (more on that in a moment) because he gave them info on Dany being preggers and spying on her in general,  but it seems Varys went ahead with Robert's plan to kill Dany, yet Jorah still stopped it. But as any current viewer knows Varys has been working in favor of Dany in recent seasons.  So my question to book readers and show viewer's is this:

When did Varys really form allegiance to the Targs when he aided in a plot to kill Dany in the first season?  Why-was it just because working for the Lannisters was a dead end gig? I know Varys insinuates wanting the throne for himself in the show at one point,  but that's not entirely possible in Westoros without a family line or cute marketing,  like Littlefinger's sweet mockingbird sigil. 

*Jorah's pardon is legit in season 1 I thought, but he switches alliance to Dany and Drogo before she can be killed.  So in season 4 when Jorah is forced to resign  from Dany's administration,  it's after Sir Barristin Selmy receives a pardon from Tywin Lannister as Hand of the King,  right?  Just a sneaky dick move on Tywin's part to stir up shit?",24,6,False,spoiler,,,,,

Stannis was so much fun to watch, struggle with what was right and wrong, his place in this world, what he is owed and what was his duty.   Stannis, maybe more so than any other character was often Right for the Wrong Reasons, or Wrong for the Right Reasons... and that was interesting.

The upshot, they say, is that the two can coexist. Certain things that we learned from George way back then are going to happen on the show, but certain things wont, says Benioff.

We first see him in Harrenhal the only survivor of the slaughter of some North men by the Gregor Clegane's forces. I think this was simply to get access specifically to Roose Bolton to discuss their future allegience.

Maybe its true or maybe its not, but I just thought there's a few reasons it may work as a theory:  

* Qyburn is the only survivor, he is able to infiltrate the Northern forces with ease because they think he is on their side. He is the only survivor coincidentally, this may be so no one can say he is on the Lannister side. The deal is something you wouldn't trust a raven with, it'd have to be very secretive as the entire war hinged upon its success so this is why an infiltration like this was carried out.
* The wound he at Harrenhal received wasn't fatal, he would have know this as he has medical expertise  
* Tywin may have also wanted him to help Jaime as he knew he was near and if the Northerners caught him again he'd be able to free him and/or take care of him medically
* Soon after this time Roose returns to the Dreadfort with him. Then Qyburn very quickly finds his way into the service of the Lannisters again
* He seems especially good at communicating with individuals and convincing them to a certain degree, could have been the reason he was chosen. Also has good communication skills with high born individuals and has a level of status a (former) maester. Tywin may agree with his ethics that sometimes the ends justify the means, they seem similar in that regard and so may have found favour with Tywin (then also ultimately Cersei who is somewhat like her father)

It doesn't seem like he is hiding behind that mask to cover for his own ambition and greed - those things genuinely do seem like his only concern. Given this, how would he have regarded Dany's potential claim to the throne? 

Suppose, for example, they'd had a Great Council in the middle of the War of Five Kings and Dany had chosen that time to make the claim. Renly and Joffrey would, ofcourse, make a claim for the Iron Throne. Robb would've made the claim for an independent North and Trident and Balon would've claimed independent Iron Islands as well as parts of the North he'd managed to conquer. In this clusterfuck of claims deriving from different political philosophies, would Stannis have still insisted on his own claim? Or would he have stayed true to his principles and put his support behind Dany?


Before someone yells ""Right of Conquest"" again, let's clear something up - Stannis does not seem to believe that that gives someone the right to rule. If Stannis acknowledges right of conquest and that Robert had the right to rule because of it, he'd have to acknowledge certain other uncomfortable facts as well. Such as, if Renly wins because of his bigger army, he would be the rightful ruler. Since Robb ""won"" the North and the Riverlands and Balon ""won"" the Iron Islands and parts of the North, they would be the rightful rulers of those areas. Moreover, since Stannis lost to Joffrey, it'd mean that Joffrey is the rightful ruler despite being a bastard. But Stannis continues to regard them as usurpers and thieves until the very end. Clearly, he doesn't believe that being able to conquer gives one the right to rule. 


He'd be similarly dismissive of popular acclaim as the source. Robb was acclaimed by his bannermen as was Renly by the Stormlanders - that didn't make them legitimate rulers in Stannis' eyes. 


Clearly, for Stannis, right by blood and/or duty are the only legitimate way for someone to become a king. He could rationalize deposing Aerys because of Aerys' failure to do his duty as the king and he could rationalize supporting Robert because of their Targaryen heritage. In his eyes, Dany should have the most valid claim - a dutiful monarch with a blood-right to the throne. Is there any reason why someone as committed to law and duty as Stannis would oppose her claim?",41,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

Based on my reading, Stark is supposed to be very powerful, but our Stark spent most of the war fighting off a Greyjoy invasion, and with very few areas to naturally expand to. The Eeyrie is heavily defended, and fighting off both Greyjoy and Baratheon at sea seems like a nightmare.

One of the major things that has happened in the show is the supposed ""death of Stannis"". This show thrives on graphic and intensely violent death scenes. Yet this death, they show Brienne looking down at the camera and then she swings downward and cut scene. I've always felt that there's a HUGE possibility that Stannis is alive because of this reason. I've just never been able to come up with a valid reason why Brienne wouldn't have followed through. Until now.

I'm rewatching the episodes before the new season airs and am currently at S2E5. In this scene, Brienne pledges to follow Catelyn. She tells Catelyn ""I could serve you if you would have me. You have courage. Not battle courage, perhaps, but, I don't know, a woman's kind of courage. And I think that when the time comes, you will not hold me back. Promise me that you will not hold me back from Stannis."" Catelyn replies ""When the time comes, I will not hold you back.""

What if Lady Stoneheart is in the North and stops Brienne from landing her blow at the last second. Maybe because she made the promise as Catelyn Stark and now Catelyn is dead? Maybe because she has bigger plans for Stannis? Unless they decide to leave her out of the show (which is entirely possible), she has to come back at some point. At least this entrance would explain the lack of a death scene for Stannis.

We see how the Night King (if that was the Night King) is created by the CotF.  We don't see how the CotF control the Night King, or even if they can.  Perhaps they created him out of Bran after he traveled and got stuck in the past, and they could only control him for a period of time.  Or he spiraled out of control and now wants revenge on the CotF, because he makes they symbol of the CotF with bodies.

It could be that Night King Bran broke free from the CotF and knows from his pre-time travel what will happen.  His forays into the South pre-wall were to try to kill the CotF so that they could not send Bran back to become him.  Now I say pre-wall, because Martin has said that the Night's King is a legendary figure, and it could be just as likely that the wall was built to protect against the Night King, and the process of making the Night King was what created the long winters, white walkers, and wights.

Night King Bran creates wights and white walkers as a means to a good end. He knows that if he succeeds in either killing the CotF that sent Bran back or kills himself as Bran before he is sent back none of the evil he has done will have ever happened, and on top of that the long winters will never happen.

Now some will point to Dany's vision of snow on the Iron Throne, but that could mean Jon Snow or even Sansa as representative of ""ice"" vs dany's ""fire"" being on the throne.

Another thing I just thought of: perhaps Bran warged into a random or ancestor first man in the past and got stuck there.  His identity slowly dies in the first man, which allows the CotF to control the Night King.  Putting his mark on Bran allows the Night King to remember who he is as Bran.

The CotF help Bran because perhaps a human greenseer is needed to create the Night King, and there was none in the past.  They know the Night King kills humans, so they give him refuge until Bran can go into the past, which through their green-seeing they know will happen.

Just some tinfoil, don't really believe it so feel free to shoot it down.

[the scene](https://youtu.be/9uliijux-Sw)

Sansa listens intently to the three men talking. She takes note when Davos says that it is ""crucial"" that they wait for Ramsay to advance on them, that they need to have patience. She looks at Jon when he tells Tormund that he only challenged Ramsay to a one-on-on ""to make him angry."" Sansa knows Ramsay isn't going to fall for that. She knows their plan won't work because Jon is underestimating Ramsay. She tells Jon exactly that but he doesn't get it. She tries to explain that Ramsay doesn't fall for traps, he sets traps. Jon blows her off. 

It make so much sense to me now that she wouldn't tell him about TKOTV. She knows that Jon doesn't have enough men, patience, or understanding of his opponent. She knows he can't win like this but he sees no other option. TKOTV aren't numerous enough to turn the tide against Ramsay's army, but they are more than enough to save Jon's army when they get trapped, which Sansa knows they will. 

She might feel badly afterwards that she didn't tell Jon, but it's a damn good thing she didn't. I don't think it would have changed Jon's plan much, especially because you never REALLY know if you can trust Littlefinger. Would Jon have changed the entire plan because TKOTV are maybe coming? Nah. Sansa knew they were more valuable held in reserve to swoop in when Jon inevitably leads his army into Ramsay's trap.  ",231,148,False,spoiler,,,,,

But Catelyn Stark and Cersei Lannister have so much in common.

-Catelyn's irrational hatred of Jon Snow vs. Cersei's irrational hatred of Tyrion. Both view them as unnatural, and a stain on their families. Imagine if Robb and Jon had never gotten along, and then one day Robb was poisoned and Jon had been the one to hand him the cup - how do you think Catelyn would have reacted?

-Both would do anything for their children. In fact, that might be Cersei's only redeeming quality.

-Compare Catelyn's dead emotionless stare shortly before she is killed, to Cersei's dead emotionless stare as she takes the throne. In both cases, they have finally lost all of their children (or at least Catelyn thinks she has.)

-They both suffer from the same fatal flaw - they are not as smart as they think they are. They both make foolish and misguided decisions that seem justified from their distorted perspectives, but ultimately make things worse.

-They both provide advice and morale support to their sons after they become Kings (this especially applies to the books, where Robb and Joffrey are both children.)

Catelyn is more grounded, modest, and compassionate, while Cersei is more ruthless, ambitious, and egotistical, but when it comes to family they are basically the same.",4,13,False,spoiler,,,,,

After the events of last season, specifically R+L=J, it really made me realize how theories are, in a sense, spoiling the show (GRRM has even said that one of the fan theories has correctly predicted the end of the show). I'd like to think of how surprised I would have been last season if I had not heard about R+L=J beforehand, and it may have made it more enjoyable to all unfold too. Sure it was still a theory and not confirmed, but the evidence was strong enough that I had no reason to doubt it. 

I love reading theories and engaging in the discussions, but I also love watching the show the way it's meant to be watched without any ideas implanted in my head beforehand.

We know the episodes will only premiere once. Do you choose to engage in these once-in-a-lifetime opportunities to talk about episode discussions/theories after they air, or do you choose to just refrain from reading the theories and watch it how the showrunners intended, without any preassumptions but your own?

The reason I ask is because I'm quite stuck on how to approach Season 7. The live aspect of the show and the weekly episodes are something that I feel are incredibly special. I know that years from now when the show is complete, there will be no theorizing, no discussions, and no predictions since it'll all be over, so in a way I do feel it's important to take advantage of that opportunity now before it's gone.

Anyone care to share their feelings and experiences with this?",13,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

These people seem to forget 2 things here A) Jon did have a sound strategy that could've won him the battle with minimal casualties had he followed the plan and B) Those casualties were the result of his recklessness - not the presence or the lack of a decent battle plan.

What do you think would've happened had Jon known about the KotV? How would he have acted differently? Let's take a look.

**Objective** - Yes, the goal here is to defeat the Boltons and retake Winterfell, but how are they to manage it? The simple answer here is that they had to draw Ramsay out and destroy him in the field. No matter how many men Jon had, they simply could not let Ramsay retreat back into the castle. The importance of this method cannot be stressed enough - Ramsay HAD to be drawn out. A lengthy siege is not in their favor since they are strapped for resources, Winter is practically here and Ramsay would no doubt be well-provisioned within Winterfell. Not to mention, one man on the walls is worth 50 under it. Any victory would come at a HUGE cost if they do not avoid this scenario. Knights or no knights, this is what they had to do.

**Setup** - Jon set things up as best he could here. If Ramsay thought that Jon had the numerical advantage, he would be unlikely to risk open battle. Much better to let him think that he held the numbers. It happened to be true, but the same would hold even if Jon knew about the KotV. It's much better to keep that army hidden and out of Ramsay's sight until the opportune moment. Jon did the right thing by goading Ramsay, hoping it'd make him angry enough to charge. It wasn't enough, but it was the best he could do. He also prepared necessary defenses for his position like spikes in the ground to prevent getting flanked. Having the KotV here would've made no difference to his preparations.

**Battle Plan** - As said before, Jon's goal here is to draw Ramsay's entire army out and destroy them in the field. Ramsay being angry isn't enough to ensure that. Jon has to lure him in with the illusion that he was winning. The current battle plan relied on them letting Ramsay buckle their center and then, as soon as he commits all his forces to the attack, surround him and destroy him. And that was a good plan. The success was not guaranteed because of the disparity of numbers, but he still had a good chance of victory here.

If Jon had known about the KotV, his plan would've changed, but not significantly. Revealing a trump card like having some 10,000 extra men than your enemy expects would be stupid here. So ofcourse, Jon would keep them hidden. Using them for the element of surprise would be the obvious choice, but how and when he should spring that surprise is the question here. If he does it too soon, Ramsay would still have the chance to retreat back to Winterfell - something they are trying to avoid.

Jon would still deploy his Wildling+Northern army in the same formation as he did. He'd still stay out of the range of Ramsay's arrows and hope that Ramsay charges at them. And he'd still have a plan to draw Ramsay out - perhaps something involving charging with cavalry and then retreating, apparently defeated, and goading Ramsay to give chase.

The significant difference here would be that he'd have the hidden Vale army waiting in the wings. He'd probably hide them over the hill or in the woods, where Ramsay's scouts cannot spot them. Ofcourse, Jon wouldn't expect the whole of Ramsay's army to charge at once - he'd first deal with a Cavalry charge, raining arrows to cut down many of them, but the cavalry would reach Jon's forces and seemingly break through. Hopefully, seeing Jon's forces in disarray at this point, Ramsay would commit both his heavy and light infantry to the attack. If he doesn't, Jon's forces would recover and start surrounding Ramsay's forces, which would then prompt him to send in reinforcements. Only after Ramsay has sent his whole troops into the field that the KotV would reveal themselves and make a clean sweep of Ramsay's forces. In this plan Jon wins with minimum casualties on his side.

**The Battle** - This is where it all goes wrong. Instead of letting Ramsay advance his army, Jon charges forward to save Rickon, leaving his men without a commander. This brings Jon within the range of the Bolton archers. The men cannot leave their commander to die, so the infantry and the cavalry charge forward as well, bringing the bulk of Jon's army within the range of the archers - something Ramsay exploits mercilessly. Unlike him, however, Davos wouldn't rain arrows on his own men.

This is likely to happen regardless of whether Sansa tells Jon about the Knights. But the Knights have a choice here, since they have Lord Royce as the commander. They could follow Jon's army in the suicidal charge or they can stay hidden, still hoping for a semblance of plan to be reformed.

If the Knights rush forward with the rest of Jon's cavalry, they face a similar outcome. They'd clash with Bolton Cavalry mid-field. They'd face arrows raining down upon them. And thousands of them would die - just like the Wildlings. You'd still have that mountain of corpses. Its possible, however, that they can push through with sheer numbers. In which case, they'd still have to face the Bolton heavy infantry. If they manage to break through, Ramsay still has the option to retreat back into Winterfell with the rest of his infantry and hold out for a long siege. If they manage to somehow prevent that, it'd still end up being a battle of attrition with heavy casualties on both sides. Meaning, about the same number of Wildlings would still die and you'd have heavy losses for Vale forces as well. And that's the best case scenario. The worst case - the Vale forces get brought down by Bolton Cavalry and arrows, get trapped within the phalanx and the mountain of corpses and get defeated.

But suppose they play it smart and stay hidden. The battle proceeds as it did - with a whole lot of Wildlings dying. Ramsay commits his infantry to surround the survivors. The Vale forces use this opportunity to reveal themselves and cut the Boltons down - pretty much what happened already. Which means about the same number of deaths.

**Conclusion** - The massive number of Wildling casualties was because Jon couldn't stick to the battle-plan, not because Sansa kept the KotV a secret from him. Even if he'd known, he still would've abandoned whatever alternate plan he had in a futile attempt to save Rickon, which means about the same number of people would've died even in the best case scenario. The worst case scenario, ofcourse, would've been that they lose with no relief coming to save the day.

Although, not technically a prince, I think most people take the word ""prince"" too literally. Anyone male can become a prince, if 1. He marries a princess, 2. Is adopted by a king or queen 3.is elected by the people. Amongst others. Besides that, Mance Rayder was seemingly a King of the Wildlings, and his boy was named ""wildling prince"", ""the little prince"" and ""born-in-battle"" by the men of Stannis and the Night's Watch, and Gilly names the child Aemon Steelsong. Part of the prophecy states that: ""his will be the SONG of Ice and Fire."" It's interesting that there are no other characters with the name song.
As for the prophecy, it seems most people look to Jon, Dany, Aegon, or some other high born, super popular character, but it would make more sense if the prophesied one to achieve peace, is just some low born that no one suspects; making a statement that lineage &amp; birthright really doesn't matter.
The whole bit about being born under the bleeding red star and amidst salt &amp; smoke can pretty much be interpreted as anyone bleeding under any star, anyone crying (salt) &amp; anything burning (smoke).
I think it's significant that in the books Jon swaps the child with Craster's boy to save it. Seems like the child is definitely important, and so much so that he is a pretty strong focus to Sam's plot.
A big theme of ASOIAF is peace. We know that GRRM is an anti-war, peace proliferator, so it makes sense that PWWP would be a wildling to unite the wildlings and the Westerosi. Getting back to the idea that the Night's Watch had been giving babies to the White Walkers &amp; Craster as well...Could it be possible that the WWs have been searching for the child, possibly knowing that it would come from the north? Have the WWs been expecting the child &amp; because of Sam's interference, lost the opportunity? It would certainly explain why the WWs have been demanding children for all those years.

Bran is told that he will never walk again, but he will fly. I've seen lots of commentators noting that the wargy raven in the latest trailer is probably Bran, and this therefore fulfills the statement from the 3ER about flying.
Except it doesn't really, as we have already seen Bran walking a few times in his green visions (Tower of Joy, when he meets the NK). In the books he frequently wargs into Summer and walks too.

I don't even think it can mean flying in the present time and body (e.g. on the back of a dragon), because Bran has been carried by a walking Hodor loads and even had a special saddle designed by Tyrion so he could ride a horse.

So what could he do that would be deemed flying but not walking? Take a trip out of the moon door??",19,7,False,spoiler,,,,,
