I read the article where GRRM gave his inspiration for the novel, and I thought How can thinking about a boy seeing a beheading and finding wolves give you the whole idea for this revolutionary Story that makes you drop everything you are doing to write it? That idea just seems pretty simple....Unless when he though of it the ending came to him too. I mean when you write a story you think of the end based on the beginning and write everything in between. So point is he thought of a boy seeing a beheading and finding wolves. Maybe it hit him like, ok he can warg into his wolf and oh yeah he can go back in time and warg into the NK and the only way to save humanity is they need to kill current Bran in order to stop everything. Maybe they need to behead bran with Ned Starks Sword (that I think is LightBringer) in order to stop everything. Or you have to behead the night Kind himself.

# Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things

Welcome to the latest entry in the list of Andreas favorites.   It doesnt look like anybody even saw last weeks entry. Not even the AutoModerator commented. It is very disappointing, but, I dont this for the fame or the glory. I do this because, its fun! But, if you just missed last weeks entry, you can check it out at this link: [https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/9ilpbc/spoilerslostlink\_presents\_andreas\_favorites\_as\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/9ilpbc/spoilerslostlink_presents_andreas_favorites_as_of/).  But for now, lets get on with this weeks list. We have two new comers to the list, expanding the number of ranked characters to 19 after just four episodes. You can see how this can be pretty confusing to someone who hasnt read the books.

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Jon Snow (Last week 4)**

Jon Snow has risen six spots in two weeks to land the number one spot on the list. He has done this by showing he has some really good character. He protected Sam from other recruits. Then he showed that he is going to be good leader by convincing the other recruits that they should treat Sam as their brother. He has the right stuff to be Andreas favorite character so far.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Daenerys Targaryen (Last week 1)**

Daenerys may have slipped from the number one spot, but she is still holding on strong.  She sees how the world works and understands that her weak and ineffectual brother will never be the King of Westeros.  She stood her ground when he attacked her. She doesnt need her brother to be strong. All these traits keep her near the top of the list.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Dire Wolves (Last week 10)**

The dire wolves made their return to the screen this week. When they get screen time, they improve their ranking. Im not sure if it was Summer showing loyalty by the side of Bran, of if it was Ghost threatening Rast at the wall. Maybe it was both. Either way, the Dire Wolves jumped seven spots to number three this week.

&amp;#x200B;

**4. Ned Stark (Last week 2)**

Ned falls two places this week. Perhaps losing the argument about the tournament and having it despite not being able to afford it cost him some favor in Andreas eyes.  She still thinks he has a good character, and that he is a decent person.  After all, he is giving up some of his own men to the city watch to help strengthen them.

&amp;#x200B;

**5. Arya Stark (Last week 3)**

Also falling two spots this week is Arya Stark. Not much happened with her this week, and Jon and the Dire Wolves were so cool!  Arya continues to train with her water dancing. It just isnt notable enough to change any opinion about her.

&amp;#x200B;

**6. Petyr Baelish (Last week 11)**

Jumping almost as much as the Dire Wolves, Petyr Baelish moves up five spots on the list. It seems obvious that Ned Stark would be lost in Kings Landing without the helpful guidance of Petyr Baelish. Petyr is proving quite the chess player. He is the one moving all the pieces behind the political scene. This is why, he has jumped up five spots to land at number six this week.

&amp;#x200B;

**7. Catelyn Stark (Last week 4)**

Catelyn drops four spots this week. It was pretty badass of her to take Tyrion in the Inn. She showed him who was ranking in the area. She may be off base because Tyrion really didnt try to have her son killed, but still. Do we ever find out who sent the assassin to kill Bran?

&amp;#x200B;

**8. Jorah Mormont (Last week 5)**

Jorah shows shares some wisdom with Daenerys this week. The truth now: do you want to see your brother sitting on the Iron Thorne? This wisdom doesnt keep Jorah from sliding three spots to number eight.

&amp;#x200B;

**9. Lord Varys (Last week 6)**

There was no change with Varys this week. Well, no change other than him sliding three spots this week to fall to the number nine spot.  Maybe when Varys gets some more screen time, he will move up the list.

&amp;#x200B;

**10. Tyrion Lannister (Last week 7)**

Tyrion is a good character. He brought designs of a saddle that will allow Bran to ride a horse. He does this despite Robb not offer hospitality at Winterfell. He sympathizes with Bran, but doesnt back away from the truth of Bran being crippled.  He doesnt let Theons condescending attitude rattle him. Despite all this, Tyrion falls three spots on the list.  Perhaps the fall is due to his surprise when Catelyn takes him prisioner.  At least he stayed in the top ten.

&amp;#x200B;

**11. Samwell Tarly (Last week - not ranked)**

Welcome to the list Samwell Tarly. You didnt crack the top ten, but you do rank the highest of the new entries this week.  Even though you are weak, and a coward Andrea thinks that youre a likable character. She thinks that you will turn out to do something good, like save Jon Snow or something. So, we look forward to seeing you on the list in the weeks to come.

&amp;#x200B;

**12. Brandon Stark (Last week 9)**

Bran didnt make much of an impression this week. He may have started the episode off being able to walk, but that was only in his dreams. Whats up with a raven with three eyes? That was more interesting than Bran. As a result, Bran finds himself out of the top ten at the number twelve spot.

&amp;#x200B;

**13. Sansa Stark (Last week 12)**

Even though she slips one spot this week, I dont really consider it falling this week. After all, the addition of a new character to the list is the only reason for the slip.  Sansa may be worried about the events on the Kings road, but she really hasnt shown anything about herself yet.

&amp;#x200B;

**14. Khal Drogo (Last week 13)**

Drogo didnt do much this week, so he didnt change much in the rankings this week.  

&amp;#x200B;

**15. Robert Baratheon (Last week 14)**

The king is a useless drunk that does nothing but whoring. He has mismanaged the kingdom. And nothing has changed since last week. So, he stays pretty much in the same spot. Disliked by Andrea.

&amp;#x200B;

**16. Viserys Targaryen (Last week 15)**

Viserys is just a narcissistic bully. He cant get his way with ability. Hes just trying to smash his way there. Unfortunately for him, his sister is no longer willing to submit to being smashed. Really, his clothes from Pentos dont really fit in well with the Dothraki sea. But, he is about as low as you can get on the list. So, his position doesnt change. He lands this week at number 16.  At least he is better liked than Joffrey Baratheon. So, the people of Westeros have some real winners lining up to be king.

&amp;#x200B;

**17. Joffrey Baratheon (Last week - not ranked)**

Welcome to the list Prince Joffrey. You are probably just a pawn of your mama, and just doing what she has planted in your head. Unfortunately the thoughts being planted in your brain are being planted by the most disliked character of them all. The prevailing thought is that you dont like girls at all. Perhaps that is why you are giving poor Sansa the cold shoulder.  But, hey, welcome to list anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

**18. Jamie Lannister (Last week 16)**

Jamie may not have been in this episode, but he is just too pretty and polished. He would slit someones throat in a moments notice. Hes a bad character with no loyalty to anyone. Well, no loyalty to anyone except Cersei. How sad.  

&amp;#x200B;

**19. Cersei Lannister (Last week 17)**

Cersei (or bitch of queen) is just evil. A woman trying to promote the success of her simpering little son is just dangerous.  The conversation between Cersei and Ned did nothing to move Cersei from the bottom of the list. I wonder if she will ever not be last.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Dead and not ranked:**

The knight who lasted just a moment was poorly matched in the joust. It was expected he would die. The knight who killed him is kind of natural. He might end up being something. He may be helpful because he hates his brother.  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

There it is, thats this weeks list. There was a lot of movement on this weeks list. I was most surprised by Petyrs big jump. Of those not listed, to me, it is interesting that the Mountain may be helpful because he hates the Hound. Perhaps killing little butchers boys doesnt win you any favors.

\* Will he fight for the living or the dead?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Notes:

* Do you agree with my list? Look at it this way; each person should be able to beat the person below them in single-combat, and would be expected to lose to the person above them in single-combat. 
* Is Arya too high?
* 1-3 are essentially a tossup. I think the single-combat winner would depend on the circumstances of the battle. However, I am confident that any of the top 3 could beat any of the other characters on this list. Do you agree?
* Looking at this list, do you feel the living stand a good chance against the dead? Of course this does not include dragons, armies, who has Valyrian steel, etc. But individual actions have been known to turn the tide of battle in previous conflicts.

jaime actor nikolaj told [HuffPost](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nikolaj-coster-waldau-jaime-lannister_us_5b7edaf2e4b0cd327dfabaad) he wrote a letter to the writers after he read the final script, saying

is nikolaj referring to gendry being actually his nephew in game of thrones??

-	Dany will survive childbirth to either a daughter or son (have not decided yet) but she will become the Night Queen and Jon will be forced to kill her.
-	Jons Son or Daughter will be Lightbringer but there is a catch, he or she is a very magical baby and if he or she grows up with the magic resulted from Jon and Danys magic he or she will bring a Long Summer of Fire and Blood. So Jon uses him or her for a pact with the NK, the NK removes the magic from him or her (with Mels help) and in return hell allow Sam to remove the Dragonglass from his chest. Killing him, the Wights, and the WWs
-	However before this the NK will try to 1v1 him but it will be revealed (along with the NKs reasons for attacking which is not them being mindless monsters) that a piece of Bran was left in the NK, and Arya is forced to kill Bran in order to weaken the NK.
-	Jon will have the throne melted down after all is said and done and setup a Proto-Democracy becoming Proto-Prime Minister I guess (if your wondering NO that would not be what its called because I couldnt come up with a better name). He will also marry Sansa so that his son or daughter can still have a mother.
-	 Bronn will finally get his castle in the form of Highgarden though Sam will still be Lord of the Reach ruling from his Ancestral home and raise Little Sam with Gilly.
-	Jaime will die defending one of the Stark children (most likely Bran) and die in the arms of Brienne. Brienne (possibly Pregnant with Jaimes child) stays in KL to continue to defend Sansa or becomes Lady of Stormlands in memory of Renly.
-	Either Arya or Euron will kill Cersei but when she raises as a Wight Jaime will put Widows Wail through her pale white throat.
-	CLEGANEBOWL, Sandor wins and goes North to be with Arya and Gendry in the North or goes to KL to be Sansas protector.
-	Arya also becomes the new Warden of the North and marries Gendry (weather or not he takes the Stark name is another story, depends on if he is legitimized)
-	Theon will die killing Euron and Yara will rule the Iron islands.
-	Sam writes the song of ice and fire and the bittersweet ending is that Westeros is saved but at a great cost as Westeros is left in ruins, loved ones are dead, and Jon lost another loved one.
-	Tyrion and Varys I have not decided there fades yet, maybe theres a Tyrion Plus Varys betrayal and they get executed or maybe its just Varys and Tyrion gets the Westerlands and opens a Vineyard with Jorah? Idk yet. Though once I decided I will re-edit this.",25,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

110,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-10-3,2018,10,3,3,9kt6tq,self.gameofthrones,"[SPOILERS] Re-watching the entire series, now knowing the future, really does offer an entirely new perspective on everyone's motivations throughout the show. One of the most surprising to me was Tywin and Tyrion Lannister's relationship as father and son.",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/9kt6tq/spoilers_rewatching_the_entire_series_now_knowing/,RealRobRose,1538504699,"Tywin never shows a hint of hating or disliking Tyrion for anything other than his own actions. It's Tyrion that constantly projects that he is hated for being a dwarf, when Tywin consistently makes it clear that his frustrations with Tyrion come from what he sees as a selfish attitude only concerned with his own pleasures and desires over the concerns of the family. Even the worst thing Tywin ever did to Tyrion was destroy his marriage, tell him she was a whore and make him watch. There's nothing that says he did this because he was a dwarf and everything that supports he did this because Tyrion secretly got married to a common woman with no notable last name, which in Tywin's eyes is treason against the family. 

Throughout the course of the show, Tywin very clearly grows to really respect Tyrion's cunning and cleverness and ability to command and lead in a way he didn't expect him to. The first time we see them together Tyrion walks in uninvited to a strategy meeting and begins to drink their wine. Tyrion assumes that Tywin never cared that Tyrion had been captured by Catlyn, but the truth is that we saw episodes prior that Tywin was the only one at that camp who cared to rescue his son. Though Tyrion's impression is that he's annoyed by him bringing a band a savages into his camp and promising them weapons, Tywin doesn't dishonor the request in anyway, takes advantage of having the men Tyrion's provided and promises them all of the things that Tyrion said they'd receive. 

Following the battle, Tywin sends Tyrion to King's Landing in his place as hand of the king to attempt to control Joffrey. At the time Tyrion takes this as some type of punishment based on his belief he's not cut out for that, and because Tywin forbids him to bring a prostitute into the Red Keep. 

But this is a massive indication of Tywin's belief in Tyrion's abilities. He's sending him as the only man he can trust to do a decent job next to himself, and Tyrion flourishes in the role. Far better than Tywin, l believe, later admits he expected. But, still. He wouldn't have had him do it in the first place if he didnt think he could handle it.

After Tywin arrives at Kings Landing and takes over as Hand, there's eventually a scene (that I'm forgetting now and should rewatch and edit this with details) where Tywin actually goes to Tyrion for advice, of course not making it sound that way, but when comparing how he spoke to Tyrion in Season 2 compared to here, Tywin listens to what Tyrion has to say, only giving his views on the issues with Tyrion's solutions as opposed to shooting him down entirely, but he does listen to his counsel, which goes entirely over Tyrion's head who's mind is more wrapped up in his secret relationship with Shae at that time. 

This might be the same conversation where the only time Tyrion's being a dwarf comes up. Tywin explains that he wanted to drown Tyrion after his wife died in childbirth delivering a dwarf. Killing dwarves at birth is considered an accepted practice in that world, especially in the circles Tywin aspired to and this is what becomes the focus of the speech. But Tywin ends his story by explaining that ultimately, he couldn't do it because Tyrion was his son. He didn't make this decision because of a ""woman's mercy"" like Joffrey explains or Sam Tarly's father's only reasoning for giving his son anything. Tywin looked down at Tyrion in his arms, all by himself and knew he couldn't harm his son.

This line, combined with how Tywin maneuvered and manipulated the trial to get Tyrion sent to the Wall as opposed to being executed, which Tyrion refused out of pride and self respect... which is what Tywin rightfully claims Tyrion held in higher regard than his family, tells me that Tywin was a lot more likely to be telling the truth when he tells Tyrion that he was never going to allow Tyrion to be executed and was only fulfilling his duties publicly as he had always done, before figuring it out behind the scenes. Even Jaime breaking Tyrion out was suspiciously easy to get done the night before an execution. You'd think if Tywin really wanted Tyrion dead, he'd have heavily guarded him and seem anything near surprised that Jaime let him go, if he didn't know it was coming.

Tywin's fatal flaw it seemed was deciding to use Tyrion's murder trial as a means to get Jaime back as his rightful heir at Casterly Rock. Something that he felt Tyrion just couldn't be trusted to do without whoring and drinking away his fortune. Taking advantage of that opportunity and actively placing Jaime's worth over Tyrion's regardless of his reasoning which... sadly do check out at the time he was making these choices, is what lead Tyrion to believing Tywin didn't care for him. 

Tywin entirely brought his reckoning upon himself by playing a game with Tyrion's life to get Jaime back to Casterly Rock. But the idea that Tywin hated him because he was a dwarf, or even hated him at all is entirely made up in Tyrion's mind. He was a messed up father that had very screwed up beliefs, but it's clear Tywin never looked at Tyrion as anything less than his son that he couldn't figure out how to get to use his talents for what he saw as good, but then when Tyrion began to start proving himself, found out that he was secretly still indulging in what he saw as vices he'd never give up, and then gave up on mentoring Tyrion when given the chance to have Jaime back.

Still not a good dude. But he didn't hate his son.

Also, the dude's name is pretty much Twin and his twin children are incestuous, which is the worst thing he could ever possibly imagine with his obsession over family, yet is also exactly what hed preached them his whole life ""only family, ever.""",52,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I can't really say much that other positive reviewers haven't. The pacing is fantastic, the atmosphere seeps through the story for nearly every single chapter, and the events are incredible. I love the way cause &amp; effect plays through this plot, and the way the plot progresses moves very well. The intrigue is riveting, which moves into a multi-sided war, with so many different motivations.

I had three problems with the book though. First, I saw the show before the book, so I had scenes clear in my head. Martin would write in details that directly contradict what I saw in the show. But that's not his fault. My problem with Martin is that he doesn't offer enough environmental description. He would give me enough to contradict the show, but he wouldn't give me a full enough picture of the scene. Plenty of times I was confused as to where everyone was, or what their surroundings were like.
Second, his characters just do not seem that deep. I know this is only the first book, but characters like Ned and Jon just seem to be very bland, with little personality. (that said, book Jon is FAR better than show-Jon.) Nevertheless, he still makes these bland characters relatable, somehow. (like Jon) And he has a few good characters, with deep personalities. (Tyrion, Daenarys, Arya)
Third, and this is more a personal preference, but the description is not very physical. In my favorite series, the Wheel of Time, the prose is written in a way that lets you feel ever move the characters make, and it immerses you in detailed scenes. The way Martin writes, you have characters gliding smoothly through barely-described scenes, which was hard to get immersed in. (his history and info-dumping is perfectly done, however)

There were a few issues with the prose itself, with repeated phrases (he\she could not pretend surprise; we have needs to....; etc) And a few odd choices of word. The one that comes to mind was ""...he said bluntly. He was not one to blunt his words."" Context will tell you Martin had a different meaning for each ""blunt"", only he put them right next to each other, so it was very contradictory.


I don't want to sound like I'm hating on this book. I actually love it a lot. It's just everybody else praises this book to no end; go read their reviews. I just wanted to tell you my thoughts on the bad, or maybe different opinions from others. I definitely recommend this book for fantasy or drama fans.",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

It has a cool multi-layered strategy component where you are maneuvering units on the battlefield, while also claiming spots on the tactics board to simulate political intrigue, which influences how the battle plays out. Finally, each commander has a special set of tactics cards which really captures the feel of that character.

Now this setting is based off of the book series and not the HBO show, with GRRM being consulted for the look of the miniatures, so if you are looking for the HBO cast in miniature youll have to look elsewhere. That being said the the miniatures are super cool! Check out some examples painted by the ASOIAF miniature community here: [https://youtu.be/uuMcSk3d-9s](https://youtu.be/uuMcSk3d-9s)

140,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-10-3,2018,10,3,18,9kzgme,self.gameofthrones,[Spoilers] Theory: Robert Strong is actually the Mountain,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/9kzgme/spoilers_theory_robert_strong_is_actually_the/,Pallanos,1538557297,"This is surely going to cause some controversy, but having studied the texts thoroughly I believe there is a strong chance that Robert Strong, the knight dedicated to driving all of Tommen's enemies from the realm, is actually Gregor Clegane, the Mountain who rides.

Gregor Clegane, before his supposed slaying by Prince Oberyn, was one of the Lannisters most powerful tools. This reputation is in part due to his sheer physical size and strength. According to Edward VII, Gregors is almost eight feet tall, and according to Tyrion X, he can hack a man in half with a single blow of his great sword, which he can wield in one hand. There is common consensus that the man is large, and in the context of brutal medieval warfare, this gives him a competitive advantage over his contemporaries.

Gregors other strength is his undying loyalty to the Lannisters, whether out of self interest or not. Since his rape of Elia Martell, Gregor has carried out the wishes of the Lannisters to the letter, it is his actions that draw out the Kings men from the court, and he without question serves as champion for Cersei in her trial by combat. Truly, a dog of the house of Lannister moves us to fear.

Finally, the sheer brutality of his actions, remorseless to the last, has given him a fearsome reputation that strikes fear into the heart of the enemies of Lannister, known to have killed a man for snoring (Arya IX). Clegane has a thirst for violence, leaving his castle only for tourney and war.

So lets take a look at the death of Clegane. The Mountain is struck by Oberyn with a deadly poison, that cannot be cured and is extremely painful and long-lasting. Seems pretty conclusive that this is the end of the road for him, as the Viper's sting cannot be drawn out, right? Wrong.

My contention is that Qyburn, maester attached to the Lannister house, somehow found a method to keep Gregor Clegane alive in some sort of zombified state, and that this method has led to the creation of Robert Strong. Qyburn, who was kicked from the citadel for his unorthodox approach to medicine, and claims to know the nature of life and death better than any man living (Cersei II). 

The Hound, Jaime Lannister and Barristan Selmy all share a mutual disdain for the abilities of the Kingsguard, yet all respect the power of the Mountain. For Cersei to lose such a physically powerful unquestioning servant would likely have spelled the end of her security, what with Jaime having lost his right hand. Thus the motive is clear, and the method also, as Qyburn had been kicked from the citadel for necromancy. 

Thus we the reader, are presented with Robert Strong, a man as large as Clegane and just as unquestioning, not even expressing verbally his thoughts. Robert strong does not eat, drink or sleep, behaviour we might assign to a ZOMBIE perhaps. None of his skin is ever shown by his armour, likely because of the aforementioned methods of Qyburn.

Please, don't allow yourself to be drawn into disbelief and derision quite yet. Consider Robert Strong's past, if he was a real man. He's eight feet tall, and strong to match, and not a single man in westeros has ever referred to him? What was he doing during the clash of kings, his size alone would have had lords across the realm promises oaths of lands, castles and daughters. Something clearly doesn't add up here, Robert Strong is a new element to Westeros, and his source is Clegane. 

Please let me know your thoughts and any additional lines of enquiries you would like me to follow.",6,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

On my first watch, I thought Cersei just hated Tyrion, but on my rewatches, I've realised that (before season 4 anyway) that wasn't the case at all. It was more of a sibling rivalry (her smug smile when Tyrion got embarrassed in Joff's wedding was more of a petty sibling satisfaction than anything), and they really did treat each other like (usually annoying, sometimes jealous) siblings after all, and had a great deal of trust in each other, shown by how frequently they hung out together to dicuss the war, family and just life in general (especially from Cersei, who confided in Tyrion several times her regrets and even broke down in front of him).

I also noticed things I missed initially, like how she got Joff to find Tyrion in season 1 just before she returned to KL, to say goodbye, and how she actually (somewhat) reassured Tyrion of his safety in season 3, when he found out it was apparently Joff who ordered Mandon Moore to kill him. So, when Cersei gave Tyrion that advice in season 3 regarding his sham marriage, I now see it as genuine advice from her. It was also great to see how they both, together, remice about their unfortunate Tywin-forced marriages in season 3. 

Having gone over their scenes again... I now believe that Cersei, unhinged as she is, wanted Tyrion dead in season 4 because she genuinely (albeit irrationally) thought he killed Joffrey. Not because she just decided to pin the blame on him out of hate. Though, after the Purple Wedding... Yeah, they both really hate each other all right.",9,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

 Seven Starks (excluding Jon Snow...for reasons)
 Bran's Age
 Jon is the 7th ""Aegon""

GOT may be the most popular show of all time, and I wouldn't put it past any half assed blogger, reporter, or straight up troll to ruin it for everybody who hasn't read the series.  

By delaying the book publishing, HBO is ensuring that they'll keep everybody subscribed and watching every week.  If people knew the gist of the ending, some would decide to binge later after all the episodes aired.  Also, we know the ending will be bittersweet and divide viewers, especially the average viewer who (still somehow) expects a happy epilogue.

- She was forced to marry a Stark to live in one of the least comfortable regions of the kingdoms.
- Just as that life was about to begin... the big, strong, well respected Stark she was supposed to marry gets tragically murdered by the King &amp; must then marry Ned (at the time the less respected of the brothers)
- She gets settled in the North, then Ned goes off to war leaving her pregnant with their first child by herself in a strange &amp; harsh land surrounded by people that don't entirely respect 'southerners'
- When Ned returns he has a baby in tow &amp; she is led to believe that Ned betrayed her honor by lying with a low class whore.
- She is then expected to sleep with Ned &amp; give him more kids and raise them, all while Jon serves as a painful reminder of Ned's betrayal &amp; her disgraced honor
- Bran falls, goes into a coma, leaving her terrified that she is about to lose a child. 
- When Jon finally leaves for the Wall, Ned leaves to KL taking their 2 young daughters with him, and she is left alone again while one of their children may be on his deathbed.
- An assassin breaks in to murder her son, failing but mangling her in the process.
- Robb then follows Ned to KL for justice compelling her to follow &amp; - as if she wasn't stressed out enough - she must leave Bran behind not knowing if she will ever see him alive again 
- During her dangerous trip south she thinks she found the culprit in Bran's assassination attempt, brings him to her sister for justice only to watch him seemingly escape justice. 
- While far from home she finds out that King Robert died &amp; Ned was executed by the boy king ... not just any boy king but the 'son' of her husband's best friend &amp; her eldest daughter's betrothed (imagine finding out that your spouse was murdered and your eldest daughter being held against her will is now being forced to marry his murderer)
- Arya and Sansa are then left without any protection which has to be one of the most stressful things for any mother, considering what tends to happen to young unprotected girls in this world
- Distraught and enraged she follows Robb towards war and attempts to help raise allies to help seek justice &amp; the return of her daughters, and succeeds in recruiting her father's house ... only to arrive just after her fathers death without being able to say goodbye (in the show at least)
- In a desperate attempt to regain her daughters she frees their army's biggest negotiating asset (Jaime) and leaves her more alone than ever now having lost the trust &amp; respect of her son.
- Since the Riverlands army turns out to be smaller than expected, so she sets out in recruiting Renly with the house of Baratheon to their cause, and succeeds again...
- Only to watch Renly be assassinated in front of her eyes by dark magic &amp; the alliance fall apart, and trek back north to Robb with her only company &amp; protection being a woman she barely knows.
- She then watches her son fall in love with a woman during his war path, foolishly breaking his oath to Walder Frey which she knows will hold consequences but she feels powerless to prevent
- Just as things finally seemed to be going well, they find out that Theon - their steward that she helped raise - betrayed her &amp; her son by taking their home, forcing them to abandon their warpath &amp; head back north ... losing the chance to get her daughters back safely (which she knew becomes significantly more unlikely by the day) ... and now believes both of her youngest sons are likely dead.
- And lastly - for the cherry on top! - without ever making it back home to learn that her other sons are still alive, and without ever finding out that Sansa/Arya are alive &amp; 'safe', **and without ever finding out that Jon is in fact not Ned's bastard &amp; he had never betrayed her** ... she is betrayed by a man she knew since she was a little girl, is forced to watch the only child she has which she knows to be 'safe' murdered in front of her eyes along with her soon-to-be first and only grandchild, before having her throat slit &amp; bleeding out beside her dead son.

I mean ... just ... holy FUCK. That is about as tragic a fucking life as any character has had in any story ever told. ",829,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

The third was plunged into the heart of his Wife.

Dany and Jon obviously love each other, given that scene in 7-6, so I think its possible that if Jon truly is Azor Ahai reborn, well.... I damn well hope theres no marriage in store for him.

One reason I think this will happen is because hes confirmed Rhaegars son, so Dany is not Queen. If he married her, and killed her like the first Azor Ahai, it clears the way for:
A: The true king of Westeros, by birth at least.
B: Azor Ahai, the one foretold in the prophecy of Fire and Ice.

I think this show does (did) a really good job of making the majority of the audience side with the 'heroes' or seemingly gallant characters regardless of what they do to minor or evil characters.

With that being said I fully support Jon snow bringing the wildlings beyond the wall, that was the logical correct decision and it's like Stark wanting to kill WS, but Rogers not letting him since he was, from a logical POV, innocent. So Olly was pretty much Stark in this situation. And I also understand Jon executing Olly from a logical POV, although he isn't exactly a model for following vows and he is reforming what the Nights Watch used to stand for, so the humane decision would've been to let Olly live, he was a child after all, that was seemingly manipulated by Allister.

But even after all this, I think Olly's actions were justified. Starting from watching his peaceful existence be torn down by wildlings, who attacked a Village that were not in arms. With Ygritte bowing down his father and some wilding slashing the throat of his mother, while someone said they'd be eating the remainder of his parents or something, I can't even begin to understand what kind of a mental state someone would be in after that. So killing Ygritte would've been his own ""boy avenges the death of parents"", even moreso is his hatred of the wildlings, that from his presumptions were little more than bandits. So him betraying Jon Snow, who had seemingly joined his enemies seemed reasonable, especially for a child.

That's why after thinking it through (I have never really hated Olly though, he is certainly no Joffrey just because he gutted the show favourite), I think people should forgive Olly and look at things from his perspectives, GoT is REALLY good at creating characters, that could be presented as heroes if the show was from their perspectives.",15,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Jon Snow is King of the North... However he is also the nephew of Daenerys.

I was so lucky that i got a seat, because actually there were only like a couple left.

This was a once in a lifetime, unforgettable experience. Listening to Game Of Thrones themes is amazing enough, but  experiencing it in real life, with a pro orchestra, Ramin Djawadi himself and the special effects? A dream come true. Especially if you consider that all of this will end in 1 year. No more GOT :'(

Honestly, all of the musicians were exceptional. The violin lady touched my heart with her The north remembers theme.

The flute guy is just crazy what he can do, the cello, the drummers, the orchestra...amazing.

Also, a little side note: This sounds at least 3 times better in person, the sound quality is not the best because i used a new phone that i didnt have any video experience with.

**TV SHOW THEORY ONLY**

All theories I have seen of Gendry being the son of Cersei and Robert say that it was Cersei who got rid of the son due for her hatred of Robert. I am yet to see one that suggests that it was solely Jamie who was responsible for faking the death of the child.

Theory: Jamie was so in love with Cersei, and jealous of her relationship with Robert (it seems she was in love with both Jamie and Robert at the time) that he decided to get rid of the child that they were bonding over to drive them apart. He switched the baby with one that was already dying of fever, and planned to either kill or get rid of the real baby. Either he or an accomplice (possibly ignoring Jamie's orders to kill the baby) gave the baby to the blacksmith with money to keep the baby safe.
Clues:
-The addition of the scene where Cersei comforts Catelyn while Bran is in a coma. This scene must have been added for a reason, and most people believe it was solely to emphasise the fact that ALL Roberts children would have black hair, particularly with Cersei. Although it does serve this purpose, it really wasn't necessary. The books didn't require the scene to prove ""The seed is strong"" so why did the TV show? I think it provides a nice foreshadowing that both Catelyn and Cersei's sons were almost taken away by Jamie (Jamie had just tried to kill Bran saying ""The things I do for love"" as if he had done it before).
- In this same scene, Cersei describes this baby as ""a fighter"". In season 8, Gendry describes himself as a fighter. Although this theory suggests that Gendry never fell ill so wasn't the baby ""fighting"" - the clue still works.
- Cersei had feelings for Robert even after the death of their first child. Thus it is unlikely Cersei was involved in faking the death, and would have wanted to keep the child as she still had feeling for Robert at that point.
- Maggy the Frog's prophecy obviously didn't take into account that this child survived childbirth. So it's also possible that this child was discounted because Cersei will never know the baby survived, so to her, she only had 3 children.
- Gendry knows his mother had yellow hair and was a Tavern wench. In the books, Cersei used to dress up as a Tavern wench when she would sneak off with Jamie. It makes senes that Jamie would use this as a nice story for Gendry's mother. He was given to the blacksmith along with a lot of money from a rich man.
Why Jamie never owned up:
- He wants his own children on the throne
- Cersei may leave him if she found out
- He would definitely get charged for treason
- His three incest children would be outed as illegitimate and their lives would be at risk.
- Gendry's life may also be at risk
Predictions:
- As mentioned above, for this theory to work, Cersei must never know the truth otherwise it contradicts Maggy the Frog's prophecy. I think Jaime will reveal the truth, but as he will end up joining the nights watch, his crimes don't matter anymore.
- For endgame, Gendry will be on the Iron Throne as the rightful heir with Sansa as his wife and they will rule together. Their children will be named Arya, Robb and Rickon (I think Arya will also die). Jon Snow will be Warden of the North. Hand of the king will hopefully be Ser Davos!
Reasons why this probably isn't true:
- As we already have R+ L = J confirmed, it is a bit cliche to have too many hidden/secret children.
- They never mention in the TV show that Cersei dressed up as a Tavern wench, only in the books. Having that bit of detail in would have tied this theory together nicely.

Please bear in mind that I think this is NOT true in the books, and was crafted by the show writers as an alternative storyline for the show. Clues were planted in the first season, but not many more in case they didn't carry it through or so it would be too obvious.

All comments/ suggestions/ proof this can't be true encouraged! Also, if this theory already exists, please link me!

I should specify that I didn't enjoy most of the Winterfell, Arya v Sansa, stuff. It could've played out differently, yet still ended the same. I would've enjoyed the sisters sharing what they've endured and slowly piecing together how Littlefinger had been behind causing them so much pain and loss. Granted, it wouldn't been as suspenseful, and takes away the shock and joy of him being called out. But Littlefinger still loses the game he played so well.

Back to what I enjoyed. When it's dropped on him, he's shocked. However, I like to think he's actually just processing his next moves. First he plays dumb, claiming confusion. States he killed Lysa to protect the Lady of Winterfell, which should appease the onlookers. When Sansa shuts him down with his true motives, he plays the crazy card to downplay the accusations. He realises Sansa has pieced it together, so he flat out denies it, because it's true, no one else was there to prove it.

Then the all seeing Bran hits him with his own words (again), which he could again deny, but he's probably so shocked as to how he could know, that he freezes. Getting Sansa alone is his next play, as he could somehow change her mind or possibly try something more drastic. After Sansa burns him and proves that he's been played, he commands to be escorted to the Vale. The Starks have used his knowledge is power to halt him, so he tries Cersei's playbook, power is power, by trying to get his army to get him out safely. When denied, he knows he screwed, so he goes to his last resort, something he has probably never done. Beg and plead for his life, but it is all for naught.

I enjoyed his death because he still tries to manipulate himself out of this dire situation. But after all his plotting and betrayal, it finally catches up to him before Arya finishes the job.",43,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Also I know I may have made post like this already (I can't remember if I did or not but if I did I'll probably take those down) but this is just some of the things I really want to see, I may make a companion post where I talk about some Crackpot/Tinfoil predictions I would like to see (even though they may not happen) anyways let's begin:

1. More info on the NK's backstory, his identity, and the reasoning for the WW's return (maybe it involves Jon's birth combined with them being threatened by the Lord of Light or something like that, also I would like the NK's backstory to be something we don't expect.)

2. Reunions (specifically Jon's reunions with Sam, Ghost, Bran, Sansa (again), and Arya. Jorah's reunion with Sam and the Little bear, Sandor's reunion with the Stark sisters, Tyrion's reunion with Sansa, and Jaime's second reunion with Brienne)

3. Someone else OTHER then Jon and/or Dany ruling Westeros by the end (maybe it's Sansa instead or Tyrion or Arya and Gendry or maybe nobody, with Jon ruling the north and Dany possibly by his side)

4. Unexpected betrayals (in this case Varys betraying J&amp;D and co. and Qyburn maybe betraying Cersei, With Varys and Qyburn having there own agenda)

5. Howland Reed and Ghost (need I say more)

6. Jaime apologizing to Bran/Dying Protecting Bran (I made this one separate because of how important it is and it be very powerful to see, and while I still think Jaime will kill Cersei I also think it would be cool if he died protecting Bran instead)

7. Jon finds out about the Bag of faces and confronts Arya/Complete Retcon of the WF plotline (basically Jon finds out about the bag of faces and her behavior towards Sansa last season and here is where they Retcon the WF Plotline by having Arya explain she was testing Sansa/Pushing her into not trusting LF.)

8. The Golden Company and Euron surprise attack WF during the first battle against the AOTD (which I think would add a lot more to the battle as J&amp;D and co. are attacked from both sides.)

9. If the third book twist does not revolve around NK and the WW's have be something involving either Euron, Arya, or Dany (once again, need I say more.)

10. Red Followers being revealed to be true secondary Antagonist to the WW's and just as bad as them (and also kindof the result of the problem with the WW's being threatened by them, and the Red God Followers not being good guys like they seem)

11. More pair ups (examples: Arya and Gendry, maybe Jaime and Brienne (though I realistically seeing them confess these feelings as Jaime dies in Brienne's arms to be honest), Sansa and Pod (or someone not abusive, if Sansa even lives to the end that is, i'll get to that in a bit), and of course Bronn and some Prostitutes ;))

12. CLEGANEBOWL (this one also speaks for itself)

13. Bastards, Cripples, and Broken things rebuilding Westeros by the end (basically the likes of people like Tyrion, Bran, Arya, Gendry, Sam, etc. rebuilding What's left of Westeros)

14. Longer Episodes (once again this also speaks for itself)

15. Atleast one more emotional Stark death before the end (in this case either Bran, Jon, or Sansa)

16. Cersei dies (Jaime seems like the fitting person to do but if not him then either Arya or Euron)

Honorable Mentions: Catspaw being more important then it seems, Theon vs Euron (with Theon dying killing Euron), Bigger deaths, Jon being the embodiment of Lightbringer, Edmure returning or atleast writing him out in a way that does not make fans mad, Daario returning even though it seems highly unlikely at this point, J&amp;D's Twins Plus Dany surviving Childbirth and dying in battle, and NK defeating by removing the Dragonglass from his chest. Oh and Sam writing the story.",30,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

The bear attacks the Hound, saved only by Thoros and Jorah coming in to stab the bear in the head/neck/whatever.  Then Jorah tells the group they need to get Thoros back to the wall.

I think he gonna be king when Jon and Daneyrs die which they definitely will and also definitely have a baby from the aunt-nephew incest from Targeyerans. 

Sansa is dead but Arya and her mom Lady Stoneheart pull up and kills the night king finally in a epic showdown as retribution for Jon snows death as they both are avengers for the stark deaths.

-I think Mr.Night King is gonna sacrifice his army at winterfell with an epic battle in the first or second episode and then fly to Kings Landing and hooks up with Cersie and take the 1 million inhabitiants of KL. 

Their will be a super mega ultra battle that'll cost as much as maybe 2 feature films stuffed into 20mins of action and an hour of dialog and shit. Its gonna be dothrakies, ice and fire dragons, dead giants, etc.. but the final scene in the last episode of the hit show Game of Thrones is....

Now who would win in a fight between several popular Game of Thrones villains and DC/Marvel comics superheroines on Westeros turf. And why would one group or another win. I wanted to do it on this subreddit cuz people on this subreddit know the strengths and weaknesses of GoT villains. Alright then. Below is a list of the popular Game of Thrones villains and each of them has an army of 100 of their followers with them.

Lancel

Xaro Xhoan Daxos and Pyat Pree

Karl Tanner

Ser Janos Slynt

The Waif

Pycelle

Craster

Ser Meryn Trant

Viserys 

Qyburn

Ser Allister Thorne

Mirri Maz Duur

Roose Bolton

Ser Gregor Clegane

The High Sparrow

Ramsay

Walder Frey

Littlefinger

Tywin

Cersei

Joffrey Baratheon.

Those are the villains team. Do not say many of villains hate one another because for this post, they will be working together. This is a murderer's lineup. I did not include Locke cuz I don't like how he's named after one of my favorite philosophers in politics. 

Hero team is not a list. But these superheroines come only from DC and Marvel, not from any indie brands. This video is what the roster of superheroines team is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HShSU2S84SY. So borrow DC and Marvel superheroines from the video and say why she could or couldn't defeat GoT villains.  Give serious reasons. Highlights superheroines are powerful ones, Storm, Jean Grey, Rogue, Psylocke, Raven, Argent, Wonder Woman, Zatanna, Donna Troy, Cassie Sandsmark etc. Pls give why u think one team will win. Hope to hear ur reasons for who u would think would win.

Which yeah it would be hard not to stare in disbelief and looking at the amount of blood.

It's so good and so detailed that I instantly started it over just cause in case I missed anything. I don't know if it's been discussed before but I can't help but think Daario has some ties to Rhaegar Targaryen. 

Him helping Daenerys and overthrowing the second sons makes me think ok that was too easy. There has to be some separate motivation other than him just being attracted to her or her being a queen. After all he saved her life, risked his, and freed a city which gave her thousands of followers.

Now why the ties to Rhaegar Targaryen? Time to put our tinfoil hats on. I suspect that Jaqen H'ghar the faceless man is actually Rhaegar in hiding. 

The Valar morghulis coin gives me evidence that there is some connection. In the opening episode of season 4, Arya comes across some Frey soldiers; she pretends to pay money to get warm and slaughters them with the hound. She pulled out that coin that they were completely unfamiliar with. Perhaps it's a currency used in the eastern part of the known world maybe that's why the Frey troops didn't recognize it? Now the second sons were in possession of the same exact coin when deciding who would kill Daenerys, but there has to be a reason when Daario pulls out the same coin he utters the ""valar morghulis"" line. Why would the writers add that in? (If someone wants to debunk all of this please address that line as well!) His skills as a fighter, how he played his comrades leads me to believe he has some separate training. 

The faceless man how could we truly know who he is? Everything about his identity is questionable. There's theories out there that support that he could actually be Rhaegar in hiding. His interest in Arya stark who  even Ned said in s1 resembles his dead sister Lyana stark who was in love with Rhaegar. His strand of blonde hair that looks a lot like the Targaryen hair. Perhaps the reason why he's hiding in the first place using different face masks? Maybe there is a purpose of the people he is killing. Maybe each person had a hand in aiding the Targaryen genocide somehow? Even rhaegars death there's no guarantee he is actually dead, his body was never found. Many witnessed Baratheon force an axe into the chest plate of his armor, sending his body back to a body of water. Arya had to travel by boat to get to the faceless man.

Both characters also unexpectedly disappear from the plot with little answers as to why. Ok cool Arya got her training from the faceless man, but I still feel his true intentions never showed for some reason. Daenerys just sends Daario away like he didn't help her conquer the east's lords. Maybe he will play a part with the gold company in s8 but I think perhaps we'll see the two characters I've been mentioning link up somehow or some sort of connection explained whether in the show or maybe future books it's referenced. 

All of it is suspicious to me...daario's interest and connection with daenerys and likewise with Jaqen and Arya stark.

This got me thinking, what if Game of Thrones would do something similar? What if the first promo, teaser, or even trailer would be released on the first day of winter, Friday December 21st, and the premiere will take place around the first day of spring in 2019, Wednesday March 20th?

It's so good and so detailed that I instantly started it over just cause in case I missed anything. I don't know if it's been discussed before but I can't help but think Daario has some ties to Rhaegar Targaryen. 

Him helping Daenerys and overthrowing the second sons makes me think ok that was too easy. There has to be some separate motivation other than him just being attracted to her or her being a queen. After all he saved her life, risked his, and freed a city which gave her thousands of followers.

Now why the ties to Rhaegar Targaryen? Time to put our tinfoil hats on. I suspect that Jaqen H'ghar the faceless man is actually Rhaegar in hiding. 

The Valar morghulis coin gives me evidence that there is some connection. In the opening episode of season 4, Arya comes across some Frey soldiers; she pretends to pay money to get warm and slaughters them with the hound. She pulled out that coin that they were completely unfamiliar with. Perhaps it's a currency used in the eastern part of the known world maybe that's why the Frey troops didn't recognize it? Now the second sons were in possession of the same exact coin when deciding who would kill Daenerys, but there has to be a reason when Daario pulls out the same coin he utters the ""valar morghulis"" line.

Other examples is in Dexter, listen to at least the 30 second mark, maybe someone that hasnt watched it can tell me if it sounds like a iconic sound for a show?

Now the reason I believe this is while yes Jaime killing Cersei would also fulfill his arc not only did they leave out the Valonqar part of the prophecy from the show but also I feel it be more poetic if we was to die protecting the boy he caused harm to all those years ago, it also be cool to see him die in the arms of Brienne instead of Cersei. Now as for why Arya or Euron...well I don't think I need to go into why Arya would be a good candidate to kill Cersei except this would technically make her both the Valonqar (reminder I know Valonqar was not mentioned in the show) AND the more beautiful Queen (especially that last one since only the more beautiful queen part was mentioned) though weather or not queen of Westeros or queen of west of Westeros is another story (maybe Maggy meant a Queen in general not queen in Westeros), but for Euron i'll make a companion post explaining how that works.",16,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

First, How couldnt Hodor help Meera when they were being overrun? Meera was talking to him just before she checked outside and found out they were surrounded. When she went back into the cave to help, she asked for his help but he seemed unresponsive and wouldnt act unless Bran warged into him.

Also, couldnt the Three Eyed Raven have woken Bran up? Hed shown in the past that he can pull Bran out of a vision if hes going too deep or about to learn something hes not ready to learn. Yet, when theyre being overrun by an Army of the Dead, hes being cryptic and doesnt seem to help them that much. If that isnt a situation that demands a bit of urgency, I dont know what is.

# The Wolf and the Lion

Welcome to another entry of the list of Andreas favorite characters. Andrea has only seen the first five episodes to come up with this list.  Last weeks entry Daenerys had fallen from the number one spot to be replaced by the rapidly rising Jon Snow. Can Jon hold on to the top spot?  The three most memorable scenes for Andrea in episode 5 where Arya facing off with guards, Ned facing off with Robert, and Robert and Cersei having a heart to heart talk. So, lets find out how these scenes affect the list.

 1. **Arya Stark (Last week 5)**  
 

Arya is proving herself as a strong and fearless character. She is willing to get dirty. The scene where she faces off with the guards really shows her true character. Arya has been number one twice before in the list, but she fell all the way down to the number five position. This week, she jumps back up to the number one spot.

 

2.**Ned Stark (Last week 4)**

Ned is an honorable guy! But, he is getting older. Hes not in favor. Andrea just doesnt see a future for him. Despite this, he has jumped up two spots in this list to number two. Maybe its the way that he can tell the king that he is too fat for his armor.

 

3.**Daenerys Targaryen (Last week 2)**

Daenerys slips another spot in the list for the second week in a row.  Again, her fall isnt because she has lost favor. Quite the opposite, she remains aware of the world that she lives in. She still understands that her weak brother is worthless.  It is just that when you dont get a lot of screen time, you have a tendency to slip in the memory. Still, the number three spot is pretty impressive.

 

4.**Jon Snow (Last week 1)**

After two weeks of constant rise, and rising to the number one spot, Jon Snow has finally had a week where he has fallen. This week he fell three spots to land at number four. But, like Daenerys, when you dont get screen time, you lose your high spot on the list.  At least Daenerys was mentioned by Robert.  

 

5.**Loras Tyrell (Last week  not ranked)**

This week, Loras gave a beutiful flower to Sans, bested the Mountain is a joust, was saved by the Hound, and tried to convince his lover Lord Renly that Renly should be king. But, the most impressive thing he did was to make it onto this list. Loras lands on the list in the number five spot. Loras is a pleasant surprise. Hes not big and tough, but he has skills. Hes smart, and is going to be a good player at the game of thrones. Hell win with his brains, not his might. 

 

6.**Petyr Baelish (Last week 6)**

Petyr is a slippery character. He wheels and deals with everybody. When he and Varys squared off, it made Andrea wonder where his allegiance lies.  In the end, he will most likely lean toward the good side. That is why he keeps hold of his number six spot on this list.  

 

7.**Catelyn Stark (Last week 7)**

Catelyn has more substance than originally thought. She showed strength when she informed the guards that Tyrion was HER prisoner after arriving at the Vale. In the end, she is expected to kick some ass. Her position on the list hasnt changed. She still sits in the number seven spot.

 

8.**Tyrion Lannister (Last week 10)**

Tyrion is showing he has a conscious.  It was once thought that he was just a party boy, but now hes not all that bad. He assisted in the defense of the group even though he is a prisoner. He can hold his own in battle. He is starting to bond with Bronn. He is also moving up in this list. He moves up two spots to number eight this week. When he finds out what Jamie and Cersei are up to, he may go against them. He doesnt mean anybody harm.

 

9.**Samuel Tarley (Last week 11)**

Only being in the list two weeks, and not getting much screen time this week, there is not much to say about Sam. But, since he seems like such a likable character he defies the norm and moves up two spots on the list this week. He has landed at the number nine spot.

 

10.**Jorah Mormont (Last week 8)**

Not being in the episode this week, there is not much to say about the Jorah. Not being in the episode, he drops two spots to number ten.

 

11.**Kahl Drogo (Last week 14)**

Another no show in this episode, Khal Drogo also bucks the norm of falling down in the list by moving up three spots. Congrats Drogo!

 

12.**Dire Wolves (Last week 3)**

The most harmed by not being in the episode is the dire wolves. They drop nine spots this week and land on the number twelve spot.

 

13.**Brandon Stark (Last week 12)**

Bran is just whiney! He was a brat when getting his lesson from Maester Luwin. Hes likely to abuse his position. Thus he falls one spot this week to the number thirteen spot.

 

14.**Sansa Stark (Last week 13)**

This week Sansa received a flower from the Knight of Flowers. Thats sweet. Hopefully, Sansa will not end up with Joffrey.  

 

15.**Lord Varys (Last week 9)**

Andrea has started thinking about Varys in a positive light. He had an impressive banter back and forth with Little Finger. This still didnt stop his slipping of six spots on the list. He lands at number fifteen.

 

16.**The Hound (Last week  not ranked)**

Holy cow! This list is getting long. How many characters are there anyway?  The Hound defended Loras this week, and earns a spot on the list.  The honor he showed may have gotten him on the list, but his past actions such riding down the butchers boy lands him pretty low on the list. He debuts at number sixteen.

 

17.**The Mountain (Last week - not ranked)**

When you show great strength by cutting off a horses head with a single blow, you are going to make an impression. Unfortunately, it is not a good impression. The Mountain lands on the list at number seventeen.

18.**Robert Baratheon (Last week 15)**

Robert drops three spots this week proving that he is still just not liked.  He is just a narcissistic fool. He may have had might when he was younger. Now, he is just an old drunk who cant fit into his armor.

 

19.**Joffrey Baratheon (Last week 17)**

Joffrey had a sour look on his face at the tournament.  This does nothing to improve his favor in Andreas eyes. He drops two spots down to the number nineteen spot.

 

20.**Cersei Lannister (Last week 19)**

Its hard to drop lower than the last spot. But, Cersei slipped one spot to the number twenty spot. But, she is no longer in the cellar.  This week she had a human moment. If she had been born male, she would be a force to be reckoned with. She has the intelligence to run a kingdom, although it probably would be in a cruel way.

21.**Viserys Targaryen (Last week 16)**

Really, if you cant make the top twenty, thats pretty sad. Viserys has landed at number twenty one. He is still just spiteful and petty.

 

22.**Jamie Lannister (Last week 18)**

Jamies money gives him power.  It doesnt give him a high rank on this list. Jamie showed he was a bully when he circled Ned and his three men with a much larger group of soldiers.  

 

**The DEAD:**

Jory Cassel: Having a knife put through your eye seems like a pretty gruesome way to die. But, at least you can say he saw it coming. He was a good character, although he was only around for a little while.

The Mountains horse: Nobody should kill a horse. Really, the horse was just horny. Thats no reason to die.

Two extra Stark men: Not much can be said about these men. They were just extras.  I mean did you know their names were Heward and Wyl?

So, thats the latest list. The number of characters is getting way up there. I may have to make some changes to the format so that the posts dont go on forever. Any suggestions would be appreciated.  For now, let me know if you agree with Andrea or not? Would Arya be your favorite character after five episodes? Would Jamie be the most despised?",3,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

So from S2 to S5 I thought she was alright, not bad but not close to some of the best ones (Peter, Lena, Charles, Diana, etc), some scenes she did a good job but her acting didn't really stood out most of the time. However in S6 and S7 I really enjoyed her acting, particularly in S7 when she starts to open up I think that fits Emilia a lot more and I thought she was actually really good this past season.

On a side note, I thought her acting when Viserion died and then later when Jon bends the knee was on point, add to that there's nothing actually there, it's all CGI and a green screen, which makes it harder.

Overall, though I never thought she was doing a bad job in those seasons, I could understand why some people didn't like her acting, that's not the case anymore, imo she's improved a lot over the course of the show.

I'm curious about Dany's vision in The House of the Undying. After she put the torch on the snowy ground and looked around at the throne hall at the center of the screen we can see wooden tool. It looks like a Dreamcatcher.

1. Why it is there?
2. How that got in there? 
3. What is the purpose of this? 
4. Showrunners hidden message?

I think it could be a good hint for us, after Bran seen the same image of the throne hall in his vision.

When Joffrey goes through the Book of Brothers and talks about how Jaime's pages are empty, Jaime humbly replies that he still has time and tries to make light of the situation. Jaime was one of the greatest swordsmen of his time when he had his right hand and that was the hand that made him who he was. Unfortunately that was also the hand that labeled him the King Slayer. When Locke cut off that hand, Jaime's right hand arc ended and his left hand arc began. The hand that once made him arrogant is now gone and he must restart and rebuild with his other hand; he must relearn everything he once knew and mastered. But through this he learns of disadvantage and hardship trying to fight with his non dominant hand. It grounds him and makes him into a more understanding and well-rounded person. His relationship with Cersei which brought hatred, entitlement and lies starts to break down and he begins to see how she has affected him all of these years. I believe that when Cersei dies, at the hands of her valonqar (Jaime), Jaime will have nothing else to live for. My prediction is what a better way to redefine yourself and kill the Kingslayer name that has lived with him since he was a boy, than to become the Kingslayer; the Night Kingslayer. Jaime will sacrifice himself to kill the Night King, completing his left hand arc and writing his name in history.",32,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Definitely an absolutely incredible experience and would 10/10 recommend it for anyone even if they aren't that into the music of the show.  Show lasted about 2.5 hours with a 15 minute intermission.  Ramin Djawadi is the conductor of the orchestra during the show and also on three separate occasions he performs certain solo parts.  Almost the entire concert there are montages from the show on the big screen behind the orchestra.  This is not to mention the incredible stage design which in my opinion is on the level of some of the best shows in Vegas.

Overall this was an absolutely incredible experience and would recommend it to any fan of the show even if you aren't that big into the music.

In the beginning of the series, Magic is so rare nearly everyone West of Valyria believes it to be gone. Some doubt that it ever existed. Many characters (and viewers) believe magic returned when Daenerys emerged from a fire with three newly-hatched dragon eggs. The theory follows that their miraculous birth heralded the return of magic -- because dragons have a connection to magic and may act as a sort of magical generator. Soon after, we learn magic is growing across the known world, especially in Essos. Quiaith mentions glass candles are burning, the Warlocks in the House of the Undying have discovered their powers have returned, Alchemists can suddenly make wildfire much more efficiently, and Red Priests can bring the dead back to life.
But that doesn't mean the dragons caused the Magic.
There is some evidence that Magic did diminish around the time of the Doom. The Targaryeans created Dragonstone (prior to the Doom) using the Valyrian magic spells to liquify and mold stone; by contrast magic was not used in the (post-Doom) construction of the Red Keep.
Because magic's abrupt disappearance seems to have coincided with the Doom killing off most dragons and the birth of Dany's dragons, some assume magic comes with the dragons.
Except, the Doom of Valeria didnt kill all the dragons. The Targaryens survived the Doom with five dragons in tow. Furthermore, once the family invaded Westeros, the number of dragons grew to 18. So if three dragons were enough to rebirth magic, the additional 15 should have further increased the presence of magic. If proximity heightens the magical connection, then magic should have been stronger in Westeros over the last three hundred years than it is currently. The Targaryean dynasty should have been marked by an increasing magical presence (up to the Dance of Dragons) and Westeros should have been the center of the magical world. Instead, magic was all but unheard of in the Seven Kingdoms with some forms lingering away from these dragons, across the Narrow Sea.
Daeneryss dragons did not bring about the return of Magic, instead, their unexplained birth was merely one of the first consequences of the return of this mysterious force. Danys is merely one in a long line of Targaryeans who tried to revive petrified dragon eggs.

I havent seen this theory posted anywhere after extensive searching. So we all have heard the theory that Ned Stark may have actually gotten out of Kings Landing and that a faceless man was actually executed in his place. The reasoning for this is that jaqen h'ghar is in the dungeons at the same time as Ned: why would a faceless man be in a dungeon? And also that Varys smuggled him out. Keeping all that in mind.. I started to wonder about a scene in episode 8 in season 6 when the waif chased Arya and finally cornered her before the scene becomes dark (Arya puts the candle out) and we dont see what happens. The next thing we see is The waifs face in the hall of faces and Jaqen Hghar tell Arya that she has finally become no one. What about killing the waif made her no one? She disobeyed the many faced god by NOT killing Lady Crane and then killed the waif. How does this make her no one? The idea popped into my head that you could only truly become no one by renouncing who you identified as before. Thats my theory: what if Ned did escape the dungeon, made it to the House of Black and White with Jaqen Hghar whos ultimate test for Ned to become no one was to kill his own daughter meaning that he had completely lost who he was before. Maybe Ned was disguised as the waif, he killed Arya in that dark alley room, and what we saw was Ned wearing Aryas mask... and now jaqen Hghar could finally tell Ned that he had become no one. Then I watched more of season seven and thought if this really was Ned dressed as Arya, how does he know Aryas list because Ned wasnt around during that time, but then I went back and there is an episode in season 6 where Arya tells the waif everyone on her list... please help. I need counter arguments. Let me know what you think.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

Why would the guards at the Bloody Gate by the Eyrie allow Sandor to just walk away with Arya? And even if they would do such a thing, why would they not at least advise the remaining lords at the Eyrie of the pair's appearance, news of which should surely make it to Peter  and Sansa???

Brienne seems to be a fan favorite but I really can't understand the love for her. Here is why:

Both Arya and Sansa refuse the protection of Brienne. They barely know her and she thinks she can just demand them to go with them. When she is refused she attacks both the Hound and Littlefinger's men. It's extremely annoying to watch someone demand something while they're not in a position to do that, and than attack when they're refused.

Also, she is a complete bitch to Pod. 

She is also made too powerful in my opinion. In a world where it's extremely rare for women to wield a sword, she beats 4 of the most skilled men in all of Westeros, even though 2 are somewhat injured. It's not logical at all.

She is a very honorable person, but she is also extremely stubborn and annoying.

\- Army of the dead surrounds Winterfell, but main characters escape through underground hidden passages.

\- They seek refuge in the Vale.

\- Jon and Daenerys get attacked by the Golden Company+Euron, and are saved by Rhaegal and Drogon, where Jon will ride Rhaegal for the first time.

\- They also arrive at the Vale, while the army of the dead marches south.

\- Night King attacks King's Landing and now has two armies.

\- The first army arrives at the Isle of Faces. 

\- Jon and his army leave the Vale and attack the dead army at the Isle of Faces.

\- Arya assasinates white walkers.

\- Daenerys attacks (defends) King's Landing.

\- They do not manage to defeat the army of the dead and Bran learns what has to be done to stop them.

\- Daenerys stabs Jon's heart with dragonglass.

\- He becomes the next Night King and leads the armies of the dead north to the lands of always winter.

\- Daenerys rules Westeros together with her council.

\- Sansa is warden of the North.

\- Gendry and Arya rule Storm's end.",47,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

It's pretty disappointing the stance that Dan and David took on the final few seasons, the fact that we are getting 8 is apparently generous as they wanted to leave it at 7. Frankly, they're simply starting to sound lazy. They have been able to profit quite nicely from George's work and, at least to me, it sounds like now they're tired of making the show. 

David and Dan you agreed to tell a story now you're whinging about how long it's taking to tell it, and wahh we want to move on. 

They've already massacred the existing books by leaving out SO much information now they're going to rush to wrap it up, cool so we're just going to continue to breeze through this story, fuck you guys.

One of their lamest excuses was ""We don't think we could continue to live up to the hype"". What a joke. 

It's honestly fucking annoying, this is an incredibly detailed story and now they're just going to rush through the last six episodes. I'm sure they'll figure out a way to end this seven year build-up to the Winter of all Winters, War of all Wars in one or two episodes. Probably a Battle of the Bastards-esq episode. This epic mult-year journey we have all been on, ""yeah we're just gonna wrap this up in a couple of episodes"". Fuck you Dan and David, lazy fucks. 

If I was Dan or David I'd be ashamed of myself, for this flagrant lack of commitment.

The scene i'm wondering about is when Dany rescues the wight-hunting party from the frozen lake beyond the wall. Jon can't escape with them and falls into the water being left behind. Jon then escapes with Benjen's help before being reunited with Dany by the end of the episode.

My problem with this is that it seems entirely superfluous, the only consequence we're shown is that Benjen sacrifices himself to help Jon escape, that is the only thing that would be different compared to Jon being rescued with everyone else by Dany.

Chekhov's Gun is a narrative principle that states every part of a story has to have a purpose (if you see a gun hanging on the wall early in the story, that gun has to be fired before the end). Jon being left behind appears to serve no narrative purpose.

Therefore there are four considerations to make:

1. There is a narrative purpose that has simply gone over my head.
2. It was bad story telling, the show runners just wanted to add some inconsequential drama.
3. There is something significant to Benjen's death.
4. Something happened whilst Jon was alone that we are not yet aware of which will have consequences in season 8.

I've often suspected that Jon will not complete a traditional 'Hero's Jouney arc', he is the most traditional hero figure in a very non-traditional story and I think GRRM will look to subvert expectations for him. I therefore have a strong suspicion that point 4 has some merit, what I don't know is what the consequences of him being left behind will be. Anyone have any thoughts.  ",12,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

hey folks look at this pic

&amp;#x200B;

[coat of arms of king henry vii](https://i.redd.it/0pirkv61gsr11.png)

&amp;#x200B;

this is the coat of arms of king henry the seventh, who ruled over england after the end of the war of the roses.

as you know, game of thrones has many parallels with british isles and war of the roses.

for example, westeros looks like british isles, war of the 5 kings resembles war of the roses.

now who was this henry?? henry descended matrilinealy to house lancaster and he was a tudor.

at that time, lancasters and yorks were in deep fued and enemity. so henry married elizabeth of york and then established a new house named tudor, thus establishing peace over weseteros.. er .. british isles.

now look at his coat of arms,theres a dragon to the left, a dog/stag to the right and lion above the crown.

now we all know the symbols of corresponding houses in game of thrones.

dog/stag is baratheon, dragon is targ, lion is lannister.

while i am not saying that ending of game of thrones would be definitely by uniting the fueding houses as in war of the roses, i see a striking parallel to king henry vii in game of thrones. and even the name rhymes.

as many of you have already guessed, its gendry.

we all know gendry is a baratheon.

baratheons are targaryens as well. house baratheon founder orys was a valyrian and a rumoured targ bastard like the blackfyres. also, over the centuries 2 targ princesses had wedded into house baratheon, the last one being rhealle targaryen, the grandmother of robert baratheon. so gendry has a lot of targ blood.

also, now more and more youtubers and other game of thrones theorists and plot leak fictions are coming out and saying that gendry is the son of cersei and that, he is the trueborn son of robert and cersei and the true heir to the iron throne.

also, we all know about gendry's friendly relationship with arya.

so what if gendry actually marries a stark like arya/sansa?

then he has eventually united the 4 major houses in game of thrones logo.

and probably he can then start a new dynasty as well.

so gendry and sansa ruling together would end the family fued that plagued westeros for years and establish peace and stability to it.

also, what if gendry is actually the prince that was promised?

i guess someof you have seen the movie arthur:legend of the sword. the movie was crap, but the scene in which arthur lifted the sword from the rock and unleashed its magical powers was pretty wonderful.

i mean, are the showrunners planning to make a totally unexpected guy like gendry to touch the lightbringer sword in a desperate time and all of a sudden the sword glows red?? similar to the arthur scene??

time can tell.

also, it is also possible that gendry might adopt the child of jon and dany. ( i dont think jon and dany would survive the series)

all in all, i think such an ending would satisfy most of the supporters of various houses.

lannister supporters would be satisfied, targ and stark supporters would be satisfied and baratheon supporters would be satisified.

so guys, what do you think?? let me know in the comments section

I'm not a GoT viewer/watcher, but I am a college English instructor looking for resources that are going to appeal to my students. Next semester, I want to work with comparisons between visual and text media, so I thought GoT would be a great place to start. 

I am wondering if the community here can help me match a scene from the book with a scene from the show. Page numbers of the book and the Season/Ep# of the show would be super helpful. The season/book doesn't really matter, but the first couple of seasons would be fine for me as a novice.

Thank you in advance!

Now before I start a few things, first up I know I may be alittle late since filming has finished but better late then ever right, secondly I will only be bringing up big plot points I think will happen, things we know will most likely happen (such as Jons many reunions and Dany being pregnant) will not be mention. Finally I have NOT read any leaks for this season Nor have I looked at any set photos (though I doubt the leaks for this year are real since there are so many) I have only seen a small amount of set photos so I may combined them with my own ideas, I have also only read two leaked details, one Ill leave out because it may not seem believable (Im 50/50 on said detail though) the other I will include since it fits with a prediction I have. However other then that I have NOT read any plot leaks nor seen too many set photos so if you have to bring either one up please use spoiler tags. Also I have made a few attempts at this but I promise this is my FINAL attempt and then Ill stop I promise.

-	Edd and the remaining NW die as Beric and Tormund escape (either in battle with AOTD or NK bringing down the rest of the wall)
-	NK attacks Last Hearth, Karhold, and Bear Island (via Undead Viserion), as J&amp;D arrive to WF.
-	The Northerners give Jon smack for bending the knee, with Sansa and even Arya not being happy with Jon.
-	Cersei has a miscarriage and grows more mad and Paranoid, Euron arrives with the GC (and maybe Daario and the Second Sons though I sadly doubt that will happen at this point) and Cersei sends them on one last task before Euron can marry him.
-	Euron (on his way North) gets attacked by Theon and his ships, Theon saves Yara and heads North being led to believe Euron is dead.
-	Jon learns the truth via Bran, Sam, and Howland Reed (if Howland even shows up which idk if itll happen at this point either) and Jon reveals it to Stark sisters and Dany, Right before Dany can tell him some news the horn goes off.
-	Oh forgot to mention Arya and Gendry reunite and have some bonding scenes.
-	First battle against AOTD is North, Euron (whos revealed to have survived), Harry, and the GC surprise attack WF setting it aflame, Theon sacrifices himself killing Euron to defend Sansa.
-	Mel does something epic to help defend off the NK before dying at the NKs hands, Gendry dies but Beric gives him the kiss of Life, Tormund, Yohn Royce, Ghost, and most of the Northern lords also die in the first battle.
-	To end the bloodshed either Jon and/or Sansa are taken hostage by the GC (Varys accompanies the GC), Everyone falls back as the AOTD reaches WF. Jaime, Bronn, and Edmure arrive with an army made up of 300 Sellswords and Frey/Tully Bannermen to help hold off the AOTD long enough for everyone to escape, Jaime sacrifices himself saving Bran AND Arya and dies in Briennes arms up North.
-	Jon and/or Sansa convince Harry Strickland and the GC to change sides with Varys help and they send a Raven to everybody now at Riverrun.
-	Tyrion organizes a rescue mission consisting of Arya, Sandor, Pod, and Brienne to save Jon and/or Sansa and kill Cersei.
-	Varys and Harry free Jon and/or Sansa, and Arya kills Cersei by forcing the strangler down her pale white throat, Qyburn to save his own skin pretends to also change sides.
-	Everyone meets in the Dragonspit where Bran reveals the NKs backstory and identity and the WWs backstory and that they are not just monsters and there is a reason for what they are doing (which could tie in to the symbols they make in earlier seasons).
-	He also reveals Rhaegar is Azor Ahai Reborn and Jon is the embodiment of Lightbringer, before the battle though Dany goes into labour and survives childbirth to twins.
-	NK on Viserion fights off against Dany on Drogon and Jon on Rhaegal.
-	Its revealed not only is there wildfire under red keep which if set off will cause a chain reaction and blow up areas of the city but also Varys betrayed J&amp;D and co. deciding is not a good fit for queen after field of fire and Qyburn is working with Varys.
-	CLEGANEBOWL, Sandor wins but dies not long after too blood lose.
-	Arya and Gendry will evacuate as many citizens as they can through the sewers of KL, also at some point is almost killed by a white walker but Sansa sacrifices herself saving Arya (paralleling Lady and Nymeria).
-	Varys sets off wildfire under certain areas of KL killing a good amount of Wights and citizens but also Yara, Grey Worm, Jorah, Harry Strickland, Bronn, and Edmure.
-	NK and Viserion kill Dany and Drogon in combat, Rhaegal dies killing Viserion and Jon and NK land in either Dragonspit or the Gods eye. Jon and NK will 1v1 but Bran will have a battle of the minds with him weakening the NK, Jon with help from Sam removes the Dragonglass from his chest making the NK die a mortal man, all the wights collapse and WWs turn back to human.
-	Varys is put on trial for his crimes and his sentence is carried out be either Jon or Arya.
-	The Throne is melted down and each of the Seven Kingdoms are made independent kingdoms. Tyrion rules the Westerlands, Roslin rules the Riverlands until her son with Edmure comes of age, Robin rules the Vale, Sam and Gilly rule the Reach, new houses rule Stormlands and Iron islands, A more likeable Sand Snake is given Dorne, Bran leaves with the now turned human WWs beyond the former wall, and Jon is offered KL but declines it and goes home to rule the North, either Arya and Gendry are given KL or they sail West of Westeros and KL is given to a new character introduced in S8 who proves him or herself to be a man or woman of the people.
-	Jon raises his twin children as Ned did for him on his own and Sam writes the song of Ice and fire. Bittersweet ending is Westeros is saved but at what cost as Westeros is left in ruin and Jons lost yet another lover. 
-	Qyburn has fled Westeros and is never heard from again, He is presumed dead.",16,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

So burning dead bodies is a way to prevent the white walkers to acquire enuf to plug it. If the White walkers were pushed back n not able to do it, I'd make sense they would build an ice wall to prevent destruction from the volcano erupting, harming them.

975,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-10-16,2018,10,16,1,9oe3uk,self.gameofthrones,All the hints that point at Tyrions betrayal. Im I missing any? (Potential Spoilers),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/9oe3uk/all_the_hints_that_point_at_tyrions_betrayal_im_i/,Kamehameha_highway,1539620199,"- The first hint the show gives us is when Tyrion convinces Daenerys to leave Daario behind, justifying it with that she cant have any distractions. But was it jealousy? Or perhaps he doesnt want anyone else to put ideas on Daenerys head. This might be why he had that look on the boat scene. 

- Secondly, when Daenerys threatens Varys with execution if he betrays her, this may be foreshadowing that someone will be executed later in the show.

- Third, when he asks her about a successor (after getting rid of Daario), could his intent be to offer himself since he comes from sort of royal lineage?

- Fourth, resentment to everyone because he has been undermined every time he had a position of power. Like in the battle against Stannis, where nobody acknowledged his role in being the key player to win the battle. This seems to be happening again with all the mistakes he made that lost them Yaras, Olennas and the Martells armies. He is losing trust when it comes to decision making, and with Jons presence, Daenerys has someone elses opinion she values more. An example is when they had the discussion to go by boat together with Jon, Tyrion was against it but she chose to go with Jons recommendation. 

- Fifth reason is the meeting with Cersei. This made it pretty obvious that Tyrion will betray Daenerys later in the show. 

- Sixth is the boat scene, I think his facial expression signifies that he was worried about the decision he needs to make. And that his decision is going to go against his moral values. 

The first two episodes will probably have a few more situations were Tyrion gets undermined and his anger / jealousy builds up even more, making his decision to betray Daenerys clearer since he is still in the fence at this point. 

As I mentioned in a possible leak info I got, looks like Tyrion will kill Varys cause he will find out what he is up to. Jaime will screw him by telling Jon and Daenerys about Cerseis backstabbing them and then Bran will give us a vision of what was said in that meeting. Tyrion will be arrested most of the season, from episode 3 till he gets executed. He does escape and tries to burn everyone with wild fire but is discovered by Sansa who has learned all of Littlefingers lying detection instincts. Tyrion will help defeating the NK by finding, together with Sam, information about the past. But this was all a plan to stall so he can escape and light up Kings Landing on fire with Cerseis wildfire. 

Let me know if there are other hints at his betrayal I may have missed, but I think that rewatching the show a few times has made it clear to me that this is the direction the show is heading. ",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

A Golden Crown

Alright, we are more than halfway through season one, and things are starting to get really interesting.  Daenerys eats a horses heart. Tyrion has a life or death trial. Brandon was attacked in the woods. Oh my! How did all of this change the list this week? The most surprising change is how Tyrion and Khal Drogo are beginning to win favor in Andreas heart. Lets get to the list.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Daenerys Targaryen (Last week 3)** Daenerys returns to the number one spot after falling all the way down to the number three spot last week. I suppose consuming a horses heart gives you strength. She is strong, focused, and noble.

2.**Arya Stark (Last week 1)**

There is nothing new to say about Arya. She still will roll her eyes at the mention of Joffrey and she learned what to say to the god of death. But, room had to made for Daenerys at the top, so Arya drops to the number two spot on the list.

3.**Ned Stark (Last week 2)**

Ned had climbed two spots last week. This week he falls one spot, and land at the number three position. Ned is very noble and makes good decisions. Andrea liked the way he gave the decree to get rid of the Mountain, and for the way he called for Tywin to come to Kings Landing.

4.**Jon Snow (Last week 4)**

Wow, Jon didnt move at all this week. He remains at the number four spot, with the same three people ahead of him. Its actually pretty impressive feat considering Jon wasnt in the show this week. 

5.**Catelyn Stark (Last week 7)**

There was a little bit of disappointment in Cat this week. She accused Tyrion and she knows hes not a bad guy. She appeared to be a little bit spineless because she allowed the farce of a trial to take place. Despite this, she jumps two spots to fifth spot this week. Howd that happen? 

6.**Tyrion Lannister (Last week 8)**

Tyrion was able to get himself out of the Sky Cell that he was being held in, and is now a free man. He is showing himself to be a crafty survivor. He is not what he started out looking like. He is not a bad person. Thus, he continues to rise on the list. This week he jumps two more spots to the number six spot. I wonder how long before he reaches number one. 

7.**Bronn (Last week  not rated)**

Welcome to the list, Bronn. You were able to defeat a very impressive fighter in a trial by combat. You may not have fought with honor, but you lived. Congratulations on being considered a good guy with character. It helps that you stood up for Tyrion. 

8.**Khal Drogo (Last week 11)**

It was impressive the way that Drogo killed Viserys. He was smart in not drawing blood, and giving Viserys exactly what he asked for. He stood up for his wife. Hes not just a savage after all. 

9.**Jorah Mormont (Last week 10)**

Moving up one spot on the list is Jorah Mormont. He showed good character by standing up to Viserys and not letting him leave with the dragon eggs. Jorah lands at the number nine spot.

10.**Robb Stark** **(Last week not ranked)**

To be fair, I think Robb only got on the list because I asked Andrea about him. But, he protected Bran in the woods, so he is on the liked end of the list. There are a lot of characters that are liked and Robb made the top ten.

11.**Loras Tyrell (Last week 5)**

This week, I asked Andrea if she liked or disliked the characters as well as getting the order for the list. Loras Tyrell was the last character that Andrea said that she liked. Loras wasnt in the show this week, but stayed on the list from last week.

12.**Theon Greyjoy (Last week  not ranked)**

Theon may have saved Robb and Bran with an arrow through the heart of one of Brans attackers, but he is also pushing Robb to call his banners and go to war. Theon lands on the list at the number twelve spot, and is the first of the characters that Andrea feels neutral about.

13.**Samuel Tarley (Last week 9)**

Dropping four spots is Samuel Tarley. He wasnt in the show, and when your dont get screen time, you lose spots on the list.

14.**Petyr Baelish (Last week 6)**

Can you think of any reason why the Lannisters might have for being angry with your wife? Really? Petyr falls to the number fourteen spot this week.

15.**Brandon Stark (Last week 13)**

Bran may have enjoyed his time in the saddle, but nothing new can be said about him. He falls two spots this week.

16.**Sansa Stark (Last week 14)**

Sansa is just a simpering teenage girl. Joffrey shows her an ounce of affection and she is ready to forgive everything. Yep, Sansa falls two spots on the list this week.

17.**Lord Varys (Last week 15)**

Also dropping two spots is Lord Varys. Maybe his little birds can help him figure out how to climb on the list next week.

18.**The Hound (Last week 16)**

We are now moving into the realm of characters that just are not liked. Everyone one from here on down in the list has a negative feeling in Andreas mind. The Hound just happens to be least disliked. 

19.**Robert Baratheon (Last week 18)**

Even though Robert is liked by Ned, he is not liked by Andrea. Anyone that hits a woman (no matter how evil she is) is not going to be high on this list. This week Robert hit Cersei. And even though he felt badly about it, he still hit her.

20.**Joffrey Baratheon (Last week 19)**

You have to wonder what Joffrey is up to by being nice to Sansa. Sansa should be suspicious of his 180 degree turn. Andrea is.

21.**Robin Arryn(Last week 18)**

Robin is a dangerous little fool. He is not unlike Joffrey. Both were ruined by their mother. Robin is just too fascinated with the Moon Door.

22.**Lysa Arryn (Last week  not ranked)**

Welcome to the list Lysa. Since you appear to be demented you are not liked, and you land near the bottom of the list at the number twenty two spot. It should be noted that last week only had twenty two spots. The prevailing thought is that you have been up in the altitude too long.

&amp;#x200B;

23.**The Mountain (Last week 17)**

This week Ned put a price on The Mountains head. Good! He drops six spots on this list, with only Cersei and Jamie below him. Really, thats about as low as you can go.

&amp;#x200B;

24.**Cersei Lannister (Last week 20)**

25.**Jamie Lannister(Last week 22)**

What can we say about Cersei and Jamie? They are evil. The stay at the bottom of the list. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The DEAD:**

**Viserys Targaryen**, thank god he died. He got what he deserved. Its not often that you get what you ask for and what you deserve.

**Vardis Egen**, he fought with honor. He seemed like he was going to be a strong character, but he didnt last long. He had to die so that Tyrion could live.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Well, thats the list. Last week I said that the number of characters what getting up there. This week there is even more characters. I think GRRM needs to start killing off characters quicker. :) Let me know your thoughts in the comments. Thanks for reading.",5,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

If you're anything like myself, you've exhausted Sporcle's reserves of decent Game of Thrones quizzes. But you're in luck! While we do dearly love our Reddit chat, we also run bi-weekly trivia over [on our Discord.](https://discord.gg/gameofthrones)

We have a reserve of more than 1000 original questions we've come up with  and while we run random trivias using those old questions, we have new ones for the bi-weekly events. Sometimes, such as this weekend, you can even win an actual, real prize.

So, we'd love to see you come along, 10pm UTC, Saturday, to take part (that's 11pm in Britain, 6pm EDT and 3pm PTC)! [Again, here's a link to join the discord.](https://discord.gg/gameofthrones)

ps. Questions vary in difficulty, they are mainly based on the show+lore, but from time to time, a book-specific one is thrown in.

This category, to me, includes characters like Bronn and Podrick. I have a ton of ideas about Bronn. I dont believe that he is just some random sellsword who just so happened to be at the right place and right time to offer his services. A few things that make me question his back story 
1. He speaks like he is highborn. My lord instead of mlord
2. He is on record saying hes been north of the wall before. 
3. For being a sellsword hes very well versed in battle, organized, structured, open-field style battle. 
4. He seems to have a northern accent. 

I believe that were in for a surprise with Bronn. What are some theories you all have? Use your imagination and have fun with it.

[*""Members of the Targaryen bloodline were known to frequently experience prophetic dreams""*](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Greensight)


Keep in mind that these prophecies are the reason that the Targaryens were the last of the dragon houses. They saw the end of Valeria and retreated in time to save their family.


Aerys II Targaryen was initially a good king who showed great promise and seemed to care for his subjects. At some point he snapped and started burning people alive. He stashed wildfire under most of king's landing, presumed to be used to burn the inhabitants of the city.


I propose that he did not do so of evil intent nor for mere amusement. Instead i ask, ""What caused his madness?""


My answer to this is that he saw the rise of the night king. He watched in his dreams as his beloved country was turned into a barren wasteland and his countrymen was turned into ghouls and zombies. He became convinced that the only way to stop this monster was to burn those who would inevitably be turned into undead monsters. Eventually the night king would come to king's landing, and that is why he stashed wildfire underneath the city. It was his contingency against the night king.

It became a meme about little Rickon and his ""obvious"" stupidity when he just ran from Ramsay arrows in straight line instead of figure out Apocalytpo-style zig-zag dodging maneuver. But...

It was Ramsay little game, and many previous episodes before Battle of the Bastards, he showed many of his games he played with. Every time, his victims was assured of their little chance of surviving, but still a chance. But every time someone played smart, Ramsay just unleashed his dogs or tricked them into traps. That's how Ramsay's games end like. We had enough time to get to know this mad dog.

Well this apply to Rickon situation as well. You think that kid would outsmart him by just side stepping and dodging. Maybe your experience is taken from Apocalypto movie scene, and if it is, it should be pointed out that there was 2 runners and IIRC 2 shooters. And that is whole different story.

So let's take a guess. How many archers stood behind Ramsay in that battle? A hundred? A two hundreds? Maybe more? Anyway if only Ramsay would notice that Rickon is playing smart, what do you, experts, think he could do next? I think he could just command his archers to nock, draw, loose. Game over. The kid could dodge Ramsay arrows pretty much easily, but he just couldn't dodge hundreds of them. Not enough? He could send his horsemen to chase him and stuff him on their lances. He could even chase him by himself and behead him with his sword. Or he could just let the little Stark run away, as he was assured of his victory anyway.

And here you are. The ""experts"". Mocking little Stark for probably the smartest thing he could do in that situation. It is a way better to dodge shots of only one bow than a hundreds of them. To not provoke the sadistic bastard to bring up entire artillery and for the most, to run as fast as he possibly can from thousands (!) of enemies straight to safety. And he already did avoid 3 arrows and got shot by the 4th of them, when distance became more of a disadvantage for Ramsay, and the shot was mostly just ""lucky"".

No one would have died in a Rebellion if Brandon was never lied to, he wouldnt have gone to KL for any other reason. So yes, the rebellion WAS started on a lie, it never would have started if Brandon wasnt lied to because he wouldnt have gone to KL and wouldnt have gotten himself killed, and Averys wouldnt have threatened Ned and Robert and thus the rebellion would not have lived.

The reason for a betrayal of Dany would have to be serious...he would have to believe in something strongly and also have to believe Dany had crossed some moral line. If not outright betrayal then a serious falling out.


It doesn't matter whether the baby is real or a ruse. One, Tyrion *believes* Cersei is carrying his nephew/niece. Two, Tyrion firmly *believes* that Cersei will do anything for her children, her 2nd redeeming characteristic. Three, Tyrion sincerely believes he failed his dead nieces and nephew.


So he believes Cersei agreed to a deal because of the baby: the scene cut away dramatically when Tyrion learned that Cersei was pregnant. We don't know what was discussed but we know the very next scene is them entering the Pit to make the deal. So there's clearly a connection of some sort.


How precisely does it go down, scene by scene? No idea.


The big picture, I think, is that Tyrion will believe he's doing the right thing.


Dany, in an ironic reversal and echo of history, will play the role of Tywin or Robert Baratheon - her hatred of Cersei will drive her to kill the innocent child (born or unborn). Tyrion, Ned Stark-like, will be driven to protect the innocent. Dany will execute him.

And rightly so. I love it to; seeing different characters work the shadows or work their way up in shady circumstances causes outrage, respect, and a WHOLE lot of dedicated followers of the show. It's one of the things that got me into the show, no doubt, but it was NEVER the point...

&amp;#x200B;

In the game of thrones, you win or you die, right? Well that's great and all, but i still laugh when I see people complaining about this show taking a fantasy spin on it (i.e. dragons, the AOTD, magic) and moving away from the politics and power grabs and what not. The very first scene of this show was about the return of the white walkers...why the hell else would it start as such? To prove that the game of thrones between men and women is completely irrelevant compared to what is coming.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, i get that people loved the politics and schemes and shit. But that was to always play second fiddle to the first dragons in centuries, the incoming horde hellbent on wrecking all of humanity and prophecies of princes. It just was. Was Season 7, the one with the least amount of scheming, the best of the seasons? By just storyline, no, it wasn't, but i loved the theatrical portion of it. The visuals were breathtaking. This entire argument about fantasy vs politics (which, by the way, can go together...) all comes to head about Littlefinger. How he was consistently beating people at the GOT and then lost to Sansa and was killed because there's no more use for him. Yeah, that's the point. That the Iron Throne is no longer important. The only person who doesn't see that is Cersei, and she's batshit crazy anyway. Plus, she's already killed half of Westeros, so again, the throne is irrelevant.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR That's a semi-rant, but my point being this was always a fantasy show that was dominated by politics to move pieces into play. But, it was always about the war between the living and the dead, and everything else was foreplay. ",34,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

In Season One, and only in Season One thus far to my knowledge, the story of Cersei's firstborn - a boy born of Robert, as evidenced by their black hair, died shortly after birth from some sort of illness. This story is counteracted later in Season One when Cersei claims she managed to always finish off Robert in ""other ways"". Even in A Song of Ice and Fire, though she is impregnated with Robert's kin at one point, she performs and abortion to get rid of it.
To further confuse matters, the Witch's prophecy clearly stated that Cersei would only have THREE children. Not four. And yet, if the show's events are considered, this is not true. Cersei couldn't have been lying about this story in her first encounter explaining it to Catelyn, as in a later scene in Season One Robert talks about it with her.
This is clearly a series of fallacies created by the addition of Cersei's ""firstborn"" plotline in the show, unless I'm missing something. Because as it stands, the Witch sucks at fortune telling, and either Cersei's implied outward apathy at the death of her final son due to her expectation of the prophecy's validity was misconstrued or it was all a lie and Robert is a psychopath.",12,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

A point of contention about this story beat is how Olenna could have been surprised by the Lannister troops - an entire army walking into her land. Since day one I've, personally, disagreed with this point on the basis that a) the Reach is torn between loyalties and grudges (especially with House Tarly now the unofficial Great House of the Reach), and b) it isn't a stretch to believe they avoided major holdfasts, towns, and pulled a Theon by having those [Tarly archers](https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2017/06/21/got-trailer/GOT7222-archers.nocrop.w710.h2147483647.2x.jpg) take out any ravens flying toward Highgarden. 

However, re-watching the scene and taking a look at [a map](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/8/89/The_Reach.png/revision/latest?cb=20120719200419) reveals something interesting about the landscape. 

As you can see on the map, Highgarden is situated south of a tri-fork river. What's more is south of that is Horn Hill, and the land the Tarlys rule, settled between three rivers that are all trickling in from the Sunset Sea. 

If you watch the scenery closely, you see at 0:29 and the very bottom of 0:54, the Mander - this great river of the Reach. 

Without a doubt, the Lannister and Tarly armies marched from the *south,* not the north, and wisely ambushed the remaining Tyrells where they were blind: where the Lannisters met with the Tarlys on their turf and marched from there. 

I'd say this should put criticism of this story beat to rest, don't you think? ",10,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

1249,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-10-20,2018,10,20,2,9plzu0,self.gameofthrones,[Spoilers] The Khal Drogo prophecy,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/9plzu0/spoilers_the_khal_drogo_prophecy/,kinvore,1539970237,"AKA the Mirri Maz Duur prophecy, it has been the source of speculation for some time now. I know of the most popular take on it that's been shared all over, but I have my own take that I wanted to share. Unlike the most popular theories, mine doesn't fill in all the gaps yet because I don't think we're going to see the rest of the prophecy elements until the final season (and/or the last books).

Now before I get into specifics, I'd like to go over my reasoning behind it all. First and foremost, I think all elements will need to be both in the books AND the series. For instance, the red comet is mentioned in both even though it doesn't appear to have any meaning that's affected the rest of the story. Why would Martin insist on this detail being in the show unless it was an important detail?

As an aspiring author myself I understand the desire to have as much as the book as possible to be present in other media, but details such as these strike me as unnecessary, unless they're not.

And yes, I know the comet is also part of the Azor Ahai prophecy (""The Prince that was Promised""), but bear with me here...

Secondly, I don't want to operate under the assumption that we've been given all of the elements of the prophecy yet. Maybe we have, but it's not too late to bring in at least one or two more.

Third of all, and to me this is the biggest indicator that it is an actual prophecy, I can't help but note that Jason Momoa ""visited"" the set as they filmed the final season. He tried to downplay it but I have little doubt that he's going to appear in season 8. Maybe it'll just be a dream sequence, but I'm fairly certain that it's going to be for the fulfillment of the prophecy.

Okay, on to specifics.  First let me quote the prophecy:

&gt;""When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east. When the seas go dry and the mountains blow in the wind like leaves. When  your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child. Then he will return, and not before."" 

**1. When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east.** I think this is in reference to the red comet. It was shown early in the books/series, and hasn't been mentioned much again since then, but I think whatever planet they're on is about to get a LOT closer in orbit to the comet.

Now here's what I'm imagining. They're in the midst of the great war during the Long Night. Because there's no sun, the Night King is more powerful than ever and our heroes are falling to him left and right. It's looking grim, and maybe there's a last-ditch effort to stop him but it requires light to make it work.

Lo and behold, BOOM the comet suddenly shoots across the sky, west to east, lighting everything up.

**2. When the seas go dry and the mountains blow in the wind like leaves.** I don't think it's a coincidence that these are put in the same sentence. They're often treated as separate events but I think they have to be related.

This is admittedly the weakest part of my theory, and why I speculate that we haven't been given all elements of the prophecy yet. My best guess is that the comet won't just fly by, it'll actually land somewhere. The resulting impact could easily level mountains and evaporate seas.

Or it could be referring to something we haven't seen yet. Or it could be in reference to a volcano near the sea. Dragonstone is supposed to be a volcanic island, perhaps it erupts?

**3. When your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child. Then he will return, and not before.** It's seems pretty clear that this means Danaerys will have a child again, probably Jon Snow's unless we've been thrown a major curve ball. She will bear a LIVING child, and Drogo will return after she does.

So this tells me that whatever this last great battle may be, it's not going to happen until nearly a year (or more) after the end of season 7, when Danaerys and Jon (I know that's not his ""real"" name but I'm trying to keep this simple) finally do the nasty.

Then we're left with the actual nature of his return. I hope it's not something lame like a dream sequence, but will he physically be present? Will he save the day by direct combat or will he distract the enemy long enough for the heroes to gain advantage?

I imagine what people will dislike the most about my take on this is that it introduces sci-fi elements to a fantasy story but that's pretty much WHY I like it. Thanks for hearing me out, me and my shit ramblings.",14,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

If theres one thing we know within the show and from GRRM himself, its that prophecy is a bit taboo and that it generally becomes self fulfilling through fear and superstition. The red comet never ended up being much more than a comet. Cerseis childrens deaths were all arguably as a result of her fear of her childrens deaths. Danys trust in blood magic really just got her husband a nasty, infected, necrotized wound. Stannis sacrifices his daughter and still loses at Winterfell. 
I think there will certainly be aspects and parallels that fit Azor Ahai, but I think these will cross, and have been crossing, several characters while none of them truly fulfilling the prophecy itself. For instance, Jon was resurrected, Sandor is having visions, and I believe Jaime will temper his sword in the bosom of his lover. 
Jaime has had, arguably, some of the deepest and most intense character development in the series. Id also argue hes one of the most honorable characters in the series, despite his prickish attitude early on. Once we learn his side of the story of the Mad King, its easy to see a misunderstood and hardened character. He was judged before anyone knew him for breaking his vows, when in fact he saved the entire city by doing so. His friendship with Brienne, the first person to see through the Kingslayer exterior, softened him and opened his eyes to the honorable man he was unaware still existed. He killed Aerys II because it was the right thing to do. He went back and rescued Brienne because it was the right thing to do. He broke his brother out of prison because it was the right thing to do. 
Cerseis prophecy also mentions she will die at the hand of her younger brother (the whole Jaime kills her thing isnt news). 
&gt; And when your tears have drowned you, the Valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you.""
Going back to my thoughts on prophecy from before, I read this as quite a bit more figurative than its written. 
My guess is that either to save the city once again, or by extension to save humanity as a whole, Jaime will be the one to kill Cersei by running a sword through her back. This will not only fall in line with Cersei creating her own demise, but it also fulfills Jaimes portion of the Azor Ahai prophecy, tempering his sword in the heart of a lioness AND his lover, while also bringing Jaimes arc full circle by being a Westerosi savior, a Queenslayer, this time lauded for his actions, and a true Prince that was Promised.

I've watched all the seasons of the show. One of the things that I have found very interesting is that at least half the Stark kids are skin changers--- Jon, Arya, and Bran. 
Now the books do not have any stand alone chapters on Rob or Rickon, and I know that Sansa's wolf was killed early on. 
In book five, while Bran is in the North with the children, it talks about how skin changers are a gift, and that having the gift of the third eye is even more rare. 
My theory is that all of the Stark children are skin changers, even though we do not actually get to see it. This is based on the deep connection that is mention directly or indirectly by themselves or other characters.
The other part of my theory is that being a skin changer is a normal trait that runs through the Stark blood, which is why Ned Stark thinks its so important that all of the children keep their wolves close. 
My theory continues that perhaps, this is why some of the Targaryns were able to connect with dragons, because they can also slip their skin.

Right before this we see Jon pull himself out of a freezing lake after having been submerged for at least a couple minutes and covered in now soaking wet furs.

By any stretch of logic he should be frozen to death.  Some might say that the lord of light, being a fire god having brought Jon back imbues him with some sort of resistance to cold or extra worm body.

I think actually that Jon unknowignly did exactly what Danny did with the Khals in Vias Dothrak when she burned them to death and she survived the fire.

I think that when Jon lead people into the north and some of them died (Thoros dies during the night perhaps due to the cold specifically), in the same way the deaths of that one witch in season 1 and the Khals in season 6 made Danny temporarily immune to fire because of blood magic, Jon was made temporarily immune to cold because of a similar type of blood magic.

I think it was easily the strongest episode of the season. 

The episode felt more like classic GoT, more focused on dialogue than mindless action.

We got a lot of memorable stuff like the Dragon pit interactions, Tyrion finally shining again, Jon forgiving Theon, Jaimie finally leaving Cersei &amp; of course legendary boatsex and the wall coming down

And while the Winterfell story was messy this season, the conclusion was quite good and fitting.

 Least favourite would be Beyond the wall, the whole wight hunt plot was ridiculous &amp; badly executed.",0,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Guys and Gals, fellow redditors and subscribers of r/gameofthrones, book readers, show watchers, podcast listeners, OC producers and reposters of memes (I think that covers everyone). I've lurked for years on Reddit, and this will be my first post ever. I've spent countless hours scrolling through this subreddit, reading fan theories in the off seasons, listening to GoT podcasts breaking down each episode, gazing at stunning original artwork, watching the amazingly voiced and still-animation History and Lore videos on YouTube, getting super pumped when I get a notification saying that Alt Shift X has posted a new video, and just watching this amazing show with some of my best friends over the course of the show's run (S1E1 aired on April 17th, 2011?!? wut?). Just super excited to see how this Song of Ice and Fire show will all come to an end sometime next year. I'll end this stupid intro by saying that this subreddit has given me the chance to delve deeper into this incredibly deep and detailed world that George R. R. Martin has built, all while getting some great laughs with everyone's memes and hyping for the clearly foreshadowed and eventual CleganeBowl (que airhorns, trumpets and John Cena intro - All aboard the hype train!).

&amp;#x200B;

I have created some mashups in Youtube Doubler of some memorable scenes from the show, pairing them with an appropriate audio track from the critically acclaimed and salty Super Smash Bros. Melee for the Nintendo GameCube, a favorite of mine and many. Along with fond memories of the game soundtrack, I found the unique orchestral pieces really got me hyped on the moments and weight of each scene (crescendo-ing at just the right moment sometimes - more than I expected!).

&amp;#x200B;

Credit to those who uploaded the videos I ended up linking together - you can click the orange bar with the title to go directly to the uploaded video I used - looks like shoutouts to GilvaSunner, KidWave1990, BrawlBRSTMs3 X, Nour, Ryan Razor1911, and the Game of Thrones Official Channel with the opening credits scene. Giving credit where credit is due. Also, I didn't know whether or not to mark this post as OC, given I do not own rights to anything, nor created anything of value. I just mashed some cool stuff together, and thought you guys would enjoy it.

&amp;#x200B;

**P.S.** \- **For best viewing pleasure**, have the GoT scene at a lower volume, but loud enough to hear swords clanging, dragon fire, screaming, etc. The Tower of Joy / Fountain of Dreams scene I found could be turned up more than the others.

Melee **vs.** Game of Thrones S06E09 beginning of episode- Masters Attacking Meereen \[original footage\] by VJ Marketman12 \- **Favorite part:** How the musical selection reminds me of the Great Fox cruising through the Venom stage / Drogon through Meereen. Doesn't end on a high point, but I still felt it enjoyable for the 9+ minutes.

Melee Music Extended **vs.** THE BATTLE OF THE LOOT TRAIN ""FIELD OF FIRE"" (GoT S7E04) by VJ Marketman12 \- **Favorite parts:** The many heroic charges, as well as Drogon's massive destruction, and even the 1st arrow volley/ballista reveal/Drogon's hit and descent/landing, all end up lining up with the same recurring musical themes as it repeats throughout the 9+ minutes - really happy with how this one came out!

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks again for reading and watching - I really appreciate this subreddit and the Game of Thrones community as a whole. It's been a wild 7 seasons so far - hope that D&amp;D have one more good one in 'em. Looking forward to all of your awesome posts and discussions here on the subreddit in the coming year. Here's to hoping you guys and gals enjoyed the idea I had! Let me know what you think!

&amp;#x200B;

I wish you good fortune in the wars to come.

It was mentioned by Viserys (Daenerys brother) that the dragon must always have 3 heads - her, her brother who died and himself. We found out that he was not one of the dragons and that Jon is, so who is the 3rd dragon??? My theory is that it is Tyrion Lannister. Almost all the mothers who bore Targeryns who arent Targeryn themself (not born of incest) usually die, (Jons mother), and that is how Tyrions mother died. In one episode Tywin mentions that The Mad King rode to Casterly Rock, (where I assume is where he either raped or had sex with Tyrions mother). This theory is also based on the fact that the dragons are tame around Tyrion (like Daenerys and Jon).",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

So to start, in the show it was HEAVILY implied that Jon Snow is actually Lyanna Starks child with Rhaegar Targaryen and he isnt a bastard due to their elopement. Its also been implied with the book and the show that the Targaryens have children within their own bloodlines to keep the blood pure. What Im trying to say is that, when Jon and Daenarys has sex, her possibility of getting pregnant could be high. Which means there will be a birth of another dragon rider BUT since Jon was brought back by the Gods with the help of the red woman, would that baby possibly become the bridge of connection between the white walkers and the ice dragon?

But I realised what the rules are now so here it is again, changed to remove the thing I mentioned that got it removed in the first place.

-	Edd and the remaining NW die as Beric and Tormund escape (either in battle with AOTD or NK bringing down the rest of the wall)
-	NK attacks Last Hearth, Karhold, and Bear Island (via Undead Viserion), as J&amp;D arrive to WF.
-	The Northerners give Jon smack for bending the knee, with Sansa and even Arya not being happy with Jon.
-	Cersei has a miscarriage and grows more mad and Paranoid.
-	Euron on his way to KL after getting the Golden Company (and maybe Daario and Second Sons are there but I doubt that will happen at this point) gets attacked by Theon and his ships, Theon saves Yara and heads North being led to believe Euron is dead. Its revealed later he survived and decides to take the GC still standing (which is a lot) and head North after Theon.
-	Jon learns the truth via Bran, Sam, and Howland Reed (if Howland even shows up which idk if itll happen at this point either) and Jon reveals it to Stark sisters and Dany, Right before Dany can tell him some news the horn goes off.
-	Oh forgot to mention Arya and Gendry reunite and have some bonding scenes.
-	First battle against AOTD is North, Euron (whos revealed to have survived), Harry, and the GC surprise attack WF setting it aflame, Theon sacrifices himself killing Euron to defend Sansa.
-	Mel does something epic to help defend off the NK before dying at the NKs hands, Gendry dies but Beric gives him the kiss of Life, Tormund, Yohn Royce, Ghost, and most of the Northern lords also die in the first battle.
-	To end the bloodshed either Jon and/or Sansa are taken hostage by the GC (Varys accompanies the GC), Everyone falls back as the AOTD reaches WF. Jaime, Bronn, and Edmure arrive with an army made up of 300 Sellswords and Frey/Tully Bannermen to help hold off the AOTD long enough for everyone to escape, Edmure dies in the process but Jaime, Bronn, and the Frey/Tully forces join the others who escaped.
-	Jon and/or Sansa convince Harry Strickland and the GC to change sides with Varys help and they send a Raven to everybody now at Riverrun.
-	Tyrion organizes a rescue mission consisting of Arya, Sandor, Pod, Jaime, and Brienne to save Jon and/or Sansa and kill Cersei.
-	Varys and Harry free Jon and/or Sansa, and Jaime kills Cersei by stabbing Widows Wail through her pale white throat, Qyburn to save his own skin pretends to also change sides.
-	Everyone meets in the Dragonspit where Bran reveals the NKs backstory and identity and the WWs backstory and that they are not just monsters and there is a reason for what they are doing (which could tie in to the symbols they make in earlier seasons).
-	He also reveals Rhaegar is Azor Ahai Reborn and Jon is the embodiment of Lightbringer, before the battle though Dany goes into labour and survives childbirth to twins.
-	NK on Viserion fights off against Dany on Drogon and Jon on Rhaegal.
-	Its revealed not only is there wildfire under red keep which if set off will cause a chain reaction and blow up areas of the city but also Varys betrayed J&amp;D and co. deciding is not a good fit for queen after field of fire and Qyburn is working with Varys.
-	CLEGANEBOWL, Sandor wins but dies not long after too blood lose.
-	Arya and Gendry will evacuate as many citizens as they can through the sewers of KL, also at some point is almost killed by a white walker but Sansa sacrifices herself saving Arya (paralleling Lady and Nymeria). Jaime and Brienne will also defend Bran and Arya, Jaime dies sacrificing himself to save the boy he pushed out the tower all those years ago and the boys sister.
-	Varys sets off wildfire under certain areas of KL killing a good amount of Wights and citizens but also Yara, Grey Worm, Jorah, Harry Strickland, Bronn, and Edmure.
-	NK and Viserion kill Dany and Drogon in combat, Rhaegal dies killing Viserion and Jon and NK land in either Dragonspit or the Gods eye. Jon and NK will 1v1 but Bran will have a battle of the minds with him weakening the NK, Jon with help from Sam removes the Dragonglass from his chest making the NK die a mortal man, all the wights collapse and WWs turn back to human.
-	Varys is put on trial for his crimes and his sentence is carried out be either Jon or Arya.
-	The Throne is melted down and each of the Seven Kingdoms are made independent kingdoms. Tyrion rules the Westerlands, Roslin rules the Riverlands until her son with Edmure comes of age, Robin rules the Vale, Sam and Gilly rule the Reach, new houses rule Stormlands and Iron islands, A more likeable Sand Snake is given Dorne, Bran leaves with the now turned human WWs beyond the former wall, and Jon is offered KL but declines it and goes home to rule the North, either Arya and Gendry are given KL or they sail West of Westeros and KL is given to a new character introduced in S8 who proves him or herself to be a man or woman of the people.
-	Jon raises his twin children as Ned did for him on his own and Sam writes the song of Ice and fire. Bittersweet ending is Westeros is saved but at what cost as Westeros is left in ruin and Jons lost yet another lover. 
-	Qyburn has fled Westeros and is never heard from again, He is presumed dead.",8,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

There  are various theories out there about the origins of Jon and Danny. And  the show at least has strongly implied that Jon is in fact Lyanna's kid,  which seemingly does away with some theories involving Danny actually  being the Tower of Joy baby.

Though  there's a somewhat common alternative theory still allows for this  possibility -- Jon and Danny are twins, both born at the Tower of Joy,  and separated at birth to avoid Robert's wrath. With Ned taking  responsibility for Jon, and the Danes taking responsibility for Danny.

The  more I think about this, the more I like it. How fitting would it be  for the story to end with Jon and Danny married and ruling a dynasty,  only for them to find out that it's a twincest dynasty just like the  Lannister twincest dynasty that started all the strife at the beginning  of the story? I doubt that this is really the case, but I like to  imagine that it will be.",22,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I'm currently on the first book, *A Game of Thrones*, and I noticed something.

I'm on the part where the tournament has begun. From Sansa's perspective, King Robert suddenly roars in a drunken rage, scolding Cersei about him being able to participate in the tourney if he wanted to.

There's a hidden depth there. I think Cersei purposely goaded him, while he was drinking, to take part in the tournament. At the time there were 4 finalists: the Mountain, the Hound, Ser Jaime, and Ser Loras .

All of them are capable of beating Robert, and 3 out of 4 are loyal to House Lannister and would probably kill him if ordered. They'd be pardoned by Joffrey (or maybe not, but no matter to Cersei except for Jaime) and they'd be rid of Robert.

I'm still reading (and it's been ages since I had last read it so I don't remember it well) so I am not sure if they hint at it any more after that, but that's a pretty clever facet that I never considered before.

And then Ned fucked it all up by reasoning with Robert. He was foiling their plans without even realizing it.",19,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I have a theory that I would like to either confirm or deny with you guys. My theory is that Tyrion is going to move to Cerseis side as Season 8 progresses. I came up with this based on the events of the Season Finale of season 7. Most importantly, when Tyrion talks about how nothing meant more to him then the nephews and niece that died. Tyrion then learns that Cersei is pregnant again, and it immediately cuts back to the Dragon pit, where Cersei gives her full support, regardless of whether Jon gives his word not to support Daenerys afterwards. 

Another small details hat may or may not have any real meaning  is near the end of the episode when Tyrion glares at the room Daenerys and Jon are in. 

If you have any other support, or if my idea is completely off, please let me know. Thanks!",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

For almost a year know I have been working on and growing my virtual hockey simulation of Game of Thrones Hockey League (GOTHL). Within NHL18 and NHL19 I have create +600 custom characters and just over 31 custom teams for them to play on and compete. I did the first full iteration in NHL18, the remnants of which you can find [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FVAg1lQxxDr24MU9QGnHHGfjVbM6uQwms5R73ZGeIyE/edit?usp=sharing). I estimate this initial undertaking took about 100-120 hours to complete. Moving forward I have made a lot of changes in the new version being produced on NHL19 that I think will make the league better and the process more efficient. I'm about 8% done with the 640 characters. Here are some [screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/wRshG1T) of jerseys and my offline master-spreadsheet. I really enjoy this project, while in the pursuit of so many names I learned a lot about the GoT universe and when completed I end up playing a lot seasons as a team. I love to discuss the process if you guys have any questions and I hope the full project will be complete soon and I can show you guys more.",3,1,False,self,,,,,

_______

**The Plot in the Show**

OK, so I've added the word ""essentially"" because a lot of people say they don't like the dialogue and they think the characters aren't developed enough and there isn't enough of Dorne shown, and maybe I could agree with that. What I mean when people say Dorne is essentially bad is that they reject this series of events:

* Oberyn dies.
* Oberyn's lover wants revenge.
* She decides to incite a war by killing Myrcella. 
* Jaime and Bronn are sent to recover her.
* As Myrcella returns home she is poisoned by Ellaria.
* When Doran finds out about this he is assassinated by Ellaria.
* Ellaria forms an alliance with Danaerys to defeat the Lannisters.

**My Thoughts on the Show's Plot**

Now looking at it this way there are a few things I immediately like about this plot: It involves Bronn doing things; it further enamours us to Jaime, which pays off later during Danaerys's conquests; it's interesting to watch Ellaria Sand go from a sympathetic lover of Oberyn (a popular character in his own right) to somebody who harms innocents; it's interesting to see Danaerys form an alliance with somebody of such questionable morals.

Moreover, in Season 7 it gets even more interesting, firstly because we get the best line ever delivered by Cersei where she asks Ellaria Sand ""Why did you do that?"" with reference to Ellaria killing Myrcella. This is a great line, because it involves our main antagonist having righteous anger towards somebody who was themselves a sympathetic and likeable character back in Season 4. Ellaria Sand broke Cersei; this is the one time when Cersei truly cracks, because she smiled when Oberyn was killed, and she tries to keep up the cold and callous facade to enrage Ellaria, but ultimately she is on the verge of tears when she asks Ellaria why her same callousness prompted her to murder Myrcella. Also, Cersei has the best revenge ever.

So do I like it... not massively. I'm a big fan of world building and I wish in general Game of Thrones moved around a bit more rather than staying in a lot of the same places. I actually am mostly making this post because I've been thinking a lot about what I'd change in the show and one of the things I'd change is moving back Danaerys's invasion and having one Season of Dorne v Lannister action before Danaerys shows up. But honestly if I were to rewrite Game of Thrones I wouldn't change a single one of those bullet points. The only thing I'd add is that before the alliance with Danaerys I think the Dornish should be engaging in a military campaign through the Stormlands.

_____

**The Plot in the Books**

Ok, so the reason I'm making this post is I haven't read the books, but here's what I understand about the plot:

* The Sandsnakes want to bring House Martel to war against the Lannisters
* However, Doran arrests the Sandsnakes
* Doran's daughter, Arianna Martel, wants to crown Myrcella queen, because she's older than Tommen.
* However, this goes wrong and Myrcella is wounded.
* But Doran reveals that he's secretly planning on marrying his son to Danaerys.
* However, this fails because Danaerys rejects him.
* Then Doran decides to support a rival claimant, Aegon Targaryen.

**My Thoughts on the Book's Plot**

That's what I've gauged from some cursory research. Plot synopses and the like. At a glance there's nothing about it that seems immediately better than the plot in the show. In fact immediately it seems unnecessarily more complicated. It's basically four plans: the Sandsnakes want to start a war, but that fails; and then Arianna wants to make Myrcella queen, but that fails; and then Doran wants to marry his son to Danaerys, but that fails; and then Doran wants to support a rival claimant and... Well at that point I can't imagine myself caring anymore.

If somebody gave me those two outlines for a story: one based on the book and the other based on the show, I'd pick the show in an instance. Of course, yes, bad dialogue and poor execution in general could make either story line bad, but just going off basic details, the show's looks better.

**Why People Say the Book is Better**

But I actually have made some effort for look for youtube videos explaining why the book's plot is better. And so far there's been an ungodly number of people who have spent half their explanation talking about feminism... Which is kind of strange. A lot of people are like, ""But the Sandsnakes aren't even empowering why has feminism got to be about killing men there are already enough empowered women in Game of Thrones!"" Which is... strange to me. If a bunch of women kill a king I'd say... a bunch of women killed a king... I wouldn't make any inferences about gender politics based on that. I feel like these are the types of people who think feminists are stealing their video game titties.

But once they've stopped complaining about feminism all they have left to say is that they like the book's plot better because ""It's complicated"". They also express a lot of support for Doran having a secret plan the whole time, and get angry that in the show he was really passive. But for my part I don't think having a twist makes a plot better. That's Shyamalan level logic. Again... just from my end when I hear somebody say, ""And the books are better because it turns out Doran had a secret plan the whole time"" I think to myself... ok... that sounds kind of dumb.

_____

**Tl;dr:**

But ultimately I haven't read the books. I'm only going off what plot synopses say and what random youtubers say. I'm interested to hear if somebody can help me understand what exactly about the plot in the books is better. ",33,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

It's so good and so detailed that I instantly started it over just cause in case I missed anything. I don't know if it's been discussed before but I can't help but think Daario has some ties to Rhaegar Targaryen. 

Him helping Daenerys and overthrowing the second sons makes me think ok that was too easy. There has to be some separate motivation other than him just being attracted to her or her being a queen. After all he saved her life, risked his, and freed a city which gave her thousands of followers.

Now why the ties to Rhaegar Targaryen? Time to put our tinfoil hats on. I suspect that Jaqen H'ghar the faceless man is actually Rhaegar in hiding. 

The Valar morghulis coin gives me evidence that there is some connection. In the opening episode of season 4, Arya comes across some Frey soldiers; she pretends to pay money to get warm and slaughters them with the hound. She pulled out that coin that they were completely unfamiliar with. Perhaps it's a currency used in the eastern part of the known world maybe that's why the Frey troops didn't recognize it? Now the second sons were in possession of the same exact coin when deciding who would kill Daenerys, but there has to be a reason when Daario pulls out the same coin he utters the ""valar morghulis"" line. Why would the writers add that in? (If someone wants to debunk all of this please address that line as well!) His skills as a fighter, how he played his comrades leads me to believe he has some separate training. 

The faceless man how could we truly know who he is? Everything about his identity is questionable. There's theories out there that support that he could actually be Rhaegar in hiding. His interest in Arya stark who  even Ned said in s1 resembles his dead sister Lyana stark who was in love with Rhaegar. His strand of blonde hair that looks a lot like the Targaryen hair. Perhaps the reason why he's hiding in the first place using different face masks? Maybe there is a purpose of the people he is killing. Maybe each person had a hand in aiding the Targaryen genocide somehow? Even rhaegars death there's no guarantee he is actually dead, his body was never found. Many witnessed Baratheon force an axe into the chest plate of his armor, sending his body back to a body of water. Arya had to travel by boat to get to the faceless man.

Both characters also unexpectedly disappear from the plot with little answers as to why. Ok cool Arya got her training from the faceless man, but I still feel his true intentions never showed for some reason. Daenerys just sends Daario away like he didn't help her conquer the east's lords. Maybe he will play a part with the gold company in s8 but I think perhaps we'll see the two characters I've been mentioning link up somehow or some sort of connection explained whether in the show or maybe future books it's referenced. 

All of it is suspicious to me...daario's interest and connection with daenerys and likewise with Jaqen and Arya stark. 

Thoughts?

so today i am going to discuss about an interesting quote i found from game of thrones by jaime.

jaime was having a conversation with loras tyrell when he was arranged to marry her.

Jaime hints at how far she might go when he speaks toLoras Tyrell at Joffreys wedding in sesason 4 episode 2 The Lion and the Rose:

&gt;If you were to marry Cersei, shed murder you in your sleep. *If you somehow managed to put a child in her first, shed murder him, too.*

this made me thinking. its almost as if jaime saw cersei trying to do this way back in her earlier lifetime.

But today i'll be giving you my Top 14 Crackpot/tinfoil predictions I want to see next season (but probably won't happen in the long run) In no real order, So basically these are sort of Crackpot/Tinfoil predictions that are crazy to the point that I want to see them happen but probably won't happen in the long run, either because they may not have time to explore it or maybe even because it simply doesn't seem like that is where the story is headed (atleast for the show), anyways let's get started (and yes this will be show only if you haven't guess already).

1. Daario returns and is revealed to have betrayed Dany and sided with Euron.

2. Arya Stark is both the Valonqar AND the more beautiful queen.

3. Something related to Varys and House Blackfyre.

4. Nymeria and her wolfpack returns to help in the battle against the dead/Arya mounts and rides Nymeria into battle (the reason this is a crackpot/tinfoil prediction is because I don't see Nymeria and her wolfpack returning, I think that short and sweet reunion in S7 we had was a good send-off, but if she did return this is what I want to see).

5. Jaime and Cersei are revealed to be Targaryens.

6. Jaqen returns and the Syrio=Jaqen theory is confirmed.

7. Qyburn and Euron reanimate one of Dany's dragons after killing it.

8. Dany is revealed to be the bastard of Rhaella Targaryen and Ser Arthur Dayne or the twin sister of Jon with Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen.

9. Euron summons a Kraken from the sea or the NK somehow reanimates a dead Kraken.

10. The person who rules Westeros at the end is a completely new and original character introduced in S8 but proves him or herself to be a Man or Woman of the people.

11. The child of Brandon Stark and Ashara Dayne comes into the picture and is a completely new character who has not appeared in the story yet.

12. either Jaime or Davos are Azor Ahai.

13. WW's are not the final conflict but Cersei and/or Euron are instead.

14. ICE is Reforged.",16,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Some rangers never returned and theres been more and more Wildlings coming south of late. They talk about the mission, the talk of war brewing in the South, and one superstitious ranger mentions the cold. Winter is coming, and this one is to be the longest in centuries. The rangers talk about the struggle the Watch will face in winter, with vastly depleted numbers and the lords of the south refusing to send help. 

As the cold grows and night descends, with no sign of any living thing for miles, they decide to make camp. The conversation shifts to the strange things rangers have spotted in their expeditions, too fantastic to be true; giants, mammoths, wargs. Some wildlings have even been heard to claim that The Long Night is coming again. The other rangers laugh it off as bullshit; the White Walkers havent been sighted in millennia, since the days of The White Wolf, Jaime Goldenhand, Brienne the Beauty, The Imp of Casterly Rock, the Mother of Dragons, The Mad Queen, and Bran the Greenseer, and even their very existence is open to debate in the first place. They laugh it off together, but the fear in the silence after their laughter feels deafening. In fact, the silence is eerie. Not a single animal, owl, wolf, or anything.

One of the rangers points out thats not true; theres actually a ton of ravens in the trees around them, cloaked by the night. They talk for a while longer, the ravens watching. Suddenly theres a strange noise in the woods, and the rangers get ready to fight the wildlings who they assume killed the first expedition.

Instead, a White Walker slowly walks towards them. And another. And another. Theyre surrounded. As they descend on to the rangers in a circle, the ravens fly off, the screams of the the rangers in the background. As one raven flies off, its pupils return to normal as the Three-Eyed Raven (Crow) exits its mind.

I think this ending would be great; it would bring everything full circle while showing GRRMs point of how ultimately nothing changes; war continues, humanity will always be capable of evil and good, and the cycle will repeat. Our favourite characters are remembered for all of time, but only in legend. Their faults and human qualities that made them so real are lost, they become larger than life, with only their great deeds are remembered, not the very real, flawed people behind those deeds. They actually write it all off as just the stuff of legend, not even knowing theyre being watched the whole time by one of the very legends they talk of. I think it would be a really fitting epilogue to it all.

And when all her advisors came up to her prior Daario saying they will fight for her I began to wonder who and how they others would win the fight. 
I enjoyed coming up with different scenarios.

But in the end I came to the conclusion each of them wouldve probably beaten the champion. 

Grey Worm I think would have won on foot likely dismantling the champion from his horse similar to how Daario did. 

Selmy for some reason Id imagine would struggle the most due to his age. But I think hed win if he grabbed his own horse too. 

And Jorah I thought might struggle too but I remembered hes a veteran Jouster. Which is basically what the champion was trying to do. And I think from all his experience hed win easily. And if it came to sword on sword I think hed still win.

She stated in her interview on her last scene as Arya that it was a beautiful end for her character, and she was alone. Now there are some things to take away from this but I think the big thing is that Arya may be alone in the endgame...or not, as we know we shouldn't take actors words as fact and she may not be talking about the final Arya scene but her final scene As Arya as they don't film in chronological order so her last scene she filmed may not be Arya's final scene.

But what if it is Arya's final scene she filmed and not just the final scene as Arya that she filmed (as in not Arya's last scene but the last scene as Arya Maisie filmed)? Well I have a theory. Some people may thing it could be her going back to Braavos but personally I don't see her going back to the FM. Her story with them is done and I think her last words to Jaqen confirm that she will not be returning to the house of black and white anytime soon. Instead I believe if it is Arya's last scene Maisie was talking about and Arya was alone at the end I believe that Sansa dies saving Arya (paralleling Lady and Nymeria), Bran leaves Beyond the former (or atleast what ever is left of) the Wall to be the new 3ER, and Gendry is legitimised and made Lord of the Stormlands, but with Sansa dead and Jon possibly being given the Crownlands Arya may be forced to become Lady of Winterfell and Warden of the North, with Gendry not wanting to give up his legitimacy and also them not being able to be together due to Stormlands and Winterfell being very far away, meaning Arya would be truly alone.

But however I don't think it's Arya's final scene she was talking about, they don't film in chronological order so I think she could've been talking about the last scene she filmed as Arya rather then Arya's ACTUAL final scene. But what could that scene be? Idk, maybe Arya after the first battle against the AOTD gets separated from everyone else somehow and is alone once more. ",11,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Ok  so let me start of by saying no, no i do not believe that its a bad  thing i just believe that people should remember that these White  walkers have not been in a real fight agains a human or anyone in  posetion of a high quality steel blade in hundreds if not thousands of  years, so why would they need to rigourusly train, i dont doubt that  they do train too a certain extent but if you can just break your  opponents weapon whats the point in becoming a master fighter only to  win the fight in a matter of seconds.

In  the episode when jon fights the white walker in hardhome (S5x8) the  walker seems genuinly confused at how jons Blade can resist the effects  of his weapon (staff, haliberd, idk) so its not like they knew about  Valyrian steel nor have we seen a blade made from dragon glass/Obsidian.

Finaly  i doubt that if they had the ability to raise a Wight horde that they  would even consider getting into a 1v1 especialy seeing as if one of  them dies a portion of there army will die with them.

When staying at the Night Fort, Bran tells a story he heard from Old Nan to Jojen and Mira Reed. 
The story is of  a Lord visiting the Nights watch at the Nite Fort. 
The cook of the Nite Fort Murders the Lords sons and cooks them into a Pie that he then serves to the Lord. 
The Gods Angry with the cook for breaking Guest Right punish the cook and turn him into a Rat.
The very next scene in the Episode is Walter Frey Eating a Pie The day after the Red Wedding talking with Roose Bolton.

3 Seasons Later at the end of season 6 Arya Kills Walter Freys Sons and Cooks them into a Pie in which he eats before the truth is revealed to him and he is killed.

Sansa: Did you know about Ramsay? If you didn't know, you're an idiot. If you did know, you're my enemy. Would you like to hear about our wedding night? He never hurt my face. He needed my face, the face of Ned Stark's daughter. But the rest of me, he did what he liked with the rest of me as long as I could still give him an heir. What do you think he did?

Petyr: I can't begin to contemplate--

Sansa: What do you think he did to me?

Brienne: Lady Sansa asked you a question.

Petyr: He beat you.

Sansa: Yes, he enjoyed that. What else do you think he did?

Petyr: Sansa, I--

Sansa: What else?

Petyr: Did he cut you?

Sansa: Maybe you did know about Ramsay all along.

Petyr: I didn't know.



Everyone online seems to think he just cut her all over with a knife and mutilated her body. I however believe it means he mutilated her genitalia. Yes, he needed her to be able to give him an heir...but she doesnt need her pleasure Button to do so.... 

Also in the books he marries her friend Jayne and rapes and tortures her and seems to force her to mate with his dogs as well. So I feel like his character would definitely love the power of female genital mutilation.

Anyone else agree?

When Bran confronts Coldhands for killing them after Coldhands referred to them as foes, Bran calls him a monster and Coldhands responds Your monster Brandon Stark. 

Im not sure how to read that. Is he implying that somehow Bran has a hand in creating the monster that is Coldhands? Its obvious that Coldhands (Benjen in the show) knows more than Bran at this specific moment.

I just want to say, this book is a masterpiece. There was so much raw emotion, imagery, and foreshadowing, and I loved every minute of it. My favorite two chapters had to be during Arya's perspective when Ned dies, and Sansa's perspective after Ned dies. I have never cried from a book, but these two scenes got too me. I had a bunch of people in my office asking me if everything was alright. 

Then you can really feel the passion when Job was racing to go met his brother at Riverrun. The show did a good portrayal of this scene, but the book's version had so much emotion throughout the chapter. My favorite line is when he Jon goes back to the Wall and Mormont was telling him how he knew Jon would come back. Jon then intended to honor and keep his vow, even though it means giving up his family. In his internal monolgue he asks his father, Arya, Rob, and Brandon to forgive him.

What if Bran becomes king with his new 3 eyed Raven powers and Sansa rules the North with Arya as her right hand. 
Or.... What if by the lone wolf dies it means that Jon Snow is no longer a lone wolf after learning he is a Targaryen, he becomes king(after the war) but keeps the stark family as his family as well as being a Targaryen and that's how the pack survives. The main Lannisters die (Jamie in the middle of S8 and Cersei near the end) apart from Tyrion. 
Not given the rest of the families much thought to be honest but when you think about it, it would be quite typical of Game of Thrones and George R.R. Martin to have had that clue there since the first book and then remind us of it at the end of season 7 just as the winter arrives.",7,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

as you know most of the redditors here are in favour of a targaryen restoration.

but i ll argue why targaryens are not fit to be the rulers of westeros.

i know i ll get a lot of crirticism for it, but let me explain it more clearly.

in the game of thrones, targaryens carries a disease within them.

its called targaryen sickness.

that is one generation of targs may be extremely benevolent and kind, but the next generation would end up being the worst tyrants and insane monarchs.

a list of mad targs

* King [Maegor I Targaryen](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Maegor_I_Targaryen)
* King [Baelor I Targaryen](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Baelor_I_Targaryen)
* Prince [Rhaegel Targaryen](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Rhaegel_Targaryen)
* Prince [Aerion Targaryen](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aerion_Targaryen)
* King [Aerys II Targaryen](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aerys_II_Targaryen)
* [Viserys Targaryen](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Viserys_Targaryen)

and not only these , a lot of other targ rulers were tyrants and cruel. they committed genocides and cruelties on a massive scale.

this phenomenon is called targaryen sickness. due to their inbreeding and incest, these targs have a lot of mental and health issues. some end up like the mad king. some end up like a benevolent ruler.

so, if one generation is benevolent, the next generation usually becomes cruel.

for these reasons, its not feasible for iron throne to be still ruled by a targaryen.

and possibly it might be for these reasons tyrion may betray dany in season 8.

but for which alternative??

lets look at the rest of the houses . starks have no legitimate claim. nor do the lannisters.

and we are left with one remaining house which is represented in game of thrones logo.

house baratheon.

baratheons rose to power through a popular rebellion against the mad king.

also, baratheon house is a targ bastard house and have valyrian bloos. also, 2 targ princesses over the generation were married into house baratheon, the last one being princess rhaelle targaryen, robert baratheon's grandmother.

thus, the royalty claim of house baratheon is based on popular legitimacy as well as bloodline.

this makes a strong case for house baratheon.

dany on the other hand, maybe popular in essos but as demonstrated in sesaon 7, she is despised by almost everyone in westeros. so i cant see how the westerosis accept the daughter of the mad king as their queen.

she may have legitimacy through bloodline, but thats not enough.

also, it should be remmebered that baratheons are still the legal royal family in westeros.

iron throne legally belongs to baratheons.

cersei is an usurper who occupiues the iron throne through illegitimate means, not even through the right of conquest, but through treason and backstabbing of one of the most barabaric kind.

so a baratheon marrying a stark would have a strong claim to iron throne.

and its been forshadowed a lot in season 1.

robert says to ned in season1, ""i have a son,you have a daughter, we'll join our houses""

&amp;#x200B;

![img](vnxaewtx4yu11)

also, it could be either arya/sansa.

so the younger more beautiful queen that was prophecised by maggy in game of thrones to cast cersei down may be sansa/arya.

i think the roles of jon and dany maybe something else. like defeating the whitewalkers and getting killed in the process.

probably this is why the showrunners still show baratheon sigil above KL even though cersei rules with the lannister title.

&amp;#x200B;

![img](ezchagny4yu11)

probably it might be an easter egg or foreshadowing. otherwise, there's no purpose to still show the stag sigil above kings landing.

also, gendry is also a targaryen because his great gandmother was targaryen and his house itself is a targ offshoot.

so if he marries sansa/arya he actually unites 3 houses, targ, baratheon and stark.

so i think a baratheon restoration is possible in season 8, though it could also be that i am just wrong and it maynot happen at all.",10,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

* He takes it for granted that Jaime will be his heir and will continue his bloodline but he doesn't realise he loves Cersei. As a result Cersei/Jaime conspire quite early to have Jaime join the Kingsguard to avoid his betrothal to Lysa Arryn, a plan which fails at first, but later on comes to fruition, much to Tywin's disapproval.
* He disregards Cersei loving power and fighting (much like Arya), and instead marries her to Robert like livestock, and then attempts to do the same with Loras Tyrell. He never prepares her for any kind of ruling because he can't fathom she'll ever hold any real power in the first place, something she always yearned.
* He absolutely despises Tyrion, the son most like him, and he encourages Cersei hating him, as a result they never grow close. So Tyrion spends all his youth neglected, whoring and drinking, hated by almost everyone instead of becoming a second Tywin and securing the future of the Lannisters.

I can't help but think that someone like Ned would be a better father figure. First of all, he would love Tyrion and teach the kids to love each other so Tyrion would unleash his full potential. Imagine how powerful Cersei ruling with Tyrion as her Hand would be. If anything, she loves family so he would be able to hold back her impulsive violent urges on his demand but she would still rule ruthlessly with an iron fist (something Tyrion might not have the stomach for). They would make a pretty good team.

In addition, Ned's pretty open minded with Arya, so maybe he wouldn't be against training Cersei in either politics or battle, things she genuinely enjoyed. 

I don't know how he would deal with the Jaime/Cersei awkwardness though, because he never had to deal with that in his own household.

On the other hand, Ned was too idealistic and honorable for his own good. One could argue that not all 3 Lannister kids would have survived this far if Tywin was more like Ned, which is a good point.

So, what do you think? Would C/J/T be better off with Ned as a father, or did having Tywin, as bad a father figure as he was, do them more good than harm?",14,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Naturally, for ""good adaptation"" I used the adaptation of *A Song of Ice and Fire* to *Game of Thrones*. A large section of that paper focused on themes and motifs, and how this aspect is one of the most important for a successful adaptation to occur. Most of my themes and motifs I wrote about had to do with the show as a whole, the idea of family, honor, etc.

Recently one thing that a friend I'm showing Game of Thrones had asked me, is basically what does each character represent, or what is the individual theme of each character. I never really thought about it before, but every character in Game of Thrones seems to have a very distinct theme throughout their arcs, even the minor side characters, so I would like you guys to perhaps contribute some one-sentence themes for each character, or stating recurring motifs.

Jon Snow: Keeping one's promise. Recurring motif - Sacrifice
Jaime: Not allowing reputation to define who you are. Recurring motif - Self-reflection
Arya: Finding one's identity. Recurring motif - Roleplaying
Sansa: (This one can go a few ways) Not taking for granted what you have, *or* Naivety and maturity.",12,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

This got me thinking, this would be an extraordinarily good strategy to use against wights. All they'd need to do is find an elevated position, place giant dry hay balls up top and when the dead come light them up and roll them down. 

We know how flammable the dead are, and that fire is one of the only ways to kill them. In a battle where the odds are already stacked against the living, something like this would be excellent at punching a hole through their ranks. This combined with cavalry and dragons strafing, I could see the living having a real shot at winning. 

Someone still has to kill the Night King to end it all, but for an all out battle episode, this would be so cool to see on screen. The living will need any tools/surprises they can get their hands on to win this conflict and I don't see a battle on an open field working that well, despite having 40,000 Dothraki screamers.

A simple threat would not be enough to guarantee silence and if Bran ever did say anything, it would be the word of a Prince of Winterfell and son of the Hand -- a man whose best known trait is his honor and fairness -- against an unpopular queen and her regicidal brother. Pushing him out of the window to make it look like he fell was the quickest, easiest, and most reasonable way to deal with the threat.

Aryas arc is all about turning her into a lone warrior, there are two parts to this, being separated from her family and learning to be a bad ass. The first part is both literal and emotional; she loses her direwolf, her father and her relationship with her sister in season 1. In Season 3 she not only loses the rest of her family but also her support group when Hot Pie stays at the Inn and Gendry chooses to stay with Brotherhood Without Banners. This is the case till Season 7 where she reunites with her wolf, Bran and Sansa but she struggles to reconnect with any of them. She hasnt caught up with Jon yet but Id be willing to bet they dont become a happy family again.

The other part is her learning to a bad ass, were shown shes competent with a bow at an early age, Jon gives her Needle and Syrio starts training her to use it. In season 2 she learns the value of death by using Jaqen to solve all her problems whilst in Seasons 3 and 4 she learns to kill people under the influence of the Hound. This continues with her training in the House of Black and White and by season 7 shes a stone cold executioner wiping out House Frey and casually cutting Littlefingers throat. We also learn that shes now a top tier fighter evidenced by her sparring with Brienne. 

At the point in the story were at Arya is one of the most dangerous people in Westeros but shes back in Winterfell with the remnants of her family and looking forwards to reunion with Jon, possibly the member of her family she was always closest to. We should be anticipating a happy reunion between Jon and Arya, and that may be the case initially, but thats not the direction Aryas storys been shaped to be over the last seven years, I expect shes going to have the rug pulled from under her feet and this is how I think it could happen.

The first thing is that I dont think its any coincidence that Syrio Farel comes from Bravos, the spiritual home of the Many Faced God and his agents, the Faceless Men. I believe the MFG wanted a champion to represent him in the story, Syrio was either sent to recruit Arya to be this champion or selected her when circumstances brought them together. Jaqen HGhar engineers their paths crossing immediately after the death of Syrio and tests her, she passes the test and Jaqen gives her coin. At this point her connection to her family is still too strong so we wait a couple of seasons whilst her connections to her family are stripped from her. Once these connections are removed Arya is ready to travel to Bravos.  

Over seasons 5 and 6 Arya learns the skills of the Faceless Men but were shown her rejecting their ideology and escaping back to Westeros to work on her own agenda. Whilst I cant pinpoint the evidence for this part of my theory Im not convinced she did escape, I think she was released, either because she wasnt ready to be a Faceless man or, possibly, because the MFG has a purpose for her which were not yet aware of. My theory is that the MFG wants Arya to reclaim the deaths stolen from him by resurrection, think the White Walkers wights, Qyburns Mountain and Melisandres Jon Snow..

Not many people will be surprised if Arya kills the Mountain, hes on her list after all and theres some decent arguments out there about why Cleganebowl wont happen, but why would she kill Jon Snow? As I said earlier I dont think Arya is destined for a happy reunion with Jon, it would contradict her story up to now but what could be the problem? I think that there will be a reveal in season 8 that Melisandres magic in season 6 wasnt as inconsequential as we believe, its pretty clear that the Lord of Light isnt a good god and Jon was resurrected to serve the Lord of Light in some way (Beric Dondarion talks about being resurrected because the Lord of Light has a plan for him). I cant predict exactly how it will play out but I think Jon wont turn out to be the hero of the story were expecting him to be, hell be some sort of slave to the Lord of Light and Arya will be forced to kill him. This will cut the last connection Arya had to her happy childhood and she will end up returning to the House of Black and White fully rejecting her name and becoming a girl. ",28,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

In my mind the humans have a very small chance of victory. Let's sum up who are fighting on the side of the living (although a point can be made about the Others being alive as well but that's not the point), and what makes up the Army of the Dead.

Living: 
 The armies of the North, led by House Stark and the Bastard Jon Snow
 The armies of Daenerys: the Unsullied, the Dothraki and what remains of the armies of Dorne and the Reach. And of course, two Dragons.
 The Free Folk, or what's left of it. They're stationed at the Wall which was, as we all know was destroyed. No numbers are known of the fighting force of the Free Folk.
 The armies of the Vale, which granted are pretty strong but I'm not sure how useful charges are against an already unorganized army of corpses.
 The Night's Watch, whose numbers have dwindled to an all time low.
 Jaime Lannister.

(If I forgot anyone please let me know)

Now the Army of the Dead:
 White Walkers, who can only be killed with either Dragonglass or Valyrian Steel, they can raise the dead.
 Human Wights, reanimated corpses who fight with incredible ferocity. They can only be killed by fire, by Dragonglass, Valyrian Steel or being shattered or broken apart.
 Animal Wights, for example the undead polar bear. Basically rabid, ferocious animals who die even harder.
 Viserion, an undead Dragon. He breathes blue flame.

And of course their strongest asset, everything killed by the Army of the Dead joins their ranks and becomes way deadlier than they were in life. If they kill a village with 100 warriors and 400 non-fighters, they gain 500 fighters.

Because of all these factors, especially the strength of the Army of the Dead, I really doubt the humans could win. Anything the humans have is basically useless without dragons or dragonglass.

Please share your thoughts too, convince me I'm wrong please.",13,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

some people point out the scene Tyrion talks with Cersei in S07E07 and interpret it as Tyrion betraying Dany and joining Cersei's side but I think that doesn't make sense. here is how Tyrion can betray Dany:

we see Tyrion all over season 7 counseling Dany not to use dragons to burn cities, not to use dothrakies and the unsullied to attack kingslanding because he doesn't want people to die. the reason that he serves Dany is to make a better world. now that he sees Dany starting to ignore him in S07E04 and we see his sad reactions in S07E05 to the ashes left of people burned alive he knows that this war has to end. Varys tells him that he should make her listen but Tyrion seems to fail in that. Dany doesn't listen to him burning the Tarlys, flying beyond the wall, ...

in S07E07 the dragonpit makes the best opportunity for him to at least pause the war for a while. we understand that he wants a truce by any means when he tells Jon Snow he should have lied to Cersei. Jon Snow isn't that type of character but Tyrion is. when he realizes that ""we are fucked"" he goes to talk to Cersei himself. this indicates that he is willing to even risk his life to make this truce.

now we have Tyrion wanting a truce by any means and Cersei knowing that she is losing and should play this game the cunning way of her father. 

in S07E07 after Tyrion realizes Cersei is pregnant and we don't see the rest, i think Tyrion tells Cersei to fake a truce and betrays Dany not telling her the truth so:

1. Dany with dragons and dothrakies and the unsullied stop tearing everything up in South.

2. Dany focuses on the real threat that now Tyrion realizes is the army of the dead and white walkers.

3. Cersei's child is born before Dany kills her (we know Tyrion's love for his sister's children)

that's why he feels worried sailing to North in S07E07",22,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

If we were told the truth GRRM believed in May 2015 that the book would be finished by Oct that year, just five months later. Whilst I can absolutely believe he missed that deadline it seems very unlikely that  5 months of work has turned into 3 and a half years. People have speculated that hes stuck in a narrative cul de sac which he cant get out of as the reason for the delay which is possible but there are good reasons to delay the release of the book as well.

While the show and the books are diverging it is likely that the key plot points and fates of the major characters are the same. It is likely that TWOW will have some reveals that are still to be shown in Season 8, theres a question of whether the money men believe that these reveals should appear first on the screen or on the page. I dont know the specific economic details of the publishing world versus TV but Id expect theres more money in TV, I expect a lot more people watch the show than read the books. If that is the case Id expect the suits to want to protect the show over the book. If that is the case, and TWOW does have some major plot reveals that we havent seen yet, that there would be a lot of pressure to delay the book.

The idea that the book is purposefully being delayed to protect the TV show is a semi-spoiler in itself so, in this scenario, GRRM has been asked to lie, hence why hes been so vague about his progress and the publishing date over the last three years.

So, what are the chances that well see The Winds of Winter on the book shelves a month after the final episode is aired?",21,1,False,self,,,,,

Well you would have Arya (a Stark) and Gendry (a Baratheon) raising a targaryen baby (or twins) of Jon and Dany, Which would be a bending of all three houses (or four if you take into account Arya is also part Tully). There has already been forshadowing for Arya &amp; Gendry getting together in S3 when Arya told Gendry I can be your family and Gendry replying No you would not be my family, you would be my Lady and also I think it would be a really cool way to end the story, that the two houses who hated Targaryens end up bending together and raising one (or two).",6,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Now yes I still think it's possible he does but if he doesnt what will he do instead? Well I would like to present a counter argument and that is Jaime will sacrifice himself protecting Bran and Arya, afterwards he would die in the arms of the woman he loves, Brienne.

Now what evidence do I have for this. Well for one if Jaime died protecting Bran it would come full circle with where there stories began, Jaime pushed him out of the tower at the beginning and in the end he would die protecting him, he would also die protecting Arya as well not only reassuring Arya he has changed but also protecting a daugther of Cat, Something that brienne promised to do. Also in S5 Bronn asked Jaime how he would like to do which Jaime then replies ""in the arms of the woman I love"". Some think it'll be Cersei and while that's possible I believe it'll be Brienne.

Also they left the valonqar prophecy out of the show, meaning they can pretty much do whatever they want. Finally if Jaime doesnt kill Cersei then I think dying to save Ned Starks children would be just as a poetic way to go out. As for who would kill Cersei?

Also keeping to the time period, what was the average distance one would travel in a day given the technology they had available to them.

&amp;#x200B;

Jacqen H'gar will be the leader of the Golden Company in season 8. Here's why:

The golden company will appear to be working for Cersei and Euron.  It wont be revealed that the leader is Jacqen H'gar until he betrays Cersei and (possibly Euron, if Euron doesn't betray her first) - all in some dramatic fashion. Maybe Arya gets caught trying to kill Cersei while wearing little finger's mask and the Jacqen H'gar's- Golden-Company-Mask character is asked to execute Arya but instead he executes Cersei.  Either way H'gar pulling off the mask will be a huge reveal for the season.  Maybe Jaqen H'gar is pretending to by Tycho and thats how he gets so close to that situation and explains the cryptic relationship the iron bank has w/ the faceless men (golden company).    


Why doe?? Why would the faceless men and many faced god want to betray Cersei? Because they're being paid by the Iron Bank, not Cersei, to carry out the gift of the many faced god.  And Cersei basically just paid off her credit card, then went and bought a new mercedes, the day the balance was back at zero, putting her back into major debt. The Iron Bankbets on winnersand Golden company goes for the highest bidder, which the Iron Bank will always be. The Iron bank is an asset oriented investment firm that believes in leverage, which they've clearly stated. Cersei's family has defaulted on their loans in the past, and Westeros' financial future is looking real bad.

\*Cersei Assets?

\- A creepy pirate lord w/ 1,000 ships (love Euron, favorite character to watch)

\- A divided Westeros who hates her, sick

\- A divided Lannister Army

\*Dany's Assets?

\- ""3"" dragons(as far as most know)

\- Dothraki

\- Iron Islands peeps

\- support from the entire north

\- support fromthe south Dorn

\- Perhaps all that gold from the cities of the east she's conquered....which the iron bank would love to see come back to the east. 

.....Who is more likely to create a prosperous economy in Westeros for the Iron Bank to make money off? Who is more likely to pay their bills? Who has a proven track record as a leader? Dany

Also, the House of Black and White seems to have some cryptic relationship with the Iron Bank.  


More context, in case you didn't know: The Many Faced God, is the god of death, not the night king. And The many faced god acts through the faceless men. ""The faceless men see death as a gift from the many-faced God to end human suffering; either to euthanize the sick or bereaved, who can no longer stand the suffering of living, or as a gift to end the lives of those who are causing suffering to others. (A1)"" Basically, the faceless men are in charge of managing the balance of WHO can take what lives and who cant.Why do you think bravos is a free city with no king or queen?? 

The lives the Knight King takes via the whites are not his lives to take, just like Meryn Trant's life was not Arya's to take. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Also: Its a numbers game: North Army + Dany's Army + (randoms, jaime's loyal peeps) just wont cut it.  They need an army with talent, size and assets, which they've clearly described in detail about the golden company, in the past season. That army would give them a fighting chance.

And.... This show goes full circle like crazy. Jaqen H'agar has already helped Arya whilst pretending to be a soldier, why not do it again, but this time on a more massive scale.  


The ""free"" city of Bravos. Soon to be, the ""free"" country of Westeros - the wheel will be broken

My money's on there being no kids, Dany dying, Jon becoming king. It makes sense, as Jon has Targ and Stark blood, is a warrior and a leader.

(Also as for spoilers Im not sure if it means spoilers for the next season or previous season, if its previous, it does, if its next season, it doesnt) 

Game of Thrones: Winters end is a roleplay set 25 years after the events of game of thrones. 

The plots and ideas are explained within the server, and theres a lot to go over, so Ill just leave the link! 

No canon characters will be played, your character MUST be an OC. (If they are alive, Canons can be NPCed if needed) OCs related to Canons are encouraged, but unrelated OCs are encouraged as well. Your character may be a wildling, a Dothraki or someone from outside of Westeros if you prefer! There are plenty of roles, and more can be discussed! 

The first things you need to know is that the roleplay is expected to be very literate and it will require a bit of experience. I ask that your posts adhere to the rules within the RP, and that you do know a bit about game of thrones (either the books or the tv series) although this is mainly based on the HBO television series. You will be expected to create a character! (or multiple if you wish)

This will be a long term Roleplay so please do not join if you wont be reasonably committed to it! 

It is preferred that you do not join if you are under the age of 18. 

Feel free to join using the link. You may ask me questions on reddit or on discord if needed!

Afterward, Sansa and Jon had an argument about the uneven fight, how Jon was underestimating Ramsay, and how he should have tried getting more men before fighting.

Earlier, it was shown that she had sent for the Knights of the Vale by raven without Jon's knowledge, going so far as to lie to Jon to keep it a secret.

I'm really trying to give Sansa the benefit of the doubt, but I keep thinking that she caused the majority of Jon's army, which comprised mostly of wildlings, House Mormont, and a few other minor houses to die needlessly because she couldn't (or wouldn't) speak up about the reinforcements.

It really paints Sansa in a negative light for me, especially when she chastised Jon for not waiting for more men without volunteering the information that she had summoned the Knights of the Vale, and when they came, she rode in with Littlefinger as if she was the savior in all of this.

True, she didn't hear whether or not they were coming or when, but the prospect of the Knights of the Vale helping would have greatly affected Jon's strategy, making me trust her less.  Am I understanding this correctly, or did I miss something?",47,1,False,spoiler,,,,,
