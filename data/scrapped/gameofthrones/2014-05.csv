It's the scene where the father is praying to The Seven and The Hound tells him to hurry it up. 

My Theory is that the father will take the place of Septon Meribald, and this is where the Hound will end up instead of The Quiet Isle. (Assuming the theory that The Hound is still alive is true.) I have this theory because first of all, the show wouldn't have to introduce a new character. Secondly, the father lives in the Riverlands, and as shown, is quite religious. Lastly, I see the father as someone who would forgive The Hound for stealing his money, and someone who would welcome The Hound back, and let him pay off his debts. I also see him as someone who Brienne could meet on her own adventures, and someone who would be able to give Septon Meribald's speech about war and what it does to people.

Does anyone have any thoughts on this? (Also, sorry if this has been brought up before).",42,103,False,self,,,,,

I didn't find it that obvious in the first book, maybe the later books elaborated it more.

When we first see the wolves they're but cubs, they're rolling around in the wake of a battle where ***stag*** and a ***direwolf*** killed each other. 

They are then given to the Stark children. The symbolism is not subtle at that point. Theon doesn't get any, meaning that he never was and never will be a Stark, and of course he lashes out cynically of the other children. Jons wolf is different from the others, and was found a little bit later in the scene away from the other wolfs. Also, it's an albino (snow).

From that point forward the wolfs **are** the children.

**Robb**

Grey Wind is great and fierce, following him into battles and being a perfect kingly symbol. When Robb dies Grey Wind is stuck in a cage, like Robb was stuck in the hall with the Freys. They both die in cages.

**Jon**

Ghosts albinism and being different from the other wolfs is very obvious but his later actions are more elusive. When Jon goes beyond the wall and does his Wildling shenanigans, Ghost is never around and always seems like he's running away, yet he's still there. Just like Jon seemed to have abandoned the Watch and then abandoned the Wildlings, his dubious wanderings represent Snows rouge tactics and elusive allegiance.

The last time we saw Ghost he was stuck in a trap and Jon was on his way... hmm...

**Sansa**

I think this is the most tragic wolf story. Her wolf, Lady, is killed by her father Eddard Stark on the kings road. All the Stark children now have wolfs except her, signifying that she is no longer a Stark. And why was Lady killed? Sansas naive relationship with Joffrey caused misery for Arya and her friend, and she abandoned the Stark honor when trying to be neutral in confessions. By helping Joffrey that way and hurting her family her wolf is killed by her father. I think that has even further symbolism, as Ned has himself sentenced Sansa to this fate. He's taking her with him to wed Joffrey, knowing she'll not be a Stark anymore, and on the Kings Road he slays his daughters symbol of the North. Ned is to blame for Sansas demise, whatever he might have thought would happen. It gets more powerful the more I think about it: Ned taking away her Stark symbol on the road to the King.

**Arya**

Arya and Sansa may not have liked each other before, but after the Kings Road incident that relationship turns to hatred. Nymeria, her wolf, is driven away into the wild to escape death. While Sansas wolf died Aryas got away and is now lost. And what does Arya do later on? She wanders around Kings Landing, and then wanders around Westeros. People rarely notice her identity and she's truly incognito. Not dead, still a Stark, yet hidden from the world.

**Bran and Rickon**

I'm totally lost with those two. Can anyone explain it to me?


Now this may all be very obvious but I like to tell new readers/watchers about reading into the symbolism. It's helped my younger brother to understand and better follow the series a lot.",5,3,False,self,,,,,

After watching the first 3 seasons, I started to read the books. Obviously for the parts that the show had covered it wasn't as enjoyable as watching the show because I already knew the vast majority of what was going to happen. But even when I got past where the point where the show was at, I still found myself enjoying watching the show more than reading the books.

Now don't get me wrong, I think the books are better than the show, because they are more in depth, and have much more complexity etc. But I still think I *enjoyed* watching the show more than reading it. Like, I might think something like Schindler's List is a better movie than say, Avengers Assemble. But I feel like I would enjoy watching Avengers Assemble over Schindler's List.

I mean, in the story, he puts the blame of Bran Stark's attempted murder on Tyrion, even though that was probably Joffrey (although I don't think that was 100% confirmed). But let's assume that he just genuinely thought that Tyrion had supplied the dagger to murder Bran and was just helping Ned and Catelyn (although, if I was the president of something and I ordered an assassination, I wouldn't give someone a gun with a bunch of bullets that say my name on the shells to do the deed. I think Baelish is smarter than this.)

Why pin Joffrey's murder on Tyrion as well? Tyrion (at least in the show) says that someone wanted to pin the blame on him, and I'm just trying to find Baelish's reasoning behind all of this. Of course, this one could be purely coincidental as well, but I'm not so sure.

Why does Petyr want Tyrion to be killed? Perhaps he views him as some kind of rival? A dangerous rival, not in the same vein as Varys, because I don't think that Baelish wants Varys dead. I don't know, I'm not really sure. Both of those situations could have been merry mix-ups, but I don't think Baelish leaves much to chance.",113,60,False,self,,,,,

Obviously I don't know if it's true and I don't want to know I just want to say to my fellow book readers who are up to date, DONT DO THIS to people, this is pure fighting fire with fire and I feel like I have been punished for somebody else's actions and a huge part of the story ruined for me if this is true just because I was looking at non spoiler memes.

However, she is unable to finish her story before being interrupted.

""Oh my sweet summer child  What do you know of fear? Fear is for the winter, my little lord, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep and the ice wind comes howling out of the north, when the sun hides it face for years at a time, and little children are born and live and die all in darkness while the direwolves grow gaunt and hungry, and the white walkers move through the woods.

The Others  Thousands and thousands of years ago, a winter fell that was cold and hard and endless beyond all memory of man. There came a night that lasted a generation, and kings shivered and died in their castles even as the swineherds in their hovels. Women smothered their children rather than see them starve, and cried, and felt their tears freeze on their cheeks.

In that darkness, the Others came for the first time  They were cold things, dead things, that hated iron and fire and the touch of the sun, and every creature with hot blood in its veins. They swept over holdfasts and cities and kingdoms, felled heroes and armies by the score, riding pale dead horses, and leading hosts of the slain. All the swords of men could not stay their advance, and even maidens and suckling babes, found no pity in them. They hunted the maids through the frozen forests, and fed their dead servants on the flesh of human children.

Now these were the days before the Andals came, and long before the women fled across the narrow sea from the cities of the Rhoyne, and the hundred kingdoms of those times were the kingdoms of the First Men, who had taken those lands from the children of the forest. Yet here and there in the fastness of the woods, the children still lived in their wooden cities and hollow hills, and the faces in the trees kept watch. So as cold and death filled the earth, the last hero determined to seek out the children, in the hopes that their ancient magics could win back what the armies of men had lost. He set out into the dead lands with a sword, a horse, a dog and a dozen companions. For years he searched until he despaired of ever finding the children of the forest in their secret cities. One by one his friends died, and his horse, and finally even his dog, and his sword froze so hard the blade snapped when he tried to use it. And the Others smelled the hot blood in him and came silent on his trail, stalking him with packs of pale white spiders big as hounds ""



I only bring this up because of this still from a post earlier in the week:

The Last Hero has twelve companions and went off to slay The Others.  The Night's King has twelve companions, and is an Other.  Is there perhaps a connection?

What are my resolutions, looking back at those?

* **Many characters got written off or merged** with others. Examples include the Tyrell brothers, Davos's other sons, Bloody Mummers and many more.
* Ros, although hated by many book readers, allowed for insight into minds of people that otherwise stayed out of the spotlight, like Theon, maester Pycelle or Littlefinger.
* Political nuances such as sizes of the armies and family allegiances are vastly absent from the show, and this is kinda key to the whole story.
* Bonus scenes on DVD include a lore reading that is really really helpful.
* **All characters got aged up**, adjusting their actions and troubles to our perception, but some traits could be justified by the actual book age (best example here is Daenerys, who's 14 at the start of Game of Thrones).
* Sex scenes are polarized - some are way overdone, some are in show even though they could be only implied in the book, and some got cut off entirely
* Writers dislike Stannis, while book readers are generally fond of him, which makes this character a poster boy for the reader fandom
* All the visions and prophecies due to the difference in written vs graphic media are greatly changed. This involves writing off characters such as Ghost of the High Heart and completely rewriting House of the Undying.

More on **HBO polarizes sex scenes** - some are overblown, while others are cut off:

* Renly's sexuality is only hinted, so is Stannis's relation to Melisandre, there are much much fewer brothel scenes and even though it's generally true to the story's spirit, it's definitely amped up. 
* Sometimes a consensual sex scene becomes a rape scene in TV - Jaime's rebound with Cersei is disputably rape nonetheless, but Dany's wedding night was definitely consensual in its form (although of course it was an arranged marriage).
* Cut out is everything involving an underage character whose age wasn't drastically changed - Sansa's puberty is a key plot point, so unlike Daenerys she couldn't get that much older. This means that everything involving her sexually got cut off, that being her wedding night with Tyrion (nothing happens, but they strip naked and she comments on his body), any dreams with sexual content and experiments with her female friends. 
* The attempted rape during riots in King's Landing stayed, though.

More on **Stannis**: He's a prime example of how a translation to the show format can alter or outright kill a character. Questionable decisions such as making show Stannis dependable on Melisandre sum up to presenting a character so different that it's difficult to easily explain his popularity among readers. Some points about the differences:

* Stannis never sentenced a man to die because of his beliefs (unlike in show). The man burning on stake was a traitor who tried to talk with the Lannisters behind his back and gain himself titles.
* Stannis is a declared atheist. *""I stopped believing in gods the day I saw the Windrpoud break up across the bay. Any gods so monstrous as to down my mother and father would never have my worship, I vowed. In King's Landing, the High Septon would prattle at me of how all justice and goodness flowed from the Seven, but all I ever saw of either was made by men.""*
* Stannis is hugely burdened by his past. He was neglected by his own brothers and yet remained loyal to their every request. His envy of Ned and sadness emanate from his every chapter.
* Stannis is really devoid of greed - he seeks for the crown because he feels he has to. *""I am king. Wants do not enter into it. I have a duty to my daughter. To the realm. Even to Robert. He loved me but little, I know, yet he was my brother. The Lannister woman gave him horns and made a motley fool of him. She may have murdered him as well, as she murdered Jon Arryn and Ned Stark. For such crimes there must be justice. Starting with Cersei and her abominations. But only starting. I mean to scour that court clean. As Robert should have done after the Trident.""*
* As a reader, you get to realize the extent of the war and the damage it deals to the common folk (more locations, more people, more stories). That brings out opinions such as ""hey, maybe he's not likeable, but he wouldn't really be bad at this and he would definitely kill all the bad guys"".
* Most of Stannis's dry one-liners got lost in the translation to the show, but they were quite common. The closest the show got to that was the scene where Stannis described how he was forced to eat livestock in Storm's End, throwing in comments like ""Never liked cats, so fine"". Many homorous scenes come from the narration: *""I am not a man without mercy"", said he who was notoriously merciless*
* Stannis shares all his moral dilemmas with Davos and his constantly aware of anything questionable about his decisions. Killing Renly still haunts him.

&gt; *""Renly offered me a peach. At our parley. Mocked me, defied me, threatened me, and offered me a peach. I thought he was drawing a blade and went for mine own. Was that his purpose, to make me show fear? Or was it one of his pointless jests? When he spoke of how sweet the peach was, did his words have some hidden meaning?"" The king gave a shake of his head, like a dog shaking a rabbit to snap its neck. ""Only Renly could vex me so with a piece of fruit. he brought his doom on himself with his treason, but I did love him, Davos. I know that now. I swear, I will go to my grave thinking of my brother's peach.""*

All in all, Stannis and Ros get most love and hate from readers because they're the most drastic cases of controversial adaptation. Stannis isn't perfect (damn, the whole point is that he's not supposed to be likeable) and Ros wasn't as bad as some readers would imply (although some scenes were really, really questionable, see *""Play with her arse""*), but the differences were significant enough to make those two a general symbol for reader scepticism.

I'd write more on **visions and prophecies**, but surprisingly enough I've exceeded the character limit - and it's a kinda spoilerish topic, anyway.",23,256,False,self,,,,,

So there's this kid at my job who is SUPER annoying and goes around trying to talk about anything with anyone.  He usually comes by, and asks if anyone's heard about whatever the current news story on yahoo is.  If he knows anything personal about you he will bring it up every time to make small talk. I don't mind shooting the shit but this kid has nothing better to do and doesn't care if you're up to your ears in work he will not take a hint.  Imagine having to deal with this 5 days a week.  Anyway I digress so let me get to the fucking point here.  This kid recently found out we all watch GoT and decided to start watching them so he has something else to talk about.  Apparently he's all caught up with the show and stopped by like 10 minutes ago and starts talking about the show (he's been out all week and this is first day back).  He then begins to ""speculate"" about what's going to happen on the show and it sounded waay to detailed for him to just come up with by himself.  So I said ""you didn't read some spoilers and are just here ruining the fucking show for me are you?"" he said no but then immediately left.  Can someone please tell me if what this jerkoff said is about to happen?  I don't want any details, just a ""Yes, this kid is a fucking douchebag"" or ""No, you're good dude"".    
  
So here were his predictions:  
  
1.  He thinks that the Highgarden Grandmother (the almost future queens grandma) and Ned Stark's sister in law (sky castle / breastfeeder) have a deal to get Sansa back which is part of why Joffrey was poisoned.  
  
2. He thinks Jamie is going to take the blame for Joffries death and that's why he sent away Brienna so she wouldn't be hurt in the ensuing shitstorm after he confesses.

Not because it didn't interest me, I just wasn't really in the mood for fantasy. I had just finished The Dark Tower and was kind of drained on series afterward. Cut forward a few years and I become absolutely engrossed in the show. So I picked up the books again sometime after season 3 and blew through them in 3 months time. 

I was worried I would be bored up until A Storm of Swords since I watched the show but I couldn't have been more wrong. I enjoyed the story I already knew just as much as the new(for me) content. Maybe even more so.

I really wish I would have picked up the books sooner. I fucking love the show, it's what started my fascination with the world of ASoIaF but I really do wish I could have experienced certain plots through text first.

I suppose I'm rambling. My question is, since you all really love the story, enough so you participate in an online message board revolving around it, what has stopped you from reading the books? Time? Not into reading? Don't want to spoil the show? Sick of people saying ""Read the books""?

Edit: Seems like there are some legitimate reasons. Don't want to start an unfinished series, can't find/commit the time etc. Others...not so much, it's too long, don't want to ruin the show. I feel like some are really underestimating how good these novels are. ",168,45,False,self,,,,,

Now I've only just recently started playing D&amp;D, and so if I watched this episode a few months ago my reaction would have been, ""oh, that's pretty cool."" But now that I've been involved in some epic games, this had me thinking....

Thinking about Dany's progress as a character, I noticed that almost every main character and story is built around this: losing control of things, their actions and the reprecussions of those actions in the immediate and greater scope. Everyone either gets tangled up in affairs bigger than they can handle (eg Ned, Theon) or fails to realize the consequences of what they do. The few characters that aren't in direct trouble seem to be setting themselves up for something to catch up with them in the future. I find this fascinating because on GRRM's universe I know that there is *not* going to be a heroic redemption arc for every character and characters no matter of their apparent importance *do* face the consequences of their actions sooner or later.



Cases past and present, done or ongoing:

- Ned's problems in King's Landing, this is straightforward. He only went there for a boring office job, with an uncertain hint of conspiracy.

- Robb's losing control of his responsibilities, his emotions, his men, and the war. 

- Cat doing increasingly desperate things worried for her children, all in vain.

- Jon from episode 1 until he returned to Castle Black, in the end he got out of this but it was chaotic and didn't end well at all. Now it looks like he is set up for round two.

- Sam does this after Gilly, he wants to protect her but this put the Night's Watch, Jon, and now Gilly herself in trouble. He is one of the characters that didn't make any blatantly wrong choices but it is not like he ever had options, things keep getting out of hand around him. He was done well so far compared to others.

- Theon, the definition of this every step of the way. He brought this unto himself until Ramsay decided to show him how deconstructing a character is *really* done. I am waiting to see ~~if~~ how it can get any worse for him.

- Sansa digging herself into a deeper and deeper hole and everyone helping her do it

- Cersei's mental state among the chaos. This won't end well, nope.

- Jamie's growing alienated from his family and his former self, he is only starting to realize it I think. Increasingly not sure of who he is anymore.

- Tyrion going from being snide to King's Landing affairs and characters to actually caring and taking an active part in them, making more enemies along the way. Now this blew up on his face and no one who matters is willing to support him.

- Stannis has steadily been growing more desperate and relying on Melisandre. Deep down he hates everything around him but suffers it all the same. Digging himself deeper in what seems to be a destructive course of events.

- Dany, where to start. She has done well so far but she is increasingly violent, overconfident to the point where she probably sees herself as the infallible embodiment of justice. She is starting to have problems with the dragons (her very first scene in Season 4 - foreshadowing? If this isn't a direct in-your-face threat then I don't know what is) and her more reasonable advisors keep warning her more and more... I think this is going towards chaos and I like it. Also appropriate for a Targaryen, and book readers like to point out how madness runs in the Targ House's inbred blood. Note also that she seems to be charismatic - or at least irressistible to men - but other than her close circle her followers are all former slaves, they would have followed anyone who set them free. Even if she had done so without all the bloodshed.

- The Hound, although he has stopped caring about anything and this helps him cope very well, it is easy to forget that his actions made him an enemy of basically everyone. He was Kingsguard, now he is a deserter, a serial killer and a traitor.

- Arya, I am not sure about this one. For a sweet little girl, she is fucked up beyond redemption. But here is the thing, she is ok with that as much as a 13 year old can be, in fact this is the only course for her and she wants to pursue it. Death all along, until she meets hers or settles down... ha ha.

There are many other characters whose stories may yet backfire, but these are the examples I can think right now that have got themselves into a downwards spiral one way or another. Pretty much a core theme in GoT - this is not your typical heroic fantasy saga (although a certain other pale, white-haired dragon-riding prince from a former magical empire comes to mind).",2,9,False,self,,,,,

Do you think that the armies compare in quality? For example the unsullied should be more fearless and dedicated in battle than knights of Westeros, but not as well equipped.

Obviously there's no way to know for sure, but I think he's being very discreet about it on purpose due to the fans' reaction to his optimistic estimates the last time around.

I know that some of the characters have been cut, e.g. Strong Belwas (and perhaps some others, I don't read the books but keep up with most of them with the ASOIAF wiki), and (at least so far) her travelling companions's storylines have been altered. For example, in the books, Barristan Selmy didn't reveal himself until right before the assault on Meereen, and it didn't come to light that Jorah had been an informant for King Robert around the same time either, but in the show, we knew it was Barristan Selmy right away (for logical reasons; you can't see faces in a book but you can in a television show), and, so far, no one knows that Jorah was an informant besides himself, Quaithe, and the people he was reporting to.

Do you think that they are just going to cut Jorah's deception out of the show? They certainly did with Barristan (for obvious reasons), but I just don't know. And in the episode teaser for S4E5, it seems that Dany is already talking with her four ""counsel members"" (Jorah, Barristan, Daario, and Grey Worm) about how she might be able to lead an attack on King's Landing.

Thoughts? Ideas? I'm mainly concerned with Jorah, because if he doesn't get found out, then he won't be there to kidnap Tyrion, who will flee across the Narrow Sea (presumably).",19,5,False,self,,,,,

I'm working on creating a set of custom cards for **A Game of Thrones: The Boardgame** and was thinking of adding a little flavor text to the House Cards. However, since I don't have the books on me at the moment, I'm asking you to help me find some cool quotes by certain characters.

I'll just give you the list of the characters by their house and you feel free to add a quote to them, but PLEASE do not put quotes with possible spoilers. I also added some quotes I thought were cool, but if you know of a better or more appropriate quote, by all means, do share.

I realize that it's possible that some characters will not have any cool quotes to their name. If that's true, I'll either drop the whole flavor text idea or find new characters to replace them.

Also, I'm looking for quotes from the books. If you're thinking of suggesting a quote which was uttered only on the show, please reconsider.

**House Baratheon**

*Stannis Baratheon* - I shall bring justice to Westeros.

*Ser Richard Horpe* 

*Ser Davos Seaworth* - King Stannis is my god. He made me and blessed me with his trust.

*Ser Axell Florent*

*Melisandre* - The night is dark, and full of terrors

*Salladhor Saan* - 

*Selyse Baratheon*

**House Greyjoy**

*Balon Greyjoy* - I am the Greyjoy, Lord Reaper of Pyke, King of Salt and Rock, Son of the Sea Wind, and no man gives me a crown. I pay the iron price. I will take my crown, as Urron Redhand did five thousand years ago.

*Victarion Greyjoy*- Come kill me, if you can.

*Andrik the Unsmiling*

*Theon Greyjoy* - Only a fool humbles himself when the world is so full of men eager to do that job for him.

*Asha Greyjoy*

*Dagmer Cleftjaw*

*Aeron Damphair* - What is dead may never die, but rises again, harder and stronger.

**House Lannister**

*Tywin Lannister* - Some battles are won with swords and spears, others with quills and ravens.

*Ser Jaime Lannister* - There are no men like me, There's only me.

*Ser Gregor Clegane* - A man who sees nothing has no use for his eyes, cut them out and give them to your next outrider. Tell him you hope that four eyes might see better than two ... and if not, the man after him will have six.

*The Hound* - A hound will die for you, but never lie to you.

*Ser Kevan Lannister* - A man who fights for coin is only loyal to his purse.

*Tyrion Lannister* - A mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone if it is to keep its edge.

*Cersei Lannister* - When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground.

**House Martell**

*The Red Viper* - 

*Areo Hotah* - Serve, Obey, Protect.

*Obara Sand* - 

*Quentyn Martell*

*Nymeria Sand*

*Arianne Martell*

*Doran Martell* - Words are like arrows, once loosened you cannot call them back.

**House Stark**

*Robb Stark* - If you keep all your treasures in one purse, you only make it easier for those who would rob you.

*The Greatjon* - Why shouldn't we rule ourselves? It was the dragons we married, and now the dragons are all dead.

*Roose Bolton* - Power tastes best when sweetened by courtesy.

*Dacey Mormont* or *Maege Mormont* (haven't decided yet which one, although I'd prefer Dacey)

*Ser Rodrick Cassel* - When we speak of the morrow nothing is ever certain.

*The Blackfish* - My first rule of war is never give the enemy his wish.

*Catelyn Stark* - I want to write an end to this. I want to go home, my lords, and weep for my husband.

**House Tyrell**

*Mace Tyrell* - Is there anything as pointless as a king without a kingdom?

*Ser Loras Tyrell*  

*Ser Garlan Tyrell*

*Randyll Tarly* - It takes more than a pretty cloak to charge a shield wall.

*Margaery Tyrell* - I know what a burden you bear. You should let me share the load.

*Paxter Redwyne*

*Queen of Thorns* - There is entirely too much tut-tutting in this realm, if you ask me. All these kings would do a deal better if they put down their swords and listened to their mothers.",14,5,False,self,,,,,

Here's a reference picture: http://imgur.com/v1UJP0y

So the circumstance of these events are when JON SNUH and Sam the Slayer go beyond the wall to swear their vows in front of the weirwood.  Now I recall reading this (and now re-watching), and it mentioned that the weirwood tree looked like it was crying.  If you look at the reference image, there are bloody tears.

Now for the tinfoil, I feel like this is Bran crying.  As mentioned by bloodraven, weirwood trees are timeless.  I'm thinking that sometime in the future, when Bran does achieve his final form, he finds out about the ""death"" of JON SNUH (he knows nothing).  He simply reaches into the weirwood, and glimpses into the past of Jon swearing his vows.  Bran turns emotional and cries whilst still in the weirwood tree.

I haven't read the books but I'm going to make some ""predictions."" So far she has:
**Ser Jorrah Lord of the Friendzone.** We haven't really seen him fight a lot, but he is definitely badass.
**Ser Barristan.** From what Ned and Jaime have said this guy is among the best fighters in Westeros. 
**Grey Worm.** fights like hes 300 and has a romantic possibility with Danny's interpreter .
**Dario.** With his titty knife he already killed the peeing champion, expert at knife throwing and be tricksy. 

I have no idea if anyone of these people will join the A-team but if any do I'm calling it a victory:
**The Hound.** He mentioned at one point he was considering join the Second Sons which we know are being employed by Danny.
**Arya Stark.** Maybe she meets up with Jaqen H'ghar again and she teaches her how to be a badass assassin. 
**Jaqen H'ghar.** After he teachs Arya the ways of the force/ faceless men the pair go on an adventure and meet up with Danny and Co.
**Brienne.** Off trying to get Sansya back, maybe she hears that Arya is across the sea in Braavos and goes to get her
**Podrick.** Follows Brienne.
**Tyrion.** Assuming he survives his trial, he is exiled from Westeros he meets up with Danny and amuses the A-team with his witty banter.

Together the A-team and Danny + dragons take back King's Landing and all is well until the White Walkers come. The walkers and their zombie army destroy the North. The armies of the north have trouble killing them because the zombies can only be killed by fire. If only we had something that could produce large amounts of fire!! Oh wait Danny has 3 dragons. The dragons breath their fire over the zombie army while Ser jorrah drops wild fire on them. Well at least that's how see it going.

But after he lost it, even last season in the scene where he fights Locke's men, people were complaining that he fights *too* well.  And I'm hearing it moreso now.  Take a look at the scene from last week's episode, where he's training with Bronn:

It looks like he's doing a hell of a lot better than the first time, and while Bronn seems to be going easy and Jaime's not nearly as impressive as when he had both hands, we're seeing some of that cockiness of the old Jaime again.  I'm also wondering if maybe Bronn's lesson about fighting dirty is foreshadowing; perhaps Jaime is going to use his hand to his advantage in the future to even the odds a bit?

I'm not to the point in the books where Jaime's hand gets cut off, but I've read the spoilers and some excerpts, and from the looks of it, the loss of his right hand essentially removes ALL of Jaime's fighting ability, to the point where he's basically reduced to the level of a child swinging a sword for the first time, right?

Well, I just don't buy it.  He's supposed to be, like, the greatest swordsman in the entire world, or at least a top contender, correct?  A natural with prodigal innate talent and decades of nonstop training and combat experience?  He never once trained with his left hand at all?  And even if he didn't, we're supposed to believe that **none** of that unsurpassed talent transfers over when he becomes a leftie?  I mean, I can believe that losing his dominant hand would knock Jaime out of the Barristan Selmy/Hound category of skill forever, and this would take a huge toll on his ego.  But I have a much harder time believing that he loses ALL of his ability and has to start over from scratch.  I've never engaged in any real-life swordsmanship, and I don't know what an appropriate comparison might be (although, I doubt actual swordplay looked much of anything like we see on the show).  But regardless, when you're talking about that level of experience and skill, it really seems to me that after an initial adjustment period, he'd still be a much more formidable fighter than most people.

So it sounds to me like the show really has it right, and the book approach is another example of GRRM's tendency to fuck over characters excessively and drive home this point about how Jaime loses his identity as a fighter, et cetera.  Certainly, the show approach may set us up for some entertaining moments in the future.  What do you all think?",26,32,False,self,,,,,

It was a web comic (it's called ""Critical Intel"" if you're wondering) that I sometimes read that usually only focuses on the reactions to the show and thus I was under the assumption that it wouldn't have any book spoilers. But when I read the comic this week, the ending panel was a HUGE spoiler from Book 5, I think is what it said it was from. I accidentally scrolled down and I think I saw comments confirm it which freaked me out and immediately unplugged my computer cord. Now I won't explain what it is since I'm still trying to repress it (though it's not working too well hence why I'm writing this) and just in case any other non-book readers clicks on this looking for help, (I will say that it about a certain Lannister) but it's really getting to me. Similarly, one of my classmates spoiled the Purple Wedding for me around a year ago (before the Red Wedding which thankfully wasn't spoiled for me) and I started dwelling on it daily and eventually weekly. I really don't want this to turn into the same kind of case if the spoiler I think is true is actually true since it will take about 2-3 years (maybe 4 if they split AFFC into two seasons which I hope they don't) to confirm my suspicions/fears. I knew back then that the obvious answer to solving that, and thus the spoiler I'm complaining about now, would have been to stop thinking about it, focus on something else, or (my personal favorite) have someone say, ""Dude, it's just a show. Get a life."" but my mind doesn't necessarily work like that. Since I'm a huge fan of the show, and I see it appear everyday on the internet/popular culture, I can't escape its grasp on me. I tried to wean myself off it and go cold turkey last summer after season 3 ended in order to take my mind off ""The Purple Wedding"" but GoT just kept coming up in places where I thought I would be safe from it. The triggers for it were plentiful in real life as it would be a point of discussion in some random internet show, I would see a wall and think of The Night's Watch, someone would bring it up to me to make small talk knowing I was a fan etc. Also what I should note is that I have a, and I'm not trying to ""brag/toot my own horn"" about this, really good memory/recall about things I care about and GoT absolutely falls into this category and I know something this big will stay in my mind for a long time.

So if you're still reading, first off thank you for reading my plight but, all I'm asking is that you can give me some advice/comfort to ""move on"" for lack of a better term and get my mind off of this spoiler. I don't necessarily want to read the books now (I definitely will once it's a completed book series or the final one is like a few months away from release) since I hate spoilers and I love seeing things on the show develop and not know what's going to happen. I also REALLY DON'T WANT to see a bunch or replies spoiling other parts of the books in order to get my mind off of this certain spoiler since that would only make it worse for me. As much as I would love to find out that the web-comic's spoiler is a joke and completely false, as it would make me sleep easier (yes I am actually losing some sleep over this as I'm typing this at 2 AM, so make of that what you will) at night, I have a feeling this isn't so since Martin has a sadistic fondness for killing off characters that are relatable like the victims of ""The Red Wedding"" for instance. I also want to block it off by trying to focus on how awesome certain things could be like (and please don't spoil even if the caption does say ""All Spoilers"" which was just to get your attention) Dragons, White Walkers, Bran becoming Professor X and being able to use mind powers in order to fly or something, or Rickon growing up into a total badass and being the best of Ned &amp; Robb, or (and being totally pervy here to be honest) Sansa &amp; Margarey Tyrell switching ""teams"" per-say for each other. I mean they're both pretty messed up at this point with men ya know after the torturing that Sansa endured and how Margarey is starting to give Elizabeth Taylor a run for her diamonds in the marriage department with two dead husbands and still having her virginity intact. I mean that same-sex scene would definitely be something interesting to film (since they've already had two guys going at it who weren't in a brothel) and it would make sense in how their characters developed in Season 3, but I can only hope. And why, yes I do realize how much of a pig that made me out to be, but I've been trying to think of a way to get that Margarey/Liz Taylor joke in there and I need some crude/dry humor to retain attention after I've gone on about my dilemma for long enough.

So in closing, all I'm trying to get is just a little bit of help in how to get rid of this info (or try as hard as I can to block it off) or move on from this since I think it's starting to get a bit unhealthy for my psyche, with the whole losing sleep thing, to obsess about something this much especially when this isn't something in the real world, but then again, I'm a proud geek and will always love to geek out about GoT for as long as I can. So thank you again for reading this, and going through my ""interesting little theories"" and I look forward to any advice that you might share. (or hope that I don't get called out for being ""A Misogynist Pig"" a thousand times by a bunch of Andrea Dworkin wannabes in the comments) Thank you for reading this.

After seen this image: http://imgur.com/LeHXbBz in which it seems like the peasant is taking the bones of his daughter to Daenerys I stared wondering about how Dany's arc is going to end this season.

According to the actor CV he worked in an episode directed by Alex Graves which means that this happens either in episode 8 or 10 and it makes sense to think that this situation will lead to Daenerys chaining the dragons.

We also know Jorah has to be exiled this season and this image pretty much confirms he will: http://imgur.com/L8HTJWV Scene that was also filmed by Alex Graves (so episode 8 or 10 again)

With all this info I think that somehow Jorah's banishment and the chaining of the dragons (if it happens) are going to be two connected events. Any opinions in how all this can work out? Maybe Dany and Jorah have a huge fight about the Dragons and Dany begins to doubt him? Could it be Jorah the one in charge of chaining the Dragons ? That could replace in a way the deadly mission she send him after she founds out about his betrayal. And how is she going to find out? Any speculation about all this?

Still, I don't know which plot point is part of which book exactly, so I'll tag everything with ""all"", just to be safe. So please don't read these spoilers if you haven't read all of the books, I don't want to ruin anything.  

Unfortunately, I know about [all](#s ""the Lady Stoneheart arc"") already and the significance of Thoros of Myr and [all](#s ""Beric Dondarrion"") in that story. We've seen both of these characters in Season 3 and the show made a pretty big point in showcasing the resurrecting abilities of R'hllor. 
So my question is: Could the mere fact that Thoros and his powers have been part of the show be indication that [all](#s ""Lady Stoneheart"") will appear on the show as well - or do they hold any other significance to the overall story I'm not seeing? 

The only other reason to implement this character in the show's slimmed down narrative would be some character coming back to life in the future. And yes, [all](#s ""I unfortunately know about the fate of Jon Snow as well - do you think he could be the one being brought back to life through R'hllor - if he *is* dead?"")

With everything going on, seems like sending a person to the wall for poaching game would be severe.  Also seems like someone from the Dreadfort would have taken the black in the last few years (there are men from the Iron Islands there, so even marginalized houses send men to the wall).  Maybe not, maybe Roose dealt with problems in a different stroke(s).  However, given that Locke is a semi important person, wouldn't some member of the Nightswatch know his true origin? Given that the the events of the red wedding and Roose becoming the warden of the north is known to the watch, I'm not sure how Locke's story could not raise a few eyebrows. ",47,70,False,self,,,,,

(In terms of rating it in a site like IMDb)


**On one side**, one can argue that different medium = different criteria so Game of Thrones should be judged relative to other TV shows only. The show relies on visual and audio factors while the books rely on text. A great example of this would probably be the Sack of Astapor. In the show, you've got things like the synchonized music-dracarys effect. In the books, you've got things like internal monologue that adds effect. Both different but both hold their own. 


**On the other side**, one can argue that the differences in the characters and plots can diverge from the author's intent and messages. A good example of this would probably be the Jaime-Cersei ""rape"" scene. This diverges from the point GRRM was trying to make --if a character has done some horrible things, how far must he go to redeem himself and can he truly redeem himself? Does it truly make the show-writers' intent invalid just because they diverged from the author's intent? What if they discovered a new perspective of a character/plot that the author missed out on? What if the character/plot development still made sense for the show as a standalone? 


What are your thoughts? There are probably more arguments to be said on both side.",17,0,False,self,,,,,

THAT WAS NOT A TYPO.

---

So I think, instead of dealing with the whole story about Lady Stoneheart getting revenge on random redshirt Frey, her reveal is going to be when Brienne meets her in AFFC, and possibly end with Brienne's hanging. By cutting out the Locke sideplot with her, as well as her meeting Pod on the road, we may be able to get through her story with the whole Randyl Tarly scenes and all and get to this point. This will also save time on a scene we wouldn't necessarily need, if it is done this way. What do you think?

Rather than crafting a well-reasoned write up on what exactly the whole arc means for the series, I'm just gonna copy a comment of mine from elsewhere which lists all my problems with it, and maybe you guys can patch up some of the holes or point out some of your own.


My main issue with this arc is that to me it required that several characters be possessed by the ghost of plot necessity to do completely irrational things:

Bran and co. somehow veering miles and miles west after exiting the Nightfort

Jon and Sam miraculously inferring this bizarre move (using the unaccountable reasoning that the unpopulated wildling villages would somehow be a PROBLEM rather than a boon for a small party seeking shelter, and that Bran and co. either knew about C's or would be irresistibly attracted to its unique shelter-providing properties) Also, note: this dubious deduction had no apparent bearing on Jon's decision to raid C's; it occurred only so that Locke could happen by at the perfect moment and hear it. So the necessities of Locke's arc are exerting some fucky influence here too -- Jon and Sam wouldn't have needed to go temporarily brain dead if the writer's weren't intent of grafting on the stark-hunt storyline.

Jon deciding that raiding C's would be a good use of Watch resources, when 1.) he had just lectured about the necessity of sidelining the desire for vengeance in the preceding episode and 2.) maintaining his lie WRT the Watch's numbers would have no clear effect on Mance's attack strategy. It seems like the guy plans to just, you know, attack.

Also, Summer getting caught in a trap was just such a blatant fucking plot device. The writer's needed Bran captured, but obviously this could never happen without his wolf being either killed or incapacitated. So we get an inexplicable plot trap. Why did the mutineers have a second direwolf trap in place? We'll never know...

Lastly, someone pointed out that Locke seems to have been attempting to carry Bran all the way back to his master...which is just ludicrous for obvious reasons. Another blatant suspense tactic. Edit: A couple of people have pointed out that he may have been preparing to interrogate Bran as to the location of Rickon, which makes sense. I guess my vitriol got the better of me.

There doesn't seem to be anything else going for them. Where does their food come from? I look at maps and it seems like the area borders on desert and the red waste. Is it even possible for them to have nearby farms to support the whole of their respective populations?

I can't help but imagine their entire economy, and existence, it based on the trade of slaves in return for necessary goods, like food. Now that they have lost their chief, if only, export ... can they even subsist in isolation without those imports?

Have the cities enough stockpiled riches to pay for imports until a local subsistence economy can be created from whole cloth, the ground up, in an area perhaps not best suited for it? Are the uprisings in the other two cities because of greed, or because without slaves it's just a fact of life that everyone will die starving?

Will Dany discover that sometimes ruling means accepting hard truths? Or is this all ignored because there are more important things like dragons and conquest and secret assassinations to focus on?",4,4,False,default,,,,,

I've only read to the point in AFFC after she meets Sam, but I've peeked ahead and I don't think they'll ask Maisi Williams to do half of the stuff Arya does in Braavos. I don't think she's going to Braavos. For one, she should already be there. Two, Stannis is going to Braavos next episode (it appears) so why would he get there before her? Three, my patience is running thin on these storylines being no closer to resolving, and it seems Arya is the best candidate to dish out some Stark revenge.

I've also peeked ahead to what happens to Walder Frey and as I can tell nothing except more of his brood dies. It's not like Lord Walder is Sauron, and at this point whenever he dies it could very well be just shaving hours away from his natural death. I know I want to see Walder Frey dead right now, but who is left in the game to serve this justice? It could be Brienne, it could be Stoneheart, but who the hell else is Arya supposed to kill? How many TV viewers will have the patience to see her go even farther from her few remaining marks?

There's also the Hound to consider. Will TV viewers be happy once he and Arya split and he just vanishes into rumor? Everyone has already said how they wish they could just see this pair on their adventures, so if I were a showrunner I would probably choose this as the time to part ways with the book in terms of Arya's story because she and the Hound are pure gold.

I don't care about spoilers because I think the show is going to make an effort to separate itself from the books beyond the Red Wedding. Factors include ending the show in 7 seasons, but even 8 would never possibly cover all the content in AFFC, ADWD, TWOW, and ADOS in ways that appease book purists. If it is 7 seasons then they have to cram all of AFFC and ADWD into season 5, leaving little time for any character to follow their book storyline. The biggest factor is the age of the child actors who started out older than they should have and will be close to their 20s by series end. Plus, most TV viewers still don't know most of the houses or names of important characters, so how can the producers possibly think they can grow the show much larger than it already is?

Speaking to that last point, while all the political intrigue of the warring houses makes for good TV, it's funny that none of it matters once winter arrives. So will the showrunners really keep going two more seasons of not getting us much closer to the end game? We all want to see Cersei, Walder Frey, and the Boltons get what's coming to them, but the guy we saw at the end of the last episode is the real enemy.

And every day it looks more and more certain that the show will finish before the books. If that is the case, wouldn't the books only work if things end differently than they do in the show? It would certainly be ironic since GRRM is on record saying he dislikes fanfiction when the show of his own book could be an alternate version of his work. Book purists and fans will buy the book regardless, but his publishers won't be happy if the show spoils their book because the fact is that some will not bother with the books if they already know the end.",5,1,False,self,,,,,

My friend and I are debating the scene in which Arya and the Hound are debating in the morning about how to sword-fight.

Anyway, Arya ends the conversation by trying to plunge Needle right into the Hound, but he was wearing armor.

**Did the sword actually pierce The Hound's armor?**

In ASOS, the Hound is involved in a skirmish at an Inn with Polliver &amp; Co. (much like the scene in E1), and sustains a pretty bad wound.  Arya leaves the Hound to die a slow, painful, and merciless death, and it's implied that he's killed off.

We know that the show only has 5 episodes left, and the final 2-3 episodes are usually ""event"" episodes (like the Blackwater episode).  And we need to deal with the Hound somehow getting wounded, the depiction of the wound festering, the final exchange between Arya and the Hound, etc.

So, this would be a way for The Hound to be ""killed"" by Arya....

Arya and the Hound are debating about sword-fighting.   Arya ends the conversation by trying to plunge Needle right into the Hound, but he was wearing armor.

**Did the sword actually pierce The Hound's armor?**

Because if it did, then we get the possibility of the Hound beginning to show signs of weakening in the next episode.

In ASOS, the Hound is involved in a skirmish at an Inn with Polliver &amp; Co. (much like the scene in E1), and sustains a pretty bad wound.  Arya leaves the Hound to die a slow, painful, and merciless death, and it's implied that he's killed off.

We know that the show only has 5 episodes left, and the final 2-3 episodes are usually ""event"" episodes (like the Blackwater episode).  And we need to deal with the Hound somehow getting wounded, the depiction of the wound festering, the final exchange between Arya and the Hound, etc.

So, this would be a way for The Hound to be ""killed"" by Arya....

I have an idea from the preview and what we have seen from Jaime this season and from what happened a long time ago in season 1 at the Eyrie where Tyrion requested Jaime stand for him in a trial by combat. This wasn't allowed as the trial had to be that day and Jaime would have to travel there from Kings Landing. Bronn told Jaimie that Tyrion asked for him at the Eyrie and this persuaded Jaime to go and visit Tyrion.

In season 4 at the minute, we are seeing Jaime becomes better with his left hand, and possibly as good as he once was with his right.

In the preview we hear Jaime say: ""This isn't a trial, this is a farce""

I believe that Jaime will stand for Tyrion in trial by combat at the trial for Joffs murder.

Welcome to the weekly followup for non-readers, meant to let the show watchers catch up with some useful trivia from the book and take a look back at some context shown in earlier episodes.

**TL;DR: Useful background - Reader's point of view - Scene-by-scene systematics - Lame jokes in headlines - Stannis fandom**

---

###Oh I Just Can't Wait To Be King

&gt; *If you ever call me ""sister"" again, I'll have you strangled in your sleep* - Cersei, one season ago  
*How shall I call you? ""Sister""?* - Margaery, either incredibly brave or incredibly stupid

* Tommen is the first king of Westeros with that name, but not the first king Tommen in history - Tommen was a name of at least two kings of the Rock before Aegon Targaryen's conquest. Tommen II was lost in Valyria along with his Valyrian steel sword Brightroar - since then, until the reforging of Ice, Lannisters didn't have a family weapon.

* Note how the Baratheon sigil fades from view. Due to Cersei's regency, Joffrey and Tommen have been ruling under the joined banner of houses Lannister and Baratheon, but two seasons ago the Baratheon stag was coloured black on a yellow field. Silver on a yellow field is a Baratheon color as well, but much less visible. You can also compare Tommen's pompuously red clothing (this week, he covered all his yellow vest in a red cape) to Joffrey's, who kept wearing yellow quite distinctly.

* Baratheon presence in the court is next to zero - Stannis still keeps control of Storm's End, the Baratheon family nest, and even though after the failed siege of King's Landing many lords of the Stormlands have bent the knee to Joffrey, Stormlands as a whole are outside of Lannister control as long as Storm's End holds. Also, some prominent figures like Beric Dondarrion have been fighting against the Lannisters, and there isn't a major Stormland family to replace Baratheons, especially since the solution would be temporary - Baratheon name and legacy would eventually fall back to Tommen's progeny.

* I've already explained numerous times how POV chapters work, but let me repeat myself: we se the events of the book through the eyes of certain characters. In King's Landing, it's Ned, Arya, Sansa, Tyrion and now Jaime - to the point, show allows us to see much more of Tywin. Lannisters being broke is a surprise to book readers as well, especially since crown was said to be in debt to house Lannister not so long ago.

* In case you haven't noticed, Cersei plotting with father, exceptionally not being a bitch to Tyrells and casually talking with Oberyn is coincidentally related to the names of the three judges in Tyrion's trial.

###Smart-Ass Edgy Reference to Iraq or Libya

&gt; *I will not sail for Westeros* - Daenerys Tararyen, delivering the most disappointing line in history of the show

* ""The Lannisters have more* - but not the navy. Lannister navy is pretty much nonexistent since Tyrion sacrificed it in Blackwater Bay. In the show, it's one ship carrying wildfire - in the books, Tyrion baits Stannis by sending the whole Lannister fleet against him and then setting both sides aflame.

* ""10 000 men can't conquer Westeros"" - They can. Three centuries before, Aegon the Conqueror had 3 000 men. And three big-ass dragons. As in, WAY bigger than Dany's. I mean dragons here, not ass. Speaking of the latter, he also wasn't alone - he had his two sister-wives. Way to Kickstart a dynasty.

* ""Old houses"" - Realistically at this point Tyrells are too invested in the Lannister regime to turn against them. Boltons are another beneficients of the Lannisters, and currently they are very busy taking control of the North - they might switch sides again, but can't rally the Northmen to anyone's cause yet. Starks, Baratheons and Tullys are either dispersed, imprisoned or dead - and none of them would ever join a Targaryen after that whole rebellion thing. The only free players at this point are Greyjoys, who don't care about anyone, Martells, who just struck a sweet deal with Lannisters by taking Myrcella as a host in Sunspear, and Arryns, who, of course, still won't lift a finger, as they haven't during the War of the Five Kings.

Speaking of which...

###Cuckoo's Nest

&gt; *Mummy says they killed your mother and chopped off your borther's head* - Robin Arryn, managing to take over the title of the most despicable child in TV in just one sentence

* Have you even grasped the extent of what has just been revealed?

* In case you've already forgot those people, feel free to learn to hate them all over again. We've seen Eyrie back in season 1, when Catelyn brought Tyrion here. Arryns have ruled over the Vale for *thousands* of years. They were one of the first Andals in Westeros - Andals are the civilization who brought the Faith of the Seven and populated the South. Northmen descend from the First Men.

* Sansa goes under the name *Alayne Stone*. Stone is a common name for bastards in the Vale, as much as Snow is in the north. Petyr himself is from the Fingers (hence his nickname), part of the Vale, hence Alayne's tie to the Vale.

* Robin's name in the book is Robert. Jon Arryn named his son after his ward Robert Baratheon, just like Ned Stark named his son Bran after his brother Brandon - and Robb after Robert. Jon Snow is named after Jon Arryn, of course. As long as one of the characters is dead, it's OK for the show, but to avoid confusion, some names have been altered.

* Brandon Stark, Ned's older brother, was supposed to be Catelyn's husband. Petyr challenged him to a duel for her hand and lost. Brandon lost his life when he came with his father Rickard to King's Landing demanding prince Rhaegar to return his sister Lyanna Stark. Rhaegar's father, Aerys ""Mad King"" Targaryen, had them both executed in a very gruesome way. The scene almost made it to the show's pilot and was even featured in the first trailers.

* Eyrie is where the rebellion started when Jon Arryn refused to hand over his wards Robert Baratheon and Eddard Stark to King's Landing. They allied with Tullys through marriage of Ned (who took over his brother's engagement) and Jon (who married Lysa mostly to do her father a favour), and, long story short, won. Ned, devastated by his family's death (he lost everyone but his brother Benjen), came back home to the North, and Jon Arryn stayed in King's Landing as Hand of the King to Robert Baratheon.

* Book makes a stop in the family house of Baelish in the Fingers, where Lysa waits for them, eager to marry Petyr as soon as possible. Tiny size of the keep emphasizes both the social advancement of Littlefinger and awkwardness of Sansa hearing her aunt's screams.

* Okay, so now **this was the most important reveal of the show** so far. Jon Arryn's death was the catalyst of the whole bloody thing. If Jon Arryn didn't die, Robert wouldn't come to Winterfell, Ned wouldn't become the Hand, Bran wouldn't fall off the tower, Catelyn wouldn't capture Tyrion, and in the end Ned wouldn't die.

* Well, of course, if Jon Arryn didn't die, he and Stannis would probably have eventually completed their cause against Joffrey's claim to the throne. So even if the Lannisters didn't kill him, they would certainly want him dead, sooner or later. Still, that leaves room for error and chance for Robert to find out the truth, and that wouldn't create as much chaos as Jon's death did.

* Sansa's marriage to Robin as first cousins, however psycho the Lysa and her son are, isn't anything odd. Marrying cousins, even first cousins, is actually practised in some places in our world (India, Pakistan). In Westeros, the cross-country arrangenents between major houses such as Tully-Stark, Tully-Arryn and Lannister-Baratheon (and lately, attempted Lannister-Tyrell) are incredibly unusual. Even Rhaegar's marriage to princess of Dorne Elia Martell was rather an exception amongst all the inter-Targaryan pairings.

* Speaking of unusual arranged marriages, there is a theory that [](#g ""the big houses were already conspiring with Rhaegar to overthrow his father""), but we lack any hard evidence to support this claim other than timing of some arrangements.

###End of a Legend

&gt; *Aren't you... like... afraid of me?* - Karl, a little bit confused  
*Nah, man, you're not even in the books. We'll be fine* - Jojen, fond of his greensight

* So now, without any speculation/spoiler tags, IT WASNT IN THE BOOOOOKSSSSSSS

* But, seriously. This whole part was made up to tie some loose ends and kill some time in Jon's storyline, which as far as ASOS is concerned, is nearing its end. Jon coming back to Castle Black (end of season 3) marks about 2/3 of his chapters in ASOS. So the season 4 part, if it's supposed to not exceed ASOS, needed to be a little bit extended.

* Plot points remain as follows: Bran continues his journey north, Jon is at Castle Black, Mance doesn't know about Watch's true power, Craster's Keep is not relevant anymore and direwolves are free.

* Jojen being all chill about his fate is very very book-canon. His sort of catchphrase is ""This is not the day I die"". Which would be badass if it wasn't for his implied dolorous delivery. He's like that.

* This may be introduced later in the show, but book readers have known this from the second book now: [book difference](#b ""all Stark children are wargs, not just Bran. Bran is merely the only one who realizes what his wolf dreams mean. Arya dreams of Nymeria's attacks and we hear the news of a monster wolf leading a pack. Jon has dreams in which he sees through the eyes of Ghost, but the dreams stop once they are on the opposite sides of the Wall. Robb's last words are ""Grey Wind"" and some people speculate that his agony continued after Roose Bolton stabbed him - in the book, Robb dies before his direwolf does. Robb is not a POV character so we don't see his dreams. Only POV Stark child without wolf dreams is Sansa - well, her direwolf, Lady, is dead"").

With the demise of the character Locke at the hands of a skinchanged Hodor, and as many of the non readers are aware from hearing the comments of book readers this scene does not take place in the novels, the character Locke (or his book counterpart) is not even in the North at this period in time.  So for this installment I wish to cover Locke's book counterpart, Vargo Hoat and his troupe of the Brave Companions, or The Bloody Mummers...

---------------

**Note On Spoiler Scope:** 

Unlike the majority of the other posts in this series, I will not be dealing with back-history or lore in this installment.  Instead this will be a large book vs show difference discussion.  As the characters of Vargo Hoat and the Brave Companions were changed in the show to Locke and the Bolton men for the series, I will talk about what that group was doing in the books and list the major differences.  You'll also notice I labeled this thread as ""AFFC"", that is because the ultimate fate of Vargo Hoat is revealed in the 4th novel, and I wish to discuss it, but rest assured that since this is a character that WILL NOT appear in the show, and will be entirely different from the fate of Locke as we saw on the show that this thread is still entirely safe for those who do not wish to spoil the show for themselves.... 

-----------------------------

**The Brave Companions**

Unlike what we see in the show with Locke and the Bolton Men; Vargo Hoat and the Brave Companions are a small sellsword company from Essos. Despite their small numbers, they are well known for their ruthlessness, and brutality earning them their alternate name and the name the group is most known as: ""The Bloody Mummers"", though you would not want to call them that in their presence as they find it very insulting.  It was this reputation of savagery that caused Lord Tywin Lannister to hire the band and bring them to Westeros to bring strife and terror to the Riverlands.  Despite the small size of the company, they did have their own banners and sigil, that of a black goat.  So who were these Mummers?  

The ranks of The Brave Companions were comprised of savages and criminals of Essos, including a murdering Septon called ""Utt"", a fat Dothraki called Zollo, a disavowed maester named Qyburn, and their leader Vargo Hoat; a brutal man also known as ""The Black Goat"" from Qohor with a strong lisp and a fond habit of torturing his enemies by dismembering body parts.  They were tasked with raiding in the Riverlands when their services were purchased by Tywin Lannister and did so with the best of their abilities.  After Lady Whent fled Harrenhall and Lord Tywin made the castle his temporary seat, the Brave Companions made the large fortress the base of their operations as well.

-----------------------------

**From the Lion to the Wolf**

When Tywin Lannister left Harrenhall to reinforce his troops (an to make allies with the Tyrells), he had left one of his Bannermen, Ser Amory Lorch as castellan with the Brave Companions to help sure up the numbers to hold Harrenhall.  Growing tensions with the Brave Companions and the Lannister men however were not on the best of terms and the two groups quarreled often, ultimately leading to the decision of turning their cloaks and siding with the northmen.  Under the nose of Tywin Lannister and Amory Lorch the Brave Companions ""captured"" and brought several northern prisoners to Harrenhall.  Shortly thereafter Brave Companions added three new members to their ranks, former freed prisoners of a group headed to the Night's Watch to join the order, brought to Harrenhall by Lorch, these people were Rorge, Biter, and Jaqen H'ghar.  It was with their aid, and with the aid of Arya Stark under the alias Weasel, that the Brave Companions freed the northmen and slaughtered the Lannister garrison at Harrenhall, making way for the arrival of Roose Bolton. Jaqen disappeared from their numbers after the overthrow, but Rorge and Biter remained as members of the Mummers.  As part of their slaughter, Amory Lorch is thrown into the Bear Pit at Harrenhall.

During Rooses' occupation of Harrenhall, the Brave Companions returned to their old habits of terrorizing their enemies, only this time for the Northmen, instead of the Lannisters.  It was at this time that the group came upon Ser Jaime Lannister and Brienne of Tarth in the heat of a scuffle.  As it was with Locke's men in the show, it was with the Brave Companions in the books they took both of them as prisoner to transport back to Harrenhall.  And as it was in the show, the following events played out: Jaime saves Brienne from rape from the Brave Companions with the promises of riches from her sapphire laden father, and as in the show with Locke, Vargo Hoat has Jaime's hand removed to send a message to Tywin Lannister. (Though it was the Dothraki Zollo that actually took Jaime's hand).  

The Brave Companions brought Jaime and Brienne back to Harrenhall where they were met and treated with by Roose Bolton.  Unbeknownst to the Brave Companions Roose was in arrangements with Tywin Lannister to turn cloak against Robb Stark and re-join the Kingdom.  The Events at Harrenhall played out in the books as they did in the show, Jaime (with the help of Qyburn) is treated and freed by the Boltons, and Brienne is given to Vargo as compensation for a lack of sapphires promised to him, from which she is rescued by Jaime.  Vargo is left in charge of Harrenhall when Roose Bolton departs for the wedding of Edmure Tully and Roslin Frey, and names himself ""Lord of Harrenhall""

---------------------------

**Roast Goat**

(This is where AFFC spoilers begin, once again only pertaining to Vargo Hoat, so this will be safe for show watchers, the information discussed actually takes place during the events of ASOS, but is learned of in AFFC)

After the events of the Red Wedding the Brave companions found themselves in a precarious situation, they had turned their cloaks on the Lannisters for the Northmen, particularly for Roose Bolton, but Roose Bolton had betrayed his King and sided with the Lannisters.  Their remained presence at Harrenhall was risky.  Jaime Lannister had also informed his father Tywin upon his return to King's Landing that it was indeed Vargo Hoat and the Brave Companions that had cut off his hand. Fearing the wroth of Tywin Lannister, and the fact that they no longer had any northern men to serve The Brave Companions urged Vargo Hoat to leave Harrenhall and flee.  However not wishing to abandon his ""Lordship"" of Harrenhall Vargo refused to leave.  It was then that the Bloody Mummers abandoned Vargo and fled Harrenhall.  

Vargo remained at Harrenhall for a short while longer until Gregor Clegane came to Harrenhall to take and hold the castle in Tywin's name, bringing with him several northern captives.  Gregor easily takes the castle from Vargo and executes the scant few remaining Brave Companions that remained at Harrenhall, however Vargo's fate was slightly different.  Under the command of Tywin Lannister, and in retribution for the maimed hand of Jaime, Vargo Hoat was tortured using his own methods of brutality.  Clegane slowly dismembered him over a sustained period and kept Vargo alive by cleaning and treating the wounds after he did so.  And in a sick twist the dismembered body parts of Hoat were cooked and fed to the Northern prisoners kept at Harrenhall.  The captives had no clue what they were eating, only being told by their gaolers that they were being fed ""Roast Goat"", a mockery of the sigil and banner of Vargo Hoat and his disbanded sellsword company.   This prolonged torture went on for weeks until finally Vargo was outright finished off by the Mountain, thus ending his part in the story.

So that is is, Vargo unlike his show counterpart Locke did not return with Roose to the North, did not travel to the wall, and did not meet his end at the hands of Hodor.  It's an interesting change that could be discussed for weeks (as it has been), but I thought you non-readers would like to know the arc of what happened to Locke's counterpart, The Black Goat of Qohor in the novels, and I hope you have enjoyed doing so..  That is it for this week.  Thanks again for any feedback and until next time, look out for false promises of *thapphireth* from the *Kingthlayer*. (I had to work that in somehow..)

Jon Arryn doesn't die if it's not for them. Which directly impacts just about every major character's storyline, if you think about it:

* Ned doesn't go to King's Landing and die.

* Catelyn and Robb don't fight a war and die.

* Theon doesn't get sent to Pyke, so he doesn't end up in Ramsay's clutches. His sister doesn't leave to try and rescue him. Luwin and Rodrik don't die, Winterfell isn't burned to the ground.

* Sansa doesn't get sent to KL. She doesn't marry Tyrion, she doesn't become a prisoner, she doesn't go to the Eyrie.

* Arya doesn't get sent to KL and get separated. No Arya/Gendry/Hot Pie trio, no Arya/Sandor.

* Bran doesn't get pushed out a window and become crippled, because Robert never comes to Winterfell. With his entire family still in Winterfell safely, there's no way he sneak out beyond the Wall, either.

* Jaime doesn't become a prisoner of war and doesn't lose his hand, which probably also means he doesn't start to become a better person (if you believe he has.) He just continues being the pompous rich knight he always has been.

* **Cersei doesn't kill Robert because Ned isn't there to tell Robert about the bastards.** Joffrey doesn't become King, so he isn't poisoned. Tommen doesn't become king. Because Joffrey doesn't become King and get killed, Tyrion doesn't stand trial for murdering him.

* Tywin/Tyrion don't become Hand -- Jon Arryn still is -- meaning Myrcella doesn't go to Dorne. 

* Sandor never gets fed up with Joffrey and the fire at the Battle of Blackwater (because the latter doesn't happen.) So he probably never says ""Fuck the King"" and runs away; if he does, he does it later under different circumstances -- Robert is certainly more tolerable than Joffrey -- and since he never meets Arya, I'm assuming he'd just end up drinking himself to death somewhere.

* Tyrion is never kidnapped at the Vale so he never meets Bronn. He's never fighting a battle away from King's Landing so he never meets Shae. So I guess they just continue to hang out wherever they were hanging out and sell their respective services.

* Since Robert doesn't die, Renly probably doesn't try to become king. And I guess Brienne just keeps doing various knightly things elsewhere the way Shae and Bronn keep doing their thing locally, never going into Renly's service (as he would have no Rainbow Guard) and certainly never going into Catelyn's service (as she would never meet Catelyn.) Whether Stannis knows about the incest is tricky, but it's irrelevant -- with no Robert, Stannis also never declares himself King because he has no claim. You could argue Renly might make a claim for the throne anyway, but I don't think that he would have while his older brother who gave him more titles than he deserved was still on the throne -- and while there was no wartime dissension coming to exploit.

* No Robert death and no War of the Five Kings probably means no marriage or alliance between Joffrey and the Tyrells, which means Margaery would still be in the Reach and Oberyn would still be in Dorne.

Daenerys and Jon Snow's respective crews are the ones who don't seem directly impacted, which makes sense because they're so isolated. But even then, Barristan would never have ended up in Essos, so if he turns out to be important in Dany's arc, then that changes. And if there's no War of the Five Kings being fought, then it's possible that the people of Westeros could have spared more legitimate soldiers. Too soon to tell what that means when we don't know how the Night's Watch ultimately fares against Mance's army or the White Walkers.

Butterfly effect x 1000. *Every fucking thing* that is going on right now is going on because Littlefinger and Lysa killed Jon Arryn. Every major character's arc, other than maybe the folks on Essos and the folks who are far North, can be traced back to that death.

But to Littlefinger, nothing that I just typed matters. The only thing that matters to him is this one:

* After the Battle of Blackwater, Littlefinger was given Harrenhal. After the Red Wedding, he was given the Riverlands. If he marries Lysa, then he becomes Lord of the Vale.

As Varys told Olenna: ""Littlefinger was born with no lands, no wealth, and no armies. He's acquired the first two. How long before he has the army?""

He did warn you not to trust him.",80,182,False,self,,,,,

She feels as though if she can't rule slaver's bay, how can she rule an entire kingdom. I have read the books and until I started rethinking her words after last night's episode, this all made sense. However, now, I have a major issue with her logic:

The basic premise is SB is smaller and less sophisticated than Westeros, so if you can't rule the former, there is no way you could rule the latter. But I think the problem is that SB and Westeros is basically an apples to oranges comparison. 

Think about the problems arising with Dany's ""rule"" over SB. It all revolves around one major issue: slavery. Slavery is outlawed in Westeros, so the only problems she'd run into with that if/when she sails west would be random outlaws like her bff Ser Jorah. Granted, there are other problems in Westeros that obviously present challenges to a king or queen, or even a lord, but I would argue that there is not one single, all-encompassing issue like there is in SB. Dany has basically brought down their entire economy, their entire way of life, because of her liberation mission. Correct me if I'm wrong, but [ADWD](#b ""didn't we here from some slaves who said they had *better* lives as slaves than as freed men?""). Obviously this doesn't make slavery ok, and what Dany is doing is definitely a just thing (even though I have a feeling this has more to do with her feeling like a slave all her life and projecting this onto freeing slaves than actually wanting to free slaves), but if it weren't for slavery, I feel as though Dany would have very little issue ruling SB successfully. 

Westeros would present challenges of its own, and probably more of them. It could be more bureaucratic and tedious. But I don't believe Westeros has one presiding issue that Dany would oppose and find as much difficulty as she is finding now in Slaver's Bay. I think ruling Westeros would actually be easier for her.

Back a long time ago someone (I don't remember who exactly. Tyrion to Bronn maybe?) was talking about the Iron Bank of Braavos and said that they always get their money, and if they don't, they'll start funding the enemies of those who are in their debt.

In last night's episode (4.05) Tywin openly states how they are in a massive debt to the IBoB and Casterly Rock isn't producing gold and so on.

Now looking back to 4.03, Davos is having trouble finding an army for Stannis, and suggests they pay for sellswords although Stannis doesn't like the idea and even says they have no money for it. The Dragonstone chapter for that episode ends with Davos writing a letter to the IBoB. It is assumed that he is looking for a loan so that they can pay for soldiers to once again try to take the crown from the Lannisters at King's Landing.

Now, I haven't read to this point in the books, so this is all just speculation for me, but if I had to put this all together, I'd say that the Iron Bank will start funding Stannis since the Lannisters owe them so much and currently have no way to pay them.",5,6,False,self,,,,,

Karl is obviously the ""no honor, anythign goes in a fight"" guy.  He places no value on honor whatsoever and sees it as a weakness.

This is apparently vindicated by him ""winning"" against Jon by spitting in his face to distract him momentarily.  HOWEVER, right after that Karl loses.  Why did he lose?

BECAUSE HE HAS NO HONOR.  The girl hates and fears him, and sees in Jon some good. It was Jon's honor that saved him there, and Karl's lack of it that doomed him.  

Honor can be a weakness, yes (looking at you Ned), but it can also be a powerful ally.  It makes people WANT to serve you, to fight with you, to die for you.  People do fight and risk their lives for money, yes, but far more do so for what they BELIEVE in.

[Warning: Major spoilers for the rest of the season ahead]

There are several reasons why the last chapter/epilogue of ASOS are perfect. First off, there are a few things we don't know before this scene: Who killed Jon Arryn? Why is Littlefinger so obsessed with Catelyn? What exactly happened between Littlefinger and the Tully girls?

When Littlefinger enters the throne room to find Lysa hanging Sansa out of the Moon Door, he tries to calm her down. She reveals that she poisoned her husband because he asked her to, giving some insight into what Petyr has been doing and what kind of man he is. 

She then accuses him of not loving her, but loving Catelyn instead. We find out that she and Littlefinger slept together after Catelyn rejected him. The assumption we make is that he thought he'd slept with Catelyn, and has lived his life in vain pursuit of a woman he thought had some kind of feeling for him. In his anger, he tells her he's loved only one woman all this time, ""Only Cat"", and pushes her out of the Moon Door.

In the very next chapter, we find out that Catelyn is ""alive"", though no longer the woman Petyr loved. In fact, he's partly responsible for her death and subsequent transformation into this hideous, vengeful creature.

It's a beautiful, perfect ending to the most exciting book in the series and I'm a little annoyed that the producers chose to reveal half of that information the moment we got to the Eyrie, rather than saving for when it would be most impactful. It reveals so much about Littlefinger and why he does what he does. I like to think that he challenged Brandon Stark for Catelyn because he saw himself as Catelyn's knight in shining armor, saving her from marrying a cruel man she didn't love.

What could they have done with that extra time?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/24svka/s4e5_were_not_crazy_the_episode_was_short_by_a/,Death_Star_,1399319800,"Many redditors felt like the episode was quite short in length.  It turns out, the senses were right, and viewers were able to detect that the episode actually was short by a few minutes.

Last night,  my HBO GO episode was 54 minutes long for me, or about **4 minutes shorter than usual**.  The episode itself was likely closer to 50 minutes in footage, with the 90 second intro, 1 minute credits, and another minute-plus for the advertisement.

**For a jam-packed season, I thought this was a strange choice.**  They could have easily fit another 4-minute scene in this episode, or trimmed around some scenes to create room for a 5-minute scene.  Here are some things they could have done with the 4-6 minutes:

* The ""Davos writes to the Iron Bank"" follow-up
* The wildlings.  What are they up to?  Are they getting close?
* A Tyrion scene, since he's on trial soon
* More Oberyn, and not just fluff, but some more meat to the Elia/revenge story to build up
* Anything with Stannis.  He's going to be a page in HBO's history book pretty soon.  (EDIT: as in, if they don't show *anything* with Stannis, his story is just going to fade away due to lack of momentum)
* Ramsay and Reek.  Or, Yara?
* Grey worm and Missandei

I think what happened was that they shot this episode, but edited tons of footage OUT of the final cut, presumably because the footage would have disrupted the flow of the episode.  But I'm also guessing that the footage they cut out was not only unimportant, but it didn't feature any of the story arcs from above, since a 5-6 minute scene could have easily been shot and edited and included in this episode.

**What do you think D&amp;D could have done with the extra 4-plus minutes?**

**TL;DR -- The episode was short 4 minutes, and they could have easily fit another scene.  This is a season where every minute counts, since there are so many story lines.... so not using the 4-5 minutes seems like a wasted opportunity.**

Not only will it not let us forget that the Iron Throne is indebted to the Iron Bank, but that Syrio Forel was not only Braavosi, but ""The First Sword of Braavos"".

We never really got an explanation of what that means, but it sure sounds impressive, doesn't it?  I always wondered what Syrio was doing in King's Landing before that, ah, unfortunate turns of events.  This episode makes me wonder if he was hanging around precisely *because* of the crown's debt to the Iron Bank -- which we have only learned about after the fact.

I realize we probably heard so much about Syrio solely as background for Arya, why she was doing what she was doing with Needle (which we haven't really seen her do since Season 1, and haven't seen the sword itself since Season 2), and to have The Hound chide her enough to try to impulsively cross him off her list right there and then.

But I'm wondering with all the other Braavosi content this episode if it's not being brought up for some other reason: either that we'll hear from a new First Sword of Braavos very soon (in conjunction with all this talk of the Iron Bank), or more about Syrio specifically and questions about his fate in King's Landing.

I think what intrigued me the most was what Clegane had to say about Syrio.  Yeah, he was mocking Arya, but he brought up a lot of good points which had the opposite effect (at least with me) of what he intended.  It's not something I've thought about for a while, but [Syrio theory](#g ""there's a theory I remember reading about how Syrio not only survived the attack by the Kingsguard, but he is actually a Faceless Man who escaped King's Landing by taking the identity of a criminal in the Black Cells, namely Jaqen Hagar"").  It's the kind of thing you think about to tie together things that don't need to be tied together to still make sense, but has certain attractive features: [Syrio theory continued](#g ""Jaqen running into Arya is a (perhaps) chance meeting, but still serendipitous one; it explains a) why a Faceless Man from Braavos was in Westeros, b) how he ended up captured, and b) in the Black Cells in the first place; and of course the idea that Syrio ultimately survived, he just wasn't who we thought he was.  Perhaps there was a real Syrio who was the First Sword of Braavos once upon a time, but a Faceless Man took his place upon the trip to King's Landing to do whatever it was he was in King's Landing to do.  I doubt it was to train a little girl in the ways of Water Dancing, but through both Syrio and Jaqen he saw great potential in Arya"").",5,0,False,self,,,,,

I am really bad at recognizing faces (even in real life - ugh!) and the all-dark and twilighty scenery doesn't exactly help, either. So I am very confused about who's who. Preferably without any spoilers from the books (that's why I didn't just google it).

So currently (S04E05), there are:

* John Snow and a group around him, they are north of the wall (why?!) and loyal to the night's watch
* Brandon, Hodor, Jojen and his sister  searching a three-eyed raven. Did Brandon's wolf die when they were captured? [S04E05](#s ""Or why didn't they take him with them last episode?"")
* A band of night's watch deserters, who [S04e05](#s ""were killed by Jon Snow and his men. Was that, why John travelled north of the wall? Or just a random encounter?"")
* Who is the guy, that [S04E05](#s ""tried to capture Brandon"") and what was his intention?
* Mance Raider (sp?) and his army moving south
* Some heavily scarred wildlings who act even wilder. Are they a separate group? Or a subgroup of Mance's army?
* White Walkers including Darth-Walker moving south
* A heavily under-manned castle black - commanded by whom? And why?
* I think, there is also a group of wildlings who already crossed the wall. They're loyal to Mance Raider (or is he even part of this group?). I thought John Snow and his fellows headed out hunting them - but now they appear at Craster's keep?!)
* Do we know what happened to Ygritte?
* Which important characters or groups did I miss?

I love the show as much as the next guy, but every time a scene at or near the wall comes up, I end up frustrated because I tend to not grasp what's happening :-(. Any addition, correction and clarification is greatly appreciated!

He confidently gives a speech about what would happen if Winterfell didn't serve him. He then displays the two corpses to the people but is visibly shocked when he turns around and sees them. Why?
I get that he's kind of disgusted with himself, after all, he has done a lot of things wrong and clearly regrets his actions later on. But I was always a little confused by this scene, as awesome as it is.

If it were in fact Bran and Rickon I would not question this scene. They were like his own little brothers and seeing them there would faze Theon a lot, besides his egoistical plans at this point. But he knows who they are and that he chose to kill and burn them to make a point. When he presents them to Winterfell, he's confident about what he's doing and knows perfectly well that there are two crispy kids behind him. But when he turns around to look at them, it seems as if he didn't expect to see them there. He looks startled, his smile suddenly disappears and he looks to the ground, visibly upset. When I saw this scene for the first time, I thought I've completely missed something important because I was so surprised by his reaction.

Was it a sudden change of heart? Has he not seen the corpses before and was surprised by the actual brutality that he has done to them? Did he regret killing these two boys at this point? Why not before? I guess this is the turning point for Theon and his faith in his own actions, but can you explain to me what exactly goes on in Theon's head at the moment he sees the corpses?

Also I havent read the books so I dont have a clue if this is possible, time scale wise because they dont seem to mention it much in the show, so feel free shoot the theory down and tell me that wouldnt be possible.

[Up to season One](#g ""But what is John snow is actually not Ned starks bastard but is in fact King Robs which he had with Lyanna Stark. After Lyanna dies, Ned claims that the child is his to protect Robs honour or whatever cos that wouldnt look to good would it now. This would sort of make John the rightful king excluding the fact that he is still a bastard and Daenerys is the rightful queen. But for this theory to work someone would have to be first, know the truth and secondly be alive. The only person that might fit that criteria is his uncle Benjen, the ranger who is still missing. And also Hodor.""

[Up to season One](#g ""Which brings me to how it might all end. Game of thrones is based on the time of the war in the roses which ended shortly after Henry Tudor (VII) promises to marry Elizabeth of York which would join the 2 houses together and stop the fighting. So John Baratheon might think hed make a good king or he needs the support for the wall or whatever and ends up marring Daenerys to unite the two houses, which is also joining the stalks together as well. Also in the war of the roses Elizabeth has a stronger claim than Henry just like Daenerys would have a stronger claim than John. So now they can go to kings landing and kill all the Lannisters apart from Tyroin, who sails off into the sunset with all the other characters that we would all like to think are going to make it that far.""

I know this theory is very farfetched, mainly because this ending would be way too happy but Id love to hear your opinion on it and also if youd be happy with this ending.

That and he doesn't seem so pleased with the Howling wedding (I wonder if he used some Maester's potion to perform so well as to make Lysa howl like a wolf from the North).   

Also Lysa will block him from Sansa - like an NHL goalie with rabies.   So I've got to believe Baelish is going to take care of her in some discreet way.

I am also seeing Varys differently now that the source of the Arryn poisoning was revealed.   I can't believe Varys didn't know that Lysa and Baelish were involved - Petyr is clever, but Varys is the Spider.   So why has Varys never let on to anyone else about it?",3,2,False,self,,,,,

Locke seemed like a charismatic individual who's talents of tracking and deceit were wasted on the Bolton family, and Karl, well, I always thought of him as that steward that finally manned up and did something badass, then let it get to his head. But upon learning that he had always been a bit of a badass at fleas bottom (gin alley you focking cunt), he still seems cool. I just wanted to know what you think of them, who is more badass, who you would rather have finger your anus, etc etc.


Personally I loved seeing Locke and Karl get some action with weapons, you can always infer a characters personality by their fighting style. Locke's was resourceful to an extent and showed how he had no trouble finding weak points, and Karl's was as showy and at the same time focused as you'd expect from a focking legend like him. I felt bad for Rast though. That's a shitty way to die. ",4,1,False,self,,,,,

1. She passes the torch on taking care of Tommen to Margaery.
2. She asks Oberyn to make sure her daughter gets the boat she's had made for her.
3. When her father asks when she'll marry Loras, the way she says a fortnight after Tommen's wedding seemed to me like she was just giving him any acceptable timeframe knowing that it didn't really matter (because she'll be dead?). 

Everything I'm reading online seems to equate Cersei's action with her finally putting her family first and being ""nice,"" but I see it as her just giving up now that her son is dead. She did almost kill herself during the Battle of Blackwater, so it wouldn't be completely out of character for her. Would love to hear your thoughts!

So (even though it differed from the books) a number of both book and show fans were up in arms about how the shows portrayal of Jaime raping Cersei destroyed perceptions of Jaime 's redemptive character storyline as they now can't root for him as a hero. 

(personally, he pushed a kid out a window for catching him fucking his sister, so you now) 

Talking about Bran, this is where I think there should be more discussion (within the show watching environment) about the ethics of when Bran wargs into Hodor. In particular, this latest episode resulted in Bran using Hodor to kill Locke. After Bran un-warged, Hodor was clearly left upset by the realization of what happened. 

For me, Bran's use of Hodor is incredibly close to Jaime's rape of Cersei for the following reasons. 

1. We have two characters with am existing close relationship which involves trust (making violations of such trust particularly heinous) 

2. The act involved violation of the weaker person's bodily integrity (Cersei physically, Hodor mentally). 

3. The act was for the violator's control -  Jaime put of frustration with Cersei's distance and wanting to force intimacy, Bran, unable to physically fight back against Locke, forces himself into Hodor to use his body as he wanted. 

Now, this is not necessarily something new in the book discussion world, but I'm still surprised there hasn't been the same reaction. Clearly, there are entrenched existing social factors that make rape a particular issue (ie subordination of women, gratuitous violence against Wyman in our world). And clearly, this issue isn't going to come up in the same way, as in our world, people don't warg into others' minds. But that's kind of the point. This is a fantasy world, so ethical issues should get us up in arms, even if it's tempting to only focus on horrible things we relate to in our universe, rather than the Westeros universe. 

So, at the end of the day, what I'm trying to say is, I think Bran is a brain-rapist and I don't like him. ",20,10,False,self,,,,,

Here are my thoughts so far....

Baelish grew up in Riverrun so knew Cat and Lysa from childhood, he had no title no real lands and no prospects, assuming he was always an intelligent and ambitious person that means that he would only ever achieve lands and titles through marriage, he must hoped that he would be able to marry Cat, or failing that Lysa and join House Tully and through them achieve power and influence of his own. However he must have realised that Hoster Tully wouldn't have married his daughters off to a nobody when they could be wed to leading members of the Great Houses, the engagement of Lysa and Cat happened roughly the same time so he now saw his two best chances of marrying above his station slipping away. I guess that he weighed the odds and figured that challenging one of the prospective husbands to a duel was a gamble worth taking, in this respect he may have seen Brandon Stark as the weaker of the two men as Jon Aryn was older and already had a fearsome reputation. After losing the duel he then saw both the Tully slip out of his reach forever.

Very shortly after this, about a year or so, Brandon is killed by the mad king, before his wedding to Cat. He then attempts to contact her, asking to marry her. So his game plan here is still to attempt to marry into money. She refuses and marries Ned.

After Jon Aryn, Ned Stark and Robert Baratheon overthrow the Targaryens, Jon becomes hand of the king and moves to king's landing, with Lysa. At some point Lord Baelish arrives in King's Landing too, and manages to amass a fortune and become Lord Treasurer. This brings him within close proximity to Jon Aryn, and no doubt Lysa. My theory is that from this point on his goal becomes making himself Lord of the Vale, he befriends Lysa and gradually starts to seduce her. She has a series of miscarriages and I think Baelish might be responsible for that too, his goal is for Jon to die of old age without an heir and he will marry Lysa and assume control of the Vale. However, things go wrong, firstly Jon has a male child who lives, Robyn. Secondly, Jon finds out about the Lannister incest scandal, a secret that little finger no doubt already knows. He has to act fast, before Jon can go to King Robert. 

SO, Baelish persuades Lysa to kill Jon, she is fully under his power by now. The Lannisters attempt to make Jamie the new hand but Robert decides to travel North, so Baelish see's his opportunity. He can start a war between Lannisters and Starks, exact revenge on Cat and House Stark for his earlier humiliation. And end up as de-facto ruler of the Vale, the only kingdom which remained Neutral during the civil war. As a bonus he also gets to control Sansa, not only a reminder of his former relationship with Cat but also the only (as far as he knows) surviving Stark and possibly the key to ruling the North aswell.

I would say that the story should follow that of the books with a touch of show material as well. An example of a boss fight would be last episode's (S4E5) final fight between Jon and Karl. When Karl killed that Knight's Watch soldier and pulled out his daggers I got the feeling that shit was going to go down.  It would also be cool if the perspective would shift like it would in the show between Jon and Bran and have two fights going on at the same time, where Jon is fighting Karl and Bran is warging into Hodor. All that scene needed was a Mortal Combat narrator that said : ""FIGHT""

* Is there a national army controlled by kings landing or is it completely drawn together from the different kingdoms?
* Is there any form of representation for the kingdoms at the capital, do they have any influence in the capital?
* Does the capital even make decisions that affect the other kingdoms if so what?
* Is there a federal judicial system?

I've seen some other posts around the 'net arguing that he's a faceless man, possibly even Jaqen. I know the argument's been made for and against before, but the little spar between Arya and the Hound in this week's episode got me thinking about it again, and I realized a little detail that I haven't seen mentioned before.  
Syrio in the books is described to be very different in appearance than his portrayal in the show (slight and bald). Initially, I thought, ""Hey, that's no big. It's a minor detail and they change stuff like that all the time."" This is true, but then I realized that in the books, we actually get a little glimpse of some of the shifty activities Jaqen gets into as a faceless man, notably taking the form of the Alchemist to get into the Citadel. Arya sees him change his face into that of the Alchemist before we're introduced to that character as the Alchemist, and he's described as having thick black curly hair and a slight scar on his right cheek.  
Possibly reading into this too much, but that seems to be a fitting description of HBO's Syrio. He doesn't have a ""hooked nose,"" but upon further inspection, there does appear to be a slight scar, but on his left cheek.  
http://imageshack.us/m/5/1305/vlcsnap2011052423h15m11.png  
Not saying anything's set in stone, and the show is clearly diverging from the books more and more, but I thought this was an interesting detail that hasn't been brought up (as far as I could see), and I think it gives some weight to the Syrio-as-Jaqen\Alchemist theory.

**Me &amp; A Song of Ice and Fire**

For four years, my little brother was bugging me: ""You must read A Song of Ice and Fire, you will love it, I promise!"" 

I was like: Yeah, sure.... 

I like fantasy-novels, mind you, but I didnt want to read a series which still has no end. I hate waiting. I hated it with the Darkover series, I hated it with Harry Potter. (btw -  I would have never read HP, if not for my little brother who always told me: You will like it! whereas I was like: I will not read it, I loved reading before it was cool, pah. Little brother is always right about me and books, it seems.)

I mean, GRRM takes much longer with writing than JKR or MZB (or DJR) - as you all know. And hey, what if GRRM  wont finish the series?! So - no. I was determined: I will not read this yet. A year ago, my co-worker started bugging me: Watch the TV Show, you will love it *sigh*

Long story short: 6 Weeks ago I broke down and started reading. In english, although my english sucks (reading works passably, writing is something quite different, as you probably just noticed).  First pages: *Yeah, ok like this ok like that* ... and then I was totally hooked after a few pages. 

After a few tries to look up some facts online (Spoilers everywhere!), I avoided everything about GOT / ASOIAF online like the plague - except here! Thank you SO MUCH for this subreddit &amp; the spoiler policy! Literally the only place in WWW I could read :D



On sunday I finished ADWD. ;(
On Monday I finished all excerpts of TWOW (&amp; watched latest episode of the show). 

And now my wait begins and I hate it already. But hey, Im VERY thankful that I dont start waiting 1996! 

So after finishing all books I will now read all the spoiler threads and all theories and speculation and Wikis... and audiobook sounds like a good idea  

Befor this, here 
**my humble opinions &amp; thoughts** 
for all who are interested (or not). I love reading such things from others, so, here you go.

**The most (most! MOST! MOST!!!!!) important thing: The Hound** 

...is not dead. He is the gravedigger on the Quiet Isle. Totally obvious from the very first moment, when the gravedigger appears. Pah. Dont know why - but I know. 

I have already read that this is not just my guess. Thank Old Gods and the New, because Sandor Clegan is my favorite character. Trues to be told, I'm totally in love with book-Hound since page 96. 


In ASOS I was like: Sure Arya left him to die - nice try GRRM!

In AFFC I was sure that he will appear at any moment. I waited. Full of expectation. The whole f*** time. 

A Brienne chapter in AFFC 
&gt; ...when she heard the sound of another horse, coming closer.

Me: *It's the Hound! Let it be the Hound!*
&gt; ...The rider was a small man 

*Damn!!* 

Then I assured myself: *OK, he is not going to appear in AFFC but in ADWD we will meet again.* Was clinging to this hope until the epiloge of AFFC *Well,* you all know that my hope was shattered in the end. But in TWOW there will be the Hound again! It is known! 

*erm*, what I wanted to say he is not dead. Dont you dare to say anything else, I want to believe. GRRM will deliver! 



**Targaryens everywhere**

After Young-Griff, I think:  everybody is a Tageryan. 

Hm, Daario and his mysterious identity Targaryen, for sure!  

Coldhand? Targaryen, certainly.

Jon Snows mother? Targaryen. Wait, no doesn't make sense. Ah, Jon Snows mother - Lyanna, Father: Rhaegar. Was so fucking proud of me for this theory &amp; after I wrote it to my co-worker, googled it and it was like: Oh yeah, the whole internet thinks this since ages ohhh-keeee.




**Little-Evil-Finger**

Since the end of ASOS Im convinced: All the evil in Westeros (at least) comes from Littlefinger! 

Someone is murdered? Littlefinger is either behind this or knows who did it (and why!). 

Red Wedding? Littlefingers idea! 

The Long Night is coming? Not without Littlefingers!

He's got a little finger in every pie! (so sorry for the bad pun, couldnt help me). 

Not quite sure, but he also could be a Targaryen...

Littlefinger was such an intriguing, slippery, devious character from the first moment for me and all deeper insights into its intrigues was like: *""Wait what?! I knew this little guy is evil, but this, wow!""*.  His interactions with Sansa in AFFC are so creepy oO And all of sudden all this mentions about the lord's right to the first night  and Sansas impending marriage with Harry the Heir oh I feel so bad for her right now. 

Petyr Baelish - such an exciting character in the books :D




**GRRM keeps surprising me**

When Jon was stabbed,  I wrote immediately to my Co-Worker: ""He is not dead! POV characters never died in their POV chapters!"". Same when Quentyn was burning.  I felt very clever! I have seen through you, GRRM, haha. *Yeah.* A few pages after, I wrote her again - ""GRRM, you unpredictable wretch! (Though, strictly speaking, Quentyn didnt died in his POV chapters...)

And to Jon knows nothing Snow - at the point when Jon Snow stopped taking Ghost everywhere with him, I knew: oh, bad omen. Yepp. You didnt see this coming, Jon Snow?! You really know nothing. (But I don't think Jon Snow is dead.)




**Franken-Gregor-stein?**

Strong Robert nearly 8 feets tall - clear thing, Gregor half-living-or-dead-or-what-ever-Qyburn-did-to-him Clegane. Please who else is so fucking tall? Wait HODOR?? :D



**TL;DR: For years I refused to read ASOIAF. Started reading 6 weeks ago, fell in love immediately. Now Im completely desperate about waiting for TWOW since 48 hours &amp; start rambling about my thoughts about everything and nothing in this subreddit, because *erm* just because.**

When Lysa starts pressuring Sansa about her relationship with LF, Sansa initially tries to use logic to dissuade Lysa from her paranoid belief. However, that clearly doesn't work and Lysa continues pressuring Sansa. Then, Sansa changes tactics, and starts assuring Lysa through tears that Petyr always calls her stupid and that she never learns etc. And only then, Lysa seems to calm down.

Now, at first glance, Sansa's words seem like a panic reaction. But really, she chooses to say the exact thing, maybe the only thing that can convince Lysa to stop tormenting her. And if you think about it, Petyr has never really called Sansa ""a stupid girl"".

long time lurker, first time poster. I really hope I did the spoiler tag for the title right. It`s a bit confusing and english isn`t my first language, so pardon me if I made any mistakes.
Anyways, I have not read the books so far and there is one thing I was wondering about the Red Wedding. When Ned Srark was killed in the first season, his remains (or at least his head?), were sent back to Winterfell with a little help of Littlefinger if I recall correctly, for Cat to bury him properly. 
Now I know that Robb, Cat, Talisa and countless others were slaughtered at the infamous wedding. And Robb`s body was mutilated, with all that dire wolf head dress up-doll. Uugh. But were their bodies ever sent back to Winterfell afterwards, so they could get at least a proper burial? What happened to Robbs head and the bodies of Cat and Talisa?
As I`ve said, I only watch the tv show and it`s kinda hard to get that specific info without going in to spoiler terrain too deep. So, to the book readers; is this ever adressed in the books? I`d just hope for a little bit dignity in the end for the Starks.
Good, those images still linger in my head. :/",25,33,False,self,,,,,

Maybe it's just me and I'm imagining things, but these are the issues I have this season.


- Quick cuts, close ups and shaky cam

Just rewatch the fight at Crasters or when Daario takes down the rider outside Meereen. Instead of suspenseful, intense wide shots we get a sort of Jason Bourne style quick cut action scene where it's really had to focus on what is actually happening.


- Everything is too ""clean""

The clothing has gotten out of hand. Everyone's clothes seem absolutely perfect and brand new. The environments are absolutely spotless now. No dirt or mess anywhere. Even Meereen which is suppose to be a hot, smelly, dirty city full of slaves doesn't feel right. The characters themselves are missing that medieval / dirty feel. They all look like they just had showers. I swear this wasn't the case in previous seasons. 


Go back and watch earlier seasons in Kings Landing. People are dirty, their hair is normal. Their clothes look worn. The Throne room looks used.




It could just be a case of the budget for the show going up. So there's more time and resources to ""perfect"" things. But I think it's gone too far. Sometimes when things are created on a tighter budget or rushed through there is more authenticity and realism inherently present.

-its known that the two loved each other before she died
-Robert has like 1000's of bastard children
-Ned would never let his nephew become orphaned like the rest of Roberts bastards 
-Ned seems like WAYY too good of a guy to ever cheat on his wife
-This gives Jon Snow a claim to the throne, which i think a lot of people would love 

The only evidence that i can see that really discredits this theory would be that even Catlyn thinks Jon is Neds bastard son, so if he didn't cheat why would he tell his wife that he did? Maybe he swore an oath to the king that he would never reveal this information but who knows. Cant wait till they (if ever) tell the viewers explicitly who his blood parents are.

So I had a question for book readers. I'm currently finishing up book one, but I'm not worried about book spoilers. I have plenty of friends that have read the books, and they've already ruined plenty of big moments for me (Red Wedding, Oberyn vs The Mountain, Tywin's fate, Jon Snow at the end of ADWD, etc). It's unfortunate, but the way I see it, I'll be caught up in time for TWOW, and I'll read two books spoiler free. 

Anyway, since Littlefinger seems to be the mastermind behind the major events of the books and he kinda seems to always know what's going to happen next, what were his feelings on The Red Wedding and Cat's death? I know he's always going to be madly in love with her, so did he hesitate when he heard about Tywin's/Roose's/Frey's plan for her?  Did he even know it would happen? Did he want it to happen? Does he regret it? Some help would be much appreciated! Littlefinger is really turning into an interesting character!",0,1,False,default,,,,,

First, I want to let you guys know that I haven't read the books and I am strictly a show watcher. I've been a huge fan of this show and was literally obsessed with it for the past couple years. However, I no longer find it as enjoyable.

The reason is because Joffrey was my favorite character. Seriously. To me, he was a scene stealer. Best analogy I could think of is that Joffrey is to the Game of Thrones as Eric Cartman is to South Park. Yes, he was a hateful character but he was central to the many conflicts and plots in the storyline. He kept everyone on edge with his cruelty and unpredictability. I actually found much humor in his character and personality.

You can argue that he was just another pawn in the game, but he did a lot of significant things on his own volition, such as killing Ned Stark, and sending out an assassin to kill Bran. Not only that, I think one of the most entertaining scenes in the show was when Joffrey checked his grandfather Tywin. Let's also not forget his ongoing feud with his uncle Tyrion, which also produced enjoyable scenes.

Everytime a new episode came out, I couldn't wait for the Joffrey scenes. I would think, ""Man what is this prick going to do next? Can't wait to see it!"" But now, that excitement in me is gone. It's as if there is a hole in my soul now. The same feeling when your girlfriend dumps you and you try to readjust back to the single life but you know it just won't be the same.

RIP Joffrey. I miss you, you little cunt.",11,0,False,default,,,,,

If Littlefinger has truly had a hand in everything going on in Westeros since the show began, as was seemingly revealed in S4E5, do you think he's in bed with the White Walkers at all?

This could explain why they're mobilising up north but not really going anywhere... possibly waiting for a signal at the start of Baelish's power grab in order for them to strike and cause disarray in the North? It ties up a few loose ends and is also a very convenient explanation for all the time he's been missing since leaving King's Landing. It also gives a motive to the WWs.

This may also explain his need to control Sansa, the last remaining Stark - he could grant the Winterfell/the land of the Starks to the White Walkers as thanks for their help if he succeeds in his plot.

I will be watching for character developments that mirror the young lives of those characters.  Already there are some similarities, although they may be pure coincidence:

* He comes from a cadet branch of a less important house.  He is *just* highborn.  Barristan and Duncan are similar in this regard.

* He defeated a Kingsguard.  Other great knights upset tournaments or displayed unusual competence in battle at a young age.

* He takes his oaths seriously, remaining loyal in the face of changing allegiances.  Karl, for example, was a skilled skirmisher but could never become a true legend... despite his insistence.

I predict that Pod's story arc will see him play important roles in the advancement of other peoples' plots.  He will never  devise his own intrigues.  I think he will get little credit until late in the series when he will be appointed to the most important kingsguard in the realm, where ever that may be.  Foreshadowing for his life, I believe, are Bran's dreams and ambitions from before he was crippled.

It loans a fuckton of money to Westerosi lords and the King, it always gets its money back, and if you don't pay it they'll finance your enemies. Seems pretty simple. I'll assume that the Iron Bank knows *something* about Westerosi politics and can assume that money loaned to Lannisters is virtually money loaned to the Crown. One of the principles of governance is that a king's debts don't die with the king. They pass on to the next king. Tywin knows this first-hand, as he was forced to bring the Lannister house up out of debt and ruin when he inherited the shit situation at Casterly Rock.

In the most recent episode, Tywin commented on how costly war has become for them. This leads me to believe that the best chance anyone has of repaying debts to the Iron Bank would be in peacetime. If all domains bent the knee, the king can tax his way out of debt. So if the most conducive method of repaying the loans to the Iron Bank is peace, why would they fund Stannis? Wars are costly and would only reduce the total economic value of Westeros as both material and personnel assets are lost. Plus, would Stannis just inherit the debt of the King if he wins, making it even more difficult for anyone to pay back the Iron Bank? If he doesn't inherit the debt of the Crown, then the Iron Bank would simply have to absorb that debt. Wouldn't the Iron Bank be better off simply threatening to fund Stannis to get the Lannisters in austerity mode, as *actually* funding Stannis would only cost the Iron Bank more?

Just a thought. Is the greed of the Iron Bank going to blind it to good monetary policy?",10,17,False,self,,,,,

It didn't come across to that way at all, here is why:

Margaery Tyrell is Loras Tyrell's sister. Margery is wanting to marry Tommen Lannister. Tommen Lannister is Cersei Lannister's son. So that would make Cersei Margery's mother. Then Cersei is marrying Loras, which would also make Cersei Margaery's sister-in-law. So Cersei would be both Margaery's sister and mother through both the marriages. That is why she made that comment.

She even made mention of the multiple weddings in the future before she made that comment.

Now everyone loves Daario, even if he is nothing like the books and had a recast.
But everyone seems to hate Ramsay's love for pain and Karl's dickish behaviour. I'll admit Ramsay is a sadistic bastard and Karl is like a poor Joffrey, but I still love both of them.
Mainly because  they deliver a bunch of great lines and their actors are amazing.
But Ramsay doesn't seem that bad to me because his torture of Theon isn't wrong to me. Theon killed Ser Rodrick, took Winterfell, betrayed Robb and thinks it was all justified. Therefore, I want to see him suffer and be tortured for the end of his days because he's in essence a bad person.

Karl I also love because he took a stand against Craster, which would have been a massive gain to the watch had they not started attacking each other. He clearly isn't afraid of anyone as he, like Bronn, could probably kill most of the knights in the seven kingdoms, even though he's a lowly sellsword. The only reason why Jon could kill him was because he was stabbed in the back by one of Craster's wives.

I dunno why but Ramsay and Karl are great characters and the acting is outstanding. But is it bad that I like them? (everyone else seems to hate them)

Also, who are your favourite characters and why?

How did Aegon train his dragons? I haven't read the books, but I've seen the History &amp; Lore series and basically though Aegon landed on King's Landing with severely less men than any self-respecting army, through his dragons he managed to subdue all 7 Kingdoms(expect for Dorne hehe). 

Now you can assume that during this grinding campaign, he ought to have had great if not absolute control over his dragons...they had to stay with him at all times, not like with Danny that they like cats they can leave for a couple of days and then come back like nothing happened, because you know we haven't seen them(okay okay I know CGI is expensive, but I assume even in the books...the dragons do no play a significant role in the taking of Yunkai or Mereen?). Also, they are starting to turn on her...Drogon biting back at Khaleesi on S04 E01.

Sister Cersei - oh, Jaime has come

Then he pushes Bran, and that is dumb

Foul play, no way

Then King Robert tries to fight a boar

But he loses, and that starts a war

Bran flew, 'cause you


They're Hodoring

Three-eyed crow in flight

As Summer he will bite

The walkers are all white


Bran, you know Hodor is walking fast

Going north you find the wall at last

Robb slay by Frey

Sister Cersei - Joffrey's much too mean

You don't care because you're still the queen

You preen, obscene, yeah


Hodoring

Bran's on your back upright

Jojen's got the greensight

And Hodor is your might

Hodoring

Three-eyed crow in flight

As Summer he will bite

The walkers are all white


Sister Cersei - now Joffrey is dead

That drives Margaery to Tommen's bed

Kismet, you bet


But they're Hodoring

Yeah, Hodoring!",2,5,False,self,,,,,

He takes orders without question and will take a bullet for him. He sometimes has to be asked multiple times to do things because he is slow at comprehension. 

Then last episode through me for a curve ball. When he snaps Locke's neck and is taken out of his trance you see Hordor standing there. He looks at Locke's dead body and then looks at his hands, then back to Locke. You can see on his face this deep concern for what he thinks he has done. As if he can't believe that he just hurt someone, or that he is trying to figure out if he hurt Locke. This deep contemplation of what's in front of him and his bloody hands tells me that he is capable of understanding morality and wrong and right. He possibly even understands consequence. Which I wouldn't assume any mentally challenged person would. He was questioning his action and what he had done and why he had done it.

So, I'm beginning to wonder - am I interpreting her character wrong?  Is Melisandre like an onion?  Are there layers there that I'm not picking up on?  I realize she is likely not meant as a purely ""bad"" character, as so few truly fall to either the far left or right of the spectrum but rather somewhere in the middle.

Also noted that Old Nan refers to them as White Walkers, and Bran asks if she means the others.: Bran IV in AGOT (I'm trying to be super careful with spoiler tags, tagging this may very possibly be too careful, so look at your own pace I guess) [AGOT](#b ""Oh, my sweet summer child, Old Nan said quietly, what do you know of fear? Fear is for the winter, my little lord, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep and the ice wind comes howling out of the north. Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides its face for years at a time, and little children are born and live and die all in darkness while the direwolves grow gaunt and hungry, and the white walkers move through the woods. You mean the Others, Bran said querulously. The Others, Old Nan agreed. Thousands and thousands of years ago, a winter fell that was cold and hard and endless beyond all memory of man. There came a night that lasted a generation, and kings shivered and died in their castles even as the swineherds in their hovels. Women smothered their children rather than see them starve, and cried, and felt their tears freeze on their cheeks. Her voice and her needles fell silent, and she glanced up at Bran with pale, filmy eyes and asked, So, child. This is the sort of story you like? Well, Bran said reluctantly, yes, only... Old Nan nodded. In that darkness, the Others came for the first time, she said as her needles went click click click. They were cold things, dead things, that hated iron and fire and the touch of the sun, and every creature with hot blood in its veins. They swept over holdfasts and cities and kingdoms, felled heroes and armies by the score, riding their pale dead horses and leading hosts of the slain. All the swords of men could not stay their advance, and even maidens and suckling babes found no pity in them. They hunted the maids through frozen forests, and fed their dead servants on the flesh of human children."")

Also, I forget which episode it is but in Season 1 of the show, but Osha(spelling?...the wildling who's with the group that almost kills Bran, but then Robb/Theon come to save the day) comes up to Bran while he's sitting at the tree, and Hodor comes up naked and she says something about him having giant's blood in him

My theory is that Nan is originally a wildling, and since she is Hodor's great-grandmother, Hodor actually has 'giant's blood' via Nan's heritage or possibly whoever Nan's baby daddy/Hodor's great-granddad is is a giant

I've heard Dornish theories, so I thought this may just be an interesting/different take on things. Or maybe it's already (dis)proven.

Thoughts all jumbled, he walks back to his meager chambers with an insatiable thought that it could; SHOULD be his if he has anything to say about it. Why shouldn't he? He follows orders without question and fulfills his duties without complaint. Any lord would be lucky to have him. He doesn't like those games the lords play, never has, never will. They don't regard him as a person, just a tool. Tonight is the night though, and he wants it all to himself. Arriving at his chambers, he grabs the little pouch that started it all. The contents reassure him that everything in the world can, and will be right. He dons his cloak, and a sack of rations and some travelling gear, and heads out without a single word.

Not long into his journey he has a small following of peasants. ""Spend money to make money."" Some advice from a poor farmer he had killed three villages prior. The man thought he could best him one on one, but he simply wanted what the farmer didn't even have. If the farmer had understood he wouldn't have been killed. His advice somehow made sense to him and stuck though, so spend money he did. He started buying up any man he could find, and men are cheap. They fought for any cause as long as the gold was right, and that wasn't that much. Donned with makeshift and simple weapons, he had about forty men at his...command? I guess they would be now. He was the one who paid them. Without even speaking, they just seemed to follow him. Waiting for some command, but none came, so on they walked.

After two months of traveling they are just a few days away from their target. He can't wait to simply hold it all in his hands. It will all be his and no one can tell him otherwise. NO ON- ""Halt right there! What is your purpose with all these people? The city is closed, turn back immediately or you will be put down!"" The red man on the pale horse shouted from afar. It jarred him out of his thoughts, and into utter confusion. Staring open mouthed at the...knight, he didn't know what to say. What could he say in these circumstances? In front of him were a hundred men, most on horses wearing their shiny armor, with their shiny weapons...should he just turn back? He was so close to his target, but was what little bloodshed there had been necessary? ""Oy, and who are you to command us?!"" some man under his command shouted. The man on the pale horse shifted in his saddle and shouted angrily, ""I am Lord Roland Crackehall, bannerman of Lord Tywin Lannister, and you will turn your gathering north or be cut down! The armor alone had made up his mind. With a yell he brandished his mighty weapon and charged. One thousand able bodied men charged right beside him. Lord Roland Crakehall gave the command and the Lannister men charged as well. Lord Roland was his, and with a mighty sweep of his weapon, he rolled inside the lance strike aimed at his chest and hit the horse in the head. Both the pale horse and this false Lord went falling into the mud. He got to Roland before he could recover having his leg crushed under his horse and through the pleas of, ""please...wait!"" He struck him in the head. It only took one blow which it usually does. The battle lasted a half hour, but they had won. Gathering all the nice armor and weapons, they headed towards their final destination.

The city gates were tough but they managed through with only losing a couple hundred men. Sure, battling through the city was even harder, but they endured with only several hundred more losses. No one had expected them. No one. It must have been sheer luck that the late Lord Roland had even come by them. It was even more luck that saw to every one of Roland's men dead before one could think to escape. One thing his army did know, and that was circle and overwhelm by sheer numbers. He wasn't a tactician but it worked. He can see his target a hundred yards away. It's now or never. The Red Keep put up a good fight, but they might as all be rabbits to him. No one has stood a chance between his goal, and his fury. Down to his last hundred men, He storms into the throne room and doesn't even hesitate. The sniveling boy king in the chair is guarded by only four Kingsguard! He charges the first two in the middle, and forget honor, his goal is right there! He swipes aside a lunge with his weapon and spins inside the blades reach and hits the Kingsguard right in the head killing him instantly. The last of his men storm the two on either side of him as he faces off against the last. With the nasty smirk he can see through the guard's helm, the guard lunges. He goes to parry, but it was a feint! The guard pulls to the side mid-lunge, and overbalanced the peasant leader is open to attack. He couldn't get his weapon around in time and takes stab through the crease in the side of his plate armor and starts to bleed. The first blood that has been drawn from him this whole journey! He is furious now. The guard laughs and takes a swipe at the onlookers to keep them at bay. He wants this fight to be one on one. The keep is already theirs, and the boy king surrounded by his men. It's just this guard that is in his way. Without thinking he charges headlong and ignores the back step of the guard and the swipe to keep him back. It hits the side of his armor, and like seven hells he cares! It's what armor is made for, right? The look of shock on the kingsguard face was priceless. Instead of bowling him over, he stops just inside the guards' reach and holds tightly to his sword arm and takes a swing at his head. Of course his other arm came up to block, but that just means it takes more swings. Never the waster of time, the peasant leader walks up to the crying boy king, lifts his billy-club without a word and crushes the side of the cowering boys head. His head wasn't fit to wear that crown. With his mouth opened and visibly shaking from excitement, Mord lifts the golden crown from the boys head and places it on his own. In what seemed to be a moment of shock, Mord takes a seat on the uncomfortable chair in a moment to collect himself. He forgot there are others with him. He slowly lifts his head to look upon the last noble men of the bloodied band of peasants, and what he sees his a mixture of looks. Some of pride, and some of questioning. ""What do we do next my...king?"" One well armored peasant asks. He sits for a few seconds with an inquisitive look on his face and turns to the man and simply says, ""More...gold...""

Not a reader.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/251234/all_spoilers_can_i_bring_up_a_few_questions/,ThePiderman,1399541400,"I've not read the books, and I have a few questions when it comes to the White Walkers. 

In the fourth episode we see what seems to be a counsil of white walkers. Are these the only ones? I doubt this, but quite a few people are saying this on different forums.
People are saying the 13 WW's we see are the remains of the 13 lord commanders, up to the Night's King? This is a good theory, and I like it. What I know about the Night's King, I've read on forums, or on wiki's. The Night's King was seduced by a female White Walker, and at one point he took off with her, and dissappeared. That's all I know. If the theory about the 13 WW's being lord commanders is to be true, how did the other lord comanders die/dissappear? Does anyone know this?

Another (not so famous) theory is that the 13 WW's are the Last Hero and his 12 men who went out to seek out the last Children of the Forest.



So my questions are: 

1. How many WW's are there? I'm guessing there aren't just a handfull, about the size of the counsil shown in s4e4?

2. How did The Night's King dissappear, and maybe become a WW?

3. If the 13 WW's are in fact the Night's King and his 12 predecessors, how did they turn as well? Did they all just walk out into the woods, or did they die, and got resurrected by the WW's, and in turn turned into WW's?


EDIT:

So the way I understand, nobody knows a whole lot about the WW, and what people are saying about them are mostly speculations.. Thanks for filling me in guys. Looking forward to hearing more about the WW's as the new books come out :)",13,1,False,self,,,,,

I mean, it hasn't bothered me for a while, but when the show brings back up the fact that he was the First Sword of Braavos and that it's a little weird that he would be killed by Ser Meryn Trant, it started to make me wonder again.

If you can, go back and watch that scene, and where it sounds like Trant is killing Syrio, it could actually be interpreted as other people fighting around Arya as she flees. Trant also never brags about killing him, which I think could be a thing to brag about. But perhaps not.

I don't believe any crackpot theories like that he is the Faceless Man, but I've come to abide by this rule in fiction; if there's no body, then the person's still alive. It also reads into his whole philosophy. The whole, ""What do we say to the God of Death? Not today."" Goddamn, if he's still alive, I want him to say those words when he meets Arya again.

I'm not saying he's immortal; Valar Morghulis, but I sincerely believe he's not dead based on the facts that we've been given so far. And it would perhaps be one of the best things to happen to Arya, because that kid's life has been shitstorm after shitstorm.

Thoughts?

EDIT: Also, if Syrio had escaped, I don't think Trant is the kind of person that would own up to letting him escape, let alone tell anyone if Syrio had beaten him with a broken wooden sword (which I think is possible).",49,3,False,self,,,,,

In the books we get all the horror he causes, the murder, the rapes, the overall brutality. I'm trying to remember anything he did in the series after killing his horse and trying to kill Loras, but I couldn't come up with anything. I know he was *present* at some later point, but he didn't do anything memorable.

Now I know we will/ are supposed to be on Oberyn Martell's side during the duel regardless - even if only because Tyrion's life is at stake, but in my opinion giving us at least 2 little scenes per season showing what a monster the Mountain is would make everyone want for Gregor to *die* that much more.

I am enjoying it but I just don't feel quite as much enjoyment as I did in season 1-3.

I felt in season 1-3 I really got attached to some of the characters. Maybe it's the fact so many are being killed off?

I don't really feel like the 'queen of dragons' story is going anywhere and it just feels a bit repetitive in this season. I wish I could explain it better but I just can't put my finger on why this season just feels off. I feel likes some of the stories don't really seem to be going anywhere.

Anyone else feel the same? I felt like season 1-3 was going in a direction now the story sort of seems all over the place. It's still a great series though and I'm very much enjoying it still and the acting is great.

She was willing to fight by Jon and defend him, but Tormund was keeping her back, telling her ""He's one of them. He's one of them."" 

Even in S04 E01, the scene where they are talking when Ygritte is producing arrows? 

&gt; And you plan to stay here scratching your balls until winter? 

Her being so straightforward and again Tormund trying to reason with her. 

It's somewhat odd...Tormund being so fierce and all, he wouldn't tolerate such talk from his other men or in the scene with Jon Snow attacking, you would imagine Tormund would attack Ygritte as well for standing up for Jon...but he doesn't...like he is trying to protect her or something. 

Would like to know if there is more about their relationship in the books?

There's a lot of huffing about how Book Shea is obviously only with Tyrion for the coin, and TV Shea is very sympathetically written. The concern is that her discovery with Tywin will have a drastically different emotional impact in the show if things continue as such.

I'm wondering--have they mentioned Tyrion's first lady love on the show? If they haven't, I get the feeling they are eschewing the full backstory in lieu of having only Shae. 

If they have mentioned her (which is my guess), they may be trying to set her up to parallel his first paramour. They might have some trouble telling the story of what happened with her without the use of flashbacks, and I don't see enough time to flesh out the backstory more before everything goes down. Thus, my guess is that they are purposely making Shea sympathetic, then having her *unwillingly* sleep with Tywin--or, at the least, unemotionally. Tyrion finds them, freaks out, and kills her before she can explain. It gives us the visual impact of Tyrion's first relationship, in a way that adds to the pain, both past and present. 

I just got off work and am tired as balls, and I hope this makes sense, but the idea has been bouncing around all night and I at the least want to know how much they have developed Tyrion's first romance backstory in the show. Thoughts?",35,27,False,default,,,,,

He will have to flee King's Landing to escape her assassins, I'm not sure who will help him, possibly Shae and Bronn since Shae clearly didn't get on that boat. On top of that there are going to be complex political motions depicted at work in the coming episodes, with the Tyrell house forming a ""formal alliance"" with the Lannisters by way of marriage of which not a bit makes Cersei happy at all. Tommen's wedding might be next episode or the episode after that, who knows. Still curious as to where Varys will play his part in all of this.

 I also see way too much awesomeness culminating at Castle Black! How many armies does that makes that now? The Bolton bannerman looking to kill Jon Snow and his brothers, Brienne of Tarth (Not exactly an army), reinforcements from the south, Mance Raider. I feel like I'm forgetting one. This is shaping up to be an insane battle and I'm pretty excited for it.


 Danny is gonna keep being Danny and try to retake slavers bay, potentially just decide to become queen of all of a united Essos, or at least the southern parts. I really really really hope she gets her shit together and realizes she would slice through King's Landing like a hot knife through butter, but oh well. Hopefully Daario does something awesome to get her pointed in the right direction. 

As far as the Eerie goes, I'm too terrified to predict what will happen there, when an extremely intelligent, cunning, ruthless man meets a psychotic woman meets a social inept psychopathic Prince meets the Lady whose name can't be spoken but will apparently become a ""Lady of the Vail"" when she marries Robyn (Eww) in a fortnight.

 Brann is going to keep going north. Maybe one day this century he'll find the right tree. Unlikely though. 

(Note, I have not read any of the books and have only watched the TV shows)

**TL;DR: It's gonna be a lot more episodes depicting delicate political relations and how hard the Lannisters are about to use the Tyrells.**

2413,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2014-5-10,2014,5,10,2,2558l4,self.gameofthrones,[All Spoilers] A Theory on Stannis's Portrayal,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/2558l4/all_spoilers_a_theory_on_stanniss_portrayal/,[deleted],1399657946,"One of the enduring controversies of the adaption of ASOIAF into a TV show is the portrayal of the One True King of Westeros^TM, Stannis Baratheon. In the books, Stannis is a boss. He uses the Red God far more than the Red God uses him, clearly cares deeply for the welfare of those under him (he's the only claimant in the War of Five Kings that would only expect to eat after his men are fed), and, in perhaps the ultimate deciding factor as to the likeability of a character, possesses a certain dry wit. Stannis is, in short, the Mannis.

Show Stannis is... less so. It's often (rightly) complained that Stannis's best moments don't make an appearance, and that others are stripped of fairly crucial context (I will begrudge the way the show handled the execution of Alester Florent until the day I die). I've heard it said that one can tell a book reader from a show watcher by their opinion on Stannis. There's a number of explanations for this, most prominently that David Benioff and D. B. Weiss are simply personally ill-disposed towards Stannis (that comment about Renly  ""unquestionably"" making a better king than Stannis didn't help matters).

With this in mind, allow me to present my own, slightly more optimistic theory. D&amp;D have never shied away from adding themes to the show that were less prominent, absent, or simply more subtle in the books. Chief among these is the question of what power is and who deserves to have it (remember [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpL6Fwu0wkw)?). With this in mind, Stannis's portrayal as a less competent king than Renly becomes more explicable, allowing the writers to explore whether the right to rule supersedes the ability to rule. Stannis's story becomes the tale of one who grows from someone who believes himself the rightful king by virtue of his blood to being someone who has won acceptance in the eyes of his subjects as a leader of men.

If there's one message you can boil Game of Thrones down to, it's that power is all in your head. Power resides where men say it resides, and nowhere else. What I'm hoping to see is the same message running through Stannis's future adventures in the North; after realising that he has been trying to win the throne to save the kingdom, rather than saving the kingdom to win the throne, Stannis comes into his own as Stannis the Mannis rather than Stannis-the-Brooding-Jackass. 

**TLDR** It is the nature of TV shows that, for brevity's sake, they must exaggerate certain aspects of a character and downplay others. I'm hoping that Stannis's portrayal is an example of this, rather than an example of a D&amp;D hate-boner having too much influence over the script.

Am I missing something here? The Dothraki are savages. They pillage and do whatever the hell they want. How in the world would they be able to take - and HOLD King's Landing? And why was it said that the Westerosi could not beat them in the field? They don't wear armor of any kind.... from a distance they could be taken out by a good number of archers alone.

I haven't read the books, but this is what I think: It still applies. Just look at modern politics - are the most knowledgeable people the most powerful? Definitely not. We can also bring in examples from other fantasy series, like Harry Potter. Ravenclaw house values knowledge and learning for their intrinsic value, not for the sake of advancing one's interests. Ravenclaw doesn't produce the most powerful wizards, because a Slytherin would use his intelligence to get ahead. 

Littlefinger does have a point though, because only the smart survive in GoT. (However I find it interesting that Tyrion, who is one of the most intelligent characters, doesn't seem all that concerned with advancing his own power) Thoughts? ",25,8,False,self,,,,,

Shouldn't there be a bounty out for his head? I mean, what he did has to be punishable by death in the Game of Thrones world, but you would think that if Polliver recognized the Hound, and he acknowledged the fact that he wore the King's colours, he would know that there was a bounty to kill the Hound, yet all he did was say how he was essentially disappointed that someone as awesome as the Hound bailed on his duties.

The Hound is a badass, and it seems like chances are much improved that if he were at the Royal Wedding, it would have greatly improved the chance that he would have intercepted the poisoned wine, and things would have happened much differently.

Firstly about Robb Stark and the Frey's. If I am not mistaken, in season 1 when they cross the bridge, the Freys send all but 500 men to help Robb in his war against the Lannisters. Why then is Robb compelled to go ask Frey for more men? It seems like they are already fully committed to the war effort.

Second question is about Yara and the Greyjoys going to get Theon. It looks like we finally get to see the Greyjoy Bolton clash this next episode. How did they get there? After looking at the map between the Iron Islands and the Dreadfort there doesnt seem to be any rivers that lead even close to the Dreadfort that arent from the eastern sea and I thought they were sailing right there?

He just seems to show many of the behaviors of a conservative, closeted gay man. It is mentioned more than once the Stannis is just uncomfortable with women in general, even though he's well into adulthood. He seemed to truly hate that anyone was aware that Renly was gay, even to the point that he pretty much didn't bat an eye at killing him. In the years prior to the events of the show/books, he seems to have been totally content with a wife who had little interest in sex, and he seems genuinely baffled at why Robert had sex with so many women and fathered so many bastards. Even with Melisandre who seems to be able to use her sexuality to easily influence so many men (more with suggestions than actions), Stannis only actually has sex with her when she promises that she can give him a son.

Being someone who is so obsessed with ""what is right"", I just feel like his actions are consistent with someone who is gay but who feels that *he's not supposed to be*, and so is therefore trying to go through the bare minimum actions to ""prove"" to himself that he isn't, while also never actually acting on his true feelings because that would be ""wrong"". 

The main reason this would even matter is that knowing what's really going on in his head would inform and predict his future actions. People who have secrets that eat at them from inside eventually reach a point where the stress of keeping them hidden becomes too much. I could see another plausible explanation being that Stannis is just a mostly non-sexual person, but that doesn't seem to explain all of the things...",25,5,False,self,,,,,

* The show calls it the Three - Eyed Raven while the Wiki calls it the Three - Eyed Crow. Which one is it?

* Its name is Brynden and it's not an actual bird, but some dude. Is this guy human?

* Why is he called The Last Greenseer? Jojen has greensight and so do others.

* Apparently he lives with some Children of the Forest, is this correct? If so, how many Children remain?

* Apparently Ravens know True Tongue. So... can they speak? Also why can't anyone other than the Children learn this language?

* What exactly are the Others doing in the Lands of Always Winter?

* Jon Snow is supposed to be Azor Ahai. What relation does Azor Ahai have with R'hollor and is Jon... basically Azor Ahai as he was before, as in appearance, ability, etc.?

Then there was the scene where she poked him with needle but didn't make it through his armor. Was she actually trying to harm/kill him here or was it more her being really pissed off but knowing that no harm would come due to his thick armor?

Thinking back, what I now don't get is Baelish's strategy when he visited Catelyn Stark in Renly's camp. He started by suggesting (I think sincerely?) that Ned Stark's beheading gave them a chance to be together, which predictably went over badly. He then immediately switched back to the Baelish we know, lying that the Lannisters have both Sansa and Arya and that he can return them both.

So what was his plan if Catelyn had accepted his advances? Shove Lysa out the Moon Door?

My theory is that the ending will be something much bigger than any sort of powerful house having control, it has to be something on a larger scale. *Valar morghulis* has become the theme of the show, which basically shows that man is mortal, and something beyond man will the only thing that remains.

I thought it'd be neat to be able to have these as a wallpaper on my phone, automatically changing to a random one very so often.

Another great thing about Beautiful Death is that they accept fan artwork, so you also have the option to include those when a new image is chosen. I'm open to adding more options too. Let me know what you think!

In the show, when Ramsey cuts off Theon's penis, you know it happens right when it happens (or at least, you know it's about to happen and then they cut away). In the books, it seems like GRRM never literally comes out and *says* that it happened at all. He gives various hints that many people could add up to take the fact as a given, but it seems like there is still *some* room for it to be not quite that (like maybe he cut off one of his testicles instead, or something). Not that I'm theorizing such, but I'm just curious--for people who read the books first, was it a long time before it was clear what had happened? It seems like the way it is depicted in the book it's meant for you to very, very slowly put the pieces together from Reek/Tyrion's internal monologues, which gives his scenes a very different feel than if you have clearly known what happened since the time it happened.

&gt; (Se2Ep6) 

&gt; (Robb Stark) And Theon. I want him brought to me alive. I want to look him in the eye and ask him why. And then I'll take his head myself.

------
And later, when talking to Roose Bolton about how to handle him:
&gt; (Se2Ep8)

&gt; (Robb Stark) Any Ironborn who surrender will be allowed to return safely to their homes.

&gt; (Roose Bolton) A touch of mercy is a virtue, your grace. Too much...

&gt; (RS) Any Ironborn with the exception of Theon Greyjoy. He betrayed our cause. He betrayed me. We will hunt him down no matter where he runs.

&gt; (RB) I expect his countrymen will turn on him the minute they have the offer.

And Roose bolton does send Ramsay after him, Theon is betrayed by the Ironborn at the end of Season 2, and Theon lives in eternal fucking hell for the rest of the series (at least up to Se4Ep6).

~~My question is, did Robb Stark ever find out what was happening to Theon? For the rest of Season 3, Robb never mentions Theon in any way, shape, or form. What, did he just forget with all the war stuff?~~

Never fucking mind, I just watched Se3Ep2, and he thinks Theon escaped with the Ironborn back to the Iron Islands.

Though certainly indefensible, the horrible pain Ramsay put individuals through is nowhere near the scale of the pain Aerys was going to cause: children at play, pregnant mothers, the elderly, couples making love, and hundreds of thousands of other innocents all would have suddenly found themselves dying one of the most agonizing deaths imaginable if Aerys had had his way. This was easily enough for me to consider him the worst person GRRM ever created.

But after the reveal at the end of Oathkeeper, and after spending a couple of weeks thinking about it... I am thinking that Craster might be even worse than Aerys (and, by extension, by everyone else in this series.)

I believe that the ""game of thrones"" will ultimately be largely irrelevant and the threat of the White Walkers will be the most significant force in Westeros. How the White Walkers' invasion of Westeros will end, I have no idea, but I believe that it will happen, and I certainly believe that they at least have the *potential* to utterly destroy the entire continent and all of its inhabitants.

And Craster, as we now know, is giving them the power to do so.

The White Walkers are still very mysterious, and we don't know how many of them came from Craster or came from someone else entirely... but with how many wives and daughters Craster has and with every single one of his sons becoming a White Walker, it's certain that at least a great number of their forces must be from Craster. I find it hard to think that anyone could be worse than this man: the one who has quite possibly doomed *the entire fucking Realm* by giving his children over to the mythical beasts, so that he himself could stay alive and could continue a life that consists solely of raping his daughters, watching their daughters grow up, and then raping them as well.

Is *anyone* worse than this? Can anyone compare to the abusive, incestuous rapist who is giving the White Walkers the army they need to potentially ravage *all of Westeros?* After the reveal that Craster is the father of many of the White Walkers, who do you think is the worst human being in the series: Craster, Aerys, Ramsay, or someone else?",130,139,False,self,,,,,

A lot of people speculated that she will get a raven of Balon's death at some point, and she'll return to the Iron Islands. I don't think that's gonna happen, because I think Balon won't die this season.

In the books, the timing of Balon's death before Robb and Joffrey isn't as important as the timing of his death in relation to the return of Euron. Very purposely, Euron is supposed to arrive right after Balon falls to his death [Theory](/g ""Considering it seems that Euron paid a Faceless Man to kill Balon."")

Since we've heard no news on casting for Euron (or Victarion, or Euron), it's safe to say the Ironborn story will be pushed to Season 5. The introduction of Euron should also coincide with Balon's death.

What does this mean for YarAsha's story? Well, she almost certainly won't succeed. At the same time, I don't think she'll be captured by Ramsay and continue along like that (I've seen speculation that she will not be taken prisoner by Stannis, but by Ramsay, and will go to Stannis with Theon at the TWOW events). I also highly doubt that.

I think they're going to need YarAsha at the Kingsmoot to make things somewhat interesting for the non-readers. Who cares that three people we've never met are going to be vying for the Seastone Chair?

That's why YarAsha will be defeated, but she will flee, possibly to Deepwood Motte, possibly just back home. When she gets there early next season, she'll find out her father died, and we'll be introduced to Euron, Aeron, and possibly Victarion. YarAsha will be the ""protagonist"" in the Iron Isles, the person to root for. Going to rescue Theon made her sympathetic, and if she acts heroically when she tries to bring Theon back, it'll make people like her more. We root for her in the Kingsmoot, giving us enough time to grow somewhat attached to the Greyjoy Brothers, who we'll be following through Season 5 and 6, and possibly beyond.

These are the three options we I'm thinking we have.

1. Arya kills him to develop her character. 
2. The Mountain kills him as a way to reintroduce him to the viewer  (Cleganebowl GET HYPE)
3. A group of men manage to take him down to earn Tywin's bounty he just set. 

Evidence:

1. Arya: He's on her list, it'd be a dramatic and satisfying scene for television and Arya fans. 

2. The Mountain: The writers need a way to introduce the Mountain, and the Hound also already set up a fight between them in a previous conversation with Arya this season. 

3. Bounty-hunters: Closest to the books, and allows a similar final scene between the Hound and Arya. 

My prediction: 
Ultimately, I think option 3 is the most likely due to Tywin's bounty that was just set, and I believe it will happen next episode. As much as we all want a Cleganebowl, it's not practical geographically or storywise. The writers have taken leaps before to get characters across Westeros between two episodes, so getting the Mountain from the Riverlands to Kings Landing is not that bad, however, I'm having a difficult time thinking up a scenario where the Mountain fatally wounds the Hound, but does not bash his skull in and leaves Arya alive.

Peter Dinklage's conveyal of such rage, passion, and sorrow was more emotional for me than any other scene in the entire show, which is really saying something. I noticed that this was perhaps the very first episode of the show that no Starks were featured. Up until recently the Starks have kind of been the protagonists whereas we view the Lannister's as the antagonists and most people typically root for the Starks. Not sure what this means for the show but I think them playing ""Rains of Castamere"" at the end also kinda symbolizes the rise and fall of the Lannisters. 

On another note, I'm not a book reader so I don't know what's going to happen but I've also been wondering who would fight for Tyrion in his trial by combat. Bronn and Jaime are the obvious choices but I highly doubt Tywin would allow Jaime to fight for him. I had a theory that Oberyn might vouch for him or maybe even fight for him?

He knows his father well enough to know that he only cares about one thing: his legacy. By throwing a trial by combat onto the table, it completely throws Tywin's agreement with Jamie into the shitter. It further throws it there if Tyrion names himself or Jamie as his Champion.  
  
There's several outcomes here. 1) Tyrion dies in the trial by combat, Jamies is now free to remain in the King's Guard and Tywin's legacy dies.  
  
2) Tyrion lives and overcomes all odds. He's thereby declared innocent. Jamie returns to Castlery Rock to rule in Tywin's stead. Tywin's legacy carries on through Jamie
  
3) Tyrion names Jamie, Jamie dies. Now Tyrion is declared guilty and either sentenced to die or sentenced to the wall. Tywin's legacy dies.  
  
4) Tywin names Jamie. Tyrion would name Bronn (or himself) Win or lose, Tywin's legacy is screwed.",24,27,False,self,,,,,

Also why would Ramsay even let them leave after they threaten to take away his ""prize"" and kill his men.

This has to deal with Tyrion's trial by combat and although I may be completely wrong here I'm going to tag it in case it ends up being correct. Stop now if you don't want to read a potential spoiler.

[S4E8-10](#s ""So in each of the 4 trailers released before the season began there is a brief 2-3 second scene where you see a public battle that is being witnessed by an audience. I remembered this scene after Tyrion's trial by combat decision was revealed tonight and so I went back to the trailers to confirm it. One of the fighters, who is using a lance, is definitely Oberyn. The other fighter's face is not clear but judging from his silhouette I am pretty sure it is The Mountain. It would make sense why Oberyn is fighting him then. Not sure if this confirms that Oberyn will be Tyrion's champion but I think it would be the most logical way for this issue to play out. I don't want to know if I'm right or wrong, just wondering if any other show watchers caught this too"")

To that, I say, exactly.

At this point, Tywin doesn't really care if Tyrion is executed, so he's going to call the best fighter he has (The Mountain). So if Tyrion calls for Jaime to be his champion,  he's essentially getting out of the fire, because Jaime's so shitty at fighting that Tywin would be forced to pardon Tyrion, or send a person weaker than Jaime up against him, lest he loses both of his male heirs (albeit he only cares for one of them).

Besides those fight scenes being really silly (Ramsay just runs at 8 men in full armor with shields and they don't even swing at him until he kills one of them) the whole scene was just nonsensical and almost comical. It seemed so out of place in this show and I think the reason is that it never happened in the books. It is a total deviation. Like we saw with the stuff north of the wall some things are going to happen and change suddenly and it probably won't make sense.

I really just do not see what this scene added except possibly reinforcing Reek is Reek. Besides that why the hell did that fight have to be so weird? Well that is because Asha can't get hurt, Theon can't get hurt, Ramsay can't get hurt and Asha also probably needs most of her men still. It was a totally awkward scene where everyone has plot armor except a few extras. Not that show only watchers would know it, but from a book reader perspective it just felt like such a jarring and jumbled mess of a scene.

The end result was nothing. Reek proved his loyalty, but he already did that (And much, *much* better, in my opinion) in that scene where he's shaving Ramsay. Asha came, saw Theon was no more, and left. And now she probably won't be back until next season, or until the last episode of this season. Balon is long dead by this point in the books.

Lately there have been a lot of instances of non-readers correctly predicting the upcoming showdown between the Mountain and the Viper that are downvoted and/or reported.  That is an extreme understatement.  It is reported so often that it is getting hard for the moderators of this subreddit to keep up with the number of reports, which in turn makes it a lot harder for us to quickly see and moderate much more pressing issues.

Book-readers are overwhelmingly *overreacting* to these predictions, assuming that anyone who correctly guesses that Oberyn Martell and Gregor Clegane will be fighting for Tyrion's Trial by Combat must be a book-reader in disguise.  While book-readers masqarading as non-readers does happen occasionally, it is certainly not something that happens often enough for all of these reports to be true.

Furthermore, it is *an easy prediction* for non-readers to make:    

* The title of Season 4 Episode 8 is ""The Mountain and The Viper""
* HBO has shown a scene of these two characters fighting each other in every trailer they have released for Season 4
* Oberyn has blatantly told both Tyrion and Tywin that the reason he is in King's Landing is to exact revenge on the Mountain for his sister's death.

HBO has not exactly been subtle about the fact that this fight is going to happen; in fact they have been pretty blatant about it.  It does not take a genius (or a book-reader) to figure out that this fight is going to take place.

That said, because the event hasn't happened yet, it is still considered a spoiler.  If you are a book-reader and you *know* that this fight is going to take place, you are still not allowed to spoil it or confirm a non-reader's prediction without tagging it for ASOS.

**If you see a non-reader make an accurate prediction in this regard, or any regard really, please make sure you have some reason *other than their accuracy* to believe that they are actually a book-reader in disguise before you report or downvote them.**

---

Also, aside from this specific issue, we have been experiencing a rash of overreactions to spoilers in general.  The proper procedure upon encountering a spoiler is to report it but otherwise ignore it.  Responding to a post with ""OMG SPOILERS DUDE!"" or downvoting it into oblivion actually calls more attention to the spoiler than it would otherwise receive.  This actually makes the situation a lot worse, especially when the spoiler being pointed out is subtle and might have gone unnoticed or un-interpreted by a person who didn't know what they were looking at (e.g. a non-reader).

This has always been the policy of /r/gameofthrones, but due to the recent rise in incidence of this problem, here is quoted the relevent section of the [Spoiler Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/wiki/spoiler_guide#wiki_what_to_do_when_you_encounter_a_spoiler):

&gt;## What to do when you encounter a spoiler

&gt;* **If you encounter a spoiler without proper warning, use the ""report"" link under the post or [message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%23gameofthrones).**
&gt;* When you see a tempting spoiler warning beyond your exposure level, don't look at it.
&gt;* Be conscious of the need to tag your reply to a tagged spoiler with a warning too.
&gt;* Don't reply with a copy of the spoiler in your comment.
&gt;* Don't post an ""OMG that's a spoiler!"" reply.  Doing that draws more attention and makes the problem worse.

---

**TL;DR:**

* Stop reporting/downvoting accurate Mountain vs. Viper predictions unless you have reasonable belief that the poster is a book reader in disguise.
* Stop overreacting to untagged spoilers, especially ones that are vague.  Just report and move on.

Tywin is in a weird position.  His likely champion to defend the crown in the trial by combat is Jaime Lannister.  Jaime doesn't want to kill his brother, and Tywin doesn't want to risk Jaime being killed.  

SO, instead Tywin will select the Mountain to be the champion for the crown.  This will force Oberyn to offer to defend Tyrion.  All season, Oberyn has been obsessed with telling everybody how much he's pissed off at the Mountain for what the Mountain did to his family.

This break also occurred last season between episodes 8 and 9. The reason is the Memorial Day holiday in the US.

HBO noted that the ninth episode of season two, the climactic ""Blackwater,"" suffered a drop of over 500,000 viewers when it aired on Memorial Day weekend in 2012. Especially at such an important part of the season, the show runners and HBO don't want to lose a huge chunk of the audience for an episode.

**Note on Spoiler Scope:** 

For this episode we go strictly back into ""lore"" which means no spoilers will be had.  However I will mention some ""factions"" (such as the Faceless Men) that do exist in Braavos for the purposes of this writeup, and shed some light on a bit of their respective organizations, but I will not spoil what, if any significance they will play in the future of the show. 

---------------------------------------

**A City of Slaves, a brief History of Braavos**

As all the free cities go, Braavos is unique in it's history.  Founded 500 years before the conquest of Aegon I, Braavos was unlike the other Free Cities, never a part of the Valyrian Freehold that dominated the continent of Essos during that time period, yet their history is rooted with the Valyrians.  As you may know the Valyrian Freehold practiced and was strongly influential in the wide practice of trading slaves in Essos.  The slaves of Valyria were very diverse, who worshiped many different religions, and very different backgrounds and cultures.  It was one particular slave population working in the mines of the Valyrian volcanoes that would be the future settlers of Braavos.

The miners of the mountains led a rough life, even by standards of normal slave treatment.  However the slaves found community among one another despite their vastly different backgrounds and places of origin.  In this population of slaves it was a group known as the ""Moonsingers"" that led a mutiny against the Valyrian slavers and escaped their captivity. The Moonsingers led the slave population away from the Valyrians and eventually to the north-west tip of Essos and founded the City of Braavos.  The location of the city was kept secret for hundreds of years, for fear of the Valyrians until the Freehold was disbanded after the Doom 100 years before Aegon's Landing.  This history has earned Braavos it's nickname as ""The Bastard Son of Valyria"".  And thus the city has thrived for the past few centuries, to become one of the largest ports of call in all the known world, and one of the most culturally diverse....

-------------------

**Braavosi Culture and way of life**

- Geography and Governance

Braavos, aside from its history, is also unique in the layout and organization of the city.  The city was built upon hundreds of small islands in a large lagoon, the city (geographically speaking) is a clear allegory to the city of Venice Italy, and the city structure is very much similar.  Transportation through the city primarily consists a system of linked bridges and large systems of canals flowing through the city.  The city has many harbors which has led to a large economy based off of trade.  In many ways Braavos is somewhat of a gateway between Westeros and Essos, as many of the goods going from one world to the other go through the city. 

The city is also unique that it's ruled by a man known as ""The Sealord of Braavos"" who resides at the Sealords Palace, it is unique because the Sealord is not inherited from father to son, but chosen by the people when the previous Sealord dies.  The Sealord also keeps a constant companion and champion by his side, known as the First Sword of Braavos, Syrio Forell once held this title.  

- Sights and population of Braavos

Braavos is very much a living city, there are sights to see and very colorful characters that a traveller would interact with while staying there.. The most notable of which is the ""Titan of Braavos"" that guards the city.  Inspired by the Colossus of Rhodes in Greece, the Titan of Braavos is a large statue of stone and bronze that guards the entrance to the city.  Not only does the Titan serve as a symbolic guard to the city it is also a practical protector as well, and is equipped with measures to keep out unwanted guests such as murder holes, and slits for archers, as well as a large horn to send a warning to the city it keeps watch over.   The Titan is noted by the famed traveler and author Lomas Longstrider as one of the nine wonders made by man.  

Braavos is also noted for another engineering feat in it's large and magnificent system of aqueducts that run through the city.  As the water of the city itself is very dirty and unsafe to drink, the founders of Braavos engineered the system to bring water from the mainland into the city, it's large arches can be seen throughout Braavos.  

It's not only technical marvels that define Braavos, as the city is also famed for some of it's people.. One group of which are the courtesans.  Considered the most beautiful women in the world, they are lavished upon by the richest of Braavosi nobles. These Courtesans each have their own barges from where they work and many a person are known to sell their entire fortunes for one evening with them...  The Courtesans however are not the only notable group in Braavos, there is also the Bravos.  The Bravos are the young men of the City, full of pride and thirst for blood, as they prowl the streets after sunset challenging any man who carries a sword to a duel.  They will leave unarmed men alone, but rest assured if you carry a blade and walk Braavos at night, you will be challenged by the Bravos.  The evenings here are indeed ruled by the Bravos and Courtesans. 


- Religion

Given the large and different backgrounds of those that founded Braavos, it is very noteworthy that religious practice in Braavos is just as diverse.  All gods of the known world have a place in the city, and given the large amount of trade and visitors from other lands, you will find your place of worship in the city.  In the center of the city there is an island known as the ""island of the gods"" where large temples of many a religion can be found, the largest of which is the religion founded by the escaped slaves of Valyria, the Moonsingers.  Also temples for R'hllor can be found there, as well as a large sept for those who practice the faith of the seven, and even a monument to the Drowned God of the Iron Islands, ironically located in a sunken part of Braavos known as the ""drowned city"".  However, the most curious and the most notable of the faiths and temples of Braavos is that of the ""Many Faced God"" a religion practiced by the ""Faceless Men"" (more on them in the next section).  According to that faith, there is only one god in who has ""many faces"" and all the other religions worship this deity as well.  The faith of the seven call him ""The Stranger"", the worshipers of R'hllor call him the ""Great Other"".. the dark aspects of all the world's religions are actually different faces for the ""Many Faced God"" in which the Faceless Men worship.. The faith is practiced in the Temple known as the House of Black and White.

-  Iron Banks and Faceless Men

I want to discuss for a second on the book's depiction on the Iron Bank of Braavos.  So far the show has made them into somewhat of a larger player they are (or have been to this point) in the books.  The show is correct in stating that they are the largest lenders of money in the known world and that the Iron Throne owes millions in dept to the Iron Bank, and it is a debt that the Throne continues to ignore.. In the books a representative for the Bank comes to King's Landing to discuss the crown's debt and is neglected attention by the then Hand of the King Tyrion Lannister.  The bank however has a reputation of being efficient debt collectors, as Tyrion mentions in season 3, that if the Iron Throne defaults on their debts the Iron Bank will finance their enemies, and that is what we have seen on the show in their backing of Stannis Baratheon.  (Though at this point in the books, this has not happened, the Iron Bank is still attempting to get an audience with the court at King's Landing, and have not met with Stannis).  This method has worked for the Iron Bank many times before as former rulers and leaders who have defaulted on loans have historically been replaced by those now backed by the Iron Bank.  

Lastly I want to bring up the order of the Faceless Men, who as I mentioned practice the religion of the Many Faced God.  As worshippers of that faith they believe that death is a ""gift"" one that ends suffering.  In their temple members of the public who wish to end their suffering can visit the order drink of a liquid and find a peaceful end.  Their history is rooted in this belief, and predates the founding of Braavos.  While in those same mines as the rest of the former Valyrian slaves the faceless men formed their religion, they offered their form of mercy to those slaves suffering and wishing for a release of torment, and later offered the ""gift"" to their slavers as well, implying they had a large part to play in the mutiny that freed them along with the Moonsingers.  

The Faceless Men forsake their identities when joining their order, and have the unique ability to change their appearance at will, as we have seen on the show with one particular member, the one known for a time as ""Jaquen H'ghar"".  The most notable characteristic of the Faceless Men is the services they offer to the general public, as they are the most skilled of assassins in the known world.  They will kill anyone who wishes to pay them believing it as a sacrifice to the Many Faced God.  However the Faceless Men are incredibly expensive to purchase, and the higher prominence of the target, the higher the price. In fact during the events of ""A Game of Thrones"" the possibility of hiring a Faceless Man was brought up by King Robert's Small Council to kill Daenerys Targaryen after she was wed to Khal Drogo.  The notion was dismissed as the cost would have been too high for the already finically troubled throne... this quote from Littlefinger to Robert's council will give you an idea of the prices of Faceless Men..

&gt; Do you have any idea how costly they are? You could hire an army of common sellswords for half the price, and thats for a merchant. I dont dare think what they might ask for a princess.

--------------------------------------

So, that is the city of Braavos.  A great city, with an iconic history and wonderful depth of culture, full of trade and a diverse group of people. What role will this city play going forward?  Stay tuned to find out (or you could read the books and find out....).  That does it for this week, I hope you all have enjoyed reading once again, and until next week, Valar Morgulus.

I don't remember why I always have had it in my head that Jaime and Cersei were raised since kids to think they needed to interbred to keep their blood line pure, but that is what I had assumed. But as I go on, it appears that Twyin disapproves of the relations between Jaime and Cersei, and the fact that children resulted from it, and wants Jaime to marry and have legitimate children. So if Twyin didn't bizarrely push Jaime and Cersei into incest, that means they took it upon themselves to fall for each other?

Anyway; it's shown in the first season that Danery's gets her dragons as a wedding gift from Illyrio at her and Khal Drogo's wedding ceremony.  Later when Arya is chasing cats around the Red Keep she finds herself in the bowels of the keep hiding behind a dragon skull while hearing Varys and Illyrio talking and meeting.  So one could infer a couple things here.  Either Varys is himself responsible for giving Illyrio the dragon eggs to then give to Dany, or Varys doesn't know and Illyrio just had access to some old Valyrian relics that he gave over unknowing what they would become.  The second option seems likely since no one seemed to think the eggs were anything other than pretty fossilized relics of days gone by.  However it doesn't seem in keeping with Varys to walk into something unknown and his potential involvement in the gift seems too much to ignore.  What if Varys knew the eggs could bear dragons?  If so that would imply he's far more involved in magic than he has yet admitted.  It would also seem to me to start laying the groundwork for something that's been hinted at around here lately; a Varys Littlefinger showdown.  I mean Littlefinger now holds the key to the North; Sansa Stark and could presumably turn that influence into a fighting force if he played his cards right.  And if Varys did indeed give Dany her dragons he could potentially hold sway over her giving him the army that he seems to lack should Varys Vs. Littlefinger come to pass.",4,0,False,self,,,,,

Even from Episode 1 you can tell that there is some friction.

I read a little bit of the books, but I'm not sure if this is every really mentioned WHY they have such distaste for each other? Or was it that Cersei saw her dwarf/freak brother when he was born and it never recovered from there.

I also think that it might be a competitive relationship. Cersei always felt that she was special (A Lannister, Princess and then Queen, Beautiful, Blonde-haired) and smart. While Tyrion has little going for him upon initial gaze (except his intelligence). 

-----

This my my theory (based on speculation from the show). I bet growing up, she felt like she was the golden-haired prized child (along with Jamie) and Tyrion was this vile hidious mistake that killed their mother. Tyrion (to make himself useful in this world) worked on educating himself and making himself smart.
And at some point growing up, it must have been clear that Tyrion is smarter than Cersei (and smarter than most people). Jamie seemed to embrace his brother, while his sister didnt. Cersei went on to become Queen and felt she was the most important person in the world (and probably smartest).

I can imagine it would be crippling to her ego if Tyrion were constantly proving her wrong (which Tyrion probably did; not to humilate her, but just to do the right thing).
I think they always had a competitive relationship. And since Cersei can't beat Tyrion in intelligence, she can beat him in power and cruelty. 

Last episode was a big example of this. And probably why she felt Tyrion would 'weasel his way out of this' if given the chance.

**TL;DR - They have a screwy competitive relationship which gets worse and worse as the show progresses up to the point we are at**

IIRC all he ever mentioned in the books was asking Dany to reopen the fighting pits, but now in the show, it's immediately established that his father, who was apparently an upstanding dude, was undeservingly killed by Dany's shortsighted notion of ""justice"". Additionally, the impression I got from him in the books is that he was generally untrustworthy, and underhandedly tried to poison Dany in the pursuit of power, but if he still tries to poison her in the show, I'd say it'll look like a son trying to avenge his wrongfully killed father, which honestly kind of makes me root for Hizdahr. Show Dany also managed to piss me off throughout the Hizdahr scene with her arrogance and shitty logic. I'm aware that she's probably just trying to act like that because she doesn't think a Queen should be apologizing, but it was still pretty annoying to watch.

The way I saw this scene:

Hizdahr: ""My father voted against crucifying those children, but was overruled. You killed a man for a crime that he had no part in""

Dany: ""Welp, too bad, he still deserved it because fuck reasoning.""

Hizdahr: ""Can I at least give his body the proper burial?""

Dany: ""WHAT ABOUT THE DEAD CHILDREN!?"" (which the man for whom you're trying to deny a proper burial had no part in)

I realize that she relents in the end and lets him take down his father's corpse, but damn, that scene pretty much hit me over the head with the idea that Hizdahr is some greatly wronged son who lost his upstanding father to a Queen too arrogant to see or admit to her obvious mistake.

First, I have to mention that Bronn does not appear in the books, so any argument that, ""So-and-so is a WAAAAY bigger badass in the books,"" is null and void.

Second, to give book readers a frame of reference, I think it is important that Bronn is selected to train Jaime in swordplay instead of the person from the books.

Now, with Season 4, a lot of people are getting hyped up over Oberyn and The Hound's one-liners and labeling them the Ultimate Bad Asses. How soon they forget that Bronn sits on the Iron Throne of one-liners. And that is my problem: it seems viewers are equating trash-talk for actual martial prowess. 

Bronn, it must be noted, is always ready to throw down. Before the Blackwater, Bronn pushed a naked woman off of his lap so he could step to The Hound, and they were absolutely about to throw down when the alarm was sounded. It was the first time we get the Bronn-Cam shot of his arm behind his back, hand resting on the small dagger he keeps back there. Here, Bronn was totally confidant that he could dispatch The Hound without too much effort and return to his naked lady.

Viewers may also remember when Bronn was called away to Tyrion's chamber (while he was basically face-deep in some lady-crotch). When he got to Tyrion's, Cersei's three guards were outside, and Bronn immediately tried to pick a fight with them (and their leader, MARYN FUCKING TRANT). We get another Bronn-Cam shot of his concealed dagger, and he is stepping forward to start the fight when Cersei exits Tyrion's, diffusing the situation. Here, again, Bronn is overdrafted from the Iron Bank of Fucks To Give, and appears totally confident that he will just slay these three assholes and be like, ""Whattup T?"" afterwards. 

Compare this to some of the other people who are held up as the greatest fighters:
Barristan Selmy? First off, he is old as fuck. In Selmy's big dismissal scene, he SAYS, ""I could still cut through you all like cake,"" but he doesn't step the fuck forward and try to instigate like Bronn would do.

Jaime Lannister? Sure, with two hands he was quite good, but even he admits that his knowledge was all academic (paraphrasing here). Bronn even jokes that his thrust into the King's back was probably pretty as fuck. So in an honorable fight between two men in armor, Jaime could probably win most times. But, notice how in his fight with Brienne, when the odds are not even and the match is not honorable, he loses handily (heyooo), so how about...

Brienne? Beats Loras and beats Jaime. Her fight with Jaime wasn't exactly fair, not because he was tied or anything, but because he had been a hostage for days (weeks? months?), and so wasn't exactly giving 110%. As I said though, I think he lost more because he had never fought at a disadvantage before: tie Bronn's hands together and he fights the same way. Brienne's fight with Loras is undermined when Lady Olenna says, ""You knocked him to the ground like the silly little boy he is,"" or something similar. Not to mention their little scuffle was like an exhibition and not a REAL fight, which is all that Bronn knows. And, again, who is training Jaime to fight southpaw?

Loras? Well, it seems like the show correlates his being gay to being a lesser warrior. We have only seen him in action twice, both of which were in a formal tournament setting. It is easy to imagine that, at a young, gay age, the Tyrells forced him into as many tournaments as possible to cultivate some sense of masculinity. There, he did not learn to fight so much as learn little tricks like riding a mare in heat at a jousting match.

The Mountain? We have only seen him in action once, when he tried to kill Loras after their joust. Rewatch idiot Loras trying to block The Mountain's sword with his own, then picture Bronn ducking and dodging The Mountain's mighty swings. Bronn would rope-a-dope that big bastard so easily that he could pick and choose where to stab him for the final kill.

Oberyn is the only dark horse here to compare, because we haven't seen him fight yet (stabbing some drunk, whored-up Lannister int he hand does not count). I think Oberyn's use of poison detracts from his martial skill: if you know you only need to scratch your opponent to kill them, then you don't really learn how to fight. I know there is a big scene coming up with him in battle but, considering who he will be going up against, I am ready to be unimpressed (this scene appears in one of the Season 4 trailers). In fact, Oberyn's long lance is equivalent to The Mountain's giant sword: just something heavy that burns lots of energy every time Bronn dodges it. And, it should be noted, Bronn and Oberyn bonded when they first met anyway.

In conclusion, there is a consistent point that the show tries to make. It comes up when Littlefinger says, ""There aren't even a thousand swords in the Iron Throne, I've counted."" It comes up again with the quote, ""People love to praise a famous name."" In Westeros, your reputation preceeds you, sticks beside you, and hangs around after you've left. It doesn't matter if, like Barristan Selmy, you haven't drawn your sword in the 20 years since Robert's Rebellion, because the people still praise your name. The traditional knights and warriors who are caught up in the cycle of honor will never stand a chance against Bronn because he realized long ago that there is no honor in death. Knights like the Cleganes, who are great and less-than-honorable fighters, still believe that ""armor and a big-ass sword"" will win any fight. Bronn realized long ago that those things just slow him down, tire him out, and make it hard to fight effectively. 

I hope I have at least sparked a discussion about actual, observed martial skill versus second or thirdhand accounts of some battle a decade ago, since this is a TV show and not some book series slogged down by complicated backstory that has to be taken at face-value. 

Lastly, I have to assume that Bronn did not betray Tyrion regarding Shay. The way he spoke of Tyrion to Jaime while they were training makes me think Bronn truly believed he had done Tyrion good service, and it would be easy enough for Lord Tywin to get his hands on her some other way, especially if Varys was involved.

Obviously, he's gotten a lot worse since then, he's incredibly creepy with Sansa, arranges all sorts of murders, including Jon Arryn. 

Varys creeped me out at first, but I really warmed up to him, especially with all his talk last season about ""for the good of the realm."" I just trust him. But the last episode weirded me out. Not only did he say more than he had to about Tyrion at the trial, but he stared longingly at the iron throne, mentioning that his lack of desire for sex gave him more time to think about this. It didn't seem very ""for the good of the realm"" anymore.

Anyway, I am very interested to engage in some discussion about these characters, their motivations, what makes them different/similar etc. Just more perspectives.

 She then looks so scared when Tyrion asks for a trial by combat...it makes me think that maybe she was promised that Tyrion was going to be allowed to join the Night's watch if she spoke against him but the trail by combat changes everything.

He got Jamie to agree to leave the Kingsguard if Tyrion is spared and goes to the Nights Watch. Tywin and Jamie seemed to be pretty much in agreement and even Tyrion didn't seem to object initially.

The problem is Tywin called the next witness, Shae (which he knew who it would be; plus he asked all the questions). This is what broke Tyrion's heart and pushed him into a rage.

- Does anyone think this was something Tywin wanted to do to get back at Tyrion? That seems to be more of Cersei's thing. 

- Has Tywin been cruel to Tyrion before? (besides the 'whore story'). I always say Tywin more as strict (in a mean fatherly way) than cruel.

I've been discussing this with my friends for a few weeks now. We are all book readers and I was wondering what the community as a whole thinks of the upcoming trial.

Just how bad do you guys think the Mountain is going to fuck up Oberyn? Will it be like in the book where the Mountain will bash out his teeth and splatter his dome all over the place? My buddy Ryan thinks they will tone it down a bit.

On the flip side of that I think the Mountain is going to die so slowly we will wish it was quicker.

But why?

Well firstly, because it shows how Littlefinger has been a trouble maker for a long time, and that he was desperate for Ned to come to KL. 

Secondly, it was huge because we had no reason whatsoever to believe that LF could be behind Jon's death, because as far as we knew LF had nothing to do with Lysa Arryn since between when they were kids and when the Lannister's sent him to the Eyrie. Sorry, but it was a pretty crap ""reveal"" to a mystery if you ask me (which you didn't!).

Thirdly, it was out of freaking nowhere because none of us were even wondering who killed him. Remember in S1.ep04 ""Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things"" where Ned sends Jory Cassell to speak to Jon Arryn's squire who was knighted just after Jon's Death? (The squire is really rude to Jory, as he is a knight and Jory isn't) Well that squire was a Lannister and it was heavily implied that he had poisoned Jon Arryn, as the quire is then killed by The Mountain in the Hand's tourney.

So my point is, that just under the surface, it would seem that the plot is slightly flawed- they cheated us by getting us to falsely join the dots. 

But if you look deeper, LF could still have conspired with the Lannister's and done them a favour, for instance if he'd told Cersei that Jon Arryn had discovered the true lineage of Cersei's children. 

But it does seem that the Lannister squire (of Jon Arryn's) died for nothing, other than to draw attention away from LF &amp; Lysa Arryn. (The Lannister squire would have been suspected at some point, and by him being killed it means the investigation was halted, rather than pursue other possibilities such as Lysa Arryn &amp; LF).. Did LF pay The Mountain to kill him? Were the Lannister's in on their own kin being killed? Or was it just a freak accident?

I'm a reader too, so feel free to add in any details from the books for clarification. You're not spoiling anything for me.

1. When Varys and Oberyn are speaking in the throne room, Oberyn is asking Varys about his desires. Varys states that he doesn't desire men or women and that he's glad he doesn't because that leaves him time to pursue other interests. When Oberyn asks what those interests are, Varys looks at the throne. What did him looking at the throne imply? Obviously becoming king isn't one of his goals.

2. During the trial, Pycelle pulls out the necklace used to kill Joffrey and states that he got it from Ser Dontos. However, didn't we see Littlefinger pull out the same necklace when he was on the boat with Sansa and smash one of the crystals? How did Pycelle come into possession of it?",5,0,False,default,,,,,

If that's true, then Tywin is uncharacteristically unconcerned that there's someone out there who got away with killing a King.  As someone who has taken it upon himself to mold the next one to his will and (presumably) keep him safe, this seems like a tremendous oversight for his future plans.  Tywin Lannister doesn't usually make mistakes like that.  Even assuming he knows or merely suspects the actual culprits or their motivations, would he really value a Tyrell alliance over the life of his grandson and ""rightful"" ruler of the Seven Kingdoms, even if he *was* a complete prat?

For as masterfully as Tywin has been playing everyone during this trial, there is someone out there who is playing him even better.  Tywin actually has very little recourse in what he is doing.  Or maybe he's just that predictable to Littlefinger; the War of the Five Kings more or less began because of how the Lannisters reacted to Tyrion's first frame job, but they appear more than happy to go along with the second one.

Or perhaps Twyin really does believe that Tyrion (and/or Sansa) was behind this.  But then why fabricate testimony and twist evidence?  I get that he's concerned about his legacy, and part of it is a ploy get Jaime to accept his inheritance and to do away with the ""problem"" of Tyrion once and for all regardless of what the truth may be.  However, if that truth is that Tyrion didn't do it (and we know he didn't), Tywin should be deeply troubled.

**tl;dr -- Joffrey's real killer is still out there, unpunished, and Twyin either doesn't know or doesn't care, so long as he gets what he thinks he wants.**  This does not befit such a master strategist and tactician.",5,0,False,self,,,,,

Jamie is a cripple (as well) now, and has no intelligence whatsoever (from what I've gathered) and pretty much spat in his father's face way too many times (by being a KG, screwing his sister, etc...). This is basically brought up completely with Tyrion ""I am guilty of being a Dwarf"". Considering all this, does Tywin really hate him THAT much that he is willing to risk his ""Legacy""?

Sloppy writing?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/25f2y2/s04e06_what_happened_with_this_scene_sloppy/,Apolik,1399950437,"I'm talking about the Yara + Greyjoy warriors vs Ramsay Snow + Bolton warriors scene in the Dreadfort.

- Let's start with the setup: For the Greyjoy side, there are [five ready warriors](http://i.imgur.com/LCcq4fN.png) and Yara + another warrior holding Theon; all wearing ringmail, shields and weapons. For the Bolton side, there are [six ready warriors](http://i.imgur.com/bMUWeIs.png) and Ramsay; all wearing leather armor and only weapons. Numbers are equal, but the Greyjoys seem to be better equipped.

- First slip: Yara is a master axe-thrower (the first guard that dies is at the top of a wall, and she kills him with one shot). Why doesn't she just throw an axe into the bastard's skull the second he steps in? Isn't she supposed to be angry and vengeful at him? What was her monologue when they're still in the boats for, then?

- The battle bursts, and the first thing we see is a naked Ramsay between [three Greyjoy soldiers](http://i.imgur.com/oHFbi9O.png). Completely vulnerable. And nothing happens to him because of it. Second slip.

- The Greyjoy that's directly fighting Ramsay only uses his shield to fight. He strikes only one time with his sword, only after striking with his shield and blocking at least 10 blows. Why use a shield if you're not gonna attack after you blocked an enemy blow? Third slip.

- For the entirety of the fight, Yara and the other Greyjoy never let go of Theon to help their allies in the fight. Only when Reek manages to get inside his cage again they join the fight, and it instantly ends. Fourth slip.

- ~~The most infuriating part of the scene: The fight ends. All the Boltons are dead, and Ramsay is surrounded by 4-5 Greyjoys plus Yara. He's surrounded. The guy who sent the threatening letters and tortured Theon is surrounded by them. And they do **nothing**. They let him talk, they let him free his hounds.~~ This is wrong. There were an equal number of Bolton and Greyjoy soldiers. But we could replace that Fifth slip with a number of things that's been mentioned: they didn't kill the noisy barking hounds, the Dreadfort is in the other side of the continent (meaning you have to sail all the way around Westeros, or run through The North filled with Greyjoy enemies), or the simple fact that the motivation for running away after so much build-up (the ""we're going for my brother"" theme was launched the past season) was ambiguous. 

- Even letting all the previous things pass, the Greyjoys return to their boats safely. Assuming Ramsay liberated his hounds moments after they ran from the scene, there's no way at all that they'd be able to outrun them. Sixth slip.

And that's it. The show is amazing in so many ways, but that scene was almost ridiculous. [Plot armor](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor) isn't fun for any party involved.

What do you guys think about it?

_________________________________________________________________________________________________

**""I DEMAND TRIAL BY COMBAT!""**

**At this point, *EVERYONE*** -- everyone in the court house, including Tywin, Cersei, and even Jaime, along with us readers and viewers -- **is expecting Tyrion to choose Jaime as his champion**.  

This is an obvious choice, since:

*  Tyrion has already requested Jaime once, when Tyrion was accused at the Eyrie (as was reminded to us by Bronn a few episodes ago)
* Also, I believe that members of the royal family are entitled to a knight of the Kingsguard.  I may be wrong about this, but I think I remember reading about members of the royal family who are ***accused*** are entitled to a member of the Kingsguard to defend the accused.  Obviously, this would be a perfect opportunity for Jaime

Now, **it's justifiable and easy to see this as merely a last-second gambit** (or ""Hail Mary"" for football fans), since he's pretty much judged guilty already.  Basically, since Tyrion has *nothing left to lose, he just throws out the TBC demand.*

But the more I think about it, the more I think that there are so many layers to his demand, so many reasons other than ""I'm screwed, I have nothing to lose, I might as well throw this up.""  **This was not merely a desperate last-second cry for help.**

***First***, there's the very important scene -- right before they arrive in the courtroom back from adjournment -- where Jaime informs Tyrion of Tywin's intention to ""spare"" Tyrion and spend his days taking the black.

**All that Tyrion has been told is to ""not worry,"" and that Tywin will spare Tyrion's life by sending him to the Wall.  Tyrion is too smart to take this at face value.  He's too smart to believe that Tywin is granting Tyrion mercy with no expectation of reward.** 

**So -- Tyrion throws a wrench into Tywin's scheme to wrong both Jaime and Tyrion.** 

First, if Tyrion takes the black, he obviously cannot further the Lannister line, as his vows require him to forsake a wife and children.  

We saw that after Sansa and Tyrion got married, Tywin aggressively demanded Tyrion to start pumping out Lannister children.  However, that was when Jaime was gone and arguably left for dead.

**But once Jaime came back, Tyrion was no longer needed for his ""Lannister seed,"" and this is when we see Lannister's resentment to Tyrion reach an all-time high since TYRION IS NO LONGER OF *ANY* VALUE TO TYWIN.**

Therefore, even without Jaime even implying to Tyrion that Jaime has made his own sacrifice to forsake his Kingsguard oath, Tyrion has already deduced that 1) Tywin absolutely needs a son and heir to further the Lannister line and 2) Jaime is both the only and the ""best"" choice to further the line, once Tyrion takes the black.

So, Tyrion has deduced that Jaime has sacrificed himself and agreed to give Tywin his grandson(s), without Jaime telling him that the deal was made.

**Tyrion fully knows that Tywin essentially ""played"" Jaime** and his compassion for Tyrion by putting Tyrion at the chopping block -- so Tyrion deduces that Jaime begged mercy for Tyrion, in exchange for Jaime giving up something he doesn't want to do (his freedom to live his own life and live his life according to oath).

**So, by asking for a Trial by Combat, Tyrion is both putting his and Jaime's lives on the line.**  Obviously, if Jaime loses, Tywin loses BOTH chances of furthering the Lannister line.

**This obviously puts Tywin (and Cersei) at a catch-22 situation.**  They have to root for Jaime to win in order for Jaime to survive so that he can sire real Lannister kids.

Jaime's victory would obviously acquit Tyrion, much to Tywin's chagrin.   If Jaime loses, Tywin loses BOTH of his ""studs,"" i.e. Tywin would lose his means of providing Lannister children (""Studs"" is an apropos term as to how Tywin sees his children.  Last season, Cersei protested being treated like a ""broodmare"" whose only purpose to Tywin was to birth children).

**I don't think Tyrion would have requested TBC if Jaime hadn't told Tyrion of the ""compromise"" from Tywin.  But I think Tywin PLAYING Jaime ticked him off.** 

I think he put together that Jaime begged Tywin and Tywin took advantage of Jaime's ***true*** compassion and family-first mentality.  It was a bit selfish (or strategic) of Tyrion, since Tyrion recognizes that Jaime is a ""new man"" who now takes his oaths and duties more seriously, and being called to defend Tyrion's honor would put Jaime in the tough position to defend his very own blood and a part of the royal family, technically.  Jaime also offered Tyrion whatever help he could, so Tyrion is calling Jaime on that offer.

Basically, Tyrion's supposed last act is basically a FUCK YOU to Tywin and Cersei, at the risk/cost of Jaime's life.  Yes, it's selfish, but it was not a thoughtless, desperation move.

**TL;DR -- Jaime tells Tyrion that Tywin will spare Tyrion's life.  However, Tyrion is too smart to think that the mercy co__mes easily and at no cost.  So, Tyrion invokes Trial by Combat, with everyone expecting him to call on Jaime, which would really, really punish Tywin and Cersei: If Jaime wins, Tyrion is acquitted, and Tywin and Cersei both ""lose""; if Jaime loses, the Lannister name (at least, the direct Lannister line) would perish and Tywin would lose both his sons, and Cersei would lose Jaime.**

PS -- Of course, Jaime being the champion is all moot....",21,5,False,self,,,,,

I just started watching GoT and I tend to get a little confused, partly because I'm not a native speaker, partly because I have a bad short-time memory.

There are tons of character descriptions online, some of them claim to be spoiler-free but they aren't. I realize that many things have to be left out but I don't need a lengthy description. I just want to see a picture of the character and find out what I should know about them the moment they are introduced, nothing more. I don't want to know what position they took after the death of that other character in season two. Nothing that is only revealed later in the series, even if it doesn't have anything to do with the character himself.

Can anyone help me out? I was sure this question would have been asked here a thousand times, but I couldn't find a single thread with this request.

1. How does the ""Demanding a trial by combat"" work exactly? Can you do it everytime you are on trial? And if so, couldn't someone like The Mountain get away with pretty much anything?

2. What is the relationship between Westeros and the free cities across the narrow sea? At first I thought the free cities were nowhere near Westeros in terms of wealth and power, but now that they showed just how much power the iron bank has over Westeros, I'm not sure about that anymore?

She has grown tremendously from a girl afraid of waking up her brother's dragon, to stopping the Dothraki from raping the women after battle, to not depending on a male figure, to taking responsibility of the people she frees and being a regal leader. Now she is learning the gray tones of just and unjust.

That said, hers is the only story line without any true danger. Hear me out.

In Westeros anybody can die no matter how important to the plot line and has happened again and again. For example Tyrion or Jamie could die, his death adding to the Lannister story. Jon could die and what we've seen of him served for Brann and Sam's story. Any character could die having added to other characters experience, the same way Ned's death fueled events for Arya's, Robb's and more.

Any character except Daenerys. She is the only character that can't die, and that is why I don't enjoy her story line as much as the rest. All she has gone through would serve for character building of whom? Jorah Mormont? It doesn't feel like the rest of the Game of Thrones, it is closer to classic good-vs-evil plot-shield fantasy and not the realism that we admire and enjoy so much. 

So my light criticism is that Daenerys' somewhat-parallel story in Essos is weaker. She doesn't have good supporting characters. If she perishes before any major event in her side, we would all be dissapointed of it not meaning anything.

So my question is, how many other people feel this way? Do you agree? Is Daenerys safer than the rest and what does that mean for you?",96,51,False,self,,,,,

And this is the perfect opportunity to do it story-wise. Have Tywin reveal it to Daenerys through a letter.

The ""you are a whore"" scene from episode 2 this season (where Tyrion yells at Shae in an effort to get her to leave) was the first and only frustrating and annoying book-to-show change for me. The minute it happened all I could think of was ""Great. He's giving her motivation to betray him later in the trial. Everyone watching will think she betrayed him partially because of the insults he's throwing at her."" 

In ASOS, her speech about Tyrion's guilt comes out of nowhere. It is a huge shock. After chapters and chapters and books about her being faithful to Tyrion, she viciously stabs him in the back. It is **intense.** After reading about the trial, I hated this lying, greedy bitch more than Joffrey, yet now with one scene, D&amp;D threw that out the window and made her a sympathetic character. My friends don't understand why I hate her so much. Just as I figured, they sympathize with her since Tyrion hurt her. They can actually understand why she would resort to such a malicious lie.

Am I alone in this? I know it's weird to say how this was the only change that annoyed me so soon after the whole internet went up in arms about the Jaime-Cersei-rape scene, but... yeah, that didn't get to me nearly as much as the Shae change. If you only watch the show (and you're in this thread because you don't mind minor spoilers), please tell me your thoughts on her after Sunday night. Does she come off as sympathetic? I'm way too biased in Shae-hatred. If you read the books, what are your opinions on this change of motivation? Will it actually change events in the last episodes of the season? Or will it turn out [ASOS](#b ""she'll still be found sleeping with the enemy and taking bribes from the Lannisters, making her greed a stronger motvation than her hurt feelings?"")",10,6,False,self,,,,,

What he did in S4E6 revealed a lot about him and hinted at a few possibilities. 

I thought it was interesting that during the Small Council meeting, Varys mentioned that the Hound was spotted in the Riverlands, but he made no mention of Arya, who has been by the Hound's side for some time now. Is it possible that Varys is aware of Arya but isn't saying so? 

Also, when he told the Small Council about Daenerys, I remember from Season 1 that he was meeting with Illyrio and making plans pertaining to her. Was he also behind Illyrio giving Dany the dragon eggs? I know Varys does everything for the good of the realm, but has he been secretly backing Dany this whole time? Does he think that she is what's actually good for the realm?

To add to that question, when Varys was talking to Oberyn in the throne room and said that without desire, one could be free to focus on other things (and then he looked at the Iron Throne), was he implying that his main focus, by whatever means necessary, is ensuring that the right person rules Westeros? If so, this is an interesting contrast to Littlefinger, who wants everything, including taking the throne for himself. Is it right to assume that Varys just wants the power that comes with putting the best ruler on the throne? 

Finally, when Varys testifies against Tyrion during the trial, I saw it as a shrewd move by Varys in order for him to remain a player in the game. Varys testifies because it's what the realm is currently asking of him, and he has to stay relevant in order to effect any change later. When Varys tells Tyrion that he doesn't forget anything, is that a hint that he's concocting another plan to somehow help Tyrion?

Littlefinger has been the mastermind behind much of what's been happening around Westeros, but after this episode, I think Varys has been the catalyst behind a lot of current and upcoming events, as well.",30,31,False,self,,,,,

---

###The Onion Knight of Wall Street

&gt; *You may see why those numbers don't appear to add up to a happy ending* - Mycroft Holmes posing as Tycho Nestoris, about the schedules and payrolls of Martin Freeman and Benedict Cumberbatch affecting the future of Sherlock

* First draft, lost yesterday, contained some information about Braavos, but /u/GRVrush2112 made an [excellent post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/25da3a/spoilers_s04e06asos_braavos_the_bastard_son_of/) with much much more information. Go check it out.

* TL;DR of that post: Braavos is a unique city, hidden from the Valyrian Freehold and kept secret until the Freehold collapsed 400 years before the show's events.

* Titan of Braavos is based on a real-life wonder Colossus of Rhodes. You've probably heard of it already, I hope - it's part of Wonders of the World, which was practically the Hellenic version of a Cracked list.

WARNING: This paragraph is heavily influenced by my sympathy to book Stannis's cause. I do not speak for all the book readers.

* Writers hate Stannis. It's difficult to provide a TL;DR of why the book readers tend to like him much more, but long story short book Stanis is a way different character not just in personality (he has a ""personality of a lobster""), but in actions. He doesn't burn people for being heretics, he doesn't lust for Melisandre (he's rather asexual), he doesn't throw leeches into fire without hestitation (especially with Robb's name on his lips), he mourns for his brothers, et caetera. He's probably the most morally conflicted character of the series - he does things because he feels he has to, but has a huge moral hangover about it. Renly's death keeps haunting him and he tells about his dilemmas to Davos, who's outright his consicence.

* This week: Book Stannis never begs for money. Iron Bank approached Stannis on its own will, seeing a great opportunity. At least we got to see Braavos - which is nice.

* Salladhor Saan is a captain-for-hire who Davos personally trusts. He already fought alongside them in the Battle of Blackwater and rescued Davos from the site in the beggining of season 3.

###Unleash The Hounds

&gt; *riot pls nerf* - Asha/Yara about Ramsay's trump card, even though she's the one playing the truly OP Miracle Rogue

* IT WASN'T IN THE BOOKS. This is just infuriating, but I can't really say more than that. You can feel the plot hole's gravity when Asha has a Yara moment and cannot stop Ramsay from ostentatiously opening the cages.

* Asha/Yara disappears from the narrative for the whole A Storm of Swords. This escapade had two purposes: reminding people that she exists and confirming that Theon Greyjoy is gone.

* By the way, here's a handy [map](http://i.imgur.com/QCW0tSK.jpg) showing the distance she had to cover, courtesy of /u/NumberMuncher.

* Have faith. Greyjoys will have their moment, just the storyline juggling postponed a key event in their plot, I would say by a good season now. ASOS is an incredibly intense book and the season split made some significant changes to the timeline.

###Viva La Vida

&gt; *This is the best job ever!* - Daenerys, living her Disney dream  
*Worst. Job. EVER.* - same, after realizing that crucifying people seems quite not Disney

* Drogon is surely impressive, but he's got long way to go to grow as large as the legendary Balerion the Black Dread. Best fan estimates put Balerion's height at over 70 metres, which is larger than Smaug from the Hobbit, Saessenthis AKA [](#s ""Saskia"") from The Witcher 2, Alduin from Skyrim, dragons from Gothic 2, Harry Potter, or pretty much any other story. In real world terms: a jumbo jet.

* The language spoken by the shepherd is either Ghiscari (the language of the old empire that build the pyramids) or Low Valyrian, which is heavily influenced by Ghiscari (Valyrians conquered most of Essos, and people from outside Valyria spoke the new language differently). Daenerys speaks High Valyrian, but occasionally throws in Low Valyrian phrases when addressing slaves.

* Funny names are a commodity in Meereen, but luckily they're introduced in Valyrian, so we get subtitles. Hizdahr zo Loraq is a character from ADWD, so we see the plot accelerating. This is not spoiling Daenerys' lifespan - she doesn't appear in *A Feast for Crows*. But let's be honest, her plot armor at this point is just ridiculous.

* Meereen is a city past its prime. Sure, Dany might (or might not) have brought its doom, but it's not like she blocked its march into greatness. The era of the Ghiscari culture is long gone. As a matter of fact, Meereen wasn't even the capital of the empire - it was Ghis. Unfortunately, Ghis got burned down to ground by Valyrians.

###Let's Officially Ignore Important Stuff

&gt; *Dragons haven't won a war in 300 years* - Tywin Lannister, voicing a totally believable argument against worrying about endlessly growing firebreathing lizards

* Master of Ships is a really empty title at this point. Lannister navy was completely destroyed in the battle of Blackwater - in the books, it wasn't just one ship loaded with wildfire, Tyrion baited Stannis with their whole navy, sacrificing it to bring down the Baratheon forces. Funnily enough, Stannis was the previous Master of Ships, and a very skillful one at that - he suppressed the Greyjoy rebellion, which took place after Robert's and ended with Balon's last son Theon being hostage in Winterfell.

* Master of Coin, the title held formerly by Tyrion, could be ceded to Oberyn, but he doesn't seem to have much experience with finances.

* Master of Laws is a title apparently written off from the show, even though it was Renly Baratheon's job in season one. In the book, that title, which gives power over the City Watch, is curently held by Kevan Lannister, Tywin's brother. Kevan appeared in season 1 and 2 during Tywin's war council and may come back to the show next season, perhaps, possibly recasted.

* Jokes aside, dragons are fearsome, but not unbeatable. Meraxes, one of the three huge dragons that Aegon and his sisters rode, was taken down in Dorne by a ballista shot to the eye.

###OBJECTION!

&gt; *I should have let Stannis kill you all* - Tyrion, realizing he chose the wrong side by opposing One True King

* Trial by combat may be requested at any point during a trial by any party and as far as we know cannot be denied. Can be fought by the parties themselves or their champions. The most extreme version involves using seven champions for both sides, so far it has not been invoked for a hundred years.

* Rickard Stark, Ned's father, demanded trial by combat to free his son Brandon Stark from Mad King's accusations. Aerys Targaryen decided that his champion will be fire, and that all Rickard has to do to win is to not burn. Spoiler alert: Rickard lost the trial.

* Leaving the necklace to be found seems fishy, but fits Littlefinger's actions from the book - he is the one who organizes the dwarf jousting to ensure tension between Tyrion and Joffrey. I've already mentioned it in the previous posts, but the Strangler, poison used to kill Joffrey, is the same substance that maester Cressen used in his attempt to poison Melisandre.

* One passage left from the book I missed was Shae telling about her calling Tyrion ""Giant of Lannister"". The audience erupted in laughter after that. I think that would make the scene even more powerful. What we got in return was Tyrion voicing his regret about saving the city, which in the book remains in his thoughts.

* Overall book Shae seemed more plain and stupid. Believe me or not, but TV Shae has much more personality, even if it's annoying. I think I see the purpose of that change now.

* Finally we got to see the darker side of Tyrion, but the book already has him having a man killed to protect Shae's secret. TV Tyrion is a little bit whitewashed compared to his book version.

* In case you didn't figure it out, request for trial by combat completely wrecks Tywin's plan to regain Jaime and send off Tyrion. If Tyrion finds no champion or loses, he's dead.

* You may feel like ""Rains of Castamere"" have been overplayed by now. You're damn right, and it fits the book very well. Joffrey's wedding had seven different minstrels playing the song. ""Rains of Castamere"" being overplayed is an inner joke in King's Landing, Olenna Tyrell says once ""Play 'Rains of Castamere', I forgot how it went"".

However, as Pycelle revealed in his testimony, they know Ser Dontos' had a part in helping Sansa flee during Joffrey's death and was found dead at sea in a small row boat with the necklace that contained The Strangler poison.

Whether or not Tyrion is found guilty in the trial by combat, they know that others were involved in the plot to assassinate Joffrey and get Sansa out of the city. I'm curious as to what everyone thinks the Lannisters next move will be. Who do they assume helped Sansa flee the city? Could Tyrion have simply paid someone to take Sansa to some far off city in Essos etc? did another family of Westeros still committed to the Starks aid in her escape? Perhaps they could blame Stannis, as this would be an excellent move to stir up trouble in the capital as he regroups.

I instantly recognize that look, it's the very same contemplative look Joffery always had when people questioned him! In fact, for that moment, Tywin LOOKED LIKE Joffery!

I know it's over and there's nothing we can do, but we can analyze and pinpoint the mistakes made.

The scene started off well enough, with a inspiring speech and the boats rowing to the castle. It would have been nice to have witnessed the Greyjoy men really getting amped up for the fight, maybe with them cheering or doing some sort of battle cry. Scaling the wall of the Dreadfort was a good scene, but once again it would have been enjoyable to get another shot or two of the small Greyjoy brigade running towards the wall and scaling it. Fast forward to Ramsey (preferably with some armor on) entering the dungeon area and the fight that ensued. 

Now for the most important changes. It would have remarkably more believable and less criticized if there were a few more dogs (maybe 6) in the cage that Ramsey would have unleashed on the 3 Greyjoys left. Two viscous dogs per person, plus the rest of the Bolton men to trifle with? That would send me running. Following that, Yara questions whether it's worthwhile to save her brother after all this time. She looks at him, with an expression mixed with confusion/sadness/anger. *Cue sad GoT music* Camera shows Theon, looking as if he hit rock-bottom and hit every branch of the way down, then back to Yara where you can see the that she is making a difficult and emotional decision in her head. THEN, you hear bells, yelling, fighting from outside, which clues you in that the town is aware of the intruders. Ramsey doesn't want to risk his precious hunting dogs, but he's about to unleash them. At that point Yara says something along the lines of ""Back to the ship"" and they turn around and walk out of the room. Cut to Ramsey with a wicked smile on his face. 

Now would have been the opportune moment for for a nice small-scale battle scene. Yara and her companions impressively fight their way out to the battlements, where the viewers witness the rest of the Greyjoy soldiers that were standing guard, are now kicking ass. Yara rallies her troops to retreat, and they make it back to the boats, where the it ends with her claiming that her brother is dead. 

So basically my changes revolved around these points
1) Dogs posing a bigger threat
2) Yara appearing more hesitant to leave Theon/more emotionally conflicted
3) Greater incentive to gtfo of Theon's room/dungeon area
4) More action
5) Greyjoy soldiers actually fighting like Greyjoy soldiers

Ramsey wearing armor would be more believable too, but he was just banging some crazy chick. ",5,0,False,default,,,,,

What. The actual. Fuck.

But seriously, that scene made no sense and I had to actually pause the episode to figure out if I'd missed anything.

You sail all the goddamn way around the continent to save your brother, then it's like, ""Welp, dogs. Guess we're going home."" Even if Theon is dead to her, it seems like she'd at least want to disembowel the guy that did it.

Jon Snow was in the basement because the Starks didn't think it would be respectful to have a bastard at the banquet. This was when Tyrion pays a visit. I haven't read the books, but considering Tyrion may be in the wall, I thought this was an interesting conversation. I found a transcript of this interaction online:

&gt;TYRION: Your uncles in the Nights Watch.

&gt;JON: Whatre you doing back there?

&gt;TYRION (drinking): Preparing for a night with your family. Ive always wanted to see the Wall.

&gt;JON: Youre Tyrion Lannister. The queens brother?

&gt;TYRION: My greatest accomplishment. You  youre Ned Starks bastard, arent you?

&gt;[JON looks angry and turns away.]

&gt;TYRION: Did I offend you? Sorry. You are the bastard, though.

&gt;JON: Lord Eddard Stark is my father.

&gt;TYRION: And Lady Stark is not your mother. Making you a bastard. Let me give you some advice, bastard. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor. Then it can never be used to hurt you.

&gt;JON: What the hell do you know about being a bastard?

&gt;TYRION: All dwarves are bastards in their fathers eyes.

Ramsay had drowned.  He saw the Drowned God.  What he saw changed him an instant.  Ramsay gets on his knees and begs forgiveness.  ""Please, my Prince Theon, forgive me!""

R Martin is famously known for skillfully weaving his characters in such a manner that they exhibit shades of grey- no one is completely bad or completely good. He's illustrated this throughout the series at several points, especially when characters that the reader thought were beyond hope revealed their redeeming qualities or true nature. The examples of this are numerous and well sprinkled throughout the series. Jaime Lannister, a child murderer and Kingslayer has won the sympathy of most viewers and readers by his loyalty and through the much-talked-about scene where he opened up to Brienne. Cersei, the queen to love to hate, despite being selfish and about cruel, too has a redeeming quality- her love for her children (that and her cheekbones). On the other hand ""good"" characters too have been given their fair share of flaws and vices, from Tyrion's whoring and drinking to Varys's lack of courage and honour and even Catelyn Stark's complete inability to forgive grudges. 

It is perhaps this domninant feature of Martin's writing that makes his characters and plots so real and far from the typical hero vs. villain format. In keeping with this, it seems uncharacteristic that Martin has also created such characters that appear to be wholly and completely ""bad"" and absolutely beyond hope. At this point I'm sure either King Joffery, Ramsay Bolton or the hound's viscous brother Ser Gregor Clegane (aka The Mountain) or all three have jumped to your mind. What these three characters have in common, apart from being absolute monsters, is that at no point have they been shown to have any redeeming qualities or seen to have broken the mould of their ""monstrous"" image in any way. Am I missing something or does this tie into a further subtly of Martin's writing technique? If so, what purpose does it serve? Were there any points at which you thought any of these characters were given more depth/variation.
And if can you think of any other characters that are purely black or white, what do you think their roles are/will be?

Thanks for reading!

TL;DR- Are any GoT/aSoIaF characters purely good or bad or is everyone streaked with shades of grey?

With this in mind, Tywin was my absolute favourite character when it came to starting AGoT. Both Charles Dance's portrayal and his additional scenes across the series (e.g w/Jamie and Arya) made me admire this cold-hearted bastard to no end. He is unflinching when it comes to family and his principles - something which (in spite of all his shortcomings) I really like about him.

(Spoiler tag just in case - seriously don't look at this if you haven't read ALL of it) [ASOS](#b ""So when it came to finishing ASOS and finding out he was just a cruel hypocrite, my opinion of him completely changed. Of course this is what you were supposed to feel but it really came as a shock to me. In my opinion, everything that he was came tumbling down with the revelation of himself and Shae. I knew he was ruthless beforehand but at least he had values. Afterwards, he possessed no quality that I could find redeemable (not even the family stuff any more). I became so annoyed at his many derisions of Tyrion (whorewise) when in the end he was no better than him. I was literally cheering for Tyrion when he approached Tywin with that crossbow. I was disappointed with his demise initally but the more I thought about it, I eventually came to realise that it was actually one of the most satisfying deaths of the series. Not to mention it adds a whole lot to Tyrion's arc (and Cersei's/Jaime's I imagine but I'm only 200 pages into AFFC right now) and I can't wait to read ADWD to see what he's up to."")

First time posting to this subreddit I hope I did the scope thing correctly. Just to be sure this is intended for people who have read through the end of A Storm of Swords and have watched through The Laws of Gods and Men.

If you read ASOS you know that by the current time in the show, in the books Jorah Mormont is no longer with Daenerys since Barristan Selmy told her about Jorah spying on her before she conquered Mereen, but in the show he is still with her since Selmy doesn't know about Jorah's deal with the Iron Throne.

I always wondered how would they manage to reveal his spy status to Daenerys if not by Barristan's word.

Then in last episode ""The Laws of Gods and Men"" just as the small council is talking about her and how she has Mormont and Selmy as advisors Lord Tywin asks Varys if he has way to take word to Essos and as soon as Varys confirms he asks for parchment and quill.

I think he is totally going to tell on Jorah. What do you think?",7,2,False,self,,,,,

The idea is that Stannis is the symbol of justice and that is why the bank can be sure that he will repay them. However when I look at the TV Stannis, who I am honestly not very fond of, he strikes me more as a symbol of entitlement and if he gets to be the King he might start dodging them just the same as Tywin because ""I am the King and you did not lend me money, you gave me what belongs to me by right"".

That is at least how the show reads to me. Is it that different in the books?

Why does Iron Bank think Stannis will pay them if there are no money in King's Landing? Its not like Tywin is flipping them off - there are no money to give, so how will Stannis get them, especially if he fuels even more costly battles in the process?",50,14,False,self,,,,,

I've read the books and I am all caught up with the show. My question is... where are the smokers? Is their even an equivalent of tobacco/marijuana like substances? Their is never any indications of such (at least from what I can remember). Not a single character is mentioned to be smoking, or seen smoking, this also holds true with any background figures (people seen in taverns, traveling on the road, in the cities ,etc). I have read other high fantasy novels, and from what I can remember, most, if not all have a tobacco/marijuana culture. It is depicted as it is in our real-time society, just an everyday commodity for those who choose to partake. In J.R.R Tolkien's world of Middle-Earth everybody seems to smoke their pipe, most likely packed with the ever popular Long-Bottom Leaf that is cultivated in the Shire. Other high fantasy stories I've read always mention someone smoking, or the smell of ""sickly sweet herbs and weeds"" in the description of an environment, most often upon entering a tavern, or other locations of leisure and comfort. Are smoking products even existent in GRRM's world? I can't recall any type of smoking substance to be even mentioned as a trade item in the books. Correct me if I am wrong, my memory isn't always at its sharpest. So is their a reason for the absence of smoking in GRRM's story? It wouldn't change the story much, just some more background descriptions on characters and locations. So now that we have all thought about this, would anyone like to play around with the idea? What kingdoms would you think would produce the best product? Any differences in blends and tastes throughout the realm? Which part of this world would have the biggest trade? I guess the presence of smoking could change the characters/story a bit, any thoughts on who would be smokers? Thoughts on either tobacco or marijuana like substances?

I've only been watching the show on HBO, and have not read any of the books. But I'm a little confused about the Iron Bank. From what I understand, it's a bank where you can borrow money (as Stanis had done in the latest episode), and the bank's ""owners"" choose to lend out money only to those who they believe would turn them a profit. That was why they were not originally convinced about lending Stanis money, since Stanis cannot in any way conquer King's Landing from the Lannisters and their superior fighting forces. This is also why they keep lending to the Lannisters, I'm assuming; basically, lend to the most powerful because you can profit from his successes.

My question:

Maybe I don't know enough about the Iron Bank (or economics/finance :P) in general...but, why can't Tywin Lannister, for example, who is so powerful and commands huge armies, simply take control of the Iron Bank himself? In fact, why can't *anyone*, with a strong enough force, do this, and thus secure all of the finances that the Iron Bank controls??",12,7,False,self,,,,,

I notice there is no character for her on the IMDB, and they person they used back at the beginning of the show was just an extra.  They seem to be bounding ahead with the Theon/Reek/Ramsay storyline, he's already sleeping with the hounds, etc.  And by the books timeline Tywin was supposed to have sent her to the Boltons already.  
Brienne was still in town when Jeyne was leaving in the books, and she's now off on her Sansa mission.  It looks like Ramsay is about to bathe Reek and send him to play Theon at the Moat.   
     
Do you think they're going to do it or just drop it altogether?  Will they do something else instead?  I guess they could just bring in any faux-Arya sent by Tywin (or even Cersei) at the last minute, to at least have the marriage, but I'm really curious why there seems to be no sign of Jeyne yet.  It just seems important to the story in so many ways, I don't see how they can cut it without changing quite a bit.

Given that we've got a few more episodes to go this season, I can't imagine them not checking back with Brienne and Podrick at least once more. Also, in the previews she mentions that she bit a man's ear off and spit it in his face- something she hasn't yet done this season.

I'm thinking that the writers will show the scene at the Crossroads Inn from AFFC, where Brienne is involved in a small skirmish that Gendry assists her with. Gendry's story is pretty much done there, so I'm curious if the writers are going clean-slate with his character.

I think it would be awesome to have a Brienne + Gendry + Podrick team. What's more, how cool would it be if Gendry is there with Brienne if the writers decide to do the much-anticipated/hypothsized Lady Stoneheart at the end of the season?

Obviously Tywin doesn't like him much for this reason but I feel like he still has an inkling of love (or hope or whatever) for Tyrion simply because of the family.

So far, to my knowledge, we have seen the following magic:

- Melisandre giving birth to the shadow demon-baby.

- Beric Dondarrion casting Flame Weapon and then getting revived by his friend (for the sixth time).

- The teleporting guy in Qarth. I think he was called a warlock.

- And of course, Bran's warging abilities. Not sure if this falls into the same category of ""magic"" as the rest.

I've also read up a little on the subject and found that there have also been pyromancers, like Rossart under the Mad King. My questions are:

- How many kinds of magic are there? Where do they come from? Obviously Beric and Melisandre's magic both came from the Lord of Light, but what about the pyromancers and the warlock of Qarth? Is all magic given by the gods or are there other ways to tap into it?

- Does the magic in this series ever get, for lack of a better term, more wizardly? I'm not expecting Harry Potter or anything, but is there ever a battle between two pyromancers where they throw fireballs or anything like that?

- How come more people don't make use of magic? My immediate thought goes to Stannis. He follows the Lord of Light just like Beric and we've seen the Lord of Light both resurrect Beric multiple times AND set his weapon on fire, which is totally badass. If Stannis follows the same God, how come he never uses this power? Since he seems to be the underdog right now, you'd think he'd be all ears for anything that would help his cause, especially flaming weapons and virtually invincible troops through resurrection. Is magic frowned upon or looked at as dishonorable?

Thank you for your answers.",72,26,False,self,,,,,

I get the most likely answer is that he didn't want his friend to die with such a bad memory but it would have made everything he was planning a million times easier. I mean he was planning on disgracing the children anyway. 

Then he goes and has pycelle kill him immediately after being named king regent (in a fucking letter written in his handwriting) but doesn't bother to tell anyone. Even without telling them about the incest, Robert could have told barristan and pycelle and the rest of the council to make sure Ned sits the throne before Joffrey. 

Also if he paid off the kings guard himself and reassured they were on his side, instead of letting littlefinger betray him. I would have loved to see Cersei's face.

In 3.10 Brandon and his buddies are stuck in an abandoned fort and meet up with Samwell Tarly by coincidence. Before that, Brandon tells his team about a guy transformed into a rat:

&gt;It wasn't for the murder that the Gods cursed the Rat Cook, or for serving the King's son in a pie. He killed a guest beneath his roof. That's something the Gods can't forgive.

Soon after that, the scene cuts to Walder Frey. It's immediately obvious how similar the Rat Cook's crimes are to those of Frey. I interpreted the scene as telling us that Walder Frey would meet a particularly gruesome end.

This got me thinking: how are characters usually punished in the series? Bad things happen to ""good"" people (I use that term lightly) and evil people routinely escape consequences. My theory is that they are (in some specific cases) punished according to the Gods' morality system and not the usual idea of justice. The Rat Cook commits murder but the Gods don't lift a finger. He breaks a sacred rule and gets in deep trouble.

* Ned Stark attempts a coup, thereby breaking the rule of loyalty to the crown
* Catelyn Stark betrayed her son by freeing the Kingslayer (disloyalty to kin)
* Robb Stark and his wife broke the vow to Frey
* Renly Baratheon opposed his brother who was the rightful King, or at least more rightful than he was (disloyalty to kin)
* Theon commits the worst betrayal and is punished the most severely
* Joffrey is arguably killed because he was an obstacle to the red god, although Olenna does mention that she wanted him dead because of his psycho ways, so it's not clear cut what the cause of his death was

The deadliest flaw to the theory is the Kingslayer but I still think the idea holds some promise. What do you guys think?",7,6,False,default,,,,,

I'm also confused about the laws or definition of lords, wardens and highborn. From my understanding highborn is when one is born from a Lord or lady. Lords are the rulers of their perspective castle/land? And warden oversees their section of westeros. But in the event that there are no more heirs to become Lord of a castle / land who gets to become the new Lord? Also how would someone not highborn become a Lord, is it through money and status?

I've recently been re-watching the first season of GoT because, well, I haven't seen it in a while and I had a couple questions for either show watchers or book readers (I am a show watcher who is trying to find the free time to read the books):

In episode 8 of season 1, Robb and the Starks' bannermen are marching south on King's Landing, and Tywin's forces are marching north to meet them. Jaime currently holds siege at Riverrun. Robb and Theon are discussing their strategy with the bannermen, and mention that they must cross the Twins in order to do it, which obviously sets up Robb's oath to Walder Frey and all the shenanigans that follow because of it. 

However, using the [map of Westeros and Essos](http://www.sermountaingoat.co.uk/map/versions/speculative_map.jpg) that I constantly refer to, the Kingsroad goes around the Trident and the Twins anyway, which would get them south without relying on the Freys. So why does Robb have to make this oath to Walder Frey to move his troops south? Is it as simple as the map being wrong and the Kingsroad does indeed cross at the Twins? (admittedly it does say ""speculative"" map) Or is there some other geographical or strategic barrier that forces them to go that way? It almost looks *more* difficult to travel that way.

1. Any scene with Sam Tarly and Gilly.  What's the point?  Can we just stick to scenes of Sam developing into a hero support type character, finding the dragonglass and killing white walkers.  That whole scene with him taking Gilly to safety was too drawn out and painful.  We get it, he's compassionate.  I hope Gilly never comes back.

2. Daario.  Ok we get it, he's a playa type who gets Daenerys all hot.  I'm glad they changed the actor for him though, because the one from season 3 looked like a stereotypical frat boy rapist.  He's not an interesting character at all, and he's had a good number of scenes.  Actually I'm not a fan of Daenerys in general, things just happen to work out too well for her despite her general bumbling (ok minus the dead Drogo and baby thing).

3. The whole Bran/Jogen/Hodor/Meera quest.  I'm sure it's all building up to something earth shattering, but it's just boring.  Are we even told what the point of the quest is?  To find the 3-eyed raven, and then...what exactly?


Most Enjoyable:

1. Any scene with Tyrion.  Ok I'm sure the show upsold Tyrion's character, but any scene he's in, he absolutely steals the show.  He's probably the most relatable character - struggling in a world stacked against him, trying to win approval, but still getting stomped all over despite his accomplishments.

2. Any scene with Tywin.  The actor does a great job of portraying the imposing dad that you are scared of, but desperately want to please.  Hell even Arya got Stockholm Syndrome and was happy to please him and impress him with her smarts.  Him casually pushing around Mace Tyrell, telling him to fetch a quill LOL.

3. Catelynn Stark.  I know a lot of people hate her because of her unfair treatment of Jon Snow and her stupid decision to release Jaime Lannister.  However, she's probably the strongest female character (or maybe Olena Tyrell).  She plays the mother wolf, protects her children, acts as ambassador for her son, supporting Robb even though she wants to go back to Winterfell to care for Bran and Rickon, etc.  How many other female characters do this in the world of Westoros?

People are claiming that he and Myranda (his paramore) must have been having very violent and bloody sex. However, that is simply not the cause of the blood. The blood is composed of splatters from fighting, not cuts. When we see Ramsay and Myranda having sex neither are covered in blood. Granted they are rough and are both known to be violent people, but there is no blood. Now, seeing as the last time Ramsay is on screen before he shows up to the fight all bloody is this sex scene it could be confusing as to where it came from. But, there are off-screen clues as to where the blood comes from. When Yara and her men are trying to extricate Reek the bells start going off and you can here shouting and fighting in the distance. Granted, this is all hard to hear over the dogs barking and the dialogue, but it's clearly there. Soon after this Ramsay enters with his men and is covered in blood. This off-screen fighting is where it came from. His stiletto is already bloody, as are the swords of his men. Furthermore, after the fight with Yara's men he is covered in even more blood, some on his neck and face. There is a close up of this when he is unlocking the dog cages and the blood is clearly splatters, not cuts. Finally, the bath scene with he and Reek takes place the next days and Ramsay has no cuts on his chest or neck, which are both visible and were covered in blood the night before. Sorry, I recognize this is all just a technicality, but it's irked me. If they wanted to make a point of Ramsay having bloody sex they would have shoehorned it into that already useless and unnecessary sex scene. And while it is odd to have him that bloody without actually showing it happen, it is just blood from battle. Yara is covered in it at the end of the fight. Hell, Jorah was drenched in blood after taking Yunkai with Grey Worm and Daario and no one wondered whether or not he stopped to have violent knife-play sex with a prostitute before he came back to Dany.

Remind you, I'm a show watcher and am caught up to the most recent episode, so if what you might answer has spoilers, please denote such. 

--------------------------

Ok, last season, just before the Red Wedding, we saw that Rob Stark had the brilliant plan to take Casterly Rock while the Lannisters were in King's Landing. 

Now, I'm a bit of a military strategist enthusiast, so I was wondering if the book went into detail about how he planned on doing that? Did he have any kind of strategy or battle plan for such an endeavour? I know it's a mute point now, but still, I sometimes like to travel the road not taken.

So I was asking myself this for quite some time... If I would be the executive producer of the show, how will I introduce Lady Stoneheart?
I think there are two options which fit well enough:

* 1ST: We will see the snow-castle scene with Sansa and Littlefinger and Petry will push Lysa through the moondoor. The camera then follows Lysa falling all the way down and just before we hit the ground we cut to the face of Lady Stoneheart opening her eyes. Just like they did with Bran and Lady (the wolf being killed in Season 1).. the same type of a transition. [YouTube](http://youtu.be/xYeyv-Eo730?t=3m56s)  

* 2ND: We will have a dialogue between Sansa and Littlefinger and they're talking about what Petry just did to Aunt Lysa. He then explains some sheming and stuff until Sansa says something like ""My mother is dead. Why do you keep talking about her? Blabalbla"". This will be Episode 10 I guess. After they finish their dialogue we have a transition to the scene where Lady Stoneheart will be revealed. This is just a transition where Sansa is talking about her dead Mother and in the next scene we see that she's really dead but still alive. (Also will be final scene of the season)

Now its your time to play producer. How would you introduce her? ",39,13,False,self,,,,,

I should mention that I'm a book reader, so maybe I'm a little swayed, but I couldn't help but remember a line from the literature, which I believe to be from AFFC: ""You're not Tywin's heir, Tyrion is.""

IIRC, it's uttered by Olena Redwyne (for show viewers, Ms. Doting-Grandmother-Who-Will-Protect-Her-Granddaughter-Via-Regicide) to Jaime, but that could be completely off base. I bring it up because I think Tywin is experiencing more than one emotion on the stand:

I think he's feeling pride.

Tywin is famous as a man who is never outwitted, so it's the blackest of humor for his own disowned and despised son to manage just that. And though Tywin never laughs (and his self-control is established to be rigid enough that he could probably prevent himself from doing so anyway), I think he has a very keen sense of the irony of the situation. To him, this is the cruel joke that is Tyrion's existence being turned back on himself. And he's angry - oh yes, wrathful and tempestuous - but somewhere, deep down, hidden from the courtroom and from Tyrion and from everyone but the omniscient audience, he's having that fatherly thought: ""That's my son.""

I mean, goddamn, Mr. Dance, that was some .50 caliber, master craftsman, precision milled acting work right there.",134,219,False,self,,,,,

Last episode finished off with Tyrion requesting a trial by combat, which is a request that (I hope) will be honored. Cersei will choose The Mountain as her champion, basically to guarantee that Tyrion is going to die. Oberyn Martell will see his opportunity and volunteer as Tyrion's champion to get the duel he's wanted for so long. Only possible problem I forsee is Oberyn not being allowed to fight for Tyrion since he's a judge. Since the idea behind trial by combat is the gods back whichever party is correct/innocent, I'm hoping that it'll allow Oberyn to volunteer.

(Or, alternatively, just scroll to the tl;dr at the bottom.)**

Okay, so brief story here about my partial history as a fan to explain where I am coming from:

My sister got me into this show, and we powered through the first 2.3 seasons while season three was starting; starting with S3E4, I watched all of the episodes live, and the only spoiler I had for things after that was that there was something called a ""Red Wedding"" that would happen by the end of the season. Didn't know what it was going to be, but I had a strong feeling that Joffrey was gonna die at his own wedding due to the Tyrells and/or the common people rioting, so I figured it was that.

S3E9 starts, the ""Previously On"" segment focuses on the Tully/Frey marriage, I realize what's gonna go down, the actual scene is even worse than my imagination, and I'm depressed. Catelyn was and still is my favorite character and I get really emotional about things in general, so watching her die in the way that she died really, *really* messes me up, I don't get much sleep that night, etc. So far still a largely typical Red Wedding reaction other than not being surprised by it due to spoilers (thank God.) The next day, I'm still pretty upset about what I watched -- exacerbated by sleep deprivation -- and I want to just.. reflect on Catelyn, I guess. It's sad that I'll never see her again, I'm going to really miss her, and I just want some kind of closure, so I Google her name. The Wiki of Ice and Fire page is the first result, I click it because I figure ""Well she's dead now so I can't get any spoilers,"" and I'm just curious about what kinds of things she may have done in the books that didn't make it to TV.

And then I find out that she becomes a magical zombie who gurgles instead of speaks, calls herself ""Stoneheart,"" and kills people who had nothing to do with her death.

And I know we all love this twist, but put yourself in my perspective for a second. Finding out absolutely *everything* about that twist, less than ten hours after first witnessing the Red Wedding, is... really, really jarring:

* In the books, the reveal is much more gradual and paced than what I got by suddenly seeing it all on a Wiki page. It isn't ""BERIC RESURRECTED CATELYN AND NOW SHE CALLS HERSELF STONEHEART AND KILLS EVERYONE"" -- it's like ""What the fuck, Catelyn's BACK?"" and then over time you find out more about who she has become and how she has become that person. For me, it was all at once.

* In the books and in the show, the reveal comes pretty far after the Red Wedding, so you have time to reflect on the Red Wedding, accept the finality of it, form your conclusions about it, and *then* get hit with the Lady Stoneheart twist. I did not have this opportunity; I found it out specifically *because* I was still in immediate post-Red Wedding mode and trying to get closure on that storyline. So because of the immediacy of it, it honestly felt like a stupid retconning of Catelyn's storyline to me. It was basically the non-reader equivalent of if the Epilogue had come right after the Catelyn/Arya chapters -- my thought process was baically ""Wait a second, she *just* died and now she's already about to come back? Well.. what the fuck was the point of all of that, then?"" Which of course isn't a valid way to think about it and isn't how you're supposed to think about it, because there's supposed to be a huge gap in time between Catelyn's death and the reveal of Catelyn's return... but for me, there wasn't that gap, it was just ""she died"" ""lol she's alive"" directly back to back from one another. **This, I think, is the absolute biggest reason why I have not been able to fully appreciate this twist; I discovered it while still recovering from and reflecting upon the Red Wedding, so it felt more like a giant asterisk on the emotional storyline I had just witnessed than it did an actual plot development.**

* And of course, it's also *what* I was finding out that bugged me; Catelyn's ultimate fate is very gruesome, and seeing that a character I really respect turns into a crazy murderer isn't really an enjoyable thing. All things that I could more easily appreciate as further tragic developments in her storyline if I had discovered them more gradually.

(It also didn't help that that Wiki page, which has since been edited, was worded pretty idiotically at the time that I read it. The Lady Stoneheart section opened with the sentence ""It seems death has changed Catelyn"" -- like, *no shit it did she fucking died of course that changes someone?!?!???*)

So because of when and how I discovered this development, I have not been able to fully appreciate it. I am much less opposed to it *now* than I was a year ago when I first read about it, but... I can't pretend that the twist is something I care for. It has still been soured in my mind by the way I found it out... but I recognize that is totally unfair, because my opinions are being colored by how I discovered the storyline rather than the storyline itself. Obviously, we are probably getting pretty close to this reveal in the show; assuming that Stoneheart is the final shot of the season, this is probably what more people will be talking about after the finale airs than anything else. **I want to try and love this twist by then, so that I can enjoy and take part in conversations with people who are discovering it as it airs.** So, that is why I am posting this thread. I have a few simple questions for anyone likes the Lady Stoneheart development, particularly those who read the books and discovered it the way they were supposed to, unlike I did:

**1. Most importantly, *why* do you like this development? It is obviously a big ""holy shit what just happened"" moment to close a book or a season, but *beyond that* -- on a deeper level, after the initial shock has faded -- what do you enjoy about the Lady Stoneheart twist?** The main thing that has helped me become less opposed to it is that I absolutely *love* what it does to Brienne's arc. Assuming that [Book Speculation](#g ""the word Brienne yelled was 'sword' and she's going to sacrifice herself for Jaime in a fight,"") that is such a horrible, tragic ending for Brienne that I can't not love it. It's such a gut-punch, and in that sense I appreciate the twist: I love what it does to Brienne and Jaime as characters... but the resurrection *itself* and what it does to Catelyn are things I'm still not fully on board with, so **why do you like Catelyn turning into Stoneheart *in and of itself,* even aside from how it affects *other* characters?** (I know that these are leading questions that assume people reading this enjoy the twist, but.. well, that's because I'm looking for such people, because I'm trying to become a fan of this twist like many others are.)

**2. In a similar vein to the last question, how can I reconcile my love for Catelyn with an appreciation for this twist? How can I appreciate it as an extension of Catelyn's story arc, rather than solely hating what it does to her?** I'm not going to get into a ""Catelyn is a flawless human being and the best fictional character of all time!"" vs ""Catelyn is a vile idiot who was horrible to Jon Snow and deserved worse than she got!"" conversation here; that's for another thread. Already taking it as a given that I *am* a huge fan of Catelyn and find her to be an incredibly admirable character... how can I support a twist in which she becomes a far less admirable murderer of innocents? How can I enjoy that transformation as a part of the plot while still disliking what she becomes and what she does? (Or, alternatively, can I adopt an ""eye for an eye"" mentality and view her actions as in any way defensible?) One way that I can handle it is by viewing ""Catelyn Tully/Stark"" and ""Catelyn Stoneheart"" as entirely different characters, satisfying my cognitive dissonance to a degree that I'm happy with... but then, of course, that waters down the impact of the twist. (Or does it not? Can I still appreciate the transformation of Stark into Stoneheart while viewing them as separate characters?)

**3. Especially if you are a fellow fan of Catelyn - but even if you're not - what was your immediate reaction to seeing her in the epilogue?** I want to know what kinds of thoughts I should be expecting and hoping for my unspoiled friends to have when they see Lady Stoneheart for the first time, and what kinds of reactions I should be trying to facilitate in them. I'm especially asking Catelyn fans this particular question because the one unspoiled friend I have whose reaction I'm most invested in is also a huge Catelyn fan, I think that this twist is pretty much brutal towards Catelyn, so to other people who love her as much as I do: was your initial reaction ""holy fuck, it's so depressing that she turned into that""; ""holy fuck, it's awesome that she's back""; both; or neither? Of course, I also have many unspoiled friends who don't care a huge amount about her, so **even if you aren't particularly pro-Catelyn, what exactly was your immediate emotional reaction to this twist the very first time you read it in the books?** 

**TL;DR - As a huge Catelyn fan, got spoiled on the LSH twist very shortly after first experiencing the Red Wedding. It was abrupt, jarring, and left a sour taste in my mouth that I really want to get over before it airs on television and all my unspoiled friends see it so that I can fully enjoy and appreciate their reactions. I am not a huge fan of Stoneheart now, but I want to be when it airs, and I know just about everyone else *is* a fan of it, so via the questions above, I'm basically just asking people to help me enjoy this development more than I do.**

J is for Joffrey, who murdered Sean Bean

K is for Karl who was a fooking Legend

L is for Lysa, with a push from her husband

M is for Mirri who turned into ashes

N is for Nights Watch, bunch of treacherous asses

O is for Oberyn, while fighting for justice

Q is for Qhorin, who forfeit the fight

R is for Renly, who questioned a birthright

S is for Shae, because hands of gold are cold

T is for Twyin, who shat too much gold

U is for Unsullied, who the Harpy struck down

V is for Viserys who got himself a crown

W is for White Walker, who met Sam the Slayer

Also, I forgot, where is Bran's little brother again? I realise this is something I can look up relatively easily, but it hasn't been the first time I accidentally read spoilers reading wiki pages and I thought this subreddit would help me avoid that.

2/ In Episode 6 of Season 4, Varys mentions that Ser Jorah Mormont was his spy on Daenerys but has shifted allegiance. When did this shift in allegiance happen?

If a nude scene is unnecessary then it is deemed pointless titillation, or as a distraction during slower paced episodes. Whenever a key scene features nudity then the nudity is criticised for getting in the way of an important moment. 

I never really analysed this much when watching, so a lot of the criticism seems over the top to me. It assumes that the moment a naked women is on T.V. the attention of every male in the audience is immediately drawn to it, ignoring all possible plot points and character development. I hope I am not just speeking for myself but I think that this is a wrong, and kind of a mean assumption. 

I feel that the nudity is doing  a good job adding to the general atmosphere of the world without being overwhelming. Many of the characters are rouges, scoundrels and womanisers, so surely a visual representation of this is the most effective way for these character traits to be delivered to a TV audience. Especially in more minor characters such as Salladhor Saan who do not get a lot of screen time, but are still entertaining to watch.

Nudity has also been an effective way to show the characteristics of the women as well, Margaerys nude scene with Renly did a great job of showing how controlling and ambitious Margaery is. She is going to be queen one day and will use all of her (and her brothers) powers of seduction and manipulation to accomplish these goals. In a TV show as compact as game of thrones being able to get as much impact and value out of each scene as possible is important, and sometimes the shock factor of seeing a main character nude is a good way of doing this.

Do you think that the use of nudity in the show is a benefit or a detriment?",16,2,False,self,,,,,

In season 3 episode 5 when Theon Greyjoy escapes and is about to get raped... why does the torturer Ramsay Snow kill the guards? which are seemingly his father's own men...? why in game of thrones do they sometimes make murder a huge deal that requires a trial sometimes but other times people can just murder and its no big deal...

I mean he is a pretty bad ass warrior right, and was holding his own versus the Kingslayer, often regarded as the best fighter in the lands until he got stabbed in the back of the leg by that other cunt. He might have some more trouble with the Mountain but its still better than appealing to Joffrey for mercy.

I guess the first hurdle would be his injury, and I'm not sure if they would wait for him to recover more, but there would still be plenty of champions he could enlist from the north/riverlands/reach to fight in his stead or in a trial of the seven. It also seems like they were gonna keep him in the dungeon until he confessed so he could just wait until he had recovered more, and then demand his trial by combat.

I mean, the public spectacle of such a trial would bring a lot more attention to the claim that Joffrey is a bastard, it would be something everyone would talk about regardless of how it ended and help Stannis rally more support. It could have also given him time to actually get word to Robb to support Stannis' claim regardless of what happened to him. Now if he won his trial by combat/the seven, wouldn't that prove his claim that Joffrey was a bastard since the gods favored him to win, and put a lot more pressure on him to step down, then if he loses the north can still either rebel/fight with stannis.

We have Robert command the death of Dany during one of the small council scenes which results in Ned resigning as Hand of the King.

Shortly after Robert re-instates Ned and decides to withdraw the hit put out on Dany. However as I recall Varys states that ""those birds have already flown"" and that it's too late to cancel the attack.

Sure enough we then see Jorah receive his pardon just before Dany is almost poisoned by the wine seller.

What I don't understand is why Varys actually went through with sending the order for Dany to be killed.

my father is a chainsaw carving artist and is competing in a chainsaw carvers event in denmark in few weeks. The theme for the carvings this year are Rulers/Leaders, fictional and non-fictional. So far we agreed that a GoT Carving would be pretty impressive and interesting to do, as my father is also a passionate ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" fan. 

We have not decided yet who he is going to carve...therefore we ask for your help.

We need a character who can be sculpted in an impressive way/position/cloth... Poeple must see it,  be impressed and also recognize the character.

What do you think who would be a cool character to carve out of wood? Artworks and images with ideas are appreciated.

Edit: To imagine the level of detail possible, here is his latest carving: https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-frc3/t1.0-9/10250118_495898167177230_4106053781809899907_n.jpg

Edit2: Alright guys, thank you all for the interesting ideas, the competition starts on 29th May (http://www.kulturhusetblokhus.dk/showms.asp?menuID=[6798,6849]&amp;z=). If its going to be GoT sculpture (mostlikely) iam going to do a live coverage with daily updates on the sculpture if you are interested.",17,28,False,self,,,,,

In S1E02 (""The Kingsroad""), there was an interesting dialogue between Cersei and Catelyn as Catelyn watched over Bran after his fall:

**Cersei:** I lost my first boy. A little black-haired beauty. He was a fighter, too. Tried to beat the fever that took him. Forgive me. It's the last thing you need to hear right now. 

**Catelyn:** [Shakes her head] I never knew. 

**Cersei:** It was years ago. Robert was crazed, beat his hands bloody on the wall, all the things men do to show you how much they care. The boy looked just like him. Such a little thing. A bird without feathers. They came to take his body away, and Robert held me. I screamed, and I battled, but he held me. That little bundle. They took him away, and I never saw him again. Never have visited the crypt, never. [Long moment of silence.] I pray to the mother every morning and night that she return your child to you. 

Was Cersei lying to Catelyn about this? She seemed tearful and really genuine when talking to her (we know how calculating she is now but not at that point). Was there really a little black-haired prince, and did he die, as Cersei claims? According to her, she never saw him again after he was taken away from her. What if there's an actual, legitimate Baratheon heir out there who deserves the throne? Or was this the show's way of letting the audience see how far Cersei is willing to take her manipulation?",22,27,False,self,,,,,

I'm confused as why they would change that, I think it is a cool design and it seems like it would be easier to do than the other way. Did the producers just think it didn't look as good?

I specifically thought that the ruby Meli wore around her neck was the source of her glamour. So tonight's scene with Meli and Selyse (which I haven't even finished watching - I paused mid-scene to make this post) was rather remarkable.

Selyse walks in on Melisandre's bath, and Melisandre is clearly not wearing her usual ruby (and is clearly not wearing any other rubies in any other reasonable place). The scene, from a casual viewer's perspective, would look like an excuse to flaunt Meli's body a bit, and to play up the fact that Selyse knows and accepts what Meli and Stannis have been up to.

I'm wondering if Selyse sees and knows and accepts Meli as she really is - sans glamour, possibly a crone. That might make ""MeliStandre"" easier for her to accept, and would demonstrate the (creeptastic) depth of her faith - to love and follow Melisandre EVEN THOUGH she knows about, and sees through, the glamour.",40,60,False,self,,,,,

He is an incredibe actor, and in my opinion one of the best the show has, the range of emotion he conveys with just a look is jusr terrific. But I also think Jorah is the most whitewashed character in GoT no question. Everything he does in the tv show makes perfect sense, everything he says is the voice of reason (he even gives better advice than Barristan for example which is weird to me), he is a badass fighter, he is loyal, he is handsome and now he is even a good sport about another man f** Daenerys....  C'mon. I've never hated book Jorah, and I contrary to many don't find him that creepy but the man in the books is a VERY flawed character and that's what make him interesting.

If couture comes with conquering, then I need to rethink my career choices. I noticed a few other things tonight as well, so I decided to make a post. Maybe somebody can freak out with me. 


[The gown itself is stunning.](http://i.imgur.com/Qu7TiyF.jpg) I'm assuming it's custom made by the costume department because of the fit and symbolism within it. To begin, it's blue, just as the rest of Dany's wardrobe. Her wardrobe is blue because of the Dothraki and Drogo. You might recall his tribal paint. Also, blue and orange are visually pleasing (since she's in a desert and pyramids most of the time it contrasts her settings) and easier to film. It's a great color for Emilia and it speaks more to our compassionate side than her house colors. Red and black are harsh and it's easier to sympathize with someone in blue. I, for one, am excited for her character to develop into those colors - if, of course, it happens. I'm greedy for some Targaryen costumes. 

Anyway, back on topic,  the dress is itself is jarring.  The materials, structure, and colors of the dress are all juxtaposed. It represents the conflict in Dany to be strong or gentle. The skirt of the gown is pleated chiffon (I think, don't quote me). It's very light blue and very airy. The ""cups"" of the dress are the same color, maybe even the same material, but it's been distressed to look like dragon scales. The navy straps are made out of thick material and seem to be wrapping itself around her. Plus, dem shoulders. It's also ultra sexy, but she's wearing soft waves in her hair, reminiscent to [the pilot](http://i.imgur.com/m8lvUWu.jpg) and first few episodes.  Dany is torn and they've done a damn great job showing it. 

It can be argued that the design of the straps channel a Westerosi influence, even a northern one. I'm not completely sure if I buy it though; you can be the judge (aka help me make up my mind). Compare the way the straps cross over her torso from her shoulders like a cloak. We've seen this before, on many characters. [Catelyn](http://www.imgur.com/tJXVW.png) [Roose Bolton](http://i.imgur.com/tfu40Qr.png) [Robb](http://i.imgur.com/fFktyhJ.jpg). They're also on King Bobby Baratheon, Ned, and Sansa. Even Thorne. 

Check out these [two](http://i.imgur.com/V4soRzr.jpg). They're almost identical. White shirts, scarves, dark bottoms. 

Next, we have [the hound](http://i.imgur.com/P3KQjRu.png). In his touching scene with Arya, he's dropped his armor. He's only wearing pants and a shirt. The shirt is loose and flowing, but it's dark. It's also  the same color as [Ned's undershirt](http://i.imgur.com/9fF6owQ.jpg). I don't think it's a coincidence. They could have put him in burgundy, purple, brown, black, but they put him in green. 

I would also like to point out [Oberyn's necklace](http://i.imgur.com/SHsl2Bd.jpg). It's heavily inspired by these [Spring 2014 designer pieces](http://imgur.com/a/XZQlB). They've done this before with Dany's Qarth dresses and her jewelry. Just wanted point out how they manage to bring real life aspects into the show in subtle ways. It also helps keep them relevant in the industry and catch attention.

I am essentially going to copy and paste a comment I made in another thread.

In the most recent episode, when Daario strips down for Dany, the audience gets two seconds of his bare ass and then we cut to Melisandre, naked in a bathtub. Honestly, I'm a hetero man and I was hoping that they'd cut to a shot of Daario, full frontal nude. We've had 4+ seasons of gorgeous naked woman for both the characters and the audience to enjoy. But when we get our first scene devoted to a woman getting to enjoy the sight of a naked man, the show should've had the courage to actually do so. Bear in mind, this is an instance of a woman unquestionably in the power position. This is not Talisa and Robb, who were both equals. In this episode, the very point is that Dany has the power. Yet, in that moment, the show, itself, denies Dany power by withholding the sexualized male body part. Hell, Dany even looked at his crotch. An eyeline match was in order and would've served the hetero female audience in the same way the show has over and over again served the hetero male audience. I love the show and I love the depiction of women, but the lopsidedness in this regard regularly disappoints me.

This disparity cheapens the show's use of nudity as a whole. For the many naked women now, who one might want to think help ground us in a world where sexual activity is real and frequent, really just make for soft-core porn. (Please, counter me if you think you can.) If it were not simply HBO and GoT inserting soft-core porn, we would see penises. For every set of tits there, likely, would be a dick. Yet we are yet to see one other than Hodor's or maybe the slightest second of Theon's (oh...poor Reek). Hell, if you want to not show penises because the show wants us to be able to identify with male characters a lot that would be focusing on the females, I can buy that. But when the time comes when a woman is in that position, the same ought to be true. Unfortunately, it's not.

Moreover, we should've seen Theon's apparently huge cock before it got chopped off and we should also have seen his cock-less crotch. For a show that clearly wants to claim itself as gritty and able to thrust upon its viewers the realities of war and politics and consequences of decisions, it has a line it will not cross: penises. I think it would have been in line with the show to introduce us to Theon's ""favorite toy"" before removing it. We certainly didn't have to actually see the castration happening. Perhaps that would be a line of gore justifiably avoided. But the non-violence of a before and after would have mutedly been enough. Unfortunately, for all of its brilliance and devotion to great characters, the show still either suffers because the showrunners or HBO or both won't go all the way.

EDIT: People have pointed out that we do see Theon's cock in season 1. I should've recalled that more. I'm copying and pasting a comment of mine about this: ""You're right. I think the show could've gotten away with highlighting it just a little though, especially since they knew it's eventual fate. It's such a quick glimpse and isn't even the focus of the shot. Maybe they could've made it more central so later on his castration is resonates even harder (since I think the show could've also gotten away with a shot of his crotch post-Ramsey-is-the-fucking-worst).""

EDIT 2: For people wondering why or others care, this comment is it: ""DANY, YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO TAKE YOUR CLOTHES OFF TOO"" 
http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/25wk3z/season_4_spoilers_premiere_discussion_407/chlf1bj

The show totally undermines the moment of an important female character because it can't get itself to show a dick. So instead of taking her entirely seriously as a powerful character, we are still left with that little (or small) part of us that just wants to fuck her. I really wish the show would work on this. Seriously, you can view it as some gender issue (and it is) but you can also just view it as a storytelling issue. As a story, this writing is prioritizing certain characters over others. Hell, why is Dany, who they knew would be more significant overall than Robb Stark, not getting as much agency in the bedroom as he did?",112,58,False,self,,,,,

a.) Have access to the same computer the account signs in with
b.) Know the password creator in real life
c.) Have an easy to guess password
it is damn near impossible to find out somebodies password, you have to hack the website not just the account, 
if it were easy to hack somebodies password, then big youtube channels, twitters and facebook pages would be getting hacked left and right and nobody would be safe. Think about it before you comment.

Everything should be restored now.  The Reddit Admins have been involved, and it's my understanding that the problem accounts are banned. 

EDIT:  Yes, this was a bad trolling event.  Please keep in mind that we ban spoiler trolls nearly every day.  Some days there are more than half a dozen banned, and there are many different ways they try to cause problems.  Almost all of the trolls are handled in ways that make it look like this is a relatively troll-free sub, but unfortunately it's not.  Yes, of course I am sorry the sub was affected by trolling severe enough that it was impossible to miss.  But this was the first such incident in over four years, and what we do 24/7 has been working very well to block spoiler trolls.  This was an isolated event and not a breakdown of the system.

He needed to be absolutely inhuman. This is a person who purposefully defies all that is moral just for the sake of amusement. He needed to be more than a bodybuilder in the offseason. This person is supposed to be absolutely savage, but he looks like they just oiled him up and threw a couple squirts of blood on him.

Please Read.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/25xds4/show_spoilers_and_how_to_avoid_them_please_read/,mathewl832,1400487371,"After the recent thing and hearing for so long how people get spoiled for the show, I thought I'd make a post to help people avoid them. Obviously for most it makes for a much better viewing experience. 

* **Game of Thrones Wiki** - Do NOT confuse this with the ASOIAF wiki, they are two different things. This is a show only wiki which updates per episode so only go on if you are caught up to the show. 

* **ASOIAF wiki** - The bread and butter for a book reader, AVOID this at all costs as it provides lots and lots of info from the books and future stuff not yet seen in the show. 

* **Twitter** - I know this is probably hard to completely filter out. I don't use Twitter myself but there have been several celebrities who have tweeted spoilers before in the past, so avoid using it if you can. 

* **Youtube** - Generally a safe place, but if you watch a GOT video, whether you were linked to it from Reddit or elsewhere, DO NOT scroll down. YT comments are a minefield for spoilers and are actually thumbed up, increasing their visibility. Something like Turn the Lights off could help obscure comments, or just avoid GOT related videos completely. 

* **IMDB** - Generally safe for episode and title pages, but DO NOT scroll down to the GOT boards at the bottom of the page. Very frequently people will post spoilers in the titles like 'When will blah blah die in the show' etc. and even in the comments, spoilers are rife. Avoid at all costs. 

* **/r/asoiaf** - Generally safe, spoilers are banned from post titles but you cannot count on this 100%. In particular the wording might hint at someone still being alive or someone who has died. Mostly book discussion and most posts are scoped at [Spoilers All], so show watchers should stay away from the sub as much as possible. 

* **Google search** - This one is a biggie. So often new show watchers will look up names of characters they don't know or just want to read up on their favourite characters. Do NOT google search names of characters. Auto-complete is a bitch and very often you get words which can be spoilers, for example typing in Ned Stark, something might pop up like: [Season 1 Episode 9](#s ""Ned Stark death"").

* **Reddit** - In general, GOT are sparse outside the GOT related subreddits, yet the curse of such a popular show is that stuff will pop up now and again. There's now real way to filter out these, it can happen with usernames, spoilers posted in popular threads, anything. Tread carefully is the only thing I can say. 

* **News sites** - In general you should be safe, look out for those sites specifically covering TV related news. Some can put pretty blatant spoilers in their titles or home pages, which we saw a bit of in the aftermath of [Season 4 Episode 2](#s ""Joffrey's Wedding"".) Avoid those types of news sites until after you have watched the most recent episode.

* **/r/gameofthrones** - In general this sub is excellent in its spoiler control. Familiarise yourself with the spoiler scope. Many times I see show watchers in [Spoilers all] threads which could contain any amount of unmarked spoilers. If you see a spoiler for something that you haven't read or seen, RESIST THE URGE. Also, as /u/ZsaFreigh pointed out, avoid the new queue of this sub after an episode is out if you have not seen it. Very often people will forget the thumbnail rule and post image spoilers, in particularly after the Purple Wedding. 

*Facebook - In particular GOT related pages, spoilers can be quite unexpected and unmarked, so stay away from those kinds of pages. The official GOT page will also have lots of spoilery comments and being unmoderated, best to stay away. 

If there are any other places, sites etc. that should be covered, let me know in the comments. If you have read this **please upvote for visibility**, self posts get no karma.

Oberyn Nymeros Martell, Prince of Dorne, is the younger brother to Doran Martell.  Doran was invited by Tyrion to serve on the small council but Oberyn was sent in his stead because of Doran's bad health.  Oberyn seeks justice for his sisters murder after Robert's Rebellion.  Gregor Clegane killed the royal family along with Oberyn's sister Elia.  He also blames Tywin and the Lanisters because they most likely gave the order.  Although it should be noted that Tywin never told the mountain to kill Elia, only the Targaryns.  

Oberyn earned the nickname of 'Red Viper' at the age of 16 when he was in a duel with Lord Yronwood.  The duel took place because Oberyn had slept with the Lord's paramour.  The duel was only to first blood.  Both were cut and the matter was settled but days later the lords wounds were infected and he died.  It was rumored that he fought with a poison sword.  Friends and enemies then gave him the nickname.

Oberyn is a well travelled and experienced character, having even forged six links of a maester's chain before getting bored.  He travelled the free cities and even fought with the second sons for a time.  He is known as a skilled warrior but he was unhorsed in a tournament at Storm's End by Rhaegar Targaryn.  He also matched against Willas Tyrell and defeated him, seriously injuring the heir to Highgarden.  (Not sure if Willas is mentioned in the TV series but he is older brother to Ser Loras.

Note: I have not finished reading ASOS yet so please no spoilers if possible.  Also feel free to correct me if I have left anything out.

Edit: Lord Yronwood's paramour not daughter",189,249,False,self,,,,,

* Robin (Robert) Arryn: for a child actor, his initial conversation with Sansa seemed very natural to me. The outburst was a tad over the top, but one could argue that it fits his character from the book. Overall I like his acting in the few scenes he's had this season.

* Brienne: Her subtle smirk when she said to Pod, ""Uhm... you were saying?"" had me laugh really hard. And even though his back was turned, when you pause, you can actually see Daniel Portman grinning widely in reaction.

* Lysa Arryn: Holy crap. She worked herself into such a rage that her voice turned shriek-y when she held Sansa over the edge of the moon door. Very believable, great job. The only thing that took me out of the scene a tiny bit was the obvious use of green screen when she was pushed down the moon door.

* Tyrion: Needs no further comment, Peter Dinklage is on a roll. He's shining through the downfall of his character. I loved the moment he shared with Jaime chuckling about the idea, ""what if you championed me and died? Dad would be so pissed.""

* Hot Pie: This doesn't belong into the ""outstanding acting"" category I think, but I liked how the nice and warm way he talked to Brienne and Pod about Arya was so different from the first moment he was on screen - intimidating Arya and generally being a fat little shit that the audience wouldn't have minded seeing stabbed in the belly.

* Bronn: That goodbye handshake :(

So what exactly was her reasoning behind this? Did she simply think that he wouldn't dare?

2. She had sex with Petyr, hoping her father Hoster Tully would then approve of her marrying Petyr since Catelyn was already bethrothed to Brandon Stark.  Instead, her father forces her to get an abortion when she was pregnant with Petyr's baby.

3. Catelyn then marries Eddard Stark.  Lysa marries...Jon Arryn, a super old guy in order to secure their alliances.

4. She has multiple miscarriages, and finally has a son who is developmentally challenged, Robin.

5. She does whatever Petyr tells her to do in order to try to make him happy and win his love, including murdering her own husband.

6. She sees Petyr kiss her own niece.

7. The last thing Petyr says to her, is that she only ever loved Catelyn.

(Small Thanks to the Wiki of Ice and Fire with some of the smaller details) 

---------------------------

**- Note on Spoiler Scope**

As always spoilers for these articles include everything up to and including the most recent episode, as well as the book material, in this case ASOS, that reaches to where we are in the show.  And as with most of these writeups it will consist of largely lore material.  But as I mentioned I will cover some material that was in the books that was not in the show, including a bit of speculation in an un included plot point.  But as none of that will appear in the show, this post is of course non-reader safe.. Enjoy.

-----------------------------

**Sic Parvis Magna**
-----------------------




**- Littlefinger goes to Riverrun**

Before we can get into the relationship with Baelish and the Tully girls we need a bit of background on House Baelish and why he found his way to being a ward of Lord Hoster Tully.  For that we must travel back in time roughly 40 years to the last of the Blackfyre Rebellions when the kingdom was caught up in the minor war known as The War of the Ninepenny Kings.  It was during this conflict during the reign of King Jaehaerys II that the then younger Lord Hoster Tully became acquainted and befrended the father of Petyr Baelish.  It was after this that Lord Hoster agreed to take on Petyr as a ward at Riverrun to be raised among his own children, and so a young thin boy travelled well above his station and went to live with the Lord Paramount of Riverrun and his daugters.  


**- Greatness from Small Beginnings**

House Baelish is as small as a nobel house can get, with a very small holding on a rocky bit of land in a region known as The Fingers House Baelish was at the time very insignificant and barely considered highborn.  The House had no history, only being founded very recently by a Bravosi sellsword turned hedge knight three-generations before Petyr Baelish was born.  This sellsword however distinguished himself enough while in service to Lord Corbray of the Vale, that he was given that small plot of land and allowed to establish his own house.  

It is these humble beginnings and reputation that Petyr was stigmatized with when he went to Riverrun, and for which he earned his nickname Littlefinger for the land of which he came.  Petyr however proved himself very ambitious in the following several years, and would overcome his low birth, but he would also find himself in love with one of the daughters of his adopted home..

------------------------------
  
**The Baelish-Tully Affair**
-----------------------------



**-Petyr and Catelyn**

Littlefinger found himself in a comfortable position in the service of Lord Tully. But it was here that Petyr also began to fall in love with the eldest of Lord Hoster Tully's daughters Catelyn.  Baelish's love for Cat was not reciprocated however and was only ever treated as a brother to Catelyn.  Catelyn's sister Lysa however had fallen in love with Petyr, and we'll get back to this in a second.  After Catelyn Tully was betrothed to the eldest son of Lord Rickard Stark of Winterfell, Brandon Stark; in a fit of unwise jealousy Petyr challenged Brandon Stark to a duel for her hand.  Brandon accepted the challenge and nearly killed Petyr in their fight, it was the intervention of Catelyn that saved Petyr's life with Stark only leaving him with a large scar.  It was due to this that Lord Hoster Tully sent Baelish away and back to his own holdings after Petyr had healed.  However it was not the last communication Petyr had with Catelyn, shortly after their duel, Brandon Stark was killed by the Mad King Aerys II Targaryen, and the war of the Usurper had begun.  Petyr had sent her a letter, but as now being betrothed to Brandon's younger brother Eddard, Catelyn burned the letter without reading it, and would not have any contact with Petyr for over a decade. However Petyr remained in constant contact with other of Lord Hoster's daughters...


**- Petyr and Lysa (and a draught of Moon-Tea)**

This next section will discuss a large plot point not covered in the show (an likely will not be). Most of this was speculation until recently confirmed in the World of Ice and Fire mobile app..   

As I mentioned, while Littlefinger pined away for Catelyn Tully, her sister Lysa had loved Petyr, knowing full well of his feelings for her elder sister.  But unlike the unreturned love Petyr had from Cat, Petyr did not necessarily give the cold shoulder to Lysa.  Not too long before his duel with Brandon, Petyr was visited in the night by Lysa, and the couple slept together, however Littlefinger mistook Lysa for Catelyn and called her by that name on that night. This is likely the cause that in later years that Littlefinger bragged about bedding both the Tully sisters while serving in the Court at Kings Landing.

 It would not be the last time Petyr and Lysa shared a bed as she bedded him again while nursing him back to health after his duel with Brandon.  After Petyr was back to full health and sent back to his home, Lysa became pregnant, and with hopes that this would make her father allow her to marry Petyr; so she told her father.  However this was not the case and Lysa was forced to drink moon tea and abort the child.  Lysa was then betrothed and wed to Lord Jon Arryn of the Vale in effort to sure up alliances for the Rebellion led by Robert Baratheon that had just begun.  

Catelyn, nor anyone else never knew of what transpired between Petyr, Lysa, and Hoster,  however during the events of A Clash of Kings Catelyn Stark returned to Riverrun to look after her ailing father (This is during the time after she treated with Renly and taken Brienne into her service, but before setting Jaime Lannister free, who is being kept in the Riverrun dungeons in the books).  In her father's delirium he keeps referring to an unknown Tansy and something involving Lysa of which he regrets, not knowing of the full story behind the forced abortion. (Tansy is an ingredient of Moon Tea).  

-------------------------

**The Rise of Lord Baelish, and the fall of Lysa Arryn**
----------------------



**- Death of a Hand**

After being sent back home to the Fingers, Petyr did not resolve himself to a heartbroken mess.  With the help of Lysa after she had wed Lord Arryn, Petyr was given the job of controlling customs in Gulltown.  Petyr proved very capable at his job and increased his own personal wealth tremendously, and gained reputation and power in doing so.  The success at this job was noted by Lord Arryn and after Robert's Rebellion had finished and Jon Arryn was named as Hand of the King under King Robert Baratheon I, Petyr was offered the title of Master of Coin and appointed to the small council, a position that allowed him to not only control the finances of the realm, but develop many allies and influence in the realm over the next 18 years (13 years in the books).  

During this time that Petyr retained a close relationship with House Arryn and Lysa.  But things were about to get very compicated.  Lysa still loved Petyr, though it is unknown if anything happened between them in those years with Jon Arryn being so close by.  Lysa had trouble getting pregnant with her husband as well, likely as a result of having to abort a previous pregnancy she had several miscarriages before finally being able to give Jon Arryn an heir in the form of Robin (or Robert in the books) Arryn, who was a sickly and weak child who nursed well past an acceptable age.   Robin's dependency on his mother was noted in the court to where both King Robert, and Jon Arryn agreed it was appropriate to foster the child away from his mother at Casterly Rock.  Lysa did not want this to happen so she found help in the form of Petyr Baelish.  Petyr helped her by convincing her to poison her husband's wine, and telling her this would help them be together, fulfilling her long time wishes, but unbeknownst to her also setting into motion his own aspirations and goals, as he also convinced Lysa to send a letter to her sister Catelyn blaming the Lannisters on Jon Arryn's death.  This all happened to plan and was the first domino to be knocked over that set the events of the series into motion, as non readers learned in the episode two weeks ago.....

**- Baelish the Puppet Master**

And so it all came to pass, the events of the series unfolded out as you all know, Petyr Baelish seemingly behind it all.  His goals of bring strife between House Stark and Lannister succeeded and resulted in the death of Ned Stark, freeing up the woman he really loved the most.  He was awarded a lordship in the form of Harrenhall, as well as being Lord Paramount of the Riverlands following the Red Wedding, and under instruction from the small council he wed Lysa Arryn and seemingly brought the Eyrie, who had remained neutral during the War of the Five Kings into the fold of the realm under the now King Tommen I Baratheon.  All the while manipulating the other side in an alliance with House Tyrell, that ultimately resulted in a plot to poison King Joffrey Baratheon, and frame it on his uncle, and as was suggested by the most recent episode was also in response for the death of Catelyn Stark at the Red Wedding.  (Though this is not exactly the case in the books, as the seeds for Joffrey's poisoning were set before the Red Wedding when Ser Dontos gave an unaware Sansa Stark the hairnet (necklace in the show) containing the poison prior to the wedding of Edmure Tully).  With full power as a major Lord of two of the major regions of Westersos Baelish is now one of the most powerful men in the realm...

**- Only Cat** 

Now we finally get to the big moment from last night's episode, the death of Lysa Arryn via a trip through the moon door.  There is not that much to add to what the viewer saw as it almost plays out exactly the same way in the books as it did in the episode.  Baelish's infatuation and assistance with Sansa Stark over the last couple of seasons, and up until their kiss in last night's episode  has been for the most part accurately portrayed in the show.  Baelish seems to be passing his affections for Catelyn onto her daughter who is noted for looking very similar to her mother.  And when Lysa in a fit of rage comes close to murdering Sansa, hysterically pleading with Petyr that her sister never loved him and confessing the crimes she has committed to be with him his response in the show is as it was in the books he had only every loved one woman... Only Cat...

 Though there are a couple of  book to show differences that can be noted with this scene, as good as it was.  The First of which is that the reveal of the Littlefinger/Lysa poisoning of Jon Arryn was revealed in the same moon door sequence in the books, whereas the show divided those into two different scenes for the show.  The second and largest difference is that there is a witness to the  murder of Lysa in the books; a singer named Marillion.  This is the singer who accompanied Catelyn to the Vale to bring charges to Tyrion Lanniser, in the show the singer returns to King's Landing to have his tongue removed by Joffrey (that was a different singer altogether in the books), but in the novels he remains at the Vale and becomes a favorite singer of Lysa Arryn.  When Littlefinger returns to the Vale with Sansa Stark, under the guise of his bastard daughter (niece in the show) Alayne Stone, Marillion is very flirtatious and makes several sexual advances to Sansa which she spurns.  When the moon door scene ultimately happens Marillion is a witness to the crime, but finds himself as a part of another frame job as he is blamed for the murder when those also at the Vale flock into the room just after Lysa's fall.  Marillion it seems has been cut from the show, and it will remain to be seen how Baelish plans to pass off Lysa's fall.  

Littlefinger has done quite a bit in the pursuit of his goals, and the viewers as well as book readers are still curious at to what his long term goals and aspirations are going forward, we can only wait and see what might be in store for the person who is arguably the most dangerous player in the game...

It's crazy to think that after all of the horrible things he has done throughout the show somehow don't matter anymore. Maybe it's just me, but I have grown a lot of trust in his character, mainly because I am a huge fan of Tyrion.. but still. It's hard for me to believe that all of the ""bad"" Jaime Lannister is gone. Just a thought that I wanted to voice with the rest of you! 

EDIT: Also, In some ways I think that the entrance of Brienne into his life changed him too.. Is it that crazy to think that Jaime might be in love with her? Love is always powerful enough to change someone.. Guess we'll have to find out. ",13,0,False,default,,,,,

Welcome to the scene-by-scene episode followup for non-readers! If you ever had any questions, this is the moment when they get answered - you'll also recall some neat things that you've probably missed. If you don't have any questions, don't worry, I've got answers anyway.

The spoiler scope should not exceed the point of the story in the books. That is, right now, various books - some excerpts are from ASOS, some are already AFFC, and some are even walking into ADWD material. Anyway, *you should be fine*. I'm trying.

**TL;DR: Trivia from books - Expansion and Explanation - Reader perspective - Rants about minor differences - Rants about MAJOR differences - Lame jokes - Actual jokes** (no guarantees on the last one)

---

###Ghosts of Champions Past, Present and Future

&gt; *If you want justice, you've come to the wrong place* - Tyrion Lannister, on the border between total despair and TOTAL AWESOMENESS

* Ser Gregor Clegane got his nickname ""The Mountain that Rides"" from his monstrous height. Books describe him as almost 8 feet tall (in modern units, 240 cm). We've seen him in season 1 during the tourney of the Hand, but due to undisclosed reasons the actor has been recasted. Twice. First time for a brief appereance in Harrenhal, in conversation with Tywin, and now for the real deal. New actor, Hafr Jlus Bjrnsson, is ""only"" 205 cm (6'8'') tall, but it's still quite impressive.

* The Mountain's collossal size takes a toll on his health. He is under the constant influence of painkillers (milk of the poppy) to ease his headaches. Needless to say, him being resistant to pain is the cherry on top.

* To recall Mountain's story so far: he appears first at the tourney, kills ser Hugh of the Vale (Jon Arryn's squire) and loses to ser Loras Tyrell; then in his rage slaughters his horse and tries to kill ser Loras. After that, he's seen pillaging the Riverlands - in response, Ned Stark as the Hand of the King sends lord Beric Dondarrion and his men to bring him to king's justice. In the face of king Robert's death and their inability to defeat the Mountain in open battle (The Mountain kills lord Beric *twice*), the Lighting Lord's party forms Brotherhood without Banners, still loyal to Robert Baratheon's cause and opposing the Stark-Lannister conflict. The Mountain, scared away from Robb's trap by Edmure Tully, leaves the burning Riverlands behind him and comes to King's Landing.

* Jaime's relation with Tyrion doesn't require additional backstory other than reminder of Tyrion's first marriage to the whore Tysha (the story was told in S01E09 IIRC). As Tyrion already told Shae, when he was sixteen he and Jaime met a girl and saved her from attempted rape. Tyrion fell in love with her and bribed a drunk septon to marry them. after two weeks, when the septon sobered up and tolf Tywin, Jaime revealed the ploy: Tysha was merely a whore, and the whole scene was staged to get Tyrion laid. Tywin had Tyrion watch his guards rape Tysha one by one, filling her hands with pieces of silver for the service.

* Lady Stokeworth already tried to marry her mentally challenged daughter Lollys to many noblemen, including Tyrion himself. The fact that Lollys was raped during the riots in King's Landing (season 2) and got pregnant didn't help the cause. Lollys's experience is a mirror for Sansa, who realizes what she's been saved from.

* Oberyn Martell is nicknamed ""The Red Viper"" from a duel in which he allegedly poisoned his weapon. He's a renowned knight (in one tourney, he crippled Loras's older brother, who got written off from the show) and an educated man (he even forged few links in his maester chain). (further in-parenthesis explanation; links in maester chain represent mastery over sciences such as medicine, economy and logistics).

* Oberyn's mother (also Doran's and Elia's) was friends with Tyrion's mother, Joanna Lannister. They planned to arrange a marriage between Oberyn and Cersei, as well as Elia and Jaime. The Martells still wanted to go through with the plan after Joanna died, but Tywin turned them down.

* The next episode is called ""The Mountain and the Viper"" and it kinda spoiled the names of the champions for many people. Sorry about that one.

###By Fire Be Purged

&gt; *Nothing is just nothing* - Arya on nihilism

* Someone asked ""Why are they taking so much time, Yara Greyjoy has sailed around the whole continent"" and it's a completely valid question, that Yara scene was kinda bullshit and totally not-in-the-books (although it served its purpose). Anyway, Arya and the Hound are travelling through the warzone, carefully avoiding any troops, especially Lannister men, and their destination is somewhat inaccessible (Bloody Gate is just one chokepoint, the whole area is mountainous).

* If you paid attention no further explanation is required, but in case you've missed the ""previously on"": Rorge and Biter were the two people locked down in cage with Jaqen H'gar when Arya was travelling north to the Wall. Arya saved those three from the fire, gaining threee death wishes from Jaqen to make even things out with the Red God.

* We've already heard the Hound's story *three times* now, so yeah.

###Caged Wolf

&gt; ""Come on, Ghost"" - Jon, halting the spendings on CGI for the time being

* Alliser Thorne is a dick to Jon, but for a good reason. He was just a simply guy in King's Landing during Robert's Rebellion and he got sent to Wall because Robert and Ned won. He never did anything wrong, he simply fought for the wrong side. No wonder he despises the son of a man without who caused him to spend the rest of his life on the Wall.

* This whole plotline is stretched beyond belief, so no further context from books.

###Lord Friendzone

&gt; *He killed the captains and gave you their heads* - Jorah Mormont, mixing up Benjen and Euron

* Explaining the joke: Benjen Stark and Euron Greyjoy are two characters jokingly suspected to be Daario. That is most likely not the case - it's an inside joke made by readers. And you're not even supposed to meet Euron yet. Or... are you? Anyway, any time you see ""Benjen is Daario"", know it's an inside joke meant to mock conspiracy theories. The more the fun when a somewhat serious website dedicates a whole article to the theory, taking it serious.

* Daario Naharis being recasted has some pros and cons - new Daario is closer to how the book Daario looks like (sans the blue facial hair), but the old Daario had that ""bad boy"" look better, and we have enough Men with Beards, I suppose.

* Whenever in doubt, blame it on book Dany's age. Book Daenerys is 15 and is somewhat expected to make poor choices and fall in love with a bad boy.

* Another reminder: Ned Stark was about to execute Jorah for selling people into slavery. Why would Jorah do that in the first place? Well, in his youth he won a tournament and asked for his crush's hand in marriage. Girl was way out of his league in more ways than just her appereance - she was permanently unhappy with dull and poor lifestyle on the Bear Island, so Jorah did what he could to support her needs. He was so broke and desperate that he sold poachers he caught into slavery. When he heard that Ned Stark has found out and is coming to execute him, he fled Westeros, leaving his family sword Longclaw. In case you haven't connected the dots, his father was Lord Commander of the Night's Watch Jeor Mormont, and Longclaw is currently in Jon Snow's possession.

###...boobs?

&gt; *Humour isn't my strength* - Selyse Baratheon, a perfect match for Stannis

* Stannis is actually full of witty dry one-liners that are humorous to the reader, but he certainly doesn't intend to joke. *""Robert could piss in a cup and men would call it wine, but I offer them cold clear water and they squint in suspicion and mutter to each other about how queer it tastes.""*

* I tend to write a huge apologetic piece of ""have you accepted your one true king into your life"" every week, but there's a limit to everything. Enjoy some boobs.

###HOT PIE

&gt; *In his chainmail shirt with a sword in his hand, Gendry looked almost a man grown, and dangerous. Hot Pie looked like Hot Pie*  
A Storm of Swords

* Now that's fanservice to readers, plain and straight. Hot Pie is one of fan favourites bacause of jokes in narrative, but after his farewell with Arya, we never see him again. This might be the last time we see him or it might be not - scenes like this one are a great example of show-only story dynamic, so someone might go by the inn as well.

* Can't say much more without spoiling the rest of Brienne's and Podrick's journey, but it seems like some parts of related storyline might be sped up and some postponed, to group plotlines by theme in respective seasons. If we skip a chapter or two or three, we can leap to the end of that story written so far - so this slowly creeps out of the reach of what I can write about. The show might soon surpass the books or just write a new story, and so far, it does a damn good job at it. The timeline gets funky, though.

I'm not complaining by any means, I think it was an amazing episode. Just wondered if maybe they made a point of setting up this episode so it could be filmed quickly and easily while filming other episodes to give cast and crew a break while shooting? I'm sure the filming is arduous at best for most involved and a nice little break to rest and recoup would be helpful.

This lead me to this short paragraph about the mountain;

He has ""massive shoulders and arms thick as the trunk of small trees.""  Gregor weighs over thirty stone, nearly all of it muscle, making him near inhumanly strong. Gregor's strength allows him to wield a six-foot, two-handed greatsword with just one hand, giving him enormous reach while still wielding a shield. Such is the power of Gregor's strength that he has been known to hack men in half with just a single blow. In battle he wears the heaviest, thickest plate armor in the Seven Kingdoms. His armor is so heavy that no ordinary man would be able to move, let alone fight effectively while wearing it, making him nigh-invincible in combat

The quote summed it up nicely at the end 'nigh-invincible'. In the show he is clearly not somebody to trifle with but let's say i would put money on a duel between him and the Hound, i think i'd probably go for the Hound but going by that description i wouldn't have thought even he would stand a chance.

McGovern also played the role of Vladimir in the [2001 film adaptation of *Waiting for Godot*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0276613/) There are some striking similarities between the theme of  this scene in S4E7 and the [the play](http://samuel-beckett.net/Waiting_for_Godot_Part1.html), of which the main characters are Vladimir and Estragon usually shown as hobos or general lower-class individuals.

*Where else to sit?*

*Who were they?*

*I stopped asking a while ago.*

&gt;VLADIMIR:
(*hurt, coldly*). May one inquire where His Highness spent the night?

&gt;ESTRAGON:
In a ditch.

&gt;VLADIMIR:
(*admiringly*). A ditch! Where?

&gt;ESTRAGON:
(*without gesture*). Over there.

""Without gesture."" It doesn't matter where particularly he slept, nor where the dying man sits.

&gt;VLADIMIR:
And they didn't beat you?

&gt;ESTRAGON:
Beat me? Certainly they beat me.

&gt;VLADIMIR:
The same lot as usual?

&gt;ESTRAGON:
The same? I don't know.

&gt;VLADIMIR:
When I think of it . . . all these years . . . but for me . . . where would you be . . . (*Decisively.*) You'd be nothing more than a little heap of bones at the present minute, no doubt about it.

Doesn't matter much who they were. They were all the same.

---

*Bad way to go. Haven't you had enough?*

*Of what?*

*...*

*I know. Time to go. Take matters into me own hands. The thought has occurred to me.*

&gt;ESTRAGON:
Wait! (*He moves away from Vladimir.*) I sometimes wonder if we wouldn't have been better off alone, each one for himself. (*He crosses the stage and sits down on the mound.*) We weren't made for the same road.

&gt;VLADIMIR:
(*without anger*). It's not certain.

&gt;ESTRAGON:
No, nothing is certain.

&gt;*Vladimir slowly crosses the stage and sits down beside Estragon.*

&gt;VLADIMIR:
We can still part, if you think it would be better.

&gt;ESTRAGON:
It's not worthwhile now.
*Silence.*

&gt;VLADIMIR:
No, it's not worthwhile now.
*Silence.*

&gt;ESTRAGON:
Well, shall we go?

&gt;VLADIMIR:
Yes, let's go.
*They do not move.*

Although the dying man knows it would be better to part with the pain of dying and the thought has occurred to him to get off the road of life, still he is indecisive.

*So why go on?*
*Habit.*

&gt;ESTRAGON:
Charming spot. (*He turns, advances to front, halts facing auditorium.*) Inspiring prospects. (*He turns to Vladimir.*) Let's go.

&gt;VLADIMIR:
We can't.

&gt;ESTRAGON:
Why not?

&gt;VLADIMIR:
We're waiting for Godot.

Waiting for something to come which shows no sign of ever arriving. Waiting, going on, for the sake of familiarity. There are many interpretations for what 'Godot' means in the context of the play. In this scene from the show, perhaps Godot is the expectation of death.

---

*Nothing could be worse than this.*

*Maybe nothing is worse than this.*

*Nothing is better or worse than anything. Nothing is just nothing.*

&gt;*A country road. A tree.*

&gt;*Evening.*

&gt;*Estragon, sitting on a low mound, is trying to take off his boot. He pulls at it with both hands, panting.*
 
&gt;*He gives up, exhausted, rests, tries again.*

&gt;*As before.*

&gt;*Enter Vladimir.*

&gt;ESTRAGON:
(*giving up again*). Nothing to be done.

&gt;VLADIMIR:
(*advancing with short, stiff strides, legs wide apart*). I'm beginning to come round to that opinion. All my life I've tried to put it from me, saying Vladimir, be reasonable, you haven't yet tried everything. And I resumed the struggle.

""Nothing to be done"" is the first line of the play. Nothing to be done about what? In the context of the show, perhaps there's nothing to be done about the dying man's situation. Perhaps there's nothing to be done about the fate of the characters or of the world; winter is coming.

&gt;VLADIMIR:
Listen!
*They listen, grotesquely rigid.*

&gt;ESTRAGON:
I hear nothing.

&gt;VLADIMIR:
Hsst! (*They listen. Estragon loses his balance, almost falls. He clutches the arm of Vladimir, who totters. They listen, huddled together.*) Nor I.
*Sighs of relief. They relax and separate.*

&gt;ESTRAGON:
You gave me a fright.

&gt;VLADIMIR:
I thought it was he.

&gt;ESTRAGON:
Who?

&gt;VLADIMIR:
Godot.

&gt;ESTRAGON:
Pah! The wind in the reeds.

A moment of particular attention to nothing.

---

*A fair exchange that is. Always held to the notion of fair exchange in all my dealings. You give me. I give you. Fair. A balance. No balance anymore.*

The play also has the characters Pozzo and Lucky. Pozzo is pompous and overindulgent, while Lucky (ironically named) is much like Pozzo's servant, like a dog made obedient by being emotionally broken by a cruel master.

Before Pozzo and Lucky enter, there seems to be a balance to Vladimir and Estragon. They reciprocate conversation. They try to help one another at certain times. They even work together at one point to find a way to hang themselves so that they might pass the time. They are on equal footing. Then Pozzo and Lucky enter and bring a sense of imbalance into the scene.

&gt;POZZO:
Basket! (*Lucky advances, gives the basket, goes back to his place.*) The fresh air stimulates the jaded appetite. (*He opens the basket, takes out a piece of chicken and a bottle of wine.*) Basket! (*Lucky advances, picks up the basket and goes back to his place.) Further! (Lucky takes a step back.*) He stinks. Happy days!
*He drinks from the bottle, puts it down and begins to eat. Silence. ... Pozzo eats his chicken voraciously, throwing away the bones after having sucked them.*

&gt;ESTRAGON:
Er . . . you've finished with the . . . er . . . you don't need the . . . er . . . bones, Sir?

&gt;VLADIMIR:
(*scandalized*). You couldn't have waited?

&gt;POZZO:
No no, he does well to ask. Do I need the bones? (*He turns them over with the end of his whip.*) No, personally I do not need them any more. (*Estragon takes a step towards the bones.*) But . . . (*Estragon stops short*) . . . but in theory the bones go to the carrier. He is therefore the one to ask. (*Estragon turns towards Lucky, hesitates.*) Go on, go on, don't be afraid, ask him, he'll tell you.
*Estragon goes towards Lucky, stops before him.*

&gt;ESTRAGON:
Mister . . . excuse me, Mister . . .

&gt;POZZO:
You're being spoken to, pig! Reply! (*To Estragon.*) Try him again.

&gt;ESTRAGON:
Excuse me, Mister, the bones, you won't be wanting the bones?
*Lucky looks long at Estragon.*

&gt;POZZO:
(*in raptures*). Mister! (*Lucky bows his head.*) Reply! Do you want them or don't you? (*Silence of Lucky. To Estragon.*) They're yours. (*Estragon makes a dart at the bones, picks them up and begins to gnaw them.*)",1,10,False,self,,,,,

""Mockingbird"" clearly displayed how misguided Daenerys's rule is. I'm seriously convinced that she is no better than other cruel kings and queens, if not worse. In the previous episode, Hizdahr zo Loraq came to her and claimed that his father was innocent of the crimes of all the other masters. It opens up the doubt that may be crucifying all the masters was not justice, but revenge. And it is indeed. Because if she wanted justice, then she would have given them a trial. Without trial and conviction you cannot certainly get to justice. Her way of ""eye-for-an-eye"" dealing with her subjects is extremely dangerous. Not only it opens up possible gruesome mistakes, but also makes the ruler egotistic and arrogant. And it's also eminent, because she didn't learn a damn thing from that experience. She ordered Daario to kill all the remaining masters of Yunkai'i. This kind of binary 'justice' is surely going to be the doom for her. Good thing that Jorah stopped her from doing that, and he had to convince her with soft voice and all.

Then Jorah convinces Dany to instead be more just and so Dany decided to send the dude who's father she killed instead of Daario to convince the slave owners that shit will happen to them if they dont change.

Could Tommen (or who's setting the Iron Throne at the time) actually beg for Daeny to save them? I mean, I have generally thought that she would enter Westeros as a potential conquer and enemy of the ruling family. I have been doing my 2nd read and it's got me thinking that maybe Daeny begins to see Essos as ""home"" since a home is something that she has always desired. She may never get the urge to leave once she finally learns to be a Queen and Westeros is nothing more than an afterthought. While she is Queening-it-up in Essos... Westeros is being destroyed by Winter and the Others. If so, all the people who has no desire now for Daeny to cross the Narrow Sea could be begging for her and her Dragons to save them by TWOW.

When you actually pause the episode and look at the amount of times the light flips on and off, it's kind of amusing.

It covers up through S4E7 but includes book content that was not in the show.)

The climactic end of this episode was much longer, more emotional, and more tense in the books. As I love the book content that we didn't see in the show, and as one user on here asked me what it was like in the books vs the show, I figured I'd post this thread just to give non-readers an idea what this *excellent* scene was like in the books.

The first thing I'll say about the chapter in general is that, other than an epilogue, it is the last chapter in ASOS. Here, it happened near the middle of the season, where it could easily be a filler scene, in ASOS, it was essentially *the end of the book* and came right after some very huge twists, so the reader is constantly on edge waiting to see why GRRM chose this chapter to close the craziest book in the series.

**SNOW CASTLE SCENE**

* Sansa building the castle alone lasted a lot longer and was more powerful in the books (which is to be expected, as it was based largely around GRRM's descriptions and Sansa's internal thoughts, which are not the kinds of things that can be so easily conveyed on television.) She initially thinks that the snow-filled garden is too pure and beautiful for her to deserve to enter it, and she thinks about how it was meant to be a godswood but the soil wasn't right for growing weirwood trees, and thinks to herself, ""A godswood without gods, as empty as me."" She reflects on times when snow fell at Winterfell: she remembers the snow in Robb's hair the last time she saw him, and thinks, ""I thought my song was beginning that day, but it was almost done."" It makes her sad to remember how happy she was on that day when she thought she was being whisked off to the land of her favorite stories. She then remembers a time when she stepped outside and Bran and Arya ambushed her with ~12 snowballs each; Bran had climbed up high where Sansa couldn't reach him, but she could chase Arya. She was about to catch Arya, but then slipped and fell on some ice. In a total ""d'aww"" moment, Arya stopped right away and turned around to make sure Sansa wasn't hurt... and then immediately threw another snowball the second she knew Sansa was okay. Sansa pulled her down onto the ground, rubbed snow in her hair playfully, and Jory (the guy Jaime stabbed in the eye in Ep.5) came out and pulled them apart, laughing. It's a really cute memory and drives home just how *happy* a family the Starks really were, which makes it more powerful when Sansa decides to start recreating Winterfell. A number of servants watch Sansa curiously, but they all get bored or cold and go back inside. Sansa is aware that her entire body is soaking wet with snow, but she doesn't care; all that matters to her is her castle.

* Lord Baelish comes out before Robin. He helps Sansa build the castle for a while and is very sweet to her, showing her how to make bridges and windows, making you think that he might not be so bad... so it's even more shocking when ""Petyr"" becomes ""Littlefinger,"" going in for the kiss as we saw. We are led to believe that Lysa didn't see it. No real difference in the kiss itself other than the ambiguity re: Lysa and the fact that Sansa more clearly resists it; the main difference is in how the kiss is set up. (Additionally, there is no reference to Joff's death or LF wanting to avenge Catelyn.)

* Robin (""Robert"" in the books) comes in, breaking off the awkward moment between Sansa/Petyr, and there's no cordial conversation with Sansa. He doesn't break the castle accidentally by trying to make a Moon Door; he smashes it intentionally and immediately, pretending his favorite stuffed doll is a giant tearing down the walls. Sansa doesn't strike him; instead, she reaches for his hand to try to stop him, and in the process accidentally rips the doll. Robin, who has regular seizures in the books, gets so mad that he collapses onto her castle, wholly destroying it in his fit before being carried off by a maester. Sansa, outraged at the destruction of her castle, smashes the doll's head on a spike. LF laughs and tells her that if stories are to believed, that's not the first giant to end up with its head on the Winterfell gates; Sansa angrily says ""Those are just stories"" and storms away. (The purpose of this quote is, of course, to show that Sansa no longer has any interest in fairy tales and stories like she used to. After her castle has been destroyed, she isn't in the playful mood she was in before.)

**LYSA'S DEATH SCENE**

* Sansa thinks that Lysa is going to confront her about the doll. She resolves to tell Lysa that she *won't* marry Robin (she thinks to herself that she *does* feel sorry for her cousin, but that doesn't mean that she wants to *marry* the sickly, spoiled child.) She thinks that Lysa may banish her to Lord Nestor, another noble in the area; she has heard that his daughter is very playful and close friends with a bastard, meaning that her status as the baseborn ""Alayne"" would not count against her.

* Marillion is a character who isn't in the show. He's Lysa's favorite singer, and in an earlier chapter, he tried to rape Sansa but was stopped by a guard. In this chapter, Sansa thinks about how many female servants didn't have a guard to save them and were banished by Lysa for telling ""lies"" about Marillion. Marillion tells Sansa that Lysa has summoned her, and Sansa comes with him, having summoned up her Stark pride and decided to tell Lysa that she won't marry Robin. As they walk, Marillion hits on her, telling her he'll write a beautiful song about a bastard girl so pretty she bewitched all who saw her. Sansa longs to yell that she is a proud Stark of Winterfell, but instead says nothing.

* The core difference between this scene in the books and the show is that in the books it is longer and the tension rises and rises. The tension begins when Sansa enters the High Hall: Marillion suspiciously tells the guards outside to let nobody in while Alayne is with Lysa, and then he bars the doors behind them, refusing to say why.

* Lysa starts off sitting in the dais above and across the room from Sansa. As in the show, Sansa apologizes for her altercation with Robin, but Lysa says to stop being coy; she's talking about the kiss. As it wasn't apparent that Lysa saw the kiss, this is a bit of a twist; when Lysa mentions it, the atmosphere of the room becomes so much colder that ""the walls and floor might have turned to ice."" (Lysa doesn't use the word ""whore"" here, but says ""wanton"" a couple of times, which basically means the same thing.) Sansa insists that she didn't kiss LF, which causes Lysa to become angrier and stand up from her seat. She starts talking about Catelyn. As Lysa begins to rant about how Catelyn allegedly led Petyr on, she begins to descend from the steps, continuing to become more unhinged as she goes on. It is apparent that Lysa's love is an *obsession*; she remembers exactly how many times Petyr danced with Catelyn on one night that was many years ago, proudly saying that she counted every single one. She then reveals that Petyr took her virginity, but he called her ""Cat"" while falling asleep.

* After Lysa's rant about Catelyn, Sansa, thinking that Lysa is as frightening as Cersei ever was and abandoning all her plans of defiance about the marriage, simply says, ""He's yours, my lady. Do I have your leave to go?"" Lysa says that Sansa does not have her leave to go, and begins to rant about her father and how he forced her to marry Jon even though she was in love with Petyr. (At this point, it becomes clear that Lysa is drunk.) She reveals that Petyr got her pregnant at one point but ""they stole [the baby] from her."" This is explained more later on in the scene.

* Lysa tells Sansa that the reason why she is explaining all this is because she and Petyr have gone through *so* much, wanted each other for *so* long, that she knows Petyr loves her too much to want anyone else, especially such a young girl as Sansa. This isn't just background for the sake of background; it is establishing Lysa's lifelong obsession with Petyr Baelish and making it clear that she believes it has always been reciprocated, making the end of the scene that much more shocking. Sansa's resolve to tell Lysa that she refuses to marry Robin has, quite obviously, completely disappeared; thinking to herself that Lysa is as frightening as Cersei ever was and wanting to get away, she promises Lysa that she'll never kiss Petyr again, thinking that it's what Lysa wants to hear.

* It isn't. Lysa tells Sansa that she's as wanton as her mother, and forcefully grabs her by the wrist, telling her she has something to show her. She calls for Marillion to start playing a song (playing it loudly, to drown out Sansa's eventual screams), and she forcibly drags Sansa to the Moon Door -- in the books, an actual door in the wall rather than in the floor. She forces Sansa to unbar the door, threatening to get the guards otherwise and insulting her as more cowardly than her mother. The door swings open all at once, and Lysa (as in the show) yells at Sansa to look down. She asks Sansa whether Sansa still wants to leave, and Sansa screams. Lysa pushes Sansa over the door so far that one of Sansa's legs is entirely hanging over the edge. **In the books, it is much more apparent that Lysa is not merely trying to scare Sansa; she is about to kill her.** Sansa yanks on Lysa's hair to try and get her to let go. As they are teetering over the edge of the door itself, Petyr arrives.

* As in the show, Lysa does cry and ask LF why he'd ever want to kiss someone so emptyheaded as Sansa, but then goes on. She says that Sansa is just a girl, but that Lysa has suffered her whole life for Petyr, revealing to the readers that **her father forcibly aborted her and Petyr's child,** secretly giving her a ""moon tea"" drink that is used in the books to induce miscarriages. LF walks closer towards Lysa, and tells her that she shouldn't talk so much, because she wouldn't want Alayne or Marillion to find out more than they need to know.

* Lysa ignores Littlefinger, continuing to try and prove herself by recounting all she has done for him. She tells him that neither Catelyn nor Alayne has ever given him anything, but that **she was the one who got him to be appointed Master of Coin,** convincing Jon to give him a post so that he could come to King's Landing and be closer to her. Littlefinger steps even closer and tells her to take his hand (trying to get her to let go of Sansa.) He tells her that there's no cause for all of the tears... and Lysa, in her final reveal, says that **that's not what he said before when he told her to put the tears in Jon's wine and implicate the Lannisters so that they could be together.** (The poison that killed Jon Arryn was known as the tears of Lys.) **As neither Littlefinger nor Lysa is a POV character, we did not know this yet as we did in the show.**

* Littlefinger tells Lysa that she should trust him after all they've endured, and swears to her that he will never, ever leave her side again *for as long as they both shall live.* (tee hee) Lysa finally unhands Sansa, who crawls over to the nearest pillar and wraps her arms around it. She notices that a shoe is missing, having fallen out the Moon Door, and hugs it even tighter.

* The tension begins to ease at this point, as Lysa sobs into Littlefinger's arms and he comforts her. At this point, the reader likely assumes that the chapter is effectively over; that all of this was to reveal the Jon Arryn plot and that the action is done. Littlefinger tells his ""sweet, silly, jealous wife"" that he promises he's only ever loved one woman. Lysa smiles, as in the show (Kate's smile was *perfect*), and asks whether he swears it -- only one? And then, just when it seems the action is over...

&gt; ""Only Cat."" He gave her a short, sharp shove.

&gt; Lysa stumbled backward, her feet slipping on the wet marble. And then she was gone. She never screamed.

Petyr asks Alayne whether she is hurt. When she says she's not, he tells her to quickly run and get the guards, because Marillion has killed his wife.

The chapter, which I *highly* recommend everyone track down and read, is one of the most memorable and beloved in the entire series. It is expertly written from start to finish and there is, clearly, much more content to it than we saw in the show. (Again - I'm not getting, in this OP, into whether that's a good or bad thing... just that it's *a* thing.) The snow castle scene is functionally the same as it was in the show, though more in-depth and much longer simply because of what is allowed by the medium of literature as opposed to TV.

But the Lysa scene, though it plays out similarly and has the same ending, is much different:

1. It is more drawn out and much more tense.

2. Lysa is, quite clearly, trying to *kill* Sansa, not just trying to freak her out.

3. We find out much more about Lysa and there is actually a lot of sympathy to her as a result of it. Of course, she's still crazy and ultimately unlikable... but her life story is *very* tragic if you think about it. I mean, having your baby aborted by your father without even knowing it was going to happen (let alone consenting to it)? That's rough.

4. In the show, it was more clear that *somebody* was probably going out that Moon Door. In the books, though, the tension rises and rises until the Jon Arryn reveal and then begins to fall, possibly leading the reader to believe that nobody will actually die and that that was the real climax. (Keep in mind the magnitude of that Jon Arryn reveal: It explains the catalyst for virtually *the entire plot up to this point.* It closes the door on a storyline that lasted all of the first three books.) Lysa's murder is much more sudden.

5. Lysa's murder, and the taunting ""Only Cat""/""Your sister"" remark, is a *much bigger dick move.* Lysa wasn't just ranting for the sake of ranting; she was ranting so that Sansa would know how much Littlefinger could *only* love her, and then she dies with the knowledge that this man she idolized for decades *fucking murdered her* and *didn't ever care about her.* No wonder she didn't scream; she was too shocked.

6. Yet Lysa's murder makes much more sense: Littlefinger didn't just do it because she threatened Sansa. He did it because she was talking too much. He had a practical reason to do it: She was revealing his secrets and no longer a valuable tool to him.

I feel like I should have one more blurb after the end of that list, but I don't have anything more to add. I guess I'll just say that I hope this gave at least some non-readers some more perspective as to just how huge and climactic that scene was in the books, and I hope that it gave them perspective on just how significant it is for Lysa's character how she died and what she heard before her fall.",0,1,False,default,,,,,

It covers up through S4E7 but includes book content that was not in the show.)

The climactic end of this episode was much longer, more emotional, and more tense in the books. As I love the book content that we didn't see in the show, and as one user on here asked me what it was like in the books vs the show, I figured I'd post this thread just to give non-readers an idea what this *excellent* scene was like in the books.

The first thing I'll say about the chapter in general is that, other than an epilogue, it is the last chapter in ASOS. Here, it happened near the middle of the season, where it could easily be a filler scene, in ASOS, it was essentially *the end of the book* and came right after some very huge twists, so the reader is constantly on edge waiting to see why GRRM chose this chapter to close the craziest book in the series.

**SNOW CASTLE SCENE**

* Sansa building the castle alone lasted a lot longer and was more powerful in the books (which is to be expected, as it was based largely around GRRM's descriptions and Sansa's internal thoughts, which are not the kinds of things that can be so easily conveyed on television.) She initially thinks that the snow-filled garden is too pure and beautiful for her to deserve to enter it, and she thinks about how it was meant to be a godswood but the soil wasn't right for growing weirwood trees, and thinks to herself, ""A godswood without gods, as empty as me."" She reflects on times when snow fell at Winterfell: she remembers the snow in Robb's hair the last time she saw him, and thinks, ""I thought my song was beginning that day, but it was almost done."" It makes her sad to remember how happy she was on that day when she thought she was being whisked off to the land of her favorite stories. She then remembers a time when she stepped outside and Bran and Arya ambushed her with ~12 snowballs each; Bran had climbed up high where Sansa couldn't reach him, but she could chase Arya. She was about to catch Arya, but then slipped and fell on some ice. In a total ""d'aww"" moment, Arya stopped right away and turned around to make sure Sansa wasn't hurt... and then immediately threw another snowball the second she knew Sansa was okay. Sansa pulled her down onto the ground, rubbed snow in her hair playfully, and Jory (the guy Jaime stabbed in the eye in Ep.5) came out and pulled them apart, laughing. It's a really cute memory and drives home just how *happy* a family the Starks really were, which makes it more powerful when Sansa decides to start recreating Winterfell. A number of servants watch Sansa curiously, but they all get bored or cold and go back inside. Sansa is aware that her entire body is soaking wet with snow, but she doesn't care; all that matters to her is her castle.

* Lord Baelish comes out before Robin. He helps Sansa build the castle for a while and is very sweet to her, showing her how to make bridges and windows, making you think that he might not be so bad... so it's even more shocking when ""Petyr"" becomes ""Littlefinger,"" going in for the kiss as we saw. We are led to believe that Lysa didn't see it. No real difference in the kiss itself other than the ambiguity re: Lysa and the fact that Sansa more clearly resists it; the main difference is in how the kiss is set up. (Additionally, there is no reference to Joff's death or LF wanting to avenge Catelyn.)

* Robin (""Robert"" in the books) comes in, breaking off the awkward moment between Sansa/Petyr, and there's no cordial conversation with Sansa. He doesn't break the castle accidentally by trying to make a Moon Door; he smashes it intentionally and immediately, pretending his favorite stuffed doll is a giant tearing down the walls. Sansa doesn't strike him; instead, she reaches for his hand to try to stop him, and in the process accidentally rips the doll. Robin, who has regular seizures in the books, gets so mad that he collapses onto her castle, wholly destroying it in his fit before being carried off by a maester. Sansa, outraged at the destruction of her castle, smashes the doll's head on a spike. LF laughs and tells her that if stories are to believed, that's not the first giant to end up with its head on the Winterfell gates; Sansa angrily says ""Those are just stories"" and storms away. (The purpose of this quote is, of course, to show that Sansa no longer has any interest in fairy tales and stories like she used to. After her castle has been destroyed, she isn't in the playful mood she was in before.)

**LYSA'S DEATH SCENE**

* Sansa thinks that Lysa is going to confront her about the doll. She resolves to tell Lysa that she *won't* marry Robin (she thinks to herself that she *does* feel sorry for her cousin, but that doesn't mean that she wants to *marry* the sickly, spoiled child.) She thinks that Lysa may banish her to Lord Nestor, another noble in the area; she has heard that his daughter is very playful and close friends with a bastard, meaning that her status as the baseborn ""Alayne"" would not count against her.

* Marillion is a character who isn't in the show. He's Lysa's favorite singer, and in an earlier chapter, he tried to rape Sansa but was stopped by a guard. In this chapter, Sansa thinks about how many female servants didn't have a guard to save them and were banished by Lysa for telling ""lies"" about Marillion. Marillion tells Sansa that Lysa has summoned her, and Sansa comes with him, having summoned up her Stark pride and decided to tell Lysa that she won't marry Robin. As they walk, Marillion hits on her, telling her he'll write a beautiful song about a bastard girl so pretty she bewitched all who saw her. Sansa longs to yell that she is a proud Stark of Winterfell, but instead says nothing.

* The core difference between this scene in the books and the show is that in the books it is longer and the tension rises and rises. The tension begins when Sansa enters the High Hall: Marillion suspiciously tells the guards outside to let nobody in while Alayne is with Lysa, and then he bars the doors behind them, refusing to say why.

* Lysa starts off sitting in the dais above and across the room from Sansa. As in the show, Sansa apologizes for her altercation with Robin, but Lysa says to stop being coy; she's talking about the kiss. As it wasn't apparent that Lysa saw the kiss, this is a bit of a twist; when Lysa mentions it, the atmosphere of the room becomes so much colder that ""the walls and floor might have turned to ice."" (Lysa doesn't use the word ""whore"" here, but says ""wanton"" a couple of times, which basically means the same thing.) Sansa insists that she didn't kiss LF, which causes Lysa to become angrier and stand up from her seat. She starts talking about Catelyn. As Lysa begins to rant about how Catelyn allegedly led Petyr on, she begins to descend from the steps, continuing to become more unhinged as she goes on. It is apparent that Lysa's love is an *obsession*; she remembers exactly how many times Petyr danced with Catelyn on one night that was many years ago, proudly saying that she counted every single one. She then reveals that Petyr took her virginity, but he called her ""Cat"" while falling asleep.

* After Lysa's rant about Catelyn, Sansa, thinking that Lysa is as frightening as Cersei ever was and abandoning all her plans of defiance about the marriage, simply says, ""He's yours, my lady. Do I have your leave to go?"" Lysa says that Sansa does not have her leave to go, and begins to rant about her father and how he forced her to marry Jon even though she was in love with Petyr. (At this point, it becomes clear that Lysa is drunk.) She reveals that Petyr got her pregnant at one point but ""they stole [the baby] from her."" This is explained more later on in the scene.

* Lysa tells Sansa that the reason why she is explaining all this is because she and Petyr have gone through *so* much, wanted each other for *so* long, that she knows Petyr loves her too much to want anyone else, especially such a young girl as Sansa. This isn't just background for the sake of background; it is establishing Lysa's lifelong obsession with Petyr Baelish and making it clear that she believes it has always been reciprocated, making the end of the scene that much more shocking. Sansa's resolve to tell Lysa that she refuses to marry Robin has, quite obviously, completely disappeared; thinking to herself that Lysa is as frightening as Cersei ever was and wanting to get away, she promises Lysa that she'll never kiss Petyr again, thinking that it's what Lysa wants to hear.

* It isn't. Lysa tells Sansa that she's as wanton as her mother, and forcefully grabs her by the wrist, telling her she has something to show her. She calls for Marillion to start playing a song (playing it loudly, to drown out Sansa's eventual screams), and she forcibly drags Sansa to the Moon Door -- in the books, an actual door in the wall rather than in the floor. She forces Sansa to unbar the door, threatening to get the guards otherwise and insulting her as more cowardly than her mother. The door swings open all at once, and Lysa (as in the show) yells at Sansa to look down. She asks Sansa whether Sansa still wants to leave, and Sansa screams. Lysa pushes Sansa over the door so far that one of Sansa's legs is entirely hanging over the edge. **In the books, it is much more apparent that Lysa is not merely trying to scare Sansa; she is about to kill her.** Sansa yanks on Lysa's hair to try and get her to let go. As they are teetering over the edge of the door itself, Petyr arrives.

* As in the show, Lysa does cry and ask LF why he'd ever want to kiss someone so emptyheaded as Sansa, but then goes on. She says that Sansa is just a girl, but that Lysa has suffered her whole life for Petyr, revealing to the readers that **her father forcibly aborted her and Petyr's child,** secretly giving her a ""moon tea"" drink that is used in the books to induce miscarriages. LF walks closer towards Lysa, and tells her that she shouldn't talk so much, because she wouldn't want Alayne or Marillion to find out more than they need to know.

* Lysa ignores Littlefinger, continuing to try and prove herself by recounting all she has done for him. She tells him that neither Catelyn nor Alayne has ever given him anything, but that **she was the one who got him to be appointed Master of Coin,** convincing Jon to give him a post so that he could come to King's Landing and be closer to her. Littlefinger steps even closer and tells her to take his hand (trying to get her to let go of Sansa.) He tells her that there's no cause for all of the tears... and Lysa, in her final reveal, says that **that's not what he said before when he told her to put the tears in Jon's wine and implicate the Lannisters so that they could be together.** (The poison that killed Jon Arryn was known as the tears of Lys.) **As neither Littlefinger nor Lysa is a POV character, we did not know this yet as we did in the show.**

* Littlefinger tells Lysa that she should trust him after all they've endured, and swears to her that he will never, ever leave her side again *for as long as they both shall live.* (tee hee) Lysa finally unhands Sansa, who crawls over to the nearest pillar and wraps her arms around it. She notices that a shoe is missing, having fallen out the Moon Door, and hugs it even tighter.

* The tension begins to ease at this point, as Lysa sobs into Littlefinger's arms and he comforts her. At this point, the reader likely assumes that the chapter is effectively over; that all of this was to reveal the Jon Arryn plot and that the action is done. Littlefinger tells his ""sweet, silly, jealous wife"" that he promises he's only ever loved one woman. Lysa smiles, as in the show (Kate's smile was *perfect*), and asks whether he swears it -- only one? And then, just when it seems the action is over...

&gt; ""Only Cat."" He gave her a short, sharp shove.

&gt; Lysa stumbled backward, her feet slipping on the wet marble. And then she was gone. She never screamed.

Petyr asks Alayne whether she is hurt. When she says she's not, he tells her to quickly run and get the guards, because Marillion has killed his wife.

The chapter, which I *highly* recommend everyone track down and read, is one of the most memorable and beloved in the entire series. It is expertly written from start to finish and there is, clearly, much more content to it than we saw in the show. (Again - I'm not getting, in this OP, into whether that's a good or bad thing... just that it's *a* thing.) The snow castle scene is functionally the same as it was in the show, though more in-depth and much longer simply because of what is allowed by the medium of literature as opposed to TV.

But the Lysa scene, though it plays out similarly and has the same ending, is much different:

1. It is more drawn out and much more tense.

2. Lysa is, quite clearly, trying to *kill* Sansa, not just trying to freak her out.

3. We find out much more about Lysa and there is actually a lot of sympathy to her as a result of it. Of course, she's still crazy and ultimately unlikable... but her life story is *very* tragic if you think about it. I mean, having your baby aborted by your father without even knowing it was going to happen (let alone consenting to it)? That's rough.

4. In the show, it was more clear that *somebody* was probably going out that Moon Door. In the books, though, the tension rises and rises until the Jon Arryn reveal and then begins to fall, possibly leading the reader to believe that nobody will actually die and that that was the real climax. (Keep in mind the magnitude of that Jon Arryn reveal: It explains the catalyst for virtually *the entire plot up to this point.* It closes the door on a storyline that lasted all of the first three books.) Lysa's murder is much more sudden.

5. Lysa's murder, and the taunting ""Only Cat""/""Your sister"" remark, is a *much bigger dick move.* Lysa wasn't just ranting for the sake of ranting; she was ranting so that Sansa would know how much Littlefinger could *only* love her, and then she dies with the knowledge that this man she idolized for decades *fucking murdered her* and *didn't ever care about her.* No wonder she didn't scream; she was too shocked.

6. Yet Lysa's murder makes much more sense: Littlefinger didn't just do it because she threatened Sansa. He did it because she was talking too much. He had a practical reason to do it: She was revealing his secrets and no longer a valuable tool to him.

I feel like I should have one more blurb after the end of that list, but I don't have anything more to add. I guess I'll just say that I hope this gave at least some non-readers some more perspective as to just how huge and climactic that scene was in the books, and I hope that it gave them perspective on just how significant it is for Lysa's character how she died and what she heard before her fall.",17,15,False,self,,,,,

They were getting along fine, then Robyn fucks up a bit - accidentally - and Sansa loses her shit and suddenly it devolves into a daytime soap until the next scene. It just looked weird.

EDIT: I explained it a little better:

For Sansa to have been so good at holding it together for so long - even when Tyrion, who, deep down, she knows is a good guy - asked her about Joffrey, she would still robotically insist that he was a great king. She can hold her shit, and Tyrion praised her for it. To not only suddenly start screaming at the child of the woman who already threatened her, but to hit him, because he *accidentally ruined her snow castle* just seemed really poorly written. How could she be completely at Joffrey's mercy at King's Landing and suddenly have the balls to start hitting people when her life is being threatened here too?!",21,0,False,self,,,,,

The most subtly done character and music cue is Littlefinger. By now, the most recognizable--and sinister--musical number is **[Chaos is a Ladder](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vmIRmi7Bf8).** It's slow, meticulous, oddly calming, yet there is *something* that makes the hair stand up on the back of your neck. 

But the most interesting thing is that this motif has been present since the first season. 

The first time we hear it is when **[Cat brings news of Jon Arryn's death to Ned](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOHvRaNrNSY)** in the Godswood.

The second time we hear it is far more subtle, when **[Lysa's letter arrives to Cat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGte6Qf7Exw&amp;t=2m43s)**

The next time the motif pops up again, **[Ned is talking to Littlefinger](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnwAStMnGvg)** in the famous ""Distrusting me was the wisest thing you've done."" line

When we hear the motif again, we hear the very up-tempo version for the **[Ned/Jaime duel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwRix1p9sDY)**, conveniently after Littlefinger says he'll ""bring the city watch.""

When the **[Ned's betrayal comes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8afaQFLSTH4&amp;t=3m55s)**, hints of the motif crops up for the briefest of seconds.

The motif takes a backseat in season 2 and comes back in full force during the chaos is a ladder monologue by season 3 as Littlefinger shows his ruthlessness to Vary. At that point, the theme goes from general Kings Landing machinations theme to Littlefinger's personal anthem. 

By season 4, it has become far less subtle but still generally hidden and kept low.

Littlefinger **[telling Sansa](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxhI0KqNNTw&amp;t=1m18s)** that he engineered Joffrey's death

The revelation of Jon Arryn's true murderer **[was accompanied by... you guessed it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6juG02qtWY&amp;t=34)**

**TL;DR Littlefinger's political machinations have been staring us in the face since the first episode.**",33,202,False,self,,,,,

Well, did you know that the war, and the crown, was won by an outsider, 
Henry Tudor?
Henry was born of welsh, not English decent, he lived most of his young life in exile across the narrow sea (English channel) in France.
When the time was right, he landed in Wales and united an army under a DRAGON banner and marched to England to seize the crown. He charged into battle waving the red dragon. The dragon has mythical history in Wales, from the time of King Arthur(also welsh) and is the basis for the modern Welsh Flag. When crowned king he even used the dragon in his Coat of Arms.
Obviously this doesn't explain slaves and dothrakii but I think there's something here.

I am confused about people's thoughts on women being virgins and attractiveness. Mainly in relation to Dany. 

With Drogo, Viserys told her he'd let him and all his men fuck her etc. This confused me because I thought Viserys planned to eventually marry Dany. 

Her having children would mess up his family lineage right? Or create threats, purely practical, but also I would have assumed he'd find her less appealing if she wasn't a virgin, but maybe I am confusing ASOIAF values with old fashioned earth values :p

With daario, I wondered if Jorah (god, my spellchecker is going crazy with these names lol) would be less attracted to her knowing she'd had sex with him too.

Thoughts?

I'm also wondering what people in westeros would make of Cersei and Dany's lesbian exploration. I've assumed kind of similar to modern times, 'not as big a deal, and kind of hot.' lol",8,4,False,self,,,,,

You are a scout for a major movie firm. Your job is to find the right actor for the right job. The job in question? You need to find a guy roughly between 6'5"" and 7'3"" that isn't an NBA player yet still athletic enough AND muscular enough to look like a god damn mountain. This guy needs to be BIG, and I mean, BIG. Bigger than your average jughead at Planet Fitness who never misses x day. As big as a World's Strongest Man competitor... hey, that's a good idea! 

Now, let's just go to where all those strongmen hang around. This is easy enough, right? Wrong. Now you have to find someone who isn't just a weightlifter, but who also has the following characteristics:

1. A guy who can take the time out of his rigorous training schedule/life to put in days of acting.

2. A guy who CAN act and act well for a massively-popular television show.

3. A guy who can do proper accents and speak decent-fluent English already.

4. A guy willing to do the job, even if he meets all of the above requirements.

I don't think I really need to explain anymore. Don't you all understand how hard it is to cast someone for this role? It's not a walk in the park to find strong men in general, let alone someone fitting all of the specific criteria for this role. To see all these people at every mention of the new Mountain complain about him being ""too bear-like"" or ""too happy-looking"" or ""too young"" need to imagine what a nightmare it is to find someone ABLE and WILLING to fill a role like this.

I'd say the biggest thing that stands out to me as a fan is that yes, this guy is young. He's 25 IRL, 40-something in the books if I understand correctly. How many 40-somethings out there meet the above requirements? And, of the younger men there are to choose from, how many of them look young? There's only so much Hollywood magic that can be done to make a person look older than they are, and we've only seen shots of this person in bright sunlight (which doesn't make it easy for make-up, let me tell you).

I'm incredibly thankful they found someone at all who can convincingly pull it off, let alone a guy who's proven he's actually a really awesome dude and a good actor so far.

Besides, we haven't even seen him in his armor (whatever that armor may consist of) and in true combat (not slaughtering petty criminals outside the city).

So, please contain the amount of comments on how ""un-Mountain"" this new Mountain is. It's just annoying at this point to see the same complaints that don't even begin to take into account all that's been necessary to get this role filled not once, not twice, but THREE different times already.",20,24,False,self,,,,,

Ok, so by far my most anticipated moment of these last few episodes is going to be the Stoneheart reveal (assuming they choose to do it this season, of course that isn't guaranteed). I feel like Stoneheart has the potential to be the biggest plot twist in television history. It may even blow the Red Wedding out of the water, but only if it's done right; this means no foreshadowing. It needs to be as unexpected as possible, and it needs to be introduced without explanation (at least, not right away. Obviously they should explain it in Season 5), because people need time to react and process before they start wondering ""How is that possible?""

So here's what I'm worried about. Let's say Stoneheart is revealed in the last scene of Episode 10 (just for instance, obviously not a guarantee). The ""Previously on Game of Thrones"" bit always shows the relevant plot information for the episode and it manages to consistently take the punch out of some development here or there. What I'm afraid of is that, the ""Previously on..."" at the beginning of Episode 10 will show the Red Wedding again, with a suspicious focus on Catelyn specifically. If they do this, there's a very high likelihood that fans will guess what's going to happen, or at the very least will have Catelyn on their minds when Stoneheart appears. In order for this plot twist to be as visceral and jarring as possible, Catelyn should not be on anybody's minds, at all, at any point during the episode. It'll make the final scene an unforgettable sucker punch.

Of course, they may misinterpret why the Red Wedding is being shown again, (""Oh maybe Walder Frey finally dies in this episode to pay for the Red Wedding""/""Maybe they're going to the Twins again and they're just reminding us what happened there last""/etc.) but they shouldn't risk it. For maximum effect, there should be absolutely zero indication of Stoneheart.

* [10 seconds in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZY43QSx3Fk#t=12): Crows eating bodies and a manned horse closing in to a unmanned horse in what seems to be a place covered in dead bodies. I actually have no idea what this could be but the fog reminds me of the one in the promo near Moat Cailin.
* [26 seconds in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZY43QSx3Fk#t=26): A cloaked man closing in to another guy with armies on both sides. Also seem like the same environment as in last scene, so could be around Moat Cailin. My guess is that one is Reek pretending to be Theon and the other one is the ironborn holding Moat Cailin and Reek ""pretending to be Theon"" begs them to leave or something. Could also be Ramsay meeting his father. It's hard to tell.
* [51 seconds in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZY43QSx3Fk#t=51): Looks like a giant to me. Straight after this we see the same shot of Yara in the boat to the Dreadfort, only brighter for the trailer is my guess.
* [59 seconds in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZY43QSx3Fk#t=59): Arya water dancing on a hill, getting prepared for some kind of an attack. Environment looks near the eyrie, but so did the last place in E07 where she was with the hound, so it actually doesn't tell us that much. After that Littlefinger asks (probably Sansa) ""which side you're on"", probably begging her to lie for him about Lysa's murder.
* [one minute and 8 seconds in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZY43QSx3Fk#t=68) The Mountain Vs the viper! After that Cersei says: ""You'll fight over him like beasts until you tear him apart. I will burn our house to the ground before i let that happen"". Maybe about Tywin trying to control Tommen?
* [one minute and 18 seconds in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZY43QSx3Fk#t=78): Alliser preparing The Night's Watch for a fight and we se Tormund running angrily though snow (But the clip with Jon is from Craster's keep)

Trailer 2:

* [57 seconds in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PkRuoQ7N_0#t=57) Some wooden thing exploding. Also more footage of Mountain vs viper and the same things around the wall and Moat Cailin (if my guess about that earlier is right)

* [one minute and three seconds in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PkRuoQ7N_0#t=63) Ygritte moving aggressively in a burning village at night. Probably Mole's town.

* [one minute and five seconds in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PkRuoQ7N_0#t=65) [**COULD BE A HUGE SPOILER, BEWARE**](#g ""Shae in a fancy dress in a silk bed at night"")

* [one minute and 8 seconds in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PkRuoQ7N_0#t=68) Some random explosion in the snow.

* [one minute and 19 seconds in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PkRuoQ7N_0#t=79) Ygritte looking mighty angry in some wooden house charging with her blade. A few seconds later someone charging someone with a sword with fire around them.

Trailer 3:

* [50 seconds in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PkRuoQ7N_0#t=79) Even more footage of Viper Vs Mountain before. But this attack in the snow hasn't been shown yet i think. The characters doing it are unidentifiable but if it's snow my guess it's near the wall.

* [One minute and 8 seconds in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcnnxzAyGRc#t=65) A better look at Ygritte looking mighty angry.

* [one minute and 20 seconds in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcnnxzAyGRc) Jon killing a wildling with fire around them. Isn't the wildling very similar to Benjen btw?? Definitely not him but very similar in hair and beard. 

Trailer 4:

So I am halfway through ASOS.  Just after the hound met up with the brotherhood without banners a second time.   

I just want to know 2 things, when the nights watch went back to Crasters keep, and all the brothers rebelled against Mormont, his last words where along the lines of, ""Tell Jorah I forgive him and he must take the black"".  Was this left out of the show?  I don't remember that episode.  I feel it adds to Mormonts character after the speech to Jon snow about longclaw.  

Also, in the book, Oberyn's speech about when he met Tyrion as a baby was way earlier than in the show.  **Mind you I have only read half of ASOS,** but in light of whats coming up for Tyrion, I feel that the speech's placement in the show had more weight behind it than when he told him in the books.

That being said, I think it is very out of character for Tyrion to not realize when Jamie tells him the mountain is Cersei's champion that Oberyn might want to champion for him?  His only goal in life (other then fucking anything that moves) is getting revenge on both the mountain and Tywin, and by championing for Tyrion he is killing two birds with one stone.  Even when Oberyn comes to his jail cell and starts talking about justice he still looks at him like, ""what the fuck are you getting at Oberyn.""  Even though Tyrion might believe that Oberyn wants him dead as well, he has to know that the red viper holds far more hatred for Tywin and the Mountain.

As in the show, Gregor Clegane in the books is not on-screen very much at all...but he does get more than in the show (where's he virtually non-existent). When he does get screentime, he's on point.

The first time we hear Gregor speak is in AGOT through Tyrion, when the Lannisters are discussing at their war council what to do after Jaime is captured at Riverrun:

&gt;And your outriders? Ser Gregor Cleganes face might have been hewn from rock. The fire in the hearth gave a somber orange cast to his
skin and put deep shadows in the hollows of his eyes. They saw nothing? They gave you no warning?  
The bloodstained messenger shook his head. Our outriders had been vanishing. Marq Pipers work, we thought. The ones who did come
back had seen nothing.  
A man who sees nothing has no use for his eyes, the Mountain declared. Cut them out and give them to your next outrider. Tell him you
hope that four eyes might see better than two  and if not, the man after him will have six.

Unfortunate that this was cut from the show as it is clearly a great intro to how brutally efficient The Mountain is. This is a man who hacks heads off and asks questions later. It would have taken all of 15 seconds that I'm sure they could have found. Oh well...

Then the second time we encounter him firsthand is through Arya in ACOK, when she's captured unbeknownst to him and taken to Harrenhal as a servant. Gregor doesn't hang around for long as he's gotta get murdering/plundering, but he does at least stay to supervise questioning the prisoners. In the show, this was basically replaced with the Tywin/Arya scenes. 

So how does Gregor go about choosing prisoners to question...?

&gt; She had thought she had known what it meant to be afraid, but she learned better in that storehouse beside the Gods Eye. Eight days she
had lingered there before the Mountain gave the command to march, and every day she had seen someone die. The Mountain would come into the storehouse after he had broken his fast and pick one of the prisoners for questioning. The village folk
would never look at him. Maybe they thought that if they did not notice him, he would not notice them . . . but he saw them anyway and
picked whom he liked.  
One girl shared a soldiers bed three nights running; the Mountain picked her on the fourth day, and the soldier said nothing.  
A smiley old man mended their clothing and babbled about his son, off serving in the gold cloaks at Kings Landing. A kings man, he is,
he would say, a good kings man like me, all for Joffrey. He said it so often the other captives began to call him All-for-Joffrey whenever the
guards werent listening. All-for-Joffrey was picked on the fifth day.  
A young mother with a pox-scarred face offered to freely tell them all she knew if theyd promise not to hurt her daughter. The Mountain
heard her out; **the next morning he picked her daughter, to be certain shed held nothing back.**

Not much reason to who he picks, but a whole lot of cruelty...

So how is the questioning done when you work for the Mountain?

&gt;The ones chosen were questioned in full view of the other captives, so they could see the fate of rebels and traitors. A man the others called
the Tickler asked the questions. His face was so ordinary and his garb so plain that Arya might have thought him one of the villagers before
she had seen him at his work. Tickler makes them howl so hard they piss themselves, old stoop-shoulder Chiswyck told them. **Ser Gregor Clegane himself would stand motionless, watching and listening, until the victim died.** No one ever survived the
Ticklers questioning; no man, no woman, no child. The strongest lasted past evenfall. Their bodies were hung beyond the fires for the
wolves.

Torture. Slow, brutal torture, with The Mountain watching. Silent and motionless, the entire time. What a fucking psychopath. 

So...what kind of information did all of this torture get them? What did The Mountain get for his cruelty?

&gt;They found a little gold, a little silver, a great sack of copper pennies, and a dented goblet set with garnets that two soldiers almost came to
blows over. **They learned that Lord Beric had ten starvelings with him, or else a hundred mounted knights; that he had ridden west, or north,
or south; that he had crossed the lake in a boat; that he was strong as an aurochs or weak from the bloody flux.**

Nothing. All of those poor souls just screaming anything they thought The Mountain wanted to hear. He's trying to hunt down the Brotherhood Without Banners but the only thing he knows how to do is hurt people, so that's how he tries to get answers. For the rest of ACOK and the beginning of ASOS I believe he is just in the Riverlands burning as much as he can and continuing to hunt tBwB. You can imagine very clearly how horrific that is though now that you've seen it through Arya's eyes. I don't think he gets any more on-screen time until the trial by combat, but I will go through ASOS in a little more detail this afternoon. 

I hope you enjoyed these passages on The Mountain - the show is better than the books in some ways (like being able to see Tyrion's face during Oberyn's speech) but the books are still far better in establishing the more peripheral characters.",0,1,False,default,,,,,

He seems like the only Lannister that is actually smart and not ruthless.  But was his personality forged by the hate he received daily?  If he had been born normal size, his mother alive, and had his father's love would he have been more like Jaime?  Jaime pushes a kid out a window, shows nothing but arrogance over his fighting skills, rapes his sister and refuses to help his brother escape and he actually likes Tyrion.  Would Tyrion have turned out like that?  Would he have been arrogant, and not as smart?  He likes to read, but does he read to escape?  If he was able to fight and train to be a knight and raised to be the heir or suitable match to a castle, would he have read.  We know that Jaime is dyslexic and over came that through force of will by his father.  Did Tyrion have the same problem (since having a close relative is a huge factor in the genetics of it)?  Did he overcome that by just forcing himself to read?  If he wasn't forced to read by trying to avoid his father's wrath or his sister's hate or the ridicule, would he have tried?

 Basically I think Jon isn't actually Neds bastard but is actually the son of Neds sister Lyanna. And the father could possibly be a Targaryan and Ned knew but was hiding it so he wouldn't be murdered with the rest of the Targaryans. Which also could be what Lyanna meant when she was dying in Neds arms and said ""promise me"" implying for Ned to take care of Jon.

Im curious what other people think or if anyone can prove this wrong, or have any more evidence to support it.

Flee, flee for your lives now.

Okay, I'm going to list an idea for each character, but please add more and share your thoughts.  Trying to keep it organized by locale, but feel free to chime in with any character you think should also be included.  A lot of these are going to likely get cut anyhow.

*King's Landing*

**Osmund Kettleblack**

Probably replaced by Meryn Trant.  If not I have no good ideas here.

**High Septon** (~~possibly~~ definitely Howland Reed)

Call me crazy, but I actually like [Brian Downey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Downey_(actor)) for this.  He can do an Irish/Newfie accent, he's short, and he can look the part and has the age.

**Randall Tarly**

Probably wont be included.  If he is I kind of like [Peter Mullan](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0611932/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1) and I'm not the first to suggest that idea.

*Pyke*

**Euron Greyjoy**

[Michiel Huisman](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0401264/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1) is perfect for the part.

**Victarion Greyjoy**

I've seen [Ian McShane](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0574534/?ref_=tt_cl_t4) suggested for other roles as well, but I can see him as a Victarion.

**The Damphair** (Aeron Greyjoy, who wont be named that because it sounds too much like Euron)

Honestly, he's the least important Greyjoy, so I have to imagine he will be cut.  Or just use the bit part actor from Season 2; at least it has continuity. 

*Dorne*

**Doran Martel**

[F. Murray Abraham](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000719/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1)

**Quentin Martel**

No ideas here.

**Areo Hotah** 

I honestly think it will just be an extra.  He seriously has no personality.

**Arianne Martel**

People have suggested [Gemma Arterton](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2605345/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1) from that terrible Prince of Persia movie.  

**Arys Oakheart** (also might end up being just an extra)

Give [Andrew Havill](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0369854/?ref_=tt_cl_t8) a goatee and call it a fit for me.

*The Rhoyne*

**Griff** (aka Jon Connington)

We all want (Kevin McKidd](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0571727/?ref_=tt_cl_t1), and because of his relationship with HBO I think this one might actually happen.

**Young Griff** (aka Aegon Targaryen aka Aegon Blackfyre aka Aegon Mopatis)

I think that [Mitch Hewer](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2356535/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1) looks the part more than the popular [Nick Hoult](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0396558/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1) idea being tossed around, but I can't say I've seen any of his work.  Guessing this one on looks alone.

In season three, what I thought to be one of the most telling and important scenes, with regards to the motivation of both Littlefinger and Varys was the chaos monolouge and the conversation between the two before that. (Posted below)

What I took away from this supported the opinion that I had been forming for most of the series, which is that Varys and Littlerfinger are foils of one another. Littlefinger wants chaos as a means to aquiring power, while Varys wants order as a means to preserving the realm. Even symbolically, Littlefinger is a Whoremonger while Varys is a eunich.  

In the second video I attached, Littlefinger during his monolouge says that love, among other things, is just a distraction. Yet in this season Varys says basicaly the same thing to Prince Oberyn that Littlefinger said last season. Littlefinger seems to be taking an increasing interest in Sansa this season, which makes me think his motives are in the process of shifting, if they have not already. 

With regards to the series as a whole but especially with Littlefinger and Varys, actions can speak just as loud as words. I am intruigued and curious about both, Littlefinger's most recent actions with regards to Sansa and Lysa Aryyn, and Varys' meaningful glance at the Iron Throne in the first video.  

tr;dl My questions are: After the happenings of the latest two episodes, where does Littlefinger stand when weighing the value of Power vs. Love? And similarly, have Varys' motives changed since the last season? And if not what was the purpose of the meaningful glance to the throne?

He says that the negotiations  are serious and that there are amazing locations that could be used if an agreement is reached.

Other interesting information:  According to [**Mara Vzquez**]( http://www.europapress.es/andalucia/almeria-00350/noticia-hbo-visito-localizaciones-almeria-hace-algunos-meses-recrear-escenas-juego-tronos-20140522123811.html)  member of the provincial government of Almera

There are still battles to fight and Almeria could offer a perfect area for the final outcome.""*


She also said that they should be careful because although the possibilities of GoT filming in Spain are high there are other countries that are also being scout for locations.

Finally, there are also rumors that HBO is negotiating with the  [**Real Alczar de Sevilla**] (http://i.imgur.com/J4V5iGW.jpg)  board about shooting there  in July and August.

How close did the Targaryens come to putting it down? Who was allied with the Targaryens? I know Houses Baratheon and Stark rebelled (and I think the Tullys did too, right?), and that the Tyrells half-assedly supported the Targs. What about the Lannisters? I know they supported the Targaryens for a time, before betraying them at the end. But was their support cautious like the Tyrells, or had they been really invested in propping up the Targaryens until it was clear they would lose? Furthermore, If my run-down is accurate, it doesn't really seem like the Targaryens stood a chance. Am I missing any key players? To what degree did House Martell take part? How big was the royal army controlled directly by Rhaegar, where did those troops come from, and where are they now?

So many questions. ",7,3,False,self,,,,,

I couldn't kill my curiosity and found out that Rhaegar's son Aegon is alive, or so it is thought. I also read that this was discovered in the book ""A Dance with Dragons"". This got me thinking. If GRRM named this book after the Dance of the Dragons, the Targaryen Civil war hundreds of years prior to current time, he must have a reason in doing so right?

I really don't want anything more spoiled for me but what I would like to know is: Do Aegon and his Aunt Dany fight for the throne just as their ancestors did hundreds of years ago?

Robert Baratheon was the king during Season 1, so why wasn't there any large contingent of Baratheon troops in King's Landing that could have aided Ned Stark? 


I'm asking this because there seemed to be alarmingly large number of Lannister soldiers in King's Landing. Wouldn't it make sense for soldiers from the King's house to be stationed in the capital?



Also, Joffrey was guarded by Lannister soldiers. Wouldn't it make sense for soldiers from House Baratheon to guard the king?


This makes me wonder...how does transition of power happen in King's Landing? Let's say one house doesn't rule the kingdom anymore, what happens to the soldiers from that house and soldiers from the new house in power? 



I was rewatching Season 1 and Ned Stark only had two dozen men while Lannisters seemed to have a lot more.

I've only recently started developing a palate for craft beers, so I apologize if all of my terminology isn't spot on. This is my first attempt at rating a beer based on personal experience alone. With that being said...

Pour - This beer requires a little bit of finesse when pouring. When poured ""correctly"", you end up with about a 2 finger thick head. However, it is quite foamy. The bottle describes it's head as ""luxurious"", and it is exactly that.

Fragrance - Blood and Fire is the only beer from the GoT line that I have tried so far. Apparently, Iron Throne was more floral, and Take the Black was more coffee and chocolate. To me, Fire and Blood has a ""spicy"" nose to it, with some kind of fruit in the back. The smell however is pretty subtle... and for the most part, just smells like beer lol.

Taste - The first thing I notice is a dark, red fruit flavor. This red ale is surprisingly sweet, followed by slight tickle of spice at the end. I can't immediately identify the fruit, but the ""Fire"" in this beer is apparently ancho chile. The beer has a smooth texture, and is pleasantly malty in flavor.

Side Note: Despite the chile being a background flavor, this isn't a beer you want to chug down. The spice in this will catch up to you if you don't respect it.

Visual Appeal - Ommegang released 3 different growler designs for Fire and Blood. Each features one of Daenerys's dragons- Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion. The artwork is nice and collectible. I have to say that, once poured, this ale has a gorgeous red glow to it that is true to it's name.

Overall Rating: I give Fire and Blood red ale by Ommegang Brewery a 4/5. This isn't a beer i'd pick up to drink just any time. I would reserve it for some kind of occasion or a nice meal. However, it is quite tasty and interesting. I mainly knocked a point because as much as I enjoyed it, this beer gave me a slight case of spicy butthole at the end of the night.

Price - Around $10 for a 750ml bottle with 6.8% ABV.

Trying to better understand his story.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/26atp7/season_4_some_questions_about_littlefinger_trying/,guzzball,1400855635,"1.) We recently found out that Jon Arryn's death was Petyr's doing through Lysa. And Lysa then told Cat that she believed the Lannisters were behind it. I'm guessing Littlefinger's reason for killing Jon would be so that he could later marry Lysa and hopefully then become Lord of the Vale. However, Jon Arryn was about to reveal Jaime and Cersei's relationship and that Jaime was the father of Cersei's children, not Robert. Did Petyr know this? Why would he save them from Jon Arryn, only to blame them for his death? Perhaps it was all to take a stab at Ned and the Starks (since it ended with Ned's death), but I feel like telling Cat that the Lannisters did it would *really* put her at risk.

2.) Later in season 3, Petyr plans on taking Sansa with him to the Eyrie, but he ends up leaving without her. My memory is a little fuzzy, but why didn't he take her with him? Was it because his plan to take her was figured out?

3.) Earlier Petyr was given Harrenhal. Does he still control this? I don't think we've seen or heard him visiting or doing anything with it.

4.) Also, after Petyr left King's Landing, was he still on ""good terms"" with the Crown and the Lannisters? He was replaced as Master of Coin, so does he serve them any purpose or still have a high standing position? Do they still think of him as on their side? Surely they will hear of him marrying Lysa, so wouldn't that cause problems, or has he openly left them and no longer pretending to be their ally?

5.) We also know that Littlefinger was the mastermind behind Joffrey's murder. His reasoning was explained kind of as just wanting to stir the pot. However, did he really do it as a way to take revenge for Catelyn's death? I don't think we see him after her death until he takes Sansa from King's Landing. I'm sure her death would have caused him a great deal of grief, but we haven't really seen any reaction from him. I'd think there are other people who would be more appropriate to kill for revenge, but maybe he's planning for that in the future.",23,37,False,self,,,,,

-----

All through out the show/books so far we've been embroiled in engaging character dramas that have taken us through all sorts of highs and lows. Even with some of the inconsistencies between book and film, It's been one hell of an emotional roller-coaster and it's only going to get better. (Or worse!) 

However one thing that is constantly running through my head is the ""big picture"" of everything going on.

Let's start from the beginning, from a complete noob first time show watcher's perspective. We're shown some rangers who encounter some sort of undead-like enemy, but we know almost nothing besides that. Later we meet a Targaeryen who becomes a dragon-MILF, and we start to get an idea of the real powers of Westeros.

In King's Landing and in much of the Seven Kingdoms there is constant political strife and faction-warfare. We know that certain leaders are aware of The Others, yet refuse to take action for their own selfish reasons. Some knew of Dany obviously and after failing to kill her it seems like they've been keeping tabs on her conquests. But still, the power-hungry Lannisters are too busy to be paying attention to white walkers or dragons, and the other houses are involved in their own disputes as well. So as is human nature, the reality of the future gets pushed to the back of everyone's mind while they continue to squabble endlessly. 

I believe there is more to the title ""A song of Ice and Fire"" and I suspect that ""Ice and Fire"" is exactly how the series will end. Here we have two major underlying themes and they just so happen to be the biggest most important issues/threats that everyone in Westeros is finally realizing they shouldn't be ignoring. In spite of all the politics and intrigue, there's just the fact that **AN UNSTOPPABLE HORDE OF MYSTICAL UNDEAD ARE COMING, ALONG WITH THREE VERY HUNGRY DRAGONS AND THEIR BLOOD-SOAKED QUEEN.** And I for one can not wait. Also, I miss Ned. :(",10,0,False,self,,,,,

&gt; Halfway along the route, a **wailing woman** forced her way between two watchmen and ran out into the street in front of the king and his companions, **holding the corpse of her dead baby above her head. It was blue and swollen, grotesque, but the real horror was the mothers eyes.** Joffrey looked for a moment as if he meant to ride her down, but Sansa Stark leaned over and said something to him. **The king fumbled in his purse, and flung the woman a silver stag. The coin bounced off the child** and rolled away, under the legs of the gold cloaks and into the crowd, where a dozen men began to fight for it. The mother never once blinked. Her skinny arms were trembling from the dead weight of her son.

&gt; Leave her, Your Grace, Cersei called out to the king, shes beyond our help, poor thing.

Edit: Bolded. Maybe foreshadowing was the wrong word, but basically the dead, swollen, blue baby parallels Joffrey choking to death, while the horror in the mother's eyes parallels that of Cersei's when she was holding Joffrey.

The silver stag bouncing off of the dead baby is also interesting because Joffrey is a (fake) Baratheon.

Also I don't think this is mere coincidence because GRRM takes tender care of every single sentence and IIRC, I think he knew Joffrey's death was coming even before ASOS.",18,14,False,self,,,,,

The way this is presented, its supposed to be seen as a deep betrayal of their love and the intimate bond they once had. A lot of people have expressed shock and surprise at this but if you think about it, it makes sense that this would happen.

Shae didnt betray Tyrion Lannister, because Tyrion had already betrayed her and broken the bond of their love. You may recall a conversation in Season 3 when Shae suggests that the two of them elope, and that there is nothing left for him in Kings Landing. Tyrion refuses, explaining that he doesnt wasnt to live a life of mediocrity, and that he thrives in the realm of power and politics. This is his betrayal he admits that he loves being important more than he loves Shae!

How else are you supposed to react to the person you love telling you that youre important, but not *that* important? Youd be really hurt. But Tyrion goes a step even further and betrays Shae a second time. When he tells Shae that he is concerned about her safety, she insists that she can take care of herself. But instead of trusting in her agency as a human being, and acknowledging that she is his equal, he concocts an extremely passive aggressive, roundabout plan in which he calls her a whore and tries to get her angry enough to leave. He not only refuses to acknowledge her right right to decide for herself, he implies that she is mere chattel and is incapable of doing so at all. 

Shae testifying against Tyrion is not surprising in the least. Theres no doubt that Tyrion loved her, but he loved her in an overly protective way, as though she were his property. Yes, its true that Tyrion and Shae were faced with a difficult situation the extreme danger of the Lannister patriarch. But instead of siding with his true love, he sides with his enemies, and his prideful need to be important. The assasination of King Jeoffrey and the subsequent trial just happens to be the perfect opportunity for Shae to express how hurt she is.  It wasnt a betrayal, because Tyrions previous betrayals had already destroyed the bond that the two of them had.  

Tyrion is definitely one of good people in the show, and he is better than most, but in this one case, he really fucked up.",37,0,False,default,,,,,

MARTIN:They know certain things. Ive told them certain things. So they have some knowledge, but the devil is in the details. I can give them the broad strokes of what I intend to write, but the details arent there yet. Im hopeful that I can not let them catch up with me. The season thats about to debut covers the second half of the third book. The third book [A Storm of Swords] was so long that it had to be split into two. But there are two more books beyond that, A Feast for Crowsand A Dance With Dragons. A Dance With Dragons is itself a book thats as big as A Storm of Swords. So theres potentially three more seasons there, between Feast and Dance, if they split into two the way they did [with Storms]. Now, Feast and Dance take place simultaneously. So you cant do Feast and then Dance the way I did. You can combine them and do it chronologically. And its my hope that theyll do it that way and then, long before they catch up with me, Ill have published The Winds of Winter, whichll give me another couple years.

HBO being ostensibly a top production company in the world ... It baffles me as to why they chose to dump Daario Naharis'old actor (guy was amazing btw, transporter lead now, I know...) with the new guy. 

Could they have named him something different, deviated from the plot a bit... Basically anything besides ""ok pretend this guy is the old guy"" and disregard the hair color, beard, height, etc etc. discontinuity for me, bigtime, basically it is dispelling my suspension of disbelief and although I love the show and ALL casting choices ...

Also: the Moutain. First guy was amazing with his one line and a half ""FUCK! bring me my horse!"" and looked the part, second mountain was ehh but mostly stayed hidden in the shadows....

Her farther died of natural causes, 
Arya and Sansa are Lannistors (as far as she is aware) and at the mercy of Jeoffery and Catelyn) ,
Bran and Rickon were killed (as far as she is aware) ,
Her husband was unjustly executed ,
Her farther died of natural causes ,
She sees her oldest son ,daughter in law(if thats the title in GoT) and unborn Granchild killed before her eyes ,
she gets killed.

I know he basically sleeps with Jeyne in the books, so marries her out of duty. Where did the character of Talisa come from? And why? How old is Jeyne,what are her possible motivations? Last time we see Jeyne her family flipped the script after the Red Wedding. What happens to her? 

Dany I just don't get. She's petulant, demanding so much without ever really earning it. This was the fault with her brother, but some how it becomes better when she does it? She rules on emotion, on being the best, and I know people who rule don't have to be nice, but most of the time, in the books and show, comes off as a moody spoiled bitch. I love her though, but what is her destiny? Can she take the Iron Throne? Should she? I don't think she would rule Westeros well at all, and I am having my doubts about her rule in Essos. 

Why is Catelyn such a bitch to John? Yes, I know she thought it was Ned's love child, but to show so much hate and disdain for a child is unnerving. Why does she believe everything that is told to her by people, it doesn't seem she delves deep, and then her wrathful turn as Lady Stoneheart... Can't stand her, she's wreaked havoc. 

Is Arya turning into a bad person? She's my favorite, and I understand why she kills, but at the same time, she's a really young girl with a penchant for murder. I wonder how her path will play out. Will she stay with the Faceless Men? Will she ever go back to Westeros, and be a lady again? 

Sansa and Littlefinger... who else thinks they're going to fuck?! I mean, I know she's legally married to Tyrion, and Littlefinger is going to force her to commit bigamy with the heir to the Vale, but I feel like he will rape her/coerce her into sex. If Tyrion comes back, which I feel he will, how will this play out? All of King's Landing saw them married. ",6,0,False,self,,,,,

Someone asked something people might not know about me, and the funniest GoT actor behind the scenes, but deleted their comment: I was a competitive swimmer when I was a child. I went to the state championships in Texas when I was 11 years old. And then I got into drama class, and I let that go right away. I'm still very comfortable in the water.
Oh my god, so many of them are so funny. The entire cast is very very witty and a fun cast, so this is very hard to choose, but I guess something that people might not expect is that Sophie Turner (Sansa) had me in stitches a lot of the time. I'm not sure if she was trying to be funny but she was still making me laugh.

Someone asked how I feel about Captain Crunch: I'm capable of eating an entire box of it without any milk. It is a sweet taste that is indescribable, Captain Crunch is its own flavor.

&gt; What do you think of /r/gayforoberyn[1] ?
&gt; [S4E8](#s ""PS I'm really excited to see The Red Viper go up against The Mountain That Rides next week!"") 

That's awesome. I think that that's the whole point of Oberyn Martell. So I think to have /r/gayforoberyn[1] is definitely in line with what he's about. And it would make him very happy and very busy, even busier than he would normally be.


&gt; I'm going to try and keep this spoiler free. Oberyn is one of the greatest warriors in Westeros, what kind of training did you have to undertake to help fit with this trait of his?
&gt; Also I'd like to add that you're fucking KILLING IT as Oberyn. (the good kind of killing it)

First, thank you VERY very much. That's always amazing for me to hear. And the production of Game of Thrones actually put me in some pre-training before I went to Europe to start shooting. I was put intro some classes with a master of Wushu, an acrobatic martial art, and they put me with a master, his name is Master Hu, and he has a studio in Los Angeles where he sort of basically showed me the basics and taught me how to fight with a spear and twist my body around and move in ways I never thought possible. And this was a guy who actually did Shaolin movies with Jet Li very early in Jet Li's career, and fought alongside him as his sidekick, so he was the real deal.
Then once I got to Europe and started shooting, there were really intensive fight rehearsals with me and the stunt team that was headed by C.C. Smiff, and other actors, and we did a lot of fight choreography and rehearsals. The Oberyn style of fighting is inspired by Wushu.


&gt; If you could play any other character in Game of Thrones, which one would you want to play as and why?
&gt; Love you btw :*

:-* back!
And these kind of questions are always so very hard because I am a fan of the show, and was a fan of the show before I even had an audition for it, and I love so many of the characters. To be a little obvious and in line with all of the fans, I'm in love with Arya. I don't know if I could handle the kind of trauma that her character has to go through, but the fierceness with which she empowers herself sort of reluctantly is pretty amazing, and that would be a very very juicy role. But this is me being forced to pick one out of many others. I like Varys, the way he puppet masters things from the shadows. I don't know if anyone other than Alfie Allen could handle the role that he has and go through what he god through, [Season 3](#s ""from being lost to being despicable and victimized""). And I'm not even going to touch anything else... I'm just going to stick with being Oberyn.


&gt; How closely do you relate to Oberyn Martell in terms of your personality?

Well, let's see. I would certainly say that I'm a lot more cautious than Oberyn Martell is. But in fantasy, as in my own fantasies, I think he would encompass the kind of person that I would like to be in my dream life. And I find him to be a very sexy person for a lot of different reasons. There's so much about him and the richness of his character, because he is very dangerous, very sensual, but he's also very intelligent, and a loyal person full of integrity and his loyalties go very very deep. And his hatred runs from a very very emotional place. It's not just because he has beef with the world out of just being an angry guy, it's very specifically related to a tragedy in his life. And I think the hatred's deepness is so profound that i find that really attractive.

&gt; How do you feel knowing youve caused countless men and women alike, to reconsider their sexual orientation, you magnificent bastard?

That makes me feel wonderful. I think that that's key to Oberyn. That he is the kind of person that is attractive and sort of breaks boundaries. He doesn't play by the rules, so the fact that anyone would be attracted to him, no matter what their sexual orientation is, is very in line with the kind of character that he is. So I think that's great.

&gt; Hi Pedro! Your portrayal of Oberyn is fantastic so far, seriously wow.
&gt; My question is: Did you read/refer to the books for this role or did you stick to the script?

I read the Tyrion chapters in Book 3 after I got the part, and it helped me a lot, and there's such a richness in George R.R. Martin's language and there are things that are described that can only be played, I guess, on screen, so it was very informative to me. And I think now I'm excited because when all is said and done, I can just sort of (and when I need my GOT fix) i can start at the very beginning and read all of the books.

&gt; Good afternoon Mr. Pascal! First off, I wanted to say that you have been doing a terrific job this season so far in game of thrones. I've heard that you are a fan of the show as well! As a fan, what has been your favorite thing about being able to work on the show? Also, have you had any memorable moments behind-the-scenes with other cast members?
&gt; Thanks for doing an AMA!


I've never had an experience like this where I got to be a part of something that i was already aware of as a fan. And the experience of being on-set for the first time was really surreal and a little overwhelming because even if you didn't know anything about GoT, if you showed up to work on it you'd still be so impressed and wonder how this could possibly be a TV show because it feels so epic when you're doing it. To add on top of that the fact that i was already a fan, and was being thrown into the center of such an important storyline and getting to interact with these amazing characters played by these amazing actors, I was pinching myself throughout the entire 4th session. It never really let up, there was never a point of adjustment, I never landed completely. I was kind of in awe of it throughout.
Lena is one of my favorite persons. And she (in life) is so funny and so smart, such a good person, a good friend and a good mother, I think everyone on that set and anyone who comes in contact with her develops an instant crush. Talk about male or female, you're going to get a crush on her easy. And I was just lucky that I got to work with her and hit it off and continue being friends. Everybody was a joy to work with. It's just this huge family and the great thing about the way that David Benioff and Dan Weiss have adapted the character of Oberyn is that they have him interact with even MORE characters, and getting to be in the trial, and at the wedding, I got to meet so many of the actors, and being an actor from the US, I was staying in the hotel that all the other actors were coming in and out of. I got to meet and hang out with so many of the other actors that I didn't have scenes with. There was another new addition to the cast, which is Ellaria Sand played by Indira Varma, and she and I got along really really well which is very important because she is a character who is Oberyn's equal and the love of his life. And she's just as fierce as he is, and that is why they are together, so we got to do a lot of fun stuff together. But I got to love working with so many of them, Peter Dinklage and working with him was a career highlight, I mean, you can refer to what i said earlier about it never ceasing to be a completely surreal and wonderful experience.

&gt; So far (S4E7) has there been a scene that was particularly difficult for you to film?

I think that my first day onset was actually a pretty big scene, [S4E07](#s ""this was my scene in Tyrion's cell with Peter Dinklage ""), and it's a beautifully written scene but it was really important to me to get it right. And I was really nervous. And it turned out not to be a difficult scene to shoot because Peter was so amazing to work with and he's such a generous actor. And our director Alik Sakharov, he was the director of that episode, and he's one of the best directors I've ever worked with, so that and the amazing writing turned it into (to this day) one of the best workdays I've ever had.
And of course, as far as what is upon us in the next episode, [S4E7](#s ""The Viper versus the Mountain, was one of the most challenging things I've ever done."")

&gt; Who was your role model growing up?

I had a lot of different role models. My dad took me to the movies my whole life, he was a big movie buff, and me and my sister would go with him to the movies a few times a week. So I had so many heroes, like all of the major actors. I would have to say one of my favorite actors is probably Gene Hackman, but that's a really hard question to answer because I've had so many heroes that I've admired, filmmakers that i have loved, I remember seeing Steven Soderbergh's first movie when I was really young and then seeing every movie he did after that. I was a very book reading, television and movie watching geek. So it makes it endless in terms of the amount of people that I have admired.

&gt; Question:
&gt; If you were a betting man, and had no prior knowledge of the outcome - who would you put your money on? The Mountain or The Red Viper?

I would put my money on the Red Viper.

It's gap week, but I have finals to study for and I desperately need something to procrastinate, so let's have another followup! This week we'll be covering some general topics regarding book-to-show translation.

**TL;DR: Book trivia - Reader perspective - No spoilers - Exceptionally serious section titles**

WARNING: WALL OF TEXT

---

###The Road So Far

CARRY ON MY WAYWARD SOOOON

If you want to read the latest followup (or any of the preceding ones), go to my [compilation post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/24i7sr/bookshow_followups_for_nonreaders_compilation/).

^(Yes, this paragraph's purpose was mostly making a Supernatural reference; I regret nothing.)

###Point of View

**POV** is a core concept to all books in A Song of Ice and Fire. Every chapter's title is a name of one of the characters. The whole chapter is then narrated from that character's viewpoint - we can see the their thoughts on the situation and recall their experiences from the past. This means that everything that happens without POV character present remains unkown to the reader unless somebody tells them about it.

What this means in particular is that no chapter ever could be written from Littlefinger's or Varys's perspective, since any insight into their minds would reveal too much too early. Any scenes between those two, including ""Chaos is a ladder"", are show-only content. Why do those scenes exist, then? Well, any commentary on them by POV characters happens mostly in their minds. Since we can't read character's minds, some scenes expose secondary characters, such as the imfamous brothel scenes.

A hefty detail about POV chapter system is the Prologues. Every prologue is narrrated from the perspective of a one-time character who dies at the end of the prologue. Same for epilogues, but only ASOS and ADWD have those.

POV characters in *A Game of Thrones* are: Will (prologue), Bran Stark, Catelyn Stark, Eddard Stark (until he gets thrown into the black cells), Daenerys Targaryen, Jon Snow, Arya Stark, Tyrion Lannister and Sansa Stark.

POV characters in *A Clash of Kings* are the same, plus: maester Cressen (prologue), Davos Seaworth and Theon Greyjoy.

POV characters in *A Storm of Swords* expand by: Chett (prologue, one of Night's Watch mutineers), Jaime Lannister and Samwell Tarly. Catelyn Stark's last chapter is the Red Wedding, breaking the unwritten rule that POV characters don't die in theri own chapters (Eddard's death is described from Arya's POV). Meanwhile, Theon Greyjoy is nowhere to be found.

Now here comes the funny part. *A Feast For Crows* breaks the convention and titles the first chapter ""The Prophet"" and the second ""The Captain of the Guards"". Both are written from the perspective of new characters. Once the focus switches to Brienne (new POV, we're there right now in her road trip with Podrick), it's titled with her name again. This trend kinda continues and the whole system is quite consistent with its new structure, but for the sake of not spoiling anything past the show I won't say anything about further contents.

Then, *A Dance With Dragons* comes. Chronogically it's mostly parallel to AFFC and divided by characters, so there is no Sansa in ADWD and no Daenerys in AFFC (both storylines in the show already pass over the end of ASOS: Lysa's death and Daenerys' decision to remain in Meereen). And here's the most shocking part. There are chapters titled ""Reek"" - a broken person that seems to be a new character, and since it's a book, you can't see his face. You can imagine the revelation when after a good few chapters an unsuspecting reader realizes that Reek is, or ""was"", in fact, Theon Greyjoy. And that's where we are in the show right now.

You may begin to realize why reading the books needs to be started from book one, page one. No shortcuts.

###Character Management

Cast of GoT is already huge for TV standards, and ASOIAF is ever bigger. You have no idea. There are hundreds and hundreds of named characters, I believe the number reaches somewhere over a thousand. Most are only mentioned, but many are physically present in the events of chapters, and some actually play a vital part in the story. However, they had to be removed to maintain any sort of clarity. Most prominent characters cut from the show are:

* Stannis's court - Davos has only three chapters in ACOK, but in his six chapters in ASOS there are many, many more characters than just him and Melisandre, including the new young maester replacing the late poisoner Cressen, and an odd fool Patchface. Davos doesn't even become Hand of the King until the previous guy gets burned for treason (and not heresy). It helps portray Davos's status as a bystander in the crowd of nobles, but could have gotten cut from the show with no real problems.

* Tyrell brothers - Loras has two older brothers, the eldest Willas remaining crippled in Highgarden (he is the one promised to Sansa, which makes the match bitter but realistic) and one coming with the show siblings to King's Landing (Garlan is the one wearing Renly's armor to start the legend of Renly's ghost breaking the siege of Blackwater). This of course means that show Loras's status as the only heir is not a thing in the book.

* The Freys - they are truly numerous. Two of them are kept in Winterfell as wards and give Bran a hard time, one meets Arya in Harrenhal bragging about marrying the princess, unbeknownst of the fact that Arya is the said princess of the North. 

* Ghost of High Heart - one of the sources of prophecies, so a liability to the show format. Her role got partially taken over by Melisandre's assessment of Arya.

* Lemoncloak - one of the members of Brotherhood without Banners, his humorous attire got ceded to Anguy the archer

* House Westerling - Robb's wife in the books is Jeyne Westerling, daughter of one of the Lannister bannermen. This brings Westerlings to Robb's cause.... or, according to some theories, closes in the trap for Robb.

* Characters I cannot describe in detail since they can still appear in the show later, like Strong Belwas and Coldhands

In some cases, a character's storyline is postponed for a season or two to avoid overloading with new cast:

* The Reed siblings accompany Bran in Winterfell in ACOK and already start guiding him through his visions. Their role in season 2 got taken over by Osha and maester Luwin, moving the Reeds to season 3.

* Selyse and Shireen Baratheon are in Dragonstone from the very beginning of Davos's POV story. Shireen befriends Edric Storm (book equivalent of Gendry, a bit younger).

* Riverrun is featured in ACOK, with Edmure Tully and Brynden ""Blackfish"" Tully present. Hoster Tully is on his deathbed and the words he utters in sickness imply the story of Lysa's terminated pregnancy.

* Oberyn Martell arrives a little bit earlier, before Red Wedding, but it's a minor difference

There are also show-only characters who fulfill various storytelling roles:

* Ros, the prostitute moving from Winterfell to King's Landing - hated at first, she became the converation partner for Theon, Littlefinger, maester Pycelle, and, later on, Varys.

* Olyvar, the male prostitute running Littlefinger's brothel in his absence. It's actually a huge change from the book that Loras gets seduced by him - book Loras is definitely not a man-whore and still grieves Renly.

###Foreshadowing

Everything regarding visions and prophecies got drastically changed. When a character sees something in the book, their impression is often vague and they surely don't understand the implications of the vision - but in the show, everything would become much more apparent. What would reveal too much was:

* Ned's dream after he gets struck by Jaime before Littlefinger's brothel. He recalls the times of Robert's Rebellion and his failed attempt to rescue his sister Lyanna Stark. The show seems to have a no-flashbacks policy, so the scene couldn't get in, and if it got fimled, it would either reveal too much too early or remain as cryptic as it was in the books on the first read and bring nothing to the story until way, way, WAY later.

* Patchface, Stannis's fool, is a really mysterious character with his behaviour, songs and riddles. His song was sung by Shireen in S03E05. It foreshadows the smoke monster, Lysa Arryn's death and possibly much more.

* House of the Undying is so completely different I don't know where to begin. Long story short, the visions are much more detailed and actually it's not clear yet what they all mean.

* Ghost of High Heart, an old woman hosting the Brotherhood without Banners for a while, appears in Arya's chapters in ASOS. She tells about the dreams and visions she had, which include Red Wedding, Purple Wedding and much more.

A huge concept that you need to understand is reveal. The bets example here is the latest Littlefinger's scene. In the books, it's the final chapter of ASOS, crown jewel of resolves and reveals. Since the events are presented from Sansa's POV, Lysa breaking down and confessing how she killed her husband Jon Arryn doesn't happen until the Moon Door scene. Spreading the reveals through two episodes kinda diminished the effect.

It goes further from there. Littlefinger is generally much less ostentatious in the books. Any scene with his prostitutes or any smart-ass dialogue with Varys does not happen. Show sets up Littlefinger as a major player the whole time, while the books sort of keep him in the shadows. All we know about him are Eddard's, Sansa's and Tyrion's comments. This makes the Eyrie reveal much, much more impactful. It's impossible to translate into the show format, though - a regular viewer will not remember side remarks about a secondary character.

Varys is working for the realm, all for targeryans, yadda yadda yadda. I guess my concern is this; why was he trying to kill Danery's? She poses no threat against Aegon, and her survival can (and has) only helped his cause. Maybe there's background stuff we're not informed of as to who else can get the Kings (namely Robert) information about her, but if he gave false information it would have helped Dany's quest out a bit more. 

Because if it wasn't for Ser Jorah having a change of heart, there goes Dany.


I guess my only theory is that Varys didn't expect Dany to get so powerful, but either way if his Aegon plan had failed and there were no Targareyans left, you'd think he'd try for a backup plan. Seems to be largely irresponsible to put all his eggs in one basket.

It is clearly very earthlike, and must be a similar size due to similar gravity but with one major difference - the seasons in Westeros can last years at a time, what is a year in Westeros truly? As a year is defined by the planet making 1 full orbit of the sun encapsulating all 4 seasons, by this definition a year on Westeros would last decades in earth years.
Clearly the characters age in Earth years so I was wondering how this could be explained technically, and came up with 2 possibilities:
1) The sun rotates in a very slow elliptical orbit around the center of its solar system, but would need a large close orbit planet for the sun to orbit like this which would cause many eclipses.
2)The axis of rotation of the planet is unstable so the equator can be very far north and south for years.
Thoughts?

But he is obviously undead and considering there's only one faction that is able to raise undead it's kind of a given he was raised by White Walkers. Now to why he has some ""free"" will (well at least he is sentient). We know that wargs can warg into animals and back. if their body dies they stay in the animal. Now what happens if the body is revived by WW and then the warg tries to go back to it? Technically the body is made alive trough WW magic but without the spirit it's basically a empty vessel they control. Considering Benjen was a stark he is automatically a warg (he was top ranger in NW so it's possible it is also due to him knowing how to take advantage of his warg abilities) he could've been killed by WW and warged out and then back when his body was raised.

When Littlefinger betrays Ned Stark back in season 1, was that his intention all along? If I remember correctly, he approaches Ned before and suggests that Ned side with Renly and take the crown. When Ned refuses, he says he will get the City watch for him, and we all know how this ends. Did Littlefinger all along know Ned wouldn't take his advice and had the betrayal all planned out? Did Littlefinger try and get the city watch, find out they were all ready taken and side with Cercei as he had no other option? Did he only realise once they turned on Ned and just put a dagger to his throat to avoid being put down with him ( I think this is pretty unlikely).

2. When Baelish finds out about the plan to marry Sansa to Loras in season 3, it appears that he worked it out through his prostitute from Loras. But we know that in season 4  he was sided with Olenna and the Tyrells, and it is assumed they at least had some sort of agreement of what they were going to do in the future by this point. So why did Olenna try and secretly steal Sansa from him in her plot with Varys? Was she the one who informed Baelish?

The white raven, in the books, is supposed to always mean the end of summer and I just thought it was so eloquent.  


Also, I'm a bit surprised reading the second book, I watched the first 3 seasons of GoT before starting the books, and the first book was almost exactly like the first season, but the second book has entirely different events, like Arya's capture and Bolton's bastard being killed and Reek being brought to Winterfell and a few others.

I get that people look to Eddard's own description in the book of himself as ""good not great"" as an example. Yes I know it's also well supported that Bandon was a far better swordsman.  That Jamie is better, while more believable, I refute the idea that he could EASILY dispatch Ned. I think the fight would be a grand one, where a slight misstep would let either win, but if done without mistakes Jamie would definitely win. 

My belief for this is three fold.
1) Eddard was a leader of the rebellion. Yes being a great commander and Lord of Winterfell with his family imprisoned is a reason he would lead. But wouldn't you also want someone who was a fearsome fighter tobe your leader. Robert was that yes, but I feel the respect Ned commands shows he was one of the best fighters in Westeros. His own account of his abilities needs to be refuted imo because Ned is a humble ass bastard.
2) No one had seen in fight in tourney's(yes i know this is only explicitly stated in the show) [at the least] after he returned to live a peaceful post-rebellion life in winterfell and many may forget when the realm had Robert and Jamie and Barristan so visible as ""great fighters"". A quiet life leads to people forgetting you.
3) The Tower of Joy. He fought 3 of the best nights of the era. Yes it was 7 on 3 but its my personal belief that it was Ned vs the Sword of the Morning with 3(EDIT:MATH IS HARD) on 1 for the rest of the fights. SOTM is considered second only to Barristan the Bold in sword repute even by Jamie it seems. My support for this is that Ned PERSONALLY took Dawn back to Ashara(yes i know the theories here but bugger that) and that Ned had hit it off with her at the tourney at Harrenhall. It's my belief he killed Arthur Dayne himself in single combat and his mad respect/guilt is why he took Dawn home himself instead of racing back to Winterfell.  


EDIT: I forgot about Howland Reed SAVING Ned. It caused me to have a very skewed vision of what I imagined occured at the TOJ and thus influenced my opinion on his swordsmanship. Disregard me.",39,9,False,self,,,,,

Now with the last episode of the season being titled The Children, I think it's fairly safe to assume that the Children of the Forest will make their first appearance, in Bran's storyline. 

Now to me, this feels like a literally the last moment of the season kind of reveal, the same as the dragons of season 1 and the White Walkers of season 2. But with those two, we had so much build up that it made the reveals so amazing and satisfying. 

With the Children, we have a single line about them from Maester Luwin back in season 2, and I'm pretty sure that's the only mention of them. Whereas I know from reading the kindle sample of AGOT that Ned used to tell his children stories about The Children, and that's in the first 100 pages of the first book. Is this going to be a massive failing of the show? Imagine for example if you're one of the people who watch the show but don't know much about the lore or mythos of the series. Episode 10 ends with seemingly an epic reveal of these little greenish people and you're just left scratching your head thinking ""What the hell was that?""

One thing kind of missing this season that was a big element in the books is that during almost the entirety of ASOS it is raining, a lot, like buckets. It is understandable why it's not shown much because it can create for difficulties when filming, and some of the locations - i.e. Croatia - may not rain much at all. The title ""A Storm of Swords"" is a play on words equating the hectic events throughout the book to the torrential downpours that seem to never end. 

These rains are very much part of a storm and are supposed to represent the hurricane season in September/October -- thus it is intended to signify that it is in fact Autumn and ... Winter is Coming.",67,419,False,self,,,,,

Ned dies and a war begins between the Starks and the Lannisters. During the war, Beric and his bros do sort of a guerrilla warfare type thing.

He was reborn when he was baptized in the sea (salt), and once more as Reek when Winterfell burned (smoke).  He is a serial traitor, and Melisandre has suggested that Stannis will betray everyone close to him.  Well, I think she's got the wrong guy.  Also, I don't think GRRM would let us off easy with it being someone obvious like Stannis or Jon Snow or Dany.

Theon has stated that he loves Ramsay, and I believe he will kill/sacrifice/betray him just as the prophecy goes.  He even said it himself during the siege of Winterfell that he'd kill Ramsay for blowing that horn.  The murder weapon may be Lightbringer.  He also made a fire offering of the farmer's children during the siege, if that's worth any brownie points with the Lord of Light.

I wouldn't get too caught up in whether Theon is morally fit to be a hero.  If anything, we're learning that conventional morals don't seem to play as much of a role in this story as do character arcs.  And I think Theon's arc can only go up from where it is now.",82,92,False,self,,,,,

But I remind myself that's she's barely a teenager, and I wasn't much better or smarter at that age.

Towards the end of season one, you can really see her growing smarter and stronger already. The first time I watched episode 10, I called her an idiot for letting the Lannisters push her around and not defending herself, but looking at her circumstances again, I realize that she doesn't have much of a choice.

What she goes through in the matter of a few days is more than what most of us go through in a lifetime. If I were taken from my current life and thrown into such a situation, I probably would have offed myself. I'm weak. But Sansa is actually strong in her own right.

She is held captive by cruel people. They force her to watch her father's murder. She is betrothed to a cruel person who slaps her around and threatens her. He forces her to stare at her father's severed head the day after his murder, while she's still grieving, and then threatens to do the same to her brother. Then he hits her when she stands up for herself. Imagine if you went through all that in over the course of a few days. It sounds horrendous.

You may still call her weak, but what else is she to do now? If she hits Joffrey back, she'll be killed. If she leaves, she'll be killed. If she so much as talks back to him, he has her punished.

Anyway, this is just a bit of rambling. I'd enjoy hearing your opinions and ideas.

If by any means the grumpkins are real and bran finds one he could have the three wishes, therefore we could walk again and get he's brother and father back. That would be a really nice plot twist one that would make most of us drop our jaws.

However, in these S4E8 still images from the preview, http://imgur.com/a/VOuFV , she has quite clearly made it to the Vale. 

What do you guys think that will happen in reguards to her storyline?

""I'll have his best. Smart birds, and strong.""

""*Strong*"" his own bird said, preening. ""*Strong, strong*""

""If it happens we're all butchered out there, I mean for my successor to know where and how we died.""

Talk of butchery reduced Samwell Tarly to speechlessness. Mormont leaned forward. ""Tarly, when I was a lad half your age, my lady mother told me that if I stood about with my mouth open, a weasel was like to mistake it for it's lair and run down my throat. If you have something to say, say it. Otherwise, **beware of weasels**."" He waved a brusque dismissal. ""Off with you, I'm too busy for folly. No doubt the maester has some work you can do.""

One of the most exciting moments for me while reading ACOK was when I learned Jon Snow is a warg, similarly learning that Arya was a warg during an early ASOS chapter was awesome.

So my question is, do all Starks have the potential to be wargs due to having blood of the First Men, and Bran is just special? Or are they all wargs but just don't know it? Meaning Sansa and Rickon as well. 

Here is an album containing the passages which I am talking about, first is Jon's followed by Arya's. I apologize if its a little difficult to read. They were taken from a physical book.

My least favorite is probably the entire Stark Family, bar Arya and Jon Snow, because they always have to be such useless white knights.

Just bang the other chick on the side for god's sakes. Ned Stark too, the guy just won't get his hands dirty, and won't try and play the game in kings landing, leading to him getting killed, when he could have easily allied himself with Little Finger, and gotten a much more suitable king on the throne.

Defend the weak. Respect the gods. Obey the laws. It's too much. No matter what you do, you're forsaking one vow or the other.*

**Jorah Mormont** mentoring Dany:

*It's tempting to see your enemies as evil, but there's good and evil on both sides of every war ever fought.*

The idea of bloodlines and ""rightful heir to the throne"" is also a recurring sentiment among many characters, which I find laughable (kind of the point, I know). Some characters reject this notion; understandably so as many of whom desire the Iron Throne but do not fit the traditional criteria of nobility or rightful heir as the law of the land decrees.

**Renly Baratheon** was one of my favorite characters as he seemed to be one of the most level-headed candidates for king:

*What's best for the people we rule? We all know what Stannis is. He inspires no love or loyalty. He's not a king, I am.*

I could never get behind a character like **Robb Stark** because he was able to rationalize in his mind the deaths of thousands of men at war to avenge the death of one man or the lives of his sisters. Or most of the Starks for that matter, as their convoluted sense of honor and loyalty ultimately led to their own demise. 

What are your favorite characters who ""get it?""",184,112,False,self,,,,,

In the books he is currently holding Riverrun against the Frey forces, and does not appear until late AFFC when Jaime marches up to treat with him.

Seeing as he attended the RW in the show, do you think there is a chance that he will pass by Brienne/Pod or Sandor/Arya (unlikely as they are probably nearer the vale by now). It would feel a bit fan servicey, much like the Hot Pie scene, but it could be pretty cool seeing as we've not been told much about Blackfish so far in the show.

When Tywin dies, it will leave a power vacuum in King's Landing, yes. But who would be better placed to fill that vacuum? Stannis, stranded on Dragonstone, with little support and no established wealth? Or Olenna Tyrell, the matriarch of house Tyrell, who controls Margaery, a queen beloved by her people, and, through Margaery, the king himself? Who else is ambitious enough, powerful enough, and well-placed enough to seize power in King's Landing? Why should Stannis even be a candidate?

With that in mind, I give you the list I threw together earlier (some are current/popular suggestions, some I have not seen mentioned here yet): 


**Areo Hotah:** [Howard Charles](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4374184/) or [Danny Sapani](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0764527/)

**Doran**: I'm a fan of a lot of people's ideas here, but I've only ever had one person in mind: [Alfred Molina](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000547/?ref_=nv_sr_2)

**Arianne:** [Amber Rose Revah](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2362244/), [Antonia Thomas](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3687902/?ref_=nv_sr_1), (yet another Misfits alumni for GoT to acquire) or (if they decide to age her by more than a couple of years) perhaps [Nazanin Boniadi](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2258164/)? Assuming she's not busy with Homeland, that is. 

**Griff/JonCon:** [Tony Curran](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0192889/?ref_=nv_sr_1).

**Euron:** The obvious fan choices here are indeed solid actors. Ideally it'd be between [James Purefoy](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0700856/) and [Dominic West](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0922035/), and I honestly would not envy anyone who has to choose between the two; but this is a counter-post to those popular opinions, so... 

Howsabout [Robert Carlyle](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001015/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1)? He's another popular British (Scottish to be specific) actor, has played many villains, and has two things over the others: he's probably somewhat less in demand these days *and* he's much closer to Patrick Malahide's (Balon Greyjoy) age -- this is perhaps a sorely underrated factor; Malahide is *69* and both West and Purefoy are under 50. 

**Victarion:** [Vincent Regan](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0716490/) is *exactly* how I have always pictured Victarion, and he is a realistic choice. 

Also fits in with the age considerations, as Vic is supposed to be younger than Euron and Balon, but still extremely physically fit.

**Aeron:** [Jon Campling](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1376997/) gets an honourable mention for bringing epic hair both facial and cranial to the party, but...

Essentially this just calls for a good actor in his 40's/50's, so what about [James Frain](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0289656/), [Philip Glenister](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0322562/) or [Rupert Graves](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001291/?ref_=nv_sr_2) as some examples? Hell, it'll almost certainly be someone even less well known than any of these three. Seriously, think of a decent British/Irish actor between 40-60 who's in relatively good shape, and he'd be as potential an Aeron as any other.

**The Kindly Man:** [Tim McInnerny](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0570570/). 

**Randyll Tarly:** If Randyll ever becomes a character that is deserving of a genuinely talented actor, my first choice would be [Peter Mullan](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0611932/), but chances are (unless he *really* comes into the fore in the books soon) he will end up being played by a cheap-but-solid stage actor and remain un-named in the show for as long as possible. 

**Wyman Manderly:** [Ian McNeice](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0573862/) is fucking brilliant, D&amp;D need to hire him and expand Manderly's role substantially. 

**Obara Sand:** This character is supposed to be over-thirty, yet the article regarding HBO's recent casting call has them listed as being between 18-25. So, if we're keeping the Sand Snakes young, how about either [Zawe Ashton](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1534698/?ref_=nv_sr_1) or [Lenora Crichlow](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1564072/) if they stay closer to her book age?

**Tyene Sand:** I'm thinking perhaps [Holliday Grainger](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0334441/) or [Emily Berrington](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4970834/?ref_=tt_cl_t16), assuming either aren't too much of a big deal to take what will probably be a small, low-paid role.

**Nymeria Sand:** Well, she's the second oldest after Obara, and is described similarly to her apart from being more classically beautiful in place of Obara's harder features. So, potentially she could be played by either of the actresses I suggested for Obara, but just to keep things fresh, what about [Mandeep Dhillon](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3778244/?ref_=tt_cl_t18)?

**Val:** Another character that I am assuming is very much on the bubble in terms of appearing in the show. Still, [Tamsin Egerton](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0989182/) seems like a no-brainer as far as this is concerned.

**Young Griff/Aegon:** I've not seen either acting, but based on looks alone, either [Mitch Hewer](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2356535/?ref_=tt_cl_t18) or [Max Pirkis](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1263986/) make sense to me. But again, this could go to any talented young actor who they can slap a wig on. Neither Emilia Clarke nor Harry Lloyd were blond, after all.

**Maggy the Frog:** [Janine Duvitski](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0245207/?ref_=tt_cl_t9). If you've seen This is Jinsy, you'll get me. 

Bonus (just for fun) - **Ser Shadrich:** [Lee Ingleby](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0408846/)

I haven't speculated upon ideas for Trystane as I believe any young, dusky actor could pull this off. He may even just be a native Spaniard, in case any of our Spanish contributors have any thoughts? Ditto Sand-Snakes, whilst we're at it.

Edit: Second bonus - **Ser Arys Oakheart:** [Tom Wisdom](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0936300/?ref_=tt_cl_t7)",15,6,False,self,,,,,

Tywin must bow so low because Tyrion is a dwarf not because he is superior. 
Tyrion is still a cat (Lannister lion) even though he is different. 
Tyrion can not fight like a regular Lannister but he still has claws to rival his fathers.

The main storylines that come to mind from AFFC &amp; ADWD are:

- Discovery of Tywin

- Brienne/Pod's adventure and their interaction with BWB/LS

- Tommen and Margaery getting married with added Cersei psychotic behaviour

- Dorne erupts over Oberyn's death

- Cersei's council &amp; stupid decisions including arming of the Faith Militant

- Jamie getting Riverrun's siege to end peacefully

- Arya in Braavos

- Samwell's journey to Oldtown

- Lord Commander Snow

- Ramsay's wedding 

- Stannis vs Bolton/Freys

- LS/BWB vs Freys

- Bran + Bloodraven

- Dany still remaining in Essos

- Jorah + Tyrion's escapades

- Sansa &amp; LF in the vale (Season 4 seems to cover a lot of AFFC stuff here)

- The Kingsmoot

- Loras at Dragonstone

- Mace at Storms End

- Euron at The Reach

- Trial by Faith

- Mandarley Pie

- Aegon

- Bran with Bloodraven + Children of The Forest

- Davos at Skagos

- Kevan getting killed.

Am I missing anything?  Seems to be too much for one season in my opinion.  What do you think?",16,4,False,self,,,,,

I was immediately hooked and watched the first 2 seasons with them and couldn't wait for season 3 to come out. After season 3 I decided to start reading the books. I read A Game of Thrones at a steady pace and moved on to A Clash of Kings when I finished it, but quickly become bored since I already knew the story from the show and quit reading...

Now that season 4 is underway I got the desire to pick the books back up and catch up. 2 days ago I got to the fight between the Oberyn and Gregor... I had to make the hard decision of whether I wanted to continue reading or stick with the show for the rest of season 4. I chose to keep reading because of the desire to find out what happens and also eliminate the chance of it being spoiled.

Last night I finished ASOS... wow. Many new exciting things happened/are starting to happen. I thought I was done with it, then I got to the epilogue... WOW. Unfortunately I've had a few things spoiled for me, and Catelyn's return was one of them (along with Tywin's death), but I had no idea when they would actually happen. I don't understand WHY people start talking to you/around you about things that happen later in the books when they know you haven't read them. It's happened so many times and is the biggest reason I've decided to read the books now.

Anyway, do you think we'll see Catelyn's return this season? It would be sooooo epic if at the very end the last scene made it look like it was ending, then it cuts to black for 5 seconds, then it slowly fades back in and we see Merrett riding a horse and it ends up playing out the epilogue like in the book and ends with that. It would totally blow everyone's minds that haven't read the books and getting to see the faces of my show-watcher-only friends would be priceless.

I'll be honest, season 3 and 4 have been a little boring to me. It's had its moments for sure, but the whole story has felt a bit stagnant. I feel like finally we're starting to see the movement that I've been craving. Jon's story crossing paths with Stannis, Littlefinger making his moves, Sansa finally leaving King's Landing, Arya getting on the ship to leave Westeros, Tywin's death implies some madness is going to ensue in the capital, Tyrion's story continuing where ever it will go from here, and more... shit's going down. Showing Zombie-Cat would really be the icing on the cake. ",7,0,False,default,,,,,

&gt;""You think I care about a cup of wine? Lancel is my *son*, Cersei. Your own nephew. If I am angry with you, that is the cause. You should have looked after him, guided him, found him a likely girl of good family. Instead you--""
""I know. I know"" *Lancel wanted me more than I ever wanted him. He still does, I will wager.* ""I was alone, weak. Please. Uncle."" (and it continues)

(Based on the show, not the books, since otherwise we're sort of comparing apples and oranges given the differences between the two)

The contenders:

**Jaime Lannister** (with both hands) - Youngest kingsguard ever, killed Jory pretty effortlessly before dueling fairly evenly with Ned, cut down a ton of Robb's men in battle before being captured, held his own with Brienne for a bit while weakened and out of practice (but lost eventually). 

**Brienne** - Beat Loras Tyrell in a tournament. Demolished three random bandit assholes while on the road with Jaime. Beat a weakened/chained Jaime. Fought a fucking bear for a bit and didn't immediately die. Now rocking a Valyrian steel sword and some sweet full plate.

**Sandor Clegane** - On several occasions (tending to involve Stark girls) has gone through a half dozen dudes like a fucking lawnmower. Went toe to toe with his massive brother and held his own. ""Killed"" Beric. Was straight up chopping dudes in half at the Blackwater before he deserted.

**Stannis** - First up the wall at Blackwater, kicking ass all the way. 

**Barristan** - Jaime hyped him as the greatest fighter he's ever seen, but we've never seen him in action. Does the old man still have it? Those Lannister men he intimidated when he stormed out of Joffrey's court seemed to think so.

**Ramsay** - When you show up to a deadly brawl with a bunch of Greyjoys, shirtless and covered in cuts, and proceed to lay waste while giggling like a schoolgirl, that says two things: you're fucking nuts, and you shouldn't be fucked with. On the other hands, have we really seen any proof that the Greyjoys just don't kinda suck? They seem to fuck up and lose at everything they do. We haven't seen Ramsay against a real challenge yet.

**The Mountain** - Is big as fuck. Exceptionally good at chopping random peasants and/or livestock to bits.

**Oberyn Martel** - Master of poisons, has a quick draw with a knife. We'll know a lot more about his skills tomorrow, but I'm betting they're impressive.

**Syrio Forel** - Took down 5 dudes with a stick. Alternatively, lost to Meryn fucking Trant. But still, 5 dudes with a stick is cool.

**Ned Stark** - Not much to go on, except he acquitted himself well in Robert's Rebellion, and held his own with Jaime prior to being stabbed in the leg.

**Robert** - The Uncle Rico of Westeros. ""Back in the day, I could throw this here hammer over them mountains."" Still, he did kill Rhaegar and win the throne, so he must have been able to back up the talk at some point.

**Khal Drogo** - A dude comes at him with a sword while he was unarmored and unarmed, and he toyed with him before ripping his tongue out. Give this dude some neosporin, and could anyone really take him down?

**Jorah, Grey Worm, and Daari**o - I'm lumping these guys together because they each share one notable feat, namely the time they singlehandedly entered a hostile city, killed dozens of men each, and won the city for Dany without taking any major wounds. 

**Jon Snow** - Somewhat tricky to gauge. Best in his class of trainees...who were peasant schmucks with no training, plus one neckbeard. Killed the halfhand and karl...but needed help to do it both times. Did kill a zombie and some random wildling assholes though, so there's that. Is he top tier though?

**Bronn** - King of dirty fighting, and not bad with a flaming arrow either.

**Karl** - A fooking legend.
