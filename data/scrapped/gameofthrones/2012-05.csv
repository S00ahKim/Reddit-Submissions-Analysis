The political game is a dangerous one where those who rule can win because of some arbitrary trait such as buying allies rather than making lasting coalitions (which is something a leader must be able to do). Honorable behavior selects for those traits that are best for a group as a whole and not just an individual.**

**-** Honor is nothing new, but talking about it is and not much academic work has been done on the subject. I have been conducting research on the evolutionary origins of Honor with my advisor while also learning about what it is. Watching/reading this series has been an excellent companion to learning about Honor and I wanted to start a discussion about it.

**-** I have seen a lot of derision about Ned's Honor: why didn't he just agree with Robert and kill Daeneryes? Why did he talk to Cersei about what he knew instead of taking hold of the Red Keep with Renly's help? To some those all seemed like poor decisions and in reality they really are. However, Honor is an important ethic and it only becomes undesireable when the people you work with do not abide by it's code.

**Honor**
**-** In the most basic sense Honor is a competition for status that is won and lost fairly; those high in status do not hold power over those low in status; and there are agreed upon rules that are followed by the competitors. Think of how the ideal sport progresses: A bunch of teams are paired up, they compete with one another in some set arena where the rules are followed and those that win do not dictate the lives of those who lost. The Vikings won't and don't want to tell the packers what to do with their lives.

**Evolution, Fitness, and Deer** **-** The research I am working on is a meta-analysis of non-human animal behavior and defense of why fair fights are advantageous for individuals. At its core, Honor allows those individuals with the best traits to suceed. If you and I are competing in an arm wrestling competition and I throw vinegar in your eyes, I may have defeated you, but we do't know who the better arm wrestler is. 

**-** Take Red Deer for example (I'm sure Stannis would approve); Male Red Deer compete with each other for access to a harem of females. Those individuals with high status gain access to some sexytimes with the females. Status is won or lost through combat and this combat is all about the antlers. Two males will pair up and run at one another, rarely do you see an individual sneak up on another and ram him from behind or a group of ow status stags attack a high status stag. There are some reasons for this, but I won't get into them. This behavior is reinforced by sexual selection, females are choosey and desire those individuals with large antlers or high status.

**Poor Ned** **-** Abstract this to Eddard Stark's Honor. He will not kill a child (Daeneryes) because she is (1) not a worthy competitor and (2) not part of the Game being played. She does not partake in the rules; it would be as if a defensive lineman tackled a referee or fan in the stands, they have not agreed to play with him and are not honorable opponents. Honor relies on reciprocation, if Ned killed the child it would set a precedent. It would set him up as a player of a different Game, one of a more Machivelian and political nature.

**-** The political game is a dangerous one where those who rule can win because of some arbitrary trait such as buying allies rather than making lasting coalitions (which is something a leader must be able to do). Honorable behavior selects for those traits that are best for a group as a whole and not just an individual.

**-** Well I have more papers to write, but if anyone finds this interesting I can fill in some holes that I missed or more importantly join a discussion! ASOIAF is one of my favorite series and to see Honor played out so well makes me overly excited.",4,3,False,self,,,,,

A LOT.  The map alone over the credits is a brilliant innovation. The casting is fantastic annd it's pulling off a nigh impossible feat by getting this epic story on screen at all. I know they are rushed and cramped into ten episodes. I get it. But sometimes... ugh. 

Some examples:
 
* First episode - constant references to characters yet to be introduced in an nigh-impossible to follow way. 
* Season 1 - long scene of Baelish and Varys just walking in a circle verbally sparring with each other. It went on and on.  Only ten episodes and yet they fill time with this. 

* Season 2 (which is fresher in my mind) - Repeated tropes. The teaching sex scene in the brothel from series 1 shows up again before the baby scene. The world's first ever Teaching Brothel. 9_9

* ridiculous sex watching sex watching sex scene. I know it's HBO but if you wanted to make tales from the brothel just shut down production and go to the San Fernando valley.  

* Last night post Renly - two scenes in a row with ""you can't avenge him if you're dead"" dialogue. Relevant to the characters? Yes. But come on. You know these scenes will happen back to back. Mix them up or do something clever. Just so clumsy. 

* Tyrion threatening the young Lannister with the same threat he did the week before, artlessly. Why? For those that missed it last week? We know why he's cooperating. A glance is enough. It doesn't need yet more exposition. 

BTW I'm a fan and critic of the books. I've read them. I'm a fan and critic of the series. I've watched them. This isn't a ""the books are soooo much better"" post. There's lots George R.R. Martin does that makes them amazing and some he does that's facepalm worthy.

So, we've finally hit the midway point in season 2...

My perspective as a reader is that we've finally hit the point in the books where the story finally begins. I've been waiting for the mid-point of season 2 for such a long time. All I can say to non-readers is... get ready! If the TV show behaves anything like the books, *every* episode from here **until the end of season 4** will be *better* than the last. No, that's not hyperbole.

As some background for non-readers who are unaware: A Storm of Swords is really the 'meat and potatoes' of the book series. The books were originally intended to be written as two acts of a saga, with the first act ending at the end of ASOS. GRRM actually never intended to even write A Feast for Crows or A Dance with Dragons, but instead he had planned to skip 5 years ahead in time and explain the 5 years of events in the past tense. He scrapped that idea and wrote the books instead to fill the gap (which is partially why the books took so long to be released and why some consider these books disappointing as the core events in the series were not planned for these books).

IMO 'A Game of Thrones' was primarily an exposition book setting the scene for the events about to unfold. After having watched season 1 about a dozen times it's amazing catching so many subtle things that become important later without you knowing it. Additionally, the first half of 'A Clash of Kings' was largely the same thing: set-up. I actually found the first half of 'A Clash of Kings' to be the most boring part of the entire series (sans a certain character in ADWD). To think that we have gotten through that first 50% of the TV series with not a hint of pullback or receded anticipation is HUGE. I've always measured a show by it's weakest point because that's where you will lose viewers... if you can get them through that, you earn a permanent fan. 

I now see a lot of permanent fans because there is no way anyone watching will be able to miss another episode for at least 2.5 years. It really does get THAT good. It took 1.5 seasons to get there, but the heart of this epic has just begun. Strap on your seatbelts ladies and gentlemen, the Game has just begun!",141,110,False,self,,,,,

Mistake or intentional change?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/t1zwp/s02e01_question_mistake_or_intentional_change/,whynotdan,1335902353,"I'm reading and watching a few episodes behind what is airing on HBO.  I'm on pg. 376 of ACoK, and I've watched the first 2 or 3 episodes of season 2, so no spoilers for me please, but...

When I watched episode 1, I noticed the quote from one of Craster's wives, ""This is our place, our husband keeps us safe.  Better to live free than die a slave."" (around the 25:00 mark of the episode)

It stood out because it doesn't make sense, or rather, it's obvious, wouldn't anyone rather live free instead of dying as a slave.  I thought it would have made more sense the other way, dying free vs. living as a slave.

Then I read the quote in ACoK, ""This is our place.  Craster keeps us safe.  Better to die free than live a slave."" (pg. 361)

So, what's the deal?  It seems like an odd place for HBO, or the director/writers to change dialogue, especially when it changes the meaning.  It also seems like a pretty obvious mistake, if it was, very hard to overlook.

Anyway, what are your thoughts?

(X-posted from r/asoiaf)",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/t2asr/spoilers_got_acok_asos_what_prophecies_do_you/,heyrey,1335913722,"From pages 700-707 of ACOK:

&gt;*In one room, a beautiful woman sprawled naked on the floor while four little men crawled over her...One was pumping between her thighs. Another savaged her breasts, worrying at the nipples with his red wet mouth, tearing and chewing.*

- They'll include it. It's HBO, why leave out an opportunity for gratuitous boobs? I wonder if they'll make the four little men look like  caricatures of the four kings battling over Westeros.

&gt;*Farther on she came upon a feast of corpses. Savagely slaughtered, the feasters lay strewn across overturned chairs and hacked trestle tables, asprawl in pools of congealing blood. Some had lost limbs, even heads. Savaged limbs clutched bloody cups, wooden spoons, roast fowl, heels of bread. On a throne above them sat a dead man with the head of a wolf. He wore an iron crown and held a leg of lamb in one hand as a king might hold a scepter, and his eyes followed Dany with mute appeal.*

- Not sure. On the show, the direwolves are quite visually identifiable from one another. Will HBO be giving away too much by showing Grey Wind's head in this scene? Won't viewers easily put two and two together? HBO is building up Robb's character a lot more than the books did, in part to make his inevitable death scene that much more shocking. How can they handle depicting this prophecy without giving away the surprise?

&gt;*I know this room, she thought. She remembered those great wooden beams and the carved animal faces that adorned them. And there outside the window, a lemon tree!*

- Won't include. HBO never explored Dany's time in the house of Ser Willem Darry.

&gt;*Beyond loomed a cavernous stone hall, the largest she had seen. The skulls of dead dragons looked down from its walls.Upon a towering barbed throne sat an old man in rich robes, an old man with dark eyes and long silver-gray hair. Let him be king over charred bones and cooked meat, he said to a man below him. Let him be the king of ashes.*

- They'll include it. This will make a really cool visual, and they've laid a foundation for crazy old Aerys' propensity to burn things.

&gt;*The man had her brothers hair, but he was taller, and his eyes were a dark indigo rather than lilac. Aegon, he said to a woman nursing a newborn babe in a great wooden bed. What better name for a king?*

- If they've casted Rhaegar, then they'll include it. If not, then probably not.

&gt;*He has a song, the man replied. He is the prince that was promised, and his is the song of ice and fire. He looked up when he said it and his eyes met Dany, and it seemed as if he saw her standing there beyond the door. There must be one more, he said, though whether he was speaking to her or the woman in bed she could not say. The dragon has three heads.*

- A chilling line.  I really feel this should be included, but again, if they haven't picked a Rhaegar then I don't see this happening.

&gt;*...mother of dragons...child of three...three heads has the dragon...mother of dragons...child of storm...three fires must you light...one for life and one for death and one to love...three mounts must you ride...one to bed and one to dread and one to love.....three treasons will you know...once for blood and once for gold and once for love...*

- They'll include it, but with modified dialogue. 

&gt;*Viserys screamed as the molten gold ran down his cheeks and into his mouth. A tall lord with copper-gold skin and silvery hair stood beneath the banner of a fiery stallion, a burning city behind him. Rubies flew like drops of blood from the chest of a dying prince, and he sank to his knees in the water and with his last breath murmured a womans name...mother of dragons...daughter of death...*

- They'll definitely include Viserys' coronation, but I'm not sure if they will include the vision of alternate-universe Rhaego. I guess it depends on HBO's faith in viewers being able to make the connection that this is a future that will never be.

&gt;*Glowing like sunset, a red sword was raised in the hand of a blue-eyed king who cast no shadow. A cloth dragon swayed on poles amid a cheering crowd. From a stone tower, a great stone beast took wing, breathing shadow fire...mother of dragons...slayer of lies...*

- I think HBO will judge this as too cryptic and leave it out. Personally, I feel it sets up important foreshadowing for Dany exposing that Stannis isn't Azor Ahai or that Aegon is the mummer's dragon, but HBO can show this foreshadowing with other plot devices. 

&gt;*Her silver was trotting through the grass, to a darkling stream beneath a sea of stars. A corpse stood at the prow of a ship, eyes bright on his dead face, gray lips smiling sadly. A blue flower grew from a chink in a wall of ice, and filled the air with sweetness...mother of dragons...bride of death...*

- I feel like they won't include this. HBO dropped the blue-flower reference to Lyanna/possibly Jon Sow in season 1, and I don't think they will bring it up for the first time in season 2.

&gt;*Shadows whirled and danced inside a tent, boneless and terrible.*

- Include, when they are showing the visions from Dany's past.

&gt;*A little girl ran barefoot toward a big house with a red door.*

- Again, they never laid the foundation for her time with Willem Darry, so they won't include it.

&gt;*Mirri Maz Duur shrieked in the flames, a dragon bursting from her brow.*

- This is a cool visual. I hope they include it.

&gt;*Behind a silver horse the bloody corpse of a man bounced and dragged.*

- I think it won't be included, because I don't remember HBO showing this as the merchant's fate in season 1, but [perfectm](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/t29fm/spoilers_got_acok_asos_what_prophecies_do_you/c4ixbz3) remembers that scene being included.

&gt;*A white lion ran through grass taller than a man.*

- Won't include. Too obscure.

&gt;*Beneath the Mother of Mountains, a line of naked crones crept from a great lake and knelt shivering before her, gray heads bowed.*

- Won't include, never laid the foundation for the dosh khaleen in Game of Thrones.

&gt;*Ten thousand slaves lifted bloodstained hands as she raced by on her silver, riding like the wind. Mother! they cried. Mother, Mother!*

- Include, foreshadowing for Yunkai.

So what do all of you think?

Additional question: It seemed like it took effort for Drogon to puff enough fire to char a tiny cube of meat... how is he supposed to burn down the House of the Undying?

http://imgur.com/a/0Sf26

I thought it turned out pretty nicely and thought I would offer the same to anybody in /r/gameofthrones who would like a custom shield.

If you'd like to see more examples, I have done most of the main ASOIAF houses on my [zazzle account](http://www.zazzle.com/astoreoficeandfire*).

If you want a shield, please reply here with:

* primary color of shield
* any other shield color elements (a different colored chevron, striping, bendy, quartered/halved, etc)
* design (animal, flower, etc) depicted on shield
* house name
* motto

If you just have a general idea of what you want and wish to leave the designing of it up to me, that is fine too, just let me know!

I'll try to get most requests done within 24 hours, depending on how many people take me up on this.  I'll reply with an imgur link to the file!

**EDIT**: accidentally a word

**EDIT 2**: If you want to get a product made of your new sigil, let me know and I'll upload the full rez file to zazzle and then you can add the design to any product you want (mugs, posters, mousepads, whatever).

**UPDATE**:  ~~It is 2 am and I must be up at 6, so I am going to call a pause and head to bed-- I will return to work on these again tomorrow evening after I get home from work!~~  I'm working on them now!  Please continue to make requests, I will get to them as soon as I can.

I love that in the scene when Robert is dying, Joffrey was there and held his hand, and looked very upset. I couldn't believe that Robert didn't call his children to him in the book. Wouldn't that be your first desire if you were dying? To see your kids?

I would like all of you, readers, to post your observations and suggestions. Let me start with the most obvious ones. Unlike most of the other redditors here, I don't urge you non-readers to read the books - you have the right to enjoy the show as it is. I just think you might enjoy it more if you get some information that you've missed.

* Everybody is younger in the books. That's more like in medieval times. Why not in TV show? Daenerys is 13 at the beginning of AGoT, 14 when she gives birth. I think that pretty much sums it up. GRRM initially planned to throw a five-year gap and now he states that the characters should have been older from the very beginning. TV series fixed that for him.

* Book 1 contains various hints about Jon Snow's mother that the TV show fails to deliver in such amount (although first two episodes contain some). This is because most of those hints occur in Ned's thoughts and memories. It's quite subtle and easy to miss (like most of trivia of this kind; I've even missed the common family name and sigil of Dany's advisor and the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch). If you want to know the answer, google ""Jon Snow's parentage"".
Update: libbykino pointed out that a major hint (yet still subtle) about Jon Snow's mother is probably going to be mentioned in episode 7. I'm going to leave that for a while.

* **Theon Greyjoy** is not a PoV (point of view) character in A Game of Thrones, his point of view appears in A Clash of Kings. Book fans didn't bother, knowing he will play a role after season 1. Ros, though, doesn't even exist in the books, hence all the initial scepticism about brothel scenes with her. ACoK contained much more interesting prostitutes with actual character and storyline (actual intrigues instead of getting beaten with royal scepter). It turns out that, as few people mentioned, Ros actually serves a certain purpose (characters more likely to open up and say their thoughts).

* The official religion of Westeros is the **church of the Seven**. The Faith's god is a single deity made of seven aspects: Father, Warrior, Smith, Mother, Maiden, Crone and Stranger. Seven-pointed star seen on the robes of the silent sisters (coroners dedicated to Stranger, aspect of death, seen on the battlefield in S02E04) is the symbol of this religion. Sept (temple) of Baelor, before which Ned has been [TV spoiler](/s ""beheaded""), is named after Baelor I Targaryen, called Baelor the Blessed. Septons (priests of the Seven) will make further appereances.

* **Maesters**, like Luwin, Pycelle, Aemon and Cressen, aren't officially related to the Faith, but they support it (you'll find out later why). It's an order of scholars - physicians and astronomers. Their residence is the Citadel in the Oldtown, southwest of Highgarden (the Reach: south of Casterly Rock, west of Stormlands).

* **Melisandre of Asshai** isn't the first red priest mentioned in the books. The first one was Thoros of Myr, famous for using a flaming sword in the tournaments (his name was already mentioned in the show). His sword is mentioned by Tyrion while visiting the pyromancers guild - Tyrion realises that the flaming sword was just a regular sword covered in wildfire.
Quaithe, the masked woman from Qarth, is a shadowbinder like Melisandre. In the books, she addresses her warnings to Daenerys herself.

* Melisandre responded to Davos's ""Gods help us"" with ""There is only one god"". That's different from the books: Seven are one being, and Melisandre claims **there are two gods**: R'hllor (Lord of Light, associated with fire, life and dragons) and the god who shall not be named (the Great Other, associated with ice, death and the White Walkers). Red God mentioned by Jaqen is most likely R'hllor, but the connection between these two perceptions of religion is yet to be revealed.

* **Renly's sexuality isn't revealed that straight ;) it the books**, only hinted (his brother asking if Margaery is still a virgin and such), blatant jokes like those made by soldiers and Littlefinger not happening at all until his death. The show gave him much more focus, thanks to what he doesn't jump out of nowehere like Stannis. Two major things missing in the show are: the famous peach scene, when Stannis pulls out his sword thinking Renly is about to pull his, only to find out he was just reaching for a peach (instead, we got the ham joke) and Renly's fancy dressing habit, revealed in his armour and the theme of his Kingsguard - the Rainbow Guard. Brienne was the Blue.

* **Stannis Baratheon has a daughter** - ill and ugly. As a response to Stannnis pamphlet about Joffrey's parentage, Lannisters start a rumor that she was fathered by Stannis's jester (who's plain crazy). His sexual relationship with Melisandre was barely implied and his wife, Lord of Light's devout, was around all the time at Dragonstone.

* Most important fact missing in the show is about **Renly's army**. The show implies that almost all of it went under control of Stannis, but it's untrue. Renly's army consisted mostly of lords of the Reach, sworn to Tyrells, and then lords of the Stormlands, sworn to Baratheons.

* Ned and Robert grew up together in Eyrie and **Stannis is jealous of Ned** because Robert loved his friend more than his own brother. Stannis considered his host over Dragonstone, the family stronghold of Targaryen, as a kind of exile (Robert was angry at him for failing to chase Viserys and Daenerys), Storm's End being his rightful property (which he defended with great effort until Ned broke the siege).

* Oh, and **Littlefinger wasn't supposed to meet Tyrells** until Renly's death. His scene with Catelyn wasn't in the books either, but it worked out really well and noone complains. Maybe the thing that he lied about Arya was quite odd, but whatever. The scene with Margaery showed some story development unseen in the books, but, more important, developed lady Tyrell's character in a way we couldn't even hope for. Book Margaery appears young and dull in comparison to her TV self.

* **Harrenhal sequence as a whole was way different** - Arya wasn't ""rescued"" and made cupbearer by Tywin, but sent to the kitchens from the start, no Tywin whatsoever. TV show did a great job so far, though, never enough of Charles Dance on the screen. Book fans may be pissed right now because they don't know who's about to die - two of the original three targets are missing from the show. I think that makes it just more interesting.

* **Robb Stark isn't a PoV character!** You didn't see that coming, did you? In the books, we see his whole story through the eyes of his mother. But that would mean no Robb for five episodes, and that's something we couldn't bear... or could we?
In fact, none of the kings is a PoV character. We see Stannis as Davos sees him, Renly appears only in Catelyn's chapters. Same for Robert back in AGoT and Joffrey, ever.

* The story about Sandor Clegane's burning scars was told to Sansa by the Hound himself when he was drunk. Here's a masterpiece from casting: [Audition Tape](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIWX2fPx-5k). During the scene of stripping and beating Sansa he attempts to stop the fellow Kingsguard. Some people told me to add this, but I think handing her his cloak was enough, some Sansa-Sandor scenes are coming next episode anyway.

* Catelyn Stark and Lysa Arryn are from House Tully, lords of the Trident (Riverlands, south of the Twins). Riverrun, home to the Tullys, is the place where Robb is keeping Jaime in the books. He doesn't trust his bannermen, but he trusts his uncle and his grandfather. We're most probably going to see those guys in season 3.

* The show has lost it a some point, but in King's Landing everybody still refers to the king as ""Joffrey Baratheon"". Strange, huh? His coat of arms is stag and lion, as Renly took the stag and Stannis set it on fire.

* **Bran's story in Winterfell was more interesting** in the books - he was there with two Frey boys (maybe you forgot, but Robb is supposed to marry one of the Frey girls) and also Jojen and Meera Reeds, children of one of lesser Northern lords (Freys - jerks, Reeds - awesome). Due to annoying Frey hosts, their story wasn't good enough, so it got cut down (as many other) in cast.

* There are minor differences in Daenerys storyline since the very beginning. Most lately, it's the death of her horse (instead, it was her handmaiden) and one of her bloodriders (guy got a role in Brad Pitt's movie). The most important note here should have been the first sexual intercourse between Dany and Drogo - it was quite romantic and gentle in the books. HBO turned it into a rape scene to emphasize Dany's develompent, but in the end of first season the line from the book ""Do you remember our first ride, my sun and stars"" sounds a LOT awkward.

* Last but not least, the Night's Watch. The storyline there is quite accurate, of course some minor cuts involved, like skipping first chapter featuring empty vilages mentioned in episode 2. Nothing of any importance. 10000gildedcranes already mentioned that Fist of the First Men was forested area. That's a detail that has its meaning, this way it's definitely more ""northern"" than Craster's hut site.

It can be figured out quite easily from reading the books and watching the show. Although George RR Martin has been known to throw in some curve balls, so maybe I'm wrong but this all makes complete sense and it ties the series up nicely...

[speculation](/g ""So here goes... Gendry is actually Robert Baratheon's true born heir. This is given credence when Cersei tells Catelyn that she and Robert lost a child (which she presumably had killed, but someone switched the child, like Jon did with Mance's child). So Gendry is at some point going to find indisputable proof that he is the true born heir to the Iron Throne which will force Stannis to side with him since the only reason Stannis claimed the throne is because Robert had no true born heir. Second, Arya is going to grow up to return to Westeros on her killing spree and meet Gendry again and they're going to be married and will rally the north against Stannis (or perhaps Daenerys). Thirdly, Sansa is going to marry that boy from the riverlands and become their new lady, creating an alliance between the riverlands and the north (now controlled by Gendry and Arya). At the same time, Daenerys is going to unite with Aegon and John Connington and raise the banners of Dorne. She will take King's Landing and the final conflict will happen between her and the Starks (and Gendry), but it will likely end in peaceful negotiations. I'm just guessing here not based on any facts from the books, but I would wager that Daenerys is going to feel disillusioned after taking King's Landing and decide that she doesn't want to rule Westeros. She's going to give the iron throne to Gendry and return to the east free the 'Free Cities' and rule there."")

I'm a first-time reader of ASOIAF and I'm willing to do a write-up of my experience reading the books if you all are interested. However, since you guys are the ones who will be reading this, I want to make it as enjoyable as possible for you all. To that effect, I want you guys to tell me how I should write this! 

First of all, **is anyone actually going to read this?** I'm not going to clutter up a subreddit with my drivel unless I know someone out there's enjoying it. 

Also, how would you like me to post this? I can probably either edit one post with updates as I read more, or I can post new links once every week or so with updates. Thoughts? Is there any other (better) way I can do this? 

Furthermore, would you guys like me to do a chapter-by-chapter write-up (then compile a certain number of chapter reviews and post it) or do you want me to do a super-long review of the whole book after I finish reading it? I'm leaning towards the chapter system personally, just because my reactions would be more fresh in my mind, but you guys are the ones who are gonna read it, so tell me what you want.

All right, if there's anything else you want me to do with this write-up, just let me know in this post so I can get everything figured out before I start actually writing my reactions. Also, I've already finished AGOT and ACOK, and I'm about 14% into ASOS right now. I could do a retroactive review of the previous two books if you want, or I could just dive right into ASOS. Your choice. 

If anyone wants me to do this, and has ideas for me, let me know in the comments. Thanks!

I thought it'd be good to see who you'd all pick to play some of the iconic roles we'll see from ASOS. Such as:

**The North**
Reek (aka Ramsay Bolton),
Jojen Reed,
Meera Reed.

**Riverlands**
Edmure Tully,
Hoster Tully,
Brynden Blackfish Tully,
Beric Dondarrion,
Thoros of Myr,
Vargo Hoat

**Kings Landing**
Mace Tyrell,
Ollena Tyrell,
Osmund Kettleblack,
Osfryd Kettleblack,
Osney Kettleblack,
Oberyn Martell

**Beyond the Wall**
Mance Rayder,
Dalla,
Val,
Tormund Giantsbane,
Styr, Magnar of Thenn

Personally, I feel that Jojen and Meera may be omitted entirely, as it seems as though Osha is going to fulfil their role, which would pave the way for her to travel to the Wall with Bran, Hodor, and consequently Rickon, leaving them to travel beyond the wall with Coldhands. It'd also explain why Osha and Rickon end up where they do in ADWD, [mild ADWD spoilers](/b ""as that certain location is far closer to the wall than their initial destination of White Harbor"")

I noticed the other day when looking at the [game of thrones map](http://gameofthrones.net/images/Westeros_Maps/Map_Westeros_Political.gif), it bears some resemblance to a [map of the United Kingdom](http://www.turkey-visit.com/map/United-Kingdom/england_map.JPG). There are obvious differences, but the similarities got me to thinking about the similarities in the cultures as well. The North sees itself as somewhat independent, or at least it seeks its own independence.  Scotland is similar in this way, Northerners with pride in their own way of living, some of whom seek independence. Then there is the monarchy in Kings Landing, very similar to the monarchy in Great Britain, at least back when a King was the actual ruling power of Great Britain. Then the Dothraki and other easterners have a culture that is reminiscent of middle eastern cultures, like Persia or the deserts of Egypt, etc.

That's why they won't handle it like that. IMO the book has it set up perfectly so that nothing needs to be changed.

Forget the morning commute, the busy streets, the honking horns.

I don't care about a lower life expectancy, I would, without thinking twice for half a second, trade my life for this time period back to the Medieval era.

I don't care if I was lucky to bathe once a week, or had to throw poop on the street, or more likely to contract some kind of disease.

Walking around places like the Renaissance festival is just absolutely inspiring. I've never felt more alive than I did every year that I've visited this festival. Going back to my car after such an epic day is the biggest disappointment in the world at that particular time.

Reading books like GoT is so grasping for me that I hate putting it down, not only because it's a good story, but sometimes I just wish I could be a character.

Watching shows like GoT, I have to envy the actors as having the job that I would want to do the most in this world. I'm not an actor, and I'm not sure I'd even be a good one, but to have that once in a lifetime experience that the cast gets to have, is certainly nothing to boot.

Playing games that revolve around the Medieval era and have an immersive RPG factor are hard to put down as well.

If I could get paid half as much as I do now, or hell, just barely enough to support my family and I, I'd instantly take a career in something where I could feel part of anything to do with the Medieval era, whether it be designing, participating in, helping, etc.

I truly cannot imagine someone more wonderful in that part. Plus, he's pretty, but not *as* pretty as Jamie, but resembles him subtly. It's all so perfect.

I think an honorable mention would go to the actress who plays Irri. She plays the Dothraki female very well... I think it is harder in many ways to play the ""savage"" woman than it is to play the man. She doesn't have the outright violence the men have, but she still plays it fantastically.

A lot of the talk on this subreddit has to do with differences between perceptions of characters from the novels versus actors' portrayals, but what about those of us who came into the series cold? 

For me, besides the obvious (who doesn't love Maisie Williams and Peter Dinklage) I think Jack Gleeson (Joffrey) and Mark Addy (Robert) have been great. It seems like a lot of the novel readers thought that character was too different from the books, but I thought he nailed that role. The dialog with Cersei was one of my favorite scenes in season 1.

Honorable mention to two actors who haven't had a ton of screen time yet but I'm looking forward to seeing more of: Stephen Dillane as Stannis and Isaac Hempstead-Wright as Bran. Bran is a character without any really strong personality traits but Wright has made him his own, outstanding work for a child actor.

The actor that stands out to me the most on the negative side is Aidan Gillen (Littlefinger). Not that he's a bad actor, but somehow I just don't *buy* him in that role. He doesn't seem especially subtle, and I can't really see him as a super-pimp either.

I was just wondering if anyone knows why Daenerys hasn't named the dragons yet in the show. As I recall in the book she gave them their names before even getting to Qarth.

Have I missed it or hasn't she named them yet?

Some characters on screen look far different from how I imagined they would be portrayed based on their characters in the book.

The images of the Season 1 characters was ingrained in my head as I was reading the first book, so I couldn't conjure much in the way of per-concieved notions for them.  The only exception may be Tyrion, Peter Dinklage is not quite the imp I imagined, feeling the book tries to emphasize that he is supposed to be grotesquely malformed (Not that Peter Dinklage wasn't an incredible casting choice he does an incredible job!)

But other characters from the second book I didn't have those actors to build my images around --

Theon's Sister -- I imagined someone more lithe and limber, looking like an acrobat on the high seas.

Halfhand -- I imagined someone like the old bear, only way more grizzled and wild, in my head he had a long ponytail and a full beard. 

Melisandre -- actually just about spot on to what I imagined.

Craster -- WAAYYYYY too clean cut in the TV series, he really should have been full on barbarian mode.

Jaqen, Biter, Rorge -- Jaqen looks pretty spot on, but Rorge and Biter are not as ghoulish looking as I imagined, and Rorge certainly needs to be missing more nose.

Davos -- I expected him to be a little younger, a little more swashbuckling rogue-ish, I can't help but imagine him with something like a tri-corner hat

For instance, Catelyn and Lady Stoneheart. She is clearly going to be dead after the Wedding to everyone, you can't get much deader than having your throat slit and thrown into the river with the corpses for miles. And yet the actress will pop up.

Another one that will be interesting is with Mance, who gets burned to death, but then totally doesn't. With the casting done and the contracts out there for duration, as well as people constantly checking imdb, how will they be able to keep people surprised without using flashbacks or something to justify having the actors? Some of the flashbacks could be obvious, the first time Ned brings home Jon, etc.

Either they could write it into the show or rush the whole Bran storyline so that he could be looking back at the events to have it be flash backs in that way. But either way, seasons 3 and 4 are going to be very spoilery if they don't establish some form of reusing dead characters that isn't bringing them back from the dead.

Anyone else have better thoughts on how they might deal with this? It also includes having their names in the starting credits, which is the real thing to worry about since everyone sees those even if they are distancing themselves from everywhere else to try not to be spoiled.

EDIT: Unspoiler tagged, because there is clear warning.

I'm not terribly far in yet, but I have to say one quick thing:

Holy shit. This book is fucking amazing. 

I was so averse to picking this book series up because of how confusing the TV show is and I'd been told that the number of characters and names to remember in the books makes the TV show look juvenile. Even with faces to put to names I'm lost half the time when they start throwing around names. I have to get on here and read the recap threads to understand the relationships and who's talking about whom. And that was the first season. With the war going on and a new face (or 12) being thrown in every other episode, I have no clue who's who or who's related/fucking/hates/blood sworn/etc to whom. Granted, I haven't started the war yet, so the character list is pretty small. However, I'm having no trouble remembering everyone and their allegiances and lineages. 

Also, a lot of the characters make so much more sense even after making it through a quarter of the first book. After several comments about my flippancy regarding spoilers in the previous post, the rest will be tagged. [General Spoiler](/b ""The families and their allegiances are a lot more clear, and the relationship between Dany and Viserys Targaryen, always a source of confusion and unease, makes sense and is even more unsettling than I had originally thought. I always understood they were brother and sister (duh), but either I missed it or the backstory that Targaryen marries Targaryen was omitted. Also, the foreshadowing of the antlers in the direwolf carcass is significantly more played out in the book, giving a great sense of tension and coming dread every time the Lannisters are around the Starks that I don't remember being present in the book"")

There are other, littler things that make more sense, but those are just the big ones. I'm looking forward to continuing this series and so excited I have the next two days off work to sit around and get to know the houses of the Seven Kingdoms better. 

Just wanted to share my reignited excitement for this series after my apathy/confusion for the last few weeks of the show. 

Cheers, redditors.

Robb - Oldest child; Grey Wind - Biggest wolf in the litter. 

Jon - The bastard child, technically not a Stark; Ghost - The albino wolf, was also shunned away from the other litter. 

Sansa - Currently getting punished for something her father did; Lady - Got punished for Nymeria's actions. 

Arya - Impulsives, on the run; Nymeria - Also impulsive; also on the run. 

Rickon - Doesn't get paid much attention, the wild child; Shaggydog - Currently chained up, also the vicious one of the litter.

Lanisters, live for their family name, fetish incest.

Ned Stark, family, honor and faithful. stays with the woman hes married, dosnt sleep around (sort of)

Tyrion Lannister. a man of the people but enjoys the pleasures in life. sleeps with the common prostitutes, some might say over zealously to make up for his size.

Daenerys. her sex story is more to do with her transformation from a helpless girl (getting drilled from behind) to taking control and becoming a leader (getting on top).

Jon Snow. pure moral code, understanding and compassionate. celibate.

Prince/King Joffrey. ruthless, selfish and  power mad. fetish Sadism.

Original King (forgot name). glutinous, greedy. sleeps with everything (proven when all the suspected bastards of the king were sentenced to death.)

The Eunuch. no one trusts eunuchs, their character isnt shown and their goals are unknown. a mystery.

so pay attention to the sex in the show and you'll be surprised what you learn about your favorite characters.",16,0,False,self,,,,,

Basically, I'm wanting to know what you think the surname for a bastard born in your, or any, state in the US would be.

For example, for Florida, maybe something like Jon Citrus or Mya Sunburn.

Feel free to do some for a major city, like, maybe Jon Towers, for NYC.  If you do a city though, please suggest something for the state it's in as a whole as well.

If you think of some stuff for regions of the country instead of specific states, that's fine too.


If it gets enough interest and submissions, I want to make a Bastard USA map, or have someone do one for me.

Oh, and please, don't just do insulting ones, like Jon Redneck for WV or something like that.  (Just an example WV.. of what not to do)

Sorry if someone has already posted something like this.  I DID search before posting, but not very hard...***EDIT:  Crap, I meant to put this in when I made the post, but forgot,  luckily, people are doing it anyway:  feel free to submit surnames for countries/areas/whatever outside the US as well.",157,39,False,self,,,,,

http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/ta47n/a_bromance_for_the_ages_taken_from_the_tumblr/

Above are links to both submissions. I was keeping an eye on both of them to see how they were faring with the community, and I noticed that the second one linked (Bromance) stopped receiving any votes soon after I submitted it. I wasn't sure what was wrong, but figured that maybe people had stopped voting on it because there was already a similar post on the front page of the subreddit. 

However, shortly after this, I noticed that the first one (the Arya post) also stopped receiving votes. I waited for a while, but it stayed resolutely stuck on the same number of up/downvotes.  Unsure what might have happened, I then looked through the hot/new/rising pages for the subreddit, and found no trace of either of these posts anywhere.

Thus, I can only conclude that despite there having been no complaints that I'm aware of, and no breach of the content rules of this subreddit, two perfectly valid posts were removed without warning or reason being given.

I feel that this behaviour from the mods is unacceptable, and would like to be given a valid reason for the removal of both posts removal, or else see them re-instated.

Also, going forward I would like to see a more transparent process implemented regarding the flagging and removal of posts, as currently there doesn't seem to be any room to appeal unless you notice your post has gone missing and message the moderators yourself (which I have also done and am awaiting a response on).",1,0,False,default,,,,,

As a proud 'filthy casual' viewer of the series, I love coming on here each week and reading not only other viewers' opinions about the show, but reading the discussion of how the books are being adapted to the show, creative decisions that get made, etc.

For instance, Tywin is quite likeable in the show. Sure, he dislikes Tyrion (which sort of turns the viewer against him, as Tyrion is very likeable and you sort of root for him as a series-only viewer), and he's in some ways the 'bad guy' in terms of his archetypal character traits (a little firm, etc). However, reading the discussion on this subreddit and mousing over book spoilers gives a lot of backstory or depth in the development of these characters, as well as an insight into the production of the show itself: the general consensus is that he's more likeable in the show than in the books. Fantastic discussion that is difficult to find any where else on the web.

This is interesting, plot-driven *discussion*, and then there are just *spoilers*. Obviously it's a bit of a mine field to navigate those 'book spoilers' as a series-only viewer, as the general plot of the show is mapped out already through season 5 / 6, but still, there's a big difference between:

'ACoK spoiler : Tyrion really seems more likeable, partially because they left out him killing that guard for no reason'   

versus

'ACoK spoiler: IT'S TOO BAD HE'S ABOUT TO DIE NEXT EPISODE'  

Now, those spoilers were completely made up -- and it's pretty evident that George R R Martin doesn't mind killing off any (every?) character in the show, so the fact that someone dies or not is relatively unimportant...but one spoiler is *discussion driven*, and the other is simply a meaningless spoiler. 

It's very interesting to read discussions of the show with minor spoilers thrown in here and there, but it'd be awesome if the highly intelligent master race of book readers could avoid from any 'snape kills dumbledore'-type 'spoilers for the sake of spoilers'. 

Of course this is just my opinion and I may be out of line, but eh was worth a shot :)",80,61,False,self,,,,,

Is it just for entertainment? or do they feel that this makes the show better?
Examples:
-Robb Stark and the Valaryian girl..wtf who is she. He's not supposed to get a women until later on and she is supposed to be high born. 
-Since when was Arya Lord Tywins cup bearer? and try to steal messages?
-The Theon Winterfell part was flawless, but Sir Rodrick wasnt supposed to die? He is responsable for the Bolton Bastard fight.
-Danny- WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU HAVE SOMEONE STEAL HER DRAGONS AND KILL HER PEOPLE??? BAD HBO...VERY VERY BAD!!!!!!!!!
Jon Snow- Ygritte is very well played but Jon doesnt steal her and then get lost in the wild with her. How is he going to find the Halfhand and when will he kill him? He was just supposed to let her go. 

These are my complaints, someone explain why HBO thought this would be better then the original story line ",5,0,False,self,,,,,

Mind you, Ive only read through book 3, so I don't have all the details, but Dany seems to me a lot like Queen Elizabeth I. Lets compare:  

* they both are the last female lines of their families 
* they were both born princesses, who lost a parent early, and were pushed aside from the crown. Dany by Robert, Elizabeth by her brother 
* both rely(ied) on good councillors 
* both have been courted numerous times, and aside from Dany's short marriage to Drogo, neither were married 
* they do not have children (instead, the dragons are dany's children) 
* both want to rule fairly, unlike their fathers-Mad King and King Henry VIII

if you want to read more, check out [Elizabeth I](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England)

**Wolf's Cave**

&gt; ""Theon... Did you hate us the whole time?""
&gt; - Bran, sweet summer child pointing out that Theon's a dick

Boy, that escalated quickly. Just like in the last episode, when the events are so clearly fore*shadowed*, shit hits the fan in the first scene.

We missed a meaningful Theon's line: ""We're both princes, Bran. Who would have dreamed it?""

* Ser Rodrik was the arms master. Most likely he's the one who taught Theon fighting in the first place. The **iron**y.

* Somehow the books made the whole capture of Winterfell look a bit less messy. Now we got to see what happens when you use something lighter than a greatsword to chop off someone else's head.

* Osha isn't a slut in the books. Laughed at when she asked for a spear, she takes it herself from one of Theon's men and kicks his (not Theon's) ass. Instead, screw this, we get to see her naked.

* ""Who else has something to say"", asked Theon Greyjoy. ""Hodor hodor hodor hodor"", shouted Hodor, eyes wide. ""Someone kindly shut the halfwit up"".

And that's about Winterfell. Some people considered Bran's storyline not interesting so far.


**Canada**

&gt; ""We're fighting the North, which ain't going anywhere""
&gt; - Qhorin Halfhand, Sisyphus of the Night's Watch

Jon Snow, wandering like a ghost in the snow with his Ghost. Not much to say as this keeps quite accurate to Jon's POV. I think it's noteworthy that at this point of the story we should have heard the famous quote: ""You know nothing, Jon Snow"". Readers are gonna be pissed if Ygritte doesn't say it. If she doesn't, prepare for the rage. Also, now you get the inside joke (currently the main alternative to ""Oh, sweet summer child..."").

* It's not Iceland in the books, there are trees there. No need to start another obvious ""why talking about fire when there's a lack of firewood"" thread. In the show, the Badass Glacier North looks like that just to show us it's north of the Craster's Keep, which is north of the Wall, which is north of the Green Weirwoody North, which is north of pretty much everything else. And there are wildlings north of where Jon is. Easy, huh?

* Any discussion about the events concerning Jon in this episode barely escape spoiler tag, as we're kinda stuck in a place that the book would have already resolved at this time. Hard to discuss the changes before we see any conclusion.

* Noone complains anyway because Jon's last scene was simply adorable. Shouldn't have happened at this point, I'll get back to this later.


**Big Scary Castle**

&gt; ""I've travelled here directly from Renly's camp""
&gt; - Petyr Bealish, revealing his teleportation skills

Discussing the differences in Harrenhal is uneasy due to major plot changes. Now both Arya's targets are dead one season early, their book counterparts inexsistent. Not to mention Tywin Lannister having much more screen time.

* Littlefinger out of freaking nowhere! Totally not happening in the book. Don't worry about readers speculating if he knows it's Arya or not - we're just as confused as you are. While we all carefully track his eyes, there's some good development about Tyrells going in the background. It's good to see the actual players discussing this issue.

* King's Landing is almost in the exact middle between Stormlands and Harrenhall. Juding by the fact Catelyn got to her son's camp as well (see some paragraphs below), he had the time, but Petyr must have passed the capital on his way to see Tywin. He could stop by, but he chose to go straight to Papa Lannister.

* It was mentioned that ser Amory Lorche was supposed to take care of messages. Finding the letter in his hand won't raise any suspicions.

* Tywin has three children, and he's dissappointed with all of them. Jaime joined the Kingsguard against his will, leaving him with no heir but Tyrion, whose birth killed Tywin's wife. Arya-Tywin scenes bring out his desire to have a child he could be proud of.


**Rome Sweet Rome**

&gt; ""Love someone, love someone, love someone, love someone""
&gt; - Cersei Lannister, trying to make a threat impressive enough to get her brother down from his stool

Joffrey, against our wishes, managed to survive the riot, shit happens. We have him slapped for the fourth time, though. Fifth, including Cersei. That shall be enough for a while.

We didn't miss much but the success of the rape on another girl. It wasn't that impactful in the books, even though the rape resulted in pregnancy, because ""it could have been Sansa"" wasn't meaningful enough. In the show, it *was* actually Sansa, so we had the rape threat and the Hound being generally badass.

* The man chanting blessings was the High Septon, head of the Faith, Westeros equivalent of the Archbishop of Canterbury. Yes, he had been torn apart. And in comparison to his book equivalent, he was young, thin and humbly clothed.

* The people couldn't care less if Joffrey is the true king or not. What drove them to riot was their poverty, not anger with the immorality of their lords. It's explained to Sansa after the riot, but in the show it may appear that the smallfolk rebels against Lannisters. It just rebels.


**Bloody Middle East**

&gt; ""I'll take what is mine""
&gt; - Daenerys Targaryen, thinking anything is hers but a tribe of sandmen (oh wait) and three winged lizards (oh wait)

What in the books brought hardly any story development, serves in the show as a great character outline. Dany realizes how much trouble she's in, and we do along with her. Just because she's immune to fire and hatched three dragons doesn't mean anybody will join her crusade. All she has are some savage warriors and the dragons. Oh, wait...

Readers did NOT see that one coming. Dragons weren't stolen in the books. Even more than with Littlefinger and Arya, we are thrilled with that turn of events.

* Qarth in the books was boring so far? NOT

* Xaro is gay (at the moment Dany notes that, he's revealed clearer than Renly). That's one of the reasons why Dany refuses to marry him (a girl has her needs). I don't know if he said that enough times, but he's also the richest man in Qarth! ;) Why the marriage, then? Qarth tradition says husband and wife ask each other for a gift. Whatever they choose, their spouce has to give it. Guess what would Xaro ask his bride for.

* Like I said, Qarth at this point was quite boring, forget the book, watch the show. So here's a really irrelevant piece of trivia: All the women, though, wore dresses that revealed one breast. The boob-per-episode index in 2x05 would jump from 0 to some new (possibly uneven!) high score of the show.


**Camp Protagonist, Wherever That Is**

&gt; ""I'm not a spy""
&gt; - Jeyne Westerling, not lying about herself for the very first time

With Stannis absent from the screen, we had our deal of *The Man Who We Hope Will Kill Them All* with Robb. Brienne didn't say a word, but we know she's there.

* Camp Protagonist is located northwest to Harrenhal in an unspecified place. Robb is attacking castles sworn to Lannisters, carefully avoiding Harrenhal and Tywin Lannister.

* Jeyne. Those sharedes with her identity were blowing the reader's minds, but I think this episode clears this out: She's lying, she's not from Volantis, she's the book Jeyne. Why is this thing even a thing, you ask: In the book Jeyne doesn't appear at all, we don't see her until A Storm of Swords. And because every reader refers to her as Jeyne, you should know: That's her name. You'll find out later why she's not telling it. And that's it. Enjoy the season, it shows her much, much more interesting than the book did.

* Who is Robb promised to? The books say the same thing as the show: to one of the daughters of Walder Frey, lord of the Twins, sworn to the Tullys, family of Catelyn. Which one? The one he chooses, actually - but definitely one of them.

* Roose Bolton's bastard's name is **Ramsay Snow**. All the bastards in the North have common ""family name"" Snow. In Stormlands it's Storm (at this point of Stannis arc in the book, there was an issue with Edric Storm, Robert's bastard), and so on.

Think of it this way-- the Westerlings are sworn to the Lannisters.  In her first appearance this season, she makes comments sympathetic to the Lannister troops being slaughtered.  

This would make a lot of other things that happened in the books make more sense:

Ned introduces the notion early in the pilot episode; loses his own later in the season....Both the execution he delivers and receives are quite masterfully done...with minimal gore and suffering on the dying's part.

I don't remember exactly how many other times..but surely the show has given us a fair share of such scenes. So I was wondering if this is a major theme in the novels.  ",5,5,False,self,,,,,

The scene between her and Robb just had too many hints. Talisa Margyr is an assumed name she's using as a cover; either because she's a spy for the Lannisters or out of simple self preservation due to her father siding with Tywin/Joffery - or both. 

I never liked the theory that they were making a new character so viewers wouldn't get confused with Jeyne Poole. I really don't think most viewers knew her as anything other than Sansa's friend. A name change I can get, but a whole new character with a totally different backstory? It never really flew with me.

As a note, I am aware it is highly difficult nearing impossible to fit the whole content of a 1200+ page book into a single TV series. There's going be content removed based on time constraints, budgets and even sometimes the lack of an actor to match the character.

However, there has been some content missing so far that really irritates me. The major one being the lack of the Reeds siblings, Jojen and Meera. They are major companions of Bran and Hodor. I know the season is still going on, so perhaps there is still the possibility of them being introduced. 

The Fist of the First Men, now in the books, this area was wooded, and Jon Snow's direwolf found some obsidian artifacts buried with an old tattered Night's Watch cloak next to a tree. I just feel the story line part of obsidian being highly effective against the White Walkers adds more to the sense of magic and wisdom long forgotten that originally made me fall in love with the books.

Now the fact that Tywin is at Harrenhal is a neat twist compared to Lord Bolton, however, it does take away from the sense of betrayal and the fact that most lords will do whatever it takes to rise higher or to secure a better name for themselves. 

Now don't get me started on Qarth, the whole thing has been jumbled around to where it barely resembles any of the events in the books. Not to mention that Jhogo got beheaded in the red wastes yet he was an essential aid to Daenerys. The dragons were never stolen as well, she went into the Halls of the Undying willingly with her black dragon Drogon as a last ditch effort to gain the favor of the Warlocks.

I know I could be missing more, but these were the main ones off the top of my mind. There are things they have changed that I find made the telling of the story better in a television point-of-view as well.

TV spoilers everywhere.)

Any TV show, even one with 16 hours and counting like *Game of Thrones*, has to [foreshadow future events](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chekhov%27s_gun) much more obviously than five books, each with 1,000 pages of dense text, can. Based on what has been shown so far this season, two events will occur by the season finale.
 
**THE MISSING DRAGONS** (*ACoK*)

What we know:

* The House of the Undying, a mysterious place for warlocks with illusion powers, is forthcoming.
* Dany's dragons have been stolen, and the universal consensus is that this is to give her a stronger motivation for going to the House of the Undying than in *ACoK*.
* Dany has been teaching her dragons to breathe fire on command with the Valyrian word *dracarys*.

Logical conclusion of how the book will be interpreted on the show:

* At the end of the House of the Undying, Dany will find her dragons, perhaps with Pyat Pree and the other warlocks taunting her.
* Dany utters *dracarys*.
* The dragons (Drogo, certainly; possibly the others as well) start burning everything down, permitting her escape with them.

**THE BASTARD AT THE DREADFORT** (*ACoK* and *ADwD*)

What we know:

* Neither Ramsay Snow nor his henchman Reek has been cast.
* Roose Bolton's bastard will lead a force from the Dreadfort to recapture Winterfell.
* Robb has asked that Theon be taken alive.
* We are told that the Boltons once tortured people.

Logical conclusion of how the books will be interpreted on the show:

* The Bolton army will reconquer Winterfell, defeating the Greyjoys and capturing Theon.
* The Starks' servants will cheer ... until the Boltons, led by a helmeted, silent knight named Ramsay Snow, massacre them too.
* Robb will be told that Theon was killed, but he has been taken to the Dreadfort, where in future seasons we will see him tortured and treated so badly that Ramsay nicknames him ""Reek"", for his horrible body odor.

*It is known.*",0,0,False,self,,,,,

First it was how sloppy the opening scenes at Dragonstone were handled. There's no real context as to who these people are or what's goin on. They don't even mention their names. Then there's removing key characters like the Reeds, key locations like Riverrun (and thus a big part of Cat's character struggles with her WHOLE FAMILY falling apart, Storm's End (not a major loss, but we won't hear ""Bring on your storm. And remember, if you will, the NAME of this castle.""), and bizarre plot changes (Arya and Tywin bonding? Dragon napping?). All together I'm just not as into this season. I know it's an adaptation and not meant to follow the novels word for word, but each little change is sapping some of the joy of the show from me.

It's been a while since I've read ACoK, so my memory is fuzzy, but some of the things I questioned were:

* Did Jon and Ygritte go off on their own in the book?  I seem to remember them coming across the wildling camp and all of the major plot points with Jon, Quran and Ygritte happening at the camp.
* What about the riot and Sansa's scene at King's Landing?  My memory is fuzzy, but that didn't seem familiar
* I'm already aware that Arya's story has diverged significantly.  Jaqen isn't killing the same people, is he?
* I guess they're adding more to Robb's story since he doesn't do much in this book.  ""Talisa"" doesn't show up until the third book and her story isn't quite as involved.
* The whole scene at the end with Daenerys is completely new.  I guess it makes her story a little more interesting since I absolutely slept through her story in the second book

Correct me on any of these if I'm wrong.  Were there any other major changes in this episode?

* Did Bran and Rickon leave the city that early on?  I thought they [Later in ACoK](/b ""escaped during the fire. This would have been a lot more exciting"")",14,1,False,self,,,,,

I'm guessing some things are being moved between ASoS and ACoK, so here's my guesses...

*Jon with the wildlings, maybe throwing a cautious glance over his shoulder, Rattleshirt eyeing him

*A filfthy Jamie Lannister, with Brienne laboring away at the oars 

*I don't know why, but I could see Arya's story speeding up, and maybe running into Sandor Clegane at the very end of this season? I like the image of her fleeing and running into The Hound, slow pan up, lovely mug. That, or it could just be Gendry, Hot Pie, and her fleeing Harrenhal as she eyes the coin Jaqen gave her. 

*Tyrion watching Tywin knight Bronn, as his ""claws"" are removed one by one

*Stannis on a ship deck among the last remains of his fleet


Those are just my thoughts, obviously I missed a ton of characters and possibilities. Your thoughts? Or do you see the season ending less like season 1 did, perhaps with a cliffhanger?

The book was muuuuuuch better."" I should probably also point out that I do this mainly while at my minimum wage job. Yay humanities.

I have yet to read any of the Game of Thrones books yet. I tried the first one but found the constantly jumping narrative to be a bit jarring. As such I gave it up and yet... About a year later I find myself hopelessly in love with the tv series. Clearly I made a mistake in tossing aside the book. 

My question is this: what are we missing? What are some of the most glaring departures from the books in the tv series and what are those who only watch the tv shows missing out on? Extra character development? Insightful commentary? I cannot help but feel, despite occasionally hearing reviewers of the episodes say that episode x or y stayed close to the book, that I am not getting the depth that readers did. Any help?

I finished aCoK over the weekend and just started aSoS. I'm up to date with the show, and I'm just so astonished by how much the producers are changing. Season 1 matched aGoT almost perfectly, no complaints. But in this season, they're completely changing the plot in certain points. Such as:

- Making Arya Tywin's cupbearer
- Making Arya's targets completely different people
- No Reed siblings
- The capture of Daenarys' dragons
- The whole Jon Snow/Ygrid encounter
- Making Shae Sansa's servant
- Lack of Ser Dontos/Fool (so far)

There's more, but I'm blanking out on them. These changes are huge, especially the capturing of Daenarys' dragons. For those who haven't read the books in a while, [ACOK](/b ""Daenarys keeps her dragons safe and gets ships from two men sent by Ilyrio."") This capturing is completely different.

I was stabbing myself in the eyeball whenever whiny came on screen the last two episodes. I have a particular disdain for the mother of dragons post-Qarth. I preface this by saying I haven't read the second book and what follows is poorly written hyperbole.

--------------

The thing about Dany that makes her such a shit character (in the past two episodes) is her objectives make no sense.

Every other character in the show has some level of reasoning behind their actions or what they want to achieve. Dany doesn't. 

She was bullied into wanting to take the throne for her brother, however it was never her goal. Her goal was to avoid getting fucked up by her brother and Drogo. The Iron Throne was just a secondary goal suggested to her and one that she never really seemed to want. She is somewhat blinded by delusions of grandeur and she sees the throne as a worthwhile prospect in it's own merit, but it is never her primary objective. Just something to achieve in the future after all the raping and whatnot.

Suddenly: Dead brother --&gt; She decides she kinda wants her and Drogo's sons to rule over the seas. However, once again her main goal still stands with safety. Her own personal safety and the safety of her people. Leading them to glory across the seas with her children inheriting the throne somewhere down the track is in her mind, but not at the forefront.

Dead Drogo --&gt; The dream of the throne is dashed. She solidifies her main objective: Saving her people and dragons.

Qarth --&gt; Complete with her 5 followers and 3 pre-pubescent monitor lizards she finally finds a tiny level of safety she hasn't felt since she pretty much murdered her own husband. However it is not permanent and she is still in danger, albeit now of a more political kind. So here she is, chilling and trying to get her bearings and all of a sudden she immediately decides ""fuck my 5 loyal followers and my attempt at being a good Khaleesi. I randomly decide that all this time my main goal has not been safety, but a burning desire to attack this other country. Every reason for me wanting it earlier may be dead, but screw it!""

Her primary goal the whole time has been keeping herself/her people safe, yet that goal takes a back seat to a previous (secondary) objective that has had most of the meaning behind it removed. She has a goal (not getting dragons stolen and not getting all her people murdered in her courtyard), yet she ignores it for pretty much no reason.

She is comparable to Cersei in that they are both greedy bitches who are blinded by their wants and yet Cersei still manages to make sense. Cersei is a greedy, selfish bitch; but at least she is a greedy bitch with priorities. She wants power to remain within her family. Inconsequential things like making babies with her brother can take a back seat in her story, but they are still there on the horizon. She still wants them down the track, but realises she needs to apply herself to her main objective foremost.

Dany on the other hand is an idiot. She is worse than a 5 year old with no idea what she wants, because it has been made blatantly clear repeatedly that what she wants is safety now and then conquest later on. Unlike the 5 year old she knows what she wants, but she does something else.

Am I way off the mark on this? I really dislike her.",76,26,False,self,,,,,

The fact that the Baratheons have strong genetics when it comes to their appearance, all Baratheons have been darkhaired and dark eyed. This was also true for Robert as all his bastards had this aswell.

This makes Jon Arryn, and later Ned Stark, realise that Robert's children aren't actually his and that Cersei is having an affair with her brother.

Why does it mean that? The Lannisters are all blondes, so isn't it entirely possible that the Lannister blonde hair is simply more dominant than the Baratheon dark hair?

Say Robert's mother was blonde and both Cersei's parents were blonde, that could easily result in the Baratheon genetics not being as strong in Robert's children despite brown hair being generally more dominant than blonde.",30,0,False,default,,,,,

Melisandre takes off her robe and shows her fully pregnant belly. The light flickers and she sits down on her robe and bears down. A black smoke starts pouring out from between her legs. A black, spiny, creepy, skeletal something issues forth and rises to stand before them, full man-sized.

The Shadow Man has a huge, 13 inch cock. He makes his way to Renly's tent, where a gay orgy is taking place. Renly is busy blowing his brother-in-law when the Shadow Man takes him from behind, with no lube. The aspiring king cries out, half in pain, half in pleasure. The huge shadow cock expands in girth, it's diameter now much greater than even the biggest chode. Renly's asshole starts to split and tear, blood leaking everywhere.

Renly is flipped over by the tenacious Shadow, and the huge black cock is thrust down his mouth. As the Shadow Man reaches climax, Renly's eyes open wide and he lets out a muffled scream as the giant Shadow penis shoots poison jizum down his throat. The Shadow Man dissipates, his mission being over and his balls emptied. Renly Baratheon is dead, drowned in demon Shadow cum.

Here are some things that bothered me too much than they should have:

* Sound editing in the last episode was terrible.  In Theon's first scene the rain was on and off (clearly due to the instability of the rain while shooting, a naturally excusable thing) yet the sound of pouring rain continued in shots where clearly no rain was falling.

* In the revolt in King's Landing, there's one shot of a red soldier thrusting a spear forward, clearly not hitting anybody with it yet a loud ""spear going through guts"" sound was added...

* Jon Snow volunteered to go ranging with Quorin Halfhand.  In the book he doesn't even consider it until Quorin Halfhand mentions his name as those he wants ranging with him.  This was better in the books as it showed the gradual evolving of Jon Snow's character.",14,1,False,self,,,,,

""In the Song of Ice and Fire novels, Pyat Pree is a pale man with blue lips, like most of his order. ""

And most recently there was a post on reddit about someone who said that one of the dead girls who was guarding the dragons died and had somewhat ""blue"" looking lips*. My initial suspicion was this guy in the first place and this just leaves no other answer. I suspected him from the scene where he preformed the ""magic trick"" and I doubt they would introduce him to the series just for one or two scenes.

I have recently finished my end of year exams and I currently find myself with a lot of time on my hands. Im also a diehard GoT/ASOIAF fan with little to no social life (outside the internets, that is.)

My friend and I recently came up with the idea of having a large fight-to-the-death tourney featuring GoT characters on this subreddit. This is how we are envisioning at the moment: redditors suggest characters (or even animals/beasts) in the world of the GoT series that they want to see take part  they can be living or dead, but non-readers must be familiar with them. Based on how many are selected, an 8, 16 or 32 person bracket will then be formed, and matchups between these characters will be randomly selected to form round one.

A matchup consists of two characters fighting each other to the death, using any armour or weapon they see fit, in an arena of some sort. The winner of each fight will be determined by the most upvoted comment that provides a description (doesnt have to be long) of the fight and its outcome as of a certain date. Its important that descriptions are included as character injuries will carry over to the next round (which is set a week after.) Winners will then progress to the next round.

We made this thread to see if theres enough interest and for people to suggest names. If there are too many, the most upvoted comments will get priority. Also, if you have any questions/suggestions regarding this, we are happy to answer/listen. We want this to be fun, and were hoping to include both readers and non-readers.

And if this is a lame idea, thats cool too!

In the first two episodes, they mention his age twice. Once before they go to murder the deserted and once when he is climbing before the incident. They mention his age as 10 both times. In the book, however, they mention his age as 7, twice. The first scene doesn't exist in the book, so the first time is the second time. The second time is during the event when Catelyn is returning and is at the inn.

For what reason do they portray his age as older than he is? I haven't particularly noticed it with other characters, though I wouldn't doubt it has happened. Is there a reason for casting him in a different view than the book does?",10,0,False,self,,,,,

Now, in my dream, it turns out that Jon Snow is actually Lyanna Stark's child. And I was thinking about this while awake. In the book (at least so far) they dont go into detail about how she died. Just mentioned the fact that she died in Eddard's arms. And when Ned comes back from the war, he has a bastard child. I may just be making something out of nothing here, but it would be interesting as hell if it turns out that she actually died giving birth to Jon Snow. And in order to protect his sister's legacy/image from Robert and the world, Ned took responsibility for the child, claiming him as his own. Which would kind of explain his unwillingness to talk about the briefly mentioned ""Wylla"" even when talking to Robert during their hunt. It would also blow my mind if it turns out that Jon Snow's father is Rhaegar Targaryen. Either a) Rhaegar was in love with Lyanna, and took her away to be married, and subsequently conceived Jon or b) Rhaegar kidnapped her and raped her. The first appealed to me more, and as Lyanna died, she kept telling Ned to ""promise"" her. So, maybe she was telling him to promise that he wouldnt tell about her and Rhaegar's love or maybe she wanted him to promise that he would take care of her son. Also, I'd like to believe that Lyanna and Rhaegar married, and it turns out that it's actually Jon who is the true King of Westeros...Stark and Targaryen...with Ice and Fire in his veins...I think it would tie up nicely.  

**I'm only about 1/3 of the way through Book One, and I dont know if any of this has been proven wrong, It's just a theory from someone who has watched every episode of the show and just started the books**

Love all the great discussions I have seen, but most of them seem focused around the HBO episodes and not around some of the more serious questions in the series. For all you other long time readers I know there is a serious contingent who truly believes the theory I'm going to put forward here.  I cannot take credit for all this work and research, but I find myself agreeing with it more with every reread of the series. 
Edit: Sorry for any confusion these ideas are not my own simply posting them here to spur discussion. The original research goes to the fellow over here. http://www.angelfire.com/ma4/mlarchives/faq/jon.html

**Jon Snow is not Lord Eddard Stark's Son. He is the product of a love affair between Rhagar and Lyanna.**

At first glance, this suggestion seems ludicrous. Rhaegar and Lyanna? Theres no direct evidence or personal claims to support this, as opposed to both Ashara Dayne and Wylla. Yet there are subtle, benign clues. Lots of them, in fact. And the more one looks at them, the more one is convinced that this could be the answer. The theory is a complicated one. First, the entire possible story will be given, in order for the reader to gain full understanding of the theory, and then Ill provide various pieces of evidence for each portion of this hypothosis, complete with quotes and page numbers (and lots of em!). Finally, Ill ponder on why this could have happened.

1) The Story

Rhaegar Targaryen married Elia Martell, and fathered two children off her, Rhaenys and Aegon. Yet the marriage was political, and at the Harrenhal tourney in the year of the false spring, Rhaegar met his true love--Lyanna Stark. Together, the pair fell in love, and ran off together some time after, to the Tower of Joy in the Red Mountains of Dorne.

There, Rhaegar impregnated Lyanna. However, Rhaegar had to go leave to fight Robert, and three of the Kingsguard were sent to the Tower of Joy to protect Lyanna and her unborn child. Somehow, Eddard and his battle companions discovered Lyannas location. They assumed that Lyanna was abducted by Rhaegar, and did not join him by her own free will.

Eddard and the northmen reach the Tower of Joy, and battle ensues with the Kingsguard. At the end, only Eddard and the crannogman Howland Reed are left alive. Eddard enters the tower to find Lyanna. She has given birth to the baby, but, due to complications of childbirth, she is dying. She makes Eddard promise not to reveal the childs true parentage to anyone, lest Roberts hatred of Targaryens lead him to kill the child. Then she dies.

Eddard names the child Jon. He, Jon and possibly Howland all ride to Starfall, to return the greatsword Dawn which used to belong to Arthur Dayne until he was killed in the fighting. There, perhaps Eddard and Wylla conspire to pretend Wylla is Jons mother, to protect Jon. Also, Ashara kills herself (for the possible reasons, see above).

Eddard then rides north with Jon, claiming the son is his and Wyllas to protect Jon from Roberts Targaryen hatred.

2) The Evidence

a) Rhaegars Personality--True Love With Lyanna?

At the beginning of the series, the reader comes off with a general disliking of Rhaegar Targaryen. However, most opinions about Rhaegar comes from Robert. While Robert makes Rhaegar out to be an evil man and a rapist, this could be because Rhaegar stole away Lyanna, Roberts true love. Clearly, no other character has this dislike for Rhaegar, and most other characters seems to repsect and adore him. Just a brief selection:

He {Ned} wondered if Rhaegar had frequented brothels. Somehow he thought not. --GoT, pg. 381.

The knight {Jorah} gave her a curious look. You are your brothers sister, in truth.
Viserys? She {Dany} did not understand.
""No, he answered. Rhaegar.--GoT, pg.668

{Dany said,} There is some good to be said of my father, surely?
There is, Your Grace. Of him, and those who came before him. Your grandfather Jaehaerys and his brother, their father Aegon, you mother...and Rhaegar. Him most of all. --SoS, pg. 815

And this is a story - a tragedy, really, about another fan and who George honored him.

You might have noticed ""House Manwoody of Kingsgrave"" in the books. They're a minor house and it's kind of a weird name, and their symbol is a white skull wearing a gold crown on a black field. They're named after one of the nicest guys I ever met, a member of the BWB who was very active in the community, and incredibly accomplished. His name was Michael - I'll leave his last name out of it for reasons that will become clear.

Way back in 2001 the World Science Fiction Convention was in Philadelphia, and that's where I first met George and the other members of what became the BWB. We had a riotous weekend together, started a lot of traditions that are still going strong, and forged a bond of friendship that has lasted. Michael lived in Australia but, but was an active member and mod on the ASOIAF boards that were, and still are, the center of AGOT fandom. The next year he got a very prestigious post teaching international law at Penn. That's when I met him, and he was a great guy, incredibly knowledgeable and with impeccable taste, but not a scrap of pretension in him. 

He had a gift for teaching people about the things he loved - running, fine single-malt scotch, opera - without condescending. We went out for drinks once and when I confessed I didn't ""get"" whiskey, he immediately ordered up a storm and talked me through every nuance and flavor of each single malt. It started a lifelong love of good scotch for me. Anyway, Manwoody (his name on the board) had the same effect on everyone, and as a Falstaffian lover-of-life, George Martin admired him too. Every year at WorldCon we got together, the whole gang. One year, Manwoody told us he was doing the ""Grand Tour"" in fine style before returning home to Australia. He traipsed all over Europe, visiting distilleries and opera festivals, and writing a series of opera criticisms that were published and are still well regarded. 

And then he went home and killed himself. We were all stunned. Stunned. Here was a man at the very top of his game - widely admired and with an impressive career as well as avocation. And it turns out he had been diagnosed with a terminal, degenerative neurological condition that he had watched turn his father from a vibrant man to helpless vegetable. So rather than do the same, and impose another burden of care on his mother and sister, he went out at the height of his powers.

We were shattered. Shattered. George was too. And so in his honor, House Manwoody are from Kingsgrave. It was this time of year when the news broke, and so I thought to pass on the story of a great guy, and the author who memorialized him. Tonight I'll have a scotch in his honor. 

Edit: A few people pointed out that the first appearance of the Manwoodys was in 2000, three years before Lord Manwoody's death in 2003. I followed up with other people who are in the know, and I was wrong - Michael did take his name from the books, not the reverse. However, a character named after and in honor of him exists 'in canon' and will appear soon; this straight from the horse's mouth. This isn't quite as touching, I'm afraid, as the story as I understood it. No purposeful deception occurred on my part, and I apologize for the confusion. Many other people had precisely the same recollection that I did, and we're all surprised. ",140,1296,False,self,,,,,

Some thoughts on the whole thing.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/thiyn/spoilers_asos_just_finished_the_book_some/,alaska497,1336702329,"-It's nice to see how truly devious Littlefinger is. Finding out about his history with Lysa, followed by the unceremonious push was crazy. Really excited for this storyline to pan out. He is pretty much responsible for the whole chaos begun in GoT, yeah? Except he didn't plan on Joff sending the assassin to Bran, though that only served to help. 

-Joff dying = Gold

-Tywin dying = More gold

-In the end, I'm not that sad about Robb. It was coming, though it was tragic. I'm loving pseudo-zombie Cat at the end.

-Still curious about Theon (I think he's alive, but I swear his last CoK made me believe Ramsay killed him at Winterfell), and I'm really disappointed in the lack of update throughout the entire book.

-Arya definitely gets the award for consistently awesome storyline, especially where we are left at the end.

-Overall, the most compelling character for me is Jaime. Still waiting on reaction to concluding events of SoS, but he becomes so human during this book.

-We got the reveal on Littlefinger, but I feel that Varys helping Tyrion escape overseas is more devious than it seems. It would definitely prevent Sansa from remarrying, right? I think the Varys vs. Littlefinger plotting is interesting, if possibly unintentional.

I can't wait until finals are over so I can dive into AFfC. I'm going to be so sad when i have nothing left to read in the series...",12,9,False,self,,,,,

---
The Game of Thrones subreddit is a place to enjoy and discuss the HBO series, the book series A Song of Ice and Fire, and the works of GRRM in general.  This subreddit has a [posting scope](http://www.reddit.com/help/faq#WhydoesredditneedmoderationCantyoujustletthevotersdecide) managed through [moderation](http://www.reddit.com/help/faq#Whatisamoderator).  Content not meeting the criteria described below will be removed.

Content must be relevant to subreddit discussion
---

* Something related to the show or books should exist in the image/article/etc. prior to the post
* The post should provide unique value compared to other recent posts
* Reader-reaction posts should promote discussion about the show/books/story
* Posts about other posts are not relevant to story discussion

Content with spoilers must provide warning
---

* Put a warning in your topic title to define the spoiler scope of your post
* Comment replies with spoilers outside the title scope must use cover tags
* Describe your spoiler tags with a clear, informative label
* Don't joke, tease, or troll with spoilers unless they are tagged for easy avoidance

Content must be legal and respectful to others
---

* Don't post links or direct people to free/pirated show or book media
* Don't ask for links or direction to free/pirated show or book media
* Don't sexually objectify the actors, characters, or redditors, no matter their age or sex
* Don't post excessive profanity, slurs, or any needlessly offensive or insulting comments
* Don't post inflammatory, derogatory, or rudely trollish remarks
* Don't try to circumvent or subvert the posted policies

Other notes and clarifications
---

* Information or links to external articles, images, or videos are all allowed content types
* Don't criticize or belittle specific people for what they have not yet seen or read
* All posts are expected to follow the posting and [spoiler policies](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/hvg3r/) even if the parent comment or overall topic initially set a bad example
* Fake spoilers designed to ""protect"" show-watchers from knowing the truth about current show events are fine, but posting false spoilers about future events is not ok
* Posting the name of a site counts as directing someone to pirate, and asking for a PM to a pirate link in a comment is still asking inside the subreddit
* Discussion of piracy as a concept is fine, including the idea that HBO's choice to limit access is driving people to piracy; just don't use this community to perform piracy
* Spam accounts that exist primarily to promote a website are not allowed
* Commercial posts are allowed as long as they're not also spam
* Photos of generic merchandise purchases are no longer considered relevant. Do not post photos of your books, t-shirts, pins, swords, or any other run-of-the-mill swag that anyone can get.
* The discussion of sex in the story is fine, including rape, incest and/or underage participants, as long as the comments are academic and story-relevant
* All content is subject to [Reddit's ban on suggestive or sexual content featuring minors](http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/pmj7f/a_necessary_change_in_policy/); that is where impersonal academic discussion prevents any issues
* Reposted content should be older than two weeks (Check the [new posts list](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/new/) before you submit)
* The community decisions from the last [content survey](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/qh7ga/) are now included in the policy
* In cases where relevance is in question a post may be left online for a community decision and removed if it receives a negative balance of votes
* Memes that have been over-posted are ""tired"" and not allowed even after the two-week repost limit.  New takes on old memes may be ok, and old memes may be allowed back later after a time of rest.
* Posting in a manner that does not reflect the scope described in this policy can be grounds for banning.

So I just began reading the GoT series on my nook yesterday and I haven't gotten too far, but it's fantastic. Anyways, I'm not sure if it's my ADHD distracting me so it's harder to comprehend or I accidentally skipped over something, or maybe it's just I'm really on the younger side of reddit users and the book is aimed at older people. I understand the pages will be different on my nook but right now I'm at the part where Jon is drunk and Ghost is being challenged the older female direwolf. So my question, I'm not super far in but I still don't completely understand the plot, am I missing something?

TL;DR: Not super far in the book but I still can't completely understand the plot.

Thanks!",6,3,False,self,,,,,

I've read all of AGOT and I'm up to the same point in ACOK as the TV has reached (ish - the scene order is a bit different as you are all aware) - and i desperately want to continue reading but I watch every monday night with a group of my friends (none of whom have read the books) and we have a great time finding everything out at once and I don't want to ruin that.

So my question is: Is it worth carrying on reading and then just keeping my mouth shut when watching with my friends or should I carry on as I have been and finish the book when the season has finished.

There must be other people in a similar situation - and if someone could make a convincing argument for one way or the other I'd be eternally grateful",25,15,False,self,,,,,

It wasn't until I listened to the commentary by D&amp;D before I realised that the purpose of the scene had gone totally over my head. 

As Pycelle stood up to do some naked squats, David (or Dan) said ""oh, here comes a great Keyser Soze moment"". It was only at this point I realised that Grand Maester Pycelle had been hobbling and limping around The Red Keep until this moment, where he briskly walked away at the end of the scene.

It was some very nice and subtle (too subtle for me!) foreshadowing towards Pycelle's role in The Game, which would be revealed in Season 2.

I had missed it, and I remembered people here complaining about how irrelevant the scene was, so I thought I'd share! 

**TL;DR: Grand Maester Pycelle is Keyser Soze**

Like a lot of us I personally cannot afford HBO or cable in general. However, like most of us I would gladly pay for Game of Thrones if there was a better distribution model. I love the show so much I would even donate to it. If HBO came out and said hey we realize online piracy is something that we cannot combat and its on us to make a better distribution model and we are sorry of making it increasingly difficult for even our paid subscribers to watch their favorite shows due to our drm.

while we work on improving our model we ask that if you do not have an hbo subscription and you truly are passionate about one or many of our shows please donate to it and show your support. In return we promise to utilize 75% of the donated money to directly increase the production budget of the show you donated to. 

imagine hbo being able to film all the battles in GOT among other things. it could become, undoubtedly, the most epic tv series in history. it would make history books as one of the most genius business ideas in television and we'd get unparalleled entertainment.

However, I did decide to start personalizing all of my contacts so I know exactly who's calling and texting me just by their particular tone. My mom loves this show and thinks Daenerys is amazing so I went ahead and made a sound clip of her from the latest episode. I went ahead and uploaded both the iPhone version and the Wav version over here:

http://min.us/mbhepRN0SY/2

And I figured I'd start taking requests as a way of helping the day go a little faster. So, have a line or a piece of the show you've been dying to have on your phone? Let me know what episode it's in and, if possible, roughly where in the episode I can find it and I'll try to get as many done as possible.

EDIT: I'm stepping out to go grab some groceries but if anyone would like to take me up on my offer just respond below or send me a DM and I'll upload it to that folder above when I get back. I also added a few more since I made this post (mostly Tyrion) so feel free to grab what you'd like. Also, this is my first time using Minus so if I did something wrong and you can't download them please just let me know!

EDIT 2: Ok, just got done a massive upload and we're about to pull the burgers off the grill so I'm gonna step away for a while. Here's the list so far:

* Arya's Winter is Coming
* Tyrion telling the Hound to be a good dog (2 versions)
* The Greatjon's reaction to a direwolf attack (2 versions)
* Cersei slapping Joffrey
* Stannis' cold winds are rising
* Daenerys' declaration
* Daenerys' reaction to Viserys' death
* Tyrion likes living
* Marillion's Song (2 versions)
* Ned's Winter is Coming
* Shagga likes axes
* Tyrion's ready for breakfast (2 versions) &lt;-- My new ""easy"" wake up alarm
* Tyrion slaps Joffrey (5 versions - right?)
* Tyrion's opinion of Joffrey
* The Greatjon declares Robb King of the North (2 versions)
* Don't call Arya m'lady (3 versions)
* Commander Mormont isn't sure who he is
* Short text tone of the main theme, provided by Maf3n
* Yoren wants you to wake up right now &lt;-- My new ""YOU OVERSLEPT"" alarm
* You know nothing, Jon Snow

All files are in both m4r (iPhone) and WAV (I hope everything else, but easily convertible). I'll keep checking back for suggestions.

FINAL(?) EDIT: So, looks like we missed our window to hold onto a top spot on the subreddit so I'm guessing there won't be too many more people finding this post. However, if you do come across it and want to request a tone, just DM me and I'll get it made up for you.

Feel free to add your own in the comments though please be sure to tag spoilers and avoid hinting too strongly at things to come.

* Catelyn actually hates Jon Snow.  This isn't properly displayed in the show since the only real time that they emphasized it was in season 1 when Catelyn is grieving after Bran fell from the tower.  Jon comes in and she aggressively tells him to leave.  This can easily be misinterpreted as her wanting to be alone when really it's mostly because she hates his guts.  She hates him because he's a sign of Ned Stark's infidelity early on in their relationship.  A good quote from the book to show this is when they are both looking at coma Bran, Catelyn says [Minor GoT Spoiler] (/b ""It should have been you"").  Something to take into consideration for those of you who think Catelyn perfectly fits the role of a ""good guy"".

* Nobody likes Tyrion.  When I was at this point in the books there are only 4 people that I thought may actually like him.

1. Bronn, though you have to remember that Bronn is getting paid by Tyrion throughout and is still technically a sellsword.  In the books Bronn was never assigned to be the captain of the Gold Cloaks so that may be indicative of a closer partnership/friendship in the show.

2. Shae, she says she loves him and she seems to love him.  Yet she still always acts like a whore around him and he is still paying her to be his and only his.  So she may just be playing the part?  Tyrion is never sure of this during the books and thinks about it often.

3. Jaime, there's nothing to ever show that he hates Tyrion the way everyone else does yet he's a prisoner of war under the Starks far away.  So we can't really see that past the few times they spoke very early on in the show.  Which always seemed at least a bit friendly/brotherly.

4. Jon Snow, he rather enjoyed his time hanging out with Tyrion when he was at the Wall.  Tyrion helped him understand the situation of the other recruits and as shown in the show he explains to him that they don't like him because he is better than them and they resent him for it.  Understanding this makes Jon's life with the others clearer/easier and when Tyrion leaves Jon Snow in AGoT actually calls him ""Friend"".  This makes Tyrion a little uncomfortable and this helps to show that Tyrion isn't used to people calling him ""Friend"" legitimately.

* Ever since his brother (the Mountain/Gregor Clegane) planted his face on the fire as a child, the Hound (Sandor Clegane) really REALLY dislikes fire.

* Ever since Tywin and his army won the battle at the Green Fork they have been burning and pillaging the Riverlands.  This is why there is generally not enough food in the area and why there are so many who have flocked to King's Landing from the smaller villages and stuff along the Kingsroad.  This also explains why Tywin and his forces are setup in and around Harrenhall, which is actually located between Riverrun (Stark+Tully base of operations and Tully capital) and King's Landing.

* Explanation of main army movements:  When declaring war against the Lannisters the Stark force headed south toward Riverrun.  On the way there they broke up part of their army to fight Tywin and the main Lannister force while the rest of their army went to ambush Jaime's army (note: Lannisters had two major armies at this point) which was besieging Riverrun (Capital of Tully lands, Catelyn's family and why they are allied with Starks).  The decisive victory against Jaime Lannister is known as the battle of the Whispering Wood.  This maoeuvre also explains why Tywin is now east of them and has decided to setup camp in Harrenhall and is burning the villages up the Kingsroad and in the riverlands.  Harrenhall is located more or less halfway between Riverrun (Stark/Tully base of operations) and King's Landing.  Partially with remnants of Jaime's army the Lannisters attempted to raise a new, second army in Lannisport (west of Riverrun) to be led by Tywin's cousin.  This army was completely destroyed a few episodes ago by Robb Stark.  Renly had raised the largest army in Westeros (very much thanks to the support of the Tyrells and the lords of the Reach) and was slowly marching toward King's Landing while gaining prestige/friends on the way.  He was making a show about it until Stannis took his small army out of Dragonstone by ship and lay siege to Storm's End, Renly's capital city on the east coast and south of (yet close to) King's Landing.  At this time Stannis has a very small army but does have a significant pirate fleet led by Sallador Saan who are currently serving mostly on promises of future payment after Stannis becomes king.  After the events we have seen in the show in the past few episodes, a very large majority of Renly's Lords and armies have sworn fealty to Stannis.  Stannis is now regrouping with his new large army before planning on moving toward King's Landing and the throne.  King's Landing has a very insignificant defensive force.  Mostly City Watch guardsmen, only a few thousand with about 90% of them being new recruits who are mostly only joining to be able to have a guaranteed meal.  If they ever get into a fight they'd probably abandon their posts as soon as things get hairy.  The Greyjoys/Iron Islanders have taken lands in the North, the stony shore in the west, Torrhen's Square (halfway between the stony shore and Winterfell, which is in the middle of the north), Deepwood Motte in the far Northwest near the coast, Winterfell (Thanks to Theon and ~30 guys) and most importantly Moat Cailin (A formidable defensive position in the Neck, if you want to go to the north of Westeros you essentially have to pass through Moat Cailin).

* Another interesting thing to consider about army positions is their ambitions:

1. Lannister are in Harrenhall and WERE waiting for a second army to raise in order to crush Stark/Riverrun from both east and west.  Now they're just burning the riverlands while determining what to do next.

2. Starks are probing into Lannister lands, mostly just to kill Lannisters and make their lives hell.

3. Renly was marching straight for King's Landing and the Iron Throne.

4. Stannis sieged Storm's End to mess Renly up, and now that he has a stronger force he'ss preparing to go straight for King's Landing and the Iron Throne.

5. The Iron Islanders are attacking and pillaging the North and Balon is now titling himself ""King of the Iron Islands and the North"".  They're out for conquest/glory.

* Nobody knows where Ser Barristan Selmy has gone.

* Lysa Arryn (Catelyn Stark's sister) is currently sitting in the Vale not doing anything.  Everyone has sent ravens with messages to her to try and get her to join them in the war but she's not even answering anyone.  Every Lord in the Vale is also trying to woo her in order to become the new lords of the Vale.  Lysa is currently extremely overprotective of her 7-8 year old son Rob Arryn who is technically Lord of the Vale.  He's a sickly/weak boy and is the only one of about 4-5 kids of Jon Arryn to actually survive infancy.

* This one is not well shown in the show but is a very interesting/important background from Robert's rebellion and how it is affecting current events.  See GoT spoiler at your own risk, there aren't spoilers here for future events in the show.  [GoT Spoiler] (/b ""Rhaegar Targaryen (The Mad King's oldest son, Heir and brother of Dany/Viseris) was wed to Elia of Dorne (House Martell).  They had two children together, a girl and a baby boy.  Tywin Lannister ordered his men to kill Rhaegar's family as a sign of his loyalty toward Robert (since this was the first time that the Lannisters chose a side/did something in the rebellion).  The Mountain Ser Gregor Clegane allegedly raped Elia and killed the boy by swinging him into a wall.  Ser Amory Lorch (Who we saw die as Arya's second name to Jaqen H'gar) stabbed the scared girl ""half a hundred times"".  When Ned Stark found out he strongly disagreed with it yet Robert dismissed it.  This caused Ned Stark and Robert to lose their friendship which was only healed when they both attended Lyanna Stark's funeral.  The killing of Rhaegar's family in cold blood still haunts Ned Stark to this day and that is why in season 1 he so strongly disagreed to join Renly and his forces to take the royal children in the night.  It is because of this that Dorne has been sitting in their lands staying to themselves pretty much since Robert became king."")

* Tywin ""ruled"" Westeros for 20 years in his youth.  He was named Hand of the King when he was very young and for 20 years while Aerys II The Mad King was keeping himself busy with his own things/wildfire Tywin Lannister successfully did all the real work of ruling the Seven Kingdoms.  And when Tywin was in charge things were good.  When the Mad King was seeing how well Tywin was doing he perceived him as a threat and kicked him out of King's Landing.  This is part of the reason why Tywin and the Lannisters eventually joined Robert Baratheon's rebellion.

* Part of the reason that Theon decides to side against the Starks:  Growing up in Winterfell Ned Stark did treat him properly but was never a father to him.  Theon was well aware that if ever he had to (For political reasons or whatnot), Ned Stark would have killed him.

However, she doesn't just put them anywhere. She places the black beside his heart, under his arm. She places the green beside his head. Finally she places the cream and golden egg between his legs.

Think about these positions on your body. Under left arm, by your head, and under your legs. They literally trace the outline of a sword or a cross. This outline, I believe, signifies the fact that the three dragons of Daenerys are actually the fabled sword Lightbringer. It is a metaphorical sword, not a literal one. In my opinion Jon Snow is a curve ball, to throw the readership off guard. He is the bastard of Eddard Stark, or the son of Rhaegar and Lyanna, nothing more or less. He is not Azor Ahai.

The pommel of the 'sword' sits by Drogo's head. The end of the guard/hilt is where the black egg is placed. Finally, between the legs is where the tip of the sword would end.

In the original story of Azor Ahai, he tempers his blade in the heart of his loved one, Nissa Nissa. Daenerys is tempering her 'sword' in the fires of her beloved Khal Drogo's pyre. She walks into the burning pyre and emerges unscathed. In contrast Jon Snow suffers a severe burn in the early books, to his sword hand, and it troubles him for some time.

My speculation is thus: Daenerys is Azor Ahai. The actual word is gender neutral, with 'The Prince that Was Promised', potentially also meaning Princess in their tongue.

In the final two books, she will return to Westeros with her dragons. They will grow dramatically during the remaining two books, through magic or other means. Westeros will be plunged into the true depths of Winter, with the Long Night descending. The Others (White Walkers) will cross the Wall in force. Daenerys will, quite literally this time, bring light back to the realm through her dragons fire.",30,21,False,self,,,,,

What if Old Valyria is speaking of a history, a past so distant that only rumors and fragments, just prophecies and trickles of blood remain. What if the ancestors that we know of (think of the oldest Targaryens, think of Starks Tomb), what if they are only the great great great great(etc for exaggerated effect...) grandkids, of a time when dragons were their pets, raised a couple to a family. I believe that in this time, blowing a horn could bind your specific dragons to your family (your bloodline). Hatching new dragons requires the sacrifice of an Elder in your family, thus the blood price is paid. Sacrifices are on a Pyre, burning the Elder with an egg causes it to hatch, but only blowing a horn in its presence can control it. Now if you're thinking I'm crazy, it gets better...
It's all religious.
That's right. The Red Priest/Priestess' are the correct/right religion. In order to bind a dragon to your family, you must have a red priest's kiss of life the horn blower...That person, and all those that are born of them, control that dragon.. Valar Marghulis . Valar Dohaeris.
Now the only thing I can't figure out is the prophecies... My theory focuses on how far displaced we are from this past, how much time have the prophecies had to spread around the world, to mutate and disconnect....
All of the prophecies are one and the same, they are each a piece of a much larger puzzle:
War broke out. A particularly powerful and disease resistant bloodline started to collect dragons. They lived longer, healthier lives. Eventually it got so they had many ""Elders"", thus many chances to hatch, and many strapping young males that could bind them. Through Evolution there came a dominant house. More dragons=More Power. The only hole I have is the existence of ""other magic"". Greenseers, Wargs, spells at the wall.... Unless they are all revealed to be traced back to ""Rhllor""....
Maybe the world decided that these families were too powerful and that order had to be restored... then through the laws of balance, other families would develop coping mechanisms to defend themselves. Greenseers would be able to scope far away, safer, lands, and could make the Journey there. (Now in most cases retreating to a Northern, Icy region to be left alone for awhile is very cowardly, but not entirely without Honor....) In fact, we can assume that the ""Stark"" family was very honorable and in fact very smart. They built the wall to ward off the mass of growing undead their rather large and rather safe family started accumulating. In fact, they built an underground memorial to them... I can see the Stark tomb leading all the way to the wall and passing under... ;) The undead wildlings are Stark ( and possibly other....) ancestors. I forsee one being able to help explain all this.... In High Old Valaryian of course...
Other families were smaller, but no less powerful. The Lannisters had a dragon or two, but very few had other skills. The Reeds are a Stark shootoff that must have been interbreeding Greenseers. The Faceless men aqquired a type of Camoflauge, but became vigilante because of their lack of dragons and small family size. Now I could go into detail about each family, and who they probably came from and what they developed... but the main ones are Stark, Targaryen, Greyjoy, etc.
Targaryen seemed to be the biggest, strongest family. They were known to interbreed siblings, so whatever genetic abilities they had must have been strong and select. I don't think we even know what those with Targaryen blood are capable of. They might be able to master all the abilities, or they may have multiple... Jon seems to be a warg, but what if he is also a Greenseer and gets the kiss of life? becomes a red priest?
To continue with the overall arcing theory...... Surely this ancient Stark ancestor North of the Wall lives in a fortress. An Icy escape for the original Starks that had to be abandoned and is now a Zombie kingdom. He would have artifacts and relics from Old Valyria in nerd-gasimgly like new condition. I'm talking Pure Valyrian steel swords, horns upon horns to control legions of dragons. Enough to Jump start a select few distinct new bloodlines... Maybe the prophecy is even very clear on that one: 3 horns left= 3 heads to the ""dragon""..... This undead Stark could be just waiting to see who figures it out.... This Stark would have to be very powerful, he would be a Warg, a greenseer, a priest, etc... Probably a renaissance man of juicy power...
One can only surmise that he's keeping these undead youngins under his control somehow, and eventually he can't keep up. The prophecy is that someday ""Winter"" will come, and the Starks are painfully aware of this.. White walkers are becoming independent.. We've seen evidence of the newest ones having independent thoughts and following the lives they used to have, yet in the beginning the White walkers had a hive mentality, and only showed themselves in defense or upon ambush... With Bran in the North, fudging around with the trees and shit, its only a matter of time before he interrupts whatever control ""Old Stark"" has on them.. In fact, I foresee him trying to take over ""Cold Hands"" and messing everything up. When the White Walkers start flooding South, the King who goes North and figures it out will win. By showing their strength to ""Old Stark"", they gain a horn. Now whether or not they are able to keep it, or even know how to use it depends on them...
Three live dragons, Three Horns, Multiple families all in a race.
Now this is all my speculation. I'll be honest, I don't even believe half of what I wrote. It's half Fan Fiction, half plausible thoughts. When it comes to GRRM, and ASOIAF, you really can't throw out any theory.... no matter how fucked up it is...
Now this house would start to explore/unite/dominate the world. If you had dragons, and could literally control their minds, nothing is out of your reach.

This is concerning Jon Snows parents. I haven't noticed anyone else mention this... But then again I haven't really looked too hard. Anyway I thought it was interesting so tell me what you think, skip to the TL:DR if the wall of text scares you.

[Speculation](/g ""The R+L=J Theory claims that Jon Snow's parents are actually Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark. Ned Stark Claims that Jon is his bastard to protect his sisters honour, and to protect his sisters son because if Robert found out that Jon was a Targaryen then he would surley have him killed."")

[ADWD](/b I thought of two points to potentially prove this theory as false. The first is sort of petty and doesn't really prove much, but my second point is where I think the theory really falls apart. First point: Jon's hair is black. When we get the reveal of Aegon in ADWD we find out that he is dying his hair to hide his Targaryen traits, namely his purple eyes and silver white hair. This interested me, considering that Aegon's mother was a Dornish women with olive skin and black hair; the Targaryen genes seem to be dominant. Jon snow has black eyes and black hair. If Rheagar were truly his father, wouldn't Jon have white hair and not black? George R.R Martin puts so much emphasis on how much Roberts bastards look like him as opposed to Cersei, it would seem odd for George to break that pattern with Jon. I don't put too much faith on this point alone though and I could easily just be talking out of my ass. Still, its something to consider"")

[Speculation](/g ""Fire does not kill a dragon. This is what Dany says as Viserys dies from the molten gold that Khal Drogo spills on his head. Viserys was a Targaryen, but he was still a mortal man. I'm sure if we dunk Dany's head in a pot of molten gold she would die too. She does however show a resistance to flame, which if Jon was a true Targaryen, would show that ability as well. But he burns his hand in the first book. Not only does he burn it, but the wound never seems to fully heal. It isn't shown much in the show, but through the first book George describes the slow painful healing process of Jon's burnt hand, and throughout the series he is constantly flexing his sword fingers as if to make sure that his hand still works. Dany can stand in a pyre as its burning down, so if Jon had even half of her Targaryen blood you would think that he would be safe from a little burn. Not only is it burnt, but George seems feel the need to remind us nearly every Jon chapter by having Jon flex his sword hand, reminding is that is was burnt and it is still affecting him."")

[**TL;DR**](/b ""Jon Snow has Black hair. Emphasis throughout series of bastards taking their fathers traits. Jon Snow's hand is burnt in A Game of Thrones. Fire does not harm the Targaryens. Viserys' death probably would have killed Dany as well, lets be honest, but Dany can survive flame where as Jon got badly burnt from a lantern and George makes it very clear at multiple points that Jon got burnt."")

Im going to be working all week and I wont be able to afford the third book for a while so im a bit anxious to see where things are going to go considering the absolute devastation at the end of aCoK.

Winterfell is all screwed up :(
Everyone is dead :(
King's Landing still belongs to the Lannisters and Joffrey is STILL ALIVE! During the riot after Myrcella leaves for Dorne I thought Joff was going to get torn apart (Brotherfucker- brilliant!), then during the seige I thought he'd be taken out and finally I thought one of the captured knights would get to him when he gets a booboo from the iron throne.

Theon is a total bastard too, though I enjoyed the way the book toyed with Bran and Rickon being dead before revealing there's a limit to Theon's brutality (though he still killed some kids..). It saddens me that Theon being a POV character makes it less likely that he'll be killed because he certainly deserves a good stabbing.

No word from Stannis or Davos, either. The Hound pussed out, and we still haven't heard from Ser Barristan.

I honestly can't imagine where this story is going to go when there's still 3 books to read and two more after that! 

On a side note, I'm still massively enjoying the show for its deviations and original scenes (Tywin and Arya, Yoren's death)",47,6,False,self,,,,,

I only made my account recently, just so I could get a snazzy House Martell flair.  This is my first reddit post.  Now, out of curiosity... 

-How many of us started reading George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire book series after watching Game of Thrones, the HBO-produced original TV-series? 

-On the other side of the coin, how many of us began reading books before watching the television series? 

Personally, I fall into the first category.  I had heard great things about the show so I caught an episode just playing live on HBO at home.  It made no sense but I had the feeling that it had been extremely well thought-out and that in order for me to understand it, I would have to start from the beginning.  This may sound hilarious now, consider how absolutely OBVIOUS it is to every single person who connects to this series, whether by books or by TV, that the story can be appreciated only in full and without spoilers.  So I whipped out the newly released HBOGo and got to work.  I just finished Dance with Dragon and am looking to start The Hedge Knight books.  Now I feel like it's all backwards.  I originally started reading the books because I didn't want to wait a year for the next season to start but now I am looking at the TV-series from the perspective of the books.  Part of me wishes I hadn't done that, another part of me feels that GRRM developed an incredible series that taught me how to be a much better reader. In the process, I also learned how to find the time to read alongside my regular commitments.  This will be required reading for my kids.  What were your experiences?

tl;dr: saw the show, read the books, woops I spoiled everything for myself, but still obsessed.

Here is why I think it's not only possible, but it's the best and possibly only option they have.

First I'll list what they cannot do. They can't do it the way that GRRM did it and remove half the characters, then go back in time to cover them in the next season. It would obviously piss off a lot of fans (which happened with the books, though I liked them just as much as the others), which would mean that they would run the risk of getting the show cancelled. That's not something GRRM had to worry about when he wrote them that way. I realize that's debatable, but I don't think the David and Weiss would want to risk it none the less. Another thing they won't do is combine all of the characters and then cut the combined stories in half like SoS for two seasons. They won't do this because unlike SoS there is no place for a clean break in the seasons. It would just be incredibly sloppy.

So we know what they likely will not do, so let's discuss what they will do and how they will do it:

I believe the only option they have is to combine both books, and ""cut the fat"" from the stories and just make it all one season. They can do this fairly easily, really. Remove the parts of the books that don't progress the overall plot in any meaningful way and just sum the events up using other characters who talk about what's going down. Basically anything that happens in Dorne can be cut and summed up with a scene or dialog. And then there is the hard truth: POV characters will have to be removed or have their screen time GREATLY reduced. Characters like Areoh(spelling?), Sam and his journey, Victarion, Quentyn, and Arianne.

All of their characters arcs and stories aren't central to the main plot (at least just yet) and can easily be summed up by giving them brief scenes or simply have another character tell us what's going on with them. Also take into consideration that they will likely need more story to pad out season 4, since a great chunk of book 3 will be in season 3. They could possibly move some of these story lines forward to the end of SoS (season 4), or push some back to the season after FfC and DwD.

If you look at it like that, you can see how that would not only be possible, but it has the potential to be a seriously kick ass season.

Thoughts? Do you think it's possible, or do you think they will have a different approach?

Qhorin tells Jon to kill Ygritte, and instead Jon decided to let her go.  Fast forward to the Frostfangs, and Jon ends up killing Qhorin to convince the wildlings that he ""turned"" when in fact his allegiance is still with The Night's Watch.  Then, Jon and Ygritte's love/fuck story buds from all this, and we get lots of sexy time.  I can't seem to figure out how they are going to do this correctly in the show?  Or can they still?

Granted, the overall arching plot seems the same, there seems to be a whole bunch more changes.  

What disturbs me most is how Jon was captured by the wildlings.  I thought the run with Qhorin from the Frost Fangs would have made an excellent TV scene, but instead we got more Ygritte.  Granted, Qhorin might also conveniently be captured and given the opportunity to make Jon swear to join the wildlings, but still...

Just as disturbing, the Reeds are nowhere to be seen, and it looks like they are planning on replacing Jojen's knowledge of Bran's dreams with Osha.  I suppose they still have an opportunity to be introduced, but it seems like an unnecessary change.  The Walders are missing as well.

Also, there were no Daenerys scenes.

This is likely due to much of 2x08--perhaps even the bulk--being Dany in the House of the Undying. A description of the episode from [*Vanity Fair*](http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2012/03/emilia-clarke-daenerys-danny-targaryan-game-of-thrones-season-two-slideshow#slide=8):

&gt;Last resort: When she realizes the merchants of Qarth are interested only in obtaining her dragons, Dany considers accepting help offered by a warlock. But to reach his leaders, the Undying Ones, she must travel through a complicated stone maze and face mental and physical challenges.

By showing any Dany scene in the trailer, the show would likely spoil the **utter and total craziness** that the House of the Undying is going to be for non-readers, so the best thing to do is to ignore it entirely in the preview.",2,4,False,self,,,,,

I understand that it must be shocking for the book readers cause it was agamechanger and kinda unexpected                                                
However,for the TV show the twist fell flat because of 1 reason: Sean Bean                                                                                          
How is it that with him acting,most people did not see the twist                 
I mean,its so obvious about him that I bet anybody that if they told a person who knows NOTHING about GOT that ""something happens to Sean Bean at the end"",that the chances of them making an accurate guess would be EXTREMLY high.                                                         
If the whole idea of the Ned Stark character was to attach ourselves to him as the central figure and thus make the twist effective,Sean Bean gave it away at the get go                                                        
So my question to non book readers who found the twist shocking is this:

Now, if something came along that felt out-of-place, I might take issue with it but so far all of the changes have been pretty interesting and in keeping with the tone of the series.

I understand that language is very important in the world of ASoIaF [ASoS Spoiler](/b ""especially for Dany when she wants to buy the Unsullied""), and I think the conversation between Stannis and Davos nicely highlighted Davos' struggle with being a lowborn smuggler who has been lifted up to be a lord, but the rest just annoyed me.

I was wondering how Theon managed to capture Winterfell so easily?

First of all, he is apparently able to attack Torrhen's Square, a more significant outpost than the fishing village he was originally meant to raid, with only one ship and a small crew of mean and rowdy sailors. Then he somehow defeats the relief force sent by the Starks, takes Winterfell, captures Ser Rodrik, and is now in control of the North.

Theon's theme is a perfect example.  The music when he returns to the Iron Islands has long drawn out violins, swelling like the sea.  Pure majesty.
When he takes Winterfell, the theme begins to change.  Suddenly the violins become shriller, the tones stretched and twisted with each new infamy, particularly when Rodric is beheaded and the burned children presented to Winterfell.  Listen carefully, and you will hear the difference.  I find this a brilliant touch, the music changing along with Theon's descent into betrayal and a certain kind of madness.

I advise non-readers to avoid this thread completely. This thread will have huge spoilers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/tn5nh/spoilers_all_extreme_edition_asoiaf_readers_we/,newbstorm,1337033827,"
There is a trending problem with our stewardship of the series. While I believe we do well at hiding spoilers as it is, there are going to be moments in the series where our mere discussion of them will ruin the major events and character developments taking place. These are largely the vast number of cliff hangers that GRRM uses at the end of each book and thus season.

I think we should refrain from discussing these as child comments and in image links; and personally, the more extreme topics should really be left in r/ASOIAF. This will improve the concealment of our topics and is a necessary tweak to make this a more enjoyable subreddit for the non-readers. The community is already doing great at this, I just proposal this pact because of the upcoming episodes.

[Book Spoiler](/b ""After all, we did well in not discussing the fate of Bran and Rickon. I honestly felt that the readers were stepping back from the discussion completely and just observing the non-readers' talking about it, at least in the official episode discussion thread. However, in the following days we have had a relapse. We have made comments that do spoiler their fates in child comments and pictures. We shouldn't be doing that. It really puts the community at odds and it goes against our position as stewards."")


In the upcoming episodes there are going to be similar situations that may not be answered this season or even the next. We shouldn't ruin that tension for the non-readers. They should have the opportunity to be emotionally abused by GMMR just as much as we were when we first read the books.

[Book Spoiler](/b ""The Blackwater is next episode, if Tyrion saves the day like in the books. The non-readers are going to see a connection with Eddard, a beloved major character dies in the same arch as the previous season. We shouldn't discuss him just below others in the comments, we shouldn't hint at how he doesn't get his nose cut off or anything like that. Whenever Theon is written out of the books, the non-readers shouldn't even have a hint that he becomes Reek in future seasons. To us, it is a sad and pitiful story. To them, it will be divine justice until they realize what really happened. We shouldnt tamper or hint at these twists."")



If we do, we should only do it under a parent comment that already contains spoilers. Hijacking a non-spoiler comment with a full thread of spoiler discussion will tamper with the non-readers discussion and perspective. If we approach cliff hangers and spoilers like this, it will improve this already great community. More importantly, we will get to see their untainted torment. ",12,81,False,self,,,,,

Ok so today I decided to go to the local library to get the books.  Noticed they were all checked out, no biggie I'll just put a few on hold.  Now as many of you know the series is actually called ""A song of Ice and Fire"" and I don't know the names of all the individual books, other than the first is called ""A game of thrones.""  

Now in the description of the first few books I looked up on the library computer it would start off like this "" The second book of the series this X, Y, Z"" I'd usually just read up till it said what book it was in the series.  Well I'd planned on putting the first 3 on hold.  I was looking for what the third was called and I saw ""A feast of crows"" so I glanced at the description to see what book this was in the series, and this was the first fucking line: [Book Spoiler](/b ""After Robb Stark's death, X, Y, Z."") 

WHAT THE FUCK.  You sons of bitches.  You dirty, book loaning sons of bitches. I told the guy at the counter about this and he said it was actually the publisher's description of the book. Anyways, after that I almost got into a fight with some douche with tattoo sleeves that apparently thought I was looking at him wrong at the gas station, and then they got my order wrong at Sonic's that  I didn't notice until I was home. -_-  Needless to say today has not been a good day.

2478,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2012-5-15,2012,5,15,13,tnq5i,self.gameofthrones,[Spoilers for All Books and Episodes] I'd like some discussion of a theory about the casting of Ramsay Bolton that's been picking up steam,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/tnq5i/spoilers_for_all_books_and_episodes_id_like_some/,[deleted],1337057813,"As a number of people have said, with varying degrees of seriousness, it seems possible that the reason that there's been no announcement of casting for Ramsay Bolton - even though he seems like he *must* appear this season and afterward - is because *he's already shown up*.

I submit to you that Ramsay Bolton is none other than ""Dagmer Cleftjaw,"" the lanky Ironborn fellow who keeps telling Theon what to do.

The case:

- First, there have been significant and strangely unnecessary changes to Dagmer's character from the books.  The cleft is all wrong (though admittedly a difficult make-up effect to pull off), and he's been changed from being a hardy, roughly genial, rather old guy of whom Theon had many fond memories to a young, ominous sort of dude that Theon's never seen before in his life.  In the books Dagmer Cleftjaw comes along with Theon and then goes down to hold Torrhen's Square; as of ADWD, he's still there, and has never been significant at all since then.  The TV series has him staying at Winterfell, though, and making his presence known in every episode.

- The way he's introduced in the TV series is odd.  If ""Dagmer"" is actually the real first mate of that ship, why did his men not seem to pay any attention to him at the docks and just row away without him?  Of course, once he gets on board, if he's an interloper they'd probably ask him who the hell he thinks he is and what he's doing there.  Since he arrived with Theon in the first place, it would be very easy for him to just say something like ""King Balon sent me to keep an eye on his idiot son"", which they would have to agree was probably a good idea.

- On the Winterfell end, even though Reek plays an important part in Theon's time at the castle during *A Clash of Kings*, he's nowhere to be seen in the TV series.

- The big objection to any of this would be: ""If this is really Ramsay Bolton, why was he on Pyke to begin with?""  I have no firm answers, but can offer some speculation.  We may consider that we only have TV Roose's word that Ramsay is supposed to be ""at the Dreadfort"" right now; he could really be anywhere.  Still, if we are to assume Roose is intent to play this game properly, I wouldn't be surprised if he had dispatched his bastard to treat with Balon Greyjoy, just as he himself has been secretly dealing with the Lannisters.  That way he'd have *three* kings trusting him.

- We've already seen TV Dagmer ""take over"" a couple of Reek's duties from the books - manipulative adviser to Theon, suggester of the body swap - so it makes sense that the show-runners have brought him up here for a reason, especially as there's no Reek to be seen.  If we still need to have that shocking reversal where Reek/Dagmer rushes off to find help to defend Winterfell from an approaching northern army, it could work out that Dagmer is sent off to go meet Yara and her Ironborn en route (assuming Maester Luwin even sent that raven to begin with) and tell them to come at once.  Instead he returns in his Bolton armor, with his Bolton host, flying the banner of the Dreadfort.  Things would then proceed much as they did in the book.

Admittedly this is all just speculative, but it seems to hang together as a theory.  If you can think of any holes in it that I haven't considered, I'd love to hear them.

In the meantime, next week's episode is apparently entitled, ""The Prince of Winterfell.""  *Something* is going to go down, and now that we know that Ramsay really will be in the series (thanks to Roose's revelation in 2x06), it seems safe to say that the coming Sunday might be the time for him to make his appearance - or to reveal himself.

We also know that if they bite/infect the living when they die they can turn into the wilding, like what happened to that guy who returned to the wall(and jon snow kills him).

So my question is yigrette and her people are wildlings and she even mentions to cut her head off because she might haunt him or something. 

1. Do all wildling turn into the zombie creature when they die?
2. Can the wildings still have a mind of its own? (since they do accept baby offerings...) 
3. Is it like a virus?

This will make things very confusing when Arya is somehow able to travel much further than him in half the time (making it from Harrenhal to the Riverlands).

2566,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2012-5-16,2012,5,16,0,tob9y,self.gameofthrones,[Spoilers All Books and Episodes] I'd like to get some discussion on a theory about the casting of Ramsay Bolton that's been picking up steam...,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/tob9y/spoilers_all_books_and_episodes_id_like_to_get/,NMW,1337095781,"As a number of people have said, with varying degrees of seriousness, it seems possible that the reason that there's been no announcement of casting for Ramsay Bolton - even though he seems like he *must* appear this season and afterward - is because *he's already shown up*.

I submit to you that Ramsay Bolton is none other than ""Dagmer Cleftjaw,"" the lanky Ironborn fellow who keeps telling Theon what to do.

The case:

- First, there have been significant and strangely unnecessary changes to Dagmer's character from the books.  The cleft is all wrong (though admittedly a difficult make-up effect to pull off), and he's been changed from being a hardy, roughly genial, rather old guy of whom Theon had many fond memories to a young, ominous sort of dude that Theon's never seen before in his life.  In the books Dagmer Cleftjaw comes along with Theon and then goes down to hold Torrhen's Square; as of ADWD, he's still there, and has never been significant at all since then.  The TV series has him staying at Winterfell, though, and making his presence known in every episode.

- The way he's introduced in the TV series is odd.  If ""Dagmer"" is actually the real first mate of that ship, why did his men not seem to pay any attention to him at the docks and just row away without him?  Of course, once he gets on board, if he's an interloper they'd probably ask him who the hell he thinks he is and what he's doing there.  Since he arrived with Theon in the first place, it would be very easy for him to just say something like ""King Balon sent me to keep an eye on his idiot son"", which they would have to agree was probably a good idea.

- On the Winterfell end, even though Reek plays an important part in Theon's time at the castle during *A Clash of Kings*, he's nowhere to be seen in the TV series.

- The big objection to any of this would be: ""If this is really Ramsay Bolton, why was he on Pyke to begin with?""  I have no firm answers, but can offer some speculation.  We may consider that we only have TV Roose's word that Ramsay is supposed to be ""at the Dreadfort"" right now; he could really be anywhere.  Still, if we are to assume Roose is intent to play this game properly, I wouldn't be surprised if he had dispatched his bastard to treat with Balon Greyjoy, just as he himself has been secretly dealing with the Lannisters.  That way he'd have *three* kings trusting him.

- We've already seen TV Dagmer ""take over"" a couple of Reek's duties from the books - manipulative adviser to Theon, suggester of the body swap - so it makes sense that the show-runners have brought him up here for a reason, especially as there's no Reek to be seen.  If we still need to have that shocking reversal where Reek/Dagmer rushes off to find help to defend Winterfell from an approaching northern army, it could work out that Dagmer is sent off to go meet Yara and her Ironborn en route (assuming Maester Luwin even sent that raven to begin with) and tell them to come at once.  Instead he returns in his Bolton armor, with his Bolton host, flying the banner of the Dreadfort.  Things would then proceed much as they did in the book.

Admittedly this is all just speculative, but it seems to hang together as a theory.  If you can think of any holes in it that I haven't considered - or things I've simply misremembered - I'd love to hear about them.

In the meantime, next week's episode is apparently entitled, ""The Prince of Winterfell.""  *Something* is going to go down, and now that we know that Ramsay really will be in the series (thanks to Roose's revelation in 2x06), it seems safe to say that the coming Sunday might be the time for him to make his appearance - or to reveal himself.

Seems an odd decision to me, and slightly stupid considering how persuasive and cunning Ser Jaime seems to be. Does he just think the Lannister cousin is infallibly loyal to their side of the war? 

Also, does Robb know about Theon's betrayal and seizure of Winterfell yet? (I think not, but I'm unclear on this.) If he does, it seems even more odd that he would shack up a Lannister with a hostage Ser Jaime when loyalty has been broken in the name of blood bonds before.

In the first season there were a few storylines, but it was mainly focused around Ned figuring out the incest, being imprisoned, killed, and the war starting with the death of Robert.

In ACOK, from each character POV I got a real sense of what was coming, especially Tyrion and Davos. It seems like Davos/Stannis have scarce been seen, and it's already coming up on episode 8 and Stannis' forces closing on the blackwater, or even planning to attack King's Landing has only been mentioned in this last episode kind of in passing. Obviously a 10 hour season can't pack in all of the detail of a 900 page book, and I kind of like that the show is changing some things to accommodate time/keep some excitement for readers, but the major preparation in Kings Landing has hardly even been touched upon. This was a huge theme in the books and IMO gave a lot to the tension and sense of urgency in ACOK. For Jon, the show still hasn't touched on Warging, they really haven't played up much about how the wildlings are massing a huge army and how ominous that really is. I don't know, I do enjoy the show, it just kind of seems like it's got too many storylines going on to really properly flesh them out, and I think it just gives the story kind of a lacking and disjointed feeling.",6,0,False,self,,,,,

[SEASON 1 SPOILER],https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/tp8dl/syrio_forel_speculations_for_nonbook_readers/,HunterHunted,1337132346," I've read the first book and seen up 'til S02E07.

Me and a friend have been discussing this back and forth a few times, concerning the fate of Syrio Forel. If you haven't seen the first season stop reading now. 

I know it's probably just wishful thinking, but I can't help thinking there might be a possibility that Syrio is still alive. You never actually got to see him die (unlike, pretty much every other character you've liked who's died and you had to explicitly see), and in the first book it's never specified that he dies either, it leaves it much as it does in the show, with Arya running away after his sword broke.

Now Syrio would pretty much be one of the most skilled sword masters in the world and I doubt a mid-level member of the Kings guard could easily take him down, with or without a broken wooden sword.

On the other hand 'the first sword of Braavor' would never run, and since one's heard nothing about a member of the King's guard being killed in the overthrowing of Ned, it makes his chances seem worse.

Is it possible that Syrio might have knocked him out and then fled? That he disarmed the man and backed away? 

Is it possible that Syrio is or has been a Braavosi assassin much like Jaqen H'ghar?

GRRM is a cruel god, and as such I have my doubts that Syrio's alive, but I feel like he was such an awesome character that was underutilized. Any thoughts?

**TL;DR:** Syrio Forel, did he actually die or could he still be alive?",23,2,False,self,,,,,

Am I missing something?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/tp8wl/adwd_spoilers_im_14_through_adwd_and_i_have/,callmecatalyst,1337132994,"So I've read the first four books and am now about 25 chapters into Dance with Dragons, and I finally have to lash out and rage over **Daenerys**. Can someone please explain to me if I should be upset with some of her choices or at least try to justify them? I cannot believe her arch on the fifth book has not put her on the right continent.  
  
* What in the SEVEN HELLS is she still doing in Meereen? Everyone hates her, she has an army, ships, big ass dragons. Am I missing something? I understand all the civil war going on between some of the cities that she conquered and abandoned, but staying in Meereen isn't going to solve anything. In fact it's just pissing off the people more and getting her soldiers murdered. She constantly says shit like, ""I'm only a little girl and know nothing of______, but..."" so I know she is somewhat smart if she can manipulate people frequently, but I hate this moral high horse she is on. It feels very similar to the Iraq War where George Bush went into Iraq, fucked shit up, and then didn't leave. He kept troops there and kept trying to force ideals down their throats and that only pissed them off more. This is the same thing happening in Essos.  
  
* Dany has constant advice from Barristan telling her, ""Westeros has never been more ripe for the taking."" Why isn't she going? The Realm is in panic and she finally has an army (not to mention ships and dragons). This is kind of the same point as before, but WHY is she so eager to stay put? Am I (the reader) supposed to understand her reasoning because she isn't explaining any of it.   
  
Daenerys has had arguably the least exciting POV for most of the books, but I stuck with her through wandering the Red Waste, going to and leaving Qarth (which ultimately lead to nothing except the House of Undying chapter), and all the sacking of all these slave cities. She is not a bad character, but I just can't help but feel like GRRM is giving his fans the finger so far in this book. She finally has all the necessary means to go to Westeros (HER ULTIMATE GOAL), but she's staying put. My guess is she is staying in Meereen for the sake of the plot (which kind of pisses me off), since a lot of characters are now in Essos and/or heading towards her. It's like Martin is just keeping her idle until he can get every other character to Meereen, which would be extremely lazy on his part if true.

My concern has to do with the fact that, in the book, her releasing Jamie is preceded by her finding out about the ""death"" of Bran and Rickon. Out of grief for their death she decides to try and save her remaining children.

From watching the show, it seems clear that she doesn't know about Bran/Rickon, so I don't see where the motivation is for her releasing Jamie. Granted, it is possible that the show is going in a different direction, but I don't see any other reason for her pulling the sword on Jamie.

All said, the change troubled me but I'll reserve judgment until I see the rest of the season.

Most changes between book and the TV show I can deal with, as they do not change the nature of the characters themselves. Usually I feel the series makes the characters more rich, if anything.

* I think Brienne's death was unnecessary. I had spoiled it for me before but I was still shocked that she really died. I'm seriously confused - everyone plays a certain part in this story. She did practically nothing after helping Jamie. And she had quite a long story after that! I was waiting for something to happen, something huge. Well, something did happen alright!

* Holy shit, Arya's blind. Fuck. This nearly kicked me off the chair. Also, the way GRRM describes it... Just one sentence. ""She woke up blind."" He could as well just write ""Fuck you.""

Let's assume Littlefinger has access to trained horses and can change mounts along the way, giving him an average speed of 50 miles per day.

Baelish is asked in ep. 3 to deliver a message to Catelyn Stark who is in Renly's camp somewhere close to the Stormlands coast (unspecified location AFAIK). Eyeballing a map of Westeros puts Storm's End around 350 miles from King's Landing. Stannis is likely to meet him further up north, but it is still a good number. Littlefinger would reach Renly's camp within a week, and we find him there in ep. 4.

Two episodes later he is in Harrenhal which--with some more eyeballing--is around 700 miles from Storm's End. So two weeks of travel. Taken into account that there probably passes more time during and between episodes than a week, he would have time for some sightseeing along the way.

I'm not actually sure), and where it is geographically in Westeros, but wtf is so special about it? Is it a normal badass castle-style city like Winterfell or Eyrie or King's Landing? Was it built on top of a gold mine or something? It feels like we've been everywhere *but* Casterly Rock, so it seems weird to have such little info on it.

The Trident I'm suuper confused about. There were battles, or maybe just skrimishes, during Ned and Robert's campaign to take the throne from the Mad King. But is it a place, or a city, or a castle? I can see where it is on the maps, but is there anything that makes it special? Do all the rivers and mountains just make it a natural strong hold, or is there another reason. I remember some line from King Robert about hammering some dude to death ""...on the Trident"", why isn't it ""at the Trident"". Or maybe I'm remembering that part wrong...

In Ned Stark's case, the positioning of the pin emphasizes how much he misses his wife as a result of reluctantly accepting King Robert's offer. In Tyrion's case, the positioning of the pin emphasizes how much easier he breathes knowing he has control over his family's situation.

That's my guess, at least. I'm probably just reading too much into it. Regardless, Tyrion wears it with a lot more confidence than Ned ever did.

Life and death, Fire and Ice, these are the central themes to A Song of Ice and Fire. Even the title supports the idea. The irregular summers and winters tend to balance each other out over time, with the exception of the Long Night. The central point of this theory is that White Walkers and Dragons are the avatars of these two polar opposites. They only exist due to magic. Dragons are fire made flesh, not flesh manipulating fire. They are intrinsically magical, and their mere presence enhances the local magical ""field"". Same with the Others. (minor spoiler alert) Melisandre realizes that her powers are enhanced when she reaches the Wall with Stannis, even more so than her time in Asshai. This is due to the awakened Others. Others exist due to Dragons, and Dragons exist due to Others.

I have seen some fans irritated by the fact that this happened, and how it was done in an almost off-handed way, though most seem resigned to these sorts of changes, and this certainly wasn't a major story change.  I think this is all very interesting, though, because of [episode 2.05](/s ""The scene when we first see Drogon breathe fire.  Not many people talk about this scene, but it was one of my favorites this season.  Irri is the last vestige of Dothraki culture that remains at Dany's side.  While Dany plays with her dragons with Doreah, who is not Dothraki, Irri repairs Dany's Dothraki clothing.  Irri is great in this scene, clearly feeling left out.  Dany is a Targaryen.  Dragons are Targaryen.  Irri is Dothraki.  When Dany talks about being sold to Khal Drogo, she is not speaking of a pleasant memory, despite her love for him.  Doreah and Dany commiserate on the idea of being sold to a man, but Irri immediately speaks a blessing to the soul of Khal Drogo.  Dany and Doreah look at each other, untouched and feeling, as Irri does, that they are not all of one mind.  Doreah says Dany would look like a real princess in the dress she was given as a gift, prompting Irri to angrily say she is not a princess, but a Khaleesi.  But Irri realizes the truth.  She had, after seeing Dany being a Targaryen, playing with her dragons with Doreah, mentioned all the work she had done repairing Dany's dothraki clothing and boots, expecting her to wear them to the party as she is a Khaleesi.  But in the end she realizes that the battle between Dany's foreign Targaryen blood and sensibilities, and her role as a dothraki khaleesi, had been won by the former, not the latter.  The battle between what Irri and Doreah represented to Dany in that scene was lost by Irri.  After her outburst, she says Dany should wear the dress because it would be rude not to, which was a line delivered uncomfortably because this was not in any way a dothraki sentiment; this was not how dothraki thought.  Irri was ceding the loss of her Khaleesi.  This cuts immediately to Irri and a Dothraki at the party, standing alone and apart, with Irri looking incredibly uncomfortable and out of place.  A few moments later, Dany has to stop her khalasar from stealing from the host, and laments about what kind of people the dothraki are to Jorah, even using something her vile brother said about them."")  While changes like this and the [episode 2.03](/s ""death of Rakkaro, her bloodrider""), irk some people for being huge changes that [aDwD](/b ""take away a lot of her khalasar that are alive in the books, I think this is a great way to come full circle to the 5th book.  By stripping away everything dothraki about her, having her abandon that history with Drogo and the horseriders and embrace a more Westerosi mode of queen, it makes her eventual return to the dothraki sea and to a khalasar at the end of her storyline in Dance with Dragons that much more of a RETURN.  To go forward, she must go back, and to truly dissolve all of her dothraki ties only to have her, seasons later, come back, will have an incredible impact on the show, I think.  It has slowly fallen away from her, to the point where Irri was the only person saying It Is Known, the echo of that phrase so common in the books and the first season dwindling until she was all that was left."")[episode 2.06](/s  ""Her quiet death in the series may seem underwhelming, but I see in it a lot more meaning that will not come to fruition for many seasons, later in Dany's story."")

It is a realm full of death, duty, lies, lust, war, winter, freedom and family. The central themes running through the song of fire and ice are women, power, death, and family.  These topics also intertwine with larger philosophical concepts like Nature vs. Nurture, Active vs. Passive, Continuous vs. Discontinuous, Universal vs. Individual.  This creates a rich tapestry of human development that intrigues the reader from the very beginning.  The events that transpire in Westeros are described through multiple different views of the main characters which gives us an in-depth look at how all of those elements make up the wide scope of the human experience. 
        When it comes to Nature vs. Nurture the first step is to look at the immediate family dynamics to observe what environment and what predisposition one has while growing up.  The most ancient of family lineages are the Targaryen's, who's house slogan is Born of Fire and Blood. To keep their line of successors strong they bred  in-between their own family members.  This resulted in madness being common in their children, ""They say the gods flipped a coin when a Targaryen is born.""-Tyrion Lannister. They knew nothing about genes or genetics and could not predict who would have madness in their blood.  With Daenerys and Viserys being brother and sister the question of nature; the madness gene inside them arriving from the incest of their ancestors, or nurture; being exposed to certain experiences throughout their lives.  How would one expect both to turn out?  We find out that Viserys falls prey to the Targaryen madness and it can be said that it was his nature that drove him there.  Yet, his sister Daenerys had different experiences from her brother and did not lose herself in the madness.  Instead rose up stronger than her brother showing us that you can overcome your nature if you have the right nurture and a strong will to fight. 
        Fighting and power rule over Westeros with such force that one must be active to survive, while the passive perish, ""You win or you die""-Cersei Lannister.  There are countless characters that are actively vying for The Iron Throne, amassing their own wealth, and just trying to survive another day.  Two opposing but connected characters who display the active and passive aspects of the human experience are Arya Stark of Winterfell and Sansa Stark of Winterfell, her sister.  Arya actively fights to return home after her father is killed at King's Landing, whilst her sister wishes to return home but cannot actively get there on her own.  Sansa takes the passive approach because she is scared and unequipped to face the horrors of the wide Westeros world.  These sisters are born and raised from the same parents yet they take totally different approaches to their situations.  This shows that different circumstances need different approaches. 
        Most do not survive the Game of Thrones.  While there are underlying philosophical assumptions of the continuality of life and the discontinuousness of death are prevalent  throughout George R.R. Martin's saga, he tends to plays with the idea of, ""What is dead can never die. But rises again, harder and stronger.""-Damphair.  Much time is spent on revenge for fallen family members like Ned Stark which displays how important family and lineage is to the people of Westeros.  Continuing the noble names of the House Stark, House Lannister and House Targaryen exposes the strong desire to be memorialized after death.  Yet, as the characters come to the realization that everything; your castle, your namesake, and your life can and will all come to an end.  We start to wonder; what is there to hold on too?  
        The answer is; that even though we like to believe that our world is stable, we must accept the actual continuous discontinuiousness of life.  To be aware of the moment and to live in the moment.  Not, as most people in Westeros lived, fighting to reach the top.  They do not recognize or accept their individual mortality and thus are never truly happy.  Maybe someone will remember their name five years after they die or even ten thousand.  But eventually even that will fade.  That is a concrete universal truth of the human experience.  Compare it to the individual phallacy that one could live forever and we see through the eyes of the Westerios' peoples that even the smallest individual effects the universe and the universe effects the smallest of individuals.   
        The Buddhists' of our world belie in interdependent arising.  Interdependent arising is the interconnectedness of all things in the universe which are always in a constant state of change.  Knowledge of interdependent arising can bring peace and joy to one who suffers.  This is one of the philosophical assumptions I have made in my own life.  In my view the concepts of Nature vs. Nurture, Active vs. Passive, Continuious vs. Discontinious, and Universal vs. Individual are all incredibly interconnected.  From my experiences I have learned that there is only one constant; change. ",5,0,False,self,,,,,

I'm a big fan of the show and have read all the books, and I play a lot of RPG's. That being said, I had fairly low expectations of this game after having played Cyanide Studio's last release, Game of Thrones: Genesis. That game was abysmal, and I could make an entire post detailing why, but that's unnecessary - if you've played it you understand. Nevertheless, this RPG version of Game of Thrones has definitely exceeded my low expectations. Which is not to say that it doesn't have serious flaws and feel outdated compared to more recent RPGs. It does. I'm just surprised that it got as much right as it did.

First, the good stuff. I'd say the greatest relief is that the story is engaging and feels like it was actually written by someone who has read the books. Apparently it was approved by GRRM and underwent several revisions. If you've followed the game at all you'll know that you play as two different characters and switch back and forth between their viewpoints by 'chapters' much like the books do. The game is set fifteen years after Robert's Rebellion, right before the events in the first novel. So far I've played only the first chapter for each character, but I've already encountered plenty of lore and references, and even some characters from the books - [minor game spoilers](/s ""namely Commander Mormont and Quorin Halfhand""). Getting to explore some of the areas from the books like Castle Black is pretty entertaining, and the environments actually feel fairly fleshed out and immersive. The cutscenes and dialogue are very detailed and generally stick to the nature of the books. Mors starts out on the wall, and so far his scenes are more action-oriented and focus on dealing with the wildlings and such, while Alester starts out in his hometown of Riverspring and seems to be more politically driven. I don't remember Riverspring from the books or show (and couldn't find it on the wiki either), so I assume it's made up for the game. However it's actually quite convincing as a town from Westeros, and exploring the Castle there has been one of the highlights so far. There are plenty of little details throughout to appreciate. My biggest gripe with the story so far is a couple of minor details that highlight the fact that this is still just a video game and not an entirely faithful adaptation... for example [minor spoilers](/s ""there's a scene where Alester communicates with his clergy via gazing into his fireplace, but its so literal that its as though hes talking to a hologram."") Things like this are so few and far apart, though, that they don't really break immersion. 

The voice acting, on the other hand, breaks immersion at times. The main characters are not terrible... Mors has a decent snarky growl that grows on you, and Alester sounds distinguished and intelligent. Almost all of the lesser characters are terrible though. Every now and then someone delivers a line in a way that will make you laugh out loud it's so ridiculous. Honorable mention to a couple of characters from the show here, though - Mormont is voiced by the actor that plays him, and the intro is read by Varys' actor. (He may play his character too, as I have yet to get to King's Landing and meet him). 

I would count the combat system as another success. Judging from the trailers and from Genesis' gameplay, I expected the combat to be a clunky piece of shit. It has it's moments of frustration... you have to be very deliberate in your clicking and selection to achieve the desired results, but once you've figured out how it works, it becomes more timing and strategy. Slowing down the battle is nice, and it makes sense as you have a lot of commands to give. The classes, abilities, and skill trees are varied and empowering enough to keep you interested in battle. One of my favorite little details is the names of all the abilities in the ""Water Dancer"" tree... they're little snippets you might hear from Syrio, such as ""Light as a Feather"" and ""Calm as Still Water"". 

Despite all of this unexpected win, I feel that players would be justified in complaining about this game because of some major drawbacks. The graphics, for one, are very last-generation. This is sort of a good thing for me as I can run it on my laptop at the highest settings with no framerate loss (something I can't say about many other games released in the last 2 - 3 years). But really, it feels and looks like something from 2008. The maps are relatively small. The menus are tedious and have plentiful annoying quirks. Windows often pop up over each other at just the wrong times, enough to annoy you. Buttons are strangely difficult to click, and you have to aim your mouse at the letters in the words to select them. None of this is so horrible that it makes the game unplayable, but it's pretty ridiculous given what year we're in.

Overall, this game is good enough that it manages to entertain me and that I want to keep playing. A large part of this is due to its re-creation of Westeros and the ASOIAF universe as opposed to its actual value as a modern RPG, but there are enough successfully carried out aspects of the game itself that it's an enjoyable experience, even if it feels like a game from a few years back. I would never recommend the game to anyone who was not already a fan of the books or show, but if you are, pick it up! I don't think a fan would regret it. 

Whatever you do, stay away from GoT: Genesis. 

**tl;dr: If you're a fan, there's enough to enjoy about this game that I would recommend playing it.**",45,57,False,self,,,,,

This will be full of spoilers for all books.

I was rewatching ""A Man Without Honor"" this morning and took a moment to pause and marvel at the character development in the show. Specifically, Benioff, Weiss, and the showrunners have done an INCREDIBLE job making certain characters sympathetic, and certain villains - especially to win the viewers love, only to later shatter it. They're doing some amazing development to build characters up and make us grow fond of them, or alternatively to hate them, only to pull the rug out from underneath us later.

There are certain characters which are blatantly painted one way or another, and this is necessary for the show; Arya is great and we all love her, and she will continue to kick ass. Joffrey is a little shit who everybody hates, and will cheer when he dies - they will see that coming.

But it's the other characters who aren't as black and white, especially who have deviated from the book in some sense, that I really enjoy watching:

Tywin Lannister - The show has made him into a very interesting, almost sympathetic character. He's certainly charismatic and powerful, but his 'softer side' with Arya has made him a fan favorite. I loved him in the books as he was written, but the show has made it even more interesting. I can imagine the impact when it shows his demise (I just hope they don't have Arya get Jaqen to kill him next episode...that would be an atrocity).

Cersei - The show has made her VERY sympathetic this season. Though her ultimate fate as we know it - shaved and shamed and on trial for her life - will come much later on, she will turn into a huge C-word as the story develops. The audience will go back to hating her.

Ygritte - Ahh, the way they are building her up. I enjoyed her in the books, but they've made her downright amazing in the show. That actress is fantastic, and I think everybody loves her. Her death is going to be a tearjerker for many, I'm sure.

Jaime - Short of Joffrey, could they make this guy any more loathsome? That INCREDIBLE seen in the cage with Alton looked like it was a turning point and a moment of vulnerability for him, and then it made him look like an even bigger villain. I fucking loved it. I cannot wait until he changes on his journey with Brienne. I feel like this is the most sweeping change in reader/viewer ""feelings"" on a character in the entire series (greater than Theon, because you dont really 'know' him until you start to hate him anyways). 

Theon - Well, they're doing nothing wrong here. He's following the book's path very, very closely.

Asha/Yara - They've actually made her wholly unlikeable. I don't see where this is going unless they write her off, but this is a small blemish on otherwise excellent development.

Dany - The show has made her more petulant and whiny this season, which is grating on my nerves, but I know it is a means to an end. She will become a fan favorite once again. 

Roose Bolton - I had to plug my favorite guy in here. I love how much they've added into the show for him. In the books it is alluded to that he's one of the top commanders under Robb, but they've really given him a lot to work with. By all accounts he seems like a good leader, loyal, and resourceful. The one slight little indication I've seen of things to come was the way he looked at Robb and Talisa when they were in the tent in Episode 7 - and especially Talisa's prolonged look at him, then expression when she turned back to Robb. I highly suggest people rewatch that!

So all that being said, I just wanted to say the creators have done a damn good job developing these characters. I don't always agree with all of the deviations in the plotline, but damn if it isn't a compelling show. It has been amazing this season!",6,2,False,self,,,,,

1. The casting info has said nothing but Jeyne for Oona Chaplin. Of course, this may be to hide the spoiler of a new character.

2. In Episode 7, Talisa and Robb just went to accept the surrender of the Crag. They hinted that Talisa would have some influence in getting this done.

3. It makes sense to add some intrigue like this to create a depth to the Jeyne Westerling story that is all but untold in the books. It allows them to show the romance for Robb and Jeyne, but also allows for a surprise to new viewers AND book readers when they have the reveal.

4. It DOESN'T make sense to just replace a pivotal character with another single character that serves the exact same purpose. And it couldn't be due to the name Jeyne, as Jeyne Poole is absent from the show.

Theories pretty much abound on how much [TV ACOK](/s ""Tywin actually knows about who Arya actually is""), but given the nature of the world, and the general actions of the characters involved, as well as [TV ACOK](/s ""Tywin's"") temperament and intellect, several guesswa can be made to narrow down the range of options.

[TV Spoilers](/s ""We know for a start that Tywin is an extremely intellectual individual, both cunning and well read.  We also know that until now he has almost certainly never met Arya, incidentally or otherwise.  Since he talks so much about legacy and the houses, and from we know from Bran's lessons in the first season that noble-births are taught extensively the names and mottos of the various houses, that he would have at least some familiarity with the houses in the various regions of Westoros, particularly since many of them are at war with each other.)  [Inference](/g As of 2x07, we also know that he knows that Arya is noble-born, given that she's both literate and smart, and familiar with many of the westerosian houses, a Northerner, by her accent, and clearly hiding something, by her general behavior and attitude."")

Now, the initial branch of the dichotomy is [TV ACOK](/s ""whether or not Tywin knows who Arya is or not"").  There are indications bending in both directions, though its obviously up to ones own conclusions as to which one is true.

[Speculation #1](/g ""If we assume that Tywin does not know who Arya is, then it's either he believes her to be either from a noble house he's not familiar with, or that shes telling the truth.  The latter is unlikely, given that weve already established that he knows shes hiding something, and the circumstances for her story are *slightly* too contrived to hold water.  Plus, with the general tone of the line Youre too smart for your own good, combined with the look on his face, its clear that he doesnt believe her story for a second, even if it might stand up to general scrutiny.  The former is likewise unlikely, given that one of the fundamental aspects of warfare is to try and know who exactly your enemies and allies are, and the general disposition of forces.  Having a familiarity with the northern houses would help give him a better chance of determining potential strengths of the different armies on the field, as well as some potential insight into things like morale, temperament, training, and the likelihood of a simple infusion of cash causing them to be delayed: something that we know Tywin is entirely capable of understanding, even if his subordinates fuck up the plans.  While theres still a chance that he might not be familiar with them, its lessened by the fact that we know Tywin has a tome of Houses readily available to him, and that would help narrow down the potential options."")

[Speculation #2](/g ""The other option is that Tywin knows exactly who she is.  How he came about recognizing her obviously hasnt been established, but it might be that he recognized her accent as being from the Winterfell area, and put two and two together.  The actual reasoning behind the position means less that the position itself.  Given what we have already established, this is not entirely outlandish, and doesnt hurt his position in the least to have her there.  After all, shes in Lannister possession, has no probably chance of being able to escape"") [ACOK Spoiler](/b ""Though we know otherwise""),[Speculation](/g ""given that the only ones who would be able to go in or out would be wearing Lannister colors or mercenaries, not servants, and means that the statement made about we have both Stark girls still true.  The doting attitude might be simple reptilian logic, coaxing little bits of information slowly out of her as time goes on, to potentially reach the point where she inadvertently reveals herself"").

(TV spoilers both seasons.),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/tv914/regarding_tyrion_and_eddard_stark_tv_spoilers/,blundetto,1337467098,"As the first Hand of the King to follow Eddard Stark, Tyrion naturally deals with many of the same people and brushes on some of the same issues that Ned did, at times I think even making reference to Ned's tragic mishandling of the job and sad deposition. Now, of course Tyrion always seems to have an air of propriety and woe about him, but it seems to me whenever the subject of Ned comes up he always refers to the man with a particular sense of reverence and respect. At times I even wonder if some of his actions are intended as a kind of retribution for Eddard, not because he had any personal relationship with the man, but perhaps just because he recognized that Eddard was in large part a humble and honest man, which I think Tyrion is keenly aware are traits possessed by extremely few in King's Landing. Furthermore, Tyrion seems to have a kind of poetic sense of justice and an inherent sympathy for the underdog that lends itself well to subtle (or not so subtle) jabs at those who would exploit people like Eddard who do not have the stomach for treachery, as well Tyrion is one of the few men in a position to address the people who directly contributed to Ned's death. 

Unfortunately I can't think of many examples, as it's not like it's in Tyrion's interest to openly or even covertly try to exact revenge for Ned's death, it's more just the way Tyrion looks and acts and talks with people sometimes when the subject comes up. I'm thinking of people like Littlefinger, Pycell, and Slynt, maybe Cersei or Joffrey to some degree. He also obviously has an amount of respect for Sansa, which I think is rooted in the same kind of sympathy for those who maintain dignity in the face of cruelty, and I think some of his respect for what Eddard was is translated into his appreciation for her.

Now, maybe it's just me, because like many Tyrion and Eddard are two of my favorite characters, but I thought maybe some readers or other observant watchers might also have some thoughts on the subject. Thanks for reading.

What I have a problem with is when they do deviations that make no sense with the internal consistency in the show.

In the name of the old gods and the new, why does Jaime murder his cousin? There is no point to it. He literally has no reason to kill him. His cousin could have easily pretended to be dead/have a seizure, and lure the guard in. So not only does he murder the one person that has been getting word of him back to his family, he also makes himself a kinslayer. Kinslaying and violating guest right are two huge cultural taboos. And for what, a half-assed escape attempt that could have been done WITHOUT killing his cousin. 

Did they run out of money to pay the actor playing his cousin to have the Pryat Pree duplicate-assassin thing? If they want to make Jaime look like a remorseless prick, fine. He does things on impulse all the time. But it was blatantly stupid to kill his cousin. It was also incredibly stupid of Torrhen Karstark to walk in like a dumbshit, but maybe the boy wasn't the brightest. Overall that scene was awesome until they made Jaime go full retard. /rant",27,18,False,self,,,,,

After that I don't clearly remember what was happening.  Ser Rodrik's forces were setting up to attack and suddenly he was killed by the other army.  And someone else (Reek?) came in and took Winterfell.

As the recent article detailing the 10 biggest deviances from the book pointed out, sometimes it's the small details that cause the most consternation amongst fans if they're left out. But the thing is, these small things are what makes the books great, and when making a series based on 1000-page books, you have to make lots of cuts. And one of the best ways of doing this is *cutting the small things*.

Renly's Peach is a great example of this. The scene is one of the best in the books, for many reasons, and is effective at getting the characters of Renly &amp; Stannis across in a simple way. Because in the medium of books, this type of scene is necessary. In television, though, they're able to constantly show each character's personality. 

Adding the peach would have been merely a nod to the readers in the audience, but the show is primarily intended for non-readers. It seems like a tiny detail that surely they could add in, but it's more complex than that. For the full effect, they'd need a scene later where Stannis reflects on that damned peach, and this is the type of thing that faces the guillotine when looking to cut for time constraints. Instead, being television, they were able to convey the same personality tension between the brothers by having Stannis be his usual grim self, and Renly being playful with ""Why is your stag on fire?"" and of course the ham line. All contained within one scene, taking no more than 3 or 4 seconds. Not to mention that the whole ""reaching for what everyone thinks is a weapon but is actually something comparatively silly"" is extremely cliche in television/film.

I hope this illustrates the reasons for changes (and why they're usually a very good thing) when adapting something to screen. Obviously expect things to keep being changed, especially (as I've seen some people worry about) [Book Spoiler](/b ""Arstan Whitebeard; this type of character concealing is pretty much *only* possible in books. The closest they'll get will be where the audience knows it's obviously Barristan Selmy, but Dany's never seen him before and Jorah's always like, ""Are you sure I don't know you??"""").",1,0,False,self,,,,,

I'm considering reading the Clash of Kings as I've watched the Game of Thrones tv series almost 5 times through now. As the story of the first series is one that I've repeatedly watched I've gone off the idea of reading the first book as it'd probably be the same story all over again. So instead I am considering reading the second book as the series hasn't finished yet and it is an interesting story line.

So my questions for you folk: 

How different to the tv series is the first book? 
What is different?
For the small sections I have read of GoT, the ages seem very strange, (Dany is 12 and Snow 14), is there a different age structure like in LOTR where 33 is the equivalent in a way to becoming 18?

Curiously, Tyrion also seems to think that the match would have been politically expedient given this quote (ACoK pg. 492-493) ""...I do not intend that you ever wed Joffrey. No marriage will reconcile Stark and Lannister after all that has happened, I fear. More's the pity. **The match was one of King Robert's better notions**, if Joffrey hadn't mucked it up.""

So I think it's clear how they're going to wrap up season 2 now, but I'd be interested to see how much of book 3 they bring in. My theories:

Jon: he'll fight and kill Halfhand and join the wildlings just like the books.

Dany: House of the Undying. I can't remember what her final chapter was in ACOK, but I'd imagine the visions she gets would be a good setup for season 3.

Tyrion: Lying in a bed wounded after the battle, but I wonder if they'll bring his demotion to Master of Coin forward. I think it would be great if they ended season 2 with Tywin denying Tyrion Casterly Rock.

Theon: Honestly don't know. It all depends on whether Ramsay is going to be making an appearance or not (I think he probably is). The actor who plays Theon teased his favourite bit was something in episode 10, so something big is going to happen.

Jaime: His hand getting cut off would be a good cliffhanger, and they've brought his story forward so it might make sense.

Davos: He could just be presumed dead after episode 9, and have his story pick up again in season 3. Or they could bring his first ASOS chapters forward and have him return to Dragonstone.

Now Game of Thrones is doing the same thing. Some of the best scenes from the book could easily have been done in the show this season, and instead they put in extra crap that wasn't in the books and doesn't particularly make sense. My wife convinced me to read the books instead of waiting for the television episodes, and now it's ruining the show for me. Every cool scene I anticipate is taken out. You would think that HBO would have hired someone to go through the books and identify parts of the story that are just too good to lose, but instead they seem to hire a bunch of shitty hack writers to butcher the story and leave only the bones. They sad thing is I know a screenwriter who is exactly that kind of person (I won't name names here) and I've seen how he looks at screenplays. One of his was made into a B-movie a few years ago, and he thinks he knows everything about screenwriting, but what he does is distillation, not writing. A real writer gives life to a story, rather than sucking all the life out of a story. Buying a book just to wipe your ass with it makes no sense. The fan base for this show is going to slowly dwindle as fans read the books and see how much they're changing the story. When you see lengthy, pointless sub-plots added, you know there was plenty of space for the real scenes, but they decided to do whatever the hell they wanted with it instead.

They gone? Good. My actual question is: Now that the dominoes are in place, how should we book-readers be preparing for the Red Wedding? 

I think we all agree that we want to make it a huge fucking surprise, in which case we should start sprinkling references to Robb doing stuff beyond ASOS (See title).

But if we're going to be posting stuff like

 ""I know everyone loves him now, but after Robb [ADWD Spoilers](/b ""took the Iron Throne, I started liking him much less"")"" 

then we should start doing so as soon as possible, not just a few episodes before the big night. It also wouldn't hurt to coordinate exactly what lies we'll be telling, in case anyone peeks.

We might also want to consider not mentioning Catelyn post-RW outside of spoiler tags, as her revival is about as big a twist as the wedding itself. On the other hand, once they see that all Robb spoilers were BS they might find it suspicious that we didn't do the same for Catelyn. Or mayhaps they'll decide we're lying about the Robb spoilers being lies, and expect both him and Cat to be revived. I honestly don't know.

What should we do, My Lords?

Long story short: **didn't read books, want to clear things and learn something more about what just happened, don't want to get spoilered?** Enjoy and feel free to ask further questions!


This one covers both episode 207 and 208 due to many reveals beign known to readers at this point of the book (Theon's thoughts revealed that the boys aren't Starks, Catelyn motives unable to talk about without revealing what she did to Jaime and so on).

**The Foster Home of the New-Born Antagonist**

&gt; ""NOOOOOOOOO""
&gt;  - Maester Luwin, prompting the viewers how to react to a Stark dieing two episodes earlier than in last season

&gt; ""I fucking KNEW IT!""
&gt;  - same, after realising these are not the boys he's looking for

Theon is beyond regular dickery now. He's approaching the level of Joffrey so quickly it's becoming dangerous for himself. There's some major ans some minor ""detail"" show failed to contain in the episode:

* Hunting party followed the direwolves first and their was the scent hounds were meant to track. In the books, direwolves go separate ways with the boys and buy them some time. And at this point of the book it's quite sure: Bran can control his direwolf in sleep.

* Along with Osha there was another prisoner in Winterfell who has sworn allegiance to Theon, a man called Reek (because of his smell). He was the one who did the whole flaying and burning. Screen time and the whole brutally-murdering-young-boys thing ruled that one out, probably.

* ""Heh, Hodor"".

* Roose Bolton told Robb he'll send his bastard son Ramsay Snow for help - Dreadfort, home to the Boltons, is close, but east of Winterfell, so it takes some time to send a raven and get an army to siege Winterfell. Not to mention the whole matter of ""Winterfell is unpenetrable unless its lord is a 10-year-old boy who gets rid of all soldiers to be a nice guy like his daddy was"".

* Biggest plot change: death of the boys was soon widely known. We'll discuss that later.

* Readers see Theon's thoughts, so the cliffhanger of his chapter is the revelation that the boys are not Starks: till then it's clear they're dead. Luwin dicovers the ruse just by examining the bodies, the scene subtly referred to that: the body of ""Bran"" has healthy legs, while a boy crippled for over a year would have skinny legs with barely nothing but bones and skin.

* The crypts are the last place Theon would go down into because he's afraid of going there. Also, there's already a grave with sculpture of Ned Stark, that is waiting for his bones.

**Chastity Ops of Alaska**

&gt; ""You know nothing, Jon Snow""
&gt;  - Ygritte, making readers jizz in their pants along with that poor bastard

&gt; ""Obsidian!""
&gt;  - Samwell, ready to open portal to the Nether

In 207, the cold bloody North story became a two-actor masterpiece that totally did not happen in the book. I think I've already thrown all the facts readers would know so far in the last post. Anyway, something that was just a simple scene of ""I can't kill you, run and go home"" became a dialogue lasting for two episodes. Episode 8 sets it back to the point where book was.

* Repeating after last followup: It's not Iceland in the books, there are trees there. In the show, the Badass Glacier North looks like that just to show us it's north of the Craster's Keep, which is north of the Wall, which is north of the Green Weirwoody North, which is north of pretty much everything else. And there are wildlings north of where Jon is. Easy, huh?

* Dragonglass was found earlier, by Ghost, and Jon quickly connected the black cloak with his uncle's journey. Possibly Sam or Mormont will connect the dots in ep 210, we haven't heard a word about Benjen Stark for a very long time.

* ""Lord of Bones"" is called by the Night's Watch and by his men behind his back ""Rattleshirt"". And that's all you're supposed to know so far. He surely looks badass.

**Riot Games**

&gt; ""I thought it's gonna be more flowery and less messy""
&gt;  - Sansa, about the TV show

&gt; ""They say Stannis never smiles. I'll get him a red smile - from ear to ear""
&gt;  - Joffrey, proving who's the psycho and who's Batman

The fan is about to get hit by shit. As you probably seen, every reader is hyped on the upcoming episode ""Blackwater"" and there's a fair reason to: Lannisters are gonna get stagged soon. So they spend their time mocking or comforting each other, depending on the mood.

* Shae helping Sansa was fine, but seeing the ex-Stark trying to burn down her bed would be more impressive. The Hound informing Cersei is a bit confusing, as his part at the moment is being the only good guy among the scoundrels of Kingsguard.

* Bronn's dialogue about thieves highlights what I tried to clear in the last followup: the true problems of the city under siege. Nice to see how a three-man dialogue described the situation better than any action on the streets would.

* The medallion that Cersei found in Ros's possession was given to her at the beginning of season one. That's not backgorund book info, that's me getting pissed Ros is getting more screen time than Melisandre.

* Thanks to av4rice: In the books, since Ros doesn't exist, Cersei instead apprehends a high-profile prostitute named Alayaya. Alayaya worked with Varys to help Tyrion hide Shae in King's Landing early on. So a big reason Cersei suspected her was because Tyrion kept visiting her brothel (where he was really visiting Shae). This spooks Tyrion because his real lover was just one step further from the person Cersei actually found.

* Podrick Payne is Tyrion's squire and he's the only man in King's Landing the Imp trusts in the book. Bromance with Bronn is adorable, but a man as clever as Tyrion wouldn't trust a sellsword, would he?

* Varys actually answered Tyrion's question. Rewatch the scene. Also, we get a reminder about another important fact: Quarth is really, really far away. Even Varys and Tyrion seem to treat Daenerys's threat as distant.

Speaking of.

**Creepy Skinny Oompa Loompas Town**

&gt; ""Find my dragons!""
&gt;  - Daenerys, ignoring everything her bear kinght said

&gt; ""They are my children, and they are the only children I will ever have""
&gt;  - same, friendzoning poor Jorah into oblivion

It's difficult to throw trivia about Qarth that's completely irrelevant to the story presented in the show. Too much plot points have changed to discuss this. At least Daenerys has a reason to go to the House of the Undying.

* House of the Undying is said to be the dwelling of warlocks. Plural. Expect nasty magick. What kind of? Depends on CGI, it looks like ep. 209 took 70% of CGI budget for this season.

* Qarth maintains control over a very important strait, the only way to the Jade Sea. I think the name ""Jade Sea"" says enough about distance and culture. Xaro taking control over Qarth means Xaro taking control over a big fat chunk of money and power.

* Quaithe (the BDSM tatooist) is a shadowbinder from Asshai (place so far southeast that it's probably on the other hemisphere). That's what everybody called Melisandre before the term ""red woman"" appeared. Quaithe's religion, abilities and possible connection to the Lord of Light isn't known yet. Well, about abilities, either she's a spy or some kind of psychic, as you see.

* In the books Quaithe joins Team Dany on the Red Waste and speaks with the Stormborn herself, warning her to trust noone, including Jorah. After they enter Qarth, she disappears for long.

Oh WOW it was amazing!

The end has a massive surprise that completely blew my mind. It's awesome to play and hear about all the things going on in Westeros (it starts a little while before the TV show and 1st book, and then runs parallel until the end.

It's so entertaining to hear about how the ""bastard of Eddard Stark"" is doing such an awesome job sparring, or uncovering hidden secrets about the events of the books/tv show.

The final few moments of the game though completely destroyed me, I was sitting in shock and awe as they progressed.

Near the end you are able to choose between whos ""destiny"" you want to fulfill (Mors or Alestar), I chose Mors, and all I have to say is: [TV Spoiler](/s ""What the actual fuck Alestar? Thought Mors and you were bros man."")

Actually, I also want to say, [TV Spoiler](/s ""Fuck Tywin Lannister, guy is a douche."")

For all those who love the books/tv shows, I implore you to try this game. It's not as graphically impressive as Skyrim for example, but really, how many companies have the budgets of Bethesda? I can honestly say I enjoyed the story of this game far more than Skyrim.

If you've got any questions about the game please let me know and I'll do my best to answer them! Or if you played it, please let me know what you thought of it, I tried to make as many of my choices being merciful, I can't help but be nice to people in games when I'm given the choice &gt;_&gt;.",15,2,False,self,,,,,

However when something is marked **Book Spoiler**, it's useless to those of us currently mid-way through reading the books. With the order of events being shuffled around, and parts of SOS being included in Season 2, discussion may delve into books further than the series has progressed. for example a few times i've read comments in the middle of COK discussion regarding [SOS](/b ""Jaime's hand"") marked as just **Book Spoiler**. I expect there are plenty of people who have read up to the end of COK but haven't got around to SOS yet who might see a **Book Spoiler** in discussion about the current episode not expecting to read about events in the next book.  

So here's my request: **Whenever you post a Book Spoiler, if possible, specify which book it relates to. If you're not sure which book it happens in, mark it ""All Books Spoiler"" or if you're not sure when it happened, be generous with your guess. eg. Not sure if [SOS](/b ""Jaime lost his hand"") in SOS or in AFFC? Either quickly google it to check or mark it AFFC to be safe **

However she completely refuted this arguing that he absolutely does not have charisma. ~~She implied that charisma is a quality which only good people have~~ but to me thats not necessarily the case.

I think Joffrey has some sort of charisma, maybe negative charisma but charisma nonetheless. I think its demonstrated by the way he makes his presence felt. He is ruthless, takes no half-measures and strikes fear into everyone present in the room. 

So my girlfriend went on to claim that I don't know what charisma means. I think I do. I know the likes of Quentin Tarantino and Jose Mourinho have charisma. 
Whilest Joffrey isnt the best example of charisma I think its arguable that he has some. She says Joffrey just has power. She says she wins the argument.

I want your guys' opinions and I'll see what the overwhelming outcome is.

Also **please dont mention anything from the books that hasnt happened yet in the TV series** as I havent read them. So base your judgement on what has happened in the TV series so far because thats all I have to go by!

Thanks.

EDIT She is saying now that she did not mean to imply that charisma is a quality only good people have. Her exact words were ""charisma is when a person is easy to love or to like"". Fair enough.  She says ""nobody likes or loves Joffrey"" therefore he does not have charisma. Thoughts?",12,0,False,default,,,,,

I have been thinking of this since I started reading the GoT books which I came to know from the TV show and wonder if any other feel the same. The problem is; when I want to read a fantasy book even though thousands of people may have read it, I know it is going to be a unique adventure and an experience for me because all of the descriptions of the environments and portrayal of the characters will come in to existence in my brain, the way I want it to. Especially with fantasy books this is so much more fun because sometimes the author also provides some art work and maybe the map of the world to go with my reading. With the fan arts created by inspired people, it's always fun to see how people imagined the world. All in all, it's an amazing experience... until, with very much what happened with Lord of the Rings, the movie iterations come to be. Now, for me, this totally kills the fun of imagining. Whenever I pick up the book now and start reading all I could think of is the places and faces of the characters from the show and when I look back, it's like I have never read the book but imagined the whole thing as the TV show in my head. It has absolutely left no space for me to create these characters. Not only this, with the TV show out, all the fan art now seems to be around the TV show's characters, instead of what people think they would look like if they were real. Anybody else that feels like this? Any advice? 

P.S : This subreddit would have been a much better place, in my opinion of course, if it was ground for people who read the book discuss and share how they imagined the characters would look like and discuss the universe instead of the TV show. (You can see the /r/gameofthrones home page is riddled with the scenes from it.)

Today I asked her how she's liking it, does she have a favorite character yet, et cetera. After some mild chat, she asked me if they ever figure out who pushed Bran out the window. I paused, confused, and we had the following exchange:


Me: You're halfway through?


Her: Yes. Who does it? Do they ever know?


Me: As I recall, it was evident in the chapter that it happened. It's been awhile since I read the first book, but that's how I remember it. Do you really want me to tell you who it was?


Her: No, I guess not. If I re-read the chapter you think I'll find out?


Me: Yes, I think so. 


A little while later she comes by again.


Her: Was it the king?


Me: I will tell you who it was if you want, but you're probably better off re-reading the chapter.


Her: No, okay, I'll re-read it. I mean, it sort of sounded like it was Jaime, but that's her brother.


Me: Jaime is her brother.


Her: Yeah, so that can't be it. Alright, I'll go re-read it.


I can't wait for our next conversation on this. I love that someone read that scene and thought ""This sounds like Jaime, but it can't be because Jaime's her brother, so who is this guy?""

As we have seen, the second season is not a direct adaptation of the second book, and the writers have no problem dropping in events from ASOS as we saw in S02E08 with the start of the Jaime and Brienne comedy tour.  We know that we're getting the Blackwater next episode, and Dany better bloody make it into the House of the Undying. But where do you think they will leave all the other stories? The lack of confirmed cast for certain roles might offer some hints. Here are my thoughts:

Jon Snow: [ASOS](/b ""Jon kills Qhorin and goes over to the wildling side - we know we won't get to see Mance Rayder, but perhaps they will go as far as to show a long shot of the enormous wildling army?"")

The Rest of the Night's Watch: [ASOS](/b ""It's been speculated elsewhere that the season will end with the three horn blasts and anticipation of the Others' attack on the Fist of the First Men from ASOS - I like this idea a lot, and I'm certain that we'll see that moment, even if it isn't the final scene"")

Winterfell/Theon/Bran: [ACOK](/b ""As far as I can tell we're not going to get Ramsay Snow, so I have a feeling that the Sack of Winterfell and Bran's eventual departure is going to get pushed back into Season 3, unless they come up with another way to get Winterfell in flames, and end Bran's story on that note"")

Robb/Catelyn/Army of the North: [ACOK/ASOS](/b ""I still suspect that Talisa is not all she appears to be, and that twist may be where they choose to leave Robb's story. Either that or a damn wedding. Cat remains locked up."")

Jaime/Brienne: [ASOS](/b ""I think we are done with their story for now. There will probably be a short scene to remind us that they are on their travels, but given all the other stuff that has to happen, there's nothing significant that they need to do before Season 3. I'm hoping for the river battle, but... it's unlikely"")

Arya [ACOK](/b ""Arya HAS to meet Jaqen one more time. I think there will be some more shenanigans regarding their escape from Harrenhal and a final scene involving the coin"")

King's Landing [ACOK/ASOS](/b ""Perhaps they will choose to leave us with a cliffhanger of whether or not Tyrion is alive after the battle? The Hound needs to desert. Will Margaery show up again? Ser Dontos' story may well have been entirely cut, despite his introduction at the start of the season. Or it may have been pushed to Season 3."")

Stannis/Davos [ACOK](/b ""Similarly, will they leave Davos' survival as a cliffhanger?"")

Dany [ACOK](/b ""Barristan Selmy's mention by Jaime the other week suggests that we are going to see him again, but I have my doubts about the House of the Undying sequence. Given the importance of Rhaegar and others in the visions, I have a feeling that they may actually choose to leave Dany's story on a cliffhanger IN the House of the Undying, rather than ending the season with her departing for Astapor.

There were 14 1/2 star reviews that pointed it some obvious flaws in the tv series (http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lvpgyrMqt21qdz3dz.gif)

&gt; but the plot line is thin to say the least and is padded out with lots of bloodied intestines, cut off heads and bedroom action to the point where it was laughable. I'm not saying I expected Shakespeare, but the script is dire and unintelligent - how many times do we need to hear the f-word? To make matters worse, the CGI is obvious and cheap-looking.
Basically it's like a randy version of LOTR mixed with Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Not for me I'm afraid and I know I am in the jaws of the minority here, but I cannot recommend this tripe, even for Sean Bean.

*Particularly liked the comment about the plot being thin, whilst we all enjoy GRRM's little fantasy boomdoggle I think we can all pretty much agree it is a bit thin and in need of padding out*

&gt;It's cliched and derivative. I guessed what was going to happen way before it did. Felt like the poor relation to LOTR, which at least had a plot set out within the opening credits.

*perhaps my favorite review, who in fuck has a good record of predicting GoT particularly those who haven't read the books.*

&gt;Like all the boring talky bits of the unnecessarily long versions of Lord of the Rings all strung hodgepodge together with unnecessary perverted sexual bits, including all the slurping noises, in case the visuals were not enough in themselves to make us gag and go running looking for a bucket to heave into.
Fun for every cretin, moron and the sexually perverted everywhere!

*Yeah you Cretins, Morons and perverts you know who you are*

Hey everyone!

I'm a huge fan of the TV show (haven't gotten started on the books, but will start very soon!), so I've decided to draw a picture of Dany. Although she's not my favorite character, I think she's really beautiful. Dat facial proportion. This was started as practice to get back into drawing.

Anyway, I'm thinking about drawing the other characters hopefully soon. Thanks for looking!

Someone posted something before about G.R.R.M. telling the writers that if they change character storylines too much, the fans will be confused and some of the more ardent fans will be disappointed.  I know a lot of the changes are budgetary and have time constraints, but there are some things that have my head spinning.  

My prediction is that after this season the series will have gone so far into left field that even fans of the book will have something to look forward to every week, which is commendable but a tad bit frustrating.

I also can't remember the last time I stood (I'm at work; Have to stand my whole shift) motionlessly completely engrossed in what's happening in a text. 

The entire battle I was conflicted, not knowing which side to cheer for. [duh](/b ""Once Cersei made it clear that Sansa would die if King's Landing fell, it didn't matter who won so long as Sansa didn't die. Suddenly I'm cheering for Lannister in the battle and hating myself for it, but absolutely loving and ferociously consuming every single word of Tyrion's battle scenes. And the end! The sounds of celebration and triumph mirrored so perfectly with the horror that Lannister still rules and the realization that Tywin and his cruelty have finally come to King's Landing."")

An absolutely masterful series of chapters. I wouldn't have changed a single word of it. Absolutely cannot wait to see this translated into a visual medium this Sunday. From what I hear, the series just goes uphill from here, so I'm even more excited for Storm of Swords than I was two hours ago. And it's all new from here, too! Double bonus. 

P.s. Yes, I realize the House of the Undying Ones comes before this, but this trumps it in scale and reaction.

I believe this may be a bit misleading, as that would suggest roughly 55 pages an episode for the next 2 seasons.  I am a huge fan of both books and show, but I think 55 is a little low, all things considered.  I would like to see a return to the 80 page ratio from season 1, meaning ASOS would end in the first half of season 4.  After that, who knows.

For me the possibility that Jaqen H'ghar's IS what Tywin thinks is the brotherhood just makes him so much more bad ass. This great powerful Tywin thinks there is a group of people taking out these people inside Harrenhal when all this time its just Jaqen H'ghar doing his job for Arya.

So far I'm about 200 p in to ASOS and I'm downloading S2E8 as I type this. 

Overall I have to say I'm really displeased with how Season 2 is following the book's storyline. Arya/Jaqen is disappointing. I'm confused as fuck about Daenerys's story in the TV show. Nobody has taken her dragons yet or killed her group in the books. Hunting for her dragons isn't the reason she went to the House of the Undying. Xaro didn't betray her in front of the Thirteen. Where I'm at in the books she and her Dothraki and her dragons are all safely on the ships and well away from Qarth. Uhh. Oh yeah! Jon Snow and Ygritte/Qhorin...Ygritte just comes off as an aggressive sex fiend instead of a cool Free person, and Qhorin just seems like a minor character instead of the fabled badass that he is. 

I understand that there is a LOT of plot and detail packed into ACOK but did they really have to deviate so much?? Anybody been keeping up with articles/interviews with the HBO writers/GRRM explaining this stuff?

I've implemented spoiler warning tags based on the new Link Flair system added to Reddit.  The system is still very new with limited options, and for now only mods will be able to add this additional warning tag.  So please continue to post just like you always have with topic title warnings.  When you see a red-flair spoiler tag, it's just providing ""additional"" warning.  It's my hope that as the system matures the whole reddit can move to title-flair spoiler warnings for all post titles.

Benefits of this new system:

* These tags can be added and changed AFTER a post is submitted, so there is no longer a need for ""please delete and repost to add a spoiler warning to your title"" (since title text is not editable after submission).
* They're consistent and obvious.  Hopefully the people who fail to notice the title text warnings will now notice the red tags.
* I can set the CSS to filter them.  The new UI has ""modes"" set up with various CSS-driven filters to toggle-hide post types you don't want, and I've added more modes for spoiler filtering similar to [Tower of the Hand](http://towerofthehand.com/).  

I've added the flair tags now as the first major step in the transition to the new UI.  The new filters need posts to be tagged to work, so it's good to start getting flair established early.  If you see a post mis-tagged or a post without spoiler warning that needs a flair tag, please report it or [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fgameofthrones).",21,69,False,self,,,,,

In this clip, I see a lot of small longships and no big galleys. Out in the distance is just darkness and no sign of the naval battle that should be going on at the same time as the attack on the gates. This leads me to believe that the whole battle might just be Stannis' forces landing on shore and attacking by foot. Remember, there was no mention of the chain.

I did hear somewhere that they constructed a ship for this season, but we already saw that last episode with the Davos/Stannis scene, so that ship doesn't necessarily need to be in the battle.

But you were well warned in the title. **PLEASE STOP READING IF YOU DON'T WANT SPOILERS UP TO THE CURRENT EPISODE.  Book spoilers only go through the current TV episode, so through the early parts of Book Three or so.**  I will use spoiler tags for anything past the end of Book Two/the current episode, and encourage others to do the same.

**Also,** I don't mean foreshadowing that was later easily explained, like, say, [TV Spoiler S2E6?](/s ""the House of Undying stealing the dragons, since that was thoroughly spelled out."")  

I finally got my parents to start watching the show (which they now love), so I've been re-watching from the start for the third or fourth time.  I'm only through the third episode with them, but already I've noticed so many.  I'm sure others of you have noticed many I've missed.  Without further adieu...

_______________________

What first started this was Catelyn telling Bran, ""You always look at your feet before you lie.""  So I rewatched the episode where Theon takes Winterfell.  When Theon asks Bran where Hodor is, Bran looks at his feet. He seems to be looking at his feet again when he says ""I've yielded Winterfell to Theon.""  

In S1EP1, Daenyrs gets into a bath.  Her servant tells her, ""It's too hot!""  At the time I thought she was just desensitized from what was about to happen to her.  

When Jorah finds out Daenyrs is pregnant, he suddenly has to leave, and says he'll rejoin the Dothraki horde later.  I didn't pay much attention to this and I had no idea why, until book four or five.  This also explains [Book 4 spoiler, TV Spoiler](/b ""Why Jorah suspected the wine merchant wasn't totally honest"")

Tyrion says he's visiting the wall and wants to piss off the edge of the world.  He later pisses off the wall.  (Minor one, I know.)

In S1E1, [TV Spoiler, future episode, book three or four spoiler](/s ""Jaime says he would rather die than live as a cripple."")

Finally, and this one is kinda weak, but in S1E1, Jaime mentions Robert ""fucks boars and hunts whores,"" and is later completely fucked over by a boar.  

I'm sure there are more that I'm forgetting, and when I finish the re-watching the rest of the first season I'll find even more.

It just amazes me how well thought out the book/show is, that they have so many little references like this, that can often seem like just witty dialogue at the time, but in fact foreshadow future events.",10,8,False,self,,,,,

Hello. I am editing my ASOS epub after discovering [Sigil](http://code.google.com/p/sigil/). I was wondering if any book owners can help me.

I Chapter 7, Jon, Mance's song is indented and italicized. The first verse is four lines, then a normal paragraph, then the second verse.

In my EPUB, everything from the second verse all the way to the end of the chapter is italicized, starting on:

&gt; Beside the brazier, a short but immensely broad man sat on a stool, eating a hen off a skewer.

I corrected the font styles and left just the song italicized. I was wondering if I'm missing italics made by GRRM for emphasis.

Same issue with Chapter 15, Jon, just after:

&gt; For when I am gone the singing will fade,

&gt; and the silence shall last long and long.


Thank you.

My question to you: **is it worth reading book 1 (Game of Thrones) of the series, having seen season 1 of the show?** I've heard they are pretty similar, and am wondering if I would be missing much if I skipped the 500 pages and went right to book 2?

I don't want to start to hate the series because I love the books, and vice versa.

Cons

Book will spoil the series for me.  I hate spoilers.
Book will be very different from the series and I'll be disappointed with the new episodes.

More Game of Thrones in all it's delicious glory.

The narrator is actually very talented, but it's the voices. Man, the VOICES. Gendry, along with many other male characters, sounds downright buffoon'ish , and although Tyrion is indeed portrayed as ugly in the book, his dialogue is read with an inflection as if he's some sort of obnoxious, slobbering ogre. 

I'm not sure which sort of British Accent their dialogue is read with, but the best way I can describe it is that they sound like the gruff 'Eh wot?!' villains from the Fable video game series.

I'm enjoying it slightly, but having also watched the series up until the current episode, it's causing me a great deal of cognitive dissonance.

I'm sorry if this has been asked before, but something has been troubling me for the past two episodes.

In season one, when Ned discovered that Gendry was Robert's bastard son, it seemed like it was something of a revelation. However, in Season 2, Joffery orders all the bastards killed. I can sort of understand the babies being an open secret that could be used, but Gendry seemed well concealed. How did Joffery/the King's Guard know who to kill if it was a secret Eddard had to work to discover?

In the books Cersei is queen regent until Joff comes of age (I'm assuming at 18), which makes her fairly important in the wheelings and dealings of what's going on in Kings Landing for the foreseeable future. 

In the show, with Joff being 17, is Cersei even mentioned as being the Queen Regent? Is Joff just straight up king? Would she only be regent for a year? [Book Spoiler(SoS)](/b ""Does it even matter?"")

Probably doesn't matter a whole lot, but I'm curious and haven't been able to go over the show with a fine tooth comb like some of you have.

THEN Jaquen gives her an iron coin and gives her information on how to get to Braavosi to become an assassin. I feel like they're just getting ready to cut her out completely. Her adventure doesn't feel nearly as epic as it does in the books. Thoughts? "")

Season 1 Episode 1.

a few things:

It took me a bit to get into it. For the first ten or fifteen minutes, I almost turned it off. Once they moved the story into the village and the Stark family is introduced, I got pretty interested.



But the things that stand out to me so far?

1. [TV Spoiler](/s ""The two incestuous couples are creepy! The uber-blonde (like, white-blonde, the one who says he's the rightful king?) is an ASSHOLE (Viserys). He's a creep! Such a creep! he doesn't care if his sister (Daenarys) is hurt ask long as he gets his army and his kingdom back. So disgusting."")

2. [TV Spoiler](/s ""The sister of this blonde man I mentioned above... I feel so bad for her. But the romantic in me wants her to totally fall in love with her new husband (Drogo) and he will protect her, etc. For her to be surprised with how much better off she is with him than around her brother. Also... I like her. She seems...strong, even though she's really quiet."")

3. [TV Spoiler](/s ""onto the NEXT incestuous relationship- the queen (Cersei) and her brother (Jaime) and their secret affair. I didn't like the brother from the start. But at the end when he shoves the boy (Bran??) out of the window? That boy is just a kid! (plus, he has a pet wolf!) he didn't mean harm. PLEASE TELL ME HE LIVES. (and grows up and slaughters that incestuous brother)"")

ONTO THE NEXT EPISODE.

Oh, and I really like the little Stark sister (Arya) with the dark hair.  She seems quirky.  Like she has more ""boyish"" attributes than ""girly"" like her sister with the red hair (Sansa).  She seems fun to be around. 


EDIT: can someone tell me how to make a spoiler tag, so I don't reveal anything to any other newbies?  Also, I decided to look up names to make this easier to decipher. 

EDIT 2: Just started episode two.  The short man is a boss.

EDIT 3: just finished episode two.  I'm ready to kill Cersei and her bitch of a son.  I love Arya, though.  Her sister is a sissy.

EDIT 4: just finished episode three.  I called my boyfriend, even though it's 3 in the morning, and told him that we need to watch this together.  My favorite scenes to watch are Daenarys, and seeing her stand up a bit to her brother in this episode made me downright joyful. I love Arya.  Cersei and Joffrey are total cunts, same with jaime.  I used to kind of like the King, but he's turning out to be more of a lazy drunk than anything.  Jon is really cool, and I like how down to earth the short man is. 

FINAL EDIT: my brother, as a gift several months ago, took my Nook and put a bunch of books on it for me.  I just discovered 4 ice and fire books on it (game of thrones, a clash of kings, a storm of swords, and a feast for crows)... I know what I'll be doing this weekend.",68,26,False,self,,,,,

GoT has ~800 pages. So that is roughly **80 pages per episode.**

Season two is also airing 10 episodes.

aCoK has ~1000 pages. Which would be **100 pages per episode**. That is a significant amount. That leaves out 1-2 chapter per episode (assuming they go with the same method of books to TV air time) which is bearable and perhaps that is why a few things have been left out.

aSoS has ~1100 pages. That is **110 pages per episode** (assuming they air 10 episodes). So again, if the time is measured as it is in season one, that is on average 2-3 chapters missed per episode.

[Spoilers: Show up to SE02E08; Books through the second one],https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/u7no8/others_think_that_season_2_differs_more_from_the/,goliath_franco,1338149230,"As I've been watching the second season of Game of Thrones, I think the writers have taken many more liberties with the story compared to the first season. I'm curious if others agree. And I'm not in the sub, so I hope this hasn't already been discussed to death. 

One example: In the second book, Tyrion shows up in King's Landing and promptly begins preparing for siege. In the HBO show (SE2E08), he's seen trying to come up with last minute, ingenious way to defend the city. As a result, he appears less skilled as a strategist. Also, if I recall correctly, having the pyromancers make greek fire was his idea originally in the book. 

The biggest example is probably Rob's invented love interest. And in SE208, he actually goes for it. This change actually puts his character in a different light: He acts on desires that break his vow to marry the Frey girl. Compared to the book, he's not as honorable and more impulsive. Or maybe this happens in a later book. I've only read through the second one.

And the show writers seem to invent whole scenes with no real purpose. In SE2E08, there's a scene between Tyrion and Varys on the castle walls. They begin to converse and it seems Tyrion has a play he wants to make. But the conversation goes no where and only serves as a transition to the next Qarth scene. The conversation between Tyrion and Varys provides no new information or character development.

* If the wildlings and men of the North are remnants of the ""First men"", who are the other inhabitants of Westeros?

* The Wall and the Black Watch both seem to predate the founding of any of the Seven Kingdoms. What is the story behind it? Was it just to keep the White Walkers at bay? How old are the Seven Kingdoms?

* On ""Valeyian steel"": I assume Valyria is a ""magical"" city in Essos, like Qarth?

* What is the relationship between Essos and Westeros? Did the Targaryan Empire include any of Essos?

* What about other areas we have heard about, like Braavos and Pentos?",48,36,False,self,,,,,

And who are you, the proud lord said, 

That I must bow so low? 

Only a cat of a different coat, 

That's all the truth I know. 

In a coat of gold or a coat of red, 

A lion still has claws, 

And mine are long and sharp, my lord, 

As long and sharp as yours. 

And so he spoke, and so he spoke, 

That lord of Castamere, 

But now the rains weep o'er his hall, 

With no one there to hear. 

Yes now the rains weep o'er his hall, 

And not a soul to hear.

Backstory (not really a spoiler):

When Tywin was still young, the Reynes and Tarbecks were powerful houses who openly disobeyed their liege lord, Tytos, Tywin's father. Tytos was a weak man, so they though they could do what they pleased. Tywn decided to sort that out, and now nothing remains of the Reynes and Tarbecks, and their castles are desolate ruins.

It was incredibly well written (thanks George!).  But the actor's took those scenes and gave the performances of their lives.

* Sansa giving the snark to Joffrey was hilarious.

* Lena Headey acted *the shit* out of Drunk Cersei.  Those scenes with Sansa and then later Tommen were brilliant.  Lena was just so good tonight.  I was a little disappointed by her in earlier episodes of this season.  Some of her lines just seemed forced.  But tonight was spectacular; she stole the show.

* The Hound and Bronn were both incredible.  I love the screen time they've given to Bronn, excellent choice.  The interaction between the two of them was amazing.  Sandor really showed the effects of the fire well, and I know this subreddit has loved his lines to Joffrey and Tyrion.

* Obvious props to Peter Dinklage.  The man is amazing. Tyrion's rallying of the troops really stood out to me as one of the better scenes in the entire series.

* Stannis standing stoic as shit and then later getting into some badass fights on the front lines.

* Even Ser Illyn mean mugging was well done.

* FUCKING VARYS IN THE BEGINNING MAN. ""I've always hated the bells.""  Honestly, Varys has a ton of fantastic lines and dialogue in GoT.  But his opening lines in this episode were the best he's ever done.  

* They really set the tone of the war from the first scene of the episode.  It had the eerie quality that they were able to translate so well from the books.

* Jack Gleeson was great as an insane and later scared Joffrey.  That's par for the course because he makes us hate him like a pro.  Incredible stuff.

* PODRICK.  I wish they spent more time developing his relationship with Tyrion this season, but I'm so glad they included him in this episode despite that.

* Davos was only in about the first 20 minutes of the episode before the explosion, but he keeps on returning excellent performances.  That is a great cast, and one I was skeptical about at the beginning of the season.

I think this might be my favorite episode of the series.  Brilliance from start to finish.  I couldn't be happier with tonight's episode. ",1,4,False,self,,,,,

The show has been emphasizing how much the Hound kind of looks after Sansa (saving her from rape, giving her his cloak, etc.), and his admission that he wouldn't hurt her was a really great way to build up his character even more.

Basically, this makes me really excited to see how they're going to treat his part of the story from here on out. I'd love to see more of him before [ASOS](/b ""He has his run-in with the Brotherhood, and then the EPIC fight with Beric."")

In the book we obviously get more details but I really felt that the music for this was spot on and reminded me of an epic LoTR battle where I'm actually nervous for the characters. 

What did everyone else think? The music is probably well done for every episode, but I just really noticed it in this one.

Seems like she was kind of an important character.

HOWEVER, they're also making Sansa obscenely sharper than she was at this point in the books. Book Sansa was just quietly trying to survive until her brother could liberate her, but TV Sansa is actively and effectively conveying burning hatred to Tyrion and trying to manipulate Joffrey's ego so he puts himself at a higher chance of death.

Likewise, Margaery has been shown to be a hungry power player instead of noviate to the Game of Thrones (""No, I want to be *the* Queen""). I felt like her cell scene in AFFC amounted to a dawning realization Cersei was out to get her rather than a ""lets put all our cards on the table"" reveal.

In the book Jaime dealt with the sword, Tyrion did the strategy and only fought when there was no other choice. In the show it seems like he's not the incredibly smart tactician like his father is. I understand the budget concerns and all that, but the Battle of the Blackwater was so meticulously detailed in the book and everything led up to that chain that I was just a little disappointed in the show. Stannis fleet should have realized something was wrong when they only saw one boat. In the book, it seemed like a regular battle and Stannins Fleet thought they were winning until the chain fucked up everything.

I saw the Lord of the Rings trilogy and thought they were great movies, but never had the desire to read the books. Truthfully, I'm just not really much of a fan of fantasy books but there is something about GRRM's writing that draws me in and makes me want to read the books.  

The way he takes likable characters such as Tyrion and puts him in the Lannister family which creates situations where you want the family to lose, but at the same time want Tyrion to win (Blackwater as an example).  I also really enjoy how he develops certain characters like Danny, who seems to be less important at first, into main characters and show how their characters grow. 

I'll probably read the first two books while waiting for season 3. I am curious to see what others here like or dislike about GRRM's writing style and what others who watched the show first think about the books?

It got me thinking back to an interview David and Dan did prior to the airing last night in which they specifically gave huge kudos to the sound design team.  

They mentioned in particular a ""very big"" sound that the book readers would be familiar with ( I thought [](/b ""the chain"") but I was wrong), so when I watched the episode I was listening very closely for sound effects.  

There is a really good one when the wildfire goes up, but it sounded to me like they reused that one effect upwards of three times during the cuts?  I'm telling myself it's because the cuts were showing different close ups of the same explosion, but did anyone else even notice what I'm talking about?  

**Edit&gt;** Apparently there's confusion over the sound effect I'm talking about.  When the wildfire explodes there's a sort of expansive winds of the flame type sound.  It's a bit hard to describe, but if you listen for it I'm sure you'll hear what I mean since it happens a couple of times in quick succession.  ",4,9,False,self,,,,,

Okay. 

When she [spoiler](/b ""leaves harenhall without cutting that guy's throat or throwing the soup that got hundreds of people murdered"") i really started to worry they might be nerfing her character, especially since i don't remember Jaqen saying anything about owing the red god in the books. I'm kinda worried they might wipe her whole [spoiler](/b ""House of Black &amp; White magical assassin training"") destiny out of existence. I also didn't see him [spoiler](/s ""give her the coin""), though i haven't watched last night's episode yet so i'm hoping they throw it in there somewhere.

I've heard that some storyline's like Theon's are getting altered a little bit for the tv show, and no one cares about Theon anyway, but this seems like a severe neutering of one of the coolest characters in the series. Has anyone heard if this is official/intentional?",6,0,False,self,,,,,

I agree - concerning the first 55 minutes of the episode.  But did anyone else feel that ending was actually poorly done?  

In the books, Tyrion gets slashed, and then there's the sense that all hope (for the Lannisters) is lost.  You never get that feeling of desperation in the show.  Sure, Cersei might be feeding Tommen the nightshade, but, aside from Stannis, very few Baratheons made it over the wall, the gate has not broken, and the Red Keep itself never appears threatened.  So to me it felt totally false that Cersei was ready to kill Tommen, and it robbed the ending of its drama.  Why did the show keep cutting to the door of the throne room?  It was clear (even to the non-readers I watched it with) that Stannis' men weren't about to break in.    

Secondly, cutting between the fable of the stag and the battle was disorienting and made the show lose what could have been an incredibly powerful moment.  After the adrenaline rush that was the wildfire and Tyrion's speech and Podrick House of Payne, I didn't give a shit what childish things Tommen was mumbling. Imagine, instead: Loras (who is supposed to be one of the most skilled warriors in Westeros, but all we've seen in the show is him getting owned by Brienne and nearly killed by the Mountain) shows up in Renly's armor.  ""For King Renly!"" his men shout, and charge Stannis' men from one side.  Stannis' forces are scattered, with Loras doing Hound-level destruction on whoever he sees.  Then, from the other side of the battfield Tywin and his knights appear and finish the romp.  Loras and Tywin meet in the middle of the battle, and shake hands.  Then we know that the Lannisters have made an incredibly shrewd tactical move, Stannis is seriously fucked, and Robb is probably fucked as well.  How much better would that have been than listening to Tommen prattle on?

I told them it's hard to talk about the plot without spoiling it but it's set in medieval time in a fictional world with some magic and mystical creatures but not as many as Lord of the Rings. It's a period of civil war and several different families vying for the throne. Very interesting characters and a good story.

My fear is that if I have them watch episode 1, they won't be willing to give episode 2 a go. I know for me, I watched episode 1 and it was kinda ""meh"". I thought to myself, ""Could be interesting maybe but I'm not hooked"". I went a month or two without ever continuing and eventually boredom + people saying that GOT is good got me to revisit it and watch episode 2. I think after the 3rd or 4th episode I was hooked. But it was a very rough start. Others also admit that the first episode is pretty slow going.

The series had lacked the sheer epicness of its literary counterpart (A Clash of Kings). Certain major (or at least major for me) plot points have been watered down or completely missed, such as Renly's death and the scenes between Jaime and Catelyn.
I really don't know how HBO are going to carry on making a series like this. Those who have read the books will know how epic in scale they are, they are the kind of books that need big budget treatment.
For example: the battle in episode 9 of season 2. The battle lasted one episode and looked pitiful, the only scene I was impressed with was the Wildfire owning Stannis' vanguard. I know I may sound very picky and snobby about allof this but when I see an adaptation of an epic series of novels, I expect an epic adaptation, would Lord of the Rings have sufficed as a tv series that looked like it was struggling on the budget? No, because it would have lost the epic elements.
I admit the dragons look awesome but they only in a scene for no more than 3/4 minutes at a guess. 
Don't get me wrong though, I have enjoyed the series so far and do look forward to the third. If I had watched the series and not read the book I have no doubt I would be bumming off it something awful, but reading the books has set high standards in my mind. 

I do have a feeling that the show may be cancelled due to the budget. There are bigger battles and bigger creatures to come. 

Well, thank you for reading my rant. This is something I have wanted to get off my chest but there's no one in my circle of friends who's into A Song of Ice and Fire. Please leave comments as I would like to read your opinions.

However I have noticed some discrepancies with the character descriptions in the show and the portrayal of characters in the show. The biggest one I noticed was **Catelyn Stark**. 

In the show she's a cold woman but still benevolent and *somewhat* even headed. In the books however she seems a bit more blunt and foolhardy and a bit more crass.

So I guess my question is three pronged. **who are the characters that were cast with the best-matching actors for their portrayal; what actors don't do justice for how the character is described in the book; and which actors vary most from the book to the show in your mind?**",17,9,False,self,,,,,

 I don't think anything could happen to redeem Theon.  Unless, I don't know, he had small parts of his body cut up in tiny pieces over a long period of time.  Or maybe something that involves skin. (this one is almost verbatim)

 I have a funny kind of feeling Robb isn't safe or will die soon.

Something like, ""The plot is really complex with great characters and yeah... You'd really like it!"" Which in my opinion is just not good enough. So I was wanting a description of the show which is short, concise, eloquent and easily copy and paste-able.

And of course my biases are right there in my flair, so I make no claims to be objective in this matter.  I'm not going to argue too hard about this; instead I'd like to hear from the rest of r/GOT.

It seems to me there are only two people among the contenders who have a true claim to the Iron Throne.  Robb Stark and Balon Greyjoy don't even want it, Renly had no claim at all but reached for it anyway, Joffrey is a fake Baratheon.

That leaves Stannis and Daenerys, who is currently very far away, but is intent on pursuing the throne in due time.

Overall I was actually very impressed how close the TV show kept with the books - and while reading, i kept a few notes along the way to share.

*  As expected, the amount of background information in the book was impressive.  I feel as though I understand quite a bit more about the history and the major players.  It can be difficult to keep up with ""who's who"" in the show and how they are connected.
 
*  Casting in the TV show has been spectacular - Tyrion and Jorah especially.

*  I didn't know that Lord Mormont (Old Bear) at the Wall was the father of Jorah Mormont.

*  Maester Aemon is a Targaryen?  Not sure if I missed that in the show.

*  There was a connection between Arya and Jon Snow that was mentioned a few times in the book.  Clearly they had a close bond and it was sad that the TV show wasn't able to show that more.  I liked how they were bonded by the fact they didn't quite ""fit"" into their family.

*  I was shocked to find there was an entire battle with Tyrion and his Hill Tribesmen (Stone Crows and Moon Men, etc).  I'm guessing others were quite annoyed that they omitted this battle instead knocking out Tyrion so they didn't have to show it.  

All in all - I think they nailed as much of the major (and some minor) aspects of the book as they could in the time allotted.  I'm going to re-watch season 1 again and then start on reading ACOK to see how they compare (which it sounds like it differers quite a bit more than AGOT).

But for a series that is careful about every little detail, some things bothered me last episode.  mainly it has to do with scenes of the battle.

1.  For a place where the Throne and the King resides, why the hell are the walls 15 foot high instead of 50.  I know it was the ""Mud Gate"" and it is the weakest gate, but come on, the richest family in Westeros shouldn't be guarded by a wall that can simply be breached by a ladder!

2.  I know many people have talked about this and it is due to being main characters and to prevent confusion, but every main character basically doesn't wear a helmet during battle?

3.  Tyrion tells the Hound to meet them outside of the gate to fight.  In any other battle for a gate in any other movie, the soldiers are already outside waiting for the attack.  It just seemed strange to me that the gate was opened and closed during the fight.  The Hound, and Tyrion/Cersei's pet cousin who got shot just waltzed back into the gate while fighting was going on.  And at one point all of Kings Landings' soldiers retreated inside and they were able to just close  and lock the gate just in time before Stannis' army forced it open?  Come on...

4.  Last, Tyrion's chick, the foreigner completely butchered bowing down to Cersei which lead to her saying"" you've been here 10 years and can't even do that correctly"".  You think Tyrion, who I think is the smartest guy in the show, would have gone over that with the woman he loves since he knows she is in danger.  Also you think he would have gotten her new garments so she wouldn't stick out.

I know I am nit-picking, and I am not trying to show up the series in any way.  I absolutely love this show and a big reason is due to how careful they are in details.

Earth has seasons because the moon keeps the axial tilt of the planet stable at 26.5 degrees, and the seasons are caused by the changing orientation of the hemispheres of the earth relative to the suns rays over the course of the planet's orbit. Without the influence of our moon, the axial tilt of the planet would vary wildly from 0-90 degrees, and the variation would be chaotic. If the planet of GoT had a circular orbit (so as to remove it from affecting the climate), and no moon (or a small moon), the planet would have a similar wild procession of the axis of rotation, which would cause not only chaotic seasons, but also 'long nights', caused by extreme axial tilt. If the planet wobbled to the point where it was almost on its side, one could imagine an orientation where the planet was rotating parallel to it's orientation to its sun, where one hemisphere would be in total darkness and one in complete light, until the wobble eventually righted itself.

The only problem with these ideas are that 

1. moons are mentioned in the books. this would be tolerable if the moons mentioned were sufficiently small enough or far enough away to not gravitationally stabilize the planet, except

2. tides are also mentioned :-/

But then when she traded everything+Drogon for the Unsullied, and she told the slave master that dragons aren't slaves and slashed his face with the harpy whip...I was like, oh hell yes.

&gt;Fake spoilers designed to ""protect"" show-watchers from knowing the truth about current show events are fine, but posting false spoilers about future events is not ok.

We've noticed a trend of these popping up. They can range from posting fake ""broken"" spoilers (i.e. ADWD Spoiler (/b ""It's awesome that Hot Pie becomes King Beyond the Wall"")). We've also noticed submissions coming in like ""Let's talk about Character X in Book 6"" followed by just a bit of text saying ""Just trying to make people believe that this person lives until this book""

The distinction comes in the clause:

&gt;Fake spoilers designed to ""protect"" show-watchers from knowing the truth about current show events are fine

This is to distinguish the above examples from the recent developments like with [Season 2 Episode 7/8 Spoiler](/s ""convincing everyone that Bran and Rickon are dead."") Cases like this are still fine, and welcome. However, they must be show-current, not in a few episodes or seasons.

START OF SEASON 2:

Joffrey is a douche

Sansa is trapped

Cersei is a bitch.

Robb is out doing *something*

Stannis is gonna come kick some ass

AFTER BLACKWATER:

Joffrey is a douche

Sansa is trapped.

Cersei is a bitch who has shown she's willing to kill herself.

Robb is out doing *something*

Stannis is now pissed and has to go home/do some spooky shit with Mel in order to be a threat again.

I get that the whole draw was the battle, but the battle *didnt change anything*. Book-readers, please assure me that the episode actually has some consequence going forward, and isnt just a filler episode.

EDIT: I should note I know what Robb is up to, but there's like a 500% chance he'll find an excuse to fuck off back to winterfell, and not go into Blackwater II: Electric Boogaloo, simply because the show lacks the budget to do it.",13,3,False,self,,,,,

Littlefinger's dagger that was used in Bran's assassination attempt. He said he lost it to Tyrion, but it becomes clear he is lying when Tyrion tells Catelyn that he would never bet against Jaime.

Baelish orchestrated the whole thing to further the distrust between the Starks and the Lannisters, that much is obvious...

So, my questions are: How did the dagger end up in the hands of the assassin? Did Littlefinger ever actually wager the dagger in a tournament? and if not to Tyrion, then to whom? and what does Littlefinger have to gain by pitting the Wolf and Lion against each other?

Of course, I ordered it immediately and started listening to the amazing music of Ramin Djawadi. This morning I go on to see how it was being rated, and leave a review myself. Low and behold, I can't find it. 

So I google it to see what the deal is, and find that the release date has been pushed back to June. 

I'm very glad I managed to get it last night. The music is breathtaking, just as the first season's. There are quite a few familiar themes throughout. In fact, it doesn't feel so much like a new cd as it does an extension of the first. 

My absolute favorite: Track 6: Winterfell. So bittersweet, just like Goodbye Brother from the first season. In fact, they could be played back to back and you wouldn't be able to tell where one ends and the next begins. 

TL;DR: iTunes released the Game of Thrones season 2 cd early on accident, and I snagged a copy.

Do you agree with me that they should try to this more/to a greater extent in season 3? Danys story could have been condenced to 2 or 3 episodes this season. I don't need to be reminded every week that she exists, if they aren't going to do anything with her character. And the episodes work better as stand alone chapters in a story if we get a small arc for the characters instead of them just all popping in to say hello.

[SPOILERS] As a vagabond, he wandered the riverlands until he was captured by the Brotherhood Without Banners, which also had Arya Stark in its custody. The Brotherhood put Sandor on trial for Lannister atrocities. He chose trial by combat and defeated Beric Dondarrion, despite the fact that Dondarrion fought him with a flaming sword, after which The Brotherhood stripped him of his gold and set him free. Sandor returned to retrieve his tourney winnings, but kidnapped Arya Stark instead, with the intention of ransoming her off to Catelyn. However, just as they arrived at the Twins, the Freys attacked and killed Robb and Catelyn Stark. Arya and Sandor escaped, and headed east. At a roadside inn, they met three of Gregor's men and Sandor was seriously injured in the ensuing fight, though all of Gregor's men were killed. His wounds became infected and Arya abandoned him in the forest.

The head of a nearby monastery claimed to have buried ""The Hound"" after encountering him dying on the riverside, leaving his helm atop a stone cairn. Meanwhile Rorge, a particularly nasty criminal, obtained Sandor's helm and assumed his identity during a brutal spree of banditry. This led to stories that the Hound was still alive and terrorizing the riverlands. Rorge was later killed by Brienne of Tarth and the helm was then taken by Lem Lemoncloak, a member of the Brotherhood Without Banners.

There is a theory that a silent and hooded gravedigger at the monastery called Quiet Isle which Brienne spied limping is in fact Clegane. The Elder Brother slyly tells Brienne that he buried the ""Hound"", which means that Clegane may still be alive and living at the monastery now after chosing a life of redemption, while his brutal personality of the Hound is now done with. The presence of ""Stranger"" on Quiet Isle, Clegane's steed which supposedly no other person could handle, strongly supports this theory.",7,2,False,self,,,,,

Okay, so in the book, Tyrion uses a great big chain to catch a bunch of ships in his wildfire trap.  This idea never felt comfortable to me.  There were a bunch of ships, being pushed downstream, against the chain, while on fire...

The basic question is - how big does that chain have to be in order to not break?

In order to make your job a little easier, I've tried coming up with the numbers for you.  (We'll also ignore the wildfire for the time being).  But of course, these numbers weren't so easy to find.  SO -

1) There's no map with a scale for King's Landing, but it *seems* from descriptions to be roughly analogous to the river Thames in London.  London Bridge is **265 meters**, so we'll say that's the length of the chain from tower to tower.

2) It is crazy difficult to find a simple KPH/MPH for a river since they're all measured in gallons discharged.  One of the best answers I could find is ""a brisk walking pace,"" so I guess around **4 MPH.**  Then again that doesn't include the mass of the water adding to the pressure exerted, so if you want discharge, **5,696 million litres/day** is average near London.  

3) It's also confusing just how many ships are caught up against the chain, but it seems to be around 8-12 main vessels, and maybe a few smaller ones.  [13th Century Cogs had three classes](http://www.abc.se/~m10354/mar/cog.htm); under 10 tons, 10-24 tons, and the lovingly vague ""more than 24 tons"".  I'm going to say there are 5 Cogs at 35 tons each, 3 cogs at 18 tons, and 4 more vessels at 8 tons.  175t + 54t + 32t, or **261 tons** worth of ship pressing against the chain.  

So we have a 265 meter chain, supporting 261 tons of ship, being pushed at 4 MPH by the river.

If you don't actually want to do the maths, but have a pretty good idea of an estimate - is it even remotely possible that an iron chain big enough could have been constructed that would hold up?  (Also, anchoring the chains in the towers without one end or the other ripping loose?)  Or are we talking about a chain that would have had to have been like 10 feet thick?",7,1,False,self,,,,,

When Ned finds her as well she says 'Promise me' which would fit nicely with Ned taking in Jon from  her because she would have thought that he'd get the same treatment as the other Targaryen children and be murdered.

I've read the books once. One single time. I'm 27 now, I read the first one when I was 17'ish, and basically read all of them one after another after I read the first one, minus the long long waits for each following one, Feast for Crows and Dance with Dragons, thankfully I only had to wait 4 years from when I first read Storm of Swords and when I read Feast for Crows, instead of the 6 years for Dance with Dragons

Anyway, like I said previously, I only read them each once

So how are so many of you remembering facts like the big chain that stretched across Blackwater Bay to lock in the boats?

I remember the Wildfire, I remember the Hound being scared to death and bolting, I remember 'the water was on fire' and just the overall arc, there is tons of information I remember but some of it is very vague, and I definitely did not readily recall the chain until after I saw all the people worrying if it would be there

Have many of you read the books multiple times? Or just really amazing with details like that?

I know certain things in the series have jumped out at me and I've instantly shouted at the television while watching when my memory serves me, most notably when I saw Brienne take off her helmet after winning the fight versus the Knight of Flowers and I instantly was like 'Mother fucking Brienne!' after not even thinking of her name since the first time I went through the books because I remember how awesome she was

I remember Tyrion wanting to piss off the wall, hell I'm practically clawing at the walls waiting for Season 3 and everything Tyron does that makes this series unlike so many others I've ever read

But part of having not read the series in so long is I've forgotten tons of little details, like that chain, so I really enjoy the series, knowing what more or less is going to transpire, but getting to relive the ups and downs WITHOUT being upset because of something that does or does not happen in the book - 

TL;DR - Did a lot of you readers re-read in anticipation of the series on HBO, had you already ready the books multiple times way before it was picked up as a series, or do you have a photographic memory that could rewrite the books even if they ceased to exist? - The question is in regards to those of you able to recall the chain Tyrion had crafted to lock the ships into the bay

Or are plenty of you like me, having read them once, loved them, and only remember the general story line with a few awesome moments and therefore just genuinely enjoying the series regardless of where it does not parallel the books?",8,1,False,self,,,,,

It just seemed to random and boring I couldn't get through it, had nothing to do with any of the stark girls, or the stark boys, or the pretty girl across the see (she looks like 17-19, I imaged her like 14 but other then that she looks almost the same. )

Instead of the battle being abruptly resolved by the arrival of soldiers in Lannister armor, they should have had a long, clear, dramatic shot of ""the Ghost of Renly"" charging out of the darkness, with a clear shot of his crowned stag helm, before the rest of his great host explodes out of the darkness behind him. Cut away before you can get a good look at his troops to shots of Stannis' men panicking and screaming about Renly rising from the grave. Cut to Stannis being pulled away by his men, but with the added drama of Renly's return.

This way, when Loras bursts into the throne room, the panicked soldiers have made the audience think that he is actually Renly, and that hes here to kill everybody. This way, Loras taking off his helmet comes as a huge shock (plus how awesome is riding into battle in your dead boyfriend's armor...worked in the Illiad) and Tywin's entrance is even more shocking on top of that.

I know that this is basically what happened, plot-wise, but they presented it poorly. I was watching this episode with a dozen other people, and nobody noticed Renly's armor, whereas almost everyone instantly knew that it was Tywin coming with reinforcements.",26,39,False,self,,,,,

*And who are you, the proud lord said,*

*That I must bow so low?*

*Only a cat of a different coat,*

*That's all the truth I know.*

*A coat of gold or a coat of red,*

*A lion still has claws,*

*And mine are long and sharp, my lord,*

*As long and sharp as yours.*

*And so he spoke, and so he spoke,*

*That lord of Castamere,*

*But now the rains weep o'er his hall,*

*With no one there to hear.*

*Yes now the rains weep o'er his hall,*

*And not a soul to hear.*

**About**

""The Rains of Castamere"" concerns Tywin Lannister's successful defeat of rebellious House Reyne of Castamere and House Tarbeck of Tarbeck Hall. Tytos Lannister (his father) was a much weaker man. In his old age the Reynes and Tarbecks saw a chance to rebel. Little did they know his heir, Tywin, was a much harder man, even as a boy.

Tywin laid siege to their castles and drove both Houses extinct. Once the song was written Tywin used it for intimidation. It is worthwhile to note the song doesn't praise the wondrous battle, but warns of destruction and doom.

""A coat of gold or a coat of red"" is believed to refer to the Reyne sigil of a red lion on a silver field, and the gold lion of Lannister.

The song is important in later portions of the story, and you only have yourselves to blame if you look it up. Trust me, it's better not to know!

Hope this helps (and that it's not being redundant)!

[The book on Amazon.](http://www.amazon.com/Feast-Ice-Fire-Official-Companion/dp/0345534492)

This is the official cookbook done by the people over at [The Inn at the Crossroads](http://www.innatthecrossroads.com/), with an introduction by George R. R. Martin himself! It's medieval-style, ASoIaF-inspired recipes created by fans of the series. Being a fan of the series who loves to cook, I already have a copy here in my lap.

The first few pages after the introduction lay out some basics of medieval cooking, from possible substitutions for auroch to how to make medieval sauces and doughs. The recipes are divided by region (the Wall, the North, Dorne, Across the Narrow Sea, etc), and some of them include a quote from the books that mentions the item at hand. For example, below Mulled Wine is a quote wherein Jon describes how the Old Bear prefers his spiced wine. A good number of recipes have two versions to them; a ""traditional"" version (usually Medieval, Roman, or Elizibethan), and a ""modern"" version.

If you can't tell, I'm pretty stoked. This is a great way to spend my time waiting for [the big maps book](http://www.amazon.com/The-Lands-Fire-Game-Thrones/dp/0345538544/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;coliid=I9K36WXHI8RY6&amp;colid=6M4OG65ZX0QB) coming out later this year. Anyone else interested in this?

Some of the dishes in the book:

* Breakfast in King's Landing (most of the regions get a little bit on the sort of breakfast there)

* Honey-Spiced Locusts

* Bowls of Brown
* Summer Green Salad
* Honeyed Chicken
* Stuffed Grape Leaves
* Beef and Bacon Pie
* Lemon Cakes
* Iced Milk with Honey

It's been pointed out a few time that Westeros is based on Britain, with a lot of the rivalries based on the War of the Roses:


The Starks represent the House of York - the Stark characters on the TV show even have Yorkshire accents. The Lannisters are, loosely, the House of Lancaster.


GRRM has said he likes to take historical characters into consideration as influences and then create his own characters in their own right using this, some examples would include:


Cersei - Margaret of Anjou, French queen of Henry VI.

Varys - influenced by Francis Walsingham, the spymaster of Elizabeth I.

Littlefinger could be seen as being similar to William Cecil, the primary advisor to Queen Elizabeth and master of diplomatic machinations.




As for locations:


King's Landing is London. The North is equivalent to Yorkshire and Northumberland, bordered by The Wall, aka Hadrian's Wall.


The Vale is similar to the Welsh Valleys.  Dorne: Cornwall and the West Country. Dornish, Cornish.


The Crownlands and The Reach - the Home Counties and the Midlands.


I always get the feeling the Iron Islands are like the Orkney Islands or the Shetlands. Viking heritage, sparsely populated by hardy folk.


A lot of the places and themes come from the ""feel"" of how things were in the Middle Ages. England in turmoil, worried about armies of ""barbarians"" from beyond the wall (ie,. Scotland), for one.


Across the Narrow Sea (the English Channel) we have the Free Cities, which are very much European in feel, specifically Italian and Greek. Indeed continental Europe was a patchwork of small duchies, Italy containing many independent city-states. Venice, for example, was a trading-based republic not unlike Pentos and Braavos.


Wildfire is obviously based on Greek Fire, a weapon of the Byzantine Empire, and King's Landing has a feel of Byzantium and Rome in addition to London. Valyrian Steel is Damascus Steel - an exotic, legendarily tough weapon material from the East.


The Dothraki Sea is the Steppe of Central Asia - vast grasslands housing nomadic societies based around the horse. GRRM himself admitted the Dothraki were essentially a mixture of Mongol, Alan and Native American cultures.


The Red Waste - the name echoes Kyzyl Kum, a large desert in southern Central Asia, which translates as ""the red sand.""



At the ""centre of the world"" we have Qarth, with echoes of the great Arabian or Persian cities, standing as they were between Africa, Europe, India, China and Central Asia, controlling spice and silk routes, dealing in slaves and amassing great wealth. The name echoes Qatar. South from there Sothyros - aka Africa.



Other name connections: Rhoyne - the Rhine. Andalos after the Andals, similar to Andalucia being named after the Vandals in real life.

**MAJOR SPOILER BELOW. NON-BOOK READERS STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE.**




3. [Major Book Spoiler](/b ""Robb Stark dies."") I had this spoiled for me on Youtube a long time ago just after I started watching the show. At first I was in denial but I guess I knew it was going to happen. Yesterday some asshole in here decided he should spoil it for everyone on one of my posts which pretty much confirmed it I guess. I'm not too bummed because earlier in the series when [Season 2/Episode 7](/s ""Jamie escapes,"")I thought he would be [Major Book Spoiler](/b ""the one who kills Robb right there and then and I still got pretty nervous and emotional and also because I don't know who/what kills him or when or how."")  I guess when it does happen the show will handle it quite well. I just want to know if there are other more shocking events than the one above or did I get the biggest shock ruined for me? Try to answer without spoiling anything else, thank you. 




Book readers please do not go into detail or discuss the above spoiler in this post. Also I'd like to thank the mods because they removed that spoiler from the post pretty fast and just like to say that they are doing a pretty good job.

And I have read 0 pages of the books, so I could be totally talking out my butt on this.


Theory:  The Lannisters now intend to marry Margaery, not Sansa, to Joffrey.


Support:

""The Ghost of Harrenhal""  ~  After Renly is killed, Margaery informs Baelis that she doesn't want to be *a* queen, she wants to be *the* queen.  Considering her willingness to act as a beard for her brother's boyfriend, I don't think we can doubt her sincerity on that part.

""The Old Gods and the New""  ~  The very next episode after this happens, Baelish is off to meet with Tywin.  I and everyone else are too busy freaking out over whether he's going to recognize Arya to initially pay much attention to what they're actually discussing, but what they're actually chatting about is recruiting House Tyrell (a.k.a. Margaery &amp; Loras) to the Lannisters' side.

""Blackwater""  ~  Of course, there's the big triumphant (for the Lannisters) ending with Tywin striding in, Loras by his side.

But here's where we get into crazy-fan territory.  Did anyone else notice the subtle difference in how Cersei talks to Sansa?  Whereas she used to always say, ""When you are Joffrey's queen..."" she has now switched to, ""If you become Joffrey's queen...""  Very small change, but possibly significant.

Also, the Hound goes to rescue Sansa.  If Shae was correct about Stannis sparing her as a Stark, Sansa should have been safe, regardless of which side won.  Perhaps someone very close to the Lannisters who cared about her (i.e. the Hound) knew about the plan to supplant her with Margaery.  In which case, the only use she would have to the Lannisters would be as a hostage.

Again, this is all just crazy speculation, but I think it could be an interesting little twist.",64,85,False,self,,,,,

I've been watching / following the show religiously and I'm curious as to how it stacks up to the show

I desperately want to get into the book series, but I'm not sure how I feel about constantly switching characters as well as having no real protagonist / people dying off (apparently lots of big characters die). I've read quite a bit of Terry Goodkind's ""Sword of Truth"" series and whilst I loved it, I did occasionally get frustrated when it switched to an antagonist's / characters story that was far less interesting. The main gripe being that usually when it's a very engrossing or epic chapter, the next always swaps viewpoints...and it becomes a chore to read at times. Although each book does eventually wrap in an epic conclusion, without fail.


So did anyone have this problem with Game of Thrones (The Books), as well as the lack of protagonist...does it affect the enjoyment at all?

I'm asking simply because in the TV series, a quality actor can make a bad character enjoyable. I understand the natural bias in this subreddit...but do you recommend reading the books asap, getting passed season 3, or just stick purely with the series?",14,3,False,self,,,,,

* One character will die by another's hand, for a shocking reason. [*ACoK*](/b ""Qhorin ordering Jon to kill him."")
* Another will be killed, or believed to be killed, after the destruction of a well-known location. [*ACoK-ASoS*](/b ""Theon's capture by Ramsey Snow and Winterfell's burning; no doubt Robb will be told on screen that Theon is dead."")
* Two characters will form a surprising relationship. [*ASoS*](/b ""Robb marrying Talisa/Jeyne. Non-readers aren't going to expect him to propose, let alone immediately marry."")
* It's possible that a new, even more-surprising relationship will be announced in the episode. [*ACoK*](/b ""We'll certainly be told that Joffrey will be marrying Margaery, but whether"") [*ASoS*](/b ""Tyrion's betrothal to Sansa will also be announced is unknown."")
* If done right, one scene will MELT YOUR EYEBALLS. [*ACoK*](/b ""The House of the Undying, of course."")
* Another scene will MELT YOUR BRAIN. [*ACoK*](/b ""Jaqen's transformation."")
* A cool character that hasn't been seen in many episodes may return. [*ASoS*](/b ""Arstan/Barristan."")
* The ending will be a gigantic cliffhanger. [*ASoS*](/b ""Three horns!"")

I'm curious if anyone found something else. By the way, feel free to correct my facts. It's been a while since I read it.

Here is a little [description of what constitutes a POV character](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/POV_Character) from AWOIAF.

&gt;Point-of-View Characters from A Song of Ice and Fire. Point-of-View, or POV, is the way a story is written, determining through whose perspective the story is told. Martin strictly adheres to a third-person narration, in each chapter the reader presented the thoughts and desires of one particular character, everything he sees and hears, what he knows and remembers from the past, but not the thoughts of other characters and events occurring outside of his sight. Through the story we encounter number of POV's thus obtaining a multi-faceted picture of what is. For further information on the subject see third-person and point of view articles on Wikipedia.",0,1,False,default,,,,,

(Spoilers up to AFfC/Speculation/probably old news)",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/udqy5/and_this_is_why_you_must_live_because_winter_is/,juanito89,1338466540,"Alright, so I just re-read the chapter where Bran wakes up from his ""coma"". I think this was the 3rd or 4th time. 

Now, I'm not familiar with many of the popular theories out there, therefore I'm sorry if this is old news to you people.

At this point, it's pretty clear to me that:

- The gods have chosen Bran as an important element in the fight against the White Walkers, and basically, against Winter.

""He stared into the heart of Winter."" ""And this is why you must live. Because Winter is Coming.""

- This is why he names his wolf Summer (ldo :p)

- If Bran doesn't realize his powers, he will die.

""Fly, or die.""

- If Bran had not decided to try and fly in his ""dream"", he would've died in ""real life"".

""Are you really a crow?

Are you really falling?

It's just a dream.

Is it?""

Now, after the crow gives Bran the ability to see the whole world in real time, I'm gonna say, no, it's not just a dream, therefore Bran is really falling.

His life was in the hands of the gods, but also in his hands.

- It's because of the gods that Bran doesn't remember his fall when he wakes up.

""You don't need that now.""

In fact, it would've distracted him from his journey.

- After further reading, Bran is not the only one to have gone through an experience like this. The same thing probably happened to Aeron and to Patchface - only, what was their mission, why were they brought back?

Now, a question:

- The giant in armor made of stone, looming over the Hound, and the bright white shadow (Barristan?), around Ned, Arya and Sansa...never figured out who that was, not after 4 read-throughs :(

My guess at the time was the Mountain. But was he really with the King's party? And why can't Bran see his face? After reading AFfC, whatever champion Qyburn is making makes me think of this giant. But ofc it's most likely something else entirely. If Bran was glancing into the present, which it seemed it was for the rest of the dream, then it couldn't have been Qyburn's ""golem"".

Here's the way I see it playing out:

We'll get a full episode devoted to the Red Wedding.

- In the previous Ep, Cat will have spoken with Robb about the problems of going to the Freys again and everyone will object to his decision. Robb will draft up the letter legitimizing Jon as heir of Winterfell if something should happen to him.

- The next will open up catching up with Arya/Sandor, then cut to Robb for the rest.

- The wedding will proceed as normal. Everyone will be quite happy that Edmure's bride isn't ugly. They'll put a lot of emphasis on guest right and how relieved everyone is about him getting it (and they'll put a subtle ""mayhaps"" in there, I hope).

- About 45 minutes in, all hell will break loose. The red part of the red wedding will begin, and I certainly hope they leave Catelyn's last words as ""Not my hair, Ned loves my hair""

- The episode will cut away after we witness the deaths of Robb and Cat, it will go to Arya's POV. She will see the courtyard in chaos and will go running in, despite Sandor's cries to run. Amidst the chaos, we will see Arya spinning around searching for her Brother and Mother.

- Out of the distance, Sandor will quickly come into focus on his horse with his axe down ready for an upward strike. Arya will turn around and face the camera, then everything will go black and Greg Spence's name will pop up.

This will be the end of Season 3.",46,24,False,self,,,,,
