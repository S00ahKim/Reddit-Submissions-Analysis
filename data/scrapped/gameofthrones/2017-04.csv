First we have cercie on the iron throne. She knows the game better than anyone (aside from little finger arguably.) But with Danny and her unmatched army closing in on her (finally) she has not enough military experience, even with Jaimie, to take her on.

Danny seems an an unstoppable force to be recon with. But she also is a conquer with barbarian hordes that are going to pillage westeros. Most people are saying she is going to become crazy like the other targarians and get stabbed in the back (jorah?)

John is now the king in North but with only weak tired armies. Ya we get He doesn't want to be king but is going to hold his duty because he is one of the few who know the true enemy. He will be the first to fall to the white Walker invasion.

So who will rise to the throne? Obviously our hero with sick rowing arms, Gendry.",9,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

1st 
[""Night gathers, and now my watch begins"".]

Simplified definition of the long winter and their Order's cause.

2nd 
[""It shall not end until my death"".]

No further explanation here.

3rd
[""I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children.]

This part sounds like sacrifice, but why? Isn't it counter productive? Maybe there's a deeper reason why.

1. Some speculation says that this is a direct reference to what happened with the 13th Lord Commander, a legend linking him with a cold woman with bright blue eyes, seemingly a female Other. So, they implement this sacrifice in order to prevent same incident to ever happen again.

BTW this legend has its own theory.

The cold woman is not a female Other but a Ice witch or priestess. Who believes that the Others are gods and gives them sacrifices.

Ok, back to the original topic.

2. Another speculation says that The Hero who defeated the Others sacrificed himself in the process, either he died, or turned to become the next Night's King, or turned to become a zombie like Coldhands. Which makes this part, either to honor, or to even the hero's sacrifice.

4th 
[""I shall wear no crowns and win no glory"".]

This part suggests that the founders of the Night's watch has claims for inheritance. Maybe a King, prince or a Lord. A big hint that the ""Hero"" is a Stark, another speculation that interconnects to multiple theories.

5th 
[""I shall live and die at my post"". ]

Ok, pretty obvious here. A till death do us part thingy.

6th
 [""I am the sword in the darkness"".]

This part is tricky, either just a metaphor to describe themselves as warriors, or a hint about them being literally the Lightbringer. The sword of Azor Ahai, another interconnecting theory.

7th
[""I am the watcher on the walls"".]

Why walls?
It seems like there is five ginormous 1,000ft tall structure named The Fort which is similar as to why the Wall is built. That is to become a barrier and to be utilize to defend against the Others(the wall) and the Demons of the Lion of Night(the fort). (maybe the same beings but that's a topic for another time)

8th 
[""I am the shield that guards the realms of men"".]

Direct reference to the other beings besides human. 

9th
[""I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come"".]

A statement of dedication and sacrifice for their cause to defend humanity at their lifes cost from other beings that brought the long winter and all the winters to come.

*The oath is simple but deep, and give pieces of information to visualize the events that occurred in the Long Night.

*The breakdown is a culmination of theories of other people.

Here's the theory: Cersei will become the Night King's new Queen. We know that in the legends that there once was a Night's Queen, but she has never been shown in the show. My guess is that once the NK invades King's landing, she would want to team up with him. We know that she is set to die according to the prophecy but the NK's powers can easily break it and turn her into a White Walker. So why would the Night's King want to make her his bride? She is vile and conniving and enjoys causing chaos, he will look at her in wonder ""where has this woman been all my life"" and would want to make her his Queen.

50,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2017-4-1,2017,4,1,22,62sm3i,self.gameofthrones,[TV] How the Funko Pop! figures changed my life,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/62sm3i/tv_how_the_funko_pop_figures_changed_my_life/,BWPhoenix,1491052212,"This is the story of how the Funko Pop! figures for Game of Thrones changed my life. I assure you, it is entirely unrelated to the fact weve just sold out to them. This is heartfelt.

Like so many of you, I fell in love with this story for the political plotting and posturing of characters like [Cersei]( http://i.imgur.com/Cq5hRbY.jpg) and [Tyrion](http://i.imgur.com/W8xtFps.jpg). The complex interplay between factions within factions, which so often ended in wounds. Physical, or mental, they ended in wounds.

In season 4, we saw our beloved Oberyn brutally crushed, and from then on, it just started to get too much for me. The world just felt so dark, and his half-a-face stuck in my mind, a cruel reminder of how brutal this world was. The violence was all I could see.

But then something changed. By the start of season five, friends and family knew I was a Game of Thrones fan. Birthdays and Christmases you know the deal. A year later and I was inundated with Funko Pop! figures. 

It was the best thing that could have happened to me.

When I saw the [Oberyn figure](http://i.imgur.com/Sg49Inz.jpg), something clicked. The fun, comedic, happy style of the figure was such a juxtaposition to the horrible final image of him that lingered in my head, it was cleansing. It was like an opening of the soul.

Game of Thrones isnt about the plotting or about the violence. Its about the friendliness of the characters (like [Jorah Mormont](http://i.imgur.com/29E4nP8.jpg) or [Jon Snow]( http://i.imgur.com/O0gaQtU.jpg)). Its about the alliances made, the companions found, the toasts in honour of a brother or sister-in-arms. Thats the essence of Game of Thrones, and thats what the Funko Pop! figures capture like nobody else can.

Funko captures the heart of Game of Thrones, and realising that made me appreciate the show so much more.

##Tl;dr: You can buy the Oberyn Martell Funko Pop! figure at [this url](https://www.amazon.com/Funko-POP-Game-Thrones-Oberyn/dp/B00TON6D96/).

Are the dragon(s) technically Lightbriger? 

To explain, Lightbringer as far as we know is a sword that Azor Ahai crafted and could only complete by sacrificing his wife in order to empower it to fight the great others. What If lightbringer isn't just a sword? What if it's the idea and concept of what azor ahai needs in order to fight against the great other / white walkers? 

The scene where Dany births the dragon from the eggs pretty much fits all of the criteria. Pulled a from a fire a flaming weapon (dragons = fire). Khal Drogos soul was offered up as sacrifice and may have binded with the egg(s) in order to forge the weapon; the dragon(s). The 3 eggs also fits well with the 3 times lightbringer as a sword was created. 2 versions of the sword that shattered = 1 dragon that was born with no sacrifice and 1 with the wrong sacrifice (although the dragons live which they pretty much have to or the white walkers get their butts kicked. Ice dragon conversation ftw).

 Drogon is the successful lightbringer birth with drogos soul as the sacrifice. He is considerably larger and more power than the other two and is pretty much shown as the important one from the get go as he's the one who gets the close up.

Might be a bit tinfoil hat like but it's just a theory. ",20,51,False,spoiler,,,,,

***Update*** We're just about finished. Thanks to everyone who helped out! I would've loved to go for a third sigil (Targaryen of course), but there isn't very much space left and we don't have all that much manpower. Just maintaining the two we made will be fine. Someone screenshot both sigils when it's done and post it here for everyone to marvel at. Thanks again, and good work!

Nymeria - Arya quite literally became a warrior princess, even if she doesn't have a massive army (maybe one day she will, who knows)
Summer - wasn't sure, maybe Bran is the key to preventing the long night and returning summer to Westeros?
Lady - self explanatory, Sansa will become a lady.
Shaggydog - like a Shaggy dog story, Rickon's journey wasn't important at all, and his story ended with a 'pointless' death.

3. Sam was there when Jorah's father was betrayed. This would give Jorah some sort of closure hearing the truth from someone who was there.
4. Sam will feel obligated to help because of what happened with the former Lord Commander.
5. Sam has that Valyrian steel sword he took from his father. I do think it is possible Sam has the sword for research reasons as he knows it can be used to defeat white walkers. If not Jorah takes it and puts it to good use. 

Sam helps Jorah find cure, Jorah finds him the 1 of the 3 smith that can forge Valerian steel. Same discovers when Jorah returns to Danny at the end of the season (probably finally) he will have an Armory of freshly forged Valerian steel.

In this scene, the letter from varys' little birds is given to Ser Barristan Selmy. Ser Barristan opens it and it happens to be a royal pardon for **Jorah Mormont.**

Now keep in mind, the royal pardon letter was **ALREADY** sent to Jorah Mormont, when he decided to fully devote to Dannerys back at the market way back when Danny was with the Dothrakis.

[Clip of Jorah being given the letter, but he does NOT open &amp; read it, the hand of the king seal remains unbroken](https://youtu.be/wYlv2v3QQ8I?t=61)

My Point:
-

Why was the letter RESENT in Mereen? Where did Jorah even throw the letter to and why wouldn't he hide it somewhere? It's the exact same letter signed by Robert Baratheon and it's the same context of Jorah being pardoned.

Was this a trick from Varys? One of the kids specifically called out *Ser Barristan* before giving the letter, why did Varys want Jorah out of the picture? Why did Jorah not hide the letter seeing as it would reveal his 'spying' on Danny before fully devoting to Danny?

Varys is such a trickster, and I just found it interesting looking back at this. ",8,13,False,self,,,,,

I believe that the deaths of the Stark wolves correlates with the deaths/possible future deaths of the Stark members.

The first foreshadowing we see is the dead stag and dire wolf, symbolizing the end of the Stark and Baratheon houses. They find six pups, five at first, adding foreshadowing to Jon Snow's character. 

Sansa's wolf dies first but we know that she is still alive which is the only iffy part about my theory, but that ties into the possible future deaths aspect. Rob's wolf dies when he dies, Rickon's dies before he does, Arya's wolf is still alive and so is she, and Jon's wolf is alive (which made me think that bc Ghost didn't die, I knew Jon would come back. And he's Jon fucking Snow.) Bran's wolf died when he died as a Stark and became the Three Eyed Raven, carrying no house titles. 

Sophie Turner, Sansa, let out a little tease in an interview saying she will be filming in season eight but I have a terrible feeling that she won't make it to the end. IF my theory is correct, that is.

Maybe unreasonably.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/633098/main_spoilers_little_underwhelmed_with_season_4/,iXorpe,1491175056,"I've just finished the fourth season of Game of Thrones, and I must say, I do feel like it was a step down from the past seasons. And no, it isn't really because there was no crazy episode nine or anything to make me cry tears of blood like The Rains of Castamere did. It was more because it felt like, I dunno, it wasn't as well orchestrated? 

I'll begin with the first thing that comes to mind. Tyrion Lannister's struggles. Shae betrays him (because he tried sending her back because she is 'just a whore' and also, I think, because she is now whoring off his dad?) and so the trial ends with him demanding a trial by combat, and the episode ends in spectacular fashion.

But guess what? His champion, Oberryn, dies during the fight. And after this, all the intensity of the situation Tyrion is in fades away when we see him back in his cell and hear that there's two days until he is actually going to be executed, and then is smuggled out by his brother. The issue is that in his story, nothing really seems like it holds any significance. This sounds pretty crappy, but hear me out. Oberryn's death to me felt like something done just for shock factor. Like come on. The mountain raped his sister and then killed her and Tyrion also had to get him killed to have a chance to live. But it didn't happen like that, and it just seems so meaningless. If the mountain had died, Oberryn would have gotten justice and Tyrion's innocence would also be publicly seen through the power of the seven gods which everyone is Westeros seems to hold so much belief in, though it doesn't look like the gods these people believe in are very good at their job. I hope you understand what I'm trying to say. 
Oh yeah, and also, him killing Shae? That really didn't seem very Tyrion like.

Varys? Who's side is he even on? And now he's smuggled Tyrion to some other place (can't even remember the name) and he throws up and ladeedaa and dafuq? Didn't Varys kinda try and make you seem like a murderer in court, like, less than 24 hours ago? 

There was a scene where Brienne found Arya. And I dunno whether Brienne's character was supposed to be being developed or what, but that scene just seemed awfully written. First of all, Brienne, hello, either tell them why you're there properly or pull out hot pie's tasty biscuit, unless you've eaten it by now seeing as you're in the middle of pretty much goddamn nowhere. But no, instead you pull out a sword on Mr Flammable and let Arya get a few yards away. And after you've just beaten up the guy, Arya sneaks down to him, and where the hell are you? Having a shit? Come on. ""SHE'S BEHIND YOUUU"" from primary school pantomimes come to mind. 

Am I not gonna be seeing Jorah again? Why the hell won't daenerys hear him out, seeing as he's got her this far. And what the hell is Daenerys anyway? You get that other, good looking dude to show you his jewels (surprised that there's anyone in Westeros with any) then just send him off to recapture a place? What? To be fair, the more I see Daenarys, the more I just wish that she and Jorah would swap places. 

Anyway, I bet there's more, but any replies will probably be long enough as they are. Can anyone kinda justify some of these 'issues' that I feel are present? Because honestly, maybe I really just don't understand a lot of the things that the show wants me to.

I'm curious however, how it could work into the show without feeling too forced. Here's my idea:

So, two likely places for Clegane Bowl I've seen in this subreddit are at/beyond the wall or King's Landing. I doubt very much that Cersei, even if she believed a white walker threat was real would give two sh*ts about an undead army that's gonna do her dirty work for her long before they pose her any threat. (The Northern houses and The Vale) So, I think it's reasonable to say that Cersei and her undead killing machine/body guard aren't leaving King's Landing. So, if you can't move mountains you have to beckon your Hound and here's how: Jon Snow should know he can't run into battle again critically outnumbered and hoping another surprise calvary is gonna save him from certain death. Correct me if I'm wrong, even with all the houses and wildlings pledged to fight with him he still doesn't have a sizable enough force to take on the white walker army. He will seek help from Daenerys (by raven?). Her priority will be taking back the Iron Throne (we see evidence of this when Tyrion recommends staying in Essos and ruling/continuing the work she has started, which she immediately rejects). While reading Jon's letter, Varys will mention to Daenerys whispers of Sandor and the BWB heading to join Jon. Tyrion will advise Daenerys that despite his last interaction with The Hound, having a former King's Guard with knowledge of strategic ins and outs of the castle and any secret escape/entrance routes would be a vital asset. (Tyrion from whoring around or Varys from being the former spymaster may be aware of hidden access points but wouldn't necessarily notice or appreciate the military significance of certain defensive positions or choke points.) Tyrion will advise Daenerys to agree to send her forces North after capturing King's Landing in exchange for the Hound's expertise. Jon receives Daenerys' terms and is now in the presence of the BWB as they stop in Winterfell to rest from their travels. Jon explains he too is preparing to fight the white walkers, but explains the current logistical situation and the offer on the table. After some discussion, the Hound accepts. The BWB believe Sandor is important to the red god's designs and don't let him go alone. On their return march they walk past a disguised Arya leaving Riverlands, who is utterly shocked at the site of the Hound and reveals herself. Having already taken the Hound off her list, she (as the Hound has) forgives Beric and Mir. Especially, when she finds out they are heading to the one place the conveniently holds three of her last four names: Cersei, the Mountain and Ilyn Payne. We now have what I hope is if not fluid, a manageable set up to Clegane Bowl. The half-burnt joining the unburnt for glory and hype!

How Clegane Bowl should begin: Daenerys and her ships arrive at Black Water, the invasion begins exactly where Stannis came ashore. The Hound leads the shore party with air support courtesy of the Dragons. As the Hound and his men are ramming the gate one of the dragons on a strafing run narrowly misses an attack. The Dragon accidentally breathes fire on Daenerys' men with The Hound barely escaping the flames. The Hound having been thrown from the blast struggles to get up and regain his bearings. He looks around at the battlefield seeing the fires and chaotic fighting. He has a flash back to the original battle of Black Water and begins to freeze up. Still disoriented and with blurred vision he looks at the castle walls. The gate destroyed by the dragon's fire, through the flames he sees a large silhouette growing nearer. He stumbles to his feet and sees his sword on the ground the blade still ablaze. Arya from her boat that just came ashore, takes a helmet from a dead soldier, fills it with seawater and runs to the Hounds aid. The Hound looks at his flaming sword and the Mountain unsheathing his own. Sandor overcoming his fear, yells to Arya ""F*ck the water!"", picks up his sword still aflame and charges at the Mountain. Air horns sound off across all of Westeros.",7,8,False,spoiler,,,,,

The Hound showing Arya how to give mercy by stabbing the heart; ""You remember where the heart is?""

Could just be coincidences, but I genuinely think that the Hound will play a very important role in bringing down the White Walkers. Now that Melisandre is moving south, it offers a chance for him to confront her, an embodiment of fire, which is his biggest fear.

Of course, the hype in me wishes that the Hound will wield a flaming sword in the end game as he trashes some White Walkers.  A Hound Azor Ahai would be incredible and very fitting to his character arc, in my opinion.

Ned's unbreakable honor and sometimes gullible nature would have been troublesome as far as politics go. However, Ned would have been loved, respected, and feared, while also being tested and experienced in battle. Ned's true strength, however, would have been his successors. Ned was a great leader in the North, but he was an even better father. He established skills, morals, and honor in his kids, who would have instilled those same attributes in their own kids. This would have caused a succession of great leadership that would have truly benefited the 7 kingdoms (Robb would have made a great king if he would have had more time to mature and learn from his father).

Tywin, on the other hand, would have been almost the opposite. I do believe he would have made a pretty good king: he was experienced, effective, and not easily manipulated. Additionally, I have no doubt the 7 kingdoms would have prospered economically under his reign. However, he was a ruthless man who was happy to abuse and manipulate in order to get what he wanted, and he fixated on fear as the best way to keep people in line. Additionally, unlike Ned, he was a terrible father. He cared more about protecting his family name than his own children, and he also raised them to believe that they were the only ones who mattered. This line of succession would have very detrimental to the 7 kingdoms (as we will most likely see during Cersei's reign). ",25,12,False,self,,,,,

There's two ways this can go tho, I have a feeling after Jamie would commit suicide, to kill the woman he's grown up with and love and see her turn into pure pure evil would be devastating, I think that will happen.

This question has been nagging me since I saw the end of last season, and only now did I decide that I wanted to look into it. I became curious because I figured an army as large as Danys would require a massive navy to transport it. I am by no means a naval expert, so please take everything below with a grain of salt. Also it is very hard to make any real calculations as this show is set in a fantasy world, and we dont get many clues as to the type of ships her navy is composed of or even its exact size. Having said that, I made various big assumptions to get to my answer.

First assumption: The ships of Danys Navy will be comparable to real world ships of the time.

Second assumption: The shows naval technology is equivalent to that of 15th-16th century European ships in our world (More on why later).

Third assumption: Since different types of ships have different carrying capacities, I will assume all her ships are the same, and find an average of soldiers per ship.

Fourth Assumption: To make my calculations, I will use the Spanish Armada of 1588 as my point of comparison.

Looking at the scene where Daenerys sets sail, her ship resembles a Portuguese carrack. This ship was widely used by the Portuguese throughout the 15th century. The Spanish embarked to invade England in 1588 with one of the largest naval forces ever assembled at the time.

Spanish Armada: The duke of Medina Sidonia led the armada, numbering at a total of 130 ships, consisting mostly of heavy ships like galleons and carracks, as well as many light merchant vessels. Manning these vessels were around 8,000 sailors and 18,000 soldiers. This means a total of 26,000 men were able to set sail.

Danys Invasion Force: It is not clear how larger her army is. It mainly consists of some 8,000 unsullied, 2,000 Second Sons, and maybe 100,000 Dothraki (All of this without accounting for past casualties). I will just round down and say her army is about 100,000 strong. Her navy size is much less clear. We know she has at least 100 ships provided by Yara Greyjoy. She also seized many ships from the slavers. The best estimate for this, I found in this article(http://www.thewrap.com/game-of-thrones-finale-how-many-ships-were-in-daenerys-fleet/). I will take their estimate, which is 350 ships.

Math(FUN!!!):

    Spanish: 26,000 men / 130 ships = 200 men per ship

    Dany: 100,000 soldiers / 200 men per ship = 500 ships needed for her army
    Or 350 ships * 200 men per ship = 70,000 soldiers she can carry with her navy
As you can see from my calculations, her navy is just not large enough to be able to transport her massive army. She might need to make a couple of trips if she wishes to bring her full force to Westeros. Now remember that this numbers will vary wildly depending of the assumptions you make. My calculations have a margin of error large enough that I can see how her navy might be just large enough.

So, is there anything I didnt account for? How could I make this estimate better? Am I even the only one who cares about this? Will her army just use Varys magic transportation powers? Anyways tell me what you all think.",22,5,False,self,,,,,

Many were stunned when they heared this line the first time. How can a writer of a sentence at both times grasp the Zeitgeist of our society and combine it with classic questions about human life. It is literally mind blowing. To explain the amazing contribution within this sentence let's just divide the sentence in two part to show the true brilliance in the writing of this master piece.

**""You want a good girl"" - or the search of the good life**

The sentence starts with the very essential uncertainty of human life, our infinite struggle to find a ""good girl"", aka ""a good and fullfilling life"". In this very beginning the authors obviously refer to Aristotle in his description of the search for optimal human life, and more so the classic Greek Eudaimonia:

&gt; Verbally there is a very general agreement; for both the general run of men and people of superior refinement say that it is [eudaimonia], and identify living well and faring well with being happy; but with regard to what [eudaimonia] is they differ, and the many do not give the same account as the wise. For the former think it is some plain and obvious thing like pleasure, wealth or honour - Aristotle in the Nicomachean Ethics [1095a17]

The show runners show what Bronn sees as his requirement for happiness. Bronn himself is a symbol for the simple person who rose to power through his witt and strength, an original DaVinci so to say. Bronn achieved everything if you compare his life now to that of the beginning in the series. From simple sellsword to lord, but still not even close to anything like a complete live for Bronn. He still is in search of true and fullfilling happiness, his ""good girl"", or may we say his ""Eudaimonia"".
In this very first part of the sentence we are thereby shown the universal human struggle to happiness, and the limits of those models presented by Aristotle, Plato and later philosophers like Goethe or Voltaire. Eudeimonia, religion, the ultimate place for us in this giant universe, all of this is presented to us in the beginning of the sentence.

**""but you need a bad pussy"" - the existentialist answer to the pointless question**

Both Bronn and most listners are shocked after we here that the authors break the established perception of the search of the good life in the first part of the sentence with this answer. Not a good girl and eternal happiness is the real answer, but a bad pussy and real short term satisfaction is the way to happiness. Not in the grand scheme of the universe, but in the very vein of the moment. We are presented with a mix from the greatest modern Philosophers, this part of the sentence is a briliant and short synopsis of Camus and Nietzsche, who broke the moral standards of classic philosophy. The pointlesness is in no way a hurdle for happiness, it is in reality a needed requisite of it. Happiness also transforms into satisfaction, nothing is eternal, and the real goal of human life is not the Crown, not the conquering of a religion, but the simple living in the moment. The goal in life is getting satisfaction inside a bad pussy.

Tl,dr. the sentence presents us with two great and traditional schools of classic philosophy, breaks the norms of our perception of happiness and shows us how we as humans may get ""real satisfaction"" by simply living in the moment.",5,13,False,spoiler,,,,,

Unless it was a communication error or bad writing, it's pretty clear Jaqen knew everything that was going to happen with Arya and The Waif and he wanted it to happen. He tells The Waif to give Arya a quick and painless death, and she ignores this request. Arya survives because The Waif wants to enjoy killing her. She repeatedly shanks her in the gut instead of killing her in one clean motion. Jaqen knew all of this would happen, I think he came to the conclusion long ago that The Waif was not worthy of being a faceless man, she kills for fun unlike Arya, who may be less skilled but is far more driven. Essentially in that scene he had to choose which 'apprentice' would live and he chose Arya. 

At first you wonder what the point of this storyline was when it ended with Arya betraying Jaqen and returning to Westeros, but look what happened in the very next scene with Arya, she massacres everyone in House Frey and crosses another person off her list. I'm not sure what exactly the many-faced god wants or does, but it's clear that Arya's mission to complete her list of hits alligns with the many-faced god's desires. Killing dozens in one mission definitely outweighs killing an actress. Also I don't believe the faceless men kill for money, but that the money determines the value of the victim's life and thus makes them more appealing to the many-faced god. It may not seem like much of a theory but I just wanted to try to explain this faceless man arc that a lot of people have been claiming is bad writing. If anyone is going to have some sort of interaction with the many-faced god if it even does exist, it's going to be Arya. ",7,14,False,self,,,,,

COOL.


I'm sure I should get on it but I have *not* read the books, so this post will focus exclusively on the show, Game of Thrones, but if anyone wishes to bring forward outside information, feel free (hence the ""Everything"" spoiler notice). So, we've been hearing from Melisandre, ever since we met her, about her fixation on King's Blood. It's powers, what it does when thrown into the fire, how the lord of light loves to get a taste of it and ""show the way"" or whatever her nonsense is. We have seen other people, non-wizards like Stannis, be able to see/experience the magic of King's Blood when thrown into the fire. After Gendry's blood was thrown into the fire and Melisandre asked Stannis if he sees anything. He responds, ""I do,"" or something to that effect. She trusts this power so much that she was willing to burn Stannis' daughter at the stake, to appease the Lord of Light, because she had King's Blood in her. To reinforce her belief, we have also seen (or heard about) the Brotherhood without Banners utilize the Lord of Light's powers to bring back Beric many times from death. Furthermore, Melisandre herself brought back Jon Snow with, presumably, the same powers Thoros of Myr uses to restore Beric. So, how does this connect back to Lord Varys? We know that a sorcerer threw his junk n' stuff into the fire, and as we have heard from Varys himself and the Rachel Weisz looking red woman of Meereen, a voice came from that fire. The exact words from that fire have never been revealed, at least in the show. My assertion is that Varys has King's Blood. Now, I understand, there are some major issues with this theory. First of all, Melisandre was wrong. Stannis lost, and died, even with Melisandre's supposed prophecy that he would succeed. However, this could be because the Baratheon's are not the ""true"" rulers of Westeros. As we know, Robert was technically a usurper. The rulers before Robert were the Targaryens. If Varys was a Targaryen, this would explain why he is so loyal to Daenerys. Furthermore, though it is clearly a stretch and kind of getting into the anime-level territory of convoluted plot-twists, it may also explain why he is bald. He shaved his head so no-one would recognize his natural white hair, as all Targaryen's have. Especially since Robert has made it clear many times that he wants to kill every last Targaryen. Another hole in this theory, is why would he aid in the assassination attempt on Daenerys in the first season? A simple answer would be that he was looking out for himself at that point, and did all he could to not give himself away. Though this may just suggest that he is not a Targaryen, and some other ""King's Blood"" in him. The fact remains that the fire reacted to his blood, and he has made it his goal to rise to power and keep the seven kingdoms at peace since then. Whatever the truth behind Varys' magic balls and the talking fire, I hope it is something substantial and that the writers don't just drop this whole side-story. I'd really like to see it unfold in the last two seasons. What do you guys think? Know something I don't? (I'm sure you do). Agree? Disagree? Comment! Let's discuss!",7,7,False,spoiler,,,,,

From my point of view it's only a facade that is put up for the general public. It's just a lie that makes the whole order more acceptable in the eyes of the public. Faceless men seem to have their own agendas, ambitions and they uphaold different rules.  
When we first meet Jaqen he offers ""3 lives"" to compensate for the 3 saved lives.However when arya names him he is clearly shaken by it and he bends the rules ,to avoid being named.  
However in the house of black and white when arya makes a blunder , somehow the faceless man is more than happy to drink the poison and sacrifice himself without second thought.    
We see clear differences , from one faceless man to another. Some treat it more like a Profession , others like a Religion.  
It really makes sense tho if you look at the guilds status in bravos.  
Due to the whole religious aspect people seem to be ok with them.  
The last time we see Jaqen on the show he just looks like he's simply enjoying the clownfiesta between arya and waif.
I think we've been fooled to believe they have morals, but the bottom line is this. They're just a bunch psychopaths under one roof with a twisted sense of justice. We shouldn't be taking their commandments too seriously.

Book readers and show watchers all know that Bran is a warg but book readers are aware of Jon and Arya dreaming of being wolves. I think they can all warg.

Anyways, it made me think about potential for S7 and where Arya will be and I realize that at the end of S6, Brienne and Pod are still on their way back from the Riverlands. Arya is in the Riverlands. Could we have an Arya and Brienne partnering finally? 

Also, both of them hate Lady Melissandre, who told Arya in S3 ""We will meet again."" So I'm thinking these three who are already either in the same area or close to one another (Melissandre was banished to the South).

   Thinking about this war realistically, there's no chance of defeating the white walkers with manpower alone. Even if Jon/Dany is Azor Ahai and all three dragons make it to this war, that still doesn't defeat white walkers.... only whites. We all know this is a lopsided battle so how will it be won? Since the white walkers aren't Gods they must have a weakness, I think it is up to Bran to find this weakness.

A part of me is hoping that when the Knight King touched Bran he took a huge risk hoping he could kill Bran in the cave. By doing so he may have opened a door for Bran to exploit the Knight King's powers.

Am I the only one who thinks that bran is in a time loop and has been going back over and over again to try to stop the white walkers but each time has failed so he has to go back again and again. 

Similar to the movie edge of tomorrow staring Tom Cruise. Bran has already seen the white walkers win many times over again and each time he goes back he tries to stop them but only for them to succeed over and over forcing bran to keep resetting the timeline and make minor changes each time until he finally gets it right.

In my time perusing this subreddit I've come across damn near endless possibilities on how Cleganebowl might come to pass, more often than not with the common denominator being Cersei &amp; Trial by Combat. I've been thinking about it &amp; in this situation I'm under the impression that less might be more. 

I don't think there's going to be any sort of outlandish chain of events leading up to it, in my opinion, the groundwork has already been laid. Sandor Clegane has been considered an enemy of the Crown since the conclusion of Blackwater, He's a deserter of the Kings Guard that's had a substantial price on his head since shortly after his encounter with Polliver at the Crossroads. 

Now, it hasn't really been touched on, he hasn't really been relevant in the grand scheme of Kings Landing, but I'm thinking that with as unhinged as Cersei presently is, she's going to view him as an enemy, maybe even personally responsible for Joffrey's death, this isn't much of an issue current locations withstanding, but, I foresee the Brotherhood Without Banners making their way to the capital at some point or another, and that's when I think it's going to take place. Cersei is going to receive word that Sandor is in the capital &amp; immediately send her Mad Dog to dispatch him, simple as that.

What do you guys think? Is it going to be as simple as that or do you think there absolutely has to be more to it? I know I said I've seen a lot of the theories but I'm always down for some more Cleganebowl hype, so if you don't agree, how DO you think it will happen?",5,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

What if Arya **didn't** kill the Waif? The ""Arya"" we saw after that fight could be the Waif wearing Arya's face.

Yes, I realize this seems a little out there. But:

 * The title of the episode was ""No One"". But Arya claimed to be someone, Arya herself in fact, at the end. So the title doesn't match her development if we take it at face value.
 * Jaqen's curious smile would fit perfectly if he realized it was the Waif wearing Arya's face, and not Arya. It's his way of saying, ""clever"". Otherwise, his smile could be interpreted as, ""I'm proud of Arya for... not becoming no-one like I trained her to be""...? That makes less sense.
 * In all the scenes after the final Arya/Waif battle, she behaves in a very matter-of-fact manner. She kills the Freys, etc. We don't see her just being normal Arya any more.

In s4e10 Bran is told he'll never walk again but he will fly. Now unless he grows some wings like Angel in X-Men this can really only mean he will warg or ride a dragon (or both). 

In Tyrion's limited use for season 6 his crowning moment is when he unchains the dragons. The dragons are receptive to him so if he were to ride a dragon the foundation has been laid. 

Jon has the blood of the dragon, nuff said. 

Now Tyrion may ride a dragon while Bran wargs said dragon but it would make Tyrion's role on dragonback a bit redundant. Then again maybe these dragons won't be ridden at all, after all a dragon isn't a slave.

I'm not a history buff and some points have been selected to go along with the comparison but I feel like there is a lot of overlap and possible hinting at the future here.

Henry 7 / Robert Baratheon
- Won the throne through conquest. 
- Strengthened position of the country.
- Held on to power in face of opposing claimants to the throne. (Iron Islands/Targaryen) 

Henry 8 / Joffrey Baratheon
- Personally flawed.
- Rule leads to religious issues within the country. (High Septon comes to prominence)
- Known as egotistical, misogynistic, and threatening.
- Rule compounded by a 'hand' (Cromwell/Tywin) who essentially rule in their place.

Edward 6 / Tommen Baratheon
- Heavy focus on religious reform through short rule. 
- Young, weak and easily influenced.

Mary 1 / Cersei Lannister
- First female ruler of the country.
- Restored previous religion to the country. 
- Need to keep hold of throne in face of multiple plots against her
- Famous for ordering the killing of her opponents
- ***HERES WHERE THE TINFOIL/THEORISING BEGINS***
- She married a military rival of the time (Philip of Spain / White Walker) to prevent invasion of England/Westeros. A move which was unpopular.
- Actions increased the strength of opposition to come together and oppose her rule.

Elizabeth 1 / Danaerys Targaryen
- Welcomed to the throne by people of all classes.
- Had to remove threat of Spanish/White Walkers in early years. Many of whom had previously plotted against her. I assume the WW will do this.
- New religion for the country to follow. 
- Pressured to marry and have a child but did neither therefore having no heir. Dany has been told she can't have children and I don't think she would marry Jon but instead would name him/his family her successor for their help in the battle against the WW.
- Her main priority was providing for her people and doing what was in their interests. This has seemed to be Dany's motive through the series so far.
- Selection of her successor through her council (Sir Robert Cecil). Her council will clearly be important to her as she has always been surrounded by those able to give her strong guidance since her brothers death - Jorah, Daario, Tyrion. 
- House Stuart (from Scotland) went on to rule for several hundred years. I believe this will be the Starks, also a northern family, being offered the right to rule my Dany as her reign comes to an end.

James 1 / Jon Stark / Dany's Choice
- Completely new family on the throne.
- Previously a KINGINDANORF
- Had a blood link (ancestor in common to the previous monarch) 
- Aimed to unite all countries of what is now Great Britain (We've seen Jon try to do something similar by bringing the Wildlings south of the wall and incorporate them in Westerosi society). 

What do you think? Is this a realistic succession to the throne based on history?

A newb (me) comes in and says something everyone else has already said, and they all get irate. So I'm just going to warn you all... I've not spent any time on this subreddit. I just wanted to get something off my chest. So please avoid this post if you think I'm about to barf out old news. lol

Here goes...

My theory in a nutshell is that Bran, the Ice Guy, the Three-Eyed Raven, and the guy chained to the tree getting impaled by dragon glass (who is probably the Ice Guy) are all the same person... Brandon Stark.

Here's why...

Brandon can hop into people's bodies. He can effectively travel through time. I think it's safe to assume he's hopped into the 3-Eyed-Raven at some point. Probably slipped into ""Bran the Builder"", who I'm gonna guess is the guy tied to the tree, even further in the past.

I'm also gonna guess the Ice Guy (or the guy tied to the tree) is the last body Bran jumps into.  So the chronological order would be Bran---&gt; Raven---&gt; Ice Guy.  If I'm right, the clue would be that we don't see the Ice Guy killing the 3-Eyed-Raven. They both just sorta look at each other knowingly and the direction cuts away. This may be because the Ice Guy can't kill himself in his own past. Paradox issues.

Whatever the situation, the scene where they all meet up in the tunnels under the tree could be interesting because it might be Bran in the same place in 3 different bodies at 3 different moments in his life, but they are all the same moment. Like a freaky time knot.

One clue I have to back up my theory is that the 3-Eyed-Raven seemingly only shows Bran 'family' stuff when he helps him look through time. The exception being the guy tied to the tree. That's why I think he's either an ancient Stark family member or it's actually Bran hopped into someone else's body way back in the distant past. In effect, the whole story is about Bran and the Stark family. They defend the world against a disaster that they created. (well... Bran)

Bran is the beginning, middle, and end of the story. He doesn't know it yet, but he's fighting his future self. The 3-Eyed-Raven version of himself knows the truth, but can't tell young Bran everything yet because... he simply didn't have that info at that young age. Knowing too much would ruin the time line.

I wouldn't even be surprised if Ice-Guy-Bran is moving the game pieces to assure his own destruction. For instance, he stops short of finishing off Jon Snow. It's not like he couldn't have frozen the water and walked out to the boats. Maybe Jon is supposed to defeat him and he knows it, but he still has to play the story as it is meant to happen.

On a different note...

I also think that Bran could be all the gods. The nameless people claim that they discovered all the people praying to different gods were really praying to one god.  The same god. I think that, as Bran whispers in peoples' minds throughout time, different people label him differently depending on how they interpret him. Like the comet that everyone sees, but all give a different reason for what it signifies.  It's one comet, but it means different things to different people.

Playing God, Bran is trying to influence history by whispering in peoples' minds and ends up affecting things that ironically cause his transformation into the Ice Guy. I think he is the voice that Vares heard in the fire when he was a kid. Bran was nudging events to assure Vares became the man he became. It was a cruel moment, but it was, in Bran's mind, for the good. Though it might have seemed like an evil god giving orders.

This could be a comment on why gods seem to let bad things happen to good people. God might just be a naive kid with a super power and a not-well-thought-out plan. Or maybe it's simply that ""everything happens for a reason"". Even the bad stuff. Like getting your junk cut off. It was all part of God's plan to ultimately thwart evil.

Ok, that's all. It's off my chest. Flame away... lol...

Since the Valonqar is Valyrian for the little brother, most people think that Jaime, or maybe Tyrion, will kill Cersei.  I think that in a show as unpredictable of Game of Thrones, this is too obvious.  The Valonqar means ""the little brother"", not Cersei's little brother.  So Cersei's murderer could be anyone who is a little brother.  But saying this in Valyrian suggests that the person will have Valyrian blood.

The Targaryens have Valyrian blood.  Jon Snow is a Targaryen.  He is the little brother of Rhaenys and Aegon.  He wants to kill Cersei.  I think it is very likely that he does. ",500,1654,False,self,,,,,

I figured this was the best sub to post this request in -- my boyfriend and I are attending a local sci-fi/fantasy con as Daenerys Targaryen and her dragon Drogon. The unique part of this cosplay is that ""Drogon"" is composed of one of those uber-viral Jurassic World inflatable head T-Rex suits with proportionally tiny wings on his back. (We like to be goofy.)

I want to order name badge ribbons to trade at the con and for this day (perhaps all 3 days) I want the ribbons to reference the duo. My attitude will be grave concern as to why con attendees find my fearsome dragon to be so derpy, and I want to convey this in the ribbon text somehow. A very simple example would be ""Fire and Blood. That's not funny!""

I picture the scene like this: Bran is alone and dieing near the roots of weir tree in the abandoned lair of a direwolf.
He enters the past and finds the time where the direwolf was there and sends it on it's way south. Then he fast forwards to the encounter with the stag and sets it up to look like an Omen to warn his family of their fate before dieing himself, unable to truly change the past, yet at the same time altering the timeline to make it what it is today",15,17,False,spoiler,,,,,

*""When your tears have drowned you, the Valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you.""*


To quote u/dremling :

&gt;Since the Valonqar is Valyrian for the little brother, most people think that Jaime, or maybe Tyrion, will kill Cersei. I think that in a show as unpredictable of Game of Thrones, this is too obvious.

Of course, I agree with this.  GRRM will surely give us a twist regarding this prophecy.  We all know that Cersei has done some terrible things to get to where she is now but I believe that her streak of terror has not finished yet and that her worst is yet to come.  That being said, I believe that Theon Greyjoy will kill Cersei either as she is turning into a White Walker/ Wight when she is still human enough to be killed by asphyxiation.

The *""When your tears have drowned you""* will ellude to the fact that Cersei's sorrow at losing her children will drive her into an alliance with Euron, (The Iron Island's god is the ""drowned god"", and Euron believes himself to be supernatural).  Euron/Cersei will seek to make an alliance with the white walkers against Dany/ Jon, and in the inevitable conflict between the two factions, Cersei will be left dying.  White Walkers will then show up, already be there, or be part of the battle, to begin turning Cersei, but before the transformation is complete, Theon will be there, and probably being the only person that can stop her, will strangle her to death (not knowing that she will come back to life anyway), before she can commit some terrible act (akin to the destruction of the Great Sept).  This fits with the *""Valonqar ""* portion of the prophacy, as Theon is the youngest of his family, and Theon killing Cersei on the verge of turning into a WW fits with the *""the Valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you""* portion of the prophacy.


**TL;DR:  Theon Kills Cersei as she is being turned into an Other/WW, fulfilling Cersei's death prophacy.**

Now that Sansa is older and wiser, would she appreciate the kindness Tyrion showed her? Now that she's been married to and brutally raped by Ramsay Bolton, would she come to love Tyrion for the respect he showed her when she was at her most vulnerable?

This got me thinking that the Night King might have some kind of telepathic control over whoever sits on the iron throne during when hes strongest (during winter).I've been thinking about this for awhile but seeing the new trailer made me really start thinking about it and i was wanting some feedback to let me know if im just too far out in left field.
The Iron Throne was said to have been forged by Balerion the dread's dragon fire. My theory is that when that giant grey pile of melted awesomeness was forged, the magic of Balerion's fire made the Iron Throne into some kind of beacon or some kind of magic enhancement tool and the Night King whose powers we still don't know the full scope of, took advantage of that fact and used his perversion of the Children of the Forests magic to take control of the right kind of people that sat on the throne too long and show them things they shouldn't, kinda like Bran's training with the three-eyed raven only instead of a nice old man in a tree showing you the ropes, you get an ice demon of pure hatred shows you all the unspeakably horrible things hes going to do to the people of Westeros, and while the Mad King wasn't a warg, All Targaryens have the Blood of old Valyria in them which sometimes gives them magical abilities and would make them an easy target for someone as powerful as the Night King.
With that being said its perfectly within the realm of possibility that he could telepathically dominate the mind of someone and drive them nuts.
Whenever Aerys was spouting ""BURN THEM ALL"" I don't think that he was talking about his subjects, but the army of the dead that the Night King had been showing him, as the three eyed raven said "" It is beautiful beneath the sea. But if you stay too long, you'll drown."" That's what happened to Aerys, he was driven mad by the Night King showing him all these horrific things that hadn't happened yet, ""drowning"" him as it were.    
And while i'm not completely sure on the details i do know that Robert was not a good king and probably never sat on the Iron Throne much during his tenure as king and most of his reign was, in the words of the late grand Maester Pycelle RIP ""The longest Summer in living memory"", so the Night King might not have been at his strongest when Summer is in full swing, also Roberts Targaryen blood was most likely not as potent. He only had a little Targaryen blood thanks to his grandmother and the only other people who had sat on the throne were 2 children who had no Targaryen blood at all. Now that they probably weren't as good a candidate for the Night Kings special brand of mind fuckery or the Night King just didn't care to as he was busy murdering all the wildlings.
(WILD SPECULATIONS OCCURS)

Now what this means for season seven i have no iclue it just seems to make sense that cersei is gonna get crazier and crazier until jamie finally kills her and gets sent to the wall then old goldenhand gets turned and then bran wargs into a dragon and burns him to death.
Thanks for reading, lemme know what you guys think and whether or not any of this made sense lol

During the lie game she plays with the waif I think there's something more there. Firstly we realize that  she lies a few times about 2 things 1) her hatred for the hound and 2) her feeling of Jon snow as her 'brother'.

... I think that the hound relationship is used for comparison to show that it's not objective truths they're pointing out but self denials.   We see that she doesn't hate the hound but is in denial about not hating him... similarly we see that she doesn't associate Jon snow as a 'brother' which strikes me as ODD! considering she has the deepest relationship with him/ misses him most of all her family members.

I don't think this is meant to show how truly deep down she only thinks of him as a half brother and nothing more (which is what most people have dismissed it as)...rather I think this is foreshadowing for her feelings for Jon as being MORE than brotherly-romantic-...but she is in denial even to herself. The point of the game wasn't to point out objective truths... but rather exposed her self lies, lies she told herself but deep down doesn't believe 'Jon is my brother' *HIT*...   It makes no sense that her deepest relationship is seen as less brotherly than her other siblings who she is not as close to. I think it means to her, her relationship with jon was MORE than just brotherly.  Look how Needle is the one thing she can not part with.  The one thing that keeps ARYA STARK, Arya, is a gift from him?  
GRRM did say he originally was going to write these two into a romance, but the books don't have the time gap whereas the show does so I don't think it can be totally ruled out, and this could be some foreshadowing.  

Also as for how she becomes No One, there are a lot of theories about this but this is what I think... I think that she was AFRAID of dying, fearing death, running away, Syrio once told her FEAR cuts deeper than swords, and she's been running to stay ahead of her fear ever since but I think in the end when she faces the waif what happened in that very moment is, yes, she decided to stop running BUT more importantly she no longer feared death.  She truly no longer feared it.  She became no greater or no less, she became nothing and she became no one.  She finally understood- Valor Morghulis ALL men must die. 

The many face god or drowned god or stranger (all show symbols of faceless/ being reborn / death by drowning ) literally dying (what is dead may never die) they kill themselves so to speak to be raised again. Arya killed the girl who was afraid to die to embrace the harbinger of death she becomes.
 
Jaqen is pleased because he sees that she is ready she has understood Valor Morghulis. She doesn't have to give up her identity to become no one but rather understands that before death she is no one.  

Understanding Valor Morghulis she leaves to westeros, why is she allowed to leave? Her very first act is killing walder frey but I think what this scene is showing more than just a mindless vengeance plot.  The way arya kills him is more telling.  Remember Bran talking about one of old nans tales about the cook who kills a guest and serves the king his sons in a pie ?  He killed a guest under his roof, Bran's words were, "" that's something even the gods couldn't forgive"" ...For arya to kill Walder frey in this way I think is a clever nod to her being used as an agent of death for the many face god whether she is aware or not because after Valor Morghulis.....
it's  Valor Dohaeris.....All men must serve.

* Lots of the locations in the show are down-scaled (Such as Winterfell + Castle Black) which would fit in well with the Bethesda location scales.

*  Decent character customisation.
* Imagine deciding to travel beyond the wall and coming across the Night King and his troops with sudden suspenseful music to instil fear (like that cave scene).

* 1 Shot the Night King with a Valerian arrow and claim his crown.

* Possibly become the prince that was promised.

* Bend the Knee to the one true King.

* To Wildfire or not to wildfire sept or not to sept.

* Modifications are coming.

Of course there would be things that would have to be changed and added. It can't just be a Skyrim clone as it's a new license. Some of the things could be:

* Bigger focus on political plots

* Hardly any magic (only things described in the book or powers revealed in the show, would also be rare and very situational)

* Overhaul of the combat system no longer a clicking mess something more along the lines to Mount and Blade.

* Battles with armies.",68,92,False,self,,,,,

I've taken a great interest in reading Maggy the Frog's prophecies and I just can't stop thinking about the Volonqar prophecy. Well first off, I think that the ""more beautiful queen than Cersei"" is not actually Margery like some people say, but I think that the that more beautiful queen is actually Dany. Let's be real she's tons more beautiful than her. Not just in appearance, but in personality. 

Now I'm sure you guys understand that that volonqar means ""the little brother.""  Most people think that that entails Jaime, or Tyrion. People who are related to Cersei, but the prophecy doesn't explicitly say that it has to be her younger brother. 

Think about it. Who is her undead guide and possesses strength of unbelievable proportions? Who has killed scores of people? Gregor! Gregor clegane! And who is the younger brother of Gregor Clegane? Sandor! I'm willing to guess that Gregor and Sandor will eventually meet again, and we will finally get 'Cleganebowl.' It could be a possibility that Sandor could finally kill Gregor. Gregor is the last thing that Cersei holds dear; she probably has lost Jamie's love, and while she realizes that everything she's ever loved in life is gone, Sandor, the little brother of Gregor, could choke her to death while Cersei weeps. It's possible. ",2,1,False,self,,,,,

But seriously - the hubby and I are in the process of rewatching the series preparing for the new season, and were remarking on how Catelyn treats her kids and how it possibly impacts them. Curious to hear your thoughts, GoT redditors.

EDIT: I'm sure Catelyn loves all of her children. I merely wanted to solicit input in the interest of good fun/random debate and discussion. FWIW, Catelyn happens to be a character I love to hate on but simultaneously enjoy analyzing. 

I would guess:

1) Robb - He's the heir apparent to the Stark line and her first born. Obvious favorite. She mothered him too much and he listened to her bad advice. We all know how that turned out.

2) Sansa - She's the most like Catelyn, which I think puts her pretty high up on Catelyn's list. Unfortunately for Sansa, Catelyn nurtured her perception that the life of a lady is mostly unicorns and rainbows. At least now Sansa *seems* to be coming around to reality. 

3) Brann - Catelyn obviously loved him, but not enough to put any effort into her Westerosi dream catcher. That thing is hideous. No wonder he ran away up beyond the Wall. 

4) Rickon - Catelyn forgot that he existed while she was obsessing over Bran. Robb literally had to remind her. I blame the Tully genes for his untimely death - he should have had the common sense to zig-zag. (Serpentine, Rickon, serpentine!) 

5) Arya - She's the least like Catelyn, and I'd hazard a guess that Catelyn was more than happy to send her off to KL in order to get Arya out of her hair. I think Arya greatly benefited from minimal exposure to her mother.

NOTE: I'd say Jon doesn't count for this, because Catelyn gave negative one million fucks about him and he's not one of her own offspring.",58,62,False,self,,,,,

How would you rank them? I'd say mine are:

4: Fantastic dialogue, a great battle, every single storyline is interesting and strong (except for Bran's). Honestly Game of Thrones and ASOIAF at its golden age with the greatest storytelling I've ever witnessed. Peter Dinklage and Lena Headey absolutely shined.

6: Noticeable decrease of the script's articulate nature, however this season contains a plethora of strong plot points. Bran's storyline was exceptional, Battle of the Bastards was unbelievably staggering, and The Winds of Winter is possibly the best episode yet.

1: Dialogue at its best, and perfectly introduces us to the world. Sean Bean and Mark Addy shined as Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon respectively. Possesses the fluency of a Shakespearian tragedy. Absolutely flawless, but also refrains from taking any big risks. 

3: Acts as the climax for the first half of the story. Jaime Lannister's redemption, Daenerys Targaryen's conquest, and the downfall of the North still remain as some of my favorite storylines. Only negative was that Rains of Castamere, Kissed By Fire, And Now His Watch Has Ended were the only episodes to stand out.

2: The pinnacle of the War of Five Kings. Tyrion and Arya at their best and the action was at an absolute high for the time. Ranked so low because most of the season felt like pure plot build-up and my favorite moment from the books (Daenerys' prophecy) was omitted.

5: Not sub par by any means, except when compared to Game of Thrones standards. The Dornish storyline and Arya's plot stand as potentially the worst we've seen on the show, and Daenerys' arc seemed to be at a standstill. However, the strong trio of episodes at the end of the season was phenomenal.   ",34,29,False,self,,,,,

She is merciless and fierce towards her enemies but she also sees good in the world that she wants to protect. She has a soft spot for children, even for Bran Stark as you see in season 1. She didn't want Jamie to kill him, even if it meant him blurting out their secret. It's not a secret she wanted to keep forever anyways. She tells Tywin in a later season.

She felt responsible and rightly so that Jamie pushed Bran out the window and then sent someone to kill him later. But she is human like the rest of us and regrets her actions. It nearly broke her little heart in season 1. I love the scene between Cersei and Catelyn when Bran is unconscious. Cersei says that she prays to the mother every night to help Bran return to his mother. It's hard to say if she was sincere or not but I believe she was because she wouldn't wish the death of a child to her worst enemy because she knows the feeling. She lost her first child and it nearly killed her, she feels empathy and sympathy towards Catelyn.

She was 100% right to murder Robert her husband. He was a terrible king and was sending the kingdom into a massive debt. She just didn't see how evil Joffrey was because she had her ''mom goggles'' on that blurred her vision. She loved him too much but later admits that she was wrong and he is a monster. More regret making her character seem ''more human''. She does have a heart even though some people ignore to see it.

After her children died one by one her heart started to turn to stone. She started to think that she was cursed from the very beginning. The witch told Cersei her prophecy and there was nothing Cersei could have done to change things. She was destined to lose her children meaning she was destined to become a monster.

Before she lost her children she wasn't evil nor good, she was just a spoilt wealthy brat who was promised to a drunken man she didn't love. She was plucked from her home and family to marry another man. She did her duty even though it meant leaving her one true love Jamie behind. She couldn't understand why she had to leave and Jamie didn't. She describes it later as being sold of like cattle. She was promised to be queen of course but is it what she really wanted? I think not! I think she wanted to create a family with Jamie but couldn't because incest isn't acceptable in Westeros unless you are Targaryen of course.

Since she lost her children she turned into a raging monster but if Catelyn Stark had the same prophecy do you really think that she also wouldn't turn into a similar monster? They both loved their children more than anything in the world so to have them taken away before you one by one over some prophecy that the gods aligned you with would turn anyone into a monster, even Catelyn.

Overall I totally understand Cersei and why she became the person she is. I still love her. &lt;3 (As a villain)",23,11,False,spoiler,,,,,

Jaime tries to kill her but backs out at the last second. She takes the knife from his arm, kisses him deeply and plunges it into his heart. Jaime dies in Cersei's arms in a scene eerily reminiscent of the way she held Joffrey as he died but she has no emotion on her face whatsoever. She doesn't care.

I've been thinking about this scene for a while now and the more I rewatch the series, the more convinced I become of it. 

For one thing, Jaime's character's central identity revolves around his struggle over the label Kingslayer. On the one hand, he knows what he did was the right thing to do and probably saved thousands of lives. On the other, he's despised because of it and it cheapens his honor. I think this is no more clearly shown than in his bath scene with Brienne where it (and maybe the pain of losing his hand) causes his to stress out and pass out.

Second, we know almost every action Jaime has done in this series (good or bad) has been in service to his love for Cersei. Whether it's tossing Bran from the tower or killing Lord Carstark's son in order to escape from Robb's capture and his certain death, getting back to Cersei and loving Cersei has been one of the biggest motivating parts in life. It's why he watches from afar as she and Robert raise his children. (He knows if the secret gets out, she'd be killed.) It's why, deep down, he takes the oath as a Kingsguard and forfeits his right to be the heir of Tywin. 

To me, it's also why he is largely directionless in season four when he finally returns to Cersei and sees she's now a different person and doesn't feel the same way about him. ""You took too long,"" she said.

Jaime's actions almost always involve pleasing Cersei or doing what he can to keep her safe. It's why he goes to Dorne to rescue Marcella and why the pain of losing her hurts him so deeply. 

Because of this, I think he's doomed. 

And the more I watch, the more convinced I become of this. Particularly with the little line he throws out to Bronn about how he wants to die. ""In the arms of the woman I love,"" he says. Bronn's response more or less says ""Do you think that's something she wants?"" and, to me, that's a scene we'll turn to in a few years and wonder how we didn't notice it. 

Moreso, Jaime dying in the way I described above would validate him as a character who did everything in his life for love and would be the final moment of change from the villain we saw in Season One who would kill a kid for her to the reluctant hero who wants to stop her from killing everyone else. Secondly, it completes Cersei's transformation and eliminates the last person she cares for. 

To me, it just fits too well to not be the direction they're going in. Thoughts? 

TLDR: Everyone thinks Jaime is going to kill Cersei. I think she will kill him. ",67,90,False,spoiler,,,,,

For example, the extinct of the Tyrells through Wildfire mirrors the death of the Gardener family during Aegon's Conquest to dragon fire; Margery's downfall resulted from her ambition and the love for her brother (she could have left him when Renly died but was loyal, and her loyalty cost her her life); Robb Stark's murder resulting from his breaking of his betrothal to a Frey, etc, etc, etc.

However, one of the most dramatic plot twist of the series after Ned Stark's death is the death of Tywin Lannister by his own son, Tyrion. Tywin's death (which is foreshadowed by Davos on his visit with Stannis to the Iron Bank) created the chaos in King's Landing that led to the events we witnessed with the destruction of the Great Sept in the season six finale. Without Tywin in the picture the High Sparrow rose to power (as acknowledged by Kevan Lannister in the first episode of Season 5), Tommen became the weak king he was, and the much needed allegiance with the Tyrells failed. It is clear from this that Tywin was needed to maintain order in the realm and he and many other characters knew this and some saw Tywin's death as an opportunity to put their plans into action (as Jaime said would happen as he guarded Tywin's body in the Sept), e.g Littlefinger, The High Sparrow and even Cersei.  

Yet, what if Tywin was so in awe of his own capabilities and power that he saw it as his duty to kill his own father in order to become the man he became. Let us look at some evidence that may support this: 

1) The sharp contrast between father and son: Tywin and his father, Tytos couldn't have been much more different from one another. Tywin was strong, shrewd and capable, while his father was weak and many thought of the Lannisters as toothless lions during his time as the Lord of Casterley Rock and the Westerlands. Could the difference of the father and son show a desire in Tywin to kill his own father. George RR Martin also refers to this difference in character between the pair: Lord Tytos was an altogether different character [to Tywin], amiable but ineffectual, and he allowed himself to be pushed around a good deal, by a number of people.. including Lord Walder Frey (ever wonder how Genna came to marry so poorly?) and the Red Lion of Castamere, the richest and most powerful Lannister bannerman, and a formidable soldier/warrior in his own right...

2) Tytos' indulgences: Tytos was similar to his grandson, Tyrion as he took mistresses, two such mistresses are referred to in the Song of Ice and Fire series, one a wet-nurse, the other a candlestick maker's daughter. Tywin dislike of these mistresses is conveyed even further by him forcing the latter to make a walk of atonement following Tytos' death.

3) Tywin was the de facto Lord even before his father's death: Tywin orchestrated the massacre that inspired the song the Rains of Castamere while Tytos was still alive. Tytos was not in favour of such an event and Ellyn Reyne even tried sueduing Tytos years earlier before being harshingly married off to the Tarbeck family. Could this event imply that Tytos and Ellyn had a child together, her oldest daughter, Rohanne, which was covered up? Could this also imply that Tytos was so lenient towards the Reynes and Tarbecks? Because he had a daughter hidden in amongst them. This may also explain why Tywin might have been so open to wiping the family out. (I have discussed this theory in another theory which I have written).

4) Tywin and Legacy: The first three points are arguable but only convey mild motive, looking at information present about Tywin beyond the main canon of the series. However, if we look at the character of Tywin himself we can see that his murder of Tytos may not be as far-fetched as one might think at first glance. He refers repeatedly about legacy and legacy seems to be his main driving force during the course of the series. He starts a war to save Tyrion out of pride, and his quoted repeatedly referring to legacy in both series and books. Here are three examples: 
""Before long I'll be dead, and you and your brother and your sister and all of her children, all of us dead, all of us rotting in the ground. It's the family name that lives on. It's all that lives on. Not your personal glory, not your honor... but family.""
""The future of our family will be determined in these next few months. We could establish a dynasty that would last a thousand years... or we could collapse into nothing, as the Targaryens did. I need you to become the man you're always meant to be. Not next year, not tomorrow... now.""
""The house that puts family first will always defeat the house that puts the whims and wishes of its sons and daughters first. A good man does everything in his power to better his family's position, regardless of his own selfish desires.""

Therefore, it is clear that Tywin views thst it is the role of each family member to maintain, build and develop that legacy, something Tytos was failing at.
But how could Tywin have killed his father. Well firstly, he wouldn't want it to seem like murder. It would make the Lannisters look weak and vulnerable so poison seems an obvious choice. Tytos reportedly died of a heart attack while climbing stairs but he could have possibly been poisoned, and who would have questioned Tywin, after all little was said or done about him massacring the Reynes and Tarbecks, and Ramsey got away with stabbing his father. 
But, Tywin was in King's Landing when his father died, I hear you say. Well Tywin may have had an accommlice, but who? Easy, Kevan Lannister!!! And to me this quote by him seals the deal, not to much this close relationship with Tywin (note the exclamation mark at the end, something Martin does use without reason):
""Our own father was gentle and amiable, but so weak his bannerman mocked him in their cups. Some saw fit to defy him openly. Other lords borrowed our gold and never troubled to repay it. At court they japed of toothless lions. Even his mistress stole from him. A woman scarcely one step above a whore, and she helped herself to my mother's jewels!""

So, there we have it, it is quite possible that Tywin and Kevan conspired together to kill their father so that Tywin could take over officially as the head of his house and therefore, it only seems fitting that Tyrion, Tywin's own son, would kill him. Genna Lannister, their sister may also have been involved out of spite for the poor betrothal Tytos made between her and Walder Frey's second son.

Also, if we look at the unofficial motto of House Lannister ""A Lannister always pays his debts"" one can see it as a motto foreshadowing karma. Tywin killed his father, so it is only natural that George RR Martin would decide for him to be murdered by his own son. This father (patriarch being killed off by offspring is common in Greek and Babylonian Mythology). ",9,9,False,self,,,,,

After the 9th episode of GOTs season 6, the world went nuts about Ramsays last words to sansa that she cant kill him, he is a part of her now. Most of the fans guessed that ramsay referred to the fact that sansa might be pregnant with ramsays child. I also thought of something like that. However, it didnt make a full sense as GOT has never been that simple.
As I waited for the seventh season of the show I re-watch the full show starting from season one, and when I once again came across that particular scene, something caught my attention. As the hounds biting ramsay to death, sansa attempts to turn away, but on the next second she turns again and look once again inside the cell  watching the brutal incident with joy. The sansa we knew up until that point, would never do such a thing. I watched that part over and over again and gathered that the innocent and sweet stark girl we once knew is gone. On her face, it was written that it was not just revenge, it was more than that. She has started to enjoy watching people suffer, which is undoubtedly one of the key characteristics of ramsay Bolton. Moreover, when she finally turned away and started to walk, a beautiful but cold smile took place on her face that literally made a cold shivering running through my spine. 
You can re-watch the scene here : http://i.imgur.com/rgrC2sq.gifv
So, I think what ramsay said was more of a metaphorical sense rather than literal. What he did to her has left a deep mark inside her that made the once sweet, soft-hearted, kind Sansa Stark a cold and ruthless human being who hurts people for the purpose of enjoyment, just like ramsay  and ramsay knew what he has turned her into as he liked to play with peoples minds, and in order to do so, youd have to be a good reader of others thoughts  doubtlessly, he was good at it, and thus came Im a part of you now from his mouth.
However, its just my own observation, whats really going to happen only God and the insiders of GOT know since anything can happened on this show- but it always feels good to be right, and I hope the coming episodes will make me feel good.

Lets start out in the beginning when they reunite

1) Sansa reunites with Jon and wants to take Winterfell but Jon doesn't and wants them to leave together. Then they get the pink letter and Sansa says that Jon is the son of the last ""True"" warden of the north and the loyal north will fight for him. She didn't say that they would fight for her but for Jon.

2) At the first war meeting in Castle Black, Sansa is speaking up with no issue until Davos makes a good point about the North Forgetting. Then they all agree to go around a look for smaller houses to help while she sends Brienne to see if the Blackfish can help. So everything is fine except she doesn't say how she got the info but she relays the info so all in all everything is fine.
They begin to leave and Sansa gives Jon a cloak just like Ned's.

3) They then try to go to all the houses but first start with the Free Folk. She sits in the back and says nothing while Jon and Tormond speak. This makes up the bulk of their army. Next they go to Bear Island and Jon and Sansa both get shot down but Davos was able to help out. However, Jon is standing in the front and middle with Davos and Sansa flanking him. If she wanted to lead, that is where she should be standing and not Jon. Lastly, they go to Deepwood Motte and Jon and Sansa get shot down and the same standing structure where Jon is in the front and middle while Sansa and Davos flank him. All the visual signs look like this effort is lead by Jon to all whom they meet.

4) They get back and Jon says they have to leave and fight because winter is almost here and cannot wait. She wants to keep going to other houses but Jon says there is no one else left to help as they sent ravens and went to all the places they could. 

5) She sends a letter to Littlefinger without telling anyone so no one knows that she is providing something vital to the fight.

6) The last war meeting she says nothing until it is over and Jon and Sansa have a discussion.

7) The fight occurs and then she comes at the end with the Vale to turn the tide and then Wun Wun breaks down the gate and they capture Winterfell. The Northern houses still don't know anything that Sansa did.

8) When the Head of the Northern houses come to Winterfell. She says nothing the whole time and Jon seems to be asking for them to be ready to fight when the Night King is coming. So this looks like Jon is still the leader.

I wrote all this to say with all the sitting behind Jon, not speaking, and allowing Jon to take the view that he is the leader. How else would the heads of the northern houses think is the leader of the campaign to take a back Winterfell and who is leading still now? If she learned anything from Littlefinger, wouldn't she know that perception is reality? Wouldn't Littlefinger know that as well?? These all seem like big tactical errors if the goal was to have everyone think you are the ""leader"". Why now would she want to lead when she could have been leading the whole time? I am sure Jon would have let her take the lead role by standing in the front or leading the meetings. Why would she be jealous now when she never placed herself in the leadership role to being with?

I think the Mad King is another failed ""time-warg"", or whatever you want to call it, by Bran. What if Bran's body found himself in another scurry with the army of the dead, while simultaneously his mind was in the past inside Aerys Targaryen (circa Hodor S06E05)? There is lots of evidence of the Mad King being OBSESSED with burning people (Jamie explains to Sir Barristan and King Robert in S01E03 ""[King Aerys Targaryen] said the same thing he was saying for hours...""Burn them all.""."". 
We know that Bran can affect the past when he time-wargs. Plus, it would be sensible to believe how the phrase ""burn them all"" would echo through Bran's levels of consciousness, just as ""hold the door"" did, especially if Bran was again encountered by the army of the dead.

Disagree or not, hopefully, you have enjoyed the possibility of this theory and love trying to piece things in this world together too!

So everyone's wondering about the Cersei/Walkers connection since it was implied in the season 7 teaser released recently. When she blows out a breath, it's icy (condensed) (implying it's very cold since that's what happens when you breathe in the winter) and the next image shows the blue eye of a white walker. So my theory is based on a few assumptions of future events that will happen in season 7:

Assumption 1: The Wall will somehow come down in the season 7 finale
Assumption 2: The Horn with the ability to take down the wall (the one from the books) exists in the show as well (maybe it's the one that Sam found a few seasons back)


So based on these assumptions and the teaser trailer, I think Cersei will find out about the White Walker army that has been formed on the other side of the Wall and near the end of the season, she will lose her power and control (thanks to Dany's arrival) and will resort to even more drastic measures aka unleashing an army of the undead on the kingdom she has lost control over. So she will somehow procure the horn (maybe from Euron Greyjoy who is trying to get allied with her after being reject by Dany?) and decide to blow it in the season finale and knock down the wall (this would explain her icy breath in the teaser trailer). I would LOVE if the season ended with her blowing the horn and the very last shot of the season is of large, loud cracks forming in the Wall before it goes black. That would be amazing in my opinion but we shall see what happens in July...",12,12,False,spoiler,,,,,

It will be great! But I am also very worried. 

GRRM has created a great and rich universe, with a lot of mystery. We can spend years discussing and people have been.
People on this subreddit and elsewere have been spawning theories for years on how things will end, what the white walkers are, children of the forest- the list goes on.

And thats really fun. Almost as fun as the show.

With the limited number of epiosodes left i will make a bet that only a few theories here will have an answere. 
One of the most fun thing about game of thrones in my opionion is figuring out the white walkers and the stuff that goes on in the north.
I do not think that will ever be explained. Theres no time in the few episodes that are left. They are just there as an enemy to unite people.
We will be given no answeres. And thats hard to swallow.

Look how each season is built up. episode 1-8 very little happens. Slow pace, then BOOM!
 Big things happend during the last two hours / 2 episodes.
Given how very well the show is written we will probably have a satisfying ending but we should stop with the theories, It will only be worse in the end when there is no answere.

Just to clarify, I like to read the theories. But this will be a Sopranos like ending with a lot of lose ends.

This will be LOST all over again, the internet will go crazy :)
I liked LOST but boy did they fuck up. If that show told writers anything it should be that you should not make up questions and storylines that you do not have an answere to. Not when people are highly invested in the show. It's cheap.

13 episodes. thats like one season - a lot does not happen in one season. 
Are you ok with not getting an answere to why the night king is the night king. We spent six years following Bran, now he is in a position but there will be little time to dig up every brandon stark story you have written theories about. Or anything else. He will be important. maybe we get a couple of more flasbacks. not much given the time left and every storyline in the show.

Any thoughts on this? 
Im worried. But looking forward to it.

With Audible you can jump back/forward in 30 second increments, but with a hard copy I can read and re read any page or excerpt at my leisure.

For one, i was thinking the other day it would be a cool ending if Jon died, but Daenerys lived and ended up giving birth to Jon's child after being told she would never be able to give birth (because both have targ genes). Or they both die, and who better to foster this child and prepare them for the Iron Throne? Obviously Sam (and possibly Tyrion, as well). *this is assuming Whit Walkers are killed or retreat.

The Starks, especially Ned, acted logically and honorably, while the Lannisters were the ""evil"" bad guys.

Even during my first couple rewatches, that more or less remained the same (aside from a growing hatred of Catelyn Stark; is she any more sympathetic in the books? my goodness). This latest one I just finished seemed entirely different though.

Ned Stark is so clearly in over his head. Sure, it always seemed like he was out of his element, or a fish out of water, however you want to say it, but I never realized just how fucked he was, with nothing to do about it.

The Lannisters vs Starks was an inevitability, not an unfortunate series of events. I often see people mentioning how Bran falling out of the building was the start of everything, and while true in some ways, it is a discredit to the machinations in play (specifically of Varys and Littlefinger and other such schemers). Regardless if Jaimie pushing Bran out the window, the hands on the puppet strings lead to only one result.

Regardless of Bran's attempted murder, or Catelyn's insanely stupid capture of Tyrion (more on that later ...), once Ned was to be Hand of the King, conflict was guaranteed. With Lysa so under the power of Littlefinger that she would murder her own husband, then write to her sister that the Lannisters were responsible, Starks vs Lannisters was inevitable.

And once Ned shows up in King's Landing, it's so obvious. He is just so completely fucked. He dances to the tune of Littlefinger and Varys almost willingly. All the mystery and intrigue surrounding the motives of the two manipulators (especially Littlefinger) is stripped away, and the previously subtle and indecipherable comments are overt and straightforward pushes and prods along a clearly paved path.

As cruel and twisted as the Lannisters are, they also were pragmatic. As Cersei instructed Joffrey, war with the north, or even holding it, would be pure idiocy. Dislike each other, maybe even hate each other, I got the sense that the Lannisters would be quite willing (however begrudgingly) to work with Ned Stark as Hand of the King, and maintain a more proper decorum in Sansa's marriage to Joffrey.

The real smoking gun, the catalyst that empowers the schemers, is Jaimie and Cersei's relationship. Incest aside, the legitimacy of Robert/Cersei's children is completely past the breaking point for the Lannisters. If it gets out, the repercussions are unbearable for the house, especially with someone as wrathful as Robert behind the justice.

This gives so much power to those looking to control events. Anyone close to uncovering the truth, or investigating it, is an immediate threat to the Lannisters that must be dealt with. And with Robert's numerous bastards all having black hair, it's so easy to nudge them along the path.

And so, even though I think it was inevitable, I do still have to comment on Catelyn Stark. Are her actions any more reasonable and sympathetic in the books? Every rewatch she just seems more stupid. Even if you give her the benefit of the doubt regarding the dagger and other such things, and assume it's fair for her to believe with certainty that the Lannisters attempted to murder Bran, her actions are still asinine.

Her family is in two places, Winterfell and King's Landing. Her two daughters and her husband are in King's Landing, surrounded by Lannister forces and people with no obligation to the Starks. And her decision is to take it upon herself to kidnap/detain Tyrion Lannister? It might not be signing a death warrant, but the mortal danger it puts Ned, Sansa, and Arya in seems glaringly apparent.

 I've just started the first book, and I'm not very far through at all, just started the first Jon chapter, but already the level of subtle foreshadowing and signalling is blowing me away. I wish I had read the books before watching the shows.

 The one that really got me was when Ned and Robert were in the crypt at Winterfell and Ned flashes back to Lyanna's death, and you are lead to believe she is asking Ned to promise her that she will be buried at winterfell, but there is also a sense of something not being quite right. And considering what I know now because of the shows, it blew me away, and made me fully appreciate the genius of Martin.

Also the whole thing about an antler killing the djre wolf was worded and structured very cleverly from Bran's point of view, and I imagine book readers at the time would of also struggled to understand why it was a bad signal, maybe.

Dany (fire) and Jon (ice)
Jon (Rhaegar was fire and Lyanna was ice)
Dragons (fire) vs. White walkers (ice)
Cersei (fire) vs. Jon (ice)
Lord of Light (fire) vs. Night King (ice)
Fire that kills wights vs. ice that creates them

I think that it is possible that fire and ice is how the series ends.  In Season 2, Dany has a vision of the throne room burnt and covered in snow and we have seen images in Bran and Dany's visions that show King's Landing burning.  I think it's possible that the show ends with King's Landing burning from the wildfire and dragons (fire) as the snows of winter fall and freeze anything that survived (ice).  This would have ice and fire signifying agents of death. 

 I also like the Lord of Light vs. Night King idea.",5,0,False,self,,,,,

While actor Iain Glen(Jorah) has said ""There are fifteen hours left in Thrones as we understand it"".

If we take the average length per episode (~55 min), then a regular season has a run time of 550 minutes. We also know that there are only 13 episodes left. 

If the total run time will be 15 hours, each episode will have to be about 70 min. 



If the total run time is the same as a regular season, then the episodes would have to be about 85 min each.

This means each episode will have the length of a short feature film. Assuming this is accurate, why would the producers decide to make this change in episode length? After all, fans have been assured the actual content we will be given will be about the same.

But hear me out.

In the final of Season 2, after losing at Blackwater Bay, Melisandre rattles off a list of things that will (and DO) happen to Stannis: he will betray he who serves him (Davos), his family (his wife), everything he once held dear (honor and his daughter). We know all of that happened. BUT, what she says next is what got me...

""...and it will all be worth it, because you are the son of fire, you are the warrior of light, you will sweep aside this pretender and that one. You will be king.""

So, if we assume that A) Melisandre is right (which her track record, necklace, and demon Stannis baby all seem to point to) and B) Stannis did actually die to Brienne's sword (because in my opinion the honorable Brienne would NEVER not take that opportunity), then the only conclusion is that Stannis will be King, he will step up as King of the undead army of wights. After he is raised (as winter falls upon the north) he will be chosen to become a white walker, and go on to lead them in battle, as he was always meant to do.",23,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

Dany had heard his side of the story with the Mad King and Tyrion adviced Dany to let him fight for her. She did and he swore to protect her till his last day. Him and Tyrion were both on good terms, but Jaime was more concerned with training and being as prepared as possible for the war, and both had serious looks on their faces as they knew what was to come. What happened to Cersei wasn't shown in the dream, but she had to be dead with possibly Jaime being the killer. In one scene he dreamt he was standing on the edge of The Wall with a White Walker approached him slowly until Jaime fell off the wall, but it also represented his fear of him decending into madness (like Aerys and Cersei) because of the terrors that he was soon to face.

If you're here to tell me not to get one, let me first say that the series has been my single biggest obsession in pop culture ever, both the books and the show are very near to my heart, and have a greater meaning to me than I could possibly explain in a Reddit post! This is not a decision made on a whim, it'll be my third tattoo, and I'm certain I want it.

I would like it to be on my arm, with my other two tattoos, to eventually become a full sleeve..The Starks are my favorite house (I know, too easy) but I don't want to just get the dire wolf sigil..It would be really really cool and all, but I just feel like it's a bit too standard or easy. I want to go for something a bit more unique. My current tattoos are on my shoulder and inner forearm, so I have a lot of open space from my outer forearm/wrist all the way up to my tricep or so, to fill in.

I'm just looking for ideas, input, and possibly some creative suggestion (perhaps a sketch?)

Not that I mean to steal your idea...please don't share something if you would like to keep it as your own original idea, but I can't think of anything too creative off the top of my head. I will probably bring some ideas to my artist and ask her to mock something up of her own (she's obviously much more skilled at that kind of thing than I am) but I just wanted to see if anyone had any cool ideas to share, for me to consider! I really appreciate anything and everything you share, and please keep the replies positive? Thank you!!",39,4,False,self,,,,,

My question is the blacksmith Gendry works for the one who melts down ice and reforges it? (presuming he goes back to work for the same blacksmith)

As to where the valyrian steel could come from I think Sam will take as much valyrian steel from the Maesters and give to Gendry, he's already taken his family's sword Heartsbane, possible foreshadowing maybe?

However, I'm not entirely convinced that this is his main role. I think that he'll find out he is the last Baratheon and claim what is rightfully his, siding against anyone who is against Cersei.",19,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

"" Dragons are neither male nor female, Barth saw the truth of that, but now one and now the other, as changeable as flame. The language misled us all for a thousand years. Daenerys is the one, born amidst salt and smoke. ""

So if little brother is meant to misdirect us,... then the use of High Valyrian is to get us back on track...so I look for a character who can be called little brother and has some High Valyrian ancestry... and its damn Jon Snow, the youngest son of Rhaegar Targaryen, little brother of Rhaenys Targaryen (daughter of Rhaegar) and Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaegar) ....and probably more then willing to strangle someone who has resulted in the many deaths of friends and surrogate family.

When Arya gives the ship captain that coin he is astonished and pays respects to her, says he'll take her to Bravos, and offers her a cabin. What's the story with the coin? I know Arya got it from jaqen h'ghar. What I'm wondering is -- is there a backstory from the books or something which explains why that coin is so special -- and why the captain would be so amazed and change his tune so quickly?

Also, Jojen is mortally wounded by the white walkers and his sister (Meera) finishes him off by slitting his throat. But his body is never burned. Any chance we see him again as a white walker?

To me, it was almost ritualistic and I can really feel my pavlovian reflex being woefully confused these days.




A fresh episode, to me (Residing in Northern Europe) meant getting up extremely in the morning, long before the wife and kids woke up. Armed with fresh cup of coffee, a lot of questions and high expectations, I'd let the sofa engulf me. Then, by the time my coffee was gone and the credit started to roll, I'd prep the home for the rest of the ~house~ family to wake up.




April feels almost ""empty"" without fictional murder and plotting.

Allow me to don my tinfoil top hat and throw a crazy theory into the ring: Arya will kill Cersei while wearing Jaime's face. 


We saw Arya checking out Jaime at the end of last season. I posited in another thread that she was sizing Jaime up, since she probably realizes that she will have to kill him in order to get to Cersei. What if, instead, Arya is planning on killing Jaime, taking his face, and then killing Cersei? It would fulfill the prophesy of the valonqar...and might actually mean that Arya could somehow choke Cersei. According to the prophecy: 

&gt;""And when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you.""

Jaime currently does not have the use of his dominant hand, which has made me question his ability to choke Cersei, as stated in the prophesy. But if Arya dons Jaime's face, (and her body morphs along with it, which seems to be the case), she wouldn't necessarily be missing a right hand herself. It's only a form of disguise, after all. Granted, Arya would have to hide (or disguise) her right hand from Cersei in order to not arouse suspicion, but, interestingly enough, Arya is left-handed, so this would not constitute a problem for her. Since we're talking industrial-grade tinfoil here - why couldn't Arya be the valonqar in both senses of the term? She would be Jaime (the male younger brother) as well as herself (also a younger sibling). 

So, what do you think? Did I do the tinfoil thing right? Does it need more tin, more foil, or both?

**Please Note:** While it was fun to come up with, I don't actually believe this theory will happen. I think Jaime will continue on in his redemption arc and will ultimately be the one to kill Cersei when she inevitably threatens to blow up KL and everyone who lives there. The Jaime as valonqar theory has been out there for a while and is no longer new and exciting, however I think it's the most plausible, and also the most satisfying because I personally want to see Jaime redeem himself and I think it would be poetic if he was the one to kill Cersei.

Could the fact that Robb's scene never had the main theme in it show that he was going to fail, that he was never properly playing the game of thrones (of course politically Robb was a complete failure).


This could mean that Jon Snow will be more successful. Of course I don't think Jon Snow wants the Iron Throne and I don't think he will even go south but it could be a sign of something.

He even grew as a character on the show. He changed from being cocky and arrogant to being a believer in daenerys and being very loyal for a sellsword. He's far less annoying than in the books too.

So what does that amount to? His arc had a fitting end in season 6, sure, but I feel like there had to be more to it than that.

She then turns north to put down the ""King in the North"" which she achieves easily with the help of her dragons. Sansa manages to escape. Arya arrives back home, learns what happened, and sneaks into the Red Keep to assassinate the Evil Queen. Leaderless, the Dothraki terrorize the countryside and the dragons fly off and disappear. It's at this point that a huge army of white walkers swarm the wall and quickly overcome most of the north. Tyrion and Daario go on a mission to recover the dragons, later joined by Jorah who managed to aquire Euron's Dragonbinder horn. The three subdue the dragons using the horn and ride north to stop the flood of ice zombies. They arrive just in time to rescue Sansa who, having escaped with the help of Brienne, is now surrounded by white walkers. At that point, Jorah is completely consumed by greyscale, and loses control over the dragons. Tyrion is thrown from the saddle, and Daario is eaten. All seems lost, but Bran wargs all three dragons and kills the remaining white walkers and the ice king. The effort leaves his body a mindless vegetable and he becomes one with the old gods. As his first act as King in the South, Tyrion makes peace with Sansa, Queen in the North and the remaining Dothraki are captured and killed/deported.

But in the show there's no indication to it before the trial. So they could've just been keeping the indicators out of it to surprise us.

However I think that Varys actually paid her off to testify against Tyrion and she just jumped at the opportunity to bag Tywin. I think that Varys has been playing a much better game than Little finger to get the throne, because he doesn't make it obvious.

In season 1 when Rob finally gave in to Ned and said to call the assassination of Dany off, Varys told Ned that it was too late and she was most likely dead already. I feel like Varys wanted her dead at the time because it was in his best interest until Tyrion's trial. 

I feel like Varys realised after Dany had her dragons, he knew her side was the winning side. Sure they might become unruly, but he's thinking worst case scenario. He paid Shae to ensure Tyrion would be sentenced to death but he cut Tyrion loose because without Tyrion, he wouldn't be able to join Dany's side - the winning side.

I also feel like we're going to see a beautiful shot in the iron throne room between Varys and Little finger as Varys killed Little finger.

What do you think guys? I've only seen the show twice so I could be forgetting a lot.

Edit: Going to quote a comment I made on this thread with changes to my theory.

&gt;Very interesting. I do like the Varys is a Targaryan  (sp) theory and think it could hold up. I think I like that possibility now more after you've pointed that out because it could be argued him being a Targaryan is the reason he wanted to be there with Dany. 

&gt;So now I know he didn't try killing Dany, I've changed my mind a bit. Whether or not he wants the iron throne for himself, I think he still could've paid Shae to make it look like Tyrion was going to die. ",12,5,False,self,,,,,

Brienne is now in Winterfell, so it's within Jon's reach. It would be especially poetic if Jon is Azor Ahai and Lightbringer is a sword created from his uncle's Valaryian steel blade. It would also make things interesting as it's twin is held by the Lannisters.

 It would make more sense if Gendry goes North. Davos will vouch for him and confirm that Gendry is Robert's bastard. Jon will sympathize as they both are bastards. It will also be kind of poetic as the so proclaimed bastards of Ned and Robert avenge the deaths of their fathers.

Jeez.

As I sit here and think about where we go from here, I can't help but wonder what Cersei's ultimate plan was regarding Tommen.

Obviously this is a moot point but what do you guys (and gals) think might have happened if Tommen didn't jump out of that window following the destruction of the Sept? Cersei clearly gave zero fucks about anything at that point and, to me anyway, it looks like she is dead inside and just waiting for someone to come and take the throne from her and strangle her to fulfill the prophecy.

All Cersei ever had were her children and, because of this, I have to believe she was trying to protect Tommen and had hoped he didn't kill himself but how exactly did she think he was going to react?

The boys was soft and had, largely, avoided seeing any of the more horrific violence of Westeros in this show. There was no way he would've been able to process the guilt of his mother killing ALL of those people and he must have known she did it by the way the Zombie Mountain prevented him from going there.

If Tommen didn't take King's Landing literally (One of my favorite Reddit jokes in the episode thread btw), what do you think his reaction would have been and how would he have treated Cersei? Would he have ordered her executed? And those closest to her/in the plot?

There is literally no way he would've been able to rule after that if he didn't have Cersei killed. No way. And the people would've demanded her head for the crime, rather than sitting quietly, fearfully as she ascended the Iron Throne.

I think it's an interesting discussion to have because I'm really not sure if Cersei's plan was thought out more than ""I want to kill all these people right now.""

TLDR: If Tommen didn't kill himself, what would've happened after Cersei blew up the Sept?",7,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

It's likely that Ser Davos Seaworth will be his hand but Jon does have other options. Who should be his Hand?

Ser Davos Seaworth

For: former Hand of the King to Stannis Baratheon, experienced war commander, problem-solver, honourable, reasoned &amp; persuasive, knows when to work with enemies (Melisandre)

Against: In desperate times, people may not be so receptive to his calm rationale, doesn't have the influential name that can help a lot, Stannis failed and was one of the most-hated men in Westeros, doesn't help his reputation.

Lady Lyanna Mormont

For: strong, dutiful, passionate, very persuasive - she persuaded a group of Lords to rally behind Jon Snow, fiercly loyal, willing to learn, most major houses are currently ruled by strong women, knows a lot about other houses

Against: she's a very young girl (Olenna: let the grown women speak), may not have influence over Southron Lords and Ladies

Princess Sansa Stark

For: grew up in court so knows the houses of Westeros very well, was married to a master player of the game and former Hand, trained by a master player and spy master, secured the North-Vale alliance resulting in winning the BotB and avenging the Red Wedding, very influential name, driven, growing strong, knows the King very well

Against: hasn't mentioned the real war at all, more of a Game of Thrones player, no experience leading people, does get overlooked fairly easily, could get manipulated by Littlefinger

All of these candidates would be valuable to have on his small council and I think they could all do a pretty good job as Hand but ultimately I think it will go to Davos. Thoughts?

Brandon Stark is paralyzed below the waist, and thus it could be literally impossible for him to even attempt to reproduce.

Arya Start was brutally stabbed in the belly, and it is quite possible her womb is out of commission after that.

Sansa Stark was constantly raped by Ramsey, and never got pregnant. Unless she used some form of medieval contraception, or unknowingly miscarried that is. The likely scenario is that she is infertile.

Jon Snow has to take on the Stark name ( something he should be able to do as king) or an ancient family that has endured for thousands of years could quite possibly die out in the most anti-climatic manner.

Now, she's obviously not male, and thus not a brother, so that seems to rule her out. But she now has the convenient ability of the Faceless Men to change faces, so I wonder if she could wear a man's face to fulfill the ""brother"" requirement of the prophecy. Who that would be, I don't know, but I doubt it would be Tyrion's or Jon's face. Maybe it could be Jamie's, but I'm not sure of the limitations of the Faceless men magic and whether or not her body could shapeshift into that of a man's.

I tend to believe that Lyanna Stark ran away with Rhaegar as opposed to being kidnapped but I've read quite a few posts that believe the latter. Do any of you think that Robert knew or perhaps suspected that he lost his woman fair and square and not forcibly? 

Like maybe deep down he knew that Lyanna didn't love him and that's why he resented all things Targaryen. Not the crazy brutal king and his mass flaming destruction, but the bruising if his male ego in an extremely patriarchal society.

Unless you think she was kidnapped, do you think his hatred was justified.

I burned. At first, in his confusion, he thought some archer on the wall had pierced him with a flaming arrowbut the fire had been inside him, consuming him. And the pain"")

What ""fire"" did he feel? 3 paragraphs prior, there is another vague quote [ADWD quote](#s ""They might not know it yet, but those balck-cloacked bastards would perish with the rest. The enemy is coming."") that seems to be referring to white walkers.

So is it possible that the first quote implies that whatever it is that raises the wytes in the books is also able to skin-change living creatures, like the eagle that Varamyr was skin-changed into? Was the burning he felt actually an icey burning as the great other or something took control of the living eagle that he was inside of?

I read this chapter twice yesterday, so I know that this chapter has a habit mentioning things in the beginning and then giving more details about them later on in the chapter. I'll finish rereading the chapter right now and edit this post if I find out any more details...

What do y'all think?

EDIT (adding more...this gets better)
[ADWD quote](#s ""Varamyr had died nine times before. He had died once from a spear thrust, once with a bears teeth in his throat, and once in a wash of blood as he brought forth a still born cub. He died his first death when he was only six, as his fathers axe crashed through his skull. Even that had not been so agonizing as the fire in his guts, crackling along his wings, devouring him. When he tried to fly from it, his terror fanned the flames and made them burn hotter. One moment he had been soaring above the Wall, his eagles eyes marking the movement of the men below. Then the flames had turned his heart into a blackened cinder and sent his spirit crashing back into his own skin, and for a little while hed gone mad. Even the memory was enough to make him shudder."")",15,3,False,self,,,,,

My choice is hard to make because Grenn was my favorite of Jon's night watch friends and in my top 5 for the show but Oberyn is in that top 5 as well. I think I would have to choose Oberyn though due to the fact that he hates the Lanisters the way he does and would have probably killed all of them had it not been for him getting his head crushed by the Mountain. He was also probably the best casting for the show in my opinion and cannot forget a complete badass with that spear.

- First thing: It's extremely hard to notice but if you are in fullscreen and keep replaying 5:12 you will see one dragon (drogon) snapping at one of his brothers Rhaegal or Viserion.

I never noticed it before and it seems there is some hostility between them still.

- Second thing: When watching this scene for the first 3 times I was sure that the main dragon on the screen from 5:12-5:18 was Drogon. It looks like him but you can clearly see from 5:17-5:18 that the dragon has no rider aka no Danny. So how could it be Drogon? It must be Rhaegal or Viserion right? I'm guessing the last one to fly up (the one who snapped) was Drogon. We all know the Drogon is the fiercest meaning he is the one most likely to snap. Maybe it was a friendly snap? Like a greeting?

It was a lot easier to tell them apart (the dragons) when they were younger...

Who would you pick as your champions and why?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/66c8m9/everything_you_are_wrongfully_accused_of_a/,ACNL,1492627811,"A Trial of Seven is a form of trial by combat in Westeros, such a trial was made infamous in the book, ""Dunk and Egg"".

In a trial of seven, you pick seven champions, including yourself, to fight against seven other men. Whoever wins is deemed to have the favor of the gods. If you had to enter such a trial, who would you want to champion your cause so that you had the best chance to win? You can pick any hero from past and present, but remember that who you leave out will most likely be your opponent...

    ACNL's Champions:

1. Ser Arthur Dayne - Regarded as one of the best swordsmen to ever live. Outnumbered at the Tower of Joy fight and only defeated because he was unfairly backstabbed.

2. Robert Baratheon - In his prime please. Defeated Rhaegar Targaryen at the battle of the Trident. Ned must make sure to whisper in Robert's ear that his opponent ""kidnapped and dishonored"" Lyanna.

3. Oberyn Martell - He nearly defeated the Mountain and hardly broke a sweat. If revenge was not his motive, I believe he would be less foolish.

4. Jaime Lannister - When he had two hands. When he was captured at the Whispering Wood, it took multiple men to take him down because he was so deadly.

5. Khal Drogo - Never defeated in battle. Had the longest braid among the Dothraki. 

6. Jorah Mormont - Dany must give him a token. 

7. ACNL - I would ask Brynden Rivers possess me.

        Conclusion:

That's my line-up. It's far from the best, but hey it's for fun. Pick it apart! No dragons but historical and character applicable weapons are allowed. I think a full Valyrian Steel line-up would also be very strong against foes without such weapons. 

    Strategy:

Remember, there is strategy involved in who you pick. For instance, you can stack your team with assassins and simply go after the accused or accuser and ""win"". If your team is too heavy on Kingsguard, you will be hard countered by a team consisting of kings like...Joffrey. Yes, you will lose to Joffrey. Also, keep in mind motives and relationships (Rhaegar and Robert on the same side will probably end up in a team-kill situation).




             Rules:

1. No dragons.
2. None of the champions can use magic. 
3. Melee weapons only. But throwing weapons allowed.
4. Doesn't have to be a knight.
5. No direwolves or stonemen or any other crazy stuff.",81,35,False,self,,,,,

Obviously, everyone watching the show knew Stannis had approximately a 0% chance of actually being the PtwP. Story-wise, it just would be boring to have the guy who was already SAID to be the PtwP end up BEING the PtwP.

But why? Why even bother saying that Stannis had anything to do with it?

I'm curious if the ""Lord of Light"" or whatever actually DID intend to make Stannis its champion, and showed Melisandre that he'd have to sacrifice Shireen to win the throne as a kind of final test.

Kind of an anti-[sacrifice of Isaac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_of_Isaac).

That is, in the Biblical story, the God asks Abraham to sacrifice his son, hoping to see that Abraham is 100% truly faithful to God.

The Lord of Light, on the other hand, asks Stannis to sacrifice his daughter, hoping to see that Stannis has principles BEYOND religion or desire for the throne/justice. And Stannis failed, of course, hence Jon Snow IMMEDIATELY heading on a direct course to becoming the PtwP afterward.

Even in the books, Jon gets killed DIRECTLY after we learn of Stannis's (alleged) demise. So one of the consistencies between the books and the show is that Jon dies RIGHT AFTER we learn that Stannis is dead.",28,35,False,spoiler,,,,,

Not all theories are mine in origin, as you will be able to tell. They're a combo of my own thoughts and theories all of us have come across.

First, I want to give some short general predictions for individual characters in a Part I of my predictions. Then, I'll give a Part II where I mention how the story itself will end.

Note that these are predictions for the **books**. Example - **This post contains phrases like ""Azor Ahai"" and ""Lightbringer"", which may be confusing to strictly show watchers who may not know what these are nor their significance**.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**PART I: ALL THE FAMILIES**

**The Starks**

Arya: After reconciling with her sister Sansa, and finishing enough of her list to a satisfying degree, she sets sail for West of Westeros, a place no one has ever returned from, and is never heard from again - thus become a legendary character of Westerosi folklore.

Sansa: Becomes the Queen of the North following Jon Snow's abdication. She never remarries and her reign will be modeled after Queen Elizabeth I's rule. [We know GRRM gets influence from real life figures].

Bran: Along with Samuel Tarly, he will provide more insight on the White Walkers' history, culture, and moreover their intentions. Bran's story ends with his physical death, but his spirit warging into a raven, becoming the new Brynden Rivers-type Bloodraven. Like Arya, he will fade into legend.

Benjen: Dies in the battle against the wights.

**The Lannisters**

Jaime: Kills Cersei in a scene of desperation, to stop her from burning down King's Landing. This fulfills the Valonquar prophecy, and bringing his story arc full circle - becoming a Queen slayer, in addition to his infamous King slayer reputation. Immediately after, in a state of grief, he hangs himself from the Red Keep tower.

Cersei: Killed by her twin brother, Jaime, thus fulfilling the prophecy.

Tyrion: The only surviving Lannister. Tyrion is the child of King Aerys the II Targaryean,a product of the rape of Joana Lannister,and that is why Twyin despises him. He gets Casterly Rock and ends his days as a bitter drunk. The silver lining for him is that he serves as an advisor and close friend to Sansa Stark. (He may be her Hand of the Queen, but it's difficult to say).

**The Baratheons**

Tommen: Killed by Cersei during a profound state of hysteria and paranoia.

Stannis: Unlike in the show, he finally sees through Melisandre's bullshit, but it is too late, as he, his army, and the Bolton's forces are wiped out by The Others.

**The Tyrells**

Whole family: Non-existent by the end of the story.

**The Targaryeans**

Aegon: Sits on the throne for a short time. Kicked out by Daenerys' army. Revealed to be a Blackfyre. Either forced into exile or executed.

Tyrion: As mentioned earlier, he is revealed to be half-Targaryean.

Varys: He is revealed to be loosely related to the Targaryeans, as he is a Blackfyre himself, the brother to Serra Blackfyre.

**The Greyjoys**

Euron: In the books, he is in possession of Dragonbinder. I think Euron dies in a second Kingsmoot to Theon Greyjoy.

Yara: She is captured, as she likely will be in the show, by Euron's fleet, and executed.

Theon: Becomes King of the Iron Islands.

**Other Characters**

Brienne: Ends up being Sansa's Queen's guard, finally serving a ruler she believes in.

Petyr Baelish; ""Littlefinger"": Attempts to pit the Stark children against each other, but is found out, and executed by them.

Varys: The Blackfyre Theory is confirmed. He and friend Illyrio Mopatis want Aegon on the throne due to affection for their Blackfyre family. The coldest of spiders' intentions are revealed to have been motivated by love. He dies during the battle between Daenerys' and Cersei's forces - possibly executed.

Thormund: Becomes the new King of the Wildlings and is granted possession of the Dreadfort by King in the North Jon Snow, prior to the latter's abdication.

Gendry: He lives, but I have no clue what happens to him. Maybe he gets legitimized and granted a lordship somewhere, or he becomes a world famous blacksmith.

Hodor: Dies in a very similar fashion to the show. The origin of his name is revealed in the same manner.

Gregor Clegane: Killed by his brother, Sandor.

Sandor Clegane: Saves Arya's life, mortally wounding himself in the process. His redemption arc comes to a close, and Arya kills him to end his suffering - knocking another name off her list, but it's honestly mercy and she doesn't enjoy it.

Samwell Tarly: Along with Bran, he finds important information on how to deal with the Walkers, based on what the previous Azor Ahai had done.

Jorah Mormont: Dies in a sacrifice to save Daenerys' life.

Bronn of the Blackwater: I think he survives the battle against the wights.

Davos Seaworth: He survives, becomes a commander of some kind or another.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**PART II: THE STORY**

It's important to note George RR Martin is vehemently anti-war and was an adamant objector to the Vietnam intervention. Secondly, he blurs the lines between good and evil. The White Walkers are a metaphor for Weapons of Mass Destruction, or WMDs. They represent the threat that man is in danger of inflicting on themselves. The Children of the Forrest created them as a weapon of defense against men. Now, most of the COTF are wiped out. The WWs now want to destroy man. If that isn't symbolism for nuclear holocaust, I don't know what is.

However, the WWs also want something else.....

We know that they once arrived to a peace eight thousands years ago with the original Azor Ahai, and we know Craster reached an agreement with them, sacrificing his sons to them. This shows they can be reasoned with to a large extent.

Personally, I think they are responding to Jon's birth. The prevalence of WW sightings across the North spiked in the last fourteen years (Jon is this age when the story starts). There is some kind of fascination with Jon Snow.

You may know where I'm going with this. The only way this thing can end -

Is through Peace.

**Where It Ends**: The God's Eye, right where it all began thousands of years ago.

Some type of peace is brokered with the Walkers on the God's Eye, where I believe we see Howland Reed, one of the last green-seers, and Bran explaining to Jon what the walkers want.

What do the WWs want?

*They want to finally die*...

They didn't ask to be created, they just represent the physical manifestation of humans killing each other. Battered corpses.

I think dragon glass has something to do with it. In the show, we saw how the first walker was created with the shard being jammed into his chest.

Bran will tell Jon that he needs to pull it out of the Night's King, but that doings so would cause his death as well through fire. The NK will allow him to do so. Jon pulls it out of Night's King, and almost right away the surviving walkers all collapse into piles of dust.

Jon collapses and dies in the company of Davos Seaworth, Bran, Howland Reed, Thormund, and some other wildling survivors.

However, it's not quite done, yet....

Daenerys Targaryean will die. She won't turn mad like her father Aerys II Targaryean....But she also won't sit on the Iron Throne.

I think she dies in childbirth, to Jon's child, but Jon will never know she is pregnant.

She is not at the God's Eye during Jon's death, but knows of it because she dies after him - at Winterfell.

**Hear me out**....

**There's a pattern of childbirth deaths in this story. Dany's mother died giving birth to her. Jon's mother died giving birth to him. Tyrion's mother died giving birth to him**.

Dany won't survive this story. She has to die, failing to grab the Iron Throne, but giving life to their child.

And this child, like Jon Snow, will be a symbol of an ushering in of a new era.

One of the main reasons for Robert's Rebellion was the affair between Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark. Rhaegar never lived to see his son born. Jon won't either.

Jon himself represents the bridge of peace between two houses that were at war with each other - Stark &amp; Targaryean.

This child will be the sword plunged into the heart of Azor Ahai's love, Nissa Nissa. **THE CHILD IS LIGHTBRINGER**.

Martin uses metaphors in his talks of visions, legendary folklore, etc. Lightbringer is not a literal sword.
Jon and Dany's deaths mirror that of Rhaegar and Lyanna.

In the end, when the peace is made, Westeros will pick up the pieces and rebuild itself from the ashes - the Iron Throne no longer existent, and the Seven Kingdoms broken up into independent states set up to self govern.",35,30,False,self,,,,,

Whether it was a mistake, a warning, an instruction, or a message to Jaimie, for the sake of this post lets operate under the assumption that it was indeed Bran telling *someone* to Burn Them All!

At the end of the day this is the *song* of ice and fire. Songs, by nature, repeat themselves and/or have a certain rhythm and pattern. I think the pattern were witnessing with Bran and Jaimie goes like this (please indulge my predictions): Bran tells Mad King to burn them all. Jaimie kills The Mad King, forever tarnishing his legacy and warping his image in the minds of the common people which would have an effect on Jaimies personality over the many years hes had to hear himself be called Kingslayer. He turns to the only person who really loves him, Cercei, and we know what a fantastic influence she can be. Fast forward seventeen years, Jaimie is who he is, and pushes Bran out the window to protect the only real relationship Jaimie had at the time. Bran gets paralyzed, becomes the Three-Eyed Raven. But I wonder, if in fact Bran was responsible for putting Jaimie in a position to break his oath, did he deserve to get pushed out the window? Maybe deserve is a strong word, maybe Jaimie deserved revenge even though he didnt know he was exacting it.

My prediction for the end of the Bran/Jamie arc is during the final battle Bran is warging into a Dragon or a White Walker or an entire Wight army leaving his body prone and open to attack. Just as his body is about to be swarmed by Wights Jaimie jumps in to defend him. Jaimie goes down in a blaze of glory protecting the kid he tried to kill in the beginning of our story. He gives Bran just enough time to do something important with the warging, gaining redemption in the process. Maybe Bran shares his visions with Jaimie right before he dies so they come to a mutual understanding and forgive each other. Maybe he takes Jaimie back to that moment and lets him hear Burn Them All as an instruction on what hes supposed to do when bran brings him back in a few minutes or seconds.

So, I guess the question is  If you think Bran is responsible for Burn Them All! then is Jaimie somewhat justified, in hindsight (no pun intended), in pushing him out of the window? ",18,0,False,self,,,,,
1554,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2017-4-20,2017,4,20,12,66f5ag,self.gameofthrones,[EVERYTHING] Predicting when the first full-length Season 7 trailer will drop.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/66f5ag/everything_predicting_when_the_first_fulllength/,LouisAce13,1492657884,"(TL;DR at the bottom) As we all know, Season 7 is starting later than usual. Many people, including me, are getting anxious waiting for the first full-length trailer to release. Here, I aim to use Season 6's marketing to predict when Season 7's first full trailer will drop.

It was around this time last year when Season 6 began, and prior to the premiere, 3 teasers and two trailers were released. 

[The first teaser](https://youtu.be/IxI8aPISq8I) for Season 6 was released in December 2015, a whole 5 months before the Season 6 premiere. This was followed by the [House Banner Teasers](https://youtu.be/H68jBjb5XbQ) which came out the next month, January. The last teaser for Season 6, [The Hall of Faces Teaser](https://youtu.be/OmrA8nOZF2Q), came out in February. 3 teasers were released in 3 consecutive months. 

In early March, roughly 47 days before the Season 6 Premiere, [the first full-length trailer](https://youtu.be/yu8eRaq1FUM) was released. [The second trailer ](https://youtu.be/EI0ib1NErqg) came out the following month - April - which was the same month as the premiere.

Now, let's apply this scheduling to Season 7's marketing so far. [The first official teaser (Sigils)](https://youtu.be/Qq0B0NVKghA) was released in early March, roughly 5 months before Season 7's premiere (July 16). Then, at the very end of March, [this promo](https://youtu.be/JxWfvtnHtS0) dropped. That was the last bit of the Season 7 marketing thus far.

If we apply the previous pattern of a teaser each month for 3 consecutive months, then (if we are not counting the promo), another teaser should be released this month, and one final teaser should be released some time in May.

This leads us to the most important conclusion. The first Season 6 trailer dropped the month before the premiere after 3 months of teasers. This means that the first Season 7 trailer will likely drop early June (or late May if we are guessing it will drop 47 days before the premiere). A second trailer will probably come out early July.

TL;DR/Conclusion: There will likely be a teaser released later this month, a final teaser released next month, and the first trailer will probably come out late May or early June. The final trailer will probably come out early July.

https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/66bln8/spoilers_main_why_havent_these_2_houses/

Thanks to a fellow asoiaf reddit responder, they posted this in the comments. Pretty interesting stuff.
(per @Bearhobag):

""It's actually a plot point. The mixing of Stark and Targaryen blood is what caused the resurgence of the Others, and thus is what's indirectly bringing about the 2nd Long Night.

Mance Rayder visits Winterfell between 284 and 286 and deserts within two years. Almost immediately he notices the Others are coming back, and that they pose a threat to all the Wildings. That'd be roughly in 287-290.

Jon Snow is born in 283. His birth causing the resurgence of the Others makes a lot more sense than Summerhall (259; ~30 years before Mance Rayder notices the Others) or Dany's dragons hatching (299; ~10 years after Mance notices the Others).""

What do you guys think? This has probably been the best reason as to why the Others have come back after thousands of years, and something i wasnt expecting when i posted about stark/targ marriages. ",10,43,False,spoiler,,,,,

Forgive me if this is answered in the books, but I'm currently just finishing up AGOT.
Ser Ilyn uses Ned's great sword to behead him, and the sword stays in KL until Tywin reforges it in the episode Two Swords.
What took him so long? He stayed in KL since his arrival during the Battle of Blackwater. The only comment he has about it, when giving Oathkeeper to Jaime, is that he got it from someone who no longer has use for it.
My only conclusion is that he was waiting until Robb had been defeated and he's considering it an act of victory.
Thoughts or answers?

If you are then keep reading, if not then screw you.

The way it would work is everyone would get 3 characters to play as, though they must be in seperate lands. Cant have all of them in The North or Essos, ect... Having 3 characters to play with also adds to the classic Game of Thrones feel, because they can die very easily. I havent fleshed a lot of this out yet so whoever gets in early can help me decide rules and storyline. Here are some of the things I was thinking to make this game work:

People in different kingdoms (different voice rooms) will not be able to communicate with one another unless they send a raven (via text chat, with limited number of words)
None of the living show or book characters will feature in this campaign as NPC's or Playable characters.
The game will have a dungeon master for each of the 7 kingdoms and Essos, so if you have experience as a DM (Like I dont) get in early and you can be one.
Dungeon Masters will have 2 characters to play as, but they cannot be in whatever kingdom they are DM of.

Again, all this is being fleshed out and requires interest from you guys to actually go forward. I have very little experience with setting up D&amp;D games so any help is much appreciated.

Suggestions are also welcomed, I need all the help I can get.",4,2,False,self,,,,,

Some think they are introducing Jon, Davos, and possibly Howland but first hey are looking up not down or straight. Some think it is the dragons but while that is possible they have seem them do alot of stuff so what would surprise them now. here are my four theories on what it could be.

1. Starting in no order number 1 is that it is whatever of Stannis's forces stayed after he left. This is unlikely sense i do not think they would stay that long like why would they stay that long makes straight up no sense.

2. It's Jorah returning this could be likely as Dany would be awaiting his arrival but at the same time though would not be just a private reunion and not other people with her as well. That being said this one is also highly likely in my opinion.

3. Now this is where we get into crazy crackpot theory time and for number 3 is that they are being introduced to Howland Reed who has return from doing research at the god's eyer and is at Dragonstone waiting for Jon and Dany. Need i say more.

4. They are being introduced to Young Griff AKA Aegon the VI Targaryen and that he got to Dragonstone first. Also after Viserys and Drogo dead Young Griff became plan B just in case something happened to Dany. Also he's got the golden company as well as House Dayne, House Connington, and a army made up of Mercenaries and pirates from Bravvos, Myr, Tyrosh, and Pentos. This one is crazy and may not happen but still imagine how cool it would be if Aegon was in season 7 and they kept it hush hush.",11,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Lets assume that either Sansa doesn't go to find Jon or she arrives after he's already left.

Before Sansa came to castle black, Jon wanted to leave the watch, only telling his friend Edd he would go ""south"". What do you think his plan was before Sansa arrived?

If he had left, Jon would have eventually learned of Sansa's fate at Ramsey's hands. Do you think he would have gone to find her anyway?

Personally I think if it wasn't for Sansa, Jon would have been completely lost. He fought and he lost, but Sansa's presence reminded him that the lone wolf dies but the pack survives.

When he touches the tree, we get to see
1) snowing in the throne room
2) a brief glimpse of the Night King
3) a dragon flying over kings landing

Obviously we all expect Daenaerys to reach kings landing this coming season, but I thought it was really interesting because it seems as though winter will actually hit kings landing, as opposed to danys visions in the house of the undying because those seemed mostly metaphorical at the time.

Also IIRC this is actually the first time we got to see the Night King, and there is only ONE dragon shadow flying over kings landing. Thought this was really subtle foreshadowing in an episode that was dominated by Joffrey's death. 

Possibly foreshadowing that not all of the dragons will get to kings landing due to some sea battle with Euron? It would probably be too soon to have 2/3 dragons die before daenerys even gets to kings landing but the vision as a whole seems to definitely be a clue about the dragons' importance to the White Walker battles. 

Since we already saw that Bran's visions include future events (S6E6: when downloading the three eyed raven's knowledge we see the wildfire exploding under the sept), any thoughts about what this might mean?

Nah not really, but I do hope the harp theory is true, where Lyanna had Rhaegar's harp at the Tower of Joy, since Rhaegar wouldn't have needed it, so Ned took it with him on the journey back home, putting it either in her crypt/tomb or her actual statue. Once Jon is curious, he goes down to see her statue, facing his fear or whatever of the crypt. Somehow, he opens the tomb, and sees a black bundle embraced by her skeleton, so he opens it, tossing the old musty fabric away, and sees the silver harp. Then, puts it back down, looks at the fabric, to see it was her Targaryen wedding cloak, emblazoned with the red dragon.

But that doesn't actually mean Joffrey, Tommen and Myrcella are definetely not Robert's children. They could still be. If normal genetics apply to Westerosi people (which I absolutely think they do) it's totally possible that at least one of them was Robert's child. It's not probable but absolutely possible for a blond haired woman and a dark haired man to have blond children. 

Now I don't actually see this as a flaw in the story. Given all the knowledge and information that was available to Eddard, he had to believe the kids were Jaime's bastards, and he's probably right. But think about the implications. What if the whole war of the five kings was started because of a flaw in Ned's reasoning and the Lannisters were really telling the truth. 

PS I know it is heavily implied in the show, that Robert rarely ejaculated inside Cersei, but I just find the idea of Joffrey really being Robert's son to be interesting. 

PPS Even if all three of them were Robert's that of course wouldn't undo the love-making of Cersei with Jaime, which is gross and weird.",6,0,False,self,,,,,

I don't know how we will reach this point but I am so convinced I have it figured out I have to share. My theory runs under the assumption that Jon is Azor Ahai, not Dany.

So Dany is about to arrive in Westeros. While she has the support of Highgarden and Dorne, I still feel like she will want extra allies, and who better than the King in the North himself. Again, this is nothing new. This is what people expect.

Originally, Dany marries Jon for political purposes. Similar to her marriage to Drogo, it started out as a political move but it ends up growing, to the point where she actually loves Jon.

In the books, when Dany is in the House of the Undying in Qarth, she is prophesied to have 3 betrayals, one for blood (Miir Maz Dur who kills Drogo because of what his army did), one for gold (which I think is Jorah) and finally, one for love. This could be Dario, however, I think it will be in the climax of the show, with Jon 'betraying' Dany.

Azor Ahai has a famous sword, Lightbringer. This is a burning sword which Azor Ahai quenched (on his third attempt) by plunging the sword through the heart of his wife. Dany is the definition of Fire. So as Jon is forging the sword (or potentially Gendry, since they did emphasize that he was a smith) Jon will be told the only way to quench the blade and to save the world is by plunging the sword through Dany's heart. How we get to this point, however, I don't know.

The story is called 'A song of Ice and Fire'. It is the story of both Jon (Ice) and Dany (fire).",27,17,False,spoiler,,,,,

Ser Davos served King Stannis faithfully for several years, and always offered sensible council. He has extensive military experience after the war of the Five Kings. Davos is well travelled and knowledgeable due to his years as a smuggler as well.

Sansa Stark, on the other hand, knows Jon's enemies in the south better that anyone. Her years at King's Landing thought her how Cersei Lannister operates. Petyr's teachings at the Vale has made her an avid player of the game too. After how she killed Ramsey, she has also proven to have a strong constitution and has what it takes to make hard decisions.

He's also beaten a Night's Watch veteran during sparring in his first training session at the wall.

On top of all this, the dude is incredibly fast, and his reaction time during fights is crazy.

Jon Snow in my opinion, is overrated, he struggles against every opponent he's fought except for people who were beginners at the time like Rast, Grenn, etc.

He has grown of course, but in my opinion, Gared Tuttle could take someone like Qhorin Halfhand or Karl.

It seems like they don't know that Jon rose from the dead and don't bother to mention Jon's desertion either.

When he goes to the other Houses for aid (House Glover, House Mormont for example) they are hesitant to join him based on the fact that most of his men are comprised of wildlings. None showed him disdain or rejected him solely because of his desertion and about the oath he broke, and none seemed to mention if he really did die and come back from death. Still that doesn't mean word of his desertion hasn't gone round, Ramsey himself called him out as a deserter before the Battle of the Bastards.

Now after the BotB where Jon calls all the Northern Houses at Winterfell, all these Houses that refused him proclaim him as their King. At this stage they look like even bigger hypocrites because not only did they refuse the call they are proclaiming a Bastard King that has deserted from his cause and leadership and broke trust with some of their Gods so what doesn't make them stop and question just for a second 'Snow what the fucks going on here? Explain yourself'

Of coarse he never really did break any oaths or actually desert but from a Northerners perspective what reasons would make you want to back him as your 'King In The North'? Especially if they knew he left the Night's Watch and handed his leadership to Edd why dont they question this at all? And how are you willing to accept without real evidence that Jon actually rose from the dead but choose to not inquire Jon at any stage? And if they did know wouldn't more rally to Jon's cause before botb? (Still theres no evidence that the Northerners knew of his resurrection) I mean many honourable houses showed a lot of disdain to the oathbreaker Jamie Lannister so why is Jon no different? Ignorance may be the answer but theres a difference between being ignorant and looking like a damned hypocrite in this case.

Still its funny how Jon tried to be honourable as he could but still got spat down upon by all of his peers up until his death. Then after his death and resurrection everyones willing to pledge their lives to his cause.

PS. Maybe Littlefinger and Cersei are going to use these facts to challenge Jon's leadership but Jon is looking like one of the most proficient commander of his time",26,19,False,self,,,,,

This makes so much sense when you really think about it and I just wrote a fucking novel on mobile with more details but got wiped clean because I didn't post spoilers and wouldn't let me repost. I got this idea watching S1 EP8 when Ned asks him to cut his throat and he says ""Not Today"" which is what Syrio also says in a few scenes prior. Varys is a FM who worships the God of Death ( what do we say to the god of death?) and all of his actions, just like Littlefinger, are to create chaos and kill off all the great houses and powerful people in the 7 kingdoms. The IB can then swoop in and take over the lands. As mentioned in the show, the Throne is in serious debt to the IB which was most likely anticipated by the IB, and now they are going to get their payment in the form of the entire continent. Varys is speeding up the process and couldn't care less about Targs or anybody else.

He even looks (dresses) and sounds like the guy that spoke with Stannis at the IB.

That Giant is referring to Littlefinger (House Baelish's sigil is a Giant's head) and castle built of snow is now literally and figuratively here. Sansa built Winterfell out of snow while she was in the Vale and with Jon being the King, the castle is figuratively built of Snow.

1899,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2017-4-25,2017,4,25,1,67abwy,self.gameofthrones,[EVERYTHING] Renly Baratheons What-If,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/67abwy/everything_renly_baratheons_whatif/,dynastyfreak,1493053065,"we do a lot of debating on this sub regarding Robb Stark alternative outcomes. But I hardly see mention of one of the Baratheon brothers. So I'm going to propose a what-if scenario for who I believe deserved to sit on the Iron Throne, Renly Baratheon where he doesn't die by his brothers magic.

At the time of Robert Baratheons death Renly could do 1 of 3 things...


**1. He could support Stannis claim to the Iron Throne.** Knowing the Baratheon kids were not legitimate heirs, Renly could have allied the whole Baratheons and Tyrells (formally marrying Margaery) against the Lannisters and KL instead of opposing his brother (which ultimately led to his death). With the Lannister army tied up with the Tullys/Starks this course would have resulted in a quick victory for House Baratheon with Stannis proclaimed King of the 7-Kingdoms and Renly being his heir-apparent, at least if/until Stannis produced a male heir. At this point it would have been easier to hire a faceless man (thru Loras Tyrells money) to kill his brother/red woman and become King as Stannis heir.

**2. He could support Jeoffrey Baratheon's claim to the Iron Throne.** While Renly knew of the illegitimacy of the Baratheon children, he would see that his brother was going to fight for the crown and would have divided the Baratheon houses. Had Renly had pledged for House Baratheon of KL, then the Tyrell and Baratheons for Renly would have made quick work of Stannis assault of KL while Lannisters are in Riverlands. Then with the Tyrell/Baratheon army already in the KL vicinity and his brother Stannis out of the way, Renly could have switched support of the claim for himself and the Tyrell/Baratheon army sack KL and kill the Baratheon kids. This scenario is a little trickier because Cersei/the Lannisters aren't as trusting so its possible that Renly might have just needed to stay out of the fight with his armies until Stannis was destroyed or dwindled his number of troops after KL attack.

**3. He could support his own claim for the Iron Throne.** This is the course he actually took and it lead to his untimely death. The argument could be made however that without the Red Woman, Renly very likely was going to defeat Stannis in open battle and easily take KL with 100k Tyrells and some 20k+ Baratheons. The Lannisters were still tied up in the Riverlands and wouldn't leave the Westerlands alone just to save Cersei and the kids. Even more awesome was that nobody could/would face a combined Tyrell/Baratheon army in open battle, which is why House Tyrell in open rebellion to the crown decided to support a second in line as opposed to Stannis. The Tyrells were essentially trying to be King-Makers and had/have the largest army in Westeros to do so. 

...throughout any of these three scenarios, Renly Baratheon knew the game well enough to become King and likely would have stayed King. What he wasn't counting on was Stannis magic, other than that he had everything in place to make himself King. He knew Baelish, he knew Varys, he knew politics &amp; people, and was supported by the fact he was Warden of the Stormlands and had the backing of House Tyrell.

The worrier: Jon He has repeatedly shown his Strength in battle

The Maiden: This one could be a few people first it could be r Brienne as far as we know she is a maiden and is portrayed as the protector of the Innocent. The other could be Sansa even though ramsey raped her Maidenhood is brought up on many occasions And knowing what she has gone through she would probably not want that to happen to anyone else.

The crone: Olena She is old and wise

So my theory is based on what I've seen and read about the books on the internet. So here it goes. 

As per a very popular theory the three heads of the dragons would be Tyrion, Dany and Jon. With Jon being the prince that was promised. Jorah mormont would be azor ahai which he will become by bringing Lightbringer to life by piercing Dany's heart. I think that's so because azor ahai and the prince that was promised are used interchangeably but it has never been mentioned that they are the same person. After which he will become the Lord commander of king's guard. Also I think that one of Dany's dragon will become the night king's mount that would solve the problem of the third dragon rider when Dany dies according to my theory.

Sansa and Tyrion would rule the north as husband and wife. Arya would go on her expedition about which she told that theatre actress.

I'm rewatching a few seasons of GoT to get ready for season 7. Re-watching the scene where Tyrion kills Tywin at the end of season 4 got me thinking...

Is there any evidence (presumably from the books) that Tywin was telling the truth about not intending to execute Tyrion? Earlier in the season, Tywin made a deal with Jaime to spare Tyrion's life by sending him to the wall in exchange for Jaime taking his place as Tywin's heir. This is something Tywin desperately wanted to happen for his own legacy. Did Tywin plan to honor his end of the deal, despite how things went with the trial, so Jaime would be forced to keep his end? Or, was this just Tywin pleading with the end of a crossbow and saying anything he could to diffuse the situation?

I'm especially curious if there are any additional insights from the books that might speak to this.",11,13,False,self,,,,,

I don't know how anyone who wasn't a fan of the show ever got into the first book. The entire first book was so dreary some and boring. It was a toll just to get through it. Props where it is though, book one and season one of the show are like word for word the same, minus some things that don't make sense in TV format. 

The second book was really good though. Picked up nicely and was pretty enjoyable to read. But again, it's the same as the show. For anyone actually curious, the show and the books are essentially the same or get the same result for like the first 3 and a half books. The middle of book four, when we start getting into jaimie's story is where it starts to slowly deter. 

A feast for crows was boring beyond all means. My God was that a trudging read. All of brieannes story was boring and I skimmed so hard in these sections. I can see why the show made up a new thing for her to do. 

And finally, I just finished the last book, and that's where it actually becme fun to read. Prince aegon not in the show but in the  books was really cool. And trying different journey was also really insightful. Don't really understand why the gave jorah grey scale though, that's pretty lame. Or why the killed of bariston the bold, when he was super cool, even in the show when he got little to no screen time. 

All in all, they're both great journeys, but people saying the books are so drastically different and are soooo much better, don't really seem to make much sense. They're pretty similar if not near identical in the first 3-4 seasons. ",49,33,False,spoiler,,,,,

When Arya knocks over the candle we all assume that she kills the waif since she can fight blind while the waif can't. But maybe the waif also went through a similar training process. I just think it's weird that a show known for its graphic killings would choose to not show such a highly anticipated fight that would have for sure been a fan favorite.
Throughout the show we get the vibe that the waif is a bitter person who doesn't like her position in life, what I think might have happened was that the waif faked her death by swapping faces with Arya after killing her. this way Jaquan Hagar will chase after Arya (who is already dead) while the waif can pursue her dreams or something.
It would be pretty cool if the finale for season seven is you find out that Arya was dead a whole season already without anyone knowing seems like a really cool GOT plot twist.

Why doesn't Brienne tell Sansa that Arya is alive? Especially in s6 she had ample opportunity to mention the encounter, regardless of whether she can still say she's alive and well, she can still relate that she was at that point.

Does it differ in the books? Does she ever mention it or does that encounter not happen at all?

My idea is that somehow maybe Ayra or Sansa will end up close enough or captured by some means in Cersei's hands.

This theory comes mainly from the TV series, but the idea originated to me after reading ASOS and past episodes.

Melisandre is the main key here.  She brought Jon Snow back to life (hence the spoiler tag), because that was what the Lord of Light ""willed"" according to Mel.  She met Jon in the first place by travelling North with Stannis and Davos.  Following The Winds of Winter, (thanks to Davos), the Red Woman is banished from the North, which is fine because the LoL has united the North through Melisandre and Jon Snow.  Will she go to Dragonstone? Will she meet up with the Brotherhood and the Hound? Or will she somehow go to King's Landing and meet Jaime?  If she does end up in KL, her next job will to unite the South in the fight against the Others.  Since the Lannisters are basically the only faction not in the alliance with the rest of Westeros, Jaime will be the key to uniting all of the country.  First, however, he must kill Queen Cersei (which is a whole different discussion).  Jaime concedes the throne to Daenerys or Jon (or anybody), and as Warden of the West and Lord of Casterly Rock, teams with everybody in the war.  Jaime becomes Kingslayer for the second time by murdering Cersei.  And most importantly he will be the one to kill the Night's King with Oathbreaker (Brienne is going to die in the show, that is something they would do), and he is Kingslayer once again.  Jaime is a natural Kingslayer, so this would make sense.  He is Azor Ahai because he will defeat the others by 1. killing the Night's King 2. inadvertently building the wall.  Jaime, the Azor Ahai, the Kingslayer, and the new creator of the Three Eyed Raven.  By pushing Bran out the window at Winterfell, him and Bran are somewhat ""connected"".  I say Jaime built the Wall because Bran would actually have to be Bran the Builder, who constructed the Wall in the first place.  So in short: Jaime protected Westeros by unintentionally building the Wall from the Others, then finished the deed by murdering their leader.

Thanks for the read.  Where am I wrong? 

 (Quick interesting side theory: Samwell discovers at Oldtown the truth of Jon Targaryen, reveals this, then Jaime and Daenerys marry...  Alternatively, Sam finds that Cersei and Jaime are the twins of Aerys and Joanna, then Daenerys pardons him because they are blood, but then there would be no point to the Tower of Joy...)",8,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

There is a fight with the mountain and kingsgaurd vs the hound and Arya.  The mountain kills Arya and the hound becomes enraged and kills the mountain.  Then the hound chokes out Cercei, checking off the last name on Arya's list. The hound dies of mortal wounds. The city surrenders and is mostly saved from being destroyed by dragon fire.

BUT BITCH i was surprissed i swear after the first season i binged the whole series in like a week .. ive subscribed to amazon and HBO to watch it .. and oh my god this is the best show i have ever seen it is soooo amazing and interesting and ive forced everyone who havent watched it to watch it .. its like harry potter all over again im obsesseeed girl and im proud to say im a GoT geek .. ive watched the series twice now and everytime i lose my shits at every twist (especially the rains of castamere S3E9 i cried for a whole week) UGH GOD IM SO FUCKING EXCITED FOR SEASON 7 .. i mean i know its good but i just cant hold it ..

Personally I think it is very possible that could be a twist and it could happen but if you read the title of the video you know there may be a twist to it but let's get to the requirements Jaime fits first:

- First Jaime was Reborn admits salt and Smoke. The Smoke being when he saved Brienne from being raped and got his hand chopped off afterwards the smoke being from the fire near them. and the salt was later when he whined into the bath proclaiming he ""Was"" that hand.

- There is a theory that Tyrion is Tywins true son and Jaime and Cersei are really the mad king's bastards. If this is true then Jaime has the blood.

- In one of the first images for season 7 we see Jaime with Widow's wail this could be his lightbringer.

- Now Jaime has not awakened dragons from stone but he could either A. Awaken some dragon eggs under dragon stone or B. when he finds out he is targaryen then he would awaken the dragon within himself.

- Finally his Nissa Nissa I think will be Cersei. He pushed Bran out of a tower for her, He whined to war for her, he joined the kingsguard for her, and whined to Dorne in the show and the riverlands in the books for her. Also if the theory of Cersei becoming the night queen is true then Jaime could have to kill her to forge the blade and stop her from more carnage.

- Oh and he was most likely under the red comet when it was shooting through the sky.

So yes it is indeed possible there could be a twist where Jaime is Azor Ahai. But if you read the title you know I have a twist that there are two saviors. Jaime being Azor Ahai and the other being TPTWP, Jaime is Fire the other hero is ice, etc. So let's look at the three candidates for who could be TPTWP.

- Jon Snow. Jon was reborn admits smoke when he was resurrected as there was a fire near him when he was resurrected. He was born admits salt from the tears of his mother Lyanna and born under and bleeding star. Sir Arthur Dayne's sword. He is also a Targaryen and his lightbringer is longclaw. He will either awaken dragons from stone by either A. Awakening the winterfell dragon B. Awakening the dragon within him when he finds out C. have a ritual where he not only awakens dragon eggs like Dany and resurrect his father Rhaegar via fire pyre and not only awaken dragons out of stone but also awaken his father Rhaegar out of stone (the crypts) or D. conceive a child with Dany or Sansa and when the child is born it will be awakening a dragon (the child) out of stone (the whom). As for his Nissa Nissa well only one person comes to mind....Sansa Stark.

- Bran Stark. He was under the red comet, Reborn admits salt and smoke when he reemerged from the crypts, If he wargs into a dragon he has the blood metaphorically, His lightbringer is the dragon he wargs, Nissa Nissa is Meera, and I have not made a strong connection to awakening dragons from stone yet but it could happen later in the show and books.

- Jorah Mormont. Jorah was reborn admits salt and smoke when he witnessed dany's rebirth, He was under the red comet, he was also there when the dragons awakened meaning in a sense he awakened them out of stone, and finally lightbringer this is where my theory comes in that the three heads are not three saviors but three sacrifices. First the Water...Jon Snow, Then the Lion Tyrion Lannister, and Finally Nissa Nissa his love Daenerys.

So to recap Jaime is Azor Ahai and either Jon, Bran, or Jorah are the TPTWP and both will save the world from the white walkers as they combined are the song of ice and fire (Jaime=Fire, Jon, Bran, or Jorah=Ice)",10,0,False,self,,,,,

I just wanted to share a thought that I have been having lately about Bran's end game and could have a potentially big impact in the battle against the dead. 

There has been as many people have talked about a great emphasis on warging abilities and Bran's abilities that he learned from the three-eyed raven. The inclusion of six skins and dedicating so much information to him seems to be of special significance and the inclusion of the chapter is more evidence that warging is of great importance in the story of Ice and Fire

All the information we have been given about warging has never been that it is completely healthy and 100% safe, you can lose yourself in the animal as you become more beast than man, it can break your mind as it did to Hodor and the woman that six skins warged into. It is considered an abomination as Varamyr's mentor Haggon told him, a dirty power in some regards, depending on the user and what he chooses to do with his ability. 

We have been shown that Bran has the ability to warg into other humans, I wonder if any man has ever tried to warg into an undead human, a white. Bran is by far as we have seen the most powerful vessel through which this ability has shown itself for many many years, possibly ever. (To my knowledge but I could very well be wrong here!) Could he warg into the Night King to lead his army away from Westeros, if all hope seems lost and it is the only hope for what's left of manking, could this be a possibility for the bittersweet ending that George was talking about. 

In doing so I believe bran would stay sane enough to lead the army away long enough for mankind to regroup and reform, is this possibly a cycle that keeps repeating itself, is westeros doomed to repeat this cycle until the Warg eventually loses himself completely and becomes once again the Night King that starts his conquest over?

I'd love to see what you people think about this or see if there is as i'm sure there may be some vital faws in this to put this theory to bed!

I tend to believe when it comes to GOT nothing is to be assumed.

I just imagine their married life sitting across from each other at a table just staring intently.

But DUH they are still cousins...so damn...
Daenerys cannot carry on her bloodline (what's the point of taking the throne if she can't carry on her bloodline? I suppose that's where the idea that she wants to ""break the wheel"" maybe suggesting implementing a democratic type system to the Seven Kingdoms)...but Jon can so that's interesting.

Many are technically dead already, with only surviving bastards, and for the others, the only survivor(s) are in perilous positions.  How will this shape up at the end of the series? Which will survive, and which will perish? What other houses can take their place? 

**House Stark** 

*Surviving full-blooded members* 
* Bran
* Sansa 
* Arya 

*Surviving Bastards* 

Jon Snow (Technically a Targaryen) 

Outlook: It will depend on which aspect Jon decides to embrace. Although a true Targaryen, he is now King in the North. He was also legitimized by Robb shortly before his death. It doesn't seem likely Bran will ever have kids, as his path leads somewhere else, nor Arya. Sansa could take up the mantle of House Stark and keep it going for the future generations, however.

**House Lannister** 

*Surviving Members* 

Jaime
Cersei
Tyrion 

*Outlook* Probably has the best outlook of all the major houses, despite the death of all 3 of Cersei's children. Both Jaime and Tyrion are still capable of producing children

**House Tully**

*Surviving Members* 
Edmure Tully 
Edmure's newborn son

Outlook: The fate of House Tully rides on one man and his only son, by Roslin Frey. Comparatively speaking though, they have a great outlook. 

**House Arryn**

*Surviving Members* 
Robin Arryn

Outlook: Not looking good. The fate of House Arryn rides on a small, sickly, and likely soon to be killed off boy. 

**House Baratheon** 

*Surviving Members*
None

*Surviving Bastards* 
Gendry 

Outlook: Will he ever stop rowing? 

**House Tyrell** 

*Surviving Members* Olenna Tyrell
*Surviving Bastards* None 

Outlook: Unless there is a hidden Tyrell somewhere, the house is already dead, with nothing but an angry grandmother left. 

**House Martell** 

*Surviving Members:* None
*Surviving Bastards* The Sand Snakes

Outlook: Please just let it end.

What we do know, is that Westeros is massive. For example, it takes a few weeks to travel between Winterfell and King's Landing on horseback. 

This is why the raven is so important. It is the only reliable way the Lords of Westeros can communicate relatively quickly. Now I know they aren't perfect, but ravens seemly can travel hundreds of miles in a day for people to receive news as quickly as they do. 

This is why ravens are the single most important thing keeping the Seven Kingdoms together. Without them, it would be impossible to know the state of affairs throughout the realm. It would be much too easy for people to rebel and you not know until they show up at your gates. These creatures are what makes the Iron Throne so far ahead of its time as a form of government.

The medieval system was always a form of decentralized government. While smaller lords could declare fealty to a greater lord(the king), the small lords still pretty much had total authority over their lands most of the time. One of the few times one saw the King exercising his power, was during a war when he called his vassals to help him. 

In a medieval system it was hard to have common law across the entire kingdom. Lesser lords could pretty much do as they please. It wasn't even a guarantee that most people could speak the same language in the same kingdom. In France for example, what we know as modern french didn't become widespread until after the French revolution. Before that, French citizens all spoke their own regional dialects of the language.

One of the reasons we didn't see centralized governments arise in our world until the last 200 years was due to a lack of quick and reliable mode of communication. After the invention of the locomotive and the telegraph, we started to see governments evolve into the centralized modern nation estates of today. 

The telegraph and locomotive are also what allowed the United States to expand west. Without these two key forms of communication and transportation, the US would have never been able to take and hold the lands west of the Appalachians.

Now don't get me wrong, the Iron Throne is very much a feudal monarchy; but it shares some things in common with modern centralized nation estates. It has a common currency used by all, as well as a common language. The king seems to have broad authority to dictate law across the whole realm. An example of this would be when king Jaehaerys I Targaryen banned the first night tradition, or when Tommen decided to ban trial by combat. 

The raven is the glue that holds these kingdoms together in times of peace. So forget dragons. If it wasn't for the ravens, Aegon the Conqueror would have never been able to keep control of the Seven Kingdoms. No matter how many times he reconquered them. ",13,23,False,spoiler,,,,,

I just finished with the first few episodes of Season 1, and I was thinking about the Valyrian steel dagger that was used in the assassination attempt against Bran.

So to recap... Littlefinger claims it used to belong to him, and that he lost it in a bet with Tyrion in a tournament a while prior. Baelish says that he bet on Jaime and Tyrion bet against him, winning the dagger when Loras unhorsed Jaime. Obviously this cannot be true because we know that Tyrion would never bet against Jaime.

But was that ever revealed in the show? As far as I can remember, I don't think the show ever tells us this is false. I didn't read the books but from reading around online, my understanding is that the dagger actually belonged to Robert Baratheon, and that Joffrey sent it with the assassin because he wanted Bran dead. I think - correct me if I'm wrong there please.

In Season 4 it comes out that Lysa Arryn poisoned Jon Arryn with Tears of Lys and wrote the letter to Catelyn telling her the Lannisters were involved... all at Littlefinger's instruction. So this must have happened soon before the show even begins on Season 1 Episode 1.

My question is this: How the fuck could Littlefinger have *possibly* been able to forecast that these things would bring him to a position of power? I know that ""chaos is a ladder"" and all that jazz, but Littlefinger couldn't possibly have known at that time that Bran would be pushed from the tower, or that someone would attempt to kill him, or really any of the other immediate incidents that weigh into Ned's decision to accept Robert's nomination as Hand of the King. Obv in the show it works out for him, but it seems like it could have so easily resulted in a lot of trouble caused for a lot of people that might not have brought him any gain whatsoever.",10,8,False,spoiler,,,,,

One thing that has always nagged at me is how, exactly, Jaqen H'Ghar came to be held in the Black Cells, and thus wound up with Yoren as a Night's Watch recruit. Given everything we know about the Faceless Men, and given that, on the show at least, Jaqen seems to be a high ""priest"" (or high-ranking member) of the House of Black and White...how did he wind up in the Black Cells?

Adding to that, Jaqen specifically calls to Arya to free him from the barred and locked cell cart, and then finds her at Harrenhal. When he explains the life debt he owes her, he specifically mentions the Red God (and his due)...we know that the HoBW has altars to all the gods of death, as they are all the faces of THE god of death (hence ""the many-faced god""). It's interesting to note, however, that Jaqen specifically mentions the Red God when he firsts interacts with Arya.

I'm wondering if Jaqen intentionally set himself on Arya's path due to some prophecy (possibly he originally worshiped the Red God before coming to the HoBW and becoming a Faceless Man)...she clearly has an important role to play, and he saves her life and then gives her the coin and the phrase (Valar Morghulis) necessary for her to travel to Braavos and pursue training at the HoBW.

When Mel (a priestess of the Red God) encounters Arya, she also mentions that she sees in Arya many sets of eyes - eyes belonging to the people she will kill.

What do you think? Is this all related to the fact that Arya has some prophetic part to play in the fate of Westeros? We know she will be a vital player in the endgame, however the references to the Red God (and Syrio's mention of the God of Death) seem to indicate a specific, possibly prophesied, role for her in the future.

Or, you know...do you think it was all coincidence? On my end, I cannot see how Jaqen could have been captured and held at the Black Cells in the Red Keep given his skills. If he wanted to escape, he would have.

I know this is somewhat different in the books - there is a FM at the Citadel, and the Kindly Man (and others) at the HoBW, so clearly there are multiple FM agents in play in the books. They do, however, have a clear agenda, even if we do not understand what it means quite yet.

This is my first time posting to this subreddit, go easy &lt;3

So I finally got around to reading ASOIAF. I made it my new years resolution to finish the series, now in April I have about two or three chapters left. That might give a hint as to how much I fucking adore this world. I had never watched the show before but had a fair few friends or whatever who had. I tried watching the show once, didn't like it at the time. Now that I know I love the story though, I really want to try again. So my plan is to watch the show before the next book is published. I know from friends however that due to the nature of the show and how fast it's made, there are parts in it that go past the books storyline (and parts that are behind). This is my problem, I don't want to go past the points I've read too much on the show. I don't want the tv show to spoil the books. I'd rather read the story first you feel me? 

So my question is this, is it a good idea to watch the show during the gap before the next book? Now you've answered yes, how far is it safe for me to watch before getting post book spoilers? Is this even a valid worry?
