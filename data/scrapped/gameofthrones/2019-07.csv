1,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2019-7-1,2019,7,1,9,c7ln1w,self.gameofthrones,[Spoilers] Why Littlefinger and Sansa are my Favorite GOT Characters,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/c7ln1w/spoilers_why_littlefinger_and_sansa_are_my/,Athletic_Frank,1561940135,"Whats so badass to me is that you dont need dragons, armies, assassin abilities, good fighting skills, etc to get very far or win the game of thrones. Dont get wrong all these things are cool to but what intrigues me the most is the power of the mind. My favorite Pokmon type has always been and always will be Psychic lol. I have always resonated with characters that are more brain than brawn (probably because Im a nerd ) and Sansa and LF definitely showcase this the best. Bran does too but Bran just has hacks and hes fairly boring. To me whats so awesome is that this entire Lannister Stark conflict, the main plot of the whole series, the whole war of the 5 kings, nearly everything was caused by 1 person. Only 1 mind. All LF was, was a damn lord of a extremely minor holding on the Fingers, and he causes the whole damn thing and in the end he nearly had half of Westeros (as far as land goes) under control. And whats so cool was that the only reason he really loses was to himself. He lost to his student so to speak.

Whats so epic is that dragons, armies, etc dont matter when you play the game of thrones. The only real power is knowledge. As LF says, knowledge is power. True power, real power comes from the mind. LF was  legit playing everyone and was playing the game of thrones the best until his student betters him. He was the player and everyone else was the pawns until Sansa. Now Sansa is the player of the game. To me my favorite part of Game of Thrones is the Game of Thrones. Is it just purely by coincidence that Sansa got exactly what she wanted (The Norths Independence) since the beginning of Season 8 by the end and is arguably the biggest winner of the game? Sansa knew how to play the game from her teachers  and she played it well. You win the Game of Thrones by playing the Game of Thrones and Sansa is the most experienced player in the end. What I really love about Sansa is she is like the Good LF so to speak and whats really awesome is that she showcases all of her teachers (LF, Cersei, Margaery, Olenna as well as herself) when she plays the game. I also think Sansas arc is awesome, going from a bratty naive girl to a smart, hardened and learned individual. She goes from not appreciating her family and her home to loving her home and her family more than ever, willing to do anything to protect her home and her family. 

I also love Littlefingers accent. Just like Sansas beauty is like the cherry on the sundae , Littlefingers accent is like the cherry on the sundae. He also has some amazing quotes. The Chaos is a Ladder speech scene is one of my favorite scenes of the entire series. I also really love the Conspiracy Theme that plays several times when he is on screen. Although its not technically his theme because it is played in other parts of the show that doesnt include him, some people call it his theme (myself included) because it is most associated with him and because for the most part it plays when it involves him. It has a very ominous tone and I love it. Also Fun fact about Littlefinger was that he made his personal sigil a mockingbird. Its cool because he knew the right things to say to the right ears at the right time which is analogous to how a mockingbird mimics and imitates other birds songs.",41,12,False,spoiler,,,,,

I am sure many of you have noticed that it is the ruined King's Landing, but I have seen many people wondering why it seemed King's Landing did not end up a snow-covered ruin that they appeared to be showing.

Now I have, since seeing the finale, come up with two hypotheses:

1.) ***Ashy Throne Room***

This is just as it sounds: the thing we thought was snow was all along ash. This seems likely, I mean it looked more like ash than snow but that could just be because of lighting or set issues in the shot. This would mean that it was *literally* showing Dany what was going to happen at the end of her life. Dany saw the wreckage of King's Landing after her arrival. She was shown what her last act ever would be: the destruction of King's Landing.

2.) ***Winter Triumphs***

* *The Outcome.* Now this one is less direct. It revolves around how in the end, the Stark's gained all the power (only for now in The Kingdoms, but yes, but they did). A Stark rules at The Wall, a Stark rules The North, and a Stark rules The Six Kingdoms. King's Landing, a husk of its past self, ruled by winter. Dany's destructive power demonstration set the stage for her downfall and the Stark rise.
* *The Death.* Now there is one thing I think holds true of this vision no matter what way you look at it; it is a death vision. Daenerys is witnessing where her life will end and where she will next meet her lover and her child. She was unable to sit in the throne just as she was unable to ever take her seat there in the very end. This being known, the snow could be simply be representative of the fact that Jon Snow was the man who rang in her death. He brought the end before she could ever reach her final goal.

This is all opinion and stuff I have come up with on my own. I had no intention of basing this off anything else out there, and it is simply meant as some food for thought.

Most changes are to episode 3 with one small change to episode 2. Not all of these ideas are mine, some are inspired by other theories and rewrites that I have read. I did this for fun, I am not trying to do a better job than D&amp;D. So here goes:

Episode 2 stays mostly the same. The only difference is that at the end Sam tells Jon something he discovered about the Night King. The audience doesn't hear what it is. The only thing we do hear is Sam saying 'Don't tell Bran'

Episode 3 remains the same untill the last half hour. The only characters who's stories are different are Jon, Bran, Arya, Theon and Beric. The dragon battle between Jon, Dany and the Night King remains the same. Arya being chased through the castle remains mostly the same, except it is only the Hound that saves her, without Beric. They don't run into Melissandre and instead go to save the helpless people in the crypts. At one point, Sansa kills a Wight with her dagger, Arya sees this and has a proud sister moment.

During the battle, Bran looks into the past to figure out how to beat the Night King. He sees a Stark ancestor standing up to the dead with a dragon glass sword (Implied to be Azor Ahai). He also goes back to the time of the Mad King and tries to convince him to prepare for the threat of the White Walkers. This goes horribly wrong, the Mad King begins to repeat 'Burn them all' and becomes obsessed with burning people. Bran returns to the present, exhausted.

Jorahs and Lyannas deaths remain the same. The living are being overwhelmed by the sheer number of Wights. Jon is fighting his way through the battle. His choice to not save Sam is more emphasised, to show Jons story of choosing duty over love. Jon ducks behind a rock to avoid the blue flames of Viserion. He is joined by Beric, who tells him to get to the godswood. Before Jon can say a word, Beric runs at Viserion giving Jon time to get past. Beric dies.

Brans bodyguards are getting overwhelmed by the wights. Bran, now desperate, wargs back to when the Night King was created. Theons sacrifice plays out the same. Theon goes down, his eyes wide, grabbing at the dragon glass spear in his stomach.

In the past vision, Bran is standing in a field when he is grabbed by the Children of the Forest and tied to a weirwood tree. A dragon glass dagger is stabbed into his heart and his eyes turn blue. Bran didn't listen to the previous Three Eyed Ravens warning of getting too enamoured with the past and paid the price. Bran opens his eyes to see the Night King standing over him. There is nothing of Bran left in the Night King, not really. The Night King is only here to ensure his creation because he has learned his lesson; to never tamper with the past. A voice calls out Brans name.

Jon runs through the godswood, strangely The White Walkers allow him to pass. Jon repeats 'Bran!' looking at the Night King. Jon knows of Brans fate. Jon pleads with the monster that used to be his brother to stop. The Night King ignores Jon, not even turning around. Jon means nothing to him. The Night King draws his blade and raises it, to stop Bran from going back into the past again to change his fate.

Jon lunges at the Night King. The Night King lazily parries the blow and knocks Jon to the ground with ease. Jon gets back up and attacks the Night King again, desperate to keep him away from Bran. Despite being outmatched, Jon keeps fighting, even managing to disarm the Night King. However, the Night King is too much for Jon in the end, grabbing Jon by the throat and lifting him into the air.

Theon thrusts what's left of his dragon glass spear into the Night Kings back, piecing his heart. The White Walkers burst into shards of ice, the Wights crumble. The Night King lets go of Jon and falls against the weirwood tree. The blue glow leaves the Night Kings eyes. The Night King looks up at Jon and Theon without speaking a word, his real eyes, Brans eyes say a silent thank you. The Night King bursts into shards of ice.

Theon collapses, Jon catches him. Bran forgives Theon, telling him that he is a good man. Theon dies in Jons arms, redeemed not just as a Greyjoy but as a Stark.

Melissandre walks up to Jon, telling him that while the Great Other has been defeated, the long night is not yet over. She turns and walks away. Jon asks her where she is going, she tells him that she has played her part, but he has yet to play his. Melissandre takes off her neckless. Time catches up to her as she walks into the sunset one last time.

First Quote about Light Bringer To fight the darkness, Azor Ahai needed to forge a hero's sword. He labored for thirty days and thirty nights until it was done. However, when he went to temper it in water, the sword broke. He was not one to give up easily, so he started over.

Arya stab Night King with the valerian dagger. He represents Ice/Water.

The second quote The second time he took fifty days and fifty nights to make the sword, even better than the first. To temper it this time, he captured a lion and drove the sword into its heart, but once more the steel shattered.

Danerys and her dragon killed Cersei who represents house Lannister or a lion.

The third quote The third time, with a heavy heart, for he knew beforehand what he must do to finish the blade, he worked for a hundred days and nights until it was finished. This time, he called for his wife, Nissa Nissa, and asked her to bare her breast. He drove his sword into her living heart, her soul combining with the steel of the sword, creating Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes.

Jon stab Danerys (his wife) in the heart.

So it seems Azor Ahai is a group of heroes. Also, the long night means the long war of Westeros.

Correct me if I have inaccurate basis for these please.

We all watched Jon and Danerys fall in love. We all saw what seemed to be the unraveling of Ds sanity. We all saw Jon Snow stab her. We all know Jon Snow and his vows he holds with honor. 

In the beginning of the season we saw Jon and Dany by the waterfall. Dany said they could stay 1000 years and nobody would know. She also mentioned how her dragons hated the cold and lack of food. 

Jon is loyal to two things his family and his queen. Danerys is loyal to her goal breaking the wheel. Assuming Jon never stabbed Dany he would have let his family down and in essence betrayed them had he married Dany. Had Dany married Jon took the throne she would have been strengthening the wheel not breaking it. 

How do these two characters madly in love both meet there goals and stay true to there moral compass. Easily pull off the power move of the century. 

Lets rewind in order to exist for 1000 years in hot universe one has to die first and come back to life. Jon died and his body was protected until he was brought back to life. In theory wouldnt Danerys have to suffer the same fate in order to stay with Jon 1000 years.

Danerys trust one person besides herself she trusts Jon Snow. Danerys isnt dumb or silly or foolish. She is a calculated Khalessi. The knight king wanted to kill Bran to kill the memories of man. What if Khaleesi killed Kings Landing and the Red Keep and the iron throne to do the same. 

Danerys was isolated when she died. Jon told her he would always be his queen as she preached about them breaking the wheel. Greyworm and the Dothraki would have insisted on post death customs. Jon sat with his love and protected her while Drogon destroyed the highest ideaology of the wheel the Iron Throne then gently carried her to exactly where she wanted to be with her wheel broken and with Jon Snow in Valyria for 1000 years and no one will find them .

Wheel broken only person who would want to seek Jon or Danerys out on his way to certain death on Naah.",5,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

He wasnt even ultilised as a plot device or anything, he was just cut off from the story unceremonially.

He had to die somehow before the real war (on episode 5).
To me it was surprising because I expected like always that Jon will come out from nowhere and save the day like he always do. I was so happy when he didn't.
Arya deserved it, and the whole episode being dark was on purpose, to desperate the watchers and show them how the soldiers felt during the long night against the white walkers. Also the track ""The Night King"" by Ramin was freaking amazing and the visuals were outstanding.
You can tell that the writing was trash and the battle decisions they made were dumb, like sending the whole Dothraki first to the giant army of the dead so they'll join them, but what else could they do? The army of the dead are like a gang of bees, going together to the same target like a tsunami, nothing could've stopped them.

And for episode 5 of Daenerys going mad, it really made sense to me. She lost EVERYTHING.
Jon couldn't keep 1 secret that Ned kept for a decade+
Sansa and Arya hated her.
The whole north hates her.
She lost 1/2 of her army in the long night.
She lost jorah.
She lost Missanderi (whatever you spell her name)
She lost 2 dragons.
Jon said he can't be with her as a husband.
Westros wanted Jon as king.

She had all the reasons to go mad, after she easily managed to destroy the whole army of Lannister and Greyjoy with a single dragon.

Really pissed me off that she got killed on episode 6.

Anyway, Episode 3 is better than S6E9 and Episode 5 is better than S6E10.

I have the same complaints that most people do about Season 8 in that it was *incredibly* rushed and the writers seemed to miss several beats necessary to make characters' actions believable (though I'd been complaining about that since Season 7, to be truthful).

But what I'm really wrestling with is the note the series ended on.

Daenerys's sinister turn took the show in a pretty dark direction. To be honest, I wasn't surprised that neither Jon nor Dany ended up on the throne given *Game of Thrones's* history of giving us something your usual fantasy wouldn't. *But* I was very surprised at how we arrived at our ending (I thought they'd abdicate).

My issue is that Dany's turn is dark. Jon's assassination of her is dark. But then, suddenly... it's pretty happy, considering? Bran is king. Tyrion becomes Hand. Sansa is Queen in the North. Jon doesn't get pegged with a job he never wanted and goes to the place his heart has always called him (if Ghost, his familiar, being sent up there early wasn't an obvious hint, I don't know what is).

Was anyone else thrown off by this? Especially since Tyrion was acting like it was a sour outcome (they seemed to appoint Tyrion meta-commentator since all his speeches seemed constructed purely to fill in the gaps in the writing).

But let's rewind for a minute.

Bran is king. Bran, the guy possessed by an omniscient spirit of a race once violently opposed to humans, the very race that created the White Walkers to wipe out humanity. Bran, the guy who only revealed that he could see the future all along *after* he'd been nominated as king. Bran, the one who encouraged Sam to plant the seed that caused the discord between Jon and Dany that presumably fueled her descent. Bran, who flash fried Hodor's mind. Bran, the Three-Eyed Crow (""All crows are liars,"" says Old Nan). 

But no one says anything about it! Not one person says, ""We need to talk about Bran.""

Wouldn't *acknowledging* the inherent shadiness of Bran-as-child-god-king be--tonally, at least--more in step with the tragedy of the Targaryens? Wouldn't making us feel uneasy about his rule from a place of ""this is dark"" be better than making us feel uneasy because ""we're leaving you with a ton of unanswered questions about Bran but tell you you're supposed to feel happy about this"" feels hollow and instructive? 

Don't get me wrong--there were aspects of the season I could appreciate in spite of my criticisms, and I don't dislike Bran. If anything, I like him and am upset at how underutilized he was. But the tonal shift of the last episode midway through was so dramatic for me I can't help but wonder if it would've been better if Bran had been depicted in a darker light, and whether George had those plans for him (if he ever finished writing the books). I remember his original outline saying that Bran and Jon became bitter rivals and Bran begins to use magic for magic's sake, which makes me think George had planned him to become corrupted by his powers.

I guess I thought I'd just see if anyone was as thrown off by the shift of the finale as much as I was, and whether you think going even darker could've been a solution.",13,8,False,spoiler,,,,,

S5E2 Ser Barristan, ""But the Mad King gave his enemies the justice he thought they deserved, and each time it made him feel powerful and right until the very end.""

&amp;#x200B;

The people who keep saying Dany would never have slaughtered Kings Landing need to re-watch the show. The signs are  there the whole time..there just disguised as her being the hero. The quote above says it all. Every time she gives someone the justice she thinks they deserve, she feels more powerful and right. She has gone through so much during her journey, and it all goes to hell at the very end. She loses her most trusted advisers, Jorah and Missandei. One to the the ultimate evil against men, the other by a brutal beheading from her enemies. Dany is betrayed by her other adviser in Varys, because the man she is in love with and who can no longer love her back is ultimately the true heir.. a total screw you to her entire life meaning. And finally, Westeros does not share any of the love she thought she would receive. Alll she really does have is fear to rule with, and a goal to break the wheel. While the goal may be commendable, she thinks that what she's doing to break it is right, because her past has taught her so. 

&amp;#x200B;

I do think the show botched the visualization of how Dany slaughtered Kingslanding in S8E5. It was epic for sure but the show should have made it a point for the audience to see more of the Lannister army and Golden company littered throughout ALL of the city. Instead of it looking like shes just killing the innocent for the sake of revenge, it should have looked like they were casualties of war. Maybe they thought that would be understood but it's pretty clear that's not the case with the backlash.",19,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

This is a short comment on how the writers of Game of Thrones intened to continue the character arc of the Unsullied ... enjoy :) (warning again: I'm being very flat-jokey)

__________________________________________________________


So  by the end of Game of Thrones, Grey Worm and a number of other Unsullied set sail for the island of Naath to protect its people from further slavery, as he has promised to Missandei.
Unfortunately  this idea is rather naaith.
 
(You think this is a bad one? I just started XD)


Now, of course the Unsullied could succeed in sending one or two slaver ships back to their cities with  of the men on board slain but to send an army outnumbering them by 10 soliders each and take it back would probably take the slavers of Essos naa leth than a week. 
Not only that, but as revenge for being so naathty,, the slavers could simply take half of the islands population, or even murder them along with the army. 


Of course, its not like naathing  can be done to fullfill the promise  but it would take a while. In my mind, the best option for the Unsullied would be to return to Mereen/Dario and try to fulfill Daenerys vision of a more just Essos if enough Dothraki returned with them, they would have a start of an army, and could proceed with trying to win more people with influence for their cause  its a very difficult task in the free cities that will require a lot of luck, but its much more benaathicial to everyone (potentially) involved, and Grey Worm would help building a world Missandei would have liked.


Plus, whoever he meets as a new love interest  naathing compares to her.

Thanks for reading :)",2,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I remember the first time I saw this thinking that this guy was just an ass who hated Jon Snow.  Now I realize that he was actually a very honorable man and he made Jon Snow into the man he was in the end.  

He was a tough man, but he needed to be.  He had the job of taking criminal low lives and high borns and turning them into men of the knights watch.  The knights watch doesnt have many soldiers so the few that they have need to be good.  Hes basically the drill Sargent who gets in your face and calls you a walking pile of pig shit because he wants to make a man out of you.  The speech he gave at castle black before the wildlings attacked and the way he charged straight into battle with his men makes you realize that the nights watch truly meant everything to him.  Just as it did to Qhorin Halfhand, another great character. 

I remember watching Dolorous Edd getting stabbed in the back while picking up Sam Tarlys fat ass off the floor and thinking I guess Jon sticking up for Tarly in season one during his training might not have been the best thing to do after all.  

He even taught Jon Snow a lesson when he stabbed him.  Before being executed Thorne told Snow I had a choice Lord Commander, betray you or betray the nights watch he went on to say if I had to do it all over knowing where Id end up, I pray I would make the right choice again. A lesson that came in handy when Jon was put to the similar choice in the end.   Betray Daenerys or betray the people of Westeros, knowing that killing her would mean almost certain death by Drogon.

To start, we'll rewind to before the Battle of The Bastards. Sansa quite literally had no reason not to tell Jon about Littlefinger/Knights of the Vale, unless she was scheming behind Jons back because in her idiotic little brain, she should be Queen/Wardeness of the North. She knew for a fact they were greatly outnumbered by Ramsay, and had little support of the Northern lords (despite the North being famously loyal, especially to the Starks for thousands of years, and especially considering Starks didn't rule by fear alone, but that's a topic for another day). A few times she publicly undermined Jon, she insisted they needed to take Winterfell (not only because it's their ancestral home) because of Rickon, she even explicitly stated they needed to save him! Yet 5 minutes later she literally tells Jon they'll never get Rickon back, in her mind he's already dead. Her parents are dead, her eldest brother is dead, Arya (in her mind) is dead, so what's one more brother she hasn't seen in roughly 10 years? But again, she had ZERO reason, other than being a duplicitous-dumb-tw*t, not to tell Jon about LF and the Vale, and for some reason Jon doesn't even think to attempt to garnish their support after his aunt was Lady of the Vale for years and years, and they remained staunchly loyal to his aunt out of respect for Jon Arryn. Anyway, as the Battle of The Bastards is seemingly lost and basically 2/3 of the army fiercely loyal to the KING IN THE NORTH (remember how pissed she looked when they declared Jon the king?), the Vale comes in. At first, the closeup view of Sansa shows her smiling very happily. Then, as she notices Jon Snow is actually still alive, her face goes from arrogantly happy, to extremely disappointed, bordline pissed off. Why in Seven Hells would Sansa make that face upon realizing her (as of now) half-brother whom she grew up with, and took her in to protect her at the wall, survived the battle? Why would she look this way unless what I'm saying is true? Obviously the shittiest writers in existence right now didn't explore this and hardly implied it, but what else would she be thinking? Now I'm gonna go a tad bit off topic here with this, why would the Northern Houses/Lords want her as Queen to begin with? She has done NOTHING, and I truly mean NOTHING to earn this position other than luckily coming out of Ned Starks ballsack. I'm going to incorporate some book material with this as well.. First, she pretty much caused Ned Stark to get imprisoned which resulted in his death; when Ned reveals to Arya &amp; Sansa that they are going back to Winterfell because of how dangerous KL is, Sansa goes and actually complains/tells Cersei of Neds plan, prompting her to have him thrown in a cell (because he knows the incestuous truth). Then, she writes back to Robb telling him to pledge fealty and bend the knee, and becomes Joffreys torture toy for a few years. Then, she is forcefully married to Tyrion Lannister, only to end up WILLINGLY married off to Ramsay Bolton, bastard son of the traitor who had the King in the North murdered and butchered at his own wedding, along with her own mother, Eddard Starks wife. After all of that, she is saved by the eunuch Theon, after being raped and beaten for years by Ramsay, and goes to the wall, where she explicitly tells Jon, if he doesn't go and take back winterfell, she will. The wall would bloody melt before Sansa fooking Stark takes back Winterfell without Jon fooking Snow mind you. She is extremely arrogant, full of herself, delusional, and an all around B*TCH. She has done nothing to deserve her position, nothing whatsoever, and then to add insult to injury, basically gives the green-light for Jon to go live beyond the wall after EVERYTHING that man has done to take back the seat of House Stark, save the North &amp; Seven Kingdoms as a whole, and save the world from fire and blood. Then, she evidently becomes the ""Cat Lady of the North,"" she obviously doesn't plan to marry, and even if she does marry a Lord, she loses the Stark name (in this world you lose your name if you're a woman and marry a lord, the only way she can keep the Stark name is if she gets married to a commoner, which she obviously won't).. Bran ""The Broken"" (are you serious?) Obviously can't have children of his own, and Arya became Christopher fooking Columbus and has zero intention of marrying anybody, and AGAIN, even if she does she needs to marry a commoner to keep House Stark going. So now, House Stark is literally going to become extinct within 40-50 years. The fact people defend this dumpster fire of a season (honestly it went downhill after S5, but S7-8 truly show how horrific, cringey, and horribly written it became, and shows how god awful D&amp;D are) is mind boggling. If you defend this nonsense or justify what I've written (let alone everything i haven't talked about) you're more than likely another mindless, casual, show-watcher who turns their brain off to enjoy modern TV/Movies; no true fan of the books AND show is alright with any of this.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

'...for a comet had been seen above Kings Landing on the night Aegon was conceived, and Rhaegar was certain the bleeding star had to be a comet. What fools we were, who thought ourselves so wise! The error crept in from the translation. Dragons are neither male nor female, Daenerys is the one, born amidst salt and smoke. The dragons prove it. Just talking of her seemed to make him stronger. I must go to her. I must. Would that I was ten years younger."" The old man had been so determined that he had even walked up the plank onto the Cinnamon Wind on his own two legs, after Sam made arrangements for their passage.'

Love that bit of characterization for the old man. And then, to get to my actual curious points...

'...Aemon no longer spoke of [this]. Instead his talk turned back to Oldtown, and the archmaesters of the Citadel. You must tell them, Sam, he said. The archmaesters. You must make them understand. The men who were at the Citadel when I was have been dead for fifty years. These others never knew me. My letters  in Oldtown, they must have read like the ravings of an old man whose wits had fled. You must convince them, where I could not. Tell them, Sam  tell them how it is upon the Wall  the wights and the white walkers, the creeping cold  I will, Sam promised. I will add my voice to yours, maester. We will both tell them, the two of us together. No, the old man said. It must be you. Tell them. The prophecy  my brothers dream  Lady Melisandre has misread the signs. Stannis  Stannis has some of the dragon blood in him, yes. His brothers did as well. Rhaelle,

1. I like how Aemon just pretty much confirms everything Melisandre is doing. Him saying lady Melisandre misread the signs lends credence to her, her mission, and to the existence of the fiery God (The same Red God that brought Berric Dondarrion back like 7 times).

And 2. He says Stannis has some dragon blood and so do his brothers, meaning, for one, Robert, who actually DID run the Iron Throne after the last Targaryen. This means that ONLY a Targaryen has ever actually run it, or at least someone who has dragon blood at least.

Except idk. Joffrey and Tommen control it for a little, both rather short termed and each successfully dying while trying to hold the ill fated Iron Throne. Do Lannisters have dragon in them?",1,1,False,self,,,,,
351,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2019-7-4,2019,7,4,13,c8xzd4,self.gameofthrones,[Spoilers] Serious amount of spoilers. My take on the GoT and the Last Season,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/c8xzd4/spoilers_serious_amount_of_spoilers_my_take_on/,SavingSElite,1562213420,"  

Spending almost all my time since 2011 practically worshiping this series, and I will most likely continue until the end of my days, I find myself thinking a lot about what has happened from ""Winter is Coming"" to ""The Iron Throne"". And I fit somewhere in between not liking the ending character arcs to thinking it's satisfactory. Here is my main character breakdown of what was right and/or what was wrong:

&amp;#x200B;

Jon - Has always been my favorite (Go House Stark!!... Or Targaryen?) and he has been the most noble of them all regardless of all the trials put before him. There is just something not full about his character. I feel like if he were to kill Dany then he should have killed himself, or even said ""dracarys"" for treason and breaking an oath. But it contradicts all other oaths that he has made like protecting the realm. Regardless, I feel like he should have killed himself. (I know, I'm just trying not to be bias)

&amp;#x200B;

Dany - My second love of my life. Well, she did what she has always wanted to do and just completely destroy the crap out of King's Landing. But doing this has made it to where her army was doing things she was completely against, like raping the villagers. Then she became a Tyrant even before the Kings landing battle but saying shes going to kill all tyrants? Unsullied probably should have killed her at that point for being another tyrant and that may have been justifiable.

&amp;#x200B;

Sansa  Dont really have many words about Sansa. She is like Dany in a lot of sense, but Sansa is Dany late in the series while Dany matured early. But I feel like Sansa is more careful than Dany and she tries to play by ear to feel the crowd. I feel that Sansa should be alive, but I feel like more things should have challenged her. Dany trying to kill her for example, or in prison for treason temporarily.

&amp;#x200B;

Arya  Should she have killed the Night King? We want that battle between Night King and Jon, and I feel that battle should have happened, but ultimately, I feel Arya should have killed him. She is the hidden weapon that the Starks needed for survival. Teamwork for the win! She is cocky and I dont like that and I feel like she should have acted more like Brienne of Tarth when it came to her sexuality. She isnt a lady after all and that was supposed to be an important thing to her, but if she did do it then she should have stayed with Gendry. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ned Stark  Im disappointed that he did not rise in the crypt

&amp;#x200B;

Bran  I dont think he should have been King, maybe an advisor or such cause of his ability but it just makes him completely OP. It wouldnt matter who sits on the throne because if they have Bran then they just win cause of his sight, but if he were to stay in the North, it would keep everyone from invading cause he would know. The North would have been safe for at least 60 years, though I can say itll be safe while even though he is on the Throne.

&amp;#x200B;

Clegane  I would have liked to see that his fight with his brother was not the end to his story. They could have added more by setting sail with Arya as a shipmate or whatever. Or brought him back to his house he was building to finish it, and start farming. Farmer Clegane, sounds right.

&amp;#x200B;

Varys  I understand killing him but it should have been done differently. I would have liked to see how a dragon eats rather than burn things. And I feel like Varys and Littlefinger should have changed places, though not die in season 7 and kept working in the favor of the Starks. 

&amp;#x200B;

Greyjoys  Both of them were poorly thought out. Though Im happy for Theon, Yara was the weak link. Where was she in Kings Landings fight? Still holding a retreat for an army thats not coming anymore? 

&amp;#x200B;

Cersei  Season 1-7 she was the most evil person in Westeros, why was her character lacking so much? She didnt even do anything besides order someone else to cut someones head off and lied about the baby daddy. Was there even a baby? That would have been an interesting twist. And whats the timeframe between all of these events from season 7 to season 8? A little math suggests that a few months should have past and it looked like she wasnt showing at all from when it was mentioned she was pregnant in season 7.

&amp;#x200B;

Jaime  Not much to change or talk about, its Jaime. And I dont think his character was hurt any in season 8.

&amp;#x200B;

Tyrion  Tyrion was such a careful person in all the other seasons and he just gave up. He didnt try to influence very much he just did as he was told and watched the aftermath. I think he should have had a larger role. He defended Kings Landing during the Blackwater he should have worked on both defending and invasion. What they did right was him talking to Jon to convince him to kill Dany, what they did wrong was how closed of a person he was. I can see why they turned that way, Season 7 kind of suggested that that was the way he was going but he should have developed different.

&amp;#x200B;

Robin  My, you have grown up so much. But youre still disgusting despite all the character adjustments. Blaming your mom.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what was missing? It was the Games that was missing. The head games, the trying to use their minds to defeat each other. The only persons that seemed to have it together was Varys and Sansa, and all the others are masters at it. Cersei should have played it out saying that as long as she kept her titles (minus being Queen) there didnt need to be a war and the Throne could have been Danys , new generations do not need to be punished for past crimes, Dany would be advised to accept. While at a gathering in a neutral territory, to celebrate on the same day, Varys should have taken the idea from the Frays and created a new Red Wedding while working with Cersei. Tyrion should have known something like this would happen and meanwhile try to play his own game to counter but fails, secretly happy about it. This would have upsetted everyone in the North and the Unsullied and Jon should have then became commander of the army rather than King. Drogon, being a smart dragon, should still show grief but I think in a more destructive way like burning Kings Landing and Jon, being Targaryen, could have retamed or settled the grieving Drogon. Then the secret of him being the true heir and being a Targaryen could have came out. Though still not accepting his throne, he nominates a King, kinda leaning towards Gendry (dont hate me). That would be a better game. This is my opinion and I hope you guys liked this last paragraph too.",11,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

The poor original writer of this show RR Martin was fed up with his life as apparent from his so many poor attempts at writing novels that in the end he thought, good people are not strong, that he wrote this TV show just to prove a point that in some fictional world, the characters who are true, have honor, have a will to do good have to die. Well, if you'd be living in that kind of world you'd be beheaded by Cercei already then.

The reason this TV show got so much attention is because it always portrays evil characters as winners. This tactic produces a kind of anger amongst the viewers and they want to watch next episode just in a hope maybe that evil character will be brought to justice.

Later after making his way to castle black, samwell tells everyone about this and Maester Aemon, Melisandre and others conclude that obsidian is only effective against Others whereas normal steel and fire are sufficient for wights. So in the shows the character conquest for mining dragonglass is utterly pointless as during the battle of Winterfell, not one character fights with a white walker.

See Below,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/c9kzcw/no_spoilers_anyone_else_looking_for_an/,iTsYoBoiGlory,1562359490,"So as the title imply's, I recently finished GoT although the ending left somewhat bitter taste in my mouth, I have been devastated that the series has ended. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really like GoT and the first 6 season were marvelous! but everything must someday end and sadly GoT has ended as a result. Since I finished GoT I have been looking for some good shows and here are some of the alternatives! Now most of these suggestions are anime but trust me they are well worth your time!

&amp;#x200B;

So here we go;

1. **Viking** (TV Series: Both have very likeable characters, lots of action, some nudity and betrayal. These are more or less the only similarities. Its historically based and I love the era, even if it isnt at all accurate. The battle scenes usually have more to them, theyre not just slashy slashy ALL the time and Ragnar is such a loveable character, more so than any of the GoT cast even Eddard and Tyrion.)
2. **Kingdom** (Anime: Very similar to GoT, in the kingdom of Qin, a prince  destined to become a king arises, who is hell bent on conquering the seven warring states of china. It is set in ancient China before unification. Kingdom has a fair amount of politics, but it is more focused in battle strategy and war.)
3. **Grancrest Senki** (Anime: Do you like stories of noble, romantic conquest? Epic-style armies resting their lives down because of good guy heroes proclaiming his will for the people? Some light political intrigue as a buffer for the plight that is to come? All of these titles should be serviceable in the above mentioned.)
4. **Arslan Senki** ( Anime: Both involving wars lords and action also with comedy in it. Seems to be a very similar premise, where a charismatic, but weak individual gathers up others, stronger or more knowledgeable people to help accomplish their vision and goals that may go against the grain of the current prevailing forces.)
5. **Drifters** (Anime: Both have war and battles. Although GoT is Fictional but Drifters have historical figures uniting against a common enemy. If you like these things, go watch.)
6.  **Overlord** (Anime: Very much like GoT, In both anime protagonists try to build up a new Kingdom in hopes of conquering existing kingdoms. Both have magic, war and resurrection in common.)

&amp;#x200B;

Thats kinda it for what I think would suit your taste if you like GoT. I would love to hear your suggestions on shows that you guys think are similar to GoT. Thanks for reading!",29,2,False,self,,,,,

He is not only a treasonous character from Season 7 finale onwards but also incredibly stupid. His ""soft corner"" for Cersie is complete madness. In season 7 finale he apologizes for what happened to her daughter and he also then says that he intends to save his house rather than destroying it. He kind of forgot that this woman legit tried to have him killed twice and he was privy to that. Having a more fresh perspective of his time in KL and all the things Cersie did to him, I simply could not stand that scene between him and her in Season 7 finale.

From Cersie's perspective nothing wrong though since she was playing the game and killing him could get really ugly in that moment.

Then in Season 8 he says ""you are not a monster"" like for real bro? She was a monster while being a mother to 3 children why would she suddenly change with a pregnancy? 

He was treated like shit in King's Landing and his achievements were constantly downplayed. He was insulted, berated and humiliated for being a dwarf all the time by his own family.

Danny was the only person of power who gave him oppurtunity and allowed him to prosper free of prejudice. She gave him respect and recognition, something he desired all his life. Yet he choose to betray her long before she became an evil person. No one should have been happier to see Cersie die than him and he even said that multiple times but yet all his actions clearly show a soft corner for her which is just madness.

Then in the penultimate episode having failed to negotiate with Cersie on 2 occasions, he thinks she would really abandon KL without a fight and no one will have to die. And somehow it's totally cool for her to go scot free for all her crimes because Jamie loves her.

In the end he is simply a treasonous and incredibly stupid character, a downfall from what was one of the greatest characters in all of fiction. Him ""winning"" in the end doesn't really matter since nothing that happened in the finale made much sense anyways, it all just seemed to happen for the sake of it.",203,1542,False,spoiler,,,,,

Sam appeared to be Lord of Horn Hill during the council, which makes sense, his family were dead, the NW was over at the time, and he shouldn't have been at the council otherwise. Then he went on to become Grand Maester, which means he must have given up his lands and titles. Making baby Sam the Lord now. If, as Gilly suspected, she is carrying a boy, I think this might lead to some future in-fighting. Imagine a young Jon Tarly discovering that his Lord and older brother is actually the inbred son of Craster. I picture a massive battle brewing there.

I didn't have access to HBO until recently when Spectrum gave some of their customers 3 months free. During those three months I had many a late nights watching Game of Thrones. Those three months have since expired and I am left stuck on Season 6 Episode 8 without any access to watching it. Could anyone spare me their HBO account so I can finish the show or have an place I can watch for free?

The Stark children (including Jon)

Two died by getting betrayed for trusting people who swore loyalty to them and got murdered by a Bolton:

-Rickon trusted the Umbers, killed by Ramsey
-Robb trusted the Freys, killed by Roose

Two got mentally and emotionally broken, travelled far, overcame their weaknesses and became rulers:

-Sansa broken by Joffrey and Ramsey, Queen in the North
-Bran by Jamie and by becoming the TER, King of the 6 Kingdoms

Two killed the two biggest threats to Westeros and ultimately left Westeros:

-Arya killed the NK, is going west of Westeros
-Jon killed Dany and is going north of the North



Also with Bran not being able to father children, and since Sansa and Aryas children wouldnt bear the Stark name, in a way, Jon is now the last Stark and the last Targaryen.",16,10,False,self,,,,,

Before anything else, I want to say that this is not a promotion to myself, this is me asking help from the community to brainstorm ideas to a fanfic I didn't write yet, for I don't believe I can do this alone. If this breaks the rules in anyway, I apologise and agree with the imediet removal of the post. Another thing, if you disagreed with this post, I apologise and asure this is not an attack against you and your likes, this is a fan that is disapointed with a series he loved and, seen that this feeling is shared, wish to do something for the fans. And finally, I apologise for any mistakes, I am brazillian and my writing english is not the best.

&gt;!I, just like many others, am disapointed with the seasons 7 and 8 of Game of Thrones, and, even knowing it was a token efford, I signed the ""rewrite Game of Thrones"" campaign, but I decided that wasn't enough for me! Many people said ""I can do better!"", and I intend to do it! I here ask the fans the things in season 7 and 8 that pissed you off the most, so I can better understand the general public's view on this mess, and maybe, do it better! I have my problems with this show, and I have seening many youtube videos that show other problems I didn't notice at first, and I wish to know your problems aswell. And I know, if I am doing this, I should be doing season 5 and 6 aswell, but, in my opinion, there are so far behind that it doesn't matter anymore, and I don't see myself capable to do so much. I have just one rule to this: ALL THE MAIN CHARACTERS THAT DIED IN THE ORIGINAL DIE IN MY VERSION, ALL THE CHARACTERS THAT LIVED IN ORIGINAL LIVE IN MY VERSION, but side characters Like Davos, Brienne and Bronn, is a free for all. With that all being said, I thank all who read and posted replies on this already.!&lt;",2,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

&gt;Sometimes, if a powerful lord asks them to kill the child of one of his enemies, the Faceless Men give as their ""price"" that in return they will kill the lord's own child (the lord can reject this, but it also means rejecting the entire contract). 

The Waif was from a noble house and her father did order an assassination. It could explain why she is still allowed to train as a FM even though she was consumed by her desire to kill Arya, since her desire to kill was part of her disguise. Killing the FM disguised as the Waif could have been Arya's final test, since they cannot choose who they kill, yet Jaqen congratulates Arya after she kills the Waif.

Im going to review every season of Game of Thrones now that its all over. I want to start by saying that GoT is one of the best shows of all time in my opinion and there will never be another show like it and it all started here with season 1. Its amazing how small and focused this first season is compared to later seasons and yet its still probably one of the most ambitious and expensive first seasons of a show ever done. George R.R. Martin created a universe rich with history and lore and most importantly, fascinating characters. David Benioff and D.B. Weiss do a great job bringing his first novel to the screen. Some of my favorite scenes arent from the book and they do a great job building upon the story. The writing, acting, music, and directing are all great this season. This could be the most consistent season of the show for me, I dont have any big criticisms of this season. I found the first 5 episodes to be a lot of set up and explaining by the characters and it hurts their rewatch ability but it was necessary at the time. With this being the first season, there are moments that feel amateurish like bad ADR, continuity errors and some scenes that feel flat and I cant really figure out why. I think they were still figuring out their groove. Which I think they reached in episode 6 and beyond. This is a great season of television, but I think if wasnt for its amazing world building and Ned Starks death it would be considered just a solid season of TV. But because of those things it became the phenomenon it is now. Baelor is still one of the best episodes of GoT and it contains one of the most iconic moments in cinematic history with Neds execution. Daenerys has become the most interesting character to watch now knowing what her endgame is. Its so tragic. All of the characters are amazing and its so crazy knowing how different they become in their stories. Season 1 was a great introduction to the vast world of Westeros and the people living in it.

It's in S2E8 ""The Prince of Winterfell"" -- we see Tyrion, Varys, and Bronn discuss the defense of King's Landing against the upcoming siege of Stannis Baratheon.

When Varys walks in he addresses Tyrion as ""my Lord Hand"" and he addresses Bronn as ""Mata.""

I'm cracking my head trying to figure out why Varys addresses Bronn as ""Mata.""  I've Googled it looking for old medieval references to sellswords and what not, and I can't find this term anywhere.  I feel I'm generally pretty good with feudal titles and the like, and this has me stumped.

It was also in an early season and I don't remember Varys referring to Bronn as this in the books -- did I just miss something over multiple reads?  Can anyone help?

Thanks.

Nonsense.

Ambition is *not* a bad thing,people need to get this notion out of their heads.Every great thing in history was accomplished by ambitious men and women,this rings perhaps even more true in the history of ASOIAF.The most famous example of would be Aegons Conquest: Aegon the Conqueror brought fire and blood to Westeros, but afterward he gave them peace, prosperity, and justice. It was Aegons ambition to rule Westeros,he saw an opportunity to restore the glory of himself,his family and his house and he took it,but he also ushered in 300 years of (relative,in comparison to the shitstorm that came before) peace and prosperity to an entire continent.

Its honestly baffling to me that Jon is considered the ideal candidate for a King,Ill list some of the reasons Ive heard about why hed be a good King,well go through them one by one.

He doesnt want power,people who dont want power are the most deserving of power

Sentimental nonsense that doesnt have any grounding in reality.Yes,Jon doesnt have ambition but that also means that he has no vision for the Iron Throne,no conviction,no dream for Westeros and its people.A king with no ambition is nothing more than a figurehead,hed be played like a musical instrument in Kings Landing by the various Lords and Ladies of the court and his small council,I shudder at the thought of the next Littlefinger/ having the *King* eating out of his hands in such a way.Want a close approximation to what Jons rule would look like in Kings Landing?Look at Tommen.

Offended?Well,too bad because its the truth.

In terms of personality there are only a few subtle differences between them.

Tommen has a weaker personality than Jon and his situation at court would be slightly different than Jon.


How can you say Jon has weak personality?He killed the love of his life for the greater good.

He was manipulated into doing so by Tyrion,who knew which buttons to press on Jon to get him to do what he wanted:Killing Daenerys before Daenerys could kill him and Jon couldnt see that.Jon can be easily manipulated to do most things by mentioning a few words,the greater good ,innocents Sansa Arya bastard.Anyone with sufficient mastery of the common tongue and six braincells can convince Jon using these words to do almost anything.

Im just gonna say it how it is,some of yall may get mad or whatever but here it is:*Jon has always had the mentality of a servant,not of a King* 

He is a follower not a leader like some of the others Ive mentioned on this list.

He has sufficient ruling experience because he was Lord Commander of the Nights Watch and was King In The North.

Listen to yourself,did you just say that being Lord Commander of a ragtag group of rapists,criminals and disgraced lordlings and knights makes you qualified to be King of a continent who eventually *killed* you anyway because you have zero communication skills and did not communicate anything about the big existential threat on its way and have said nothing to your men other than vagaries and fuckery like the dead are coming.


Fuck off dude,he was King in the North he can rule Westeros just fine

Yes he was King In The North and how well did that go for him?Every time an order came out of his mouth his vassals were grumbling at his bad decisions.

-Not revoking the lands and titles of the Boltons and Karstarks and giving them to loyal Northern families who supported him and Sansa.Now dont get me wrong,I hate sansa as much as the next man,maybe even more but she was absolutely right in this regard:
So theres no reward for loyalty and no punishment for treason.

-The minute he left the castle for Dragonstone,the lords and ladies of the court were immediately having second thoughts about selecting him as King and jumping on Sansa,to the point were they were making extremely treasonous statements openly in court,thats how bad it was.

-He was King for a matter of months,The North is a sparsely populated realm with huge expanses of absolutely nothing between holdfasts,towns and castles,entirely different to ruling a continent.He also spent the entire time preparing for the white walkers,not actually doing any ruling and not dealing with the day to day and the court intrigue and everything else,he was purely a military leader during his time as King.Sansa dealt with all of the other issues,even down to managing Winterfell and managing the food.

-Ive already alluded to this somewhat but Jon is so much like Ned and would get absolutely,for lack of a better word, get screwed by the court intrigue in the capital,putty in the hands of whichever ambitious individual whispers in his ear in court.Being Ned in the capital doesnt work,being Ned gets you manipulated and killed(obviously he wouldnt be killed as the King unless he was assassinated but you see my point),its a completely different ball game in the south Jon,not to mention the six different culture groups and countries ruled by six lords that have a different religion to yours and six different ambitions.

Hell be fine,Jon unites people,people are naturally drawn to Jon

Well lets address this really quickly,who did Jon unite exactly?It becomes significantly more easy to unite people when there is a huge existential threat coming to kill everyone like ice demons and snow zombies,Mance Rayder united the giants and all the Wilding clans underneath his banner because all of them knew of the threat and needed to band to together and get south to survive,the White Walkers are gone now,what could Jon do to unite the Iron Islands,Westerlands,Stormlands,Dorne,The Reach with with the Vale,the North and the Riverlands??

Through fear?

I beg to differ,Jon has never inspired fear in anyone,ever.When he was Lord Commander his authority was being challenged all the time by cravens and old men,a known coward like Janos Slynt openly started insulting Jon is front of everyone,he died for it but Jon wouldnt have done that if it wasnt Stannis giving him advice.

When he was King,he allowed a  prepubescent little girl who rules over a small rock off the coast to dress him down and talk down and insult him in front of his entire court multiple times with no repercussion,I dont mean executing her but at least something like Im your King,stop talking to me like Im some shitty stable boy 

When have you *EVER* seen someone like Stannis get talked to in such a way?Stannis was a man of honour just like Jon and his men loved him,respected him and feared him and they knew him to be a true king and that any disrespect would entail immediate death.The same goes for Daenerys,when the Khals threatened to gang bang her,she killed them took their Khalasars and the Dothraki knelt before her as if she were a Goddess of some kind,call it cheating by magic or whatever but it did what it needed to do.She fulfilled their prophecy wherein she became the Khal of Khals and took the Dothraki to the ends of the earth,her enemies cowered before her and their wives and daughters wept.Even before that,the ancient and noble houses of the great cities of Slavers Bay knew that they could *never* and were sent scurrying into the sewers and alleyways with masks.

With respect?
Even the fact that he has the respect of the North is questionable because of the disrespect and shenanigans he got from the Northern Lords.I think the only people who truly respect him are the freefolk but it certainly doesnt help that the are hated by every other group of people in Westeros.I doubt the other realms even knew of his existence as anything other than Neds Bastard,nothing more than a scandal with black hair and legs.Even after his coronation,why would the other realms even care about him let alone respect him?Because he saved them from the dead?Cersei made sure to tell everyone that the army of the dead is a lie and they have good reason to believe her because the dead never made it past Winterfell.And lets be all the way real here,if we are talking about who saved the living from the dead,it was Daenerys who provided the army and the dragons so that the living didnt get overwhelmed by the hordes of the undead in exactly 13 seconds and it was Arya who killed the Night King.Im not saying Jon did nothing but I am saying that statements like that make it sound like Jon singlehandedly saves everyone with no help from anyone ever.

Because hes the rightful heir to Iron Throne
Why,because he happened to come out of Rhaegars ballsack and his parents got married in a ceremony which wasnt authorised by the crown or the faith.The show as always glossed over the final details of this marriage and didnt bother to mention that Aerys disinherited Rhaegar and his children and made Prince Viserys his heir,this means it can still be argued that our boy Jon is still a bastard,a bastard dragon instead of a bastard wolf but a bastard all the same.

Lets assume for a moment that Jons claim is ironclad like the show suggests that it is for a moment,Jon is Aegon Targaryen,rightful heir to the Iron Throne and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.Well,no,he actually isnt because the Targaryens technically lost the throne to the Baratheons by right of conquest,his claim doesnt even have a leg to stand on,not legally and not militarily.Jon and his several thousand northmen couldnt even take that shitty collection of rocks they call the Iron Islands if they screamed rightful king at the waves until the castle crumbled all on its own.Daenerys styled herself as the rightful queen but she knew she would have had to fight whoever was on the throne at the time because she knew they wouldnt bend the knee and step aside the moment she landed,thats why she spent time amassing an army capable of taking on whoever it was on the throne.

Jon doesnt have the conviction,the vision,the ambition,the strength of character or even the desire to be King.
 
Hes a solider at heart,a follower.

Literally Tommen,if Tommen was also an accomplished military commander.",0,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I was re-watching Hardhome the other day and stumbled across this beautiful exchange between Olly and Sam.    


Sam: ""Sometimes a man has to make hard choices, choices that might look wrong to others, but you know are right in the long run. ""

Olly: ""You believe that?""

Sam: ""With all my heart... Try not to worry, Olly. I've been worrying about Jon for years. He always comes back.""

&amp;#x200B;

There's something absolutely wonderful about this exchange!

As soon as Sam says that first line, Olly looks like something clicked in his head. He asks for confirmation and then it totally is solidified in his mind that he needs to stop Jon.

Sam's word choice of ""heart"" is a small detail, might even be a bit of a reach, but still a wonderful touch! 

And of course... finally planting the ""he always comes back"" ending to bring it all together. So great!

&amp;#x200B;

I was re-watching Hardhome the other day and stumbled across this beautiful exchange between Olly and Sam.

Sam: ""Sometimes a man has to make hard choices, choices that might look wrong to others, but you know are right in the long run. ""

Olly: ""You believe that?""

Sam: ""With all my heart... Try not to worry, Olly. I've been worrying about Jon for years. He always comes back.""

&amp;#x200B;

There's something absolutely wonderful about this exchange!

As soon as Sam says that first line, Olly looks like something clicked in his head. He asks for confirmation and then it totally is solidified in his mind that he needs to stop Jon.

Sam's word choice of ""heart"" is a small detail, might even be a bit of a reach, but still a wonderful touch!

And of course... finally planting the ""he always comes back"" ending to bring it all together. So great!

Theres going to still be a nights watch. So maybe there needs to be a craster.

So I owned two other copies of ASOS - The green kind you can get in a set and individually that has the golden spiked helmet on the cover. But I recently bought a new copy that has the Season 3 artwork on the cover instead. At the start of the book there are four maps only on my new copy the 4th map is different. Instead of it being a map of Valyria its the Free Cities. This has to be a mistake and a misprint, right?

The map of Valyria is clearly the intentional one meant to be shown since my two other books had it and it shows Slavers Bay which is relevant to the story unlike the free cities which no POV character goes to during ASOS at all. I think the map of the Free Cities is supposed to be in AFFC right?

Is this a common misprint?",1,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

Also one of my favorite episodes in the history of the show. Many complain that this episode was rushed. I personally disagree Dany going mad was earned through her development this season. She was not thinking logically, but emotionally. Her best friend Missandei had been brutally killed, and told Dany dracarys to burn them. Dany has Varys one of her closet advisors betray her. Also Jon Snow breaking a promise to her, his lineage now is a threat. The deaths in this episode were really well done. Varys died trying to do what was best for the realm. Jaime and Cersei dying in each others arms was beautiful. Cersei having no won by her side, then sees her lover who left her. But she decides to reconcile with him and try to escape. And Jaime returning to Cerseis side, was in his character. He also knew she was bad, but he still loved her. The cinematography in the episode is beautiful. Arya running through the streets was great. But my favorite part was the cleganebowl. I mean seeing them fight. This was so epic. When Gregor took of his helmet I got chills. But this episode does what many episodes this season didnt. It made me question is Dany a hero or villain. Yes she was always a big liberator. But when it came down to it she was a conqueror. It makes you think how the line between good and evil are not always clear. I hope in future years this episode gets more love. Yeah the finale was very disappointing and painfully average. But to me The Bells was one of the best episodes in the whole show.",22,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

What if they purposely kept amazing stories of GoT to themselves, so they can use it for future productions and keep milking the franchise?

First of all this is the first time i post in [r/freefolk](https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/). Second, since game of thrones season 8 disappointed us all i wanted to share my own fan fiction which I believe how the 6 episodes could have provided a more satisfying ending to the show and can answer most of our questions and as well as talking in account the lore and all the 7 seasons of character development. Third even though i am more than a month late i have not read any other fan fictions in reddit so any similarities with other fan fictions are just coincidences. I have read though many theories and i did take elements from many different theories.

Episodes 1 and 2:

These two episodes play out similar to how they did in the show but with some key differences:

1 Jaime does not ride north alone and instead brings with him Bronn as well as the bulk of the Lannister army loyal to him in castely rock. On his way north Jaime frees Edmure Tully from the dungeons of the twins and then march north together with the Tully bannermen.

2 Sam and Bran spend these two episodes unlocking the secrets of the white walkers trying to find the key to defeat them. Sam reads about the Azor Ahai prophecy aswell as nissa nissa and lightbringer from the books he stole from the citadel and tells Bran where to exactly look in time.

3 When the nights watch survivors arrive at Winterfell, they tell Sam about the spiral symbol they found in Last Harth, Bran explains to Sam that this symbol was used by the children of the forest when they created the night king. So Sam goes to check for the symbol in his books. He finds that the symbol is a metaphor for light bringer. He also Finds out thay light bringer was buried within the tombs of Bran the builder the first stark. Sam and Bran immediately head towards the crypts and towards Bran the builders tomb. They searched through his tomb for light bringer only at there to find in there shock rather than a legendary sword a simply dragon glass dagger.

Episode 3 The battle of Winterfell:

The battle began with melisandre appearing from the shadows and lighting up all the dothraki blades. However rather than suicide charge at the army of the dead they retreat towards the hills. Bran attempted to undercover the night king's location through ravens but his vision was blocked by a strong magic.

The battle plans made by Tyrion are as follows:

Two lanes of trenches are build to split the army of the dead into two. Then the trenches are burned through flaming arrows trapping a large portion of the army of the dead. Then the Dothraki charge towards then and destroy them.

Initially the battle went accordingly, the wights mindlessly attacked out of the bushes and were caught between the trenches. Then the archers on the walls of Winterfell fired flaming arrows down onto the trenches causing them to ignite and trapping the wights. Then the Dothraki charged down the hill and encircled the wights. However soon the white walkers revealed a much larger army coming out of the bushed and charged at the Dothraki overwhelming the trenches and surrounding the Dothraki. Jon and Danaerys who were reluctant to use their dragons fearing that the night kings might shoot them down as he did with Viserion attempted to cover the dothraki escape. Unfortunately they soon faced a rain of ice spears thrown by the white walkers from the bushes forcing them to escape back to Winterfell. However Jon noticed a weakness, he realised that the wights were being directly commanded by the white walkers rather than the night king. Now with Dothraki being completely annihilated and the army of the dead unopposed, they marched to winterfell and surrounded the castle in an attempt to simply starve them all out. With all hope seemed lost Jon made a desperate plan, he ordered all there best fighters to ride the two dragons and assassinate the white walkers, while the rest of the army attacks and distracts the wights. Jon Tormund Beric and Sandor rode Rheagal, while Danaerys Jorah Brienne and Arya rode Drogon. The two dragons flew past the dead army straight towards the wights while the gates of Winterfell opened. The white walkers began throwing their spears at the dragons and managed to shoot down Rheagal, however not before dropping Jon Tormund Beric and Sandor to safe distance near the white walkers. Drogon while just narrowly dodging an ice spear dropped Danaerys Jorah Brienne and Arya before escaping for his life and burning the wights heading towards them. A duel emerged between heroes of living vs the white walkers and one by one as the white walkers shattered more and more wights dropped dead untill finally the entire army of the dead collapsed as the last white walker was slain.

Jorah died protecting Danaerys. Beric died but not before slaying numerous white walkers fulfilling his purpose to the lord of light. Brienne died while saving Arya's life fulfilling he vow to Catlyne Stark. Lord Commander Edd and Lyanna Mormont aswell as half their forces dropping from 60,000 to 30,000 died in the battle while fighting wights in Winterfell.

The Great war was far from over as neither the night king nor Viserion where found. Bran flew his ravens across all of Westeros searching for the Night King only to confirm their greatest fear and finding him in kings landing.

Episode 4

The Night King burned down kings landing to ash and murdered most of the population including Euron and the golden company. The night used his original 100,000 strong army only as a bait to gain a much larger army of 1.5 million wights. Cersei Qyburn and Mountain did manage to survive by hiding in the underground of the red keep and sailing to Dragonstone. The celebrations in Winterfell were cut short after bran told them of the horrible news. Sam who still held the dragon stone dagger asked Melisandre of the azor ahai prophecy and light bringer. She explained that azor ahai was bron from ice and fire and is the hero who defeated the night king using light bringer. He forged light bringer by sacrificing his wife. She also stated that she believes that Jon Snow is the reincarnation of azor ahai as he is half Stark and half Targarian. Sam then showed the dragon glass dagger and explained to him that they found it in Bran the builder's tomb and he thinks that it is light bringer. Melisandre in disbelief denied claiming that this contradicts the prophecy so they came to bran for answers. Bran went back in time to find how light bringer was formed, what he found however was a man tied into a weir wood tree. He found himself in the isle of faces where the children of the forest created the night king. The rock formation beside the tree resembled the spiral symbol of the white walkers. He saw a sobbing woman carrying a dragon glass dagger and inserting it in the heart of stranded person. His eyes soon turned blue and his skin turned eyes. Bran left the vision as he finally found the key to defeat the night king. They must Head to the isle of faces in the gods' eye at the Riverlands and create a new night king. The prophecy is misunderstood therr where two night kings in history, Azor Ahai defeated the original night king by turning himself into one. Him being a product of ice and fire was the only person with the power to kill the night king. After that he decided to exile himself north of the wall and build the wall to protect living from him. Over the next thousand years the magic of the night king overtook azor ahai consciousness and that is when he decided to attack the living (at the start of the show). The key to defeat the night king is to turn Jon the product of ice and fire into a new night king in the isle of faces. Jon at first was hesitant to be turned into a night king but was reminded by Sam of his Nights watch vows and the fact that they stand no chance against the night kings new army now almost 100 times their size which is marching north as they speak and is growing bigger. Jon and the remaining army quickly head towards the Gods' eye. Sansa stayed in Winterfell as their must always be a stark in winterfell and had to burn the dead. In the isle of faces they found Howland Reed. Howland reed the only other witness of Jon's birth, has spent the past couple of years studying the isle of faces. He knew by a vision from blood raven that the time will come where a new night king had to be created so he perfected the night king creation ceremony. The process would take sometime so they had to prepare to face the night king. The army constructed trenches to block all entrances to the the gods eye and build some scorpions similar to Qyburns ones to shoot down undead Viserion. Arya and Theon remained in the isle to defend Jon. As the ceremony was getting and Jon was tied at the weir wood tree started darkness emerges upon them as the army of the dead approached.

Episode 5

The night king has now arrived at the gode's eye. He has marched north all the way from kings landing killing everything on his path growing the size of his army reaching 2 million wights. The night king tried to fly directly towards the isle of faces with Viserion and kill Jon however he was slowed down by the scorpions with Bronn giving him a direct hit. This allowed Drogon to ambush Viserion and slay him. The night king however fell of viserion and vanished amidst the darkness. Meanwhile despite their air advantage the battle on the ground was a disaster as the trenches where quickly overwhelmed by the seemingly endless hordes of undead and soon the entire army was surrounded and where fighting for their lives. The ceremony was almost complete all what was needed was for danaerys (Jon's lover) to insert the dragon glass dagger into Jon's heart. As she unmounted her dragon, the night king and his army has now reach the isle of faces. Drogon tried to burn burn him but he was unaffected by fire. Now the night standing unopposed head towards Jon. However suddenly a large pack of dire wolves lead by Ghost and Nymeria warged by Bran appeared out of the Forrest. The dire wolves attacked the wights while Theon and Howland Reed charged towards the Night King. There Blades had no impact on the night king and they were both instantly killed. The direwolves all died fighting the wights leading to the final extinction of the direwolves including Ghost and Nymeria who died protecting their stark owners. This however slowed down the night king enough for danaerys to stab the dragon glass dagger at jon's chest and pushed it towards his heart. Jon's eyes quickly turned blue and his skin turned ice. Night King Jon emerged out of the weir wood tree and challenged the night king into a duel for the fate of Westeros. Night king Jon emerged victorious and the night king was finally slain ending winter. All the wights were now under Jon's command ceading their attacks and were then ordered to self destruct, ending the army of the dead once and for all. The majority of the army died in the battle dropping from 40,000 to just 10,000. To prevent history from repeating itself, the new night king could not be sent to north of the wall and had to be killed right here by taking out the dragon glass of his chest. Danaerys volunteered to be the one who puts Jon out of his misery just like what she did with Khal Drogo. Danaerys while in tears slowly removed the dagger off Jon and he immediately collapsed dead. Jon's body was then sent to Winterfell and buried in the crypts beside Ned Stark.

Episode 6

With winter finally over and all of Cersei's forces destroyed the iron throne was open for the talking. Bran confirmed that Cersei is still alive and even though she has no army she returned to kings landing and refuses to surrender the iron throne. Although Tyrion attempted to convince Danaerys to give Cersei a final chance to surrender and spare her life she insists to have her executed for betraying them. Jaime who is still devastated by the loss of Brienne is convinced by Tyrion to go to kings landing and convince Cersei that her cause is lost and to flee together to Essos. Jaime goes to kings ladning with the hound who wanted to kill his brother. Arya at first wanted to join them but is convinced by Sandor to let go of her life of vengeance. Jaime and Sandor arrived at the destroyed city when Danaery's and what remained of her army where at the city outskirts. They reached the ruins of the redkeep to find Cersei siting on the iron throne. Her face was covered with scars and she seemed madder than ever. When she noticed Jaime she yelled traitor and ordered the mountain to bring her his head. Sandor challenged his brother and in duel and distracted him from Jaime. Cersei had made qyburn place all the wild fire stock he found across the city ruins and in the red keep. She even placed one wild fire jar just beside her at the iron throne. She planned to burn along side with danaerys and her army for if she cant have the iron throne then no one else can. Now with Danaerys forces marching inside the barren city walking past by all haunted ruins of houses, Jaime approached Cersei, he tried to reason with her telling him that they could flee now leave all their past life behind and start a new one in Essos. Cersei would not oblige and instead she then screamed at Qyburn burn them all. Jaime now realizing that Cersei is completly lost knew what needs to be done. He stabbed Cersei with his Valerian steal sword widows wale fulfilling the volaqar prophecy and quickly chased Qyburn. However Jaime could not kill Qyburn on time as the wild fire began exploding. Qyburn and Jaime where first to be consumed by the wild fire, the clegane brothers where next who died amidst their duel,soon Danaerys' entire army where caught down in the explosion including Grey Worm and Varys. Danaerys who was riding drogon survived the explosion only to helplessly witness the death of her army under the hands of Cersei Lannister. Danaerys flew to the red keep. She found the remains of Cersei Lannister still on the iron throne. Snow was falling on the Danaerys arm. She now recalled her vision in the house of the undying in Qarth all those years ago. Danaerys finally learned that power corrupts and how absolute power corrupts absolutely. She decided to burn the remains of the iron throne and buried it along side kings landing.

The next day all the lords and ladies of Westeros were called for a meeting in the isle of faces. Danaery's Targarian declared that she relinquished her claim and abdicates her birth right. She stated that her father the mad king and Cersei Lannister were both consumer by the power. She explained that she does not want her fate to be the same as theirs. Her life dream has always been about becoming the queen of Westeros and breaking the wheel. Now she realized that she cant do both as she can't break the wheal if her only claim for power was her blood. Furthermore she received news from Dario Naharis that the former masters are now leading a new insurgency in dragons bay in an attempt to restore their power. She knows that since Westeros is at peace she can't be of much help to the people of Westeros and decided to sail back to Mereen and rule as the Queen of Dragons bay and the Breaker of chains where she can ensure that the people there never return to slavery. To remove the seeds of any future civil war she now ordered the lords and ladies of Westeros to chose among themselves the new ruler for westeros and in the future a gradual change to democracy should occur where the people of each kingdom would elected a representative. These representatives would sit on the new council advising the king and electing future ones. The new council past its vote and Tyrion and Sansa were elected to rule Westeros together as king and queen thus ending the Stark-Lannister conflict. The council also voted to burn down the isle of faces to prevent the creation of a night king anytime in the future this however lead to magic dying and which followed unforeseen consequences:

Drogon the last dragon died to Danaerys horror

Melisandre died of all age accepting the lord of lights will

Bran Lost his warging and green seeing powers

Arya lost her face changing powers

Danaerys now pregnant with Jon's child before leaving Westeros visited Jon's tomb in the crypts of Winterfell and a huge funeral was held where all the lords of ladies of westeros as well as most of the north's people attended to commemorate their savior.

Epilogue:

Danaerys ruled as the Queen of dragon's bay

King Tyrion and Queen Sansa's child will inherited Castely rock as the line of succession is abolished

Bran is lord of winterfell and warden of the North and married Meera Reed

Gendry is legitimized and inherited Storm's end married Arya who rules as a warrior lady to help change Westeros view on the role of women

990,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2019-7-10,2019,7,10,17,cbe0bc,self.gameofthrones,My head canon for game of thrones Season 8,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/cbe0bc/my_head_canon_for_game_of_thrones_season_8/,UnNamedUser66,1562746633," 

First of all this is the first time i post in [r/freefolk](https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/). Second, since game of thrones season 8 disappointed us all i wanted to share my own fan fiction which I believe how the 6 episodes could have provided a more satisfying ending to the show and can answer most of our questions and as well as talking in account the lore and all the 7 seasons of character development. Third even though i am more than a month late i have not read any other fan fictions in reddit so any similarities with other fan fictions are just coincidences. I have read though many theories and i did take elements from many different theories.

Episodes 1 and 2:

These two episodes play out similar to how they did in the show but with some key differences:

1 Jaime does not ride north alone and instead brings with him Bronn as well as the bulk of the Lannister army loyal to him in castely rock. On his way north Jaime frees Edmure Tully from the dungeons of the twins and then march north together with the Tully bannermen.

2 Sam and Bran spend these two episodes unlocking the secrets of the white walkers trying to find the key to defeat them. Sam reads about the Azor Ahai prophecy aswell as nissa nissa and lightbringer from the books he stole from the citadel and tells Bran where to exactly look in time.

3 When the nights watch survivors arrive at Winterfell, they tell Sam about the spiral symbol they found in Last Harth, Bran explains to Sam that this symbol was used by the children of the forest when they created the night king. So Sam goes to check for the symbol in his books. He finds that the symbol is a metaphor for light bringer. He also Finds out they light bringer was buried within the tombs of Bran the builder the first stark. Sam and Bran immediately head towards the crypts and towards Bran the builders tomb. They searched through his tomb for light bringer only at there to find in there shock rather than a legendary sword a simply dragon glass dagger.

Episode 3 The battle of Winterfell:

The battle began with melisandre appearing from the shadows and lighting up all the dothraki blades. However rather than suicide charge at the army of the dead they retreat towards the hills. Bran attempted to undercover the night king's location through ravens but his vision was blocked by a strong magic.

The battle plans made by Tyrion are as follows:

Two lanes of trenches are build to split the army of the dead into two. Then the trenches are burned through flaming arrows trapping a large portion of the army of the dead. Then the Dothraki charge towards then and destroy them.

Initially the battle went accordingly, the wights mindlessly attacked out of the bushes and were caught between the trenches. Then the archers on the walls of Winterfell fired flaming arrows down onto the trenches causing them to ignite and trapping the wights. Then the Dothraki charged down the hill and encircled the wights. However soon the white walkers revealed a much larger army coming out of the bushed and charged at the Dothraki overwhelming the trenches and surrounding the Dothraki. Jon and Danaerys who were reluctant to use their dragons fearing that the night kings might shoot them down as he did with Viserion attempted to cover the dothraki escape. Unfortunately they soon faced a rain of ice spears thrown by the white walkers from the bushes forcing them to escape back to Winterfell. However Jon noticed a weakness, he realised that the wights were being directly commanded by the white walkers rather than the night king. Now with Dothraki being completely annihilated and the army of the dead unopposed, they marched to winterfell and surrounded the castle in an attempt to simply starve them all out. With all hope seemed lost Jon made a desperate plan, he ordered all there best fighters to ride the two dragons and assassinate the white walkers, while the rest of the army attacks and distracts the wights. Jon Tormund Beric and Sandor rode Rheagal, while Danaerys Jorah Brienne and Arya rode Drogon. The two dragons flew past the dead army straight towards the wights while the gates of Winterfell opened. The white walkers began throwing their spears at the dragons and managed to shoot down Rheagal, however not before dropping Jon Tormund Beric and Sandor to safe distance near the white walkers. Drogon while just narrowly dodging an ice spear dropped Danaerys Jorah Brienne and Arya before escaping for his life and burning the wights heading towards them. A duel emerged between heroes of living vs the white walkers and one by one as the white walkers shattered more and more wights dropped dead untill finally the entire army of the dead collapsed as the last white walker was slain.

Jorah died protecting Danaerys. Beric died but not before slaying numerous white walkers fulfilling his purpose to the lord of light. Brienne died while saving Arya's life fulfilling he vow to Catlyne Stark. Lord Commander Edd and Lyanna Mormont aswell as half their forces dropping from 60,000 to 30,000 died in the battle while fighting wights in Winterfell.

The Great war was far from over as neither the night king nor Viserion where found. Bran flew his ravens across all of Westeros searching for the Night King only to confirm their greatest fear and finding him in kings landing.

Episode 4

The Night King burned down kings landing to ash and murdered most of the population including Euron and the golden company. The night used his original 100,000 strong army only as a bait to gain a much larger army of 1.5 million wights. Cersei Qyburn and Mountain did manage to survive by hiding in the underground of the red keep and sailing to Dragonstone. The celebrations in Winterfell were cut short after bran told them of the horrible news. Sam who still held the dragon stone dagger asked Melisandre of the azor ahai prophecy and light bringer. She explained that azor ahai was bron from ice and fire and is the hero who defeated the night king using light bringer. He forged light bringer by sacrificing his wife. She also stated that she believes that Jon Snow is the reincarnation of azor ahai as he is half Stark and half Targarian. Sam then showed the dragon glass dagger and explained to him that they found it in Bran the builder's tomb and he thinks that it is light bringer. Melisandre in disbelief denied claiming that this contradicts the prophecy so they came to bran for answers. Bran went back in time to find how light bringer was formed, what he found however was a man tied into a weir wood tree. He found himself in the isle of faces where the children of the forest created the night king. The rock formation beside the tree resembled the spiral symbol of the white walkers. He saw a sobbing woman carrying a dragon glass dagger and inserting it in the heart of stranded person. His eyes soon turned blue and his skin turned eyes. Bran left the vision as he finally found the key to defeat the night king. They must Head to the isle of faces in the gods' eye at the Riverlands and create a new night king. The prophecy is misunderstood there where two night kings in history, Azor Ahai defeated the original night king by turning himself into one. Him being a product of ice and fire was the only person with the power to kill the night king. After that he decided to exile himself north of the wall and build the wall to protect living from him. Over the next thousand years the magic of the night king overtook azor ahai consciousness and that is when he decided to attack the living (at the start of the show). The key to defeat the night king is to turn Jon the product of ice and fire into a new night king in the isle of faces. Jon at first was hesitant to be turned into a night king but was reminded by Sam of his Nights watch vows and the fact that they stand no chance against the night kings new army now almost 100 times their size which is marching north as they speak and is growing bigger. Jon and the remaining army quickly head towards the Gods' eye. Sansa stayed in Winterfell as their must always be a stark in winterfell and had to burn the dead. In the isle of faces they found Howland Reed. Howland reed the only other witness of Jon's birth, has spent the past couple of years studying the isle of faces. He knew by a vision from blood raven that the time will come where a new night king had to be created so he perfected the night king creation ceremony. The process would take sometime so they had to prepare to face the night king. The army constructed trenches to block all entrances to the the gods eye and build some scorpions similar to Qyburns ones to shoot down undead Viserion. Arya and Theon remained in the isle to defend Jon. As the ceremony was getting and Jon was tied at the weir wood tree started darkness emerges upon them as the army of the dead approached.

Episode 5

The night king has now arrived at the gode's eye. He has marched north all the way from kings landing killing everything on his path growing the size of his army reaching 2 million wights. The night king tried to fly directly towards the isle of faces with Viserion and kill Jon however he was slowed down by the scorpions with Bronn giving him a direct hit. This allowed Drogon to ambush Viserion and slay him. The night king however fell of viserion and vanished amidst the darkness. Meanwhile despite their air advantage the battle on the ground was a disaster as the trenches where quickly overwhelmed by the seemingly endless hordes of undead and soon the entire army was surrounded and where fighting for their lives. The ceremony was almost complete all what was needed was for danaerys (Jon's lover) to insert the dragon glass dagger into Jon's heart. As she unmounted her dragon, the night king and his army has now reach the isle of faces. Drogon tried to burn burn him but he was unaffected by fire. Now the night standing unopposed head towards Jon. However suddenly a large pack of dire wolves lead by Ghost and Nymeria warged by Bran appeared out of the Forrest. The dire wolves attacked the wights while Theon and Howland Reed charged towards the Night King. There Blades had no impact on the night king and they were both instantly killed. The direwolves all died fighting the wights leading to the final extinction of the direwolves including Ghost and Nymeria who died protecting their stark owners. This however slowed down the night king enough for danaerys to stab the dragon glass dagger at jon's chest and pushed it towards his heart. Jon's eyes quickly turned blue and his skin turned ice. Night King Jon emerged out of the weir wood tree and challenged the night king into a duel for the fate of Westeros. Night king Jon emerged victorious and the night king was finally slain ending winter. All the wights were now under Jon's command ceading their attacks and were then ordered to self destruct, ending the army of the dead once and for all. The majority of the army died in the battle dropping from 40,000 to just 10,000. To prevent history from repeating itself, the new night king could not be sent to north of the wall and had to be killed right here by taking out the dragon glass of his chest. Danaerys volunteered to be the one who puts Jon out of his misery just like what she did with Khal Drogo. Danaerys while in tears slowly removed the dagger off Jon and he immediately collapsed dead. Jon's body was then sent to Winterfell and buried in the crypts beside Ned Stark.

Episode 6

With winter finally over and all of Cersei's forces destroyed the iron throne was open for the talking. Bran confirmed that Cersei is still alive and even though she has no army she returned to kings landing and refuses to surrender the iron throne. Although Tyrion attempted to convince Danaerys to give Cersei a final chance to surrender and spare her life she insists to have her executed for betraying them. Jaime who is still devastated by the loss of Brienne is convinced by Tyrion to go to kings landing and convince Cersei that her cause is lost and to flee together to Essos. Jaime goes to kings ladning with the hound who wanted to kill his brother. Arya at first wanted to join them but is convinced by Sandor to let go of her life of vengeance. Jaime and Sandor arrived at the destroyed city when Danaery's and what remained of her army where at the city outskirts. They reached the ruins of the redkeep to find Cersei siting on the iron throne. Her face was covered with scars and she seemed madder than ever. When she noticed Jaime she yelled traitor and ordered the mountain to bring her his head. Sandor challenged his brother and in duel and distracted him from Jaime. Cersei had made qyburn place all the wild fire stock he found across the city ruins and in the red keep. She even placed one wild fire jar just beside her at the iron throne. She planned to burn along side with danaerys and her army for if she cant have the iron throne then no one else can. Now with Danaerys forces marching inside the barren city walking past by all haunted ruins of houses, Jaime approached Cersei, he tried to reason with her telling him that they could flee now leave all their past life behind and start a new one in Essos. Cersei would not oblige and instead she then screamed at Qyburn burn them all. Jaime now realizing that Cersei is completly lost knew what needs to be done. He stabbed Cersei with his Valerian steal sword widows wale fulfilling the volaqar prophecy and quickly chased Qyburn. However Jaime could not kill Qyburn on time as the wild fire began exploding. Qyburn and Jaime where first to be consumed by the wild fire, the clegane brothers where next who died amidst their duel,soon Danaerys' entire army where caught down in the explosion including Grey Worm and Varys. Danaerys who was riding drogon survived the explosion only to helplessly witness the death of her army under the hands of Cersei Lannister. Danaerys flew to the red keep. She found the remains of Cersei Lannister still on the iron throne. Snow was falling on the Danaerys arm. She now recalled her vision in the house of the undying in Qarth all those years ago. Danaerys finally learned that power corrupts and how absolute power corrupts absolutely. She decided to burn the remains of the iron throne and buried it along side kings landing.

The next day all the lords and ladies of Westeros were called for a meeting in the isle of faces. Danaery's Targarian declared that she relinquished her claim and abdicates her birth right. She stated that her father the mad king and Cersei Lannister were both consumer by the power. She explained that she does not want her fate to be the same as theirs.

Here are my notes thus far:

&amp;#x200B;

As seen first hand

1. Bronn has a 50% hit rate on drogon
2. Rhaegal receives multiple hits
3. Drogon forced to evade a barrage of shots.
4. Drogon uses evasive maneuvaring to destroy an entire fleet and city wall ring of scorpoins.

&amp;#x200B;

As spoken about through legend

1. Meraxes taken down by 1 in 1 million shot through the eye socket
2. Another dragon fatally wounded

&amp;#x200B;

Question

1. Was it ever stated that balerion and the other dragon also went up against scorpions? How did they fare?

&amp;#x200B;

I have a feeling that the Rhaegal scene was rushed and may not be representative. The 2 most representative scenes then would be Drogon having to dodge a barrage, and drogon making a surprise attack. This gives the writers leeway to buff or nerf dragon power also.

Overall it seems to me that scorpions are relatively weak then. Their main threat comes from surprise attacks. Do you guys agree/disagree?",9,6,False,spoiler,,,,,

\- The Dead still lose in Winterfell but retreat when the Night King realises how vulnerable he really is after many of the White Walkers are killed resulting in significant losses to the army (but not total)

\- Viserion still dies (presumably killed by one of the other dragons in this instance)

\- Bran informs the Starks and Dany that to win the Great War the Night King is now marching his army straight to Kings Landing which would guarantee a victory for the Dead because (A) A million people added to the Army of the Dead would make them virtually unstoppable (as well as the dead in the city which would come to ""life"") and (B) the Dragons beneath the Red Keep would rise again on the side of the Night King as skeletal nightmares against Dany, her dragons, and the Living

\- A raven is sent to Kings Landing requesting they evacuate and destroy the dragon remains (which Cersei obviously ignores)

\- Bran (not so) subtly hints that this cannot be allowed to happen  **no matter the cost**, as the world would be lost

\- Dany realises that with their army so wounded, there is no possible way for the Northern armies (and her own) to ever reach Kings Landing and defend it from the Dead. Nor would the Lannister army or Golden Company as they would lack any Dragon Glass 

&amp;#x200B;

Thus the only solution to this is for Daenerys to deny the ""resources"" of Kings Landing to the Night King. Instead of madness, this is a tragic sacrifice to deny the Army of the Dead an unstoppable force which would destroy the Living entirely (a line from Bran would say that even before death burning a body means it cannot rise again). 

&amp;#x200B;

The final episode would then be a climatic clash between the last of the Dead and the Living in which the Night King (and all his forces), are finally destroyed.

Also there is no night king in the books so they obviously don't end the threat by arya killing someone. They have also said before that the shows and the books will have the same ending.

First of all this is the first time i post in [r/freefolk](https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/). Second, since game of thrones season 8 disappointed us all i wanted to share my own fan fiction which I believe how the 6 episodes could have provided a more satisfying ending to the show and can answer most of our questions and as well as talking in account the lore and all the 7 seasons of character development. Third even though i am more than a month late i have not read any other fan fictions in reddit so any similarities with other fan fictions are just coincidences. I have read though many theories and i did take elements from many different theories.

Episodes 1 and 2:

These two episodes play out similar to how they did in the show but with some key differences:

1 Jaime does not ride north alone and instead brings with him Bronn as well as the bulk of the Lannister army loyal to him in castely rock. On his way north Jaime frees Edmure Tully from the dungeons of the twins and then march north together with the Tully bannermen.

2 Sam and Bran spend these two episodes unlocking the secrets of the white walkers trying to find the key to defeat them. Sam reads about the Azor Ahai prophecy aswell as nissa nissa and lightbringer from the books he stole from the citadel and tells Bran where to exactly look in time.

3 When the nights watch survivors arrive at Winterfell, they tell Sam about the spiral symbol they found in Last Harth, Bran explains to Sam that this symbol was used by the children of the forest when they created the night king. So Sam goes to check for the symbol in his books. He finds that the symbol is a metaphor for light bringer. He also Finds out thay light bringer was buried within the tombs of Bran the builder the first stark. Sam and Bran immediately head towards the crypts and towards Bran the builders tomb. They searched through his tomb for light bringer only at there to find in there shock rather than a legendary sword a simply dragon glass dagger.

Episode 3 The battle of Winterfell:

The battle began with melisandre appearing from the shadows and lighting up all the dothraki blades. However rather than suicide charge at the army of the dead they retreat towards the hills. Bran attempted to undercover the night king's location through ravens but his vision was blocked by a strong magic.

The battle plans made by Tyrion are as follows:

Two lanes of trenches are build to split the army of the dead into two. Then the trenches are burned through flaming arrows trapping a large portion of the army of the dead. Then the Dothraki charge towards then and destroy them.

Initially the battle went accordingly, the wights mindlessly attacked out of the bushes and were caught between the trenches. Then the archers on the walls of Winterfell fired flaming arrows down onto the trenches causing them to ignite and trapping the wights. Then the Dothraki charged down the hill and encircled the wights. However soon the white walkers revealed a much larger army coming out of the bushed and charged at the Dothraki overwhelming the trenches and surrounding the Dothraki. Jon and Danaerys who were reluctant to use their dragons fearing that the night kings might shoot them down as he did with Viserion attempted to cover the dothraki escape. Unfortunately they soon faced a rain of ice spears thrown by the white walkers from the bushes forcing them to escape back to Winterfell. However Jon noticed a weakness, he realised that the wights were being directly commanded by the white walkers rather than the night king. Now with Dothraki being completely annihilated and the army of the dead unopposed, they marched to winterfell and surrounded the castle in an attempt to simply starve them all out. With all hope seemed lost Jon made a desperate plan, he ordered all there best fighters to ride the two dragons and assassinate the white walkers, while the rest of the army attacks and distracts the wights. Jon Tormund Beric and Sandor rode Rheagal, while Danaerys Jorah Brienne and Arya rode Drogon. The two dragons flew past the dead army straight towards the wights while the gates of Winterfell opened. The white walkers began throwing their spears at the dragons and managed to shoot down Rheagal, however not before dropping Jon Tormund Beric and Sandor to safe distance near the white walkers. Drogon while just narrowly dodging an ice spear dropped Danaerys Jorah Brienne and Arya before escaping for his life and burning the wights heading towards them. A duel emerged between heroes of living vs the white walkers and one by one as the white walkers shattered more and more wights dropped dead untill finally the entire army of the dead collapsed as the last white walker was slain.

Jorah died protecting Danaerys. Beric died but not before slaying numerous white walkers fulfilling his purpose to the lord of light. Brienne died while saving Arya's life fulfilling he vow to Catlyne Stark. Lord Commander Edd and Lyanna Mormont aswell as half their forces dropping from 60,000 to 30,000 died in the battle while fighting wights in Winterfell.

The Great war was far from over as neither the night king nor Viserion where found. Bran flew his ravens across all of Westeros searching for the Night King only to confirm their greatest fear and finding him in kings landing.

Episode 4

The Night King burned down kings landing to ash and murdered most of the population including Euron and the golden company. The night used his original 100,000 strong army only as a bait to gain a much larger army of 1.5 million wights. Cersei Qyburn and Mountain did manage to survive by hiding in the underground of the red keep and sailing to Dragonstone. The celebrations in Winterfell were cut short after bran told them of the horrible news. Sam who still held the dragon stone dagger asked Melisandre of the azor ahai prophecy and light bringer. She explained that azor ahai was bron from ice and fire and is the hero who defeated the night king using light bringer. He forged light bringer by sacrificing his wife. She also stated that she believes that Jon Snow is the reincarnation of azor ahai as he is half Stark and half Targarian. Sam then showed the dragon glass dagger and explained to him that they found it in Bran the builder's tomb and he thinks that it is light bringer. Melisandre in disbelief denied claiming that this contradicts the prophecy so they came to bran for answers. Bran went back in time to find how light bringer was formed, what he found however was a man tied into a weir wood tree. He found himself in the isle of faces where the children of the forest created the night king. The rock formation beside the tree resembled the spiral symbol of the white walkers. He saw a sobbing woman carrying a dragon glass dagger and inserting it in the heart of stranded person. His eyes soon turned blue and his skin turned eyes. Bran left the vision as he finally found the key to defeat the night king. They must Head to the isle of faces in the gods' eye at the Riverlands and create a new night king. The prophecy is misunderstood therr where two night kings in history, Azor Ahai defeated the original night king by turning himself into one. Him being a product of ice and fire was the only person with the power to kill the night king. After that he decided to exile himself north of the wall and build the wall to protect living from him. Over the next thousand years the magic of the night king overtook azor ahai consciousness and that is when he decided to attack the living (at the start of the show). The key to defeat the night king is to turn Jon the product of ice and fire into a new night king in the isle of faces. Jon at first was hesitant to be turned into a night king but was reminded by Sam of his Nights watch vows and the fact that they stand no chance against the night kings new army now almost 100 times their size which is marching north as they speak and is growing bigger. Jon and the remaining army quickly head towards the Gods' eye. Sansa stayed in Winterfell as their must always be a stark in winterfell and had to burn the dead. In the isle of faces they found Howland Reed. Howland reed the only other witness of Jon's birth, has spent the past couple of years studying the isle of faces. He knew by a vision from blood raven that the time will come where a new night king had to be created so he perfected the night king creation ceremony. The process would take sometime so they had to prepare to face the night king. The army constructed trenches to block all entrances to the the gods eye and build some scorpions similar to Qyburns ones to shoot down undead Viserion. Arya and Theon remained in the isle to defend Jon. As the ceremony was getting and Jon was tied at the weir wood tree started darkness emerges upon them as the army of the dead approached.

Episode 5

The night king has now arrived at the gode's eye. He has marched north all the way from kings landing killing everything on his path growing the size of his army reaching 2 million wights. The night king tried to fly directly towards the isle of faces with Viserion and kill Jon however he was slowed down by the scorpions with Bronn giving him a direct hit. This allowed Drogon to ambush Viserion and slay him. The night king however fell of viserion and vanished amidst the darkness. Meanwhile despite their air advantage the battle on the ground was a disaster as the trenches where quickly overwhelmed by the seemingly endless hordes of undead and soon the entire army was surrounded and where fighting for their lives. The ceremony was almost complete all what was needed was for danaerys (Jon's lover) to insert the dragon glass dagger into Jon's heart. As she unmounted her dragon, the night king and his army has now reach the isle of faces. Drogon tried to burn burn him but he was unaffected by fire. Now the night standing unopposed head towards Jon. However suddenly a large pack of dire wolves lead by Ghost and Nymeria warged by Bran appeared out of the Forrest. The dire wolves attacked the wights while Theon and Howland Reed charged towards the Night King. There Blades had no impact on the night king and they were both instantly killed. The direwolves all died fighting the wights leading to the final extinction of the direwolves including Ghost and Nymeria who died protecting their stark owners. This however slowed down the night king enough for danaerys to stab the dragon glass dagger at jon's chest and pushed it towards his heart. Jon's eyes quickly turned blue and his skin turned ice. Night King Jon emerged out of the weir wood tree and challenged the night king into a duel for the fate of Westeros. Night king Jon emerged victorious and the night king was finally slain ending winter. All the wights were now under Jon's command ceading their attacks and were then ordered to self destruct, ending the army of the dead once and for all. The majority of the army died in the battle dropping from 40,000 to just 10,000. To prevent history from repeating itself, the new night king could not be sent to north of the wall and had to be killed right here by taking out the dragon glass of his chest. Danaerys volunteered to be the one who puts Jon out of his misery just like what she did with Khal Drogo. Danaerys while in tears slowly removed the dagger off Jon and he immediately collapsed dead. Jon's body was then sent to Winterfell and buried in the crypts beside Ned Stark.

Episode 6

With winter finally over and all of Cersei's forces destroyed the iron throne was open for the talking. Bran confirmed that Cersei is still alive and even though she has no army she returned to kings landing and refuses to surrender the iron throne. Although Tyrion attempted to convince Danaerys to give Cersei a final chance to surrender and spare her life she insists to have her executed for betraying them. Jaime who is still devastated by the loss of Brienne is convinced by Tyrion to go to kings landing and convince Cersei that her cause is lost and to flee together to Essos. Jaime goes to kings ladning with the hound who wanted to kill his brother. Arya at first wanted to join them but is convinced by Sandor to let go of her life of vengeance. Jaime and Sandor arrived at the destroyed city when Danaery's and what remained of her once mighty army were at the city outskirts. They reached the ruins of the redkeep to find Cersei siting on the iron throne. Her face was covered with scars and she seemed madder than ever. When she noticed Jaime she yelled traitor and ordered the mountain to bring her his head. Sandor challenged his brother and in duel and distracted him from Jaime. Cersei had made qyburn place all the wild fire stock he found across the city ruins and in the red keep. She even placed one wild fire jar just beside her at the iron throne. She planned to burn along side with danaerys and her army for if she cant have the iron throne then no one else can. Now with Danaerys forces marching inside the barren city walking past by all haunted ruins of houses, Jaime approached Cersei, he tried to reason with her telling him that they could flee now leave all their past life behind and start a new one in Essos. Cersei would not oblige and instead she then screamed at Qyburn burn them all. Jaime now realizing that Cersei is completly lost knew what needs to be done. He stabbed Cersei with his Valerian steal sword widows wale fulfilling the volaqar prophecy and quickly chased Qyburn. However Jaime could not kill Qyburn on time as the wild fire began exploding. Qyburn and Jaime where first to be consumed by the wild fire, the clegane brothers where next who died amidst their duel,soon Danaerys' entire army where caught down in the explosion including Grey Worm and Varys. Danaerys who was riding drogon survived the explosion only to helplessly witness the death of her army under the hands of Cersei Lannister. Danaerys flew to the red keep. She found the remains of Cersei Lannister still on the iron throne. As she reached out to touch the throne snow was falling on the Danaerys arm. She now recalled her vision in the house of the undying in Qarth all those years ago. Danaerys finally learned that power corrupts and how absolute power corrupts absolutely. She decided to burn the remains of the iron throne and buried it along side kings landing.

The next day all the lords and ladies of Westeros were called for a meeting in the isle of faces. Danaery's Targarian declared that she relinquished her claim and abdicates her birth right. She stated that her father the mad king and Cersei Lannister were both consumer by the power. She explained that she does not want her fate to be the same as theirs. Her life dream has always been about becoming the queen of Westeros and breaking the wheel. Now she realized that she cant do both as she can't break the wheal if her only claim for power was her blood. Furthermore she received news from Dario Naharis that the former masters are now leading a new insurgency in dragons bay in an attempt to restore their power. She knows that since Westeros is at peace she can't be of much help to the people of Westeros and decided to sail back to Mereen and rule as the Queen of Dragons bay and the Breaker of chains where she can ensure that the people there never return to slavery. To remove the seeds of any future civil war she now ordered the lords and ladies of Westeros to chose among themselves the new ruler for westeros and in the future a gradual change to democracy should occur where the people of each kingdom would elected a representative. These representatives would sit on the new council advising the king and electing future ones. The new council past its vote and Tyrion and Sansa were elected to rule Westeros together as king and queen thus ending the Stark-Lannister conflict. The council also voted to burn down the isle of faces to prevent the creation of a night king anytime in the future this however lead to magic dying and which followed unforeseen consequences:

Drogon the last dragon died to Danaerys horror

Melisandre died of all age accepting the lord of lights will

Bran Lost his warging and green seeing powers

Arya lost her face changing powers

Danaerys now pregnant with Jon's child before leaving Westeros visited Jon's tomb in the crypts of Winterfell and a huge funeral was held where all the lords of ladies of westeros as well as most of the north's people attended to commemorate their savior.

And an ending is either resolved or unresolved. When resolved, the characters are now in their proper place and the world is better off than before. When unresolved, the fate of the characters is confusing and you are left with Bran the Broken.

From Brans tumble out of Winterfell tower, to Lord Eddards beheading to the Red Wedding, Martin consistently reminds us that he was sent down to shock. This is who he is and why his work is unique. Whilst this ensures a captivating beginning and middle of your story, it also ensures an unresolved ending.

David Benioff and Daniel Weiss wrote the shows final two seasons without the benefit of Martins source material. Something the authors apologists have universally blamed for the decline in the shows quality. Unfortunately, the show had a hole in its heart.

In his 2014 interview with Rolling Stone, George R.R. Martin explained the key difference between him and the father of modern fantasy, John R.R. Tolkien: 

Lord of the Rings had a very medieval philosophy: that if the king was a good man, the land would prosperIn real life, real-life kings had real-life problems to deal with. Just being a good guy was not the answerSometimes what seemed to be a good decision turned around and bit you in the ass; it was the law of unintended consequencesMy people who are trying to rule dont have an easy time of it. Just having good intentions doesnt make you a wise king.

All he has done here is describe the downside of life: suffering with unexpected consequences. A good story also explains its upside: an inner journey to maturity where masculine and feminine value join to form the Self.

We all add value to the world. Men archetypally achieve this through their strength (both mental and physical), logic and self-discipline; women through their intuitive understanding, selfless love, and drive to connect with others. For an individual to become fully mature and give their life meaning, they must integrate both sets of value into their Being. This is the message we unconsciously pass down to each generation through stories.

We personify masculine and feminine value as the Hero and Heroine. The gallant knight joining the fair maiden in holy matrimony is therefore purely symbolic: you must integrate both masculine and feminine value into your psyche to become fully mature.

Lord of the Rings was not subtitled A Monarchs Standard Operating Procedure. It was a story. Whilst Frodo might seem like the hero, the only way he can resist the ring is essentially to remain a child. Audiences would have rightly rejected him wearing the crown. Tolkien therefore invented Aragorn: masculine value personified. He becomes King (fully mature and whole) by joining Arwen (feminine value) at the end of the story. 

Jon Snow is your archetypal rags to riches hero; the most obvious tell being his hidden (albeit ultimately inconsequential) noble birth. He progressed from the skilled, self-disciplined swordsman of the Nights watch to the leader of Northmen. Masculine value achieved. However, in Martins unrelenting need to shock, he first kills Ygritte and finally reveals Dany as the villain: destroying both of Jons potential queens. Masculine value cannot therefore join feminine to become whole and Jon is exiled. The Stark childrens ending are unresolved and confusing.

Striving to be egotistically subversive leaves us with King Bran and misses the entire point of storytelling.

He wanted his historical fiction to be real, but in rejecting the values of the Self, it became a story about G R.R. Martin.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

I have always wondered: what if Ramsay Bolton chose to stay and defend Winterfell instead of fighting Jon Snow forces in the field. According to the Game of Thrones fandom website, the Boltons had about 6,000 troops comprised of 5,000 Bolton soldiers and 1,000 soldiers from House Karstark and House Umber. The Boltons have a year supply of food. Jon snows forces had around 2400 soldiers, composed of 2,000 free folk warriors, 143 House Mazin soldiers, 60 soldiers of House Mormont, 1 giant, and a later relief force of 2,000 mounted knights of the Vale. 
Interesting enough if Ramsay Bolton held his stand in the castle of Winterfell, he could have won the Battle of the Bastard.  The only benefit Jons forces had was the giant to break down the gate, but with more Bolton archers at the wall, they could concentrate fire on the giant and ultimately kill it. Jon Snow would have to focus on creating a ram to break down the gates and prepare ladders to climb the walls. Since Ramsay has more forces, he can easily repel all attacks and simply wait for the winter.

I have always wondered: what if Ramsay Bolton chose to stay and defend Winterfell instead of fighting Jon Snow forces in the field. According to the Game of Thrones fandom website, the Boltons had about 6,000 troops comprised of 5,000 Bolton soldiers and 1,000 soldiers from House Karstark and House Umber. The Boltons have a year supply of food. Jon snows forces had around 2400 soldiers, composed of 2,000 free folk warriors, 143 House Mazin soldiers, 60 soldiers of House Mormont, 1 giant, and a later relief force of 2,000 mounted knights of the Vale. 
Interesting enough if Ramsay Bolton held his stand in the castle of Winterfell, he could have won the Battle of the Bastard.  The only benefit Jons forces had was the giant to break down the gate, but with more Bolton archers at the wall, they could concentrate fire on the giant and ultimately kill it. Jon Snow would have to focus on creating a ram to break down the gates and prepare ladders to climb the walls. Since Ramsay has more forces, he can easily repel all attacks and simply wait for the winter.  Lets  assume while the siege is in effect, the northern lords rise up, Jon still would not have enough men to capture Winterfell.

I'm actually disappointed. When I first saw the last episode of s8, I was ""satisfied"" if I remember well. But I never had the faith to re-watch that episode, I only saw it once. 
Now, every time I think of the show, I'm like ""Meh.. Got wasn't that good"" because this last season destroyed every single thing the 7 other seasons made (don't worry I still love the show, but this last season totally pushed me away of the Got mood. At the beginning of s8 I was over hyped EVERY DAY, and just after the final, I felt totally over with got) 
In my opinion, and I'm sure a loooooot of people will agree, they were going to fast. And that's the biggest problem I'll ever admit with this s8. 6 episodes isn't enough.
I'll always be mad at D&amp;D because they actually ruined the show for me. The writing was good in my opinion, as always, but the development arcs were to shorts to fit in 6 episodes (like Dany becoming the mad queen)

Fans of ""Game Of Thrones"" will soon be on a date with a part that lists the events that preceded the series.

That is, the events will be back thousands of years before the events of Game of Thrones and ""the origin of the world from the Golden Age of Heroes to its darkest hours.""

According to Martin, at that time there were 100 small kingdoms ruled by the Casterelli family, not the Lancaster family that ruled seven great kingdoms.

The paradox in this part is the absence of dragons and their replacement by other strange creatures, such as mammoths and white pedestrians who will enter into conflicts with the main characters in the series.

He comes up with the ideas to split up the armies and subsequently loses 2 fights with High Garden being wiped out (sure Euron's teleporting magic clone fleet is hard to anticipate), then he comes up with the idea to capture a wight despite never seeing them and as far as we know Bran told them theyre all together so Tyrion is basically sending them on a suicide mission that subsequently gets one of the dragons killed and allows the NK to tear down the wall. All for Cersei to do nothing about said suicide mission rendering it a completely waste of time, lives and pretty much the doom of the realm. 

He also keeps Dany from just taking king's landing for no real reason other than show extension.

Why was Tyrion written so terribly stupid from here onwards? If Dany made sense she should have killed him for pretty much fucking up everything, even Jon almost died because of this despite him knowing theres no plausible way that they would EVER be able to capture a live wight (also why doesnt the NK just render the captured wight dormant? He can clearly order them to not do anything or just walk one by one to check for the ice stability, why doesnt the NK just kill Drogon with the ice spear, he doesnt play fair its been established, also why doesnt he just command one of the undead giants to open up the castle black gate? They did it in season 4 while living).

People are bashing season 8 but season 7 really started messing with the characters (Sansa being bitchy and Arya being creepy and murderous) to the point s8 was already doomed to begin with.",6,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

1330,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2019-7-13,2019,7,13,20,cco4gi,self.gameofthrones,[SPOILERS] How I would've ended it,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/cco4gi/spoilers_how_i_wouldve_ended_it/,ILoveFarming,1563015790,"I don't have a unique or interesting way to conclude the nights kings arc so I will go with how the show went. Regardless of if I like it or not. \*\*I don't\*\* Anyways, my first thing is Rhaegal does not die in such a stupid way. He survives until the siege of Kings Landing by Dany. Varys does not betray Dany and instead sells Tyrion out to Dany. I believe even though it is because of the writers that he became useless it was time for Tyrion to go. Him being let go by Grey Worm is absurd. In my ending he gets executed by Dany instead of Varys. We know Varys was a mastermind but his motivations were always explained as ""Get the best for the people"" him supporting Jons claim is dumb. He knows Dany has what it takes and wants to be ruler, he would not want to force a man who does not want to be king to be king. I like Jamie's arc as I believe his weakness has always been Cersei, he took her shit for years and always had a weakness for her, and she was also pregnant. 

&amp;#x200B;

Dany starts to siege Kings Landing with Rhaegal and Drogon. Jon on Rhaegal and Dany on Drogon. Jon lands but suddenly Euron blows a horn. The dragons horn from the book but it only works on Rhaegal who goes berserk. A battle goes on between Drogon and Rhaegal where in the end Rhaegal is injured and crashes into Kings Landing. Not wanting to lose any more people and risk anything Dany goes straight for the red keep. Cersei loves her children more than anything, but hates losing even more. She orders Qyburn to go and ignite the wildfire under Kings Landing. Cersei gloriously dies while being burnt. Everything is green but miraculously Dany and Drogon break the green cloud in a stunning vertical shot. This shows she is a true dragon, even more than her ancestors. Jon has a duel with Euron and kills him. Everything is over, but everything is burnt and scathed. Dany does not go berserk but through her actions kills most of Kings Landing due to Cersei. Jon tries to kill Dany thinking she will only lead to pain and desolation. Tbh I stopped liking Jon, he is too self righteous and moral. This is a fight for survival, putting moral and self righteous characters in is kind of wrong. Drogon impales him with his claw.  

&amp;#x200B;

Sensing the burden on her shoulders and seeing how this is just going to end in more bloodshed Dany decided to go back to Slavers Bay and leave Gendry as king. Even though Gendry is a bastard he has the most legitimate claim. Also seeing Brans value and how he holds all the knowledge she makes him leader of the maestors. A more appropriate role than a cripple being a king. Dany rides back to dragonstone where she finds eggs laid by Rhaegal where drogon and her start to feel sadness. She takes these eggs and the unsullied, and remaining Dothraki and rides back to Slavers Bay where her true love Daario is waiting. Dany realized dragons and the targaryens will never belong in westeros. The Targaryens were always almost another race of humans and exotic and foreign in nature to Westeros. She realized her being there just causes more pain. She arrives in Slavers Bay and realizes she is pregnant by Jon. She carves a nice kingdom and gets rid of slavery in the area. She knows she is also foreign to slavers bay so she leaves the unsullied and dothraki there to maintain order and appoints new rulers. She then rides off to the ruins of Old valyria with her child, drogon, and the eggs. Her fate left unknown. 

&amp;#x200B;

In Westeros Gendry is now king. Arya does the same as in the show and decided to go out and explore. There is not a huge societal change. Such big change does not happen in such a short period of time. Well, at first. Bran leads a kind of ""renaissance"" he is to this world what exploration, roman knowledge, and enlightenment was to us. Farming becomes better and there is more stability. Westeros becomes a hub of knowledge while essos stays the mysterious place its always been. Magic mysteriously continues to grow stronger. The iron bank is worried. Maybe Dany in Valyria is responsible? Who knows.

Never underestimate the value of basic education. Get it right,even if your dream University is like..ON THE ARTICS. You might see some of your siblings get directly into apprenticeship or even say things like learn from practice,but NOPE. Learn things right, especially subjects like History and political science.

Step 2. Never Compare.
Do not compare yourself with others. Your sister might be a better shooter,your brother a better tactician,but keep your cool.Your chance will come.

Step 3. Hide your motives.
Don't be a loud player, exhibit A- Little finger.
Don't be an obsessive player, exhibit B- Mrs Lannister.
Don't be a know it all even if you are a know it all, exhibit C- the spider.

Step 4. For simple jobs like holding the door,find simple people and if they aren't simple enough,refer back to your basics on how to DIY.

Step 5. Manipulate with empathy.
Manipulation and empathy are two oxymoronic traits you can play to your advantage. Find the targets accordingly. For manipulation,you can use phrases like ' you are exactly where you are supposed to be' which will work on guilt ridden people while empathy works better on the young and the deluded *cough* Reeds.

Step 6. Prepare ahead.
Prepare ahead, including the minor details like Chairs, which will prevent last minute confusions. This will also give you ample time to make references to ancient Carpentry and engineering. 
Also,coming soon- "" How to make your own portable throne, chapter 1,with illustrations.""

Step 7. Bait it.
Baiting is an ancient war tactic which when used correctly can work you wonders. Be it ' bait for marking' as in lure your target to thinking he has marked you to 'bait for murder' ie to lure the same dude to get him bitchstabbed, baiting works all the time, especially if your target is a brain dead ice zombie.

Step 8. Divide the jobs.
A good leader should always be able to divide the jobs  amongst his subordinates eg Give the killing to the Assassin,which will not only reduce your responsibilities but also distract others from your hidden motives.

Step 9. Patience, the virtue of a winner.
Stick to your goals no matter what. Refer to your old-gran stories like ""the wood cutter who got offered the silver axe and how he waited patiently and inturn got 3 axes including the gold"". Turn down the northern silver for the emperor Gold.


And the most important of all,

Step 10. If you can't convince them, confuse them.

Nothing works better than the Art of confusion. Confuse them regarding your motives,confuse them regarding you claim( especially if you are the eldest surviving Stark son,ie the true heir right from the history of the continent, the oldest of the inhabitants,which again,you made sure by killing off all of the Children), confuse them regarding your successors-shout out to the idiots who think you are not a threat coz you can't have children, YOU ARE YOUR SUCCESSOR.coz bitch please, you ain't gonna die.


Also, bonus note.

A little black magic  never hurts anyone, especially Ravens.

Shocked at the reaction to a plot development.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/ccwvy3/finished_the_show_last_week_shocked_at_the/,MHAthroway1997,1563065520,"This isn't much of a season 8 defense post - I completely understand why the series' final season was poorly received (especially since I, personally, believe 7 and 8 should be lumped together as ""the finale season,"" considering everyone's character arcs in 7 end in 8). I understand why there is dissent in the lack of these character arcs, because the rushed, condensed pacing demanded all of it be told in the subtext. I got a lot out of it, personally, but on a surface level this was not a particularly well-written season of television. 

But this post isn't about all of that. Rather, a certain element I, for one, am shocked people cannot seem to agree on or understand. 

That being how Dany wound up. 

I've heard it all: that she went mad, that it came out of left-field, there was no foreshadowing, it assassinated her character. 

I went into the \*series\*, not the \*seasons,\* hearing all of this. I also went into the series with three-to-four years of being told by my friends that she was a one-dimensional character who acted as the creators' pet and white knight of the series. 

And I don't understand any of it. 

I saw a complex character from the start. A girl who had nothing but her crazy, abused brother; one who, when he died, she felt he got what he deserved. 

A girl raised by warmongering horse lords who respected \*strength\* above all, who were merciless to their enemies, and taught her life's harshest lesson at the end of the first season: a small mercy doesn't absolve you of guilt or well-deserved hate. 

A girl who founded Qarth, demanded with nothing to show for it, and was betrayed by one of her closest advisers. And she sentenced her and Xaro to a terrible fate instead of simply killing them. She wanted them to suffer. 

This was a girl who developed a god complex early. Who, because of her background, believed it her destiny to free the world from cruelty. She wanted to save everyone, the downtrodden, no matter how unrealistic it might be. 

This was a girl who sacked a city, who commanded families to be butchered in Astapor (quote: kill every master). Remember when Jorah told her the city was overtaken by a butcher named Cleos? She never had any consideration for the repercussions of her actions. Only the immediate effects. 

And what was so brilliant to me, while watching, is she was framed in a beautiful, holy light. Knowing what she becomes, my gut only sank in these scenes because I knew the viewer was only riding in her shoes, not the worlds. 

She commits similar acts in season 4, mindlessly slaughtering families to send a message of fear. Many of whom were actually innocent and actively opposed that which set her off, the crucifying of children. And when her dragons - as much a symbol each season of Dany's current state as the wolves were to the Starks - were out of control (and her inner Targaryen), Dany locked these aspects of her away in order to salvage this image of ""the nice queen."" 

She was, of course, horrified that her dragons would do such a thing, but it was another important less: innocents would die, no matter what she did. 

And in season 5, she still tried playing at the nice queen. Many times. And she was stabbed in the back for it and lost dear friends and allies. Only when Drogon came and reminded her of the real power on her side, did Dany realize and put the lesson learned here into action against the Dothraki. 

Fucking seriously, guys. Season 5 is all about Dany accepting that she is a conqueror and not a queen, that her destiny, what is effective and always has been, aren't clever plans or niceties or small mercies, but scorching the earth and making people afraid. 

Fuck, she even said she would burn all the slave cities to the ground at the end of season 6, \*\*the exact same thing she does to King's Landing in season 8.\*\* The ONLY thing that stayed her hand was Tyrion, demonstrating a better way of exercising her fear. We can only assume the slavers' caste system was dismantled in the months before leaving for Westeros, but I personally think it was a missed opportunity in season 8 NOT to have Dany hear that they've retaken the slaver's bay AGAIN. It'd really drive home that small mercies are clearly (to her) ineffective. 

Season 7 continued this trend with the Tarlys. Where, when all plans failed, Dany's only progress was to unleash her dragons and murder the Tarlys, just to prevent being betrayed again for having her kindness and mercy taken advantage of. 

And finally, season 8, Dany's mercy was once again used by Cersei. After defeating the Night King, Dany had automatically made the plan to destroy the Red Keep and use fear to make everyone afraid of her. It was Tyrion's plans and this holding back that made Dany lose Rhaegal and Missandei, and possibly Viserion and her allies in Dorne and Tyrell, too. 

After all, if Dany had done what she did at the beginning of The Bells' battle, then she wouldn't have lost anybody. That, I think, is what was going through Dany's head, among other things. 

Honestly, her conversations this episode prior to that battle tell so much of where Dany's mind is at. She has no love, everyone hates her, if she doesn't rule through fear then people would keep on resisting. 

Can you imagine, as horrible as this is, how little death there would be had Dany not been killed by Jon? I don't mean she wouldn't burn the cities of those who resisted, but do you honestly think any WOULD after hearing what she did to King's Landing? 

That was a failing of the final conversation between her and Jon, in my opinion. Dany didn't convey these ideas but instead spoke vaguely of ""small mercies"" and ""building a better world."" It didn't help this narrative that she'd gone crazy but to me she just sounded deluded. She had convinced herself as she always had, that she was right and this was her destiny. 

Honestly, I'm probably in the minority here. This will probably be downvoted to hell and back because I'm well aware of the hatred geared towards season 8. 

But I'm never going to agree that Dany's character was assassinated and it made no sense - her ending, that is. It was all there, and I think those denying it are caught up in their love for her like Tyrion and Jon were. 

\*\*tl;dr - IMO Dany's character arc wasn't bad, people are bad at reading her character\*\*",1,1,False,self,,,,,

Will it clear the record for most nominations in a single night?

For the major categories (I guess?) I have nominations for Best Drama, all of the acting awards, Best Directing, and all of the technical awards (Cinematography,Costumes etc) plus a few more that I missed.

For acting:

Outstanding Lead Actress: Emilia is a lock for the nomination

Outstanding Lead Actor: Sort of unsure about this one, Kit wasnt given a whole lot to work with but he did great anyways (post battle funeral speech). And it would be awesome if he could go up against Richard Madden in the category (Robb v Jon sibling rivalry)

Outstanding Supporting Actress: Lena and Maisie I think are locks, both Sophie and Gwen were submitted for consideration but will their performances be enough? I hope so, 4 actresses nominated for the same show in the same category is unheard of.

Outstanding Supporting Actor: Peter and Nikolaj are both locks for me.

Outstanding Guest Actress: A nomination for Carice in this category would be amazing.

What do you guys think? Agree/disagree with anything that I have predicted so far? Its also worth checking out the current odds on Gold Derby (they know better that I do)

1444,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2019-7-15,2019,7,15,1,cd4wtr,self.gameofthrones,(Spoilers) Finished season 8 last night. Shocked by the reaction to a certain development.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/cd4wtr/spoilers_finished_season_8_last_night_shocked_by/,MHAthroway1997,1563121547," 

This isn't much of a season 8 defense post - I completely understand why the series' final season was poorly received (especially since I, personally, believe 7 and 8 should be lumped together as ""the finale season,"" considering everyone's character arcs in 7 end in 8). I understand why there is dissent in the lack of these character arcs, because the rushed, condensed pacing demanded all of it be told in the subtext. I got a lot out of it, personally, but on a surface level this was not a particularly well-written season of television.

But this post isn't about all of that. Rather, a certain element I, for one, am shocked people cannot seem to agree on or understand.

That being how Dany wound up.

I've heard it all: that she went mad, that it came out of left-field, there was no foreshadowing, it assassinated her character.

I went into the \*series\*, not the \*seasons,\* hearing all of this. I also went into the series with three-to-four years of being told by my friends that she was a one-dimensional character who acted as the creators' pet and white knight of the series.

And I don't understand any of it.

I saw a complex character from the start. A girl who had nothing but her crazy, abused brother; one who, when he died, she felt he got what he deserved.

A girl raised by warmongering horse lords who respected \*strength\* above all, who were merciless to their enemies, and taught her life's harshest lesson at the end of the first season: a small mercy doesn't absolve you of guilt or well-deserved hate.

A girl who founded Qarth, demanded with nothing to show for it, and was betrayed by one of her closest advisers. And she sentenced her and Xaro to a terrible fate instead of simply killing them. She wanted them to suffer.

This was a girl who developed a god complex early. Who, because of her background, believed it her destiny to free the world from cruelty. She wanted to save everyone, the downtrodden, no matter how unrealistic it might be.

This was a girl who sacked a city, who commanded families to be butchered in Astapor (quote: kill every master). Remember when Jorah told her the city was overtaken by a butcher named Cleos? She never had any consideration for the repercussions of her actions. Only the immediate effects.

And what was so brilliant to me, while watching, is she was framed in a beautiful, holy light. Knowing what she becomes, my gut only sank in these scenes because I knew the viewer was only riding in her shoes, not the worlds.

She commits similar acts in season 4, mindlessly slaughtering families to send a message of fear. Many of whom were actually innocent and actively opposed that which set her off, the crucifying of children. And when her dragons - as much a symbol each season of Dany's current state as the wolves were to the Starks - were out of control (and her inner Targaryen), Dany locked these aspects of her away in order to salvage this image of ""the nice queen.""

She was, of course, horrified that her dragons would do such a thing, but it was another important less: innocents would die, no matter what she did.

And in season 5, she still tried playing at the nice queen. Many times. And she was stabbed in the back for it and lost dear friends and allies. Only when Drogon came and reminded her of the real power on her side, did Dany realize and put the lesson learned here into action against the Dothraki.

Fucking seriously, guys. Season 5 is all about Dany accepting that she is a conqueror and not a queen, that her destiny, what is effective and always has been, aren't clever plans or niceties or small mercies, but scorching the earth and making people afraid.

Fuck, she even said she would burn all the slave cities to the ground at the end of season 6, \*\*the exact same thing she does to King's Landing in season 8.\*\* The ONLY thing that stayed her hand was Tyrion, demonstrating a better way of exercising her fear. We can only assume the slavers' caste system was dismantled in the months before leaving for Westeros, but I personally think it was a missed opportunity in season 8 NOT to have Dany hear that they've retaken the slaver's bay AGAIN. It'd really drive home that small mercies are clearly (to her) ineffective.

Season 7 continued this trend with the Tarlys. Where, when all plans failed, Dany's only progress was to unleash her dragons and murder the Tarlys, just to prevent being betrayed again for having her kindness and mercy taken advantage of.

And finally, season 8, Dany's mercy was once again used by Cersei. After defeating the Night King, Dany had automatically made the plan to destroy the Red Keep and use fear to make everyone afraid of her. It was Tyrion's plans and this holding back that made Dany lose Rhaegal and Missandei, and possibly Viserion and her allies in Dorne and Tyrell, too.

After all, if Dany had done what she did at the beginning of The Bells' battle, then she wouldn't have lost anybody. That, I think, is what was going through Dany's head, among other things.

Honestly, her conversations this episode prior to that battle tell so much of where Dany's mind is at. She has no love, everyone hates her, if she doesn't rule through fear then people would keep on resisting.

Can you imagine, as horrible as this is, how little death there would be had Dany not been killed by Jon? I don't mean she wouldn't burn the cities of those who resisted, but do you honestly think any WOULD after hearing what she did to King's Landing?

That was a failing of the final conversation between her and Jon, in my opinion. Dany didn't convey these ideas but instead spoke vaguely of ""small mercies"" and ""building a better world."" It didn't help this narrative that she'd gone crazy but to me she just sounded deluded. She had convinced herself as she always had, that she was right and this was her destiny.

Honestly, I'm probably in the minority here. This will probably be downvoted to hell and back because I'm well aware of the hatred geared towards season 8.

But I'm never going to agree that Dany's character was assassinated and it made no sense - her ending, that is. It was all there, and I think those denying it are caught up in their love for her like Tyrion and Jon were.",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I know, they were in the riverlands with Tywin but Cersei, Tyrion and Joffrey obviously knew Stannis was coming for them

Bronn even said that the real soldiers were in the riverlands and they only had a handful plus the city watch left 

But absolutely no one in KL seemed to communicate with Tywin (who arrived out of the blue)
Hadnt he come in time, the city would have been sacked.

Maybe Im missing something big, in that case sorry

It's folky/instrumental, a lot of violin so I believe all GoT fans will appreciate - as Ramin's most loved scores were usually full of violin sound - e.g. Stark theme or Jon's theme. Very emotional music, I recommend you give it a try!

Here's some samples of their live recording:

[Wdrowiec - Wdrowiec (live)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iU6HvdMucjY)

or

[Wdrowiec - Obietnica (live)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHIlBfp375U)

&amp;#x200B;

You can also enjoy these sounds at Spotify (and other streaming services):

[Wdrowiec - Zwierzta Nocne (full album)](https://open.spotify.com/album/3DYaylzodCijcm6LTZo1cP)

(with my personal favorites: Tyle Lat - violin part sounding like Light of the Seven, and 902 - simply awesome!)

&amp;#x200B;

I just felt the need to share them, my friend is totally unaware, but definitely they'll appreciate some love from fellow GoT fans!

(fingers crossed). I've written up a guide to all the cast who've been submitted, their histories, and the current odds/main competition. Who would you be most excited to see nominated?",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/cdin4g/no_spoilers_emmy_nominations_for_the_actors_are/,reasonedof,1563203447," 

Emmy Nominations for Outstanding Lead and Supporting Actor and Actress are announced in 24 hours! Here are the current odds, cast histories and how the votes are worked out - how do you think the cast will go? I have put together some info below

**Who puts forward the nominations?** 

Either HBO/Game of Thrones (with associated promotional material to strengthen their case) or, alternatively, the actor/actress and their representation. If neither HBO or the cast member submits, they cant be nominated - end of story. Who is considered Lead is submitted by the show, previous to season 7, all actors were submitted in supporting categories. 

**How many nominees for each category?**

Six, unless its super close.  

**Why is this year considered a good bet at least for nominees?** 

There are very few previous winners in categories, particularly for the supporting women, which makes for a more open awards. Also, final seasons tend to be historically good for nominees.   
**What happens if they get nominated?** 

**Categories**

**\***Serious competion is anyone rated on Gold Derby by either editors, experts, or user categories with less than a 100/1 chance of winning

**Lead Actor**

**HBO Nominated:**

Kit Harington (nominated season 6 for Best Supporting, no previous wins)

Predicted to be nominated by experts/editors/those placing bets? Probably. Is sitting about 5th on the nominations. He is not expected to win. 

Competion - Highly Likely: Jason Bateman (Ozark), Bob Odenkirk (Better Call Saul), Richard Madden (yes, Robb Stark!) (Bodyguard) Sterling K Brown (This Is Us), Billy Porter (Pose) Other Chances: Brian Cox (Succession) Milo Ventigmilia (This Is Us)

**Lead Actress**

*HBO Nominated:*

Emilia Clarke (nominated season 3,5,6 for Best Supporting, no previous wins)

Predicted to be nominated by experts/editors/those placing bets? Yes, but not favourite to win. 

This is a fairly strong category this year and Sandra Oh is expected to win. 

Competion - Highly Likely: Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer (Killing Eve), Laura Linney (Ozark), Julia Roberts (Homecoming), Christine Baranski (The Good Fight), Other Chances: Robin Wright (House of Cards) MJ Rodriguez (Pose)

**Supporting Actor**

*HBO Nominated:*

Peter Dinklage (nominated all seasons 1-7 inclusive for Best Supporting, won Season 1,5,7)

Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (nominated season 7, no previous wins)

Predicted to be nominated by experts/editors/those placing bets? Yes, easily by both. Dinklage is the odds on favourite to win. 

Competion - Highly Likely: Jonathan Banks (Better Call Saul), Bobby Canavale (Homecoming), Kieran Culkin, (Succession) Michael Kelly (House of Cards), Other Chances: Peter Mullen (Ozark) Matthew MacFadyen (Succession), Justin Hartley (This Is Us) 

*Individual Nominees:* 

Alfie Allen - 1(?) previous HBO submission (season 2), no nominations 

Pilou Asbaek - no previous submissions / no track record

Richard Dormer - no previous submissions / no track record

Predicted to be nominated by experts/editors/those placing bets? No, though Alfie has a small groundswell of support and is ranked seventeenth favourite in the Gold Derby combined odds by Editors/Experts/Forum Users. Pilou and Richard are not ranking at all. 

**Supporting Actress**

This deserves a category of its own! This category is currently considered a headspin by experts because of all the ten major contenders only two have ever been nominated before - Maisie and Lena - and no-one has any history of winning. This category is not a will GoT get a nomination category, it's a how many nominations will they get category. Its likely too many nominations will reduce the odds of anyone individual winning but would also be nice to see in general.

*HBO Nominated:* 

Lena Headey (nominated seasons 4,5,6 and 7 for Best Supporting, no wins)

Sophie Turner (no nominations, no wins)

Maisie Williams (nominated season 6)

Predicted to be nominated? Odds place Lena and Maisie as almost certain nominees after Julia Garner of Ozark and good chances to win (based on historical data and performance). Sophie is considered somewhat less so but considered pretty safe this year. 

*Individual Nominee:* 

Gwendoline Christie (no previous submissions / track record) 

Predicted to be nominated? Is considered a maybe or outside chance (8th or 9th favourite), as a self submit with no data she is a big question mark for people doing predictions.

Competion - Highly Likely: Julia Garner (Ozark), Rhea Seahorn (Better Call Saul), Susan Kelechi Watson (This Is Us) Other Chances: Fiona Shaw (Killing Eve), Keeley Hawes (Bodyguard)

**Guest Actor**

No submissions. Criteria for this is very tight on how many episodes actors need to be in and ultimately there really arent actors that meet this criteria. 

**Guest Actress**

Carice Van Houten. (previously submitted as supporting actress, no nominations/wins) 

Predicted to be nominated? Yes, though guest spots are a bit all over the spot and hard to predict generally. She is helped by her history as a previous ensemble member of the cast. 

Competion - Highly Likely: Cherry Jones (The Handmaids Tale), Jessica Lange, Connie Britton (American Horror Story: Apocalypse), Philycia Rashad (This Is Us), Cicely Tyson (How To Get Away With Murder), Other Chances: Laverne Cox (Orange Is The New Black), Andrea Martin (The Good Fight), Sandra Bernhard (Pose), Malin Akerman (Billions)",7,0,False,self,,,,,

Danny turning evil was too rushed no it was not she has been set up to do that since the beginning she is constantly referred to as not her father, her brother was power hungry and so she was set up to be. She burned the soldiers even after they surrendered. 
How did Danny forget about the iron fleet? Did you in that scene as the dragons are flying around go hey the iron fleet are around here somewhere no. She simply forgot as she was focused on flying a dragon and taking over the iron throne. Oh but she was told about the iron fleet 10 minutes before yes 10 mins its to us but probably a week minimum in the show as it takes weeks to get to kingslanding by ship. Also she wasnt focusing during the meeting . She was sitting quietly mourning the death of Jorah and not listening to the meeting. 
The production sucked cause there was a coffee cup and some water bottles tell me this. The hand on the dinosaurs back to help it stand up did that ruin jurasssic park? No so why should a cup ruin a season.
The battle strategy sucked no the Dothrakis battle strategy has always been to run head on at the enemy its what they do. Every battle they do that. They value strength and where is the strength in attacking them form behind or the side. If the Dothraki cant even deal damage to the army of the dead by running at them then it indicates the strength of the whites. 
Jon snow does nothing actually he is simply someone who doesnt want to fight or rule yet is forced into doing both. Since season 5 he has wanted to live peacefully in winter fell, but the army of the dead changed that. So he wanted them gone in order to do so. Danny was required to do so and so he bent the knee. After this he just wants to go home and so he doesnt care. Shes my queen is him saying I dont care I want to go home.
Pacing- so do you want to watch 40 mins of Danny flying to kingslanding. This video states one episode before the battle of winter fell is enough. But is it. It is not because there is set up and tension from the 2 episodes before. No one wants to sit and watch 3 or 4 episodes of people traveling. Or preparing for war

Conclusion is that this season didnt suck. Its not cool to hate this season because your upset that Jon didnt win he throne. If you disagree feel free to say so although dont hate at me cause I said something controversial, Im down to have a civil conversation as to why its not that bad",0,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

For everyone out there who both hasn't read the books and is disappointed by the final seasons of the show, I would advise you to at least give it a try. That of course, if you haven't found in yourself the will to actually read them books. I bought all the books 2 or 3 years ago and read through the first one, but I didn't find in myself the will to continue. After the imense disappointment the final season of the show was to me, I was so pissed off and unsatisfied that I signed up for a free trial on Audible and I haven't looked back. Started 2 months (ish) ago and I've listened to 2 books and an half now. I couldn't be more satisfied with it: it's freakishly cheap (considering the 18 pounds = 3 books promotion) and the voice actor is AMAZING (Requiescat in pace, Roy Dotrice). Some of the names have weird pronounciation but I would go as far as to say he actually pronounces it better than in the show. Foreign names actually SOUND foreign, instead of sounding like regular ""english"" names with a funny spelling.

&amp;#x200B;

Having this said, if you're one of those people who's not satisfied with the show-ending but also can't really put your mind to read through those 5-7 books, try the free-trial. I know I must sound like I'm advertising for them or something, but in all seriousness, it's worth the try.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

I'm on a rewatch with a friend who hasn't seen the last season yet. And we just watched episode 8-3.

I know we're told that he is the memory of mankind. He remembers everything including the creation of the night king. Maybe that's the reason the night king is/was after him and wanted to kill him by himself.

Ok, I get that.

However, why? What's his purpose? Why does he have to survive? I mean besides being a Stark (the last male no less, but according to Bran himself he's not anyway). It's not that the three eyed raven is sharing his knowledge with anyone or recording it or anything.

Mankind didn't even know about him until Bran went back south of the wall.

Sam said that he would start destroying mankind by destroying its memory (or something like that) but when mankind cannot recall that memory? What's the purpose?

I therefore decided to try to rewrite part of that episode. I don't think there are any Spoilers but more importantly, I'm not a writer and this is my first time doing anything like this so please go easy on me if it sucks. Anyway try to enjoy and either listen to the music while reading it or imagine it while reading it... let me know what you think: 

The dead advance on the outskirts of Winterfell, Dany and Jorah tired and wounded from  the incessant unwavering onslaught of wights as they try relentlessly to hold on, Jon is desperately  trying to take out as many rotting corpses as he physically can; he gets rushed by a group of them,  a quick slash takes one out, a counter riposte stops another two, a quick combo shatters more of them but they just keep coming, Jon continues to fight with everything he has and then he spots him, the frightening mysterious King of the frost and darkness who takes menacing step after step towards the godswood. The air abruptly freezes, cold winds blow and through  the darkness, the Night King appears, the hound, Tormund, Gendry, Jaime, Brienne, Podrick, even Sam all try to rush to the godswood to take a stand against the Night King. As the 7 of them stand there trembling with fear, the night King just carries on and with every drawing step, the air chills more and more. The hound exclaims lets get this fucking icy cunt and they all charge at the Night King to somehow try to stop him reaching Bran. Seeing the oncoming hastily charge, the Night King just keeps walking, his pace doesnt quicken, his deathly stare doesnt falter and his icy curved blade remains sheathed. Gendry with his Warhammer reaches him first swinging like Robert would have but the Night King dodges without any difficulty as a high pitched, ear shattering scrape rings out as that unknown weapon is drawn. The night King carries on taking step by step but this time,  is effortlessly, simultaneously pushing back all 7 warriors towards the godswood. The remaining of the Dothraki come charging at the night King but before they can reach him, they are swarmed and almost drowned by an ocean of dead. This distracts the collection of fighters and allows through the blizzard , the Night King Generals the white walkers to storm the living. The walkers, race towards the defenders of Winterfell slaying  Sam the slayer and beheading Tormund. Now being vastly outnumbered, they're pushed back further and further but, hopes rise when the flap of a dragons wings can be heard alongside a distant roar. As it approaches, a mighty shadow is cast but the sky is illuminated by spectacular blue fire as the monstrous viserion tears into and lacerates  what can now be seen as Rhaegal, when viserion with one gargantuan sudden snap of a jaw, rips Rhaegals head off. Just as everything gets worse and seemingly impossible a trio of figures can be seen through the snow radiated by a strange glowing blade, whose light shone like dawn. As they approach, the figures can be seen as Grey Worm along side queen Daenerys and in between the two of them,  stands one Aegon Targaryen, wielding the glowing weapon, the weapon known in the prophecies as lightbringer. Daenerys takes to the skys on the nearby although wounded drogon to draw viserion away from the fight,  with everyone but Jon going after the walkers. After the night kings push,  they are no more than 10 meters from Bran. Theon rushes, spear in hand to assist Jon knowing he is about to lose his life, as he gets within striking distance of the Night King, all of his good and bad  moments  race through his head- helping Sansa, taking Winterfell suffering as Reek and everything else. Theon twirls his spear towards the night King but he just takes a swift step back and chops though the cold long handle of the Spear, Jon and Theon lock eyes as the blade of the Night King passes straight through the heart of Theon Greyjoy. Jon brutally swings at the night King locking swords with him, with the slippery nature of his blade,  the night king slides his blade off light Bringer and thrusts at Jon. Trading blow for blow, Jon begins to tire but the Night King is unrelenting, jon struggling more and more draws longclaw also being forced to use both legendary weapons to block the storm of swords from the Night King. At this point, the night king Is within touching distance of Bran. Suddenly, out of the great weirwood tree launches Arya, new Spear in hand hurtling at the night King. Still fighting Jon, singlehandedly the night King catches Arya out of the air. As her breath begins to fade and escapes, seemingly for no eason arya is dropped to the floor. Frozen partly in fear and also in exhaustion, Jon watches on helplessly at the night King reaching out to Bran. Bran, emotionless and fearless begins to speak: I know who you are he utters, you're the first three eyed raven. Almost bewildered by this,  it gives Jon time to muster up any sort of strength he had left and chopping off the Night Kings head using both light Bringer and longclaw. No head falls from the shoulders of the night king as he almost instantaneously shatters and as does his army. Shocked by Brans plan, Jon and Arya question Bran as to what he knew and how he found it, Bran simply replies: Im the three eyed raven, Ive spent the past years studying the night King, learning from the  children of the forest  of past and unraveling prophecies and mythologies, nevertheless, we did it, we won.",5,0,False,self,,,,,

Oh really? It was rushed? Cause from what I estimate it took 2 fuckin seasons to basically get to Night King dies, Dany turns mad, Dany dies, Bran is king. They could've prolly done it in one.

I read one online; here it is [https://screenrant.com/game-thrones-season-8-rewrite-ending-fan-video/](https://screenrant.com/game-thrones-season-8-rewrite-ending-fan-video/)

As interesting as it is, I have my own version. I like the one above, but still wanted to present how I would write it. What I am going to say is that, I actually did not mind Night King being defeated early; I kinda liked it actually; main villain does not always need to be the final villain, even in LOTR Sauron gets defeated before Saruman in the books.

So here goes my version of final season;

First four episodes are exactly as they were. We all know what happened. However, come episode 5 and here it starts to differ. The first half is the same; Dany executes Varys and invades King's Landing with her army. Difference I would make though is have the City Watch and Lannister soldiers both defend the city as opposed to just Lannister soldiers. Come the bell rings and here is where my version differs. Daenerys accepts surrender and actually shows compassion. But then, Cersei reveals at the window that she has a trick. Wildfire happens and destroys entire King's Landing. Cersei chuckles to Qyburn and it looks like it was Daenerys fault. Cersei goes down the Red Keep to see Jaime who figures out what happens. To complete his redemption arc, he kills Cersei, only to get killed by the Mountain. The Hound and Arya arrive and kill all of the Kingsguard and the Hound fights Gregor. He tells Arya to leave and she does, while both brothers fall in the fire.

In the last episode, the Westeros lords plan to execute Daenerys for destroying king's Landing, but Bran reveals it was Cersei who did and just framed Dany. Dany gets pardoned but resigns from the throne. I don't know whom would I put on the Iron Throne, but that's how would I change the story.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

Game of Thrones is not only my favorite show, it is one of my favorite things ever. The show taught me a lot about storytelling, and character development. Season 8 was very divisive. Personally I loved it, not saying its one of the best seasons, but still better than season 5. I understand season 8 had flaws. I will say certain elements felt a little rushed but I still loved it. One thing I did hate was that Bran got the throne. I thought that was dumb, and the finale left a bad taste in my mouth. But I loved the other 5 episodes. And while the season has flaws I dont like how the community has taken it out on D&amp;D. I mean these were the guys that gave us one of the greatest shows in the history of television. Just because they didnt put who I wanted on the throne does not mean Im gonna call them names. Yes they adapted the story from martins writing. But these were the guys that brought it together. To call the creators of Game Of Thrones Dumb and Dumber is childish and disrespectful. And I just get annoyed seeing all these subs saying boo D&amp;D at comic con.

GRRM has said before that if he wrote LOTR Gandalf would have stayed dead.

Jon Snows ending in the HBO show felt very disappointing.

The ending of the show is based off GRRM rough ending.

THEORY 

Jon Snow is truly dead and the story is centered around Dany, Fageon, Cersi, and Euron. Ramsey forces a charge to break the siege on Winterfell, but Northern lords still rebel and kill the Boltons. Sansa takes the Vale but then has her husband killed and marries Fageon. (Not before killing Littlefinger) Thats as far as my theory goes as of now. Please leave feed back",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Now....stay with me...what if...they make it a GTA V style game?...Yeah yeah I know it sounds stupid but listen...what if you play the game as each POV character from the books? (I'll get back to this in a moment)

The game starts with a short cinematic story about Azor Ahai and the long night. He will be presented as this shadowy figure, with no features whatsoever (nobody knows how he looked like). You get to know a little bit about his past and how he forged Lightbringer, then it jumps to the great battle with the white walkers (let's say it was just 1 big battle - we don't know if that's how it happened). You get to interact with the battle by slaying wights and some white walkers just like in AC Odyssey...then as you battle along the field the Night King appears as an ominous shadow figure with bright blue eyes and attacks you...the camera starts to fade from the battle and goes up into the sky and we get to see a shot of the stars and the moon...then a  cinematic about the construction of the wall and the foundation of the Night's watch appears . The cinematic ends with a black screen in which the narrator says something like ""they were banished to never plague the realm of men ever again...or had they??""

We jump 8000 years into the future when 3 of the Night's Watch men venture beyond the wall and meet the wights and white walkers for the first time in millennia, just like in the first book. You will investigate the area and jump from character to character and play and watch the story from each of their perspectives (just like in GTA V...I told you I will get back to this). You will control the last ranger that survives and help him escape the wights. When you exit the Haunted Forest on the horse the camera fades again and the music of game of thrones starts and the logo appears just like in LOTR.

For here on you get to play every chapter in the books as every POV character and unlocking areas of the map with everyone of them. You also get to jump to previous chapters and characters and replay some missions or do some sidequests for the commonwealth. I'm not sure how the leveling system would work yet but as GTA showed us you don;t need one...maybe each POV character gets a few specialities and get to improve them throughout the story. For example Arya could have sneak, 1 handed and agility, and as you practice with her and battle different foes and continue the story  you get to improve them.

Some factions might give you interesting questlines like the Night Watch, The Faceless Men etc.

I don't know how the game would end because...well..obviously the books are not finished yet but after the main story is completed you will get to roam the world with whichever character you want AND is still alive XD. Maybe you will get to fight some legendary creatures from old tales if you search for them, discover artifacts, free more slaves etc.

I know some characters have chapters where they only talk with others or witness events but I'm sure some system can be implemented there. For example when Tyrion demands trial by combat in the Eyrie, you get to fight as Bronn (which will not be an easy fight), and after he wins you get to choose what smartass lines you get to say to Lysa.

Well...that's my idea...some friends told me this is stupid or that it will never happens but it doesn't hurt to share it with you guys. So what do you all think?",7,1,False,self,,,,,

The second piece of my theory puzzle *also* comes from my obsession with Ramin, but this time in the form of the song *Light of the Seven* (my actual, literal, for real, number one, most precious and favorite song of all time that I will ever be blessed to hear **[TL;DR: I love it.]** ). 

So, keeping in mind that first bit about the LF theme/foreshadow and adding the fact that during *Light of the Seven*, which played while she was seeming to be basically on the right track towards becoming unstoppable, there's a part around 6:20 on the song that slips in a hint of the show's title song, and I believed, with a good amount of my heart, that that foreshadowed Cersei's ultimate crushing victory ",17,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

My question is, why would he not have done this before he and the others killed the Lannister boys? It would have seemed to satisfy the thirst Rickard and his men had for revenge by taking away the Lannister home and prevented (or at least delayed) the events of The Red Wedding. This would also give Robb a huge advantage in the war, the Karstarks would never have left his army, and they would have thier revenge/justice. It just seems a bit weird to me that Robb shows he has a mind for tactics and strategy but fails to see Casterly Rock as a target until it is literally his only option. It also would seem to me a natural course as his own home was just taken though not by Lannisters it should have put the idea in his mind at the very least well before the Lannister hostages were murdered.",18,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

While I agree that  the standard of writing of last 2 seasons were no where near the previous seasons, especially up to first 4 . They did manage to make Game Of Thrones a phenomenon that most other series can't compete with(up to season 6). It's not just their fault that the writing went downhill. A  good amount of the fault is because of GRRM too.  I think majority of fans agree that the writers did a really good job when they had the source material. When they started producing the show, they must have thought George would release the books in a fair amount of time. But George still hasn't released AWOW, and it's been 8 years! So D&amp;D did what they possibly could, cut out  a lot of things  from the very complex story line and simplify it and hence reduced the quality of the show. The thing is, George has a brilliant mind can write at his own pace, but can you imagine the situation of D&amp;D where they used to produce 10 episodes per year? Even a 2 hour movie takes around 2 years on average to produce, so it's understandable why they had to simplify it. Then of course  D&amp;D did fuck up a ton of stuff, things like Arya coming  out of nowhere to kill NK  or Daenerys forgetting about Euron is unforgivable. But do they really deserve the level of hate they are getting now? Where they are even scared to attend an event? I certainly don't think so.",47,0,False,self,,,,,

Since the show is over, I feel I can now accurately rate and compare the top fighters in the GoT Universe.

I base this list off of comments from GRRM and fights we've seen in the show.

1. Ser Arthur Dayne
2. Barrisatan Selmy (Prime)
3. Syrio Forel
4. Brienne of Tarth
5. Sandor Clegane/The Hound
6. Oberyn Martell
7. Jamie Lannister (Two Hands)
8. Robert Baratheon (Prime)
9. Gregor Clegane/The Mountain
10. Arya Stark

Reasoning -

1&amp;2 are pretty self-explanatory. GRRM has stated Dayne would beat Barrisatan with Dawn, and it would ""be a tossup without"". So that gives him the edge to being #1.

3. First sword of Bravos. Described by Arya as ""the greatest swordsman in the world"". Took on 4 Lannister kingsguard with a wooden sword, rather easily I might add....

4. I've never seen Brienne lose a battle. She beat Jamie (granted he was injured and weak), she beat the Hound (barley, but both were of the same state of health)

5. Beat the Mountain. Yes, he beat him in my book. Regarding swordplay, The Hound was better, if you watch Cleganbowl the Hound clearly is a better swordsman. Also, never got the chickens he deserved :(

6. Beat the Mountain. The only reason he died was that he got cocky and was waiting for a confession. If it was truly just a strait battle, Oberyn would have crushed him.

7. Regarded as an amazing swordsman, was inspired by Dayne when he was younger.

8. Was regarded as one of the best fighters and unstoppable during RR. Wish we could have seen him in some flashbacks

9. I think The Moutain is overrated. He's big and strong, but slow. He never won a single battle against another decent swordsman.

Awful? Nonsensical? Sure, but definitely not rushed. 

Looking at the pace of Season 8 it is immediately obvious that the writers had nowhere near enough ideas to fill half a season, let alone a full one. What plot points happened in Season 8? 

1.) White Walkers attacked
2.) Dany Burned down Kings Landing
3.) Everyone got a happy ending 

Compare this to Season 2, what happened then? 

1.) Jamie Lanister gets captured by the Starks
2.) Jon Snow gets captured by wildlings
3.) Theon Greyjoy invaded winterfell
4.) Stannis Baratheon uses blood magic to kill his brother
5.) The battle of blackwater (better than either battle episodes in Season 8)
6.) Cersei tries to have Tyrion Killed
7.) Catelyn releases Jamie Lanister
8.) Arya, Sansa and Dany all have their own story arcs developing

It is entirely natural for a story to have converging plot-lines. One of the main reasons so much more happened in earlier seasons was the presence of characters that died before Season 8. The extent to which this happened in Game of Thrones is extreme for two reasons:

First, almost everything that happened in Season 5 was almost immediately retconned in Season 6.  (Remember Jon Snow died? That was super impactful.) This happened because Season 5 was mostly a time waster for GRRM to finish TWOW, at the time Season 5 was being aired he alleged that it would be released within a year (l m f a o). Once it was apparent that TWOW would not be released prior to the show eclipsing the books, much of what was done in Season 5 was irrelevant, for example the politics of Mereen, the politics of Dorne, Stannis Baratheon existing and so on. 

Second, in a rapid attempt to quickly tie up complex storylines a majority of the significant characters in Kings Landing are killed in a span of ten minutes. Season 6 Episode 10 effectively truncated the complexity of the show to that of a standard TV drama. This may have been necessary to keep the average viewer interested in the final seasons, but it is also what lead to Seasons 7 and 8 lacking sufficient story points. 

The final season of Game of Thrones lacked, not because they didnt have time in the 423 minutes of airtime to cover everything they wanted to, but because they ran out of story to fill those minutes. Which I would argue is the opposite of being rushed. 


Another common argument as to why the final season was rushed is Danys sudden descent into madness. This is something I cannot disagree with more, breaking down the decade long transformation from innocent child, to ruthless dictator: 

Season 1: She watches as her brother is brutally murdered
Season 1: She burns Mirri Maz Duur alive
Season 2: She traps people in an underground cave to die 
Season 3: She Sacks the city of astapor for saying mean things about her 
Season 4: She crucifies hundreds of people 
Season 5: She feeds people to her dragons 
Season 6: She burns down 100% of the elders of an entire civilization 
Season 7: She burns soldiers alive 
Season 8: She burns a city alive 

Daenerys, very slowly, becomes the psychopathic dictator that she ends the series as. Every step of the way, she justifies her actions as being for the greater good. Its ok to crucify the masters, because they are the baddies.  In the penultimate episode she feels the need to burn the city down in order to take control of Westeros, which she genuinely believes will lead to more, and longer peace for everyone. 

This ultimately is the point attempting to be made by the story. Evil is never justified. An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind. The slippery slope of committing atrocities for the greater good, only furthers the cycle that is violence. MLK says it better than me  The ultimate weakness of violence is that it is a descending spiral begetting the very thing it seeks to destroy, instead of diminishing evil, it multiplies it. The entire time Daenerys believed her violence was justified, but it never was. It was not justified in the end, but it was equally unjustified in the beginning. It is never ok to burn someone alive. Hitler believed that he was justified in his actions, and those actions started out more benign than Auswictchz. Yet he was never justified, not in 1933 and not in 1945. The Nazi parrallels in the final episode were heavy handed but very apt. 

It was not a snap that happened to Daenerys, as many people are calling it, but rather a constant progression of unforgettable acts that she continues to justify. In no way did her character arc feel rushed.",20,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Pless hear me out.

I made [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/cdlmrr/spoilers_finished_the_series_last_night_surprised/) earlier this week explaining why I didn't find Dany's turn unbelievable. It got quite a big of agreement, though I destroyed some of my credibility by being unaccustomed to internet debating (I don't internet much in case you can't tell). I'd like to apologize for that, and hope that despite this you can still find some value in my opinion.

I'm going to go right off the bat and say I COMPLETELY understand the backlash this turn of events got. Because when powering through the series for the first time over the course of a month, my mind was spinning with questions about the White Walkers: what do they want? What is their connection to Bran? What is their big involvement?

Needless to say, to find them anticlimactic is perfectly justified. And this is what I knew going into the show, thanks to my disappointed friends (some, though, saw it a different way, which I will communicate now).

But first, as I entered season 5 and still hadn't heard much about them nor seen them, I found myself curious as to how anybody could have thought they were going to be huge when they were hardly a primary element in the series. Yes, they drove the Wall plot, but as a presence they were always something in the background.

So, why exactly am I fine with how they wound up? What their overarching purpose in the narrative is?

For starters, and primarily, it has to do with what they were thematically, and how this equated to their presence and involvement in the series as a whole.

The White Walkers, up until their last moments, are personifications of death. Winter is death, ice is death whereas fire is life. What is death in the series, as a concept? It's the driving force - it's what fuels every decision every character makes, a fear of it and a battle against its inevitability. Every single character is affected by it and changes as a result - that's the brutal society Westeros has wrought. Even Euron is the antithesis to this, in a way, because out of all the characters he is the one who doesn't fear death (i.e. ""Life is boring."") He always did what he wanted without any fear, because that fear is what holds us back and controls us. Euron just did what he wanted, and thus was the one character who died with a smile on his face.

And the Night's Watch, conversely, is all about giving your life up to death for the sake of the many. We see characters in the Night's Watch making all kinds of choices based upon this philosophy, from Pyp, to Thorne, to Karl Tanner to Jon Snow.

The White Walkers had a presence about them that was representative of these ideas: they were unstoppable, they were unfeeling, they were inevitable. In season 6, episode 6, Jon and Beric have a great little conversation about this:

""Death is the enemy. The first enemy and the last.""

""But we all die.""

""The enemy always wins. And we still have to fight it. That's all I know.""

""...I am the shield that guards the realms of men.""

The meaning here is straightforward, I think: despite its inevitability, not just the White Walkers but death as a concept, we can't just give up and let it happen. We need to fight to the last breath and do what we can to play our part (a la Lord of Light's philosophy, and Bran's, coincidentally). And we see this in the amazing battle itself: every character fighting odds that are constantly called hopeless, even those pressed against a wall (which, I attribute their survival to the virtue of that desperate moment only lasting seconds (slow motion) and by virtue of them being great warriors).

In stopping the Night King, Arya doesn't end death in the world, as we see in the imagery of the finale at King's Landing (the snow). All she's told is, ""Not today."" We all die, but that doesn't mean the Night King is that final death.

I can see the disappointment in the fact that this should mean the White Walkers were supposed to win. But they weren't, I feel, because I don't think it would have been good storytelling to suddenly have them be the big bad when the entire series was about an ongoing struggle for survival. Yes, they are the antithesis to this, the White Walkers. But is it not fitting they end up being just another necessary means to an end?

If not for them, Dany wouldn't have played her part in bringing Bran to the throne.

And Bran - what about Bran? What about the Night King?

I really wish the last season wasn't rushed so we got more out of these characters. Because we don't get an explanation as to why the Night King personally wanted to kill him.

The way I see it, if Night King is the personification of Death, then Bran is that of Life.

Hear me out: much like the deity of life, the Lord of Light, who moves people to where they need to be (how close these two are to one another, whether they're the same individual, isn't my point here). On top of that, the Night King wants to kill the Three-Eyed Raven - who knows all of history and is described as the world's memory, what separates men from snarling wights.

Bran had manipulated the show, and perhaps much of history, in order to align the pieces to defeat the Night King. The Night King, similarly, seems to have the sight as well: he is at the very lake Jon is trapped on when Bran sees him. He is waiting with spears to kill a dragon. He has a connection to Bran that forces him out of warging - even in the Long Night, Bran wargs into the flock of ravens and flies to the Night King, urging him to push forward with burning his own wights to get inside Winterfell. This made the castle fall much faster, as the intended plan to set up along the ramparts, inner defenses, and take a breather wasn't given. It was a glorious mess.

It's clear the Night King has a personal connection to Bran, perhaps just the Three-Eyed Raven in general. Perhaps, being one with greensight, the Night King had a personal vendetta against such powers for being made in the first place. After all, he in particular was sought by the children in order to turn into a weapon.

And that's the sad part: the Night King was a normal man until he was twisted into something evil: cold, emotionless, and driven by hate. The flecks of personality we see are in lieu of sadism and conceit. His missteps involve rushing the victory or not pursuing it, because he is sure of his own power and probably sees himself getting everything he wants in each battle: the First, Hardhome, the lake, Winterfell. He's a thing of hate instead of desire - a tool, an AI program, fulfilling its directive and enjoying it and taking it too far.

It's only fitting that this, combined with very particular circumstances, are what ended up being his downfall.

**I'm well-aware a lot of what I'm saying is thin and fueled by interpretation. I know for many this doesn't erase the sting of what was really built up to be ""the last enemy."" But for what it's worth, I feel the White Walkers were thematically in-line with the series as a whole, and that their defeat only enhances how terrifying an entity they are, considering how particular the circumstances had to be.**

I hope you enjoyed hearing my interpretation.",25,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

Theon starts thinking to himself about how nice it would be to command his own fleet in the night's watch, but it doesn't go that way due to Ramsay showing up. I think this may be some foreshadowing. In ADWD, Theon visits the godswood and prays to the old gods. He hears them whisper his name, which shows he has some roll to play. And in the released chapters of TWOW, the crows at Stannis the Mannis' camp say his name, another indication that the old gods have something planned for Theon. Please do let me know if I missed any others. But I think this adds up to the old gods keeping Theon alive so he can live his life out on The Wall as the Eastwatch commander and have his own fleet.

Throughout the story she evolves, from a young girl who's ambitions are freeing slaves and trying to fulfill her brothers wishes.  But as she grows, she starts to question who she really is and realizes she's lying to herself.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;You are the blood of the dragon. **Dragons plant no trees.** Remember that. Remember who you are, what you were made to be. Remember your words.  Remember who you are, Daenerys. **The dragons know. Do you?**

&amp;nbsp;

**-The Dreams of Daenerys Targaryen at the end of A Dance With Dragons**

&amp;nbsp;

Daenerys path to self discovery reaches its apex very late in our story, in the final chapter of A Dance with Dragons.  Daenerys tells herself that she is ""the mother of dragons"" and only just a young girl still, but deep down she knows it's a lie.  She states the only time she feels ""alive"" is when shes riding a top Drogon.  A hint comes when she dreams of Viserys, in her dream Viserys lashes out at her for her betrayal and Quaithe speaks to her

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Remember who you are, Daenerys Targaryen. **The dragons know. Do you?** Not yet.

&amp;nbsp;

**She starts to wake up**

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I am the blood of the dragon, she told the grass, aloud.  Once, the grass whispered back, until you chained your dragons in the dark.  Drogon killed a little girl. Her name was  her name  Dany could not recall the childs name. That made her so sad that **she would have cried if all her tears had not been burned away.** I will never have a little girl. I was the Mother of Dragons.  Aye, the grass said, **but you turned against your children.**

&amp;nbsp;

**And again later, when she starts to imagine Jorah Mormont.**

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;You took Meereen, he told her, yet still you lingered. To be a queen.  You are a queen, her bear(Jorah) said.  In Westeros.  It is such a long way, she complained.  I was tired, Jorah.  I was weary of war.  I wanted to rest, to laugh, **to plant trees and see them grow.**  I am only a young girl.""

&gt;No. You are the blood of the dragon. The whispering was growing fainter, as if Ser Jorah were falling farther behind. **Dragons plant no trees.** Remember that. Remember who you are, what you were made to be. **Remember your words.**

&amp;nbsp;

I'm blatantly ignoring that the show omitted the braids with bells for victorious khals, and merging book canon with show canon.

&amp;#x200B;

**The house with the red door**

Dany has longed for the house with the red door for years. She sees the Red Keep, with its red doors. Her subconscious ties it to her childhood home, and the inherited trauma of Rheagar's children being slaughtered and Elia Martell being raped and murdered rears its head\*. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The bells**

Dothraki khals cut off their braids and bells when they are defeated. Tinkling bells signify a victorious battle and spoils of war. Davos Seaworth never knew bells to mean surrender, and neither does Daenerys Targaryen. In the bells, Dany doesn't hear 'We surrender.' 

&amp;#x200B;

She hears: 'I slew your dragon. I bound your friend in chains and took her life. You were powerless to stop me.  I blew up a sept and yet the people of King's Landing **have not lifted their hand against me**. You guarded the realm during the Long Night, and yet the people **despise** you. Your advisors **betrayed** you. And for what? **Gold.** Amnesty. A boy who grew up a **bastard**.  Take the Iron Throne, then. Fancy yourself Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. You'll **never** be Queen of the people.'

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; *Three treasons will you know once for* ***blood*** *and once for* ***gold*** *and once for* ***love***** 

&amp;#x200B;

Anger. Loneliness. She sees the doors of her childhood home and thinks back to what she had. Her mind insists the Red Keep is the home she had in Essos, even though she knows that's impossible.  

&amp;#x200B;

In a moment of terror, she realizes her quest for the Iron Throne consisted of looking back, and back, and *back* rather than forward. She's chased an empty promise, a lie, a life that never was. Taking the Iron Throne doesn't bring Rheagar or Elia Martell back to life. Drogo is not by her side, to proudly roar he made good on his promise and took the Iron Chair for the moon of his life. Her Old Bear won't be the first to kneel and take his place as Commander to her Westerosi Queen's Guard. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*If I look back, I am lost*. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Her Hand hasn't given her sensible advice since... Her Hand hasn't given her sensible advice.  

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; *Ive known a great number of clever men.* ***Ive outlived them all.*** *You know how?*   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;***I ignored them.***  

&amp;#x200B;

The bells are Cersei's mockery. Cersei's triumph. Dany longs to retake the Red Keep, but home is a red door and it's not this one. The warlocks of Quarth gathered to work ill on Daenerys after she burnt their House of Undying... The people of King's Landing have done nothing to overthrow Cersei after she set wildfire to their Grand Sept.

&amp;#x200B;

Jon Snow rejected her. He doesn't want the Iron Throne, but he's an honorable man. If the people want him on the Iron Throne, he'll do his duty as a Stark and Targaryen. He'll take her for a wife, yes, but all will look to him as the true ruler of the Seven Kingdoms, no matter what title he gives her. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; *A Targaryen alone in the world is a terrible thing*.

&amp;#x200B;

Take the city peacefully, and Jon Snow will sit on the Iron Throne no matter what he wants. Take the city by force, and the Iron Throne is hers and they'll build a new world together, as equals.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*Are you a sheep?* ***No.*** ***You're a dragon.***   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;***Be a dragon.*** 

&amp;#x200B;

So she burned a city. For a new world. For a throne. For a life that never was and will never be.

After hearing all the ire for the season, I am now even more flummoxed by it after having watched all the episodes. 

Looking at many threads on here to try and make sense of it all, the general consensus seems to be, it didnt end the way **I** thought it should end, therefore it sucks. Also, All the closing character arcs were not laid out like breadcrumbs across seasons, therefore, it sucks.

Coming into the entire show fresh, I feel like I can look at it more objectively and say that nearly all of the criticisms are subjective **SPOILERS**:

-	Daenerys arc? Shes had an evil streak in her ever since she stepped out of the pyre. Shes like Anakin Skywalker, trying to appease the rage inside her as much as possible before she is ultimately triggered. Cersei just woke a sleeping giant./r/
-	Brandon Stark as king? Why not? Sure he said he didnt want the crown earlier, but guess what? Hes the three-eyed raven and he understands that he is the last, best, only choice for sensible rule, so he accepts his fate.
-	The Battle for Winterfell too short? Thats like wanting the Battle of Helms Deep to go on for months. War with the Whitewalkers is clearly not a slow, turgid affair. Its an apocalypse and it needed to end immediately.
-	Arya killing the Night King? Why not? Shes a badass and this isnt Star Wars, where the two big adversaries go toe-to-toe. Jon Snow has always been in over his head and its not the Night Kings style to get his hands dirty in war, as weve seen throughout the series.

Basically, I dont get the hate. None of this stuff bothers me. If I had to find something to criticize, perhaps season 8 could have been doled out over 2-3 years to match the pace of earlier seasons, and perhaps Jon Snows real bloodline didnt amount to shit, but these are not things that make me want to put someones head on a pike. Both The Long Night and The Bells were some of the most incredibly executed pieces of serialized television Ive ever seen and to stomp on those achievements is unfair.

Like the title says I've been a fan of the show since season 1, back when I thought the title of it was Game of Thorns (little bit dyslexic sometimes). It had guys like Sean Bean who I knew from LOTR, Mark Addy who I knew from a Knight's Tale, Lena Headey from 300, etc. Lots of people I loved from lots of movies and series' I loved. So I watched the first season, and was immediately hooked. As soon as the first season was done I went out and got the available books and read them all in a matter of weeks. And for the first few years of the shows run I was absolutely obsessed with it. I watched the show multiple times throughout the year and always re-watched every available season in the lead up to the new season. I've read the books several times each. I was on the forums daily reading up on theories (Night's Watch is Lightbringer, fAegon, Faceless Men conspiracy, and of course R+L = J which I was never a fan of) and making many of my own (I once theorized that the First Men were originally worshipers of R'hllor), keeping up on all news related to the show, fan casting characters that hadn't shown up yet (Viggo Mortensen for Qhorin Halfhand, Bradley James for Young Griff), etc. I even played a bunch of the games, pretty much all of which weren't very good. 

&amp;#x200B;

I say this because I like many was very disappointed by the show, but my disappointment started back in season 4. That's because from the end of season 3 onwards I was worried about the show runners, D&amp;D. If you go back to some of the panels they did in 2013, or listen to their commentary tracks for some of the episodes, they talk about getting introduced to the books. And they talk about how what they wanted most of all, was to get to the Red Wedding. They don't mention it specifically by name most of the time, but at least once refer to it in the same story as RW. And then when the Red Wedding happened, I couldn't help thinking that now that their biggest motivation for pursuing this series to begin with was done, they might lose interest. But for another year of hype I pushed that worrying thought to the back of my mind. And then we got season 4, and we didn't get the resolution to the Tysha story and 'Wherever whores go', Lady Stoneheart, Jon leading a ragtag defense of the Wall while injured, and much of what I loved about book 3. Instead we did get an idiotic raid to Craster's Keep to protect worthless information that whether or not the enemy knew would change nothing about the upcoming battle, a dumb, though very well choreographed, fight between Brienne and Sandor where two people with exactly the same goal fight because 'Hey wouldn't it be cool if', a way too long conversation about simple cousin Orson who loved to smash beetles, and some more dumb stuff. Overall I still enjoyed the season, but the cracks were beginning to show for me at least.

&amp;#x200B;

Then for the next few seasons, I drifted away from the fandom a bit. Season 5 was pretty bad (I literally put my hands over my ears and make loud noises anytime the 'Bad Pussy' scene is shown anywhere), although it did have one of my favorite moments of the series overall. Season 6 was better, but then we found out the next two seasons were going to be a lot shorter than those previous. I was very worried at that point, wondering how they could possibly wrap up the show in a satisfying way. I had flashbacks to George talking about 'Pulling a Lost' in reference to having a bad or unsatisfying ending, and if anyone here also watched Lost you might remember that the last three seasons of that show were a lot shorter than the first three. Not only that, but like with Thrones the later seasons started airing later than normal. I went into denial mode from then on, smiling through the pain of seasons 7 and 8 as we got moments I'd been hoping to see for many years such as Daenerys finally coming to Westeros, Jon and Dany meeting, Jon reuniting with Arya. But as George always told us it was bittersweet, because those moments were surrounded by a bunch of terrible stuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now here we are, over two months later. I still think about the ending almost every day, wishing that D&amp;D had left at the end of season 3 and passed the show off to someone interested in seeing the show through to a satisfying conclusion. We do have several D&amp;D free prequels coming up, and I am excited about them. Especially if we can get a Dunk and Egg series (though those stories might be better as movies). George says the writing has been going well lately on Winds and tentatively thinks he'll have a copy in hand for Worldcon 2020 (otherwise he's agreed to be imprisoned on White Island until he's done LOL), and I am holding out hope that we will eventually get Dream. But the story of A Song of Ice and Fire, I wonder if it will ever get told in a satisfying way from beginning to end, with all the characters, moments and plots we didn't get to see in D&amp;D's a Game of Thorns. I had an idea about this, that I wanted to present as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

We may have to wait a few years, but I'm wondering how many people would be open to the idea of a reboot. And what if it was done as an adult-oriented animated series (think sort of like the Castlevania series on Netflix, or the Berserk movies). This is an idea I have had for years, ever since I listened to George talk about the fact that after writing for Beauty and the Beast, the Twilight Zone and other series', and the limitations present in writing for television, that he wanted to write a massive story with as many characters as he wanted, massive castles, huge armies, dragons, and more. He made the books to be pretty much impossible to fully capture on film, and judging by what we got with the series I'd say he succeeded. Even the first season left stuff out because of the realities of filming a TV series. But with animation, you don't have those same limitations. You want a mountainous throne of swords, you can have. You want the Targaryens to have silver hair and violet eyes without it compromising the performance of the actors, you can have it. War Elephants and Ice Spiders big as hounds, we can have those as well. You could even bring back some of the actors from the series, those that would like to return, to provide the voice for their characters. I don't know who could possibly make this a reality, it is very unlikely, but a guy can dream. I still very much love the series, and the parts of the show that are good are still very good, though I don't think I'll ever watch most of the later seasons. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL DR - I loved this series from early on, was worried about D&amp;D's dedication from season three onwards, had my fears confirmed from season 4 onwards, was very unhappy with much of the later seasons and especially the conclusion but am hopeful for the future of the series, and I think an animated ASOIAF reboot would be cool.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

Who knows, might be a nice AU. 

&amp;#x200B;

 **Because plot**

* Dany and Jon are invulnerable to dragon fire, and the heat from dragon fire doesn't affect them. (This also explains why they can ride the dragons without saddles or padding. The heat part, at least. We're ignoring Jon's burned hand from the books and Season 1, as it's probably a clever red herring from GRRM to squish suspicions about his parentage) 
*  Jorah was a responsible man who taught Dany how to wield a sword
* Bran wargs Drogon to make him fight the Night King more effectively than a wild beast could. Gives him a reason for 'having to go, now.' 
* One dragon is enough to occupy Viserion to the point of Viserion not squishing Dany and Jon or to pick up the Night King and fly away. 
*  \-The Night King never reaches the Godswood. More than a bunch of Ironborn guard it. Sorry, Theon. 

&amp;#x200B;

 **The plan** 

Drogon fights Viserion to keep him at bay. Dany and Jon ride Rheagal, who'll circle und the NK breathing fire to keep him in one place. Dany and Jon will jump down and battle the NK with swords. Arya communicated with other people and explained her Faceless Man mojo and hitched a ride. She's the back-up plan and will spring into action when one of them falls or the Night King is distracted.  

 

**The battle** 

Either Jorah, Brienne or Jaime (whoever skilled enough to make it this far) follow the Night King. The Night King stops, turns around and resurrects the dead. The hero-on-the-ground shouts Dracarys. Rhaegal circles around the NK, unleashing hellfire. Hero-on-the-ground is burned to a crisp or goes down fighting the undead. Jon and Dany jump down, blades in hand, and duel the NK. Dragon fire around them blinds them, and  Viserion hits the ground, and dust swirls through the air. Fire and smoke obscure Jon's vision. The NK steps out of Jon's lunge while Dany steps into Jon's reach. With the dust, smoke and blinding glare from the flames, Jon knows he stabbed something, and when he pulls his blade out, it comes back wreathed in fire. 

&amp;#x200B;

The smoke lifts and he sees Daenerys, a pool of blood slowly seeping into the snow around her, her eyes widened in horror even in death.   The Night King raises his arms. Jon is rooted to the ground, staring at Daenerys. Her fingers twitch, and her eyes close. Jon crouches down, and he isn't sure if it'll work, but it has to work, and he brings Dany back to life by sharing Rh'ollor's magic with her through a kiss of life.   

&amp;#x200B;

Arya drops from Rheagal's back. The Night King grabs her, and she does her 'my weapon has two pointy ends, biatch' trick. The Long Night is over.   

&amp;#x200B;

**Consequence** 

Daenerys saw nothing while she was dead. Drogo and Rheago were not waiting for her in the afterlife. Lightbringer took something from her. She's cold to the bone. Her dragons nor her lover can chase away the coldness she feels inside. Viserys and Mirri Maz Duur haunt her nightmares. She's caught between dreaming of an afterlife crumbling to dust, and being awake and thinking about an afterlife crumbling to dust. She doesn't eat; she barely sleeps. She's long since abandoned the hope of campfire warmth and sits at the edge, never mingling with the others. Varys and Tyrion are concerned for her, as sleep deprivation and malnourishment make her incoherent and unstable. 

&amp;#x200B;

*This* is what makes her forget about the Iron Fleet. *This* is what makes her look down and see them without comprehending what she's seeing. *This* is what makes Rheagal's death such a devastating shock.  

&amp;#x200B;

Missandei is captured and executed, and Dany can't stop thinking about her friend disappearing into a black void as if she never existed at all. Jon Snow, the only person who could understand what she's seen and what she's going through, avoids her out of shame.  He recoils when she touches him, reliving the gut-wrenching realization of stabbing her.  

&amp;#x200B;

 When she lays eyes on the Red Keep, her clouded mind tells her it's her home with the red door from Essos. The childhood home she wanted so badly to return to. Where she felt safe and loved. Before she became Khaleesi, Mhysa and the Mother of Dragons. When she was just a little girl, who couldn't count to twenty.  Her mind insists Cersei and the people in King's Landing *took it from her*. This is what makes the bells the last drop in an overflowing bucket. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Be with me**

When Jon finds Dany, she speaks of freeing those who are at the mercy of others by ending their lives. She speaks of death as an end to suffering and heartache. In death, they'll be untouchable. They'll be safe. Let those in power reign over ashes as they please, for they'll free the people and **burn** the wheel *together*. Jon asks her what about the two of them, and his family, and their friends, and Dany will say that no-one else can understand their burden. No-one else can do what must be done. No-one else can deliver swift and fiery death to the ones who suffer. It has to be them. They'll grant their family and friends mercy by ending their lives. They'll be the first of the free people in the new world they'll build together. 

&amp;#x200B;

Jon asks her, ""But what about you? About your pain, your heartache?"" And she'll say something about being burdened with life to show others the truth. Jon tells her she shouldn't bear this all alone, that she's his queen now and always, and ends her life out of mercy and compassion rather than to save the world from a tyrant. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Arya and her voyage**

Later, after the hideous Small Watertight Impartial Council Scene, Jon asks Arya about the Faceless Men and what they think of death. Arya tells him, and he asks if she really believes death is mercy, and she'll answer ""No. I don't. That's not me."" It rekindles her desire to see the world. She recalls a question she asked when she *was* Mercy. ""What's west of Westeros?"" and she gets a ship and crew and sails off into regions unknown.  

&amp;#x200B;

Bran realized being a dragon is the bomb and spends most of his time 'going, now.' Who cares about kingdoms when you can fly without fear of crow-eating hawks?

&amp;#x200B;

Jon Snow is determined to build a better world for the free folk, who are free *because* they are alive. He likes to think Daenerys Targaryen looks down from the stars,  on a silver mare, with her Khal and her son by her side. Neither father nor son thinks much of the man who didn't want the Iron Chair. But since the dragon melted the spoils of war, building his own khalasar away from civilization is an understandable second choice... even if he must do it in a world of frozen water undrinkable for horses.",2,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

That being said I believe that last nights episode was very well done, and helped solidify what this entire series is about. The song of ice and fire was never really about wights, the game of thrones or children of the forest. No, it was about how shitty people can be, that despite the enemies we face we are still our own worst enemy. 

I think that the books will take more time to get to the point everything escalated to last night. We will have the traveling scenes we dont have in the show these last two seasons and we will get the information we can only infer based on minor clues we see on screen. Danys descent into madness will make more sense, everything that happens will make more sense. 

Looked at from a larger viewpoint, what happened last night was extremely poetic.  Jamie makes sense, he and Cersei have a love that transcends all, an unconditional love and no matter how shitty Cersei is, they have each other. Cleganebowl is a poetic ending for the hound, using his greatest fear to destroy that which made home who he was. 

At a bare minimum last night we saw characters that have been thought to have strayed too far from themselves come back and show just how human they are. When Cersei looked to Jamie and said she didnt want her child to die, and when Arya and the hound parted ways. Arya and Cersei in those moments showed that despite it all they are still humans. 

What does this all mean? I think that what you have through the entire series, books and show are a bunch of people whose moral compasses are on full display. Ned (and Jon Snow) who was/is always a good guy. Tyrion who at first seems like another Lannister but very quickly in the first book/season is shown to be a good guy. Dany who seems good, but has shown she will kill unscrupulously (dosh khaleen(sp?), slavers, and now Kings Landing) to get what she wants.  You can look at everyone and figure out where they fall on a moral compass. 

These moral dilemmas/choices are the causes that have led to the effects we have witnessed with this entire series. I think that theres a reason why people that pick up the series say Ned would make a good king, until he literally loses his head. 

Last nights episode was the peak of all of these choices people had made, everyone had solidified their positions with further choices they make. People are becoming more or less ethical, more or less human. Cersei brought the hellfire onto kings landing, and she sealed her own death warrant, however in the final moments she wasnt scared for her own life, she was scared for her unborn baby. She became more human. Dany tried her hardest to be good, but she always had the fire within her. She both literally and figuratively woke the dragon. Everyone is getting or going to get what they deserve.",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

It makes complete sense from an objective standpoint. HBO wanted to maximize the amount of nominations/wins they could get in each category.

Game of Thrones has seven main characters/stars:

Kit Harrington/Jon Snow
Emilia Clarke/Daenerys Targaryen
Peter Dinklage/Tyrion Lannister
Lena Headey/Cersei Lannister
Nikolaj Coster-Waldau/Jaime Lannister
Maisie Williams/Arya Stark
Sophie Turner/Sansa Stark
Peter has won multiple times while Maisie, Emilia, Kit, Nikolaj, and Lena have all gotten work have all gotten recognition for their work with nominations in the past.

Within the best supporting actor category, Peter is almost guaranteed the win. He had big Emmy bait moments in episode 5 and 6, and he is an award show darling. Nikolaj was also given Emmy bait moments in episodes 2 and 5 that guaranteed a nomination. HBO has submitted Alfie in the past when he was given more material but the academy has never given him a nomination. Its not surprising that they thought he he had an unlikely chance in a season where he was given significantly less screen time and material.

Theres also the issue of vote splitting. When several actors from the same show are nominated in the same category, it makes it harder for the voters to choose the best amongst them. Vote splitting occurs and a nominee from another show ends up winning the award. HBO wants to win not just get nominations. Vote splitting with Nikolaj or Kit hasnt hurt Peter in the past but adding Alfie to mix raises the chances of all three of them coming home with nothing.

It is the first time in the history of the Emmy awards that four actresses from the same show were all nominated in the same category. In the past, the highest amount was three so they went with the three actresses that they thought had the best chance.

Lena has been nominated multiple times in the past, shes the most critically acclaimed actress in the cast, her death scene was major Emmy bait, and HBO heads were/are banking on the very common farewell/retroactive nomination/win that award shows unfairly dish out.

Maisie is the only other best supporting actress submission that has been nominated in the past. Award shows are also desperate to stay relevant with pop culture and despite its controversy, her Night King kill was a huge pop culture moment. This season, Arya has also gotten more screen time and media attention this than any other female character in GOT aside from Dany. Her material in episode 5 was massive Emmy bait.

Sophie is a weird one. Shes never been nominated in the past and her performance in the past has never gotten as much praise as the others. She also wasnt given any Emmy bait moments like the others. I guess the funeral scene could be counted? She has no chance of winning and was a slightly surprising nominee. I think she was only submitted over Gwen because of her name recognition, Sansas popularity as a traditionally feminine feminist figure in later seasons, greater amount of screen time, Sansas greater importance to the story, and the fact that she would have been the only main cast member not to be submitted.

With all four being submitted, massive vote splitting is likely to occur. Across the internet and in different articles Ive already scene scores of people advocate for Lena, Maisie, and Gwen for different reasons while others have pointed out why each one doesnt deserve the win. Theres even a few that like Sophie for the win. Its like to go to Julia Garner, costing HBO a win that might have been in their pocket if only two GOT actresses had been nominated.",11,0,False,self,,,,,

I wasn't like many fans who were complaining about the quality of the show which, in their opinion, was going south especially since season 7 of game or thrones started airing. On the contrary, I was defending the show up until its penultimate episode of the final season. I secretly started liking game of thrones even more since season 7 (I had my complaints here and there, but, for the most part, i was falling in love with the show as it was reaching its conclusion) and the reason was simple I was (like most people, I'd wager) a casual game of thrones fan. I wasn't steeped into the world of fantasy novels. I didn't know the tropes, the hackneyed themes and plot points most writers either feel compelled to write about or simply lack the imagination to come up with something a bit more fresh and so when final two seasons were unfolding I found myself desperately, perhaps naively, desiring for jon snow to end up sitting on the throne. There is just something about the underdog, the undervalued, the discarded, coming out on top that appeals to me, so much, on a personal level. And when, of course, that ended up not happening my exasperation (perhaps misplaced, I since realised that perhaps I'm in a dire need to learn to put things into perspective, there are things happening in the real world that produce needless human suffering that are more deserving of my indignation, but I digress) expressed itself in the various posts I made afterwards on reddit forums dedicated to game of thrones fandom.

I was met with a rejoinder ""It's not your typical fantasy show. Here, good guys don't always get rewarded for their heroic acts"". It was pretty obvious from the beginning, even if you weren't a fantasy-genre superfan, that the show attempted to distinguish itself. It sought to dismantle many of the tropes and clichs that infest (and thereby reinvent) the very genre it was a part of. It was, among other things, an attempt to explore in a nuanced way the human nature- especially, how it tends to work for those who either themselves wield power or are close to those who do and the consequences that brings about to their lives-through the medium of fantasy.

And if the show had remained consistent and perpetuated its journey of upending fantasy tropes and shedding light on the complexity of human beings in power, through to its middle and until its very end, I would not be writing this post right now. [If I had been a showrunner perhaps I would have had more seasons than what we got where dany upon winning the iron throne without burning Kings landing- because she, thanks to shoddy writing, gave in to mad impulses- acts like a calculated tyrant, attempting to methodically establish a totalitarian regime to maintain her grip on power. Something like that would've been more in line with the show's penchant for realism, given how many political revolutions in our actual history have taken the shape of oppressed becoming themselves oppressors, resulting in chaos and confusion. 
Alternatively they could've shown dany not acting tyrannical but making politically expedient decisions that spell doom for her subjects. Like implementing a strict tax regime to support the crumbling economy of westeros, a natural disaster that results in famine that she deals in an inept way or aligning herself with people who want to preserve the status quo because it benefits them financially or otherwise, which perpetuates the unjust inequality causing people to rebel against her, ousting her and paving way for jon snow's ascent to iron throne who himself through his naivety makes terrible political decisions which cost him power and/or his life (this time he stays dead)] 

But, as we all know it leaned too heavily on the spectacle and conventional storytelling in its final seasons and, again, I was okay with it. I was okay with the evolution the show underwent (from the phase of exploration and audaciousness to the phase of audience satisfaction and fun) the problem(and a profound feeling of being let down it had begotten) for me came with the show not concluding itself according to the conventions, the phase it was in, dictated i.e. Everything playing out exactly as it did in season 8 with the exception of jon, after killing dany for burning Kings landing and killing innocents, becoming king; and the show ending right then and there (and so does this admittedly long and tedious post).",8,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

I'm not in PR, but to me this seems to be a disastrous silence/""deny everything"" approach that has only managed to make things worse.

Ill give you some examples: We know that at the end Jon kills Daenerys and Bran stays as king. This didnt please everybody for different reasons like Dany not being queen or Jon not being king but what would have happened if Dany did stayed as queen, well then the revelation of Jon being a Targaryen would have been useless as it is in the actual ending. If Jon stayed as king people would complain about Daenerys not being queen. So in conclusion it wasnt easy to end the series in a way that would please everybody.

Obvious credit must go to GRRM, but D&amp;D did a great job helping to characterise her in the show and Emilia Clarke was amazing at playing the character. Ramin Djawadi also did an amazing job with her themes and various musical accompaniments that really helped define her as a character.

Her journey from exiled abused teen princess, to conquerer of slave cities, to within touching distance of ruling Westeros. Her entire journey is based around her 'natural claim' to power. It is her name and her house that give her the greatest claim to the throne, but her personality and wonderful ability to make people believe in her were what really won so many over to her cause.

With greater self confidence and belief from this came her increased arrogance and her greater belief that she was destined to rule and was the only person truly able to lead. This was always to be her downfall. 

Whilst the execution of her final chapter was poor and rushed, the ending of her story is actually poetically beautiful. She inevitably fell victim to what she swore she wouldn't become; she wanted to break the wheel but she just became another spoke on it. She became someone obsessed with her right to rule, her birthright. The discovery of Jon's heritage was a great threat to her, as it removed the only claim she truly had left, as many already believed in Jon more than they did her: he was humble, true, honest. 

Many followed her and supported her claim because they BELIEVED in her. But over time they fell to Jon. Then many supported her claim because of her BIRTHRIGHT. But Jon's heritage came into conflict with this. Jon displaced her in every way. He destroyed her claim to the throne just as she was so close to it. He was everything she wasn't. But he was also everything she was and more. 

The inevitability and poetic justice of her journey is wonderful, and ties in perfectly with the overall message of the GOT/ASOIAF saga about the nature of rulers/monarchy/power-by-bloodline. Truly, ASOIAF was about Jon and Danny, and their differing claims to the throne. And in that sense, it was right that neither succeeded in the end. It would've been wrong. 

Anyway, this has turned into a long post but I hope the overall message is still there about how amazing her character journey is. It is one unrivalled in most current television. I hope that when/if TWOW and ADOS are released we get a more full/detailed account of Danny's downfall that truly befits her character.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

So, here it goes, thanks to a I bet you cant come up with a better GOT season 8 plot I will give you this:

All would stay mainly the same until the battle of Winterfell, in which I would change the stupid strategy of sending all the Dothraki cavalry to death in the first 10 minutes to a proper defense strategy, catapults firing from the rear, infantry in a shield wall behind the palisades and the cavalry ready in the flanks. However, the northerners and the Unsullied lose the battle of Winterfell and they have to retreat, both Drogon and Rhaegal are still alive and the Night King keeps Viserion.

Cersei gets word of the northern army retreating and decides to send the Golden Company to finish them and take out at least one of the main threats to her position, but the Lannister army remains in Kings Landing as garrison, to protect the city and prepare it for a siege for when the Night King (or the northerners arrive (if someone arrives).

The Golden Company and the Northern Army meet each other at a location that can be discussed, maybe Highgarden, Riverrun, Harrenhaldoesnt affect the plot that much. They prepare for battle. Shortly after the first skirmish, an icy wind alerts everyone of the arrival of the Night King, and the Northern Army and the Golden Company have to stop killing each other and join forces to face the Wights. In this epic battle, Drogon and Rhaegal fight to death with Viserion and the Night King, Viserion and Rhaegal die, but Drogon survives, (eliminating the stupid killing of Rhaegal at the hands of the Iron fleet) and the battle ends with the victory of the Northern Army and the Golden Company (Arya should kill the Night King in this version as well maybe with the help of Jaqen Hghar). 

After this victory, the Golden Company and the Northern Army parley, and the Golden Company finds out about the identity of both Daenerys and Jon when Dany asks them to bend the knee and swear fealty to herself as queen, then after some deliberation, the Golden Company decide to switch sides and follow the Targaryen blood (their founders bloodline) and all march to Kings Landing to overthrow Cersei. 

Cersei needs the help of the Iron Fleet to keep the peace in Kings Landing, and approximately half of the ships of the Iron Fleet rest unmanned, making it easier (and more plausible) for Drogon and the remnants of the northern fleet (plus some minor houses ships) to lay waste to the Iron Fleet during the attack on Kings Landing. From here everything could follow the same path, the bells, the rage of Daenerys, the burning of Kings Landing, Cleganebowl, the Queen of Ashes, and the feeling by the main characters that Dany should not be queen.

We get to the scene where Jon stabs Daenerys but before this happens she reveals that she is pregnant so Jon refrains from killing her, even though his mind is already set on that thought. Daenerys, convinced by her advisors, focuses on rebuilding the realm, her fleet and her armies before carrying out the conquering of the rest of the world that she promises in her speech. She also wants to take it easy with a complicated pregnancy, remembering the words of the witch Mirri Maz Duur. She finally gives birth (boy or girl, whatever) but she has a complicated delivery, and instead of giving her milk of the poppy to ease her pain, Jon gives her poison (or an overdose of milk of the poppy if you prefer) to end her life and save the realm. 

With all the guilt and grief, Jon refuses to become king, he chooses to go north beyond the wall, appointing Bran as regent until his newborn comes of age, and Tyrion and Sam are appointed as teachers and counselors of the newborn to prepare him or her to rule. All the other charachters can follow their life as described in the original plot.",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

**Presenting the Restructuring of S8 as S7E08, 09 &amp; 10**

If you consider the story of S8 as an endgame, culminating the story of 7 seasons, then instead of drawing out the story, the restructuring will work as follows:

The hyped up threat of the White Walkers will have more potency, and the Night King getting defeated in the penultimate episode will be keeping in with GoT tradition.

And using Jon's true parentage as the spanner in the works of Dany's destiny, the defeat of Cersei will not be enough for Dany to get to the throne. Then her tragic albeit foreshadowed turn as the last villain will be the subversive twist of the finale.

The three episodes are as follows:

S7E08 - The Army of the Living (1 hr 15 min)

S7E09 - The Army of the Dead (1 hr 52 min)

S7E10 - A Dream of Spring (3 hr 13 min)

la Avengers - Endgame &amp; LOTR - Return of the King

Story Beats Altered:

\-Deleted Bronn being hired to kill Jaime &amp; Tyrion

\-E08 ends when Tormund &amp; Edd return

\-E09 begins immediately when prep starts for the great war

\-Thus E09 shows the last night before the Long Night, &amp; ends at Dawn

\-Deleted Celebration scenes with Jaime &amp; Brienne, Gendry &amp; Arya, Tormund &amp; Hound, Sansa &amp; Hound

\-Deleted Bronn infiltrating Winterfell to threaten Jaime &amp; Tyrion

\-Removed Ghost from Jon's Goodbye (the idea is Jon is planning on coming back, while Tormund is leaving, and so are Sam &amp; Gilly, back to his widowed mother and younger sister, thus Ghost is not needed here)

\-Deleted Varys &amp; Tyrion's debate as the earlier scene is enough to make Varys' resolve to pursue Jon, &amp; Tyrion anyway has a weak defense for supporting Dany

\-Thus after Missandei's death, Varys sees no way but to betray Dany, and she fulfills her promise to burn him alive from S7E01

\-Deleted Arya &amp; Hound entering King's Landing by declaring their plan to Northmen

\-Removed Jaime's line about never caring for the citizens of King's Landing, innocent or otherwise

\-Euron is killed by Dany as Revenge for Rhaegal

\-Dany fulfills Missandei's final wish by burning down King's Landing (this twist occurs at the midpoint of the finale)

\-Jaime is now injured during Dany's decimation, and reaches Cersei at the spot he left her in S7E07 (the map room) and fulfills his own prophecy as well as her Valonqar one

\-Arya does not find any horse but the one in the charred girl's hand SMASH CUT to Tyrion entering King's Landing and reaching the same location

\-Deleted Edmure's comedic bit, as well as Sam's democracy suggestion

\-Deleted Small Council scene so as to remove Bronn's presence, Sam's presence here instead of his home, Drogon's mention, Bran's indifference to small matters, and jokes regarding ASOIAF and brothels

\-So after Jaime's story being finished by Ser Brienne, Commander of the Kingsguard, Jon reaches Castle Black to be greeted by Tormund &amp; the goodest boi Ghost, and the melancholic end with the Last of the Starks closes the saga.

And similar to Endgame, the last seven minutes are pure catharsis :)

If possible, please don't give spoilers about the rest, but it's okay if you wanna say ""this will be explained later"", though I don't think that will happen.

1. Why did the Lannisters take the dragon killing crossbow-like machine to the battle against the Tyrells? And why did they have it when they were taking the grains to who knows where? It seems odd to me that they would have the weapon there.
2. How in the world would Bronn acutally hit the dragon with it? He never used that weapon, specially in that size. Saying he was lucky sounds very pushing to me. He doesn't know how to aim that. Big weapons are made for area damage, like trebuchets, so you don't have to aim that well for them, but that crossbow had kind of a spear in it, you would have to aim it pretty well, even if the dragon was still (which it wasn't) you would have to in order to hit an important part.
3. Why would Daenerys get off of the dragon's back to take the spear off? Considering the spear had to come with an enormous strength to be able to hurt the dragon, it would be pretty hard for a human to pull it out. Wouldn't it have been easier if the dragon tried to take it off on its own?
4. Why the fuck would Jaime try to hurt Daenerys lol? As if they would not see him in his white horse coming. I know in adrenaline we can act pretty stupid, but that was just too stupid.

5. Also, why did Daenerys and her people suddenly started wearing black? In Mereen she used white and the people used brown. 

6. Going back to Jorah and Sam, I loved their interactions but there's something that I couldn't understand about grayscale. When we learn how Shireen got it, it's said she rubbed a doll on her face (which by the way makes no sense, how would she rub it on her face without also rubbing it on her hands? but okay), so we know the infection can reside on fabric. Then, after Jorah is treated, he puts the same clothes he was wearing before. Wouldn't he get infected again?

I know some of these questions (the first ones) can be answered with ""luck"" or ""simply because the writers wanted it that way"", but I'd like to discuss and maybe find an answer. And yes, number 5 is just plain curiosity.",14,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

I feel that Sansa &amp; Sandors character writings were perfect until the very end. Well, not the very very end... but well get to that later ~ 

Sansa Stark of Winterfell starts off as your stereotypical young naive girl. She has highest hopes of a knight in shining armor to recuse her in times of distress, she dreams of being the fair lady of a castle... shes perfect in the aspect of being a lady in this time period. We see this so in the show, but heres just even more textual evidence from the first few chapters of the first book:

* Sansa had the grace to blush. She blushed prettily. She did everything prettily, Arya thought with dull resentment. (Book 1, Arya I)

And thats not even from inside Sansas thoughts yet.
So we have this beautiful princess of the North, bound to wed Prince Joffrey at first. 
Everything, and I mean everything, takes a turn for the worst for our character Sansa from here. 
Her beloved prince, with a golden crown, turns out to be a pain-inflicting obsessed psychopath, who not only makes her stand just feet away as he has her father beheaded, but then makes her stare at it on a spike. 
.... And so we meet The Hound.

Lets dive into some of Sandors backstory (which we only hear told as a story, as to where we personally see Sansa experience scarring memories)...
We have a little Sandor Clegane, who wishes to one day be an anointed knight in gleaming golden armor, to save people form the horridness of the world. He sits by the fireplace, playing with a little toy knight peacefully. Hes only a boy. 
Then storms in the awful Gregor, infuriated by his little brother having messed with his toys... and shoves Sandors little head into the burning fireplace next to him. 
The Clegane family saves Gregors reputation by saying Sandors bed caught on fire. 
As he grows older, Sandor sees Rhaegar Targaryen knight Gregor, despite his awful, countless acts. The glory of shimmering armor is lost for Sandor... he knows these songs about the knights are fake fairytales, and that most of the knights are more than likely dishonorable men. The knights are not valiant, theyre hypocrites. Sandor joins the kingsguard as a sworn shield, but never actually takes holy vows to become and anointed knight. 

... Which leads to my personal favorite quote, from the night of the Battle of the Blackwater, when Sansa goes to the sept to pray. 
He is no true knight, but he saved me all the same, she told the mother. Save him if you can, and the gentle rage inside him. (A Clash of Kings)

And we have the Unkiss. Also on the night of the Battle of the Blackwater, the Hound leaves the fight (In the show, we have the marvelous Fuck the King scene) And after this, he goes to Sansas bedroom. Shes not there, and hes drunk- so he lies on her bed until she arrives. When she does, he tells her he plans to flee the city, and he will take her with him. Hes going somewhere North (Her knight in not-so-shining armor, offering her an escape route home with personal protection).
In the show, we have this scene as well, where Sansa says to him, You wont hurt me, and he sweetly, says, No, little bird, I wont hurt you.
 He holds a dagger to her throat and makes her sing a song (We got a somewhat deleted scene of this for the show, but it was acted out slightly different). She sings the Mothers Hymn, whom she had prayed for Sandor to. 
Sansa feels something wet on his cheek, blood and tears. He leaves. 

Now after the Unkiss, on multiple accounts, Sansa recalls Sandor kissing him on the night of the Blackwater. This never happened, but she casually remembers it. George RR Martin said it was such a small added detail that most traders wouldve never picked up on it. I could insert many citations- but everything about the Unkiss itself is pretty popular and not hard at all to find. 

And if we throw it back to when Sansa is in the city with Joff and a riot breaks out, Sansa is chased down by men who are about to beat and rape her. In comes Sandor with his cloak, fighting off the men, murdering them, and literally saving Sansa- throwing her over his shoulder and rescuing her. This is everything shes ever wanted, expect she realizes the songs didnt mention how terrifying the experience is. 

When Arya leaves Sandor to die, and hes trying to get her angry, he mentions Sansa... 
The little bird, your petty sister, I stood there in my white cloak, and let them beat her. This part of the quote almost seems like guilt and regret. He goes onto to say how he shouldve taken her until she was bloody, but this is after Arya clearly has no intention of killing him. And Id also like to point out- is utter bullshit, since he saved Sansa from rape before.

Now, in the final scene (show) we see between Sansa and Sandor, Sandor is annoyed with Tormund and the girls attempting to sleep with them. When the one girl comes onto him, she touches his arm. Okay? Remember that. And he literally growls and practically shoves her off. 
Sansa is watching- when she comes over, theyre dialogue can be interpreted a few ways. 

Sansa: She couldve made you happy, for a little while,
Sandor: Theres only one thing that will make me happy. &gt; Sansa??? Okay, obviously can be argued its killing Gregor, as he is about to do, but still. Let me have my moment. 
Sansa: And whats that? 
Sandor: Thats my fucking business! &gt; Now THIS is the line that fulfills my fantasies that the only thing that will make him happy is Sansa. Why so defensive, Clegane? And if he IS talking about killing his brother- he knows Sansa will attempt to stop him because she knows he will die trying. Either way, theres something going on. 
Sansa is silent, but doesnt break eye contact. 
Sandor: Used to be you couldnt look at me, &gt; Okay Sandor, go ahead and take note that ya shawty has been eyeing you all evening 
Sansa: That was a long time ago, Ive seen much worse than you since then. &gt; A long time ago: Back when she believed in fairytales and thought freaking Joffrey was a good man. Looks like she knows who a good man is, nowadays. 
Sandor: Yes, Ive heard... heard you were broken in. Heard you were broken in rough. &gt; he emphasizes the rough here- he knows it was violent. He knows his little bird learned that the world is unjust, that princes and knights and husbands can be evil.
Sansa: Yes. And he got what he deserved- I gave it to him. &gt; sorry, but the last time Sansa was almost raped, Sandor killed the men, picked her up, and carried her to safety. This time, she gave the punishment herself.
Sandor: How?
Sansa: Hounds.
He laughs. LAUGHS. Sandor Clegane? Showing mercy and laughing with no trace of hatred? Hm. 
Sandor: Youve changed little bird. None of it would have happened if you left Kongs Landing with me. No Littlefinger, no Ramsay... none of it. &gt; He was going to protect her for as long as she needed.
And then she gently grabs his hand. grabs his hand... and he does not flinch, or shove her off... he looks down at their hands touching.
Sansa: Without Littlefinger and Ramsay and the rest... I wouldve stayed a little bird all my life. &gt; She never would have known the truths that he knows. She wouldve been stuck in her happy fantasyland.


So yes, by their final scene, Sandor is a character who once had nothing but excitement for the knights and sing-songy world- only for it to be destroyed and him become a (pretty much to everyone except Sansa) hateful man. 
Sansa, also, once lived in the world of songs about knights and fair ladies and damsels in distress. Over the course of our journey with her, that innocence and naivety is long gone, and she saves herself. They are finally in the same lane. 
And I believe after the last conversation they have, he wouldve stayed in Winterfell. Maybe before as her sworn shield because he needed to protect her... he clearly doesnt now. But maybe because he can finally realize he has love for this girl, now a woman.

The character arcs between these two are almost identical, and clearly somewhat romantic. I will never not think that George RR Martin definitely played around with these two characters at least a LITTLE bit.

Joffrey is obvious. She inflicted the poison of his reign. His actions plus his parentage led to all out war, destruction, and death during what shouldve been a bountiful time (Autumn). So he dies by poison at what shouldve been a bountiful time (his wedding)as she helplessly watches. 

Myrcella parallels her sins with Sansa. She too is sent away to who would become the enemy, and placed in an isolated hostile situation where she was superficially treated well but also a pawn. Then, just as Cersei did to Sansas wolf (who was part of Sansas soul, just as Myrcella was a part of Cersei), she is unfairly killed as a surrogate for the Lannister they really want to kill. Cersei even echoed Sansa a bit with She was good. 

Not sure yet on Tommen. Not far enough to see what his suicide represents but it seems to be tied to her neglect and superficial planning which ultimately backfires.

While I know there were so many issues in Season 8 of GOT. I don't think his story should be of them.

Jamie  changed so much across the course of the show. Staring off as an  arrogant wanker, self-centered, mean - I mean he flat out pushes a child  out of a window, we can all admit, s01e01 Jamie is fucking trash. As  the series goes on, and especially once he's with Brienne, we see the  man grow through his experiences. He becomes, quite frankly, a great  man. His arc is a redemption arc no doubt - but let us not forget the  psychology behind the man. He's in an incestuous relationship with his  twin.

Our romantic relationships  are incredibly close. The bond between parents are close - The bond  between twins is INSANELY close. AND on top of all that - it's a toxic,  codependant relationship. Regardless of the fact that it's not healthy.  It's ALL he knows, and it's what he's used to. It's how he understands  love. Jesus Christ look at his father.  Imagine having a dad like Tywin  Lannister and then having loving healthy relationships without therapy.

He  loves Cersei. That doesn't make him evil. It makes him very human. He's  not there to be a stereotype, he's a complex, fucked up human.  Desperately trying to do the right thing.

He's  still the same man who jumped in the bear pit - End of S07 He leaves  the love of his life, knowing she will feel betrayed, KNOWING what she's  like. He's not blind to it. and risks his life to fight to save the  world. Every man counts, and hes one of the best swordsman in Westeros.

He  DOES treat Brienne like absolute shit. I'm not here to say he doesn't.  What he did to her was completely unfair, and a terrible way to treat a  friends (and I believe soul mate.)  However I don't think he used her. I  think in that moment, they've saved the world. He knows in his heart  that with her is where he should be. She'll treat him right. They'd have  a wonderful relationship together. True love. He goes for it.

Anyone  who's used to narcissistic relationships get TERRIFIED when brought  face to face with true authentic love because it's STRANGE. it's so  contrary to what they've been taught love is.

So he runs. Runs back to what he knows.

Is it kind? Is it fair? Is it rational? NO.

But it's true to his character.  
He's  a good man, doing his best to be good, but is also codependent on toxic  relationships. Not only did the show honour his story, it honoured  anyone who's been in a toxic relationship like that.

Theon and Jamie had perfect arcs.

TL;DR  Read it fucker! Jamie was in a codependant romantic relationship with  his twin. Just because hes a good man, doesn't mean he's not flawed. His  arc was honoured, because they honoured the best and worst of the man.",15,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Martin has a problem with homosexual dudes. I mean, sure... homosexual dudes are included, but that's about it. They are mostly just side-characters with little-to-no focus that are killed off in meanspirited and bullshit ways or just left forgotten.

&amp;#x200B;

And, even though Game of Thrones has a lot of emphasis on sex, it's always only either heterosexual or lesbian sex. The very few times we ""see"" gay sex, it's only implied, and we see it either before or after they have sex. George R.R. Martin apparently is even worse with this in the books, as he has Daenerys have another woman help her masturbate and having sexual intercourse with her.

&amp;#x200B;

Before you tell me it's supposedly because ""it's set in a world and time period where there's a lot of homophobia and repression"", that argument doesn't hold up. Same can be said for dwarves, yet Tyrion is a main character. And women being fighters? Arya and Brienne among others. Heck, we even get to focus on a fat spineless bookworm (Samwell Tarly) everything goes well for. Yet, all of the characters are straight.

&amp;#x200B;

And no, just because he is straight doesn't explain why gay dudes are being pushed aside. I'm a gay dude, and I have no problem including heterosexual stuff if I create my stories. And like movie director Ang Lee said about directing Brokeback Mountain - he's not a gay guy, but he learned as he went along.

&amp;#x200B;

So, once again... what is George R.R. Martin's problem with homosexual dudes?",1,1,False,self,,,,,

Why was everyone so shocked by The Bells? I mean, I was half expecting it at the time but now re-watching it of course she burnt the city without her circle holding her back. 

It's not really a Mad Queen story arc at all. Yes, her descent was when she lost all her friends, the Northmen wouldn't respect her, she lost two dragons, and her love affair with Jon wilted, but it was really just her reverting to her base instinct. She was a great story but people that got all butthurt because Dumb and Dumber ruined their beloved Mhysa weren't paying attention.

https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/c7ql6f/spoilers_my_alternate_ending_for_the_white_walker/

This is my alternate ending for the Iron Throne plot. These changes arent as extensive as the ones in the last rewrite, as I personally believed the Iron Throne storyline ended in a relatively fulfilling way. I did this for fun, I am not trying to do a better job than D&amp;D. So here goes:

Episode 4 remains mostly the same, my main change is to the part where Rhaegal died. Instead of the whole Iron Fleet hiding behind a rock, they engage Danys forces head on in a naval battle. At first Dany has the upper hand due to her dragons, but she is so preoccupied with the battle that she fails to notice Eurons personal ship hiding behind the rock, leading to Rhaegals getting shot by Euron and killed.

Episode 5 again remains mostly the same, the only characters whos stories are different are Dany, Arya, Jaime and Ceirce. Drogon burns Kings 
Landing during the battle, laying waste to the once beautiful city. However, despite all of the death and destruction, Ceirce doesnt ring the bells, she refuses to surrender to Dany. Dany realises this, and stops destroying the city, it was never her goal to hurt innocent civilians. However, her thoughts stray to what Ceirce did to Missandei, and what Euron did to Rhaegal. A close up of Danys face shows her hatred and growing madness overpower her better nature. Dany then goes on to attack Kings Landing even more savagely than before, slowly burning it to the ground. 

When the Hound confronts The Mountain, he doesnt kill the rest of the Queens guard. Instead, they go with Ceirce after Quyburn is killed. Th Cleganebowl remains the same. As Ceirce and her Queens guard are trying to get out of the red keep, they are spotted by Arya. Arya stalks Ceirce, hiding in the shadows. Arya takes out the Queens Guard one by one, disappearing into the shadows again after each kill. In the end it is only Ceirce left standing. Arya lunges at Ceirce, grabs her by the hair and slams her against a wall. Arya holds her knife against Ceirces throat, and tells her about how shes wanted to do this ever since the death of her father, how every things shes done since then was so she could get back at the woman who ruined her life. Ceirce stares at Arya defiantly, trying not to show any fear. Arya then lowers her knife, holding it against Ceirces belly. Arya then remembers what the Hound told her in his last moments, and sheaths her dagger, deciding not to give up her life for revenge as he had done. Arya looks at Ceirce and tells her that to live with the fact that her own children are dead because of her. Arya exits, leaving Ceirce in tears.

Ceirce walks into the dungeons of the Red Keep. The camera switches between images of Arya trying to get out of the burning city alive, and of an injured Jaime staggering through the Red Keep. Ceirce and Jaime meet in the dungeons, and their conversation plays out mostly the same as the original, until the end. Ceirce then says how even though she is about to die, shes glad that she wont lose another child. Jaime asks her what shes talking about, Ceirce reveals how she lied about the baby to manipulate Tyrion. Jaime doesnt say a single word, he just turns around and walks away. This is the moment when Ceirce truly breaks down, mirroring Dany. She grabs a sharp piece of rubble and stabs Jaime in the back. Jaime dies in Ceirces arms. Ceirce screams in pain and anguish as the Red Keep collapses on top of her. The rest of episode 5 remains the same. 

Episode 6 again remains mostly the same, a part from a couple small changes. Jons confrontation with Dany remains the same. After Jon stabs Dany, she lies on the ground unmoving with a dagger in her stomach. After Dany takes her last breath, the small part of the blade that is visible burns with flickering tongues of flame. Dragon burning the Iron Throne and flying off with Danys body remains the same. Greyworm and a few Unsullied enter with their swords drawn, having heard Drogons roar. Jon is too sad and devastated to even acknowledge them at first. Greyworm sees the blood on the ground, the looks at Jon, unsure what happened. Jon unsheathes Longclaw, and drops it on the ground. Jon puts his hands up and gets on his knees without even saying a word, his eyes filled with tears. 

The rest of the episode remains that same. If you have read my rewrite of the White Walker plot, youll know that Bran becoming king, could potentially mean that the Night King ended up winning after all. 

The music swells as we see each of the remaining Starks prepare for their new lives. Jon Snow, the Stark Bastard, The White Wolf, the Lord Commander of the Nights Watch, The King in the North, The Targaryen Wolf, The True Heir to the Iron Throne, The Prince that was Promised rides into the sunset, finally free, never looking back.",11,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

She was incredibly boring and none of her storylines were ever interesting. It has nothing to do with her femininity. Cersei, Lady Olenna, and Margaery were all great and compelling characters. In the first six seasons, every character she interacted with infinitely eclipsed her(Arya, Theon, Littlefinger, Tyrion, Lady Olenna, Margery, etc).

In the final two seasons, every character that she interacted with became infinitely worse than they where before (Littlefinger, Arya,Tyrion, Jon, etc.)

Arya and Jon are very intelligent in the book. Jon is even a bit conniving and less honorable than Ned. Book Jon would have never trusted Sansa or gone along with her bullshit. It is also noted that Arya would be better at running a household because she is far better at mathematics than Sansa. Arya even has some intelligent moments early on with Tywin in the show. Yet they became complete dumbasses so Sansa could be the smart one. Even Tyrion and Littlefinger become complete dumbasses in her presence.

Sansas the smartest person I ever met. Why does Arya believe this? Theyve only been reunited for a year at best and half that time was spent fighting with each other. What did Sansa accomplish in the few months that it took for Jon and co. to travel from Dragonstone at the end of season 7 to Winterfell at the beginning of season 8?

All of this was done to make us believe that she was a political genius but there was never any narrative payoff for it. What did she ever accomplish besides killing Littlefinger? Even with that, there was a deleted scene where Bran had to tell Sansa she was being played. She didnt out smart Littlefinger, she used google search.",124,52,False,spoiler,,,,,

Voila! The first-ever ASOIAF story in print. Months before AGOT came out, GRRM packaged all the Daenerys chapters from AGOT into a novella and published it in Asimovs. Very rare and costly. 

I haven't opened it yet but from what I read online Daenerys ""remembers"" she went to *Tyrosh* not Braavos as AGOT states when she was growing up. Something tells me she knows nothing too. 

I did a very big favor for GRRM in the past so I am calling in a favor back from him and mailing this and a bunch of books to sign with birthday presents for his upcoming 71st birthday, Sept 20th.

It is rare for it to be available for sale. There are only two other copies for sale in the world. One on [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Asimovs-Science-Fiction-July-1996-includes-first-A-Game-of-Thrones-story/222175321227?hash=item33baae5c8b:g:ZbQAAOSwzJ5XeQLf) from Belgium for $560US and one on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0017931OK/ref=cfb_at_prodpg) for $750.",4,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

https://youtu.be/09CFGrR5J6s 

Obviously Danys transformation into the Mad Queen didnt exactly hit and something was missing. I couldnt put my finger on it. I think the reason why Danys corruption didnt have to do with Dany but with Cersei instead. 

You see Danys corruption was caused by her enemies and while the video says corruption cant come from other people I disagree. I think other people can make you corrupt in very certain situations. Dany wanted the Iron Throne, the main goal, that is known but she also wanted revenge for killing her dragon and Missandei, the subgoal. Dany wanted revenge on Cersei so badly she was willing to forgo her ideals and moral just to get the satisfaction. 

I think D&amp;D used Dany lighting up Kings Landing as a way to not only show her decent into madness but as a way for Dany to get back at Cersei. However, there lies the problem. Cersei doesnt care about the people, shes never cared about people so why would Dany burning Kings Landing make any difference. That doesnt satisfy the subgoal.


Thats where I would make a change. Dany kills Jamie in front of everyone. Heres my rational. Cersei doesnt care about people, but the one person she does care about is Jamie. Killing Jamie in front of Cersei is the biggest FU Dany could send to Cersei. Not only does that fulfill the goal of enacting revenge on Cersei but it also shows her corruption. Brienne stood up for Jamie when he was being questioned. We along with the other characters know Jamie is a good man so for Dany to kill him for the sake of accomplishing her goal is a perfect example of corruption. 


could change another thing I would want Rhaegal to be at the Kings Landing. If the soldiers see Jamie be killed by Dany it gives them more incentive to fight. Im sure Cersei wouldnt have wanted her soldiers to know their commander abandoned them and left them for the enemy. Rhaegal is then shot by a ballista when Cersei decides to surrender. Dany gets upset and this completes the transformation into the Mad Queen and mass murdering the city. 


Plus it actually subverts expectations.",7,8,False,spoiler,,,,,

I am ONLY comparing the TV show and the anime.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/cijs0d/spoilers_comparing_game_of_thrones_to_attack_on/,trfpol,1564246056,"In 2016, I discovered Game of Thrones when I watched the first episode and was hooked. I watched all the episodes available at the time, read all the books, and impatiently waited for season 7 and 8 to come out. I was drawn in by the intense character development, the moral greyness, and the stark realism. I pretty much lived Game of Thrones, theorizing with my friends and dreaming up the ending. I never wanted it to end.

And then the 7th season came out, and I was a little disappointed. It was intense, and there were some great parts, but overall it felt like it lacked something that had made the previous seasons special. Things were becoming predictable, and therefore major scenes werent as impactful. But I stood by and hoped that season 8 would redeem the series.

It did no such thing. After a good first two episodes that briefly returned to the stark realism aspect that I had loved, the show began to throw in random things. The white walker plot line that had been developed over 7 seasons ended in the blink of an eye, and it felt like Daenerys character arc did a 180. Some aspects were good, and I wouldnt go as far as to say the ending was terrible, but it left be feeling unfulfilled and disappointed. I would never look at GOT the same way again.

Flash forward to June 2019, where I discovered Shingeki no Kyojin based on a recommendation from a friend. I immediately fell in love with the series and devoured the episodes in my spare time. And it just kept getting better and better. The world building was amazing, and the slow reveal of the lore made me scream with anticipation at some points. The entirety of the second half of season 2, where just enough information was released to expand a little bit, made me feel like I was floundering around in the dark. And I loved that feeling.

The character building in season 3 part 1 was expertly done. Going into the backstories of many of the characters was something that added a whole new depth to the series. And, it provided an area for Eren to finally develop as a character, which I felt had been a little bit lacking in the first two seasons. Season 3 part 2 hit me like a bus. The intense action, the critical choices, and the final reveal of what the hell was happening in the world was all done in a way that felt like the series had been building to this entire point.

Shingeki no Kyojin and Game of Thrones both started out with excellent hooks. They both introduced an awesome premise that built over several seasons. But while Game of Thrones lost its focus and momentum at the end and instead left most viewers hating the series, Shingeki no Kyojin kept the momentum and turned up the excitement to 11. Shingeki no Kyojin has filled the void that the end of Game of Thrones left, and it will only continue to excite and amaze.

Game of Thrones was an excellent show at the beginning, but began to decline in its later stages. If the books manage to redeem the series, I might compare them again. However, for something that took up most of my life and imagination for three years, I expected a better turnout.",7,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

Hello. I'm making a chronicle that tells the story of a Pre-Dawn Age prehistoric life before the Children of the Forest. A time when Dinosaurs, Dragons (both Land and Sea), Dire wolves, Mammoths, Saber-toothed Cats and other prehistoric creatures played their own Game of Thrones and ruled their own Seven Kingdoms and Free Cities as well as a time when Gods, like The Seven and The Old Gods of the Forest roamed the world as prehistoric creatures, but I need some help on a few things. First, What would the Continents (Westeros and Essos and Sothoryos) look like (Continental Drift)? How would the prehistoric Game of Thrones be played? How would the climate and seasons affect the animals there? What kind of Dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures would live there? What kind of creatures would the Gods take the form off? How can this get connected to the Dawn Age? and What steps would be necessary to connect it to the Dawn Age and the rest of the Game of Thrones history? I'm basically trying to make a Prehistory Game of Thrones that would most likely to have happened.

I'm actually planning on making two Prehistoric Game of Thrones stories. One during the time of the dinosaurs and one in the Cenozoic era(Eocene period to Ice Age) with giant prehistoric mammals.

I actually made a map of Rytegon (The name of this world that I'm making, which is ""All Land"" in Valyrian) were all that Westeros that is south of The Neck merges to West Essos and all that is north of The Neck bent and merged to North Essos at where The Shivering Sea will be.

I have decided to have Dinosaurs, Pterosaurs and Sea Reptiles to be sentient and as intelligent as humans. Since this is not our earth, I thought it would be fitting to have my Game of Thrones dinosaurs more intelligence and I also thought I would be cool to have them co-exist or at least at the same time as Dragons, Permian period reptiles (who are already facing extinction in this story), as well as a small spot of a swamp,where there are the remnants of the Carboniferous period insects. In both stories, The prehistoric creatures have tools, decorative tattoos, ritual scarification, armor, and all signs of rank, hierarchy and social networks but their technological level is the same as the Homo sapiens and Neanderthal cavemen of the Stone Age. Not with the humans who are the medieval era. Their armor would be made of either hardwood, stone or,most-likely, dinosaur skulls and bones from the fallen and dead with tree vines tieing them up. Their jewelry and accessory wearings like bracelets or crowns would be made of pieces of goldstone, sea shells, flowers, and other natural stuff.

I also decided that each dinosaur family speaks its own language and that when it's dinosaurs from different families talking to each other, they speak a common language. To humans, they would all seem like a series of roars, grunts, and growls. But if we here them as dinos, it would sound like humans talking. The individual-family-language, like for example Raptor language, would sound like a foreign language being spoken by humans. While the common language that all dinosaurs speak would be English to humans. The Wyverns and Wyrms (Dragon precursors) would speak their own language which would make up a small part of making the Valyrian language. The giant insects and spiders of the small Carboniferous period swamp would speak only their own language, which would be a combination, to us, as foreign human language and insect and spider sounds like chirping and buzzing.

I also decided to have it that their are some kingdoms or houses that are ruled by meat eaters, some, plant eaters and that there is a balance on how much prey is killed, killing is only permitted for eating and not for sport, and that predators and not constantly killed my plant eaters like Stegos and Ceratops'.

I also decided to have major key-point locations in my world and reveal that this location would eventually become the iconic places we see in Game of Thrones (King's Landing, Winterfell, Meereen) and to have my actual cities and settlements be made of natural stuff like earth and wood and be built around, in, or on natural habitats like a forest or a mountain range. So, to us, it would be just a forest or mountain range but really, it's a city.

As you can see, Ive certainly done my homework on this but I need help on which Dinosaurs should I put into this? How many? How would the predator/prey relationship work like? What could be some gods or religions that might evolve into the Old Gods of the Forest and the Seven?

Im making it that there are elements in this that would eventually evolve into some of the elements we know in the human Game of Thrones.

The badass heroine that is somehow smart, an assassin and can dish out punches like no one else all the while drinking beer or what have you. Fuck that noise. 

Wearing a skirt doesnt make you not a feminist. Being a housewife doesnt make not you a feminist. Not knowing how to fight doesnt make you not a feminist. Wearing pink and floral outfits doesnt make you not a feminist. Believing in equality between the sexes is the true essence of feminism. Anything else is bullshit. It was so refreshing to see GTO women in dresses and skirts and just being their badass self, to see them destroy cities and kingdoms, to being down kings and lords to their knees.

I would consider myself a pretty big fan of Game of Thrones.  Started reading the books, have one left.  Have a couple of t-shirts and a Funko Pop or two.   Needless to say, I was both excited and nervous for the final season.  In following the show for six years (started around season 3, but I went back and marathonned the first two) I had an emotional connection to the show.  

Honestly, Id kinda started to feel a little funny around season five, after the peak of season four with all of its radical changes.  I agreed with the criticisms people had for season six.  So I was a little anxious going into this season, but the first two episodes were really good, I thought!  But the third episode, honestly, just kinda killed my enthusiasm.  I decided to take a break.  That turned into Ill just wait for the whole thing to finish then just marathon it at once.  Then *that* turned into wow, the general reaction Im hearing is that people *hated* the last season.  Seth Rogen made a comment about it, theres a petition going around, the actors are upset... Im kinda having a tough summer, maybe I should just cut out now while I still have some good memories of it.

Ive actually had one major thing spoiled for me (in an Arrested Development sub no less) but all in all Ive stayed spoiler free for the rest of it.  I know I cant stay unspoiled forever, but Im questioning whether its better to quit while Im ahead, or just see just what exactly is so allegedly shitty.  I know tastes can differ (Nickelback has sold a lot of records to millions of people) but I just think its really unlikely that all these people are upset just because theyre haters.",0,1,False,self,,,,,

I know it might be a bit late but whatever, thanks to a I bet you cant come up with a better GoT season 8 plot I will give you this:

All would stay mainly the same until the battle of Winterfell, in which I would change the stupid strategy of sending all the Dothraki cavalry to death in the first 10 minutes to a proper defense strategy, catapults firing from the rear, infantry in a shield wall behind the palisades and the cavalry ready in the flanks. However, the northerners and the Unsullied lose the battle of Winterfell and they have to retreat, both Drogon and Rhaegal are still alive but injured and the Night King keeps Viserion.

Cersei gets word of the northern army retreating from he north and decides to send the Golden Company to finish them and take out at least one of the main threats to her position, but the Lannister army remains in Kings Landing as garrison, to protect the city and prepare it for a siege for when the Night King or the northerners arrive (if someone arrives).

The Golden Company and the Northern Army meet each other at a location that can be discussed, maybe Highgarden, Riverrun, Harrenhaldoesnt affect the plot that much. They prepare for battle. Shortly after the first skirmishes, an icy wind alerts everyone of the arrival of the Night King, and the Northern Army and the Golden Company have to stop killing each other and join forces to face the Wights. In this epic battle, Drogon and Rhaegal fight to death with Viserion and the Night King, Viserion kills Rhaegal, but Drogon kills Viserion and survives, (eliminating the stupid killing of Rhaegal at the hands of the Iron fleet) and the battle ends with the victory of the Northern Army and the Golden Company (Arya should kill the Night King in this version as well maybe with the help of Jaqen Hghar).

After this victory, the Golden Company and the Northern Army enter parley, and the Golden Company finds out about the identity of both Daenerys and Jon when Dany asks them to bend the knee and swear fealty to herself as queen, then after some deliberation (and why not, maybe some stabbing), the Golden Company decide to switch sides and follow the Targaryen blood (their founders bloodline) and all march to Kings Landing to overthrow Cersei.

Cersei needs the help of the Iron Fleet to keep the peace in Kings Landing, especially after the arrival of Daenerys and her new allies, and approximately half of the ships of the Iron Fleet rest unmanned, making it easier (and more plausible) for Drogon and the remnants of the northern fleet (plus some minor houses ships) to lay waste to the Iron Fleet during the attack on Kings Landing. An attempt to discuss terms of surrender end up with an ambush by Cersei's orders and the capturing and death of Missandei. From here everything could follow the same path, the bells, the rage of Daenerys, the burning of Kings Landing, Cleganebowl, the Queen of Ashes, and the feeling by the main characters left that Dany should not be queen.

We get to the scene where Jon stabs Daenerys but right before this happens she reveals that she is pregnant so Jon refrains from killing her, even though his mind is already set on that thought. Daenerys, convinced by her advisors, focuses on rebuilding the realm, her fleet and her armies before carrying out the conquering of the rest of the world that she promises in her speech. She also wants to take it easy with a complicated pregnancy, remembering the words of the witch Mirri Maz Duur. She finally gives birth (boy or girl, whatever) but she has a complicated delivery, so instead of giving her milk of the poppy to ease her pain, Jon gives her poison (or an overdose of milk of the poppy if you prefer) to end her life and save the realm.

With all the guilt and grief, Jon refuses to become king, he chooses to go north beyond the wall, appointing Bran as regent until his newborn comes of age, and Tyrion and Sam are appointed as teachers and counselors of the Prince/Princess (result of the ice and fire) to prepare him or her to rule. All the other charachters can follow their life as described in the original plot.",18,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

She is actually quite proud of her brother , when she tells ned that her brother is worth  a 1000 of his friend

She knows Jaime would do anything for her and while most of you think jaime is an idiot bieng a puppet doing all sorts of dirty work for cersie just for some head , He could have had any fuckin body in the 7 kingdoms not even exaggerating but he must have truly and deeply loved his sister to do so ( i am 100% sure he would do for cersie even if she didnt give him any sex)

remmber the line jaime would have gone to war with him if he found out : that tells you something about it

&amp;#x200B;

I can go on and on but the thing is no love in the show was perfect and given the conditions it could never have been

I mean stannis fucking burned his daughter and ned lost his life and that of his wife , Cersie had to do all sorts of dirty things to survive that doesnt make her a bad person to me just smart and while thier relationship was toxic at times just remmber the last scene

"" I dont wanna die jaime"" she shows her vulnerablility here , the only time you will see the lioness sobbing like an infant , and he is the only person who ever gets to see that side of her , i mean he always has from ever since they were lil children right , cersie built a wall around allowing no one but jaime in

""shhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"" he doesnt want to suffer anymore and doesnt want to see her suffer anymore and leaves this world in the arms of the woman he loves

They came in this world together they left the world together and are reunited forever for eternity as one

Jaime and Cersie forever

* Pissed at the ending of the show? Want a helpful push to get started with the books?
* Do you want to experience ""A Game of Thrones"" yet again, but lack the attention span to force your eyeballs across a page for more than a few minutes at a time without social contact?
* Do you have a friend who is completely new to the series you'd like to bring along to experience their first reactions to certain... shocking events as they read along with us?

If any of those answers is ""yes,"" you might be interested in our new book club! **""The Secret Fire Book Club""** will be reading ""A Game of Thrones"" in group read sessions, then discuss what we've read every day at 7:30 PM EST, excluding Sundays. Spoilers in non-spoiler channels are prohibited, but during discussions you can give vague hints to thematic (rather than plot) significance to get the ball rolling on interpreting what we just read.

You should have a copy of the book ready with you before the group read sessions. Participation is encouraged, but you don't have to read. Regardless, it's helpful to have the text in case someone has a thick accent or connection issues.

We'll be posting the current chapter and bookmark location after every session in a special channel. **There are no obligations**. Just show up when you want to show up, then catch up on your own time! But we'd love to have you here. We might move on to other books (in this series or others) based on demand once AGOT is finished; feel free to offer suggestions if you join.

I know he was a fan favorite for many even pripr to the show but I found him generally boring and did not care much about hos fate except for how it affected Tyrion. However, Pedro Pascal dripped charisma and made me love the character.

Similarly, Varys was mildly annoying in the books and bland when not irking me. However Conleth Hill brought that suave intrigue to the character that I felt GRRM never did.

Iain Glen as Jorah Mormont and Natalie Dormer as Margaery Tyrell are two others I like in the show but am indifferent to in the books but I think that has a lot more to do with the increased prominence of each in the adaptation 

All that said, the person who fundamentally changed my entire opinion on a character -- bringing them from someone I despised to someone I actually sympathized with and felt genuine feelings for -- was Alfie Allen as Theon Greyjoy. Even in ADWD, I had no feelings for Reek. I did not take pleasure in what Ramsay did and was doing to him, but wasn't very moved either. From his rape of the captain's daughter en route to Pyke up through his sacking of Winterfell, he fell further and further from my already dim view of him but Alfie brought such pathos and pity to the character that Ramsay forcing him to watch him rape Sansa was probably one of the most gut wrenching moments of the show to me. Truly a magnificent portrayal.",17,13,False,spoiler,,,,,
