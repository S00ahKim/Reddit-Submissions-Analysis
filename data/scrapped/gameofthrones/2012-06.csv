Well, now the new layout has been implemented. 

Click around and let us know what you like and don't like.

If you find any of the following, please let us know:

- Bugs
- Features not functioning properly (spoiler tags and the like)
- Broken links
- Loading issues


**Known Issues:**

- Night Mode isn't working quite right. Kj wants to polish it up a bit more before he throws that feature out.
- RES tweaks are coming up
- built-in Night Mode support is coming
- built-in Mobile Mode is coming

    The mouse-over effect is not that mobile-compatible, that's also why the mobile mode is coming 

**Reported Bugs**:

- Clicking ""My Subreddits"" covers the FAQ and Episode Discussions buttons.
- The upvote counter and RES tagging icons show up on the far right of the post on the subreddit home page.
- [Image here](http://i.imgur.com/PFK9f.png) shows slight formatting bugs including side-bar blocking.
- Format ends at [bottom of the page](http://i.imgur.com/KcfdP.png) makes Reddit UI hard to read.
- View images (Tyrell Banner) is only visible within posts, not on the subreddit home page.
- Spoiler tag examples do not clearly indicate which color is for which purpose

You may notice a few added features. On the side-bar there are now filters for mod-posted spoiler flair as well as ""Show all spoilers"" and other really fun tweaks listed under ""Theme Modes""

You might also notice the presence of the ""GRRM Network""

This is a list of all the Subreddits related to GRRM's works who have yet decided to join the network. We expect a few more will be jumping in soon, but that's the list for now.

5. 
Shae: Some of those boys will never come back.
Sansa: Joffrey will. The worst ones always live.

4.
Those are brave men knocking at our door-let's go kill them!
- Tyrion 

3. Fuck the Kings-guard, fuck the city, fuck the King.""

2. ...Thousands... (epic music) Come with me and take this city!

1. If any man dies with a clean sword, I'll rape his fucking corpse!

SCENES
5. ""Stannis's Charge"" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wppAdZEqJA4

First one on the shore, first one over the wall. I chose this scene over the Queen's amazing scene because it is just so epic. The look in his eyes as he steps ashore - such determination. He's absorbing the gravity of the situation, his golden prize finally in his sight, sword in hand, dashing towards his throne. His face tells all. And you get to see how good of a battle leader he is, aswell as how good of a fighter the Hound is. Also... ""If any man dies with a clean sword, I'll rape his fucking corpse!""

4. ""Bronn v. The Hound"" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkQYxnGq564
(Sorry for the shitty quality) So much tension! Even in the face of the Hound Bronn proves that he truly is a hard man, ready to kill the Hound if need be. ""Your imp is going to miss you"" ""I suppose he will, one day""

3. ""The Hound"" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yP0CyvcKfs
This scene added so much to the Hounds character, and I believe the first part of it is so overlooked. You see some terror in the Hound's eyes when the dragonfire explodes, but here you really see how utterly afraid of fire he is, and how this fear brings out his true character. He stops killing, his favorite thing, and abandons the battle, the city, and the king. ""Fuck the King.""

2. ""Dragonfire"" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuNyWMAWptE
Personal favorite part of this is when Bronn sees the signal, lights the arrow, takes the shot, and the music cuts. It all starts to click and your just like ""holy shit, this can't be about to happen."" Also with the captain fucking freaking out realizing whats about to happen, look on his face of sheer terror. And then everyone's reaction as it explodes, so epic.

And then ofcourse Stanis. New favorite character. ""Come with me and take this city!"" Completely unphased by the dragonfire ""The dwarf has played his trick, he can only play it once."" First to land ashore, first over the wall. A true leader and total badass.

1. ""DRUMS!"" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4kNneOct6A
I chose this as #1 because no other scene made my heart beat so fast and got me so pumped. The dragonfire scene filled me with complete awe but this part was just so... I don't even. I was never so excited to be watching GoT as I was when this dudes fucking head starts bobbing left and right as he's beating these drums.

Edit: for some reason the numbering is all fucked up. The lines/scenes nearest the top of the page should be the number 5, and then descending down to 1 as you make your way down the page. aka the #1 line is the Hounds, and the #1 scene is DRUMS!",21,7,False,self,,,,,

And secondly, Robb is in the south, all the weirwoods have been destroyed there (osha told bran this when he asked if the old gods would protect Robb down south) is this why he has not been shown as a warg? or does he just not have the power?

**TL;DR: Stay a non-reader, but learn facts about the events so you're on par with readers! Not interested? UPVOTE FOR WILDFIRE** or I'll be angry if this piece of actual content gets buried under the bloody meme posts.

**The Fan Has Been Hit With The Glorious Shit**
&gt; ""Fuck me""
&gt;  - everybody, viewers included

For the first time we got an episode completely focused on one location. It's not a deviation from the book, though, as the Battle of the Blackwater has been described in six subsequent PoV chapters of Sansa, Tyrion and Davos - and that's how I'm gonna organize this post (so far I've been splitting by location).

**The Hero Stannis Deserves, The Onion Knight**

&gt; ""Come with me and take the city!""
&gt;  - Stannis the Mannis, not giving a fuck, ever

Some general badassery and still the Stag, despite the swag, did not get frag. I think that one was quite obvious to begin with: two major somewhat boring characters versus shitload of interesting ones, both trying to kill each other. Stannis obliterating Lannisters would be the series finale so it just couldn't happen. Even Game of Thrones has some rules about storytelling.

* Davos had seven sons, two of them being captains (burned), two other also present at Blackwater Bay (first mate, oarsmaster, both dead), one left at Dragonstone (Stannis's squire) and two left home with his wife (also alive). They were never that much  important, so I guess the one we've seen is the only one we'll see in the show.

* Melisandre said previously to Matthos: **""Death by fire is the purest death"".** Creepy. Reminder: Melisandre is a *shadowbinder from Asshai*, just like Quaithe (the masked woman in Qarth). How Quaithe ""sees"" things is unclear, but we know Melisandre watches the flames and ""sees things"" there. It's a red priest thing to stare into fire.

* **WILDFIRE.** The pyromancers have mentioned that the production has exceeded their expectations lately and they don't know the reason. Readers do: dragons. Since their return, red priests tend to have real mojo up in their sleeve and crazy alchemists brew shenaningans more efficiently. Which suggests that wildfire isn't all science.

* Do you remember the hill tribe people that Tyrion brought to King's Landing? They went into the woods to kill all the scouts and backup forces. Not that important for the show.

* And the unlucky pirate who didn't fuck the queen: All the lords wanted to be in front to take the glory and prove themselves to Stannis (most of them served Renly, I remind), so this nice guy has been left behind to prevent any sneak attacks of hidden fleet. Lucky him.

* Stannis does not have a death wish (climbing up ladder first without a helmet was quite foolish), he commanded from a safe place on land. But this way we could see what a man he truly is, especially in comparison to his ""nephew"". Oh, and with Davos down and Stannis just commanding it would be Tyrion vs the Extras, which would put all our sympathy to the side standing between Joffrey and justice.

* Up to the moment Tywin Lannister showed up, Stannis still had an overwhelming advantage. Actually, he could possibly win with Tywin's force. However, Tyrell forces are the most powerful in all of Westeros, exceeding even the Lannisters in count. **Loras and Margaery (or, to be precise, Littlefinger) is the cause Stannis lost.**

* More clear about the Tyrells: so far they didn't have that much power on the court because they fought against king Robert in his rebellion. Lord Tyrell was the one who had been siegeing Stannis at Storm's End. After Stark-Baratheon-Arryn-Tully alliance crushed Targeryans and Ned broke the siege, Tyrells and their lords were pardoned, but it was Lannisters and Jon Arryn who gained power at the court, Tyrells left aside. What we see now is their comeback to big politics.

**Quarter-Man, Leaking Down To Let's Say Three-Eights**

&gt; *""Horror: a dead king, a city under siege...""* ""A wedding""
&gt;  - Tyrion Lannister, funny as always

There are some things I can't tell you. Just like with Daenerys going into hot tub in the pilot, there are some subtle foreshadowing scenes that readers will catch and flood the front page with. I'm sorry. It's not going to stop. Ignorance is bliss. If you treat those ""hints"" too seriously, you're gonna have a hard time with some fake ones people put here. Gosh, even the show creators do. They filmed a scene for this season where one of characters dies and the actor just played it thinking it's for real (keep in mind I might be trolling as I speak about that character's life, but this is legit from an interview). And since the show starts to differ from the books in some major events, even those actors who have read the books fall for these kind of pranks.

* The song that Bronn sings is called **""The Rains of Castamere""** and **for the love of God, DO NOT GOOGLE it** because of major spoilers that it is linked to. It's a song about the most famous victory of Tywin Lannister when he wiped out two houses that rebelled against Lannisters, bringing the lions back to glory (Tywin's father was a weak man). It basically says ""There was once a moron who dared to oppose us. All that's left of him is a pile of rubble"".

* Varys tells the full story in the book, but out of context that's been skipped in this season (Melisandre draws power from the king's blood, blood=magic trope in general) it would be confusing. I'm not sure if we will hear it in the show, judging by the book 3 split I think season 3 will go back to this topic. I think it's safe to read it now, though: [ACOK](/b ""Varys was cut when he was a small boy by a mysterious man, probably by a red priest. His manhood was thrown into the fire and the man who cut Varys spoke to the flames in some unknown language. Flames spoke back."") Anyway,**Varys knows red priest mojo is very very real by his own experience and fears it** as any sane man should.

* **WILDFIRE II.** One thing that the readers used to whine about: **""The chain""**. How battle looked in the books: Tyrion actually sent most of the royal fleet to fight, which was doomed to lose, and then raised a badass mofo chain to cut the way out for Baratheon fleet and then, burned the river down. The whole river was on fire all night. Wrecked ships have attached to the chain and made a huge bridge. You get why it didn't make it to the show, don't you?

* **Episode 9 time! You loved the guy? THAT'S ADORABLE.** Of course in comparison to Ned, Tyrion's chances of making it into next season are way better (as in above ""beheaded"" and below ""stabbed""). The guy that delivered the WTF moment was ser Mandon Moore, called by Jamie way earlier (book) the most dangerous Kingsguard of them all because his face never gave away his thoughts. Why did he do this? Well, he had nothing personal against Tyrion himself. Go figure.

* Podrick Payne, the boy who saved the day, is a distant relative of Ser Illyn Payne. Oh yeah, that's right: the guy who beheaded the season 1 protagonist just got a little tiny bit more likeable.

* One of the riders that came to the rescue of King's Landing was wearing a helmet with antlers. This was Renly's armor and so-called ""Ghost of Renly"" broke morale in Baratheon troops. In the books the man wearing it is Loras's brother (for Loras wasn't big enough), here it's Loras.

**The Little Bird**

&gt; ""The worst ones always live""
&gt;  - Sansa, delivering the best meta quote so far

Indoor scenes were the least expensive ones, but nevertheless they managed to be almost as intanse as the battle. If it wasn't for the enhanced budget, this is how the episode would look like. And it would still kick ass.

* Notice how Cersei wear a breastplate on her dress. Unusual view as in most movies/games female wearing an armor gets her dress cut to tiny little skirt barely covering anything.

* The Hound is afraid of fire because of how he got the scar (The Mountain scorched his face when they were little boys). In the show, Littlefinger told Sansa that story at the tournament, in the books Sandor did it himself, threatening to kill Sansa if she tells it to anyone.

* Tommen wasn't present at King's Landing, sent away somewhere safe in case Joffrey dies. Having Tommen dead in the siege along with Joffrey would leave the only Lannister heir in the hands of Martells of Dorne.

* There's some tinfoil hat theory SanSan shippers work on involving how Sansa recalls her goodbye to the Hound. GRRM comments this as ""unreliable narrator"", suggesting we can't trust Sansa's thoughts in her own chapters. Anyway, before he left, Sandor asked Sansa to sing him a song (""pretty little bird singing her songs"") and that's the moment in the books she chants the hymn to the Mother.

* For the second time in this episode an interesting story got interrupted. Lucky for Tyrion, Cersei was drunk enough to miss the opportunity to find her brother's lover. Totally not happening in the book, so I can't elaborate on what story Shae could come up with. Tyrion wouldn't be so careless to put Shae so close to Cersei, in the books she's a handmaiden to some minor lady. Tieing Shae and Sansa together is much better solution in means of character development, though.

* **Notice the juggler** and try to find out who he is. [Answer:](/s ""The drunken knight from the very first scene in this season whose life Sansa got spared."")

What are your suggestions for other similar shows and movies to watch in the meantime?

My recommendations

* Rome ([Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome_\(TV_series\))) - Also from HBO. Only 2 seasons were made unfortunately. It doesn't seem to have had the same special effects budget as Game of Thrones but it has a similar overall feeling to the show. 
* Black Death ([Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death_\(film\))) - 2010 historical adventure horror film. A bit darker and gorier than Game of Thrones for sure but it also stars Sean Bean (Ned) and Carice van Houten (Melisandre) and I think it would also appeal to a lot of Game of Thrones fans.

First off, 
Catelyn, ASOS
""Lord Hosters eyes opened. Tansy, he husked in a voice thick with pain.
He does not know me. Catelyn had grown accustomed to him taking her for her mother or her sister Lysa, but Tansy was a name strange to her. Its Catelyn, she said. Its Cat, Father. Forgive me... the blood... oh, please... Tansy... Could there have been another woman in her fathers life? Some village maiden he had wronged when he was young, perhaps? Could he have found comfort in some serving wenchs arms after Mother died? It was a queer thought, unsettling. Suddenly she felt as though she had not known her father at all. Who is Tansy, my lord? Do you want me to send for her, Father? Where would I find the woman? Does she still live?
Lord Hoster groaned. Dead. His hand groped for hers. Youll have others... sweet babes, and trueborn. Others? Catelyn thought. Has he forgotten that Ned is gone? Is he still talking to Tansy, or is it me now, or Lysa, or Mother? When he coughed, the sputum came up bloody. He clutched her fingers
... be a good wife and the gods will bless you... sons... trueborn sons... aaahhh. The sudden spasm of pain made Lord Hosters hand tighten. His nails dug into her hand, and he gave a muffled scream.""
Catelyn continues to ponder who this Tansy might be, and why her name is so important to her dying father (who has constantly confused Cat with her mother and sister). 

--&gt;in this reference, the important part, is the Trueborn son. From this qoute it would seem, and most readers would agree, that Hoster is talking about Lysa. Many have commented on saying that this could be the aborted child of her and LF.
It is important to note that all the information that leads to that conclusion is from Cat's POV.
but what if there really is a Tansy and Hoster had met her before.
such as in  arya V.
the beginning of the chapter starts out with a description of the battle of the bells. in which, we learn that King Robert was wounded, and Ned and Arya's grandfather rushed to the Stony Sept to save him.
That grandfather of course being Hoster, cause... well.. the other one was dead.
in the town of Stony Sept we meet Tansy, a ""buxom red-haired innkeep howled with pleasure at the sight of them...""
for one, she isnt an innkeep she runs the whorehouse, two her name is Tansy.

so here is the deal. Where would King Robert most likely hang out during the wounded hiding phase of the battle of the bells? Prob, the whorehouse, which we know he did because of the quote in the same chapter by Belle, who is prob a bastard born of Robert.

this is where Hoster meets, Tansy, who runs the whorehouse and is prob very knowledgeable in the arts of abortion or better yet a midwife. SO what if, when he thinks Cat is Tansy, it is not some nickname for Lysa, but he really means Tansy. In his delusions, he is speaking to both Lysa and Tansy. But what if the Lysa had a still born instead of an abortion. From the lines in the Cat chapter, Hoster talks about of the blood, and then he says dead, which i assume means the child.
One we know that Lysa has had plenty of miscarriages, so one more isnt that far from the realm of possibility. Next, since the name Hoster says is Tansy, and there is Tansy Tea, Cat assumes he is talking about  an abortion. 
But in the quote Hoster doesn't sound like a father who is forcing his daughter to have an abortion. He sounds like he is in shock over the amount of blood, and is trying to console his daughter. 
Considering this and the other references to Tansy Tea, throughout the books, the one that pops into my mind is from Ygritte, who didnt make it sound like that big of a deal. (Granted she is a wildling...) it seems relatively safe, and no where does there seem to be a bloody side effect like the one Hoster is describing. 

So either, Tansy is the midwife of a miscarrage, like i now think, or she was the one that gave the Tea to Lysa for the abortion, but i do think that when Hoster is talking, he is talking to this particular lady, whom he would have known.

so yeah... i don't think its an abortion anymore.",6,1,False,self,,,,,

For me, it really just came out of nowhere and it feels really jarring and unnecessary. Am I in the wrong here? ",11,0,False,default,,,,,

And who are you, the proud lord said, that I must bow so low. Only a cat of a different coat, that's all the truth I know.

In a coat of gold, or a coat of red, a lion still has claws. And mine are long and sharp my lord, as long and sharp as yours.

Given that the monthly HBO subscription fee is about $15 (at least with my cable provider), I'd pay $2 to $3 per episode in lieu of the monthly subscription without blinking.

I ask because I'm starting to wonder if there really is a market for on demand TV shows if they could be as great as GoT.  I know HBO has said they have no desire to go this route, but I started thinking about the numbers.

The season 1 budget was [reportedly between $50 and $60 million](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/game-thrones-by-numbers-178659), and the weekly (subscribed) viewership [is about 3 million for each new episode's premier, and about 10 million per episode overall.](http://insidetv.ew.com/2012/05/30/game-of-thrones-ratings-blackwater/)  At $2 per episode, that's between $6 and $20 million per episode.  And, of course, that's based only on viewers currently subscripted to HBO.  [Mashable reports that there's potentially 25 million people paying the iron price per episode.](http://mashable.com/2012/05/12/game-of-thrones-pirated/)  Who knows what the true value of each episode might be?

I get that HBO makes money from subscriptions and licensing, and so perhaps it doesn't make sense for them to let people pay for their shows  la carte, but then again GoT is so popular -- I'm beginning to think HBO might make more money (or at least extra money) by allowing the public to stream per episode.  Surely someone at HBO has done the research on this and published a memo . . . but perhaps not.

So, anyway, how much would you pay per episode to watch if you weren't interested in subscribing to HBO?

I chose to start as Robert Baratheon at the beginning of Robert's Rebellion.

I was able to siege King's Landing and force Aerys to surrender. I imprisoned him and got Lyanna Stark back.

So now, 15 years later, I have Robert ruling the Seven Kingdoms. Tywin Lannister died, leaving Tyrion in charge of Casterly Rock and serving as my Master of Whispers. Oh, and Tyrion is married to Asha Greyjoy strangely enough.

I've just betrothed my first born - Edric Baratheon - to Sansa Stark.

Oh, and strangely the High Septon decided I wasn't pious enough and revolted against me. He's dead now.

So yeah, it's sort of an alternate Westeros simulator.

Ill tell you:

Nothing. Thats right, I expect them to be nothing because The Others are fear. They are around you, you can hear them, even FEEL them. Your skin prickles in their presence before your eyes ever see a wisp of their form. They are what every child knows is under their bed when your parents close the door at night. They are the flash of movement you catch in your peripheral vision in a dark basement. The Others are the smallest crack of a twig behind you when you are lost in the forest. You know they are there, they are probably all around you, they MIGHT be right next to you, but you can never quite pin them down until your doom is upon you. 

So how would I rather see them portrayed? Join me in envisioning yourself as a man of the Nights Watch

""Its dark. That haunting third echo still reverberates in your mind. There are screams and the sound of clashing swords. You see flashes of movement out of the corner of your eye, but they disappear as fast as your head can turn. Where is everyone else? Why do the yells sound more distant? The biting cold air begins to howl ever louder. Your mind adjusts and tries to filter it out, as a deafening silence seems to envelop you. How can one's heartbeat be so loud? As it beats louder your hope fades that much quicker. Your sweating skin, your weakening hands, your shaking legs. They all know already what your eyes do not, and in that moment you see a pair of blue eyes that mean to herald your doom.""

**The Others are wonderfully done by Martin, because GRRM understood that when dealing with fear, less is more. That or I guess we can have a elderly Uruk Hai sitting bare back in broad daylight, yelling. Either or...**

EDIT: It should be known that I love the show, honestly I do. Im not one of those book reading 100 percenters, who if someone doesnt take a piss as the book described, I throw a fit over it. I merely think that the show missed the boat on this one, but I realize they may have constraints I dont realize

(Spoilers: All Books and TV Episodes),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/ujnhs/what_are_the_craziest_theories_youve_heard/,mipongelsmoking,1338781998,"I have to admit I thought I had heard most everything. Then, I came across the theory that Varys is a merman. It's such a crackpot theory, but it is hilarious. Is there anything out there that can top this? Here is the ""evidence"" for the theory.


* 1. When Arya is stalking Varys and Illyrio:
* 1a. She hears water dripping in the distance.
* 1b. Next she observes Illyrio and Varys coming up from a vast 'well'(this is the word GRRM uses) that goes down out of sight.
* 1c. Varys pulls a lever and a wall descends blocking the well from sight.
* 1d. After the two come up, Arya trails them for quite a long distance, gradually descending.
* 1e. Finally she loses them, stumbles forward and finds herself at the end of a sewer emptying into the river. She dives in and swims for a while to get clean, washes her clothes, then scampers off home.
* 2. Varys and Illyrio are both noted for their abnormally large size, while also noted as being incredibly light on their feet. This suggests an abnormal strength.
* 3. Varys is noted to have a peculiar, slimy smile. This could be interpreted to mean he does not show his teeth, and that could be because he has very abnormal teeth.
* 4. When Tyrion threatened to throw Varys overboard, Varys retorted that he would be sursprised at the result.
* 5. There is noted to be no bed in Vary's quarters. If he is a Merling he would likely sleep at sea or like most fish perhaps not at all.
* 6a. Another character we know with peculiar teeth is Biter, another abnormally large man with enourmous strength.
* 6b. The idea that this barely sentient being sat around and filed all his teeth just to scare people is absurd.
* 7. Varys and Illyrio both associate humans with birds, naturally as these are two lower species to them. Explains the ease with which they chop off children's tongues.
* 8. From their one meeting, it appears that the Merlings are experts at manipulating the humans in secret. And also there is a hint these two have plenty of patience, they seem to be comfortable waiting years for their plans to bear fruit. Perhaps they have very long lifespans or are just more patient than humans.
* 9. When the subject of eating people came up, Varys licked his lips.
* 10a. Varys likely is not a Eunuch, as there is a point where he is parlaying with Tyrion where Tyrion notes that his voice seemed deeper than usual.
* 10b. Even if he is a Eunuch, it doesn't mean he has to be human.
* 12. Since he probably isn't a Eunuch, Vary's lack of sexual interest in human females is explained by being a Merling.
* 13. Littlefinger comes from a seafaring merchant family of Braavos and is an accomplished sailor himself, if anyone is likely to ever see the reclusive Merlings, it's the merchants and fisherman.
* 14. One of Littlefinger's ships is named 'The Merling King'.
* 15. Littlefinger claims to have Varys completely under his control.
* 16. House Manderly. Hugely fat, port city, can't ride a horse, they even have a Merling as their house crest. Wyman Manderly bakes Freys into pies.
* 17. With no readily apparent motivation, Ser Mandon Moore tried to murder Tyrion on the Blackwater. When thrown overboard, it is noted he did not scream.
* 18. Mandon Moore is referred to repeatedly as having dead eyes or fish eyes, and of having ""no life but duty"".
* 19. Before being attacked, Tyrion had just set Blackwater Bay on fire using wildfire which would be deadly to any creatures living underneath.
* 20. The Drowned God. Very handy to have a large group of humans willing to do anything for you, and it provides a ready source of spies in places of power, such as Patchface, who often tells riddles about life under the sea.
* 21. There is something more to Patchface, as he foretold the Red Wedding.
* 22. Doesn't it seem suspicious that Euron Greyjoy was so well prepared for the Kingsmoot? Almost as though he knew that this ancient ritual for selecting a ruler would resurrected -- almost as if it was done specifically for him. Perhaps Euron has been playing his brother Aeron for a fool by filling his head with ""voices from the sea"".
* 23. Davos Seaworth's visit from the ""The Mother"" may have actually been a siren or a mermaid. After his rescue, Davos was primed and determined to kill Melisandre. Like Aeron and Patchface, it seems Davos's drowning may have filled his head with ideas.
* 24. Melisandre is afraid of Patchface.
* 25. Brienne is told about 'squishers' by one of her companions. They are described as man eating fish people that walk on two feet.
* 26. If you were to give a baby the name Varys in our world today, it would mean the following: Varys - Vari - Stream; Varish - Sleeping on the Sea
* 27. ""The storms come and go, the waves crash overhead, the big fish eat the little fish, and I keep on paddling.""
* 28. What do Varys and Illyrio want with Dragons? This is more speculative, but consider that:
* 28a. When you bring Ice and Fire together, you get water.
* 28b. Is it as simple as this? Bring the dragons north and melt the Ice, including perhaps the entire Wall. What you have done then is raise the coastlines around the entire world. Magical global melting...
What do the merlings get out of it? Liebensraum. More ocean real estate.
* 28c. If the flooding were extreme enough, only a few islands would remain, places like the Eyrie.
* 28d. Littlefinger, ""The Merling King"", has made his seat the Eyrie.
* 28e. If this theory is correct, Littlefinger would have been made King by Merlings, giving a new take on the meaning to the ship's name. ",31,20,False,self,,,,,

- What books should I read and in what order as to follow the show as closely as possible?

- Where should I stop in order to not spoil any of the third season for myself?

- Is there any other advice you feel like I need to hear before embarking on this journey?

IMO they should've just shown a couple of quick flashes of some shadows in the dark. But I guess a giant horde of wights led by CGI-white walkers was much more showy for TV-only fans.

(All spoilers),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/uk223/does_season_2_finale_foreshadow_how_asoiaf_will/,TMWNN,1338809930,"I suspect every fan of A Song of Ice and Fire has joked at least once that the series will end with everyone and everything destroyed. Martin has referenced this idea himself, joking that the last book will be nothing but a thousand pages of descriptions of a sea of graves.

I don't want to overstate Martin's influence on the TV series; Weiss, Benioff, and HBO have 100% authority over the show's direction, not Martin. His title of executive producer is a fancy way of saying that he gets to write one episode a year and serves as a walking, talking reference desk for show writers' questions. That said, they do ask him for guidelines on how to foreshadow future events, especially in the as-yet-unwritten books, and it is known that Weiss and Benioff have a basic idea of how the books are to end.
Given the above, Dany's visit to the House of the Undying in the season 2 finale may indeed be foreshadowing how the books and show will end: Some form of lasting winter, presumably accompanied/caused by the Others/White Walkers, having destroyed all life on Westeros.

Yes, perhaps the vision only shows a moment in the war before the forces of humanity rally from their bases in Dorne and force the ice zombies back up north, but perhaps not. Martin has intentionally broken every single trope of fiction writing, whether fantasy-related or not, since *A Game of Thrones*; why not finish by breaking the most sacred of all, a happy ending?

PS:

**Fire and Ice**

Some say the world will end in fire,

Some say in ice.

From what I've tasted of desire

I hold with those who favor fire.

But if it had to perish twice,

I think I know enough of hate

To say that for destruction ice

Is also great

And would suffice.

I haven't read the books (I plan too though), but considering AGoT is 807 Pages long and ACoK is 969 Pages long I feel like they could have made a lot more episodes making this TV Series a hell of a lot more epic than it already is. 

I imagine there is a lot they have left out, which is in the books (unless they haven't left out much at all and managed to cram each book into 10 episodes). But, why is it they haven't made more episodes for each season? Or have they managed to get most of what happens in the books with what they've made so far?

It's hard for me to look up all the names, so I apologize for my layman descriptions of each character.

The captive Night Watch guy says to the other captive something about ""You know what needs to be done"" and then goes apeshit and gets himself killed in a duel with him. I don't get that. If it was an escape attempt, it was kinda lousy. What's the motive? Or will it be explained later?

Who the hell burned down Winterfell? I thought the 20 bad guys inside were surrounded by 500 good guys outside, and that they just packed up and left? One moment, they're saying, okay let's go, and the next, the place is in ashes.

As you might know, many book readers are big Jaqen fans. However, you might not know that because of his face-changing abilities, we've come up with countless theories on how every character in the series could have been Jaqen all along. For some of us, it's a past-time, for others, a running joke.

I'm sort of beating a dead horse with this, but I do think Syrio was Jaqen. I think he was captured and changed his disguise in prison, before being taken by the Night's Watch. Syrio knew the Lannisters would never release someone loyal to the Starks, so changing disguises made for the perfect escape when Yoren arrived. I can't imagine it would have been difficult to do this in the chaos that ensued Ned Stark's execution. Beside that, Jaqen and Syrio both think death is the ""one true god"", so they're both familiar with that particular Braavosi faith. And, on the road, Jaqen is immediately attracted to Arya; he knows who she is, and he's calling out for help.

[minor ADWD spoilers](/b ""To cut out minor spoilers, by 'death is the one true god' I mean the Many-Faced God and by 'that particular Braavosi faith', I mean the House of Black and White."")

This is just my theory, though. Whether or not Syrio is Jaqen, or quite frankly whether *any* character is Jaqen, is up for debate. Still, I'd like to hear some other theories now that we can all enjoy them together.",2,1,False,default,,,,,

There are tons of things in the past that weigh quite heavily on the present, and a lot of what is great about the show has to do with what happened particularly in the beginning of Roberts rebellion. Rhaegar in many ways is one of the pivotal characters of the whole show. 

Since they didn't use house of the undying for it, in many ways the TV viewers are now considerably behind the book readers, even if they should technically be side by side.

There is only so much that can be done by talk about for example the Tower of Joy. I mean sure, maybe Ros can have sex with Howland Reed at some point, but I really hope not.

The more I've thought about it, the more it feels like the only way to really do it is to have a full on episode based in the past. Or possibly the pre-credits parts to be ""blasts from the past"" for a few episodes (something done by Lost a few times, very successfully I might add... that Jacob + man in black scene might be one of the most popular ones from the show).

Can anyone else think of ideas of how to deal with their problem? The **worst** approach, and one that I'm worried they might take, is just letting the TV viewers never really hear anything about Rhaegar. That would be such a shame.",8,3,False,self,,,,,

I don't know why in the show, they leave this as somewhat ambiguous.  I see 2 questions coming up over and over again about the last episode (Why did Jon kill Qorin, and who burned Winterfell?)  Both can be figured out if you re-watch Season 2 a few more times, but I want to try and help you guys out if you don't have the means to re-watch the show at this time.

DON'T READ THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS/ANSWERS IF YOU WANT TO TRY AND FIGURE IT OUT ON YOUR OWN.

* Did Theon's men know about the deal to let the Iron Born go free in exchange for Theon?  Most likely, yes.  Either through a raven to Winterfell, or through the men at their gates yelling it over the walls.  This is why they knock him out and bag him up, so they can exchange him for their freedom.

* Did Theon's men know about any secret ways out?  No, only Luwin knew, and he didn't tell Theon.  The only way for them to get out would have been through the castle gates.

* Who was it outside the castle gates?  This is the biggest mistake I see people making.  A lot of TV viewers think it's Stark men outside the gates.  Remember back a few episodes when Bolton says his bastard son is gathering an army to march on Winterfell?  Bolton's son is not a Stark bannerman, and neither are his men.  All the Stark bannermen are in the Riverlands fighting the war.  The only remaining people in the north were the smallfolk, and the lords who were waiting to see which side won the war.

So what happened was, the Iron Born try to exchange Theon for their freedom, but something goes wrong, and everyone in Winterfell is murdered and burned.",18,33,False,self,,,,,

Maybe this is a jumping-off point for the spin-off ""Storage Wars: Westeros""? :)

2. I *just* noticed this on re-watching ""The Old Gods and the new"" yesterday - Jack Gleeson's credit was accompanied by a Stark direwolf - not a Baratheon stag, or even a Lannister lion (if they wanted to be sneaky). I remember checking once before, during S1, to see which sigil he had, and it was a stag. However, at least on this particular episode, someone goofed.

That's in part due to the way HBO sees fit to allocate money, the show-runners put together cohesive seasons while adapting the humongous song that is GRRM's Ice and Fire, and in largest part due to the very rich source material. 

I also think it's safe to say that the two episodes that GRRM wrote, ""Baelor"" 1.9 and ""Blackwater"" 2.9, were the finest of their respective seasons. This is an opinion, not a fact. (Please dispute this if you disagree.) 

So my question to you, bannermen of House Reddit, is  what do you expect to see by the 7th episode of season 3, given that it has been confirmed that George will write it, and that the season will cover about half of A Storm of Swords?

Here are some main events to jog your memories of what's to come in book 3 that may take 7 episodes to come to pass:

* Dany's meeting Daario Naharis (confirmed for season 3) and the *Storm*crows on the eve of battle with Yunkai
* Jaime and Brienne take a bath... but Jaime's life is forever changed before that, when the pair encounter the Bloody Mummers 
* Hostor's sending off/Edmure's consenting to marry a Frey
* Arya meets the Brotherhood/Sandor fights for his life
* The skirmish at Craster's Keep

but the one that jumps out at me, is

* Jon's escape at Queenscrown on a rainy night.",0,1,False,default,,,,,

Why did he and Jon fight, why did Jon kill him.  If you re-watch the episode in which they're captured, or even just the ""Previously on Game of Thrones intro"" for S2E10, it's kinda obvious.  

That's just the most obvious question I can think of since it's most recent.  But I know I've seen dozens of other questions that can **easily be answered by paying careful attention to previous episodes.**  

Another frequent one - Why was Mellisandre left behind when Stannis sailed on King's Landing?  Answered in an earlier episode.

Another - How did Theon capture Winterfell?  Weren't there a bunch of troops there?  Again, the reason Winterfell was undefended was clearly spoken in a previous episode.  

What's wrong with an excuse to re-watch the show?  If you have a question, before coming here, try watching the previous episode or two.  Or even just the ""Previously on..."" is likely to answer it.

I've read the two first books, and a bit of the third. However, I'm quite confused about a few things from the series. Firstly, Margaery is gonna wed Joffrey. Was she gonna do this in the books to? I mean, while reading the books (it's a while ago :P) I thought the girl who was being replaced with Sansa was kind of innocent, young, and well, the opposite of how Margaery is in the show. Is it the same person, but they've just changed Margaery completely? 

Secondly, at the end of the last episode you see the boss walker look right at Sam, then kinda look away. Why is he sparing Sam? I mean, I've read this part in the books, and he most certainly gets a while away from the fist of the first men (not sure if he dies though, I haven't gotten that far in the third book yet, so they might just be rushing his death and I don't know?).

Daenerys part of the show has always been my favorite. I'm not sure why I sympathize with it, but I think some has to do with Emilia Clarke's and Iain Glen's acting. Also, the exotic enviroment of Essos and the exciting history with the Targaryens and the dragons. The story is so awesome because Daenerys had to flee from her home in Westeros after Roberts rebellion where her family got murdered and then she was all alone in Essos with her insane brother. But, now she has three fucking dragons ready to tear some shit up + a loyal Jorah by his side ready to do whatever for her (atleast for now... you never know with George R.R. Martin... Always murders great charachters).


The last scene with Daenerys was one of the most powerful moments of the whole show and I had goose bumps during the whole time. So powerful and so fantastic.

I'm not sure this is necessarily the case. It's been a while since I read the books, but now watching the show, it seems like Daenerys is developing a bit of a grudge against black magic. It's connected with how she lost Drogo, and now the warlocks in Quarth have used presumably black magic to try to imprison her and her dragons. As far as I can recall Dani hasn't tried to use it herself, although the books keep hinting she should visit an eastern city known as the origin for this kind of magic, and is presumably where Melisandre learned her art. I just can't see them teaming up. Dragonfire, while related (all magic in the world has increased in power since the dragons were born), seems different than the shadows and deceptions used by Melisandre. I can't help but see Dani as an independent player for the game of thrones, not sided with either fire or ice, or R'hllor and the Great Other. I really don't think R'hllor or the Other are in any way good at all. Of course folks don't like the Others, but the black magic seems to be an evil sort of fire. That said, the mad priest Thoros and the brotherhood sections put a twist into my thinking R'hllor is bad. Melisandre could just be power-hungry and drawing power from multiple sources, fire and black magic, or are they the same? I've no idea. Thoros is presumably deriving power from the same source as Melisandre but there's an element of justice to it. So I'm unsure. Do you find this probable?"")",3,1,False,self,,,,,

I realize a lot of that has to do with time and budget restraints.

If there were no restraints, this is how I would've done it (WARNING: it's long.  I apologize for that now.  LOL):

Dany gets to the circular room with all the doors.  I want it to be hazy in there.  Foggy.  Its all magic induced, of course.  It should be like a bad fucking drug trip.  Really bad acid or mushrooms.  The screen should be shaky.... the sound should go in and out.  Just some really fucked up sensory shit.  So she goes through one of the doors.  It leads to the throne room in the Red Keep.  It is packed with people.  They are all cheering.  Dany notices shes wearing an elaborate gown befitting a queen.  Her dragon sigil is on the front of the gown.  Shes wearing a crazy super fancy dragon crown.  There is no ceiling any more, just like in the episode last night.  Or wait, maybe its glass now.  Youll see why in a minute.  So she is introduced to the people.  (Insert fancy sounding titles here:  Daenerys Targaryan, Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, Mother of Dragons, etc. etc. etc.)  The people love her.  They cheer and clap and they just love her.  She sits on the throne and gives her little speech.  I have returned, I have defeated the false kings, etc. etc. etc.  More cheering!  Camera pans up and we see her three dragons (who are fully grown now and are immense) fly overhead, breathing fire.  The people cheer even louder, because they know now that they are protected by Dany, protected by dragons.  Dany smiles and the camera is on her face and shes looking over the crowd.  Men, women, children, theyre all clapping and cheering and praising her.  Suddenly we get a glimpse of one man whos smiling like the fucking Joker.  Bald head and blue lips.  Its Pyat Pree.  Camera goes back to Dany, whose eyes and face say that shes a little bewildered at the sight of this man.  Camera goes back to Pyat, only its not Pyat now.  Its just some random guy cheering -- everyones still cheering.  Dany just kinda blinks and shakes it off.  Ser Jorah tells Dany that her small council awaits, and she gets up and starts to walk with him.  Just as theyre about to leave the throne room Dany looks back.  The man who was Pyat before is not Pyat this time.  No, this time all the children have Pyat's face.  They are not smiling like before.  They are just staring at Dany, motionless, while the rest of the crowd continues to cheer.  (I thought this would make it kinda creepy... to have all these random kids with Pyat's face just standing there... while the other people were cheering....... the contrast between the two would be really powerful, I think.)  Thats... odd, the look on Danys face says as Ser Jorah opens the door to her council chambers.

The door leads to a Dothraki tent in the desert.  Ser Jorah is gone.  Khal Drogo is there with their infant son.  Everything can happen like it did in the episode last night.  I missed you, I love you, I dont know if this is a dream, etc. etc. etc.  Only this time they have sex.  They set the little baby into a crib and start to kiss.  It escalates quickly.  Its rough like the first time they did it.  Drogo is behind her now.  Theyre doing it and because of the position theyre in, Dany cant see Drogos face.  Shes in ectasy, and the camera pulls back so we can see both of them.  Its Pyat whos behind her now.  Just imagine the most fucked up look on his face.  LOL.  I want his lips to be dripping blue.  Dont ask me why, because I dont know.  It would just be fucking creepy.  Hes talking to Dany, You are my moon and stars, whatever, all that romantic crap, and its in Drogos voice.  Dany is still oblivious.  Shes just enjoying herself, making noise, etc.  Now Pyat says more romantic stuff, but its in his voice now.  Dany looks back at him and he makes a crazy face.  I dont know... like fucking Hannibal Lecter fine-Chianti-and-Fava-beans face.  She screams and pushes him off her.  She bolts for the tent flap, trying to escape.  She looks back.  Drogo is now doing it with that witch Mirri Maz Duur.  Its gross cuz you know....... shes old and shes got an old womans body.... and yet Drogo is doing her like he was doing Dany a minute ago.  Pyat is standing there smiling.  No, it makes no sense that Drogo is doing Mirri, but thats fine.  Crazy shit happens in dreams, acid trips, whatever.  Dany runs out of the tent. 

Shes back in the circular room now with all the doors.  Ser Jorah and that Dothraki dude are there.  Khaleesi, are you all right?  Dany falls into Jorahs arms.  Shes crying, shes hysterical.  Jorah consoles her.  Shes bawling like a baby now, and Jorah tells her itll be ok.  Dany looks into Jorahs eyes and kisses him passionately.  This is what Jorah has wanted all this time, so he kisses her hard.  Dany grabs Jorah by the shoulders and brings her knee up into his groin as hard as she can.  He goes down like a fucking sack of potatoes.  Before the Dothraki dude knows whats happening, Dany has drawn Jorahs sword and she stabs the Dothraki dude in the gut.  Jorah is freaking out, and Dany grabs him by the hair.  She starts scalping him with his sword.  Camera pulls back and Danys holding a bloody scalp and hair in her hand.  Camera pans down and sure enough, its Pyat in Jorahs armor.  He laughs and stands up and with a wave of his hand, his armor comes off and hes in his warlock robes.  The sword that Dany is holding turns to blood and splashes onto the floor. 

Pyat has a bemused look on his face.  He tells her that no one has ever made it through 3 of his visions.  The visions were designed to get Dany to stay in the House of the Undying.  He was hoping shed either stay in the first vision of her as queen, or in the second vision of her with Drogo, but for some reason, she could see through what was going on.  She could see the green lines of code like in the Matrix, you know what I mean?  Maybe its her Targaryan blood or whatever that protected her and made the programs glitch and let her see the warlocks face in the first two visions.  When the third one came around, she had already figured it out, which was why she knew she wasnt really killing Jorah and the Dothraki guy.   

Like Pyat said last night, their power is stronger with the dragons there in the House of the Undying, and the dragons are stronger with Dany around, so he wanted to keep her in the house forever.  Shed be lost in one of the visions and wouldnt know where she was. 

Ok, this is where I get stuck.  I cant think of a cool and plausible way for Dany to kill Pyat.  So in my perfect world, he lets them go.  He says something along the lines of, Our powers are stronger now because you have brought dragons back into the world.  We will only grow stronger if your dragons become stronger, which cannot happen here if you know the visions we give you are false.  Go, Daenyers Stormborn.  Go and make war and kill and vanquish and conquer.  The more powerful you and your dragons become, the more powerful we become.  We will meet again.

Dany smiles.  ""Yes.  We will.""

Dany leaves with two of the dragons on her shoulders and one cradled in her arms.  She finds Ser Jorah and the Dothraki waiting for her.  They walk away together.  Dany looks back to see Pyat waving goodbye with an overwhelmingly joyful look on his face.",8,18,False,self,,,,,

We know what's coming, so it's easy to stick around. But we're not quite there yet, and I was curious to know what non-book readers felt about the direction of Season 2. I'll lay out some basic questions.

- How do you feel about the introduction of the new characters? In particular, how did you feel about Stannis, Davos, Melisandre, Brienne, and Margaery?
- How do you feel about the direction of Season 2? Season 1 is fairly straight-forward in terms of plot, and we can easily follow Ned on his quest. Season 2 is a lot more spread out.
- After the epic last scene of Season 1, were you expecting or hoping more would come of Dany and her dragons?
- How do you feel about characters that are at a stand still? At the end of last season Arya was heading north to reunite with her family. And she is again, at the end of this season. Sansa remains a captive. Joffrey, Cersei, et al, still live happily in King's Landing.
- What are your hopes for the series moving forward?

I'd also just like to hear general opinions on the season and the show as a whole. ",28,25,False,self,,,,,

I'm to assume that GRRM gave the show the go ahead to do this, so it is probably not of any immediate significance to the story as we'll know it, but, that's a lot of money and a lot of power changing hands/being removed from the system, in theory. In addition, as far as viewers are concerned most of this happened behind closed doors, out of the public eye. 

So, what are the implications of last night's episode in regards to Qarth? It's a ""free city"", but The Thirteen were clearly important to the city's leadership, and they must've controlled 90+% of the wealth. ",9,5,False,self,,,,,

The whole thing with all the fight over proper succession is partly inspired by the War of the Roses in the late 1400s, and back then, to ensure pedigree, the monarchies were kind of inbred. It's definitely fucked up, but it definitely happened back then, so that's why there's incest with the Targaryen line. It's toned down, though.

Outstanding supporting actor:  
Peter Dinklage (Tyrion Lannister)  
Alfie Allen (Theon Greyjoy)  
Kit Harington (Jon Snow)  
Richard Madden (Robb Stark)

Emilia Clarke (Daenerys Targaryen)  
Lena Headey (Cersei Lannister)  
Michelle Fairley (Catelyn Stark)  
Maisie Williams (Arya Stark)  
Sophie Turner (Sansa Stark)  

What do you all think about who has a real shot? Who do you think they left out? I'm kind of surprised Charles Dance nor Jack Gleeson were submitted.  
  
Peter Dinklage is probably the man to beat again this year, but Alfie Allen was pretty good too. I'd love to see Maisie Williams nominated at least, but I sense that it won't happen. Lena Headey has a good chance, though.",10,11,False,self,,,,,

Absolutely loved it. Best show on television by far. That being said there were some disappointments as a reader. I completely understand that there is only so much allotted time and somethings are better for TV etc. Here are some of my thoughts the good and the bad, in no particular order.

+ (plus) Alfie Allen as Theon Greyjoy. Hands down made the season for me. He deserves an Emmy in my mind. As a reader, I felt Theon was a huge dick and was more about glory seeking. The show and Alfie did an amazing job showing Theon's inner turmoil, which I felt the books didn't quite have. Amazing actor and I will miss him a lot. If book 3 is divided into 2 season and book 4 and 5 happen in the same manor, we might not be seeing Theon Greyjoy for 4 more season. Maybe they show him once or twice but he won't have any major role until ADwD. WHAT IS DEAD MAY NEVER DIE!!!

- (minus) Arya. Arya is one of my favorite characters in the book. She got a good amount of camera time but I felt like they could of made it better. The scene where she gets captured was all wrong in my mind. I understand they probably needed to expedite her trip to Harrenhal due to timing but at least have a battle where she fights some people with needle. That part of the book (+ her journey) made me think woah this girl is badass and I didn't quite get that feeling in the show. Her exchange with Jaqen where he tells her to kill himself wasn't as tense as I imagined it. I also wish she was more involved in the escape from Harrenhal and got some weasel soup goin. Finally, I'm sad they offed the Tickler because it means there won't be that gruesome scene in ASoS where she ""questions"" him while stabbing him repeatedly.

+ (plus) Blackwater. That was a perfect episode. Lena Headley did an amazing job and that final scene in the throne room was chilling. I knew the outcome but it still moved me (especially the theme playing). Of the male actors, I loved The Hound's scenes. I do feel his ""fear"" of fire kind of made him look a bit sissy. They should of surrounded him in it. That particular scene felt a little awkward. The battle was great. Stannis was great. Everything was great. Perfection

- (minus) Dany. Its not a major gripe but when all that shit when down with Xaro and the thirteen I was like what on earth is going on. But I came around because I realize its more action for her story line since the Books is fairly boring. The house of the undying was fine... until the end. Pyat  Pree went down to easy. Guy has multiple versions of himself ... has been stabbed by a sword. and he gets killed by baby dragons. I wanted her to burn the whole place down  like in the book. (As an aside: Dany coming out of the wall was overt foreshadowing even for book readers.. Did that happen in the book?) (Aside aside: Emilia Clarke is gorgeous)

- (minus) Overtness. Where is the subtlety? Sending Littlefinger to Renly's camp.. his scenes with Margerey. I think the glory of the books was you didn't see a lot of things coming. Those scenes not only foreshadow the rest of season 2 but book 3 as well. Why do we need to know exactly what Petyr is doing? Him talking to Sansa in the last episode... I think they should give viewers more credit instead of being so upfront about things. 

- (minus) Jon Snow. Ygritte is pretty and looks like she'll be fit for the role to come next season. But I didn't feel like they needed to build their relationship in this season. Why couldn't they do it in season 3. It would of setup for a better Jon and Quorin showdown. I think a lot of viewers were confused by Jon killing Quorin. Also in what world would Quorin be captured? He'd fight to the death... That and I'm sure the wildlings would love to kill him given the chance. Also where is Ghost?

Lightning Round:

+ (plus) Brienne. Great casting. She has the most badass scenes in the show. She plays the part well and I look forward to her and Jaime's travels. (Also why move this up? Would of made an excellent season ending cliffhanger)
+ (ehh) Tywin. Came off as a good guy. Not sure how I feel about that
+ (plus) Jaqen. All men must act well. This one certainly did
- (minus) Bran and Rickon. Why hide the news that they died? It was a compelling factor in releasing Jaime. Also I wish Luwin told Osha to split them up. 
- (minus) Robb. Make war not love.
+ (plus) Shadowbaby. Well done. Can't imagine the WTF faces on all the non readers.
~ Jojen &amp; Meera. Or lack there of. I don't quite care because I wasn't a huge fan of them in the books.
+ (plus) I finally learned how to pronounce Valar Morghulis. I thought it was more of a mor-gull-is not morgoolis
- (minus) Devan dying (likely). Since they showed his other sons, I imagine Devan will be his source of grief.  What if Devan is important later on? He is around Melisandre at the end of ADwD.


TL;DR: Some good some bad. Loved it anyways.

Most favourite: I know it's been a bit controversial, but I absolutely loved the ending, with the huge hordes of wights/Others marching on the Fist of the First Men. Really captured why everyone in the Seven Kingdoms should actually be paying a LOT more attention to what's going on north of The Wall

Least favourite: Jon's killing of Qhorin Halfhand. Not handled well at all - everyone I know who's watched the show without reading the books has asked me what the hell was going on there. I honestly don't understand why they felt the need to change that so dramatically - Jon comes across as incompetent and the Wildlings as gullible.

Okay so I know there could be secret passages, but what are the 500 men doing outside when they see Winterfell was on fire? Did they not come in and help? What about Hodor and the kids? They escape north but none of the 500 men surrounding winterfell saw/helped them? Details like this can drag a few scenes so another episode is better. I think. Then Sansa, Baelish tries to help her (I dont know his intentions but I certainly dont trust him. Yet.) but I thought clegane was suppose to escape with her? And where the hell is he anyway. Then there's Arya. At least let us know where is she heading? Then Robb. Marrying. Is that a secret wedding or he chose to ignore the oath he made? And what happens after or before the wedding?"")

All these things could be explained better in 2 episodes because details are needed.

It's really long so I thought I might summarize it.

She only wears her pink dress when she's being rescued by the Hound. http://i.imgur.com/6BGrT.jpg It's a change from her normal blue/grey costumes because when she's with him, she isn't a political piece, a Tully or a Stark - she's just a girl. 


This is what really got me:
After she stopped wearing the Lannister necklace (when her father was exectued), she started wearing dragonflies again. They represent the song of Jenny of Oldstones and the Prince of Dragonflies.

*Prince Duncan Targaryen loved her so much he gave up his crown for her. She was friends with a woods witch who prophesied that the Prince That Was Promised would be born from the line of Prince Aerys and Princess Rhaella. When Aegon V heard the prophecy he arranged the marriage between the two.*

Interestingly enough, the woods witch is the Ghost of High Heart, [minor ASOS}](/b ""who tells two prophecies about Sansa."")

I thought it was amazing that they put so much detail into just her jewelry.

Welcome to the last followup of this season. [Here's the previous one.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/uh219/followup_for_nonreaders_blackwater_update/) I'll probably add missing followups for season 1 or so on a weekly basis if I have some spare time. The wait is gonna get this subreddit bonkers.


**Shit Hits The Floor**

&gt; ""Just like your mother did at your age... I can see so much of her in you... She was like a sister to me...""
&gt;  - Littlefinger, TOTALLY NOT CREEPY

It was impossible to top ""Blackwater"". Not this season. After shit hit the fan last week, now it aimed for the floor instead.

* Harrenhal is a cursed, ruined castle, but it's not the castle that matters - it's the title. Petyr Baelish has been a lesser lord of small windy peninsula north of Eyrie - it's a tremendous promotion for his social status. His former position was the reason he was never considered a match for Catelyn Tully (as Tullys of Riverrun were much above Baelishes of Fingers).

* Following my last post: Tyrells are the largest military force in Westeros. Having them on their side and Baratheons of Storm's End defeated, Lannisters grew to an unstoppable force, having no real challenge on the continent but Robb's rebellion (notice how similar ""Robb's rebellion"" sounds to ""Robert's rebellion"" due to Ned naming his firstborn son after his best friend).

* All Stannis's men who got caught could redeem themselves by swearing fealty to Joffrey. Those who refused were killed. We missed a significant scene where Joffrey's arm gets cut by the Iron Throne. One of Stannis's bannermen shouts ""Even the throne rejects him!"". That would've been powerful.

* In the books Bronn wasn't the captain of the gold cloaks, so the way to deprive Tyrion of him was... to knight him. Call him ""ser Bronn"" from now on.

**Road Trippin'**

&gt; ""Wait... I (do) know you""
&gt;  - Skyrim reference for those who get it ;)

* Riverrun appears in book 2, but we'll see it in season 3. It's home to the Tullys (so far we've met only Lysa Arryn and Catelyn Stark) and the capital of the Riverlands (since Harrenhal was burnt by dragonfire). And of course Brienne is going anywhere but there.

* The reverse happened to Brienne&amp;Jamie road trip - it's from ASOS. Looks like it's gonna get prolonged. Good for us.

* Brienne's virginity has been a topic for jokes at Renly's camp. The other knights have been treating her like a lady for a while because of a contest to get into her pants.

**Camp Fallen Protagonist**

&gt; ""Walder Frey is a dangerous man""
&gt;  - Mrs. Granger, about Argus Filch

* With Lannisters controlling Harrenhal, which is near to the only other crossing (Kingsroad one), The Twins are the only way back to Winterfell for Robb.

* In the books, the girl Robb marries is Jeyne Westerling. In the show, she might as well be, she looks quite suspicious (book Jeyne was close to inexistent, she just appeared out of nowhere as Robb's wife).

* Robb married Jayne after taking her maidenhood, valuing her honor over his own (Stark cause of goddamned honor, fear of having a bastard child like his father did). Westerling is a house sworn to the Lannisters, so he gains an ally, but a lesser one. I'm having trouble naming TV show Robb anything but ""stupid"".

**I'll Be Back**

&gt; ""Where is your god now?""
&gt;  - Stannis, calling one of the most used lines ever

* Finally we got it: Melisandre sees things in flames. That's how she saw Matthos's death coming (""death by fire is the purest death""). She's a *shadowbinder of Asshai*, just like Quaithe (the masked woman advicing Jorah in Qarth), who also happens to have mojo.

* Notice how Melisandre doesn't fight Stannnis choking her. She's completely devoted to Stannis just like Davos.

* Also notice how the only person other than shadowbinders capable of seeing the future is Bran (dreams before Ned died and Theon attacked). Either connection or opposition, interesting anyway.

* Melisandre's preaching involve two gods, actually. One being R'hllor, Lord of Light, red god of fire, the other one being The Great Other, god of ice and death. Ice and death... reminds you of something? Yeah, that's horrible, but Melisandre can be kind of ""good guy""...

* I mentioned that in ACOK Melisandre wants to burn Edric Storm, Robert's bastard, to awaken dragons at Dragonstone. Having Edric absent I'm really, really afraid the writers might replace him with Stannis's daughter, Shireen. That would suck.

**Euro 2012**

&gt; ""WHOEVER KILLS THAT FUCKING HORNBLOWER WILL STAND IN BRONZE ON THE SHORES OF PYKE""
&gt;  - Theon, preparing to welcome the football fans

* Fun fact: vuvuzelas are actually forbidden to bring to public events during European Football Championship 2012 in Poland. Thank God. Just watching the games during the World Cup in South Africa in 2010 did some serious damage to my ears. I couldn't imagine those things on my streets.

* What happened to Theon was pretty much clear: his people left him for Ramsay Snow, the bastard son of Roose Bolton. Dagmer Cleftjaw proved himself to be a master douchebag by stabbing maester Luwin and went home.

* Who burnt Winterfell then? Ramsay Snow, according to ACOK. Why? Well, let's say Joffrey is gonna get some serious competition. ACOK handled this whole sequence quite differently and I'm not sure how much telling how it happened there would spoil season 3 (or 4?). That's all you're supposed to know now.

**There Are My Dragons!**

&gt; ""Dracarys""
&gt;  - Daenerys, doing something interesting for the very first time this season

* What was changed? Everything. Not a single vision from the book made it to the show.

* Unfortunately, I cannot highlight the important ones, because pointing at what visions should be analyzed would spoil some major events. Like MAJOR EVENTS. Some visions involved Dany's family and there was one with wolf.

* What have we seen, then? Enough to speculate on. Set aside the Drogo vision, as it was more a romance than actual plot development. What Dany saw was: *snow on the Iron Throne* and *the Wall*. Why are those connected to her - find out in the first reply to the post.

* Pyat Pree confirmed for watchers what readers already knew: magic grows strogner with dragons.

**Crossroads**

&gt; ""Valar morghulis""
&gt;  - Jaqen, finally confirming how to pronounce it

* Faceless Men has been mentioned many time throughout season 1. Doreah tells about one of them to Viserys, possibility of using them is considered when small council plots to kill Daenerys.

* In the books Tyrion wonders if he could hire one of them to kill Cersei, but he can't afford it. It seems like noone really can.

* ""Valar morghulis"" means [not sure which book it gets explained in](/b ""All men must die""). There are some crazy conspiracy theories linking Faceless Men to the [You wouldn't have guessed](/g ""White Walkers (told you, crazy)"") because of that catchphrase.

* Another crazy tinfoil hat theory is that Jaqen H'gar was Syrio Forel and that's how he got into King's Landing dungeons. I think Jaqen denied being Syrio by saying that Faceless Men are entirely different than ""dancing masters"" and I'm glad we got some evidence pointing in any direction.

* Jaqen is not a master assassin - he's a grandmaster assassin, the way he kills in the books being as close to magic as possible. One of Arya's targets has been killed by his own dog.

**Snape Kills Dumbledore**

&gt; ""Was that your whore mother?""
&gt;  - Qhorin Halfhand, making Jon look even more emo than he already does

* To set things clear: Qhorin *wanted* Jon to kill him, as this was the only way to plant him inside Wildling army and otherwise they were both pretty much dead.

* Qhorin's last word is ""sharp..."". In the books, he asks Jon during their travel many times: ""Is your sword sharp?"".

* Ghost is around, in the books he helps Jon and rips Qhorin's calf. Jon's connection to Ghost wins him more respect. The reason we didn't see it is probably that Bran-Summer and Jon-Ghost connection is getting pushed to next season with the Reeds explaining it to the viewers.

* Wilding army is said to consist of mammoths and giants. Now let's pray for increased budget for next seasons...

**It's Called Iceland For A Reason**

&gt; ""Three blasts. RUN!""

* In the books (I hate having to start with this) this scene happens in the night and the area around the Fist of the First Men is forested. In my opinion it would be much more frightening, but it's Iceland due to north-of-north-of-north-of-north-of reasons.

Since I'm a really cheap bastard, I was curious when you thought the best time to subscribe to HBO and watch all of season 2 in HD would be?

Let me point out that my cable company does not offer HBO GO, and that On Demand is in SD only. Also, only the main HBO channel is in HD; the other channels are SD. This means I'll have to DVR the episodes as they re-air on the main channel if I want to watch them in HD.

The good news is that my cable company will allow me to subscribe for one month and cancel without incurring any additional charges. My frugal self just wants to know what month that should be. Would I be better off time-shifting this and watching it on Blueray from Netflix next year?

Looking at the schedule it appears that Season 2 re-airs in **June**/July, but most of the channels it is airing on are not HD channels in my area.

Does anyone have the inside track on how to watch GoT in HD now that the season has ended? Has HBO considered people like me in their scheduling and made my task impossible?",10,2,False,self,,,,,

But thats not that big of a deal and I thought the way they did it in the show was visually more fun to watch. 

The thing that really annoyed me tho was the way they didn't include any of the main vissions from the book. There pretty important and foreshadowed a lot of the future events as well as past events. They would of explained a lot to people who havnt read the books and in my opinion I think the Red Wedding foreshadow would have been a great cliffhanger and a real WTF moment.
They skipped the Rhaegar vision wich is pretty important and is linked into the title of the series as well as actually introducing non book readers to Rhaegar himself.
The last thing that annoyed me was the way they skipped the prophecies, ""three fires must you light... one for life and one for death and one to love... three mounts must you ride... one to bed and one to dread and one to love... three treasons will you know... once for blood and once for gold and once for love...""

well I just realized this, i think that the war in westeros, and a lot of events have been orchestrated for hundreds of years. possibly by the others or someone serving them or their dark gods.

first, we have valyria.  Its an advanced society that utilized dragons. dragons being the most effective weapon against wights. the army of the others.  it was also the seat of strength in the south.

its suddenly destroyed by the doom.  now we have no valyria, no dragons.

Then we have the Targaryens.  One of the only surviving families from Valyria. sheltered on dragonstone they conquer westeros with the few remaining dragons and set up a dynasty.   this lasts for 300 years.  durin this time sitting on the iron throne was a valyrian, with a small army of dragons.

he goes mad, makes all the wrong moves, and then is overthrown by robert.

now, lets look at the chain of events afterwards, the nightswatch becomes a joke and a dumping ground for bastards and criminals. 

The dragons are dead, the targaryens are off of their throne.

Valyria is gone,an so are there armies of dragons.

now we have the armies of man.

the frist line of defence, winterfell, is gone.  its armies gone south to fight a largly pointless war.

the people that should be preparing for the long winter aren't they are fighting or fleeing.

the only line of defence that kings landing would have had against the coming invasion, mainly a stockpile of wildfire that took a generation to make, is gone.  wasted in an attack on stannis forces.

The armies are fractured and fighting amongst themselves.   the wildfire is gone, the dragons are gone. There are barely any Valyrians left, and even fewer magic users.

my thought is, that's all too convenient to be all just a coincidence.   

what if there is a person, or a thing, behind it all manipulating it in the favour of the others.   maybe the mad king wasn't mad naturally,but someone did something to him, to get him off of the throne.

it just seems like a pattern to me, like something that creatures thousands of years old and steeped in magic might do.

Clearly, they are using England as a stand-in for Westeros, but I also like the way they've given Northern characters north of England accents (or, in the case of Bear Island, Scottish accents.) It only goes so far of course - not sure why some of the Stark children somehow got southern accents, and there seem to be a rather wide variety of different northern/southern accents within the same towns or families.

What does irk me a little is the Americans/Irish doing their ""Hollywood British"" accents. Maybe there are a few who are doing it so well I mistakenly assumed them to be English, but Tyrion, Baelish and Joffrey all have this weird, over-enunciated, vowel-emphasising thing going on that I find a tad jarring. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau as Jaime Lannister fooled me - I'd never have guessed he was a Dane. And I was really impressed by Lena Heady, who I mistakenly took for an American after seeing her play Sarah Connor, but I'm still impressed by the way she doesn't sound like she's from Yorkshire - it would have been confusing if Cercei Lannister sounded too much like Ned Stark!

Anyone I haven't mentioned I've mistaken for a trueborn Brit, and can say truthfully that their fake accent can hoodwink a native.",92,37,False,self,,,,,

What happened to the 500 strong army that saved them?  Didn't Sansa go with the Dog?

Ok, I'm pretty good at following complicated plots and whatnot, but something confused the hell out of me.

How is Winterfell burned down?  It was being defended by 20 men, surrounded by 500.  The 20 said ""lets go home.""  Wouldn't then the 500 stark men waltz in?  Did they burn the place?  Why burn the town they came to save?  Ok, maybe the 20 Iron Islers burnt it down before they left.  Fine.

Then where the hell are the 500 men?  Why can't the 2 Stark boys go south to rejoin their brother/mother?  The answer that was given ""We dont' know where they are""  WHY NOT ASK THE 500 MEN THAT SAVED YOU.  ""There are too many enemies on the road.""  WHY NOT BE ESCORTED BY 500 FUCKING SOLDIERS?  So the starks boys have to flee into exile even though Winterfell was just liberated.  It makes zero sense.

Ok, maybe the 500 men plundered Winterfell because they were disloyal.  This is the ONLY reasonable explanation.  Why didn't the show tell us that then?  

If its a spoiler, go ahead and tell me anyways, since its the only reasonable explanation and I'm assuming its true.  Maybe someone who read the books can tell me.

Also, wasn't Sansa going with the Dog?  What the hell happened to that?

I won't list all the plot points but I think a HBO mini-series all about Brienne, ""good guy"" Jaime, Cersei falling apart, the Boltons and Reek, Arya being a street-urchin, and Daenerys conquering slave cities that she ultimately ends up occupying for no reason while seemingly forgetting her mission in life was to reconquer Westeros while allowing her dragons to go wild, won't be TV worthy.  Granted Jon's story on the Wall with the wights and wildlings is interesting, but I don't think I'm alone in thinking it's not going to make good television.

And we all know that GRRM keeps on adding characters and new twists all the way through the 6th book. I don't think I'm alone in hoping that some things would have been settled by the 6th book and the invasion of Westeros would have been underway by then.

Melisandre's visions of Jon Snow being betrayed by the nights comes true right? 

And everyone who's read ACOK or seen season 2 recalls that she has visions of Stannis becoming King? 

The visions that Danny has during her time with the wizards at Qarth basically reveal that (I've come to infer) she's seeing things that she wants but will never come true (the dragon burned throne, seeing drogo and her son, etc.)

Could this mean that Stannis does in fact become king [ADWD](/b ""as we are revealed in TWOW spoilers, he didn't die in ADWD,""), killing the Boltons in the North (which Sansa then regains some time after this with the aid of Lord Baliesh) and then combines his forces of wildings, nightswatchmen, and the vale (at advice which most likely comes from Melisandre), then takes the crown from either the Tyrells or  Aegon... 

(what probably happens here is a battle between Aegon and the Tyrells, in which either weakens the Tyrells or defeats them)

Danny either never makes it to the throne, or does so without her dragons... 

Theory here is that Stannis takes the crown from either Tyrell, or Aegon, and Danny then takes the crown from him... If she never makes it to the throne however, Stannis stays king (which I doubt). 

(No matter what, Stannis will become king, whether for a short amount of time, or in the end)

Whoever has the crown (Danny/Stannis) ends the story defending their people against the Others/White-walkers (because the story starts with the White Walkers, therefore must end with the White peoples) who attempt to make the world their own frozen world out of survival instincts? 

(the battle against the White Walkers is what brings surviving characters together)

Where the mischievous Baelish comes into play in all this is yet to be identified (he most likely sees certain death, possibly by a plot/betrayal from Sansa conceived by Varys, after Sansa takes back the North). 

Theon most likely dies (I'm pretty sure).

Arya is probably the hardest to consider, since it's basically a rogue storyline on it's own, but somehow is reunited with Sansa.

If theory has it that Jon Snow is Targaryen heir (and survives his wounds in DWD), he'll betray Stannis giving Danny crown.

Seeing you across the Twins and extra men

I have noticed an interesting trend where they don't always know a character's proper name.  Sometimes they get the nickname right, but not always.  They've collectively developed their own names for various characters.

For instance, ALL of these people don't know who Daenerys Targaryen is.  To a man (and woman), they refer to her as ""Khaleesi"". 

Tyrion is ""Imp"".

Khal Drogo is ""Conan""

Melisandre is ""The Red Witch""

Joffrey is ""Jeffrey"" (Makes me cringe, too)

Jon is ""The Bastard"".

Tywin Lannister is ""The Grandfather"".

Cersei is ""The Queen"".

Robert is ""The Fat King"".

Jamie is ""Kingslayer"".

Brienne is ""That Huge Chick""

Catelyn is ""The Mom""

Ser Jorah is ""The Bodyguard""

Davos is ""The Beard Guy""

Arya is ""The Little Girl"".

Sansa is ""The Hot Daughter""

Littlefinger is ""Carcetti"" (The mayor in ""The Wire"", also played by Aidan Gillen.)

Pycelle is ""Donovan"".  (The bad guy from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, played by the same actor)

Ros is ""The Whore"".

Varys is ""The Bald Guy"".

Finally, there are two characters that everyone gets right:  Stannis and The Hound.  Interesting, I guess the writers really made it clear what their names were or something.

I know Arya spends more time with Tywin in the show (a change that I think started strong and just had too much time spent on it) and less actually seeing how abused the people at Harrenhal are, but her role in the uprising was so powerful in the book and I think the show loses something by having her leave like she does after everything she's seen.  

I missed the hints of a deepening rage, the organized Northmen being freed, Hot Pie's little moment, Arya killing again as they're fighting through...really underwhelming in the show's version of events, imo, and another example of an arc getting short-changed in Season 2 (not as bad as Jon and Qhorin's severely reduced relationship, though).  Maisie Williams is such a strong actress and I think she could have sold the hell out of an escape more faithful to the book, but as they are her final S2 moments just kind of fizzle out in a ""Well, see ya next year"" kind of way, not the far better ""So yeah, that happened.

It may be that Eddard Stark has taking Jon as his bastard to hide his true identity, knowing the solid sense of honor Eddard has, it can be possible, but that means that Jon's parents should have been really, really important, im thinking Raeghal and Elia type of important.

Qarth:
Was the entire city a ruse?  When they open the chamber where Xaro is supposed to store his treasures they find it empty.  What does this mean?  Was he never wealthy and used his cunning to be one of the 13 or did he just spend it all?  The richest man in Qarth (I forget his name) refused to lend Dany a ship because he said he was a trader so this means that there is real commerce in Qarth.  So how did Xaro lie to everyone and be one of the 13?  Or is the entire city a lie and no one has any money?


Tryion/King's Landing:
We find Tyrion in the chambers visited by Pycelle, Vareys, Shae and Podrick.  Does everyone else think he is dead?  Tywin actually respects Tyrion (having made him Hand of the King in his stead) so does he think that Tyrion is dead when he accepts being the Hand?  I find it strange that Tywin doesn't ask anything about Tyrion and acts like everything is alright despite (not) knowing about Tyrion's whereabouts.

First, I was wondering why exactly did the night's watch commander (I think his name was Qhorin Halfhand, correct me if I'm wrong) attack Jon Snow? I had assumed that based on what he told Jon is S2E8 that he was trying to pull some trickery or something to escape from the wildlings, but did he expect Jon to kill him? Or was Jon just sort of pissed off by his trash talk and killed him in the heat of the moment?

The second thing that confused me was what went down at Winterfell.   Theon was talking about how the city was surrounded by Stark men, and of course one of his own men knocked him out. I'm assuming the rest of his men were going to try and trade Theon for safe passage out of the city, but how exactly were they able to raze and burn the city like that? After Osha led the Stark boys out of the city, there was no trace of the other Stark forces that had laid siege to the city. Did they take off in pursuit of the Greyjoys? I feel like I missed something.

I'd really appreciate someone to explain a few of these points to me, much thanks to anyone who can help.",10,0,False,default,,,,,

Season 1 Spoilers]",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/unytc/agot_vs_season_1_a_viewers_perspective_agot/,Minddamojo,1338992626,"Much has been heard from the book readers about the TV Series - greatly enriching the content of this subreddit, if I might add, those recent non-reader episode followups in particular have been amazing - but not as much from the opposite perspective: someone who started following the HBO series and from then went on to the books.

I've recently finished reading AGOT, and it has certainly made me see the series with new eyes - I've noticed some areas in which the TV show lacked, as well as others in which it did better than the book itself!

In this post I wish to share some of the thoughts I got while reading the book. Apologies if this kind of content has been posted before, but with the end of season 2, the activity in this subreddit seems to have died down a little as well, so I expect this kind of content to be welcome. Even if it's season 1 stuff.

* I think the TV Series has done a better job with Cersei and the Small Council than AGOT. Those extra Cersei scenes, specifically the one with Robert early on really help her character develop beyond the Evil icy queen persona found in AGOT. The scene between Littlefinger and Varys and their mutual admiration was one of the best in the series and established their relationship in a way that wasn't done in AGOT. These are, however, natural consequences of the POV system used in the books of which the TV Series is free.

* The animosity there seems to be toward Catelyn in this subreddit from book readers must probably come from ACOK and beyond. AGOT Catelyn did make some silly decisions, but she was IMO by far the strongest female character in the book. Her chapter with her father in Riverrun was very very good, and her chapters in general were ones I was always looking forward to read.

* Since I've mentioned Riverrun, I might as well talk about my main gripe with the show: the Tullys. Or rather, the absence of the Tullys. **When I finished watching the show, I had no idea they were in it with the Starks** since they're never portrayed aside from Catelyn and Lysa, who are mostly representing Stark and Arryn respectively. I certainly look forward to the Blackfish showing up in the series.

* Sansa's last chapter in the book, after her father's death, is very strong and makes you understand how much her world changed when Ned died. They couldn't show that as well in the TV series (an advantage of the POV system) but they've done a good job. 

* Arya's and Jon's chapters were pretty faithful to the books, (minus the God of Death lines - god I missed those while reading). Maisie Williams really makes the character come alive in the TV series, and  Kit Harington's done a great job as well.

* After reading AGOT, I understood just how well Sean Bean played Ned. The honorable, but weary and naive Eddard Stark couldn't have found a better match. Those scenes he has with Sansa and Arya are amazing, the pride and joy in Sean's eyes was an ever-present image in my mind while reading the equivalent chapters in the book.

* Littlefinger is an even bigger douche in AGOT. Impressive.

* Finally, no big surprises in Vaes Dothrak. Not entirely sure if I prefer the way their wedding's night was portrayed in the book.

I'm staring ACOK tonight and if this is welcomed at all by the community I'll do the same for season 2. Please give me your thoughts on this perspective, and especially the Tully thing.

Oh, and as this has been asked a lot as of late: **Yes, do read the books, and do start with AGOT. I was amazed by how immersed by the book I was despite being familiar with most of the plot.**

For those who hate gawker blogs, here it is in full:

&gt;This is the rarest of spoilers, insofar as it seems to apply both to the TV show and the as yet unpublished books. Theon Greyjoy actor Alfie Allen reveals he asked George R.R. Martin the answer to one of the saga's biggest unsolved mysteries, and his answer certainly drops some potentially massive clues:

&gt;*You know, I asked him about who Jon Snow's real parents were, and he told me. I can't say who, but I can tell you that it involves a bit of a Luke Skywalker situation. It will all come to fruition eventually. The whole thing with all the fight over proper succession is partly inspired by the War of the Roses in the late 1400s, and back then, to ensure pedigree, the monarchies were kind of inbred. It's definitely fucked up, but it definitely happened back then, so that's why there's incest with the Targaryen line. It's toned down, though.*

&gt;Let's assume Allen knows what he's talking about when making the Star Wars analogy. For this to be a Luke Skywalker situation, you'd kind of have to think that Jon Snow's father  the one parent he thought he was sure of  isn't who he thought he was. Also, his father is a monster on the scale of Darth Vader. At the risk of adding 2 and 2 together to make 1,000, his sudden segue into discussion of the Targaryen line might be relevant here. (I'm not going to say any more, since my Morning Spoilers remit doesn't necessarily cover spoiling the books as well, so I'm going to keep this relatively vague.) But, of course, this is all massive speculation, so I'd advise drawing your own conclusions.

My two cents: A luke skywalker situation makes it sound like he might be the twin of Daenerys Targaryen.  ",9,4,False,self,,,,,

""More or less."" Brienne answered.

Septon Meribald disagreed. ""More less than more. There are many sorts of outlaws, just as there are many sorts of birds. A sandpiper and a sea eagle both have wings, but they are not the same. The singers love to sing of good men forced to go outside the law to fight some wicked lord, but most outlaws are more like this ravening Hound than they are the lightning lord. They are evil men, driven by greed, soured by malice, despising the gods and caring only for themselves. Broken men are more deserving of our pity, though they may be just as dangerous. Almost all are common-born, simple folk who had never been more than a mile from the house where they were born until the day some lord came round to take them off to war. Poorly shod and poorly clad, they march away beneath his banners, ofttimes with no better arms than a sickle or a sharpened hoe, or a maul they made themselves by lashing a stone to a stick with strips of hide. Brothers march with brothers, sons with fathers, friends with friends. They've heard the songs and stories, so they go off with eager hearts, dreaming of the wonders they will see, of the wealth and glory they will win. War seems a fine adventure, the greatest most of them will ever know.
""Then they get a taste of battle.
""For some, that one taste is enough to break them. Others go on for years, until they lose count of all the battles they have fought in, but even a man who has survived a hundred fights can break in his hundred-and-first. Brothers watch their brothers die, fathers lose their sons, friends see their friends trying to hold their entrails in after they've been gutted by an axe.
""They see the lord who led them there cut down, and some other lord shouts that they are his now. They take a wound, and when that's still half-healed they take another. There is never enough to eat, their shoes fall to pieces from the marching, their clothes are torn and rotting, and half of them are shitting in their breeches from drinking bad water.

""If they want new boots or a warmer cloak or maybe a rusted iron halfhelm, they need to take them from a corpse, and before long they are stealing from the living too, from the smallfolk whose lands they're fighting in, men very like the men they used to be. They slaughter their sheep and steal their chicken's, and from there it's just a short step to carrying off their daughters too. And one day they look around and realize all their friends and kin are gone, that they are fighting beside strangers beneath a banner that they hardly recognize. They don't know where they are or how to get back home and the lord they're fighting for does not know their names, yet here he comes, shouting for them to form up, to make a line with their spears and scythes and sharpened hoes, to stand their ground. And the knights come down on them, faceless men clad all in steel, and the iron thunder of their charge seems to fill the world...

""And the man breaks.

""He turns and runs, or crawls off afterward over the corpses of the slain, or steals away in the black of night, and he finds someplace to hide. All thought of home is gone by then, and kings and lords and gods mean less to him than a haunch of spoiled meat that will let him live another day, or a skin of bad wine that might drown his fear for a few hours. The broken man lives from day to day, from meal to meal, more beast than man. Lady Brienne is not wrong. In times like these, the traveler must beware of broken men, and fear them...but he should pity them as well ",5,4,False,self,,,,,

For a visual medium however, the presence of two seven foot guards would lend the wizened old crone an immediate sense of gravitas. 

Furthermore, because they have no actual speaking lines, they would essentially be glorified extras and would not eat up a large portion of the budget.

The only pseudo-challenge would be finding twin seven footers (or thereabouts), a problem easily remedied by the use of helmets.

Because these characters would be so useful and cost-effective, I would be really disappointed not to see my favorite Tyrell flanked by her twin towers.

I'm trying to create my own trailer for Game of thrones using Adobe After Effects. In my project I want to add sound clips of the characters throughout the trailer. For example, I want to add in Ned Stark saying ""Winter is coming"" and maybe Joffrey saying ""I am king"" or something along those lines.

My question is, where can I get sound bites from the show? Or, does anyone know how I can easily make the clips myself? Any help would be more than appreciated from this great subreddit! 

Thanks,

I hated the Lannisters and wanted the Starks to get revenge. 

But after re-watching the season I realize that Ned Stark, as honorable as he claims to be, made far too many poor judgement calls. 

Firstly, when Cat comes to Kings Landing to warn him - he does nothing! As a father the least you would do is ensure your children's safety. Why did he not send his girls back to Winterfell ASAP?

He suspects the Lannisters are behind Brans fall - yet he chooses to confront Cersei all by herself when he finds out about the incest. He tells her he doesn't want her blood on his hands and she should take her children and flee. She's responsible for almost murdering your child Ned! Why give her a chance? And Cersei gives him a stern reply 'You either win the game of thrones or you die'. It's clear she's not going away! (In fact I was rooting for Cersei by then. She had been hardened by staying at Kings Landing and was much better prepared.)

And during all of this Littlefinger plays Ned like a violin. Littlefinger even tells Ned to not trust anyone - including Littlefinger himself! What does Ned do? The exact opposite.

When Robert is on his death bed and writes that Ned should take over till Joffrey comes of age, why not call the small council immediately and have them witness Robert's statement! Cersei simply tears the letter in court and ends the matter.

After all these mistakes Ned figures he will confess to being a traitor and take the black. Too late now buddy!",133,71,False,self,,,,,

We will have Bran (if he is alive, I have no idea), played by an almost fully grown man! Imagine if the 8 books of Harry Potter would have been set during 3 years? It would have been impossible to have the same cast playing young children. What do you guys think?

tl;dr: tv series for 7+- years, but Bran etc will grow up and it won't work with an adult playing the role.",9,0,False,self,,,,,

Here was my response that attempted to tie the logic to ravens within GoT as an analogue:

&gt; I want to translate this knowledge of their functionality into fantasy series (specifically Game of Thrones). I don't think the way they're used aligns with what is feasible in reality.
In the books they'll often send out multiple birds to different towns carrying messages (think Stannis sending out his claims of Joffrey being born of incest). Based on what you've written, the only way this would be possible would be if he had a collection of pigeons caged who's homes were scattered across the world. (i.e. he's got one from King's Landing, from Winterfell, from Highgarden, etc.)
Even if that was true, they would be only good for one use... once they delivered their message home, they would simply remain home (you couldn't use them for two-way correspondence).
Anyways, I had always thought that sending messages on birds was completely fantasy but you've now shown that the concept is at least partially grounded in reality. Cool.

Here was another Redditor, Sooniln's, point which I thought brought up an awesome concept:

&gt; On the contrary, I think that as long as you assume that GoT ravens are an analogue for homing pigeons, it makes quite a bit of sense. Given that ravens are the only long distance method of communication, and thus incredibly important to the economic and political state of the kingdoms, it makes incredible sense to have a raven breeding program at every strategic location which regularly ships ravens off to other locations. I imagine the maesters having cages full of ravens, one cage per important city/castle. There would be a constant trade in pigeons, since information is always king. True, GRRM never mentions it explicitly, but given how extensively pigeons have been used in this exact way in real history, it makes perfect sense in GoT.

But other than that, he didn't really do much. Am I mistaken? The only scheming he did was mostly against Cersei and it was not nearly as well done as things Baelish and Varys have done (or am I unfair in comparing him against those two?) In fact, he got quite lucky, in my opinion, against Pycelle and I doubt it would ever happen again. The only reason he had ANY sort of power was because of Tywin allowing him to be Hand to the King in his stead, and now that Tywin has reclaimed the position he is at the bottom again. He did do some great things, like the defense of King's Landing and whatnot, but I wouldn't call military strategy apart of the backroom game.

Reminiscing back on something Varys said about power - ""It's a trick; a shadow on the wall"" and it very much was in Tyrion's case.

I haven't read the books, yet, so could anyone enlighten me or offer a counter-argument?

(book spoilers),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/ursyj/why_the_jeynetalisa_switch_book_spoilers/,ta112233,1339174465,"Now that the season is over, I'd like to discuss what everyone thinks about the intention behind the Jeyne/Talisa switch.  Like others, I was waiting for her true identity to be revealed as a Lannister cousin or something.  But it appears she actually is Talisa.  Why change the character for no apparent reason?

To me, the Jeyne route is much more interesting.  Her family is sworn to House Lannister, so there's lots of political considerations at play.  There's also the subtle seeds of discontent brewing among the Westerling family regarding the union.  This could make for good drama and foreshadowing.  Also, in the book, while Robb loves Jeyne, he realizes that he acted rashly by marrying her.  It was (at least partly) done out of honor because he had already slept with her.  This lends more characterization to Robb, in that his sense of honor truly makes him his father's son.

But having the character be some random chick from Volantis seems like such a waste.  If anything, it makes Robb look even stupider for betraying the Freys for some exotic hot piece of tail.  At least with Jeyne he could make the case of trying to forge new alliances or something.

Also, I find it curious they even bothered working in talking about The Crag if she isn't truly Jeyne.  Maybe her actual identity is yet to be revealed? *puts on tin foil hat*

To me it just seems the Jeyne angle is much more exciting and full of dramatic potential.  Why the change? ",60,44,False,self,,,,,

Either way, I am 27 years old and up until yesterday I had never read an ENTIRE book before (I have no idea how I graduated college doing this). 

I started watching Game of Thrones, and really loved it. Now that the second season ended, I was really left with the desire to not only see what happened next, but to figure out what it is about the books that many of the people on this subreddit continuously rave about. 

Now I haven't read any of the GoT series yet, as they look intimidatingly long and I was worried if I had tried starting a really long book I would get discouraged. So about 5 days ago I started with something simple, The Hobbit. Last night I finished it, and I was barely able to put it down the entire time I read it. I'm going to take a break from the fantasy genre now, and try reading through another decently short book Ender's Game. After that the goal is to start on this epic tale. So thank you to EVERYONE here and especially GRRM for creating a series that had inspired me to start up a new hobby I had previously seen as overwhelmingly boring.

I can think of good ones for all the characters except for Arya.

My reason being that I'm expecting RW is gonna be episode 7 or 8, and Arya doesn't do much after that. She has her time with the Hound, findiing Needle, stabbity stab stab, then leaving for Bravvos. Her setting sail for Bravvos is such a great way to end a season with her, and even better, think of the season 4 opening titles screen-DAT TITAN.

 D &amp; D have shown that they can stretch out a storyline if they need to, and she can start her AFfC storyline in season 4.

I have read the first two books, and obviously, have loved them all. But there was one thing that always killed me when I read, I could almost never keep track where everyone was and what their plot was so far in the story. I am now reading it in my own specific way that I have found very helpful to me and lets me keep track of where everyone is and what they are doing.
  
 I chose to read Jon Snow and all of the characters beyond the wall, not because they are my favorite characters, but because they are cut off mostly from the political and emotional story lines of Winterfell and King's Landing. This allowed me to read through the book fully while understanding fully what was going on with my characters and didn't spoil what I hadn't read.
  
Then, I decided to read Arya and Bran, because they are still cut off more or less from the storylines of Robb, Catelyn, Sansa, Tyrion, Jaime, and Cersei. I have not finished the book yet and I would appreciate some other new ways to read the book.",8,0,False,self,,,,,

I've seen a lot of chatter around Reddit about how people think HBO should have some kind of online pay method to watch their shows (like ""Game of Thrones"") and avoid cable subscriptions.  I thought Reddit user ""exasperis"" did a good job explaining why that was a bad idea in this thread:  http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/uo6vz/newly_launched_website_takemymoneyhbocom_wants_to/ ...

That said, can someone explain why there isn't more Game of Thrones merchandise?  My girlfriend collects action figures.  I found it a little surprising that there weren't ""Game of Thrones"" action figures available.  I know action figures are usually for kids, and the show is pretty adult, but I think there is definitely a collector's market.  I'm pretty sure i've seen action figures for shows like ""Walking Dead"", ""24"" and ""Lost"" that I never really associated with kids.  What's up with that?  

Is it just something that HBO has no interest in?  This show in particular is probably the most ""action figure"" friendly television franchise they've ever had... tho I'm pretty sure if they had ever made a limited edition figure of Omar from ""The Wire""... a few people would have bought it.

Watching the season finale again, things started coming together. 

[Question](/g ""Is Dany mad just like Aerys' and the other Targaryens before her?"")

[Evidence](/s ""I can forgive almost everything up to and including walking into the funeral pyre, since a strong case can be made that she aimed to kill herself and the birth of the dragons was an unforeseen advantage of the three deaths and Dany's sacrifice. However, following the events at the end of Clash of Kings, Dany's judgement gets more and more clouded."")

[](/s ""She begins by following a comet thinking that it will lead her to her destiny. Okay, again, early stages of scientific discover in Westeros and Essos. Hell, we still find people who think comets are omens. I can overlook that. The way she interacts with Jorah, though, gets more and more erratic. She goes from feeling sorry for him to striking him, from ignoring him completely to suddenly feeling overjoyed that he gave her counsel. For instance, when Jorah is advising her to go to Astapor she is adamantly opposed to it, and suddenly her eyes light up and she decides it's a good idea where two lines earlier she was completely opposed to the prospect and wanted to hear nothing more. In astapor, she plays the slaver for a fool and sets him *on fire* a la Aerys Targaryen."")

[In the TV series,](/s ""the way she burned Pyatt Pree and imprisoned her handmaiden and Daxos in the vault gave me pause as well. Granted, they both had it coming and it was satisfying to watch Pyatt die and Daxos get locked up, but the coldness in her demeanor during those scenes, juxtaposed with her compassion and queasiness seeing Mirri's people slaughtered and raped, makes me feel that GRRM and, at his urging, the show writers, are trying to set her up as a new mad queen."")

Unfortunately not much else has happened. I'm assuming she's a POV character later on and I get to see more of her, but I'm starting to get a pretty uneasy vibe when I read her chapters and GRRM highlights her thought processes. ",38,14,False,self,,,,,

The price I pay helps pay for high quality shows that for the most part blow away things on network and basic cable tv. 

This whole movement that is demanding HBO to ""take their money"" (an arbitrary amount determined to be fair by whoever started the site) or else  they'll have no choice but to pirate the show makes no sense. You may enjoy the show but you have no inalienable ""right"" to see it. You pay for that right. You pay the price the market demands. Or else you're stealing and making people like me foot the bill for the content. 

It's a classic free rider problem and it makes me furious. If no one paid (everyone pirated) we wouldn't get the Sopranos, Game of Thrones, the Wire etc. 

I'm not a conservative or a capitalist zealot but I simply cannot understand why stealing something just because you don't feel like paying for it is condoned or even some cases celebrated. Pay for the channel or don't want your favorite shows.

Just to name a few. 

I think if Bethesda were to grab ASOIAF and use whatever engine Skyrim ran on, they could make a fantastic game (and for the love of the gods, put multi-player in).

Not really  a question more of a rant. Yes, I realize that there is a RPG of Game of Thrones, I thought it was very lackluster. Fans tell me to look past the voice acting and horrible character modeling but that's like reading ASOIAF in comic sans or wingdings.",39,4,False,self,,,,,

My idea was to use a sigil of one of the Houses on each of the volumes. I would like the sigil to correspond somehow with the story. I have found a printer able to print anything from a file onto canvass. Then I'm going to use [this tutorial](http://jamesdarrow.deviantart.com/?offset=0#/d4tznw2) to bind the books. 
The edition I have consists of 8 volumes so far: 1. *AGoT*, 2. *ACoK*, 3. *ASoS* part I, 4. *SoS* part II, 5. *AFfC* part I, 6. *AFfC* part II, 7. *ADwD* part I, 8. *ADwD* part II. 
Now I can't make my mind which sigils should go where. I have some initial ideas but I would love to hear some suggestions from you. I have some basic photoshopping skills and I was going to use some wallpapers which I found on this subreddit but links to other hi-res pictures of sigils are welcome. I promise to update with some photos of the finished books. **Thanks!**",7,1,False,self,,,,,

(Spoilers, possibly all books)",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/uui3t/events_that_occurred_in_the_books_but_not_in_the/,CountDerpington,1339330523,"I thought it would be nice if we could discuss this in a thread, since I've been seeing a lot of people who have stated their discontent with some of the show's deviations, and how they fear that some events which take place in the books might not ever happen now because the show deviated too much by killing off a character, or simply changing the whole event. 

A good example of this is Arya; ''Is there gold in the village? Where is the brotherhood? Etc.'' This confrontation might not ever happen now. Unless they use Polliver for this, maybe? (I'm not a hundred percent sure if he's still alive in the show, though, so please correct me if he isn't)

Another thing is the House of the Undying. I understand that the prophetic imagery you're exposed to in the books would not translate too well on the show, simply because it reveals too much when seen directly on screen. However, they did leave out her warning about treasons, the 'fires she would light' and the 'mounts' she would ride. (user NewDrekSilver made a post about this not being included in the show, and observed how these warnings do play a big part in Dany's character development later on, because of her trust issues and such)

This got me thinking, they would have to include these warnings somehow, would they not? Maybe the first episode of season three will show her sailing towards Slaver's Bay, but before she boards the ships Quaithe might appear and give her these warnings instead. It would fit with the current theme in the show where Quaithe appeared to warn Jorah, and since she has not yet revealed herself to Daenerys, this would be a good way to go about it I reckon. 


So, what deviations happened that you think will get filled in later by another character or turn of events or such?

Then, after I probably cry again through a few of the scenes, I'll pick up the book and start reading. 

Luckily, I just received the first 4 books last Monday and started reading. Depending on how things (my GoT addiction) go, I hope to read the books twice and re-watch both seasons. 

I had an easier time getting over The Walking Dead season ending! In all honesty, if Daryl was killed off, I'd tire of it quickly, but with GoT, everyone could die and I'd still watch!

Now I understand what's with all the Tyrion hype around here, he's a total bad ass. I wished I could have been standing next to him at the Mud Gate when Joffrey fled so I could tell him after his pep talk, ""Today, milord, you're the tallest man in King's Landing.""

I hope this gets Peter Dinklage an award nod (if it has, I dunno, I haven't followed GOT til lately) or lots of roles, 'cause this guy's got some serious acting chops--I can't say I remember seeing a man of his stature with such an arresting marquee role since *Willow* that didn't have the actor under twenty pounds of prosthetic makeup. Unless I'm mistaken, he's got front billing on the opening credits and he absolutely deserves it, IMHO.

I almost broke up when Shay came to see him after the battle and told him she wasn't leaving. I've experienced that sort of gutwrench you could see on his face when it hit him, on top of getting shit on for holding the Mud Gate until Lannister got there, and I recognized it. It's not often you see an actor convincingly weep on camera, and that was fucking *it.* If you happen to see this, Pete, bravo, man. That totally moved me. I wanted to give you a hug too.

[Possible tv/book spoilers],https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/uwabm/a_question_from_a_worried_nonreader_about_magic/,HiggsBozo,1339430074,"I have watched and read the first two season/books of the series, but will not be reading ahead, at this point.  That could change depending on the answer to the question I have.  

I'm worried about the ""magic"" aspect of the storyline.  For me, magic is an ""easy out"" for writers sometimes.  If a character is stuck in a tough situation the author could easily invoke magic and get them out of the situation.  Sometimes it cheapens the story, in my opinion.  Which is why I curious how much magic there is going forward.  

Does it become a major part of the story going forward?  

I really enjoy the character development and rational parts of the story.  Tyrion is a perfect example of what I am talking about: he's able to get out of tough situations with a logical and pragmatic way of thinking.  But, how is he suppose to ""think"" his way out of an arctic zombie (white walkers) or people being able to change faces?  

Don't get me wrong, I think there is a place for magic in the show.  I just fear that if it becomes a major plot development tool I am going to lose interest in the story, or at least lose my appreciation for how well everything else develops.  

I understand it's a fantasy novel, there's dragons, white walkers, warlocks, but so far they've kind of been on the outskirts of the show, which I like (they're not a prominent role in the overall story--it's mainly about characters and their interactions).  

Maybe this kind of show/book series is just not for me, which is entirely possible since I am not a big fantasy fan in general.  

So, in a general sense, without spoiling major plot points, how does magic progress in the books and ultimately the tv show?  ",7,2,False,self,,,,,

I did done bought the 2nd book ASAP. Yeah it's not as shocking as the first was (or maybe it is just as shocking, but I've already been shocked so it doesn't work that way anymore). 

To the person who told me that book 2 felt like a big build up to book 3 - if that's true then tickle my funny beard - 3rd book is gonna shake the whole world! Cause srsly, 2nd is so good.

I've almost finished reading the 2nd book (page 593 out of ~under 700) so I wanted to share some thoughts with anyone who cares maybe... **sorry if I spelled any names / names of locations wrong**
[Daenerys and her Dotrakians and other folks why not](/b ""I'm not sure I like where Daenerys story went. It feels like it's just there to water down the massive events in Westeros and behind the wall... I mean book 1 ended with dragons, FUCKING DRAGONS being born. And fuck, I almost cried when she killed Drogo -.-'..... but now, well, it's slow I guess. Though they did mention that the fire trickster could build his ladder higher and the guys who made living fire for Tyrion said that magic has returned maybe(?) well, I'm hoping that this will pick up the pace a bit, in the future of reading"")


[Vesteros](/b ""About what's going on in Westeros - I LOVE IT. Tyrion from the start was one of my favorite characters, and now that there are no definite good guys (I think when Ned Stark died - there were no more good guys left in Westeros) everyone is pretty much pursuing their own selfish desires - I root all hands for Tyrion! He tries to do good to people, he really does, and I wish him luck. I'm afraid of Stannis and his fire priestess... That description of the events under the Storm Keep (where Davos took her in a boat on a river).... that's some scary stuff right there. AND! The best event in the book so far - the retaking of Harrenhall with Aria Stark in the middle, HOLY FUCK! Now that's excitement over the edge man... I can't wait to find out if she ever meets that man again, whoever he was! The author really knows how to captivate me."")

[And about Jon behind the wall](/b ""I like where it's going. I just barely got past the part where he didn't kill the girl (what's her name) and I think that this will cause major shit for the whole Nightwatch... And I have no doubts that it will be as interesting read as I can imagine (maybe even more so)"")


Well that's it for my thoughts. Thanks for reading (maybe), and I wanna say thanks to all of you for just being a community as is. I'm not participating in it too much, but just knowing that there are thousands of people who enjoy these books as much as I do - makes me feel like my insignificant life is a bit more significant, because I'm a part of something bigger than me and we share the same passion.



On a side note - I have purchased all 4 books in russian. 5th book is in the process of being translated and the publisher promises to release it this summer. I hope it will be released just as soon as I finish reading the 4th :) 

This is how the books in russian look like - http://imgur.com/a/qqK9m 
From left to right - Storm of Swords, Feast for Crows Game of Thrones, Clash of Kings. The original translation dates back to 2000 (game of thrones) and 2007 (feast for crows), but the books were re-released with new covers due to sudden rise in popularity (I wonder why......) There is also one more print available, those books had drawn artwork on covers, better readable font and had pages laced with drawings/sketches of the events. But those books are more expensive (~6$ per book more expensive) so I decided to stick with these. 

On a side side note - this is the ultimate device I use for reading http://imgur.com/a/MFq1A (no hipster...)


Thanks for reading.

Much has been said about the peculiar climate cycles of Westeros, and while several hypotheses which might account to various degrees as to how such a complex aperiodical climatic cyclicity as is ascribed to this fictional country might arise, little has been said as to the nature of Westeros itself. Herein is a list of various constraints which much be accounted for in any explanation as to the state of affairs such as described in this fictional environment. Several hypotheses might be put forth as a result, but they will have to account for the presence of humans and certain familiar species, as well as other element, on a planet which is clearly not Earth. We will also point out a few implications of these observations as to some more likely theories.

Fair warning: Im currently reading the first book of the series and there are undoubtedly still more things to notice and factor in. Please no spoilers.

Flora and fauna

Lice are present on Westeros. Theories which invoque interstellar colonisation will have to explain why the colonists chose to bring human-specific parasites which otherwise add nothing to the local ecology.

Some faunal associations, while they consist of typical Earth species, have no earthly equivalent. Example: lemurs + tigers + elk, There is nowhere on Earth outside of a zoo where these three species co-exist.

The following earth animals are present (list is non exhaustive): Raven, crow, pigeon, dove, chicken, horse, birds of prey, stag, cow, goat, dog, wolf, lion, sheep, trout, lemur, tigers, cats, elk, flies, butterflies.

Some animals have no terrestrial equivalent, notably dragons and manticores. These appear quite unrelated to the earth-typical animals, all the way down to the nature of their skeletal material which is blackish. The same can be said of plants such as weirwoods which are unfortunately named but not described except inasmuch as they are a source of woody material.

Some species are conspicuously absent: mosquitoes

The following earth plants are present: oak, pine, spruce, ironwood, poppies, wheat, barley, oats, etc.

No fossils of known earth species are mentioned. On the other hand, fossilised dragon eggs are known.

Overall, the fauna and flora of Westeros seems to consist of two co-existing populations. The dominant one consists of a somewhat abbreviated recently installed earth-normal group of species with no fossil equivalents. The other one has no living Earth counterpart but is shown by fossil evidence to have existed on Westeros for along time. This suggests colonisation, and possibly terraforming, of a pre-existing biosphere by humans.

Population and society

There seems to be a historical distinction between first men and the current inhabitants. The first men seem to have been able of some technical and technological feats which cannot be matched by later Westerans. People residing north of the Wall claim to be first men, but have little proof of such to show. Otherwise, the distinction between former and later people is not readily apparent.

Ethnic representation in Westeros seems to show a disproportionate presence of Caucasians, despite an abundance of character and racial descriptions. Very few people who could resemble African, East Asian, Melanesian or American Native descendants are present.

For a society without advanced medical care, the population seems surprisingly devoid of contagious diseases. This is in surprising contrast to the presence of human-specific parasites. Furthermore, with a few exceptions such as Tyrion Lannisters nanism or Hodors idiocy (the latter might not be genetic), genetic handicap also appears to have a very low incidence. But then, if there has been a selection process to clean up the gene pool and preferentially select certain races, why keep lice?

The wall is plainly stated to be a constructed artefact; one is however curious as to where the material it was built from was obtained. There should be a lot of empty quarries in northern Westeros, yet none are mentioned.

Climate

Much has been said of Westeran climate, mostly focussing on orbital mechanics and the type of solar system dynamics which might explain the irregular climate cycles. I am tempted to add another dimension I have not seen explored: large scale changes in atmospheric composition due to frequent but irregular volcanic activity. One would have to distinguish an annual rotational year from an irregular greenhouse gas driven mega-seasonal cycle. Episodic volcanic pulses could, I suppose, release large amounts of CO2 or even methane into the atmosphere which would bring the overall seasonal climate into hothouse mode for several regular years. There would then be a progressive return to winter once the excess CO2 was mopped up by oceanic algae and sequestered on the ocean floor. Or it might equally work by pulsed oxygen release, mutatis mutandi.

Geology

No active plate boundaries are noted and surface volcanoes are not mentioned. Nothing is known, however, of the ocean floor and of submarine volcanism or lava plains. Plate tectonics are thus probably not in action.

While the level of technology in evidence is consistent with the Iron Age, very little is mentioned about mining or about where metals are obtained. Whether this is due to mineral rarity or to technical lack of sophistication is unclear. It is worth noting that iron seems precious and somewhat rare, which might reflect on this. Perhaps there are no iron mines at all and forges are supplied from bog iron. Furthermore, no hydrocarbons such as oil, gas or coal are mentioned, but as with the mines, it is unclear whether this reflects ignorance or absence. One surmises that coal would be a sought after commodity among northerners, should it be either known or available. Rarity of fossil fuels should also take into account the peculiar fossil record of Westeros, which might not be amenable to the preservation of carbon.

Magic

The presence of magic takes many shapes and is as a rule difficult to explain. This would however be true in any planetary context, so the presence of magic in Westeros thus presents no special difficulty in that it is no harder to explain away magic in Westeros that it would be on Earth. I will thus examine a few instances which appear magical through comparison with terrestrial equivalents, but will stop short of assigning them direct physical causation.

Zombies: Westeran zombies bring a peculiar twist to the tradition version. They show no assotiation to ritual, such as in voudoun or santeria traditions. Neither is any obvious relationship to contagion or disease suggested. The main factor appears to be death north of, or close to, the Wall. Also, independent movement of severed limbs is permitted and westeran zombies appear particularly vulnerable to fire. No explaination is suggested; could zombification be due to bacteria in northern soil? Who knows?

Best casts in my opinion:

Tywin Lannister 
Cold glances, great piercing eyes, I catch myself squirming when he's on screen. This is a rare case when the actor is better than I'd imagined his character. 

Ned Stark
-Sean Bean. Of course. 

Renly Baratheon
-I had trouble picturing him in the book. I felt the show satisfied this character well: likable, narcissistic, and naive. 

Arya Stark
-while the actress is older than I imagined, she's a spunky, upstart little whippersnapper. 


Worst Cast:

Sandor Clegane - Rather than being frightened by his viciousness, I'm bored to death. Where is the chip on his shoulder? Where's the jaded nihilism? Where's the snarling ferocity? The biggest disappointment.

Varys - In the book I feel like he's a viper with a smile for a mask. In the show, he's just a fat whiny guy. He doesn't inspire any particular feeling. 

Asha Greyjoy - I thought she'd be a sexy marauding pirate, vindictive and clever. In the show, the only description that comes to mind is homely and bitchy. ",13,4,False,self,,,,,

And I happened to look upon the story of line house Martel. I had completely forgotten that [First book/season](/b ""Arya's wolf's namesake was a Warrior Queen that helped (her doing more work, or so how it makes it seem) build one of the strongest kingdoms that could have never been conquered by force."")

Just thought I'd drop this in =P

Jeez, okay, if you insist, I'll go on then =P So what I've seen a recurring theme within the series/franchise is the importance of sex (not *sex*, even though that is QUITE a recurring theme) and gender-roles.

Obviously we can tell that gender is of quite importance in Westeros, with all the rapping, marrying off daughters to get richer, and so on and so forth. 

We can also tell that nearly every single female that is a main-character goes through it; Catelyn, Daenerys, Brienne, even Cersei, as in the second book, [ACOK](/b ""when Tyrion is pulling his little trick where he sends of Myrcella and tells different stories to Littlefinger, Varys, and Pycell. Pycell says that ruling the realm must be hard on her, or rather, it went more like this, '''...it is no small thing, to tend to all the cares of the realm, despite the frailty of her sex''' (265)."")

Or even in the council where they claimed [Season 1, book 1](/b ""Robb as King in the North. Catelyn tried to reason with the lords for peace with the Lannisters, but they just said to her, '''You are a woman, my lady'...'Women do not understand these things''' (664). Of course she replied with one of my favorite lines uttered in this book; '''Give me Cersei Lannister...and you would see how *gentle* a woman can be''' (664)."")

But, of course, the one that seems to struggle and be more aware of the sexist world that she lives in is, other than Brienne, none other than Arya [the badass of Westeros](http://hbowatch.com/arya-stark-the-most-badass-girl-on-t-v/) (Good article, read later on if more interested).

We all know how Arya is, so I won't go into a long-winded post about how badass she is, so I'll just continue onward. My question to you all, or what's better known as...

**The TL;DR**: Obviously GRRM includes sexism as an obstacle for the women in this book, rather than an ideal that he feels should be pushed on women. [Character development](/s ""However, do you think that he should make more of the characters be like Arya and Brienne where they are fully aware and try to change the way Westeros runs, which is patriarchal, and some strive to make it more equal *or* more matriarchal?"") 

Omg, long rant. It seems school does teach you something. I find it ironic that I put it to use on reddit, however =P
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
* Hmph...I don't know why, but for some reason I felt like this would put my sex into question. I am male, but I just get interested on the views of women when it comes to sexism. Of course, those of my own sex are welcomed to lend their voice to the call.

I noticed the recent hype about GoT and wanted to start reading the books after loving the show. Even though I watched both seasons in english without subtitles and didn't had any real problems doing so, I'm worried that the english books might be too ""difficult"" to read. (lots of words I'd need to look up and things like that) 
So I deliberate whether I should stick to english or go for the translated books. Can anyone comment on the translation im terms of how well written and accurate they are? (In my case it would be the german version)

&gt;Friend is completely in denial after having read the Red Wedding. His texts are pure gold.

&gt;Friend: Oh. Um wedding, random people acting moody bending starts everyone bounces for boobs and then Walder is like cool, shoot everyone else. And then Catelyn cuts a retards head off, for crazy and then gets her own throat cut.

Me: You're taking it pretty well.

&gt;Friend: I mean, I knew terrible things happened in this book, I figured one Stark would actually have to die instead of the fake deaths of Bran and Rickon. Also, they've made a point of Walder being incredibly prideful so something was bound to happen at the wedding. I didn't really think it would be death, I thought something might happen as Catelyn went to Seaguard but oh well.

Me; But what about ROBB?!

&gt;Friend: I don't beleive he is dead. I mean even for ASOIAF Catelyn and Robb dying at the same time seems a bit much. Plus Robb seemed a bit moody right before that I feel he knew something.

At this point I was literally crying from laughter. I don't know why I found this so funny, as I harbored feelings of denial until it was made blatantly obvious that shit had gone down. Anyone else have friends who have trouble stomaching the hard truths of ASOIAF?",10,0,False,self,,,,,

What was on the effing throne? Does anyone know what was on the throne that Dany was going to pick up? 

All I saw was something covered in snow/frost with three rounded knobs, one of which seems to have a dragon etched into it beneath the snow. If it's not a dragon tail you can see, it's one of the Greyjoy kraken tentacles. There was also some sort of spike coming out from nearby, I think?

The seasons are different (summer &amp; winter) because they take longer, which might be an indicator of a bigger (future) orbit. The geography is different, but perhaps this is a result of continental drift. The inhabitants are mostly the same as us today, but there appears to be some physical mutations in some characters. There are ""magical"" things that happen, but any advanced technology will appear to be magic... such as, dragons might be created in our near future through genetic experiments, then breed for countless millenia until they nearly died out, but the last eggs were given to, um, that hot chick (sorry, idk her name). 
Anyway, this show strikes me as a dystopian civilization on Earth in the very far future, am I totally wrong here? If I am, please tell me why, so I understand. Or is this correct, and no one bothered to mention it to me yet?

[non book reader],https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/uzqn9/a_gripe_about_daeneryss_story_line_non_book_reader/,theJavo,1339592261,"Ok I have not read the books, yet. But plan too. And I know this is all part of a bigger story line so there may very well be answers to my questions later in the story.

But why are Jorah and Daenerys so horny to get to Westeros? I mean do they really think 3 baby dragons and a handful of half starved dothraki are going to be enough to take the iron throne? 

The way I see it the the obsessive quest for a ship is pointless at the moment. Her forces are small and weak as are her dragons. But in this search fortune has smiled on the mother of dragons. the honorable Zardos Zohan Ducksauce(yes i misspelled it on purpose) staged a coup in Qarth to take the city as its King in an plan to sue Dany's dragons to build and empire. In the process of getting them back Dany toppled King Ducksauce of Qarth. 

Why didn't she take the the city? it was hers to take. She could have had Qarth one of the richest cities in the world to build resources and an army and a treasury to fund a war. she could have built and army, of Qartheen and Dothraki gotten horses for her Dothraki horsemen. then when her army is big enough, she is rich enough to buy some westeros men, and her dragons are big and strong enough she could sail to westeros and ride and fly across the seven kingdoms  the iron throne back for the Targaryen.

But no what does she seemingly do? raid Ducksauce's house and sell the valuables to by a boat  so her baby dragons and dozen starved Dothraki can go do what Stannis  with a an over whelming number of men and ships and allegedly the the fire god could not do. Granted she doesn't know that but She can't be that dumb and naive to believe she will walk into kings landing with her meager force and take it.",101,50,False,self,,,,,

Barristan Selmy takes out Jaqen in one of the most controversial battles. 
Khal Drogo tears the throat out of the Knight Of Flowers finding a way to overcome the advantage of superior armor.
Jamie Lannister shows the world that his claim that there are very few men in the world who could best him in a 1 on 1 battle holds true as he takes out a very skilled opponent in Bronn
In the closest battle of them all... The first sword of Braavos Syrio Forel finds a way to overcome odds and best The Hound in what some consider a major upset. 

Round 3 holds many interesting matchups. Can Syrio find success vs. Barristan Selmy or will the experienced knight take out the dancing man from Braavos? Will Khal Drogo show himself to be one of the few men in the world who can best the Kingslayer or will the superior armor and skillset of Ser Jamie Lannister be enough to defeat the greatest Khal of them all?

1. Post a picture of yourself from any age/look in your life.
2. Compare it to who you look like the most in GoT.

That's about it really, not sure why there was a need to number it.

To get it started I'll post three of myself from different ages.

I have been told you dont need to read the books to enjoy the show and that they are both very good but as I will be going on vacation soon I would like something to do.  So how are the books?  It seems to me that due to the epic nature of the show and the huge multitude of characters, they would be a very intense but worth it read a la The Hobbit/ Lord of the Rings.  Is this true? And just how good are they? lol     Lastly, if I am watching the show and reading the books at the same time, will it become too confusing?  or should I read the books separately from watching it.

But lets be honest here, the actual content of season 2 compared to season 1 was confusing, scattered, seemingly less important, and less interesting. Around episode 3 or 4, a bunch of people I know stopped watching religiously week after week and decided to just ""catch up"" on it later.

I myself am a book reader, but looking through the perspective of just a show watcher, I could see how they'd be disappointed. The whole season is kinda like a drumroll to a climax that doesn't ever happen.

**HERE BE SPOILERS**

""War is coming and it's going to be awful""--only really see one battle (Blackwater Bay, in episode 9)

""My dragons will grow and I'm gonna kick all kinds of ass in Westeros""--Dragons get kidnapped and aren't really seen

""We're gonna find out what's going on north of the wall""--Like 8 episodes of wandering around, followed by Jon quickly getting kidnapped at the end. 

""I'm going to give the people of King's Landing justice""--Doesn't show the majority of his political moves that end up saving Kings Landing. 

Now, I don't wanna sound like I'm down on the show, cause I'm not. I love it. But I think we can also agree that people who only watch might have lost some if not a lot of their excitement. ",20,0,False,default,,,,,

Some names are common or known to us, like Robert. Some are slight variations on names we know, like Joffrey/Jeffrey.

I'm quite curious as to how he came up with these names and whether they're references to common names or did he invent them wholesale, like Loras.

I love the fact that the names are so believable and fit right into the world that he created and don't detract from the story at all.

I've done a fair bit of googling using various terms and haven't found anything close to being on point, so I'm turning to this sub for help.

Patience is not a virtue so I decided to finally take the plunge and read the books (no way I'm waiting a year to see what happens). 

Went to WHSmiths today, because that's how British I am, and brought ""A Game Of Thrones"" which is obviously the first one and also brought ""Game OF Thrones 2: A Clash Of Kings"". Now I know it is suppose to be A Game Of Thrones followed by A Clash Of Kings, so am I right to assume that the ""A Game Of Thrones 2"" part is just added on and this is the 2nd book in the series. 

I know this is very nit pickery and what not but just wanted confirmation.

Samwell reaches Oldtown and we learn that the sphynx(whom has pale skin and a lock of blond hair *draw arrow to what was in the chest here*) has sought out to see Sam, knowing that he has knowledge - that the other maesters would dismiss instantly apart from his Archmaester.

Some things you may find useful to know 1. this takes place before the events of the books/show so dragons are still alive and magic is fair game 2. I am using Rolemaster books(they're pretty much D&amp;D but no new issues have been made in a long time) 3. The players will be able to travel to Westeros and Essos 4. The story starts off with them in Dragonstone(since this is pre-rebellion it is a targaryen city).

No, seriously.  Go away.

Cool.  So.  With how things are currently sitting as of the end of DWD, how do you see the series ending?  Who holds the throne when all's said and done, and what happens with the Others?

It seems to me that Dany will likely be the one to route the Others with her dragons (presuming she survives the imminent attack), and who knows whether or not Jon's dead, but how do you see things shaking out in Westeros?  Does Dorne attack the Lannisters, or wait it out?  What of the Iron Islanders' arc?  It seems Tyrion will meet up with Dany, but do you see him aiding her against Cersei, et al?  How do you see Arya's place in the story, and where do you see the Littlefinger/Sansa arc going? Will Stannis ever do anything of note?

It's gonna be a *long* wait, so I figured we could bide our time with idle speculation.  GRRM has stated that the battles at Meereen and the wall will be resolved early in WoW, and has posted Theon's first chapter [here](http://georgerrmartin.com/if-sample.html).",12,2,False,self,,,,,

Game of Drinks
-----------------

What you need:
 Multiple beers
 Some form of hard alcohol
 Tools to shotgun

Rules:

1. ""Drinks a plenty""
 Whenever anyone drinks in GOT, everyone drinks (1 sip). This means 1 drink for every shot of someone drinking, it doesn't matter how many people drink in that shot but every time it cuts and someone drinks, everyone drinks, even if its the same angle. For example: 
1st shot - Medium-Wide angle shot Tyrion Lannister drinks = we drink
2nd shot - Close up angle shot Jamie Lannister drinks = we drink
3rd shot - Medium-Wide angle shot (same angle as before) = we drink

2. ""Boobs, a love/hate relationship""
Whenever you see boob(s), which only counts if you see nipple, everyone drinks. Same rule as ""Drinks a plenty""; if it cuts to a shot and you see boob(s) we drink, no matter if its an angle used before or not.

3. ""The elusive donger""
Whenever you see a penis, finish your drink. Ironically, we made this game only recently and I don't remember seeing any penises in earlier episodes but my girlfriend insists that she has seen at least three...either way, finish your drink.

4. ""Vertically challenged""
Every time anyone says the word ""Imp"" everyone takes a shot.

5. ""Mother of shotguns""
This rule can be bent a little bit. At first we said every time anyone says ""Mother of Dragons"" you have to shotgun a beer. However, we realized there are a few episodes that the phrase is said more times than most people can and want to shotgun so we changed it to the first time in an episode they say it.

6. ""Where does your allegiance lie?""
This is the last, and I think, the best rule. Before an episode starts everyone chooses a house name ie. Lannister, Stark, Baratheon, etc. Whenever a House name is said in GOT, whoever chose that name gets to give out a drink to whomever they want. Or you could make it that everyone except the person who chose that name has to drink.

That's it. Pretty simple, we made it up as we were watching and already pretty drunk but it's fun. Hope everyone enjoys!",6,36,False,self,,,,,

First, Jon Arryn was still murdered for what he knew.  Ned will still want to look into the pieces that led to his foster father's death.

Second, Lysa still wrote to Cat warning her about the Lannisters

Third, There is no end to Lannister (or Littlefinger) ambition.

Fourth: Dagrons.  

Bran's fall wasn't a spark, it was a catalyst.  The players all had their pieces on the board (Littlefinger, Cersei, Stannis, and player 4 Ned had just joined the game) but Bran stumbling on that forced the players to make a move sooner than they had been planning for otherwise.  

Had Bran not fallen, Cersei would still be trying to murder her husband to get her little shit on the throne.  Littlefinger would still be manipulating the system trying to get more for himself.  Stannis would still have known about Joffrey's parentage.  And Ned would still be walking into a snake-pit.

Due to a couple of you on this wonderful subreddit that pushed for me to continue trying to better myself after posting my first painting(ever) and my first drawing in 5 years I present to you my second attempt, this time of Arya Stark.

Unfortunately the scanner I have is garbage and could not accurately capture the shading, for that I apologize.

I hope this looks better to you than my previous, personally I think this is superior, enjoy everyone and thanks to those of you who told me to continue, this is for you guys :)

I tried to get her to read the english version of A Song of Ice and Fire, but she couldn't understand it as well as she wanted to, so she gave up on the book. I bought my mother the GoT Season 1 dvd set and gave it to her to watch with the Korean subtitles. She fell in love the series, and she wants more.

[This place seems like the only place where I can find the 'A Song of Ice and Fire' books in Korean, but each book comes out to around $50 a pop.](http://www.hanbooks.com/sooficeandfi.html)

I was wondering if anyone knew of a site/store that sells the Korean copy of 'A Song of Ice and Fire' (And maybe other novels/series such as the Kingkiller Chronicles, Mistborn, etc.)

tl;dr Where can I find translated versions of ASoIaF without having to pay $50-70 per book?

The White Walker we see in the season 2 finale looks kind of similar, but not what I was expecting. It looked very frail, and almost weak.

The Tyrells show up here and there--Ser Loras at the tournament, Margaery at Renly's side, etc. Never major players, just seat fillers until Storm of Swords when suddenly the Tyrells and Highgarden are revealed as major players in the game of thrones. 

Or so I thought. Rewatching season one while reading the books, I noticed that the Tyrells are kinda badass at manipulation. Loras, following the tourney of the Hand, remains at King's Landing and atempts to get Robert to cast Cersei aside and install his sister as the new queen; In the TV series, Loras is the one to convince Renly to make a play for the throne before Stannis ascends when Robert dies; When Robert dies and Renly titles himself king, Margaery marries him after Loras convinces his father to support Renly's claim with the armies of the South, since Renly has the best chance of taking and keeping the throne, and then when Renly dies and war comes to King's Landing, it's Ser Loras who requests that Joffrey marry Margaery to solidify relations between Casterly Rock and Highgarden. After the Purple Wedding, Margaery gets betrothed to Tommen to keep relations strong but also to keep her house in the royal court to work their schemes. Plus, Olenna Redwyne tries to marry Sansa off to Willas Tyrell so the Tyrells can stake a claim on the North following the destruction of King's Landing.

Mind blown, man. Before about an hour ago I had no notion that the Tyrells were major players in the game of thrones, but now I see they've been behind the scenes pretty much the whole time and doing a much better job of it than any house thus far. Seriously thought they were just another house that wouldn't have much consequence, like house Mormont. Now I'm [thinking](/g ""we'll have a Tyrell on the throne before the dragons come to Westeros."")",19,8,False,self,,,,,

I turned my coffee table into a map of Westeros that I am going to hang on my wall. It is 5ft by 2ft in size. 

A breakdown of time spent on this: 
10 hours to draw it 
13 hours to burn it with a wood burning kit 
1.5 hours to sand it 
8 hours total to mask off each section 
2 hours to apply both stains 

A total of 34.5 hours spent. 

I hope you enjoy it, I had fun making it (I just have to apply a matte finish and hang it) and wanted to share it with you guys.

We are left with the impression that he is dead, but I think he is not. The reason is that we still don't know the identity of Jon's mother. GRRM said that it will play important part in the plot. So, if knowing Jon's mother is important then Jon must be important. Jon maybe dead, but resurrected later. Catelyn was resurrected after her throat was cut.

It could be that killing Jon is GRRM's way to get Jon out his oath to the Night's Watch. The only way to be relieved from the Night's Watch is by death, so since Jon died he is no longer sworn to the Night's Watch.

Then Jon can head south to possibly kill Ramsay Bolton. I think Jon will then encounter Catelyn, who will reveal the identity of Jon's mother. ",32,4,False,self,,,,,

I never got that impression from the book. I know they were close and there were several mentions of how Renly was like a teacher and a mentor to Loras but i never thought them lovers.

I just finished the last episode of season 2 about an hour ago with my family. My brother and sister both read the books, my mom hasn't, and my dad, in his words, suffered through them.

As for my brother, sister and I, we loved them. 

I'll do a quick rundown of my mom and dad's views on the series.

Mom: ""I have no idea what in the hell is going on. It's just random scenes and people, and nothing is explained.""

Dad: ""Meh, there's nothing else on to watch.""

As for what my brother, sister and I feel...well. Read the following at your own risk, I'll give a straight up warning right here:

The TV show is unspeakably atrocious, and a trainwreck of both an adaptation and it fails at even it's basic purpose: to tell a story.

That's your warning. I'll definitely qualify that, but if you're not too into reading a detailed, and moderately passionate break down of the TV show, you can tab out to a different thread. I won't blame you, sometimes your just like a show and that's enough for you. I watch sci-fi original movies and don't give a shit, they're hilarious and entertaining, but also abominations when it comes to actual quality.

Now, for those of you that stuck around, here we go.

First of all, the show fails at it's primary goal: an adaptation. I know, I know, the automatic response is ""some things have to change for an adaptation. Y'know, it's an *adaptation*. Not a carbon copy of the original work."" I get that, really, I do. It'd be stupid to assume that the TV show will follow perfectly after the book.

Problem is, they (I'll use they as a catch-all for the showrunners/writers/directors whatnot) change an assload, but then don't take into account what the repurcussions will be. Case One: actor and character ages. So you're going to age all of the characters like a decade? Alright, I can dig it. Young, experienced actors that can believably carry some of the hefty roles would probably difficult to come by. (Ignoring the current quality of the actors, but that's to be addressed later). But the thing is, if you're going to change the ages of the characters, fucking realize the impact this will have on the story. A lot of people I've talked to hated Sansa in the show, because in the entire first season she came across as an obnoxious, bratty teenager. And this season, she had the whole subplot of her first period. Why is this ridiculous, and why do her character really rub people the wrong way? Because she's eleven goddamn years old in the book, that's why. In the show, she's a seventeen (another note, all ages are approximate on how they act, not literal actor biological age) year old acting like an eleven year old. No wonder her character is agonizing and poorly handled. In the books, she's a seriously brilliant character, and I love her POV chapters. She's extremely well developed, and a tragic person that you really feel bad for an empathise with. Because she's an eleven year old in a horrific situation that she has no idea how to deal with, and is entirely alone. But in the show, she's late teens. By this point, she should have a pretty decent idea of how the world works, and be a hell of a lot less, well, childish. But she's still written as an eleven year old. Then, the entire period subplot. It makes no sense and is jarring. Just cut it out of the TV show! It's not really all that necessary, especially considering everything else that's cut! 

Moving on to Rob. Oh boy. Rob. He's about mid twenties in the TV show. This is the worst. possible. thing. considering, again, how he's still written and handled like he's 15 year old Rob from the book. Him marrying Jayne or whatever the fuck they changed her name to in the TV show makes him like like a complete moron, *especially* because he talked to Catelyn beforehand. In the books, he's still a dolt, but it's utterly understandable, because he's 15, he's thrown into suddenly being King of the North, waging a war, and now he is being forced into a marraige. Oh, and his father just died, and his sisters are captives. He's 15. That's gonna mess you up. Then he goes and sleeps with Jeyne, and because he's 15, he falls in love, and because he's 15, AND a stark, he has the Stark honor and all, and he marries her impulsively. He's 15! Not in his mid-twenties, an age at which 1: he should be married and already a father, though I won't take issue with that, as they appear to know absolutely nothing about how life and society worked in that time period, 2: he would have been helping to rule Winterfell with Ned for at least a decade, and 3: he'd already be well versed in politics and the like. Then of course, his whole discussion with Catelyn beforehand in the TV show only contributes to making him look like a moron. If you're going to bump up their ages, then at least go all the way through with it, for christ's sake. Adapt the adaptation!

Jon bloody Snow. He's early-mid twenties too. And never had sex, apparently, and Ygritte is making a big fucking deal of it. Yeah, that's what she does in the book. But that's because he's 15 in the book, and it makes goddamn sense for him to not have had sex before. Not be early twenties, in that society's eyes a man for almost a decade, and, like I said with Rob, he should already be married and working on a family. So change it. Drop the sex subplot. Don't worry HBO, they can still bang and your tit quotient can be met. But otherwise, *fucking adapt it*. And he's still being written as a 15 year old as an early/mid-twenties guy, which again makes him out to be either a nimrod or extremely sheltered. Update his age, update his plot/dialogue. Not hard. On another note, when did Jon get his agency taken away? He stopped being an actor in his own story in Season 2, he sort of just is acted upon. Everything is outside of his control and he makes no decisions or frankly takes any real action beside what is forced on him. I have no idea how this Jon will be able to pull off the master badassery he does when he becomes the Lord fucking Snow in the later books and mans the hell up. Frankly, Kit Harrington is not a strong actor. 

Joffrey. The one everyone loves to hate. His issues go far beyond the simple age problems, but I'll save that for later so I can tie it in with everyone else. He's 12 in the books, and while he's definitely unbalanced, he's mostly petulant and spoiled. In the TV show, the way he's written he comes across as completely deranged and a sadist. Plus, with him running away at Blackwater, it makes him look weak, whereas as a 12 year old, running the hell away from a massive battle *makes sense* due to his age. 

NOW then. Changes to characters. Literal character changes. As in, who they are, how they act, etc.

Preface this: I'm ok with it. Shit will change in an adaptation.

Example: Tywin Lannister. I actually rather enjoyed how he was changed for the TV show. Not to say I prefer it, of course, but it made for an interesting character who was worth paying attention to. He was a lot more calm, and rather fatherly at times, as opposed to the unabashed ambitious prick he was in the books. But, it was decently handled (plus the actor could, y'know, act) and the change worked.

Another example: Jorah Mormont. Jorah in the book is a bit of a nimrod, and a rage-machine. Also, he's rather ugly. Ian Glen is not an ugly man at all (indeed, he parts were the few parts my siblings and I would stop talking and listen with rapt attention :P). Plus, he plays Jorah as a much more careful and centered individual, who genuinly seems to care about Dany for more than the fact that she looks just like his lost wife. But he's a good actor, his writing is good, and the change is decent and worth it.

Now, for the ones that aren't. 

Tyrion. This will be brief, but here's a noticable thing. After the battle of the Blackwater, when he gets slashed, all he has is a cut across his face. In fact, it's the quintessential 'badass' scar. Yet here they kept the lines from the book, about how he's disfigured, and a ""horrible monster"". I get that having his face get fucked up, and him lose his nose had to be cut! It's be a pain in the ass to deal with prostethics, and probably a bit of a budget drain. But for the love of god, update. the. flipping. dialogue.

Cersei. Oh jeebus. She got changed for real. Especially between S1 and S2. S1 she was sort of like book Cersei, in terms of self-assured arrogance and whatnot. Then, in S2 she takes a 180 to become, honestly, a really boringly written and half-assed acted depressed person who reveals (wat) that she thinks Joffrey is broken, and uncontrollable. Original Cersei would never have said that, or honestly, I doubt she'd even think it. But alright, this is adaptation, I'll go with it. But then, almost instantly, there she is threatening Tyrion with horrible death if anything should happen to Joffrey. Basically, just what she did in the book, but it directly contradicts what she said barely an episode ago, about how Joffrey is broken and stark raving nuts and uncontrollable and a horrible person. And now she's suddenly super-protective and loving him again? Be consistent! Adapt it and move on!

What I love about this series the most is that it is very easy to understand even though it goes through more than 10 character's perspective. How Harry Turtledove achieved that is with a list of characters. He listed all characters even the very minor ones that only appears for one page. Because of this, I can go back to the book and see who that character is. 

How Harry Turtledove did was listed all the characters in his series and gave a one sentence description of who each characters are. 

The problem with me reading Game of Thrones is that it has a lot of characters to follow through. Going back to re-read the character's paragraph description derails me from the story. However, if I try to read the story without knowing the character, I will be very confused to what is going on.

How the list works:

* Brandon Stark- Eddard Stark's 11 year old son. 

* Theon Greyjoy- Robb Stark's friend. Heir of Balon Greyjoy.

* Jorah Mormont- Daenerys Targaryen's close friend/bodyguard etc.

etc etc...

If there is a list like that, can someone link it to me. If not, anyone who is a really huge fan of Game of Thrones that has the time bother to make a list like that? Anyone who does will be greatly appreciated.

Wait! Rewatch the clip first. http://youtu.be/uI2WKeJpV8o

Now that you're pumped up, let's get down to business:

The King ""in"" The North, not The King ""of"" The North

On my birthday, my friends jokingly raised their drinks and shouted, ""The King of the North!"" to my honor.  Something felt wrong.

Later that night, I began to research the distinction between, ""of"" and ""in,"" in the styling of royal titles.  My research led me to the July Monarchy, where Louis-Phillipe of the House of Orlans reigned as, ""King of the French.""  The widely known King Louis XVI, the one that met the guillotine in Paris and you learned about in High School, had previously reigned as, ""King of France.""  

Notice the distinction?  Louis-Phillipe styled himself, ""King of the French"" in order to distinguish himself from the previous unconstitutional monarchy by claiming his title from the power of the ""people,"" not the ""land"" itself, as Kings had done for centuries upon centuries.  I believe that the Northmen use the style, ""King in the North"" for similar reasons.  House Stark does not claim to 'own' the lands of the North, instead it claims to descend from the great hero of Westeros, Brandon the Builder, who earned the devotion of his followers not through conquest but by the force of his will and deeds alone.  As the Northmen remember the 'Old Gods' who we all know have a certain affinity for trees, perhaps they do not see land a piece of possession as the Andal southerners do, but a shared resource as some real-world tribal cultures do.

This is a theory.  I do not personally know George R.R. Martin nor would his word be law.  The series stands on its own and each person may interpret it as he or she will. But I think it's a good theory, and I'd like to hear your thoughts, reddit.

ALL BOOK SPOILERS.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/v7m6i/theory_behind_the_faceless_men_all_book_spoilers/,Senzu,1339995736,"I banged this out right after finishing the 5th book, I was just thinking so much and I needed to get it written down.  I'm sorry if any parts are vague, and excuse the list format, but let me know what you think!


**THE FACELESS MEN:**
Working for the OTHERS.


**POWERS**

Death magic, draws power from people dying at their temple and use morbid magic

All about deceit, illusion, and lies - all things fire priests say the lord of light gives them power to see through, 
putting them at odds with each other

It has been said that the faceless men were responsible for the doom of valaria, but at the same time it has been said that the first faceless man is still alive.

This must make him hundreds of years old, similar to the eternal life of a white walker - suggesting that they use the same magic

Even the undying ones are always talked about as cold, and they also use deception magic

More obviously, they are assassins, and they bring death to people


**IDEALOGY**

Believe that everyone is suffering, and it is in human nature to suffer and cause each other pain, so the only true peace is death.

This means the ultimate goal is the destruction of the human race

Slogan is ""All men must die""

Would make sense that they want the white walkers to prevail, because they would bring about the end of humans

It's clear from this that one of their first goals would be to bring down the wall


**THE WALL**

The wall is an old peace treaty between the humans and others

The wall is never talked about during stories about the long night (which occurred about 8000 years ago), which 
means it probably didn't exist back then

The 13th commander of the nights watch was the Nights King, who fell in love with a white walker (which again was 8000 years ago)

It is also said that Bran the Builder built the wall, but at the same time it is infused with powerful magic (which wouldn't make sense if Bran built it himself)

Bran the builder is the oldest known stark, and it is said that the starks descend from the first men, so it would make sense that he also lived 8000 years ago.

It is made out of ice, which is strange because its supposed to keep white walkers out

Because it is made of ice, the best thing to bring it down is fire, and what better source of fire than dragons


**MORE ON FM PAST**

We know that the FM are responsible for the doom of valarya

They had overthrown the leaders of valarya, so its only natural that the repossessed their most powerful weapons

It has also been said countless times that it is impossible to sail to Valarya, so the only way anyone could get one is through the faceless man

The one that we know about in existence is the dragon horn that Euron gave Victorian.


**EURON AND VICTORIAN**

Euron is constantly referred to as cold and a godless man, with great trifling in dark magic

He sent Victorian on a suicide mission to either blow the horn himself (and kill himself, but bonding the dragon to 

Euron or one of the FM, who had previously completed the blood pact talked about)

I believe Euron poisoned Victorian as a backup plan, in case he didn't blow the horn himself 
(or got his maester or that mute girl to do it), but his plans were complicated when he found that red priest


**JAQEN FROM 4TH BOOK**

The alchemist is clearly Jaqen, as he shares the exact same description as the man that Arya saw Jaqen turn into.  

We learn from pate of a guild of maesters that want to kill Dannys dragons, this would be unacceptable for the FM plans

We also learn that if theres anywhere to go to learn about dragons its the secrets in oldtown

Jaqen was after (and obtained) a key essential for either the elimination of that guild of maesters who want the end of dragons, or the apprehension of vital knowledge about dragons


**VARYS**

The faceless men have been around for hundreds of years, and they have this insanely powerful magic

It would only make sense that these incredibly intelligent assassins would have been using their power to the fullest

One way to do that would be to take control of another person (preferably of large importance), what better person to take control of in all of kings landing than Varys?

He's in control of almost everything, he is the master of whispers and there hasn't been a time where he hasnt known something

He is a fat eunuch, but he sleeps on a stone bed and drinks only water.  This does not fit the stereotype of a fat eunuch.

At the temple of the many faced god, however, they all sleep one stone beds and drink only water.

No one knows what he's truly after, and it's never confirmed if anything he said about himself is true

The FM are trained to be perfect liars


**JAQEN FROM FIRST/SECOND BOOK**

There is no reason for him to have been locked up in the beginning, if he had gotten into trouble he could have just changed his face and avoided capture

The only logical reason for him to be there is if he was there intentionally

This could be explained if varys had set him up to be taken by Yoren, his ultimate goal being the murder of Lord 

Commander Mormont, the current and capable leader of the nights watch

 So I think one of the hardest things to get your head around in reading/watching this series is the age of the young main characters.  I find it easier to believe Joffrey is 13 [AGOT](/b ""when he takes the iron throne"") due to his personality than to believe that Jon Snow is 14 when he goes [AGOT](/b ""to join the Night's Watch"").  I assume that the realm of Westoros is set in an alternate reality, so therefore the laws of time are not necessarily identical to ours.  Is it possible that a year would be longer in ASOIAF time than it would be in our time?  Or are we to assume years are the same, and that a 9 year winter would be the same as 9 years on earth.  Or has it been said that time is identical in both realms?  If time were different, it could meant that Jon and Robb and etc are much more grown for their age, thus making their situations a little easier to grasp.  OR I could be talking out of my arse.

This was troublesome as the characters were only meant to have spent two months on the Island, yet Walt had aged by 2 years. The writers fixed this by writing Walt off the show, though this left a bad taste in the mouth of  a lot fans.

The child actors on this show are going to age significantly, this is unavoidable. How will this be resolved? They can't write the characters off like Walt. Will they replace them? Will they simply move the timeline forward to account for the actors' aging? I haven't read the books, so I don't know how far into the future Season 3 takes place from season 2. I imagine it will take place right after season 2 left off, or a couple of months ahead.

I don't think A Dance With Dragons has a cool old cover because its so new!

As far as I can guess, in A Game of Thrones we see Jon Snow in front of Castle Black (at first I thought it was Winterfell and he was going to castle black, but we see Longclaw)

In A Clash of Kings we see Stannis and Melisandre, possibly Davos bowing in front of him, and the white raven signalling the end of Summer.

A Storm of Swords we see Hoster Tully's funeral, with Catelyn, Edmure and Robb in the background.

And in A Feast For Crows I can't decide where Jaime is, the redness would suggest the Red Keep, but I can't help but think Riverrun, and Harrenhall in the background.

S02E04 onwards]",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/v9xp6/in_defence_of_jeyne_westerling_spoilers_asos/,mishagale,1340114028,"I'm re-reading *A Storm of Swords* right now, and having just watched the second HBO season, I got thinking about the difference between Robb's two wives: Jeyne Westerling and Talisa Maegyr. Now, I don't say that the show isn't fantastic or an excellent adaptation, but I do wonder why they changed the character, and I find it hard to avoid the conclusion that they were dumbing down. Hear me out.

Talisa is really something of a modern woman, in the real world sense. She is independent, strong willed, intelligent, brave and a skilled doctor. She isn't awed by Robb's status, and initially treats him impudently, by the standards of Westeros (and probably Volantis as well.) They fall in love after a going for long walks and intimate discussions. Apparently, in the show, this is the sort of woman Robb falls for - he isn't interested in the simpering wenches most men are, he's much more sophisticated than that. It's easy to see why the viewers like her (I did), and why they like Robb better for his taste in women.

Jeyne Westerling is pretty much the exact opposite. She isn't a battlefield doctor, she nurses the wounded Robb, presumably mopping his fevered brow and changing his dressings, rather than sawing off limbs without anaesthetic. Despite being married to a main character, she gets very little fleshing out, and most of her story happens off the page, as it were. She shows up asking Robb's mother for advice on how to be a good wife when he is brooding after killing Lord Karstark, and gives every impression of having no independent desires besides pleasing her lord husband and giving him heirs.

And how does Robb fall for Jeyne? Instead of meeting as equals, he arrives with an army, kills her protectors (her fathers soldiers), invades her home and becomes her father's liege lord. While breaking down her door with a battering ram (just a little Freudian), he takes an arrow in the arm, and the wound gets infected. To repay Robb for attacking her castle, she personally nurses him back to health, and ""comforts"" him when he hears the news of his younger brothers. It's somewhere between Florence Nightingale syndrome and Stockholm syndrome.

But as I said, she's a minor character. What's interesting is what she tells us about Robb: Basically, he's like all the other men of his milieu. He is interested in the classic feminine ideal of doe-eyed subservience. He doesn't want a woman who will stand up to him, he wants a pretty face and wide childbearing hips (OK, it's his mother who is most concerned about the hips.)

It's obvious from the way he writes Arya, Cersei, Brienne and Ygritte that GRRM is not ignorant of gender politics. He is always drawing attention to the stereotypes and injustices inflicted on women in the middle-ages (and even today), by mirroring them in Westeros. There also aren't any entirely heroic or villainous characters: he doesn't fall into the trap of making Robb the ""good guy."" His soldiers rape, murder and pillage the same as the rest, and he has no particular interest in women being anything but wives and mothers.

So why did HBO change things around? Well, we get a female love-interest who modern men are actually likely to be attracted to, and who modern women are likely to identify with. Robb seems more likeable, and his foolish decision to break his betrothal to Walder Frey's daughter seems more understandable. Writing it like that, it seems a rather positive change, but I can't help feel it undermines a tiny bit of Martin's vision.",46,35,False,self,,,,,

Example: Someone who has only watched the show saying [ASOS](/b ""I bet Robb Stark beats Tywin and wins the war!"") followed by people who have read ASOS downvoting him for that, demonstrating that he is incorrect and thus spoiling it to anyone who hasn't read that as of yet.

Does anybody else find it really interesting how Martin incorporates Roman, English and Scottish history (amongst others) into his fantasy fiction? He makes it more realistic than most fantasy fiction that tends to gloss over the bad parts. Some people of delicate sensiblities balk at the harshness of Martins writing. However, he bases a lot of it on history and it is therefore true to humanities true nature.

- Hadrian's Wall for 'The Wall'. Hadrian thought he could protect the entire Roman Empire (much like Brandon the Builder protecting the realm) by throwing up a Wall in England. It was symbolic more than anything. It stopped the Picts and Celts, but left the Empire vulnerable later to the rise of Atilla the Hun and Alaric of the Visigoths (the 'Others') from the East.

- War of the Roses: House of York (Stark) vs House of Lancaster (Lannister)

- The Black Dinner for the 'Red Wedding'. James II of Scotland (Tywin Lannister/Walder Frey) murders William Douglas, Earl of Douglas (Robb Stark) despite being under the promise of safe conduct.

- Dorne: Various influences of Cornwall (Corn/Dorn), Wales, Spain and even the Middle East (Palestine, hot desert environment)

- The archaic language used by Martin. For example, 'in his cups'. This refers to being drunk or being deep into your cups. You've basically had too many cups of alcohol. 


I know there are potentially hundreds more references. I was just hoping I am not alone in admiring his academic skill alongside his writing!

**Summer Snow**

In a blender, combine favorite Gin (Tanqueray recommended) with ice and a bit of Frangelico (something less than half as much as the gin you chose).  Serve responsibly by the finger - it's stronger than it looks.

Note : I also tried it with vodka and nearly ""took the black"", so *definitely* stick with Gin.

**The North Remembers**

In a tumbler, combine a half-shot of vodka (smirnof recommended), half-shot of redbull (total zero recommended), and two shots of vitaminwater multi-v.  Note that this can also help remedy the hangover you're bound to get if you try all of these.

**King in the North**

Combine three parts gin (tanqueray recommended) with one part vodka (smirnof recommended) by gently swirling in a highballer---both the spirits and the glass well-chilled.  On the side, sprikle table salt into a ramekin, enough to cover the bottom.  lay a single icecube into the ramekin.  When you remove, one side of the icecube should be lightly coated in salt.  Place (do NOT drop) the icecube into the tumbler and serve immediately.  Note that this is mixed in a highballer in case you want to turn it into a...

[ASoS](/b ""**Red Wedding**"")

[](/b ""Make a King in the North with a bit of room to spare.  Fill a shot-glass half-way with the same vodka and a liberal amount of tabasco.  Pop the shots in the microwave for 20-30 seconds (to get them quite warm, but not hot).  Drop the shot and drink as quickly as you can manage without chugging."")

**Lion's Roar**

Mix one shot of bacardi 151 and ~5 drops of vanilla extract.  Best done in a group.  *edit for note : our vanilla extract was bottled in 1957 and is EXTREMELY potent.  Thrown in the fire, it burns with a bright blue flame.  It's probably poison by now.  But you can try this recipe with newer bottles anyway.*  It helps to follow it with a...

**Green apple Fossoway**

Combine two parts hard cider to one part DeKuyper sour apple puckers.  Serve as shots, chilled, ideally ready after the above.

**White Walker**

3 parts Bacardi 151, 2 parts lime juice, 2 part Hpnotiq, with soda water to taste.

**Three-eyed Crow**

3 parts vodka, 2 part Kahlua, with a cranberry splash and three tapioca pearls.

**Southern Lady**

Combine gin, vodka, tequila, and rum (equal parts) with two parts lemonade finished with a quick spritz of whipped cream on top.

**REAL Southern Lady**

Same as above, but substitute 151 for the rum choice and Limoncello for lemonade.  Prepare to hit the ground harder than Sansa at the Sept of Baelor.

**Summer Islander**

Combine equal parts captain, kahlua and coke.  serve on the rocks.

**Sword of the Morning**

Sweet plum wine, chilled, with a shot of dry, high-proof sake finished with a sprinkle of confectioner's sugar.  I'd tell you what I used specifically, but they were both gifts and I can't read Kanji.  The plum wine is is pale grey with a large, white kanji and a red painted wreath, while the sake is a dark reddish-brown ceramic bottle with a black kanji.

-----

This is just a start, and I didn't even touch most of the families, because I'm out of money.  Theoretically I'm going to do whisky-drinks for the Baratheons and play with fruity+spicy drinks for the Targaryens, but I won't recommend anything I haven't already tasted.

I think I got the important points of it like Dany and Viserys being children to the Mad King, Rhaegar getting killed in the rebellion, Maester Aemon being great grandfather to Dany and not taking the throne, and there were some guys who were king that weren't high up in lineage and weren't expected to be king.

No spoilers or anything, but I was listening to some music earlier and thought a GoT trailer for season 3 or something could totally go with the song I was listening to. I ended up writing a script for it (I've never written a script nor do I know how they are supposed to be formatted, sorry if its completely wrong). 

It goes like this:
Game of Thrones (season 3?) Trailer.
Song: Outro by M83

-Scene 1 0:00-~1:34-

Close-up panning of the throne's swords &amp; hilts from a few different angles.(Possibly also flash to landscape views of each house's homeland/city)
At 0:58, start from center of throne and slowly zoom out until the entire throne is in view. Smoke in background, backlit. (~1:34)

-Scene 2 ~1:34-1:48

View of the Empty throne room from the opposite end of the throne, about 10 feet above, looking on a downwards angle.


-Scene 3 1:48-2:15
Camera pans across the throne room from the entrance to the throne, tracking a character who is slowly walking towards the throne.
Pillars are between the camera and the character. Each time a pillar blocks the view of the character, the character will be different with each glimpse (A Stark,A Lannistar,A Boratheon,A Targaryen,Jon Snow?). The space between each pillar which is around each character will be filled with a surreal view that represents
that character's house. (Ex. Possibly their family members, colors reflecting house and personality, goals, how the throne room would look if they were king.)

-Scene 4 2:15-2:28
Camera starts off above the throne facing straight down from high above, starts moving down towards the throne but swings up to face the direction of the entrance.
All characters seen walking toward the throne are standing side by side in a sort of half circle, standing in front of the throne, looking at it intently. The throne will be 
in the foreground of the shot but out of focus, along the bottom of the shot (tips of the blades).

-Scene 5 2:28-~2:33

A 1 second close-up shot for each of the characters faces, looking to the throne. Fades to white each shot.

-Scene 6 2:33-~2:41
Fade from white to a shot of a crown falling through the air, black background, slow motion. Hands of the characters each begin reaching up from the bottom of the shot to grasp the crown. 
Quick Fade to white at last second, just as the hands are about to touch it.


-Scene 7 2:41-3:21
Show scenes from large scale epic battles/action between the houses from coming episodes. At the last second, fade to white again.

Scene 8 3:21-3:41
Shot of the crown falling to the ground with some blood on it, slowmotion. Black empty background.
Followed by a shot of the crown on the edge of the top of the steps to the throne, in a pool of blood. The crown has just hit the ground and is wobbling to a stop in slow motion.
A small stream of blood starts dripping off of the step once the crown stops moving. Fade to black.

Scene 9 3:41-end
Title fades in with show time ect. 

END.

**TL;DR I got bored and wrote a script for what I'd like to see as a trailer/tv spot for GoT using Outro by M83.**

I chose that song because its pretty epic + the lyrics can actually work with it quite well, imo.

Edit: It really helps if you listen to the song as you read through this.

1. Starts off with Selmy and Ned telling war stories, completely bad ass.

2. Great if not best King Robert scene where Ned calls him fat and Rob tortures Lancel for the ""breast plate stretcher"".

3. Amazing fight between Loras and Gregor, Gregor loses and chops off a horses head in one swing, then an epic 1v1 fight with his brother Sandor.

4. Tyrion smashing a guys face in with a shield.

5. One of my favorite subtle scenes, Varys and the man from Essos having an intense riddle like conversation about instigating the Stark vs Lannister War.

6. Followed by an epic duel of minds between Varys and Littlefinger. ""Tell me, does someone, somewhere keep your balls in a box.""

7. Ned forfeiting his title as Hand of the King to protect a childs life and Rob threatens him with beheading. Intense scene. The kings acting in this scene deserved him awards.

8. The creepy introduction of Cat Starks sister and her Sky cells.

9. One of the best if not the best dialog scenes in TV history between Cersei and King Robert. Robert: ""Sometimes I dont know what holds it(7 kingdoms) together."" Cersei: ""Our Marriage."" Both explode in laughter.

10. And best of all, for me personally this is the best sword fight so far in GoT both seasons combined. Ned Stark vs Jamie at Little Fingers brothel. I wish that bastard didn't stab Ned in the leg!",50,49,False,self,,,,,

Basically, I'm thinking of starting a 4th edition game set in Martin's world, but I'm having some difficult translating Martin's world to DnD. Adjustments have to be made to keep the low-magic, high-realism nature of Martin's books, but I'm willing to be flexible. I'll keep the spells more or less as they are in the game, only have their look and feel be subtler; for instance, Magic Missile won't look like magic missiles, but it'll be more of a ""force push"" sort of thing where you don't physically see the missiles (a little too high fantasy for Martin's world) but the damage is still done.

What I'm really having trouble with is how to work the different races into the setting. For instance, what the hell am I supposed to do with Dragonborn characters? Should I just let them keep all the attributes, save perhaps the fire-breath, and just be really large, strong humans? I've toyed with the idea of making the Targaryens basically Elves and Eladrin, for instance. Dwarves would not be the stocky, Gimli-style dwarves of Tolkien but dwarves in the Tyrion sense.

I've been toying a little with settings and plots that I think would be interesting and lend themselves really well to a Dungeons and Dragons campaign. Currently, I'm considering making the PCs members of the Brotherhood Without Banners, but I've also been considering putting them on either Euron Greyjoy or Gerion Lannister's trip to the Doom of Valyria. The Doom creates a lot of interesting possibilities, considering it's supposedly ""demon-haunted"" and would allow me to work in more monster enemies than a setting in, say, Westeros or Essos.

Has anyone done this before? What recommendations would you have? I know there is a Game Of Thrones/ASOIAF tabletop setting already, but it's rather and expensive to get a hold of, and I'm not really interested in learning (and forcing others to learn) a new set of rules.

I'm just past where the first episode of season 1 ends.

While watching I really felt like a lot of stuff got rushed and thought some of the acting, makeup, wardrobe and CGI were a bit off (I guess it all seemed a bit low budget). I have heard great things about this series and really enjoy the book so far but I am wondering if the ""quality"" of the show and the pacing improves as the series progresses?

This is an honest question so please don't attack me for my opinion of the first episode. ",6,1,False,self,,,,,

When Joffrey was poisoned it seemed pretty apparent that Tyrion was innocent, and basically confessed to Jaime with a feeling of 'fuck it, if everybody thinks I did it anyway, might as well go along.' Now it seems that Tyrion is telling everyone he meets that he killed his father as well as his nephew.

It was hard for me to follow Littlefinger's explanation to Sansa when she escaped Kings Landing, but what I gathered from it was that he orchestrated Joffrey's death using Ser Dontos as well as the Kettlebacks. 

So basically I am just really foggy on who actually killed Joffrey. If this is revealed later in the books, just tell me to read on and find out, but I feel like it wont be and I've just completely missed something.

R. Martin's epic Game of Thrones is the impossible moral dichotomies of its human characters. There are magnificent people of great will and ethical triumph who are none the less perpetrators of an enormously corrupt system of inherited privilege. Eddard Stark has a self-interest in protecting the birth-rights of Robert Barathian's seed, and that is not consistent with the sacrificing pursuit of honor that comes to define him as a man. Similarly, the law and order candidate is a vicious fascist; the legal culture of Stannis Barathian does not deserve to be defended.

The levers of power are unmistakably thorny, a metaphor the Iron Throne is uncomfortably aware. This is the main driver of much of the interpersonal dynamics of the series. However ultimately the economic form of Westeros is as locked and alien to individual merit as the slave trade of the Free Cities. All qualities seem to spiral outwards from a stable core of dynastic tradition that both comprise the mold and see that it's filled. The Kingsgaurd exists as a course for Jamie Lannister because of his birthright and because his station allows him to develop the sort of skills that make it possible. In that way, the system sustains itself by pre-qualifying candidates for the positions in which they're groomed, but not on a rational or representative selection but by whose Vagina they fell out of.
___________________________________________________________
A sullen genius once revealed to us that what makes up a good character can be asked like this, http://redlettermedia.com/ Can you tell me, without describing what the character looks like, or what the character does over the course of the story, who this person is? This is essentially a theory of mind question, as it asks us to describe the internal content of this person's mind. The original purpose of this question is to expose the strange emptiness of a specific failure of our time, but it can still be applied in the same way so as to route out truly exceptional characters.

Applied to Tyrion Lannister in Game of Thrones:

I originally wrote Tyrion, amending it only to Lannister with a snarling regal menace. Their name evokes a kind of windswept predator with molten amber eyes. Into this Tyrion is born a Dwarf, and while that does indicate his physical dimensions, within the context of Game of Thrones it also identifies a class of people. Dwarfism is a station, not a physical description his body. He suffers hugely from casual discrimination, ameliorated only by his equally casual privilege. He giants other men's access to desires yet enjoys them less, cursedly. He can have a thousand lovely whores and a manse of gold, but he owes grievous debt on each one.

He is enormously underestimated and its killing him. Tyrion is wild for approval and aching to see faces that do not sour at his welcome. No one greets him warmly, but are leaden with a sudden cavernous reproach. Against this permanent social aggression, using him as a target for violence, deserting human affection, and injecting an immovable swaddling and humiliation into every attempt Tyrion adopts genuine kindness, willingness for peace, and carries them with an electric wit that will stoke a fire in any sympathetic soul.

The world he lives in is crueler. The idea of an iron throne, made of the boiled swords of all the kings that came before it, makes a vicious metaphor about the killing effect of power. The iron throne is a spiked center of gravity into which it's victims are slowly compelled. There is a ragged and brutalized history of succession, in which people are raised and fallen so rapidly it would seem the horizon to some kind of startling madness. I will stop now as when I wrote maddness auto-correct suggested the maddening. Which may be the most beautiful process in any young person's life.

1.  How did Stannis get to a boat and get away from the mud gate?  In one scene he's fighting his way through the enemy soldiers and in the next he's back in his evil beach lair.   Did that red headed woman use her magic vagina powers to teleport him back?



2. We saw all the servants and companions of Daenerys murdered in a previous episode, but spin forward and they all now seem to be alive.  What happened?   Were the corpses an illusion?  Were they dead, but now resurrected?   



3.  Winterfell was on fire when we last see it, but I feel like I missed a scene.  How did it all catch fire?

**Varys and Illyrio**
Varys and Illyrio have been in cahoots since AgoT, plotting to get a Targaryen back on the throne. I believe the pair to be part of an old Valyrian guild responsible for keeping balance in the world, possibly the leaders of a small global network of individuals bent on the same ends (more on this later).

Varys has almost magiclike abilities (the face changing eerily similar to the Faceless Men, as well as knowing nearly everything said in King's landing)[It's a stretch I know, just go with it, i'll explain more later]

**Valyrians**
The Valyrians may have once been a very advanced society, knowing dragonlore and the making of valyrian steels. I also believed they worshiped R'hollor. Most magic in the world seemed to be tied to the existence of Dragons, notably the powers of Red Priests. Dragons were found in old Valyria (a fire-like place I imagine), and I believe that the religion originated there. 

Why put a Targaryen on the throne?
Unification. Pure and simple. To prepare for the invasion from the land of always winter. Westeros needs to be united under Fire to defend against the Ice  (clever author).  The Valyrian bloodline is the best defender against the Others.

**Starks**
The Starks are as much a key to the unification and defense of Westeros as the Targaryens. Starks are descendants of the First Men. It has been suggested that the first men bred with the Children of the Forest (another notably magiclike group), and we see evidence of this in the Stark children's warglike abilities and Bran's third eye.  

Since the First Men came to Westeros via the Dorne land bridge, I suggest that they are of the same blood as the Valyrians. 

This will all start making sense near the end.

**Prophecies**
There have been several prophecies in the books that have come true. If we look at the ones from Cercei's childhood, those have come true. Jojen, Bran, the weirdo Dwarf lady who talks to the brotherhood without banners. I accept that most prophecies are true in this world. 

It was prophesied that Azor Ahai would be born of the Targaryen line to Rhaella (Which leaves either Dany or Aegon (Young Griff))

**Jon Snow**
Though he may be dead, Jon Snow could possibly be one of the most important characters. If we accept the theory of his mother being Ashara Dayne (Who had violet eyes, a very Targaryen like quality). His blood would be one of the strongest against the Ice, containing both blood of the Valyrians and First Men).

**TL;DR:** Valyrians= Magic against the Others. Starks and Targaryens are of Valyrian descent. Secret guild plans to save world.

**Other Stuff**
It kind of supports my crackpot ideas.

**Jhaqen Jqar/Alchemist (Maybe)**
If you believe me, it would give credence to the opening and closing of AFFC. If we assume that the man who met and possibly killed Spotted Pate is J'haqen, we can assume that the man who hired him clearly has lots of money (Illyrio/Varys). He may be in place to not necessarily kill someone, but to guide events in a favorable direction. Archmaester Marwyn spent years abroad in Essos, has several items of Valyrian Steel, and has a dragonglass candle. Cleary he knows what's up, when he hears that Aemon believed the prophecy to refer to Dany, he went scuttling off, he also urged Sam to hurry with his studies and make his way to the Wall. J'haqen is there to make sure the Citadel doesn't interfere. 

**Melisandre**
This bitch wants royal blood to spill. I think by sacrificing royal blood, it enhances the power of the Red God. Edric Storm (Targaryen blood via Baratheon line), Renly, Mance Rayder (Blood of the First Men), Jon even goes as far as to hide Aemon and Mance's son. 

**Azor Ahai**
It is remotely possible that Stannis is Azor reborn.  The prophecy concerning his coming says he will be of the line of Rhaelle. There is another Targaryen by the name of Rhaella who wed into the Baratheon line. When Melisandre looked into her fires and thought she saw Arya Stark coming to the wall, but instead saw a Karstark. So clearly people making prophecies can be close to the mark  (I know that one is a stretch) but not always 100% accurate.

**What it all means.**
The Others are threatening the land, making their way to Westeros. The guild of old Valyria has known for years and is actively manipulating events to bring Valyrians to unite Westeros and to defend against the coming. 

I know that I haven't answered a lot, but this is just more of a general idea about the whole series. The smaller things. Please critique, add, whatever. I Just really enjoyed thinking and writing about all of this.

You will be super pissed if you do and it will be your own fault. I was on a long flight from the West coast to the East and read the book [Destiny of the Republic](http://www.amazon.com/Destiny-Republic-Madness-Medicine-President/dp/0385526261), a biography about 20th US President James Garfield. I was almost shocked when I reached the segment on how he won the Republican nomination. His rise to power was eerily similar to Jon Snow's. I'll leave the tie-ins as an exercise to the reader.

James Garfield was a precocious young academic. He came from very modest means, raised by a single mother, his father dying young.  After a rough start as a canal-man, Garfield went to school and discovered in himself a great potential. At the outbreak of Civil war, Garfield joined the military. His tact earned him praise after he defeated the veteran West Point alumnus [Humphrey Marshall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphrey_Marshall_\(general)) at [Middle Creek](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Middle_Creek). Despite his success, he was a humble man and rarely sought any position of authority but his intellectual prowess gave him a reputation that men revered. 

After his storied heroism in the war and a stint as the president of his old school, he was asked to run for Senate. He won his race with almost no campaigning whatsoever. Over time he became well-respected in the Senate for his inspirational eloquence and reason. However, he also earned powerful enemies for not toting party lines. [Roscoe Conkling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roscoe_Conkling) was perhaps the most influential Republican at the time and a member of the Stalwarts.  He grew to dislike Garfield after he failed to support Conkling on various minor matters. (On a side note, Garfield also was barely able to see his wife in his first terms as a Senator since travel to Ohio could only be accomplished occasionally)

In 1880 Garfield dutifully traveled to Chicago in order to nominate his fellow Ohioan, Gen. John Sherman, as the Republican nominee for President. Before his turn on stage, Conkling hopped on top of a table and with a short quip (imagine Gaston from Beauty and the Beast) he nominated [Ulysses S Grant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant#Post-presidency) for his third term. Garfield followed the rowdy speech with a somber and compassionate address that brought the rambunctious convention to silence.

Following the nominations, voting began. After the first vote, no decisive victory had been made (Sherman received ~90 votes, Grant received ~300, and another candidate Blaine received ~300 as well). Another vote would be required. Vote after vote failed to garner any substantial change. After a few dozen votes, a single vote for Garfield appeared, seemingly as a joke. Several votes later, Garfield gained a few more supporters. Garfield realized what was happening and addressed the crowd and tried to persuade everyone to end the folly and focus on the task at hand. On the 36th vote Garfield started with a few votes from one state and a few from another appeared. Like a snow ball, states began to declare all of their votes for Garfield. In the end Garfield sat miserable at his table hoping for the nightmare to end.

Without a very strong campaign (Democrats were still unpopular due to their association with the Southern rebellion) Garfield won the office of President. He may be perhaps the only US President to be seated unwillingly. As President, he was surrounded by office seekers and misanthropes. Whats worse, Conklings protg, [Chester Arthur]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_A._Arthur) was forced onto him as a running mate and served him as Vice President. 
He performed his job dutifully and even scored a few successes. In a wild gambit and attempt to rebuke the President, Conkling resigned from his Senate seat expecting to be reinstated automatically by New York but had no such luck. Still, Garfields goals were distracted by the near death of his wife and other obstructions. 

After only 6 months in office Garfield was murdered by a fellow Republican, Charles Guiteau. Guiteau felt a false sense of grandeur and justified his removal of the president as a necessary action.  Arthur found himself in the Executive mansion. In a surprising turn of events, Arthur did not appoint Conkling to his staff.

I'm just curious, is there any chance Syrio could be Jaqen H'ghar? 

I ask this question because we don't see the fate of Syrio as Arya is told to flee when he's fighting the Lannister men. Later we meet Jaqen H'ghar as a captive of the Lannisters.

When Ned and the small council discuss ways to dispose of Daenerys they mention the Faceless Men of Braavos. Could it be that Syrio was hired by Ned to a) teach her how to use Needle and b) keep an eye on her as, by this point, he is very wary of Cersei's spies. Arya has a tendency to run wild around the Red Keep so this would make sense.

**Tower of Joy**

He dreamt an old dream, of three knights in white cloaks, and a tower long fallen, and Lyanna in her bed of blood.     In the dream his friends rode with him, as they had in life. Proud Martyn Cassel, Jory's father; faithfull Theo Wull; Ethan Glover, who had been Brandon's squire; Ser Mark Ryswell, soft of speech and gentle of heart; the crannogman, Howland Reed; Lord Dustin on his great red stallion. Ned had known their faces as well as he knew his own once, but the years leech at a man's memories, even those he has vowed never to forget. In the dream they were only shadows, grey wraiths on horses made of mist.     They were seven, facing three. In the dream as it had been in life. Yet these were no ordinary three. They waited before the round tower, the red mountains of Dorne at their backs, their white cloaks blowing in the wind. And these were no shadows; their faces burned clear, even now. Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning, had a sad smile on his lips. The hilt of the great-sword Dawn pokes up over his right shoulder. Ser Oswell Whent was on one knee, sharpening his blade with a whetstone. Across his white-enameled helm, the black bat of his House spread its wings. Between them stood fierce old Ser Gerold Hightower, the White Bull, Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.  


 I looked for you on the Trident, Ned said to them. 

 We were not there, Ser Gerold answered.  

 Woe to the Usurper if we had been, said Ser Oswell.  

 When King's Landing fell, Ser Jaime slew your king with a golden sword, and I wondered where you were.  

 Far away, Ser Gerold said, or Aerys would yet sit the Iron Throne, and our false brother would burn in seven hells.   

I came down on Storm's End to lift the siege, Ned told them, and the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne dipped their banners, and all their knights bent the knee to pledge us fealty. I was certain you would be among them.   

Our knees do not bend easily, said Ser Arthur Dayne.  

 Ser Willem Darry is fled to Dragonstone, with your queen and Prince Viserys. I thought you might have sailed with him.  

 Ser Willem is a good man and true, said Ser Oswell.   But not of the Kingsguard, Ser Gerold pointed out. The Kingsguard does not flee.  

 Then or now, said Ser Arthur. He donned his helm.   

We swore a vow, explained old Ser Gerold. Neds wraiths moved up beside him, with shadow swords in hand. They were seven against three.  

 And now it begins, said Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning. He unsheathed Dawn and held it with both hands. The blade was pale as milkglass, alive with light.

HUGE spoilers are tagged below, if you watch the show exclusively please don't get spoiled like I did.  You can still enjoy the story without the spoilers. 

So back to the story.  Whenever I'm not playing well I get superstitious so I like to change my player name.  I changed it to my favorite character thus far, [ASOS spoilers ahead](/b ""Robb Stark"") and this was fairly uneventful for several weeks until this past week.  I was playing a 6v6 game against another team where I was apparently more aggravating than usual as I was playing very physical.  After the other team won, I got not one but two messages from guys on the other team revealing that [ASOS](/b ""Robb dies in book 3"")  I was understandably upset, but not wanting to let them know that they won claimed that I was a book reader and that they had not spoiled anything for me.

SPOILERS ALL,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/vikqn/predictions_for_pov_characters_in_winds_of_winter/,esuma10,1340517884,"With every ASOIAF Book, we have new POV Characters. They exist to expand on a plotline or provide a new one or give better explanation of the happenings of a location. Examples being Brienne, Hotah, Quentyn, Arianne, Selmy, Asha, Damphair, Victarion etc.

With the 6th book, I expect at least 3-4 new POV characters. AT THE LEAST. So what are you predictions for new players in the Game? Give a detailed explanation as to why, not just ""Because I love this Character""

Here are mine:

Jorah Mormont: The number of Denaerys Related POV characters in ADWD was... excessive. And we can all agree that the Denaerys POV chapters... well... kind of sucked. The Journey of Jorah being reunited with Danny would be a great read. Not only that, but he will probably be her last betrayal, the one for love, and his understanding of the situation would be add a tremendous amount to the plotline, just as Jamie's murder of Aerys to save King's Landing did.

Varys: So he knew Aegon was alive? So he tried to both orchestrate war and create peace between Stark and Lannister? So he also knew that Viserys was seeking the throne as well? What about this guy makes sense? Nothing. And an prologue, or a more likely epilogue with him as POV seems possible. Not for plot points, but to understand his character better. He has had a hand in so much of this story, from Aerys to Kevan. 

One of the Reed Children: Either Joren or Meera. There is something they aren't telling us. Maybe is has to due with L+R=J, or maybe it has to do with the Children of the Forest. It's obviously something. And GRRM isn't an author that will just have them tell Bran. We might see the inner monologue of this secret, similar to the build up of Cersei's prophecy of the valonquar.

Other (White-Walker): I can see an Other as a prologue, with just bits and pieces of their actual purpose, something that isn't explained until far later on. Just a simple conversation between two, and an attack on Hardhome. That would be all that is necessary.

So with all that out of the way, feel free to dissect my ideas, but more importantly, post your own!",27,4,False,self,,,,,

I guess she wants to think that fantasy worlds need different species and culture because different human civilizations would develop differently. I am currently on the third book and I brought it up how I thought it was strange that Renly wanted to conceal his identity as a gay man, but went around hanging out with the Knight of Flowers and named his 7 closest knights the ""Rainbow"" knights. Jaime Lannister even says something to the effect of this being a extremely girly thing which upset my mom. She said that in a different universe rainbows shouldn't be associated with gay people because that association just came about in the past 10-20 years. I think it makes sense that rainbows would be considered girly, because I can't imagine a universe where rainbows are masculine. Anyways, why did Renly name his knights this and do you guys think that real world similarities should be part of this universe?",22,6,False,self,,,,,

I thought about it for a long time and came up with reasons for and against it. Mostly I've just been looking for a reasonable way for him to come back in some way, and anything is possible when it comes to ASOIAF. I don't think its possible to say whether its true or not, and I think its at least something fun to play around with. I considered the following:

* Maybe part of the reason he was able to be such a powerful horselord is because he was so in tune with the nature of his mount.
* If he was a warg, he may or may not have even been aware of it. It could kind of be like Bran who had the dreams but didn't understand them until the Reeds helped him to. Or if he did know then I don't think he would share it with the other Dothraki. We see how they revile magic and Maegi like Mirri Maz Duur, and if it would ever come out that Drogo was a warg then his entire horde would probably turn on him. I'm sure there are strong arguments for and against him sharing his true nature with Dany, but that never happened in the books or the show, so if he truly was a warg then he clearly trusted no one with the secret.
* Mirri Maz Duur's ritual is what makes me curious about this most of all. Logically Drogo would be most in tune with his own mount, and when she slays it he no longer has that connection. That doesn't mean his magical nature has been severed though, so maybe his spirit went out to search for another creature to bond with. So while Drogo appears to be in this vegetative state, hes actually been locked out of his body while his consciousness finds a new life form to attach itself to. I don't recall if Bran has his eyes closed or not when hes warged, so maybe those two conditions are exactly alike.
* Another theory I like to toy with is that Mirri Maz Duur's ritual actually turned him into a warg. By slaying Drogo's own horse, his spirit could have bonded with the animal's. This would technically save his life, though not in the way Dany wanted. While his body appears to be in a vegetative state, his spirit is off searching for a new body to inhabit.
* As far as these last two theories go, maybe his body was left in too weak a state for his spirit to actually return safely. Maybe the spell actually kept his own spirit from returning, forcing him to attach himself to a new vessel while Dany continued to sustain his mortal body. Maybe Drogo didn't actually know how to return to his body if the ritual turned him into a warg, and he got stuck in another with no idea of how to control his new powers. We've also seen that a warg is able to live on even if their mortal body dies, and they aren't just limited to animals they've formed a bond with, like when Varamyr attempts to dominate another human and almost wins.

What do you guys think? I'm probably just trying too hard to make up a way in which Drogo can come back and be badass again, but like I said before, anything is possible. This is just food for thought.",16,0,False,default,,,,,

I don't see how this universe could have a good ending. 


Every single one of the kings is just a horrible fit. Stannis would be too just. Tommen would be a puppet. Robb is dead, Balon is dead, and Danaerys is far from doing anything to impact Westeros, and the dozen other kings don't seem well fit either.


Now to top it off, the Whitewalkers have awoken and began their descent to the South. The Nightswatch is in shambles, and although Jon may be a good leader; they don't have enough man power to accomplish much. 


Considering how evil most of the people are in the universe, I doubt that we'll see a Mass Effect style gathering of resources and man power to fight a greater threat, especially since they doubt the threat exists at all and the people are too selfish to help one another. 

It's difficult to imagine an ending where everyone lives happily ever after; an ending which would be a slap in the face to the reader. But it's even harder to imagine a plausible ending where anyone wins. If things continue to go as they are going now, the Whitewalkers will defeat the Seven Kingdoms. 


Any speculation on what would be the best possible ending for the characters in the novels?

I do have to admit that it did lack the battles, exciting pace, and some main characters, but I did not mind that.  It introduced some great new characters (Victarion) developed some old ones like Jamie, whose story line has changed the most.  Cersei's chapters I hated but only because I hate her.  A hate which proves how well Martin writes because no one should be this irked by a fictional character.  Seeing things from her perspective also changed a lot.  She is not the unbreakable person as seen by other people but in reality is paranoid and naive.   Yes, it lacked the major battles but it provided some interesting historical background (Dorne) and set the pieces for the next book. 

P.S. What's the deal with ADWD?  I am seeing the same type of negative views I did for AFFC.  I honestly think most people, except for the people who view this subreddit, are not big readers and are can't enjoy slow moving books despite how well they are written.  ",21,5,False,self,,,,,

I've also picked up the actual books.  I've made it 250 pages into the first book these last few weeks.  I've been noticing that magic seems to play a more prominent role in the books.  One last note, please refrain from answering my questions if the answer would somehow be a spoiler.  Here are my questions:

1.  We all know that ""winter is coming,"" but the book, and Lord Stark, make it seem that it isn't just winter that is coming, but some sort of dark magic/bad luck comes along with winter?  Am I reading this right, or just reading to deep into things?  The part that really struck me was when Lord Stark was talking to Arya, right after she rediscovers Needle, and telling her that Bran's fall, and the mess at the trident, were clear signs of winter coming.

2.  The crows.  Is Martin adding human qualities to the birds that really aren't there, or are the birds/crows some sort of magical creature?  I'm referring to the crow flying with bran while he's falling in his dream.  And the crow that Lord Commander Mormont has that apparently can speak.

3.  Why the heck does the show downplay ""magic"" so much?  It's everywhere so far in the book, and while I do love the show, they seem to have completely abandoned an important aspect of the first book!

So write, George, write like the wind!

Lewis took five years to chronicle Narnia
Tolkien had twelve years, and Rowling took ten
Lucas spent nearly three decades on Star Wars
And we all know how that one turned out in the end

But please, bear in mind, in the time that youve had,
William Shakespeare churned out thirty-five friggin plays

And if you keep writing so slow
Youll hold up the HBO show

George R. R. Martin, please write, and write faster
cause we wont stop whining until were appeased
Crap out the chaptersand George, while youre at it
Stop killing our favorite characters, please

I'm finding myself hating all of Cersei's chapters.


I've never liked her, but reading again (without the eagerness to advance the story) it's painful reading all of her follies, how she treats everybody like dirt and blames everyone for the stupid situations she puts herself in. At first all of her bad ideas didn't seem so bad when rushing through the pages; I at least didn't dwell on the consequences of her actions (I would be a very bad Hand :P)


It's all worse for how she keeps commending herself each time she hatches a new dangerous plan by thinking that this is how a realm should be reigned and how proud her father would be if he could see her.


It's also sad how Jaime starts seeing her with open eyes and replying with I love you too, sweet sister.


One particular event is when she's the small council and she goes on a rage on how Sansa is an ungrateful bastard that repaid her kindness with treason, and after she's done everyone is silently staring at her... probably thinking how stupid could she be for expecting something else, you had her father killed and allowed Joffrey to beat her. And she's totally oblivious to it.


I guess there can be a lot of lengthy discussions about all of her bad decisions.

1) When they say ""hedge knight"", what do they mean? I know it's another book by GRRM, but I can't tell specifically what that term means.

2) In AGoT they talk quite a bit about Robert Arryn and how he was supposed to be fostered with Tywin Lannister. Then, Walder Frey says that he was supposed to be fostered with Stannis, and it's basically implied by Catelyn's actions that he's just a senile old man who doesn't know what he's talking about. Then in the beginning of ACoK, Stannis says that the boy was supposed to be fostered with him. So what was the whole deal with them thinking he was supposed to go with Tywin? Was there any significance to that? Why were they all wrong about the situation? 

3) What do they mean by ""green boy"". I thought it meant a man who hasn't killed someone yet, or has never been in a battle. But Tywin continues to call Robb a green boy even after he wins two battles and kills men. What does that term mean? 

Edit:

4) Why is fire able to hurt Viserys and not Daenerys? 

5) Which race is the Rhoynar? They say the king is the king of the First Men (Northerners), the Andals (I think is pretty much most of the South, the ones who worship The Seven, right?) and the Rhoynar.

2. All other party guests may swear fealty to whatever house they wish. If the numbers are off, or you do not swear fealty to a house, you will be randomly assigned to one of the five houses at the party.

3. When the person with the pint glass drinks, everyone assigned to that house drinks.

4. If you are unable to keep up with the House that you are assigned to, you are an oathbreaker and have brought shame to your family. There are no other consequences but this, do not attempt a feat that you cannot manage. This game is supposed to be fun, not taxing.

5. Toasts among houses are required at least once during the evening.

I have been assigned the head of House Stark, since my friend declared me King in the North at our graduation party earlier this summer. ",7,26,False,self,,,,,

Here's another confession: ever since the end of LOST I felt a hole in my literary heart. A hole that should be filled with a well written mythology and wouldn't leave me cheated with open-ended mysteries.

Both ASOIAF and LOST involve questions/mysteries that aren't answered for a very long time. The big difference is that the LOST writers never intended to answer the mysteries while GRRM answers the questions that you'd forgot you asked.

When you read (or think) of the characters in 'A Song of Ice and Fire', which actors appear to you?

For me, ***Peter Dinklage IS Tyrion Lannister***.  Plain and simple, no questions asked.  He completely owns that role, with all his bluster and humor and vulnerability.  Totally amazing at what he does, hopefully the start of something great.

* Sean Bean as Eddard Stark

5066,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2012-6-30,2012,6,30,11,vtscd,self.gameofthrones,[ASOS Spoilers] Azor Ahai speculation and worries....,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/vtscd/asos_spoilers_azor_ahai_speculation_and_worries/,[deleted],1341024841,"Alright, so I'm pretty confident that Beric Dondarrion is Azor Ahai. Now that's all great and well, but what worries me is the fates of not only him, but Danny, Stannis &amp; Jon as well. Danny, of course, is extremely important with the dragons and Melisandre's prophecy of the dragons being born from stone (stone eggs) through blood (Mirri) and aiding Azor Ahai &amp; Lightbringer. Stannis, however, I don't see being mentioned or referenced in the prophecies. 

Stannis is who worries me the most, because I see him having no real place in upcoming events. Let me elaborate though on why I like Stannis before we go on and maybe you'll understand why I'm worried about him not having a place. First off, Renly would've been a great Summer King, but Winter is Coming and the realm needs somebody strong. Stannis is a hard man for a hard time and is the only King who answered the Night Watch's call for help. This quote right here really made me think him as the rightful King in Danny's Absence: 

&gt;""I was trying to get the throne to save the realm, when I should've been trying to save the realm to get the throne."" - Stannis Baratheon

So now my main point: His confrontation with Danny. I just don't see how it's going to work out in the best interest of the realm. Danny sees him as a Usurper, Stannis will see her as a Pretender to the Iron Throne. Both have strong convictions and both are unwilling to compromise in anything when it comes to the Iron Throne. They should be uniting to go North and protect the Realm of Man, instead I'm pretty sure that their just gonna get caught up in the Game of Thrones and get a lot more smallfolk killed than otherwise...hell...maybe even loose the North to the Others because of it. 

 Beric Dondarrion has been slain **six fucking times**! He's getting weaker each time! I want to just slap him and say *""STOP FUCKING WITH THE MOUNTAIN THAT RIDES AND GO NORTH GOD DAMMIT! THIS IS A WASTE OF YOUR TALENTS!""*. He's out there playing Robin Hood when he should be all Hero Mode and shit. He's gonna to be a quadriplegic by the time Winter Comes. Can you fight Others &amp; Wights with stubs? I guess we'll find out. 

And lastly, Jon Snow. If the theories are to be believed, than he is the true heir to the Iron Throne (through Rhaegar &amp; Lyanna). Yet that means not only will he have to confront Danny &amp; Stannis over it, but he'd also have to forsake the Night Watch.....all before the apocalypse goes down. 

All I have to say is it's gonna be a fun ride watching G.R.R.M. settle all these things. 

**TL;DR Beric Dondarrion, Stannis, Danny &amp; Jon Snow are all on a collision course &amp; I'm worried about them killing each other off before Winter Comes, when, you know....they should all be working together to save the Realm of Man instead of conquering the Realm of Westorisis.**
