Her pride is degraded by all the heckling and the septa shouting over and over ""Shame, shame, shame on the sinner"", eventually losing all composure and covering herself.

Firstly, I know that in the book Doreah was dead long before they reached Qarth. So I'm talking about the show solely here.

However, what I don't get in the show is how she betrayed Daenerys and how that warranted what Dany did. My brother pointed out that sometime in the show Daenerys hinted at Doreah sleeping with Xaro. 

&gt;""Xaro's our host but we know nothing about him. Men like to talk about other men... when they're happy."" 

(Season 2, Episode 5, about 34 minutes into the episode).

This seems like a direct reference to the time (I think in Season 1 Episode 2) where Doreah tells her that men like to talk about other men when they're happy.

Is this just us or is it pretty obviously Dany either saying she's going to sleep with Xaro or asking Doreah to? We know Daenerys wasn't going to, so the message seems pretty clear to me. How then is it betrayal? There are a million reasons Doreah could've done that after what Dany said. ",4,4,False,default,,,,,

Will he be important by the end of the story?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1488sq/speculation_and_possible_spoilers_for_all_books/,Dougie1204,1354577602,"So let me start off by saying I should probably be posting this to the ASOIAF Reddit but I want to start here, I will post it there at another time as I'm sure I will get some responses here. 

I've been wanting to ask you all this for a while now I've just been lazy. So some, if not all of us book readers know that Gerion Lannister, one of Tywin's younger brothers and the brother who cared the least what Tywin thought.... Went sailing into the Doom Of Valyria to find an ancient Lannister Valyrian sword called ""Brightroar"" and who knows what other treasures. We also know Tywin sent an expedition after him to see if he was alive and bring him back but the trail went dead when they found out his men abandoned him and Gerion was forced to use Slaves to continue on. No one has heard from him for 10 years and no one has ever sailed into the Smoking Sea and come back. Gerion is said to be the favorite Uncle of Tyrion and Jaime, which means if he did come back they would both probably look to him for help and guidance (assuming they were int he same place at any point.)

In AFFC Genna Lannister even goes so far as to say that Jaime fights like Gerion and that Tyrion is more like Tywin. Tyrion always thinks about how Gerion was the only member of his family who really accepted him and encouraged him to act like what he is, while also respecting him and giving him books so he can learn and hone his mind. So I guess my question is do any of you think he has a role? I assume if he enters the story his role will have something to do with stopping the Wights and the Others since he's searching for a Valyrian sword and he is massively risking his life to go get it. Perhaps Jaime will end up on the wall for having sex with Cersei and he will help defend the realm from the Others with Brightroar as his weapon?

After each new episode, AMC shows *The Talking Dead*, a talk show of sorts in which a host discusses what just aired with actors and episode writers. I think it's the first time a TV network has done something like this for its own programming (although I'm sure back in the day *Lost*, *Dallas*/*Dynasty*, *The Prisoner*, *The Fugitive*, etc. would have had fans watching such accompaniments to their shows). I'm surprised HBO hasn't followed suit with *Game of Thrones* yet given how dense each episode's plotlines are. Such a show could appeal to both readers and TV-only fans by discussing how plot points are both similar to and different from the relevant adapted portions of the books.^1

We were a group of people who used to hang out there, the 4 people living there, and 4 of their friends, that includes me. 
   
At the time, I was unemployed and watched a lot of TV-shows. They all said I should watch Game of Thrones, and since there was about two months until season 2 were supposed to start, I thought it would be a great time to catch up with the rest of them. 

So, I decided to watch it, and started the first episode the evening right before my birthday. I watched the eight first episodes, and I was amazed of how good it was, I really, really enjoyed it. So I watched the first eight episodes, and slept for a few hours, then got up and went to my friends house to hang out. This is on my actual birthday.

We sit there, play som Super Smash bros, and are talking about the show. When one guy walks in, he hears us talking, and joins the conversation. We talk for a while, and then I tell people I really enjoy the Starks. His answer was something like: [AGoT/Season 1](/b ""Yeah, it's a shame that Ned get's his head cut off."")

I seriously loose my mind, and shout out: ""I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT PART!"" I was furious. 

I always remind him of that day, and the fact that I will never truly forgive him. One day I'll make him pay.

MAJOR SPOILERS OF ALL BOOKS (specially A Dance with Dragons) AHEAD!!

So I read about a lot of theories for Winds of Winter and I really want to know what you guys think.

Some people are telling that Jon died and will come back as Azor Ahai. There are theories talking about he merging with ghost (no, not in a warg way, some people are talking that he will REALLY merge with the wolf) and Mel throwing a phoenix down in him. After he is reborn, he will have to kill Mel to get his Azor Ahai powers. That's were I think it's strange... Azor Ahai had to kill his wife, a person very dear to him to gain his powers and a fucking neat flame sword of ass destruction. I have a thought, but I really, really wish that this don't come true:

I think that IF all this conspiracy is true, he'll have to kill... Arya.
There's some other very interesting theories about the resurrection of Jon too, some people saying that he will be brought back to life by UnCat after she found the truth about him (that he is the son of Rhaegar + Lyanna). I find that really awesome.

What you people think? Are these theories out of hand or did you find something cool?

So I've wondered, do you know more male or more female fans (readers and show watchers) of the series or is it quite balanced? why do you think it is like that? are there different reasons based on the viewer's gender, why people enjoy the show/the books?

* [Last month another special post was made to specifically point out the growing problem with ASOS spoiler carelessness.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/11rxmd/public_service_announcement_be_very_careful_with/)

The subreddit [posting policy](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/thrle/) is very clear on this issue:

* Don't joke, tease, or troll with spoilers unless they are tagged for easy avoidance

This subreddit is for *everyone*.  Reading all the books is not required, nor is watching every EP when they air.  We are very flexible with minor details in the interest of making discussion easy, but the blatant ASOS spoilers need to stop.  

I removed posts from six people yesterday and three more just now.  This is the low-traffic time; after the holidays the population of regular readers here is going to skyrocket.  Last season's activity listed /r/gameofthrones as the most-active non-default subreddit on all of Reddit.  Most of the seasonal traffic have not read the books.  We need to get the spoiler management under better control now to help prevent the potential chaos that's coming.

So please consider this the last warning about spoilers.  We are banning anyone who doesn't care about warning and anyone who thinks it's fun to tease upcoming spoilers.

More info on how it will work can be found in this post: [Community Best of 2012 Awards](http://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/14cha9/community_best_of_2012_awards/)

So to get things started on for /r/gameofthrones, we are formally calling for ""Best of"" category suggestions.  /r/asoiaf already has [a thread posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/14i7ck/crow_business_best_of_rasoiaf_2012_official/) if you'd like some examples to spark ideas.  If there are enough suggestions, we may post a vote to pick the best categories too.  

We'll be giving away the gold credits provided by the Reddit Admins to the winners of the main five categories.  We may also offer custom and/or unique flair for winners.  More on all that will be posted soon.

So please post any suggestions for contest categories below.

    Talisa will be there

    Amputees, cello players and drummers have all been cast

    We will see the sickening ""GreyRobb"", probably in Ep 10

As for me, I am sure they'll keep the tragic Cat/Robb stuff as close as possible to the book, with ""Jaime Lannister sends his regards"", Rains of Castamere, and all of that.

What I hope and really would like to see is some version of the Smalljon's heroic sacrifice in the books. People are beginning to be butchered, and the guy throws a whole table over Robb to protect his king. The fucking Boltons and the Freys murder them both, of course, but it hit me hard nonetheless.

The second hope may not happen at all, and it wasn't seen in the Cat chapter, just mentioned later in AFFC. The Freys go out to kill the chained Grey Wind, and tell Raynald Westerling to stand aside. At first he does so, and thanks to his mom's plotting he could have been one of the few survivors of the RW. He's really young and no grizzled veteran, but when he sees that they're shooting Grey Wind, he goes into full badass mode, disarming one of the guards and using his axe to smash the chains and free Grey Wind. Sadly, the Freys then feather him with numerous arrows and he falls into the Trident. Grey Wind then gets a lot of the fuckers before going down too :(

If they do it in the show they will have to use someone else since it's Talisa not Jeyne, but hopefully it would be someone like Raynald, young and fairly 'green', but brave and loyal till the end.

What do you guys want to see in HBO's interpretation?

Seasons here on Earth are caused by the tilt of the Earth as it orbits around the sun but in the GoT world, this would be like the Earth sitting in the position around the sun that causes spring for years but somehow still completing its full orbit.

At first I thought people in the GoT world just measured time differently, so when they said ""years"" it could be closer to ""months"" or ""weeks"" in Earth time. This doesn't hold up however because we hear old nan tell of 'children being born and dying in eternal winter' or somesuch so unless people age really really fast somehow, years seem to progess like Earth years. 

And it can't be an insanely long orbit for the GoT planet, because how do they mark years otherwise? I just started my obsession over the summer, so I'm a n00b and don't know if this question has been asked and answered already or if GRRM had given an answer, or if he'd just tell me to quit being such a nerd and thinking about trivial things.

EDIT: Ok, I get it, its all because of magic n shit. I figured there might be a simpler answer than what I was expecting but GRRM has made such a delicately built world that I thought there was a super complicated answer.

Wondering if you guys know of any good game of thrones themed phone cases for Galaxy S3.

(There is also Targaryen, Dorne, Tyrell and Greyjoy in that style I believe) all unavailable

But then I found [this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Game-of-Thrones-TV-Series-Hard-Case-Samsung-Galaxy-S3-S-3-III-Matte-Coating-/300825806356?pt=PDA_Accessories&amp;var=&amp;hash=item460a9d8614)
and I really like the style of the greyjoy one but I'm just not that big a fan of their house (sorry to all kraken lovers).

If anyone has seen anything that looks like my Stark one or IS my stark one but from the retailers original site let me know please.  Also if anyone is wanting a targ one like those above I've found [this](http://www.pointsalestore.com/samsung-galayy-s3/606-game-of-throne-galaxy-s3-case.html) also available as iphone case I believe in their site.

Am i missing something, the only thing i can thing of is that the sons of Walder that helped with the act werent eating with them so could break the guest rights?

Any thoughts on this would be appreciated, but like i said i only read it last night so I am not much farther than this so try not to give too much away.  

Let me know if i need to spoiler tag anything? 

Thanks in advance

What was it based on?  Did he have an ancestor that was on the throne at some point?  Was it because he was the strongest, in terms of political support, of the usurpers?

Did Ned Stark have just as much right to claim the throne as Robert? 

A little What If here : Would Rickard or Brandon Stark have taken the throne if they could have assassinated King Aerys?  If not a Stark, then who had the political capital to make a worthy claim?  If this did occur, would Rhaegar Targaryen have acquiesced knowing that his father was bat shit insane and he could lead a happy, peaceful life with Lyanna? 

Ok.  Found some answers in the GoT wiki:


&gt; Robert claimed the Iron Throne because he started the war and killed Prince Rhaegar personally.[2] Robert also had the best claim to the throne as a result of being related to the Targaryens of old through his mother's side.[3] The other leaders of the rebels both refused the throne. 

Source: http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Robert%27s_Rebellion

So, Robert's claim was pretty damn tenuous and anyone could have made a valid claim as long as they had some bannermen behind them.  I would still love to hear what people think of Rhaegar giving up his claim to the throne to lead an easy life with Lyanna.

Why do you think they did this?  Many character's actions have been combined into the acts of one character.  From what they've done so far, Brienne's journey with Jamie is completely different.  

The death of Jamie's kin was also immensely changed.  Do you think this is because there would be too many characters going on at once?  Often in the books you may read for hours between hearing from the same characters.

Could it be that too much would be going on at once?  Are they narrowing the plot to make it more consumable for viewers?  

Finally, do you think these changes have been good, or bad?

I bought GoT-RPG for the PS3 on launch. Didn't really get a chance to play it much, had a hard time getting past the screen tearing on a console game. I mean, seriously. The dog was beyond ugly - it looks  more like a naked mole-rat. Put it away. Lately I've been wanting to play that game again, but A: I still remember with horror the screen tearing and the naked mole rat, and B: I rarely get time on my PS3 anymore having a 2 year old son. Usually the better option for me is playing on my (well equipped) laptop, and since it generally outperforms all the consoles handily these days, generally speaking, if I have a choice, I'll play a game on my PC now. I love Steam's Big Picture feature. When the tot's in bed, I can hook the pc up to my glorious 55"" 3DTV via HDMI, and life is grand. 


**The Hardware:**

PS3 version (on a PS3) vs.
PC Version on an Alienware m14xr2, i7-3720qm cpu, 8gb ram, nvidia gtx 650m w/2gb ddr5. running w7x64 ultimate

As you can see this is a fairly beefy laptop. A desktop could be built that would smoke it for under $800, but portability is a key factor for me, so i kind of have to go with a laptop. For bang vs. buck, the alienware m14 is pretty good. But this isn't a hardware review, I digress...

Now I will say this comparison comes with a *major* caveat: I've really just begun this game. I've played enough that I feel I can make a fair performance comparison, but this doesn't speak to the overall quality of the game.

** The Comparison:** 
Started the game, went to video options, noticed that there really isn't much there - resolution, texture detail, and 'game detail', whatever that means. NO AA adjustment, that's worrying. Yes I can adjust this stuff in the game profile in the nvidia control panel, but still, this does not bode well. there's also gamma adjustment, but as that has zero impact on performance, it doesn't factor in here. This being a console game, I pushed everything to max, set my resolution to 720p, and let her rip. For most games, dialing back the res to 720p allows me to run with max settings otherwise and still rock a nice 30+ framerate, so games generally look and play way better than on the consoles, load times are minimal thanks to my SSD, and generally the draw distance, if it is a factor, is WAYYYY farther out (think open world games like Assassin's creed). And if object population (like npcs) is a configurable item, I can usually turn that way up too.

Right off the bat I noticed that despite having a profile configured to not allow screen tearing in this game (the trade off is a lower framerate, sometimes dramatically so), I noticed in the intro that there still was **some** minor tearing. This is not good. What this tells me is that this game was very poorly programmed. I've knew it was bad, but this is *really* bad. So lets see how things go..

Things get somewhat better from there. I really hate the default dog, so when I bought the game on steam, I choked up the extra 99cents and got the 'dog pack' dlc as well. yes I know this is basically horse armor, but at least that dog doesn't look so freaking terrible anymore. I actually bought all the DLC at once, but this isn't a review of that content since I haven't actually got there. The Dog Pack allows you to pic either basically the original, a doberman skin, or a st. bernard/bulldogish looking skin. both are major improvements.

Watching the intro, the game definitely looks better, but the framerate is still shockingly low and the lighting effects are poor. Entire characters pop in and out of shadow when moving barely at all, and the lighting effects on Mors' executed friend/target during the initial chase scene is weird. his face pock-marks are all glowy and weird. More laziness or unskilled talent.

The thing that gets me is the art style is enjoyable. I feel like the characters all look really good, as well as the environments that I saw. It was the implementation that sucked. 

So the game definitely plays better with a mouse &amp; keyboard - no surprise there. What really surprised me however, again back to graphics, was that there was a noticable lag that actually GETS WORSE AS THE GAME SESSION GOES ON. What we have here is some sort of memory leak. On my system, after about 15 minutes, it basically becomes unplayable. I did not notice this on the ps3.

Overall, on the PS3 the general performance of the game was dialed back so much that it renders the game playable but really ugly. On the PC, the game looks much better, but even on a relatively powerful laptop with a discrete graphics adapter, as system that can run Witcher 2 at 30 FPS or better with most settings set to high, GoT runs poorly. It never actually CRASHED on me, but the memory leak/lag bug is bad enough that after about 15-20 minutes I need to exit and reload the game to continue.

**The VERDICT:**

This sucks. I really didn't think it would be this bad on pc.  I really do want to play the game. the story seems interesting, and I love ASOFAI. I'm the freaking target audience. But I have a limited amount of gaming time, and much as I'd like to give my RPG time to this game, I think I may end up shelving it for another year, or at least until I can finally play on a desktop again. It's a shame though, it really is.

Cyanide really deserves a smack upside the head over this. 7 years of development and they basically release a good alpha, or a bad beta. I understand if the console versions ran like shit but the pc version was ok, as a rushed port can do that, but apparently the pc version isn't that much better. it's shameful. You can't even blame this on HBO rushing the game out the door because they had **SEVEN YEARS.**

As much as I can't believe I'm saying this: don't buy. seriously, don't even bother. There are a hundred better RPGS. I can't even say ""if you MUST play it, play it on a *blank*"", because both versions have shitty bugs. The PS3 version is probably better b/c of stability, but given the lack of patches, who knows? 

/sigh

oh yeah, one more thing, that artbook that came with the ps3 verion? it's basically a fancy resume for the team. it's really something that shouldn't have been shared with the public - but used to market cyanide to publishers. The irony is after seeing this game, I wouldn't want my name attached to it. ugh.

I've just finished AFFC and while it was not one of my favourite books of the series I still enjoyed what it had to offer. However, I take great caution in wondering what events are going to make it a gripping season. I'm still yet to be convinced that a few major events (listed below) will qualify for good viewing:

Important events:

- Kingsmoot and the extended Greyjoy family

- Bloodless battle of Riverrun (Jamie/Blackfish/Edmure)

- Dragonstone, Loras Tyrell and the crumbling relationship between the Tyrells and the Lannisters (which leads to the arrest of Cersei)

- Minor appearances from Stoneheart/Catelyn and Brienne (perhaps this relationship leads into bigger things in ADWD -- I don't know I haven't read them)

- The emergence of Dorne

- Littlefinger, Sansa and the plot to reclaim Winterfell

- The individual adventures of Sam and Arya

Perhaps they need to include things like Cersei's vision flashbacks and introduce Rhaegar Targaryen.

Like the book, it seems like it will be a transition season but more importantly without characters like Tyrion and Dhanearys I wonder if they will lose some appeal from the wider audience.

Did i skip a chapter without noticing? Or was that made up for the show and never mentioned in the books? Or was it one of those things where they pulled stuff from other books into this plotline? I ask because that was one of my favorite lines. Thanks :)

Also, I was unsure about what constitutes a spoiler, is it just major plot points? Or also any quote from the book? I tagged everything just to be safe.


Edit: I'll add here SerSquelch's answer, since it was the most helpful but got buried.

As PeppermintDinosaur said, that line was invented for the show and is mentioned in the ""Inside HBO's Game of Thrones"" book written by Bryan Cogman, specifically page 7 of the Foreword. You can find this in Google Books. http://books.google.com/books?id=c9k6vYn14Q0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inside+hbo%27s+a+game+of+thrones&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Y8_bUJuZBaHm0gGk9YHABA&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAA

I think Tyrion is aerys' son

1. it kept bugging me about how they always mention his mismatched eyes and that one is purple. Daenrys' eyes are purple. 

2. I recall how when Tywin was hand of aerys something happened. I know that he spurned him with not having rhaeger marry cersei. But I think something else happened and that was why he took off. I think he had his way with Tywin's wife. Knocked her up. Whether Tywin knew that wasn't his baby or not doesn't matter and is irrelevant. He'd treat him the same if it was his dwarf son or someone else's dwarf son. Though I wouldn't doubt he wanted to kill him if it was another man's but unless his wife made him promise. 

3. Tyrions mother died giving birth to him. Just as daenrys' mother died giving birth to her. And if we are to believe that Jon is also rhaeger's son, lyanna died giving birth to him. 

4. There's three heads to a dragon is repeated. 

So if that is all true, whose claim is best? Daenrys and Tyrion are both children of aerys and Jon is rhaeger's son. Tyrion would be older than daenrys and male. But daenrys is a dragon. Jon is definitely not since he got burnt. Tyrion being a dragon is in question since I don't recall if fire affects him. 

I had other clues but I forgot them :(

Characters do not immediately know the same things as the reader, making the entire series much more immersive (without being frustrating in the ""yell at the movie screen"" type of way).

One thing that irritates me, however, is how *nobody* in Westeros knows that Daenerys has not one but three dragons. At one point, Jorah Mormont admitted to spying on Daenerys for Robert (or someone else?) but quit before the dragon eggs hatched (again, not sure, maybe?). How is it that Robert got someone so close to Daenerys but nobody else has any interest in what's going on with her? Every time she's mentioned by a Westerosi it's always ""rumors of dragons"" that everyone dismisses. Is there not a single reliable informant in the Free Cities who reports to someone in Westeros?

If I were king, or claimant, this seems like something I'd like to know with absolute certainty. Is this a gaping logical hole or am I missing some puzzle piece?
