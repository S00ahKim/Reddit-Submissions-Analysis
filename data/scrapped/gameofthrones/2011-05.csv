If you don't know this theory the logic is as follows:
The war started because Rhaegar abducted Lyanna. She was betrothed to Robert.  Rhaegar wasn't an ass like Viserys though. Seemed to be universally respected. What if lyanna went willingly? Maybe she was pregnant with rhaegars kid, which is why the kings guard were protecting her when Ned, Howland Reed, etc showed up to rescue her.

She died in ""her bloody bed"".  Is that childbirth?  This would make John an heir to the targaryens (though still illegitimate, since rhaegar was married at the time).

Also explains Ned's secrecy w/ Catyln.  As Ned was honorable he took the shame of allegedly fathering a ""snow"" rather than break his vow to his sister.

And why would lyanna want the secret kept? To protect John. Imagine how pissed Robert would've been had he known John was rhaegar and lyannas? He would have killed the kid.

(i don't consider anything in this post a plot spoiler, but i talk about characters and the overall story a lot, so if you're just watching the show, don't bother reading.)",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/h6cmy/in_response_to_all_the_dislike_for_sansa_and_love/,myhouseisgod,1304809206,"i find sansa's chapters absolutely fascinating.  her POV gives so much insight about what life is really like in Martin's world.  As a contrast, Arya's chapters don't give much information about the world.  Arya's chapters are about Arya, she is a cool character that people like and can root for.  But she doesn't offer anything else.  

Sansa, to the reader, shows what it is really like for a noble girl to grow up in Martin's world.  Arya, on the other hand, refuses to participate in the social world she is born into.  For this reason, I am far more interested  in Sansa.  Arya is great, but overall, not very interesting.  Of course i love her chapters, but generally i race through them to get to the ""real stuff"" of the series.  

when i look at the series as a whole, i can't help but think that Arya is mostly unnecessary. she doesn't provide any ""meat"" for the story; she doesn't interact with main players.  she is useful to the extent that she demonstrates what happens when someone, in Martin's world, refuses to participate in the ""game."" She also gives the reader a look into the corners of Westeros, not necessarily the common folk, but the well-off but not politically engaged people of westeros.  

Sansa, however, plays the game even though she is thrown into it much before she is really ready to participate.  She is incredibly important because she is *totally* a product of the social and political world into which she is born, and thus, carries a huge amount of information about the whole damn series.  

her path is ""one of the toughest and cruelest"" in the series (this was originally just a reply to someone's comment in another thread, so im using their words there).  As a character, Sansa bears a huge amount of responsibility in terms of communicating to the reader how individuals interact in this world. her chapters are tough because there is so much to digest. 

if you can come to understand sansa, you learn most of what there is to know about Westeros.  the other key character is Cersei (and she is probably even more important than sansa).  Jamie and Tyrion are also *very* helpful.  The other characters in the story are great, they are interesting, they have very intriguing plots, but don't do a whole lot of the work of world building.  Martin is amazing, in my opinion, because he is really creating an enormous world, all of which is consistent and, so far, very interesting.  the non-players are great and enjoyable, but it seems to me that their plots simply play by the rules established by other characters' POV's rather than inform the reader of what exactly the rules are.   


i dunno, right now i feel all up on a high horse yelling ""you guys just don't get it!""  and im sorry if this comes off as conceded, but seriously, i feel like if all you like about the series is arya, jon, bran etc; you are doing a very shallow reading of the books.

maybe im just reading the tone of all the discussion here very wrong. or maybe my personal taste influences my perception of this whole thing too much.  maybe i just like certain aspects of the story and other people like different aspects.  if that's the case, then whatever, no accounting for taste, read the story how you like and enjoy!  

PS:
i honestly don't know if anything up there is a spoiler, if someone wants to suggest something be hidden, let me know.

I'm glad that we have distinguished the black and red colors for the show and book spoilers respectively, but since all four of the books are lumped under the color red, there is no way of knowing if its safe for me to scroll over the tag.  I've already had a lot of the third and fourth books spoiled for me after scrolling over a tag I *thought* was concerning the first book.

Is there any way the community could start marking the book spoilers based on which book it is spoiling?  Whether that means preceding the spoiler tag with (Book 3 Spoilers) or something that lets the viewer know just which part of the time-line they'll be revealing.

For those of us who are only half way through the series, it would be amazing, since we still enjoy taking part in the discussions of the first book in relationship to the show, without having the latter parts of the series spoiled :)",22,11,False,self,,,,,

What would you recommend?


**Edit**
I just wanted to come back and say that I've been splitting the story up between the paperback and audiobook. I love it. I have downtime at work, so I usually read about 45 minutes each day (roughly 2 chapters). When I'm bored at home, and more often at a gym, I have a very easy time concentrating on the narration. That surprised me, since this is my first audiobook. I'm flying through the story and have already caught up with the series. I'm going to keep going, I want the story fresh in my mind when A Dance with Dragons is released. ",11,2,False,self,,,,,

I love them just the way they are, but I enjoy questions like this.

These books are huge, and the number of characters that come and go are many.  The plot at times seems laid out in front of you but it will then disappear for a whole book at a time.  Some sub-plots at times seem out of place.

So, do you love these things or do they drive you crazy?  Of course, without a conclusion to the series it may be hard to judge.  And the speed at which Martin writes can make his style of writing more frustrating.  Certainly he could have the whole saga written and finished in fewer pages than are now contained in the books that have been released, but would that be as good?

For me, I like the detail.  It's dirty and the plot lines are not straight.  There are surprises everywhere.  It feels real.  The POV chapter style can be frustrating, and it adds to the hugeness of the story;  while we're following one character's POV, others are off doing their thing.  

My only fear is that the time it takes for Martin to give us this detail will result in the series never being finished.  It would be painful to not see the end of this story.

It will be interesting to see how the TV series handles the sprawl in future seasons.  The first book is manageable, and the second not so bad, but if the series makes it past two seasons they'll face new challenges.

**TLDR:** How do you feel about the vast sprawling nature of the books?  Great detail, or should Martin get to the point?    ",5,0,False,self,,,,,

At first it was Winterfell that felt like a little keep with a dozen people in it, but I thought, just wait till they get to kings landing. Then they got to kings landing and it felt like a very pretty very abandoned part of town with an empty castle.  And I thought, just wait for the tournament! 

Then the tournament started and theres maybe a couple dozen people watching the jousting am I wrong, or shouldnt there be hundreds? This is the capital of the kingdom having the equivalent of a superbowl sporting event

How the fuck is HBO going to fit all the events of Book 1 into six more episodes? I thought they were going at a good pace (pagewise), but the remaining events are far more epic and not devoting enough screentime to them could make the episodes really helter-skelter.

Should I go on to the next book immediately or wait and draw it out a bit, considering GRRM's diminished pace over the past two installments? At the pace I'm going, I might be finished with the four that are out before the next one hits shelves!

What do I have to look forward to/not look forward to in the novels?  I've heard less than stellar things about the 4th installment...

I'm absolutely loving this series.  People have complained about it being exposition and dialog heavy but I don't mind that.  The complexity and immersion is amazing.  I'm glad that HBO didn't shy away from that and from someone who didn't read the novels, while it can be a bit confusing, it's fun piecing it all together.  Anyway, I don't want explicit answers but I'm incredibly curious about the direction.  Onto my questions...

* I'm assuming this season follows one single novel.  So, this season can we expect that winter will come?  There's so much discussion about it I can't wait to see what it's like.  If we're 2 seasons in and they're still talking about, ""You've never seen anything like winter. It's more brutal than anything you can imagine."" I won't be able to take it anymore.
* Will we see supernatural elements?  There's talk of what's beyond the wall, the dire wolves seems mystical, the dragon talk. I don't want to know specifics but I want to know if we can expect that type of thing in the season. I mistakenly read part of another post that discussed in previous novels the reason the kingdoms were conquered was in part due to the dragons so it almost sounds like that part is behind us and maybe they are dead.  Again, a yes or no will suffice.  I don't want specifics of what to expect.
* Will Ned's son walk again?  I'm almost hesitant to ask this one and maybe I should wait. There seems to be some foreshadowing. A cryptic answer followed by something covered by the spoiler tag for others would be great.",14,6,False,self,,,,,

Here are my two personal theories to throw into the mix.  You don't need to point out the evidence that is stronger for the more popular theories, that's why they're more popular.  I just don't doubt that Martin's is directing the theories where he wants them to go.

Theory #1

 My first theory is an alternate to R+L=J, its just another possibility that I consider, but even I would probably vote for the popular R+L=J theory if I had to choose.  But anyways here it is: R+L=J, but R = Robert.


* Robert was betrothed to Lyanna.
* Robert does not seem like the kind of man to wait for a wedding to bed his woman.
* Rhaegar may have loved Lyanna as well, but missed his chance after she was betrothed to Robert and Lyanna fell in love with Robert.  He 'kidnapped' her hoping that she still loved him, found out that she was pregnant with Robert's child, and decided to keep her safe anyways, away from the war in the Tower of Joy.
* Lyanna made Ned promise her that he would tell Robert that the child was his.  After learning that Robert would be betrothed instead to Cersei, Ned decided that telling Robert was impossible.  It would probably lead to another war with the Lannisters when Robert declared Jon his heir.  Or the child would have to be killed in order to save the peace.
* Ned has thoughts about broken promises right after Robert's death, meaning he failed to ever tell him that Jon was his son.


Ok, that's theory #1, admittedly, I still believe Rhaegar is Jon's father because Jon deserves to be one of the three heads of the Dragon.  And Dany's vision is probably the strongest piece of evidence that isn't covered in my theory.

Theory #2

Instead of A+J=T, I'm putting up for consideration A+J=C+J.

* Cersei and Jamie have a very 'Targaryen like' relationship.
* Cersei and Jamie both lack the sheer cunning that Tywin and Tyrion share.
* After years of failed attempts at an heir, even though they weren't his own children, Tywin accepted Cersei and Jamie as his own so that he may have an heir.
* Once Jamie joined the Kingsguard and Tywin was left without an heir he tried again for years more, and finally Joanna conceived Tyrion, Tywin's biggest shame.  Tyrion's aunt, forget her name, makes a comment about how Tyrion is the most like his father out of his children.
* Cersei takes after the mad king with her paranoia and cruelty.
* Jamie has started on the road to redemption and could become the third head of the dragon.
* This leaves Tyrion to embrace what the world views him as and become the tragic villain later in the story.  I see his final encounter with Jamie becoming the pinnacle of the story's climax in a later book.


Feel free to pick this apart, tell me how I'm obviously wrong, or find some other evidence that could lend support to these theories that I haven't seen covered elsewhere much.",15,11,False,self,,,,,

*[PART I]*

[Map of Westeros at the start of Robert's Rebellion](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QNgFA7OlZJ0/TaZVCUi6IcI/AAAAAAAABd0/Ol8vuzkGHxs/s1600/Map_Westeros_Political.gif) - 100% safe

**The Beginning of the War** (LOW/NO SPOILER (VERY SAFE) - most details have already been implied on the show, larger spoilers omitted)

[Mad King Aerys Targaryen](http://www.terra-di-mezzo.it/immagini/amok/hr/aerys2.jpg)

[Book Spoiler](/b ""Outraged over ongoing indiscretions of the Royal Family, heir to the North and Ned's older brother, Brandon Stark rode to King's Landing to protest the actions of the Targaryens.  Mad King Aerys Targaryen turned out to be a most unreasonable man, and perceived this indignation as a threat and insult.  After arresting Brandon, Rickard Stark, father of Ned and Lord of Winterfell, comes to King's Landing with a small host of men.  Aerys took both Starks, as well as their escort (including the nephew and heir to Jon Arryn, Elbert Arryn) captive, held a dubious show trial, and then burned them all alive, with one exception: witness Ethan Glover as the sole survivor."")

(On a side note, this is exactly why I agree that Sean Bean is the best suited person to play Ned Stark.  I heard many people argue for Liam Neeson, but Liam always strikes me as the eldest/only child.  Sean Bean comes across better as the middle child that had to step up.)

[Book Spoiler](/b ""However, this burnt offering was not enough to appease Mad King Aerys, as he then called for the heads of Ned Stark and the closest friend and ally to Ned, Robert Baratheon - who were both squiring at the Eyrie under Jon Arryn.  Jon Arryn was too noble and decent a man to turn over his students, and undoubtedly outraged at the death of his nephew and heir, so instead raised his banners in revolt.  Many of the lords and nobles of the Vale opted to remain loyal to Aerys, and Jon Arryn was forced to capture Gulltown from the loyalist Lord Grafton, to secure ships so that Robert could flee to his home of Storm's End to muster his army, where he was rightful Lord.  At the same time, Ned took a ship to Winterfell, calling his own banners and hastily arranging a marriage to Catelyn Tully of Riverrun (who had been set to marry Brandon Stark before his untimely death), bringing the longtime friend of the Starks, Hoster Tully, into the conflict on their side (though many Tully Lords and bannermen remained loyal to Aerys, or took no side).   The rebellion had begun."")

**Battle of Summerhall** (LOW/NO SPOILER (VERY SAFE))

[Book Spoiler](/b ""Not all of Robert's bannermen came to his aid when he summoned them.  Lords Fell, Cafferen, and Grandison chose to side with King Aerys, and planned to join their smaller forces at Summerhall to form a single large army, capable of crushing Robert's.  Unexpectedly, Robert took the initiative, and attacked each Lord in turn before they could merge forces.  Fighting three battles in one day, Robert scored three victories, crushing opposition within his lands and scoring the first major victories of the war.  Lord Fell was slain, while Cafferen and Grandison bent their knee and joined Robert in his cause.  King Aerys blamed the defeat on his hand, Lord Merryweather, stripping him of his lands and titles and exiling him to die.  Lord Jon Connington became the next hand, and vowed to take a more active role in stopping Robert."")

[Book Spoiler](/b ""Robert left a sizeable portion of his army under his loyal brother, Stannis (and young Renly), to hold his capital and home of Storm's End, while he marched westward."")

**Battle of Ashford** (LOW/NO SPOILER (VERY SAFE))

[Book Spoiler](/b ""Mace Tyrell of Highgarden, loyal to the crown, lead his much larger force to meet Robert at Ashford.  Randyll Tarly of Horn Hill lead the vanguard of the Tyrell forces, pressed into Robert's force in a bloody but indecisive skirmish - one that sent Robert into a northwards retreat before the larger Tyrell force could join the battle.  With Robert fleeing northward, and Jon Connington moving to pursue from the east, Mace Tyrell marched his forces to lay siege Storm's End (along with the Redwyne navy [from the Arbor]."")

During the battle, Randyll Tarly (Sam's [Jon Snow's fat friend's] Father) killed Lord Cafferen and sent his head to King Aerys."") ",52,141,False,self,,,,,

And the added scenes in the other episodes as well... they all added something valuable to the story without changing it, and I am *loving* that!

I think my favorite added scene so far is the one where Robert, Ser Barristan and Jaime are sharing war stories, but this might just be because I'm so fond of Ser Barristan.",84,66,False,self,,,,,

Then I realized that there were no scenes with The Wall, or the Night's Watch.

To me, the whole concept of the Wall, and the Night's Watch protecting the realm from the enigmatic White Walkers is what's making the show for me.  Although I only have limited knowledge of GoT so far, I feel like it is what separates this series from other fantasy novels/movies so far.  There is something very romantic (not sure if this is the right word to use), about the Night's Watch, peering out over the wall and the snow covered land scape, with nothing but a small fire for comfort, while the cold breeze and darkness engulfs him.  I don't blame Jon Snow for romanticizing and admiring the Night's Watch.

Comments below should follow the usual rules of course, but this thread is quite likely to go into spoiler topics.*

I finally got to watch all of episode five last night. Just when I thought it was over, something new struck me: The music for ending credits is changing.

**Episode 1:** Bran goes down. *The GoT theme plays over the credits.*

**Episode 2:** Bran comes up. *The GoT theme repeats.*

**Episode 3:** Arya's dancing lesson. *A different tune plays over the credits.*

**Episode 4:** Cat at the inn. *Another new tune, this one slow, simple and haunting.*

**Episode 5:** Ned in the street. *The tune from #4 repeats.*

Lannisters are prominent in the endings of both of the last two episodes. I reserve the right to change my mind later, but for now...

We may have heard our first variation on *The Rains of Castamere.*

Welcome to the game of Musical Thrones. The object is to start identifying bits of the soundtrack used as themes. We might have less than a month to play this game; the official soundtrack will be released in June and there will likely be more information released prior to that.

If anyone is in a position to post some short ""fair usage"" clips from those ending tunes, that would be a big help. It would also be interesting to know where tunes have been used (especially reused) throughout the show so far. I would particularly like to know if the tune from the end of episodes 4 and 5 has been used anywhere else, and if so, whether there were Lannisters making moves in the vicinity. The tune from the end of #3 is a different mystery for now.

So... here's another angle to come at this from. I hope others are interested as well.",11,20,False,self,,,,,

King Robert *was* married to Ned's sister, and when she died he married Cersei. Who is sister of Jaime and Tyrion. But she's only fucking her twin. 

Daenerys and Viserys Father was the mad king who was killed by Jaime.

Jorah is the one who warned the King about Daenerys' being pregnant.

I just started re-reading the books, and started remembering how different things can be with the difference.  With Robb only being fourteen at the start of the novel, and Daenerys being much older as well, it seems like the tone of certain things changes.  In the show it seems like Robb is about ready to run the castle, but in the book I found it much more of a big deal that he's running Winterfell at only fourteen.

I can guess why they did the change.  For starters, it's kind of hard to show all of Daenerys' scenes if she was only thirteen.

For me, Nikki as Jaime definitely takes pride of place.  Never heard of the actor before, thought he looked a little too dark and serious.  Jaime was going to be a hard part to get right, but it would ruin the series if they got him wrong.  Then bam, we get a Jaime that looks perfect (more aristocratic than the blonde vampire from True Blood, less masculine than Aaron Eckhart) and completely nails the part beyond my wildest expectations.  He's stolen every scene he's been in.

The Wall has been great as well.  Between the inherent illogic of the structure, all the CGI that would be needed, and the difficulty of filming snow, I was worried it would end up looking silly.

[](/?""During the time we meet The Hound he goes through quite a large character change, in my opinion one of the most rapid and significant in the whole series. He is literally sobbing with remorse during his last encounter with Sansa and he nearly beats Arya to death when she mentions Micah the butchers boy.

[BOOK AND TV SPOILERS WITH SPECULATION],https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/hhhog/a_thought_regarding_jon_snows_mother_book_and_tv/,CerpinTaxt11,1306094446,"I've always liked the Rhaegar and Lyanna theories, and now with my second read-through, I'm noticing lots of allusions towards it (Ned saying that it doesn't matter who his mother is, all that matters is that he ""has my blood"", also the deathbed ""Promise me Ned..."".

I'm not 100% sure if what I'm gonna say makes sense, or is true. I'd like someone who is more familiar with the book to verify this thought.

Jon Snow is 14 years old. At one stage in GoT, Cat begins thinking of Winterfell, and remembering each of her children. When she thinks of the bastard son, she says something along the lines of ""Jon is as old as Ned was when he fathered him, that's a strange thought.""

However, later when Ned is in the dungeon of the Red Keep, he recalls a tourney at Harrenhall where he was 18 years old. Rhaegar and The Mad King are alive at this flashback. The battle of the Trident must have happened later. This means that Jon Snow is too young to be born at this stage, so he was not a result of R+L.

Does this sound right? Can someone verify that quote? I can't find it at the moment.

It compliments the scenes very well, and I know that's tough to do.  But there's nothing really *memorable* about the music, and for story of such grandeur and scope it seems a bit disappointing.  The Houses could have had their own themes, each character a theme, etc.  There was a lot of potential.

So, I thought I'd start a discussion on it for anyone else who's into musical scores.  My choices more to *suggest* a style and approach that I think would have been better for certain subjects in the show.  I'm *not* saying that these choices are THE choices that should've been made.  Admittedly the choices will be very subjective, and you might hate them.  That's why I see this list as more of a discussion starter, because I'd love to hear other people's suggestions.  

Here's my list for music that would've, in my opinion, fit better:


* [The Starks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRLdhFVzqt4)
* [Arya](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgwNTle8FAY)
* [The Targaryens*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr--ikdFLWk&amp;feature=related)
* [Daenerys](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExvMlCHvHHA)
* [House Lannister](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYhE52fZPMU)
* [Tyrion](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--Zm4GIKsVw&amp;feature=related)

I didn't have time to do more, and not each of the tracks applies perfectly, but that should give a taste of what I think was possible.  If nothing else, if you read the books then this might be a sort of score for the version in your head. :)

Now, I had imagined that the special thing about a Valyrian steel blade was the way it was made, all the forging and folding and other things dependent on the skill of the blacksmith, rather than the material itself.  I thought that the skills required to produce these blades were lost during the Valyria's Doom, hence the reason for the great value of the surviving weapons and why they are so popular as the anscestral weapons of houses.   [Book Spoiler](/b ""That it seemed so simple to melt one of these swords down and whip up two more seems slightly off to me."") 

So, is my knowledge of sword-making completely off and thus am I completely mistaken in my assessment of where the value of these swords comes from? Is it in fact just the steel itself that is important?

I think my impression is mostly based on half remembered bits of information from a number of (probably mainly fictional) sources in the back of my head about sword making in Japan, where the katanas were such good weapons because of the folding of the blades during forging.",26,10,False,self,,,,,

This is either a huge plot hole, or Jon isn't as great as we assumed him to be.

It's common knowledge that Jon [Book Speculation](/? ""is a Targaryen."") We assume he's destined for great things. However, true dragons can't be burnt. Jon [Book Spoiler](/b ""had his hand burnt during the wight attack in Castle Black."")This leaves 3 possibilities.

1. [Book Spoiler](/b ""R+L=J is false. He's simply not Rhaegar's son."") This is certainly possible, since we have no concrete evidence of [Book Spoiler](/b ""R+L=J."")

2. Jon isn't that great after all. He's merely a [Book Spoiler](/b ""Viserys-level Targarygen. ouch..."") Not very likely, since Jon is one of the protagonists of the series.

3. It's a plot hole.

What do y'all think? Good idea? Bad? Will it work? Where and who do I send it too? Else one else want to do it (if enough do, it might gain some traction/attention).

Both were counter theories to the popular ones about Jon Snow's and Tyrion's lineage.  I won't go into it in depth again here, but I theorized that Jamie/Cersei were actually Targaryens and Tyrion was his father's only true son.

After watching episode 7 I want to take that back.  I'm back on board with thinking that Tyrion is the bastard Lannister.  Why?
   

Because with the show, we now have another possible source for clues to go along with the books.  And because of their brevity, its become obvious that the show has to sacrifice some of the subtlety they the books are able to maintain.  A good example of this would be the scene with Joffery and Sansa kissing in Episode 7.  The show can't spend several scenes showing minor interactions between the two, or Sansa conversing with Jeyne and her other friends about Joffery.  They need to get to the point, and jack up the intensity of what scenes they do have together in order to bring the characters to the correct point in their relationship in less time.


This brings me back to the point of this post, and speculating about Tyrion's lineage.  I believe the scene last night that introduced Tywin was one of those added by the writers to condense a whole lot of character development into a single scene.  And just like the book, there need to be clues about about future plot twists so that once those twists are revealed, we'll revisit those quotes from book and scenes from the show and thing ""fuuckk... I totally missed that clue.  Now that I know the twist, it totally changes what I imagine the character is thinking""


I imagine that Martin has made the two executive producers of the show privy to knowledge about some of these plot twists he's planning later.  This would prevent the show from having the characters contradict what they know, but the reader/watcher has yet to find out.  Episode 7 was one of the episodes written directly by Benioff and Weiss.  And in that scene with Tywin the dialog between him and Jamie had Jamie constantly referring to Tyrion as ""my brother this, my brother that.""  And Tywin referring to him as ""one of us, he's a Lannister, my blood.""  But I don't believe he was ever once referred to as ""your son"" by Jamie or ""my son"" by Tywin.  And I feel like the clue didn't have the subtlety that I mentioned above.  You don't write a scene with long dialog like that about Tyrion and never explicitly establishing the father/son relationship without doing it intentionally.

So to me, that scene may have not hinted anything about Tyrion being a Targaryen, but I felt it was certainly a heavy-handed clue that Tywin is not his father.


**tl;dr** The conversation between Jamie and Tywin in Ep. 7 leads me to believe that Tyrion is not Tywin's son.

I mean, Im all for sex, and theres plenty of it in the book series. I was prepared for HBO to ramp up the sex factor, and even prepared for a Loras and Renly love scene, albeit jokingly, but after watching the early premiere for Episode 7 I felt like they went beyond their usual tawdry self. 

While the scene lasted about 5 minutes, most of it was completely unnecessary. I understand the need for Littlefinger to give us some back story on his [TV Spoiler](/s ""Catelyn Tully crush and the battle against her betrothed""), but play with her ass while hes mid-sentence in revealing his lost love story? Too much. Give us a minute of back story and instead of 4 minutes of lesbian boobage, you give us direwolves (remember them?) or explain why [TV Spoiler](/s ""Dany is eating a horse heart""). You know, actual story. 
	
In my opinion that scene was there strictly for the girl-on-girl action. It was forced, cheap, and changed my views toward the show. HBO, there is plenty of sex in the series; you really dont need to add any more. The intelligence and grace of the books are slowly being lost thanks to this kind of directing. If I wanted to watch porn, Id go watch porn and I sure as hell wouldnt pay $15 a month for it. Im paying to see my favorite book series come to life as no other network could produce and theyre bringing it down to the level of True Blood. Seriously, HBO? Have some class. These arent Twilight fans youre dealing with; we expect more.

Im sure some of my male counterparts may disagree with my feelings on this, and thats to be expected. I was just disappointed with HBOs need to flaunt sex so desperately that they would forego any real story telling. The books are hard enough to condense; you would think that they would want to put in as much detail as possible. But no time for that! MOAR BOOBS!

Other than that particular scene, I loved the episode.

If HBO decides to keep adding cheap sex scenes instead of showing all the amazing things in the book that they had to cut (in order to fit in the cheap sex scenes), I might have to cancel my subscription. 

(Id probably still watch, but HBO can kiss my money goodbye if they're not going to do it justice.)

Here's all I can think of (just listing names, not considering how feasible it is they are the one that dies early:

 [Book Spoiler](/b ""Sandor (presumed), Tywin, Lord Hoster Tully, Joffrey, Balon Greyjoy, Robb Stark (those three named by Melisandre)."") I'm sure there are more, as is the nature of the show, but that's what I could come up with right now.

Personally, my guess is [Book Spoiler](/b ""Lord Hoster Tully (Catelyn's father)"")

Now, I am currently reading chapter 24 and here are my questions: 

[Book Spoiler](/b ""Cat lets Jaime go in hopes her daughter Sansa will be released right? Now, where in the books ever did we get the indication that Cat would EVER do something like this? I understand it ""was for love"" but really it just seems like our beloved author used Cat as a quick way to start a new part of the story. Wouldn't Cat always be loyal to Robb? I just do not understand her motivation or where it came from can anyone explain it better to me?"") 

 Also, just wanted to say I love this book 3 but, [Book Spoiler](/b ""Robb is my favorite king so far and it upsets me so much that everything he was working for is coming apart! Someone please (in a spoiler free way) tell me it turns out okay for him?"") 

EDIT: last question is really just me acting like a silly fanboy because book 3 is seriously messing with my emotions :) 

UPDATE: I read 2 messages telling me to not read this thread and update as I read the book. So, I am not reading comments until I finish the book but am updating as I read through it. 

Oh my God, I just read [Book Spoiler](/b ""the wedding of Sansa and was glued to the book from when Tywin reveals his plans all the way til when the Unsullied are purchased. Both of those events were crazy. I felt so terribly sad for Sansa. She was really hoping to love Willas and then boom, another punch to the gut. Then, stealing the Unsullied? So badass, I don't even really want her to win the kingdom back but, wow what a way to start making it happen."") Then I went to bed and am now reading again. Books 1 and 2 amazing. Book 3? Cannot look away from the glory. 

UPDATE 2: I am so upset after reading what I just read. [Book Spoiler](/b ""Robb was my favorite character and favorite king by far. I am literally feeling sad over this book. This puts me at somewhat more than halfway done with the book now. I am reading as much as possible with finals and full time work happening at the same time."") 

My only hope now is that Tyrion is as nice as I hope he is and does something totally amazing to get me feeling good about the book again. I mean feeling good as in not feeling so sad. XD 

UPDATE 3: I feel like a child after reading what I read. Everyone here knew what was coming! I should have been warned! But then the book would be spoiled :( 

FINAL UPDATE: Finished the book a few days ago. Holy cow man. The book ends and now in FoC we get no Tyrion or Jon Snow? Everyone says FoC is not that great but it can't be that bad right?",44,7,False,self,,,,,

&gt;I have been considering this casting for year. In the end, the one role that I am absolutely convinced about is Tywin Lannister. It simply must be Charles Dance.

&gt;He wasnt mentioned on the list, but Aidan Gillen would be incredible as Little Finger. He played Thomas Carcatti on The Wire, is Irish, and can play that slippery, mysterious character very well.

&gt;U got pretty close on most of them, but u were way off on Drogo!

Like if there was a tournament to the death?

Robert in his prime, Rheagar, Khal Drogo, Gregor Clegane, Sandor Clegane, Bronn, Jaime Lannister, Ser Arthur Dayne, Ser Barristan Selmy, Brandon Stark, Ned Stark, Loras Tyrell, Brienne, Grey Worm, Jon Snow, Syrio Forel

I think that's about it for the powerhouses, I'm sure I've forgot someone. It's hard to judge Jon Snow. Way back in the first book he said he was a better sword than Robb. In SoS he's training with one of the best nightswatchmen who I believe is better than he is, but he is getting better. Therefore I will consider what I think GRRM is aiming for at Jon Snow in his prime.

First one I'd elminate is Gregor Clegane. Well, that might be surprising, but I've always considered him to be mostly brute force. And sure, it's a whole lot of brute force, but I don't think he could beat, say, Jaime who is big, strong, and skilled. Besides, I've always imagined that he would get beat by Sandor. So I've got to place Sandor atop the Cleganes.

I don't think the unsullied could be on par with the top fighters in the land. I've got the feeling that they're all 7 or 8s out of 10s as far as fighting goes. So not grey worm.

I've got to place Barristan on top of Dayne

I got the feeling from reading that Jamie would beat Brienne at full health, but it would be a close fought thing. I'd still put him on top though.    

I like Bronn an awful lot, but I still feel like he's probably a second tier fighter. He could kill all the top knights in the land, but probably not take on say Jaime, at least not in a fair fight. And I know that ""not a fair fight"" thing is kind of Bronn's thing, but that's not what I'm talking about here.

Robert did beat Rheagar, but I'm not sure if that was a completely fair fight, how lucky Robert got etc. Still, there's not much to go off of, so I'd have to put Robert on top since they did fight and he won.

I wouldn't place Sandor over Barristan, Jamie, Robert etc, so I'll say bye to him.

It's hard to judge Brandon Stark's ability. Apparently he was the better sword than Ned, and Ned survived a fight with Arthur Dayne. Though the whole way that is presented makes it pretty clear that Dayne was better than Ned. Still, placing Brandon is difficult, but Ned is eliminated. I think Brandon has to be eliminated simply based off not enough information.

I want to call Jaime and Loras equals, and after all, they're presented exactly like that. There are tons of parallels between the two. That one is impossible for me to call. 

Syrio is hard to call as well, and I wouldn't be willing to call him better than some of the others, and besides, he fights a different way, it's apples and oranges. So I can't include him

So at this point I've got Loras, Jaime, Robert, Khal Drogo, and Barristan Selmy. I get the feeling Jaime/Loras are the top of their generation, but Barristan is a legend. So I'd put him as better than them in his prime, but do I think he could defeat Robert or Drogo? 

Short answer yes.

So I'll call him the best fighter in the series 

I did forget Strong Belwas. He's hard to place, but I'd definitely call him top tier. Maybe he'll fight Barristan at some point. ",54,5,False,self,,,,,

As someone that enjoys a journey, rather than the destination, I have no problem zooming ahead to reveal what may happen. Thusly, I have taken it upon myself to look ahead on wiki pages and peruse everyone's spoilers. 

In book 2, A Clash of Kings, while [Book Spoiler](/b ""Daenerys is in the house of the Warlocks, she is told that (3) is a significant representation in her life. Three dragons. Three deaths, of love, of blood, of gold. Etc. She is also told by the Qartheen that she is one of three, while she only suspected her and Viserys to be the surviving heirs. So keep that in mind...3.""

Now, while I have yet to find evidence in reading the book series of Jon Snow's true origin (there's nothing thus far saying he HAS to be Ned's bastard, it's merely assumed), [Book Spoiler](/b ""speculation has it that Jon Snow could be the result of the Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark. It is known that they steal away and it was Ned and Robert that steal upon them. Lyanna dies soon after. 

Now, it is widely known thus far that Lyanna's dying words were ""Promise me, Ned."" Robert also deeply loved Lyanna, HOWEVER, if Rhaegar and Lyanna DID birth a child, this child would be older than Viserys AND Daenerys. This child would also be of highborne decent, making him (or her) a rightful heir. Robert would have murdered 'jon snow' in order to rule the kingdom *had anyone found out Rhaegar and Lyanna had a child.* He certainly scared away Viserys and Daenerys. 

Perhaps this never comes to be. No one can tell what books 5, 6 and 7 shall bring. It did seem that there is more than sufficient evidence to make this true.

The second book/season is already on its way.  If we assume that each book will only be 1 season, and that there won't be an extended break between seasons(more than a year, that is), and that the whole series will be televised, then we can work on a timeline for the rest of the series being released.

2011 - Game of Thrones S1(AGoT)

2012 - Game of Thrones S2(ACoK)

2013 - Game of Thrones S3(ASoS)

2014 - Game of Thrones S4(AFfC)

2015 - Game of Thrones S5(ADwD)

2016 - Game of Thrones S6(TWoW)

2017 - Game of Thrones S7(ADoS)

This means that GRRM would have to have the final book completed around 2016, and TWoW around 2013-2014.  We know that he had to do some major rewriting between AFfC and ADwD which is the main cause for the delay.  We also know that he has a lot of TWoW written already, meaning we should see the last two novels after significantly shorter waiting periods.
