I went into a classroom where a professor was lecturing on ""Ancient History"" and had a large map of the GoT world pulled down.

Jon Snow refused to take Ned Stark's name, choosing instead to honor his vows.

In the dream his friends rode with him, as they had in life. Proud Martyn Cassel, Jory's father; faithful Theo Wull; Ethan Glover, who had been Brandon's squire; Ser Mark Ryswell, soft of speech and gentle of heart; the crannogman, Howland Reed; Lord Dustin on his great red stallion. Ned had known their faces as well as he knew his own once, but the years leech at a man's memories, even those he has vowed never to forget. In the dream they were only shadows, grey wraiths on horses made of mist.

They were seven, facing three. In the dream as it had been in life. Yet these were no ordinary three. They waited before the round tower, the red mountains of Dorne at their backs, their white cloaks blowing in the wind. And these were no shadows; their faces burned clear, even now. Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning, had a sad smile on his lips. The hilt of the greatsword Dawn poked up over his right shoulder. Ser Oswell Whent was on one knee, sharpening his blade with a whetstone. Across his white-enameled helm, the black bat of his House spread its wings. Between them stood fierce old Ser Gerold Hightower, the White Bull, Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.

""I looked for you on the Trident,"" Ned said to them.

""We were not there,"" Ser Gerold answered.

""Woe to the Usurper if we had been,"" said Ser Oswell.

""When King's Landing fell, Ser Jaime slew your king with a golden sword, and I wondered where you were.""

""Far away,"" Ser Gerold Said, ""or Aerys would yet sit the Iron Throne, and our false brother would burn in seven hells.""

""I came down on Storm's End to lift the seige,"" Ned told them, ""and the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne dipped their banners, and all their knights bent the knee to pledge us fealty. I was certain you would be among them.""

""Our knees do not bend easily,"" said Ser Arthur Dayne.

""Ser Willem Darry is fled to Dragonstone, with your queen and Prince Viserys. I thought you might have sailed with him.""

""Ser Willem is a good man and true,"" said Ser Oswell.

""But not of the Kingsguard,"" Sir Gerold pointed out. ""The Kingsguard does not flee.""

""Then or now,"" said Ser Arthur. He donned his helm.

""We swore a vow,"" explained old Ser Gerold.

Ned's wraiths moved up beside him, with shadow swords in hand. They were seven against three.

""And now it begins,"" said Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning. He unsheathed Dawn and held it with both hands. The blade was pale as milkglass, alive with light.

""No,"" Ned said with sadness in his voice. ""Now it ends."" As they came together in a rush of steel and shadow, he could hear Lyanna screaming. ""Eddard!"" she called. A storm of rose petals blew across a blood-streaked sky, as blue as the eyes of death.""

I'm 150 pages into ACOK and I just keep coming back to this piece.  The writing is simply chilling to me and brilliantly done.  The demeanor of the 3 indicates they knew they would die,  however will not stray from their vows.",93,344,False,self,,,,,

This might not best way to go about this, but I need to get it off my chest. 

So I binge watched all three seasons of the series this week for the first time (probably my first mistake). Needless to say I found scouring the internet for more stuff to watch after I ran out of episodes. Bad idea.
I found that /r/gameofthrones is nicely moderated and spoilers are almost always properly tagged. Thus, apart from a single incident, I did not run into any major spoilers here.

However, there is not enough content on this sub to fill the void, so I went on watching youtube videos. And even though the videos I watched themsvelves are not spoiler-y, the comments are. I know I shouldn't look at those but it almost happens naturally after I finish watching and some douchebags just can not keep themselves from ruining the experience.

So would like to ask the people who have gone through all of it (currently available books and the show) to judge how badly I messed up (and maybe point out in which book the events occur). Some tips on avoiding spoilers and gettting the most out of this awesome story in general would also be immensely appreciated.
I will put the spoilers in question in a tagged comment below to avoid ruining anyone else's day.


**TL;DR:** I messed up, but how badly? And how do I get the most out of GoT/ASOIAF from this point forward?

131,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2014-1-4,2014,1,4,17,1udqhx,self.gameofthrones,[Spoilers All] Fantasy Game of Thrones - fantasy football style! My Rule Set,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1udqhx/spoilers_all_fantasy_game_of_thrones_fantasy/,Nefertete,1388825501,"My husband and I did a rewatch of all seasons playing a fantasy football like version of Game of Thrones. It was a lot of fun even though we had seen the series a few times before so thought I would share. I'll do my best here to explain it.  
 Here is how it we did it and tweaked it to work. I'm not sure how well it would work with three or more people, this below worked great with two.  
Each Episode is a Game. Draft characters as detailed below. ""Game wins"" count towards winning a season, not total points scored. Points you score are listed below. After each season we can drop one char(after season 3 we agreed to be able to drop who we wanted) and pick up new one. Replace any dead chars that died on or after episode 9, otherwise you can replace them mid season. Looser picks first in the following season. In  our case my husband has not read books so for Season 4 he gets first picks regardless. Some chars change position after a season.  
First step we put together a pool of ""characters"" and labeled them based on what style of character they are. QBs were Great House Leaders/Rulers. RBs tend to get more points in kills/tortures/voilent stuff. WRs tend to get more sex points &amp; plot points. TEs get misc. points and have potential to win an episode but might not be good most episodes. Kickers may get some points here and there. Flex spot can contain anyone. X position is a Location, i.e. Kings Landing or Castle Black.  
.  

***How you get Points*** 
Each time a character  on your team does one of the following, tally up/remove appropriate points below &amp; make note of it for reference. At end of episode add total points to see who wins.  Draftable=major char. Named=char that has name. Minor=extra/nobody.   
  
Win Battle/Loose Battle (as general/king): +15/-10  
Kill Draftable/kill assist: +15/+5   
Sex: +5 per partner, Max of 15  
Location Wins/Looses Battle: +10/-10  
Imprison  Char/Imprisoned: +10 /-10  
Get Married: +10  
Recieve/Loose Title: +10/-10  
Win physical fight-skirmish or combat vs draftable/Loose Fight: +5/-5  
Escape imprisonment: +5  
Torture Named+ Char/my char Tortured : +5/-5  
Injure Another Draftable/Injured: +5 /-5  
Sourcery +5  
Kill Named: +5  
Order Execution: +5   
Plot succeed or Thwart Plot/Plot failed (obvious): +5/-5   
Gain Weapon,Pet,Army: +5  
Save Life of Draftable Char: +5  
Location Appears in episode: +1  
""Burn Village"" or reference to that (Mt rule): +1  
Minor Kill: +1 per seen on screen.  
Life Saved by draftable: -1  
Death: -10  
  
**Total Roster Slots Each Person has: 2 person game** (narrow it down if more people are in game).  
QB  
RB  
RB  
WR  
WR  
TE  
K  
Flex  
X (Location)  
  
***Our Season 1 Draftable Chars***  
QBs: Eddard Stark, Robert Baratheon, Khal Drogo, Tywin Lannister  
RBs: Jaime Lannister, Jon Snow,  Joffrey Baratheon, Gregor Clegane, Robb Stark, The Hound (?), Jorah Mormont(?)  
WRs: Daenerys Targaryen, Tyrion Lannister, Cersei Lannister, Littlefinger, Varus  
TEs: Arya Stark,  The Hound, Jorah Mormont, Theon Greyjoy, Bronn  
Ks: Anyone else you want.  
Locations: Kings Landing, Winterfell, Castle Black/Wall...  
  
**Season 2 Example***  
 Daenerys Targaryen, Rob Stark move to QB 

End result is as of now, my husband won season 1, myself season 2, and we almost tied season 3... but he won (darn it dany!). Below is our tentative teams for Season 4, we allowed each other to drop who we wanted and I gave him some hints:  
My Team-QB: Stannis, RB: Joffrey (I might get early replacement!), RB: Jon Snow, WR: Tyrion, WR Cersei, TE Asha ""Yara"", K. Lady Stoneheart, Flex: Brienne. The Wall/Castle black  
His Team- QB: Dany, RB Ramsey, RB Melisandre, WR Littlefinger, WR Dario N., TE Viper, Flex: Mountain. X: kings Landing.

Twas a blast, watch it again and try it! If you have any questions I'll be happy to answer.

I'm having some trouble suspending my disbelief in regards to Brienne's character. She seems to be too trusting of her companions, to the point where I have to constantly question why she would let Podrick Payne join her menagerie. 

She's aware that Pod is from King's Landing, and as far as she knows, he could be a spy sent by the Queen or even Jaime himself to secure Sansa's whereabouts. Of course, the reader is aware that this may not be the case, but Brienne has no reason not to doubt this. 

I would have let this one nitpick slide, but at the end of Brienne IV, Hyles flat-out reveals to her that Randyll Tarley sent him to keep track of her search for Sansa, and she immediately tells him that ""the Stark girl"" was making for Riverrun. Doesn't she know that Tarley is in allegiance with the Iron Throne, and that helping Hyles and bringing Sansa back to Tarley could mean Sansa's prosecution and eventual death?

To top this all of, the chapter includes a brief inner monologue in which Brienne establishes that she has grown to be wary of others and not to trust them. It seems to me that she contradicts this philosophy at every turn.

What I have noticed reading is that Ned had three chances of avoiding his death and war. 

First when he reveals to Cersei what he discovered: He could have had her locked up and told everyone the truth.

Second chance: When Robert is dying Renly wants him to strike against the Lannisters and gives him his support. Ned refuses.

Third chance: Littlefinger outlines a plan for Ned to marry his daughters to Lannisters and eventually making Renly King and therefore avoiding war. Ned refuses.

And Ned refuses because there is no honor in these options or because he wants vengeance? Joffrey is still an asshole for killing him but now I think he had it coming. He didn't adapt to the games and intrigues of King's Landing.



Night's Watch


What happens to the night's watch when the wall becomes irrelevant because the white walkers and/or wildlings have passed it or taken it? Can the members rejoin their families and forget their vows? I have watched all seasons but haven't read all books so I don't know if this is a possibility but I feel like this could happen considering how weak the night's watch is.

There is a scene where Lord Mormont gives a speech before Jon takes the black. Something along the lines of you came as rapers, murderers and by taking the black these crimes are forgiven. I thought that was really interesting because I remember an interview with GRRM where he said that he doesn't like black and white characters. His characters have both sides. And isn't the Night's Watch like a giant converter taking criminals and turning them into respected, important members of the realm? Of course it could also be viewed as punishment.",8,6,False,self,,,,,

First, Ned is honorable.
Ned never wants to speak of it..either because he is honorable or it is a story.
Being honorable, I really feel he would not have had stepped out on Catelyn.
Now, in the book he constantly remembers his sister saying, ""Promise me.""  Robert brings up about how Rheagar probably raped her hundreds of times.
Jon was born right around the time this all would have occurred.


I might just be sniffing a conspiracy here, but it seems to me like there is a good probability that Jon Snow is not Ned's, but his sister's.

I found this interesting since I thought from the start that Khal Drogo and the Dothraki were very much products of GRRM's inspiration from the mongols.

I decided to pick up the books. Now I'm halfway through AGOT but after reading the comments of a GoT-youtubevideo I was spoiled about the popular theory of [Jon Snow's mother](#g ""R + L (married?) = J""). (It's not yet confirmed, right?)   --&gt; BEWARE of spoilers on YouTube!!!

**[For everyone that don't have a clue about the mother of Jon Snow (now mather how many books you've read) : STOP READING HERE]**

I have to say that I totally didn't have a clue about this theory while reading. I didn't question [AGOT](#b ""what Ned had to promise Lyanna back then"") so I had no idea that it was something important. I feel bad that I already know of this theory while I really wanted to find this out myself. I feel like I ruined part of the fun by reading this. I really like plot twists and surprises and I hope this isn't the most important one. I feel like this is really important information because [Theory](#g ""If Dany dies, Jon will be the rightful heir to the throne (if L+R married, which I think is plausible). Last books was supposed to be named ""A time for Wolves"" = ""A time for Jon Snow to take the Throne?"" "") PLZ tell me I'm overreacting and that it's not that simple. I know it can't be that simple but still...

My question is if this ""knowledge"" or ""this part of not finding this by myself"" will ruin a lot of fun of the books?
After or during which book did yo get the knowledge of this theory? When are you supposed to know?

The thing I've learned from reading this theory on youtube is that I need to read more alert and that I have to question more things like for example actions of certain characters...

Now I am halfway into the first book but I am seriously thinking about start reading from where the TV - series left off because I'm dying to know whats going to happen next... But then I suppose when I'm finished with all the books I'm going to return to the first ones and read them so I don't miss out on anything.

So my question is: Do you think its a good idea to skip the first books to where the tv - series left off? I think it will be much more interesting for me at the moment because then I will not know whats going to happen and it will motivate me to read more. In the first books I kinda already know whats going to happen so its not as interesting as it could have been, but there is much, much more detail that I'm afraid I'm going to miss if I skip the first ones.

So what do you think?

Stannis Baratheon's fleet assaults King's Landing in the Battle of Blackwater Bay. Leading the defense, Tyrion Lannister destroys many of the attacking craft with an exploding ship full of wildfire, and is forced to lead a counterattack as King Joffrey and his bodyguard Sandor Clegane each desert the battlefield. Stannis' forces make it inside the castle, but Tyrion leads his men behind the Baratheon forces via underground tunnels and attacks. Meanwhile, Queen Regent Cersei, holed up in the fortress with Sansa Stark and the other ladies of the court, succumbs to wine and despondency as she believes the battle lost. In the nick of time, as she is about to poison her son Tommen, Tywin Lannister's forces, joined by Loras Tyrell, the lover of Renly Baratheon, arrive to dispatch the attackers.|

Am I wrong in thinking that we have a whole heap of trouble in Westeros because of some overly attached girlfriend? She admits to murdering Jon Arryn so she can be with Baelish. But, at the beginning of Game of Thrones she blames his murder on the Lannisters. Jon Arryn's death is what causes Ned Stark to go to King's Landing. It also causes Ned to start digging around in Jon Arryn's unanswered questions. And, we all know what happens after that. Ugh!

Kind of a big ask here - the copy of a feast for crows that I'm reading is missing a leaf, containing pages 185 and 186. It's the 2006 paperback edition 1. The missing pages are from a Sansa chapter, and the last line I can read is **He listened solemnly as Royce introduced the knights who had accompanied him, then said, ""My lords are welcome here. You know.....**, then i'm missing everything until **not look at it, she told herself, else i'll start to shake as badly as Robert.**

I'm hoping there's some lovely person out there with some time to kill that wouldn't mind typing out those two pages for me!

I would be eternally grateful!

*""Use the darkness, Bran, it is your shield""* or something along the sort. 

This sounds quite strange. I firmly believe there are only two God's in Westeros and Essos, and both of them come from the religion of the fire-god, R'hllor, or, as some call him, Azor Azhai, of Asshai(?Teehee?).

Could it be that the Greenseer serves the Unnamed One, The Lord of Darkness? Could he be the reincarnation of the unnamed one himself? If so, could the white walkers be his skinchangers, and the skinchangers of what seemed to be OTHER greenseers when Hodor walked into that room in the dungeons? If so, I would like to see what TWOW holds for us.

I didn't read on, but if there is any information useful that would give me a better grasp of the situation, I would like it.

And yes, I know the Greenseers and TCoTF fought the white walkers with the first Andals, but things change. And, dare I suggest, that GRRM forgot that part of Westerosi history?

There have been many times in the series where it becomes really suspenseful, where you feel like perhaps a character is about to die, but then you remember that someone somewhere who is ahead of you in the series posted something in their title that told you the character was still alive, and it just kills the suspense.

This one was a doozy.  Even knowing what was going to happen, my GOD.  There are certain things you can imagine while you are reading, but not be as affected by it because its only words.  Having them acted out in front of you with all the emotion and pain visible in their eyes.  It was as if I was punched in the gut.  I think they handled Cat's reaction very well: the bewildered, absent way she just stood there after Robb was killed and she killed the Frey girl. It really hit home the torment losing a child would cause you.  Not such a huge fan of Talisa being there, but whatever. Also love the banter between the Hound and Arya.

It seems that Targaryens ruled Westeros for several generations. Given that much time they must have reproduced their dragons and must have tamed them for each of their children (much like all the Starklings had Dire Wolves). 

How come Rhaegar didn't have a dragon of his own?

""I understand that there are to be 7 books in this series, but as of this writing there are only 5. I listened to them all, one right after the other, so it is difficult for me to review them separately. Besides, I think anyone new to the series should know what they're getting into right up front. However, there are no spoilers here.
I'm going to use the word ""read"" instead of ""listen"" because it's all the same to me and ""read"" is shorter.
My sons, both of them ""men grown,"" have been nagging me for at least two years to read these books. Recently, they both accosted me about it from different parts of the country on my birthday, so I grudgingly agreed to try the first book. I have now read them all, as I said. My sons have been disinherited several times during the reading process. They had better hope that the last two books come out before I die.
I have read a number of reviews comparing Martin to Tolkien. This might be true if Tolkien had been a warped, sadistic bastard who enjoyed tormenting his readers. During the course of reading these books, I have called Martin everything but a good guy. Lucifer, Beelzebub, and Spawn of Satan top the list, along with accompanying adjectives. But I read all the books and am biting my nails waiting for the next one. True to his nature, however, Martin is making no promises about when that will be. Judging from the spacing of these first 5 books, I may have no fingers left by the time book 6 hits the presses. (This would help me relate better to some of his characters, I guess.)
So, for those of you who have not yet begun this series: If you are very squeamish, you'd better not start. There is a lot of torture, violence, explicit sex, and explicit violent sex. Even worse, there's some really bad language.
It is set in a world that seems to be based on Medieval England, but is not England nor any other place on this earth. The number of characters and story lines that are converging on each other seems daunting at first glance, but I was surprised at how easily I could keep the major ones straight in my head.
There are some characters that you will love and others that you will love to hate, and still others that you will hate to love. Some of them you will hate and then come to love or pity, and the other way around, too. Some of them, mostly Tyrion Lannister, are very witty and humorous no matter what the situation, so that provides a little relief sometimes. Some of them you will forget about entirely, as a whole book might go by before they pop up again.
If you like to feel safe and secure when reading a book, this series is not for you. Nothing is sacred, no one is safe. Bad things happen to good people, and vice versa. If I had been reading a paper book, I would have a lot of holes in my walls from repeatedly throwing the books against them. However, reading them has given me plenty of practice climbing the walls. (Unfortunately, as a woman, I would still not be able to become a Black Brother.) No one is happy in any of the seven kingdoms. The only joy comes from vengeance or, more rarely, justice. I hate books like that! But I read all the books and am biting my nails waiting for the next one.
I have given the series 5 stars because I could not stop reading once I had started, no matter how angry it made me. I would never have read these books if my sons had not hounded me into it. But wait--no--I have no sons. That was that other woman who lived before she embarked on the torturous journey that is Game of Thrones.""",2,12,False,self,,,,,

I finally got around to reading (well listening, did the audiobook) GRRM's most recent novella ""The Princess and the Queen"" this past week and I enjoyed it immensely.  It added quite a bit of early history into the world we all know and love... After reading quite a bit of positive feedback and reactions on the novella in /r/asoiaf, I noticed that this sub has been almost silent on this most recent release set in the World of Ice and Fire...

So, what does r/gameofthrones reactions to this novella, please let me know in the comments..


-----------------------------------------------

For my reaction I am going to list my top 5 takeaways of what I liked about this novella, in no particular order.

**-  Targaryens everywhere**

I thought Dunk and Egg did a great job of showing House Targaryen at one of their heights of power, and showing us many of the notable people of House Targaryen during that time period, but P&amp;amp;Q outdoes even that by showing us the house when they were arguably their most numerous. From the several children of Rhaenerya Targaryen, by her two husbands, to the previously unknown children of Aegon II.  Not  to mention the added details of previous generations of Targaryens....The Targaryens are everywhere..  The events of the novella however are successful at thinning out their numbers. (Poor Joffrey Velaryon, tried to ride his mother's dragon)

**- Dragons Everywhere, Dragons Nowhere**

The best takeaway from the Novel is the sheer amount of Dragons present.... And holy shit was it awesome.  The descriptions and histories of each of the dragons that the Targaryens possessed (and didn't posses as there were a couple of wild dragons mentioned) are excellent.  And it is a bit tragic in the way GRRM describes them having to fight eachother into extinction during the violent civil war... The whole scene with the Rioters of Kings landing destroying the dragon pit and killing 4 of them in one night (and why you seen the dragon pit caved in with depictions of Kings Landing) is an amazing passage..  

**- Dragon riders and dragonseed**

I liked the information on how the Targaryen family is bonded to their individual dragons, and who rode what dragon. (described very similar to the Stark/Direwolf bond).  However that given adequate familiarity, dragons could be ridden by other riders as well, even non-Targaryens.  For example the Targaryen bastards, aka ""Dragonseed"". I liked seeing that while still tainted with the misconceptions of being a bastard in Westeros, that they were still held in higher regard than other noble bastards, to the point where there were more dragons and not enough riders that they were looked to as potential (and successful) dragon riders...

**- Who's Who in Westeros version 3.0**

""The Tales of Dunk and Egg"" have been successful in detailing the nobility of Westeros (aside from House Targaryen) from the North to Dorne at a time in Westeros 90 years before the start of ASOIAF.  P&amp;amp;Q manages to do the same, this time 170 years before the start of ASOIAF.  Appearances and mentions of the then lords Stark/Baratheon/Hightower/Lannister and several smaller houses are all here.  It is a bit daunting having all these characters thrown at you at once, and getting them all straight (along with all the new Targaryens) but if you managed getting characters straight in the main series and D&amp;amp;E you'll do it here as well, and wind up with a fantastic piece of world and history building...  

**- Why this novella will never be adapted for screen**

This is not a negative point, but given the non-pov presentation of this novella that is the format for both ASOIAF and D&amp;amp;E, we are driven from set piece to set piece by this story.  It is very good, but it describes each of the large battles in the Dance of the Dragons in detail... and it is amazing, especially when Dragons are involved.... The (several mind you) dragon v. dragon battles that do occur are out of this world. All of which leads me to think that adapting P&amp;amp;Q would be well outside the budget of HBO... even a major film with a summer blockbuster budget would struggle to do P&amp;amp;Q justice..

 That's all I got for now, looking forward to reading other responses...  And if you have not yet read ""The Princess and the Queen"" what are you waiting for? ",7,12,False,self,,,,,

I've just completed my 3rd reread of the books and I don't think I could be more obsessed with this world if I tried. 

One problem I have with the show however is the armors of various characters.

I'm not talking about minor characters as much as main ones, why can't Jaime wear his lions head helm? There are hundreds if not thousands of people in the world qualified to create one for him, some of whom would do it for next to nothing because they are fans of the show.

There are even cases (such as a certain duel coming up in season 4) in which a characters limited vision has an effect on the entire scene in the books.

Is it budgetary? Do they think we're too daft to figure out who is who if we can't see their faces? 

I can't see it being either personally, as I've said there are people who would do it just to have their work in the show and on top of that their helmets are usually a rendition of their house sigil, which to me seems like it would make it easier to tell the difference between the different characters and who they fight for.

I don't know, maybe I'm just a little sad I'll never get to see some of these epic helmets and armors that I imagined as I read the books.. but at the very least they could have say.. the mountain have a yellow piece of cloth with 3 dogs on it... 

Does anyone else know why they've decided to cut these elements our? Maybe a interview or something

The aftermath of the Battle of the Blackwater sees Joffrey set Sansa aside in favor of marrying Margaery Tyrell while Tyrion fears for his and Shae's safety now that his father has replaced him as Hand of the King. Melisandre gives a defeated Stannis a new hope. Brienne runs into trouble while escorting Jaime to King's Landing. Catelyn tries to convince Robb that his romance with Talisa is dangerous, but he defies her and the two are married. In Qarth, Daenerys ventures into the House of the Undying and successfully retrieves her dragons. She then seals the traitor Xaro Xhoan Daxos inside his own vault and claims his riches for herself to buy a ship. In Winterfell, Theon is betrayed by his own men in the face of an inevitable siege while Winterfell is put to the torch. Osha and Hodor sneak brothers Bran and Rickon away from the smoldering ruins and take them North toward the Wall. Arya, having escaped Harrenhal with Hot Pie and Gendry, receives the gift of a valuable coin from Jaqen. North of the Wall, Qhorin Halfhand forces Jon to kill him to prove his loyalty to the Wildlings and an army of White Walkers surrounds the Fist of the First Men.|

Your hatred is understandable, given how he is introduced, and how he treats the girl who shall eventually become the Mother of Dragons. But if one merely takes a step back and looks at his past, perhaps that hatred may turn to sympathyperhaps even love.

Now, imagine yourself at five years old. You live in an opulent red castle in the capital of a great and powerful country. Your father is king, your mother the queen. Your elder brother is beloved by all, so it is easy to admire and idolize him, much like your father. And if that isnt good enough, you actually have the ancient blood of the dragon in you. You are the latest scion in a long line of great men and women who rode and commanded dragons, the fiercest creatures that ever lived in your world.

Life is pretty great at this point, isnt it? Well, life is a vengeful force of nature and it doesnt take long for your situation to change. Because you are only five, you are blithely unaware that your father is very much insane and through his terrible actions a rebellion occurs. Your brother dies at the hands of a vile Usurper named Robert Baratheon, and suddenly you are whisked away to an island to be kept safe along with your mother. You stay there for quite awhile only to find out that your father has been murdered and that his advisor has ensured the demise of your family. To top it off, your mother dies in front of you while giving birth to your baby sister. And if things arent too dire now, you are whisked away to a foreign city in a foreign land where one of your servants watches over you.

Five years pass and things are pretty quiet. You watch your sister grow from an infant to a child and maybe life seems a little easier. Then the servant who took you in dies and his servants rob you blind and force you out onto the streets along with your sister. You now must take care of the child in addition to keeping yourself out of harms way from the assassins the vile Usurper has no doubt sent after you. Eventually it becomes so hard that you must sell your only prized possession: your mothers crown. The one symbol that still reminds you of your family and heritage. The one thing that kept that light in you burning, no matter how dim it became.

So now it has gone out and there is only the bitter reminder that some fat drunk sits upon your fathers throne and the daughter of the man who ensured your exile is his queen. It is all too much. And your sister is always too afraid to do anything by herself.

So along comes that golden opportunity to finally take it all back and restore your House to its former glory. And the price comes easily enough-merely marry your sister to a savage who can supply you with a powerful army. The wedding comes, and now the throne is finally within your reachonly now you must travel to the savages city, which is thousands of miles away to hear whether or not your sister is worthy enough to wed the man. A small inconvenience-no more, no less. Being called the Beggar King nearly all of your life has clearly run its course by now. You get there and things turn sour quickly. Not only are the savages mocking and ignoring you, but your sister has grown to become a powerful young woman with people who love her. Its all you can do not to go berserk. So you get hammered instead, ignore a sacred law, and find yourself getting a bucket of molten gold upended upon your head, which your sisters savage husband has decided will be your crown.

Viserys life was not a black-and-white account. He had to endure a lot in such a short amount of time that it is truly a wonder he did not become the spitting image of his father. And you may protest his treatment of Daenerys, but there is something to be said for him caring for her all those years when he could have simply abandoned her. And neither did he practice the Valyrian custom of incest with her. He loved her, though he could not show it in the conventional ways of familial love. If anything, his cruelty shaped Dany to be who she was.
I hope this has been somewhat insightful. Though I hold no great love for Viserys III Targaryen, he is one of those really great creations of Georges. Though arent they all?

All spoiler warnings in /r/gameofthrones cover information published or aired in the show.  Anything not published or aired yet is speculation.  The show and books are not the same, so it's possible the same piece of information is both a book spoiler and show speculation at the same time. 

Pre-release information like the early TWOW chapters and Season 4 teasers/trailers are covered under ""published or aired,"" but adding to the pre-release information is speculation.  That means [Season 4] covers just the trailer by itself.   **Additional information that explains clips from a trailer are *not* covered under [Season 4].**  Those are book spoilers or (show speculation if you're not a reader).  It's no different than a post about a TWOW chapter where you have a theory about what else happens in the book based on the one chapter.  If you're adding to what's there, then it needs additional warning.

And please keep in mind, /r/gameofthrones is very actively moderated for spoilers like that.  [Joking or hinting around with spoilers is not ok](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/wiki/posting_policy) unless you have warning tags for them.  The subreddit's going to get more and more new fans as we approach Season 4, so please try to post safely so that no one is spoiled by accident.

The subreddit is experiencing more and more traffic every day that we draw closer to April 6 and that traffic will only continue to increase though the season.  There are a lot of formerly absent members rejoining us and also a lot of new members joining us for the first time, and as a result the moderating team has noticed a marked increase in the number of posting policy violations, especailly regarding the spoiler guide.  So I'd like to take this opportunity to go over the difference between a [Season 4] spoiler and an [ASOS] spoiler, so that we can go ahead and clear up one of the most common mistakes we've been seeing.

A television spoiler (e.g. [Season 4]) can *only* cover material that has been officially aired on television or as a promotion for the television show.  This includes teasers, trailers, set photography, posters, etc.  Television spoilers *do not* cover anything that has not yet been aired, even if you are 100% positive that it will be aired in the future.  **If the event has not yet occured on the tv show, then it is not a tv spoiler.  If you are sure something is going to happen on the tv show because you read it in a book then it is a book spoiler.**  There is no such thing as a ""future"" tv spoiler.

Just to state it plainly for the skimmers:

* [Season 4]: Officially aired Season 4 episodes, teasers, trailers, promotions, etc.  **Anything that has already been seen on TV, or released specifically for the TV show and nothing more!**
* [ASOS]: Anything that occurs in the book A Storm of Swords or earlier, but has not yet been seen on TV, even if you are positive that it will also occur in a future Season 4 episode.

If you have any questions regarding this matter, or any matter at all really, please feel free to ask them in the comments and I or another moderator will happily answer.  Thanks!

They had Jeyne Poole as a super minor character for maybe all of about 2 minutes in Season 1. No reference was made to her, unlike Beric Dondarrion..but that may be because ADWD came out after they filmed Season 1? I feel like GRRM would have let them know though, as that's a fairly crucial plot point.

So are they going to cut out that plot altogether? I feel like it's fairly necessary, as Ramsay's mistreatment of her is, among several, a key rallying factor for the North. Or maybe just make her a random/new character? Another possibility I was considering was them pawning off Myranda (Ramsay's groupie who helped torture Theon) as Arya.

Truly one of the best, if not the best show I have ever watched. I watched all episodes in a matter of 4 days, read quite some things in the wiki and now I decided to rewatch the show with the newly aquired deeper understanding I have now. However, what I really don't understand is the time right before the events started. Please don't spoiler me, but if it's possible to answer this without any spoilers please correct me:

Daenerys and her brother are the son/daughter of the mad king. Robert was fighting against said mad king until Jaime backstabbed him. Jaime was, at the time, the king's guard. Tywin Lannister was the hand of the mad king.

If that's all correct, who was Jon Arryn and why did he have to die?

Also: are there any more informations in the boook about that time that didn't find their place in the show?

Thanks in advance and props to the mods for keeping everything spoilerfree, it's one of the best modded subreddits i have ever seen!

Traditionally, the heir apparent was named Lord of Dragonstone (granted this was during the Targaryen dynasty but like alot of transitional ruling families, they probably sought symbolic continuity to legitimize their claim to power). It looks to me like, since Robert became king, and Stannis is technically his heir until Joffrey comes of age, that is his appropriate title for the time being; and Renly, as the next in line to inherit Storm's End, is rightly named as Lord of Storm's End.

So is it that being Lord of Storm's End is more profitable? more prestigious? I can see that if Robert meant these lands and titles to be permanent, it is a little messed up to name the youngest brother to inherit the family domain when the middle brother is alive and well, since Robert's children will inherit the 7 kingdoms, and Renly's children (ha) is set to inherit the Stormlands; and Stannis' children will inherit Dragonstone....",39,4,False,self,,,,,

As all book readers are well aware, all the Stark kids are powerful wargs in some way or another (even Sansa, I like to think, even though she didn't have much time to learn it, unfortunately). 

My question is, to what extent are they wargs on the show? In the show, only Bran has had the dreams where he experiences his wolf's (Summer's) consciousness. However, by the point in the books where season 4 will start, Jon has had some dream(s) where he is inside Ghost. Later on, he even feels Ghost's experiences and state when awake. 

And what about Arya? not only does she have Nymeria dreams, but when she gets to Braavos, she can warg inside of a cat.

Are they cutting or reducing the other Stark children's abilities in the show? From what I can tell, they are pretty amazing, awesome, and integral parts of the story. Will we get to see it in the show soon?

The thing is, and maybe this is lazy, I don't really want to read over everything i've just watched over the past month.

Jayne Poole?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1vbl8q/all_spoilers_a_few_questions_about_the_trailer/,FoxForceFive14,1389833128,"1. Why is Theon looking so much like Theon? I know later wheen Ramsey marries Jayne Poole (Arya) That he gets the become himself again (or as much of himself he can be) but really? To speed up that plot line to that point would ruin Asha Greyjoys, they would also have to speed up Stanis's, I really hope that's not the case...

2. Who is the woman with Ramsey, I saw someone suggest it was Jeyne Poole, but again, if they advance the plot that fast it would harm other characters plotlines. and in my opinion there is no way Jeyne would ever act like that. 

3. THE DRAGON OVER KINGS LANDING?!!! Lets hope its just Tommon playing with a toy set? 

4. Who is it riding toward Dany on the horse? I thought it may be the Titans Bastard, but he's running toward some dark haired male, not Arstan (Barraston Selmy). Do you reckon they changed that, or who are these two men?

5. Jorah? He is banished before they enter Meereen. But there is several shots of him inside the walls, and many shots of him throughout the trailer... Is he not going to be banished? Or are they just delaying it? If the former it will surely ruin Tyrions plot later on...


Other than these questions I loved the trailer and think everything looks amazing!!! ",5,0,False,self,,,,,

And it would make sense him always saying he served the realm, and the realm was the children of the forest before the first men. Also, its said that Varys uses children as informants and one of the children of the forests could pose as a child. It would also be easy for them to use secret passage ways in kings landing and the red keep some are so small its hard for someone not of tyrions stature to get through.

I didn't really see them at first, but once I noticed one thing, I started seeing a lot more of the same plot through both books. Has anyone else noticed this stuff yet or is it just me? I tried searching around the Internet but I didn't find a whole lot so I'm asking around here because I just can't believe how much in common there is.

The first thing that tipped me off was Marius. Jon Snow, more or less, is an *exact copy* of Marius. They are both bastards, Snow being one literally, and Marius being one figuratively as he abandons his plush lifestyle and his father disowns him. Both of these characters go out and fight the big fight, and both have a kind of star-crossed romance, which brings me to my next point. It's an allegory.

Cosette is Marius' love interest, but they have to keep it a secret through most of the story. Tyrion Lannister or more or less an allegory for Cosette. Both Cosette and Tyrion are bastards. Cosette has a secret love with Marius, while Tyrion has a secret (although it's not explicitly stated in the book, I believe it to be implied and I think Martin may have mentioned it in an interview previously) love affair with Jon Snow. Is anyone else seeing this? Marius and Cosette? Jon and Tyrion? And this is only scratching the surface because there is more.

Everyone knows that Martin has a fetish for killing off his characters, but where did this fetish come from? The general consensus seems to be it's from Martin's own creativity and skill at putting together a grim novel filled with deceit and murder, but I've deduced that Martin is most likely a very avid supporter of Les Miserables. This makes sense, because who isn't? When we look at Les Mis from an allegorical perspective, *a lot of people die.* Even some main characters die, like [Les Mis](#b ""Inspector Javert."") A lot of people die in both Les Mis and Game of Thrones. That's just a fact.

The central plot to GOT is the constant fight for the throne. That's just how it the entire book series play out. Sure, there's a dragon here and there and maybe some guy named Khal, but I haven't read past the first hundred pages of the first book so I can't say for certain whether those are actually in there. However, I can say for certainty that in Les Mis, there is also a fight for the throne. The French people want to depose the French king and install a new power to the throne. While this isn't the central plot of the book, you have to think of it as an allegory. GOT is using that subplot as a main plot, while taking Les Mis' main plot (the budding romance of Cosette and Marius) and making it GOT's subplot (the budding romance of Tyrion and Jon). Everything is there, you just have to look for it.

Then there are the baby dire wolves the Starks find and raise early on in the first book (I have read that part). While you may suspect this to just be an allegory to Les Mis, it is, in fact, a literal translation from Les Mis to GOT. In the unabridged version of Les Mis, [Les Mis](#b ""Valjean stumbles across three baby dire wolves after rescuing Cosette from Sacha Baron Cohen. Valjean gives one dire wolf to Cosette, gives one to Eponine, and later on, he gives one to Marius (which further backs up the fact that Marius is Jon Snow)."") This is a very important detail when comparing the two works.

This is everything that I have found so far, but I wanted others' opinions on it. I'm still going to go back through and reread Les Mis and the first part of GOT to see if I can spot more similarities, which I am sure there are many, but I wanted to take a break from my research to post this and see if anyone else came up with something I didn't see. It's pretty interesting to find that Martin is a total hack, but sometimes even a hero will live long enough to be a villain.

Perhaps there are more elements of GOT stolen from other books? I'm not sure yet but it's worth looking into.

Anyway, thoughts on the subject? More findings? I'm interested in hearing your feedback.

According to the prophecy by Maggie the Frog, Cersei would outlive her children, her infidelity (and Robert's infidelity) were noted, everything Cersei has will be taken by a younger queen, and she will die at the hand of her ""little brother."" 

Cersei is convinced that Tyrion will be the one to kill her, but technically, Jaime is also her ""little brother"" since Cersei came out of the womb first. It seems that Jaime is in no rush to save her from her current situation, so I am curious to see what is to come for her future in the next book. I also think her fear of Margaery as the ""younger queen"" that will take all she has, but what if she's wrong about that and it's Danaerys that is to take the throne or maybe Sansa since Littlefinger is working his magic to get Sansa back to Winterfell?

This has probably been put forward before and I'm probably late on it, but I think that Jon is truly a bastard Stark. Lyanna Stark. To begin, he's born the year she dies. Ned returns to Winterfell with the child after Robert's conquests, presumably having been given the child from his lover. There's speculation on who the mother is and all the theories that go along with Ned, but couldn't it be possible that he simply got the child from a dying Lyanna when the seven slew the three? This would allow for an explanation for why Edric Dayne claims that Jon and he were milk-brothers, because Ned needed someone to nurse Jon after his mother died. I'm not sure of details on when this all would have happened.

Second, in the description of Lyanna's death, it says that Ned finds her on a ""bed of blood"", which could indicate childbirth. It would also offer an explanation for this mysterious promise that Lyanna got from Ned, namely, to protect the identity of the child and to raise him as Ned's own. That in turn might explain why the three Kingsguard were set to protect the Tower of Joy: to protect Rhaegar's son.

Finally, it would give an explanation for why Jon bears such a striking Stark resemblance. While others have noted that Jon must not have taken after his mom at all (assuming that Ned would be the father), it could be instead that he took after his mom and not at all from his father.

This has probably been put forward before and I'm probably late on it, but I think that Jon is truly a bastard Stark. Lyanna Stark. To begin, he's born the year she dies. Ned returns to Winterfell with the child after Robert's conquests, presumably having been given the child from his lover. There's speculation on who the mother is and all the theories that go along with Ned, but couldn't it be possible that he simply got the child from a dying Lyanna when the seven slew the three? This would allow for an explanation for why Edric Dayne claims that Jon and he were milk-brothers, because Ned needed someone to nurse Jon after his mother died. I'm not sure of details on when this all would have happened.

Second, in the description of Lyanna's death, it says that Ned finds her on a ""bed of blood"", which could indicate childbirth. It would also offer an explanation for this mysterious promise that Lyanna got from Ned, namely, to protect the identity of the child and to raise him as Ned's own. That in turn might explain why the three Kingsguard were set to protect the Tower of Joy: to protect Rhaegar's son.

Finally, it would give an explanation for why Jon bears such a striking Stark resemblance. While others have noted that Jon must not have taken after his mom at all (assuming that Ned would be the father), it could be instead that he took after his mom and not at all from his father. He is said to most closely resemble Arya of the Stark family, whom is said to closely resemble Lyanna when she was young.

I came across a few related questions during an interview for another show he is part of that some Stannis fans may find interesting (or disappointing). 

Link: http://www.denofgeek.com/tv/stephen-dillane/28822/stephen-dillane-on-the-tunnel-and-game-of-thrones

The relevant GoT parts from the interview:

**Well there's always Game of Thrones to keep you busy in the meantime..***
*It's not actually that much of a commitment, Game of Thrones. It's only half the year and not that many filming days, so I'm not hugely involved in it at the moment. Who knows what it'll be like next season...*

**Will we see a great deal more of Stannis in Season 4?**
*More? No.*

**Is Game of Thrones a very different show for you to work on given its scale and budget and the sheer heat of fan attention that it receives?**
*I don't think the heat of fan attention makes that much difference to the actual process of making it, but certainly the first two things you mentioned are significant. It's a much much bigger industry. The experience of going in and out of something as vast as that is not the same as turning up every day on set with a bunch of people that you know. So it's pretty different and the attention is different. There's a lot of time spent setting up shots, and in a way the acting's neither here nor there, so it's a very different acting experience.*

**Did you read the books to prepare for the role, or did you not have a spare year handy?**
*(Laughs) I didn't read the books, no. I decided I'd wing it (laughs).*

**Did you have to audition or were you just kidnapped in the dead of night and spirited away to be on the show like all of Britain's actors seem to have been?**
*(Laughs) Pressganged! No, I went and read for it.*

**You've done your fair share of Shakespeare in the past. Do the machinations on Game of Thrones appeal to the Shakespearean actor in you?**
*I wouldn't say that that is its appeal, no. I know what you mean about Shakespeare in the sense that it clearly draws on Shakespeare's history plays for its inspiration in some ways, and the Greeks, and pretty much every other kind of epic history thats ever been written. But in terms of playing the role, no, I wouldn't say that's the attraction. I find its fascination is certainly in that kind of extraordinary exchange of power that goes on, and the fact that it's really the only game in town. I think that people recognise that to be the way of the world at the moment.*

**Have you ever checked out the fan reaction to your character online? A lot of them call you 'Stannis the Mannis'...**
*(Laughs) No, I haven't...*

**Oh don't worry, Stannis has a lot of fans.**
*That's a relief actually, I must say because I do know how much people are invested in it. Especially people who've read the books. And you do feel a sense of obligation to those people to live up to their hopes. So even if I'm doing it by accident I'm very glad!*

But to me, Catelyn's death was worse because she was just an accomplice. Yes, an accomplice. Robb had it coming. Before people jump down my throat, let me explain.

I know The King of the North (Robb Stark) was the fan favorite of all the king's in Westeros. But was he actually a good king? I'm going to start with showing the differences in the book and the show. In the book he meets Jeyne Westerling who nurses him back after an injury in battle. He falls in love with her (and takes her virginity after she comforts him) and marries her almost immediately as he feels it's the honorable thing to do.. Meanwhile in the show, he meets Talisa, a kind hearted girl from Essos who also looks to aid those hurt from battle. After a decent amount of interaction, he marries her in the show. So different girl, same result.

But in the book, he has the sense to leave Jeyne in Riverrun to protect her and their unborn child. In the show, he's brazen enough to take Talisa with him to The Twins. So now he's gone beyond stupid in the show while at least only cautiously stupid in the book. Yes, still stupid. I don't care if he's fallen head over heels with these girls, he made a promise to Walder Frey to marry one of his girls after the war. If you're going to be king, you have to show as much loyalty to your people as they show to you. He betrayed his own ally by slighting him like that, showing no respect to the promise made as a guest. And in the show, he takes his new wife, a symbol of the broken promise, to The Twins. If I'm Lord Walder Frey, I'd feel a little more than slighted myself.

Then there's the fact that he just got cocky. He bragged about winning three battles against secondary forces of the Lannister's, not their main force that was closer to King's Landing. I understand he is still only 16 (in the book at least) but he needs to show the leadership if he's going to be king. Instead, he let his guard slip. He ended up trusting Roose Bolton too much, something his father would have never done knowing the history of the Bolton's. Finally, he entrusted Theon too much. I know Theon was loyal to the Stark's with his history in Winterfell but he should have known better than to try to convince Balon Greyjoy, a man that hates the Stark family, by only sending his son. Why not send a few men there to make sure Theon can be trusted and reliable?

Honestly, the only things I can think Robb did that were smart were killing the Karstark for betraying them and murdering those children and his tactics on the battlefield. Of course he was allowed to be more aggressive because he had a fucking direwolf helping him out.

TL;DR: Robb wasn't innocent, acted like a brat, sorta got what he had coming; he didn't show the skills or thoughtfulness a true king should have.",50,15,False,self,,,,,

Hello all and welcome to the start of a possible series of posts entitled ""Step Into Their Shoes"". Now this series will only continue if you like this post enough and want to see more. 

The goal of this series is to go into the minds' of the characters of Game of Thrones and try to reach down and find out what makes them tick. I specifically have non-PoV characters in mind. To those who do not know, a POV character is a character from the books from which we read a chapter through their eyes. 

The person of interest I will start with is one of the, if not the most, controversial character in the series.

STANNIS BARATHEON.

You either love him or hate him, but do you *KNOW* him?

I bet you may ask questions like, ""Why do people even like Stannis?"" or ""I just don't get the love for Stannis!"" or maybe even, ""Stannis is a dick, why do people like him?"" While I can't answer those questions for every single person who likes Stannis, I can explain to you why they WOULD possibly like Stannis.

Maybe you also have a question like, ""If Dany is still alive, then Stannis isn't the rightful heir, right?"" Or ""Why would Stannis kill his own brother."" or ""Why is Stannis used by Melisandre?"" These sorts of questions are easier for me to answer. 

So, in order to explain the decisions Stannis has made now, we must go back into the past. DISCLAIMER: There will be spoilers up until ASOS but nothing plot major or past the TV series. Everything from the books that I will list will not spoil you of anything.

**Stannis's Early Life**
_________________________________________________________
Stannis Baratheon is the second son to Lord Steffon Baratheon and Lady Cassana Estermont. He is the younger brother of Robert Baratheon and older brother to Renly Baratheon. In the Prologue to A Clash of Kings (the second book) we learn from Maester Cressen that Stannis was never a playful or wild child. King Aerys II (the future Mad King, he wasn't always mad) ordered Lord Steffon and Lady Cassana to travel to Essos and the Free Cities to find a wife for Prince Rhaegar Targaryen of Dragonstone. 

Lord Steffon could not find the Crown Prince a bride, however, he found a fool (Patchface)

&gt; ""We have found the most splendid fool, only a boy, yet nimble as a monkey and witty as a dozen courtiers. He juggles and riddles and does magic, and he can sing prettily in four tongues. We have brought his freedom and hope to bring him home with us. Robert will be delighted with him, and perhaps in time he will even teach Stannis how to laugh.""

However, those hopes were cut short.

&gt; The lord's two-masted galley Windproud broke up within sight of his castle. From its parapets his two eldest sons had watched as their father's ship was smashed against the rocks and swallowed by the waters. A hundred oarsmen and sailors went down with Lord Steffon Baratheon and his lady wife, and for days thereafter every tide left a fresh crop of swollen corpses on the strand below Storm's End.

Stannis was thirteen at the time his parents died. Now, Robert Baratheon was left as the patriarch and lord of Storm's End. This is exactly where Stannis begins to experience Middle Child Syndrome.

&gt; Middle children often feel left out and invisible, a contrast from their older and younger siblings. While older children get the benefits of all of the firsts a child accomplishes, younger children benefit from the emotional impact of being the baby of the family, often being spoiled and coddled. Middle children, however, often feel as though they have nothing special that is just theirs.

[Source](http://www.everydayfamily.com/the-middle-child-syndrome/)

Stannis lost his faith in ANY gods that day his mother and father drowned.

&gt; ""I stopped believing in gods the day I saw the Windrpoud break up across the bay. Any gods so monstrous as to down my mother and father would never have my worship, I vowed. In King's Landing, the High Septon would prattle at me of how all justice and goodness flowed from the Seven, but all I ever saw of either was made by men.""

So Stannis is thirteen, his brother now runs the family, and Renly is coddled by love. 

&gt; ""When I was a lad I found an injured goshawk and nursed her back to health. Proudwing. I named her. She would perch on my shoulder and flutter from room to room after me and take food from my hand, but she would not soar. Time and again I would take her hawking, but she never flew higher than the treetops. Robert called her Weakwing. He owned a gyrfalcon named Thunderclap who never missed her strike. One day our great-uncle Ser Harbert told me to try a different bird. I was making a fool of myself with Proudwing, he said, and he was right.""

This quote is one of my favorite stories that Stannis tells us. It's a perfect example of the family dynamic between the Baratheon brothers and how Stannis WAS the middle child. 

However, I don't doubt that there was a time where the Baratheon brothers were united together in their grief, at least Robert and Stannis. There was that one thing that tied them all together, and it was a lack of parents. Renly was too young to remember, and was coddled by those who took the three under their wing. 

It all changed when Robert left for the Vale to be fostered by Lord Jon Arryn. There, Robert found a father figure in Jon Arryn and a new brother in Eddard Stark, second son of Rickard Stark. The two of them grew so close that Ned replaced Stannis as Robert's brother, to the envy and discomfort of Stannis.

This is where I believe the Baratheon brothers finally lose that unity. Stannis was replaced by Ned, and thus he felt inclined to look towards ideals like justice, honor, and duty to replace the lack of any attention or love in his life.

**Robert's Rebellion**

We all know the story of Robert's Rebellion. Prince Rhaegar took Lyanna Stark and fled to an unknown location. Brandon Stark demanded King Aerys II to bring Rhaegar to answer for his crimes, but instead arrested him and called Ned's father down to represent Brandon in court. There, Aerys had Rickard burnt in his own armor while Brandon strangled himself as he desperately reached for a sword intentionally left just out of reach for the poor man.

Aerys II demanded Jon Arryn hand over Robert and Eddard, but was refused. The Vale rose their banners and thus began the Rebellion. Robert went straight back to Storm's End to call his banners, but even some of his own lords opposed him. He set out to eventually win three victories before being defeated at Ashford, leaving Stannis in charge of Storm's End's defense. Now, at this point you may ask. If Stannis is all for the rightful king and duty and justice, why did he fight with his brother, especially since he was replaced by Ned? Stannis tells us that this was the hardest decision in his life, his brother or his king. In the end he ruled that there were deeper vows, the younger brother bows to the older, and hence why he followed Robert, because Robert was his older brother.

While it may have been wise to give Robert chase, Lord Mace Tyrell counted on Tywin Lannister to intercept the rebel lord, but Tywin did nothing in the end. The Tyrells took to siege Storm's End.

Now you may ask, why? Well, the belief was that if Storm's End fell, Robert's Rebellion would lose moral and the armies would break. The responsibility of holding the Rebellion together fell to Stannis. For a whole year Stannis refused to surrender to the Highgarden forces who banqueted in sight of the walls. After Aerys died and Robert was declared King, Lord Eddard marched to finally relieve Stannis, who had barely starved were it not for Davos the smuggler and his onions.

When Mace Tyrell bent the knee, Robert proceeded to give thanks to Lord Eddard and offered a feast in his honor, but Stannis was never thanked. Instead, Robert commanded that Stannis raise a fleet and head to take Dragonstone from the remaining Targaryen loyalists. Stannis did exactly that, but Ser Willem Darry had already fled with Dany and Viserys before Stannis arrived.

ROBERT WAS FURIOUS! There was no thanks for taking Dragonstone, instead there was punishment disguised as an honor given to Stannis. He was stripped of Storm's End, which was rightfully his since Robert was now King, and given Dragonstone. Some may argue that this was because Stannis was the intended heir and it was traditional, or that it was because those lands needed a strong ruler to control the populace. Would you like to know what I think? I think Robert made the decision out of rage, and then discussed it with Jon Arryn who came up with excuses to try and heal the damage done. 

Renly was given Storm's End unjustly. Renly did not partake in the war, nor contribute anything to the Stormlands nor Westeros. He was merely a boy, and yet he was given richer lands with more bannermen and fiercer warriors over Stannis who was given small, rocky islands with few bannermen. 

Is that very fair? To add insult to injury, Stannis was later arranged to marry Selyse Florent (crazy fetus jar woman) and her cousin was later deflowered on Stannis's own wedding night and Stannis's own bed by the one and only Bobby B. The result was a bastard known as Edric Storm, whose story in Season 3 was merged with Gendry.

We exit Robert's Rebellion with Stannis as Lord of Dragonstone and Master of Ships. We can look into this and discover where he received his ideals of merit over entitlement. Stannis, who had done his duty and never backed away from it, was neglected and never rewarded justly. As if to spite that whole event, Stannis turned towards rewarding those who deserve it over those who feel entitled to it. We see this when Stannis knights Davos of Flea Bottom, but takes a finger for each year of smuggling (four). The only requirement was that Stannis take Davos's son into service and that he did the act. Stannis did, and Davos was his loyal man since then.",55,278,False,self,,,,,

I was going to wait until I watched all of season 4 to start reading AFFC, but now I'm not sure because it looks like they are going to have to move Bran's storyline past ASOS in the show and I want to read what happens to him before I watch it on TV. So should I start reading AFFC now or wait? Another thing...did I just read that last part about Catelyn right or am I on something?! I can't believe this..",8,0,False,self,,,,,

Eddard Stark's death shocked me. Seemed like he was being set up as the main character of the series and then, boom, off with this head.

After that, nothing else really shocked me. Surprises aplenty of course, but I thought I was ready for anything. Even the Red Wedding didn't come as a huge shocker; granted, as dilligent as I was to avoid spoilers, I'd heard about an event called The Red Wedding because it was talked about freaking everywhere, even on the Daily Show!

But I digress. Jon Snow. Holy crap. I... I couldn't believe what I'd read.

Even crazier... I think it was justified. I understand why his brothers did it. I think it was a mistake, but from their POV I think it was a rational call. As far as they were concerned, he had utterly betrayed the Night's Watch. He'd given succor to the Wildlings, and now he was going to send the Night's Watch on a suicide mission to rescue more of them while he himself betrayed his vows to go deal with Ramsay Bolton.

I'm sure I'm not the first to come up with this theory, but I strongly suspect that Melisandre's going to resurrect Jon.

Unrelatedly, it feels so good to finally be done with ADWD! No longer need I fear spoilers! Now I can act extra smug around those filthy casuals who just watch the TV show. (kidding!)",46,41,False,self,,,,,

Some Night's Watch men, Samwell Tarly and Lord Commander Mormont among them, survive the White Walkers' attack and pledge to return to the Wall to warn the Seven Kingdoms. Jon Snow is brought before Mance Rayder, the ""King beyond the Wall"", and pledges his loyalty to the Wildlings. A scarred Tyrion Lannister unsuccessfully solicits recognition by his father Tywin, the new Hand of the King. Margaery Tyrell engages in charity work with the orphans of King's Landing. Ser Davos Seaworth is rescued by Salladhor Saan after the Battle of the Blackwater and returned to Dragonstone. There, he unsuccessfully tries to kill Melisandre so as to break her hold on Stannis Baratheon, and is imprisoned. Across the Narrow Sea, Daenerys Targaryen arrives in the city of Astapor to buy an army of brutally-trained slave soldiers, the ""Unsullied"". She is saved from an assassination attempt by the warlocks of Qarth by Ser Barristan Selmy, the former Kingsguard commander, who pledges his loyalty.|

The Starks have Ice, the Mormonts have Longclaw, and apparently the Celtigars of Claw Isle have a Valyrian steel axe. The Targaryens had the blades Blackfyre and Dark Sister which faded from history after the Blackfyre Rebellion, and the Lannisters once had a sword called Brightroar which was lost by King Tommen II of the Rock after he failed to return from his expedition to the ruins of Valyria. I ask you, fellow Redditors, to help me in coming up with names of Valyrian steel weapons for those Great Houses who do not have one, like the Tullys or Greyjoys. Here is my list so far:

**Canon**

* *Ice* - House Stark

* *Brightroar* - House Lannister, lost in the Smoking Sea.

* *Blackfyre*, *Dark Sister* - House Targeryen, lost to bastard houses.

**Non-Canon**

* *Ascalon* - House Martell. Named after the one St. George used to kill the dragon. Their symbol is a spear piercing a sun, and the Dornish are famous for using spears.

* *Cliffbreaker* - House Baratheon. A massive warhammer, much like the one Robert Baratheon used to kill Prince Rhaegar at the Battle of the Trident.

* *Gilt-thorn* - House Tyrell. Their symbol is a golden rose. Since the Reach is considered the heart of Westerosi chivalry and knighthood, a sword is the best option that fits thematically.

* *Hightalon* - House Arryn. A sword. Their symbol is a falcon, and their words are, ""As high as honor.""

* *Legbiter* - House Greyjoy. An axe, because Vikings. Named after the sword of King Magnus III of Norway, also known as Magnus Bareleg, who was the last ""Viking"" king and also the last King of Norway to die in battle abroad.

* *???* - House Tully. This is the one I'm really stuck on.",16,0,False,self,,,,,

Its too linear. Westeros is starkly based on a north/south axis and Essos is stunningly east/west. Continents are more globular.  

2. Where are the forests? If this world is like Earth, forests should be a far larger part of the ecosystem. Same can be said for deserts and to a degree mountains. There is a bewildering uniformity of landform here (grassland dominant).  

3. If its cold enough to not melt the Wall (which is made of ice), how can there be trees north of there? The northern-most tree-line should be well south of the Wall.

So within the last 200 days, someone posted a visual picture of the book series, and where the television seasons overlap within the books. It was on the front page, however I can't find it for the life of me now!  I'm new to the series and reading the book, then watching the correlating season. 

 
Yes I've tried searching for it on here, and on r/pics but no luck :/ I'm on my phone so that's limited me a lot. If someone remembers the title that I could search for, that would be awesome! Every little bit helps. 


Thanks so much! 

P.s. Fixed the spoiler label!

One of the few Americans in the cast (Peter Dinklage) doesn't speak in his natural accent as well. Is this an idea from the producers or GRRM himself? Also what is even the point? Wouldn't it make more sense if people from different regions had different accents? Plus, in a way, the fact that people have fled their homes to seek refuge in Westeros evokes a kind of United States perspective imo. I'm not saying they need to have American accents, I'm just trying to understand the British choice.

So my question is... if Frey is so inconsequential as a lord, then why is he so significant to the plot/outcome of the war? What does he bring to the table? Does he rule over some really strategic part of the kingdom or is it just his troops? And if it's just Frey's troops they need, and if he does have so many troops, why isn't his house more prestigious/powerful than it is?",16,2,False,default,,,,,

As with any adaptation, HBO has the difficult task of balancing the interest between readers and non-readers: the show itself should be capably followed and understood by viewers who haven't read any of the books, but it should also be reverent to its source materials to appease fans/readers and more importantly, to avoid boring viewers to death with constant exposition dumps (e.g., a character says, ""Remind me again, wasn't so-and-so the one who did XYZ at ABC during year 123?"").  Exposition is not only boring, but it reduces the immersion effect for viewers, i.e. it makes viewers very aware that they're watching a TV show that's trying to explain to them something.

I have just ordered the 5-book volume, literally less than 24 hours after finishing watching the 30th and most recent GoT episode.  **I just started re-watching ""Winter is Coming,"" the 1st episode -- which is why I'm writing this post.  Barely 20-25 minutes in, I've realized how many things I could not appreciate unless I had read the books or had already watched all the episodes at least once.**

I really feel like HBO has favored the readers to non-readers at a split of 75/25 or even 85/15, in terms of importance -- and I don't think there's anything wrong with that.  I.e., if it were 50/50 split, it would suffer from half the time having characters spelling out what's going on and what has happened, and the other half comprising of material that goes over the non-readers' heads completely.

Without having read the books, I find the show a tad cumbersome to follow.  There are so many characters, so many plots and sub plots, and so much history that should be supplied but simply can't, due to the medium.  

* **One of *my* more difficult problems is keeping track of characters/names**.  Season 1 was moderately challenging in remembering everyone's name and role; but by Season 3, I had to use the GoT wiki that's fan-made. There are just so many characters.  In a book, you can ""lock"" on to a character and his or her name because you'll be spending a few minutes reading about him or her.  But in the TV show, names are often mentioned in passing.  The main characters' names, they're remembered naturally.  But with minor, really *minor* characters, like Ilyn Payne, it's just nearly impossible.  The first few times he was mentioned after he was introduced, I had to look him up, since he doesn't have an active role (in Westeros and in the show), but his name is often mentioned by a certain character due to the importance of Payne's act -- which happened in a span of a few seconds, and it's never mentioned again.  Nonetheless, it's preferable, and I'd rather be tasked with looking up the name than having to sit through contrived exposition: i.e., I'd rather that character just say ""Ilyn Payne,"" rather than ""Ilyn Payne, the man who executed Ned Stark,"" since the latter would be so unnatural.  Even though it's preferable, it doesn't make it any less difficult to recall names.  Heck, it was difficult for me to keep track of who Varys and Baelish were in the first season and what their roles were.  By Season 3, I feel like HBO is expecting viewers to have read at least one or two of the books, because it's darn near impossible to keep track of everything without reading the books OR at least the wikias (databases for the show and novels).                                                                                                                                                                                                            

* **Similarly, it's a bit difficult keeping track of family histories and trees, for obvious reasons.**  Through the medium of television, you simply cannot waste time spelling it out to viewers, so it's understandable -- but again, it doesn't make it any less difficult.  Keeping track of the family trees of the Lannisters and Barratheons in the first season was a little tough, as was following the history between Ned and Robert, who John Arryn was and what his significance was (I didn't even realize that he was married to Catelyn's sister, nor did I realize that he was the former Hand until a while later).  

* Another ""regret"" -- if that's the word -- from not reading the books is the foreshadowing and/or ""Easter eggs,"" or even just regular inferences that HBO probably thought viewers would be able to make without reading the book.  Like I said, I've only watched the 30 episodes once, and i just started re-watching the first episode.  I remember the first time I watched the first episode, and I saw Jon Snow look up to Catelyn, I thought that they were having a secret love affair.  At that point, there was no mention that Jon was Ned's son or even bastard, and the look between the two was supposed to represent Catelyn's distaste for Jon -- yet it totally looked like sexual tension.  We're only about 20 minutes into the entire TV series, there's no way I'm going to make the connection that Ned went to war and came back with that kid Jon whom Catelyn refuses to acknowledge as part of the Stark family; if you read the books, the look totally makes sense.  But even later on in Season 1, I don't think that Catelyn says anything about her disapproval, yet from what I understand, it's clear in the books.   They don't even really clarify who the 5 children are, when they get the direpups; when Jon gets the runt, it's not clear why it's so funny or apt -- but it would be clear if you read the books.

Despite all of this, **I would NOT change a single thing about the show: HBO has done the right thing by making it more reader-friendly than non-reader friendly.**  It's hard enough to fit what they needed to fit in 600 minutes of the 1st season; I couldn't imagine an extra 10 seconds here and there to *explain* the context, like ""Hey, Jon, you get the runt of the litter, since you are technically one of Ned's 6 children because Ned brought you back from Robert's Rebellion one year after he left, and you were born with Stark blood but not in name, so you're a runt of the litter, too!""  This would just be terrible exposition and more importantly, it would be a horrific waste of time.

**Other non-readers who have watched the show: How far have you watched, and do you plan on reading any of the novels?  Have you been able to capably follow the show?  Or do you find yourself looking up names, events, etc. on the Westeros or GoT wikias?**

**TL;DR --  As much as HBO likely tried to make the show balanced for readers and non-readers, it clearly favors those who have read the book. Nonetheless, *Game of Thrones* is a fantastic adaptation and I would NOT change a thing, and it's due in large part to its reverence for the source material, favoring readers over non-readers.  In order to get maximum enjoyment of the series, you should read the books or at least read up on the wikia.  Otherwise, there's just way too much going on and too many characters for you to wrap your head around the show and understand it fully.**",52,39,False,self,,,,,

Let me get this straight...


Rhaeny's(Danys niece who was slain in her bed after the mad king was killed) cat's name was balerion, he was there as a kitten, when she was killed.

they said the true king of the red keep is the black cat that arya chases, it's the cat(older than sin and twice as mean) that shows her the escape route that she will use later..

Balerion is one of the ships dany rides home-she renamed them Vhagar, Meraxes and Balerion after the three dragons that brought her ancestor Aegon the Conqueror and his sister-wives to Westeros. 

Balerion was the dragon that forged the iron throne- he was the largest of all dragons.

**Note: If you haven't read A Dance With Dragons, stop now. Like, all of ADWD. Just starting? Click back. Halfway through? Click back. Almost done but still have a few chapters left? Back, back, BACK. You have been thoroughly warned.**

This was the first thing that popped into my mind after Jon's final chapter in ADWD. He was the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. Cool. Then he's killed by Marsh, and presumably someone else will be elected to become the 999th LC. With Melisandre up on the Wall, it seems pretty obvious that she's going to resurrect him, and he'll come back, kill Marsh and all them, and reestablish himself as the 1000th Lord Commander.

We already know GRRM has a thing for numbers - The New Gods (The Seven), Joff's marriage and death on January 1, 300 AL, etc., so this wouldn't be too far-reaching for him.

And then of course this leads into the discussion of Azor Ahai reborn and all that. Thoughts?",82,19,False,self,,,,,

I thought it might be fun for us to try and crowd-source some of the biggest misconceptions readers and non-readers alike have towards some of the plot details, overall lore, and even IRL situations surrounding both the book series and the television show....

I would like to see this non-reader safe, so I applied the ASOS/Season 3 spoiler tag..  If you have a misconception that is outside that scope, please feel free to post it, just apply correct tagging. Onto the thread



-----------------------------------------------------------------------

I am going to start with just a couple misconceptions that I've seen alot, the first being...

**-Targaryens are (not) immune to fire**

This is a misconception that I've seen among book readers as well as the show only folks. Based primarily off Dany's storyline in the first novel/season, this has lead to the misconception that all Targaryen's have an immunity to fire/being burnt...  While many Targaryens have shown a higher tolerance towards heat (Danerys as well as [D&amp;E](#b ""Aegon , aka ''Egg'' from the Tales of Dunk and Egg"")  )it is important to know that Danery's emerging unscathed from Drogo's funeral pyre was a one-off unique event, and a result of happenstance and a bit of blood magic.  History shows us even more to the contrary.  The aforementioned Aegon V was killed, along with his eldest son, Duncan ""The Small"" Targaryen in a fire while attempting to hatch dragon eggs, in an event that is known as the ""Tragedy at Summerhall"".  

Due to the fact that many Targaryens fought eachother in the Civil War known as ""The Dance of the Dragons"". Many of the family died as a result of fire related injuries that comes off as a result in dragon vs dragon battles...

And even more recently... [ADWD](#b ""Dany herself suffers burns in her flight from Mereen on Drogon's back"")

I hope that clears that up a bit..

**-  The Gold Cloaks and the Kingsguard are two different things**

This is more of a misconception among non-readers, than readers, and has alot to do with the costuming on the show, but yes... these are two separate and distinct organizations. 

The Gold Cloaks, or the City Watch are paid men who are in charge of keeping order in Kings Landing, they are essentially the police force in Kings Landing.. They are not honor bound (other than to the one who pays more), and swear no oaths or loyalty.

The Kingsguard is a group of seven knights who are in charge of protecting the King and his immediate family, the secret service of Westeros in a way.  They (like the Night's Watch) swear oaths of service (in the Kingsguard's case to the King), forgo inheritance and marriage, and serve until the death. 

I as I mentioned think this confusion arises over costuming decisions that the show has made regarding the Kingsguard.  In the novels the Kingguard are in ALL WHITE, including their armor, not just their cloaks.  The show depicts the apparel of the Kingsguard very similar to the attire of the city watch leading to said confusion...

Once again, I hope this clears things up for a few..

**- George is not that slow of a writer** 

This is an IRL misconception that I see alot of.  The misconception is that since both AFFC and ADWD took 5 and 6 years to release respectively, and take it to the next level by saying the trend will continue onto the release of ""The Winds of Winter"" being years away yet...

Those who tout this I feel might be unfamiliar with the publication history of books 4 and 5, they were an orginizational mess for Martin to write. On the two books Martin states..

&gt; The last one (AFFC) was a bitch, this one (ADWD) was three bitches and a bastard

... Without going into spoilers, between troubles of initially trying to set the then 4th book 5 years after the events of ASOS, canning that idea, and later deciding to split the books after the manuscript got too long, making sure that both books would sync up as they run parallel to each other, and his complications with the ""Mereenese Knot"" (don't google that if you've not read ADWD)... are all reasons for the long delay with the last 2 books... 

Evidence to the contrary that it takes him forever to write a book is the publication gaps between the first 3 novels in the series.  The gap from AGOT-ACOK was less than 3 years, and the gap from ACOK-ASOS was only 2 years... Martin has proved that he can write fast, and with the complications he had with AFFC/ADWD behind him, I think there's room for a little optimism that a large majority of the wait for TWOW is behind us.

Ned Stark had just admitted to kidnapping the son of the wealthiest man in Westoros, who also happened to be the brother of his wife; a man of his own Kings Guard had ambushed and injured his Hand, killed the Hand's men, and fled the Capitol; there was now talk of a war coming between 2 of the most powerful families in the Kingdom (Starks and Lannisters), and among this, the king decides to hand off the reins to Ned and go off to a multi-week hunting trip..? I know he was a bad king, but how bad to you have to be to do this? Is any reason given for this in the books?


Edit: OK, query resolved! Initially, I had thought there could be 3 reasons for Robert's going on the trip:   
  1. Reason to be shown in the show in a later season.  
  2. Reason given in books, but not shown in the show.  
  3. Plot hole.  

The actual answer turned out to be many-fold:  
* Robert routinely ignores, and tries to run away from, inconvenient truths,  
* Robert thought he was passing on the buck to someone who would be a better king than he was, and who could handle the situation better,  
* Robert couldn't have done much about the situation anyway (book spoilers not yet shown on show).

I have found it, however, and here I am.

STANNIS BARATHEON.

You either love him or hate him, but do you KNOW him?
I bet you may ask questions like, ""Why do people even like Stannis?"" or ""I just don't get the love for Stannis!"" or maybe even, ""Stannis is a dick, why do people like him?"" While I can't answer those questions for every single person who likes Stannis, I can explain to you why they WOULD possibly like Stannis.

Maybe you also have a question like, ""If Dany is still alive, then Stannis isn't the rightful heir, right?"" Or ""Why would Stannis kill his own brother."" or ""Why is Stannis used by Melisandre?"" These sorts of questions are easier for me to answer.

So, in order to explain the decisions Stannis has made now, we must go back into the past. DISCLAIMER: There will be spoilers up until ASOS but nothing plot major or past the TV series. Everything from the books that I will list will not spoil you of anything.

PART 2

**The Greyjoy Rebellion**
__________________________________________________________

The Greyjoy Rebellion occurred six years after Robert's Rebellion. Lord Balon Greyjoy of the Iron Islands had assumed that Robert's hold and support on the throne was not strong enough to defeat the Ironborn at sea. He crowned himself King of Salt and Rock and launched a naval attack on the Lannister fleet at Lannisport, destroying it.

Robert tasked Stannis Baratheon, as Master of Ships, to raise the Royal Navy and destroy the Iron Fleet led by Victarion Greyjoy. Stannis did exactly that, bringing the fleet around Dorne to meet up with Paxter Redwyne, a bannerman of Mace Tyrell and owner of the largest fleet in the Reach.

Stannis took the fleet to Fair Isle and set a trap for the Ironborn, which they fell for. Stannis had defeated and destroyed the largest Westerosi fleet and the greatest naval warriors in Westeros with one fall swoop. Had Stannis not defeated the Iron Fleet, Robert would have never one. It was now possible for troops to be ferried and landed on the Iron Islands. 

Instead of thanking Stannis and allowing him to take Pyke, Robert instead ordered that Stannis subdue Great Wyk, the largest island, while Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon subdued Pyke. Barristan Selmy was in charge of taking Old Wyk.

All the islands were subdued and Balon bent the knee as soon as Robert came crashing through. Balon's last surviving son, Theon, was taken as a hostage by Eddard Stark as punishment for Balon's treason, and so that he may never attempt the same thing again.

**Before Game of Thrones**
__________________________________________________________

As Master of Ships, Stannis was permitted to attend small council meetings and advise the King or the Hand on duties pertaining to the realm. While Robert whored, feasted, and drank his way to an early grave, Stannis and Jon Arryn ruled the kingdom. Things were stable for a while until Stannis began to notice that the children Joffrey, Tommen, and Myrcella do not share Robert's features. Stannis began to suspect that Robert's children were not Robert's, and took this information to Jon Arryn.

Together, Jon Arryn and Stannis investigated all of Robert's bastards in King's Landing in order to find evidence supporting their hypothesis.They end up finding Gendry, and then later the baby at the brothel that Littlefinger leads Ned Stark to. Checking the book that Maester Pycelle had, they determined that all of Robert's bastards had black hair and blue eyes, like Robert, while Robert's trueborn children had blonde hair with green eyes like Cersei and... Jaime.

The reason why Stannis came to Jon Arryn with this information and not Robert is because Robert doesn't like Stannis. Robert even may hate Stannis, and would view his finding as Stannis trying to make himself heir and usurp the throne from Robert's children. Jon Arryn was like a father figure to Robert, so if he were to tell him this information, Robert would believe him and have Cersei and Jaime executed and the children disinherited. 

It was all going to work out until Jon Arryn was murdered. Stannis assumed that it was the work of the Lannisters as he knew too much, and so Stannis fled back to Dragonstone after hearing that Robert was going to make Ned the new Hand of the King. Stannis felt disgraced that his own brother would choose Eddard over his own blood, who has been ruling these Kingdoms while Robert wasted his own life away.

**The War of Five Kings**
__________________________________________________________

We begin Season 2 and A Clash of Kings with the beginning of the War of Five Kings. The War of Five Kings is the clash between Robb Stark (King of the North), Joffrey Baratheon (King of the Iron Throne), Renly Baratheon (The King in Highgarden), Stannis Baratheon (The King in the Narrow Sea), and Balon Greyjoy (The King of the Iron Islands). 

We see that Stannis has the least amount of support going into the war. He had only the few vassals under Dragonstone and a few Crownlanders as well as some Florents from Selyse's family. Robb Stark has support of the Riverlands and the North. Renly has the Reach and Stormlands. Joffrey has the Crownlands and the Westerlands, and Balon has the Iron Islands. 

His first move was to deal with his younger brother. Renly had gone off prancing around calling himself King denying Stannis and even Joffrey their throne. Also, Renly denies Stannis his rightful bannermen of the Stormlands. Stannis is disgraced by this news. When Robert came asking for Stannis's support, Stannis answered it no matter what because Robert was the older brother. Now, it is Renly's turn and instead Renly goes off and says he should be king simply because he would be a better one.

And for those of you who think he would, think again. Numerous characters in the books remark how Renly would've been a more extravagant version of Robert and wouldn't amount to much as King. He blocked off supply lines to King's Landing causing numerous smallfolk to starve in the city. His acts were unethical and selfish. He feasted and tournied away PLAYING at war. Catelyn remakrs numerous times in the books that Renly and his knights were the Knights of Summer who've never fought a war.

War, however, was something Stannis knew all too well. He's fought in two wars and ruled the Kingdom in Robert's stead, and here is Renly who couldn't even stop corruption as his position of Master of Laws. You can blame Renly for Janos Slynt's corruption as he's in charge of that matter. 

So here arrives Stannis to besiege Storm's End and draw Renly to negotiate. Here is how it happens in the book from Catelyn's POV:

&gt; ""All this of snakes and incest is droll, but it changes nothing. You may well have the better claim, Stannis, but I still have the larger army. Renly's hand slid inside his cloak. Stannis saw, and reached at once for the hilt of his sword, but before he could draw steel his brother produced... a peach. ""Would you like one, brother?"" Renly asked, smiling. ""From Highgarden. You've never tasted anything so sweet, I promise you."" He took a bite. Juice ran from the corner of his mouth.
&gt; 
&gt; ""I did not come here to eat fruit."" Stannis was fuming.

There it is, folks. The peach scene. This scene is the most important part of the argument between Renly and Stannis.

The conversation ends with Stannis's terms and later Renly is assassinated.

Immediately upon Renly's death, the Stormlands bannermen bend the knee to Stannis and are pardoned. So much for friends, Renly. Stannis was right, ""Kings have no friends, only subjects and enemies."" 

I wonder how heartbroken or angry Stannis was to listen to his brother mock him with a peach. To betray his brother all because he has the bigger army and claims he would be a better king. All those innocent lives thrown away for one man's ambition. 

Renly is a good example of the power of charisma. You see how good it did him when he died though.

My final point for this part is Stannis's discussion with Davos over Renly's death.

&gt; For a long time the king did not speak. Then, very softly, he said, ""I dream of it sometimes. Of Renly's dying. A green tent, candles, a woman screaming. And blood."" Stannis looked down at his hands. ""I was still abed when he died. Your Devan will tell you. He tried to wake me. Dawn was nigh and my lords were waiting, fretting. I should have been ahorse, armored. I knew Renly would attack at break of day. Devan says I thrashed and cried out, but what does it matter? It was a dream. I was in my tent when Renly died, and when I woke my hands were clean.""
&gt; 
&gt; ""Renly offered me a peach. At our parley. Mocked me, defied me, threatened me, and offered me a peach. I thought he was drawing a blade and went for mine own. Was that his purpose, to make me show fear? Or was it one of his pointless jests? When he spoke of how sweet the peach was, did his words have some hidden meaning?"" The king gave a shake of his head, like a dog shaking a rabbit to snap its neck. ""Only Renly could vex me so with a piece of fruit. he brought his doom on himself with his treason, but I did love him, Davos. I know that now. I swear, I will go to my grave thinking of my brother's peach.""

So, is it that the show decided to omit Belwas but just spoil the fact that Arstan is actually Barristan, or did they change both of the charecters into Barristan?

I understand that it would be quite obvious from the fact that they are played by the same actor that these are the same people, but within the context of the story, Jorah would almost definitly react to this more than he did in the show, and even Dany might know of Barristan the Bold from Viserys's stories. So what gives? Why would they make this change, and effectively spoil it for people who are reading the books after watching the show like me? Just wondering why they would do that, and also why they aren't including Belwas despite the fact that he seems to be decently important. ",19,0,False,self,,,,,

On a whim I started listening to AGOT audiobook on Youtube and found it pretty interesting, if a little hard to follow (finishing a chapter then reading the summary on the AWOIAF wiki helped though). But my parents and several of my coworkers have been huge fans of the show, and they urged me to watch the series so we could discuss it together.

I've always thought reading the book before the show/movie was best, because there's only so much you can fit in one movie or series. So I figured I'd look up on the AGOT show wiki what episodes covered what chapters, read those chapters and then watch the episode.

I couldn't do it.

After managing to hold out reading the first two episodes before watching them I gave in and watched all three seasons within a week. The show is just amazing, it was impossible to stop myself!

Now, here's my dilemma: I'm only 20 hours into the 32 hour audiobook for AGOT (yes, it's incredibly long. I could read the book much faster than that but that's hard to do while sculpting) and I'm losing enthusiasm to keep going. I'm just frustrated that I'm so incredibly far behind what I already know from the show.

I know there's benefits to reading the book, a lot of insights from characters they couldn't portray in the show, but it feels like everything is just lagging on.


EDIT: I didn't realize that the FAQ said stuff about just starting from the beginning. But I still want to know, I'm incredibly bored with the first book right now. Would it suck for me personally if I skipped ahead?

So, should I keep on keeping on, knowing that reading the first three books will enrich the experience of the show, or should I jump on ahead to the fourth book where I have no idea what will happen, and will be much more enthusiastic about reading/listening to it?

And even Season 3 covered Theon's story past the scope of the third book, just a little.  Because the fourth and fifth books started concurrently telling different parts of the story, anything after the end of ASOS could reach into either the 4th or 5th books. 

Besides Theon, consider Dany.  Pretty much all that's left of her ASOS story is taking Mereen.  She took Yunkai in 2 episodes last season.  And confronting the bear, which is a single scene.  They're going to have to stretch her story out if her story in A Dance with Dragons is to fill the next 3 seasons.  I bet we get a lot of ADWD in Mereen in Season 4.

And Theon--I think they must be re-writing the whole Greyjoy story.  Balon falling off a bridge for no reason is stupid.  The Kingsmoot is too long a story to fit into a TV drama.  The Damphair and really the whole Drowned God religion doesn't fit the Ironborn very well anyway; who ever heard of pious pirates?  The show is already suggesting with the deviation of Yara going to rescue Theon that they're going to cut to the chase there... but how when so many other events (Stannis) need to happen first?  I think there will be MAJOR story mods with the Greyjoys altogether.  

There's also not a lot of action left for Bran before he's caught up through Book 5.  He had 2 chapters in ADWD.   Other than meeting Coldhands there's not much for him to do, unless the show writes in new material.

Which is the next interesting question... any thoughts about the show adding in new details to resolve these pacing issues?

Just putting this out there for discussion.

She's a very minor character in terms of the entire story (written so far), with the biggest plot point being at the end of AFFC (I believe), where she captures Brienne. I think the writers could be creative enough to write around that.

This begs the question then, how will they spread it out? 

If they do do 7, they'll have to do rest of asos plus a lil of AFFC and ADWD in season 4, then the rest of AFFC and ADWD in season 5, and then a season each for the last two novels. I feel they'd have to make the seasons longer than just 10 episodes for 6 &amp; 7 though seeing as GRRM stated that the final 2 novels will be 1.4k+ pages long. 

Another reason why I feel that they will not carry it on much longer than 7 seasons is the fact that most of the actors will look noticeably different, especially the 'children' who will be in their early 20s.
