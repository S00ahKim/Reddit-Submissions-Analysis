okay so I know and understand the whole thing about sworn shields and the Kingsguard as separate entities but I was reading up on the lore because it intrigues me however I find myself confused on conflicts of interests and would enjoy any insight provided on the matter. 

Hypothetical- Ser Barristan the Bold is told by King Robert that he's now assigned to Myrcella as her sworn shield/bodyguard, this is, of course, fine as members of the kingsguard can act in this capacity for royal members of the family that is not the king.

however if Myrcella marries- what happens than? if she becomes a Martell or Arryn or a Stark, then0 what is Barristan to do? she'll technically not be a member of the royal family anymore so does Myrcella lose her sworn shield or does Barristan rescind the Kingsguard- something he can't really do as it's a lifetime commitment- or does she retain Barristan despite no longer technically being a princess of the realms or keep the title? what of the kingsguard? if Barristan is up in the north or wherever defending Myrcella for as long as he lives that leaves the kingsugard down a member in all but name is a new one found? 

&amp;#x200B;

Aemond has  the same personality as Daemon Targaryen. Both were amoral reckless hot tempered swordsmen that had a dangerous reputation.

This is a really long shot but I'm desperately hoping someone else has read this too - there was a fanfiction posted a while back (at least 2018 if not earlier) on Archive of Our Own in the Game of Thrones universe, main setup/plot points as follows (as much as I remember):

* Sansa is disguised as Alayne Stone and is living with Petyr Baelish/Littlefinger (unfortunately I don't remember where but I think maybe at Winterfell???)
* finances are not looking great; iirc the living quarters are described as dark and uninviting
* Baelish decides to pay the Faceless Men to kill Sansa (""Alayne Stone"") - the fic specifically mentioned gold coins
* Arya arrives (I think she's wearing a face?) on assignment from the Faceless Men to kill Alayne Stone
* Arya sees one of the other more senior Faceless Men (I think the fic said the kindly man, but I could have misremembered and it could have been Jaqen) in the stable tying up his horse and worries that they've come to do the job themselves because she dawdled for too long
* Arya asks the other Faceless Man about the loophole of Alayne Stone not being a real person and basically gets told she's off the hook for Alayne/Sansa
* Baelish goes up to his quarters at night and pours himself wine; he drinks it and starts choking, realizing he's been poisoned
* Arya (I'm not sure if this was the other Faceless Man or Arya but I think it was Arya) steps out of the shadows and says ""Valar morghulis"" as Baelish asphyxiates; the gold coin imagery comes back but idr if the coins fall to the floor or if there's some other detail I'm missing

Obviously, I'm missing a lot of detail and some of it is fuzzy - I haven't read this fic in over 6 months if not a year. I also unfortunately do not know the author or the title of the fic. Additional details - there are no romantic relationships in this fic as far as I can remember; I don't remember what relationships it might have gotten tagged with, or what warnings it was tagged with (not everyone likes to tag Major Character Death for fear of spoilers). I'm fairly sure it had more than 1 chapter.

I would be ever so grateful if anyone could give me the title and/or author - I've been searching for it to no avail and I really wanted to reread it!! If you made it this far down the post, thank you for sticking with me :)",1,1,False,self,,,,,

Im a long time fan of the books and knew the show was just going to upset me. 
Ive actually enjoyed it up until season 5 and beyond. I just finished season 7 but theres something that is really bothering me. 
Why would Lyanna name her son with Rhaegar the same name of a son that Rhaegar already has? Are we supposed to assume Lyanna knows that The Mountain has killed Aegon and Rhaenys? And even if Lyanna knows why would she still choose that name for her son? 

Theres a lot of plot holes and changes in the show that annoy me but this one is the first one that I cannot figure out at all. 

Obviously in the books Jons name wont be Aegon because we already have one of those running around. 

Why did they decide to do this and why would Lyanna ever choose this name?",36,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

You know damn well that wasnt well written out. You know damn well that didnt fit her character. Nobody in their right mind should be believing that in THAT short of time she went from practically azor ahai; wanting to break the wheel and free the world and shit, right into hitler. She wasnt blinded by a shiny throne and power. She wanted that shit for the same reason she had fought for all along. I bend the knee to the true queen Danny seasons 1-7. Lmao Fuck that other one and that other bitch. Also this isnt serious but jump the downvotes and at my neck all you want. 

I think had that storyline been backed up with true character development I would (as a die hard Danny fan) have taken it the same as any awful thing that happened on that show. It was all good story telling up until. I think thats how most people who were upset about it feel. 

Also the lack of reasoning and story into the knight king lore and army was atrocious. It was like watching the end of lost. Who took the throne left that same taste for me as well.. that was a shit ending to a great show. Seasons 1-7 will always live on for me. 8 went down with Kings landing..  

Controversial(ish?) and late opinion but here it is. (I can talk about it now.. or at least argue;))

She's born into a noble house, sold off like cattle to marry a Dothraki ruler, whom she grows to love, gets pregnant then loses her baby. He dies, and at his funeral, she gets some dragons. From then on, she goes through obstacle after obstacle in order to 'reclaim her rightful place on the iron throne', since her father occupied it before he was killed. She has been through horrible things, and I would root for her just because she's come out of it alive, and stronger than before.

BUT.... I think everything I liked about her was gone after season 1.

So, she wants the Iron throne. Why? Well, because her father had it, and she's the rightful ruler. But, Westeros doesn't work like that. You have to earn the throne, you can't just expect people to bend the knee just because they have to. People bend the knee to Cersei because they fear her. Tywin strengthened his connections, gave people what they wanted in return for allies. Jon united the North with a common enemy. But why would they bend the knee to Daenerys?

She wants the throne because she wants to have the power of being Queen. It's as simple as that. And that's partially the reason why I don't like her. It isn't for the health of Westeros, or for the safety of her people. It's for herself. And I feel like she'd be the last one to know that.

She says she doesn't want to be like her father. Proceeds to threaten anyone who stands against her with her three dragons and wants to rule the Iron throne by force. How similar can you get?

She also has this thing about slavery.

Okay, no-one with half a brain thinks slavery is a good idea, and that masters are good people. but that doesn't mean you kill every master and free every slave in an already fragile society. Tyrion rights her when she is wrong, even though she wasn't even there to see her mistake, to see that gradual progress is better that radical change, to apologise. She says she wants to break the wheel in Westeros. Well, does she know anything about Westeros? Did she even successfully break the chains in Meereen to act as a foundation for what she would do in Westeros? She knows that she hates slavery. Ok, good. But her actions around it are rash and she's unaware of the domino effect that happened around the city.

She has dragons. She has loyal followers. She has a prophecy stating that she will be ruler. And that is what makes her powerful. Not the fact that she may be generous or giving or the breaker of chains. She doesn't gain her power from people believing in her, she gains her power from people believing in the power she has.

She's all about kill now, think later, then feel guilty later and never formally apologise. Like when she attacked Jamie's army. When she killed the masters. When she had that slave problem in Mereen that Tyrion had to clean up.

But, what would she be if she didn't have dragon's? If she wasn't a beautiful woman who could walk in fire?

I don't want to say she was handed everything on a silver platter, because she wasn't. She had to fight for her dragons, for, well, herself and her Dothraki people. But she expected everyone to bend the knee to her without any questions, without knowing what Westeros was even like. How can you abolish slavery in Westeros when you haven't even grown used to the place yourself? How can you become ruler of a country you know little about, a country that you have never grown to love?

TDLR: If the directors positioned Daenerys to be a flawed, ambiguous character, I think I'd like her. I'd understand her more. But the ways she's portrayed as this undefeatable warrior goddess saint breaker of chains stormborn person is just annoying. It's an insult to the potential the character had.",22,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

LA VERA STORIA DI JENNY OF OLDSTONES ( liberamente ispirata ai libri di George R.R. Martin)
Jenny of Oldstones era una semplice popolana, proveniente da un paesino sperduto arroccato su una collina verdeggiante,  che per riusc a conquistare il cuore dell'erede al trono, Duncan Targaryen, durante uno dei suoi viaggi nei suoi pi remoti possedimenti.
Il principe infatti rifiut di sposare la principessa che gli era stata promessa per unirsi in matrimonio con Jenny.
 Questa decisone cre degli screzi con il re Aegon V Targaryen che non tollerava l'idea che il figlio ascendesse al trono con una donna di umili origini al suo fianco e cos Duncan rinunci alla corona pur di non separarsi da Jenny.
Il tempo pass e crebbe l'affetto del popolo per Jenny, la quale venne infine accettata anche dalla famiglia reale.
Gli eventi per presero una piega tragica quando, nella residenza reale di Summerhall, Aegon decise di far schiudere alcune uova di drago: a causa del mancato controllo del fuoco, si gener un terribile incendio in cui morirono il re, Duncan e il comandante delle guardie reali. Il fuoco distrusse tutto il regno di Duncan fino ad arrivare ai suoi pi remoti paesini. 
L' incendio viene ricordato con il nome di ""tragedia di Summerhall"": il rogo rase al suolo il palazzo reale e tutto il regno.
Non  ben chiaro se Jenny stessa sia morta in quell'occasione,  scappata o rimasta viva e nascosta.
La leggenda narra che sopravvisse e, impazzita per il dolore, scapp rifugiandosi nell' ultima roccaforte rimasta in piedi dopo l' incendio, proprio il paesino sperduto da cui proveniva, dopo mille peripezie che minarono ancora di pi la sua salute mentale, gi distrutta dal dolore della perdita di tutte le persone amate e della distruzione del regno intero, sentendosi anche responsabile per le migliaia di morti.
Qui si interrompe la leggenda , narrata oralmente, di Jenny e della sua pazzia.
Ma andiamo invece a vedere cosa realmente accadde ed a svelare ci che rimase segreto ai pi.
Dopo che si fu rinchiusa, quindi, all'  interno della fortezza in rovina  pensando  che nessuno  avrebbe potuto raggiungerla  e preparandosi ad una morte imminente, si dimentic che, in un momento di delirio, aveva rivelato i  suoi piani ad  una dama di corte, anch'essa sopravvissuta. 
Si racconta che questa dama, legata a Jenny da un profondo affetto, non rassegnandosi per la sua perdita, inizi a cercarla e la trov. Finalmente pot riabbracciarla. 
La donna vide una Jenny magra ma ancora bella e non ancora impazzita. O almeno cos sembrava.
Inizi a portarle del cibo ed a cercare di convincerla ad uscire. Ma il tempo pass insieme alle stagioni e nonostante le continue visite e le sue parole affettuose la dama inizi a venire rifiutata, a notare che il cibo portato alla ragazza non veniva pi toccato e che Jenny ormai non faceva che vivere dei ricordi che la perseguitavano insieme alle voci dei suoi congiunti morti.
Non credendo ai fantasmi, alla fine la dama, vestita con i suoi abiti di corte che le davano un senso di severit, decise di presentarsi al castello e con la forza strappare una Jenny ormai troppo debole per rifiutarsi,  da ci che lei pensava fossero solo fantasie causate dal trauma, dall' isolamento e dalla scarsa alimentazione.
Ci che che si trov davanti invece fu un vero inferno in terra.
Insegu Jenny nei sotterranei e quello che vide fu una ragazzina ridotta ad uno scheletro, piena di lividi, sporca e con uno sguardo che non lasciava dubbi sullo stato della sua mente.
Nonostante tutto si fece  coraggio, le si avvicin ancora e l' orrore le si pales davanti. 
Solo allora cap che i fantasmi e le voci di cui Jenny parlava erano REALI e non fantasie.
Mani sbucarono dal muro cercando di afferrarla, gemiti si udirono uscire dalle pietre e la stessa Jenny cerc, con sguardo lupesco, di afferrarla per trascinarla nel buio

Fu troppo.
La dama scapp via in preda ad un feroce panico e, una volta al sicuro, voltandosi  vide solo una scia di fumo.
Dopo di che, dal castello, non si ud pi alcun rumore..ma misteriosamente rimase disabitato e, lentamente, and in rovina. 
Passarono anni ed anni: la dama allora,   non  volendo far sparire la memoria della ragazza che aveva tanto amato, scrisse delle strofe cantate sulla sua protetta, raccontandola felice mentre ballava e cantava con i fantasmi delle persone amate. Evit accuratamente di raccontare la reale storia di Jenny, che la vedeva trasformarsi in un essere folle, blasfemo ed assassino.
La sua  ipotetica morte, ovvero un suicidio per mano del fuoco,  non ha comunque avuto testimoni, se non un filo di fumo che si alz dalle segrete.
Nessuno sapr mai chi o cosa sia Jenny of Oldstones.

 #jennyofoldstones the true story.
the video ( shot in a real medieval fortress from 900 which is located in Arnara, Italy). 
Below the unpublished version of: THE REAL STORY OF JENNY OF OLDSTONES ( inspired by the books of George R. R. Martin).
Jenny of Oldstones was a simple commoner, coming from a remote village on a verdant hill, which managed to steal the heart of the heir to the throne, Duncan Targaryen, during one of his travels in his remote possessions. The Prince, in fact, refused to marry the Princess who had been promised to him and decided to marry Jenny.
This decision created disagreements with King Aegon V Targaryen who didnt tollerate the idea that his son ascended to the throne alongside a woman of humble origins and so Duncan gave up the crown to stay with Jenny.
Time passed and grew the affection of the people for Jenny, who was finally accepted by the Royal family. The events, however, took a bad turn when, in the residence of Summerhall, King Aegon decided to hatch some dragon eggs: due to lack of control of the fire, a terrible fire broke out in which died the King, Duncan and the commander of the Royal family. The fire destroyed all the kingdom of Duncan up to its most remote countries. The fire is remembered with the name: The Tragedy at Summerhall.
It is not clear if Jenny died in that incident, or has escaped or still remained alive and hidden. The legend tells that survived and, gone mad caused by pain, ran away taking refuge in the last remaining stronghold after the fire, right in the village where she was born; Jennys mental health deteriorated, already destroyed by the pain of the loss of all beloved people and the destruction of the entire kingdom, also feeling responsible for the thousands of dead people.
At this point the legend stops, narrated orally, when Jenny gone mad.
But lets see what really happened and to reveal what remained secret to the most.
After she locked herself up inside the ruined fortress thinking that no one could reach her and preparing herself to imminent death, she forgot that, in a moment of delirium, she had revealed her plans to a court lady, also survived.
It is said that this lady, tied to Jenny from a deep affection, didnt resign herself to the loss of the girl and for this reason she started looking for her and she found her. Finally the lady could hug Jenny again.
The woman saw a very thin but still beautiful and not yet mad Jenny; or so it seemed.
She started bringing her food trying to convince her to go out. But time passed with the season despite the constant visits and her kind words the lady began to be rejected, she noted that the food was no longer touched; now Jenny lived on memories that haunted her with the voices of her dead relatives. 
The woman, who didnt believe in ghosts, decided to go to the castle wearing her court clothes, which gave her a more sense of severity, in order to take Jenny away from what she thought were just fantasies caused by the trauma of isolation and poor nutrition, but what she found instead was a real hell on earth. 
The lady chased Jenny into the basements and what she saw was a girl reduced to skin and bones, bruised, dirty and her eyes left no doubt about her mental health. In spite of everything she took courage, approached her and the horror appeared in front of her. 
Only in that moment she understand that the voices and the ghosts Jenny talked about were real and not fantasies.
Hands came out of the wall trying to take her, groans were heard came out of the stones. Jenny searched, with an evil look, to grab the woman and drag her into the darkness.
It was too much.
The woman ran away in panic, and, once safe, she turned and saw a trail of smoke. After that, no sound was heard from the castle.....but misteriously remained uninhabited and, slowly, went to ruin.
Years and years passed: the lady, who didnt want to make the memory of the girl she loved so much disappear, wrote singing verses. The lady wanted to remember Jenny while she was happy and danced and sang; she carefully avoided telling the real story of Jenny, who saw her turn into a mad, blasphemous and murderous being. Her hypothetical death, that was suicide, didnt have any witnesses, but only a wisp of smoke that rose from the castle.

It is said that this lady, tied to Jenny from a deep affection, didnt resign herself to the loss of the girl and for this reason she started looking for her and she found her. Finally the lady could hug Jenny again.
The woman saw a very thin but still beautiful and not yet mad Jenny; or so it seemed.
She started bringing her food trying to convince her to go out. But time passed with the season despite the constant visits and her kind words the lady began to be rejected, she noted that the food was no longer touched; now Jenny lived on memories that haunted her with the voices of her dead relatives. 
The woman, who didnt believe in ghosts, decided to go to the castle wearing her court clothes, which gave her a more sense of severity, in order to take Jenny away from what she thought were just fantasies caused by the trauma of isolation and poor nutrition, but what she found instead was a real hell on earth. 
The lady chased Jenny into the basements and what she saw was a girl reduced to skin and bones, bruised, dirty and her eyes left no doubt about her mental health. In spite of everything she took courage, approached her and the horror appeared in front of her. 
Only in that moment she understand that the voices and the ghosts Jenny talked about were real and not fantasies.
Hands came out of the wall trying to take her, groans were heard came out of the stones. Jenny searched, with an evil look, to grab the woman and drag her into the darkness.
It was too much.
The woman ran away in panic, and, once safe, she turned and saw a trail of smoke. After that, no sound was heard from the castle.....but misteriously remained uninhabited and, slowly, went to ruin.
Years and years passed: the lady, who didnt want to make the memory of the girl she loved so much disappear, wrote singing verses. The lady wanted to remember Jenny while she was happy and danced and sang; she carefully avoided telling the real story of Jenny, who saw her turn into a mad, blasphemous and murderous being. Her hypothetical death, that was suicide, didnt have any witnesses, but only a wisp of smoke that rose from the castle.
No one will ever know who or what is Jenny of Oldstones.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

So, I just wondered what everyone thinks about Cersei?   I might have a completely different opinion, but here goes.

I think she's an alright ruler. Probably the best person that could rule the throne  from s4-s7 Yeah, I said it, fight me.

So, she cares about her family above all. Nothing stops her from protecting her fam, and eventually her actions towards other people cost the lives of her children. She's smart. Beyond smart, and cunning. And I admire that. She supports whatever Joffrey and Tommen wants, but she makes mistakes, and each mistake she makes drives her further into up the 'ladder of chaos'. She gets more and more confident, more risky. 

Although, she blames everyone else for the deaths of her family. Her mother and her father on Tyrion, (look, I'm not even gonna get started on that), and she doesn't begin to contemplate that she might be the reason for Tommen's death. Seeing that Jamie wasn't thinking with her interests in mind was probably one of the hardest things she went through, and you could tell that letting him go was a big blow for her. 

I don't know about anyone else, but I want rooting for Cersei when she blew up the cathedral thing. The whole scene had me sitting on the edge of my seat, hoping that it would happen, that some people would escape, and then when it happened, I was kind of glad. Because it was a necessary evil. She knew that Margaery and Loras were pretty much gone already. No matter what happened, he would have a life not worth living, and she would be trapped in the religion, and since Cersei didn't particularly like either, it wasn't that big of a loss. The high sparrow would have been almost impossible to kill, and everyone else in the cathedral would have been calaterol, at least to Cersei. Jaimie, Tommen and the Mountain were safe in her eyes.  The high sparrow was taking over the city, hurting Tommen, and disrupting her alliances. She needed an act that would make her seem more powerful and capable than ever before, to show that no-one could hurt Tommen, or his rule as King. 

Cersei is probably the most cunning person in the seven Kingdoms, and although I can say that her love for her children may make her think irrationally and arrogantly, she's violent, vengeful and a real bitch, but she's smart about it. She keeps the red keep safe from invaders, becomes one of the first rulers to pay off the Iron banks's debts (at least I think she does that) and she makes strong connections and alliances, even though most of them are through blackmail or threats. 

That's the thing about Westeros. None of the characters are perfect, none of them make the right decisions, none are the hero. They're all in that grey area. 

She's interesting, and she's probably one of my favourite characters.",11,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Well and there is the point where I have to say TV Shows like Avatar The Last Airbander have done that as well. But Avatar is constantly labeld as this one kid show from Nickelodeon.

Just because it's a different type of medium?

But eventually, when I started to watch S3 finale's red wedding, it gave a perfect ""happy wedding"", everyone was happy, it was extremely beautiful and then when the huge plot twist started with the assassinations of Robb and his men and then the scene where they sewn robb's direwolf head on his corpse really struck me hard and too gruesome where I actually decided to stop watching for awhile.

\---

Robert goes to the Tower of Joy with Ned and Howland to fight Ser Dayne and his men. After winning the sword fight, all three men go to the screams they hear. They open the door to find Lyanna Stark, Ned's sister and Robert's beloved, dying in her bed and holding a newborn baby. Ned and Robert rush to her side. She gives Ned the same speech about Jon (Aegon). Robert is shocked and angered when he realizes Lyanna never loved him. She loved Rhaegar. 

Ned takes Aegon into his arms and says his farewells to his sister. She passes. Ned looks to Robert and sees the trademark Boratheon fury take over. Ned hands Aegon to Howland, who leaves the room to console the baby's cries. Ned and Robert, who just won a war together, now must confront each other.

""The child will die,"" says Robert. Ned looks at him. He is not surprised at Robert's reaction, but disappointed in his friend nonetheless. 

""He's an innocent baby. He's my nephew. He has the blood of the First Men and the dragon.""

Robert can't bring himself to say any more. He's too enraged. He won the war, but he lost his love to his enemy and now his closest friend stands against him. Ned speaks again.

""After everything we've accomplished together. After all the bloodshed and fighting. You owe me this, Robert.""

Robert draws his sword in front of his old friend. Ned musters the remaining energy he has after a long war. Stark, the better swordsman, draws Ice and clashes with his king. The fight lasts no more than a minute as Ned disarms Robert and knocks him to the ground. He throws Robert's sword on the ground in disgust of the horrible situation. He quickly leaves the tower and finds Howland awaiting with baby Aegon at the bottom of the steps. Eddard and his banner man leave Dorne and embark on their journey back to Winterfell. Robert, left alive by Ned, lays defeated next to Lyanna's body. 

\-----

 After this, the North is essentially in open rebellion against the crown. Ned raises Aegon not as a bastard. Idk if another war happens between Ned and Robert (would Robert win with Tywin's army? Or is his army too depleted after the war?) Maybe in the future, Robert does finally kill Ned but Aegon flees across the Narrow Sea and finds Daenerys. Then they fly to Westeros just like Aegon the Conqueror and his sisters did and they retake the crown. And they rule together? Or Dany rules and Aegon Stark rules the North. (I like the idea of calling him Aegon Stark.)",1,1,False,self,,,,,

They open the door to find Lyanna Stark, Ned's sister and Robert's beloved, dying in her bed and holding a newborn baby. Ned and Robert rush to her side. She gives Ned the same speech about Jon (Aegon). Robert is shocked and angered when he realizes Lyanna never loved him. She loved Rhaegar.

Ned takes Aegon into his arms and says his farewells to his sister. She passes. Ned looks to Robert and sees the trademark Boratheon fury take over. Ned hands Aegon to Howland, who leaves the room to console the baby's cries. Ned and Robert, who just won a war together, now must confront each other.

""The child will die,"" says Robert. Ned looks at him. He is not surprised at Robert's reaction, but disappointed in his friend nonetheless.

""He's an innocent baby. He's my nephew. He has the blood of the First Men and the dragon.""

Robert can't bring himself to say any more. He's too enraged. He won the war, but he lost his love to his enemy and now his closest friend stands against him. Ned speaks again.

""After everything we've accomplished together. After all the bloodshed and fighting. You owe me this, Robert.""

Robert draws his sword in front of his old friend. Ned musters the remaining energy he has after a long war. Stark, the better swordsman, draws Ice and clashes with his king. The fight lasts no more than a minute as Ned disarms Robert and knocks him to the ground. He throws Robert's sword on the ground in disgust of the horrible situation. He quickly leaves the tower and finds Howland awaiting with baby Aegon at the bottom of the steps. Eddard and his banner man leave Dorne and embark on their journey back to Winterfell. Robert, left alive by Ned, lays defeated next to Lyanna's body.

\-----

After this, the North is essentially in open rebellion against the crown. Ned raises Aegon not as a bastard. Idk if another war happens between Ned and Robert (would Robert win with Tywin's army? Or is his army too depleted after the war?) Maybe in the future, Robert does finally kill Ned but Aegon flees across the Narrow Sea and finds Daenerys. Then they fly to Westeros just like Aegon the Conqueror and his sisters did and they retake the crown. And they rule together? Or Dany rules and Aegon Stark rules the North. (I like the idea of calling him Aegon Stark.)",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Wouldnt then The Hound need to be revived if he had lost, since Berics prophecy wouldnt be able to be fulfilled if The Hound hadnt also been around to take care of/also save Arya? Wouldnt Beric or Thoros have seen The Hounds part of the prophecy in the flames too?

Conspiracy theory on the way!

I have finally figured out why season 8 was so bad.

Basically head-honcho studio directors were sitting around smoking cigars and they were reminiscing all the great TV that Game of Thrones had provided them before season 8 was beginning to be written:

*""What a fantastic show it has been""*

""I concur entirely. How are we ever going to do this again?""

*""Well actually, that's a good point.""*

""Hmm yes! All TV will now be compared to the standard of Game of Thrones. Television could take a massive hit to future shows and ratings.""

*""Wow, yes! The entire landscape of media in fact, would be compared back to Game of Thrones. ""*

""Holy moly! You're right! It would do what World of Warcraft did to the MMO industry - in that literally every new product gets compared to it now.""

*""Oh yeah! And Harry Potter!""*

""So many young people no longer read books, *because* harry potter books were too good!""

*""This season could descimate our industry, actually, come to think of it.""*

""What would we do, how am I going to afford the 12,831 housekeeping staff in this mansion?""

*""We should do something about this.""*

And so, the big studio honchos snuffed out their cigars and went and recruited some other big players in the industry, and through a somewhat impressive network of threats and attractive deals, they forced the hand of D&amp;D to produce their lacklustre result. And in doing so, they ensured that TV could continue to be enjoyed in the future, free from the constraints of the very human trait of comparison.

----

^*recently, ^around ^the ^fireplace ^at ^head ^honcho's ^mansion*


*""I say old chap, we played that remarkably well. Look at all the great TV that's coming out.""*

""I concur entirely, we have reiterated the commodisation of TV in this country, and around the world""",5,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

There's the Wall, like Hadrian's Wall at the narrowest point of the country; and here we have Dorne, in shape so much like Kent: Those features are clear, others more jumbled out of place - bulges and projections vaguely suggesting this or that (East Anglia for example).

We have the Celts (First Men), Anglo-Saxons (Andals)...Westeros is divided into seven Kingdoms as Anglo-Saxon England once was...Even the names Stark and Lannister evoke York and Lancaster...and then we have a Conqueror. The Dragons of course are an Arthurian reference: Arthur was called Pendragon (head dragon): The Ancient Welsh called a war leader a dragon. The Red Dragon remains on the flag of Wales. (Though it doesn't have three heads).

However there are many British references that far fewer people will recognize. Here are four:

*The Blackwater:* The name of the Thames comes from Celtic Tamesa: The Black River.

*The Narrow Sea*: An ancient name of the English Channel.

*The Summer Sea:* An ancient name of the Severn Estuary north of Somerset, the Summer Country of Arthurian Legend. (Also called the Sabrina Sea) (This theme repeats in Summerhall, the Lands of the Long Summer).

*Balerion:* Very similar to Belerion, a name predating ""Britain"" itself: It refers to the one of 3 parts of the island (the southwest) when Britain was known to the classical world only as Albion. A name almost as old as Stonehenge. (For Tolkien fans, note the closeness to *Beleriand,* the part of Middle Earth that sank beneath the sea after the War of Wrath)

And then there's Starfall. And Dawn.....But I will say no more.",5,1,False,self,,,,,

Every member of the Nights Watch knows Jon Snow, He died, his watch ended. He went to Castle Black and  the first thing you notice is that everyone there moved aside as though Jon was the main attraction in a parade of sorts. The wildlings look at Jon Snow like he is a savior and the Men of the Nights Watch look at Jon with Respect. That being said, Jon did not repeat his vows to the Nights Watch. He went North of the Wall and I think Bran sent him there just to make sure that he lives. Possibility #2, to go North of the wall and look for surviving Wildlings.

The one thing that everyone who watched the show doesnt understand about is Jon Snow. It is literally anyone who will oppose Jon Snow? He saved the World, not Bran. He killed his Queen in order that everyone lived free. Daenarys wanted to basically enslave everyone to her Rule and those who did not bow down to her, she would kill. No one in Westeros would go after Jon Snow, he has the Nights Watch protecting him as well as the Wildlings. Tormund had it right when he left Winterfell and went back North. The only place they could live free without anyone taking that away from them. Sansa wouldnt allow the Free Folk live South of the Wall. Jon has basically become the King beyond the Wall. Spring, if anyone took Notice when Jon passed through the Wall had sprung. The Patch of grass growing out of the Snow.

Jon is the Last Hero, Azor Ahai. Along with Arya. Arya killed the Night King and Jon Killed the new Mad Queen. The final result being complete and total peace.

Jons was sentenced to the Wall, the Nights Watch was never mentioned. Jon is exactly where he is supposed to be. Now will we see this ending in the books? Maybe and maybe not.",9,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Im not sure, its been a few days before in between episodes and I dont really want to go check but anyway, point being, old man dying. 

So they talk for a minute and The Hound ends up putting him out of his misery by stabbing him again. As hes standing up and cleaning his blade he looks down at Arya and tells her Thats where the heart is. She gives the wound one more significant glance as they stand and leave.

Like House Stark Stark literally nearly went extinct they have Sansa Stark now that Bran is ruling the other 6 Kingdoms and Arya going West. House Baratheon literally went extinct and had to be brought back with Gendry being legitimized by Dany. House Lannister there are loads but we never really see others so they had it right. 

House Arryn literally only has Robin and distant relatives that will take the Arryn name if he dies, House Tully was close to going extinct but you could say the Blackfish could have rectified this in his youth through marriage and continue Tully family through his line. House Martell is still going through unknown Martell we have never heard of.

Even House tyrell had more sons in the books and House Targaryen  how is there not even descending bastards as there was quite alot.

Obviously  most Houses are short due to not wanting Civil War to happen in their own families but just strange how short they are  in most of the houses in GOT",1,1,False,self,,,,,

The Queen speaks. 

""Ser Barristan, before you take a relaxing stroll through our city that is currently going through civil unrest, I insist that you wear a set of armor, and to hide your identity, cover it with a cloak.""

""Your Grace."" Ser Barristan replies with a nod. 

**A Short While Later**

The Sons of the Harpy are fighting The Unsullied. Grey Worm is injured, and it looks as though the Harpies are about to succeed in assassinating him. A cloaked, hooded figure appears at the end of the hallway. The voice of an old man is heard..

""All of you must throw down your weapons and surrender. I will ask the Queen to show you mercy."" 

The Harpies laugh at him, several taunts are made in their native language, asking how a lone, old man can stop them. None drop their weapons. 

The old man removes his cloak, and drops it to the floor. His shining Queensguard armor blazes in the light. One of the Harpies, recognizing him, bolts out the other end of the hallway, closes a large door behind him, and quickly attempts to bar it before fleeing, abandoning his fellow Harpies. One of the Harpies jeers at him for fleeing from an old man. 

Ser Barristan draws his sword. 

[The correct music begins to play in the background.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaEzKRngCyY)

The Harpy closest to him flinches and takes a few steps back. One of the Harpies shouts to attack. The group charges to Ser Barristan. 

Over the next 45 seconds, the Sons of the Harpy are slaughtered. After the first couple of Harpies go down, one closer to the door begins to bang on it, shouting ""HELP US!"" while attempting to open the door. But the Harpy outside is now well out of earshot, and would not have returned if he could. They are trapped with Ser Barristan. Soon, the Harpy cowering by the door is the only Harpy still alive. 

The Harpy gazes upon Ser Barristan, his sword is now completely coated red with blood. It appears as if glowing bright red for a few moments, gleaming from the light shining through the hall windows. The Harpy knows that if he fights the Lord-Commander of the Queensguard, then he will die. This... Dark Lord Barristan outmatched him, with his glowing red sword. 

He throws down his weapon, kneels to Lord Barristan, and pleads for mercy. 

Lord Barristan helps Grey Worm stand, whom leans on his spear. Grey Worm thanks him for saving him a Harpy. 

""He's not for you to kill. Prisoners can be interrogated, and he is now our prisoner."" 

Grey Worm regards him with surprise, but grudgingly agrees. After a pause, he states ""We needed more prisoners anyway."" 

Lord Barristan chuckles. ""Heh.. all too easy."" 

The camera cuts to the throne room of Daenerys, the bound Harpy sits on his knees in front of Grey Worm, whom is sitting on the lower steps as his wounds are tended to. Grey Worm and several other guards are scowling at the prisoner. The prisoner asks what they are going to do with him. A Dothraki guard steps forward and looks over the prisoner, inspecting him, before idly remarking that his skin would not make very good leather. Too poor quality. 

Queen Daenerys quickly enters the room, and rushes over to Grey Worm, asking about the injuries. Grey Worm insists that he is fine - and that he was saved from significant harm by Lord Barristan, whom slaughtered a dozen Harpies alone - but Daenerys insists that he get some proper rest. Missandei helps him walk out of the room and to his quarters.

Queen Daenerys turns to Lord Barristan, whom is idly grooming himself and attempting to wipe any remaining spots of blood off his clothes. She speaks. 

""Didn't they cause you any trouble?""

Lord Barristan turns and smiles to her, shaking his head. ""Like carving a cake, your grace."" 

**A Less-Short While Later** 

The camera pans down to Daenerys and Tyrion. ""You're going to advise me."" Daenerys says. Tyrion smirks and lifts a glass to toast the decision, before quickly having his smirk turn into a frown as Daenerys snatches the cup. ""While you can still speak in complete sentences.""

Tyrion pauses for a moment, sighs, and asks if he can choose the execution option. 

""Your Queen forbids it."" Daenerys replies. 

Tyrion lowers his head for a moment, grumbling. ""Oh, very well.."" and grudgingly agrees to limit his alcohol consumption to no more than five times the legal carriage-driving limit, before rushing on to squeeze in saying ""and what would you like me to advise you on?"" in an attempt to rapidly change the subject from his Queen-Imposed alcohol regulations. 

""How to get what I want."" she answers. 

""And what is that?"" Tyrion asks. 

""The Iron Throne."" she answers, with a stern, authoritative glare. 

Tyrion leans back in his chair, looks up at the ceiling, sighs, and folds his hands in his lap. ""It's really not all that great.. perhaps you should try wanting something else."" 

""If I want jokes, I'll get myself a proper fool."" Daenerys responds, glaring. 

Tyrion begins to respond, while leaning forward, grabbing a cup, and begins pouring wine into it, ""Is the Iron Throne what you want, or is that what Viserys told you to want? I know it's difficult to not want something you've been told to want all your life, but it can be - "" 

Tyrion stops speaking as Daenerys again snatches the cup away from him. He takes a drink directly out of the jug, before placing the jug back down in his lap, out of her reach. Daenerys raises an eyebrow at him and continues glaring. 

""You don't seem to be very good at following your own advice."" she observes. 

Tyrion sighs, and grudgingly places the jug back on the table, before folding his arms on the table, and wearily resting his head on them. ""I havn't wanted wine all my life. Just most of it. However, I am keenly aware wine is not what I really want. It just makes the pain of not getting what I want easier to stomach."" 

Tyrion stares at Daenerys for a few pensive moments, before continuing, ""As your advisor, I'd like to keep you from being in my situation.. so it's important we establish, what do you want?"" 

Daenerys glares at Tyrion, impassively. She ponders for a few moments, before breaking eye contact and looking around the room. 

""You seem to quite enjoy freeing slaves.."" Tyrion observes. 

""Yes, I do."" Daenerys says, for the first time in the scene, a slight smirk appears on her face. 

""Do you think you can do that better ruling from here in Essos, or across the sea in Westeros? I saw many slaves and slavers on my way to Meereen, was even sold as a slave myself at one point, this continent is filled with slavery. Who's going to save them if not you? Who's going to maintain the peace if your armies sail away?"" 

Daenerys leans back in her chair and studies Tyrion for a moment. ""It's true, maintaining the peace has been hard. Obviously it would be harder without my armies or my dragons. But there is no Iron Throne in Essos."" 

""There can be."" Tyrion states, leaning closer in interest, ""A thousand blades, forged in dragon-fire. Howabout ten thousand broken chains? A new Iron Throne, not from the swords of the conquered, but the broken chains of the freed."" he pauses for a moment before continuing, ""You may as well put all that iron to use.""

Daenerys tilts her head to the side and stares at him for a few seconds, before smiling. ""I think I'm going to like you."" 

**A Short While Later**

The camera pans to the front of the city of Meereen, at twilight. Daenerys' [theme music plays.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfmoyTL64R0) Nightfall is setting in, as carts full of chains are being unloaded into a massive pile. Tyrion and Missandei are looking over shipping manifests and ledgers, discussing the amounts of iron being shipped in from other cities Daenerys had visited, and inspecting shipments of stone. Tyrion and Missandei stand and observe the first of a large, stonework outdoor smithy in front of the city, too massive to be kept inside. Drogon stretches his wings in the background and roars, breathing fire into the air. 

A laborer reports to Missandei that the first stonework is completed and the first pile of chains are nearly done being thrown into the cauldron. After the laborer leaves, Tyrion and Missandei walk over to Drogon; Daenerys and Lord Barristan are standing beside him. 

""The first batch is ready, my Queen."" Tyrion states. Daenerys nods, and motions for Drogon and the others to follow her. She stands in front of the small mountain of chains, all that could be fit into the large stone cauldron. She quickly cautions Tyrion, Missandei, and Barristan to step back, before looking up to Drogon.

""Dracarys."" 

A gigantic flame lights the night, as a collection of smiths place a blueprint on a large stone slab. Tyrion, Missandei, Grey Worm, Barristan, and Daenerys stand with the smiths and the camera pans down to the blueprint - it depicts a new Iron Throne. 

The scene ends.

The entire season is just a compilation of bullshit scenes like this one.  Theyre all worn out tropes, lazily  and poorly put together. Not a single scene had half decent dialogue; not a single fucking one. 

It sheds a lot of light on how popular movies/shows begin to operate.

Unlike with Sansa and Cersai shes pretty much naked.

And yet just because she decided to take control of her situation the only way she can given she has no escape or choice and shes too weak to fight Khal Drogo her story is a romance not the story of a rape victim and somehow Khal Drogo is this awesome character that didnt deserve to die.",42,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Game of thrones. First a note  FORGET ABOUT THE IDIOT TV ENDING. Think mostly about the books i. e. the original. What Daenerys really symbolizes. Why she is even in the story. What will be the point of her journey (if Martin ever publish the real ending). Daenerys has actually the most important role in the story (that doesnt mean you have to ruin and neglect every other story in the show which is what DnD made). But WHY? What is the true meaning of Daenerys, what she really symbolizes  it seems this is extremely difficult question. You cannot understand the answer with just one of the books or the seasons. You need the whole story, and by the whole story I mean the story and the meaning of EVERYONE in Westeros too. **Without Tywin, Stanis, Rob Stark, Doran Martel and so on there will be no Daenerys**. 

So, the first part is about the true meaning of westerosian people and their actions, the second is about Daenerys and what is her place of the story.

So. Game of thrones  this is the name of the first book and the name of the TV show. But how exactly you play the game of thrones? Is it about rolling dices, or playing with cards, or something else.

Well, every single kingdom in Westeros represents a great house and very specific, unique way of thinking, unique strategy, unique way to play the game of thrones. That is the meaning of the great houses of Westeros. This is what the whole story is all about. The game of thrones.

***First  the North, the great house of the Starks***. How the Starks play the game? I will call it the family matters method. When the winter comes, the alone wolf will die and the pack will survive. We have to support each other, because we are family. The family is the source of the strength for the Starks. But the Starks lost the game (again, forget the idiot ending, focus to the published books). Rob Stark lost and died. Why, what was the problem for the Starks. Well, what really screw Rob and the Starks is  the family!!! This looks really strange may be but you will see later that it is not strange. That is the point Let see the evidences for my statement:

1. Sansa screwed her own father, because she wanted to be queen. The family screwed the Starks.

2. Katelyn wanted to save Sansa and Arya  her daughters, so she released Jaime Lannister and  that caused big problems to the northerners. The family screwed the Starks.

3. Rob was thinking that his aunt Liza Arin will support them in the war. After all she was one of the reasons for everything with her latter to Katelyn in the beginning and the Vale of Arin doesnt like Lannisters anyway. But she didnt. She had her own plans and ideas. The family screwed the Starks.

4. Rickard Karstark killed two Lannisters boys because he wanted to avenge the death of his own sons. And because of that stupidity Rob had to execute him and this caused problems with the Karstarks. The family screwed the Starks.

5. Robb has married but not for Frey girl. So  the red wedding. The family and the very complicated connections and relations in the family screwed the Starks. It seems that in the game of thrones the family is a source of strength and the source of the weakness at the same time. And because of that Rob was absolutely destined to fail. The Stark method of playing the game sucked. But we have other houses so probably we will find better ideas.

***Second kingdom  The west***. ***The great house of Lannister. Tywin Lannister.*** Tywin symbolizes the brute force, the military method of playing. If you have some doubts  look at the lions, or remember that very specific scene when Cersei said to lord Baelish that Power is power. Tywin create the strongest army in Westeros. Once he talked with Tyrion about that if the members of a great house are not disciplined their house will fail. This is very true if you convert this to the army. So Tywin is the general and his kids are just soldiers and they have to obey their general or the Lannister army will fail. But Tywin failed just like Rob even if he looked so strong. Why, what was the problem? I will mention two things which describe the failure of the military method. 

The first one is the Brotherhood which was created exactly because of Tywins actions and specially the actions of the Mountain (who is another proof that Lannisters symbolize the brute force. It is not a coincidence that The Mounatain is fighting for them and not for another house). The Brotherhood causes problems so  Tywin sent the Mountain to squash the enemies. Einstein probably would say that it is not very wise to expect to solve problems using the same thinking and methods that created that problems. But Tywin symbolizes the brute force and this is his way of playing the game. That doesnt mean he is stupid. He is not stupid. The idea is not to show that the military method is failing because Tywin is an idiot. The idea is to show that the military method will fail even if it is represented in the best possible way.

The second thing we see about Tywins failure is that his children are not exactly soldiers. For them the actions of their father are kind of tyranny so they rebel and finally Tyrion killed his father because he was pissed of his tyranny. But the tyranny is just the opposite side of the brute force method. By the way, I read an interesting theory that Tywin was actually poisoned by Oberin Martel and that is why his corpse was so smelly in his funeral. If this is true we have another proof that the brute force is not the right answer.

***Third kingdom  The Iron islands. The great house of Greyjoy.*** Well, this is pretty easy  we see the fleet method. The see is the source of our strength. We will rely on the fleet. Unfortunately, the ironborns also fail. They failed with conquering the North end we must be sure they will fail with  whatever they aim in the Reach under the rule of Euron. Because they are strong in the seas and that means  they are weak in the land. And you cant win just like that. 

***Fourth kingdom  The Reach. The Tyrels. The Golden roses.*** The idea behind the Tyrels is very interesting. We marry the king. And we seduce him. We tempt him. And later we use the king as source of our strength. But it seems that the Tyrels will fail miserably just like the previous houses. What is the problem? The first bad scenario is when the king just dies. Margery married Renly even though the queen in this case is actually Loras. But Renly died anyway so all the efforts were for nothing. Then Margery has married for Joffrey but he was an asshole. He wasnt what the Tyrels needed so he was killed. And then Margery has married for Tommen. He was the best option. 10 years old boy. How he can resist to Margery. And he admired sir Loras also. So the King was in their hands. But  you cannot expect that every Lannister will be seduced. You create your natural enemies like Cersei. Cersei was stupid enough to cause problems like always and also the ironborns attacked the Reach. At this moment the Tyrels really, really needed the support of their king. But the king is  10 years old boy. He wants to help but he doesnt know how. So you have to deal with Cersei. Congratulations Loras, Margery. You are screwed! 

***The fifth kingdom  The Storm lands. The Baratheons. Stannis.*** What is the source of strength for Stannis  the law. He is the rightful heir of Robert. It is duty for every single one lord of Westeros to support their true king which is Stannis. We have to expect that because of the fact Stannis is the rightful heir of Robert he must be the strongest player. He must have the biggest support of all the players. Well, just no. It was absolutely the opposite. It seems that in the game of thrones the laws are not what it is supposed to be. The words are wind. This is so true when some lord is speaking. In Westeros when a lord speaks about duty, moral, laws, justice  you can be almost sure that it is about the opposite. Actually he just tries to justify his actions which are pure dishonesty, immorality, lawlessness or injustice. At least this is what is shown to us for five books and in the beginning of the TV show. This was before the knights of the Vale to help Sansa  just like that, because they are so good people. That was the beginning of the incredible stupidity of the serial. In the books it is shown that from the wall to the Dorne is full with schemers. Including the North. Sansa herself was scheming when she betrayed her father (not that she was aiming it). Lord Karstark disobeyed his own king because of  what. You must not disobey your king. There is no excuse for what he did. And let not even mention Lord Bolton or Arnolf Karstark who will try to fuck Stannis in very dishonorable way and so on. It is full with shenanigans everywhere and that is the reason why to be the rightful heir is not so special in Westeros. And because of that Stannis is absolutely destined to fail.

***Sixth kingdom  Dorne.*** There are two subjects to discuss here  ***The Sand snakes and Doran.*** First are the snakes. They are obsessed with the revenge. The problem with the revenge is shown with a scene in the books when Ellaria Sand spoke with the Snakes and Doran. She said that Tywin, Robert Baratheon, Amory Lorch and the Mountain are already dead. So why the Snakes speaks about the revenge. Where will be the end of this  madness. And that is the point. The revenge is something that can be used also against you. In the TV show Myrcella was poisoned for the revenge and  TV Ellaria had to see how her daughter dies from poison.

Enough with the Sand Snakes nonsense. Lets talk about ***Doran. Book Doran.*** What is his idea. I will call it game safe. Doran doesnt start games he cannot win. He plays only these games that he will win for sure. A part of his motivation is that it is very easy to start a war but the children and the innocents will pay the price of his mistakes. So he acts in the shadows in a secrecy pretending that he is the most loyal vassal in Westeros. Sometimes it seems that he humiliates Dorne because of that. But at the same time he tries to bring all he need for 100 % granted victory. So when he finally reveals his true colour he will win in one move. 

But Doran and his idea will fail miserably just like the others. What is wrong with his idea? I will say that first there is no such thing as 100 % granted victory. Anyway, his idea actually makes Dorans options very limited. He always has to refuse some options because they are not safe enough. And second, he tries something that doesnt sound stupid but in reality it turns out to be so complicated that anyway something will go wrong and the idea will fail. In the books he sends his son Quentin to Meereen to find Daenerys and her dragons and marry her. Then bring back to Dorne and with her help and with the help of her dragons Dorne will get the true victory. The enemies will be smashed. It is easy to predict the difficulties about the very long journey to Meereen. Only 6 people start from Dorne (we need secrecy after all) and only 3 reach to Daenerys. But anyway they succeeded. That difficulty was predicted and Quentin somehow passed through it. What he couldnt predict was that he will arrive in the most inappropriate moment. Daenerys had to marry  to Hizdahr to bring peace for her city. And shortly after that she disappeared on the back of Drogon. That is the main idea of Dorans failure. For being safe enough his plans are so complicated that 100 % sure something will go wrong. Quentin couldnt marry missing Daenerys. And he couldnt go back to Dorne because that would be a big humiliation for him. His father trusted him. Three good men died so he can reach Meereen. He has to succeed because the whole Dorne needs his success. There is only one option and that was to try to steal the dragons. And of course this was a bad investment. He failed miserably with this incredible difficult task and died. Many people complain why Quentin was put in the books. He was so useless. No. Quentin was very important because he symbolizes the failure of Dorans idea of playing the game. Safety enough means too complicated, impossible in practice. You will not bring victory this way.

***Seventh kingdom. The Vale of Arin.*** Here we have to change the main house with another because obviously Liza and Robert Arin are not appropriate for anything. But we still have a player which we can say represents the Vale and 7th unique way of playing the game. ***Lord Baelish.*** He originated from the Vale and it seems that the Vale has central role in his big plans. The idea of lord Baelish is to reach the Iron throne with manipulations. The knowledge is power. You have to know everything about everyone. What every single lord in Westeros wants, what fears, how thinks. How you can seduce him. Obviously he will fail. The problem is that he didnt failed in the books yet and in the serial the Vale was absolutely destroyed and converted to nothing. Just stupid plot devise so Sansa to achieve miraculous illogical victory in the North. The song of ice and fire is the story about the seven kingdoms. And every single kingdom is as equally important as the others. This is not the story of the Starks, Lannisters and Daenerys. But DnD obviously didnt understood that. And by the way this is the reason I believe why Martin has said that the serial needed more seasons. Not because we need more time for the incredibly idiotic idea of Daenerys going crazy in the end so let Bran be the king. It is because you need to show every kingdom. Dorne needs more time. Stormlands (and Aegon VI) needs time. The Reach and the ironborns need time. And the Vale needs much more time. 

So we are some kind of blind but lets try to use the logic of the previous failures. Baelish HAS TO fail and this has to be natural. Not forced, not a coincidence. Not because of Bran can see everything. Here is what I think (may be) is the real failure of Baelish. 

With manipulations you really can achieve some successes but you cannot hide forever the absolute lack of any REAL military strength behind you. And you will have problems sooner or later which cannot be solved just by manipulations of the other people. So what probably will happen. Lord Baelish has some successes but he reaches a point when he cannot manipulate the enemy. There has to be a battle. It is the only way. Baelish will try to bypass the problem without battle but all of his attempts will fail. His army I believe will not be smaller than the enemys army. May be even he will have some little advantage. But military method  it is just not the way of lord Baelish. He is not a general. This is not what he can. So he will lose the battle. And first defeat will be his end. Because everything he has built will crush. His men werent actually his men. They joined him because of his manipulations but werent his men. His first defeat is the poison which will destroy his project. And that is the reason why he is also destined to fail. If the first defeat means the end for you then how to win the game. At some point every single one has to have some defeat. It is unnatural to be always victorious. 

And that is the reason why I believe that Sansa queen in the north is absolutely hilarious stupidity. Sansa resembles Baelish not the Starks. If his failure is absolutely destined, then why she would succeed. Now look carefully Sansa. You can say that she is very different from Baelish because she has something he hasnt  she has a name. She is a Stark. But how important is actually this fact. In the end of the story the remaining Staks have nothing. All their men were slatted. Jorry Cassel is dead, master Luwin is dead. Sir Rodrick is dead. All the knights of the Starks are dead. Their lands were devastated. Winterfell is in ruins. So Sansa is in the same condition as lord Baelish  There is no real strength behind her (Accept for Brienne). And there are so many problems with the North. The problems with the remaining wildlings. After the defeat of the NK all the northerners will remember that they hate very much the wildlings, because that is how the real world works. Lord Glover has to be punished because he disobeyed the commands of his lords. The lands of the Boltons has no heir  all of them are already dead. I suggest that at least half of the survived northern lords are looking to these lands with very greedy eyes. The Umbers are also dead and so are the Mormonts. There is only one (may be) survived member of the Karstarks and that is 16 years old girl. And every single northern lord knows exactly that behind Sansa are only the ruins of Winterfell. The North is already fucked. And lets not forget that on the top of that Sansa is a woman not a man. Or when we discuss that Jon has a dick it is so important that Daenerys doesnt have, but in Sansas case everything is fine? Wriiiiiite. 

Anyway 7 kingdoms  7 methods  7 failures. But it seems that Westeros is really big and there are other ideas of how we can play the game. So we have some additional work.

***Riverlands. The unofficial 8th kingdom.*** We have a great house from there which we can say represents another idea. ***House Frey, Lord Walder Frey.*** And we connect Frey with the red wedding of course. Treachery, fraud, deceit. You gather your enemies and kill them all when no one of them expect that. The problem with the Freys idea is that this gives you strength only in the beginning. And after that it seems everyone else is free to do the same with you. Which we see in the end of the third book with lady Stoneheart and Meret Frey and also with Arya in the beginning of the 7th season. Even though we can ask ourselves, was it properly done. Anyway, it seems the Frays idea is doomed.

***The Wall.*** Here we have two kind of subjects  ***the wildlings and the Black brotherhood.*** We know that the wildlings choose their leader and follow him. And the same is true for the black brothers. They choose their lord commander and follow him. Probably the most of you will say OK we found the obvious winner of the GoT. The democracy method. But I am not so convinced that this is really true. There is something so wrong with GoT that even this method seemed to me doomed. Lord commander Mormont led his people outside of the Wall to see what is happening. The brothers were defeated and not many survivors reached the home of Kraster. The lord commander said to respect Kraster, his rules and so on. But in the end Lord commander Mormont was killed by his own brothers. Anyway, the brothers somehow survived and even chose new lord commander  Jon. Jon is not an idiot in the books and understood how bad the situation was. The times were really difficult. And he gave many orders because now he is the leader. But the entire time he had to explain to the whining bitches around him why we have to do this and that. All the time. Explanation after explanation even if he is the lord commander and dont have to explain his  orders. Finally, he was also killed. So here is the problem. The democracy method can work only when you respect the choice that was made. No matter if you like it or not. At the moment when the shenanigans start after the order was made just because you dont like it  you have started the game of thrones and it seems the game kills the democracy method. I see only one survived black brother in the end. And that has to mean something. 

***Kings Landing.*** I think we have a player who represent the Kings Landing and another  10th idea of playing the game. This player is the ***High sparrow.*** We are many and you are little. We are replaceable you are not. It is time for the justice to arrive for the poor who suffered too much and for too long because of the rich lords. The High sparrow was killed in the TV serial by Cersei and all the sparrows just disappeared. This is another example of ruined story in the serial. They were too many they cannot just disappear. But I believe that probably killing the High sparrow will ruin his idea. Because it is true that the small sparrows are replaceable. But this is not true for the High Sparrow. Without him I believe we have to see many small groups of sparrows over all of Westeros but they will not be unified by anything now. They are just too different. So they will cause some problems but the possibility of gaining victory will be dead for the little sparrows. 10th failure.

***Mellisandre.*** We are finished with the territory of Westeros but we still have players. Mellisandre represent the god idea method. We have to stand behind the chosen from the gods. The problem here is that the world is just very complicated and the divine will is maybe even more complicated. And this method can work properly only if you predict correctly the god intentions. And when you fail 

***Ramsey Bolton.*** Another northerner after the Starks. He is relying on the fear. Torturing the others is his way of playing the game. But sometimes your victims overcome the fear and rebel. Fake Arya in the books escapes from Ramsey and probably this will lead somehow to absolutely destined failure of him. 12th failure.

And the last one in Westeros. ***Varis the Spider.*** By the way, another complete disaster in the serial. Here is what I think Varys represents. He wants the throne for himself. But he is a eunuch so it cannot happen. That is why he chooses a pretender and supports him. But not just that. The aim is Varys 2 to be putted on the throne. After all we have to put the rightful ruler on the throne and the only rightful ruler is Varys of course. Or at least he thinks like that. So who is Varys 2? In the serial Varys 2 is Daenerys so he supports her. Probably at some point in the books also he will support Daenerys. But unfortunately she in not Varys 2. The last time I saw Daenerys she wasnt very fat bald eunuch. And she never was. So what Varys will do. Of course it is time for another treachery. It seems that Jon is actually Varys 2 so he has to be putted on the throne. And here we see the problem with Varyss idea. He will never find actually Varys 2. I think that if he succeeds to put Jon on the throne very soon he will be disappointed again. And will start another treason, to put  Sansa for example on the throne. But even if he succeeds  Well Sansa is not Varys 2 also. This can end only in one way  Varys will be killed because of his countless treasons by one of the players. May be one of his previous choices. 

So 13 methods, 13 ideas, 13 failures. **Now it is the promised time for Daenerys.** What she symbolizes, what is her method of playing the game of thrones? First, very important note: Yes, Daenerys has dragons. They are so powerful interesting and so on. But you have to forget about them to really understand Daenerys. 

So, in the beginning Daenerys is a pure pawn of Lord Varys who wants to marry her to Drogo. So if she represents something in the beginning it is the idea of Varys but I will agree that because she is a pawn may be we dont have to rush with the conclusions.

Daenerys married to Drogo. At some point she accepted that fact and chose that she will fight. She will fight for herself and for what she believes and will never allow to the despair to consume her. So she accepted Drogo, seduce him, she earned his heart. And very (un)expectedly she gained influence. I mean the dothraki respect their horses more than women but somehow Daenerys could save some people, give actual order and so on. But this is Tyrels idea. Everything the Tyrels have ever done was also done by Daenerys much before the end of the first book. We even saw the failure of the Tyrels idea because Drogo died (stupid infection) and Daenerys of course lost everything. Which was the same with the death of Renly. 

So what was next. Maybe marrying another khal? Actually Daenerys burned the corpse of Drogo alongside with her son Rhaego, the horse of Drogo and Miiri maz Duur. In the middle of the ceremony she also entered the fire where were the dragon eggs. In the morning Daenerys was alright and we had three little dragons on her. Every single one of the remaining dothraki including her three blood riders and her private servants  around 100 people and Sir Jorah kneeled to Daenerys. Because they saw the chosen one of the gods. But this is no more Tyrelish. This is actually the idea of Melisandre. Second idea in the game of thrones in one person.

And the dragons. OK. Lets think now about the dragons and again forget about them after that. What the dragons represent? They are her children, her only family. We can suggest that she will never abandon her dragons and they will be always there if she is in mortal danger. Because if the winter comes the lone dragon will die and the pack will survive

Yes! That is my point. The dragons symbolize THE STARK IDEA OF PLAYING THE GAME. The Stark Idea on DAENERYS. That is why their names are Viserion, Rhaegal and Drogon  her brothers and her husband. And we even can see the problems in the Stark idea too. When Drogon baked that girl it seemed that Daenerys wasnt expected that and wasnt happy. Sometimes the family causes problems.

So till the end of the first book Daenerys symbolizes three very different ideas of playing the Game. And that is only the beginning. Because Daenerys represents every single idea of playing the game of thrones. Every single strength. 

The next step in Daeneryss journey was Kart. The Kart story was completely different in the serial but anyway we can add two more things. It was mentioned that one day Daenerys will return to Westeros and will bring her revenge which remind us of the Sand snakes and their revenge. The other one is the fact that Daenerys was the rightful heir on the iron throne, which reminds us to Stanniss idea. 

The next one was Astapor. Here Daenerys had very difficult task because she wanted to buy an army but she had a lack of a money. So what exactly she did. She brought all of the Good masters of Astapor  and destroy them in the same time when no one of them expected that. Which is Walder Freys idea. Really look the Red wedding and after that the victory of Daenerys in Astapor. They resemble with each other so strong. Of course there is a big difference between these two scenes. Daenerys is not Walder Frey, she only used his idea  the deceit. Walder Frey was a disgusting man. And in Daeneryss case the Good Master of Astapor were disgusting. So the cases are not the same. But the method is the same.

After that Daenerys stood in front of the unsullied and gave them freedom. After that she asked them if they join her and fight for their queen as free men. And just like the wildlings choose their leader, just like the black brothers choose their lord commander, the unsullied chose Daenerys as their queen. And Missandei also chose Daenerys. The democratic idea confirmed. And also of course the unsullied symbolize the brute force, the military method of Tywin. Because that is what they are  strong army. 

Lets make some short resume. Daenerys is  

Daenerys - the most beautiful women in the world (Tyrel),

Daenerys the Unburnt (Mellisandre),

Daenerys the Mother of dragons (Stark),

Daenerys the Avenger (Sand snakes),

Daenerys the Rightful heir on the iron throne, Rightful queen on the Andals, Rhoynars and the First men, Protector of the seven kingdoms (Stannis),

Daenerys the Cheater (Lord Frey),

Daenerys  the Queen we chose (democracy method),

Daenerys the Conqueror (Tywin).

8 ideas until now. After Astapor was Yunkai. As usual the serial changed the story and this way Daenerys was dumbed by DnD. That is why I will follow the books. What Daenerys did in Yunkai campaign is that she really, really  manipulated the wise masters of Yunkai and their armies. Welcome to this side of the Narrow sea  lord Baelish. Because that is really what Daenerys did in short description here. But again, an important note. In Westeros the manipulations and schemes of Baelish were followed  by another manipulations and schemes. Here Daenerys manipulated (Baelish) the enemies so her army (Tywin) to earn the easiest victory possible. I. e. she combined two methods at the same time. And we can even add a small Tyrel influence because she seduced Daario and earned his heart. So  Daenerys the Manipulator.

After that was Meereen. Here Daenerys used the idea of the High Sparrow  we are many and they are little. It is time for justice to be served. So she inspired a slave rebellion which again helped her army (Tywin) to enter the city. Daenerys the Breaker of chains.

After that we had many scenes of Meereen. I will mention some of them. First she executed 163 masters. That was the justice in Stanniss way. Remember, the bad thing cannot be forgotten or washed away. Sir Davos had to pay because of his crimes in the past. Even if he must be awarded also because of the good things he did. So Stannis should execute masters too. Also we can see the scene when Rob Stark shouted to lord Karstark They were boys. Look this very specific scene and then look the execution of the masters. 

Of course we have to mention that again, the serial fucked the scene in comparison with the books making Daenerys dumber than in the books. It is not sign for madness. It is just sign for Stannis or even Rob if you prefer it this way. After all Daenerys represents everyone from Westeros.

The next scene is very complicated. It is about the decision to stay in Meereen. What were the arguments for this decision. One of the arguments was that it is very easy for Daenerys to leave Meereen but then the innocent people of Meereen will pay the price of her game of thrones. And she is not OK with it. That remind us to the conversations of Doran with Arianne. Another one was that Daenerys is the queen but what exactly means that thing? She wasnt prepared by masters or her father, mother and so on. So maybe it is better to stay in Meereen and to learn what means to be a queen. And when she is finally ready than she will go to Westeros. When she is ready. This also reminds me of Doran and his motivations. So now we have Daenerys  the queen of Meereen, which represents Doran.

After that is some very interesting scene in the serial. There wasnt such scene in the books but  surprise, this time it fits and isnt just stupidity. It is the scene after killing of Barristan (which is an example of stupid change). She feeded her dragons with one meereenese. Now. Imagine the same scene. But not with the voice of Daenerys. Imagine the voice of Ramsey: Well, lets not overfeed them. Maybe another time. Come Reek. Daenerys the Inquisitor.

Finally, Daenerys is on the back of Drogon (Stark) who carried her far away from Meereen. Here we exit the books. We have only the serial at least to the point the scenario still has some sense. Daenerys met with khal Moro(n). And she told him she is a queen (Stannis). But that didnt work. No idea why! Ha-ha just a little kidding. 

So she did something incredible. Something no one in Westeros does. She changed the method. Now she gathered all the Khals and their blood riders and  burned them all when they didnt expect anything. With that she exceeded lord Frey. I mean he used his method just for once. And Daenerys did it for the second time. After that she exit from the fires and this time not the miserable remains of Drogos Knalasar but all the dothraki saw the Chosen of the gods and kneeled. But probably this wasnt enough so she leaded them to the Mother of the mountains and  spoke to them on the back of Drogon (Stark). Her speech was following the golden rule of  Baelish. The knowledge is power. Daenerys knew everything for the dothraki. She knew what she has to say and what she has to do so to make them all absolutely loyal to her. In fact you cannot lead the dothraki without the Baelishs method. So I think that The Khaleesi of all the dothraki in the great grass sea represents lord Baelishs method. And what is the strangest: it represents him in very good, not scheming, evil minded way. There is no actual scheme in this. But you really cannot rule the dothraki if you dont know them.

With the Dothraki (strong army - Tywin) and Dragons (Stark) she returns to Meereen and smashed her enemies. She granted the peace of Meereen. And gain big fleet of the ships from Volantis, Kart and Yunkai. And very soon she joined Theon and Yara to the list of her allies. So now she had a huge fleet (Greyjoy way). What in her titles represents the connection with the fleet? Difficult question. Let me try this one: Daenerys Stormborn. We know that that the STORM god is the enemy of the drowned god for the ironborns. So may be this Stormborn symbolizes the Greyjoy side of Daeneryss force. 

Finaly, Daenerys is not the pawn for lord Varys. Now she is his queen. So she represents Varyss idea also. And he even negotiates with the Tyrels and with Dorne so they joined Daenerys also. Now she represents (or it seemed like that) fully the idea of Doran. She has 100 % granted victory. Her force is so huge.

At the end of the 6th season Daenerys symbolizes the STRONGEST EVER player in the Game of Thrones and in Westeros history. The strongest player we can even imagine. Because who (human) could be stronger then Daenerys and how? She represents every single idea, every source of strength. What could go wrong? ... Or? ... May be ...",0,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

I just attended a Game of Thrones Panel to hype up the Blue ray release.  [https://whatson.bfi.org.uk/Online/default.asp?BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::permalink=gameofthronesacelebration&amp;BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::context\_id=](https://whatson.bfi.org.uk/Online/default.asp?BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::permalink=gameofthronesacelebration&amp;BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::context_id=)

&amp;#x200B;

A few notes/comments from the panel that went about 80 minutes long. Screened some of the never before see clips (inc Sansa/Tyrion fighting in the crypt scenes). Made some notes from what I remember/Q and A (imagine there will be more articles on this in the coming days though, cast were VERY honest)

&amp;#x200B;

**Gemma Whelan (Yara)**

&amp;#x200B;

* Euron was fun to work with
* Didnt like Yara's ending (she had no closure)
* Liked the action scenes
* Wanted to be in the battle of winterfell, pushed hard but was never given an answer
* Didnt really speak to the showrunners about her character direction during her years, frustrated
* Related to the fans feedback at the end and understood it
* frustrated with lack of female/poc in the creative team

&amp;#x200B;

**Isaac (Bran)**

&amp;#x200B;

* Hodor scene blew his mind
* Enjoyed the journey of him as a person during the show
* Actors he worked with were all amazing
* Wanted more flashbacks
* Laughed that NK died so early, wasted his story with the WW.
* Felt his powers ultimately ""meant nothing""
* Thought the first script for the finale was a joke
* Didnt like the petition but accepted the last season was disappointing, cast felt this as shooting wrapped
* Weiss and Benioff were quite demanding in early seasons, felt like they werent happy with his acting

&amp;#x200B;

**Kristofer (Tormund)**

&amp;#x200B;

* Loved how his character progressed
* Sad his last scene with Brienne was cut
* Said the wildlings going north at the end didnt make sense
* Didnt see D and D at all in season 8. Wanted more character input.
* The long night was gruelling, too much strain was put on everyone
* Wants a ghost/tormund spinoff!
* Last season was rushed, wanted to do more seasons",0,1,False,self,,,,,

I think most are in agreement that the final season of Game of Thrones struggled to provide satisfying resolution to many of the disparate plot lines. Many elements and themes set up throughout the previous seasons seemed to amount to nothing and elements such as Daenerys madness were introduced and concluded far too fast to feel like nature developments. I thought it would be an interesting exercise to write out how I best feel that season 8 could have tied up the disparate story threads based on the previous seven seasons of the show. As there were elements that did occur that I did not expect but found to be perfect within the narrative, I have included those moments and am treating this as if I was a member of the writers team that brought forward those ideas.

That being said, there were elements of the final season that did in fact seem to be natural conclusions to the characters story arcs (Theon dying defending Bran, Jamie knighting Brienne) that I feel, when reworked within the larger narrative, provide fantastic closure. Alternatively, developments such as Danys madness that were not properly set up in the previous seven seasons must be reworked to fit her narrative as given to the audience thus far. That being said, two caveats are in order. First off, the final season is a full ten episodes. Secondly, while I am accepting season 7 as canon, two things that ended the season would be shifted to season 8: Littlefinger is taken into custody but not executed and Theon does not immediately leave to save Yara, but shuttles the Northern armies back to White Harbor. The fact that Littlefinger is executed less than twenty screen minutes before he would be reunited with Varys is a tragedy.

**Summary**

**Episode 1 (Winterfell)**

The season begins with a cold open at a campfire on a hill. Tormund, Beric, and the remaining survivors of Eastwatch are fleeing the army of the dead and think they have finally created separation. They are attacked by wights and, before they are overwhelmed, are saved by Edd and the remaining members of the Nights Watch, who have been summoned to Winterfell. They continue forward, as the camera zooms up to reveal the army of the dead stretching out across the North.

Dany and Jon arrive at Winterfell with their armies. Arya watches the procession. Upon arrival in the courtyard, Sansa coolly presents Winterfell to Dany and Bran reveals the Army of the Dead has passed the wall. Ravens are sent to call all banner-men and civilians to Winterfell. Varys visits Littlefinger in his cell, and tells him that he could free him but he wont. Varys says that chaos isnt ladder after all and that he will miss their talks. Jon and Arya reunite in the godswood.

In the courtyard, Brianne and Pod train while Tyrion and Sansa discuss their sham-marriage. Sam is visited in the library by Dany and Jorah. As a reward for saving Jorah, Dany restore Sam as a Tarly. In doing so, she reveals she executed his family. Sam is distraught. As the castle is prepared for battle, Gendry heads up the forge. Arya reconnects with Gendry and the Hound. Bran is introduced to Howland Reed, who arrives with Meera, answering the call to protect Winterfell. He shakes hands with Jon and gives him a curious, knowing look.

On the Blackwater, Euron has reached Kings Landing. He has Yara chained and she asks why he doesnt just kill her. He says he has a plan for her and her queen. In the Throne Room, Euron introduces Harry Strickland, commander of the Golden Company, to Cersei. Euron and Cersei go to bed. Qyburn enlists Bronn to kill the Queens brothers.

Littlefinger is brought before the leaders and his crimes revealed to all. After hearing the evidence Tyrion points out that the entire War of the Five Kings was because of Littlefingers ambition. Dany defers to the Warden of the North for his judgement. Jon looks to Sansa. She nods and Jon sentences Peter Baelish to death. Dany proposes dragon fire, but Jon, mirroring the first episode, is determined that the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword. He executes Littlefinger where Ned Stark executed the Nights Watch deserter.

After the execution Sam and Bran come to Jon in his room. Jon asks Bran if he remembers the day their father executed the deserter. Bran says that he does and says that Jons father was not present that day. Together Sam and Bran reveal his identity as the trueborn son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark. Bran tells him that he is the heir to the Iron Throne. Sam tells Jon what Dany did to his family for refusing to bend the knee, and tells him that she will not take kindly to a challenger. A shaken Jon retreats to the godswood and tells Sam to send for Sansa and Arya. Sam wheels Bran outside to the courtyard where Bran tells him to leave him. The episode ends with Jamies arrival to Winterfell. He locks eyes with Bran and the episode ends.

**Episode 2 (A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms)**

The episode begins in the godswood with Jon revealing his heritage to Arya and Sansa. They both tell him that regardless of his blood he is their brother and the son of Ned Stark. Sansa immediately realizes he is the heir to the throne and moves to discuss the topic but they are interrupted by the announcement that Jamie Lannister has been captured.

Jamie is put on trial in the great hall. He claims that his crimes were committed for his family and that he has realized the error of his ways. He has come of his own free will to fight for the living and reveals that Cersei has refused to send the promised aid. He is defended by Brienne, who reveals that he commanded her to protect the Stark girls to honor Catelyn, bloodlessly ended the siege of Riverrun, and has proven himself to be a man of honor. Dany wants to put him to death for charging her on the battlefield and for killing her father. Bran reveals why he killed the mad king in front of all and claims that they will need Jamie for what is to come. Dany begrudgingly releases Jamie. Dany scolds Tyrion and questions his loyalty for trusting his sister.

In the courtyard, Jamie thanks Bran and asks why he didnt reveal that it was he who pushed him from the tower. Bran says that he has a part to play in the war to come. Jamie asks to fight under Briannes command and she accepts. Tyrion and Jamie discuss his toxic love for Cersei in spite of what he knows her to be. The Hound approaches Sansa and they discuss how far she has come since he left her during the siege of Kings Landing. He tells her she isnt a little bird anymore. Edd, Tormound, Beric and the Nights Watch arrive, bringing the news that the Army of the Dead is two days behind them.

A war council is called. Jon evades Danys eye throughout. Bran reveals that the legendary Bran the Builder who raised the wall was actually himself going into the past to hold off the white walkers as long as he could. During the meeting, Sansa feels that Dany is more willing to sacrifice northern lives than her own and they quarrel. Jon is visibly upset about their animosity. A plan is developed. Varys, Missandei, and Sansa will oversee the evacuation of Bran and all the civilians, including Gilly, to Theons ships at White Harbor. They will be protected by the Army of the Vale and the men of the Neck (the Reeds). After the meeting Dany tries to speak to Sansa, but Sansa tells her that she is not her queen, infuriating Dany.

The civilians are evacuated. Night falls. Arya speaks to Beric and the Hound on the wall before hooking up with Gendry. Sam gives Jorah Heartsbane. Edd, Jon, and Sam begin their watch on the wall. Jamie sits around the fire with Tormound, Davos, Brienne, Pod, and Tyrion; they drink and laugh on their last night on earth. Tormund tries to impress Brienne and Jamie knights her. Pod sings as a montage plays showing Jorah and Grey Worm preparing, Edd and Same upon the wall, Jon entering the crypts, and Arya lying beside Gendry. Dany finds Jon in the crypts in front of a tomb. She asks whos tomb it is he says Lyanna Stark. She says that she is the woman her brother kidnapped and lost the kingdom for. As Jon is about to answer, they are interrupted by horns and the episode ends with the White Walkers arriving at Winterfell.

**Episode 3 (The Long Night)**

The battle of Winterfell takes place. They remain inside the walls and use proper military tactics, firing from the walls with catapults and with flaming arrows. Dany flies Drogon and burns moats that they dug so that the dead are confined and funneled into smaller factions. The winter storm arrives and Dany is neutralized, being forced above the storm before she can reach the walkers. The Dothraki attack from the flanks and have success keeping the dead within the flames. Ultimately, through strength of numbers, the dead manage to scale the wall. The Nights Watch defends the wall. Edd is killed by a wight and Sam retreats to the great hall.

The Wildling and Northern armies, led by Brianne, defend the godswood. Brienne battles the first White Walker to scale the wall and is knocked to the ground. Jamie cant reach her but she is saved from death by Podrick. He manages to kill the Walker and provides validation for her training sessions. Also in the godswood, Arya freezes when she is face to face with a wight Hodor. Beric sacrifices himself for Arya and she manages to put down Hodor. In the courtyard, defended by the Unsullied, a giant breaks down the gate. Grey Worm manages to kill it and they hold the courtyard. The waves continue to pound against the heroes, although with their strategy and phalanx formations they suffer limited casualties.

Jon, overseeing everything from the tower with Tyrion, grows restless. Suddenly, Ghost begins to howl and Jon follows him down and to the entrance of the crypts, from which he hears the sound of the dead. Realizing that the Stark dead have been raised, He enters the crypt to take them out before they are killed from behind. Jon manages to take out the dead in the crypts; however, he is slashed across the stomach by the last wight, a woman. Ghost manages to kill it but Jon is badly wounded. He manages to climb on Ghosts back. Ghost disappears deeper into the crypts.

Meanwhile, Dany, riding Drogon, manages to break through the storm and burn the line of White Walkers as they approach Winterfell. The army of the dead falls. The heroes have suffer very few causalities overall. Dany then sees the Night King standing alone in the middle of the field. She flies to him and Drogon blasts him with dragon fire. As the smoke clears, the Night King is still standing and smiling. Inside the castle they think theyve won, but when Dany lands she is shaken and says they have to retreat now. Suddenly, the bulk of the army of the dead appears on the horizon. Dany immediately orders the remaining unsullied and Dothraki to retreat to White Harbor on the Dothrraki. Tyrion climbs atop Rhaegal to safety. Davos, Tormund, the Hound, Jamie, Brienne, Pod, and Sam retreat with the Wildling and Northern armies. Arya helps a wounded Gendry onto a horse and to safety.

As the retreat begins, Jorah Mormont has not moved. He demands Lyanna Mormont retreat for the sake of their house, says goodbye to Dany and vows he will not flee the north in shame again (quoting his house words here I stand). He mans the walls of Winterfell with the remaining members of the Nights Watch to protect the retreat. Dany names Jorah her Lord Commander of the final Nights Watch. The episode ends with Drogon taking to the air. As he does so, the dead around Winterfell rise as one. Dany flies off, looking back and crying as she flys away. As seen from the air, the dead swarm the walls of Winterfell as the castle collapses.

**Episode 4 (The Heir to the Iron Throne)**

The episode begins by showing Ghost emerge from the hidden entrance to the crypts outside Winterfell. Ghost falls in line with the retreating armies and, when they finally stop to rest, someone recognizes Jon. Dany takes Jon on Drogon and flies him to White Harbor, where Sam works to clean his injuries and save his life. He comments that Jon will carry the pain from this wound all his days but should live. The armies reach White Harbor and the ships set sail towards Dragonstone.

On board one of the main ships Arya, Gendry, and the Hound talk about Berics sacrifice. The Hound says that maybe there is a Lord of light and he has a plan for Arya yet. She says its not the lord of light but the many-faced god. The Hound is visibly disturbed by her response and tells her that shes not who she thinks she is. Jamie and Brienne find themselves alone in Jamies chamber and, for a moment both contemplate what their relationship might be like romantically. This passes almost immediately and they acknowledge that it is not to be. Tyrion and Davos speak on the deck of the head ship about potentially marrying Jon and Dany to consolidate the Northern support and Danys rule. Sansa speaks to Theon and asks him how he determines what the right thing to do is. He says that he is not the right person for her to answer that question and she says he is, because even when he acted wrong he knew what was truly right. The camera cuts away as she reveals Jons true heritage to Theon.

Meanwhile, Jon, fading in and out of consciousness, reveals to Dany that his mother was the one who stabbed him. She is stunned and asks him what he means by it and Jon says reveals his true identity to her before fading back out of consciousness. She deliberates considers killing him then and there, her hand on the knife by his bedside, but overcomes the temptation. Varys, who has always known Jons true identity, sees her deliberating through the doorway.

The rest of the episode shifts the focus to Kings Landing. Qyburn receives a raven and informs Cersei that the army of the dead won at Winterfell. Cersei tells Qyburn to set the wildfire stores in the tunnels around the city and to begin moving civilians into the Red Keep as human shields. Qyburn meets with Harry Strickland, grilling him over his loyalties and revealing that the Golden Company originally were loyalists to the Blackfyre Targaryens. When Qyburn implies that they might abandon Cersei for a Targaryen queen, Strickland assures him they will never break a contract.

Having pleased Qyburn, Captain Strickland meets with Cersei in her private chambers, making Euron jealous. The two discuss Harrys past over wine; Harry says he was born in exile and will gladly defend Cersei in exchange for Highgarden. Euron begins to suspect that the child is not his, confiding to the imprisoned Yara that the Queens usefulness is running its course. The next morning, Cersei suffers a miscarriage and doesnt tell Euron

Finally, we see Bronn, heading north and having heard no news, reach the Twins and see the site of a massacre. He sees the Riverlands army, led by Edmure Tully retreating, having destroyed the bridge behind them. Edmure tells him that they are retreating to Kings Landing and he falls in line with them. The episode ends as the bodies around the Twins rise to join the army of the dead.

**Episode 5 (The Golden Company)**

The ships arrive at Dragonstone and the civilians are shuttled onto the island. Melisandre is waiting on the beach. She says that she has returned from Volantis to bring light to the war for dawn. Davos wants to execute her but Dany refuses, saying that she was instrumental in bringing her and Jon together. Jon is shocked, and tells her that he promised to execute her for the murder of Shireen Baratheon if she ever came to them again. Brienne says that she still must be held accountable for the murder of Renly. Dany says that she is their ally and will not have her executed. Davos and Brienne are angry and storm off. She tells Jon that he needs to remind his people that she is the one true queen and that there are consequences for disloyalty, disturbing Sansa and Jon. She enters the map room and confides to Missandei that she has begun to feel her support drifting away. Missandei says the people will follow her because they love her. She tells Missandei that the people of Westeros see her as a foreign invader and have no love for her. Dany tells Varys and Tryion that they need to take Kings Landing. Varys says that his network of little birds is up again and on it.

Grey Worm spends time with Missandei. He asks her what she wants to do once the war is over. She says she would love to return to Narth once more. He says that one the war is over, he will ask his queens permission to go around the world and free slaves in her name. He asks if Missandei will join him. Meanwhile, Sam and Gilly spend time together while Sam reads. He feels guilty that he couldnt save Edd, and mourns that he has lost both of his families. Hand on her stomach, she says that they are building a new family together, and Sam is overjoyed.

Melisandre approaches Bran and asks him what gods he believes in. Bran says that what the North called the old gods was actually the Three-eyed Raven. She asks what his purpose is. He says that he holds the memory of the world and thus, humanity. She asks what he can see in her past and his says hes seen it all. She says every mistake she made was because she misinterpreted the lord of lights commands. She asks if he can see the future and he says that he has. He admits that he knew they would fail at Winterfell. When she asks about whats after the next battle, he asks how she know that there is an after; he reveals that he cant see anything beyond Kings Landing.

Varys uses his birds to organize a midnight meeting with the Golden Company on the beaches of Dragonstone. Tyrion tries to convince them to abandon Cersei and fight with them against the dead. Captain Strickland says that they would prefer a Targaryen, but they have never broken a contract and will fight for Cersei. He reveals that Cersei knows that they were meeting and that Lord Varys birds are talking from both sides of their mouth, implying why Cersei was always a step ahead during season 7. Tyrion pleads with Strickland that they will all die if they do not stop the dead and says that they do not need to be Cerseis enemies if Cersei will surrender the castle. Dany interrupts and says that Cersei has made her choice and will be burned alive. She tells Harry Strickland that they will all burn as well if they stand in her way and returns to the castle. Tyrion, Jon, Davos, and Varys are visibly disturbed. As a last ditch effort, Tyrion gives Captain Strickland a letter to give to Cersei as he returns to Kings Landing.

Varys confides in Tyrion the glimpses of madness he saw in Dany, revealing Jons past. He proposes that Jon would be a just king. Tyrion is disturbed at speaking of treason. On the other side of Dragonstone, Dany reveals to Jon that he revealed his identity to her while recovering. Jon says he doesnt want the throne, and has never wanted it. She asks him to rule with her but he says cant be with her either. She demands that if the moment comes he will publicly renounce his claim on the throne. He promises he will. She asks if he has told anyone who he is, and the camera cuts away.

The next night in the great hall, Jamie and Brienne have a conversation. Jamie asks her if shes ever been with a man and she says that Jamie knighting her was the only kind thing a man has done in her life besides Renlys dance. He seems shocked and he tells her that she was more worthy of being in the Kingsguard than he ever was. At the head table Sansa and Dany engage in a war of words. Dany reveals that she knows Jons true identity and that she knows how Sansa feels. She tells Sansa that everyone must bend the knee to the one true queen and that if they refuse to do so, it is treason. Sansa responds that she is not the true queen and reveals to all that Dany is not the heir to the Iron Throne, Jon is.

**Episode 6 (The Death of Duty)**

The great hall of Dragonstone erupts. The crowd cries for evidence. Stepping forward, Howland Reed confirms Sansas claim, he was at the Tower of Joy and Ned Stark forsook his honor and took Jon as his own bastard to save his life. The banners of the North and the Vale immediately declare for Jon but Jon, still weak from his recovery, rises and the hall goes silent. He reminds them that it doesnt matter who sits the Iron Throne because the real war is still going on and they are all on the same side. He says that he doesnt want the Iron Throne and that once the war is over he will renounce his claim. He says that Dany is his queen.

Dany departs the hall and Jon follows. She is furious at Sansa but Jon defends her, saying that Dany goaded her. He tells her that everyone will come to love her as he does in time and that Sansa will accept it in the end. She confides in him that everything has failed since she arrived in Westeros and that she doesnt know who she can trust anymore. He tells her that she is a good person and can trust him She tries to kiss Jon and he withdraws, saying that he cant. She says that their family wed together for centuries and he says that he is of the north and that it isnt their way. He says he will always love her but their fates are not intertwined that way.

Arya and Gendry are in bed together discussing Jons heritage. She points out that his father killed Jons father. He tells her that hes not his father and she agrees. They are interrupted by a knock on the door. Melisandre enters the room. Gendry asks why she has come and she says that she was wrong about attempting to kill him. She tells him that the Lord of Light kept him alive for a reason and that without him they could not win the war for dawn. Arya asks her how many people she killed while she was wrong and Melisandre says too many. She then says that she wasnt wrong about Arya shutting many different colored eyes and leaves the room.

A council is called in the map room. Bran reveals that the Three-Eyed Raven has always kept the Night King at bay since the time of heroes. If the Three-Eyed Raven were to die, the Night Kings true power will be unleashed and he cannot he stopped. As he is no longer truly alive, his goal is to end the world of the living. Bran reveals that when he crossed the wall, the power keeping the army of the dead from passing through was ended. Ever practical, Davos suggests leaving Westeros altogether and Bran says that if the army of the dead is not stopped in Westeros, the seas will eventually freeze and the entire world will fall. According to Bran, the Night King plans to take Kings Landing to turn the millions there into his army before turning to Dragonstone. They realize they need to evacuate all the civilians of Kings Landing so he cant grow his army and to do that they need control of the capital. Tyrion asks Bran if it is there that they will make their final stand and Bran says it is. Tyrion says that he has a plan and the camera cuts away.

At night, Sam and Jon drink alone by the fire. They mourn Edd. Sam reveals that Gilly is pregnant and the maester says it will be a boy. They are joined by Theon, who is embraced by Jon. Jamie and Tyrion walk in on the trio. Jamie says that he fought beside Sams family in their last battle and that his brother was honorable and saved his life; he says that is was a shame that his brother felt that it was his duty to die beside his father. Sam tells him that no matter how much his father hated him and poorly he was treated, he still was hurt to hear of his death. Tyrion dryly says that his father tried to have him executed before he killed him so he understands. Theon says that family relationships are complicated. Looking into the fire, Jon echoes Aemon and says that love is the death of duty and Tyrion flips it, saying that sometimes duty is the death of love. Jamie is visibly shaken. Davos enter and ask if Jamie is ready and he nods. As Jamie and Tyrion depart, Jon tells them to take care of my sister.

The next morning the Greyjoy ships depart and the bulk of the allied armies march away on land. Sansa, Yohn Royce, Robin Arryn, Missandei, Lyanna Mormont, Sam, and Gilly remain on Dragonstone with the civilians, protected by the army of the Vale and Howland Reeds men. Sansa and Theon embrace. Bran thanks Meera for her protection and her brothers sacrifice and orders her to stay on the island with her father, telling her there will be no return for her if she goes to Kings Landing. Brienne goes in Sansas name as the commander of the northern army but orders Pod to remain to protect Sansa. He begrudgingly complies. On the road to Kings Landing, Bran wargs to stand before the Night King and tells him he will be waiting for him in the throne room.

Cutting to the throne room, Captain Strickland delivers Tyrions letter to Cersei and the contents are revealed. Tyrion pleads with her to surrender not for her own sake but for her childs sake. She burns his letter, while choking up. Late at night, Euron begins talking about their future prince that will rule the land and sea. Cersei tells Euron that she suffered a miscarriage and when he attempts to take her then and there, she reveals it was not his child and he will never have one with her. She says he will never touch her again. He enters a rage, causing the Mountain steps between them. Euron says he will bring the apocalypse of the sea to Westeros and rise again as the drowned god. He is interrupted by the city bells alerting the capital of the arrival of the allies as the episode cuts to black as he laughs manically.

**Episode 7 (Valonqar)**

The episode begins aboard a ship with Tyrion and Jamie saying goodbye, thinking they may never see each other again. They bond over their love for each other and Jamie remarks that perhaps the people of Kings Landing wont hate him for saving them this time. Tyrion says that the people of Kings Landing are unlikely to come to the right conclusion about anything. Tyrion watches from the deck as a rowboat containing Davos, Jamie, Arya, and the Hound is lowered to the water.

Per Tyrions plan, Theons remaining ships attack Eurons fleet as a decoy to allow Davos to smuggle Jamie, Arya and the Hound into Kings Landing. The allied army sets up outside the walls, drawing attention to two fronts. Drogon and Rhegal fly to Eurons head ship to burn it, but stop when Dany sees that the ship is empty except for Yara tied to the mast. Hiding on another ship, a crazed Euron uses the scorpion and kills Rheagal, triggering Dany to lose her temper and begin burning ships indiscriminately. She burns most of his ships, and some of her own, destroying the ships they planned to use for the evacuation. Theon reaches Eurons ship and rescues Yara. As he does, Euron emerges from the water. Dany blasts the back of the ship and the siblings fight Euron on the sinking deck. Theon kills Euron by drowning him in the captains quarters before the two escape to safety.

Meanwhile, sneaking through the room containing the dragon skulls, Jamie, the Hound, and Arya reach the Throne room. The Mountain and Qyburn are waiting at the base of the stairs to Cerseis chamber. Qyburn refuses to let Jamie see Cersei, calling him a traitor and says that its the queens orders. The Hound steps forward and knocks Qyburn to the side. The mountain steps forward and Cleganebowl occurs allowing Jamie to continue forward to reach Cersei. The Hound kills the Mountain by sticking his head into one of the braziers of fire but is mortally wounded in the process. Arya ends the Hounds suffering after he urges her to give up her quest for vengeance so she doesnt end up like him. Crying, Arya looks up to find Qyburn aiming a crossbow at her.

Jamie reaches Cersei in the map room and asks if she received Tyrions letter. She says she read it and burned it; she says she cannot believe he chose their traitor brother over her. He begs her to open the gates and give the living a chance. He promises her that they will allow her to leave to the free cities alive and raise her child and that he will find her there. She tells him he always was the stupidest Lannister and that she wont give up her throne. She says if she opens the gate everything their family has worked for will be undone. He cries as he begins to strangle her until he hears Qyburn tell him to stop, with a crossbow pointed at him. Cersei gives the order for Qyburn to shoot. Qyburn shoots Cersei through her heart and removes his face, revealing Arya. The episode ends with Jamie collapsing and Arya reciting her list one last time while walking towards the dying Cersei, her blood spreading over the map of Westeros, every name now crossed off.

**Episode 8 (The Iron Throne)**

A shaken Jamie assumes control of the Lannister army and orders the gates opened. When word reaches them that the queen is dead, the Golden Company stands down. The allied armies retreat inside the capital and the camera follows Tyrion from behind as he walks through the city. We see Varys approach Captain Strickland at the entrance to the Red Keep as Tyrion passes by. Davos is the first to enter the throne room and finds Jamie waiting there. He comments on how he attempted to take the castle with Stannis and how things might have turned out differently if he did. Jamie questions how things might be different if he didnt stick a knife in his kings back. Jon and Tyrion enter the throne room and Dany lands in the Red Keep among terrified civilians, a far-cry from when she was entering the liberated slave cities. Tyrion embraces Jamie and he shakes his head causing Tyrion to burst into tears. Dany enters the throne room and Jon approaches her, offering condolences about Rheagal. She barely registers him, staring and walking towards the Iron Throne.

She is snapped out of it when the Golden Company burst through the door and claim that she has no right to sit the Iron Throne. Captain Strickland says that they are declaring for the true heir to the Iron Throne, Jon. Danys eyes flame but Jon immediately steps forward and says that once the battle is over he will renounce his claim to the throne. Strickland says until that point comes no one else will sit on the throne. Grey Worm steps forward but Dany calls him down. Jon follows her up the stairs. In Cerseis former chambers Dany asks Jon why he wont renounce the throne right now and Jon says because he doesnt know if either of them will make it through the battle, and if he dies she will be the heir anyway. She says that once the battle is over they will be pitted against each other for the throne regardless of whether he renounces his claim or not and that they wont be able to stop it no matter how they feel. Jon says that he knows and when the time comes he will not fight her. She says there is a way to avoid this and before she can propose their marriage the bells ring, signifying the arrival of an incoming army.

It is Edmure and the Riverlands army and they arrive with news that the army of the dead will arrive by the next nightfall. The final council is called and all the leaders of the disparate factions gather in the throne room. Bronn enters the room and approaches Tyrion and Jamie, telling them that their sister promised him two castles to kill them. Tyrion promises him two castles if he doesnt. Tormund is amused that all their warfare was over such an uncomfortable chair. Jon manages to rally them together one final time. It is determined that Yara and Davos will lead the civilian evacuation on the remaining ships, still less than half of what they had hoped for. They will use fire to funnel the army of the dead into the tight streets of Kings Landing and utilize strategic retreats until Dany can find the Night King and get him out of the sky. Bran will wait for him in the Throne Room, protected by the Red Keep until the end. Bran reveals the wildfire that Cersei has stored throughout the city and the Red Keep to light if the allies ever breached the walls and Tyrion is chosen to give the order to light the wildfire at the last possible moment. Theon asks Yaras leave to protect his family (Bran) instead of helping lead the evacuation and she agrees.

After the meeting, Theon approaches Arya, who is staring into the fire alone. She confesses that completing her list didnt bring back the people she lost. Theon says hes haunted by his part in her pain but that all he can do now is help them as best he can. Arya tells him that everything hes done has brought him to where he is now. Yara walks up and embraces him and says what is dead can never die, departing knowing they will never see each other again. Arya tries to return the Catspaw dagger to Bran for his protection. He takes it and hands it to Jamie, saying that his fate was set in motion when he was pushed from the window and now it is his turn to set Jamies fate in motion.

Varys finds Tyrion in the Tower of the Hand, rearranging the chairs. Tyrion tells Varys he knows that he was the one who told the Golden Company about Jon. Varys says that if they survive this battle they will be ruled by another mad queen who cares about nothing but her own ambition. Tyrion says that Dany is still good and that when the battle is over, if they still live, he will need to leave Westeros to escape from Danys wrath. Varys tells Tyrion that he hopes he is wrong and that he has a spot on the final ship in the evacuation and the two friends bid each other farewell.

At this point a montage occurs. Davos and Yara use the fleet to evacuate as many civilians to Dragonstone as they can but because Dany sank so many ships, most of the civilians are still stuck in the city as the final battle begins. Davos is shown comforting a young girl with a burnt face. Varys gives up his spot on the last ship to a little child waiting on the dock. As many remaining civilians as can be are brought into to the Red Keep. Tyrion, Bronn, Jamie and Brienne play one final drinking game together and reminisce. Arya and Gendry walk the deserted flea bottom together. Dany approaches Drogon as snow begins to fall. Bran is wheeled beside the Iron Throne.

In the Throne Room Melisandre approaches Varys, who is disturbed. She tells him that it is time for both of them to die in this strange country. He reveals what the voice in the flames told him: how no matter how hard he tried the realm would collapse upon him in the end. He takes it to mean that they lose the battle and nothing remains. She responds that the night will be dark and full of terrors. Jon approaches Dany and Drogon and she tells him that if they survive the night, the only way to save Westeros will be for the two of them to rule together. He looks at her sadly but before he can speak the bells ring one final time and the camera rises above Kings Landing, showing the entire army of the dead spread out before the city.",5,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Meaning a trial by combat between two teams of 7 fighters. For the fate of humanity!

Like I said, Im not gonna get super detailed about how/why this would happen. But who would you choose to represent the living in this Trial by 7? Of course, they have to be living and in the North at the time of the trial. 

My Seven:
1. Jon Snow (armed with Longclaw)
2. Arya Stark (armed with Catspaw Dagger and maybe an Obsidian Needle?)
3. Jorah Mormont (armed with Heartsbane)
4. Brienne of Tarth (armed with Oathkeeper)
5. Berric Dondarrion (armed with a flaming sword of Rhllor)
6. The Hound (armed with an Obsidian axe)
7. Jaime Lannister (armed with Widows Wail)

The Jaime pick may be controversial but I love the poetry of the two swords forged from the ancient Stark blade Ive defending Winterfell.

Here are my thoughts on why we should be looking at her as more of a candidate:

* The series kicks off with the Starks vs the Lannisters. Sure, Cersei makes a lot more enemies as the series wears on, but Catelyn has more reason to hate her than others. She indirectly got Ned killed, she held Sansa captive and facilitated Tyrion marrying her, her family conspired in the Red Wedding, etc, etc. 
* This from Maggy's prophecy: ""And when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you."" This from Catelyn to Brienne: ""I have no skill with swords, but that does not mean that I do not dream of riding to King's Landing and wrapping my hands around Cersei Lannister's white throat and squeezing until her face turns black."" 
* George RR Martin has repeatedly said that he enjoys when prophecies are true, but not in the literal sense. Cersei expects that Tyrion will be the valonqar because he's an *actual* little brother she shares animosity with. But Jaime is another *actual* little brother. If the two have beef, it would be illogical for Cersei *not* to expect Jaime to become the valonqar. And with Jon slaying Daenerys, the chances of Jaime pulling a similar ""go in for a kiss but stab you instead"" move seem minute, since it would be fairly anticlimactic or--if it occurred earlier--make the big Jon/Dany twist underwhelming. Catelyn is leading the *Brother*hood without Banners, and is likely more dimunitive than its other members, especially since she's undead now, thus ""little brother."" 
* The valonqar bit was eliminated from the show. Back then, we thought maybe it was because it was too obvious that it was Jaime. But watching Cersei's fate in the show play out, and how disappointing it was, I felt fairly certain that GRRM would offer each character a more fitting end. Why didn't Cersei get the ending she deserved? Well, can we recall another important storyline omitted from the show that GRRM repeatedly said he didn't think should be omitted? *Lady Stoneheart.*
* People are wondering what the point of Stoneheart's arc is. That, to me, suggests there's more to come from her. I doubt she'd have lasted this long, or been brought back to life in the first place (since we know there has to be some purpose for that) if she isn't involved with *something* major.

People have been generating theories about GoT and ASoIaF for ages so I'm sorry if this reiterates points someone else has made. But it's been a thought of mine for a long time now and I'm wondering why discussions of the valonqar often include tons of people but I never see Stoneheart brought into them.",12,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

If someone wasnt corrupted by power in the last two seasons, it wouldve totally undermined that theme. Perhaps a new character couldve been introduced to take that role but that, in my opinion, wouldve made it worse.

This is not saying my opinion is better or even on the same level as someone with an intricate knowledge of the show. This post has no real purpose.

A new venue for all rare books aficionados to meet, discuss, and share our passion for all works by the modern day literary god, George RR Martin is open!

[**George RR Martin Rarities**](https://www.facebook.com/groups/472004276741162/)

This is the very first Facebook group solely dedicated to sharing news, buying, selling, and trading of rare books by George RR Martin and everyone is welcome to join. We already have several of the most established and well-respected rare books super-collectors amongst our ranks including our finest Rebecca Dornsife, Pat Robinson, Yegor Malinovskii, and Kris Webster!

Emulating the much venerated Stephen King Rare Editions group by Kris Webster, our Group will focus solely on collecting rare books including 1) limited &amp; lettered editions, 2) 1sts, 3) signed, 4) proofs/Arcs, and 5) original illustration artworks featured on GRRM's works.

An all new up-to-date compilation of wish list/sales list is also available in the group, so if you are looking for a book to complete your matching set or have rare books for sale, please join the group!

(I have been collecting GRRM for years, but for the life out of me, I could not find certain rare books so I figured, this gathering of collectors would be invaluable for those with similar difficulties! If this posting violates any policies, please let me know and I will delete it!)",0,1,False,self,,,,,

So for context: Im a Muslim female. Im pretty religious. I wear abaaya and hijab and Im very shy in public. Ive never even hugged a guy in my life. However Im very into movies,shows and video games and I am/was a huge fan of GOT (Game Of Thrones)

So I have a group of friends who are all Muslim yet Im the only one who wears hijab and have the most knowledge about Islam. Now yes GOT isnt exactly a Muslim friendly show but I loved the storylines and the characters and how you were always on the edge of your seat and there was never a dull moment. So my friends found out I watched it and most of them didnt seem to care. If they did they didnt voice it. But I have one friend whos one of my closest friends and she went OFF on me.

She started questioning my religious beliefs and how Im probably a really bad Muslim now because I watch GOT. Now she doesnt know anything about the show. She sent me all these random articles (mostly from parenting/Christian sites) about how they promote abuse and are just porn shows

Tbh there isnt THAT much porn. Its just naked people most of the time. And also this friend (lets call her Jane) has told me to watch shows which have had loads of sex scenes and nudity so I dont see what her problem is.

Another time Jane told me about this interview she watched on YouTube and the title of the vid had the word Porn in it. As a joke I asked her why she was watching it and she literally said

You cant question why Id watch an interview which discusses porn while you watch GOT. Youre basically watching a porno

GOT  IS  NOT  PORN  

It just annoys me when people - especially someone who is meant to be my friend - judge me as a person because I watch one show. Its hard to express into words but now whenever I meet people I dont tell them I watch it for fear that theyll judge me because of my religion and stuff. 

I see this view everywhere. On twitter, on YouTube, in real life. Just let people watch what they want.

Are the last three seasons worth watching, or do they just feel like fanfiction?

While I've definitely enjoyed the ride thus far, I have started to feel throughout Season 5 that most of the original storylines I liked about the show were starting to run thin.  The Season 5 finale, ""Mother's Mercy,"" felt like a nice culmination, including Stannis's and Myrcella's deaths, Cersei's public comeuppance, and Theon's arc.  If ""Mother's Mercy"" had ended up being the series finale, I think many audience members would have been satisfied.  None of these may be a ""final ending,"" but since I know the final ending is going to suck, I'm very satisfied with where I am now.

I also know, just from cultural osmosis, that both Jon Snow and the Hound will be coming back, but I actually really liked both of their respective ""deaths,"" and found them fitting.  If them being brought back is not canon in the published novels, then I don't really want to see their deaths undone.

But I'm open to having my mind changed.  Do you consider the show still worth watching beyond this point, and if not, what is the episode that jumps the shark?",20,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I feel likes its the latter because theres a good amount of evidence for Jon still loving Daenerys after finding out about his parentage.

Even after finding out who his parents is he kisses her and tells her we can live together in Episode 4. Jon also told Dany he has to tell his sisters the truth because theyre family. Dany misunderstood this for a lack of love from Jon and contributed to her madness and stupid actions. The real reason for Jon turning Dany down is because Dany becoming a monster. The first time he truly rejects her is in episode 5 after she has done some wack shit. Up until then he truly loved her. 

Neds parents were cousins and remember its medieval times ideals were very different. 

There are theories that in the books Jon will marry Sansa. Many are horrified but at the end of the day theyre only cousins. What makes the difference is that they were raised as brother and sister. In the case of Dany and Jon theyre almost like strangers. The writers of the show just needed just another stupid reason to make Dany go mad in like 2 episodes. 

Jon was even leaning towards accepting the incest and being with Dany but then she went ballistic past the point of no return.
We all known Jon loved her till the end and only killed her because she was too far gone down the path of madness.",8,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

House of Dragons will be set roughly 300 years in the past. Of course, no other character will be alive for these events.. but, come to think of it.. there is one character that might be able to &amp; my theory is it could be Melisandre aka The Red Witch.
She dies after the Battle Of Winterfell due to her old age which by Season 8 she is at least 400 years old according to the GOT [wiki page](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Melisandre) born in 100BC. 
The events of the prequel is 300 years ago so by the time of the prequel events she would still be at least 100 years old due to her worshipping the lord of light &amp; her enchanting necklace keeping her alive for the purpose of  Battle of Winterfell Im just wondering if I could be right or could be just whimsical thinking, since shes my favorite.. so, what do you guys think about this speculation?",12,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Season 5: I love every season but this is the least rewatch able stuff like Sansas rape, shireen burned, and the sand snakes were dumb, but Dany meeting Tyrion was great and hardhome was phenomenal, so this is my least favorite but still good.
7. Season 7: This and 8 are basically tied, I love it very much it just feels rushed, like I love beyond the wall but I understand some of the writing lacks logic, but little finger dying was great, olennas death was badass, and Arya killing the Freys made for an excellent season.
6. Season 8: This is my opinion and personally I loved this season a lot. I found the writing to be great, and for the most part I thought it stayed true to the characters, Dany going mad made sense to me because she was acting emotionally, Jaime going back to cersei worked for me because while he understood she was evil he still loved her and wanted to die with her. I actually loved the battle of winterfell while it was hard to see I thought the deaths and action were great, sure I would like to see more battles because winter is coming since season 1 and it ends in one night it does feel anticlimactic. I enjoyed every episode except the finale, Bran getting the throne was dumb. And this season had some plot holes and was rushed in some areas but I overall really loved it.
5: Season 6: huge jump in quality here, battle of the basterds and winds of winter are my 2 favorite episodes in the show. Just show many great moments like hold the door, Cersei blowing up the sept, king in the north, R+L=J confirmed, and Ramsey getting eaten by his own hounds. I think that this season does drag with aryas story in bravos and Jaime dealing with the blackfish. But overall fantastic television.
4. Season 2: Great character work Tyrion really shines, black water is fantastic, Jon meeting Ygritte, a little slow at some points but just fantastic writing overall.
3. Season 3: Fantastic red wedding still gives me chills, no negatives with this season.
2. Season 1: It started it all. Ned Stark dying was such a great twist, just a perfect first season.
1. Season 4: Just perfect television, Tyrion and aryas arcs this season are the best in the show. Tyrions trial, mountain vs viper, and Tywin dying were all great, this personally my favorite season.

Mine is the Nordic (Finland/Sweden/Norway/Denmark) version, but it should be similar to the US and UK versions. Overall, it's a really cool set imo. The outer box is made of wood, while the individual cases are vinyl-like cases and made of thick cardboard. The wooden box was packaged in a styrofoam-padded cardboard box, which was nice as it prevented damage during transit.

The diorama image formed by the cases looks really nice in person. The box set has 3 additional bonus discs and the season cases have 4 discs per season (seasons 1-6) and seasons 7-8 have 3 discs each. The bonus sleeve also includes a small booklet, which was disappointing, as it basically only lists the contents of the discs + episodes. No character bios, episode synopses, family trees or maps. At least it has nice artwork, but the booklet could and should have been a lot better. Luckily all the retailer exclusive bonus features are included on the bonus discs. Conquest &amp; Rebellion is also included.

The set is also a lot bigger than I expected. I honestly thought it would be only slightly bigger than regular Blu-ray box sets, but it's huge. I put one steelbook in a couple of pictures as comparison. The box set doesn't really include that many goodies, only the Hand of the King pin (that is used to lock the leather strap on the side of the box), the small booklet and a thank you letter.

Here are some pics of the set. Overall, a really nice and beautiful set, but I would have preferred to have some sort of book (or a bigger booklet) that would have included some character bios, maps etc. The artwork on the sleeves is beautiful and two-sided. However, the sleeves are really impractical to slide in or out of the box, as they're so closely packed in, so they tend to stuck onto each other and it's a bit of a hassle to get them out (or put them back in). The box set also has two protective and translucent plastic films next to season 1 sleeve and the bonus sleeve. They can easily be slided out of the box, but I prefer to have them, as it creates a window-like look to the diorama and prevents dust from getting into the diorama.

The sleeves are two-sided and have artwork and discs on both sides on disc pouches. Seasons 1-6 have 2 discs each side, seasons 7-8 and the bonus sleeves have two discs on the front side and one disc on the back side.

Sorry that the post got so long due to so many pictures. Anyway, I thought many would be interested to know what the set actually looks like.

However, as I finish a book my fianc and I watch the corresponding season. For season five I decided we could go ahead and watch because Ive done research and supposedly the show takes a pretty drastic turn from the source material in the novels, and thats totally fine with me. 

However... I have avoided spoilers alllllllll these years. I know nothing, except what a friend rottenly spoiled for me about the season 8 finale because she thought it was funny. So, as we just finished season 5 tonight and Jon Snow was murdered, I was in disbelief. 

I cried, I screamed a little, I mean... Its Jon Snow. I thought it was a vision or maybe hed wake up with white eyes and everything would get crazy. My fianc, whose never watched or read but knows all of the spoilers just from being a constant internet browser, told me he was gone for good. I told him I had seen a clip from season 8 where he was watching over people, and he said it was just him being remembered in spirit. 

He has since admitted that he was kidding and that Jon would be back... But that was a devastating roller coaster of emotions for me. I thought this page might enjoy a story time. Thanks for listening. Im going to try to laugh this off with comfort food as we start season 6.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

I really don't know have D&amp;D consulted with GRRM about the ending. If you have some information about that, please, let me know. I can say only two things: 

1. D&amp;D have closely worked with GRRM in the last season. It means that GRRM consulted them about the ending, which he knew for several years and already made it up. This means, the ending of the show is also the ending of GRRM. 
2. GRRM didn't work with D&amp;D in the last season. The ending of the show is the work of D&amp;D. They possibly do not know the ending of GRRM. Maybe GRRM refused to talk about it, because HBO didn't give money. This means, the ending of GRRM may be different. He already mentioned that the ending is the same and not the same at the same time. 

I'm really excited about what GRRM will write. The first book of Game of Thrones published in 90's. He lives with these characters for 30 years already. Possibly, he thinks about them everyday. Possibly, he already knows his ending. And I hope that it will be a masterpiece.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

I really don't know have D&amp;D consulted with GRRM about the ending. If you have some information about that, please, let me know. I can say only two things:

1. D&amp;D have closely worked with GRRM in the last season. It means that GRRM consulted them about the ending, which he knew for several years and already made it up. This means, the ending of the show is also the ending of GRRM.
2. GRRM didn't work with D&amp;D in the last season. The ending of the show is the work of D&amp;D. They possibly do not know the ending of GRRM. Maybe GRRM refused to talk about it, because HBO didn't give money. This means, the ending of GRRM may be different. He already mentioned that the ending is the same and not the same at the same time.

I'm really excited about what GRRM will write. The first book of Game of Thrones published in 90's. He lives with these characters for 30 years already. Possibly, he thinks about them everyday. Possibly, he already knows his ending. And I hope that it will be a masterpiece.",12,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

It was a victim of its own success as people got spoiled and compared it to the earlier seasons, which are some of the best things ever shown on tv.
