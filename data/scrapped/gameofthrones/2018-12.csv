Sansa gets a lot of flak for not telling Jon about the Knights of the Vale during their fireside chat, AND she tells him he should get more men. People see it as something like a plot hole, or just a bitch move for withholding this info. 

It occurred to me during this particular re-watch that she likely intended to use Jon and his men as a pawn. Her primary objective is to guarantee Ramsay's demise. She wants the battle to weaken Ramsay's forces so that the Vale can mop up and kill him... and, sadly, Jon's life may be negotiable to meet this goal, and his men most certainly are. 

Firstly, she's not exactly sure when the Vale will be there. Secondly, she doesn't want to divulge her hand because then Jon will wait, and Ramsay won't ""come out to play"" once the Vale is there, since his numbers advantage is gone. He'll sit behind the gates of Winterfell and force a seige against all his men, and the Vale + Jon &amp; Company may not be successful. She tells Jon he needs more men because she probably fears they'll be obliterated without causing significant enough losses to Bolton's side, and she is probably frustrated and wants Jon to live as well (doesn't give a fuck about his men). She feels the effort is foolhardy and also doesn't meet her goals. So, if this is accurate then she would believe that when the Vale does arrive, they'll be seige-ing Winterfell against Ramsay's full force.

Sorry if this has been discussed already. Again, I'm drunk.",20,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

When she sees the play starring Lady Crane, it is basically a comedic version of the most important events to happen in Westeros since Arya has been in hiding/in braavos. I noticed that her family Ned and Sansa are mentioned, and would if her being ""no one"" is her not playing a role in the story of the game of thrones (fighting for the rule of the 7 kingdoms etc.). She is watching the play and seeing everything play out, but she knows these people and she's interacted with them. Why isn't there an Arya character? Would if it's because she hasn't played a pivotal role in the story of the fight for power. 

When she leaves Jaquen finally says to her that she is ""finally no one"". But then later she responds saying she is Arya Stark of Winterfell and she is going home, and Jaquen smiles and lets her go. Would if she needed to become ""no one"" and she needed to go on this self-discovery path in braavos to truly make her mark on the fight for the iron throne. ",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

But I just watched S7E4 and there's a moment when Bran gives Arya the dagger of valyrian steel that was used to try to kill him. When he hands it to her, it seems deliberate and methodical. As it leaves his hand, the camera purposefully shows his face, and it is clear that Bran believes this knife will be used later. 

My question is: has this moment already been discussed? Are there theories on what Arya is going to do with this dagger?

Spoilers for everything. I am a spoiler. Stop reading if you haven't Finished Season 6. Stop reading if you haven't finished all the books. Stop reading if you don't know how to read.

Watch this 30 second clip of The Night King touching Bran. Remember in this show, nothing is as it seems.

Does it look like the Night King wants to hurt Bran? Not to me, it looks like Bran is startled and about to fall over and the Night king is steadying him. 

Watch again:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkzQMDhvSy0&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkzQMDhvSy0&amp;feature=youtu.be)

&amp;#x200B;

The Night King doesn't reach out and touch Bran. He only moves when Bran starts to stumble, like a father would steady his toddler. Not in a menacing or even hurtful way. If he could touch Bran, why not hurt him? Why not slice him in two with a sword?

Further, the Night King and walkers go into the cave and fuck up Blood Raven/ 3-eyed Crow. But that's about it. The wights are chasing Bran but the walkers aren't. They could have caught up to him easily, even with Wylis holding the door. The walkers could have frozen the door and frozen Wylis solid. They could have got to Bran and Meera, but seems like the mission wasn't Bran. It was to extinguish the 3 eyed Crow and maybe the last of the children of the Forest?

Don't get me wrong. I do believe the walkers are evil. But just trying to find bits of grey in these frozen armored knights. Or maybe this fans the flames of the Bran is the Night King theory. I .. don't.. know. But it seems like the white walkers are going to have an origin story that really makes us fee sorry for them. ",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

When she sees the play  starring Lady Crane, it is basically a  comedic version of the most  important events to happen in Westeros since  Arya has been in hiding/in  braavos.

She  is watching the play and seeing everything play  out, but she knows  these people and she's interacted with them. Why  isn't there an Arya  character? Would if it's because she hasn't played a  pivotal role in  the story of the fight for power.

When   she leaves Jaquen finally says to her that she is ""finally no one"". But   then later she responds saying she is Arya Stark of Winterfell and she   is going home, and Jaquen smiles and lets her go. Would if she needed  to  become ""no one"" and she needed to go on this self-discovery path in   braavos to truly make her mark on the fight for the iron throne.

I'll just get straight to the point: Robb Stark's name has **always** bugged me. It has never made sense to me. You got Sansa, Arya, Rickin, Brandon, Eddard, and Benjin. All the Starks have pretty cool names; and then there's Robb. His name is so plain compared to the others'. It doesn't fit in. I kind of just wrote it off, though. Authors use all kinds of names.

Anyhow, I was re-watching the scene where Genndri talks to Jon Snow for the first time. And Genndri says, ""Your father was best friends with my father."" I was casually enjoying it, but then the cogs in my head began to slowly turn and I finally got it!

Spoilers for everything. I am a spoiler. Stop reading if you haven't Finished Season 6. Stop reading if you haven't finished all the books. Stop reading if you don't know how to read.

Watch this 30 second clip of The Night King touching Bran. Remember in this show, nothing is as it seems.

Does it look like the Night King wants to hurt Bran? Not to me, it looks like Bran is startled and about to fall over and the Night king is steadying him.

Watch again:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkzQMDhvSy0&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkzQMDhvSy0&amp;feature=youtu.be)

&amp;#x200B;

The Night King doesn't reach out and touch Bran. He only moves when Bran starts to stumble, like a father would steady his toddler. He does this in a reactionary way, not in a menacing or even hurtful way. If he could touch Bran, why not hurt him? Why not slice him in two with a sword?

Further, the Night King and walkers go into the cave and fuck up Blood Raven/ 3-eyed Crow. But that's about it. The wights are chasing Bran but the walkers aren't. They could have caught up to him easily, even with Wylis holding the door. The walkers could have frozen the door and frozen Wylis solid. They could have got to Bran and Meera, but seems like the mission wasn't Bran. It was to extinguish the 3 eyed Crow and maybe the last of the children of the Forest?

Don't get me wrong. I do believe the walkers are evil. But just trying to find bits of grey in these frozen armored knights. Or maybe this fans the flames of the Bran is the Night King theory. I .. don't.. know. But it seems like the white walkers are going to have an origin story that really makes us feel sorry for them.

Jamie reaches Cersi and in a heart breaking scene kills the woman he loves just as Jon Snow arrives.

This is easily one of the best television episodes Ive ever seen. Everything about it is amazing. The performances are some of the best in the show imo and its directed and shot amazingly. The sequence leading up to the burning of the Sept of Baelor expertly builds tension and fills you with dread as you realize everyone in the sept will die. The still shot of the window through which Tommen throws himself to his dear works really well because its quick and doesnt give you time to dwell on it. It just moves on which kind of leaves you stunned for a bit. Cersei claiming the iron throne is haunting. Shes a woman who has lost everything. Her father and all her children are dead and she was publicly humiliated. You can tell that shes out for revenge and will stop at nothing to get it. Finally, I thought it was really cool how there were multiple parallels to earlier parts of the series. Jon Snow becomes the king in the north like Robb before him, Dany has to tell Daario that they cant be together similarly to how Tyrion had to with Shae, and Arya kills Walder Frey just how Catelyn was killed. There are many other great things about the episode but Im already writing too much.

Third, the Targaryens are prone to incestuous mating. Just like the twins. Now heres where we get to the fun part. Jaime left Cerseis side last season. Hes going to end up attempting to join Danys army.

This got me thinking that of course this placement had to be intentional, and here is what I concluded.

Cersei knew from the beginning of her plot to blow up the sept and kill the sparrows that Tommy would kill himself. Not only was she consolidating power by getting rid of the heir to Highgarden, the Queen, and all of the fanatics, but she knows that Tommy genuinely loves Margaery and that her death would lead him to commit suicide, if not at the least be so depressed that he would barely act as a king afterward. Knowing this, and knowing that Cersei has a ridiculous amount of ""love"" for her children, wouldn't she have rather cut her losses and not kill Margaery, in order to save Tommy's life?

No. Cersie would not do that because Tommy's death was only one part in her master plan. She gave up caring about her children after her daughter died, and knew that if she wanted power, true power, like she had always wished for, then she would have to kill her only surviving child to do it. Notice how unflinching she is about the death when she sees Tommy's corpse. She just brushes it off, telling Qyburn to have his ashes buried in the ruins of the Sept. She doesn't care that he died; in fact, she is glad for it, because it now means that she is the Queen of Westeros.

Let me know what you think, because I'm now convinced it was all just a plot to gain power and she never had a moment of concern for Tommy in general.",16,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Wanted to be cautious with the spoiler; this references events from before Game of Thrones, but the Inheritance Cycle spoiler is from the last book.

So while looking up lore for both stories in an attempt to create a fanfiction, i found something interesting; Aerea was inflicted by worms 'the like of which no maester or septon had ever seen'. Additionally, BAlerion had been wounded when he was the most powerful dragon, and had been able to hold his own against other Targaryean dragons.

The page i link to mentions the fact that the creatures might have been a product of the Doom of Valyria, and here is where i draw the parallel: In the Inheritance cycle, there is also an area that is inhospitable and abandoned because of twisted creatures, one of which is a sort of worm, though it doesn't exhibit the roasting effect (Burrow grub). In Inheritance cycle, we've also seen creatures that could rival dragons, the Lethrblaka, and while we haven't seen anything like that in Got, it does stand to reason that the only thing that could destroy a city with dragons is something with power to equal it.

I'm not sure how much either work could have influenced the other, but found it interesting nonetheless.

I'm sorry for rambling and if this doesn't interest anyone else. I fear this got too off track, so i will throw in a theory here: The mages of Valyria that created dragons tried to create something else and it went horribly wrong, the magic backlash destroying Valyria and spawning creatures, much like Vroengard in Inheritance cycle.

I love drawing parallels and am just fascinated by where we get our fantasy fiction from.

Ironborn = Vikings

Dothraki = the Huns

Frost Wall = Hadrian's Wall

And imagine my surprise reading about 'The Black Dinner' which is super similar to the red wedding. While our focus has been heroic sagas, the similarity to the races, peasant life, and even certain prominent figures is ever so clear.

However, one thing Im struggling to find are the roots for the main characters (Jon Snow, Daenarys, etc) Anyone have any ideas what the closest inspirations for these characters are?

As punishment for the cook breaking the sacred rules of hospitality and protection, The Gods turn the cook into a rat, cursed to eat his own offspring for survival.

&amp;#x200B;

In the finale of Season 6, Arya does exactly what the rat cook did to the king to Walder Frey (serves his sons to him in pie form). Perhaps this is foreshadowing for the fact that Arya will have a similar fate to the rat cook - cursed to kill her own loved ones.

I have been beyond the wall  
 I have witnessed the unspeakable  
 Seven Kingdoms be damned  
 (or what is left of them)  
 All of the human race will fall

Unless we find a way to overcome  
 Bitter rivalry and disputes over land  
 The fields where we once harvested  
 will turn to permafrost   
 by just a touch  
 of the Night Kings hand

I brought tidings from Hardhome  
 the cold, bitter truth  
 the rise of the deceased,   
 the cries of Wildling youths,  
 the frost seeping through  
 the breath of humanity

the echo of the hewn blade  
 that sung upon my Valyrian steel  
 still rings in mind on quiet days  
 and the bluefire eyes piercing from beyond the bay  
 \[who knew that the eyes of the abyss   
 glow blue from beyond the ethereal?\]

and in return for my duty beyond the wall  
 word came across that I had lain  
 with a woman from the winter-scape   
 and in a moment when I had sheathed Longclaw  
 a tight-lipped boy and an entourage  
 drew knives into my flesh  
 and left me for dead

in cold void of night, with naught  
 but bitter thoughts of betrayals  
 and tales forgot

Kill the boy, Maester Aemon said  
 though I dont know  
 Had I grown   
 to be a man  
 prior to my death?  
 The foreshadowing, uncanny and truth  
 little Olly marched intently, as I recalled   
 after I read traitor writ on the cross  
 The poor, callowly diffidence I outgrew  
 Witnessed, by the old gods and the new  
 Showing, in death, naught but darkness,  
 Vacuity and finality  
 my tomb

The Lord of Light  
 the crypt of Winterfell  
 and the Werewood trees  
 spoke vague whispers to me  
 of only deaths finality  
 and naught about destiny

that scarlet witch  
 she speaks of me as a bringer of light  
 but all I can see or feel in this wilder,   
 and in court councils  
 is bitter spite  
 and a foreboding in the night

220,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-12-4,2018,12,4,5,a2suhq,self.gameofthrones,[Spoilers] I realized something. I only really like 1/3 of this show.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/a2suhq/spoilers_i_realized_something_i_only_really_like/,HEV_tux,1543870274,"I've seen the entire show twice and read up to halfway through book 4. I always described Game of Thrones to people who hadn't seen it as **""Mostly great, but sometimes bad or just average""**. 

I recently realized what exactly I mean by that. This show (and for the most part the books) is basically centered around 3 seperate stories. Jon at the Wall, Danny in Essos, and everything else which is *mostly* centered around kings landing. There are a few examples of characters and events crossing over but i'm realizing that for the most part these 3 stories never intertwine at all. For the first 4 seasons especially The Wall is an entirely seperate world from everything else that occurs in the show, the same goes for Danny.

I think Jon and Danny's stories are incredibly boring and don't contain any of the things people really love about GOT or ASOIAF. 

**Everything that happens with Jon** at the wall is basically just a coming of age story about a kid in over his head who overcomes obstacles and has a pocohantas subplot.

**Everything involving Danny** is about an oppressed girl rising to power and punishing extremely cliche one note villains for being really really really bad people. Every asset she gains and every obstacle she overcomes usually comes down to A: She has dragons. B: She is fireproof. C: Somebody wants to have sex with her.

**The rest of the show** is where we see the true quality of Game of Thrones. We realize that the people we thought we hated have another side to them, as do the people we thought were perfect. We see violent conflicts where it's not clear who is in the right or the wrong. Political intrigue, deception, social commentary, philosphical commentary. Characters like Tywin, the Hound, Aria, Jaime, Tyrion, Bronn, Roose, Littlefinger etc. This is really where Game of Thrones shines. When people talk about the gritty realism, undermining of fantasy tropes, surprise twists, great acting, writing, and thought proviking storylines they are almost entirely referring to the story in mainland Westeros. None of this stuff is really present in the other two stories which recieve almost as much screentime.

Jon and Danny's stories don't undermine fantasy tropes in the slightest but relish in them. The most we see of multi fauceted conflicts is between the wildlings/watch and danny's short time ruling Mareen. Even those examples don't do anything that hadn't been done before and better in the main story of the show. The White Walkers are your typical evil incarnate, dragons are what they are in everything else, Jon is Frodo, Jorrah is lancelot, Daario is Han Solo, Mance is William Wallace, Samwell is Samwise, Ygritte is Pocohantas, the Dothraki are orcs and the slavers of mareen are lex luthor with a pinch of skeletor.

**TLDR: I think that Danny and Jon's plotlines represent the worst aspects of the show and none of the best. If they recieved far less screentime the story would be much better off.**

[There's a much better formatted version of this on my website](https://judiahjclark.com/game-of-thrones-season-8-deadpool-results/) (couldn't figure out how to do it as well here), so if you'd like it with pictures and the like, that's the better one.

I got 209 results for the deadpool. The rules of which required a response for each character as to whether they will be dead, alive, or undead by the end of the series. If you'd still like to fill out the survey, [you can find it here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSciqTDc5L_inJGxm-fL1VvC2e0KTdnhjvhAIv_8cSU3OBbXKg/viewform?usp=sf_link)

Exact figures are available [on my website in an easy-looking format](https://judiahjclark.com/game-of-thrones-season-8-deadpool-results/). I apologize I couldn't figure out a way to translate it easier. I will however include the majority results (over 50%), and exact results for conflicted characters, Azor Ahai and Iron Throne predictions.

&amp;#x200B;

**Here's the** ***majority*** **results for the main characters:**

**Alive**:  Jon Snow, Tyrion Lannister, Sansa Stark, Arya Stark, Bran Stark, Samwell Tarly, Davos Seaworth, and Brienne of Tarth. 

**Dead:**  Jaime Lannister, Cersei Lannister, and Theon Greyjoy. 

Daenerys was conflicted with 44.5% thinking she will live, 49.3% thinking she will die, and 6.2% believing she will become undead.

&amp;#x200B;

**And here's the** ***majority*** **results for all other characters:**

**Alive:** Missandei, Yara Greyjoy, Gilly, Little Sam, Podrick Payne, Meera Reed, Gendry, Lyanna Mormont, Bronn, Edmure Tully, Hot Pie, Jaqen H'ghar ""No One"", Tycho Nestoris 

**Dead:** Jorah Mormont, Grey Worm, Varys, Rhaegal, Drogon, Tormund Giantsbane, Beric Dondarrion, ""Dolorous"" Eddison Tollett, Yohn Royce, Sandor ""The Hound"" Clegane, Gregor ""The Mountain"" Clegane, Qyburn, Euron Grejoy, Melisandre, The Night King, Viserion

**Conflicted:** Daario Naharis, Ghost, Robin Arryn

Daario Naharis had results of Alive (48.8%), Dead (48.3%), and Undead (2.9%).

Ghost had results of Alive (48.8%), Dead (42.6%), Undead (8.6%).

Robin Arryn had results of Alive (49.3%), Dead (43.5%), Undead (7.2%).  


**Notable data:**

Most likely to be undead is Bran Stark at 26.3%

Most likely to live is Little Sam at 91.4%

Most likely to die is Viserion at 87.6%

Oddly all dragons had a majority of death predictions. Rhaegal at 60.3% death rate, and Drogon at 54.1%

&amp;#x200B;

**Who will be Azor Ahai, the Prince That Was Promised:**

* **Jon Snow:** 53.1%
* **No one:** 22%
* **Daenarys Targaryen:** 7.7%
* **Jaime Lannister:** 5.3%
* **Child of Daenarys and Jon Targaryen (dubbed Boatbaby by the fanbase):** 2.3%
* **Drogon:** 1.9%
* **Rhaegar Targaryen:** 1.4%
* **Predictions guessed twice:** Bran Stark, Both Daenarys and Jon
* **Predictions guessed once:**  Davos Seaworth, Ghost, Gendry Baratheon, Stannis Baratheon,  TeamWinterIsHere/all of the Army of the Living, never specified, and  ultimately up for debate

**Who Will Rule From the Iron Throne:**

* **Jon Snow:** 29.7%
* **No one:** 29.2%
* **Daenerys Targaryen:** 18.2%
* **Gendry:** 8.1%
* **Daenerys and Jon:** 2.9%
* **Tyrion Lannister:** 2.4%
* **Sansa Stark:** 2.4%
* **Predictions guessed twice**: Jaime Lannister, Stannis Baratheon, Jon and Dany's kid (Boatbaby), ruled by a council
* **Predictions guessed once**: Cersei Lannister, Bran Stark, Ghost, Hot Pie, various lords or monarchs, there won't be a throne

Hopefully the formatting wasn't too bad, huge thanks to everyone who filled out the survey! Good luck in the Long Night!

&gt;He had another cup of wine as he dressed, then took his wife by the arm and escorted her from the Kitchen Keep to join the river of silk, satin, and velvet flowing toward the throne room. Some guests had gone inside to find their places on the benches. Others were milling in front of the doors, enjoying the unseasonable warmth of the afternoon. **Tyrion led Sansa around the yard, to perform the necessary courtesies.**

&gt;**She is good at this, he thought**, as he watched her tell Lord Gyles that his cough was sounding better, compliment Elinor Tyrell on her gown, and question Jalabhar Xho about wedding customs in the Summer Isles. His cousin Ser Lancel had been brought down by Ser Kevan, the first time hed left his sickbed since the battle. He looks ghastly. Lancels hair had turned white and brittle, and he was thin as a stick. Without his father beside him holding him up, he would surely have collapsed. Yet when Sansa praised his valor and said how good it was to see him getting strong again, both Lancel and Ser Kevan beamed. **She would have made Joffrey a good queen and a better wife if hed had the sense to love her. He wondered if his nephew was capable of loving anyone.**

A Feast for Crows - Alayne II


Sansa has been called as the Key to the North for some of the biggets players of the game. She was used as a pawn because of her importance to the story. Her entire story arc revolve around the political game. She spent years in Kings Landing observing the most important players of the game make their moves, later she is taken to Vale where she is being trained by Littlefinger himself about the art of politics. In the show she was the one who together with Jon took back the North and Winterfell.

Why she still under the radar of so many? I think she has a great chance to be Queen in the end of this story. Even Tyrion was able to see how good she could be at the job and she was probably living the worst momment of her life, during their marriage.

There are strong arguments both ways, on the protagonist side shes the breaker of chains, shes a reformer and shes inspired devotion in numerous characters with some, such as Missandei, appearing so inherently good that it seems impossible that Dany could be anything but a protagonist. The counter argument is that Danys thirst for power and her penchant for executing anyone who gets in her way her shows shes starting down a path to becoming a brutal autocrat.

My personal view is that she crossed a line when she burnt the Tarlys, there was a measure of justification for everyone else shes killed but executing prisoners for refusing to serve her is a move straight out of the villain playbook.

Feel free to correct me if i have stated anything that is false.

&amp;#x200B;

So my theory is that Daenerys Targaryen is the sole reason that the ice wall

was able to be breached by the White walkers.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**\[Explanation\]**

Benjen stark says (season 6 if i am not mistaken) Ancient spells were carved into its foundations.

Strong magic to protect men from what lies beyond. And while it stands, the dead cannot pass.

He also explains that he can not pass the wall because he is partly undead, this further solidifies

the theory.

&amp;#x200B;

Ok so knowing this we can assume that the White walkers and the undead army are unable to pass

the wall at this time due to the strong magic preventing them from doing so.

&amp;#x200B;

The White Walkers had never previously attempted to attack or pass the wall before the season

7 finale when they had obtained the dragon from Daenerys. The powerful ranged attack of the now turned

dragon destroys part of the wall and allows the White walkers to pass along with their army of the undead.

&amp;#x200B;

So from all this information i feel its safe to assume that this theory is factually correct.

The White Walkers would not have captured the dragon if Daenerys Targaryen didnt make the 

reckless decision to take her dragons north past the wall to save Jon snows expedition team, the wall most likely

would have stayed unbreached unless there was another way the white walkers could have passed that im unaware of.

&amp;#x200B;

I've always had a problem with this plot line for this reason. A quick google search tells me a longship could take 6 months to build, and a 1700s style ship 1-2 years to build. So how did the Iron Islands, with no trees, manage to build a thousand ships in like a month? Did they steal them all? Buy them all? Stealing seems more of the iron price, but still, no one has that many ships. Even Dany doesn't have as many after stealing all the master's ships and the Greyjoy's join her.

But there of me that still thinks it be a better twist if Jon and/or Dany didnt end up ruling Westeros in the end and instead it was someone else. But who else should it be?

What I enjoy most is looking back at character quotes of foreshadow and the underlying themes of the series. I am going to start posting 3-4 times a week with content that I hope will start a nice discussion on each post. Feel free to chime in with whatever you want to say about the show and don't be afraid to disagree with me. 

Rumors that Tyrion will commit treason: So I am sure a lot of you have heard by now that there has been some leaked information that Tyrion is going to go against his words and will burn down kings landing along with all of its occupants. He will then stand on trial held in the dragon pit where he will eventually be executed. Personally I think that this is a fake leak. It is known that this next season is the highest kept secret thus far. They even went as far as shooting fake scenes and having scripts encrypted. I wouldn't be surprised if this scene was part of the plan for directors to throw off viewers before the final season starts. I'm not saying its impossible for Tyrion to carry out such a barbaric act but something very drastic would have to happen for his character to take a complete 180 on his own beliefs. That being said I do not think Tyrion will commit treason by burning down kings landing BUT I do think Tyrion will commit treason. Two scenes stood out in particular to me which led me to believe this... Varys and Tyrion escape, Varys helps tyrion because he saw something in tyrion when he was hand of the king for a short time and led the defense of battle of the blackwater. They were discussing this and tyrion tells varys that he wouldnt have ever expected to say this but he actually enjoys playing the game of thrones. Tyrion in my opinion is the smartest man on the show and he knows what the fuck hes doing and why hes doing it which then leads him to be the hand of a much more powerful army siding with Daenerys. Fast forward to when Tyrion brings up the topic of succession with Dany. I believe that Tyrion is only siding with Daenerys for the sole purpose of using her and inheriting the crown once the battles are won. The look on Tyrions face when Dany and Jon enter the same room on the sail back was him realizing that this is going to be tougher than he originaly thought because he knows that Jon would most likely make a better king than himself and things were about to get more difficult for little old Tyrion Lannister",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Maybe when he does this unknown what's going on to them, Arya or Jamie shoots an arrow at him knocking him off of the Dragon. It will mirror the first time we see Arya in Winterfell shooting an arrow, and or if Jamie does it, it will mirror him pushing bran out of the tower.

Actually it is more an idea than a real theory because I dont know how to argue it and there are no evidences that suggest this final.. nevertheless I think that the ipothesis Jon and/or Dany on the throne is too stale. Moreover, given the fact that along all the seasons it is been demonstrated that who lawfully rules often is not a good ruler (I think about Robert Baratheon, or Stannis or Joeffry or the Danys father and even Dany herself) a logic solution in the end could be that the lords of Westeros will ELECT their new king or queen. In this situation probably the best choice could be Jon. However it is probable that Jon will die in the final battle against the WW (this is suggested by a lot of fan theories). It is also possible that Jon will refuse to be the king and will come back to the night watcher (maybe depressed for the alleged death of Dany). In this situation  Lyanna could be the second option... in fact she is appreciated and respected by other lords and she already demonstrated her charisma and her ability to influence the decisions of other lords (at least the lords of the north) with her speaches. Maybe she will be elected after one of these inspiring speaches.
What do you think about that?",19,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

So Dany will be betrayed three times and there are plenty of theories that Tyrion will be one of them. However, what I am wondering is whether or not Tyrion is already one of them.

Tyrion loved Myrcella, and I find it hard to believe that he was unaware of her murder. I find it even harder to believe that he would simply forgive Elaria Sand for the sake of the alliance - an alliance that they didn't really even need. It makes more sense that he betrayed Dany by alerting Cersei of the Dornish and Greyjoy forces, so that the murder of his beloved niece could be avenged.

Spoiler Alert !
"" Winter is coming"" 

The opening scene started at the East Watch. The army of the dead finally broke through the wall. Lord Ed Commander sent his ravens to warn everyone, but Viserion burned them all. Tormund then decided to march to Winterfell, while Beric left with Ed to fight the army of the dead. Not all of the army stopped at Castle Black, the Night King with half of his army marched further South. Meanwhile, Jaime convinced Bronn to leave Kingslanding and go with him to Winterfell. Euron met the golden company.  The army he promised to Cersei. They arrived at Kinglanding.

 Tormund arrived at Winterfell, warning everyone about the Night King and his Ice Dragon. Jon along with others gathered in the main hall. They discussed how they would counter the attack. They planned to sorround the whole castle by Ring of Fire, so that wights could not be able to enter the gate. They all left and prepared the materials. 

Bran had another vision. He travelled to different places including the Tower of Joy. 
He saw Lyanna Stark, and suddenly a voice of a man spoke. "" He would be the song of ice and fire"" He then saw a silhoutte of a man holding a red shinning sword. This unknown man was facing the Night King. But, before the man gave his powerful hit to the Night King, Bran woke up. Jaime Lannister and Bronn arrived at Winterfell, with men wearing Frey uniforms. Jaime said he came there to help. He knew what the Night King could do. At first, people did not like Jaime being at Winterfell. But, Jon explained they needed him. They needed to be united. They could not win the war alone. Jaime and Bran then met. He could see Bran's eyes, thinking of something that happened in the past. Jaime stood on the center to make his confession.
However, before he was able to speak, the sound of horn appeared. The army of the dead arrived at Winterfell. The visibility became low due to the thick cold smoke.
Jon told for those who were not willing to fight, there's a secret passage that they could use to escape. Daenerys chose to stay and fight alongside Jon, despite of the fact that she was pregnant. Jon, The Hound, Arya, Gendry, Brienne, Tormund, Jorah, Greyworm and other several men, marched outside the gate. The pitch was then ignited and fire sorrounded the castle.
They found that the Night King had dozen of white walkers,  two giants, and hundred thousands wights. The battle began. Greyworm managed to kill one white walker, but because of the low visibility, he was slain from the back. Brienne got injured, Jorah and Tormund helped her go back to the Castle. Unfortunately, during the process, Tormund was killed. Jon, with the remaining survivors decided to fall back and flee to the South, riding over Drogon.

On the first wave, thousands of dothraki and unsullied died. The two giants carried huge boulders and placed it over the fire, so that wights could step into the Castle without being burned. The wights finally entered the castle, as the Night King burned the Godswood. 

Davos Bran Sam Gilly Missandei managed to escape. They would go to White Harbour where Daenerys fleet were. Daenerys Jon Jaime Brienne Beric The Hound Arya landed on White Harbour. However, Davos group was not there. They flew again and searched for them. Luckily, they found them.
They all headed to White Harbour. There, Bran revealed Jon the secret of his true identity. He told Jon that he was a Targaeyen, the rightful heir to the Iron Throne. Her mother was Lyanna Stark. She was not kidnapped by Rhaegar. Rhaegar loved her, and they had a secret marriage in Dorne. Sam supported it by handing over a parchment of Rhaegars annulment with Elia Martell. Bran also told him that he was Azor Azhai. He had the blood of ice and fire. That was why Jon was ressurected from death. 
Bran told him to quickly go to Trident where the battle would take place.

Menwhile, in Kingslanding, Cersei found out that Daenerys had ships in White Harbour. 
She ordered Euron to burn them all, so that Daenerys army could not flee by the sea.
However, Euron said that he would only do that after another night in Red Keep. 
They slept together again. Euron woke up and noticed some blood in Cersei's legs. 
Cersei had miscarried her baby. Euron went outside and was shocked to see that his army was gone. The Ironborn and the Golden Company.

In Dragonstone, Melissandre and Kinvara arrived with their army. They met Varys Theon and Yara. It was Varys who stole the Golden Company from Euron, after he escaped Winterfell. Melissandre said they would march to Trident, to wait for Jon.

Back at White Harbour, Daenerys had a problem. She could not take everyone at Drogons back. Everyone looked at Jon. Jon seemed to know what's the meaning of that look. He mount on Rhaegar with ease, proving that he was a true Targaeyen.
Jon and Daenerys flew along with the group to Trident. There, they met Melissandre, Kinvara, Yara, Theon, and Varys. Daenerys soon realized why Varys left Winterfell during the battle. Melissandre told Jon everything. The Night King was coming for his replacement. She confessed to Jon that there would be a great sacrifice. She pointed her hand to little sam. She wanted little sam to be burned alive. Davos, Arya, and Gendry disagreed. Sam turned angry. Bran came closer and explained that Melissandre was right. Little sam was special. He had Targaeyen blood. He was the 100th ofering. Little Sam would be the next Night King. But, Bran said Melissandre needed to be killed in order to defeat the Night King. She was the lady he was seeing in his vision. Sam gave Jon his sword and Jon stabbed Melissandre on her chest. 
The sword glowed bright red, as the army of the dead arrived. They all hurriedly got their weapons. Jon mounted Rhaegar, while Daenerys mounted Drogon. They flew up the sky, and battled with the Night King and Viserion. Viserion was too fast for them.
Menwhile, Jorah spotted a white walker aiming to strike Drogon with an ice spear. 
Jorah ran and stopped the white walker, but got killed by others. Another death came, when Beric used himself to shield The Hound from the wights. Rhaegar got hit by an ice spear and fell to the ground with Jon. Bronn went to the ballista and shot Viserion. However, it did not penetrate. Arya tossed her valyrian steel dagger and Bronn used it.
Viserion was finally hit, and fell. The Night King had no dragon now. Jon in anger, walked up to the Night King, holding the red sword. The sword glowed even more brighter.  They had exchanges of attack, until Jon fired a powerful strike. The Night King blocked it using his ice sword. 
But, Jon's sword was powerful that it broke the sword, and it landed directly to the Night King. The wights stopped and started to disappear. The army of the dead was completely destroyed. 

Afterwards, they headed to Kingslanding. 
The Hound and Jaime managed to enter the city by the help of Arya. She used a Lannister guard'd face. The Hound killed the Mountain by burning him with wildfire. 
Jaime first killed Qyburn and Euron, and headed to Cersei room. Cersei thought that Jaime was there to help her. She was about to give her a kiss, but Jaime choke her to death.

Daenerys finally conquered the city by the help of his dragons. She walked to the throne room with Jon. As she came near to the throne, she lost her interest. Jon told her what to do now. Daenerys told him to burn down the throne outside. People gathered and watched how Drogon and Rhaegar melt the Iron Throne. There would be no king or queen that would rule the seven kingdoms. 
Each of the seven kingdoms would have their own leader. Jon Daenerys Arya Sansa Tyrion Jaime Bronn The Hound and Bran went back to Winterfell to rebuild the castle. Bran was no longer a third eye raven. He became pale and weak, like what happened to Jojen Reed. Daenerys successfully gave birth to twins. The boy had a black hair. The other had white hair. Sam and Gilly married, followed by Daenerys and Jon wedding.
The Winterfell stood up again.

532,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-12-7,2018,12,7,15,a3xgqn,self.gameofthrones,[Spoilers] Arya's endgame?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/a3xgqn/spoilers_aryas_endgame/,TaraTinker19,1544165672,"Although alot of people discard it, I think the original outline sent by GRRM to his publisher is more important for clues than people may think. I posted months ago about how I think Tyrion would betray Jon and Danny based on the outline. Now alot of people think based on new info that it might be true, so even though many things have been changed I think the outline is credible. With that said here is what I can't get out of my head or figure out.

In the outline the love Triangle was supposed to be Jon Arya and Tyrion, but Arya was replaced with Danny. 

Even though this was done GRRM intended for Arya to fall in love in the books with Jon. So she is indeed capable of loving a man, and that makes her a very important character because Jon was probably the most important character.

It makes you wonder, if Jon is the actual heir to the iron Throne then was George planning on him and Arya sitting on the throne in the end? He did say ""their love would torment them until the truth about Jon's true parentage comes out."" Suggesting once they find out they are actually cousins they may be free to marry. 

But something changed his mind and he decided to shift the story to Danny. But what does that mean for Arya? Well GRRM has made it a point for Arya and Lyanna to parallel in both books and show. Why though? Why not give that the Sansa. Well in the original outline it would have been Arya and Jon love paralleling Raegear and Lyanna. So GRRM doing this it would be part of his hidden clever hints.

But since the outline has changed what is the point in Arya paralleling Lyanna now? She is no longer going to be with Jon so why? Personally I think it's part of Arya's endgame. I don't think George drifted too far away from his original plans for Arya after all. I think there are some likely ways it could end based on this. 

1. George just changed the story from Arya and Jon to Arya and Gendry. Why would the biggest reveal of Jons true identity be revealed in season 7, why not save it for season 8? Because it gives us enough time in between to think Jon will end up on the throne when in reality he or Danny could legitimize Gendry and if they die, he will be king in a final twist. A stark that looks like Lyanna will end up with a Baratheon after all. Why else set up the friendship with Arya and Gendry, tell the actress to say the line ""I can be your family"" Like you love him. Keep Gendry around. In the book Ned says ""You will marry a kind and rule his castle"", and in the show change it to high lord. Or If Danny dies Jon will take the throne and possibly marry Arya. George still made it a point for them to still have a close relationship and think about each other all of the time in the books. Arya is GRRMs wife fav and his other favorite besides Tyrion. She was also the hardest character to cast. This tells you she is more important than we think.

2. I thought about this today. If Danny gives birth and something happens to her and Jon it would be fitting if Arya promised Jon she would take care or their child just like Ned Promised Lyanna. Roles reversed in that sense. Maybe westeros is destroyed completely and Arya and refugees manage to take ships and we see them sailing off west of westros and he has the child to protect it. 

Either way my point is there has to be a deeper hidden meaning keeping the Lyanna and Arya connection after the outline was changed, and I think it will connect somehow ultimately with her endgame in a big way.",17,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Season 8 teaser: 
https://youtu.be/NspqGM0DbbQ

I suspect that the fire surrounding the lion sigil hints that Jaime is the prince who was promised (in support of u/byrd82 s theory), the snow covering the wolf and dragon possibly hints that not only do the Starks have a connection to the White Walkers (implicated in the books and the outline of the wolf at the end of Season 7 Finale), but that Jon Snow will likely become a White Walker or the next night king upon some new agreement between the white walkers and men. Indeed, Jon Snow is both Stark and Targaryen. Moreover, I believe the formation of the wall at the Neck on the map of Westeros represents this new agreement being made - rekindling one that was previously made. Its been asserted by many seemingly intelligent  fans that the original wall was built after a deal was made between man the the White Walkers (or the Others). The wall formation also supports my theory of Jon Snow becoming a white walker since the wolf and dragon pieces are now beyond the wall. Moreover, the lion sigil remains on the southern side of the wall whilst still on fire, which speaks to the theory that Jaime Lannister will become Azor Ahai. 

As a result of the wall formation, Winterfell may become part of the true north. Indeed, the Neck is the southern most region of the north of Westeros (the region of Westeros considered the north - NOT beyond the wall). Because the wall is being formed there, Winterfell will be beyond the (new) wall. 

Recall that Westeros northerners always argue we arent southerners! when Wildlings refer to them as southerners in their presence. This may foreshadow these events and/or the Starks connectedness with the White Walkers. ",4,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Spoilers season 1-7,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/a4545y/season_8_theory_jon_snow_forges_his_sword_in/,Kaleb25Birgy,1544223373,"Ok so this post is long and has lots of details regarding the prophecy of the Azor Ahai or The Prince that was Promised, so if you are educated on the subject, feel free to skim.

&amp;#x200B;

Jon kills tyrion for conspiring with Cercei and Dany as a mercy death and then will use the dragons to destroy the white walkers. Therefore forging his sword in the heart of a lion, forging his sword in the heart of his lover, then wielding light bringer (dragons) to defeat the darkness (white walkers.)

&amp;#x200B;

For this to be true, first you must know a few things about the shows history. For those who don't know, the prophecy states that the prince that was promised (TPTWP) tempered his sword in both the water and the heart of a lion and the sword snapped both times. It was then with great sorrow he knew that he must temper his sword in the heart of his lover Nissa Nissa. After doing so, it says that her blood, soul, strength, and courage went into the steel and the sword became lightbringer the red sword of heroes. TPTWP then used the sword to fight off the darkness, as far as the legend goes.

&amp;#x200B;

It is then foretold that Azor Ahai will come again. He/She must be born under a bleeding star, be reborn amidst salt and smoke, will wield a fiery weapon (possibly lightbringer), wake sleeping dragons from stone, and according to the woods witch, must be born of Rhaella and Aerys' bloodline. There are several theories surrounding which character will be the second coming of the Azor Ahai. This ranges anywhere from Sam Tarly, to Euron Greyjoy, however the most popular characters are Jon Snow and Dany. Reason being is that in one way or another, they consistently fit every description of the prophecy.

&amp;#x200B;

We'll first go into how Dany could be TPTWP. First Dany was born on dragon stone, which if she is TPTWP, that would count as being reborn, and dragon stone fits the credentials as being next to the ocean (salt) and being the original seat of house Targaryen (smoke). Dany was also reborn in season one when she walks out of the dead Khal's pyre with her freshly hatched dragons. Due to how broad the text is in the prophecy, it is believed that specifications can be met at both the true birth of the character, as well as if and when they are reborn. Therefore it is in this moment of walking out of the Pyre, that she has fulfilled several details of the prophecy at once. She is reborn amidst both smoke (from the flames), under a red shooting star that shoots across the sky (bleeding star), and wakes dragons out of stone. This scene, paired with her being originally born on Dragonstone, covers 4 of the details that will fulfill this prophecy. She was also born of Rhaella and Aerys' bloodline, and to solidify the argument, Maester Aemon goes as far as to say that for all these years maesters and followers of the R'hllor (worshipers of the Lord of Light, aka Melisandre and other Red Priestesses) have been fixated on the word prince, therefor looking for a male. Yet, due to the translation from High Valyrian, and how dragons have no true gender, that the translation could have meant prince or princess that was promised, therefore giving Dany another edge to the claim of TPTWP.

&amp;#x200B;

However I believe that Jon has the stronger claim to TPTWP. Well start with Jon's true birth and as to how he was born under the bleeding star. For those who know, there is a special sword named Dawn from House Dayne, that gets passed down to the most worthy Knight in the family, and then that knight will bear the title of the Sword of the Morning. What's special about this sword, is that it was forged from metal from a falling star, and is said to be on par with Valyrian. During the war of the 5 kings, it was Sir Arthur Dayne that wielded Dawn, and was ordered by Rhaegar Targaryen to guard Lyanna in the Tower of Joy. As most of you know, Lyanna gave birth to Jon in the tower, and Sir Dayne was there to protect her, but dies in battle by Howland Reed and Ned Stark. After his Dayne's death, Ned picks up the bloody Dawn and rushes up the tower where he sets the bloody dawn propped against the bed. Therefore Jon was literally born under a 'bleeding star'. As far as salt goes, it is said that lyanna's tears in childbirth, can be said to resemble being born of salt. Later on in season 6 we see Jon get resurrected by the red priestess Melisandre. It can be said here that he was reborn of smoke due to the fire in the room, as well as having a priestess of the lord of light cut off his hair and throw it in the flames. As far as the book goes, it is said that bran the builder felt a drop from the wall when it was being built, and as it melted down to his tongue he states that it felt ""warm and salty."" it is then theorized that due to its geological location of being near the ocean, and due to the lower melting point of salt, that the wall could have been frozen from salt water. This seems like a stronger case compared to that of lyanna's tears. Therefore we now have the bleeding star, salt and smoke. Then, jon is also of the same bloodline as dany, which would make him born of Rhaella and Aerys' bloodline as well.

&amp;#x200B;

What finally sets Jon apart from Dany is something that Dany actually experiences in season 2 at the house of the undying. Dany has many visions, however one important vision from the books is left out of the show. In the books Dany sees a room with a man with silver hair (presumably Rhaegar) who says to another woman in the room nursing a baby ""Aegon...What better name for a kingHe is the prince that was promised, and his is the song of ice and fire""

&amp;#x200B;

For a while, this vision was taken rather literally as an actual event that took place between Rhaegar and Ellia Martell about their second child who was in fact named Aegon. However, like most of the visions, this was to be taken figuratively not literally. When converted to a metaphor, it is more likely that Rhaegar is actually speaking with Lyanna who is in fact nursing Jon. What makes this stand out, is that we find out in season seven that Lyanna actually named Jon Aegon as well. Now, due to jon being born from Lyanna of house Stark (Ice) and of house Targaryen (Fire), Jon is the only character in the realm to which the song of ice and fire could be associated to. (this is also what the entire series is called lol)

&amp;#x200B;

Now at this point, Dany and Jon share the same specifications that would allow both of them to fulfill the prophecy. This is where my theory takes over.  Now that both Dany and Jon have fulfilled thus far, all that is left is to complete the prophecy: forge lightbringer. With the majority of fans agreeing that most of the prophecies have been fulfilled through metaphor, its not out of the question that the next part would require metaphors as well. This is where it gets cool.

&amp;#x200B;

So towards the end of season 7, tyrion must speak with cercei after Jon informs her that he has chosen to recognize Dany as his queen. It is generally believed that we only see the majority of their conversation, before it cuts to the rest of the characters back at the dragon pit. It's believed that whatever left of the conversation that takes place off screen, Tyrion and Cercei strikes a deal that requires Tyrion to betray Dany, Jon, and the rest of the cast. 

&amp;#x200B;

At some point near the end of season 8 Jon will find out and will kill Tyrion, therefore forging his sword in the heart of a lion. Then, during the battle, or possibly during childbirth, Dany will become fatally wounded, and Jon will be forced to take her life as mercy to give her a quick death, therefore forging his sword in the heart of his lover. Dany's blood, soul, strength, and courage will then envelope the sword and give him and it the power of lightbringer to destroy the army of the dead, OR due to the dragons mother dying, and jon now being the last living Targaryen, he will now be in control of the dragons and he will use them to fight off the Knight King.

&amp;#x200B;

Now at this point, Dany and Jon share the same specifications that would allow both of them to fulfill the prophecy. This is where my theory takes over.  Now that both Dany and Jon have fulfilled thus far, all that is left is to complete the prophecy: forge lightbringer. With the majority of fans agreeing that most of the prophecies have been fulfilled through metaphor, its not out of the question that the next part would require metaphors as well. This is where it gets cool.

&amp;#x200B;

So towards the end of season 7, tyrion must speak with cercei after Jon informs her that he has chosen to recognize Dany as his queen. It is generally believed that we only see the majority of their conversation, before it cuts to the rest of the characters back at the dragon pit. It's believed that whatever left of the conversation that takes place off screen, Tyrion and Cercei strikes a deal that requires Tyrion to betray Dany, Jon, and the rest of the cast. 

&amp;#x200B;

At some point near the end of season 8 Jon will find out and will kill Tyrion, therefore forging his sword in the heart of a lion. Then, during the battle, or possibly during childbirth, Dany will become fatally wounded, and Jon will be forced to take her life as mercy to give her a quick death, therefore forging his sword in the heart of his lover. Dany's blood, soul, strength, and courage will then envelope the sword and give him and it the power of lightbringer to destroy the army of the dead, OR due to the dragons mother dying, and jon now being the last living Targaryen, he will now be in control of the dragons and he will use them to fight off the Knight King.

&amp;#x200B;

Jon kills tyrion for conspiring with Cercei and Dany as a mercy death and then will use the dragons to destroy the white walkers. Therefore forging his sword in the heart of a lion, forging his sword in the heart of his lover, then wielding light bringer (dragons) to defeat the darkness (white walkers.)

&amp;#x200B;

For this to be true, first you must know a few things about the shows history. For those who don't know, the prophecy states that the prince that was promised (TPTWP) tempered his sword in both the water and the heart of a lion and the sword snapped both times. It was then with great sorrow he knew that he must temper his sword in the heart of his lover Nissa Nissa. After doing so, it says that her blood, soul, strength, and courage went into the steel and the sword became lightbringer the red sword of heroes. TPTWP then used the sword to fight off the darkness, as far as the legend goes.

&amp;#x200B;

It is then foretold that Azor Ahai will come again. He/She must be born under a bleeding star, be reborn amidst salt and smoke, will wield a fiery weapon (possibly lightbringer), wake sleeping dragons from stone, and according to the woods witch, must be born of Rhaella and Aerys' bloodline. There are several theories surrounding which character will be the second coming of the Azor Ahai. This ranges anywhere from Sam Tarly, to Euron Greyjoy, however the most popular characters are Jon Snow and Dany. Reason being is that in one way or another, they consistently fit every description of the prophecy.

&amp;#x200B;

We'll first go into how Dany could be TPTWP. First Dany was born on dragon stone, which if she is TPTWP, that would count as being reborn, and dragon stone fits the credentials as being next to the ocean (salt) and being the original seat of house Targaryen (smoke). Dany was also reborn in season one when she walks out of the dead Khal's pyre with her freshly hatched dragons. Due to how broad the text is in the prophecy, it is believed that specifications can be met at both the true birth of the character, as well as if and when they are reborn. Therefore it is in this moment of walking out of the Pyre, that she has fulfilled several details of the prophecy at once. She is reborn amidst both smoke (from the flames), under a red shooting star that shoots across the sky (bleeding star), and wakes dragons out of stone. This scene, paired with her being originally born on Dragonstone, covers 4 of the details that will fulfill this prophecy. She was also born of Rhaella and Aerys' bloodline, and to solidify the argument, Maester Aemon goes as far as to say that for all these years maesters and followers of the R'hllor (worshipers of the Lord of Light, aka Melisandre and other Red Priestesses) have been fixated on the word prince, therefor looking for a male. Yet, due to the translation from High Valyrian, and how dragons have no true gender, that the translation could have meant prince or princess that was promised, therefore giving Dany another edge to the claim of TPTWP.

&amp;#x200B;

However I believe that Jon has the stronger claim to TPTWP. Well start with Jon's true birth and as to how he was born under the bleeding star. For those who know, there is a special sword named Dawn from House Dayne, that gets passed down to the most worthy Knight in the family, and then that knight will bear the title of the Sword of the Morning. What's special about this sword, is that it was forged from metal from a falling star, and is said to be on par with Valyrian. During the war of the 5 kings, it was Sir Arthur Dayne that wielded Dawn, and was ordered by Rhaegar Targaryen to guard Lyanna in the Tower of Joy. As most of you know, Lyanna gave birth to Jon in the tower, and Sir Dayne was there to protect her, but dies in battle by Howland Reed and Ned Stark. After his Dayne's death, Ned picks up the bloody Dawn and rushes up the tower where he sets the bloody dawn propped against the bed. Therefore Jon was literally born under a 'bleeding star'. As far as salt goes, it is said that lyanna's tears in childbirth, can be said to resemble being born of salt. Later on in season 6 we see Jon get resurrected by the red priestess Melisandre. It can be said here that he was reborn of smoke due to the fire in the room, as well as having a priestess of the lord of light cut off his hair and throw it in the flames. As far as the book goes, it is said that bran the builder felt a drop from the wall when it was being built, and as it melted down to his tongue he states that it felt ""warm and salty."" it is then theorized that due to its geological location of being near the ocean, and due to the lower melting point of salt, that the wall could have been frozen from salt water. This seems like a stronger case compared to that of lyanna's tears. Therefore we now have the bleeding star, salt and smoke. Then, jon is also of the same bloodline as dany, which would make him born of Rhaella and Aerys' bloodline as well.

&amp;#x200B;

What finally sets Jon apart from Dany is something that Dany actually experiences in season 2 at the house of the undying. Dany has many visions, however one important vision from the books is left out of the show. In the books Dany sees a room with a man with silver hair (presumably Rhaegar) who says to another woman in the room nursing a baby ""Aegon...What better name for a kingHe is the prince that was promised, and his is the song of ice and fire""

&amp;#x200B;

For a while, this vision was taken rather literally as an actual event that took place between Rhaegar and Ellia Martell about their second child who was in fact named Aegon. However, like most of the visions, this was to be taken figuratively not literally. When converted to a metaphor, it is more likely that Rhaegar is actually speaking with Lyanna who is in fact nursing Jon. What makes this stand out, is that we find out in season seven that Lyanna actually named Jon Aegon as well. Now, due to jon being born from Lyanna of house Stark (Ice) and of house Targaryen (Fire), Jon is the only character in the realm to which the song of ice and fire could be associated to. (this is also what the entire series is called lol)

&amp;#x200B;

Now at this point, Dany and Jon share the same specifications that would allow both of them to fulfill the prophecy. This is where my theory takes over.

-There is a profecy and it says a promised Prince is coming, i don't think it's Jon since the profecies always turn to the most unexpected ways and if you follow that logic Gendry could be the promised Prince.  
-Cersei once ordered to kill all Robert's bastard sons. Why would she kill them? They where no threat for Joffrey's claim unless one of them is actually the heir of the kingdom.  
-*This is my most importabt proof* Gendry has the same eye colours that Cersei have, i don't think it's casuality and if you don't know that colour is hereditary.

I know reddit is the headquarters of trolls but it's definitive so talk your smack while you can because in 5 or 6 months I'll be vindicated. Dan and Dave told us in episode 1 how it ends. The first symbol the White Walkers leave is a combination of three symbols and they were communicating exactly what they want. Phi, Psi, and the symbol for the Female Gender. Phi means balance and is used for the golden ratio. Theres alao fibonacci spirals seen throuhhout the show but only dealing with 3 people. The NK ice, Dany, Fire, and Jon Snow ice and fire. Psi is used in mathematics as the inverse of the golden ratio. Within our story this is obvious ice and fire, which are polar opposites. Lastly, the symbol for the Female gender can easily be seen. All these symbols are mashed into one so what does it mean? Balance is achieved through opposites coming together, ice and fire through a female. Daenarys Targaryen will become the Night Queen with her Vayrian blood of the Dragon uniting with the Icy Night King, with Jon Snow as mediator. Balance will be achieved north of the wall and south. Ice and fire to the north through the NK and Dany and ice and fire to the south with Jon Snow. We see in the house of the undying Dany reach for the throne but leave to go north of the wall, to be with her undead husband Khal Drago foreshadowing her true destiny. The wall still stands for a reason. She will be queen, queen of the undead the White Walkers. There's also tons of other evidences both book and show but I'll leave it to the first symbol left in the first scene. The endgame was spelled out in 2011.

I normally dont like stories about the middle age. (Game of thrones takes place there, isnt it?) And so I didnt even think about starting it, but more and more of my friends are talking about it and saying how good it is. And of course I see all the hype in the Internet.
Although I never watched it my guess for the story is sth. like that: 
inrigues
sex and murder
people who fight over a throne
Ok, to summarize it, Im here to ask you guys, is this series really worth watching?
I dont have much time each week and I would be rather disappointed when its getting boring after the second season or so.

However, would they really reveal such a big thing in a teaser? I mean, there are two main questions that need to be answered by the end of show. 1) How will the White Walkers be defeated? 2) Who will sit on the Iron Throne? (If there is one left). So would they really just answer one of those questions in a teaser? Why would they?

Before the teaser, whenever I thought about Season 8, I would ask to myself ""I wonder how they'll stop the White Walkers?"" It was such a big mystery to me. But now, without even watching one minute of the season, thanks to a teaser, I'm supposed to know the answer to that big question? Just like that? I shouldn't. Why would they just outright tell us how the White Walkers will be stopped in a teaser?  It doesn't make sense. It has to be a misdirection to throw us off the scent. At least I hope.

I was warned many times and when me and my dad sat down to watch this episode we werent prepared for anything thinking that it was the last episode that would surprise us. But damn this episode is the best episode Ive seen so far. 

First off, Jon snows fight against the wildlings and then how he defeats them and abandons Ygritte with the help of the Brans control of the wolves is damn near perfect in every single way. Also that one shot when Jon says you were right this whole time is it actually one of the best shots and quotes of TV history. 

Then theres the wedding scene. The directors make us feel so happy for the Starks, with Arya about to be reunited with her family, Robb and Talisa talking about naming their son Eddard, Catelyn feeling happy and seeing her son in love, and even the bedding. Everything makes us feel so happy that we are completely oblivious to whats about to happen and the weirdness of the situation. We ignore two things: 1. Why has Walder Frey the man reputed as the most stubborn lord in the kingdom and also is loyal to only money has suddenly had a change of mind? And 2. Why does Roose Bolton whos supposed to be loyal to Robb Stark, decide to give the Lannisters Jamie back?

The second question gets answered right before the coup detat happens. Roose Bolton says that marrying his wife made him richer, basically stating hes in it for the money. Therefore he does not care about being loyal to Robb and would rather make the more strategic decision for the money. Which leads us to the final slaughter and the answering of the first question. Walder Frey [obviously] didnt have a change of mind but rather used the marriage as an opportunity to pull the sheets under Robb. 

The slaughter itself is rather magical. Everyone with blood gushing out of their throats, the music stopping suddenly with arrows being shot everywhere while the Starks finally realize whats going on. Then Catelyn gets up after receiving an arrow to the chest and holds Freys daughter hostage as she screams for Robb to run. This where the terrific acting comes in, Catelyns face becomes red with anger truly red. And you feel her sorrow and pain and Robb dies and then she slits Freys wifes throat and then her throat gets slit. 

Anyways thanks for reading I was just really amazed after watching that episode and wanted to share with you guys. 

Sorry for my writing it isnt the best. 

Please dont spoil episode 10 as I havent seen it yet. But once I see it Ill update this. 

Please also discuss below it truly is a great episode.

Khal Drogo ignored her when they rode, even as he had ignored her during their wedding, and spent his evenings drinking with his warriors and bloodriders, racing his prize horses, watching women dance and men die. Dany had no place in these parts of his life. She was left to sup alone, or with Ser Jorah and her brother, and afterward to cry herself to sleep. Yet every night, some time before the dawn, Drogo would come to her tent and wake her in the dark, to ride her as relentlessly as he rode his stallion. He always took her from behind, Dothraki fashion, for which Dany was grateful; that way her lord husband could not see the tears that wet her face, and she could use her pillow to muffle her cries of pain. When he was done, he would close his eyes and begin to snore softly and Dany would lie beside him, her body bruised and sore, hurting too much for sleep.

Day followed day, and night followed night, until Dany knew she could not endure a moment longer. She would kill herself rather than go on, she decided one night

Theres so many characters and subplots that its difficult to remember all the things that have happened in the show.  

My ideal schedule would put me into a position to be watching the last episode of season 7 minutes before the premier of season 8.  I think this is overly optimistic and going to be difficult to do since I cant find the exact date of the season 8 premier and it will be difficult to time watching 67 episodes to, what amount to a moving date.  So Ive made a couple of assumptions based on how to watch the show to get ready for season 8.

This might be helpful for anyone getting into the show for the first time as well.

The two pieces of data that we have are a release date of April 2019, and the fact that there are 67 episodes.  

Im going to assume that most people reading this are able to binge a show, that is, watch way more television than is healthy, to the point of maybe forgetting to feed the cat or not watching the news.

Since we dont know when the newest season will debut, Im going to make an assumption (and I could be totally wrong) that the soonest it will debut will be Sunday, April 7th.  Im also going to make the assumption that we will find out the date of the premier no later than sometime in March 2019.  This will be important because it may accelerate our binge.

Now there are some people who do not have jobs or have a massive amount of free time that can literally watch 67 hours of television in a week.  Im going to assume that if youre reading this, that is not the case. 

I cant assume everyones viewing habits or schedules so Im going to break down four scenarios that I think will be helpful.

1. An episode a day.  Much faster than the show itself played out on HBO.

2. Two episodes a day.  This is almost a feature film every night and is a pretty healthy binge schedule (the most Ive ever done in a night on a single show has been 5 episodes)

3. A season a week.  This is a little more relaxed than #2, and for me, a little more realistic.  It will give you a bit of buffer is something like University Finals or something comes up and will be helpful in case HBO releases it sooner than I predict.

4. Full Romo.  4+ episodes a day.  Youre either A) didnt realize that the show was starting up in April B) got into the show late, got addicted and need to get caught up C) just want to go balls out and have the ability to put this much television into your life (hey, Im not judging)

Under Scenario 1, you need to start no later than *Jan 30th*.  How youre going to only watch one a night is beyond me, because some of them are just too good not to skip to the next one!

With Scenario 2, you would need to start by *March 5th*.  Keep in mind this would actually finish you on April 6th and doesnt allow for what I want to do; finish season 7 RIGHT before the season 8 premier (easily fixable). 

Scenario 3 means you start the Sunday of *February 17th*.  Keep in mind, youll need to pace yourself if you want to finish the very last episode on April 7th.  This plan also allows you to increase your binge rate to about scenario 2 (2 a day), if HBO deciders to move the premier up.  It also gives enough wiggle room in case you miss a night or two due to unforeseen circumstances.  Keep in mind, this is still ten episodes a week (except for season 7, which is 7 episodes) which is a healthy amount of TV.  One anight Monday through Thursday with double showings Friday through Sunday.

Scenario 4 means you start at least by *March 22nd* and youre just going to go balls out.  

Thoughts? Suggestions? Possible shows that might conflict if someone had a limited amount of time? (Off the top of my head, Im thinking Star Trek Discovery or maybe NFL playoffs).  Anything that I missed?

1. They would overanalyse it and probably figure it all out (season 6 and 7 guesses were rediculously accurate)

2. There are already a shitton of theories so one of them or more likely many of them are partially true.

3. D&amp;D suck now without source material, so there's probably fanfic that's way better than what they actually made.

They pushnig it as far as they can and probably prepared a very mislieading trailer. but folks like 'The new Rockstars' or 'AltShiftX' or some subreddits will figure it all out by the trailer. It's bound to happen.

If you make a mistake, you die. 

Ned made the mistake of challenging Cersei, he died.

Robb made the mistake of marrying a foreigner, which was the downfall of his campaign and ended in his death.

Jon Snow makes the mistake of not listening to what his brothers in the nightwatch want, so then they started a mutiny and killed him.

Oberyn Martell died making a mistake underestimating The mountain.

Plot armor doesnt exist in GRRMs writing, if a character is in a sticky situation, they might die, like real life.

As of late it feels like D&amp;D have given all of the main cast plot armor, there has been a whole bunch of dangerous situations that people made it out alive against all odds (Jaime vs Drogon, Ballista Bronn vs Drogon, Jon after being left behind)

I feel like the plot armor takes away the risk factor and emotional stress we used to feel with the story, and its sad that its ending this way. ",30,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

They were both born to Rhaegar and Lyanna, Lyanna dies in childbirth from loss of blood. 

Ned goes to StarFall with them when he disappeared for 7/8 months. 

The Queen Rhaella and Prince Viserys flee to DragonStone, she had a stillborn. 
(Which isnt unlikely, Shes has a lot of those.)

Varys will make a deal with Ned as it would already be impossible to pass her off as his own, Varys tells Viserys the truth, (about Dany only) he is told that Daenerys will be used to take back the Throne and she must be his sister. 

In book one it is said Dany remembers a red door and lemon tree, lemon trees grow in Dorne, not Braavos. (If this was a mistake G.R.R.M made as he didnt know the map yet then why did he continue it?)

And also, Viserys needed to be convinced by Illyrio in B1 when he thought she didnt look like a princess. (A true Targaryen) because shes only half Targaryen. 

When Jon met drogon I think Daenerys will have a similar Ghost in S8.

I went DEEP down the rabbit hole. All the fighting over lands and thrones represents the culture of consumerism. It represents people scambling for pointless material objects. Buying and spending. I mean the characters start wars over land and birthrights. It's already pretty petty in it's own way. Motherfuckers be sending thousands to their deaths over some bullshit ""title"". Even Daenerys is guilty of that. The Red Wedding was basically a black friday sale. Jon Snow is Jesus, trying to take back Christmas from Santa (the Night King), and consumer whores everywhere (Cersie, the Boltons, etc). Santa, the Night King, is invading Westeros, because the people there have obviously been very naughty, and coal just isn't cutting it anymore. Joffrey was that ungrateful child who cries because he didnt get the thousand dollar present he wanted and would probably yell at his grandma for getting him socks. The Hound is the Grinch. Arya, his Cindy Lou Who.
 The children of the forest are obviously elves. Tyrion isn't an elf, but often gets mistaken for one by children around christmas time, and sometimes gets accused of being an angry elf.

I always wondered why they would make this so. 

Well if the final piece of the puzzle happens at the God's Eye which I think it will, then we all know the God's eye is on an small island surrounded by none other than WATER.

ACT: 1. I believe the NK will be defeted in Winterfell but they realize defeating him doesn't destroy all of the whights like they thought. So they flee winterfell 

ACT:2 They realize they have to go to the God's Eye because they further realize they have to make a sacrifice there, and make a new Night Queen or King because there always has to be one. They do this and in the same area a huge Dragon Glass wall is made to separate the NEW king or queen in the North with the south. 

ACT: 3. Cersei and King's Landing is dealt with. 

I will break this down in more detail soon. But this gives up 3 acts and no missing space in between winterfell and traveling to kings landing. We get 3 acts with constant action in 3 equal amounts of travel.

I've just finished binge-watching the show for the first time, and thought I'd start sharing some of my opinions with this community.

Bran has been bothering me for a while, and I wanted to know whether other people shared my sentiment. Does he seem like he has lost his personality and become the embodiment of exposition to anyone else? I mean, he even mentions he's not just Brandon Stark anymore, and his loss of identity is making me disconnected from him. 

It would be intriguing if they showed him going through an intense inner conflict, but it doesn't seem conveyed well to me. Most of the time, he's either brooding, being cryptic, or exposing stuff (like Littlefinger's plans and Jon's parentage). Now, the exposition itself isn't too bad, but I would have liked it better if he had visions without necessarily being all-knowing and sacrificing his personality.

I first heard it in season 6 and I was confused because I saw nothing romantic in Jon and Sansa scenes just a troubled sibling relationship.
I simply thought because Kit and Sophie and good looking people wanted them to bang and didnt put much thought into it.
But then I saw in depth analysis of the theory and people who hav read the books saying its gonna happen and I got even more confused.
Only way I could see it happening is if Jon married Sansa not because of lust but to protect her from another men.
But Jonsa shippers actually want them to get romantic.
And now Jon is with Dany Ive seen people say Jon will be disgusted that Dany is his aunt and marry Sansa.
Which makes no fucking sense because its still incest and they have a brother sister relationship.
I just dont see how Starks can grow up as siblings and get together.

If  so, did they do this possibly because with the loss of Valyria the  culture and history was gone and they didn't know any other names, so  they had to settle for derivatives that were 'close enough'?

The  Valeryons for the most part seem to have very Westerosi names, save for  maybe Daenaera who likely inspired Daenerys, or they just mashed up her  name with Naerys.

Like do you think  there are root-words with individual meanings in Valyrian, like the  Welsh word 'gwyn' for example being in Gwyneth, Gwynogg, Gwyneira,  Gwynhyfar, etc?

If not, then what do you  think was the significance of having a few Targs with outlier names,  that were never used again, like Alysanne and Duncan?

I just found it interesting that Robb being Ned's son seems to have done the less ""honorable"" thing than Jon in somewhat similar situations. Both had made promises and yet Robb broke his for the sake of whom he loved while Jon did not.

Now Jon's feelings towards Yigritte were not as intense as Robb's towards Talissa, but still had Jon broken his oath to the Night's Watch it seemingly would have served him better (from his perspective). He would have gotten to live freely with Yigritte and escape the miserable life with the Night's Watch where early death was certain. However, his decision to run back to the Night's Watch and leave behind the only woman he has ever been with and loved was something Ned would have done in his place.

On the other hand, Robb's decision to break his promise to Walder Frey and act on his strong feelings towards Talissa is not as serious as breaking the oath to the Night's Watch but had he not broken it, (from his perspective) it would have served him better or at least he would have lived longer. From what we know of Ned Stark, he may very likely have carried on and married Walder Frey's daughter. 

I may be wrong about this but this did feel obvious as both storylines happen simultaneously

I kept hearing this sound that sounded very familiar.

Recently I watched some scenes on YouTube randomly and found the sound again.

I swear it sounds just like the Roblox ""OOF"" meme, and I believe an audio engineer put it in their as a joke or easter egg.

Also, I am still in shock over what just transpired. First of all, I am confused as to why Bran turned into a raven and tried to attack Jon Snow as he rode away. I am also confused about why Jon abandoned his woman. The scene where Robb gets killed was pretty mesmerizing; I couldnt look away. I never really trusted Frey and I guess I shouldve known Game of Thrones better than that but even though the thought of ambush did cross my mind, I didnt think they would really kill Robb and Catelyn like that.

There a whole bunch of people who could be appropriate but I thought Id challenge you all to speculate on the implications of what may happen depending on who that Regent would be. Pick a name from the list below and give your idea for what would happen after the show if that person was regent.

1. Sansa  As the heir to House Stark and Jon's most senior relative Sansa is appointed guardian of her second cousin.

2. Arya  Jon always felt closer to Arya than to any of his other siblings and asks her to raise his child.

3. Cersai  When the great war against the White Walkers is over Cersai is the last noble standing. After the death of her own child Cersais grief leads her to takes Jon and Danys child into her care.

4. Jaime  Jaime proves himself the Hero of the war against the WWs and becomes close with Jon, slowly dying on the battlefield, Jon entrusts Jaime to protect his child.    

5. Tyrion  Both Jon and Dany see Tyrion as their wisest and most compassionate advisor, they decide that it would be in their childs best interests if Tyrion was its guardian.

6. Davos  As the kindest and most level headed man in Westeros and with a close affinity to children, Davos is seen as a great father figure to raise Jon and Danys child.

7. Varys  Varys has always yearned for a King that would serve the people, he sees an opportunity to mould the perfect monarch by training Jon and Danys child.

8. Bron  With everyone that knows better dead Bron steps in and pronounces himself the guardian of the King. Nobody else knows what to do and lets it happen, sitting in the Red keep Bron finally gets his castle.",19,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

The Shadow Called no One.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/a57taq/got_spoilers_jaqen_hgar_rhaegar_targaryen_the/,ChosenfromAshes,1544542493,"How to start, haha. I think I might have found Something tonight while reading a few stuff and going through old scnes of GOT. I just want you to keep in mind all the time that these two could be the same, just look at the physical similarities for once, abilities to swap face etc... But there's way more than that tbh, sorry for my horrible English btw dear readers. Rhager facinates me, in many ways because he is the character that we hear about the most that hasn't been seen, I mean, who has done the most. I think this theory clears alot of things, but also makes gives the plot of GOT away litterally and alot of things can come out of it. Rhaegar was born at the tragedy of Summerhall, wich was at the time a very contreversial event to say the least, with the death of many that were, in the book honorable. Duncan the Tall, The King Aegon V The unworthy, etc. Some said there was sorcery going on to hatch an egg, alot of things could have happened and some even speculated about a Blackfire Fucking things up, basicly. 
So you get the guy is born Under the most bad event you can get, I mean everyone but his father and some others were left alive, but you get the point. Rhaegar, very Young becomes facinated with books and all that, so he learns real Young about lot's of things, keep that in mind, cause it's quite important to know that not many have the knowledge he had. After that I think Aeris got crazy once he saw Tyrion the first time. Ik it sounds a bit crazy, but knowing the lust he had for the wife of Tywin Lanister, I think personnally a king with many known mistresses could easly find a way to get away with her. Also knowing he couldn't make decent childs anymore due to his bloodline being cursed, Something told by the wood witch btw, imagine the reaction he had once he saw that kid knowing it was his, so I think it Added to the mad king part. Beside, Tywin had no reasons to keep the kid other than shame the one that shamed him, basicly. Funny that Cersei was shamed later on. So yeah, basicly with that Rhaegar and his father are not working anymore together you know, why would a man so intelligent work with him ? Only to get what he wants. And if you look at the history, Rhaegar stayed loyal to his father until the end, that's what the story says. Also take notice he already knew of the prophecy of the prince that was promised, knowing the way to defeat the walkers, was by creating the Three headed Dragon, wich is the sigil of the targaryen's. So he basicly had to find a wife, and he first thought Elia Martel was a great pick I guess. Well, that didn't go well since, I guess Dragon's Don't do well with Snakes, wich is the sigil of the Martell's. Then there's the knight of the laughing three event wich basicly, I think was the keypoint where Rhaegar found what he was looking for. This guy didn't do it for love I think with Elia, but this time with Lyanna it would be different ? Sorry but a master manipulator stays one, trust me on that. If you follow this mindset, if he knew he was going to disapear because of the struggles of his father, he knew he had to do what he could to do it at any cost. This guy didn't kidnap Lyanna but I think he was the kind of guy that literally manipulated it's way into the wolf's den, like he did with the Snake, and could have done with the Lion if he wanted Or maybe he did, maybe the one who did raped the wife of Tywin was Rhaegar all along, wich is why it drived Aerys even madder. Idk, could make sense if you think about it. I don't think canceling a wedding is something you can do either really properlly, but then again, if he had a plan in mind to disapear, it all makes sense ! Daenerys once had a vision of him in the book where he was on a black stalion, with red glowing eyes Under his helmet who looked like Vicerys. To me that sound's like Satan or Sauron btw just saying. When she got closer to him, she saw her face. Keep that event in mind too guys, but to me that was the early tip that things aren't what they seem all the time.
When the war errupts, Rhaegar did probably many things. He knew he was not the one who was going to fufill the prophecy, he knew he was going to be in trouble with the Lyanna situation, I mean he still maried her in secret, impegnated her and kept her in the tower of Joy with the best swordsmen available to keep her safe in Ser Arthur Dayne. Now Idk alot of monarchy and all that but to me if your best warrior isn't even on the battlefield and kept to the sideline to protect a girl and his child, it means alot of things ; First that Rhaegar had more influence than Aeris and everyone saw him as the next ruler, so that would explain the situation, and also it means that Rhaegar really needed this child to be borned, even if she died. 
So with that, we know he died at the trident. At least that's what the people say, but it could have been a faceless. I think it was, he was seen at the red keep beforehand btw, and that's where I think he decided to become truly no one. Wearing someone's face, and basicly dying his hair, he could have become just a prisoner in the keep waiting to be freed one day. No one really paid attention to those anyway I guess. Then again it could have been organised by someone who often ventures in the keep, in Varys who shaved his head, knows alot about Braavos, shady stuff, etc. The fact he also follows Tyrion makes it creepy, because the Varys is a Blackfire could make even more sense, and explain his rise to the council. From the shadows Rhaegar could have pulled the strings with him and Littlefingers, who I think was a squire who was jealous of him, but admired him. A rat and a spider working with 'No One', that sounds pretty neat to me. I mean the faceless are basicly the best spies you can get, I hardly think someone like Littlefinger and Varys Don't know about it. Beside, not many people do say Valar Morghulis, just look at who does. Many think Littlefinger also is a guy that was working for the Iron Bank, that makes sense, it's also it's Braavos Btw. What else is there ? The faceless hall wich wasn't built I guess by Slaves. Remember when Jaqen walked in the street as some black dude wearing a weird outfit to ward off thieves who wanted Aria's ass and pigeon ? Well these guys knew who he was even with this face, so I must imagine at some point alot of people knows about him or whatever he's doing there. Beside, WTF is he doing on Westeros if he controls all that place. Why was he kept in the red keep, only to be sent later to the wall ? Well, Ned is the one who made the order to freed prisoners and Jaqen was later freed by Aria, and we all saw the rest.
But he keeps saying he is no one, Truly. He serves the only god there is, Death, and to me that is knowledge people need to get in Westeros, some still Believe in the seven's, and we saw what that does with The Sparrow. He mentors Aria, season after season because he probably is aware of who she was since the begining. Maybe he planned to escape out to help her idk, but it's to conveniant for them to meet suddenly, this guy basicly caugh a kid with a shiny coin to make her learn how to kill like he did and turn her into no one, like him. Maybe also it has to do with littlefinger wanting to do things on his own at some point, because he does lie about Rhaegar and all his doing to make him look like a rapist, while those who look further see's him as a good man. He is neither. Remember his door ? Black and White. Symbolism. The place ? I saw a three, it's empty, dark It's really a good place for a shadow to live I think. Beside I mean if anyone in Braavos knows about the place and is affraid of it, then we know who leads it, cause fear does lead everything, wich again could explain the rise of the golden company, and many other stuff, cause this guy could literally control the Iron bank if he wants to. We saw how he can kill, quick and fast. He doesn't seem to enjoy it either, he works with some kind of code and even punishes Aria at some point by making her blind, with a POTION.
Yeah, a Potion. I found it weird too, then I looked over the character named Pate, named after a Legendary Knight btw. This guy stole a key, who I think was clearly important to the guy called the Alchemist, who offered him a GOLDEN FUCKING DRAGON for it, wich he accepted because he wanted to get laid with the inkeeper girl I think and was described as some kind of You know a guy that probably never did that before and dreams about it. And being a novice in the Citadel, that key was related to it, so once the Alchemist got it, Pate died afterward, giving us this quote. ;
""A Stranger. No One. Truly.""
To me it points that Jaqen is the Alchemist, and that this knowledge didn't get gained doing Nothing. The Pate now working in the Citadel is a Faceless now watching over Sam probably, watching what he could find. The iron bank is in his control, and at this point I think the little silver line in his hair, the name looking similar, it makes sense. And Bran Quote about Jon being Rhaegar son makes sense for that ; No one knows. He sure damn knows and his probably manipulating his way to get things done the way he wants to, I doubt Jon was revived for Nothing, and maybe he also has Something to do with it. Also, when Jaqen freed Aria, it was because she learned Something he also did ; She can be Aria Star, or no one. Good or bad. Maybe the Lyanna part in her sparkled interest too idk.
Sorry, Long filled with mistakes but I hope I may have found some clues on the one who claims he his no one ? In the end everyone is somebody that has a role, but this lonely handsome sir really is maybe the most well adapted villain I could have imagined. Jut think about it, basicly this guy was probably even more mad than his father, Always in sorrow when Younger, Learning about Something that he must have saw to Believe it to do all this. In the end I just think Jaqen is Rhaegar, as well as the alchemist, and might be the one holding all secrets.

In the end, Valar Morgulis makes much more sense too. All men must die How conveniant.",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Now the iron bank is something that's been talked about in Game of Thrones for a long time, but we specifically saw it come up in the first season with one of Ned's first scenes with the small Council. So it's important and I also think it's important to note that you have Bravos, and that's the city where the Iron bank is located as well as the Faceless Men. Now here's where it gets interesting.

Specifically, Syrio is the first sword of bravos, but why is he in King's Landing and why is he just a dancing master being an important man in Bravos? Well I think that Syrio is actually a faceless man and he is in King's Landing to Spy, kill, just get close to the small Council, or king and queen because of all if the debt the crown owes. The best way to do this and what he did was to disguise himself. So he became a dancing master because the Hand of the king needed one to train his daughter. Well in him hiring Syrio forel give Syrio that chance to be in the castle close to the king and queen.

Now Syrio's plan was cut short when all the drama happened with Neds betrayal, and he is forced to fight some of the kingsguard. Well it is supposed he is killed off screen by MT, but we actually never see this. Also he didn't kill any people of the kingsguard because he had a wooden sword, so there's really no reason to kill him so I think that MT just took him prisoner.

So basically I think that Syrio is Jaqen  h'ghar. When see jaqen h'ghar for the first time he has his face covered possibly because he's either still Syrio or he just made his transition to jaqen and he's got his face covered to hide it from the audience. I think at this point he is already plotting to escape and get back to Bravos when he recognizes Arya and from that point on the rest is history.

Now here's where everything comes into play. When Arya goes to Bravos Jaquen knows about her list. What's interesting is when they were in harrenhal he told Arya that she can give him three names and he will kill them. Well he's not allowed to take people because the faceless God didn't command it so why does he do this? I think it's only hinting at the parallels between Arya's list and The Faceless Men having lists in a similar way. I think it's interesting to note that the waif is asking her who's on her list and she specifically says are you sure that's all the people you want to kill because she potentially knows Cersei is on that list.

I think the faceless men let Arya go because Cersei is on her list of names and she is now Queen and since the debt is owed by the crown to the iron bank, they know that she's going to go kill Cersei which is what they want. Remeber that's what they want Jaqen was in KL in the first place. I think that he's sending our in his place this time to do it, and it's perfect for her story arc of getting the names crossed off her list.

The Faceless Men knew MT was going to be in Bravos, they wanted her to see he was there. When she did kill him and she mentioned that he killed her friend Syrio, she shoved something in his mouth so he couldn't talk. I thonk this is because if he did he might have told that he actually didn't kill him. The writers did this on purpose just like everything else.

But must he really have followed that course of action? Why not freeze the lake and send the legions or instead take out our heroes with javelins or other ice projectiles and then reanimate them as wights and station them on their rock as a ruse, with the other undead on the edge of the water, such that Dany might think they're holding out waiting for rescue? I wouldn't think her eyes would be sharp enough to immediately resolve-at that distance-that jon and his crew are actually undead, therefore aborting the resue immediately before firing at the other wights and giving the NK his shot.

I'm fairly certain that Rhaegal and Viserion will fight it out, resulting in both dragons dying, leaving Dany with only Drogon left. 

I have another theory, that I seriously hope happens, because it would be awesome. So you know how Euron left to go to Essos to pick up The Golden Company? What if Daario Naharis is the leader of those sellswords. It makes a lot of sense in many ways. 

1. It stops them having to introduce a new character (with only 6 episodes they wouldn't have time to give a new character a good arc.

Even just googling a name once gave me what I think is going to be a serious spoiler about Jon Snow! 

It gives the show a lot more depth to me to know more about the histories and character relationships,  but I'll accept my ignorance if it means no spoilers. 
So my question is this. Is there any place online that I can safely look up info about characters and not risk getting critical info spoiled. I'm imagining a site that you enter in what episode or season you've watched and it will tell you what you are supposed to have learned up to that point? ",6,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

However, in essence, I believe it will be Arya who ends her life.

She will use her faceless assassin skills (perhaps using Jaime's face) to breach the constituency of the Red Keep, and when confronted with the chance, will reveal her face to Cersei (as she likes to do before killing her victims, such as with Meryn Trant and Walder Frey for example), and Arya will recall the scene with Joffrey from season 1 where he was tormenting her friend, who had no sword and just a stick, which he dropped on Joffrey's arrival. To which Joffrey responded with ""pick up your sword"", cruelly forcing the boy to use his disadvantage as if it would save him. Since Arya regrets not being able to kill Joffrey herself, I believe she will take it out on his mother, who now looks and behaves like him more than ever, and force the same poetic justice she meant for Joffrey, on Cersei. 

I presume Arya will dispatch some Queensguards nearby, probably in the throne room, and then tell Cersei ""Pick up your sword"" in the same manner Joffrey mocked her helpless friend.

However, Cersei as we have seen is not the type of character who you want to give even one inch of space to, or else she'll use it to her advantage (such as when Tyrion counseled Daenerys to save her might and use slow tactics, which ended up costing her half her army). Cersei is like a slippery snake, and giving her the slightest room is dangerous. But Arya will not be able to help this - I believe her arrogance will finally catch up to her, as she has indeed been on a roll for two seasons now. And with our favorite characters, such auspiciousness is always counterweighted by reality. Cersei actually goes to pick up the sword, and as she does, Arya immediately lunges and attempts to stab Cersei in the neck with Needle as she's bending over, but out of reflex, Cersei will fearfully cover her face with her hand, which gets in the way of the thrust and instead results in Arya's sword impaling her hand (don't believe the likelihood of this? There have been several instances in real world history where men who were forced to go up against sword masters much more skilled than them, and who they knew they stood little chance against, so chose to purposefully impale their hand on their opponent's sword, stalling them long enough to retaliate. Also sprinkle in the fact that Game of Thrones is meant to be a story about how fantasy situations would REALLY play out). Arya will attempt to remove her sword and strike again, but Cersei actually manages to stab her in the abdomen, more as a result of Arya running into it than something Cersei meant to do, sending Arya on her back as the combatively inexperienced queen drops the longsword, too concerned with her wound to do anything else, kneeling in agony. But before Arya can bleed out, she reaches for her Valyrian steel dagger and throws it at Cersei's throat.

I believe Cersei will tumble down the steps of the iron throne, and her death pose will be her bloodied hand reaching out in the direction of her crown that fell inches away from where she did, symbolizing her relentless determination to hold on to and die for the last thing she had left - power. 

https://i.redd.it/swhdcktx4w321.jpg

We then get a zoomed out view of the two bodies parallel, as a somber mix of ""House Stark"" and ""The Rains of Castamere"" ensues, symbolizing the deaths of a wolf and a lion.

I believe it is very suiting and fits the story line quite well, as the two characters are more alike than most realize - both have lived their entire lives relenting the typical, boring things expected of them as women, both wishing they could instead be more like knights, wielding more power. This is even pointed out sometime earlier when Tywin Lannister laughed at Arya saying ""most girls are stupid"" and replied with ""you remind me of my daughter"".

The past several weeks I've been burying myself in re-watching the series and catching up with some notes others have taken and various vlogs etc.  For the record I've also read the books but it's been ages...

I was thinking that there is going to be some "" good "" ending despite George rr Martin saying it's going to be bittersweet.

The more I think about it the less I think it's going to be something we suspect ( unless HBO diverts completely from Martin's vision)

I don't like spoilers so I avoid those but I love theories..

Ok.  So I don't think anyone ends up on the throne.  I think most of the world dies.  I'm undecided on what happens to Jon and Dany.  I don't think they both live.  I think we will see a new world thankfully.  

I love Dany but I think she's going to turn on Jon or go for the throne ( despite her previously saying she wants to break the wheel). 

I think there are going to be huge revelations about winterfell and night King / white walkers as well as lost or forgotten Stark history.  I think night's king may need healing and not killed

I suspect Danny may sacrifice herself.  I see jon living.

This is grr Martin, so it's going to be a complicated unpredictable ending ( which means I'm wrong lol) and not black/white good/ bad.  I suspect there will be some kind of message at the end.

That whole bran is night King is b.s.  

Oh how I wish I could go to HBO's premiere.  Or WESTEROS",11,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

In the opening scene, we see this image that the white walkers made: [https://imgur.com/a/TS56dmm](https://imgur.com/a/TS56dmm)

I think the heads on the sticks and the circle represent the isle of faces (the heads on sticks are the weirwood trees). Something important happened at the isle of faces--that's where the pact was signed! 

Another symbol the white walkers make in this opening scene, is here: [https://imgur.com/a/HL3k84E](https://imgur.com/a/HL3k84E)

If you'll notice, this child is pinned to the tree in the same way that the knight king was pinned to the tree when the children of the forest created him. It looks like the child is pinned to the tree in the chest just like the knight king

The white walkers Also leave this spiral symbol: [https://imgur.com/a/LSZa8nu](https://imgur.com/a/LSZa8nu)

That spiral symbol is also referencing the gods eye, which looks like this, the same spiral: [https://imgur.com/a/RGCcEbl](https://imgur.com/a/RGCcEbl)

Lastly, we have this imagery created by the white walkers: [https://imgur.com/a/IwLN7Jv](https://imgur.com/a/IwLN7Jv)

Why not have this person become a wight? They left this in an attempt to communicate something! But what? Perhaps its referencing a weirwood tree! The bleeding face is in the trunk of the tree!

I frankly don't like spinoffs, but I think this idea would work since it ties up a mystery:

Set in the midst of season 7, this story would be about the Unsullied trekking back to Daenerys after retreating from Casterly Rock. While the army retreats, Euron Greyjoy (or maybe another villainous character) ruthlessly hunts them down. Throughout the show, the starving Unsullied's numbers would dwindle as they desperately try to survive. Of course Greyworm would be the main character and we would actually see him scared for his troops as random attacks from the villain would happen.  The series would only be around 10 episodes and would actually show how they made it back to Dragonstone (which has always bugged me).

I've recently been rewatching the last season for the first time and a particular scene confused me.

Queen Cersei goes straight from the dungeons where she has killed one of the Sand Snakes with a poisoned kiss to Jaime where she insists on passionately kissing him, despite his reluctance.

So, first point of confusion, surely there has to be a connection between the kiss of death she has just given the Sand Snake and the violent, passionate kiss she insists on giving Jaime, with lips that only minutes before were tainted with literal poison.

I get that her blood is up but is this also a hint that she blames Jaime for her daughter's death? That Jaime is in danger? In terms of screen time it's less than two minutes between kisses and there are no intervening scenes.

Not content with kissing his lips she then insists on kneeling down in front of him and, well, proceeding with fellatio - again with Jaime professing reluctance. Which brings me to my second point of confusion.

Cersei is now Queen in her own right. She is the most politically powerful she has ever been and is recognised as such across the land. She holds the power of life and death over all her subjects and enjoys this power that she has always craved. While she can see her hold on power is fragile this only makes her want to hold onto it even more. She has just won revenge over the killer of her daughter and this is the moment so chooses to get on her knees before someone she doesn't like very much and take him in her mouth. Really?

It seems like a very submissive or at the very least giving sexual act for such a woman to perform \*on her knees\*.

I'm not saying that performing fellatio is degrading only that this particular act performed in this particular way seems to jar with everything else that is going on in her life right now. She doesn't throw him on a bed or desk and ravish him, she doesn't demand he perform an act on her, but she forcibly uses her (until recently deadly) mouth upon him even as he expresses doubts.

What am I missing?

&amp;#x200B;

GRRM made sure to come out and say that Targaryens can burn and the reason she didn't was magical not because of her blood.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure i missed something, But he was the one protecting Dany at first and i don't really understand why he would send the wine man to posin her after protecting her for so long. Doesn't seem to me that it was planned for Jorah to save her and he was actually trying to kill her.

&amp;#x200B;

My thoughts are he knew she was a fake. Killing her would spark the Dothraki to fight. While the real Targaryen baby would take the throne once the fighting stopped and the Dothraki returned home. But he ""Always serves the realm"" and eventually saw that Dani would be a fantastic leader so he sends Tyrion to help her. Decides to never tell the real Targaryen girl her parentage.

&amp;#x200B;

IMO he will realize that it is best if Jon and Dany rule together and that only happens if he tells the truth. I am rewatching trying to find things to disprove me theory but i know there are some redditors who have much better memories. Wondering if there has ever been any evidence that fully claims her to the Targaryen throne. Several times they state she was to young to ever remember her parents or the capitol. Whilst her brother remembers it a bunch. If she was an infant he probably wouldn't know the difference.

&amp;#x200B;

Also the bathtub scene: If she and her brother were bathing together (As i'm sure they did) He probably loved it really really hot and so she may of grown used to it. It wasn't like the water was boiling or anything",35,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I'm not sure if this has been said already, but here goes:

Bran keeps going back in history trying to change it with yelling, but instead causes the things go the way they have already gone. [This video talks about that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1mFoDK4sUQ). Bran told Hodor to ""Hold the door!"" and after repeatedly yelling it, it turned simply into ""Hodor""

Well, what if Bran goes back to the Mad King to warn about the Night King and the army of the dead, and that makes him yell ""Burn them all!""

At one point Robert Baratheon asks Jamie if the Mad King said something before Jamie killed him and he answered:

""He said the same thing he'd been saying for hours: 'Burn Them All'.""

That's all he said for hours. I think this is similar loop as Hodor saying ""Hodor"". 

**My theory is, The Mad King saying ""Burn Them All"" was originally something more elaborate, a way to defeat the Night King, but it got abbreviated to ""burn them all"" and in the end the history repeats itself and they're fucked.**

I don't know. As I wrote this, I already started doubting it. So Bran figures the way to defeat them (probably with help from Sam) but as he goes back to the Mad King with the advice, he makes everything that has already happened, happen the same way again. ""The ink has already dried"", Like the Three-Eyed Raven before Bran said.

Just a thought. I bet there's more to it, as this would be a despairing way to end.

As the title states, I just finished season 7. I have a lot of questions and Im sure you have answers. Forgive me for any misspellings. These questions dont necessarily come from season 7 but I wanted to wait until the end to see if any explanations would pop up before asking. 

- Why did Margeary not get her hair cut before her confession, and was she going to have a confession at all had the army not shown up? 

-How do the faces work? Does someone have to be dead to have a face? How do you get their face if they arent dead? Why cant Arya just pretend to be Jaime and kill Cersei or pretend to be a white walker and kill the Night King (if they have faces)? 

-How did Bran just forget to see that Jon was a Targaryen and need Samwell to remind him? Isnt he the mighty omniscient Three Eyed Raven? Did people really used to have names like Samwell or is it a made up name like Aegon? 

-Why can the Night King touch Bran? Does his touch mean that the magic guarding them from past the wall isnt safe anymore, just like in the tree? In that case why couldnt uncle Benj come back? Why does Jon HAVE to know that he is a Targaryen? Is he safe from fire? 

-Why didnt Danaerys just breathe the Night King to death with fire instead of focusing on his army? If you can fly, you should go for the leader right? Soldiers are simply there to protect the leader. 

I recognize that there are a lot of questions and I would appreciate any answers. ",42,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I recently discovered Sandor and Gregor are real life brothers, who are members of the -Austrian- Romanian Royal House. Sandor is the eldest. He created a charity called the Flame Of Peace.  This cannot be a coincidence.

The real life brothers are blood relatives, they have the same parents. 

https://gw.geneanet.org/cepatri?lang=en&amp;n=von+habsburg+lothringen&amp;oc=0&amp;p=sandor 

This is their father. The father grew up in Brans Castle in Transylvania, aka  Draculas Castle. 

Here is the wiki for the dad, showing the information for the sons. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_von_Habsburg

Heres info for the charity - http://www.flameofpeace.org/page.php?[en]7 

Note the color of the Icon in relation to Clegane Banner.

Also, it seems to me that Bran Castle is a representation for The Vale.  Bran Gorge is clearly the gorge leading to the Bloody Gate.

One more thing, the two brothers have a half-sister. Their father remarried and adopted her.",4,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Other than murdering an entire house, one of the most influential/politically relevant in Westeros. The Freys, yes, but its still an act that should have reverberated throughout the kingdoms. Apparently neither the Lannisters nor the North seem to give it a second thought.

It would have been interesting to see how Sansa- reserved, collected and fully aware of the risk of drawing Cerseis wrath-would have responded to her sister effectively provoking outright war by attacking a key Lannister protectorate/ally. Remember, Arya told the Frey girl to spread word that the Starks perpetrated the massacre. This should have angered Cersei and elevated her paranoia. It should have poisoned the Kings Landing talks with Jon. It would have made for more substantial ammo for Jons detractors in Winterfell, than simply their anger at his female soldier policy or how he resolved land disputes. And it would have provided actual grounds for the intensity of the schism between Arya and Sansa: differing understandings/approaches to handling dangers to their house. Arya is a murder machine at this point and Sansa is supposed to have become a cold, calculating tactician who sees the butterfly effect of every action",9,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Now that I have put the visual out there, i expect some people think that would look pretty epic. Because when it popped into my head I thought it would make a great poster. But then I had a horrible realisation that it could occur. Almost every time I comment that I don't want to see anyone we love on the Iron Throne at the end, i get a lot of downvotes. But I don't say it because I want the heroes to fail, I just don't see the Iron Throne as the final prize.

My hope is that they are moving away from a feudal society entirely. I'd like to see them establish a government and destroy the Iron Throne. 

Every time Dany tried to take power it seems to have backfired. But she got power when she demonstrated her strength and people *chose* to follow her. And we like Jon because he is elected into power, he doesn't demand it. When he was elected Lord Commander it was by a tiny margin, but it was a much easier win when he became King of the North as he had shown his skills to everyone and they had faith in him. Talk of ""breaking the wheel"" and the positive bias in the show to electing leaders makes me think this is how the show should be going. But with a huge portion of the fan base expecting a king/queen, I fear they may go the other way.

My hope for an equally visually impressive final scene would be Dany melting the Throne with Drogon, then flying off. Perhaps to continue her job as protector of the realm to make sure no-one tries to reestablish a feudal society.

I'm talking about the when Euron captures the two dornish women and Yara (I'm on my phone and getting lazy and tired of googling names), when the lannisters took High Garden and when they attacked Casterly (still lazy) Rock only to find an empty city.

The first one I can sort of understand. It's hard to ""follow"" ships, but the plans had to have been discussed and Varys has almost literally known everything about everyone up until now. 

Casterly Rock is harder to forgive. You mean to tell me that every man, woman, and child, save for a handful of soldiers, were evacuated and none of Varys's spies knew about it? I find that very hard to believe. 

How the hell did the Lanisters attack High Garden without Varys getting wind of it?

Clegane bowl ending in an epic battle is too predictable and generic a way for Sandor's story to end.

The truth is Clegane bowl has been going on for a while now. It started when Gregor pressed his brothers face against burning coal. Sandor's mark is a big part of what shaped his life. As a Clegane he was always meant to eventually serve as a sword for the Lannisters, but we see a gentler side of him in the way he treats Sansa, imagine what kind of person the hound would be if he never had his face burnt. The man that rode down the butcher's boy and wanted to kill Bronn for no reason wouldn't exist.
 If the Clegane bowl has been going on for a while now, who's winning? Well it started with Gregor winning but I think that's flipped. Here's why.

Sandor started out the Clegane bowl on the losing side, and for the first few seasons it stayed that way. See back then the battle was about who was stronger, crueler and a better asset to Tywin. Sandor could never compete with Gregor in this respect because deep down he wasn't an evil man to begin with. Lets look at how he treated Sansa. He rescued Sansa from rapists even though he didn't have to. He stopped her from pushing Geoffrey, saving her punishment. He looked visibly uncomfortable when she was stripped and wrapped her in his own cloak after the beating. He also tried to take her with him when fleeing King's Landing but respected her decision when she said no. 
With Arya; he nabbed her to ransom back to her family, but as time went on his objective with Arya became less about saving her for money and more about caring for her out of genuine compassion.

During season 4 Clegane bowl begins to turn on its head.
Gregor; strong, mean, ruthless and fearsome. Is still all those things but now is losing what little humanity he had left. He's been turned into a zombie knight (someone should make a game out of this) and is basically a soulless husk covered in tonnes of hard muscle. 

When we see Sandor return in The Broken Man, the change is clear for all the world to see. He's renounced his evil ways but unfortunately has no direction. You see this is where Sandor begins to beat his brother, he realized that this whole time he's been losing the Clegane bowl because he was playing by his brother's rules. He's decided to no longer follow the path of brutish violence and hurting people to get want you want. 
Sandor's turn around is finalised when he runs into the brotherhood once again. While Sansa had brought out some of the good in Sandor (in short bursts) and Arya had made him question his ways, it was the company of men, men who had seen war and carnage, men who had similar pasts of killing innocents, men like the one who saved him and Beric Dondarrion, these were the men Sandor needed to be around and learn from.
I can't even describe the wave of emotions that run through me when he buried that family he had beaten and robbed all the way back in season 2.

As we approach season 8 what has become of Sandor?
He's followed the brotherhood north of the wall, risking his life for no gain. He's buried the family he once wronged. He even speaks some sense into Gendry when he wants to wet his pants. He no longer holds grudges against those who wronged him (Brienne), he judges himself for his actions and he no longer hates his brother. Don't get me wrong, he has no love for the mountain but he's no longer driven by burning passionate hatred. He has Sansa, Arya and the brotherhood. He's found inner peace and companionship. All the things his life as the Hound denied him he has now found.
When the Cleganes met during the war negotiations Sandor said to the mountain ""You know who's coming for you"" I don't think he was referring to himself, but I haven't come up with a convincing reason for him to say that so let me hear your thoughts there.

Sandor Clegane has had one of the most impressive character arcs in this show and it's one I only truly paid attenttion to during my annual rewatch of the whole series. With Sandor being a different man now, seeking his brother out for vengeance would be a huge step back for his character. He's already won the Clegane bowl, he won it by playing by a different set of rules, which was moving on. And so as much as we'd all love to see an epic fight scene between these giants it simply shouldn't happen, for Sandor's sake and for the sake of brilliant writing.

Let me know your thoughts on this. And tell me what you think about the ""you know who's coming for you line"".

    Yet our way is the older way. The blood of the First Men still flows in the veins of the Starks, and we hold to that belief that the man who passes the sentence shall swing the sword Eddard (more commonly known as Ned) Stark lived by a code of honor, based of what his father had done and what his fathers father had done. Ned was a family man who thought what was best for his family. Ned brought his son out to see an execution at the age of ten to see and learn. Ned led by example, teaching his kids right from wrong. Ned loved his kids more than anything including Jon snow, a boy born of Ned Stark but the mother was not known making Jon a bastard. Each and everyone of Neds kids saw Ned as the ultimate role model and the ultimate man. 
    Ned was a man of great honor. He would do things that he thought was right regardless of his personal feelings. He always wanted the best for his family and the people he ruled over. This meant if he had to step in and tell the King that he was wrong even if no one else would. Ned would stand his ground and fight for what was right. Eddard Stark took the job of Hand to the king meaning he was the kings right hand man. Ned took the job to find justice for the death of the previous hand and to protect his family. 
Let us take Ned Starks honor and never forget it. Use it as a beacon of hope, us it for guidance to make the right decision even if your personal feelings are against it. For centuries to come Citizens of Westeros will say What would Ned Stark do in this situation?. Let us take Neds family values and put them forth into our own life. Ned loved his family above all else and would do anything for the ones he loved. We must never take family for granted as it is the only thing that you will have from your first breath to your last. We can all be as loving and grateful for our families just like Eddard was. The world must not stop being moral because one of the greatest moral compances past but instead continue on the journey on taking morals into account in making decisions. We can all learn from Eddard Stark, on how his morals affected every decision he ever made. 
Eddard Stark was also a very brave man. Whenever adversity came at him he stood up to it no matter what. Ned was faced with situations where he could resist to corruption or stand up for justice, often which not being an easy decision. Ned thought that courage was a resistance to fear. There should never be an absence of fear in Neds mind but instead a mastery of fear itself. If we all take this lesson to heart we can all live up to be just as brave as Eddard Stark. 
Ned was not always the brightest man, but continued on a course of action that may have led to his death. Ned ignored multiple opportunities to stop on this trail but Ned would not stop. Ned had conflicted opinions in his head on what to do but he felt something had been done wrong but Ned continued to do work by the book because he knew that it was the only right way to get things done. 
Eddard Stark died just has he had lived, a stubborn honorable man. He held his honor and family above all else and that's how he should be remembered. His death may be very sad but we must learn everything we can from his death. That honor can be present in a world where being unhonorable is rewarded and that family should be put above all else.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm rewatching Season 2 right now, and just finished the scene where Tywin informs Arya of the history of Harrenhal while he eats the mutton he did not want.

&amp;#x200B;

He almost lauded its immense size and defenses, noting that it could defend against anything except an air attack.  It got me wondering if Harrenhal is going to be an important stronghold in the 2 upcoming wars.

My thought was that if Jon and the North have to abandon winterfell to the AotD, then they could regroup at Harrenhal, which is also large enough to house Dany's army, and shore up their defenses against the AotD and Cersei's army.  It is even possible that Jon and Dany bait the Dead and Cersei's armies to Harrenhall, shut the gates, and leave those 2 armies outside where they will inevitably fight each other.

&amp;#x200B;

the ONLY downsides I see are:

A.  Unless some magic happened or some masons seriously rebuilt it in the last 2 years, the walls may be able to be overrun either by the wights using each other as ladders like in Hardhome, or the Giants doing something, or Cersei's seige weapons, trebuchets, etc since there's probably not a lot of cover left after Aegon's dragons...

B.  vICErion... as Tywin pointed out, Harrenhal cannot defend against the air.  BUT Drogon and Rhaegal can.  Not to mention there's the slim chance that a scorpion can be tipped with a dragonglass or valyrian steel harpoon, but that's admittedly reaching a bit.",11,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I feel like my determination to enjoy it is actually outweighing the power my triggers have had over me. I've never felt that before and it feels like a good sign.

I have so many friends who love the show and the books and I wish so much I could share it with them. I know this is going to be difficult because there are \*so\* many rape scenes, but I have the support of my bf in this and I'm going to track my progress and take it slowly.

Every Valyrian Steel weapon is a chekhovs gun, however Heartsbane is the only one without a clear purpose or someone to wield it.  They wouldnt have included the scenes with Sams Dad and Sam stealing it if the weapon didnt have a significant purpose.

I have not read the books. In the show the Hut Witch, Maggy tells Cersei that the king will have 20 children and she will have three; gold their crowns and gold their shrouds.
When Cersei is comforting Catlyn at Brans bedside she tells of her and Roberts firstborn:
Handsome one, isn't he? l lost my first boy, a little black-haired beauty. He was a fighter too - tried to beat the fever that took him. Forgive me. lt's the last thing you need to hear right now. Robert was crazed, beat his hands bloody on the wall, all the things men do to show you how much they care. The boy looked just like him. 
The witch never mentioned this and it was not recorded in the lineage books that Ned was reading (The seed is strong / black of hair / blonde of hair). I thought well, Cersei just could have been lying like she always does... but she mentions this child to King Robert when they are discussing their marriage of 17 years: 
I felt something for you once, you know? 
I know.
Even after we lost our first boy. For quite a while, actually. Was it ever possible for us? Was there ever a time, ever a moment?
No. Does that make you feel better or worse? 
It doesn't make me feel anything.
. WHY was this first born who looked just like Robert NOT recorded in the Lineage Books? Because he died soon and therefore was not in line? 
I hate that the show left these holes.",14,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

(Maybe not double exactly, but Im not going to exact numbers here so humor me) So my question is, will Rhaegal and Drogon get another size up for the final season? I know its hard to say because we havent got a real trailer yet, but any and all speculation would be appreciated. 

Though I do feel that they SHOULD have 1 more growth spurt to be the size I THINK should be full grown based on illustrations Ive seen in the official GoT books (Balerion for reference). I dont think the dragons will grow anymore for S8, that would probably cost them a bit too much for CGI, it would be harder for them to shoot scenes with even larger dragons, and the Night Kings dragon would probably be too easily out gunned right?

We then learn that, at the start of the his Conquest, Loreon I. Lannister wed a Reyne Daughter to make the Reynes his Vassals and afterwards set north to conquer the Lands of the Baneforts. There is no mention of him conquering the Westerlings of the Crag or caring about the pensulenia south of Castamere where Feastfires and Kayce are. So my theory is that they weren't mentioned brcause they were already in the Reyne's domain, that the Westrlings and maybe even the Presters, were actually Vassals of the Reynes, subdued by them sometime in the Age of Heroes, and that the social status of the Westerlings started to decline when Tywin destroyed their liege lord House. 

I have no real text evidence to support this theory but what we heard of the Reynes is that they were almost equal on wealth and power, (not counting other Lannister Bannermen, just the Lannisters for themselves), with Tywin, who was planning everything beforehand beeing able to raise an army 3'500 men strong from the Lannister's Land alone and Roger Reyne beeing able to muster am army of 2'000 men on a short notice, so if he had time preparing as Tywin did, he'd probably would have had the same army size. This means that the Reynes would also have expanded their domain from just the walls of Castamere, to the north and south. That's probably also why Loreon I. Lannister descided to go the diplomatic way, making the Reyne Daughter his Queen, which would give her Family alot of power in the Realm of the Lannisters. Fighting the Reynes would have probably cost him more men as they were equal Petty Kings. This would also explain the downfall from House Westerling from beeing a rather prominent Family in the West to a Family that had to marry Spice Merchants to dont go fully bancrupt. Their affiliation with the Reynes probably cost them a lot of Prestige among the Westermen Nobility.

The three Night Watchmen are tracking the wildlings.  The scout ; the deserter that Ned Starks executes.  He finds the wild ones are  dead. 
Tells other other two. They die. The white walker throws the head of the other watchmen at the scout. 
Cuts to theme.
Then Ned kills him.

Why would the white walker do this?
I know it's cinematic and hell of a way to start a premier, but still.

Unless that white walker was like the bad guy from Mulan, and wanted a messenger to tell  everyone ""There  coming! The white walkers are coming!""
Then the scout gets past the Wall as far as ~~Whiterun~~  Winterfell.
That means all the White walkers and wights had to not attack the guy WHILE assuming they got all the wildings and they wouldn't kill the scout

In the middle of all this, she is pregnant with Jon Snows baby (by some miracle after the curse the witch gave her). So, they loose the war but, in the colliding of the ice dragon and the fire dragons, a new The Wall its created out of dragon glass and North of the Wall becomes everything north of Riverrun. The wall separating Kings Landing from everything else. Cersei Lannister survives and makes a pack with the White Walkers like Craster and keeps Kings Landing. When the war is over, a pregnant Khaleesi comes back for the throne with her last dragon, Cersei doesnt have any heirs, Khaleesi does, she kills Cersei, keeps the Throne and everyone accepts her because she is a Targaryen and her heir is pure Targaryen blood. Khaleesi sets a group of her army to find more Dragon eggs around the world, they believe they are more in Essos. And she tries to find them to finally battle the Ice King and defeat him.

Hello Everyone!

I am a BIG fan of GOT and the ASOIAF book series (GRRM give us the next book already!). I joined Reddit a while ago, but mainly have just been in the background, although I want to begin to be active in my joined communities. This is a short post, I would like some clarity on some things please.

1. Are we allowed to post our Fan Fictions here? I  currently post on Archive of Our Own &amp; Amino, but I would love to share it with you guys as well. If not, I totally understand but I don't exactly see anything for or against it in the rules. Then again I have dyslexia, so the words sometimes blend together.

2. When it comes to our theory posts, how long should it be? I understand about the tags.

3. What other things can we do? Is the sky the limit? I love the Cosplay I see here and would love to join it, but need clarity on it as well.

Thank you! ",4,1,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

Shae clearly loves Tyrion and she wants to stay with him for more than just money. This becomes apparent when Lord Varys offers her a bag of diamonds for her leaving the capital and she refuses. Then Sansa's handmaid discovers the nature of Tyrion and Shae's relationship and tells Cersei. Tyrion realizes that Shae's life is now in danger because Tywin will kill her. Instead of explaining to her that Tywin knows and that she must leave at once or she will be killed, he screams at her ""You're a whore!"" and says really hurtful things to her. This all seems pointless to me and there was no need to end things so sourly like that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you think the only reason they had this unnecessary argument was to advance the plot and give Shae reason to testify against Tyrion after the purple wedding? If so, is this bad writing? Or is there more to it and I am missing something? On a different but related note, if Shae loved Tyrion, for the love she once had for him, surely after one argument she would not testify against him knowing that he would be sentenced to death. Maybe Shae is a more complicated character that the show doesn't touch upon. I haven't read the books so I don't know.",10,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I seem to remember hearing in a video that Bethesda was origanlly going to make a game based on the Song of Ice and Fire universe.  Although I am starting to notice a lot of simalarities between the two. 

&amp;#x200B;

The first resemblance I noticed was how similar parts of the main narritave is. Both of the universes\` plot deals with the return of Dragons, although whether that is good differs. Another main plot point that is shared is that of the war between the hardy tradisional northmen, who lives in snowy regions, and the more formal empire, who lives in the warm summery areas. Both wars even start with the murder of a king !

&amp;#x200B;

There is also the Night\`s Watch and the Dawnguard, both groups that are fighting a more unkown yet very dangerous threat. Then there is the Dark Brotherhood and the Faceless men of Braavos, who are assassins who are trying to restore themselves to their former glory. One could also argue that the College of Winterhold and the Alchemist guild share some resemblances.

&amp;#x200B;

These could just be coincedences. I may even be wrong about the fact that Bethesda was almost going to develop a SOIAF based game, but if not, well then someone clearly took some inpirations.

As in, what were they going to do before they were handed the ice dragon that ended up breaking the wall for them?

Characters like Jon and Melisandre and everyone who has seen the army of the dead in action all act throughout as if it's a foregone conclusion that the dead will be able to get past the wall, once they reach it. It implies throughout that they have a method they're going to use in order to pass it. 

However, whatever that method might have been goes completely out the window once Viserion dies and is resurrected as a wight. Now they just smash down the wall with the dragon.

Are we supposed to infer that the Night King DIDN'T have any way of getting past the wall, until Jon's actions handed him the ability to do so, not 24 hours before the wall was breached? Am I supposed to assume that if Jon and Co. hadn't gone north of the wall, and Dany hadn't come along after him with her dragons, that the army of the dead would have just been left standing there at the wall, pounding on it fruitlessly?

I have not read the books but isn't the Golden Company loyal to the targaryens or have targaryen connections in some way? If so I am guessing Dany maybe isn't at the final battle with Jon vs cersei (my prediction - whether she is pregnant dead idk) and Euron shows up with the Golden Company to have Jon dead to rights and in the midst of their conversations they mention on the side they don't care that he is Rhaegar's son etc. (has a claim to the throne). Which perks the ears of the golden company and they turn the tide and help Jon defeat cersei and Euron. Just a thought let me know what you guys think or if you have any other ideas what Euron is doing.

Ive kept in mind the truth about Jon. Its pretty apparent he will become the father of dragons. 
So I was curious, after watching the scene where maester aemon wants to keep the dead from being burned at castle black so he may examine, after jon trys killing alliser Thorne and defends the lord commander from being killed by the wight, I noticed he grabbed the lantern from commander mormont and threw it at the wight to burn him. It didnt look like it hurt his hand, is he immune to the flames, too??


After the fact, mormont asks how his arm/ hand is doing and Jon said its gunna be okay, then mormont gave him long claw.

I doubt it's correct, but I haven't heard anyone bring forth this idea before, so I thought I would. It's probably been discussed endless times. It needs more knowledgeable fans to dissect it, because I do not have the time.  


Basically, this idea is based around the gods of GoT and their connection to the events in the show. I'll post what I think in number format and you prove them wrong.  


1. There are two major gods in GoT, one of fire/life, one of death/cold.
2. They are enmeshed in an eternal struggle of fire against ice.
3. Both are not very nice gods.
4. Both have the power to resurrect people. White walkers raising people in connection to the death god, and the followers of the lord of light raising people are examples.
5. The faceless men work for the death god, which is why they may be trying to find a way to deal with the dragons.
6. The dragons are an extension of the fire god's influence.
7. The five forts and the black fused wall are the equivalents of the ice wall in Westeros, and they both have stories of a night king/bloodstone king, who worships evil and commands an army of ice demons.
8. Due to this, both ends of the world are in similar struggles, so it's a recurring theme over time. The death/cold god is trying to move against the humans and fire/life god. He uses the night king or anyone willing as an extension of him.
9. Azorahai is the champion of the fire god.
10. The whole world is in a constant struggle to maintain a balance between fire and ice.

In a general sense, I believe the traditional feudal system will no longer be in place by the end and that Sansa Stark will be a (husbandless) Queen ruling over a very differently structured monarchy, a democratic constitutional monarchy similar to the UK.

Tyrion foreshadowed her survival in season 1 when he remarked you may outlive us all yet and the prophecy about Cercei being replaced by a younger more beautiful queenalso refers to Sansa in my opinion.

We then learn that, at the start of the his Conquest, Loreon I. Lannister wed a Reyne Daughter to make the Reynes his Vassals and afterwards set north to conquer the Lands of the Baneforts. There is no mention of him conquering the Westerlings of the Crag or caring about the pensulenia south of Castamere where Feastfires and Kayce are. So my theory is that they weren't mentioned brcause they were already in the Reyne's domain, that the Westrlings and maybe even the Presters, were actually Vassals of the Reynes, subdued by them sometime in the Age of Heroes, and that the social status of the Westerlings started to decline when Tywin destroyed their liege lord House. 

I have no real text evidence to support this theory but what we heard of the Reynes is that they were almost equal on wealth and power, (not counting other Lannister Bannermen, just the Lannisters for themselves), with Tywin, who was planning everything beforehand beeing able to raise an army 3'500 men strong from the Lannister's Land alone and Roger Reyne beeing able to muster am army of 2'000 men on a short notice, so if he had time preparing as Tywin did, he'd probably would have had the same army size. This means that the Reynes would also have expanded their domain from just the walls of Castamere, to the north and south. That's probably also why Loreon I. Lannister descided to go the diplomatic way, making the Reyne Daughter his Queen, which would give her Family alot of power in the Realm of the Lannisters. Fighting the Reynes would have probably cost him more men as they were equal Petty Kings. This would also explain the downfall from House Westerling from beeing a rather prominent Family in the West to a Family that had to marry Spice Merchants to dont go fully bancrupt. Their affiliation with the Reynes probably cost them a lot of Prestige among the Westermen Nobility.

What do you think?

Here it is.... No one wins. They don't defeat the army of the dead. They can't and no one ever did. History has been manipulated to tell the story and create the hero's but the truth is the army of the dead marched forward until the wall was created to stop them.

And this time it's going to be the same. The forces against the dead will be pushed back and forced to retreat and once they realise they cannot win they will build a wall (dragons) to try and keep them out again with the dead now managing to occupy a greater percentage of westeros. 

Jon Snow dies utterly in vein as he dies to try and win an unbeatable war. Destruction, devestation just like any other war. There are no winners only survivors. The threat of the dead managing to again figure out a way through the wall remains with the potential for the future them taking over the entire continent. 

Jon goes down in history as the hero but again, he died to try and save everyone but he didn't win any war. Bittersweet. His is the song of Ice and fire.",25,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

 As respect to George RR Martin who is one of my favorite authors, I must say that this not fanfic. Simply just an analysis and a collection of theories on the origins of the world based on his writings. A sorta out of universe writing.

 The Deep Ones and there squamous Dark Gods are probably the most secretly influencing force in the Asoiaf universe, they have founded almost all of the known wonders of the world with there oily black stone constructions, such as the Five Forts in Yi Ti, the underground caves of Leng, to Oldtowns Hightower. They even are responsible for the Valyrian Empire indirectly as there black stone substances they used to make there magics was from most likely from the Deep Ones or as the Lorathi call them before they were supposedly slaughtered by the Deep Ones, the Mazemakers.

But all of this seems to originate from one thing in particular. The ones responsible for bringing Magic and the world of Dreams(Yuggoth) closer to the material plane then our current plane is the Bloodstone Emperor. For it was said in legend that he brought down the ""stone"" and worshipped it around 10,000 years ago. Curiously there is not much history before this event for whatever reason. I personally think it's because this is when George Martin decided to put magic in his world. After the stone fell the followers of it created the Church of Starry Wisdom which still persists today, most likely they still covet this stone as it's quite literally the source of all magic for the world of Asoiaf. Even the Children of the forest used black stones in there old magics, which is responsible for pretty much all of the magic in westoros in general. Personally I think the Bloodstone Emperor was a wise and dark figure who knew the secrets of reality and decided that magic needs to return to the world, but the transition from the material to the metaphysical world of dreams didn't succeed completely and the world is only partly in Yuggoth.

Now let me reiterate I love the show, but it just feels like they rushed it so much and that's why it's so disappointing.

They had more than enough source material in each book to get a full 2 seasons out of each one. I feel like had they done it that way and stayed more ""true"" to the source material they never would've gotten so far ahead of GRRM and had to go so far left field.

 So I have two questions; what are y'all's opinions on this secret Winterfell crypt beast? And what do y'all think was going on with Rickon down in the crypts.

My question is, what are the Night King's limitations?

He can raise newly slain people into Wights, as seen at Hard Home, but is his power to raise the dead restricted by any time limit? Can the Night King raise any body that has died as long as its still in tact, or does he have to get to them within a few hours after death?
 The Wights at the Great Weirwood Tree seemed to have been underground for ages, but it's possible the Night King turned them years ago when they were still freshly dead, and then left them there to wait until needed.

Can anyone be turned into White Walkers or does it have to be a newborn? Is it just easier for the cultural process if they start training Whites at infancy, or is there an actual limit to when humans can be turned into Whites? Do Whites age and grow the same way humans do?

If the Night King has some sort of greenseeing power, can he also warg into animals? Can he see the future in order to formulate his plans in the present?

&gt;!I'm rewatching the show after having already seen every episode several times. 

Each time I catch new things in the show that I didn't see before, and this time I'm catching lots of things that you couldn't have seen unless you already knew the outcomes of future episodes.

For example, In S05E08 (Hardhome) Olly comes to talk to Samwell and while it wasn't clear at the time, looking back with hindsight it's obvious he's wrestling with the decision to betray Jon. Samwell unknowingly encourages Olly to do so.

""Sometimes a man has to make hard choices, choices that might look wrong to others, but you know are right in the long run.""

These are the words that convince Olly to betray Jon.

Now here's where the foreshadowing comes in. Right after Samwell says that he adds...

""Try not to worry Olly, I've been worrying about Jon for years. He always comes back.""

If that wasn't enough foreshadowing, this is also the first episode where john is referred to as a king. The wildlings call him ""King Crow"" when they meet him.

So right there in this one episode you have references to Olly betraying Jon, Jon coming back to life, becoming king, and then it ends with a whitewalker fight.

And the significance of this is completely lost unless you've already seen episodes they hadn't made at the time.

And I think this is all the more impressive because at this point the show had already surpassed the books in the story timeline. Meaning they weren't copying foreshadowing from a book with the guidance of the author, but instead this is 100% original cinematic foreshadowing.!&lt;",20,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Hodor is putting on an act. He is NOT insane, or disabled mentally in any whatsoever. it's all an act to have him go past peoples mental and emotional defences to gain trust and leech information out of them.

If you look carefully, whenever Jaqen H'ghar is talking to Arya Stark, and even when he was locked in that cage, notice how Hodor is in the background and the raven kid in the wheelchair is also there?

The thing is Hodors eyes are going black when he is taken possession of and my theory is that Hodor is the one controlling Jaqen H'ghar.

Jaqen is a ""faceless man"", but if you look at Hodor, he is also faceless. ""Faceless"" is a metaphor for identity, and Hodor lacking a personality in an expressive way renders him ""Faceless"".

Hodor is also a master assassin, easily overpowering many characters he has faced to protect the raven wheelchair kid.

To conclude my theory, Hodor is related to Sandor clegane, as the two are seen in the first season guarding the Emperor. Hodor is in full armor as one of the knights, we can see this if you we look carefully.

To finally conclude, Hodor may also be the Lord of Light as Hodors's aura is partially seen manifesting whenever the lord of lights prayers are being spoken and when sandor looked into the fire, he saw Hodor making violent threats towards him which intimated Sandor as he was forced to make up visions of the ice wall to avoid Hodors wrath and detection.

I know guys, I couldn't believe this but hey, ""sometimes the truth is more bizzare than reality"" - Hodor",16,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Mine is that Robb's bride Talisa was actually a Red Priestess, sent to influence him if he actually became King. I mostly think this because she was from Volantis, where the Red Temple is, and other Red Priests, like Thoros of Myr, have been given similar missions. 

Since both Robb and Talisia were both slain during the Red Wedding, I feel like even if this were true, it is now irrelevant.

I saw a brief spoof of Game of Thrones that portrays a supposed final scene of the series. I can't remember if it was from a TV show or internet video or what. I also can't remember whether it was with actors or a cartoon, but i'm leaning slightly toward cartoon. I saw it in the past few years, but don't know when it originally aired.

In it, some of the main characters from Game of Thrones are gathered around a tabletop game board. The pieces on the game board are thrones. One of the characters remarks something to the effect of ""So in the end, it really was a game...of thrones.""

This whole exchange is only a few seconds and probably just some kind of side-gag to a larger show that has nothing to do with Game of Thrones. I realize how terrible this joke is, but it's been stuck in my head for a while and it's driving me crazy not being able to pinpoint where it came from.

She is the worst actress in the show. Judging by interviews, Sibel Kekilli is a very cool person, but her acting is just embarrassing, especially when she is near the genius of Peter Dinklage. Her face shows nothing, her acting is not just wooden, it's nonexistent.

And it's not the accent, many people have non-British and non-American accents, fake or real. She just can't act for shit. I never believed a line she said, which is tragic, considering some of the greatest scenes are with her and Dinklage.

As for other actors, in her first episodes, Sophie wasn't very good, but she grew into a strong actress, the scenes with her Theon are amazing. Littlefinger is great most of the time but sometimes slips out of his accent. The first actor to play Daario Naharis was a little bit embarrassing.

Lady Stoneheart doesn't exist on the show.  Her throat was slit and then after she'd been dead for a while was resurrected by the red god. 

Littlefinger would burn the kingdom down if he could rule over the ashes.  He had his throat slit, and been dead for a while. 

If you think this story has a happy ending you haven't been paying attention.  

Put these 3 things together. Could we see littlestonefinger resurrected to become an avatar of the Lord of light?   Could he oversee a bloodbath of an endgame that features the kingdom burning down, and at the very end he sits his mermaid butt on a twisted melted iron throne and stares out at the ashes of Kings Landing?

By all means, Jaime's half of Ice would go on to continue a storied legacy but Tywin could not have predicted any of those turns of events and having no one aware of the actual transfer of ownership of the steel, nothing to take place after the reforging could have been acreditted to Tywin or added to his renown.",13,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

It is said that The Golden Company was made of exiles and sons of exiles. They prefer to call themselves a free brotherhood, rather than sellswords. Dany remembers that Viserys asked them for help once, but they laughed at him.

We hear a few times in the books that the Golden Company broke its contract with the free city of Myr, and no one knows why...

The commander of the Golden Company at this moment in the books is Harry Strickland. The Yunkish wanted to use them for their campaign in Slaver's Bay, but they refuse.

Illyrio's plan was for Young Griff (the man claiming he was Aegon Targaryen, Elia's son) to marry Dany, then attack Westeros. Young Griff is frustrated with Illyrio's plans, and decides to attack Westeros without Dany, backed by the Golden Company (an idea given to him by Tyrion -attack Westeros, and the dragon queen will come to your aid).

At the end of ""A Dance with Dragons"", Young Griff and the Golden Company have landed in the stormlands, and want to take Storm's End.

The story is all different in the show, but this is the background in the books.....the Golden Company was founded by a Targaryen bastard, and has declared in favour of Targs now......One thing to keep in mind, this army has broken contracts before, and tends to support Targs. They can easily turn against Cersei season 8...",5,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

He ordered the killing of **Eddard Stark** and tortured Sansa for a long time. Though, she suffered more with Ramsay. 

However, you people will be amazed to hear about a Roman emperor **Caligula** who was quite to **Joffrey**, both character-wise and facially as well. He was a Roman emperor in the very first decade after Christ (ruled from AD 37 to AD 41). 

This can be a total coincidence or may be **Joffrey Baratheon** (Jack Gleeson) was selected on these parameters. The character is very much inspired by this tyrant roman emperor.

**Caligula** was from the first ruling family of the Roman Empire and belonged to an empire acknowledged as the **Julio-Claudian** dynasty.

It is believed that he was a noble and moderate emperor during the first six months of his reign. Then after, history tells us about his cruelty, sadism, extravagance and sexual perversion, which presented him as insane tyrant. 

In his short-term reign, Caligula was forever busy increasing his unrestrained personal power as an emperor. Apart from some qualities, **Joffrey** and **Caligula** share a lot of qualities.

Joffrey was murdered by **Olenna Tyrell**, which came into light in the 8 season. Sadly, our beloved **Tyrion Lannister** was charged with his murder and thus had to flee Kings Landing. 

As for Caligula, his murdered was conspired too. In early AD 41, Caligula was assassinated as an outcome of a conspiracy by officers of the Praetorian Guard, senators and courtiers.

All those around her are embellished: Jorah becomes a vaillant knight (although we know he was a slave) while in the books he is much more twisted (speaking of selling children at the brothel of Meereen) and unhealthy with her (calling her ""child"", kissing her, asking her to marry him...), Daario is more ""nice"" and sincere to her, Missandei is an young woman and not a child, the advisers of Meereen (one of whom regularly advises her about horrible things like killing children) don't exist in the show.

However, Daenerys is, on the contrary, darker. It's amazing when you think that Tyrion &amp; Cersei were embellished in the show unlike books. There, for the ""heroine"", it's the opposite.

All of Dany's psychology, her doubts and her self-reflection have disappeared : she tells herself that if her dragons are monsters then she too, she says that she has sown only destruction and chaos, that she has looted and freed the slaves so that they die of hunger and have even more violence. But nothing in the show.

In addition, D &amp; D (with the approval of George RR Martin) add some odd actions: Daenerys enjoy listening to the agony of the masters she is killing (unlike in the books) and we have a young master who letting her know that some of those she killed were innocent (which never happens in the book). Daenerys executes a young slave for killing a murderer, which causes an uprising of freedmen against her. While in the books, this slave is Missandei's brother and he is murdered by the sons of Harpie. Similarly, Daenerys never gives a master to her dragons.

Hizdahr, in the show, is presented to us as a ""victim"". He is pitiful and gets killed by the enemies of Daenerys. While in the books, he is a rich merchant, manipulative and cruel, who ends up King of Meereen. It's a hell of a change.

I wonder why they chose only violent scenes and portraying a dark aspect of Daenerys when, in books, they do not exist? In the books, Daenerys is surrounded by cruel, twisted and manipulative men. She listens to their advice and never tells them to stop with their horrors. She is also surrounded by slave children who have spent their lives serving and who have a limited mind (Missandei, Irri ...). Abolishing her influences and her ""friendships"" or replacing them with something more honest while making Daenerys the true leader of the group, is interesting.

Would it be because the end of the character is the same and that, where books can afford more subtlety and psychology, the series can not. So, showing Daenerys' doubts would simply have been confusing, while showing scenes like this served to bring Daenerys as a future antagonist?",4,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I'm here to defend Joffrey Baratheon!,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/a9j9th/spoilers_hi_im_here_to_defend_joffrey_baratheon/,deeejh,1545779652,"Not entirely, but for Ned Starks beheading--yes.  A vile character to say the least and before you call me crazy, hear me out. I aim to carry out a stance on Neds beheading that involves an analytical perspective that justifies his death.  

A pinch of moral and ethical philosophy ultimately carries the burden behind what I hope to achieve here.  I felt compelled to address this because understanding morality from a philosophical perspective gives credibility to a sound argument I hope to achieve.  The idea of *right* from *wrong* is relative to some degree.  I dont need to tell you that, but addressing this helps shed light on a potential bias that may be present.  To further simplify this, my argument may be different from someone with different ethical or moral beliefs.  So, if any value comes from Western Philosophy, reason and logic are my weapons of choice.  

Granted the series is fictional by definition, there is a strong connection to be made with humanity historically.  This is important to address because I believe the series makes a strong enough connection with humanity for us to *validate* Joffreys actions.  I hesitated at first to use this, however I came to census that there is a fine line between using this approach to validate an argument about certain moral principals in a film or T.V. show.  For example:  Can an argument be made about certain moral principles tied to Wizard Culture?  Like using magic outside of Hogwarts? Maybe, to some context, however anything not related to humanity specifically isnt really something we can use to validate without symbolically referencing something completely different that is *real* and creatively similar in principal or context--like saying an apple is an orange because it is symbolically shaped the same, healthy to eat and both come from a tree.   Game of Thrones may be fictional in certain aspects, but the major theme in the show is *humanity*.  The relationship between humanity in the show is nearly the same as it was historically apart from flaming swords, White Walkers, many-faced god and anything else related.  While each do symbolically reference something, their relevance to Joffreys actions with Ned Stark are separate and irrelevant.

At first glance, an historical reference the series makes with decapitating Ned Stark comes with Frances guillotine of 1791. Likewise, to a similar era and ideology, the method to execute Neds criminality heavily relates to a revolting statue similar to that of the French Revolution from an analytical perspective of Joffrey.  However, our perception of Joffrey as the viewer is literally caked with this image of a psychotic, inbred child.  No denying what we see from a viewers perspective, however this densely compiled image of him and interchanging of scenes gives little room to analyze specifics.  An analytical perspective here takes into account what Joffrey himself knew versus what we the viewers know.  If we take into account information only Joffrey had leading up to Neds execution, the facts would tell us that Joffrey was unaware of his false claim to the throne and the workings involved to conceal it.  Furthermore, the lack of knowledge and support behind his false claim gives Joffrey no reason to doubt his claim.  Neds approach to resolve this was with Roberts final demands before his death.  This approach failed and Neds backup plan to this was to cease the throne using the City Watch and his own men.  This plan failed as the City Watch betrayed Ned Stark and murdered his own men.  This move from Joffreys perspective is treasonous beyond doubt.  This alone from Joffreys perspective confirms an act of treason as he himself witnessed the act take place.  Despite being completely unaware of Neds intentions or the truth; what ultimately *justifies* Neds death is ironically Ned himself.  Convinced by Lord Varys to confess his vile treason, Ned confesses with the assumption his life would be spared and daughters unharmed.  Ned confesses among the people of Kings Landing and ironically lies about his treasonous actions leading to his decapitation. 


&gt;I come before you to confess my treason in the sight of gods &gt;and men. I betrayed the faith of my king and the trust of my &gt;friend Robert. I swore to protect and defend his children but &gt;before his blood was cold, I plotted to murder his son and &gt;seize the throne for myself. 


Neds actions confronting Joffrey and furthermore confessing his lie renders a position that logic and reason would accept as immoral.  Joffreys decision to behead Ned Stark was just because of Neds immediate confession and Joffreys direct evidence of Neds treasonous attempt gives Joffrey every reason to act accordingly. If a defendant today confesses to their wrong doing, a due process to prove his innocence wouldnt take place; your just guilty.  One of Immanuel Kants famous quotes Live your life as though your every act were to become a universal law. nails Ned Starks coffin and holding Ned Stark accountable for his own death.  Despite how we may feel about Joffrey and what we may know as the viewer, the irony of this hallmark in the series is that the faithful man lied and the sickly person was just and we the viewers saw the complete opposite and subconsciously accepted it.


Im currently in the works on several other scenes with a similar approach that aims to address morality in a different point of view that we the viewers subconsciously accept without much thought involved.  My goal here isnt to suggest how we should view the show, but to simply highlight what we can learn from the show that can apply in many ways to our lives today and facilitate discussion about it.  The major moral here is to highlight an aspect of morality that literally embraces the quote theres more to this than meets the eye.  Lastly, while we all perceive Ned to be a virtuous man, he wasnt a smart one.  He was responsible for his own death and had he defended himself, this argument would be completely irrelevant.  

Kind of hard to do an TL; DR for a dense discussion. Sorry.

Then  I think the night king bran is trying to kill his younger self before he travels back in time.  The COTF would still create the night king but it would only be a man not a greenseer.  This explains why the white walkers are attacking now, they needed to wait for bran to be born.  It makes the NK kind of a good guy and gives us the bitter sweet ending with brans death.

If his motivation really is to 'serve the realm' as he claims then this leads to the question of why he would support the Targaryens?

Of course Robert is a lazy king who brings the realm into debt but Viserys is cruel and stupid and would make a worse king. With his network of informants all ober Westeros ans Essos Varys would know that Viserys woild be the worse king. He even says as much himself in season 7. Furthermore, to take the throne Viserys plans to invade with a huge Dothraki army. Theyre known for brutality in warfare with much rape and pilage as we see in season 1. So, to get rid of a lazy king, Varys instead supports a cruel, stupid man who can only take power by starting a terrible war. Doesnt sound much like serving the realm to me.

Of course, there are other ways of looking at this. Perhaps Robert is not the problem but his heir Joffrey is. But again, Viserys is hardly much better and Joffrey doesnt have a Dothraki army to unleash on the people.

Perhaps Varys could see Viserys getting himself killed. But he could hardly see his sister being a great leader and being able to tame the Dothraki.

One thing i can think of is the idea of stability. Perhaps it is better to have one, undisputed dynasty in power if even they produce some bad rulers. With the issue of joffreys illegitimacy this becomes even more urgent. Trouble is that roberts rebellion already brought the cat out of the bag and bad kings will always create resistance no matter their dynasty.

Perhaps Varys is less interested in serving the realm here. But then what? He has the perfect position in the court of King Robert as he alludes to. As far as we know he has no family that need to be avenged etc. Is it his own survival? As in if the Targaryens do reconquer the Seven Kingdoms, Varys wants to be in a position to say he helped them so they dont kill him?

The show is a different story entirely though. There are two quotes about her intelligence; One by Tywin Lannister, when he told her she was not as smart as she thought she was. The other by Tyrion, when he said he considers her to be of above average intelligence. One doesn't necessarily negate the other; Cersei may be quite smart but she's not the political mastermind she may think she is, which is why she underestimates everyone around her which backfired with the High Sparrow.

As far as her actions are concerned, I don't think they are particularly stupid or smart. She outsmarted the Starks and the Tyrells but that's because they vastly underestimated her ruthlessness. She made a bad deal with the High Sparrow because she in turn underestimated his ambition as one she considered to be a man of the Gods. This season she's been a pretty good player, deducing that Dany's dragons are vulnerable when the other woman tried to intimidate her with her full force during their meeting, and honestly I can see both sides of her and Jaime's arguments about whether not following the army in the North is the right choice or not. Jaime thinks it's safest (and most honorable) to fight the dead with their full force, so that if the living survive they'll live and let live. Cersei thinks a few Lannister soldiers wouldn't make a difference anyway, and she doesn't trust Dany/Jon to let her live after all is done, so she'd rather gather a huge army and fight the weakened army of whomever survives.

**Tl;dr:** Personally I think show Cersei's intelligence is slightly above average; she's not as stupid as some think, but she's not the mastermind she thinks she is either. Her smarts is not her biggest weapon though, her ruthlessness is.",18,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

2439,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-12-27,2018,12,27,5,a9rxob,self.gameofthrones,[Spoilers] - Why has Varys always supported a Targaryen restoration?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/a9rxob/spoilers_why_has_varys_always_supported_a/,EricthePinko,1545855381," 

We learn in season 1 that Varys is secretly working towards a Targaryen restoration. If his motivation really is to 'serve the realm' as he claims then this leads to the question of why he would support the Targaryens?

Of course Robert is a lazy king who brings the realm into debt but Viserys is cruel and stupid and would make a worse king. With his network of informants all over Westeros and Essos Varys would know that Viserys would be the worse king. He even says as much himself in season 7. Furthermore, to take the throne Viserys plans to invade with a huge Dothraki army. They're known for brutality in warfare with much rape and pillage as we see in season 1. So, to get rid of a lazy king, Varys instead supports a cruel, stupid man who can only take power by starting a terrible war. Doesn't sound much like serving the realm to me.

Of course, there are other ways of looking at this. Perhaps Robert is not the problem but his heir Joffrey is. But again, Viserys is hardly much better and Joffrey doesn't have a Dothraki army to unleash on the people.

Perhaps Varys could see Viserys getting himself killed. But he could hardly see his sister being a great leader and being able to tame the Dothraki.

One thing i can think of is the idea of stability. Perhaps it is better to have one, undisputed dynasty in power if even they produce some bad rulers. With the issue of joffreys illegitimacy this becomes even more urgent. Trouble is that roberts rebellion already brought the cat out of the bag and bad kings will always create resistance no matter their dynasty.

Perhaps Varys is less interested in serving the realm here. But then what? He has the perfect position in the court of King Robert as he alludes to. As far as we know he has no family that need to be avenged etc. Is it his own survival? As in if the Targaryens do reconquer the Seven Kingdoms, Varys wants to be in a position to say he helped them so they dont kill him?

As I was re-watching I was thinking about this and figuring it's probably just an aesthetic/stylistic choice, and probably not significant. Then in episode 2 I noticed something interesting. Bran has recently woken up and the old woman is in the room, telling him stories. There's a sense that there is truth in her stories. Then Robb enters the room and sends her away. He tells Bran that she once told him the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant named Macomber. Bran says ""maybe we do.""

Of all the people that have been killed North of the wall? Why did they care about one more wight in a massive army? And why didn't he turn fully icy after being stabbed with dragonglass? Is it because he was dead already and this just stopped them being able to control him? If this is the case, can all wights gain control of themselves by being stabbed by dragonglass or does it only work if you're dead but haven't been resurrected yet? And, if he was alive when they stabbed him with dragonglass, it makes no sense that he was a weird hybrid of alive and dead. The dragonglass in the heart immediately turned the NK into a whitewalker. The only thing that makes it a different situation is that he's been stabbed by an ice sword. So does the sword have special magic that messes with the effects of dragonglass? Or does an injury just prevent you from fully transitioning to a WW?

As Benjen and the cotf are dead now, we can only learn a lot of stuff from Bran.. And I feel like the show isn't going to waste 5 mins of the final season explaining this through flashbacks.
I can only imagine that the show logic is that knew he would help Bran and Jon, and that was important for the future of the world. This, though, would mean they need to already know who he is and a lot of future events. But if the cotf were such good greenseers they shouldn't have made the NK in the first place.

I get that the show doesn't have to tie up every plot with a little bow, as you don't always get the answers in life. But I like there to be some understandable in-world logic that you can justify a situation with. And I don't see it. If anyone has a logical argument to explain this stuff to me, I'd love to hear it.

Dany will have to sacrifice Jon Snow (Nissa Nissa - maybe hell be her husband by then).  Instead of using a sword, perhaps it will be with a dragon or a sacrifice for a new dragon (see below).  In this scenario, Jons soul would combine with the dragon and he would become Lightbringer.

My personal opinion... too often in the books they reference how lifelike the dragons look at Dragonstone.  A part of me wonders Jon will be sacrificed to bring the dragon of stone back to life and this will be the dragon Jons soul jumps to. 

This theory doesnt answer many things of course.  In the Lightbringer prophecy the creation of the Sword (or weapon) is attempted twice prior to the third success.  Once with Water and once with a Lion.  I believe this has something to do with the great houses but Im not able to find that linkage and with the books behind the show we may not have seen these attempts yet. 

Additional thoughts to share:

In the Azor Ahai theory, I avoid taking any of the words literally.  As you saw above with the Sword theory.  I think the same way with the Clasps term which is an odd term to use for someone who grasps or holds a sword.  This to me implies Azor Ahai must bring something together or bind something together.  Additionally I believe the Azor Ahai theory is talking about two people, not one.  The first part speaks of a Warrior.  In the books Warriors tend to be those who are loyal to a religion - I.e.  The 7 or Rhollar, or perhaps the Braavosi god of death?  Then, it talks about Azor Ahai. 

Things weve learned so far:

1) Sex is a translation issue, therefore him/her is not a fact - weakness is that this is from the show, not the books
2) Jon Snow is a warg and we learn that when wargs die they can inhabit an animal
3) Sword has many definitions but at its root, it is a weapon
4) You have to sacrifice a life for a life

Elia found it all exciting. She was of that age, and her delicate health had never permitted her much travel. I preferred to amuse myself by mocking my sister's suitors. There was Little Lord Lazyeye, Squire Squishlips, one I named the Whale That Walks, that sort of thing. The only one who was even halfway presentable was young Baelor Hightower.

He would of also at least considered asking for a trial by combat, or an actual trial to defend himself. Maybe he is panicked and starts rambling idk? But I'd like to think LF would keep his cool in this situation and evade a death like that. He preaches about fighting every battle in his mind but happened to over look the one right in front of him? It's in my head that maybe LF didn't die here. It's really the blonde who he happens to give a coin to. Maybe she took his face? But with only 6 episodes left I'm assuming that won't be explored and LF is forever gone from the series. Which ya good riddens, I just wish his death was a little more thought out and seemed more believable.  Any thoughts on LF's demise or maybe he actually is still alive? ",34,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I didn't read any leaks/spoilers for Season 7 ahead of time and honestly didn't even know there were any. I avoided the trailer, partly by choice. And overall, while I agree with some of the complaints about the writing and plot armor in this season, I generally think it's one of the better ones.

It's probably right in the middle of my rankings. It managed to surprise me as much as any other season of Game of Thrones, it was suspenseful as hell, especially Beyond the Wall, and it was a real spectacle, which I'd expect from the climax of the whole story. So I'm a bit biased towards it, but I still agree with some of the complaints while personally kinda looking past them. 

But most of my enjoyment came from not knowing what was gonna happen in the plot, which kept me in suspense. If I'd read the outline of the season's plot ahead of time in the leaks, Beyond the Wall would've been half as good as I thought it was. Even if I'd seen that fanmade poster that somehow circulated onto thousands of websites as the ""real"" poster, featuring the NK and his ice dragon perched on top of the wall blowing blue fire, it would've made me enjoy the season a lot less. That one simple picture alone basically fucks up the suspense of almost the entire season by telling you exactly where this is going. 

So for those who didn't think it was that good - did you read the plot in the leaks beforehand, or did you see any spoilers by accident? Do you think that affected your opinion in any way? ",13,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

This is a question I really ask myself. I have never seen, either in Game of  Thrones or any other series / movie, a romance with a first kiss  happening off-screen. This is the purpose of a romance: the first kiss.  It's sometimes more important than the bed scene. This is the moment  when we see all the tension that exists between lovers, their affection,  their love for each other and the concretization of their union.

Why  are we deprived of this scene? These are two major characters in the  story. Why everyone (Shae / Tyrion, Robb / Talisa, Sam / Gilly, Tommen /  Margaery, Joffrey / Margaery, Sansa / Joffrey, Jon / Ygritte...) had  their first kiss and not them?",14,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

He has a lot in common with Ned Stark, only he was on the other side....Aerys'....He was also King's hand, and is hiding a Targ prince as his own son....

Jon was the lord of Griffin's Roost, a friend of Rhaegar's. He was named Hand for Aerys, for a brief time during Robert's Rebellion. Jon was close to capturing Robert Baratheon, at the Stoney Sept...as he was a kind man, he didn't burn the entire town, as Tywin would have done. While Jon was looking everywhere for Robert, who was hidden by different people, Ned Stark and Hoster Tully arrived in Robert's aid.

Aerys was furious, and exiled Jon, stripping him of his titles. Jon joins the Golden Company. Varys switches baby Aegon Targaryen (Elia's son) with another look-alike, and gives Jon the real prince. Jon raises the young prince as his son. Tyrion meets Jon under the name of Griff, and Aegon under the name of Young Griff....all arranged by Illyrio and Varys. Tyrion soon guesses the identities of Griff and Young Griff....he likes the first much better.

During their journey, Jon and his companions are attacked by people with greyscale. Jon saves Tyrion from drowning, and unfortunately catches the disease (the show changed that to Jorah). He tries to keep it hidden, in order not to loose Young Griff's men.

Jon and the Golden Company arrive in Westeros, where they easily take back Griffin's Roost. They plan to ask prince Doran for an alliance, and take Storm's End. One of his men suggests that Young Griff marries for an alliance, but Jon wants to keep him free for Dany, as that is the plan.....for Young Griff to marry Dany, and them to rule together.

So lets get started:

-	Arya Stark: I'll start with Arya since she is probably my second favourite stark child next to Bran and is pretty much one of everyone's favourite characters. So it seems from interviews and what the actress who plays Arya has said it does not seem they are going to Retcon he WF plotline to have it be that she did NOT fall for LF's game which I think is ridiculous but I don't want to open that can of worms right now (in fact I may make a post soon on how I interpret the WF plotline). But this does lead me to my first thing I want to mention and that is why did Arya fall for LF's trap? Because she let her feelings towards Sansa from childhood get the better of her. Which I think is foreshadowing that Arya's arc next season will not only be about fully regaining her humanity but also Re-socialization and learning not to let her emotions get the better of her, because I feel her feelings towards Sansa was probably how she fell for LF's game last season and also there will be a lot of people that wronged house Stark she'll will want her hands on such as Jaime, The Northern Lords, and maybe Theon (if he saves Yara in time to get back to WF) and she'll have to learn to not let herself get into an outburst or try to kill them. She will also have a long waited reunion with Jon and will support him being with Dany but I think she will start to have problems when she finds out Jon gave up the North to Dany and also is getting help from Cersei. I also believe she will reunite with Gendry and have a romance with him next season as there are many moments for foreshadowing for it through out the series. I also believe she may be the Valonqar if Jaime dies before he can get a chance, Arya I believe will sail West of Westeros with Gendry by her side.

-	Sansa Stark: Okay So for Sansa I believe she will probably have a problem with J&amp;D at first but first of all I think she will still try and support Jon even if she may not like Dany and also she will grow to like her. She will reunite with Tyrion as well as Sandor (forgot to mention Arya will also reunite with Sandor) which in Tyrions case will be interesting since the last time they were together they were technically married (but not really) and I think Sansa will defend Tyrion as well, idk what Sansa will do next season to be honest. One of the interviews I believe mention Epi 1 of S8 will be like Epi 1 of S1 and I think it would be interesting if Sansa was put in a position that Arya was at the beginning of S1, as in just as Arya felt like an outsider for not being lady-like Sansa could start feeling like an outsider for not being a warrior. I also think it be cool if she had a romance with Pod even though I dont think she will because they didnt set it up and also Pod may die next season before she can, I also believe Sansa will either die saving Arya (paralleling Lady and Nymeria) or she will live and may become Queen.

-	Bran Stark: Bran is my favourite Stark child out of all of them and one of my Favourite characters. You would think it be Arya but nope its Bran and I believe he and Sam will reveal to Jon his true Parentage but also I believe Bran will learn some more secrets (maybe we get some more flashbacks like another Mad King flashback, a Bran the builder flashback (though maybe not as they may want to save him for the Long Night spin-off), a Quick Long Night flashback, and a flashback of Ned in the crypts). Yes I do believe Bran may also uncover the true identity of the NK and the WWs reasons for returning which I think will be a combination of resurgence in magic, Jons birth, the threat of the Red God, and them wanting to finally end the curse the children put on them. As for the NK I think hell learn that the NK is NOT the first white walker like we thought (the real first white walker was the bearded one in the cave drawing) but who is the NK then? Idk yet. Maybe he is the original Azor Ahai/PTWP/Last hero or Lightbringer, maybe he is the 13th lord Commander/Nights King, or all of the above, or maybe instead of those things he is the first true child of Ice and Fire, or the child of a Forbidden love between an Andal knight and a First Mens daughter, or just a regular guy with no ties to any houses in the story and was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, idk yet. But either way I think Bran will have a part in the NKs defeat as well and maybe be in a game of minds with him and/or pull a hold the Door 2.0 on him in order to weaken him, in the end I believe he will go beyond the former wall to take his place as the new 3ER or (if Sansa dies) he may become King of the Seven Kingdoms.",5,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I haven't read any of the books, but I'm 100% okay with getting book spoilers in response here.


I've come to accept that the weather in this universe is wonky. On my first (casual) watch-through, I was sort of under the impression that winter only came once every few decades, and that each winter is equally grim, dangerous, difficult, etc. I thought there hadn't been a winter since the last time the white walkers were a threat. 


But this time, I paid attention when Tyrion says he's lived through 8 or 9 winters, and the winter of his birth lasted 3 years. So now I know winter comes pretty often, relative to my initial thoughts on it.


So my questions is - Why is *this* winter significant? 


It's been 9 years since the last winter, it's been a long summer, but what makes this winter different from all the previous ones? Does the return of the white walkers have anything to do with the return of winter? Ned is always warning, with creepy foreshadowing, that winter is coming, but winter comes all the time. So I assume he isn't really warning his children about the weather. Is he referring to all of the mess of the previous few generations finally coming to war? Does the coming war have anything to do with winter coming back, or with the white walkers rising again?


PS. I know mythology isn't the correct word, but I guess what I'm looking for is all the details from the books and from the universe that might help me piece these ideas together. ",13,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

At the end of Season 7 when they went beyond the wall to catch a wight and Jon kills the White Walker, destroying all of the wights that WW created (all but one). Why was there only one in that group that wasn't made by him? What were the chances of the humans finding the Walkers before the Walkers found them? It seems more like a setup.

Then, later in that episode, when they are then surrounded by all of those Walkers in the lake/pond/whatever, ALL of the walkers stayed surrounding the group, none of them bothered to run off after Gendry. Why would this be? What a massive overkill for a small group of people! - It seems more like the Night King wanted Gendry to send a raven to Daenerys.

I think the Night King knew Daenerys had dragons, and he wanted to trick the humans into bringing them there so that he could capture them. [B](Why did he just so happen to be armed with those spears?)[/B]",9,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I know it's been said that Lady dieing was in reference to Sansa's innocent views on wanting to be a queen or Lady one day, but it's interesting that she is actually now a Lady and could be killed. Maybe even at the hands of her own kin since Ned killed Lady.

He claims, that this outline was sent to him a year ago. Not only is this ending bitter sweet but it also seems to match set leaks. I have also heard from some parts of the ""leak"" here on reddit. So do you know anything about this. Have you heared about this?

Main Parts of the Leak:

-Winterfell falls
-Theon rescues Yarah and dies by Euron
-Jamie Betrays Cersei and dies saving Bran
-Varys is burned 
-Melisandre killed by sentence to death
-Cersei turns Mad Queen
-Cersei burns Euron (and is sexually aroused doing so)
-Tyrion betrayed Daenerys long time ago (at their dragon pit conversation they spoke off screen - Bran sees it)
-Tyron joined forces with Cersei 
-Almost all living armies fall to the night king
-All Dragon die (Vyseris kills Drogo and Rhaegal - Bran wargs into Vyseris and manages to kill him)
-No side wins.
-Bran and the night king agree a pact between the dead and the living.
-New Wall at the Godseye
-Jorah Mormund becomes the 1000th lord commander of the nightswatch
-Cersei gets killed by Aria wearing Jamies Face (Valonquar fullfilled)
-Tyrion burns Kingslanding (also iron throne is destroyed)
-Tyrion is sentenced to death by Daenerys (she askes why he did this. He says something like ""to break the wheel..."")
-No more ruler of the seven kingdoms.
-Rhaegar appers in Episode 6 (only viewer knows this - he is now noone)

1. Ser Arthur Dayne, known as the best swordsman by pretty much every house, takes down Starks best men in seconds flat while quite outnumbered, overpowered ned before being cheated. 

2. Ser Barriston Selmy, the greatest knight to ever serve the kingsguard, outranks Jamie by a few men, holds off an absurd amount of cultists at the age of 70 or so, who knows what he was capable of when he was young. 

3. Brienne of Tarth, easily bests the hound, easily bests Ser Loras (who bested the mountain at joust, no small feat) and can hold up to Arya, who at this point is a literal death God. She kills 5 of the Boltons best riders in seconds flat, and had no problem with Jamie the few times he got free.

4. Sandor ""the Hound"" Clegane, no problem holding back his brother who was already mid attack (he ran down those stands so fast to block that) took down Beric Dondarrion fairly easily despite his weakness being used against him, completely wrecks a few brotherhood knights with no armor and no proper weapon, also he's a badass. 

5. Daario Neharis, slave fighter since he was a teenager, never lost. Takes down just as many cultists as old Selmy which is impressive, fights without armor and wrecks anyway, is stealthy enough to sneak up on Dany with her full guard, has a 12 inch penis probably. I would also rank drogo around here but we never really got to see him fight. 

6. King Robert Baratheon, not a swordsman but was reported to be stronger than most of them, bests several targ knights of high prestige, absolutely obliterates half of cerseis face (lol), can't imagine what he looked like when in good shape but according to the books he was much larger and more skilled than ned who isn't bad at all. 

7. Ser Jamie Lannister ""Kingslayer"", killed the mad king, probably wasn't easy, does well against Ned until his man cheats, while bound at the wrist he is able to kill several skilled stark men and his cousin (lol), kills a royal guard of the Martell family with his off hand (provided he got lucky)

8. Arya Stark, a beast of the arts while only being 13-14 years old, will no doubt be the strongest by far when she's older, bests ""a girl"" in combat and she was scary af, ties with brienne in sparring (she was holding back but still impressive) and kills an entire castle of men (the Frey's). She will surely be the head of the kingsguard when she grows up. 

9. Gregor ""the mountain"" Clegane, nuff said. He's big and scary as hell but he's also #9 because he loses almost every battle on screen, I would also rank Oberyn here because they tied, he's not as strong or skilled as his brother and he's definitely too dumb and slow to beat Arya or Daario. Also he obeys cersei so there's no way he's got a brain lol. 

10. Ser Jorah Mormont, Lord Ned Stark, Ser Beric Dondarrion, grey worm, Thoros of Myr, Jon snow, and Tormund Giantsbane, all badasses but we have little context for how strong they are, they get hurt (a lot) and pull through, Jorah beats most of an arena while being horribly diseased, ned (even if he cheated) survives a fight with Arthur Dayne, Beric is immortal so there's that, grey worm is intense af and kills many skilled men, Thoros charged the breach alone, Jon is really good and kills a walker, and Tormund is crazy,gets cut/stabbed so many times and just keeps killing, he might be the strongest on the list but no way of knowing for sure.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been watching some of Stannis and Jon's dialogues and it seems to me there are a lot of similarities and recurring themes between the two.

&amp;#x200B;

First, I'll start with their relationship in the show, which to me has always been interesting. Their first interaction is when Stannis arrives at the wall, and Jon recognizes him as the king: \[""I know he's the king! My father died for him""\]([https://youtu.be/difPkqg1lO8?t=200](https://youtu.be/difPkqg1lO8?t=200)). When the siege ends and Stannis stays at castle black, \[Jon has no problem bending the knee to Stannis.\]([https://youtu.be/ZRdPsLVyb-Y?t=169](https://youtu.be/ZRdPsLVyb-Y?t=169)), which is quite different than what happens with Jon later on when he encounters Daenerys. There are other great moments between them, such as when \[Stannis offers to legitimize Jon\]([https://youtu.be/kiww3Z6C884?t=129](https://youtu.be/kiww3Z6C884?t=129)). Later, when Jon gets elected and refuses Stannis offer, Stannis advises him to \[speak to Tormund to make peace with the wildlings, and get rid of Alliser Thorne\]([https://youtu.be/hbyUSCrY8QA?t=120](https://youtu.be/hbyUSCrY8QA?t=120)). In the same scene, Davos talks to Jon about how Stannis appreciates him. Stannis later shows this appreciation when he \[approves of Slynt's execution\]([https://youtu.be/KkU1VW5ODE4?t=279](https://youtu.be/KkU1VW5ODE4?t=279)), and \[has interesting insight about Jon\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYDfaG7Cj8U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYDfaG7Cj8U)). Stannis also trusts Jon with his ships, and other small stuff, but its clear that they appreciate each other. 

&amp;#x200B;

Second, Stannis former helpers find a new leader in Jon: Davos becomes his personal adviser and Melisandre views him as Azor Ahai. In other words, both see in Jon the same things they once saw in Stannis. What is interesting though is that they have parallel dialogues: \[Stannis: I never asked for this\]([https://youtu.be/O6FOHHwpW3g?t=266](https://youtu.be/O6FOHHwpW3g?t=266)) \[Jon: I never asked for it\]([https://youtu.be/cTVnKXkdzNE?t=178](https://youtu.be/cTVnKXkdzNE?t=178)). It is also interesting to note that when Stannis sends Jon to convince Mance to bend the knee, Jon tells him \[""Isn't their survival more important than your pride?""\]([https://youtu.be/iO\_IxtixRi0?t=102](https://youtu.be/iO_IxtixRi0?t=102)), which may sound familiar, \[because...\]([https://youtu.be/XM56ot00UNs?t=285](https://youtu.be/XM56ot00UNs?t=285)).

&amp;#x200B;

I may be looking too deep, but I think there are a lot of similar themes going on with both characters. What do you guys think? Comments appreciated!",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

A ravens top speed is probably slower then a dragon but for the sake of not doing long calculations before I go to bed lets just say 4x faster. 

Dragonstone is 1000 miles away? I'm sure it's farther then that. A raven flying at 50 miles an hour, maybe got lore, and a dragon flying at 200 mph back is going to take 24 hours. 

This doesn't include Gentry's running for the gate.Time to get a scroll written, time for the people who ""read it before"" Danny to have their turn then her to get it and decide to go. 

The episode makes it look like one night. But the night king controls the cold right? So he could of just frozen the lake again. He wanted them to send for Danny, he was ready with the spears, he needed the dragon to take down the wall?

Apologizes if this has been discussed before. I'm terrible with reddit search. I just can't believe he doesn't just refreeze the ice and kill them. Then Danny sees them dead, she never lands, goes home and cries a little and the story is different. Danny gets pissed burns everything, night king can't cross the wall happy ending.

&amp;#x200B;

In anticipation for the new (and final) season, what's some of your favorite theories or predictions for season 8??

&amp;#x200B;

Here's some of mine:

&amp;#x200B;

1.) Bran being all the Brandons throughout history. Bran is kind of a boring character, and kind of blah, I'll give people that. That being said, this theory wraps up Bran Stark in a neat little package for me. It takes a boring character and gives him some much needed depth. Here's a guy that's been going back in time and trying to do everything he can in order to stop the Long Night from happening. Bran the Builder....that was him building a wall. It's just a cool idea.

&amp;#x200B;

2.) Bran being the Night King. Again....let's take a boring ass character and make him much more enjoyable. This theory supposes that Bran wargs into the man that has an encounter with the children of the forest, he tries to stop them from making a mistake and stabbing him with dragonglass, but it happens anyway, and when the dragonglass turns the man into the Night King, Bran was stuck in him...and wahla! Bran is the Night King. It certainly is plausible considering the easter egg that showed the Wights forming the Stark Wolf Sigil in the Season 7 finale. Also, it could explain the fixation the Night King has on Jon Snow. 

&amp;#x200B;

3.) Tyrion being a Targaryen. Let's face it, most people can't stand the Lannister family, and most people like to root for underdogs. For me, Tyrion is one of the reasons I watch the show. Peter Dinklage is probably one of the most enjoyable actors on this show, and I feel exactly how Tyrion feels every time I watch him. I ACTUALLY felt his pain when he realized Shae was banging his pops. There's definitely proof that Tyrion is a bastard....Tywin tells him as much almost every interaction they have. ""Your no son of mine"".....etc. Also explains why he's so calm with the Dragons, and how much clout he has with them from the onset. 

&amp;#x200B;

4.) Cersei being killed by Jamie/Arya. This theory to me is a theory that can go either way. Look, we all know that Cersei will die. Maggy the Frog told us as much. It's been heavily debated on just who will be the one to kill her though. Some take her prediction that says a valonqar will kill her as meaning literally that HER younger sibling will kill her (Tyrion or Jamie), others argue that valonqar means that just A younger sibling will kill her (Arya Stark is a younger sibling of Sansa and Robb). So which way do they go? Show runners have done a great job not revealing which way they'll lean. Does Jamie do it out of jealousy of Cersei and Euron and her possibly getting knocked up by him? Does Jamie do it because he's finally sick of her deceit when he learns that she has no intention of ACTUALLY helping Jon and Dany out? Does Arya find a way into King's Landing and kill her? Or bonus......does Jamie die in battle, and does Arya steal his face and then go and kill Cersei???? That, for me, would be the best of both worlds for fans. Not only do they get to see Jamie kill Cersei, but then his face gets ripped off and it reveals that it was Arya, so fans get to see Jamie kill her, but find out it was Arya. It's like 1 murder by 2 people!!!!

Woke up with a ton of GoT hype for some reason, so here is my morning theory.

Apart of me thinks Cerseis Golden Company plan will fail or backfire because of the Targaryen connections (I.e. The Great Bastard Aegon Rivers who had originally created the Golden Company). I also think Daario will have a role in thwarting any plans Cersei has for the Golden Company. Cersei will either miscarry or birth a dwarf (or something will happen she doesnt like). Realizing she cannot defeat the fate that was predicted by the witch, shell decided to end her life ...amongst the living at least. Perhaps shell march right up to the Night King, surrender and bend the knee or whatever, and become the Ice Queen, for the only chance of revenge she could have...after all, a Lannister always pays their debts.

So Cersei is dooming them all to death in hopes that she can outnumber whatever is left because she cant outnumber them right now. But if the North were to fall, all of the dead would come back as a wight in the NKs army, increasing his numbers by tens or hundreds of thousands.

I read the first book in the ASOIAF a while back and I remember it mentioning something about promises being kept but I don't remember exactly what it was, maybe someone reading this does. I'm currently rewatching Season 1, and I've started to take notice of the promises being made. Catelyn makes Bran promise to never climb again - and we all know what happens next. Eddard promises Lyanna to keep Aegon's identity hidden from Robert to protect him. Catelyn promises Brienne that when the time comes Catelyn will not hold Brienne back from killing Stannis.

One promise I've found that is a bit more gray is when Eddard promises Aegon to talk about his mother the next time they meet. They never meet after this, so the promise hasn't been broken or kept as of yet. 

If you have any examples of promises kept or broken I'd be really interested to read them. Of course I'm not suggesting that everyone in GoT is true to their word - they're not. I'm only looking at instances where it's explicitly referred to as a promise. For example: I do not count Robb not keeping his word about marrying Walder Frey's daughter or Jaime breaking his oath as broken promises. Not vows or swears to the gods either.

One of the reasons I'm so interested in this is because I'm pretty dedicated to a theory concerning the forging of Lightbringer and identity of Azor Ahai as well and if it's true that promises are always kept then this exchange in Game of Thrones is in very strong favor of that theory:

""When the battle comes; promise you'll protect me"" - Davos.

""I promise"" - Shireen.",15,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

\-20 years ago is when magic really starts happening. That's when Mance Rayder starts joining the clans, and a couple other things about the white walkers that I can't think of right now. 

\-Ned Stark went to Winterfell to avenge his brothers and father right at that time...I can't think of another Stark who would have been in Winterfell. 

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't looked at EVERY post on here, but I haven't found this specific issue pointed out and am curious how this stacks up against the other theories.   

&amp;#x200B;

And I'm not trying to figure out why there must be a Stark in Winterfell (did the Children curse them? Were the Starks always the WWs? Was this part of the pact at the Isle of Faces?).  I'm also not trying to discuss how exactly the WWs woke up (the iron swords on the crypts rusted through and weren't replaced?)

""I see a darkness in you. And in that darkness, eyes staring back at me. Brown eyes, blue eyes, green eyes. Eyes you will shut forever.""

We know that Cersei's appearance is highlighted by her green eyes, especially in the book. This quite possibly means that Arya will be the one to kill her. I used to think Jamie would have a hand in her demise as we have seen his faith in her decline and Cersei's death would mean greater things for him and Brienne. This seems more plausible and if Arya reaccepts her fate as an assassin she should kill Cersei. This could be triggered by either a death of a loved one or someone's betrayal.
