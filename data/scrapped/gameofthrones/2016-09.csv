The Old Bear says something like ""we need men like Craster"" after Jon finds out about his sacrifices in S2, which could be referring to the sacrifices keeping the south safe (whether Jeor knows why or not, there could always have been men ""like Craster"" sacrificing babies to the WWs). 

Jeor also tells Jon about Craster worshiping ""crueler God's than you or I"" which implies he atleast knows about the WWs even if he doesn't fully believe in them. Then Jeor swiftly leaves with the men. 

I wonder if the stoppage of the sacrifices that resulted from the rebellion at Crasters partly resulted in the anger we're seeing in the WWs

but like many things Game of Thrones they leave a lot up in the air. But the one thing, for me, that stands out and makes me come to a decision of how she feels/ cares for Jon is summed up in the Battle of the Bastards.
She couldn't have cared less if Jon Snow lived or died. I mean the only person whom she had any possible connection to (family in this case) was Jon Snow. She let the battle begin and for him to face death (again) and then when the Knights of the Vale arrived she came to watch them smash Ramsay and his forces. Obviously unaware of what had happened to Rickon and if Jon was alive.
She obviously didn't seem to care if Jon survived... and I debated with friends of what she was emoting when she sees Jon giving chase to Ramsay. She didn't seem relieved to see Jon... but rather that she had spotted her enemy (Ramsay certainly and Jon as well as he is a rival to her, something she has learned to eliminate)
Not to mention Petyr Baelish is in her ear... it'll be Sansa v Jon next season most likely and I don't think it ends well.

(and no, not the 13th LC. I'm talking about the dude we saw on the show who marked Bran). 

Hear me out. I've read in multiple sources that the Last Hero went up to fight The Others with 12 companions. Now, remember at the end of season 3 when the Night King turns Craster's baby into a future WW, you can see behind him there are 12 other WWs. These could have been the 12 companions of who we know as The Last Hero.

Maybe all the stories were just wrong and because The Last Hero didn't make it back from the North the people made something up to make it sound heroic/hopeful.  The truth could be that the only way TLH could keep peace in the realm was by becoming the NK and keeping the white walkers at bay. I've heard folks theorize that this is what Jon might have to do, go up north and keep the WW at bay by becoming their new leader. Bittersweet enough for ya?

(Note: I know we saw the CotF create the first WW. But what if that guy was the one who lost to The Last Hero thus having to give him the WW crown)

ok so I haven't read any of the novels.  But after becoming current with the TV show's progress...:

I sure hope people from the Wall aka Night's Watch are sending ravens to all of Westeros telling them that dragon glass can kill white walkers, and that Valyrian steel swords do not shatter when they strike White Walker weapons, and can kill (shatter) white walkers.  (like, they should bring all remaining heirloom Valyrian steel swords to the wall and instruct even the lowliest of grunt soldier that, should the person wielding a Valyrian steel sword be killed, they should pick up the Valyrian sword and continue fighting.  

Also, why the hell isn't the NIght's Watch raising all hell and warning the 7 kingdoms, all of southern westeros, that they've made contact with white walkers and armies of the dead.  I'd think that'd be some pretty huge freaking news.  

Like, Stannis heard the call aka the raven from the blind nights watchmen, and came to the rescue.  but nobody else came to help?  In King's Landing nobody has mentioned the white walkers or army of the dead whatsoever, at least in the tv show.

Its scales were black as night, wet and slick with blood. Her blood, Dany sensed. Its eyes were pools of molten magma, and when it opened its mouth, the flame came roaring out in a hot jet. She could hear it singing to her. She opened her arms to the fire, embraced it, let it swallow her whole, let it cleanse her cleanse her and temper her and scour her clean. She could feel her flesh sear and blacken and slough away, could feel her blood boil and turn to steam, and yet there was no pain. She felt strong and new and fierce.  AGOT

.It's scales were black as night- Nights watch 

.Wet and slick with blood. Her blood- Targaryen blood or her blood on his hands maybe both 

.She opened her arms to the fire, embraced it, let it swallow her whole, let it cleanse her cleanse her and temper her and scour her clean- Azor Ahai used his wife's soul to temper his sword to create lightbringer  

To fight the darkness, Azor Ahai needed to forge a hero's sword. He labored for thirty days and thirty nights until it was done. However, when he went to temper it in water, the sword broke. He was not one to give up easily, so he started over. The second time he took fifty days and fifty nights to make the sword, even better than the first. To temper it this time, he captured a lion and drove the sword into its heart, but once more the steel shattered. The third time, with a heavy heart, for he knew before hand what he must do to finish the blade, he worked for a hundred days and nights until it was finished. This time, he called for his wife, Nissa Nissa, and asked her to bare her breast. He drove his sword into her breast, her soul combining with the steel of the sword, creating Lightbringer

Was she a young girl, swept up in love and forgot to leave word she was safe, and not to worry? After all, running away with the prone-to-burning King's married son, isn't good PR. In no world could that ever go over well. She knew. They knew. What happened?

And even if it escaped Lyanna to leave a note on the fridge, how did the Warden of the North and his heir, go from, ""Lyanna is missing,"" to, ""Lyanna is being kidnapped and raped! Let's ride south!""? Starting a war got so many men Lyanna loved, killed, and changed the course of history/

But, what if she did send a raven somehow? It's been told to us, that the Citadel order is not here for the Targaryen rule. And if you trust a certain Maester, the fall of dragons may actually be the work of the men in chains. So, it begs the question, would they ""misplace"" a Lyanna message? Do they have that power? 

And if so, could it be stored in a place Sam could discover it? 

I'm sure that's wishful writing, but creatively it would as one-two punch, show how the Maester strings can control and influence events like a Littlefinger wet dream. And give vital information into the past.

Instead I believe that Jon Snow right now is very similar to Coldhands, a wight who managed to maintain his humanity, who we now know for sure is Benjen Stark.

Consider the following: Every time the kiss of life has been shown in both the books and the show, the effects have been *immediate*. When Jon Snow came back to life it took a while. So long, in fact, that everyone had given up on him coming back and left the room. I think Jon Snow came back as a wight, and the fact that Melisandre had been involved was completely coincidental.

We know this has happened before, with Benjen Stark, and isn't it interesting that both Jon and Benjen are Starks? I feel like something about their blood is what kept Benjen from completely losing his humanity when transformed into a wight, and similarly is what's keeping Jon Snow mostly human in his undead form.",6,3,False,self,,,,,

However, there is another cure to greyscale that is discussed, by Stannis when he speaks to his daughter Shireen in season 5. He tells her, without going into specifics that they visited ""every maester, every healer, every apothecary...they stopped the disease and saved your life.""

This leads me to believe that if he doesn't seek out Quaithe, he may go a) into Westeros and go north, to find Davos, who may have information on how Shireen was healed.  Or b) he'll go to Westeros and run into Melisandre, who may either have information about Shireen or could possibly heal him herself (perhaps if the Lord of Light needs Jorah in the Great War...)

If Jon was a product of rape, wouldn't Lyanna tell Ned about it on her death bed. Leading Ned to do the most honourable thing by his sister is either kill the new born or leave it with someone else (because it's obviously not Neds way to kill a baby).

He would have shown more hate towards the Targaryens than he was originally written/shown or so I believe. In the books and the show he has raised Jon as if he was his own, he truly loves Jon as a father/uncle and has protected him from everyone who could threaten his life as best as he could, as well as not revealing his true parentage until his death.

Looking at the Night King's amulet tonight I saw something. I think it might represent a tower, quite possibly the tower Bran fell from in Winterfell. We don't see a full image of the tower in the show from what I could find, yet, it is clearly a rather slim round and high tower. It looks from the bottom it might have a pointy top.

The Night King and his amulet:

http://awoiaf.westeros.org/images/thumb/f/ff/Lino_Drieghe_Winterfell.JPG/350px-Lino_Drieghe_Winterfell.JPG

I always thought the Bran being the Night King theory was a stretch, but this would be pretty damn nice if it was actually Bran that made an amulet representing the very place where he got his powers, his first dream (the one he had during the coma --- books).

Jaime will lead a brave charge alongside Jon's Northern Army against the WW but will ultimately sacrifice himself to save Bran
2. The SANSA will unfortunately be killed. I think that it will be in self-sacrifice to take save Arya, or perhaps Jon, completing the SANSA's character arc from a girl who cared only for herself to someone who would do anything to protect those that she loves, like Cat and Eddard. Many have speculated about the look that the SANSA gave to littlethinger, but I think that the SANSA will ultimately foil littlethinger's plans in dramatic fashion.

Then I came here just to find that a lot of people hate her for reasons that, well, I can understand them but they do not make Catelyn the worst or most hateable character in the story (in my opinion)

We can all agree that Catelyn has had a lot of flaws and have done the wrong decission pretty often, but they are also understable and realist choice for the character, a mother that the only thing she wants is getting her family together. She takes a lot of blame for hating Jon, it's true that Jon is just an innocent boy but his only presence is the reminder of what Ned did. She didn't have any obligation to take care of Jon, and she did. Also I didn't see her mistreating Jon in any way. And yes, she was praying for the his dead, but when Jon almost died, she was the one who stayed all the night with him, praying for his life. 

Then again, kidnapping Tyrion was not smart but she trusted with all of her heart in Littlefinger and someone has tried to kill Bran, it makes sense for her to search for the culprit. The same with the incident with Jaime Lannister, not the smartest but understable. Also I think Catelyn has not the blame for the fall of the Starks, the end of the Stark was in the Redd Wedding and Robb was who caused that by marrying Talisa, even more, Catelyn was the one who advised him to not do that, that he had a commitment with Walder Frey.

And yes, Catelyn murdered Frey's favorite wife, but she believed her whole family (except Sansa) were dead. Do you really think she actually know what was she doing? You could see how Catelyn has died mentally before she did physically, so I don't think that we can blame her for it given the circumstances.

Actually, she takes the blame for everythin, but if some characters have listened to her they would have avoided a lot of deaths. Catelyn advised Ned not to go to KL, he went and died. Catelyn advised Bran about no climbing, he felt and indirectly started the feud between the Lannisters and the Starks. He advised Robb not to trust a Greyjoy and not marry Talisa, he did and this result in the fall of Winterfell and their own deaths. 

So, what's your opinion about Catelyn Stark?

So if Jon is the son(g) of Ice and Fire given he is Stark and Targ at the same time, also just want to point out a little interesting note before I move forward; we know by now there is power in kings blood and that does not mean Targ blood necessarily the blood of old Valyria is the key here where the dragons came from and whom tamed the dragons, additionally the blood of the first men is also the kings blood on the contrast whom basically the WWs came from and who defeated and keep the WW at bay. And  the Starks have that blood, meaning Jon is probably the only person ever to have those two ancient opposite, contrasting magical bloodlines in history which is pretty special of course.

My question is; I initially thought Jon is Ice and Dany is Fire naturally but if Jon is Ice and Fire and Dany is the Fire there needs to be a seperate Ice which is only ice without fire just like Dany's without ice fire. We can maybe assume WWs and the NK is the obvious Ice then aren't we supposed to assume that Dany/the dragons as fire are also villianous or evil in certain way/ or become so at some point (which is in my opinion quite likely)? If not WWs or the NK will be revealed to be not villianous or evil at some point?

The last option would be to name WWs and the NK as the ultimate evil (where would this put fire though) and we will be short of a pure ice, of the Stark kids maybe like Bran perhaps?

So in short if Jon is the son of ice and fire, what about Dany then? If she is fire who is ice? And if ice is WW and NK are they not evil? If they are evil, will Dany/dragons eventually become evil too?

So here it goes;

Jon/The North: Like most people this is the part I enjoy and like the most. First of all I think there will be some sort restructring of the North with regards to title and fiefs. Boltons are gone, Umbers and Karstarks will probably strip of any land and title so we have Dreadfort, Karhold and Last Hearth to be re-distrubuted. Wildings will definitely have to be settled for good this time and I can see Last Hearth going to them as Tormund their leader if not a lord in a traditional sense. Davos will be Northern Lord and rightfuly so as he has lost all holdings in the Stormlands, I think Karhold will go to Davos as the seat of House Seaworth of the North. Dreadfort I am not sure maybe brought down entirely to erase the memory of the Boltons. As for Jon's council I can see Davos being the Hand of the King, Tormund most definitely, Lord Glover and Lord Manderley seem like to fill the roster. The Vale clearly allied with the Starks and the North so they will in my opinion be another independent kingdom. I think LF will be the villain in the North but not for so long, we will get the idea and feeling a rift and tension between Jon and Sansa instigated by LF but I dont think it develop much further and Sansa and Jon will eventually stay loyal to eachother. I have my doubts Bran will reach to Winterfell this season or before the finale, dont know about the reason or cause but I think Bran and Meera can make a detour to Greywater Watch to meet up with Howland Reed as we know that Bran knows he was with his father at the ToJ and that he has survived, I think Bran will feel the need to reach out to him and clarify/confirm his visions with him. Also I suspect we will see very little from the WWs and if the Wall comes down it will be at the end of the season (I dont think Bran's mark will allow them to pass the Wall, that would be extremely stupid of Bran to not consider this and endanger the whole human race with this). I dont think Jon will find out his parentage this season or not before the finale and even then I think he will keep the knowledge to himself and if he is to ever leave his bastard name he will take the Stark name and remain true to his upbringing and be Ned's son.

Dany/Crownlands and South: First of all I am quite positive Dany and her fleet will be intercepted by Euron and his fleet and will suffer serious casualties, as it is she is quite invincible. Not sure if she will go directly to King's Landing or to Reach or Stormlands as a base of operations. I suspect she might use Dragonstone like her ancestors though. I imagine Euron and Cersei might become allies and Ironborn raiding the Reach. Not so sure about the Stormlands they might go either way.

Riverrun: I suspect since the Freys are all but gone and Arya and Edmure are in the Twins, Tullys will probably take control of the Riverlands. I can see Edmure and Jamie's conversation and agreement having a positive role in this happening. Riverrun under Tully control is most definitely declaring for the North.

Essos: Maybe some Jorah scenes before he sails to Westeros combined with a glance of Daario and Meeren situation. I dont think we will see much Essos next season.

I also think Cersei will naturally learn the situation in the North and the Starks before she learns about Dany and her fleet and so in her craziness will send an army to the North to deal with the situation (the North is not in a very healthy situation in terms of number of arms and resources at their disposal at the moment), a strong Lannister host most probably under Jamie's command. This would also enable Jamie to further his arc (before he kills his sister) and engage with Brienne, Edmure and the Starks. There may or may not be a big battle not sure how it would play out with Jamie in command. We will surely see some impressive battles in the Reach and the 

Crownlands between Ironborn and Tyrells, Crown and Dany or some other variation.
I think it is possible to introduce a new lord as a Lannister vassel or ally to even the scales a bit. Maybe the new Lord Paramount of the Stormlands.

Littlefinger is amazingly smart, incredibly cunning, extremely dilligent and most importantly, successful. He has all this going for him and declares undying love to boot. It seems like an easy sell except Littlefinger did a lot of shady stuff before such as selling Sansa to the Boltons and betraying Ned for the Lannisters so his integrity is questionable.

On the other hand, we have Jon who genuinely loves Sansa as his sister. Jon is strong, noble, honorable, a highly capable leader and almost certainly trustworthy. He might also be the rightful heir to the Iron Throne assuming he is trueborn. However, Jon basically took Sansa's position by becoming King in the North when Sansa had the blood right to rule as Lady of Winterfell. While Jon may love and trust Sansa, he would never offer her the kind of power and influence Littlefinger promises.

Both have a lot going for them. Littlefinger is the high risk, high reward option while Jon promises reliable returns. It is hard to judge which one is better.

There are also people who believe that through Howland Reed, Jon will learn the secret of his parents (either that or via Bran). Most assume that he will help Jon fighting the White Walkers and then tell him that R+L=J. 

But what if everything turns out a bit different? 
What if Howland Reed will indeed reveal the secret of Jon Snow's parents, but not to help him but to oppose Jon? 
We have the idea that Howland Reed is very loyal to the Starks and to the North. He even sends his kids to Winterfell, possibly knowing that Bran will need them. But nothing says that Howland Reed will be as loyal to a Targaryan!
Could it be possible that Howland Reed will just like the idea that not a Stark, but a Targaryen is ruling the North? Maybe he will reveal the truth to all other Northern houses, in hope of getting rid of this Stark-pretender and make Sansa Queen in the North.

If there will be a conflict between Jon and Sansa, as much people believe, this Howland Reed twist could perfectly fit in. Jon was proclaimed King because ""Ned Starks blood runs through his veins"". What better way to get rid of him, then to reveal he is no son of Ned at all.

I think Howland Reed as a villain to Jon, would be a very typical GRRM-twist.",14,8,False,self,,,,,

**2-** He got the three eyed raven, last remaining children of the forest, Summer and Hodor killed by being careless. Now this one is a huge mistake.

**3-** And it is everyone's guess that the mark on his hand is going to bring the wall down. Walkers need to pass the huge magical wall somehow and the mark is the only already established key to breaking the magic. If their leader suddenly brings a horn and uses it to break the wall its going to be a little lame I'd say.

So does he have some super epic knowledge or power that is going to save everyone? If that is just going to be telling Jon that he is Azor Ahai its cool and all but its not worth bringing the wall down on his way to Jon, is it?

I don't think any other book has given me feels of this caliber ever.

The lore of Westeros so far has been very rich, just as enthralling as the messy bits of real history and the actions and intrigue of individuals are truly riveting. 

As a result of this more realistic and historical direction, I am far more compelled to continue reading on this piece instead of LoTR, where ""The Hobbit"" was a total slogfest to read through. 

Additionally, I am grateful that the plot centers in on futile, petty human struggles over a rather unrelatable plot of elves, dwarves, and hobbits going on incredible adventures or whatever.

Adding on to that, this is all remarkably executed in the masterful placement of characters within groups.

Despite my intense hatred towards the Lannisters and all affiliated, I think Tyrion is a great foil to his rather crummy family members.

Adversely, I have my sympathies with the Starks, but absolutely can't stand Catelyn, even after Bran's ""incident,"" as well as Sansa. 

I am glad to have introduced myself to this series and cannot wait for what is in store in later installments.

Although I would like to get a heads-up when everything goes all wrong. I was actually inspired by the comminity of the anime/manga ""Berserk"" into reading this and heard they were similar.

Cheers!

Presumably, it should be the same magic that protected the tree of the Three-Eyed Raven, as it is also protected by the Children. In the finale of Season Four, one of the Children explained that ""[t]he power that moves [the wights] is powerless [in the tree],"" (unless there's someone marked by Night King apparently).

But what about in Season One? Othor was resurrected as a wight after he got brought into Castle Black and attacked Joer Mormont. The White Walkers' magic shouldn't be able to influence him while he's in the Wall, and if the magic lingered in him, then the magic shouldn't have been activated.

Furthermore, why do the members of the Night's Watch have to burn their dead while inside Castle Black anyway? To my knowledge, the Night King (or perhaps any White Walker) needs to personally reanimate the dead as wights. But the people who have died within the Wall should be safe from any White Walker influence. The act seems to be precaution derived from the incident with Othor, but that shouldn't have been possible in the first place.

It appears to me that this is all a plot hole, the Children lied to Benjen, the White Walkers have gotten stronger but refuse to attack the Wall for some reason, the Children's magic have withered over the centuries but the White Walkers refused to attack the Wall for some reason, the Children used a _weaker_ magic on the Wall than in the tree of the Three-Eyed Raven, or some other strange reason.",12,2,False,self,,,,,

Jon Snow (inheriting Winterfell)- Bastard, thus last in line for inheriting Winterfell.  debatably better than Robb as an overall leader.

Tyrion Lannister (Inheriting Casterly Rock)- 2nd in line, but hated by his father to the point where Tywin would likely have sooner had Cersei running Casterly Rock.  MILES better than Jaime and Cersei.

Daenerys Targaryen-(Inheriting the Iron Throne) Last in line after Rhaegar (who would have been good but let's face it, suffered from some catastrophically bad judgement) and Viserys (less said about that the better).

Myrcella 'Baratheon'- (Inheriting the Iron Throne) neither as brutal and insane as Joffrey, nor as weak-willed and naive as Tommen, admittedly she has very poor competition but still.

Margaery Tyrell (show) (Inheriting Highgarden)-  in the books she has sterner competition, but in the show it's her and Loras...  and all credit to Loras, as a potential leader, Margaery runs circles around him

Catelyn Tully- (Inheriting Riverrun) the only one ahead of her in the line of Tully succession is Edmure... point goes to Catelyn.

268,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2016-9-4,2016,9,4,2,50zy0m,self.gameofthrones,[EVERYTHING]Did Sansa suffer that much?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/50zy0m/everythingdid_sansa_suffer_that_much/,Leeroyjenkin5,1472925571,"S1 - Sansa is a spoiled girl that wants to get married to a high lord or a certain young prince. Then she is to marry Joffrey(she got her wish - to marry him). On the KR she even lies in favor of Joffrey, ending up killing her own direwolf, Lady. Joffrey then as we all know, executes Ned. 

S2 - Sansa has to endure Joffrey(psychologically), she only end up getting hurt(physically) over her pride. She eventually understand that. She is not touched sexually by anyone, including Joffrey. Sansa knows she has friends in KL and her brother is coming to save her. I want to point out again, she barely gets physically abused when she doesn't do what Joffrey tells her to. 

S3 - Knowing her family is coming to rescue her, she is basically a hostage living like a lord. Not having to marry Joffrey is a big relive. She shouldn't get sad when she has to marry Tyrion, maybe a bit disappointed. Tyrion is really nice to her, and never touches her or do anything mean at all to her. But what was her options? Either marry for political reason, or try to escape. She wasn't dumb, so she should have understood that the Lannisters would use her. If not I have overestimated her. At the end of the season the Starks gets slaughtered. That should have been close to just as hard for Jon and Arya.

S4 - Joffrey get murdered - Sansa escaped by the help of LF. She then catch up when her aunt Lysa in the Eyrie, there is not much of a connection there, before Lysa flies out of the Moon Door. 

S5 - Sansa is to marry Ramsay. She has the choice to not, but LF persuade her to do it. She then knows she is going to have at least one child with him, which means she has to have sex with him. On her wedding night she just stand there hoping they will go to separate rooms. If she just had taken her clothes off, got on her back and tried to act like ""fuck me like it's my last night in this world"", things might have been different. But however, getting fucked from behind like she was in the wedding night-scene didn't look painful. Yes, the dress she wore was destroyed, but she has more of those. The old lady still loyal to house Stark get flayed alive, before her heart gave up. Compared to that I think Sansa doesn't know how good she has it. Getting beaten a bit while having sex is not that bad compared to pretty much anyones fate/life in the Game of Thrones universe.

S6 - Sansa eventually rescued by Brienne Tarth of Tarth. Brought to Jon, Happy reunion. Confronts LF, and he plays her again, even after what she means she has been through. That pays off in the battle of the bastards. Doesn't inform Jon, ergo allies with LF(I think slowly understanding that herself). After watching Jon and hes followers get slaughtered by Ramsay's army, then LF saves the day. Jon still pulls through and take down Ramsay himself 1 vs 1. Still she plays the ""pittycard"" and she get the satisfaction by killing him. I don't think Jon cares too much for killing Ramsay himself, considering he is going to die anyway. And i'm fine with Jon letting Sansa execute him in which way that pleases her.

May be only my opinion but that is what i'm left with after rewatching S1-6. But before you think she had it bad, put it in perspective. Rich girl - gets her wish to marry the prince - not what she hoped for - family dies - gets played by LF and marrying another bad guy - revenge. If you look away from the family dying. Maybe a regular solider losing a leg in battle had it worse than Sansa? ",44,0,False,self,,,,,

I've thought of a few possibilities for how this might play out:

1. Jon/Bran- this one might be the saddest. Jon loves his family more than anything else and Bran seems destined to play a major role in defeating the WW. In this scenario he would likely see a vision and convince Jon that this is the only way to save the realm. Bittersweet ending, etc. 

2. Stannis/Shireen (books only!)- I think that this will actually play out in the books but be unsuccessful (Stannis is obviously not Azor Ahai). Whether Stannis takes Winterfell or not, he will eventually return to castle black and face an attack from the WW. I think that amidst dire circumstances, Mel will convince him that if he does not reforge Lightbringer then they will all die. While Shireen is burning, he will drive his sword through her heart (at least sparing her more agony) but remove it to find that it is not aflame. This will absolutely destroy him and he will succumb to the WW attack while the rest at castle black escape. 

3. Jon/Dany- this seems like the most straightforward possibility, which probably reduces it's likeliness. However, there are natural arcs that would end here for both characters, but especially Dany. She has been entirely set on securing the iron throne and conquering Westeros, but the threat of the WW Could convince her that she is destined to save the people instead of merely ruling them. It would also fit with both characters technically fulfilling the prophecy. 

4. Dany/Jorah- could go either way directionally but would be rough given Jorah's love for Dany. Dany seems to love him as well, though in a different way.

These are a few that I can think of- are there any other realistic possibilities that would really F with the audience/readers?

I'm going to try to make an argument that I would like for others to consider and perhaps disprove.

In the Iliad Achilles brother Patroclus dies. Achille's stands atop the trenches. And tries to face the entire army by himself. He screams with such rage the entire battle stops and the enemy cowers in fear IIRC.

In GOT Jon Snow does something similar, as his brother gets killed, he charges straight into the enemy ready to fight all of them single handedly.

While I fully recognize that they may just be similar in context, but I feel that the scene may be meant to work as a parallel between the two characters considering the creators of the show are quite intelligent I could see them creating this parallel on purpose.

One of the features of the show that's great - that the book doesn't have so much is the road buddy convention.  Westeros is big and it's a medieval culture and it takes a while to get around.  The show has paired interesting folks to not only travel together but to have character building - non essential road encounters/adventures and campfire / road discussions.  A lot of exposition is done by people talking while traveling or camped.   Road buddy combinations have included:  Tyrion &amp; Bronn, Brienne &amp; Jaime, Jaime &amp; Bronn, Arya &amp; the Hound, Varys &amp; Tyrion, Brienne &amp; Pod and others I'm sure the comments will disclose.   
    
I think the road buddy convention is likely extinct (or almost extinct) now though - as last season and the next two - the pace of the show is picking up as we near the end.  We don't have time for road buddies.     
    
Now that it is probably retired - it was fun to see the start of the road buddy convention.  In Episode 2.  First King Robert and Ned have a little talk on a roadside lunch table set up on the King's Road.  They talk about running off together and their (mostly Robert's) old war time flings, and a little about Daenerys.  And then a bit later Tyrion and Jon Snow (very interesting as both are still very relevant) have a chat about books and other things as they eat some campfire food on the Northern Road to the Wall.  
    
What were your favorite road buddy scenes and buddy combos?  Do you think we'll have any more?  ",3,1,False,self,,,,,

A few notes on the way succession worked here, since the article doesn't mention all of it. I'll be making use of this family tree **[here](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/asoiaf/images/9/94/BaratheonTree.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140802162031&amp;path-prefix=zh).** 

Firstly, female-line succession would normally be irrelevant. However, since the Baratheons appear to be extinct in the male line, female-line succession does in fact come into play. Going up the line from King Robert, Elyanna is the first woman we come to with surviving descendants. Her sister Lyria also has descendants (House Crakehall) but Elyanna is older, so her Lannister descendants inherit instead. With that brief female blip out of the way, male-line succession resumes, all the way to the children of Tywin Lannister.

Secondly, I've been seeing some posts about how the line of succession leads back to the Targaryens somehow. This is incorrect. Yes, it's correct that Robert was picked over Ned and Jon Arryn to be the new king because he had a Targaryen grandmother. But that was just to make the succession look more legitimate. Robert was never actually the Targaryen heir; Viserys was. Legally speaking, Robert's claim was founded only on right of conquest, which means that rulership is predicated on Baratheon blood now, and Targaryen blood is irrelevant. (Obviously Dany's going to try to right-of-conquest the Targaryens back into power, but that doesn't affect the question of who the rightful ruler is now.)

So do any surviving Targaryens have Baratheon blood? As you can see on the tree, Robert's grandmother Rhaelle was in fact a Targaryen, but that doesn't give the Targaryens Baratheon blood. Rhaelle's descendants would all be Baratheons. The Targaryens do have Baratheon blood from Orys Baratheon's great-granddaughter Jocelyn's marriage to Aemon Targaryen. However, Jocelyn was several generations before Elyanna Baratheon's marriage into the Lannisters, and so the Targaryen claim is inferior to the Lannister claim. 

Lastly, it's a little unclear which of the Lannister siblings should be inheriting. And here's the only spot where I think Cersei is on weak legal footing. If I recall correctly, women aren't allowed to sit on the Iron Throne. They're especially not allowed to sit on the Iron Throne if there's a male heir available. The rightful heir to the Baratheon name is therefore Jaime or Tyrion. Which it is depends on a somewhat ambiguous scene in which Tommen sends Jaime to the Riverlands. It's my belief that Tommen removed Jaime from the Kingsguard in that scene, which would make Jaime Lannister the rightful king of Westeros. However, it's possible that that was merely a special mission, in which case Jaime remains a member of the Kingsguard and is unable to inherit. In that case, the rightful king of Westeros is Tyrion Lannister. ",34,41,False,self,,,,,

I think Margaery Tyrell would be the most effective ruler.  If she was queen she would be the real power behind the throne and would be the de facto ruler especially with Tommen as King.  She knows how to play the game and I think would be a very effective ruler.

Although it was certainly unexpected for Jon, he finds himself in this position of power heading into the coming wars. The last we see of Sansa in the season also shows her staring off at Peter because of her suspicions. For me, season 7 will involve Petyr trying to manipulate Sansa in some way to ultimately win him the north. At first, she will be totally against it, but over time certain events will cause her to question which side she is on. Petyr will notice the vulnerability and begin to capitalize on it. I think it will get to the point where Sansa and Petyr will have a plan in store to win Sansa the north. Sansa will get to the point where the plan is about to happen and she is torn between the decision. My ""big"" prediction is that this is the point where Jon Snow's parentage will be revealed to the characters on the show. I'm not sure who (Bran, Howland Reed, etc.) will reveal it, but it will be done. This will send Sansa and likely the kingdom into a flurry of emotions because they now know that R+L=J. Also with that comes that Sansa will find out that Ned lied to Catelyn this entire time just to keep his sister's promise. People in the north respected Ned and his honor to another level and I think that will sway Sansa into the direction of betraying Petyr for Jon. Her own father will show her one last sign of direction... that family is truly all you can depend on.",14,8,False,self,,,,,

With the reduced troop count, wonderfully crafted armies, and game-changing additions of Ports and Castles, not to mention the expanded Domination mode with seats of power, objective cards, maester (ability) cards, and special units, this edition of risk is one of the most involved and entertaining tabletop games I've ever played. 

One of my only complaints with the game, beyond rule changes my group of friends and I instated to better balance matches, is the lack of a number of Great Houses and other factions. While the game includes 7 contenders for victory (Stark, Baratheon, Lannister, Martell, Tyrell, Targaryen, and Ghiscari), other notable sides include houses Tully, Greyjoy, Arryn, and even houseless entities like the Dothraki. 

In lieu of a non-existent official expansion ever being released, what would be the best way to make more content for this game come to fruition? The pieces:

aren't terribly complex, although 3D printing isn't particularly good with small things. 

The player boards

are good quality, and the character cards like Ned Stark, Danerys Targaryen, and Stannis Baratheon all offer unique effects with a generic picture of the character.




Are there any companies, game shops or freelance contractors who would create a fan-made expansion? It would be so cool to command the Crow's Eye's fleet, or Khal Drogo's horde. ",1,13,False,self,,,,,

I recently re-watched the whole series with my wife.  It was her first time and she made many educated guesses and at times was more bloodthirsty then the character in the series.  Her prefer punishment of Ramsey was quite bad but beside the point.  She did point out something I had noticed, but noticed how bad it was about the battle of bastard.  So combining both complains about the episode.
Now before I start, cinematic the episode was one of the best I have seen, but just because it was great visual does not mean its good story wise.

The first complain was of course Sansa never mention Littlefingers offer, but lets ignore that. No point beating a dead horse.
The first complaint was when they tried to gather forces and the reply they got. The house Glover had just received help from the Boltons to retake the castle from the Ironborn. Yet they completely that they are in this mess because of the house Boltons.  The Red wedding killed off the forces that normally would come to their rescue in such matter. Had The Boltons not betrayed house stark  then they would have gotten their castle back much earlier.  And this goes for most of the trouble in the north at the moment.  Jon stopped temporary the raid from the wildlings. But the problem with the Ironborn was made worse by the red wedding and the death of many of the lords and their banner men.  They should be eager to join forces with Jon if not for the mere chance of revenge.

Secondly did Jon completely forget all his years living in Winterfell?  Or that he climbed the great wall?  He got 2000 wildings that would jump the castle walls with ease.  Climbing icewalls are actually more difficult than climbing rock. He also knows the layout and with Sansa they know most of the new additions.  

The whole Rickon scene. What was the point? Lets just kill another Stark? What bad writing, bring him back for two scenes one where he dies and no spoken words. They could achieved the same scene with having Jon trying to saving anybody from his past in Winterfell as a boy that he liked. Beside what way to make Jon look like an idiot. Yay. Ramsey got to look smart and cruel again.  Just in case we have forgotten. Which we didnt because they kept showing us it. Sorry but guess they think we the audience have a memory of a goldfish. 
Why not let us see why Jon is a good warrior and general.  Why not give him one flawless victory like Dany? And what is with the good guy have to almost loose before he can win?  Saved in the absolute last second? Are all the good guys stupid? 

I love the show but the writers are seriously trying to destroy my love for the series. 

Now what could they have done?


The battle of the bastards could have been a room by room claustrophobic fight of Winterfell. 
All they needed to do to equal the playing field would be to sneak in a force during the night over the wall and open the gates.  If they absolutely wanted to kill Rickon then it would have made a good fight against the watch as they tried to prevent Ramsey to get to the dungeon and use him to negotiate. It would also show us Ramseys reaction when his master plans fails and he has to improvise. Think all cramped hallways, dead soldiers people slipping on the blood, surprise attacks from all sides. You could have Ghost stalking the halls and have solider see the shadow of ghost and turn to run just to face a bloody Jon. Advancing his reputation. Ghost could end up against Ramseys hounds.  We hear the growls and black. At the end of the episode we see Ghost sitting with Jo, well feed. 
And it would be fun to see Littlefingers face when he arrives and is too late to be the rescuer.

Battle outside the Winterfell
If they want a big battle scene,   give Jon a bigger army and let him use the knowledge of the area.  Have the wildlings have one task, to sneak around, climb the walls and retake Winterfell. And leave the battlefield to the Northen houses. Use the justification of The north remembers and this is personal for them. The have the Umbers be what we wanted them to be and betray Ramsey and save Rickon. Again when the knights of the vale arrives its all over or they are there the whole time and is part of the forces.  And give the Giant a weapon and give him better Armor. At least give him a bow as showed during the assault on the wall.

Or they could combined the two, but instead we got a beautiful filmed generic battle with no surprises, no twist (except the lack of surprise and twists). It was lazy writing, just like the whole Arya stabbing scene.",23,0,False,self,,,,,

Would Marg happily pass the crown to Dany and go back to Highgarden? Or would Marg not give up without a fight?


I know Dany has the dragons, armies and ships (however in this case, let's say the Tyrell's never ended up in Dany's allience).
On the other hand house Tyrell's are one of the most wealthiest families in Westros (cojoined with the Lannisters) as well as having the second largest army.


Not to mention how strategic and manipulative Margaery actually is, as opposed to Tommen. Therefore she could probably talk her way out many situations. 

Many citizens and the people of Kingslanding also highly respect Margaery. Not so much for Daenerys for being the daughter of the Mad King. So maybe they would back house Tyrell which would be in her favour.

While this theory is quite based, I believe it can go deeper.

Remember, Syrio was the first sword of Braavos, prior to being brought to king's landing by Eddard to teach Arya how to fight. But if Syrio is, indeed, a faceless man- why would he come? If Ned bought him, why not use him for, say, killing Cersei? The answer is simple:

**Eddard Stark is a faceless man.** He brought Syrio over to train Arya instead of sending her to Braavos, which would be suspicious. But I doubt Arya is the only child he had trained. Remember that one time Robb changed his face to that of his direwolf? Or when Sansa's hair suddenly turned black? Bran turning into Hodor and even Jon's resurrection? **The Stark children (plus Hodor) are ALSO faceless men.**

""But Jon can't be a faceless man!"" I hear you say. ""He is the prince that was promised! Azor Ahai! Alond with Daenerys probably or maybe not idk!"". Well to that I say two things:

A) How can BOTH Jon and Daenerys be Azor Ahai? Clearly **Daenerys Targeryan is a faceless man.**

B) Who's to say Azor Ahai can't also be a faceless man? We'll come back to that one later.

Since we've shifted over to Danny, let's look at her story for a bit. She is one of the faceless man, so **Viserys probably is as well.** They've grown up together in Braavos, after all. Let's look at other characters surrounding her:

The unsullied are trained to be rid of their ""selves"" in a way. **The 8,000 unsullied are all faceless men.** Remember Daario actor change from season 3 to 4? Actor change my ASS! **Daario Naharis is a faceless man.** I won't get into too much detail but just know that **Missandei is a faceless man as well.**

As you can see, **everyone is just a bunch of faceless men.** But how does that affect the prophecy of the prince that was faceless I mean promised? How can all the Jaqens defeat the white faceless SHI-

Well, if everyone is, indeed, the same person, then all sign apply to them equally. Danny's waking of dragons? Danny = Jaqen = Jon. Therefore Jon awakened dragons from stine Q.E.D.

Lastly, let's consider Jaqen as he is described in ACOK: His hair is red on one side and white on the other. For some reason people always consider blue as the color of ice, but ice is more white than anything. Clearly his is a hair of Ice and Fire. But blue is the color of water, so if fire and ice do indeed meet, then there should also be shades of blue, going by this metaphor. Do we know of a character who has red blue AND white as their hair color?

This seems like a stretch but YES. YES WE DO. [It's her.](http://img.cinemablend.com/cb/4/8/0/4/f/9/4804f95181c7410b0955f5ea3a55ce49fb03162f96ed7d856f41c6fd50952c51.jpg)

**Harley Quinn, a.k.a Jaqen H'gar, a.k.a Azor Ahai, the prince that was promised, mother of dragons, king in the north, warden of the east and the west, the three eyed crow, grand maester and lord commander of the night's watch.**",25,0,False,self,,,,,

487,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2016-9-6,2016,9,6,5,51b8uw,self.gameofthrones,[NO SPOILERS] Why didn't Aegon make Orys Baratheon Warden of the East?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/51b8uw/no_spoilers_why_didnt_aegon_make_orys_baratheon/,Alchrops,1473105607,"Ever since getting immersed into the AGOT mod for Crusader Kings 2, I've always wondered as to why Aegon didn't make Orys Baratheon the Warden of the East.

Firstly, what, or rather who, is the Warden of the East? According to [the Wiki of Ice and Fire](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Warden_of_the_East) the Warden of the East ""the person responsible for the defense of the eastern coasts of the Seven Kingdoms"". This makes the Warden of the East, in my opinon, the second most important Warden. The Warden of the South would have likely been the most important as Aegon would have likely been worried about Dornish incursions, although after Dorne joined the Seven Kingdoms this position has became much less important. The Warden of the North, whom I consider the third most important, would only have to worry about a massed attack from the North if the Wall fell, which was probably viewed as ridiciulous at the time, as the Night's Watch was still fairly strong in Aegon's day, and even to this day, most Lords of the Seven Kingdoms dismiss the Northern threat. The Warden of the West is probably the least important title as, to the knowledge of the Westerosi there's nothing beyond the Sunset Sea.

So overall, the Warden of the East is probably one of the most important positions in Westeros, especially during Aegon's time. So who could he have picked for this position? There are two Great Lords that hold land on the Eastern Coast of Westeros. The Arryns of the Vale and the Baratheons of the Stormlands. The Lords of these houses in Aegon's time were [Ronnel Arryn](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Ronnel_Arryn_(king)) and [Orys Baratheon](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Orys_Baratheon).

Lets review each of the candidates. Firstly, Ronnel Arryn. He was merely a child during Aegon's Conquest, and presumably was still so after being named the Warden of the East. This of course makes us wonder why Aegon chose this boy over Orys (more on that later). However, rather than the person, Aegon may have chosen the bearer of the title based on the *land* they control. According to [this](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Military_strength) the Vale is about equal to the North which could raise 30 000 men during Aegon's conquest. On the other hand, during the War of the Five Kings, Renly's host was said to number 90 000 (80 000 at Bitterbridge and 10 000 at Highgarden, possibly more as Renly claims he has over a 100 000 men, although this could be exaggeration), 50 000 of these men were probably Tyrell men, as [Possible Spoliers](#b ""that is how many men Lord Mace Tyrell promised to Joffrey""). This makes the Stormlands capable of raising 40 000 men during the War of Five Kings. Presumably, this number would be lower during Aegon's Conquest due to population growth. So the amount of men the Vale and the Stormlands could raise were probably more or less the same during Aegon's time. However, in this regard the Arryns held a siginificant advantage over the Baratheons. They had a *fleet*. In any engagement with the Essoi, the war would mostly be fought on the Narrow Sea, and the Stormlands, due to the frequent storms of Shipbreaker Bay, had no fleet whatsoever. In my opinion, this is the only advantage Ronnel Arryn has over Orys Baratheon.

Now, onto the other candidate, Orys Baratheon. Orys was the rumoured half-brother of Aegon and is said to have been the King's only friend. Orys had a large amount of military experience as he was one of Aegon's chief generals during the Conquest and the Dornish War (is that the correct name? I think so). This makes him a much better candidate to lead the armies of the Realm than a simple child who handed over his crown for a ride on a dragon (well, admitidelly it was probably his mothers decision to avoid the pointless deaths of Valemen). However, there are two factors which may have made Orys the worse condidate (actually there are three, more on that later). Firstly, he already held an incredibly important position as Hand of the King and Aegon may have considered holding both positions to be too much pressure (this is a bit shaky as Tywin Lannister was Hand of the King and Warden of the West at the same time). For the other reason we need to consider precisely when Aegon created this title, or specifically, before or after the failed Dornish Conquest. As some of you may know, Orys lost his hand during this war, which in Aegon's eyes may have made him unsuitable for command. However, this is incredibly unlikely as having just one hand doesn;t affect your ability to command an army. We have to remember that Aegon *trusted* Orys, which is precisiely the reason why I think Orys *wasn't* chosen.

It's very possible that the title of Warden wasn't supposed to be one that granted command over the Realm's armies, at least in practice. Aegon had just conquered (almost) an entire continent and his rule was very shaky in the early years. He may have invented the title of Warden to secure the loyalty of the 3 Great Houses that surrendered bloodlessly (the Starks, Arryns and Lannisters). The last Warden title was granted to the Tyrells who were the only ones who had an actual threat to protect the Realm from, the Dornish (Aegon didn't need to secure the Tyrell's loyalty as he had raised to rule the Reach after the death of the Gardeners). The lords without a Warden title were the Tullys of Riverrun, the Greyjoys of Pyke and the Baratheons of Storms End.

The Tullys were already loyal to Aegon as he liberated them from the tyranny of the Ironborn and granted them the rule of the Riverlands and the Greyjoys were probably loyal, as the Ironborn respected strength (which is something Aegon showed in copious amounts during his Conquest) and Aegon showed great magananimity in allowing the Ironborn to chose their new Lord Paramount (sorry for using AGOT CK2 terms, it's just the most convienient) in respect of their traditions. Also, I doubt Aegon considered the Ironborn to be much of a threat, as they couldn't really raise a large army and the only way they could threaten him was by sea, and wooden ships aren't known to be dragon-proof. Finally, Orys was Aegon's close friend, so he didn't need to give him a simple title to earn his loyalty.

She is constantly thinking about who she will marry to fulfill the 3 headed dragon prophecy. At one point, she considered Jorah and Daario could be the other two heads. If she found out there was another Targaryen out there, I believe she would marry him in a heartbeat.

Bring extra Tinfoil.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/51h583/everything_gods_and_religions_tinfoil_theory_time/,Opinionated-Legate,1473192412,"So this is my super tinfoil theory regarding random thoughts I've had about the gods and religions of the Game of Thrones universe in the show. While I've read the books up to now, I'm focused mostly on the show with this, though if there is corroborating evidence in the books (it has been quite some time since I last read them) or evidence to the contrary I'd love to hear it. 

So it occurs to me in the world of Westeros and Essos that the religions of the world are rather tolerant. Outside of the fervor of the High Sparrow and other isolated instances, there hasn't seemed to me to be a lot of violence based solely on religion. In Westeros itself we have a wide variety of religions. The Seven, the Old Gods, the Drowned God, the Lord of Light/Red God, servants of the Many Faced God . . . and everyone seems generally pretty tolerant of other religious views. 

With this, my theory is that the gods are tolerant of each other because they understand the threat that the White Walkers pose. What do gods want? worship. What do they not have if the White Walkers take over the world and usher in The Long Night? People to worship them. 

So I believe that we are seeing, in the show, the manifestation of the gods to fight the threat of the White Walkers. Euron Greyjoy is the manifestation of The Drowned God, and I think he will end up siding with Daenerys and Yarra and Theon. He's too cunning to risk fighting them, and he will have a part to play, even if he tries to double cross everyone. 

Bran is the manifestation of the Three Eyed Raven, essentially the Old Gods, seeing as how his power is very closely related to the Weirwoods. He is quite obviously going to have a part to play in the conflicts ahead. 

We have the ideas of the Prince that was Promised, which I think will be a manifestation of the Red God, given power to bring Light to the darkness. 

Arya is the manifestation of the Many Faced God. As she learns in the House of Black and White, she is indeed ""No One"" but she is also Arya Stark. I think this is her special gift, as it were. Her power will grow and she is going to do some scary stuff. 

The Seven are hard to look at, but I think we may see them interspersed with other gods. Dany is a Mother of Dragons, and is known for her mercy in some regards, but is also a bringer of justice and a fighter, etc. 

While this theory is half slapped together, it's a fun concept to think about. Lots of holes to be sure, it most likely won't be even a concept in the show, but, again, it's fun. ",16,7,False,self,,,,,

Some people call it an axe and others have called it a halberd or scythe, but I think that this pole-arm with the forward swept blade has more resemblance to the falx than any other weapon.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falx

I think this is good to point out because this a perfect weapon choice for this antagonist. It is a weapon that was mostly used by ancient Thracians and Dacians before the peak of the Roman Empire but it was an incredibly powerful and devastating weapon. It could cut through Roman shields and pierce Roman armor and it basically forced them to reinforce the tops of their shields and helmets*. The only reason it wasn't a more prevalent weapon was because it didn't leave a hand free to use a shield. 

But the Night's King doesn't need a shield because he's the motherfucking Night's King. It's also a scary and powerful looking weapon that is reminiscent of the scythe used by Death himself, but not as cheesy as an actual scythe. It also makes sense because the first White Walkers were made from the first men, who were similar to the semi-advanced ancient civilisations such as the Dacians and they could have easily used similar weapons.

*The same thing has also been said about the Kopis, but it's a very similar type of weapon in the form of a one handed sword.  ",39,144,False,self,,,,,

One of the most epic fights in all of Game of Thrones, but there appear to be a few things off.

So according to the ASOIAF and GoT wiki, there were 6 Northmen and Ned Stark who rode to the Tower of Joy in order to fight the Kingsguard who were there and rescue Lyanna Stark.

The Northmen are:

- Eddard Stark (Named in the show)


- Howland Reed (Named in the show)


- Willam Dustin

- Ethan Glover

- Martyn Cassel

- Theo Wull

- Ser Mark Ryswell


Now, in the show we see [this lot](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MgFPVae1Cb8/maxresdefault.jpg), with five of the six pictured [here](http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Larson-GameofThrones2-1200.jpg) in better quality.

In the second picture, from left to right you have: Howland Reed, Generic Northman, Ned Stark, *Salty Dornishman*, Generic Northman. At ~1:20 you see another Northern-lookin' fella without  a helmet. 

None of the men look particularly like a ""Northern Mountain Clansman"" (Theo Wull), and one of the men appears to be Dornish. 

Also of note, there are only 2 Kingsguard defending the tower, that we see participate in a fight. 


Those two are Arthur Dayne and one that we can assume to be Oswell Whent, as the second Kingsguard's dialogue mimics Whent's in the book (""Your friend the Usurper would be lying beneath the ground if we were there""/""Woe be to the Usurper if were were there""). Gerold Hightower is noticeably missing from the fight.


I just wanted to know if anyone had any speculation as to why they went with a Dornishman in Ned Stark's riding group, and if that might be any significant character in the book. 


I would assume they left out Gerold Hightower simply to make the fight less complicated, but if anyone else has any suggestions as to why he was not in the fray I'd love to hear.

I think that, due to the fact that Westeros as a whole owes them a ridiculous amount of money, they will send a relatively large invasion force of sell swords to invade the continent. As they arrive, they see the fact that the White Walkers are threatening to destroy the country. Seeing Westeros as an investment/their property, they fight to save it. They succeed, and in the end Westeros has no king, no queen, no one set ruler. Instead, Westeros becomes a province of the Iron Bank.

&gt;In February, of this year while chatting on a podcast, showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss discussed a scene they were currently writing, describing something  that had happened today.  They mention changing a particular scene from an interior, 4-character scene set in the throne room to a massive parade through Kings Landing, which would essentially become a 3-day extravaganza with a thousand extras in Dubrovnik. Was it an idle mention, as locations werent locked in back then, or is the show indeed headed back to Croatia? And if so, what is that small scene that may have become so large (unless the other producers smacked them on the hand and told them to scale it back)?

The idea that he is the Night King actually screws up the timeline of events. Currently the idea is that the Night King was the 13 commander of the nights watch, but the show would potentially make him the first other. This does not work with the idea that he fell in love with an Other and was there was already a wall built, if it is the same person we see in the show that the CotF turned.


Additionally the idea that the Last Hero and Azor Ahai were alive at the same time, but were different people does not make sense. Why were there need to be 2 heroes? There wouldnt, it is more likely that Azor Ahai existed before the wall was made and at the same time as the Great Other. Based on the books basically repeating ideas like the dance of dragons, it would not be surprising that this repetitive history would apply to the Prince and Azor Ahai.  (The Great Other that is seen on the show with 12 others that look the exact same most likely are all of the same blood as Craster and his kids that gives to the Others. Taking Crasters kids could be to give some youth to the Army of the Others as they look insanely old, most like extreme slow aging is a part of the transformation after the touch from The Great Other. The Craster bloodline has similar properties to magic, but the kind that is for the ICE; like Targs are changed the closer to the magic that involves the dragons. This is evident by the changing of the skin and eye color changes.) 


First wave of the Others versus men would have been the Great Other and Azor Ahai. Having defeated the Great Other, although most likely just forcing him to retreat to the Land of Always Winter, was consider to have won. 
Second Wave of the Others: Eventually you have the Pact and the wall built, then the Nights King would we have not actually seen, just misinterpreted as the Great Other in the show; would come to be and that is where the Last hero comes in and defeats the NK.


The idea of there being Valerian steel being used to make Lightbringer actually works. (History tells us that, for the longest time Christopher Columbus was the first explorer to reach what is North America, which is incorrect; Vikings arrived a long time before. A fact that most did not know or remember) If you apply the same history situation, Valyrians could have arrived to Westeros a long time before or even arrived at Dorne; with them migrating north and bringing their swords; but are missing from the known history.


The events in the show involving The Others and Azor Ahai Reborn or Prince that was promised is most likely the third round. The major difference is that The Others waited thousands of years, all while building the largest army he possibly could, having learned and failed twice previously.",12,4,False,self,,,,,

In the beginning it seems like the Lannisters hate the Starks more than the Starks hate the Lannisters. It seems like the Lannisters really don't like the Starks and the Starks are neutral about the Lannisters. The Lannisters don't want to go to Winterfell. They don't want to eat dinner or do anything with the Starks.

After the Rebellion the Lannisters could have ended up in a lot worse position. They were the last ones to join the rebellion. The Starks could have asked for a bigger role in the kingdom, but they just went back to Winterfell. The Starks basically did the Lannisters a favor. The Starks do not visit Kings Landing. Eddard hasn't seen Robert in years. They do not care what happens in Kings Landing. They only care about the North and they want to stay in Winterfell. So again they are doing the Lannisters a favor. The Lannisters are happy in Kings Landing the Starks are happy in Winterfell. In fact I would like to think that the Lannisters would be wanting to go to Winterfell and hang out with the Starks. The Lannisters never go to the North so with the King coming north to ask Eddard to be hand of the king it would seem like a nice road trip. Great time to work on a neutral business relationship and try and make a stronger relationship since Eddard is going to be hand of the king. Eddard is possible to work with too. Hes an intelligent and honorable person. If the Lannisters make sense then the Starks will listen to reason. 

The Lannisters really should love the king because the king doesnt care what the kingdom does. All he wants to do sleep with whores and kill things. Which is perfect for them. Jamie and Cersi can be happy in their relationship. Jamie doesnt have to worry about the King raping or hurting Cersi because hes fucking whores and going on hunts to kill things. 

I have a feeling that Cersi and the King never really had a happy sex life and I would like to think that the King would be smart enough to realize that Cersi is getting pregnant when she really shouldnt be. But apparently he doesnt seem to care because shes gotten pregnant three times. The king or the hand of the king hasnt figured out in twenty years that the kids arent the Kings. The king also doesnt seem to care that none of his children look like him. Joffery is like seventeen, Tommen is like five or so and the hand of the king had just barely start to get curious before he was killed.

With the King owing a ton of money to the Lannisters and not really caring that his kids arent his that it wouldnt be out of the question to be able to make a deal so that everyone is happy. Not to mention Eddard wouldnt kill the kids anyway. Best case scenario for the Lannisters is that everything stays the same as it is and Joffery is air to the throne. Worst case scenario is that the Lannisters have to pack up and go back to Casterly Rock. ",22,0,False,self,,,,,

She will end up having an army of dead and Qyburn and the Mountain are actually the biggest hints of that.

Haven't you always found it a bit weird that all the story told in 5 books and 6 seasons was really about some throne games, conflicts and alliances between houses and characters, some secrets about characters, prophecies, love stories, revenge stories, politics etc. and suddenly in the last book and season it will be about something entirely else, about a Night's King and his army? 

I have always thought it would be weird and felt like there must be a connection. Because in storytelling the ultimate villain is either a character we know, or it is connected to some potential villain characters we know. For example, in Lord of the Rings Sauron is the ultimate bad guy, and although we don't get to see and know him much, we see his servant Saruman, also a major antagonist who eventually desires Sauron's power for himself. He is a character that starts as a grey character but at some point turns into a completely evil character. 

If we didn't have Saruman it wouldn't be a good storytelling because readers or watchers need to be familiar with villains. If we didn't have Saruman, Sauron would just stand there as an eye. On ASOIAF there isn't even a Night's King, there is only a mention of it, and in the show we saw that creepy looking dead guy maybe a couple of times. He never talked, we never got to know him. He is a stranger really. 

And it's not just me who feels this way, of course, this is why many people have been theorizing that either Daenerys or Bran will turn into an ultimate villain in the last book. Because that character is needed, a character who will ally with the Night's king, either become his servant or his queen etc. Some people thought Bran will be the Night's King servant. Some thought Daenerys will go mad and ally with him in the end.

I bet somebody will ally with the Night's King because like I said, the story requires it, the story requires a ""known"" ultimate villain that we got to know in the story and saw his or her beginnings, who will represent the dark side. I don't think Bran or Daenerys will go evil after this point. Bran is the least likely, Daenerys may still be it perhaps but I think she was a red herring, she is under the good influence of Tyrion and all those good people around her now. 

But it can actually be Cersei, the mad queen herself. She can be the ultimate villain. Maybe we were reading and watching her beginnings, starting as a power driven dark character, but having some human aspects as well...at one point she loses everything that makes her human and goes to the dark side, like Saruman. 

Qyburn and the Mountain can really be hints there, because Qyburn is Dr. Frankenstein and The Mountain is a zombie...and now they are both Cersei's servants. Cersei is already involved with a zombie maker and commands a zombie. Why not ending up commanding a zombie army? She and Qyburn can even start secretly creating new zombie soldiers. 

So, maybe Cersei won't really die in season 7 finale, but rise as the Night's Queen. Maybe she will lose to Daenerys and now knowing about the Night's King and white walkers, she will decide to ally with the Night's King. I feel like her appearance should change somehow if she goes to an unhuman state, so she should either look like a zombie or something should happen to her appearance, like burning, scarred or something. 

She can die and come back as a zombie, maybe the valonqar will kill her but she will be resurrected. Or, she won't die but go completely dark, and the valonqar will kill her in the series finale, not in season 7 finale. I think Jaime is the Valonqar, as I said in another thread he will choose Brienne over Cersei, ally with the Starks and in the end he will kill and be killed by the ultimate villain, dying in Brienne's arms...Brienne will be pregnant and give birth to a child who will be raised by a foster father, either Jon or Tyrion and will become a king, queen or a ruler in the future. Jaime is not only Kingslayer but also Kingmaker. He will slay the ultimate evil queen, and still be remembered as Kingslayer but this time in a good way. And he can support Jon as a king, and he will produce another future king/queen/ruler with Brienne (not only he makes people kings but he produces kings himself, both of his sons were crowned as kings). And Jon will slay the Night's King.

I think Cersei is the most likely to be the ultimate villain and she can survive season 7, either dead or alive. If it's not Cersei, the second option is Daenerys, followed by Euron. I don't think it's Bran but he could be the forth option, but I think he won't go evil and warg into one of the dragons instead to fight with the evil. I think one of these people must ally with the Night's King, and my bet is on Cersei.",18,0,False,self,,,,,

There are 3 fire dragons. Fire dragons cannot be controlled, or tamed except by those with valyrian blood. We know 2 riders, Dany and Jon. We need 3rd rider. But we need valyrian blood for dragon riding. Who else has valyrian blood in them? Meera? Possibly if she is Jon's twin. Probably not. Tyrion? Possibly if he is son of MadKing. Probably not. Gendry? Yes. He has. Definitely. Robert's grandmother was Targaryen. So Robert had valyrian blood passed on to Gendry. That would make things interesting. So maybe Gendry is the third dragon rider.

Bran is destined to fly. Not normal warged in a three eyed crow flying (that's not normal BTW). It was clearly a sign that Bran would fly as a dragon. But all the dragons now have their riders. Now there are two possibilities. 1) one of the dragon rider dies, and bran continues the fight as a dragon himself to help win the great war. 2) or, bran stays in winterfell and wargs into an ice dragon and help in the great war.

Ice dragons? His is the song of ice and fire. Dany is fire. Bran is ice. Jon is ice and fire. We have fire dragons. And we know ice dragons do exist. There might be one inside the wall, which might be released when the wall comes down. One might be in the godswood pool, or in the crypts. There is strong indication that a ice dragon is bound to make an appearance.

With Jon commanding the vanguard of humans riding his direwolf against the others, in the sky 3 fire dragons (we need one more rider now lol) with dany in charge and one extremely huge ice dragon, half the size of wall, controlled by bran. And this force clashes with the others near winterfell. This I think is the song. Ice and fire under the command of Jon The Stargaryen Snow.

Any thoughts?",30,3,False,self,,,,,

And theres a scene that always pisses me off , when Sansa starts that whole ""you don't know ramsey bolton"" rant. 

My point is , We all know Ramsey was a cunt, Davos knew it , Tormund knew it , Jon knew it. 

He raped and lived with Sansa ? Yes. 

But heres the thing , Ramsey didn't know Jon either. ""We don't have enough men""  who the fuck are you going to call for help before going to winterfell? The Rohirrims? The only ""available"" option was the man that betrayed Sansa's father. 

Option that she already had chosen. 

Then theres that ""Rickon is ded' anyways"" 

So... What happened with ""A monster has taken OUR home and our BROTHER..."" Get out of here. 

Point number 2 : Everyone talking about Sansa betraying Jon next season because of Littlefinger.

I don't think thats going to happen , if Sansa betrays Jon because of Baelish, then she clearly hasn't learn a thing. She would end up being the same fool that left Winterfell , for obvious reasons.

To start off I think that GRRM's particular story building style is really heavy on thematic elements, I guess you could say. ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" seems to appear in many different aspects of the series. For example, the dualistic religion of R'hllor, the Lord of Light and God of Fire; and the Great Other, God of Darkness, Cold, and Death; obviously contains an element of the 'Song of Ice and Fire.' Jon Snow's parentage is another fine example. As well as parts of Sansa's storyline. I bring these up to illustrate that the theme of 'Ice and Fire' takes many different forms and flavors in the series and I think it has not had its greatest meaning yet.

At this point in the TV series Jon Snow has been proclaimed KINGINDANORTH and Daenarys is finally on her way to Westeros. Considering she is at the helm of the best light line infantry and light cavalry in the Game in the form of the Unsullied and Dothraki Khalasaar, respectively; as well as a healthy amount of support from the Redwyne Fleet from the Reach, the small task force of Ironborn under Asha/Yara and Theon Greyjoy, and Dorne and her Sand Snakes (they count for something), not to mention the fact that she'll be the first person in 150 years to make air superiority a thing; its safe to assume that Daenarys will take Westeros. When she meets Jon Snow, as will inevitably happen, and his parentage is made known there will be a subplot where he faces a dilemma that the Iron Throne is his by right. Him being so alike Ned Stark in regards to duty and honor, and having interacted and witnessed the way Stannis Baratheon operated, I think he will feel compelled to pursue the Iron Throne but not want it. The Jon Vs. Dany Rightful-ruler-bowl will be negotiated into a marriage alliance between Jon Snow, the King in the North, and Daenarys Targaryen, Queen of the Seven Kingdoms*, and then Westeros will be known as the ""Kingdoms of Ice and Fire.""",15,4,False,self,,,,,

(THEORY/DISCUSSION)

Edit- if there are any flaws or points you don't agree with pop in a comment, I'm just giving my opinion and thoughts on one of the greatest TV programmes ever made and I like learning new facts about the show. I'd also like to add that I'm just talking about the TV show here and not the books, I haven't read one of books and I'm speculating on purely the TV show.  

I've been re-watching the game of thrones series lately. I've noticed a couple of things. Sadly back in series 1 when Jon saves the old bear Jeor Mormont from a wight, he burns his hand, so he may be Targaryen but he isn't blood of the dragon like his aunt Danny. The king in the North does however have the blood of the first men in him as well as the Targaryen blood, so it's left me wondering if he is somehow going to be immune to the white walkers touch? We've seen the Nights king leave his mark on Bran and raise the dead, but what's going to happen when he comes face to face with Jon? I've seen some theories that the Nights king was once a Stark bastard named Jon. It's definitely an encounter I'm looking forward to watching but with George R. R. Martin (GRRM) already saying the ending is going to be bitter sweet, I'm starting to think that Jon's going to give his life for the realm. On a side note; I think it'd be nice to see Jon give Jorah Longclaw back (the Mormonts ancestral sword) Jeor had said he'd wanted his son to have that sword and I'd like to think Jorah has more than earned that now. I'd be glad to hear any opinions or expansions on this post, thanks.",25,7,False,self,,,,,

IIRC Robb wanted the North's independence and that was part of the reason for his campaign however he was in it just as much for joffrey's head. And with Eddards death being based on the fact he supported Stannis as the rightful heir wouldn't Robb respect his fathers dying wishes? Stannis is hailed and feared as one of the most experienced and decorated military strategists of his time. Robb was young and inexperienced, but had a lot of support behind him and it seemed very much like their combined forces would've had a better chance. While their goals weren't exactly the same it seems like taking Joffrey off the throne would've been enough to unite the two.

Jaime's [golden hand](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/4f/Jaime's_golden_hand_full_detail.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150208231910) bears a fair resemblance to the hand in the [Hand of the King badge of office](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/3/3a/Hand_of_the_King.jpeg/revision/latest?cb=20110605213513).  

Then in an episode this season, Jaime says to Bronn something like ""You could be the right hand I lost"".  The fake hand he's using now to replace the 'right hand I lost' looks similar to the Hand of the King pin, possibly foreshadowing that whoever *does* fill the symbolic role of that hand would be Hand of the King.

Clearly this isn't much, but I remembered that after killing the Mad King, Jaime [sat on the Iron Throne](https://www.ablogofthrones.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Jaime-On-The-Iron-Throne-1920x1078.jpg).  But when Ned Stark found him, Jaime got off the throne, saying he was merely 'keeping it warm'.

I could never figure out *why* he was sitting on the throne, and IIRC neither the books nor the show have offered any insight into his thinking at the time.  But what if it was symbolic that Jaime was *meant* to be King, but turned it down?  Jaime's life since killing the Mad King has been characterized by *avoidance*.  He didn't want to engage the world, so he remained in a Kingsguard role that required little more than being skilled with a sword.  He wasn't even the commander.  Tywin comments on it in season 1:

&gt; ""The future of our family will be determined in these next few months.
We could establish a dynasty that will last a thousand years.
Or we could collapse into nothing, as the Targaryens did.
I need you to become the man you were always meant to be.
Not next year.
Not tomorrow.
Now.""

Whoever Jaime was born to be, he hasn't become it yet.  His character arc seems to be moving towards Jaime becoming that man: a man who does his duty, rather than avoid it.  With Cersei putting herself on the throne, looking increasingly like a Mad Queen, and Dany's army on its way, there is a good chance of Jaime being the valonqar.  If history comes full circle, with Jaime again killing the ruler in order to save King's Landing, what if thats not all thats meant to repeat?  Perhaps closing the loop means Jaime will save King's Landing and again sit in the Iron Throne, but this time he chooses to become the man he was 'always meant to be'.

Ignoring the specifics of how Jaime could become and stay King (if the White Walkers destroy most of Westeros, practically anybody could take the throne at the end): is there anything else that might foreshadow Jaime becoming King?  Are these merely a few coincidences, or are there other hints tucked away in the books or in the show?

*edit*

u/BlondieTVJunkie brings up a *fantastic* point: Jamie sitting on the Iron Throne *is one of the scenes in Bran's vision*!  All the scenes in his vision have been either major events of the past that we've seen or heard discussed (death of the Mad King, Bran falling from the window, white walkers coming, yadda) or what were or appear to be visions of the future (wildfire exploding, dragon over King's Landing).  Jamie sitting on the Iron Throne is the *only* scene that doesn't fit either of those: its an event from the past that was neither seen nor ever discussed by any of the characters.  Nobody in the show has ever mentioned it happening.

Why bring it up in that vision, unless it foreshadows the future?",33,36,False,self,,,,,

In the next episode she was found and stitched back up by Lady Crane. What if this was NOT Lazy Writing like everyone things it is but Forshadowing and that Arya stark will die in a bed of blood next season mirroring the death of Lyanna. So let's say Arya does get to King's Landing and she decides to go after Cersei. My believe is that she will choose family over vengeance and let someone else have the kill. But is stabbed and unlike last time this one can not be stitched back up. If Jon does go to King's Landing he could find her in a bed of blood and Arya makes Jon promise to never tell Sansa or Bran of the things she has done and then she dies in Jon's arms warging into Nymeria in the process.

Evidence:

-for starters it seems unlikely that the writers of the show would do what they did last season in episode 7 without a good reason like why have her be stabbed that reason could be forshadowing
-Arya is already said to look like Lyanna
-When Lady Crane stitched her back up she was bleeding before hand and what was Lyanna in when Ned found her in the tower of Joy. That's right a bed of blood.
-Where Arya was stabbed was exactly where Lyanna's bleeding came from
- Finally Maisie Williams (the actress who plays Arya) tweeted some interesting stuff after she read the script for next season one of them was that ""nothing will prepare you for this"" she could mean that nothing will prepare for when her character dies. she can not simply say that though due to it being to on the nose.

That is, he can only sleep with her on the first wedding night. If he did that, that means that the lannister twins are actually targaryen. This can be proved by the twins' incest desire and by cercie's complete resemblance to mad king himself(not physical). Burning down city to destroy her enemies using wild fire. Blond may be strong against silver, as black is strong against blond.

Jon Snow thinks to himself that Jaime is ""what a king should look like"", and Bran Stark feels that Jaime looks like ""more like the knights in the stories"".If this is true, then jaime and cercie could become the remaining two heads of the dragon. 

Jon Stargaryen Snow leads the armies of mankind along side his commanders (the likes of Gendry, Bronn, Davos, Melisandre, Yara, Sand Snakes, etc).

Each and every character would unite under his banner and thus the Others would be defeated by his leadership upon all the other Great Houses combined. 

Thus Jon Stargaryen Snow will become The Azor Ahai, and soon after defeating the Others, take the iron throne and rule over all of westeros. As north knows no king but the king in the north, he would be loved by northerners too, as the King of Westeros.

Cersei sits the Iron Throne, mother of the supposed true kings, with no claim of her own.

Ellaria seems to be in charge in Dorne, consort of the brother of the dead legitimate ruler.

The Queen of Thorns seems to be in charge in Highgarden, mother of the rightful lord who only married into the family.

The Frey's (whoever tries to grab power after Walder's death) control the Riverlands, which they got by betraying their rightful lords.

The Iron Islands are ruled by Euron, who killed the rightful ruler and was elected at a Kingsmoot.

It's unclear who's running things in the Westerlands, but the smart money is probably going to be Cersei, rather than Jaime or Tyrion, both of whom have superior claims under the patriarchal Westerosi system.

The Vale comes closest to normal - it's rightful ruler is technically in power! But it is essentially run by his father figure Littlefinger, who only briefly married into the family. Littlefinger's banners were even the ones on the Vale's army in the Battle of the Bastards! And signs point to poor Robin not living any longer than he's useful to Littlefinger.

And the North is ruled by Jon Snow, unlegitimized bastard - despite Sansa and (admittedly unbeknownst to the participants) Bran and Arya's superior claims.

Will the traditional systems of inheritance in Westeros be able to survive this sort of upheaval? Could we expect some kind of enlightened reforms to inheritance law, or even a stepping away from inherited political power altogether, as a result of this disruption?

But in the near future the dead will come, its been hyped up since season 1. Everyone talks about fighting the white walkers but how the fuck will they? Even if they do find dragon glass, and the only place where it was known to be was dragonstone, the white walkers still have crazy huge numbers. Anyone dead north of the wall is of their army, and anyone killed by their army becomes of them. For every man they kill they gain another. With each dead man killing the numbers would continue to multiply. Also, it looks like barely anyone below the neck gives a shit about the white walkers, let alone believes in them. Although the north is huge in size it isn't very rich and populated. And with all the conflict with ramsey, the war of 5 kings etc, the north is now weaker than ever. And another thing is that everyone is banded behind jon, not sansa. And sansa is definitely gonna be up to some sneaky shit with peter. If jons somehow out of the picture, the north will become divided. And that'll fuck shit up even more.

Also Marwyn liked his ideas on the residue of the soul after death. It would appear Qyburn did discover the secret of death since he was able to stop it in Gregor Clegane, while also keeping his residue soul. So death is seen as some vital ingredient. The resurrections of Beric seem to work in a very similar way, but gradually Beric is losing the residue soul as he loses his memories. Benjen also appears this way and why he isnt like a wight who were reanimated without their soul.

Now given there is some vital ingredient to cause death, there is also most likely an lan vital the spark of life which contains consciousness. I think it is inside Melisandre. She doesnt seem to die and she has spoken about the lords light being inside her and also she does not feel the cold. She had a conversation with Jon traveling in the caged death trap to the top of the wall. Also when she resurrected Jon, she didnt use his residue soul because he came back with full consciousness. She gave him elan vital.

So how did Melisandre happen to be carrying elan vital? She is said to be 400 years old which places her birth around the doom of Valyria. It is possible she was an infant slave who escaped the doom. I strongly suspect that the Valyrians used to use the elan vital and the vital death components on their slaves. There is no possible way humans could survive very long mining in volcanoes as they did in Valyria. They had to use both ingredients because zombie workers with no consciousness are only good for killing and not productive work, so they used both to have a workforce which couldnt die and still able to perform the work. This probably left them in terrible pain and agony given what the volcanoes would be doing to their living tissue. It would explain why the faceless men saw killing them as giving the gift of death since they didnt have the vital ingredient to die and end their suffering.

So what does this all mean? azor ahai is probably a method extracting elan vital from the vessel (Melisandre) and combining the ingredients to create immortal conscious things. Now why I say things is because the idea behind elan vital is that with this essential ingredient in theory (yes this was a real theory early 1900s) you could add it to inanimate objects and make them living. So now the exciting part, this is where you can make dragons from stone, specifically the ones at dragonstone. But also direwolves from stone, specifically the ones in Winterfell crypts. Jon being Stark and Targ can command both these creatures. He also has the human statutes who are armed with swords. He has entire army in the crypts and that is why there must always be a stark in Winterfell.

I also think Sansa will be the next vessel to carry elan vital and Arya to carry the vital death, but that is a story for another time.

I've also watched a bunch of the Alt-Shift X breakdowns, and a ton of the lore videos on YouTube.
So obviously I'm a pretty big fan &amp; I have a decent grasp of what is going on in Westeros, but lack some information that I'm sure will come once I finish the entire book series for myself. 

I wanted to give a bit of my ASOIAF background before I give my hypothesis, so I don't come off as one of those ""I just finished watching the series for the first time yesterday, &amp; now I have it all figured out"" type of commenters. 

At this point after everything I have seen, I have serious doubts that Jon is Azor Ahai, or even The Prince That Was Promised. I believe the build up we are seeing w/ his resurrection &amp; coronation, is a red herring. Somewhat similar to what GRRM did w/ Ned in the first season. I think this way b/c we've had two other characters comeback from the dead (Catelyn &amp; Beric Dondarrian) who clearly are not TPTWP or Azor Ahai. 

It seems to me that The Red God likes to bring people back from time to time and that sort of is what it is. I realize Jons' birth did have some correlation w/ the prophesy that Rhaegar was so focused on (The blood red star - the bloody sword Dawn, etc). But Dany has a bunch of things that connect her to the prophecy as well. Not that I am saying I think Dany is TPTWP either. Honestly I'm not sure who is TPTWP, or even if there will be one in the end. 

Its entirely possible that my opinion will change as I get further into the books. But as I see it now, &amp; the more I experience Lady Stone Heart, I just don't see how the *third guy* who came back from the dead is somehow the mystic savior of the story. Seems more like he hit the lottery and just came back w/o all the rot or mental issues of the other two that came back before him. 

In the end I'll probably be proven wrong, but if he is another Ned, I'd love to see how it works out.",58,34,False,self,,,,,

**Quiet guys:** Neither Jon nor Harry wanted to really be a part of it all, as Gnisms noted to me. They are both introverted, out of the limelight characters who were thrust into roles of importance/leadership.

**Gryffindors:** Gnisms also noted that the two are huge Gryffindor types. Brave, headstrong, noble. Gnisms brought up the great example that were Harry in the Battle of the Bastards, he would have done the exact same thing as Jon: rush forward, forgetting everything to try and save Rickon. Jon's nobility comes heavily from the Stark name and the teachings of Ned, whereas Harry mainly acts of his own accord with a bit of help from Dumbledore.


&amp;nbsp;


They both have really, really bookish friends who are much smarter than either of them in Samwell and Hermione


&amp;nbsp;


They are both partial to the odd redhead in Ginny and Ygritte.

&amp;nbsp;


**Horrible childhoods:**They both had rough upbringings with carers who were emotionally abusive. In fairness, Jon didn't have to sleep under the stairs, but Catelyn made him time miserable. Though she wasn't a blood relative, she was supposed to fulfill a mother role, and didn't. Instead she made him feel unloved and an outsider. In the same vein, Petunia (though an actual blood relative), did not embrace the mother role and was incredibly abusive to Harry.

&amp;nbsp;


**Exploration:**Both of their stories include the exploration of a new area/ region (and they both go to live in a castle) where they find their calling. This is slightly different for Harry as he's our window to literally every part of the Wizarding World, but Jon is our only window into Castle Black for much of the series, and the main one above the Wall. Jon didn't identify with the Night's Watch as much as Harry did with Hogwarts, but he did come into his own and rise to become the Lord Commander (you know, before he was betrayed and stabbed by his own men)

&amp;nbsp;


**Viewed as villains:** Both are vilified multiple times by their peers. This is one that does just pop up a lot within a heroes journey. The hero must face resistance by his own people. Foolish people who don't realize what the hero is trying to do etc etc. This happens to Harry multiple times in almost every book, ranging from his decisions as a Quidditch captain to people not believing in Voldemort's return. Jon has to contend with Thorne and other jealous types from the beginning, is then put under scrutiny and suspicion about his role in Qhorin Halfhand's death and his feelings to the Wildlings, all the way upto his decisions as Lord Commander.

&amp;nbsp;


They are both the subject of pretty important prophecies. Well, maybe anyway. They could both be about Neville and Daenerys.

&amp;nbsp;


They both die and then come back to life. Kind of.

&amp;nbsp;


**And the major parallel:**

&amp;nbsp;


Both Jon and Harry have to deal with fame. Harry is the Boy Who Lived, the ultimate hero and savior and everybody's favorite kid. Jon is known as a bastard and a (sort of) Stark, though it wins him no love on the Wall. The parallel comes in these two different fames. Harry is already known and recognized as the hero. Jon may well be Azor Ahai, the Prince That Was Promised, and yet it is known by essentially no one. The two fames also derive heavily from their parents. James and Lily Potter are loved and revered, and naturally many of their friends and peers obviously care for their child. Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark are about as loved and famous as anyone manages to get in Westeros. Their child would have been celebrated and loved (by some anyway. Hey, not everyone likes Harry either), and may well have been recognized as the hero he already is. Here lies the great difference. The recognition of Harry's parentage is exactly what placed Harry in his hero role. Jon has found his hero's role despite the fact that he and the larger world have no idea on who he is. 

&amp;nbsp;


**One last difference:**
The final act of their mothers. Harry's mother, Lily, used her last moment to shield her son and set off the chain of events that make Harry who he is. She guarantees his fame, his unique powers and his place in his many adventures.
Jon's mother, Lyanna Stark, used her final breath to hide Jon away from the world, guaranteeing him his place as something other than he is. Despite Lyanna's attempt, Jon still finds himself on his own adventures and has now certainly risen to fame as King of the North.

&amp;nbsp;


Many thanks to Gnism for putting the idea in my head. Let me know any I've missed and enjoy thinking about foolish things like this as we wait for book and series.

It is public knowledge that Jon is the bastard commander of Night's Watch and son of the traitorous Eddard Stark. Word will soon get out that he deserted the Night's Watch and lead an army of wildlings down south across the wall. People will hear that he took Winterfell with the aid of giants and murdered the Warden of the North, completely wiping out North's historically second most powerful house. Reminds you of anything? Yeah, Tywin Lannister and the Reynes of Castamere. 

On top of this, Robin Arryn's army is likely to spread some weird rumors. Jon Snow is said to be immortal-the wildlings think he's some kind of god. He has a monstrous white direwolf, earning him the alias ""White Wolf"".

What if Game of Thrones were more stylized; I mean, imagine if the show were directed by someone like Quentin Tarantino, or Robert Rodriguez (I'm sure there are more examples I could use, I'm just not familiar with that many directors). 

There's nothing wrong with the style of the show, of course. The realistic, I guess ""conservative"" cinematography, if you will, really does lend itself to the portrayal of this gritty, realistic drama. But wouldn't it just be *cool* to see some ridiculous action scenes with, for example, Jon Snow leaping over piles of bodies and throwing Longclaw directly into the eye socket of some evil guy like Ramsay, all while the camera spins around him Matrix-style?

Anyways, obviously that's just a fantasy.

**And yet** with word of a spin-off series, perhaps centered on the story of Dunk and Egg, wouldn't it be kind of boring if the whole style and feel of such a series were indistinguishable from the main series? I see it, personally, as a great opportunity for the people in charge of the show to let their hair down, so to speak, and throw in some crazy action scenes and highly stylized cinematography.

Varys starts to grill her and she drops that she knows what happened to Varys and he's all sketched out. Then she says to Varys something along the lines of ""If you truly serve our Queen/PTWP/Lord of Light/etc you have nothing to fear from me"". Doesn't this seem super ominous? But we never see or hear from her again after this episode. In the upcoming season(s) do you think this head red lady could try and gain influence with Dany potentially by trying to get rid of Varys? Potentially by painting him as not truly invested in the cause? Could Dany go full Mannis levels lord of light worship? Instead of burning people at the stake they'd burn them with dragonfire? 

And what of Jon ALSO being proclaimed as the PTWP by a red priest? Potentially 2 red priests if the BWB joins up with Jon and Co. which seems likely. If Dany's red priest lady does play a bigger role advising her could this cause some conflict when they eventually do meet?

Correct me if I'm wrong, but from what I've been able to find out, she has over five hundred ships in her navy, which is a mixture of ships from the Iron Fleet, the Slavers, Dorne, and the Tyrells/Redwynes. She also has approximately 100,000 Dothraki, 8,000 Unsullied, and several thousand Iron Born. Her allies in Westeros can provide the full strength Dorne and Highgarden: 10,000 Dornishmen and around 100,000 Tyrell bannermen.

We know that Euron Greyjoy is working on building a thousand ships and is planning on sailing them to Meereen to offer them to Daenerys along with a marriage proposal. 

My first question is whether or not Euron Greyjoy will have finished his thousand ships and set sail for Meereen before Daenerys gets close to Westeros. Obviously her dragons would be a total game changer in that potential naval battle, but how damaged would Daenerys' military strength be following that battle?

Secondly, in ADWD, Victarion Greyjoy sets sail from Westeros with 93 ships and arrives with 45 ships due to storms and whatnot. Since Daenerys is making the same journey only going the other way, should we expect that she lose a good number of ships, and therefore fighting men, along the way? It doesn't help that the bulk of her fighting men are Dothraki who were previously afraid of the ocean and have zero sailing experience.",11,1,False,self,,,,,

I love the Game of Thrones series and it is up there for me among things like The Riftwar Cycle and The Ranger's Apprentice.

That being said I don't mind rereading an **e**ntire series but due to certain events in the future I will be short on time for the next 6 years. 

I should also mention I had one encounter with the GoT show when it first premiered on TV as a sneak peek (think it was a sneak peek). This was actually before I read the books I should mention.

Anyways I remember the first episode made no sense back then and I didn't like the camera angles. 

It wasn't until years later I discovered GoT on Goodr**e**ads and realized that same show was the book I now loved. I saw my brother watch a little bit of it and the characters didn't look anything like what I expected / there were some differences in the characters such as hair color (I think) and that made me shun it.

(DISCUSSION)

Since the dawn of thrones Jamie Lannister is a character that I've been hoping will redeem himself. As the series is coming to an end, I'm loosing faith.
He is introduced as a cocky character that believes he is one of the greatest swordsman of his time, for a short period, I was fooled into believing this too. We have only seen him in single combat twice, both fights got interrupted; his first was a short duel with Ned Stark in Kings landing, as I'm sure all fans will agree I am still to this day gutted that we didn't see the end of the fight (Ned is skewered in the leg by a Lannister guard). Although this is speculation, I strongly believe that Ned would have cut him down by the end of the fight. Ned was considered one of the greatest warriors of Westeros with a lot of proof to back that up. Sadly we'll now never know the outcome. The second single combat Jamie had was with Brienne of Tarth, when he was her prisoner in series 3. Now I know Jamie has been a prisoner for a year here, he's malnourished, fatigued and hasn't held a sword since series 1, but he puts up a terrible performance which leads to Brienne effortlessly knocking his sword away and repeatedly knocking him down. This fight then gets interrupted by the Bolton bannerman. Arthur Dane, Barriston Celmey, Robert Baratheon are a few of the greatest warriors of there time, i dont think Jamie can be inckuded in this list. He was also dehorsed by Loris Tyrell at king Roberts nameday torny. A few significant things have happened in Jamie's storyline that I have been wishing would turn him into the man of honour I've always thought he could be; a Stark prisoner, the loss of his hand, the death of his daughter, but every time I see a bit of light at the end of the tunnel he goes back to his old Lannister ways. Maybe seeing the love of his life blow up half of the city he loves will drive him to be the character I've always wanted him to be. Throughout the series we have seen Jamie strive to achieve greatness, a deed that will have him remembered as the warrior he truly thinks he is, however as the series is coming to an end, I think he's going to be remembered as a washed up kings guard known only for murdering his king.. and possibly his queen. I personally would like to see a fight to the death between Jamie and Brienne, Jamie using Widows Wail and Brienne using Oathkeeper, the two swords that were forged from a melted down Ice (the Stark ancestral sword).

R. Martins world by no means perfect, and almost every major character have dealt with extreme hardships throughout their lives. This brings me to ask, which character, in your opinion, is the most tragic. some of the most obivious would be:

Tyrion: with a lifetime of being mocked and hated, falls in love with whores, the only women who are able to ignore his deformities. sentenced to death by his own family, and rejected by the woman he thought loved him. his deformities is the only thing he is known for. All his achievements are ignored, and most people only view him as either a power hungry, whoring, alcoholic, disgrace, or an extremely ugly dwarf.

Jaime: joined the kingsguad as the youngest ever, only to discover the only reason he was chosen was to spite his father. is known universally as the kingslayer, and a man without honor, even though killing Aerys saved kings landing.

Ned: raised as a second son, never expecting leadership. became best friends with Robert, and lived a happy life. suddenly his sister is kidnapped, his brother and father murdered by the rightful king, who also demands the heads of Ned and Robert. with no choice but to lead before he is twenty years old, and rebel. finally finds his sister when the war is done, only for her to die and leave him with the choice between keeping his sisters son safe, or remaining true to his best friend and new king.

Jon: forced to chose between love and duty time and time again, always choosing duty. Robb or nights watch, ygritte or nights watch, Warden of the north or nights watch. never has time to rest, and is raised to positions of leadership he doesnt want. does what he thinks is right and is murdered for it, and is brought back to a new fight, a new war, and constantly greater responsibility. he knows that he is fighting the most important war in the world, and  is, in some ways, responsible for the fate of the world at large.

I love Varys, he is my favorite character, and I am convinced he is the smartest character in the story pulling most of the strings behind major events, and he has some devilish secrets, including (probably) his own secret backstory.   
Of course, one of the prevailing theories is that he is a secret Targaryen, and that gives him King's blood yadda yadda.  
There was also a popular (although not very serious) theory about Varys being a merling, who apparently are featured somewhat regularly in the books and are tied into all kinds of weird lore.    Well, for a while I have thought maybe he belonged to a different Valyrian family who survived through a narrow lineage somehow...    
Well today I was reading about Maegor the Cruel and that led to me reading about house Velaryon, one of the vassal houses of the Targaryens from the days of Aegon's conquest, and also the maiden name of Aegon the Conqueror's  mother (and his two badass sisters).  
The Velaryons were also from Valyria (no shit!) and had the same physical features (silver hair, purple eyes), and they usually held the title Master of Ships under the Targaryen kings. They also have a Seahorse for their family sigil and they are rumored to have connections to ancient Merlings (they made a pact with the Merling King in ancient history in order to control their home island of Driftmark or something (which is right next to Dragonstone.)   
Ok, so who cares, what is the significance?   
Well, I don't know exactly (of course), but this seems like it might link the two predominant Varys theories out there - the secret Targaryen theory (with secret ambitions of re-creating the Valyrian Freehold) and the secret Merling King out to destroy humanity (or whatever.)   
As a Shownly watcher I (of course) have no textual evidence for this theory. And the Velaryon family is never (to my recollection) mentioned n the TV series, so this doesn't seem likely to be the big reveal at the end of the series or anything, but what do you think? Any credence there? Maybe just a little skynyrd there? Anything? Bueller? ...

The same musical theme plays over both scenes and both scenes reflect the same decision on the part of Ned. 

Just before his execution, Ned decides to confess to treason in an attempt to protect Sansa and Arya (Remember, this is the argument that Varys used on him in the Black Cells.  If he didn't want to lie to protect his own life, then maybe he would lie to protect the lives of his daughters).  The Tower of Joy of course is the scene where Ned decides to protect Jon as his sister asked him to, leading him of course to lie about his sins and claim that he was unfaithful to his wife.  

Both scenes involve Ned making the decision to sacrifice his public reputation and the public view of his honor in order to protect his family.

After finishing season 6 and giving it a lot of thought, I think it is logical to think that Dany is the villain. 

She is bringing firebreathing dragons, plundering pirates and sellswords, a giant and crazed tribe of pillagers and murderers, and an entire army of unsullied troops to Westeros. She also seems to think that she is going to be a proper and just ruler.

First off, she is going to kill hundreds of thousands of innocents. Like wtf do you think is going to happen? The entire bloodthirsty horde is just going to stop and distinguish between an innocent child or a soldier. No they are going to run in, rape, murder, and destroy EVERYTHING. Those dragons aren't going to do their due diligence and check who is an enemy and who is an innocent civilian. Fuck no. They are going to breath fire of thousands of troopers AND innocents. She is bringing a frenzied horde to Westeros, which is going to cause an unruly amount of chaos.

This contradicts her belief that she will be a good ruler. Yeah, it is going to be very fucking difficult to have people follow you after your horde has raped their mothers and sisters or them, murdered their friends, and after they have been robbed blind by the people who would be patrolling the streets by then. Not going to happen. Furthermore, she has shown NO concern about this fact whatsoever. She is short sighted and acts on instinct like a feral beast. ""THEY KILLED MY FATHER (I MEAN EVEN IF HE WAS A MADMAN WHO WANTED TO BURN ALL OF THEM ALIVE), SO I AM GOING TO BRING A CRAZY HORDE OVER AND KILL TONS OF PEOPLE, I DON'T CARE WHO THEY ARE. I JUST WANT TO BE THE QUEEN. Yeah have fun being the queen of a fucking destroyed continent in which most of its citizens are then going to be living in worse conditions than before and have suffered through your aggressive war-like attitude, you crazy bitch.

Furthermore, she doesn't seem to want to be the queen in order to help people, she just wants to be a queen. She couldn't handle ruling the people in mereen, and now this bitch thinks she can take on ruling westeros? Hell no.

Even Doran said ""nothing good comes of war"". GRRM himself is against war and strongly believes nothing good will ever come of it.

I really hope Jon doesn't become allies with her. I hope he kills her.

The bathhouse scene with Brienne. His retelling the story of the Mad-King's last moments was powerful.

The rest of the children will be quite decent people. 

We only have three generations to go on. Tywin, Cercei and Joffrey. Everyone else has seemed alright except where they have been tainted by an evil family member. 

Kevan - a decent man. Lives in the shadow of Tywin but tries his best to maintain the family honour. 

Jaime - Cercei has used his love to manipulate him his whole life. He's committed great acts of valor and villianry. Almost all of his villainous acts have been with or for Cercei. 

Tyrion - the only of Tywin's children strong enough not to be corrupted by the curse. 

Myrcella - a sweet girl. Intelligent and strong-willed. She was taken away from her family at a youngish age and escaped the curse. 

Tommen - weak willed but innocent and kind. No malice in him but easily manipulated by Cercei.

Im going to attempt to do something that has been tried again and again - A Game of Thrones Minecraft Server.  However, I intend for this one to be unique, something youve never seen.  I plan to create an environment to fully immerse the player into the Game of Thrones world.  Every player will have the ability to influence the flow and direction of the story.  This server will only take key locations and backbone plot i.e. there is a king, 7 great houses and so on.  
-	

I aim to recreate all of Westeros and key locations within it in medium detail to provide an enjoyable gameplay experience for fans of the show.  Of course, those who do not watch the show will always be welcome - the politics and all shouldnt be too difficult to get used to.  I will select a group of top notch builders to help me create this world.  I have managed to create a rough outline of Westeros in WorldPainter, but well really nail the finer details in game.  
-	

Ive kinda got a general idea about how I want everything to look and functioned, but its hard to explain quickly here.  Im writing everything out into a Google Doc and intend to release /update it in chunks as I figure out more details.  Ill post updates periodically on Reddit and also my [Weebly](http://customserver.weebly.com/) website, which Ill go more into in the next paragraph.  
-	
      
Im posting regular updates on the status of the server/World on a little [Weebly](http://customserver.weebly.com/) website I made.  I want to have the server open the the public in around a month, but I realise thats wishful thinking.  Realistically, Ill estimate about 2 months.  It all depends on the size and speed of our build team(s).  Im posting this here to let people know about the server, I hope to get some people excited about it so we can gain a bit of a following.  The more people that are interested, the faster itll happen, and the more fun itll be to play.    
-

TL;DR - Making a fairly detailed Game of Thrones Minecraft server.  Itll be more fun and be ready sooner if we can get word out about this and gain a big following.

OK, that seems like a question that is obvious to answer but as a newbie who has only watched the TV show to season 6 (so no book spoilers please!) I was wondering if there was a theme or narrative beyond it being a place where [S6 Spoiler](#s ""Arya learns the skills to kill people."")

For example, [I read this piece that suggests](http://fandom.wikia.com/articles/myth-pop-culture-faceless-men-iron-will) Jaqen H'ghar wants Arya to have an internalized identity and a moral compass. It seemed like it made sense when I read it, but then I remembered that in the show, [S6 Spoiler](#s ""Jaqen H'ghar showed disappointment when Arya didn't follow through on her kill of the actress. He also appointed the other girl to kill Arya. The article suggests that the other girl was the failure because she just lusted for killing, whereas Arya was the success because she had a moral compass."")

I don't see this reflected in the show - am I missing something?

Did Jaqen H'ghar want Arya to be a detached assassin like the other girl (in which case she failed) or did he want her to have a sense of morals (as suggested in the article), in which case she passed?

Thanks in advance!

A lot of different people were blamed for this attempted murder in the story itself, and a lot of the fans were confused as to who to point the finger at, as well. I'm currently re-reading the series, and having just arrived at the Purple Wedding again, I'm reminded of Tyrion's exchange with Joffrey:

&gt; Have a care, Your Grace, Ser Addam Marbrand warned the king. Valyrian steel is perilously sharp.

&gt; I remember. Joffrey brought Widows Wail down in a savage twohanded slice, onto the book that Tyrion had given him. The heavy leather cover parted at a stroke. **Sharp! I told you, I am no stranger to Valyrian steel.** It took him half a dozen further cuts to hack the thick tome apart, and the boy was breathless by the time he was done.

Joffrey proclaims that he is familiar with Valyrian steel, which is odd, considering this is the first time he has owned a Valyrian blade. His previous sword wasn't Valyrian steel. Of course, growing up in King's Landing as the son of the King would make it likely for him to have seen Valyrian blades before, maybe even held one at some point, or toyed with one when his father wasn't watching. Nevertheless, this festers in Tyrion's mind.

&gt; Your Grace, Ser Garlan Tyrell said. Perhaps you did not know. In all of Westeros there were but four copies of that book illuminated in Kaeths own hand.

&gt; Now there are three. Joffrey undid his old swordbelt to don his new one. You and Lady Sansa owe me a better present, Uncle Imp. This one is all chopped to pieces.

&gt; Tyrion was staring at his nephew with his mismatched eyes. **Perhaps a knife, sire. To match your sword. A dagger of the same fine Valyrian steel... with a dragonbone hilt, say?**

&gt; Joff gave him a sharp look. You... yes, a dagger to match my sword, good. He nodded. A... a gold hilt with rubies in it. Dragonbone is too plain.

Tyrion is taunting Joffrey. The dagger used by the assassin who tried to kill Bran was a Valyrian steel dagger with a dragonbone hilt. Tyrion only recently put two and two together, as he has been pondering who could have sent the assassin ever since Catelyn falsely accused him of doing it. Later in the day, he reflects:

&gt; Tyrion shifted his weight uncomfortably from one foot to the other. He could not stand still. Too much wine. He should have thought to relieve himself before they set out from the Red Keep. The sleepless night hed spent with Shae was making itself felt too, but most of all he wanted to strangle his bloody royal nephew.

&gt; **I am no stranger to Valyrian steel, the boy had boasted.** The septons were always going on about how the Father Above judges us all. *If the Father would be so good as to topple over and crush Joff like a dung beetle, I might even believe it.*

&gt; He ought to have seen it long ago. Jaime would never send another man to do his killing, and Cersei was too cunning to use a knife that could be traced back to her, but Joff, arrogant vicious stupid little wretch that he was...

&gt; He remembered a cold morning when hed climbed down the steep exterior steps from Winterfells library to find Prince Joffrey jesting with the Hound about killing wolves. *Send a dog to kill a wolf, he said.* Even Joffrey was not so foolish as to command Sandor Clegane to slay a son of Eddard Stark, however; the Hound would have gone to Cersei. Instead the boy found his catspaw among the unsavory lot of freeriders, merchants, and camp followers whod attached themselves to the kings party as they made their way north. Some poxy lackwit willing to risk his life for a princes favor and a little coin. Tyrion wondered whose idea it had been to wait until Robert left Winterfell before opening Brans throat. *Joffs, most like. No doubt he thought it was the height of cunning.*

&gt; The princes own dagger had a jeweled pommel and inlaid goldwork on the blade, Tyrion seemed to recall. *At least Joff had not been stupid enough to use that.* Instead he went poking among his fathers weapons. Robert Baratheon was a man of careless generosity, and would have given his son any dagger he wanted... but Tyrion guessed that the boy had just taken it. Robert had come to Winterfell with a long tail of knights and retainers, a huge wheelhouse, and a baggage train. No doubt some diligent servant had made certain that the kings weapons went with him, in case he should desire any of them.

&gt; The blade Joff chose was nice and plain. No goldwork, no jewels in the hilt, no silver inlay on the blade. King Robert never wore it, had likely forgotten he owned it. Yet the Valyrian steel was deadly sharp... sharp enough to slice through skin, flesh, and muscle in one quick stroke. *I am no stranger to Valyrian steel. But he had been, hadnt he? Else he would never have been so foolish as to pick Littlefingers knife.*

&gt; The why of it still eluded him. *Simple cruelty, perhaps?* His nephew had that in abundance. It was all Tyrion could do not to retch up all the wine hed drunk, piss in his breeches, or both. He squirmed uncomfortably. He ought to have held his tongue at breakfast. *The boy knows I know now. My big mouth will be the death of me, I swear it.*",15,14,False,self,,,,,

Just in case:

[POSSIBLE SPOILERS]


A coworker and I were discussing the possible return of Gendry to the show, and came up with a theory of how it might work. It seems to me that Martins books definitely feature a lot of patterned/cyclical storytelling, so my thought is: Gendry is the last (real) Baratheon left. Maybe he'll end up taking over House Baratheon, and allying with Jon Snow, the way Ned and Robert did to fight the Targaryens the way they did during Roberts Rebellion.

Gendry comes back and Jon, recognizing the symbolic power (most of the actual Baratheon military might is gone) of an alliance with a House outside of the North, as well as one that his father was allied with, legitimizes him as Gendry Baratheon. Jon promises Gendry his father's throne (Jon definitely seems like hed have no interest in the Iron Throne) in exchange for his support in the war and recognition of the North as an independent kingdom. Then we have two bastards taking over their fathers resurgent noble houses to possibly fight Danaerys and the resurgent House Targaryen.

The only part Im having trouble with is why he ends up in the North. Gendry met Ned, and Jon is famous as Neds bastard, the Bastard of Winterfell. Maybe he knows Jon is Neds bastard so he goes there knowing Jon may be both honorable and sympathetic. After learning about what happened to Shireen, Jon would have every reason to believe that Stannis would be perfectly willing to sacrifice Gendry. Plus, Davos helped Gendry, and can confirm everything, including that he is a Baratheon by blood.

Apologies if this theory has been presented elsewhere, but I havent seen anything like it. If it has, Im sure my version here is only half formed sothoughts?",20,10,False,self,,,,,

What if this happens between kinvara, dany (and tyrion), and Jaime with bronn being the sell sword. They brought in kinvara last season and didn't really do much after scaring varys a bit. I think this could have been foreshadowing. The one problem is kinvara believing dany is azor.

If you think this is stupid... It probably is. I am just past the riddle part in book two and very recently started watching the series.

**CERSEI'S KINSLAYING:** First of all, I want to get it off my chest that this is most likely my favorite sequence from any TV show or movie ever.  Everything from the soundtrack music to the very last disintegration.  But I can't get over how this whole debacle will absolutely shred Jaime's mentality to pieces moving forward.  I can't help but imagine Jaime will be so conflictingly torn apart.  There is no way I can see him ever trusting Cersei again.  No matter how much he loves her, there is just no way he can trust her.  Especially if he plans to no longer travel with her, down her amazingly evil takeover.  I know it's not quite the same, but Lancel used to be her lover, look at him now.  


**CERSEI WINS THE GAME:** I'm absolutely on bored with the theory that Jaime is absolutely going to try and kill Cersei, once they have the confrontation about how he disagrees with her recent...decisions.  But I can't be the only one that has this sort of secret hope; I hope Cersei kills Jaime.  And also, I think it would be he most realistic (in the fashion that GoT is known for) way to end the show is Cersei eventually defeating all of her enemies, including the WW.  I think it would be a very memorable way to end the GoT story of Ice and Fire.  In my opinion, this ending has the power to literally cause riots in real life.  People would hate it at first, but once the dust settled the majority of the people would finally realize how fucking perfect that ending actually would be.  GoT's main theme, in my own opinion, is that everybody dies, and when it comes to societies that are built around power and strength, without fail, will always end up being shitty as hell. 

I know a bunch of y'all more than likely disagree with wanting Cersei to win the game, which is cool.  It's more of a ""*a small part of me want it to happen*"" type of thing for me, but if you do disagree, why do you want the character you want?  Like, I mean, really, whyyy?? 
*I want Jon Snow to win because he's sexy and deserves it* isn't a fun response to this.  But I've explained why I want what I want, I'd really love to hear *why* you want whomever you want to do whatever you want.

Mein Name ist Carolyne Larrington. Ich bin Autorin von Winter is Coming, einem Buch zu den literarischen und kulturellen Hintergrnden von Game of Thrones. Das Buch ist gerade im Theiss Verlag erschienen und bezieht sich sowohl auf die Bcher als auch auf die Serie. Ich lehre Englische Literatur des Mittelalters als Fellow am St Johns College in Oxford. Zu meinen weiteren Verffentlichungen zhlen King Arthurs Enchantresses und Land of the Green Man. Als bekennender Game of ThronesFan und habe die Hintergrnde von Game of Thrones erforscht. Ihr knnt mich zum Beispiel fragen, welche historischen Vorbilder es fr bestimmte Figuren gibt, welche Rolle Wlfe in der mittelalterlichen Literatur spielen oder ob es so einflussreiche Frauen wie Cersei im Mittelalter gab.

Please ask me in English! I will answer in English, though I understand German quite well.

 Hello everyone, this is about my book Winter is Coming which has just been published in German translation - hence the above. I've published some other books too: King Arthur's Enchantresses and the Land of the Green Man (2006) and (2015) and I'm also an expert on Old Norse Icelandic. Ask away!

A theory is often put about that Aerys was unfaithful to his Sister/wife Rhaella, and that he maybe even fathered Tyrion (or even Jaime/Cersei).  But why is it Aerys whos considered to be unfaithful? Why is it the Lannister children's parentage thats called into question? Why isn't it Daenerys and Viserys who's parentage may be false.

It's well documented that Rhaella and Aerys bore no real love for eachother, it was a marriage of politics. Aerys' descent into madness obviously didn't help matters, and I would say his continually violent rapes didn't endure him to her either. 

It's also documented that Aerys, already constantly paranoid, became convinced that Rhaella wasn't being faithful. Are we so sure that she wasn't? She didn't love Aerys, she could have easily found someone else who desired her at court (who wouldn't want to sleep with a Queen?). The thing that really drives this for me is the constant stillbirths and miscarriages the couple suffered.

I believe there were seven babies lost in total. Seven in a row. Then all of the sudden the tables turn and Rhaella gives birth to three healthy babies in a row (Viserys, Daenerys, and one who died in infancy). Is that not suspicious? Would it not make sense that another fathered the last three?

The evidence against this? Basically, everything Daenerys has gotten upto. Firstly, she looks like a Targ, she's got the dragons of a targ and apprently the personality of one too. So where would this have all come from?

Umm...her mother? Rhaella was as much a Targaryen as Aerys. Another man would make her only half a Targaryen, but a certain Bastard is only half too, and people seem pretty excited about his opportunities. Or maybe the other father was a Targaryen too (I'm sure there's a candidate somewhere.)

I'm just not so convinced that it was Aerys was the one who slept around (however hard he might have tried), or at very least I'm not convinced Rhaella wasn't out doing the exact same thing.",11,3,False,self,,,,,

  Let's go back to before the rebellion. At the Tourney at Harrenhall, Rheagar chose Lyanna and everyone saw that and freaked out a bit, but Benjen knew his sister had an infatuation with the prince. Rhaegar comes in the dead of night with some guards to steal Lyanna away from her home, and Benjen, not wanting to get in the way of his sisters happiness, looks the other way or even helps her go. This inadvertently causes the death of his eldest brother and father and kickstarts the rebellion, killing thousands and increasing his guilt exponentially.
  Now let's fast forward to when Ned returned from the Rebellion with this baby boy while Ben was still at Winterfell. Benjen knew his brother was too honorable to father a bastard, so when he and his brother were alone, he asked what was really going on with the baby. Ned relents and tells him the truth because he deserves to know, Lyanna was his sister too after all. Burdened by the guilt of this huge secret coupled with the death of his sister, brother and father, which was partially his fault for helping her escape, Benjen takes the Black. 
  After awhile, Benjen cannot take this burden alone anymore and tells someone, Maester Aemon. Let's assume Aemon knew Rhaegar had a child due to the fact that the two were always in correspondence. Aemon accepts this secret and even goes so far as to suggest that Benjen mentors the boy, trying to convince him to join the Watch, because no matter what his parentage, if a mans blood runs black, he is safe. Benjen does this, Jon joins the Watch, and all the while, Aemon is behind the scenes, helping and protecting one of the few remaining members of his bloodline wherever he can.

TL;DR- Benjen helped Lyanna escape with Rhaegar and knows about Jon, joins the watch due to guilt, tells Maester Aemon, Aemon helps the boy wherever he can to protect one of the last Targs.

I am putting on my heaviest tinfoil hat for this but here is a quick theory for how this ending will be:

The White Walkers end up taking over the entirety of Westoros.  It will become the Land of Always Winter forever.  That may sound just bitter but what if a couple of key players, a Dragon or two and a small army sail for the west of Westoros?  What if they come upon another continent and we get a hybrid recreation of the coming of the First Men and the Targaryen takeover of Westoros?  

If they were to lose Westoros to the WW's but managed to escape and find a new home it would be bitter sweet.  It would also kind of mimic actual history in the way that the European settlers came to North America and decimated Native populations.  

It would parallel how the First Men came and basically destroyed the CotF and their way of life.  I am assuming that a couple of dragons will survive and be on the voyage to whatever is west of Westoros and this would be like the Targaryen invasion of Westoros.  It would also mimic the destruction of Valyria which forced the Targaryens to head to Westoros.  

GRRM likes to show how history repeats itself and with so little being known about what is West of Westoros and Arya wondering aloud what that might be I am thinking that this is a possibility.

Just a thought, obviously they are the most important house in the north and also incredibly important to the Night's Watch. So I'm thinking it's feasible that a Stark would have been north of the wall and captured by the children of the forest. I'm not sure what the Starks relationships was with the children of the forest, or their general sentiment towards them (do they even believe they are real? Or are they thought of as second class people like wildlings?), but assuming there was some tension there I'm thinking the children of the forest could have planned this thing out...

In the show, before Bran was pushed by Jamie and became crippled, he was really athletic and I remember when I first saw him as a young boy jumping around Winterfell like that, I thought he might end up being this cool assassin type character.



What we ended up with is much better, where his condition had made his story incredibly interesting and shows how he developed his warging powers. Plus the entire rift it caused between the Lannisters and Starks has driven the story.


Now that Bran is getting pretty powerful, do you think it's possible Melisandre can heal as well as bring people back from the dead? Kind of similar as Ayra, when she lost her sight and became stronger in her training as a result.


I know this next bit isn't going to go down as well as I appreciate not everyone is a fan of the ""Bran is the Lord of light"" theory, but it would also make sense why future bran would send someone like Melisandre to play out every part in her story that she has so far, influenced by her ""visions"".

At this point the only two people who know the truth are Howland Reed and Bran.

Seeing how we haven't seen Howland Reed in present time, it's a safe assumption that Bran is somehow going to have to meet up with Jon at some point next season. The question is, how is that going to work if Bran is north of the Wall? It's not outlandish to think he's going to make his way back to Winterfell, and I think I know how it's going to happen.

In A Dance With Dragons, Rickon Stark is still alive, and so is Stannis Baratheon. Davos is still Stannis' hand, and is currently corralling the smaller northern houses to join Stannis' army in the upcoming battle for Winterfell (much like he did with Jon and Sansa all sixth season). The last time we see Davos, he's mentally preparing to retrieve Rickon Stark from Skagos (not a pleasant place) on behalf of the Manderly's. There's quite a bit of backstory to that one, but all the information we need to translate this into the show is that Davos is about to go on a journey to bring Rickon Stark to safe hands.

It would be kind of hard to do this in the show, since Rickon is dead, but there might be another Stark that Davos can bring home. My theory is that Jon and Sansa send Davos north of The Wall to find Bran and bring him home.

It makes sense in terms of giving Davos a similar task to what he had in the books, and you know Sansa and Jon are going to be wondering about Bran. In case you guys have forgotten, ***both*** Jon and Sansa know Bran could be alive. Theon told Sansa during their Ramsay glory days, and Samwell told Jon after he met Bran in a watchtower. It's a sensible way to get Bran south, and it gives Davos something to do that is relatable to his ASOIAF storyline. Hell, maybe Tormund can even tag along for directions and amazing conversation.

What do you guys think about this? Besides any warging shenanigans, I don't really see Bran getting to Winterfell on his own, or even with Meera Reed. This seems like something Dan &amp; Dave would do to create a new story based off one that's going to happen in ASOIAF.",15,8,False,self,,,,,

I'm basing this off of how I felt during the first time of watching these episodes.

1. The Winds of Winter - Don't feel like this requires much explanation. The R+L=J reveal scene made me cry and the Green Trial was something very special (not sure if that's the best way to describe it) and must have made my jaw sink 50 feet into the earth. The final scene with Daenerys was something the show has been building up to for 5 years and 'King in the North' was great.

2. Battle of the Bastards - Again this justifies itself. Very hard to choose between this and TWOW but I had to pick one. The battle sequence was incredible. The best I've ever seen on the big screen or small screen. The fact my favourite character (Jon) was right at the centre made this even better for me. Also the scenes in Mereen with the conquering of the slavers and the Dragons all flying together was sweet and unexpected.

3. Home - This episode didn't only have the resurrection of Jon, (which we all knew was coming) it also had many other scenes that you would not expect to see in episode 2 such as Ramsay's power grab and Euron's introduction.

4. Hardhome  - ...

5. The Door - #Hold the Door!

6. Oathbreaker - The Tower of Joy fight scene was perfect. Seeing Arthur Dayne take on all those skilled swordsmen and win satisfied me a lot. Seeing this scene from the books brought to screen was amazing. Also the execution of the traitors and Jon dropping the mic like a boss earned this episode a probably unusually high place among other peoples top 10 lists.

7. The Laws of Gods and Men - ""I demand a trial by combat."" I went crazy when I watched this scene unfold for the first time.

8. The Mountain and the Viper - :( Poor Oberyn

9. Winter is Coming - This one may surprise some people but watching this episode just completely took me. The way it introduced everything and gave a really cold feel to this series made me incredibly excited for the rest of the series. The episode was absolutely perfect as a premiere and by the end of it I was already in love with the characters and just wanted more.

10. The Rains of Castamere - This broke the internet and shattered what felt like the entire world. It had an even worse effect on me :( I sat still for 5 minutes with my mouth wide open before I finally 'came to' and started crying. It doesn't feel as bad now because Robb really was a damn fool and Catelyn was a bitch for treating Jon the way she did. But still, Talisa and baby Eddard. :.(",4,2,False,self,,,,,

The first time I watched [Jon and Ygritte's final scene together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU7qePain64) I thought her motives for shooting Jon were pretty straightforward. She wanted Jon to stay with her, felt betrayed that he would choose the Night's Watch over her, and wanted to hurt him. But she couldn't bring herself to actually kill him. I still think that was her primary motivation in the scene, but now I'm wondering if there was a secondary motive: To make his story more credible when he returned to Castle Black.

If Jon had come back to Castle Black in perfect health his entire story would likely have been met with much more skepticism. I mean, he killed Qhorin Halfhand, joined the Wildlings, slept with a Wildling woman, scaled the wall, only to escape them when they tried to kill a defenseless villager, all without a scratch? And it was all part of a ruse? Perhaps they would have regarded him as a traitor who was sent to spy on them for Mance. Or maybe he had just been deserting this whole time and was making up a story to cover it up? If they hadn't believed him he would have been executed. Did Ygritte understand all this and want to protect him from that potential fate? Three arrows through his back would definitely lend credence to his story of running from the Wildlings.

The truly smart people are on both sides of the spectrum, like Varys and Tyrion being good, and Tywin and Littlefinger being bad.

It's the link between undead and dragons that I'm particularly interested in - wights and dragons - ice and fire.

In short, I believe the Shadowbinders of Asshai (Mel, Kinvara/Benerro, Quaithe et. al.), and particularly Quaithe, are the main 'villains' of ASoIaF/GoT. They have one goal, immortality - and judging by Mel's age (and quite possibly Quaithe's and Kinvara's), they're doing a pretty good job of it so far. How they do this is where it gets tinfoil-y, although I'm thinking the rituals and magic involved require death and destruction as a catalyst - kind of an 'absorbing the life force from people and the environment' thing - only death may pay for life. 

Their main tools of destruction are dragons. It's worth noting the fact that it's quite strongly hinted that Mel's (Quaithe's, Kinvara's) black-and-smoking blood is in fact dragon's blood, as well as the blood of the those who have been resurrected - Beric Dondarrion, for example, and unfortunately - Jon. And let's not forget the black-and-smoking shadow demon sent to assassinate Renly. I'm more inclined to believe that this dark substance is what came first, and dragons are merely some kind of manifestation of it, with the Shadowbinders being responsible.

So the dragons, under the control of Shadowbinders, brought complete and utter annihilation to the area now known as the Shadowlands, leaving it a blackened, desolate wasteland (hinted at as being covered in ash). Not to mention Old Valyria, which has been left in a similar state. The eruptions of the Doom of Valyria were instigated by the Shadowbinders, which was the price paid for continued eternal life. It's interesting how it happened about 414 years before the current events in GoT, as Carice van Houten mentioned that her character is around 400 years old (which is consistent with 'several centuries old', as opposed to 'a couple of centuries' or 'over a century' - she's too old to be Shiera Seastar).

Westeros is next on the list. Dany's dragon eggs have supposedly come from Asshai. She's being manipulated by Quaithe, sending her visions via the Glass Candles. I predict Quaithe will direct Dany to head to Oldtown first - and destroy the organization that has been trying for centuries (and recently, succeeded) to destroy dragons and eliminate magic from the world - replacing it with knowledge and reason, and in the process reinstating the mortality of the Shadowbinders.

As for the White Walker side of things - I've always wondered where the Children of the Forest got their dragonglass (with the ability to create ice demons who in turn can raise the dead) from - with Planetos being a spheroid, perhaps Asshai is actually quite close to the west coast of Westeros, or at least much closer than going east. They somehow appealed to the Shadowbinders for some kind of method to destroy their enemy in large numbers - the Shadowbinders then saw this as an opportunity to expand their area of operations.

When the Night King touches Craster's babies, they are transformed into Walkers - perhaps after being marked by the Night King, Bran's body is slowly transforming, spreading from the mark on his arm. I predict he will control the Walkers, and use them in an attempt to destroy the dragons and fire/shadow magic. He will learn the truth of things from his visions - as it turns out, these visions were sent out via Glass Candle from the Citadel (presuming of course that the Maesters have some kind of knowledge and/or record of Westerosi history, Walker creation, and Jon's true parentage). They will destroy each other and finally Westeros might have some decent weather.

Unfortunately I think this means Jon is in the wrong side, and the upcoming betrayal from the North might just fuel the fire. GRRM has stated that not much good results from his characters being resurrected.",7,6,False,self,,,,,

They share their pleasantries, but Cersei tells Cat about her first child, a rosy cheeked dark brown hair baby boy with blue eyes, who died. Ok. 

Later in S1, when Ned visits Gendry at the smith, he asks Gendry what Jon Arryn asked him about when he visited. At first Gendry says ""my work"", but then ""about my mother"". Ned asks him what he told Jon Arryn, Gendry replied ""I don't remember much, she died when I was a baby. She had yellow hair.""

One could argue Gendry is rosy cheeked, but certainly dark brown haired and blue eyed, like Robert. Cersei certainly has yellow hair.

Could it be that Gendry is the only true born son of Robert Baratheon and Cersei Lannister, and is the true heir to the throne? Most of us know the actor that plays Gendry has been spotted in Ireland, possibly for shooting. We also know the direct Baratheon line is dead otherwise, with Robert, Stannis and Renly gone, and no sons amongst them. 

I personally think Gendry is returning as possibly a highly skilled (or master) smith to help with the forging of new Valyrian swords for the BftD, but what if he's the true heir, and the way the Baratheon line continues? The only wrench in the whole idea for me is, why would they hide Gendry from Cersei and vice versa? Otherwise, it fits. Gendry never struck me as an unimportant character for some odd reason. Sure we joke about him continuously rowing, but he's (possibly) back for a good reason. This show is now infamous for the long play where long past clues pay off seasons down the road. What do you think?

Edit: as /u/KAU4862 mentions below, maybe that wrench is that Cersei got rid of him because she didn't want a son of Robert's being the heir, but rather one purely of her own. We know she resented Robert's love for Lyanna, especially after he drunkenly said her name while consummating his marriage with Cersei on their wedding night. Hm. 

TL;DR - Gendry is Cersei's first child she told Catelyn Stark about, and that she was told died, but is the true heir to Robert Baratheon and the Iron Throne. ",48,52,False,self,,,,,

But the thought of him doing a quest to rescue Dany in a predicament in the coming battles in the South is quite nice too. That would be a good way to start their relationship, I guess. Here is what I think:

- Jon has been on the center of many battles lately. It is a waste to miss the coming one in the South.
- Euron may have the ability to neutralize Dany's dragons, and may also employ some Faceless Men.
- Cersei might get to an alliance with Euron and Dany's conquest of King's Landing will not be as easy as we imagined.
- Bran is very near the Wall. Next season might start with him getting to Castle Black.
- Arya is in the Riverlands. So is The Hound, Brienne and Podrick, and quite possibly Melissandre.

What I'm getting in is that Bran will see Jon very soon and he will try convince him to go South - maybe because he thinks that is what must happen if they want to defeat the White Walkers. How he'll do it, I leave that to everyone's interpretation but know that Howland Reed is in the Neck (in the direction of the South) and Bran is possibly the only living person who knew Jon's birthname. Bran will assume regency in Jon's absence.

Remember how Mellisandre stares intently on Jon and Davos' eyes before she left Winterfell and that she did this too with Arya before and said to her that ""they will meet again"". I think that she knew that she will see Jon Snow again that's why she left without protest. On Davos though threatening her, I imagined that it's the opposite - they will never meet again.  

It would be amazing if Jon could form a small party with the guys on the Riverlands when he get there - when he somehow realized his mission, which is still vague to me what it is but somehow points him South. Arya would definitely go with him. And because of that, Brienne is compelled to go too because of her promise to Lady Kat. Melissandre will insist to join. And the Hound, of course, he'll go for Arya. This is more and more looking like a dream team. Maybe he'll pickup Samwell Tarly and his Heartsbane too on the way. That greatsword will be awesome on the hands of the Hound. 

Arya will deal with the other faceless men. The Hound will fight the Mountain. It will end with a one-on-one between Euron (in his valyrian steel armor) and Jon Snow. That battle will earn Jon the respect of the whole seven kingdoms and Dany's army. 

Looks like my fangasming has gone overboard on this one, but I like you guys to discuss what you think.",10,0,False,self,,,,,

Everybody has done that. Its really well done and satisfying, other than a few small but still irritating flaws in my opinion. One of them is Tywin's behavior. Throughout the whole Joffrey humiliating Tyrion he looks really angry, which he should be since his son and a Lannister is being humiliated by the king in front of lots of people from other families from around the world. But then when the cake arrives he just jumps up with a wide smile and claps like a child at the birds flying out of the cake. Its not like there are cameras around that going to catch him and he has to show that he is happy. It bothers me every time. Its quite out of character if you ask me.

The second one is worse because initially its a nice try to make his character more complex. Its when Joffrey in on the ground and Tywin goes to Tommen to cover his eyes. This is cool but it doesn't make sense because at this point nothing really horrible is happening. Unless Tywin knew Joffrey was poisoned and going to die a painful death. Joffrey could have just been throwing up or choking on some cake. I guess if the director wanted to show it he had to do it then since later it wouldn't have been time for Tywin to cover Tommen's eyes but it leads to it not really making sense.",13,16,False,self,,,,,

You don't have to answer all of them, just the ones you know. More details are always better.

1. If Stannis won the battle of Blackwater what would he have done with Jofrey, Tommen, Tyrion and other Lannisters in King's Landing? Was there any hope for them to be spared, and if not, in what manner would they have died?

2. If Selyse died sometime after Blackwater, and Stannis was in control of King's Landing, who could he wed, what are his options? Preferably women who would gain him a lot in terms of money or troops, as well as be able to produce heirs. I'm particularly interested in following matches: 

Stannis and Margery
Stannis and Asha
Stannis and Daenerys

All others


What about matches for his daughter? Who could he betrothe her to? I'm particularly interested in following pairings:
Shireen and Bran/Rickon
Shireen and Loras or Willas
Shireen and Robert Arryn

Followed by any other

4. Would he accept/leave Kevan Lannister and his side of the family if he bent his knee? Or would he demand him to stand down?

5. He has a number of landless nobles at his side, as well as landed ones. How would he reward the landless ones like Massey, Farring, Horpe and Suggs? What about the ones sworn to Dragonstone like Celtigars and Velaryons?

6. If Stannis decided to repurpose/rebuild the Dragonpit and turn it into a Grand Temple to the Red God, what could we expect when it comes to the people in general? (He allows free worship of other gods and rebuilds the Sept of Baelor)

7. Is there any chance to bring the leadership of the Red God's religion to Westeros from the Temple at Volantis?

(Apologies if this has been discussed to death already)

In Season 6 Jon never really had anybody to talk to about literally coming back from the dead, and without the inner monologue we get in the books I feel like the show wasn't quite able to portray the confusion and isolation Jon must have felt after coming back. Yeah, he had Mel but she isn't really somebody he can relate to and it's not like she's actually gone through something like that herself.

Que the chance encounter with Beric in Season 7. 

Here's a man who's been through hell, fights the good fight, and has been resurrected from the dead multiple times. A man Jon can relate to in many ways, which is pretty rare. There's just so much they could talk about from Ned to Beric fostering Arya for a time, etc.

Is there any way she might be related to the man the Night King was before he was turned by the Children of the Forest? Maybe she was his wife and the real ""Song of Ice and Fire"" is the tale of how these two have battled over hundred of years. I know that's far fetched and supposedly the NK is thousands of years old. But perhaps Mel is just as old.

I love Tyrion and am a huge fan of him. That being said, HBO's Tyrion is really starting to lose me. In earlier seasons Tyrion's actions were absolutely breathtaking. When Tyrion brought us our first trial by combat we all held our breath and sat on the edge of our seats in anticipation. His taming of the clans of the Vale with his masterful wordplay and bartering was a perfect combination of a dire situation and a comical one. We road into war not once, but twice with our favorite half-man. The first time may not have been the greatest battle (HBO changed Tyrion's POV of the war by knowing him out in order to save money, thanks Obama) On the other watching the battle of Blackwater Bay rage on as Tyrion proved he was a greater warrior than even the Hound, was one of the greatest moments in GOT history. We listened intently to Tyrions skilled intrigue in the court of Kingslanding, where few were his equal despite his stature. We felt Tyrions anger as his sister and father, along with many others striped him of his glory and showed him no common courtesy. We felt pain in our heart with the betrayals of Tywin, and the first woman Tyrion had loved since his wife Tysha. (Show watchers please look into this, it really adds to Tyrions character. http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Tysha ) We prepared for our own deaths when we watched in horror as Oberyn Martells mistake delivered us to deaths door. We looked in awe at the lifeless body of Tywin Lannister after we shot him. 
	
All this we did, with Tyrion, together. And its all this, that I feel that weve lost in Tyrion. As of this last season I feel that weve lost something in Tyrion. At first glance it may feel hard to wrap your head around the idea of Tyrions character degrading in what is arguably one of the greatest seasons of television of all time; but please try and hear me out.
	
As of late Tyrion seems to have been relegated to a more comedic position; whereas the actions he use to make were integral to the shows plot and had ripples that affected many of the shows characters. This season we saw Tyrion making awkward conversation with Missandei and Grey Worm. Tyrions drinking and joking have always been apart of his character, and a welcomed one at that. This season however not only were his jokes not there but it felt like Tyrion wasnt either. I understand that a good character isnt stagnant, and welcome change to characters. Tyrion was put into new and old situations that I was expecting to see him thrive in, but was very disappointed. Chief among these interests was his scene with Rhaegal and Viserion. You might think Im disappointed because of the popular fan theory. That Tyrion is a dragon seed (Targaryan bastard), but its much more than that. Tyrion, book and television wise has been the most knowledgeable POV character when it comes to dragons. Furthermore, he has even had dragon dreams like the Targaryans and their bastards (Daemon the Younger in A Knight of the seven Kingdoms). With all this hype riding on Tyrion and a potential dragon confrontation should have been more than just taking off Rhaegal and Viserions chains. This was made even worse when said dragons were able to escape from their confines upon Daenerys return in S6E9; their escaped begged the question of Tyrion taking their collars off even made a difference.
	
Perhaps there was too many expectations placed on Tyrions Dragon scene, after all it was his first and only interaction with dragons. I dont believe this, but I do think that it is definitely arguable. Regardless, Tyrion failed us elsewhere in his own home court. Intrigue has indisputably been Tyrions greatest weapon. Deprived of the chance to hone his body into that of a warrior, he instead put his all in sharpening his mind with knowledge. His intrigue in Kingslanding had few rivals to call his equal. Thats why it was a surprise and a disappoint when Tyrion erred so terribly in his negotiations with the Wise Masters of Slavers Bay. I trusted in Tyrion when he stifled the protests of Missandei and Grey worm, and took charge of the negotiations. I believed in him because he has time and time again shown his prowess in intrigue while other two had not ; even though Grey worm and Missandei knew the people they were dealing with better than Tyrion. Of course no man can win every battle, intrigue or otherwise. Indeed, there have even been times like Tyrions second trial by combat where his failure has not done anything to take away from his character. But this was somehow did not fit his character, it was almost painful to watch.
	
However even with all these critiques Ive found, and feelings of Tyrions character being very ineffectual; there was still a moment of clarity. For me, Tyrions final scene in season six was his saving grace from uselessness. Here you see Tyrion taking new shape with meaningful development in his conversation with his Queen Daenerys. The beauty of this scene is undoubtedly amplified by the feeling of coming full circle on the roller coaster that has been Tyrions life. His appointment to hand of the Queen was the manifestation of poetic justice. Sadly, however, and it really does hurt me to say this, this appointment is an action taken by Danny and not Tyrion. I dont want to take away from how the appointment means so much in so many ways from the perspective of Tyrion; but at the end of the day it was Danny that did this and not Tyrion. I havent given up on Tyrion, especially when hes gained a new position that is likely to propel him into the limelight to do what he does best. All I am saying is that Im going to need a lot more than last seasons Tyrion gave. Winter may be here, but Im ready to hear Tyrion roar.

TL;DR Tyrion Lannister has a reduced role in the show to the point of it being a detriment to his character. In opposition to his active roles that directly affect the plot in seasons 1-5, in season 6, he is relegated to a passive role that does have true impact on the plot. Really hopeful to see him return to a more active role in season 7.  ",22,14,False,self,,,,,

1. Going to play some role in reworking Valyrian steel to fight off the walkers. Maybe he rowed his damn boat to Oldtown.
2. He's actually the son of Robert and Cersei. She says her dark haired son died. He says his yellow haired mother died.

Did you?

Here is goes:

Back JUST after the red wedding, (when Walder Frey had Rob stark, his wife, his unborn child, his mother, most of his men killed. He also had most of the riverrun host murdered) there is a scene with Bran telling a fable about a man who killed people he had invited to his home, so the old gods punished him by turning him into a creature who was forced to continuously eat his own children. 

Bran specifies that it was NOT because he committed murder--rather--he was doomed to this fate because he killed guests in his own home. 

I KNEW this would come full circle with lord frey. 

Does anyone remember what happened in season 6 the winds of winter? Arya stark mader her triumphant return, and using the abilities she learned at the house of the many faced god, she killed walder frey, but not before killing his sons and baking them into a pie and feeding it to him.

He was punished the same way the gods had punished the man in the story.

I mean, I have no clue if D&amp;D even plan on wrapping up the show with that prophecy. If the last battle does end up with Lightbringer being wielded by Jon, or Jorah, or Gendry or whoever you've got your theory money on, it seems like it will just be a ""so what"" moment for those who only watch the show. Kind of like what happened in the season 6 finale when it was confirmed R+L=J. They never really mentioned Rhaegar enough in the show, so for non book readers the big reveal seemed to fall flat. 

I've noticed the same for Bran the Builder. If I recall correctly, the show hasn't mentioned the dude once. So if they're doing the time traveling thing with Bran and it shows that he indeed was every Bran that ever existed, then that too won't impact show watchers only as much as book fans as well. Again, I have no idea what D&amp;D have planned for the 2 remaining seasons. But some of the book lore is just so pulpy and filled with foreshadowing it would be a bummer to see it executed in such a dull way without all the build up.

However, that is only if you look at the [""official"" top episodes list](http://www.imdb.com/search/title?num_votes=1000,&amp;sort=user_rating,desc&amp;title_type=tv_episode&amp;utm_content=buffer8b7ab&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer), apparently based on the IMDb ""weighted averages"" ratings formula, which for some secret reason (which IMDb [will not disclose](http://www.imdb.com/help/show_leaf?votes)) is far harsher to Game of Thrones episodes than to ""Ozymandias"".

**According to the real ""arithmetic"" average of user votes, the highest-rated episodes of all time are ""The Winds of Winter"" (9.7967), ""Hardhome"" (9.7555), ""Battle of the Bastards"" (9.7469), and Breaking Bad finale ""Felina"" (9.7465) - while ""Ozymandias"" only rates 9.5611.** ([Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iAqBhezykbrR7WRQtpBuwDfblELWoPNh8vDztY5bz5c/)'s a full list of episodes that have a real average rating of 9.68 or higher).

The common claim that episodes with ~~less~~ fewer ratings will naturally have a higher average rating (because only true fans rate episodes), hence creating a bias towards niche shows, is obviously not applicable here - the episodes with the **most** votes ever are ""Battle of the Bastards"" (128875), ""The Winds of Winter"" (85940), ""Ozymandias"" (81083), ""Hardhome"" (55510) and ""Felina"" (55375) - in fact 28 of the [top 50](http://www.imdb.com/search/title?sort=num_votes,desc&amp;title_type=tv_episode) are GoT episodes (while 5 are BB episodes). 

(To put those numbers into context - ""Battle of the Bastards"" has more votes than ""Battlestar Galactica"" (121537), ""Downton Abbey"" (113671), ""Twin Peaks"" (111289) or ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" (102697), while ""The Winds of Winter"" has more votes than ""Sex and the City"" (80668), ""Top Gear"" (80150), ""Rick and Morty"" (78679) or ""Luther"" (72460) - despite the fact that all of the above are TV series, not single episodes.)

The only reason I can come up with is that Rhaegar had no reason to believe the Dornish were upset-- multiple wives wasn't unheard of and Elia could not bear anymore children so maybe Elia and the Dornish were okay wth Rhaegar taking a second wife.

An Educated Guess as to the Outcome 
of The Game of Thrones TV Series


Daenerys Targaryen lands on the Westronian coast with her armed forces, backed by the three dragons that have brought her infamy. So begins the battle for Kingslanding.

The supposed Mad Queen - Cersei Lannister - sits on the Iron Throne unwilling to bend the knee, her brother by her side.

The conflict is a bloody one, with both Queens fighting for the right to sit on the throne. Tyrion Lannister, serving as Daenerys hand of the Queen, manages to reach his brother, Jaime Lannister, and talks him out of serving Cersei whos claim to the throne is less legitimate than that of Daenerys.

Having grown distant with his sister and lover, Jaime realises that he has no choice but to give in to historys cyclical nature and kills Cersei; thus becoming not only the King Slayer but the Queen Slayer too.

With the conflict over, Daenerys takes her place on the Iron Throne; laying claim to Westeros.

Meanwhile, the North has banded together under their elected leader Jon Snow, the King of the North, and readies itself for the hardship that is to come.

Pushed south by Winter and with the intent of catching Daenerys off-guard, the Northern forces march towards Kingslanding. However, they meet the Southern might that has marched towards them in order to nullify their first move1. 

The Song of Ice and Fire has truly begun.

Daenerys dragons make short work of the Northern forces at first2, however mid-battle one of the dragons turns on the other two, placing its allegiance to Jon Snow3; the half-Targaryen Prince who was promised.

During the battle, sworn to protect the Stark lineage, Brienne of Tarth uses the Valyrian sword given to her by Jamie to kill one of the other two dragons4 saving the life of Sansa Stark.

Losing two dragons during the battle marks a drastic change in Daenerys tactics, and she retreats back to Kingslanding in order to draw the Northern forces back into territory in which she has the advantage.

The Northerners follow, and the battle moves to Kingslanding. This conflict is bloodier than the first, resulting in Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen duelling each other on their respective dragons while the battle rages bellow. At some point within the conflict, both Tyrion and Jamie switch allegiance and join the Northerners in their attempts to defeat the now Mad Queen. During the fight, Kingslanding is destroyed and laid to rubble5.

Jon wins the battle and kills Daenerys, but not without suffering terrible loses within his forces.

With Daenerys gone, the throne is once again free to be claimed. Little Finger attempts to take it for his own, but is killed by Sansa who is pronounced Queen of Westeros6.

With the conflict over, Jamie Lannister - having served his purpose - vows to serve the new Queen but no longer as head of the Queens guard. In order to repent for his sins of incest, lies and deceit, he swears to serve the Nights Watch and dons the colour black as Lord Commander of Castle Black7.

In light of his brothers vow to take the Black, Tyrion Lannister offers his services to Sansa and asks for position as the hand of the Queen8 which she accepts. 

With Sansa as Queen of Westeros and Jon Snow as Warden of the North, the Kingdom is once again unified. The next foe to face is Winter.

Having studied with the Maesters for a short time, Samwell Tarly brings news of a severe worsening in conditions in the North and an opinion of how to fight it9.

Armed with what little forces he has left and a dragon by his side, Jon moves North in order to fight the fight against the Whitewalkers.

Once in the North, the battle between men and Whitewalkers is a fierce one with Jons dragon serving as the mens only truly effective weapon. However. even the dragon seems not enough to win the war against the undead.

Just as the fight seems all but lost, Bran Stark reveals himself as the Three-Eyed Raven to both Jon and Samwell.

It is at this point that Sam will most likely reveal that the only way for them to defeat the Whitewalkers is for Jon, his dragon and Bran to die doing so9, 10, as the threat of such magic shall forever exist so long as there is any kind of magic in this world11.

United at last the two brothers join forces, with Bran Stark the Destroyer12 as the all powerful Three-Eyed Raven and Jon Snow riding the worlds last dragon, and make one last stand against Winter itself11.


* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 

Appendix

The following is thought to be an appendix to the actual story, and will most likely not feature as part os the main bulk of narrative. It is less of a prediction of how the series will end, but more an exploration of where the story could go after the Game of Thrones is over.


Having defeated the Whitewalkers and having died in the process11, Jon Snow, his dragon and Bran the Destroyer have rid the world of magic. Peace can once more be enjoyed in Westeros.

But just as the people of the realm are trying to piece together the lives that they have left after the song of Ice and Fire, several thousand ships are spotted arriving from an unknown civilisation to the west of Westeros13.

At first the newcomers appear to come in peace, but it soon transpires that they are here to conquer13.

Led by Queen Sansa, Westeros attempts to fight back against these new invaders but to no avail as these conquers are in possession of technology that Westeros had never needed invent: gunpowder13, 14.

The conflict between the two nations is a long and drawn out one15, and only once the Westronians manage to discover the secrets behind the new comers technological advantage do they manage to turn the tide of the war, eventually winning and opening up new possibilities to expand their influence within a new part of the Known World16.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

We would also like to mention that the reason no guesses were made as to Aryas role in the ending of the narrative was simply because no parallels were found by us between her arc and either other works of fiction or the lives of any historical figures, and therefore any inclusion in this theory would have been purely speculative.

______________________________________________________________________________


1. This mirrors English history; a major source of influence over George R. R. Martins work. In this case, it takes ideas from the Battle of Stamford Bridge, 1066.

2. This mirrors the Field of Fire, a battle featured in the lore of the universe that occurred when the Targaryens first conquered Westeros using their three dragons.

3. It is implied throughout the series that each dragon needs its own Targaryen rider, as they did when the Targaryens first invaded Westeros.

4. She shall perhaps mirror the myth of St. George, as the Valyrian sword was not placed in her possession by Martin inconsequentially.

5. As seen by Daenerys in a vision earlier on in the epic.

6. Both in spirit and in physical appearance, Sansa Stark mirrors Queen Elizabeth the First of England. Her desire to be Queen is also a long running theme of the series. However, her resemblance to Elizabeth Gloriana also implies that she will take no king.

7. Drawing many influences from J. R. R. Tolkiens Lord of the Rings series, Martin has taken certain aspects from Tolkiens Aragorn character and incorporated them into the character of Jamie Lannister; namely Aragorns shunning of his family name and position of power until the end of the narrative. Although not as glorious as Aragorns acceptance of his crown, Jaime taking the Black is him finally taking up a selfless position of power after a long character arc of coming to terms with responsibility.

8. With his various experiences with being hand to royalty, his vast knowledge of how to run a kingdom and the fact that Sansa and he were once wed, Tyrion serving as her hand seems plausible.

9. Not only does Samwells actions here mirror his past tendencies throughout the series, but like Jamie he shares some similarities with a character of Tolkiens in The Lord of the Rings, namely those of Samwise the hobbit. 

10. Having already died once Jon Snow shares a lot of similarities to that of Jesus Christ and will most likely die in order to save man from its sins, which in this case took the form of magic within the realm of the narrative.

11. Once again drawing from his influence of Tolkiens Lord of the Rings series, it is possible that Martin envisioned his epic ending with the destruction of an all powerful magical force. In The Lord of the Rings, that force was the One Ring. In the case of the Ice and Fire series, the all powerful magical force could well be magic itself embodied by the Targaryen lineage, dragons, the Whitewalkers and the Three-Eyed Raven. Magic is the link between the present and the ways of old within this realm, and like Tolkien Martin is not simply presenting us with a story about the end of an era, he is showing us the start of the age of man in a more modern world; one that has left the old ways behind them. While we are led to believe that we are witnessing an end to a story, we are actually experiencing the beginning of the full narrative, or a rebirth of sorts.

12. There is a possibility that Bran Stark is in fact Bran the Builder from the Age of Heroes, having used his powers of influencing the past in order to help build the Wall to keep the Whitewalkers at bay until they could be defeated by both himself and Jon Snow, but its almost impossible to tell if that is the case. There is also a possibility that the Wall itself will be destroyed during the conflict, but once again there is no evidence per se to back up this claim.

13. This is a reversal of the discovery of America by the Europeans by Christopher Columbus.

14. The idea that the reason why the people of the Known World have been stuck in an era of Medieval technology is because of the existence of dragons was put forward by the YouTuber The Nerdwriter in an interesting video on the subject.

15. This mirrors Queen Elizabeths long and drawn out conflict between England and Spain during the exploration of the New World during the 1500s.

16. This mirrors Englands expansion into the Americas during the 1600 and 1700s.

Because I watched the show only after finishing the books, I am curious to know the show-watchers' reactions to Jon's journey. Right now, he's the nearest thing to an archetypical hero that show has, and has been so since probably mid season 4. I wonder if it was the case in the beginning, when we had more heroic characters to root for. 

Edit: Thank you for all the replies. It's good to know how the show treated the depiction of character growths. My own views were biased towards specfic characters because of the Point of View chapters - although Robb was the king, it was Jon's head we spent time in via PoV chapters. So it was easy to assume people like Jon, Tyrion, Dany, etc were the main characters (although in the first book Ned had most chapters and we all know what happened to him).

Specifically two:

1.) **Hold the Door**: This one could be obvious to most of you, or if it isn't, I hope I make it so by the end of this paragraph. Hodor's heroic moment was possibly the most heartbreaking moment of television I have ever seen. We see a purely innocent character, who's sole purpose since Season 1 has been to help Bran in any way he can, die helping Bran. And the way the scene was introduced through Bran's flashback was absolutely brilliant. Bran *made* Hodor. Ever since that moment Hodor was destined to hold that door. It's perfect. It's tragic. It's an amazing twist by GRRM and it astonishes me how much it makes sense every time I think about it. You wanna know who *didn't* think about it? Bran. And Meera, I'll give her shit too. Not a single mention of Hodor was brought up in 6x06, 6x07, 6x08, 6x09, 6x10. The showrunners dropped the craziest twist to date and followed it up with **absolutely nothing**. No reflection from Bran, no guilt or remorse, not even a conversation with Meera about what Bran saw and did in his flashback. Nada. I hope GRRM gives Hodor the justice in the books that D&amp;D did not do in the show...

2.) **Jon Snow's resurrection**: This one is pretty obvious. We got a good ""shocked"" reaction out of Davos and Melisandre as well as a good humorous reaction out of Tormund and Edd, but man was I disappointed that the reaction to Jon's revival literally lasted 10 minutes. Maybe even less. The absence of an on-screen reaction from important people like Sansa or Jon's bannermen *severely* undercuts the importance of Jon's death IMO. It even begs the question why Jon was even killed at all. Yes, I know his death provided an incredibly shocking and dramatic end to Season 5, but if you're going to show a cliffhanger like Jon Snow's death and then decide to revive him, you **HAVE** to follow it up with logical dialogue and reactions worthy of a crazy twist like a revival. Once again, at least we have GRRM's version to look forward to...",14,0,False,self,,,,,

Curious what people on this sub think about my ideas:

My money's on a Stark dying in season 7. This is why:

This show obviously focuses largely on the journey of the Starks. Since the beginning of the story, GRRM/D&amp;D have proven time-and-time again they're not afraid to kill members of this protagonist family (I'm including D&amp;D because we're not exactly sure about the source of major plot points as the show goes past the books).

Ned, Robb, Catelyn, Jon (even though he returns later), and finally Rickon have all been killed now. When you look at why they were killed, it's always due to a fatal flaw in their personality - acting on principle rather than for the greater good.

- Ned because of his honor.
- Robb because of his love for Jeyne/Talia.
- Catelyn because of her love for her children.
- Jon because of his sympathy for the wildlings/love for Ygritte.
- Rickon because he's always been a pawn/shaggydog (see: https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/3bhcqk/spoilers_all_on_rickons_shaggy_dog_story/).

So, of the remaining Starks that haven't been killed (already), what are their flaws?

- Sansa's primary flaw is the suppressed desire to control the world by taking advantage of those around her as she has learned from Littlefinger. This was emphasized and confirmed in her actions surrounding the BotB and the aftermath - using Littlefinger/Knights of the Vale without Jon's knowledge and reveling in killing Ramsay.
- Arya's flaw obvious flaw would be her desire for revenge.

While both of these flaws would work to set-up the killing of another Stark, I am guessing that the most likely scenario IMO would be: Sansa and Littlefinger inadvertently go down together in a scheme that undermines someone Sansa should care deeply about (probably Jon). Arya, on the other hand, will likely realize her family is more important than her desire for revenge and will spare killing someone on her list in order to protect her family. Fill in the details as you like, but based on how GRRM kills his Starks, that's my prediction.

In the S6 finale, during the KITN scene Lord Glover (was it?) was the one who said it was Jon Snow who avenged the Red Wedding, however all he did was get payback on one of the participants - The Boltons. Sure, the Boltons were the ones who took it into their own hands to openly rebel and take control of the North, Roose Bolton was the one who took it upon him to betray the King in the North, Robb Stark. Roose and the rest of the Boltons got the sword for their actions during and after the Red Wedding thanks to Jon (and Sansa, and I suppose Ramsay lol.) but there are still two other sides to point the finger at. It was Walder Frey who broke Guest Right and massacred the Stark family and army in his own home. I think we can all agree he is the one most to blame for the Stark's downfall. IIRC It was his sons who stabbed Talisa, and cut Catelyn's throat. How fitting that later in the S6 finale, none other than the daughter of a Stark is the one to truely avenge the Red Wedding by feeding Walder Frey his own sons, nicely baked into a pie (thank you Hot Pie!) before cutting his own throat the same way they cut Catelyn's. That was one of the most satisfying scenes for me being a Stark fan. However, I dont think it's quite avenged just yet - There is still the Lannister's role in the Red Wedding. They are the ones who turned Walder Frey with their offer, and convinced the Boltons to rebel. At this point there's a bunch of things branching off from each other, Tywin was the one who pulled off the deal (or was it?), and he was killed by his own son whom he hated, Tyrion. This is the same Tyrion who was framed for the attempted assassination of Bran, by Littlefinger claiming the dagger that was used belonged to him. And as it happens, it was Littlefinger who originally betrayed Ned Stark and caused the entire war to happen. So even with Tywin gone, one could argue that Littlefinger had a part to play in this whether he meant it or not. So, do you think Littlefinger's involvement will come to light in the next season? Will Sansa learn that the death of her father (and by extention everyone at the Red Wedding) was all Littlefinger's doing, and come to her senses once and for all? Imo, Littlefinger is the last piece to the puzzle. Take him out, and the atrocity commited against the Starks will have finally been avenged - repaid in blood.

Sorry I went slightly off-topic there, I can't help being a die-hard House Stark supporter. :P",19,9,False,self,,,,,

Supporting evidence; 
1. Jamie's story arc is complete, with him letting Brienne and Pod go, and his entire family dead, or gone. 
2. When Arya saw Jamie at the twins, she was definitely staring him down, for some reason. 
3. The look Jamie gives Cercei as she is crowned.
4. Ayra must kill Cercei for her arc/list to remain relevant.

Disclaimer: I am a showlny watcher who reads a lot of Wiki articles and reddit/watchers on the wall theories, etc. Basically I think I'm a fairly advanced showlnly watcher, but admit *I know nothing* compared to the book readers (and certainly compared to those of you fantasy/sci-fi jedi who have actually read some [or all] of these other source materials) Basically I am prefacing  with this because this is new info to me, but might not be to some of you, so my apologies if I am late to the party and/or misunderstood/misinterpreted something)   
 
Disclaimer II: I know this topic has been discussed before, [like here](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/2kjkv4/possible_inspiration_for_azor_ahai_spoilers_all/) but I couldn't find a recent or very thorough discussion on here. So I hope this becomes one... 

Ok, disclaimers aside, this started with me looking into the deep past of Planetos for connections between the different iterations of the Azor Ahai/Last Hero tales from around the world. The names are clearly similar and seem to evolve as they travel across geography (and perhaps time.)  Here's a list of the names used (mosty from Essos, where the tale seems to originate)   
 
Azor Ahai  name used in R'hllor religion, origins in Shadow Lands/Asshai (Eastern Essos) - home to Melisandre and Blood Magic and origin place of Dragons as well  
  
Huzhor Amai  ancestor of the Tall Men, founder of the Kindgdom of Sarnor (Northern Essos)  

Hugor of the Hill  founder of Andalos and great hero of Andals, founder of Faith of the Seven (North-West Essos)  Possibly the first White Walker **(my personal tinfoil theory)**  

Hukko  alternate name of Hugor - used in Pentos (South-west Essos)    

Hyrkoon the Hero  an alternate name used for Azor Ahai in the Patrimony of Hyrkoon civilization  (Northeast Essos, North of Asshai)   

Yin Tar  same guy, only now in Yi Ti (aka the Planetos analog to China  the very far east, east of Asshai even)  no name similarities, but we can chalk this up to major linguistic differences. There are some interesting story parallels however, especially with  

Eldric Shadowchaser  the most random, apparently unrelated and mysterious name for the Last Hero. Until you google it. Then you find out this was basically the name of another famous fantasy hero from a series in the 70's, and his nemesis (and cousin) was named **Yyrkoon**  - they were both created by one of GRRMs big influences, Michael Moorcock,.  [link to Wikipedia article on Moorcock's Elric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elric_of_Melnibon%C3%A9)   

Now, thats pretty interesting, but it gets better. Not only are the names of the characters of Elric and Yrkoon eerily similar to Eldrik and Hyrkoon the larger encompassing story fits even better with what we are seeing in GRRMs ASOIAF series numerous heroes with similar but different names over time, playing similar hero roles to maintain the balance/order of the world. [link to Moorcocks Eternal Champion article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_Champion)    

Heres an excerpt: *The Eternal Champion, a Hero who exists in all dimensions, times and worlds, is the one who is chosen by fate to fight for the Cosmic Balance; however, he often does not know of his role, or, even worse, he struggles against it, never to succeed. Since his role is to intervene when either Law or Chaos have gained an excess of power, he is always doomed to be surrounded by strife and destruction, although he may go through long periods of relative quiet. All the incarnations of the Eternal Champion are facets of each other, and the Champion may also be aided by a companion, who, like himself, exists in various incarnations. Likewise the Champion is often associated with a romantic interest that is possibly an aspect of an eternal figure In every aspect, the Champion is a warrior almost without peer: when he wields some version of his usual weapon, the Black Sword (known by various names such as* **Stormbringer** *or Kanajana, although not all versions of the Sword are the same and some are active entities in their own right) and few can stand against him. He is also usually an adept, if often unwilling, leader of fighters and has strategic and tactical abilities.*  
  
Now, this is interesting to me not just because it illuminates the origins of the story, but because it hints at where the story may be headed. I have only read the wiki page, so I could be way off here, but it seems as though the Eternal Champion idea plays out with heroes appearing on both sides of the Yin and Yang in Moorcocks universe (Law vs. Chaos)  sometimes the dark side gets too strong, and sometimes its the light side that needs to be put in check. The Hero can be fighting for either side. What matters most is the restoration of balance between them  so that neither can truly dominate (and hence destroy the world/universe).   

Ok, so what?  
  
Well, I posit this means that Jon and Dany do in fact represent the Dark and Light sides of the universe respectively (Ice and Fire). I could be totally off base, maybe they are both on the same side and will fight together as lovers or at least allies, but I think this suggests they will fight against each other, ultimately to a draw in the end. It seems likely to me that the re-emergence of magic and dragons in the world is a result of things being off-balance (so are the messed up seasons and occasional ""Long Nights""). So, balance must be restored, and the unconscious powers of the universe have selected their ""Eternal Champions"" to face each other... (or, alternatively, the Co-Champions of Law/Light/Fire will have to defeat the White Walkers/Others, who are representing the Chaos/Darkness/Ice)   

What do you all think? What have I missed? (plenty, Im sure)  Please pick this apart as much as you want, or add something I may have missed. I am very curious what you all think!

His current weaknesses: He couldn't make Sansa queen of the North and she flat out distrusts and rejects him. He has no solid hold on Jon and would have a lot of trouble controlling him to further his own goals due to Jon's determination to fight the dead rather than the living. The North is slowly unifying behind Jon therefore the amount of soldiers loyal to the Starks is increasing. As a result LF's army is proportinally less and less important (even though it is still very valuable).
His strength: He has is the Vale's army but even his control over that is questionable, I'm pretty sure they wouldn't follow him if he tried to turn on the Starks. He controls the vale through Robin, but it can be taken easily from the sea. If Danny lands some of her army in the vale while LF is away with the army he could lose it all. If she brings her dragons then he better declare for her asap because even the Eyrie can be easily taken by her.
So basically he has thrown his weight around in the vale and managed to get an army to save the Starks but they would barely lift a finger for him.
At this point Varys seems to be in the better position, with Dorne, The reach, the Dothraki and Dany behind him (And the Golden Company as well in the books).

If the White Walkers need time to grow and develop, Crasters sacrificed male children are currently growing to become the next generation of White Walkers. Presume this process takes thousands of years and why the ""long night"" only happens every few thousand years.

It would make sense that the northern Army led by Jon would only need to kill the remaining 11 White Walkers and the spell controlling the army of undead wights would be broken and they should just fall back to the ground similar to how they were raised. There are enough Valaryian swords left for 5-6 warriors to attack and defeat the White Walkers.

As a side note, the mark on Bran may make him also live thousands of years similar to the White Walkers, and may be the same thing that happened to the 3ER. This could be why he also lived so long.

How is it that they have been stuck in the Middle Ages (with technology from the historic Earth Middle Ages) for thousands of years? Why can't the history references be in terms of hundreds of years? Is 100 years not long enough for people to think that ""hundreds of years ago"" is a very long time in the past? Earth Human civilization is hardly more than 5 or 6 thousand years (depending on how you count the Neolithic Age) so how is it that the history of Westerosi civilization is thousands of years old but their technology has not advanced to Star Trek level yet? Seriously, what does George RR Martin have to say about it? I mean come on. Anyone with even a little knowledge of Human civilization on Earth knows that technology has developed at an increasingly rapid rate over the course of just the last two thousand years so how is it possible that it did not in Westeros? The people of Westeros are not stupid. Are they simply technologically unimaginative? Are there certain properties of physics which prevent them from developing advanced machines or things like electricity? Maybe electricity doesn't exist in Westeros. And whats the deal with the ten year winters? How is that even possible? everything would die if the winter lasted for ten years.

1. From Tyrion IV when Tyrion is talking with Littlefinger, and asking how close he (Littlefinger) is to the Tullys:


"" 'I had their maidenhoods. Is that close enough?'
The lie--Tyrion was fairly certain it was a lie--was delivered with such an air of nonchalance that one could almost believe it. Could it have been Catelyn Stark who lied? About her defloration, and the dagger as well? ""


What about the dagger does Tyrion think Catelyn could've lied about?



2. Also from Tyrion IV when Littlefinger is examining a knife:



""There was mischief in Littlefingers' eyes. He drew the knife and glanced at it casually, as if he had never seen it before. ""Valyrian steel, and a dragonbone hilt. A trifle plain, though, It's yours, if you would like it.""



""Mine?"" Tyrion gave him a long look. ""No, I think not. Never mine."" He knows, the insolent wretch. He knows and he knows that I know and he thinks that I cannot touch him.




What does Littlefinger know??






3. These dagger questions got me to thinking, who actually ordered the assassination of Bran? Neither book nor show ever explicitly states who did it...?






4. Also from Tyrion IV, when Tyrion says Littlefinger can have Harrenhal, when they're discussing how to get Lysa Arryns forces in the war:



""I'd sooner have you seated in Harrenhal than Renly seated on the Iron Throne. What could be plainer?""



""What indeed. You realize that I may need to bed Lysa Arryn again to get her consent to this marriage?""




What marriage are they referring to? Myrcellas marriage to Lysa's son Robert Arryn as part of the deal? Or was it implied somewhere that Littlefinger would marry Lysa? If so, where was this implied?




Lastly, in the show, did Littlefinger marry Lysa Arryn because Tyrion implied/told him to or for another reason? Did he even marry her or just start a romance with her?

Anyways this is probably not a shocker but more insight on evidence I think I realized the other day.

So I'm sure we all toyed with the idea of the three headed dragon or the big three : Khalisi, Snow, and Tyrion winning at the end.  Obviously with Tyrion becoming the hand of the queen adds to it but I think the final rulers are all 3 with equal power.  I think this because each character's strengths cover the others' weaknesses. It's like starting with all 3 pokemon for you young bucks like me. 

Denaryus (always spell it wrong) has the name.  She is a targaryun. She is also strong willed and also arrogant going into battle.  However she has trouble taking a step back from the fight and thinking it through.  She also will use her names and titles thinking it will get her through situations (She's been getting better at this throughout the series obviously).  She struggles as a diplomat but is great at asserting power when nessisary.  Her teams moral seems based on her status alone.

John Snow never had the name (Even though he totally does).  Everything he has ever done has been earned by him and him alone.  John is a great battle commander but is doubted by some higher ups due to his lack of name.  He is also way too impulsive and makes mistakes in the heat of the moment.  Jon strives as a moral man and inspiring power in those under him. However, he does not fare well as a diplomat and has trouble talking out of the heat of the moment.  He rarely asserts his power over others and sees himself as an equal.

Tyrion ties it all together at the end.  Sure he has the name (but does he really at this point?).  Tyrion has no strength or power.  He uses his mind to use others' power to his own use.  He is always 5 steps ahead of everyone else diplomatically but will keep those who he truly trusts up to his speed.  Tyrion only once exhibited his inspiration to others in the battle of blackwater so we can say it isn't a strength.  As he has no power he can obviously not assert this on his people so he relies on his mind and diplomacy.

All three balance each other out perfectly to run the perfect kingdom (or 7).

Not sure if this has been brought up before but I had a eureka moment the other day and felt the need to post. Although I have thought they would all rule together eventually, I could never really answer the question of ""why"".

At first i thought there is little point for bran to Visit Valyria. But then i had an idea. If i remember correctly Bran already had a vision of Jon defeating a White Walker with a valyrina steel weapon. So Bran knows valyrian steel is one of the few ways to kill them. So perhaps once he get's to the wall and has better control over his powers he will go back in time to learn the method for making valyrian steel. He will use this knowledge to train a smith possibly Gendry. I doubt they will have enough time to produce enough swords to arm everyone against the Whites but they will be able to make new valyrian steel weapons that will help in the fight against them. What do you think of this theory? In my opinion valyrian steel has to become more important. They've already shown how useful the steel is against them. For it not to be used as a major plot point against the Whites would make no sense to me.,10,7,False,self,,,,,

With Drogo's death, she put the eggs into the pyre and walk in herself. I didn't give it much thought the first time I watched it, however I realise she said 'You don't understand' to Jorah.

She also said something along the lines of 'a true dragon cannot be hurt by fire' when she sees her brother get a golden crown.

I'm realising that she always knew she was a true dragon, perhaps she had her doubts her brother was prior to the crown incident?

But back to my original point, she knew she would be unaffected by the heat, but did she know the eggs would hatch? Or was that just a lucky guess?",17,13,False,self,,,,,

GRRM once said that a villain is the hero of the other side, and if Jon and Daenarys were to face off, think of what they would see each other as:

Jon Snow, the bastard son of the honorable Ned Stark who you heard get shit talked by Jorah, deserter from the Nights Watch, bedder of wildlings, and uses the sword which rightfully belongs to Jorah as his weapon. Supported by the not-rightful (according to Dany) lady of House Mormont, Lyanna, and also by the wife of a flaying motherfucker, Ramsay Bolton. Used savages to conquer his family's seat (legally Sansa's, since no one knows Bran is alive), and broke away from the Seven Kingdoms like his usurper brother and proclaimed himself (probably what Dany will hear) King in the North. 

Daenarys Targaryen, incest-baby of the Mad King, wife of a savage horse lord. Used witchcraft to kill him, and usurped as much power as possible. Hatched three dragons and used them to wreak havoc and threaten the cities of Slavers Bay, taking sellswords, slaves, savages, reavers (Ironborn), and worst of all, sand snakes, into her ever-growing army of evil. Mother of dragons, she razes every city she gets to, killing the Thirteen of Qarth (rumors work in strange ways, as proven by the books, where rumors seriously get warped from what truly happened), and murdering the peaceful warlocks, who were a power threat to her, and aided by the devil Imp and the traitorous eunuch. 

It also KIND OF mimics the dance of dragons (two targs fight, thats about it). 

There's one other problem though. How will Jon get an army to fight Daenarys's anti-archetype of the villain? He will have to make an alliance with the one and only Night's King (another one to add to the bad list for Jon). We never witnessed him actually doing anything which would necessarily be evil, maybe the 3ER was like a terrorist beyond the wall, and wildlings are illegal immigrants to them (plus the wall which places a barrier between the warmer south and the colder north). Plus, what if NK isn't enslaving corpses, but enlightening them? What if he is filling these corpses with the perspective of the dead, and how they see wildlings as evil? Currently, Nights King is the perfect villain archetype (ugly, kills without being provoked, supernatural force with huge supernatural army, isn't human, magical, etc), so this would add a unique twist.

Maybe based on statistics, but with a huge show like GoT I'm sure the numbers would increase regardless of whether it was every year or every two years.


A show of this caliber could definitely use a 2 year break between seasons. It would probably result in better quality and storytelling.

Letting the audience know who his mother truly is and knowing that he is still unaware brings the viewers so much closer to the character. You are finding out that a bastard, who still believes that to be true, has gone through his life so far believing he had a mother who didn't love him. He was loathed by the only motherly figure he had in his life and shunned from others because of his alienation. Finding out he in fact had a mother who loved him was incredibly emotional and a truly  moving revelation. I still think that was arguably one of the most beautiful scenes in the show (or any show for that matter). 

Just thinking of what Jon's reaction will be when someone tells him who his mother is; the fact that she loved him, and the fact her dying thoughts and actions were for the protection of her baby boy, is going to be amazing. I believe Jon's father will surely be of significant importance for the overall series and ending, but I don't think that needs to be revealed to Jon. His story would conclude perfectly just for him to know that he wasn't an unloved bastard.

I was thinking of how much better-prepared Westeros would be for the WW attack if it hadn't spent the past decade or so destroying itself, and losing valuable warriors, leaders, and resources. 

With that in mind- what would be the most effective governing organization to defeat the WW? I tried to simplify things as it could get quite complicated by bringing in Essos, Braavos, and various keeps- so the rules would be:

1) Choose a king, hand, and three king's guard. 

2) Pick four wardens, each with a hand and three guard as well.

3) You can choose any character that we have seen on the show alive, as an adult. So, for example, Arthur Dayne and Aerys would be eligible, but Rhaegar and Brandon Stark would not.

4) You can assume any geographical jurisdiction that you want. For example, I gave he riverlands, winterfell, and the iron islands to the North, and Dorne, the stormlands and Highgarden to the South. These groups should be able to work together.

5) While strategy and battle leadership are of obvious importance, being able to keep hold of the kingdom, rule in a chaotic time, rally sufficient bannerman and wardens, and be competent and fair governors are also important.

6) Assume everyone is fully aware of the impending doom of the WW. This would realistically help quell squabbling amongst the major houses 

King: Tywin Lannister

Hand: Stannis Baratheon

Guard: Arthur Dayne, Gregor Clegane, Baristan Selmy


Warden of the North: Eddard Stark

Hand: Davos Seaworth

Guard: Robb Stark, Rodrick Cassel, Brynden Tully


Warden of the West: Jaime Lannister

Hand: Randyll Tarley

Guard: Bronn, Brienne of Tarth, Sandor Clegane


Warden of the East: Daenarys Targaryen

Hand: Tyrion Lannister

Guard: Jorah Mormont, Grey Worm, Dario Naharis


Warden of the South: Robert Baratheon

Hand: Oberyn Martell

Guard: Loras Tyrell, Syrio Forell, Jaqen H'ghar


Lord Commander of the Night's Watch: Jon Snow

Hand: Jeor Mormont

Guard: Khal Drogo, Tormund Giantsbane, Wun-Wun

Rationale:

Throne- had trouble choosing which one to be the king and which to be the hand, but Tywin and Stannis would keep the kingdom in order and design a sound plan to allocate their resources and defenses appropriately. I don't think anyone would defy them.

North- A bit seasoned for sure, but they would need experience and compassion as their people will be the most vulnerable, being the first line of attack. essentially keeping the original northern crew intact, but Davos would add a lot of value as he is a rational and caring advisor, good at securing resources and support, could perhaps help  lead the iron island fleet and would be a great fit with Ned.

South- definitely the most eccentric/fun/batshit crazy group. Bobby B would really thrive in Dorne. Considered throwing greatjon Umber in there for good measure, but I imagine he hates the sun. Admittedly could endanger the welfare of the people. I'm imagining a very laissez-faire government, which moves with Dorne anyways, but their people are furthest from the point of attack and this group would do some serious damage when the fighting starts.

East- Dragons perched atop the bloody gate and patrolling the skies surrounding the Vale. Drogon catching dinner as it drops through the moon door. Seemed obvious.

West- Jaime has a lot of potential in commanding the Lannister forces, and Tarley is a notoriously fierce warrior. Plus, the Bronn, Brienne and Hound dynamic would be very entertaining if they didn't kill each other. Considered both brienne and the hound for the north and castle black, but those areas had a lot more options to choose from (even with key omissions like Alisser, Benjen, Yoren, Jory, Mance, Arya etc.) 

Wall- chose Jon over Jeor because of his forward thinking and ability to unite the free folk to their cause, though Jeor is a strong commander and will be a good hand. Perhaps the biggest reach from any group is Khal Drogo, and the shirtless Dothraki probably don't like snow. But the Dothraki army is crucial and I don't think he would fit anywhere else besides with Dany, but there he would have to take a subsidiary role which is not likely at all. The wall is kind of the default place for warriors and those that don't fit, so the idea is that the Dothraki would be accepted and later given sovereignty just as the free folk were. Plus the Dothraki, free folk and night's watch combo would be formidable. 

Plus, a lot of these include interactions i would have liked to have seen on screen.",10,10,False,self,,,,,

I was reluctant to start the HBO series, partially because I wasn't sure how they would be able to recreate the overwhelming scope of the books and partially because I really grew attached to the characters I created in my mind. After many years of suffering and waiting for the 6th book, I relented and started to watch GOT this summer. While I wasn't too excited about S1 (were the Dothraki really that clean?), I thought seasons 2 and 3 were entertaining and well done.

I cannot say the same for season 4. Maybe its the season 3 hangover, but so far I've found this season to be a series of formulaic, cheap thrills. It seems that every episode so far involves some tense, suspenseful scene where inevitably someone or something pops out of the shadows to attack the protagonist of the scene. Some are clearly going to happen and are cued by classic movie tropes/images/music, and still others seem totally random and really unnecessary to drive the plot forward...these cheap thrills, coupled with the painfully predictable dialogue [Viper](#s ""I will be your champion""...oh jeez) and stuffy characters, are starting to sour my already tentative enjoyment of this show. 

Does this stop? Can I sit back and enjoy the remaining two seasons, or does the show devolve even further into pop-porn and cheap ""scary"" thrills the show seems to be in S4?  Does anyone else feel this way about S4?",10,0,False,self,,,,,

Perhaps this means he will die in the future, or perhaps it means more that he wasn't struck down for his crimes. Perhaps this is because he will be Azor Ahai. When he was burned by his brother, you could say his former self died and he was reborn into what we now know as the Hound. Also I would find it very ironic but awesome that a character who fears fire would wield a sword on fire. Maybe to over come his fear, maybe when/if he kills his brother in clegane bowl his sword will catch fire and he will no longer be afraid. Idk, this thought struck me this morning.
Very far fetched and I am a strong believer that Jon is Azor Ahai, especially because of the tower of joy scene where he is born under what appears to be a sword with a star on it, and blood at the tip. But if it isn't Jon I think it will be the hound. Thoughts?",8,7,False,self,,,,,

The Welsh mythological texts of the Mabinogion were recorded between the 14th and 15th centuries in Middle Welsh. As a result, there are discrepancies regarding the spelling of names, because English translations maintain Middle Welsh orthography whereas Modern Welsh versions use Modern Welsh orthography. In Middle Welsh, there was some variation on the name Brn; other forms include Vran and Uran. In the Mabinogion, the character is referred to virtually exclusively as ""Bendigeituran""; that is, with the epithet ""Bendigeit"" (blessed or praiseworthy) attached. The only exceptions are in the patronymic of his son Caradog ap Brn and a single reference to his gathering in Ireland as Gwledd Brn, ""The feast of Brn (or 'Crow')"". This usage is followed in the Welsh Dryads. Bendigeituran becomes ""Bendigeidfrn"" or ""Brn Fendigeid"" in Modern Welsh; Bendigeidfran is the form used in many Modern Welsh adaptations of the Mabinogion.",2,3,False,self,,,,,

It has been a while since I read the books and I am just re watching the show for the first time. I was wondering whether keener book readers could clear up some characters motivations for me or perhaps the show portrays events differently to the books in these instances and I have forgotten.

1. Why is Robert more concerned about the existence of Danny than Viserys? In the show he mentions killing Viserys as well as Daenerys but it seems like an after thought. Surely Viserys, as the rightful heir to the throne is the true threat to Robert's reign, regardless of Daenerys' marriage to Khal Drogo. Any heirs of Viserys would have more claim to the throne than that of Rhaego?

2. Also, I'm aware of the Blackfyre Theory and it's relation to Varys. If you subscribe to this theory then why does Varys knowingly arrange Daenerys' assassination with the wine merchant? Or am I missing something? 

Like I said, it's been a while since I visited Westeros:)

Take Castle Black for instance. Maester Aemon serves as chief advisor to the commander and sole physician to the Night's Watch. To have properly trained assistants would be a godsend for him and having more capable hands would better serve the Watch's needs.

When Aemon grows too sick to fulfill his duties, the Watch is left in a bad position. His position is empty for quite some time and whoever replaces him will be well educated, but lacking in practical experience. That experience is crucial to performing the job, hence why aspiring doctors spend many years in a subordinate role learning on the job.

Honestly just found this subreddit, and had an interesting question, not sure if it's been posed before!

All out war ensues and a dragon falls, could it be brought back to life under the white walkers?

* A Westerosi Knight (Jorah)
* A Meereenese Champion
* A Dothraki Screamer

One of them is pretty clearly a Braavosi Water Dancer, as he has the same style of clothes and fighting style as Syrio Forel. I can't figure out the remaining two fighters though. There's the guy in yellow/brown that Jorah stabs in the chest and the shirtless guy with long hair who is speared by the Meereenese champion.

I agree her reign won't last long, but instead of Jaime vs Cersei... Aka, who's going to kill each other first, what if the opposite happens? What if she declares her brother, her lover / her king for all the realm to see? A few things were holding her back from going public with Jaime: 1. Tywin 2. Her children and their claims to the throne 3. The faith. Now that all have been wiped out and the realm already hates her, what does she have to lose? Perhaps this is why the Valonqar part of the prophecy is not mentioned in the show. Because it won't go down quite the way we think. She just may bring incest back to the throne the way it was during the reign of the Targaryens.. This is more of a show theory. Also, it would fit in nicely with the story arc that has been presented thus far. Think about it... Cersei threatened Tywin that she and Jaime would ""come out"" if he made her marry Loras. So clearly, she's not ashamed of it. Also, Jaime confessed his ""love"" to Lord Edmure, so he clearly doesn't give a rats ass who knows either. I could see the Season 7 conversation going a little something like:

""You burnt the sept and our son died. You suck and you need to die"" -Jaime
""How about, let's NOT kill me, fuck anyone who isn't us, let's show the realm what's up and make this shit official"" -Cersei
""OMG, all I've ever wanted is to love you, since the gods made me love a hateful woman... You know what, screw it, you're right. Let's do this shit"" -Jaime

Few however know how this came to be. The story starts with Valyria. After defeating their enemies to the east, the Ghiscari, the Valyrians started moving west through Essos. Many people would be displaced as a result of their colonial expansion. One of those peoples were the inhabitants of Andalos, the Andals. In addition to pressure from the Valyrians moving west. In their holy book the Seven-Pointed Star, That the Seven crowned the Andal prophet, Hugor of the Hill and promised him and his descendants great kingdoms in a foreign land. If the ancient Andals were anything, they were zealous. Andal warriors painted, and in some cases, carved seven-pointed stars on their chests and shield. So when the Septons told their people they needed to move, many followed without question. They loaded up in their longships and set west to find new lands in Westeros. The Andals first landed on the eastern tips of the Vale called the fingers. This, is corroborated by the fact that, Carvings of the seven-pointed star are scattered upon the rocks and stones throughout that area- a practice that eventually fell out of use as the Andal conquests progressed.


Upon their arrival in the Vale, the Andals were not viewed as a serious threat. Many of the First Men in the Vale decided to hire those Andals to help them fight their neighbors. Andals were dangerous foes that wielded steel weapons and armor while the First Men still used bronze. The lack of foresight to the dangers that this ever-growing Andal population would soon pose. Andals under the employ of lords of the First Men betrayed them and took their keeps and lands from them. The First Men spent too much time fighting between themselves. Soon enough the Andals came to own 75% percent of the Vale. At this point the Andals had become populous enough to start fighting among themselves as the First Men had before them.


During this time two great men were born to the Vale. The first being a prince to the house Royce which still survives today; the second being an Andal boy or of no great birth named Artys Aryn. For now, we shall focus on the former.


Robar Royce of Runestone came to the thrown of his petty kingdom at the young age of fifteen. His ancestors had been fighting the Andal invasion whole heartedly. So naturally it was no surprise that Robar readied himself to fight the Andals just as those who came before him did. Robar went about his fighting differently however. He first started off by uniting the remaining petty kingdoms of the first in the Vale. He did this by any means necessary, fighting, bartering, arranging marriages, and even, by outshooting the Lord Hunter in an archery contest (legend claims that King Robar cheated.) And one by one the remaining kingdoms of the First Men bent the knee to Robar in recognition of his rule.


With his new united kingdom Robar set to fighting the Andal Kingdoms in the Vale. He did this shrewdly by not making it known that his intent was the destruction of the Andal Kingdoms. This allowed him to take advantage of the in-house Andal fighting that they were experiencing. He would ally his forces with whatever Andal Kingdom that would help advance his agenda, and then ally with another when he saw a better opportunity. By the time the Andals realized what was happening they were already on the defensive. Robar destroyed the Andal Kingdom of the Fingers and personally slew Lord Qyle Corbray, taking the Corbray ancestral blade (Lady Forlorn) for himself. Next he set his eyes on Gulltown. Robar sent his sister inside the settlement to treat with the Shetts that had owned the town before the Andals. She promptly convinced them to open the gates to her brother, who took the town by force. After this victory the First Men marched on the Hammer King in the east, where they found victory once more.


It was at this time that it looked like the Andals would finally be forced out of the Vale after decades of fighting. With no other options the Andals chose to unite under the second great man that was aforementioned. This man was Artys Aryn. Sir Artys was an Andal born in the Vale underneath the Giants Lance, where eagles nest. For his sigil he took an eagle and a crescent moon, a device that he painted on his shield for all to see. The wings of the shield were matched by those on the helmet he wore. Artys was neither a high lord, nor a man of noble birth. He was however an exceptional fighter that earned the respect all those that he served with, and thats why the Andals chose him to lead their people.


The battle between the two forces of these men, would go on to decide the fate of the Vale and Westeros as a whole. What actually transpired during the battle has been lost to time, but the legends, stories, and songs still persist to today. From them we surmise that Robar arrived at the Giants Lance, where the battle would take place. He took a defensive position settling in the high ground with the mountain protecting their rear and sharpened steaks around their perimeter. The Andals were not without their own advantages. They held ten times as many mounted knights, and their metal was made of steel.


Upon the night the Andals arrived to the Giants Lance and set up camp Robar made sure to catch sight of the famed Falcon Knight Artys Aryn in his winged helm, similar to him in prowess and even age. On the eve of battle, seven stars were noticed in the sky. The Andals rejoiced and roared a battle cry for the stars were undoubtedly a sign of from their gods. A savage battle commenced between the First Men defenders and the Andals warriors. The Andals charged at the ranks of the First Men Seven times. The first six times the First Men stood strong and repelled the charge of their enemies. And on seventh charge a might warrior by the name of Torgold the Grim broke through the ranks of the First Men. He cut through men left and right with an axe in each hand. A sorceress loyal to Robar challenged him flinging curses from a red courser. Torgold, naked from the waist up merely howled with laughter, jumped onto her horse and ripped her head from her body watering the field with her blood.


Torgold was causing havoc all throughout the First Mens lines. The Andals were following his lead bursting through the defenses that hindered their path. Robar saw what was happening to his host and decided to take matters into his own hands. He cut his way through a dozen Andal warriors, and led a counter attack with Lady Forlorn dripping crimson in his hand. He did not stop until he reached Torgold who towered over Robar, and whos immense strength couldnt be matched. But Torgold erred when his naked hand grabbed for Robars weapon. Torgolds fingers flew from his hand and Lady Forlorn found a new home in his skull. The beast of a man died as he lived, with a smile on his face and a laugh booming from his chest.


And then they spotted each other. The Falcon Knight and King of the Vale. They came together and clashed swinging their weapons with deadly force and precision. Men fought and died all around them as the battle raged on. But in the end it was Robar who came from the duel victorious when his sword cut through the Falcon Knights helm.


Robar looked out over the battle and knew he had won the Vale for the First Men of his Kingdom. There was no way he could have been ready for the sound of the trumpets behind him. Upon turning around he was greeted with sight of Artys Aryn with 500 knights at his back galloping down the Giants Lance to take the First Mens forces from behind. The dead man dressed as the Falcon knight had merely been a feint to preoccupy Robar. Artys had been born in this part of the Vale, finding a path for his cavalry had been childs play for him. All that was left was the full defeat of Robars army as they were shattered by sir Artys and his cavalry.  It is a matter of debate when it comes to speaking of who dealt the Robar his death blow. What is known for sure is that of the thirty lords he brought to the battle, not one survived, and nor did this last King of the First Men in the vale. The remainng lords of the First Men bent their knees and proclaimed sir Artys as their king. And so ended the conquest of the Vale by the Andals. ",28,39,False,self,,,,,

Valonqar part of the prophecy:
So ""Valonqar"" means ""little brother"" in High Valaryian. But also is said to be a gender-neutral meaning, so technically it would mean ""little sibling"". This doesn't TECHNICALLY mean that it's one of Cersei's younger siblings, it could be anyone who is the youngest sibling.

Jaime: This is quite obvious and also a reason why I don't think he is the valonqar because it'd be too obvious. But it would still make sense if he was seeing now that he despises her

Tyrion: Cersei's actually little sibling who hates her because she treated him like shit his entire life, hmm.

More beautiful queen to take all that she hold dears part of the prophecy:
The entire series, D&amp;D made us think that this would either be Margaery or Sansa but at this point, Marg is dead and Sansa can't really take anything Cersei holds dear. I have some theories.

Dany: Of course, this is the most likely person seeing as Dany is on her way to Westeros right now and ready to take Cersei's crown away. 

Brienne: Cersei holds the throne/crown very dear but (besides her children who are all dead) the only other thing she holds dear is Jaime, now Brienne is already whipped on that Lannister dick and Jaime is done with Cersei so.....

Sansa: Now i know i said that Sansa has nothing to take from Cersei but no one really knows WHAT Sansa wants at this point, she's like the new queen of manipulation. Does she want the north? Does she want the crown? Does she just want peace? What do you want sis???

I'm aware Lysa, for a number of reasons, pretty much jumped at the chance to follow through. Her desire to be with Petyr, Jon's plan to have Robyn fostered, etc. 

I'd been under the impression that Petyr's aim was to cause a state of instability (*chaos is a ladder*). But surely he would've known Robert would turn to Ned to resume the role of Hand. So was this his plan all along, to have Ned brought to the capital? To have him uncover the truth about Cersei and Jaime? Had he wanted to cause discord between the Starks and Lannisters? Cersei had orchestrated Robert's death, but had his death been a part of Petyr's plan also? 

Obviously we know Baelish is out to become Ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. I'm assuming he'd always planned to wed Lysa, have her killed and take command the Knights of the Vale. Would his next move have been to have Tommen killed? Cersei? Tywin? He wasn't to know Tyrion would murder his father. Or that Cersei would inadvertently cause Tommen's death. Her actions have now lost her support of the Tyrell army. Making her much less of a threat to Petyr.

I just can't quite put my finger on whether he's had this entire thing planned out from the beginning. Or if he's an opportunist who creates chaos and acts according to the fall out. With Varys, I'm more confident that he's had some type of structured plan in place from the start. This going by his reaction to Tywin's murder, which had not been a part of his plan.

It's been a little while since I've read the books through, or seen the earlier seasons. So I apologise if I've overlooked anything!",13,9,False,self,,,,,

spoilers ahead.

i think to fulfill jaime's character arc -- the awakening to his morality -- he must kill cersei. there would be a lot of parallelism to this act of killing another mad monarch. jaime is often referred to in a derogatory way as ""king slayer"" because he murdered the mad king aerys. now he would also be known as ""queen slayer"" as well.

the reasons i think this plot decision would satisfy jaime's character arc are as follows:

- being both ""king slayer"" and ""queen slayer"" can be interpreted as jaime awakening to morality. he is not deterred by cersei being his sister/lover. he is willing to do what he believes is right, no matter what.

- when jaime killed king aerys it was because he made a decision. he decided to kill in the hope of saving lives, ie. lannister family + citizens of westeros dying from the mad king's use of wildfire. jaime's decision to kill cersei would show his continued moral growth. (if i were benioff/weiss/martin, i would consider having jaime kill cersei from the front to contrast stabbing aerys through the back. in my opinion, it symbolizes growth.)

- there are over-arching, satisfying parallels to the character progressions of other characters, ie. daenerys targaryen. in the past, robert baratheon took the iron throne from king aerys targaryen, effectively squashing dany's claim to the throne. dany reclaiming the throne through the act of jaime killing cersei would gesture at the history of game of thones in a way that i think feels satisfying.

- cersei used wildfire, which connects her to the mad king aerys.

- cersei is predicted to die, killed by ""the younger brother.""

i'm sure i'm missing other cool things.

please chime in with your thoughts and ideas.

Dany is ambushed and she loses half her fleet, a dragon, a Greyjoy, most of the dothraki, half the unsullied and some more Iron Born who revolt and join Euron before she ever lands. Cersei knows Jaime has lost faith in her and has the Mountain kill him before he can kill her (as foretold in the prophecy she believes). Brienne runs into the Brotherhood and they hang Pod before she can save him. The Hound (now born again) doesn't mention chickens or cunts even a single time!

""Aerys Targaryen's last Hand was killed during the sack of kings landing, though I doubt he'd had time to self into the tower. He was only Hand for a fortnight.  The one before him was burned to death.""

And this got me thinking, by now all the hands since tywin have been killed. Tywin survived because he betrayed Aerys, but was later on murdered by Tyrion, the 2 that followed him were also killed. Then we have Jon and Ned and we all know how that turned out. And after Tywin Kevan was hand if I'm not mistaken. Who was killed in the last episode by the Cersei's explosion. Does this mean Qyburn shall be killed?

According to the Azor Ahai prophecy:
&gt; There will come a day after a long summer when the stars bleed and the cold breath of darkness falls heavy on the world. In this dread hour a warrior shall draw from the fire a burning sword. And that sword shall be Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes, and he who clasps it shall be Azor Ahai come again, and the darkness shall flee before him.

The prophecy implies that the new Azor Ahai will have to forge a new sword and that sword will be LightBringer.

Azor Ahai is the song of ice &amp; fire. Many think Jon Snow is the song of ice &amp; fire by being part Stark (ice) &amp; Targ (fire). It could make sense that Lightbringer is also part ice &amp; fire. Lightbringer would then be the re-forging of the great Valyrian sword Ice. Lightbringer would be that of ice (Ice the sword) &amp; fire (a burning sword).",39,47,False,self,,,,,

The Maiden - (innocence, purity, love) : BRIENNE (There was even an iconic imagery in their bath scene, Brienne-the maiden holding wounded and naked Jaime, who was kind of reborn there)

He is an older man, and a seasoned battle commander. When Renly Baratheon, Lord of Storm's End, is appointed to King Robert's Small Council as Master of Laws, he appoints Penrose as castellan of Storm's End. Among other things, Ser Cortnay Penrose takes up the duty of raising Edric Storm, one of Robert Baratheon's bastards (Edric's mother is a cousin of Stannis' wife, Selyse). 

When Renly is killed and a large chunk of his men join Stannis, Stannis decides the time is right to take Storm's End, the castle he believes Robert robbed him of when he named Renly as its lord. Cortnay Penrose holds the castle, knows he can expect no help from the Crown (having declared Storm's End for Renly rather than Joffrey) or anywhere else, and he knows what Stannis and Melisandre intend to do with Edric Storm, who has King Robert's blood  (in the show, Gendry takes Edric's place as the bastard of Robert's who Melisandre intends to burn; in the books, Gendry's story ends with him staying with the Brotherhood Without Banners). 

Despite having no hope of help coming from anywhere, Ser Cortnay decides he will stay loyal to his king and hold Storm's End (as well as young Edric whom he's so fond of) as ordered by his king, and defy Stannis, leading to a parley outside the castle gates, where he essentially tells Stannis and his lords where to stick it.

&gt; Davos had almost forgotten how high and thick the walls of Storms End loomed up close. King Stannis halted beneath them, a few feet from Ser Cortnay and his standard-bearer. Ser, he said with stiff courtesy. He made no move to dismount.

&gt; My lord. That was less courteous, but not unexpected.

&gt; It is customary to grant a king the style Your Grace, announced Lord Florent. A red gold fox poked its shining snout out from his breastplate through a circle of lapis lazuli flowers. Very tall, very courtly, and very rich, the Lord of Brightwater Keep had been the first of Renlys bannermen to declare for Stannis, and the first to renounce his old gods and take up the Lord of Light. Stannis had left his queen on Dragonstone along with her uncle Axell, but the queens men were more numerous and powerful than ever, and Alester Florent was the foremost.

&gt; Ser Cortnay Penrose ignored him, preferring to address Stannis. This is a notable company. The great lords Estermont, Errol, and Varner. Ser Jon of the green-apple Fossoways and Ser Bryan of the red. Lord Caron and Ser Guyard of King Renlys Rainbow Guard... and the puissant Lord Alester Florent of Brightwater, to be sure. Is that your Onion Knight I spy to the rear? Well met, Ser Davos. I fear I do not know the lady.

&gt; I am named Melisandre, ser. She alone came unarmored, but for her flowing red robes. At her throat the great ruby drank the daylight. I serve your king, and the Lord of Light.

&gt; I wish you well of them, my lady, Ser Cortnay answered, but I bow to other gods, and a different king.

&gt; There is but one true king, and one true god, announced Lord Florent.

&gt; Are we here to dispute theology, my lord? Had I known, I would have brought a septon.

&gt; You know full well why we are here, said Stannis. You have had a fortnight to consider my offer. You sent your ravens. No help has come. Nor will it. Storms End stands alone, and I am out of patience. One last time, ser, I command you to open your gates, and deliver me that which is mine by rights.

&gt; And the terms? asked Ser Cortnay.

&gt; Remain as before, said Stannis. I will pardon you for your treason, as I have pardoned these lords you see behind me. The men of your garrison will be free to enter my service or to return unmolested to their homes. You may keep your weapons and as much property as a man can carry. I will require your horses and pack animals, however.

&gt; And what of Edric Storm?

&gt; My brothers bastard must be surrendered to me.

&gt; Then my answer is still no, my lord.

&gt; The king clenched his jaw. He said nothing. Melisandre spoke instead. May the Lord of Light protect you in your darkness, Ser Cortnay.

&gt; May the Others bugger your Lord of Light, Penrose spat back, and wipe his arse with that rag you bear.

&gt; Lord Alester Florent cleared his throat. Ser Cortnay, mind your tongue. His Grace means the boy no harm. The child is his own blood, and mine as well. My niece Delena was the mother, as all men know. If you will not trust to the king, trust to me. You know me for a man of honor-

&gt; I know you for a man of ambition, Ser Cortnay broke in. A man who changes kings and gods the way I change my boots. As do these other turncloaks I see before me.

&gt; An angry clamor went up from the kings men. *He is not far wrong*, Davos thought. Only a short time before, the Fossoways, Guyard Morrigen, and the Lords Caron, Varner, Errol, and Estermont had all belonged to Renly. They had sat in his pavilion, helped him make his battle plans, plotted how Stannis might be brought low. And Lord Florent had been with them - he might be Queen Selyses own uncle, but that had not kept the Lord of Brightwater from bending his knee to Renly when Renlys star was rising.

&gt; Bryce Caron walked his horse forward a few paces, his long rainbowstriped cloak twisting in the wind off the bay. No man here is a turncloak, ser. My fealty belongs to Storms End, and King Stannis is its rightful lord... and our true king. He is the last of House Baratheon, Roberts heir and Renlys.

&gt; If that is so, why is the Knight of Flowers not among you? And where is Mathis Rowan? Randyll Tarly? Lady Oakheart? Why are they not here in your company, they who loved Renly best? Where is Brienne of Tarth, I ask you?

&gt; That one? Ser Guyard Morrigen laughed harshly. She ran. As well she might. Hers was the hand that slew the king.

&gt; A lie, Ser Cortnay said. I knew Brienne when she was no more than a girl playing at her fathers feet in Evenfall Hall, and I knew her still better when the Evenstar sent her here to Storms End. She loved Renly Baratheon from the first moment she laid eyes on him, a blind man could see it.

&gt; To be sure, declared Lord Florent airily, and she would scarcely be the first maid maddened to murder by a man who spurned her. Though for my own part, I believe it was Lady Stark who slew the king. She had journeyed all the way from Riverrun to plead for an alliance, and Renly had refused her. No doubt she saw him as a danger to her son, and so removed him.

&gt; It was Brienne, insisted Lord Caron. Ser Emmon Cuy swore as much before he died. You have my oath on that, Ser Cortnay.

&gt; Contempt thickened Ser Cortnays voice. And what is that worth? You wear your cloak of many colors, I see. The one Renly gave you when you swore your oath to protect him. If he is dead, how is it you are not? He turned his scorn on Guyard Morrigen. I might ask the same of you, ser. Guyard the Green, yes? Of the Rainbow Guard? Sworn to give his own life for his kings? If I had such a cloak, I would be ashamed to wear it.

&gt; Morrigen bristled. Be glad this is a parley, Penrose, or I would have your tongue for those words.

&gt; And cast it in the same fire where you left your manhood?

&gt; Enough! Stannis said. The Lord of Light willed that my brother die for his treason. Who did the deed matters not.

&gt; Not to you, perhaps, said Ser Cortnay. I have heard your proposal, Lord Stannis. Now here is mine. He pulled off his glove and flung it in the kings face. Single combat. Sword, lance, or any weapon you care to name. Or if you fear to hazard your magic sword and royal skin against an old man, name you a champion, and I shall do the same. He gave Guyard Morrigen and Bryce Caron a scathing look. Either of these pups would do nicely, I should think.

&gt; Ser Guyard Morrigen grew dark with fury. I will take up the gage, if it please the king.

&gt; As would I Bryce Caron looked to Stannis.

&gt; The king ground his teeth. No.

&gt; Ser Cortnay did not seem surprised. Is it the justice of your cause you doubt, my lord, or the strength of your arm? Are you afraid Ill piss on your burning sword and put it out?

&gt; Do you take me for an utter fool, ser? asked Stannis. I have twenty thousand men. You are besieged by land and sea. Why would I choose single combat when my eventual victory is certain? The king pointed a finger at him. I give you fair warning. If you force me to take my castle by storm, you may expect no mercy. I will hang you for traitors, every one of you.

&gt; As the gods will it. Bring on your storm, my lord; and recall, if you do, the name of this castle. Ser Cortnay gave a pull on his reins and rode back toward the gate.",51,424,False,self,,,,,

1. Jaime and Cersei- I cannot imagine both of them will survive whatever final battle.

2. Missandei and Greyworm- They may live to see Dany rule Westeros. Maybe. 

3. Sam and Gilley- Plucky survivors who might be the last couple standing.

Jon is the prince who was promised, promised to the Others like the bargain made for the Others to retreat when they last came thousands of years ago. The Others have appeared again since Jon was born because he is their promised prince.

Ok here we go...

Azor Ahai is not the same person as the prince who was promised. Dani is not Azor Ahai. Sam is, with Heartsbane becoming lightnbringer by killing (or sacrificing) Dany (the fire and Dany having a thing about standing around in fires). I'm no GRRM so can't put together all the steps that could lead to this but feel to fill in gaps :)

Jon sacrificing himself as the PTWP would end the long night for now, but Azor Ahai will end the Others completely by sacrficing Jon.

Skipping that all the stark children are wargs.
Lady stoneheart.
The sansa/Jane switch.

Most of all, making Barriston Selmy such a minor character when he is such an amazing character in the books.  In the books he gets more plot time than Jorah, and when he is Dannys hand...fair, kind, wise, just, loyal, and during the story he is easily the greatest swordsman in the world despite being an old man, and IMHO has to be top 5 of all time.

Hi!

There are various theories about who will turn out to be Azor Ahai, be it the Hound, Daenerys, Jon, Tyrion or a combination of all the latter three (The Dragon Has Three Heads; Tyrion's father may not be Tywin in some theories).

With this write-up I'm assuming [Azor Ahai](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Azor_Ahai) is Jon. He has consistently fought the White Walkers, he has been resurrected by [R'hllor](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/R%27hllor), Mellisandre favours him (though as we all know, that's no guarantee). His resurrection is the crucial rebirth that has begun to make him Azor Ahai.

Daenerys is coming to Westeros, and will seek allies against the Lannisters. That's Dorne, and the Starks. She already has an ally in Dorne, which leaves the Starks. Both Theon and to a lesser extent Tyrion know the Starks; Theon can vouch for Sansa and Tyrion for Jon. So it's safe to bet that Daenny is going to head up North and meet Jon.

We have already seen that Littlefinger has sown mistrust between Sansa and Jon by bringing into account Jon's bastard status and questioning his loyalty. This is now going to be exacerbated by the fact that Jon has been hailed as King in the North and Sansa has been overlooked despite her tactics, diplomacy and connections with Littlefinger winning them the battle against the Boltons and Karstarks.

When Daenerys and Jon eventually meet, they are going to fall in love; Jon is has a thing for *fiery* spirits and Daenny for warriors. Daenerys is therefore [Nissa Nissa](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Nissa_Nissa).

Yet Daenny has spoken about ""breaking the wheel"", rather than allowing the old Houses to continue. This goes against not only Jon's duty to his family and newfound (self) acceptance as a Stark, but against Sansa (and Littlefinger). Littlefinger will rub salt in this wound, and he and Varys have always been rivals. Hence they get their showdown as their respective Queens end up facing off.

Caught between is Jon, who has always known that the real threat is the White Walkers and not the petty squabbles of noble houses. Hence he will kill Daenerys, in part to protect Sansa, in part to save the realm from further civil war (which he has seen too much of already).

Daenerys (and by extension her blood) have magic fire properties which would be useful in defeating the White Walkers. It also makes sense that any flaming magical sword be made of Valyrian Steel, which is likely made using Dragonfire. By killing Daenerys with [Longclaw](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Longclaw), Jon's becomes Azor Ahai wielding [Lightbringer](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lightbringer).

This makes more sense than Jon falling for his other cousin, Sansa, in part due to the role of magic in fulfilling the prophecy, and also because Littlefinger has and would put the mockers on any growing affection between the Starks.

After that, who knows. I predict Jon will vanquish the darkness (and all remaining magic along with it) and die. The Dragons will either die fighting (at least one is guaranteed to die), or fly off so that we don't feel so bad about yet another extinct magical species.

Littlefinger will most likely finally get his comeuppance, perhaps in a crunching encounter with a dragon, perhaps in his showdown with Varys, which may also result in Varys' death. Less likely is that Littlefinger abandons his ambitions and becomes a Lord.

Which may leave only Sansa and Tyrion remaining in the Game. They will finally marry, ending the old rivalry which began our story between Lannister and Stark. With nobody left to govern Winterfell, Sansa will appoint Theon as Warden of the North as a final acceptance of him into the Stark family and a redemption of his character. The Sand Snakes will likely have died fighting the White Walkers in an botched attempt to inject poignant vitality into a shed snakeskin.

And after that, all will live happily ever after. Assuming they're still alive by the end.


Thank you for reading, this crackpot theory brought to you by /u/EroticBurrito.


EDIT: Side note on [Alt Shift X's Theories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q14AuWiltIw) about Jon and Sansa marrying - Apart from the magic prophecy and Littlefinger issues obstacles raised above, Sansa marrying Tyrion fits with much of Alt's theories about Sansa and Jon. For one, [this sequence](https://youtu.be/q14AuWiltIw?t=60) may be upset if Tyrion is allowed to occur twice *if* he discovers his true parentage to be Targaryen. By extension, Tyrion also has a claim to the throne, which slots into how I predict the series will end. Alt's doubts about incest issues with Jon and Sansa are valid, and it may be a little late for Aegon Targaryen to be introduced as a prospective suitor and ""Third Head"" of the Dragon.

I was just curious how Cersei was able to be crowned queen of the iron throne after what she did. She intentionally killed hundreds, possible thousands of people including mostly people of nobility and you can argue that her actions directly led to the suicide of her son (or that could be accused of killing her son directly even since no one saw it happen.)

How is no one charging her for mass murder? Everyone is just like, oh she blew up a huge part of our city and killed a bunch of people, let's crown her queen, no problem!",22,5,False,self,,,,,
