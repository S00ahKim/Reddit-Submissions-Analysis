I mean, its not like before, when I vouched only for the Starks.

But I also want Ramsay to die, chaos to reign in KL now that Kevan is gone, see what Littlefinger and Sansa will do, what Varys and Illyrio are plotting and what the White Walkers intentions are.

For too long we have tinfoiled theories about who will win the fight for the Iron Throne. We've spent so much time thinking about this that we've discarded the reason we're all here.

Today, we're refocusing the sub on what matters. Hot Pie. Hot Pie, the Un-burnt, First of His Name, Lord of the Direwolf Cookies is the one glimmer of hope in a dark and cruel world.  

Today, we begin discussion on baking pies, eating pies, hot pies, cold pies, Hot Pie, and anything else you can think of related to Hot Pie.

We hope you can all embrace the new direction of the sub.

Sincerely,

The Mod Team

For me its:  
3. Littlefinger  
Just having been the main cause of the majority of the events in the books makes him intriguing. When it seems he's not up to anything for a while he suddenly kills off a few major characters to further his goals.    
2. Theon  
Everything theon has been up to since he left Robbs warhost has been interesting. Especially love his 'ghost of winterfell' plot and cant wait to see him trapped between Ramsey and Stannis' battle in the next book.  
1. Stannis Baratheon  
Obviously not the most likable character but everthing he does and everyone he associates with makes him, for me, the most interesting character going plotwise. Nobody is more deserving of the iron throne than Stannis with Davos and Melisandre firmly at his side.   
  
  
Notable mentions: Varys - saving tyrion, killing off lannisters. 'Griff' - bringing the true heir home. Martells and Greyjoys in general - really hope they portray them well in the show!",29,21,False,self,,,,,

Section 1: looking at [this page of characters](http://imgur.com/xGyYfGC), answer these questions:

1. How many have been with a naked man, in love scene? 
2. How many are currently dead? 
3. How many are blood relatives (marriage doesnt count) to another on this sheet? 
4. How many said they have a claim to the Throne at some point? 

Section 2: Listen to the epitaphs on this tombstone, and tell me who the character was:

1. Here lies our dear old dad | Put his neck on the line, lost all he had.
2. The pie is dry, bring me my wine!

I chose the winner of the contest by sticking to a Game of Thrones theme. /u/CargoCulture wins the prize by sending me this (http://i.imgur.com/HSbgKoc.gifv) of JL saying ""Nice""!  There were other great entries, but in the end, this one made me laugh when I opened it and I just really like it. Going to send my PM now to the winner and again, thanks to everyone who took the time to send me something.





Hello fellow Redditors,
I was given S1 - S4 of GOT on Blu Ray by a friend of mine. They are new in the box, and still in the sealed wrapper. I have watched all of the seasons on TV, and to be honest, I'll never end up watching these disks. I don't even have a player hooked up in my house. I considered selling them, but for some reason it bothered me to think about selling something that I was given. I know that there has to be someone on this subreddit or another that might really like these disks, so I've decided to pay it forward a little bit and give them away. To do that, I made this throwaway account and I'd like to have a small contest for them.

PM a picture to me, a message, a link - really just PM me *anything* and on Tuesday, April 7th - I'll pick my favorite reply, PM you, and mail you all 4 of the Blu Ray packages completely free of charge.

No catch, no strings, no anything - just trying to give someone something nice.

Edit: Pics of the disks: http://imgur.com/CpTDAMK

Good luck!

This was something that I overlooked my first time around, but upon hearing this with what knowledge of the show I have now, I thought deeper of it.

I'm fairly certain this doesn't mean Margaery holds her husband above all others simply because of how quickly we see her move onto a new, more profitable husband. So what I think the deeper meaning behind this is that this is our first glimpse into the conniving ambitions of the Tyrells. This doesn't mean that Margaery sees whomever her husband might be as some king above all, but her husband is always a king.

My question is, what happened with the rest of Robb's bannermen? Surely they would have attacked the Twins after the events of the wedding, no? Or am I forgetting something? Roose betrays Robb, reveals he is with the Lannisters, and then takes the north without opposition? It is entirely possible that this is the premise of the rest of the books for the northern houses, but I had to ask because we went an entire season without an answer, and based on the trailers for Season 5 it seems like Stannis is his new opposer whereas it was the Greyjoys in 4.

I'm writing a college paper for a storytelling and morality class, and the professor thought GoT would be a good choice for some critical study. I decided that I was particularly interested in the morality of sympathizing or empathizing with morally questionable characters (certain plenty of characters in GoT to choose from there). Specifically, I'll be looking at Jaime Lannister's arc, between the point that he pushes Brann out the window, to when his hand it cut off (and maybe a little bit after that). I think most viewers sympathize with Jaime when his hand is lopped off, which is fascinating when you consider how screwed up his character is. What scenes between those two most define his arc?

**TL;DR** What scenes most define Jaime?

Bonus: I think I might do a study on Arya as well, who moves in the opposite direction, from morally ideal to very questionable, so if feel free to throw in scenes for her.

Thanks for your input, everyone!

I would prefer to watch in HD and to have the option to watch it on catch-up if I cant make it to see the episode at the time, I'm not sure if NowTV provides this or not. I think Sky does but thats crazy expensive and I will be moving in a few weeks so buying a 12 month subscription to anything at this stage is pointless.

I will add links below in **bold** as people reply:

**United Kingdom**

[**NowTV 6.99/mo**](http://www.nowtv.com/entertainment/gameofthrones) N.B. /u/ptdaisy333 says to be careful with devices you activate or you will have to watch it all on your phone. /u/seperationsunday points out that there is a free trial. I have checked and that's 30days so potentially all of GoT can be viewed for 6.99??? Can anyone confirm? [**Edit: find out if your device will play in HD here**](http://help.nowtv.com/article/Streaming-Quality) Looks like if you use their app on a windows 8 machine or Apple TV/roku box or a console you can get 720p, otherwise its SD for mac/win7/linux peeps.

[**Sky Atlantic /Sky Go**](http://www.sky.com/tv/show/game-of-thrones) I used this last year but the quality wasn't great - perhaps because we didn't have Sky HD? I think sky own NowTV as well so I don't think the quality will be any different between the two. Obviously if you have Sky in your household then this, or watching as it's broadcast is the best option.

As the massively popular HBO series *Game of Thrones* nears the premiere of its fifth season, we would like to spread awareness of another, more narrowly focused subreddit: /r/PureAsoiaf.


With the new episodes airing, discussion of television show content will be popping up more often and in wider circles than it has in previous months. The difference this time, is that the new episodes are increasingly likely to contain unreleased content from future novels. We acknowledge that there is a huge range of fans, some of whom wish to discuss the show and the books separately. We also know that there are many fans who will temporarily abstain from watching the show, for fear of TWOW spoilers.


Whether you are watching this season or not, we would love to have you participate over at /r/PureAsoiaf. The golden rule is simply no TV show discussion. Come share your love of the books with us!

Hello everyone. I have in the name of science looked over the various armor worn in game of thrones to see if it is any good or not. Compare it to medieval Europe and see what could be done better and/or changed. I am not one to draw out on things, so lets get started.


(3000 word essay incoming)


First, lets get some facts out of the way. 
Game of thrones is set in a fictional world, but one that very, very closely reassembles medieval Europe. However, the middle ages lasted for roughly a thousand years (500-1500 AD give or take). So which part is it set in? Well, I'd argue that it is the very late medieval period. Mainly because of how their armor looks. The type that Ser Hugh wears ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8_fWvHo8LY ) is called gothic armor. 

This is pretty much as good as armor got back then. Sure, there were other designs (maximillian, for instance) that perhaps was even more protective, but by that point gunpowder weapons were starting to appear an masse. For instance, it is said that  several hundreds of hand cannons were present at the battle of Towton(1461).

Why does any of that matter? Because consistency is key. It means that because Ser Hugh had that armor, it means that the blacksimths of Westeros knows how to make that kinds of armor, and they have the capabilities of forging such large pieces of metal like full breastplates. 

It also means that; if the knights would be wearing full plate armor, the man-at-arms would be wearing metal armor too, just not 100% covering.

So! Lets get started.

(if you see any weird words of armor parts below. http://www.medievalwarfare.info/photos/360x485xparts.gif.pagespeed.ic.qpyt0f9dV3.jpg )

STARKS!
http://imagizer.imageshack.us/a/img854/3002/starkmen.jpg
http://imagizer.imageshack.us/a/img705/770/starkshield.jpg

The first thing that I noticed was the fact that the soldiers were wearing very sensible headgear. The helmet in question is called bascinet, 

and was good, solid helmet. It was after all the most popular helmet during the 14th and the first half of the 15th century. So far so good. The lack of any other metal on their bodies does however suggest that these soldiers are quite poor. Conscripted peasants probably. Which makes sense since the north is quite poor in the books. 

Now they are also wearing those leather coats. These would be called cuir bouilli, or boiled leather. And yes, those existed. However I have never seen one, so I can't tell the accuracy of the look of them. I do know however that a simple aketon or a gambeson (Which does show up later) would both be cheaper and look more fitting. And plus you could get some colour in there, since all the armor in this show seems to be either black, brown or gray.

So from an historical perspective, these guys does not look too shabby. I guess there is room to point out that they repeatedly state that the ""north has almost no knights."" Which is very interesting. That to me says that they have little to no heavy infantry, and no heavy cavalry. 

They are poor and the land is scarcely populated. I wonder how they managed to carve out such a huge part of Westeros for themselves.

Robb stark
http://images6.fanpop.com/image/photos/33900000/Robb-Stark-robb-stark-33976864-3356-2334.jpg

Now, this is where problems come in. The KING in the north, is wearing pretty much the same armor as his peasant army? No, not ok. You mean to tell me that the guy that is the lord of more than 50% of westeros wears leather into combat? Get outta here.

First off that gorget. Holy balls that thing is huge. Now, a gorget is the piece of metal that is supposed to protect the gap between the breastplate and the neck. now this ( http://i.imgur.com/A9ReOpk.jpg ) is a more reasonable size. One must also ask, why is he wearing a gorget in the first place, if he has no breastplate? He also decided that it was smart to get some huge pauldrons, a set of couters and vambraces ... but no gauntlets. Interesting. I guess his arms are more vital than his head or chest. Groan.

Oh and notice that the leather has rivets in it? .... ? Is he wearing a brigandine? No, no he is not. Minus ten points to house stark.

2/10  Also the tang of his sword is showing through the pommel. So is tang of the sword of the guy behind him.

KARSTARKS
http://imagizer.imageshack.us/a/img194/681/karstarkmen.jpg

So, the main difference here is that these guys are wearing gambesons instead of leather. They also have bevors and a minimal amount of chainmail. Same thing here with the bevor as with the gorget. You wouldn't bother with it unless you had the actual armor first. Common soldiers bought breastplates for their first months salary, not bevors. It's like buying an red-dot sight to a gun before you buy a gun. Not very practical.

Lord Karstark
http://imagizer.imageshack.us/a/img203/2283/lordkarstark.jpg

I don't even remember this guys name. He looks like a peasant, like all the other northerners. But he looks even poor-er than the standard soldiers. Is he like the Westeros equivalent of Diogenes?

HOUSE LANCASTER
I MEAN LANNISTER. HONEST.
http://www.justdubrovnik.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Game-of-Thrones-3-1024x680.jpg

First off the bat I must say that the armor looks rather good, I like it. The breastplates are actually rather decently shaped, and the pauldrons aren't comically oversized. The helmet looks pretty realistic, closest thing would be some far eastern helmet, perhaps like the Japanese ones. Though the lack of bevor would leave the throat and jaw vulnerable.  Although why they aren't wearing arming jackets underneath is beyond me. However, no other character wears one either, so. ^_^

These guys have very superior armor to the Starks, plate armor is after all almost invulnerable to both sword thrusts and slashes, and since everyone and their mother uses swords in Westeros, they're well off.

PAPA LANNISTER
http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20150209103216/villains/images/4/4d/Tywinfullarmor.jpg

Another case of rich lord wearing the same armor as his troops. Not to mention HE'S THE RICHEST MAN IN WESTEROS. Why isn't he covered from head to toe in gold? Something like this  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Medieval_armour_Vienna_museum.jpg
or in the very least case this http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/19.131.1,2

The lion armor in leeds is pretty cool too, and would be an amazing fit for him. ""Oh but muh budget"" &gt;:(

KINGSGUARD
http://imagizer.imageshack.us/a/img842/7030/kingsguardshield.jpg
http://imagizer.imageshack.us/a/img42/1756/kingsguardthrone.jpg

The choice of scales here is interesting. I mean, they have a breastplate, so why bother with the scales for things that chainmail can cover? And the chainmail can go on the unprotected parts, like armpits. These guys are supposed to be the kings personal guards. The guys that are 

supposed to stand between the king and everything else. So why does their armor have gaps in it? Huge, glaring gaps. Their entire arms are unprotected, so is throat, and no doubt legs. And also their helmets is quite a weird choice. It's obviously inspired by Corinthian styled helmets, or barbutas if you wanna push it. But those were very, very tight fits, while their helmets are loose. And their entire faces are showing. One good arrow and they're done for. Also those combs on the top and sides of the helmet makes it worse if it was to take a blow. 
 
Aesthetically it looks kinda cool, I do admit. Though I wish they would have stuck to a closer look to the books, with more white showing instead of gold. 

Sandor Clegane 
http://cinedork.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/the-hound1.jpg

First thing that caught my attention was the thing that is covering is chest. What on earth is that? if it was a brigandine type situation going on then it wouldn't be divided into stripes. It looks like it's just studded leather, which is (quite frankly) crap when it compares to plate. And the studs won't help much considering how small they are. The rest of his armor consists of plate, so why not bother with it on his chest, HM!?!?!? God that is annoying. Even more annoying considering that it's a running theme with the show. They should boot their costume designer.

Other than that, not bad. He should spend some time cleaning it and getting a blacksmith to hammer out those dents in it. Oh and he should get another helmet for battlefield use.

Gregor Clegane
http://splay.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/oberyn-kontra-gra-3.png

http://24.media.tumblr.com/18297bccf53c6e1ddc0daf22896c0699/tumblr_n6j5dbR15t1r9h4heo5_1280.jpg

BAWHAHAHAHAHHWHAHAHAAHAHAHA. Ahem. Sorry. I couldn't help it. He's wearing a black-painted trashcan on his head. And no, that is not a great helm. They did not look like that. However a great helm would look pretty rad on him.

As for the armor. Looks like a mishmash of a bunch of stuff, which is interesting. Plate, chainmail, gambeson, leather. I'm confused. Also I see that they couldn't resist the temptation to make his armor black. Cause duh, badguy. http://www.swordsandarmor.com/images/AR007BK_Black_Knight.jpg There. Much better.


HOUSE TULLY

http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130823183541/gameofthrones/images/1/1a/Edmure-tully-shootingarrows.jpg

Leather scale armor?

No. And no. The blackfish knows it's shit, so he decided to use chainmail underneath as the real protection. Replace it with a tabard instead.

HOUSE ARRYN
http://imagizer.imageshack.us/a/img21/7021/valeguard2.jpg

BAWAHAHAHAHAHA-  No. No laughing. 

Ok. I like the fact that he is wearing proper armor, or well, part of one. However it's comically big, waaaaaaaaaay to big. And it's not shaped like a proper breastplate. I see that they also went with the Stark helmet. Nothing wrong with that, always nice to see decent helmets in movies. He's even wearing a coif of mail under it, bravo! However, I do not like the fact that his pauldrons are made of cloth, though. 

And why is the gaoler wearing chainmail? Is he expecting to be attacked? A gambeson would provide better protection against blunt trauma.


Ser Vardis Egen
http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130126143838/gameofthrones/images/3/32/Vardis_profile.jpg

You guys see that right? Right? RIGHT!? Spiked armor. Disqualified.
Also who uses a kite shield for a duel? Please. Use a round one, or a heater.

Actually scratch that. Who uses a shield in a duel when he's wearing plate armor, against an opponent who does not use missiles? He could have ditched it, grabbed a poleaxe and fucked over Bronn bigtime.
....

I like his helmet tho.

HOUSE GAYJOY
http://img441.imageshack.us/img441/522/greyjoymen.jpg

...uhm...uhm...uhm. Fine, if no one will ask the question, I will.
Why are their breastplates covered in shit? LOOK AT THEM! THEY'RE BROWN!
Are these the supposed sea raiders that rose in rebellion and terrorized whole western coast?
Not very intimidating are they? They look poor-er than the Starks that's saying something considering that these guys wear metal.  Also, if 

these guys need to ""pay the iron price"" for everything, why isn't their armor varying? They can't all have accidentally stumbled across copies of the same armor during raiding...right?

Theon Greyjoy
http://imagizer.imageshack.us/a/img826/6986/greyjoyarmor.jpg

Did he go swimming in shit and forget to clean his armor? LOOK AT THAT THING!!
Holy balls, that thing is dirtier than Sasha grey. Why is there a theme of using
dirty and battered armor in Westeros? Is rust not a thing there? Also I am pretty
sure that is the same  dagger that Robb is using.


Yara Greyjoy
http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20131003215834/gameofthrones/images/3/3c/YaraS3.jpg

She suffers from the same thing that Theon does. Unclean, unkept armor.
Also her breastplate is all kinds of wrong. A breastplate is formed so that
blows are supposed to slide off it, to make them glance. However if you make one
that forms to breasts, it totally defeats the point of it. Those would absorb
the blow instead of force it to glance away. Seriously, physics 101.

http://25.media.tumblr.com/b593025daa59b3f8e04fd1937dfd6ae9/tumblr_mhz3ohFUGc1rcq9lto2_1280.jpg
And girls can wear armor just fine, the breasts won't be in the way. Unless they're really, really big
I guess. But then if that was the case, I wouldn't advice in a career as a solider.

They brought coats, good. It's cold in the north, ask Napoleon/Charles XII/Hitler.

I see some breastplates here, which is nice, however other than that and helmets, there is a 
distinct lack of armor. Davos seems to have gone to the Stark school of armoring himself and went only
with a oversized gorget for protection. I am also curious why they decided to go with burgonet styled helmets for their troops. Don't get me wrong, it's a bitchin' helmet, but totally out of place for the time setting.

Stannis on the other hand is wearing a transitional armor. This type was used just before full-scale 
plate armor was being used. You can see big plates on his armor, but the rest is chainmail.
This is a real, historically sound armor. They were developed into coat of plates/brigandines after and
you can see these in painting around the time of the 100 years war. http://www.maidofheaven.com/maid_assets/extras/battle_crecy.jpg

Overall, yeah, I like it. Historical and good, just wrong time period.

Nice to see different styles of helmets on troops. However the usage of plate pauldrons and gambesons is a sore sight. If they could afford any metal at all, it would be a munitions cuirass (after the helmet.) Considering that the lancasters have plate armor, it's no wonder that Stannis lost the battle of blackwater.

OH MAWH GAWD! A proper brigandine, finally! Or as proper as they're gonna get in GoT. I like it. Not really fit for a king, but it looks nice and is functional. I don't like the golden pauldrons though, as not even mr.papa Lannister could afford that.  Also lack of leg armor is real.

It's our favorite time of year. The pies are hot, the ale is strong, and the Dornish wine is sweet. With the season 5 premiere coming up this weekend, we just wanted to post a little reminder about the rules for some of the newer folks, and maybe some of the veteran posters who forget themselves.

~~**The first rule of the sub is you don't talk about the sub**~~ **The first rule of the sub is basically just don't be a jerk.**

This includes:

- Spoiling stuff
- Being rude or posting inflammatory, bigoted, or trolly remarks to people
- Belittling people for only reading the books or only watching the show
- Sexually objectifying actors/actresses or other Redditors

A better overview of the rules can be found on the **[Posting Policy](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/wiki/posting_policy)** for the subreddit.

______________________________________________________________________

**Next up: Piracy**

This sub does not condone promotion of pirated streams, torrents, or other illegal ways to watch or own the show, books, or games. Any links to pirated material or discussion of sources to pirated material will be met with a ban. Basically... if you do it, keep it to yourself.

______________________________________________________________________

**The other major thing to go over is the** ***[Spoiler Policy](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/wiki/spoiler_guide).***

As a reminder, all posted threads to the subreddit need to have a bracketed scope at the front of the post. This consists of two parts: a required main scope and an optional expansion scope. I won't go into detail here, but if you follow the link for the spoiler policy above, you can read over it to make sure you don't accidentally spoil anything here.

Here's the table representing how to tag what:

_______________________________________________________________________
**Please note that most rule infractions are met with an instant ban from the mod team**. During the season, there's a lot of traffic on the sub and we don't get an opportunity to warn people in comments nearly as much as we did in the off-season. We also get our fair share of troll accounts and can't always tell the trolls from real users who have made a mistake. As a result, bans are handed out swiftly and without reservation. If you get banned and you would like to appeal it, I'd recommend looking over the posted **[Ban Policy](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/wiki/bans)** and following the instructions laid out there.

I'd like to discuss the conversation in its entirety really.

Just finished a rewatch of the entire series thus far for the second time now, but something I've never understood was the 'chaos is a ladder' conversation that Littlefinger has with Varys. The more I've watched, the more I've been paying attention to Littlefinger and the more he's becoming a *must watch* character for me, super interesting. Someone mentioned this speech in another thread which reminded me that I never really understood it. Hopefully we can discuss the speech here and what it says about Littlefinger as a character. Here it is in it's entirety:

------------------------------------------
**Lord Varys**: A thousand blades, taken from the hands of Aegon's fallen enemies. Forged in the fiery breath of Balerion the Dread.

**Petyr 'Littlefinger' Baelish**: There aren't a thousand blades. There aren't even two hundred. I've counted.

**Lord Varys**: Heh. I'm sure you have. Ugly old thing.

**Petyr 'Littlefinger' Baelish**: It has a certain appeal.

**Lord Varys**: The Lysa Arryn of chairs. Shame you had to settle for your second choice.

**Petyr 'Littlefinger' Baelish**: Early days, my friend. It is flattering really, you feeling such dread at the prospect of me getting what I want.

**Lord Varys**: Thwarting you has never been my primary ambition, I promise you. Although, who doesn't like to see their friends fail now and then.

**Petyr 'Littlefinger' Baelish**: You're so right. For instance, when I thwarted your plan to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells, if I'm going to be honest, I did feel an unmistakable sense of enjoyment there. But your confidant, the one who fed you information about my plans, the one you swore to protect... you didn't bring her any enjoyment, and she didn't bring me any enjoyment. She was a bad investment on my part. Luckily, I have a friend who wanted to try something new. Something daring. And he was so grateful to me for providing this fresh experience.

**Lord Varys**: I did what I did for the good of the realm.

**Petyr 'Littlefinger' Baelish**: The realm. Do you know what the realm is? It's the thousand blades of Aegon's enemies, a story we agree to tell each other over and over, until we forget that it's a lie.

**Lord Varys**: But what do we have left, once we abandon the lie? Chaos? A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all.

**Petyr 'Littlefinger' Baelish**: Chaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder. Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again. The fall breaks them. And some, are given a chance to climb. They refuse, they cling to the realm or the gods or love. Illusions. Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is.

--------------------------------
I mean *clearly* there's a lot going on here, but it's the extremely subtle stuff that intrigues me. However feel free to discuss it in whatever capacity you guys and girls like :). 

As of season 5 we're only going to bear witness to the continuing climb of Petyr Baelish, so to break down this dialogue would do a lot to get an insight into the inner workings of his mind.

This poison works very quickly and it is obvious that the target was poisoned since they start bleeding out of their eyes, mouth, nose, etc. But my question why didn't they chose to use for example, the tears of Lys? This poison would have still killed Joffrey (which was their plan) but it would have been more discrete. It would have made it seem that Joffrey was suffering a bad fever (leaving no one to blame). Sure it would have taken longer for him to die, but I see this as more of a benefit for the Tyrells. Because it would have given Joffrey enough time to consummate the marriage with Margaery, making it clear that Margaery is the queen even after his death.

Also, I said No Spoilers since I want this to be mainly speculation, but feel free to post spoilers on the books as long as you label them. In fact, I am not gonna have replies for this post go to my inbox. Anyway, so it has been stated that people still alive in the books are gonna die in Season 5. So I was thinking, could we see the other way around? Could we see people that die in the books stay alive, if not forever, at least a little while longer? I have not read the books (well, I am right now, STILL on AGOT) So I don't know if this has been done before. But could it happen? It's done in The Walking Dead. I read the first 10 volumes of The Walking Dead comic, and I won't say specifically who, but some people who die in the comics are still alive in the show, at least for now. Also, some people that are still alive in the comics die in the show. 

So, do you think people dead in the books could survive the show? At least for a little while longer? If it has been done before, let me know. I guess we are gonna keep this primarily focused on AFFC and ADWD, since that's where we are at now.   ",6,7,False,self,,,,,

However, I'm not entirely clear on what that means. 

So if I have read and finished the series all the way up to the end of A Dance with Dragons (I'm almost done actually, I have 300 pages left), will watching season 5 of the show spoil content that will be in the next book(s) (The Winds of Winter and A Dream of Spring)? Or will it be season 6 that spoils book stuff assuming TWOW doesn't come out before season 6? 

Some clarity would be great so I can decided whether or not I should watch the upcoming season 5 episodes. Thanks!",4,8,False,self,,,,,

The question is always: ""how did you convince GRRM to let you make the show?"" and their answer always involves them meeting George at a hotel, him eating a big steak slathered in butter, and then finally asking D&amp;D: ""who is Jon Snow's REAL mother?"" They gave him their best guess and obviously he was pleased. Now for anyone who hasn't started the series, or hasn't delved too deep into it yet, isn't that kind of a big spoiler? The issue of Jon's true parentage it seems has been floated around amongst fans for years but in terms of the show it hasn't even been considered, and I haven't read the books so I don't even know if that has been brought up yet in the literary storyline (and I haven't dug too deep, spoilers and whatnot but I'm aware of the popular theory, R+L). Is it just not as big of a deal as I thought it was if they are willing to throw out a potential spoiler as big as that, almost consistently? Or do you think they have the mindset of ""you know what? If people are gonna ask the same thing every time, we're not pulling punches"". If anyone has any feedback I'd be keen to hear it. Thanks for reading, can't wait for Sunday.",20,10,False,self,,,,,

EXT. CLIFFS OF PYKE NIGHT

An old man in gray crosses a bridge to a keep, but the bridge snaps and he falls into the darkness of the ocean waves.

EXT. OCEAN SHORE  DAY

The bow of a longship crashes onto shore.  The plate armor boot of a man steps into the sand as waves crash onto the beach.

MUSIC of war drums fades in.  Camera slowly pans up on the boot to reveal a bloody axe and a shield displaying the sigil of the Greyjoys of Pyke.

CUT

INT. SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER  DAY

CERSEI (smirking): So Balon Greyjoy is finally dead.  It was only a matter of time before the squid would be put in his place.  Their small rebellion is over, a fly that just needed to be swat. 

PYCELLE: Im afraid that the threat is not over.  Lord Balons Great Kraken and the warships of the Iron Fleet were made for battle, not for raids. They are the equal of our lesser war galleys in speed and strength, and most are better crewed and captained. The ironmen live their whole lives at sea.

CUT

EXT. DEEPWOOD MOTTE  NIGHT

YARA GREYJOY and her partner, TRISTIFER BOTLEY lay in bed together.

BOTLEY: You cannot go back, Yara.  We should escape to Essos and live a life of reaving together.  There is no place for you back on Pyke.

YARA: Pyke is the only place for me.  I will take my fathers seat, as he intended, on the Seastone Chair.

BOTLEY: But what of your uncles?

CUT

EXT. OCEAN SHORE  DAY

Camera continues to pan up, revealing the kraken helmet of VICTARION GREYJOY, lord captain of the Iron Fleet.  WAR DRUMS intensify.


CUT
INT. PYKE  DAY

VICTARION GREYJOY enters the throne room only to see another comfortably sitting the Seastone Chair

EURON CROWS EYE: Welcome back home brother.  Are you here for my coronation?

CUT

EXT. LORDSPORT  DAY

YARA: My uncle thinks he can come and take my thrown?

IRONBORN CAPTAIN: Your throne?  No woman can lead the Ironborn!

YARA: We should be working together, Uncle, not letting the Crows Eye steal away my birthright!

CUT TO BLACK

PROPHETIC VOICE-OVER:  No godless man may sit the Seastone Chair!

CUT

INT. PYKE DAY

EURON sits the Seastone Chair with a woman on his lap.  YARA, VICTARION, and AERON are before him.

EURON: Godless? Why, Aeron, I am the godliest man ever to raise sail! You serve one god, but I have served ten thousand. From Ib to Asshai, when men see my sails, they pray.

CUT

EXT. OCEAN SHORE  SUNSET

AERON DAMPHAIR wades in the water before a large crowd.

AERON: Listen! Listen to the waves! Listen to the god! He is speaking to us, and he says, We shall have no king but from the kingsmoot!

CUT

Montage of reaving, death, and ironborn cheering for kings, all while EURON speaks over.

EURON: We are the ironborn, and once we were conquerors. Our writ ran everywhere the sound of the waves was heard. My brother would have be content with the cold and dismal north, my niece with even less ... but I shall give you Lannisport. Highgarden. The Arbor. Oldtown. The riverlands and the Reach, thekingswood and the rainwood, Dorne and the marches, the Mountains of the Moon and the Vale of Arryn, Tarth and the Stepstones. I say we take it all! I say, we take Westeros.

CUT

GAME OF THRONE logo comes to forefront.

CUT TO BLACK

VICTARION: There is no wine so sweet as wine taken from a foe. One day I shall drink your wine, Crows Eye, and take from you all that you hold dear.

In a twist of events we discover that is was his wife, Lysa Arryn at the request of Little Finger that poisoned Jon.

I'm a bit confused. Did Petyr set the whole thing up? - Jon finding the book, discovering the truth about Joff, Jon's Murder, Eddard becoming hand, Lanister and Stark going to war.

Was any of this coincidence? Was Jon even asking about the book or Robert's bastards OR was that a Balish lie to steer Eddard after he had Lysa kill Jon?

Any clarification on the matter would be greatly appreciated.

What do you think?


""Perseverance is Key

	Imagine yourself in an actual warzone, caught in the chaos and crossfire of combat, encountering catastrophes out of your immediate control. This frightening thought is a true reality, that many people have in fact experienced themselves. The intense emotions that can occur from witnessing this can force one to give up in all aspects of fighting alongside their troops, losing sight as to why they are there in the first place. Now imagine receiving a bad grade from a recent exam, feeling that rush of failure and worthlessness, making you contemplate wanting to continue in your academic desires.  You are in essence feeling that you are losing a personal battle, one that is chaotic and intense.  With the majority of us in college experiencing at least the second one, its easy for us to want to escape periodically and to give in to the feeling that our battle is lost, giving up on our perseverance.  Once we give up our perseverance in college, like in war, our personal battle is no doubt lost.  The argument for perseverance, addressing troops not wanting to continue a challenging battle, is prevalent within a brief video clip from the series, Game of Thrones. Its within this setting, of people losing faith, feeling that ounce of failure and worthlessness, losing sight as to why they are their in the first place, that encourages Tyrion Lannister, a commanding officer within this video clip, to deliver a powerful, persuasive speech to the losing troops within his command. Within his delivery, he argues that hope is still available as long as you persevere, aggressively fighting as one unit. 
	The video clip begins with the losing troops arguing at one another in an enclosed fortification, knowing that they are outnumbered and realizing that losing the Battle, known as the Battle of Blackwater, is near in sight. This constant arguing about surrendering conveys Tyrion Lannister, a royal dwarf within the kingdom and the current official in command, to exceed all expectations by delivering a persuasive, yet argumentative speech that encourages an eventful rising to the challenge within this depressed audience of the losing troops. In Tyrion Lannisters speech, his overall purpose is to persuade his troops in fighting alongside him in the ongoing battle, even if the numbers dont correlate with a victory. He begins his speech, by shouting over the confronting men expressing to them that although he is half a man, referring to his dwarfism, he still has more guts than each of them individually as a whole man. Ignoring the shouts opposing his claim, he continues with his delivery by enforcing that they need to reevaluate their misconceptions as to why they were fighting in the first place, and for whom they are fighting for in this battle. He conveys in a powerful line, Dont fight for honor, dont fight for glory, and dont fight for riches, because you wont get any. Following this statement, he enforces that they need to fight for survival purposes. In doing this he lists facts and possible examples of what Stannis, the leader of the opposing kingdom, is capable of doing to them and their loved ones if they give up the battle and he then fully gets through their protective barriers. By then, Tyrion has the audience within his grasp, and closes his argument with slight humor in his final call to action. He closes, There are brave men ramming our walls, lets go kill them! 
  With it being obvious, through the content of his speech delivery, that he wants to win the battle and to gain support, this argument can also appeal to a much broader audience than the losing troops itself. Generally, because of its universal theme of perseverance, this speech can reach within the emotions and grasp the views of the young adults, and adults viewing the clip who have contemplated giving up in some fashion in their own personal battles. His argument of fighting together as one unit, never giving up, and continued perseverance can apply to a broad audience, reflecting this overall theme. His conveying tone and vivid presumptions, statement of his royal and handicapped background, and claim of an incidents occurring within the battlefield itself, reflect his use of pathos, ethos, and logos throughout his delivery. Because of his strategic use of these rhetorical tools, his argument of troops needing to pick themselves up in order to successfully win the battle deems effective. 
	Tyrion Lannister successfully plays with the art of Pathos within his speech delivery among the troops through his use of tone and vivid presumptions. Throughout the entire speech, he uses an aggressive tone that plays with the troops emotions, brings clarity to their personal cause, gains support and motivates them. For instance, when he yells towards the end of his delivery, There is another way out, I am going to show you! and Who is with me?! is a powerful line of leadership as he helps them to face their fears. The way in which he raises his voice in these two phrases, allows the audience to feel a sense of awareness and empowerment. This contrasts with the beginning phrases within his speech, as he delivers in a much quieter tone. The clear response of their shouting in support shows that his aggressive tone was effective in displaying a rise of supportive emotions from the troops. Having this tone generate this amount of responsiveness compared to the quieter tone in his opening phrases, demonstrates that Tyrion used this element of Pathos effectively. 
In addition to his aggressive tone, Tyrion also states to the troops, This is your city Stannis means to sack, your gate he is ramming, your houses he will burn, and your women he will rape! Having this clear statement visualizing the experiences of what might happen, with his repetitive use of your can also demonstrate Tyrions effective use of pathos. Having this powerful image of what might happen to the troops if they give up, phrased explicitly in words, can form a sense of realism and clarity. Obviously, hearing anyone explain to you that all of your belongings and loved ones will be hurt or hindered if you fail to do something, can be dramatically frightening, and is apparent on the faces among the troops. Successfully, Tyrion states this and generates more support in his argument of fighting along side him, because no one, after all, wants those graphic presumptions occurring to them to become a reality. Also, within this quote, his strategic use of repetition on the word your adds to the overall flow within his speech, and creates an opening for the momentum of purpose. This parallelism allows Tyrion to motivate the audience even further, targeting each person as an individual, rather than as a whole. In stating this, he points to individuals, supporting that, yes, in fact it can happen to your houses, your gate, your city, and your women. The way Tyrion enforces an aggressive tone and states vivid presumptions within his speech, allows the use of pathos to be effectively be built and displayed throughout his delivery, adding to the effectiveness of his overall argument that hope is present as long as you persevere. 
In successfully demonstrating Pathos, Tyrion also conveys a substantial amount of ethos within his delivery, adding to his credibility in obtaining a successful, persuasive argument. In doing this emphasizes his royal and handicapped background. For example he shouts, They say Im half a man, but what does that make the lot of you! as he stays and his troops are leaving, arguing, and facing in the clear opposite direction of where Tyrion stands as they begin to give up the battle. By this statement, Tyrion is demonstrating that he represents more bravery and perseverance because he is still standing and prepared to fight, instead of leaving like the rest of them. In doing this, he relates to his size, implying that, although hindered in society, he can still be brave in battle. This then establishes credibility for Tyrion among his troops. By stating that he is handicapped, and that he has thus waged his own personal battles successfully, he can show that hope is not lost when you persevere, which allows the troops to see Tyrion as person of great courage and integrity, and a leader for whom to follow. They can now see him as an example of his own argument, because he is actively participating in his own claims, and stepping forward persevere with them. 
Once Tyrion gathers the troops to his attention and continues with his speech, one of the troops in the crowd quickly asks him about what the plan of action is to get onto the battlefield, around the enemy ramming the gates. In response Tyrion says, There is another way to the battlefield, I will show you! With this phrase, Tyrion demonstrates that he knows the works of his own kingdom. In this way Tyrion tells them that he can show them a hidden, alternate passageway to the battlefield, establishing an additional aspect of his credibility. His troops can now understand that Tyrion is a skillful commander who knows what he is doing, and thus they are more likely to follow under his command and persevere because of this response.  In addition to this, his response implied that he is indeed royal and has the credibility of official position. By telling them that he can show a hidden passageway, he reminds the troops that Tyrion is royal and that he knows the secrets of the kingdom that only royalty can obtain, extending that aspect of credibility to an even further extent. With Tyrions emphasis on his royal and handicapped background, he successfully uses ethos to establish a credible role among the troops as he enables them to turn around to face the battle in following under his command and persevering. 
Lastly, Tyrion effectively demonstrates logos in his speech by stating a fact that is currently occurring in the predicaments appealing to his argument. For instance, as Tyrion states, There are brave men knocking at our door, lets go kill them! there are ramming noises occurring in the background that proves the fact these enemies are indeed knocking at our door as he is presenting. Although they hear the ramming, the troops can then realize, by Tyrions words, that there city is going to be destroyed if they dont do something. Sometimes having someone have an occurrence directly told to you in harsh clear wording instead of hovering around in your thoughts, can put your attitudes for perseverance into perspective. 
Through his conveying tone and vivid presumptions, statement of his royal and handicapped background, and claims of an immediate incident occurring within the battlefield itself, effectively analyzed through rhetorical devices, enables Tyrion Lannister to successfully deliver a powerful argument that deems effective among the losing troops of the Battle of Blackwater. Perseverance is an aspect that can be demonstrated in all aspects of life. Whether it is turning around from walking away in a battlefield setting, or studying even harder on the next exam, when you have failed the previous one. Often times, in these situations hope can be lost, but as Tyrion Lannister demonstrated by gathering up the troops, hope can be found in perseverance and serve as fuel in any situation. 
Perseverance is indeed key to winning many of our personal battles, and particularly the most difficult ones, when we are personally faced with difficult choices.  Although Tyrions speech on the Game of Thrones is a fictional one, and he is a fictional character, it is a speech and that represents many real life situations, where perseverance is often the key to hope. The power of such speeches is that the pathos, ethos, and logos instill the courage needed for perseverance.  Whether such speeches are uttered by real battlefield commanders, or by coaches before the big game, or quietly to our self in a late night dorm room before the next big test, they encourage perseverance and bring hope.  
The clarity of powerful thoughts can lead to powerful action, and can provide us the ability to persevere in our own personal battles.  As Tyrion Lannister might say, we sometimes just need to persevere for ourselves and for those we love and not for abstract wealth, power, or privilege.  Although there are frequently fearful situations at our personal gates, we need to turn and face those fears and address them with the courageous action to persevere.""

Word of warning: some of the coins may reveal/suggest certain plot points, so view at your own risk.

[A GAME OF THRONES, Fantasy Gaming Coins, by Shire Post Mint](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1717678842/a-game-of-thrones-fantasy-gaming-coins-by-shire-po)

From the Kickstarter page: ""...they are real in-world ""coins"" based on thoroughly researched criteria from the Westeros.org wikipedia with help from Elio Garcia, co-author of The World of Ice And Fire, fully licensed by George R.R. Martin, and bearing the likenesses and insignia of different rulers from eight different popular Houses of Westeros.""

I've received some coins from these guys before for a previous GoT Kickstarter, and they are some legit high-quality coins. I personally think they're a bit pricey to be used as ""gaming coins"" as suggested, but as collectibles, they're very much worth it, in my opinion. To make it easy, the $43 level will get you 1 of each circulated coin.

My country, the Philippines, for some reasons I can't comprehend, was chosen to host the world's first Game of Thrones Season 5 Episode 1 advance screening. And I, just a humble blogger without really a flair for words, was invited to witness such an exciting event.

So here's my spoiler-free (I hope) insights:
1.) The show opened with a short glimpse from the past, probably 20 years ago. It wasn't in the book, or so I think, and contributed nothing to the episode. Also, the first episode picked up where the last season left us (the death of a character I dearly adore), which is good.
2.) For a season premiere, it wasn't as exciting as I thought it would be. Of course I can't expect a Battle-of-the-Black-River-esque episode right in the season opening but come on, this is Game of Thrones. Unlike the other season premieres, Season 5 treaded lightly and was trying to set-up a pace before unveiling major events.
3.) Much to my disappointment (part 1), this season will only have ten episodes.
4.) Much to my disappointment (part 2), GOT was very mild on boobies.
5.) Much to my disappointment (part 3), no Arya.

After getting one I upgraded my season 2 set to the BD/DVD/Digital set, and subsequently bought season 3 on the same medium.
Within the last year HBO or whoever produces the sets decided to get rid of the above combo and re-release them as BD/Digital combos. Not a huge deal but it subsequently meant that the season 1 combo would no longer be produced, and that is one I was missing out on. I decided to get it on the new set eventually anyway (I can't afford it now) since it still matches the basic box design of the originals, and won't look out of place (like the new season 4 set which essentially looks the same but is simply missing the DVD discs).

But now it looks like they are phasing out the cool box design for simple regular blu-ray cases. Since releasing the first season in the new design I can't seem to find the one from last year for a reasonable price. And the new design does not come with special features, which is probably why it is so cheap.

Why are they doing this? They released the original first season in Blu-ray only, then made a BD/DVD/Digital combo, then slimmed it down to BD/Digital last year, and are now doing it again with a new case and no special features? Why?

I know it isn't a huge deal but I like having a nice looking collection and I love the boxsets that Game of Thrones comes in. If this is to be the new direction of releasing older seasons I think that is doing a great disservice to future fans.

Cersei will be replaced by a younger queen. The obvious choice is Margery, which means it is very unlikely Margery will be the one to replace Cersei. It is almost certainly going to be Dany who replaces Cersei. Cersei will have the newly white cloaked re-animated mountain fight in a trial by combat for her (likely against Lancel). Lancel will get brutally crushed, and Cersei will be free. Cersei will be very upset at how she was treated, and begin purging Kings Landing.

Meanwhile... Dany will become frustrated with trying to do the impossible (please everyone). She will then do the opposite (only please herself), and begin forcibly conquering cities using her dragons and others. Sooner or later news will reach Melisandre and she will realize that the one ""born amidst salt and smoke"" was a reference to Dany, not the Mannis, and so she will abandon him to go to Dany's side.

The Mannis will have beaten the Bolton's and will have the North rallied to him as he is halfway to KL when Dany will begin to conquer Westeroes. Meanwhile, the White Walkers will begin attaking the Wall. The Mannis will be torn between trying to stop Dany before she is seated in the iron throne, or turning back to defend against the White Walkers. He will choose to go back to defend the wall. The Wall will likely break from the White Walker's using the horn of Jormund, and many of the NW and wildinglings will die. Dany will ignore the white walkers, and hope that they kill the Mannis. Possible with the use of dragon glass, the Mannis will defeat the White Walkers. Now, with the Wall shattered, and the threat of the Night King dealt with, the surviving members of the NW are released from their duty. 

Dany, going mad like many Targaryeans as well as being influenced by the red faith, will make for a ruthless ruler. ""If"" she is the AA, then the prophecy ""This war has just begun. It will last for years. Thousands will die at your command. You will betray the men serving you. You will betray your family. You will betray everything you once held dear. And it will all be worth it"" will come into play. Naturally, the denizens of Westeroes won't be too pleased with her. Some will rally to the Mannis, some out of fear will defend Dany. Eventually, the Mannis will be victorious, as he is the one true king.

I know this is the wrong place to talk bad about Game of Thrones but I haven't seen anyone else really bring this up. 

The Shield had a fast, gritty cinematographic style. The Wire's was the same yet slower. Breaking Bad had it's own style quite unique to itself with the shaky-cam shots. Dexter (1-4) had an incredibly diverse and ever-evolving style throughout its 4 seasons with so many memorable scenes just because of the way they are shot. Even Six Feet Under, a show known for its character development and generally ''slow scenes'' had a way of making the camera work feel alive. Same can be said about Hannibal, True Detective, Fargo, The Walking Dead (as of recent), and especially/essentially Better Call Saul. BCS is a masterclass in cinematography and nothing comes close to it in my opinion.

Then there is GoT. I watch the show for the brilliant acting, great writing and vast universe. The directing on the other hand, and the cinematography, is meh. It's mostly still shots like a daytime soap, and even in the most intense sequences the camera is quite stagnant. It makes the show, for me, feel lifeless. It has no substance and there's no feeling of ''uniqueness'' to itself. I know a show comes alive through its writers and actors but, even though some might not realise it, the directing, camera work and cinematography are the adjoining aspects of bringing these things together.

Is there anybody else that agrees or am I missing something here? I'd rather hear your opinion than be flamed for mine, keep that in mind.

Converse with me friends!,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/322n64/all_spoilers_rewatching_season_1_of_the_show/,WhollyHeyZeus,1428631710,"Just a few observations:

1.  Is it just me or is the tone of the show a little different now?  I feel like there was more time spent for comedic shots (Ned choking Littlefinger and Cat popping her head out of the whorehouse) and the general camera work seems brighter.  Maybe we're just in the more serious material now or I'm just crazy, but the show was a little less grimdark I think.

2.  So many TV-only scenes are brilliant.  Robert, Barristan, and Jaime talking about their first kills?  Robert and Cersei talking about their marriage?  Jorah and Dothraki guy whose name I can't remember?  So good.  

3.  Miltos Yerolemou deserves a goddamned medal for his performance (not a tv award mind you).  He is so freaking great.  Sean Bean and Mark Addy for that matter too.  I miss them. 

Any differences/Easter Eggs/cool moments I should be looking out for?

It's great knowing there's millions out there just like me, who are completely obsessed, and I can have deep meaningful discussions in great depth about even the smallest of details.

-Cersei suffers a downfall, leads somehow to a trial by combat which could bring about CleganeBowl. 

-A new Targaryen comes to King's Landing who claims to be the son of Rhaegar. Nobody knows whether this is the truth.

-Arya is blinded or something? She definitely joins the Faceless Men. 

-Daenerys shits herself in the desert and goes through some major shit.

As a Nexus Player owner, I was very disappointed to learn that Apple would have the exclusivity on HBO Now for this season. But when I heard it would work on your computer too, I saw a ray of hope.

So, this is what we did. We created a HBO Now account using my wife's iPhone. Then, using Chrome and the Google Cast Extension, we send the tab to the TV. Sadly, the quality was disappointing. At first I blamed the HBO player, but then we noticed in the computer the quality way better. This is because the Google Cast extension by default sends only 720p video. 

Lucky for us, If you uninstall Google Cast and install Google Cast (Beta) instead, you will be able to control the resolution, frame rate and bit rate. This gave us the expected result. 

So TL;DR, this is what you need to do:

* Create [your HBO Now account](https://order.hbonow.com/) using an Apple Device. Take advantage of the One Month Free Trial.
* Log In [from a computer](https://www.hbonow.com/sign-in/) with Google Chrome
* If you have it installed, uninstall Google Cast, and instal [Google Cast Beta](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-cast-beta/dliochdbjfkdbacpmhlcpmleaejidimm/related) instead
* Go to the [Google Cast options](http://imgur.com/F7QJhnG), and set the maximum bit rate to at least 5000 kbps, and the resolution at 1920 x 1080 (802.11 ac network is recommended).
* Enjoy.

Now just lets hope HBO servers can handle the pressure for tomorrow's event. 

Let me know if you succeed

Now looking at [a picture from Season 4](http://winteriscoming.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Drogon-S4.jpg) it is clear he is WAY larger.

As many of you probably noticed already, some episodes from season 5 leaked online. Because of this, we would like to remind you that we do not condone piracy, and that any link will result in a ban, as usual. Untagged spoilers will be dealt with accordingly aswell. Do not ask for any link either.

Please also be aware that while we will do our best to remove every spoiler in the subreddit, spoilers might still be here for a short while. Don't hesitate to report every spoiler, try to stay away from the ""new"" queue and browse the comment sections carefully. The top and older comments should remain spoiler-free, but we can't guarantee anything for the most recent ones.

The moderation team.

Edit:
#About Spoiler Warnings and Discussions about the Leaked Episodes

* Title warnings like [S5] and [All Spoilers] cover show spoilers for all episodes **that have aired**.  Leaked episodes have no aired officially and are not covered by any title warning tag.
* Comments with information from a leaked episode are ok as long as they are spoiler-tagged and have a CLEAR label stating the episode the information is from. 
* There will be no ""early"" discussion threads for leaked episodes.  The official sub threads are always the only discussions and meant to consolidate comments together.   If you watch a leaked Ep, you'll still have to wait to really talk about it. 
* People posting leaked spoilers without very clear warning can expect to get banned.

*Roose puts Littlefinger in his place and does a good job hiding Ramsay's dark side from the others.
*There's a show-invented Stannis scene that's praised even by hardcore show haters
*Jaime heads to Dorne after episode 1.
*Jaime uses his golden hand to slap some Dornish soldier.
*Tommen and Margaery have sex, it's off-screen but you can still hear them fucking like jackrabbits and Tommen post-coital looks like he's in heaven.
*Sweet Robin gets dropped off with Yohn Royce for safekeeping while Sansa and LF go to Winterfell.
*Jaime arrives in Dorne in episode 4.
*The battle with the Sons of the Harpy in episode 4 is apparently cool.
*Melisandre's ""You know nothing, Snow"" line is in.
*Cersei is definitely getting some good material this season. More nuanced than the book.
*Kevan is back and taking zero sh-t from Cersei.
*Kevan says he will serve as Tommen's Master of War if the king himself calls upon him but he will not be a puppet of Cersei's.
*Jorah slaps Tyrion for badmouthing him after he kidnaps him.
*No mention of the Griffs.
*Littlefinger's reason for sending Sansa to Winterfell is
*Regarding Littlefinger's plan,
*Davos has a nice scene with Jon Snow.
*There is one pretty great scene with Bronn and Lollys right before Jaime comes to recruit him for the Dorne mission.
*The Sand Snakes are cringeworthy
*Not a single mention of the ironborn or Balon, or Yara.
*Illyrio never even shows up.
*Arya's storyline is apparently dull
*No hint of Davos going to White Harbor.
*Theon has zero dialogue in both episodes he appears in.
*Jaime continues to be pussywhipped by Cersei and wants her affection.
*A Brienne scene with Pod suggests that Brienne will try and murder Stannis",0,1,False,default,,,,,

-------------------

for those who don't know about watchmojo; they are doing these kind of top 10 lists about any topic in tv or movies...

And here is the list:

*10: Petyr ""Littlefinger"" Baelish
*9:  Brienne of Tarth
*8:  Jaime Lannister
*7:  Sandor ""The Hound"" Clegane
*6:  Cersei Lannister
*5:  Joffrey Baratheon
*4:  Jon Snow
*3:  Arya Stark
*2:  Daenerys Targaryen
*1:  Tyrion Lannister

and Honorable Mentions; Tywin Lannister, Bronn, Eddard ""Ned"" Stark, Ramsay Bolton, Lord Varys, Oberyn Martell.

In my opinion... well actually i couldn't disagree more... And this is the worst list of watchmojo. no Stannis? no Khal Drogo? no Robb Stark? no Lady Olenna?... not even honorable mention for those epic characters.. but they took Brienn and The Hound on their list. I don't think they even watch the show.

All of the other 'bad' major characters I can like, to a point, including Joffrey- who is concerned about being a good king, but does it in a stupid and ham-handed manner. Tywin is the perfect Machiavellian, while Petyr and Varys are too nebulous to pin down. Tertiary folks like Rouse, Lysa, Walder, and Gregor feel more like stock characters than anything, but Cersei is the one major character who seems devoid of any positive or redeeming traits. She's vapid, petty, cruel, uninteresting, and kinda stupid in my reading/watching of her. Even with that whole ""loves her children"" thing, it isn't counting toward her based on the kind of results her mothering produced, and any ""strong woman"" credit she might get is dwarfed by characters like Arya, Daenerys, Brienne, Catelyn, Ygritte, Yara, and even Meera.

So, why should I like or care about Cersei? As a secondary objective, I'd like to like Sansa, who isn't 'bad'... Just insanely bland. They both seem like similar characters, regardless of TV Tywin's incorrect parallel between Arya and Cersei

This time though, we were considering going the YouTube Livestream route and seeing if anybody would want to join in on chat with us. It'd probably be around 11:00 pm EST.

So I guess this is just a testing ground to see who would check it out, or what the interest level would be.

I have some questions regarding HBO in countries where English isn't the first language.

I'm going to watch the new season with my friends. We used to watch separately because not everyone was caught up yet, but now we're all ready for season 5. Some of my friends have difficulty completely understanding everything in English and used to buy the DVD box and just watch everything with Dutch subtitles. We were looking at HBO as the easiest option for Dutch subtitles but have some questions. 

So my questions are, and this is basically for Dutch/non-English watchers,

* Does HBO have Dutch or other subtitles for Game of Thrones, the day it's put online (April 13th?) 
* How easy is watching HBO and selecting GoT on your TV? In Holland, we use UPC as our provider.

I guess that's basically it. Hope you guys can help me out. The subtitle question is my most important question to be honest.

Thanks guys and everyone have fun with the new season I guess!",2,6,False,self,,,,,

We had a lot of fun, so this year the game was formalized in a Google Sheet.

Copy the sheet and add your player names. Then enter the kill count each week, along with the guess that the players have made.
Points are awarded in 3 ways. Guessing exactly nets 5. Guessing within (+ or -) 10% yields 2 points. Guessing under (-) 20% yields 1 point.
You can copy the sheet here:

To tweak the percentages or points, just edit one of the formulas and copy over.

We considered any death that we saw, or any time we saw a person alive, then dead, in the correct order as a kill. Part of the fun is arguing.

Edit:  The IF formulas dont seem to be doign what I had hoped at the lower kill counts.  You may need to enter the points in manually.   Sorry!",1,6,False,self,,,,,

I'm going to explain - without any spoilers - the general rules behind the ""Followup for non-readers"" series. The main rule is as follows: **The Followup series is meant to enrich your viewing experience without spoiling it, even if it's technically ""spoilers"".** In the past, I was forced to label the series as ""All Spoilers"" for various reasons. Of course I do not mean to spoil any future developments of the show, but sometimes I might be treading on the spoiler territory. Here's what you might expect.

#Straight Comparison

Easiest case of them all. There's a scene in the books, it's adapted as it is, I can throw in some extra details about it: character's thoughts, dialogue that's been cut, details in the scenery - sometimes it might shed a new light onto the scene, sometimes it's just excess information.

Expect book quotes that got lost in the adaptation, especially the ones considered iconic by the readers. The show versions of the quotes might actually be better for a TV format.

#Background Drop

Connected to the previous case, it's just dumping all the written information attached to the scene, bringing back some information exposed earlier, or even adding some background details that will be covered later on in the books, but it doesn't spoil anything (for example I can write more about a location in advance if its description doesn't move the plot forward in any way).

Most of the time it's just character backgrounds, historical notes and short location descriptions.

#Character Alteration

This one is similar to comparing the book vs the show, but the changes are continuous; it's not just one scene, but a series of them, combining into a very different character from the book prototype. Age, appearance, even personal traits might be drastically different. This shouldn't matter that much to a TV-only fan, but it explains the expectations and complaints the readers might have; sometimes it even justifies an otherwise questionable action that makes much more sense in the book context.

#Character Removal

On one hand, it's as easy as it gets: there was this cool/annoying character in the books, they're not in the show, here's what you're missing. On the other hand, informing about the existence of some characters changes the implications for the ones left in the show: sole heir suddenly having siblings, parent whose only child died suddenly having other children.

I'm trying not to spoil future developments, but it might remove some sort of suspense from some conflicts (even though it shouldn't - if the show went as far as removing unnecessary siblings, the development for the only child left is likely to further differ from the book).

Furthermore, there is the possibility of a seemingly written off character coming back at a later moment (well, maybe not in the case of siblings). In that case, that would be a spoiler. This is why I'm waiting with such notes until the moment when that particular character would have contributed to the plot.

#Show-Only Content

Be it characters, scenes or whole plotlines, show-only content seems closest to the spoiler territory, as it might imply ""this throw-in does not matter, it's a decoy plot, the book resolution must happen"". However, that is not the case. Show-only content is not ""filler"", but - in most cases - substitute for the book content. And in some cases, frankly, the show-only content is more interesting.

Generally it's the opportunity for the readers to shrug and say ""We don't have any idea what the hell that is either"".

#Plotline Removal

The saddest case of them all, when a whole storyline gets cut out. Often connected to the show-only content that replaces it, but not always. Stating that a character had a different story in the books might imply their current development in the show leads nowhere and they're bound to jump back to the book storyline, but that is not (always) the case. Sometimes the book content is marked for deletion and will not appear in show in any form.

The only difficult question here is deciding when to deliver the information, as sometimes you need to wait until both alternatives reach a common plot point to explain the lost content.

Now, if you're new here and want to pass time, you can take a look at [all the followups from the previous years](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/24i7sr/bookshow_followups_for_nonreaders_compilation/) (although I won't vouch for their quality; I like to think my English has improved since then).

All in all, I'm going to label my posts as ""Book Spoilers"" and hope you'll trust me.

|:---|
|Discuss your reactions to the episode with perspective. Talk about the latest plot twist or secret reveal.  Discuss an actor who is totally nailing their part (or not).  Point out details that you noticed that others may have missed.  In general, what did you think about the last episode and where the story is going?  Please make sure to reserve any of your *detailed* comparisons to the novels for the [Book vs. Show Discussion Thread](/r/gameofthrones/w/episode_discussion), and your predictions for the next episode to the [Predictions Discussion Thread](/r/gameofthrones/w/episode_discussion) which will be posted later this week.|

* **This thread is scoped for SEASON 5 SPOILERS** - Turn away now if you have not seen the latest episode!  Open discussion of all aired TV events up to and including episode 5.01 is ok without tags.

* **[Book spoilers still need tags!](#b)** - If it's not in the show, [tag it](/r/gameofthrones/w/spoiler_guide).  Events from episodes *after* this one need tags.

* **[Use green theory tags for speculation](#g)** - Mild/vague speculation is ok without tags, but use a warning tag on any detailed theories on events that may be revealed in the remaining books or in the show.

* **Please read the [posting policy](/r/gameofthrones/w/posting_policy) before posting.**

Disclaimer-I don't work for HBO or any subsidiaries and probably never will. Bummer.

I watched the GoT premiere on my soon-to-go cable so I knew I'd see it but while it was playing I had it running on mute on my cell phone with the HBO Now app over wireless and I'm very pleased to say that it seems the HBO Now experiment is, at this early stage, a solid success.

The picture never faltered, there was never any buffering, when I checked the sound intermittently it seemed to not stutter or lag behind the lip flaps. Im actually watching the preview and after-show making-of and it has aired perfectly (sound included) (the making-of was played immediately after the HBO Now airing when it wasn't on the 'live'/cable version.)

Im not sure how it came across viewing it on the web via HBO Now but will find out next week since I'm killing my cable (FINALLY) tomorrow. I can post again next week if people are interested but I can say right now that at least within the app, GoT ran very smoothly and HBO's gaffe with the premiere last season on HBO Go seems to have been averted since they changed the streaming platform to the NBA setup for Now.

TL;DR-HBO Now seems to rock it at least via the app/on Apple devices/over Optimum (presumed). Will see next week how its web performance is.",0,4,False,self,,,,,

The dialogue in this episode felt uninspired, lazy, and tired. Like the people who wrote it are noticeably 5-years into a consuming ordeal and short on time/energy/sleep/source material. It felt like there were 20 instances where two characters are talking and the other responds with exactly or almost exactly what the other person said. (""perhaps"" perhaps? ""perhaps"")      

The flashback opener was completely pointless -- it told us what we already know and didn't add anything to the character or the plot.     

I feel like the cracks were starting to show last season when they eschewed some of the best dialogue from Tyrion's escape, the botched rape scene, and fizzle of the final episode.      

Game of Thrones is the best show on television, and the talent is there (some of the non-book scenes are amazing -- i.e., the Varys/Littlefinger scenes.)      

But compare those Varys/Littlefinger interactions and the beautiful and crisp dialogue, the exchange of wits, and pit it against the Varys/Tyrion scene in S05E01. It's absolutely brutal. There's nothing clever or well-constructed (""the future is shit. just like the past."") and Varys spends most of it on over-exposition about his true plans, despite everything he says having already been shown rather than said.     

""Politics is the art of compromise."" ""I'm not a politician, I'm a queen.""  Really? Kings and Queens don't engage in politics? It's trying to be clever and not succeeding. That line is so dumb.  George would have never written a line that bad, and neither would have anyone writing in the first three seasons.      

Hopefully the episode was simply an aberration, but with the show running out of material and going off-book, and a crew 5 years in on a grueling schedule, it is worrying. What they've accomplished with this show is unbelievable, but I care little about huge budgets, CGI, costumes, location, actors, if the dialogue and story can't keep the first 3-4 seasons' pace.",16,0,False,self,,,,,

They make it sound as if dead bodies will inevitably arise as wights soon after their death (Jon Snow tells Stannis to be sure to burn all bodies ""by nightfall""). This is presumably due to the magic of the White Walkers (I mean there's not really another option but I don't recall anytime we saw a White Walker actively raising someone from the dead). Obviously this doesn't happen throughout the rest of Westeros, numerous battles happen without the need for burning bodies, and the burial of, for example, Joffrey proved that bodies aren't automatically rising up in the days immediately surrounding their deaths. Obviously there's some point at which the White Walkers' magic no longer extends, but where is ths? It doesn't seem to be the Wall, because they burn bodies killed at Castle Black in the siege, and two Rangers rise in Season 1 at Castle Black as well. Also, there's the case of [ASOS](#b Lady Stoneheart that suggests wights can be raised far South of the Wall, in some instances at least [or is she a different thing than wights?]).

She asks how many children she and the King will have and the Maegi replies ""He will have 20 and you will have 3"".

The thing is, young Cersei is right, that doesn't make sense.   Because in Season 1 (episode 2 I think, after Bran's fall), Cersei is speaking to Cat and tells her about losing her firstborn son to sickness, a boy with black hair.  The boy was clearly not a product of incest, and so we can only assume this was a child between her and Robert which *somebody* had killed.  Also tells us that Cersei had 4 children, not 3.

So, is this a plothole created by David Benoiff and D.B Weiss, or an indication to the viewer that the Maegi doesn't really know what she's talking about, and was just trying to scare Cersei?",19,8,False,self,,,,,

Theoretically, how much trouble could Loras get in if the wrong person saw him? I mean, sure blackmail is always a threat, but I'm talking about actual punishment. Would/could he be imprisoned or executed or anything like that? Joffrey once mentioned he'd considered making it a crime punishable by death, and the prevailing attitude in Westeros isn't exactly accepting. 

In short: is Loras as safe as he thinks he is, or does he need to check himself before he wrecks himself?

This is short because I'm not good at writing.

Seeing that Arys Oakheart is not in the show (or hasn't appeared yet), and that it looks like Jaime and Bronn are taking his place in the role of taking her (Myrcella)* away from the Martells, there is going to be a strong possibility that if they are captured and the scene plays out like it does in the books, either Jaime or Bronn will die here.

So it seems that this may possibly be the last we see of Bronn or Jaime (personally, I believe Bronn might die).  :(

It's hard to tell depending on how subtly D&amp;D are playing the game, but how many of you who are caught up on the books think that Mance died? I personally believe they are sticking to the glamour plot, but replacing Rattleshirt with Tormund (this is not an uncommon theory if you check over at /r/asoiaf). The only real reasons I have for believing this are (though I admit more than a couple are grasping at straws):

1. The show seems to follow the skeleton of the books' plots for most of the time, changing details and condensing characters where necessary, but keeping larger plotlines intact.

2. Mance and Tormund have several repeated, almost unnecessarily so, glances at each other during the last scene. It's almost too frequent to just be a ""watching someone you respect die"" type of thing.

3. Melisandre appears in this episode for almost no reason. All she did was summon Jon to Stannis; Davos could've done that. Melisandre appeared perhaps to remind us that she is there? To make the glamours possible?

4. Mance seems to be out of reasons for not giving the wildlings over. He says it isn't pride, it isn't honor, he even admits that he respects Stannis. The only remaining reason that I can think of for why he might not bend the knee is because it isn't his knee to bend.

5. Having Jon shoot Mance was more than just a mercy-kill; it was a deliberate callback to the ~~same~~ corresponding scene in the books. It was D&amp;D's way of reassuring us that not all is as it seems.

6. We know the Boltons are at Winterfell with Theon, and the trailer for the season hints that the fake Arya plot is still intact. This would further suggest and compliment the fake Mance plot is still intact as well, though it is certainly possible for one to be intact without the other.

Reasons why this theory might be false:

1. It has already been confirmed that Ciaran Hinds is not returning to the show. Earlier we had reports that an actor was surprised at how little material they got this season because they had so much more to do in the books, and so far, Hinds is an excellent candidate for that mystery actor. However, this is not necessarily a theory-breaker since it is possible for Tormund to still play the real Mance without removing the glamour.

2. Mance acted very...Mance-ly during his death. In the books, Rattleshirt screamed and panicked, which was one of the hints that there is a conspiracy going on. In the show, Mance did not scream and struggled only barely. He died with dignity. It is not impossible to expect this behavior of Tormund, but it is unlikely.

3. The line ""This was my home once"" is throwing me for a loop as well. Tormund would not say something like that, and Mance would. It's possible lines were being fed, but again, unlikely.

4. There has been absolutely no evidence of glamours of any kind at any point in the show so far. It would be rather jarring to reveal their existence in the same moment that Mance is, and would look like very bad screenwriting. 

Although there is substantial evidence against it, I'm going to hold out for the Mance/Tormund swap theory until the evidence against becomes overwhelming. What do you guys think?

Take Littlefinger's marriage to Lysa Arryn. Lysa married into her seat of power in the Vale of Arryn, having been born a Tully. When her husband died, she took over the throne and married Littlefinger. 

1. While Lysa was alive, was she the full queen of the Vale for life, or only until her son Robert Arryn came of age? 
2. Now that Lysa is dead, is Littlefinger fully the king of the Vale? 
3. Is Littlefinger just king until Robert Arryn comes of age, or does Littlefinger have to die before Robert Arryn takes over? 
4. If Robert Arryn dies who becomes King of the Vale? 
5. If Littlefinger has kids, do they have any shot at ruling the Vale?

Any other info on how power is transferred via marriage &amp;amp; children would be greatly appreciated.

EDIT: Thanks to /u/n3rdychick, /u/Grizzles_the_Hott, /u/1v1MeSkrub, and /u/jljfuego for answers. Hopefully I didn't get any of this wrong:

1. Lysa Arryn wasn't a queen, she was the ""Lady of the Vale"" making her the defacto ruler of the Vale until her son Robin Arryn (named Robert Arryn in the books) came of ruling age as the ""Lord of the Vale"". Officially, there can be only one King of Westeros who sits on the Iron Throne. All other 7 kingdoms are ruled by ""Lords"".
2. Now that Lysa is dead, Littlefinger is the acting ""Lord of the Vale"" until Robin comes of age.
3. See above
4. None of Littlefinger's kids could rule the Vale, as he is just the intermediary Lord of the Vale until Robin comes of age. If Robin dies, Knight Harold Hardyng would be next in line to become the rightful Lord of the Vale.",6,10,False,self,,,,,

For the unacquainted, the ""Adding Context for Non Readers"" is a weekly (while the show is airing) series of posts I put up wherein I take one element from the new episode and either add extra insight by pointing out book to show differences, or add extra context by breaking down a bit of backstory/lore from the books to give the show watcher a bit of extra knowledge about what they are seeing on screen..  And this week we begin with an interesting topic.  

As we have seen with the first scene in this first episode we have finally had touched upon the show what is quite rampant within the book via Cersei's ""Maggy the Frog"" flashback... Prophecy.  And that is what I wish to cover today.  I wish to touch upon moments of visions or prophecies within the novels that have been left out of the show up until this point... However for the benefit of the non reader I will only cover visions or prophecies that have been ""fulfilled"" on the show as well as the books by this point on the show.  Prophecies that have been ""fulfilled"" or allude to event that happen later in AFFC/ADWD (even one in particular that has been left hanging from late ASOS), or that have not been fulfilled explained to book readers by the end of those novels will not be covered in this post... Though If you wish to discuss those, feel free to do so in the comments behind the appropriate tags.  So for the benefit of the non reader, here are some moments of visions and prophecy from the books that you might find interesting.... but first...

----------------------------------

- Note on Spoiler Scope

At last we have moved onto covering AFFC and ADWD material within the show.  As last night's ""Maggy the Frog"" scene came from that novel and we will be breaking that down shortly I have added the AFFC tag to the post title as well. But no events in the book from past where in the show we are should be discussed, making this...as always...non reader safe. I also added the ""Lore"" tag as I will be discussing some prophecies made prior to the beginning of the books  as well.  As I said, what I'm covering will be limited to what has come to fruition within the show, with the exception of some of the historical prophecies/visions that are present in the books, I don't wish to break down prophecies in the books that could spoil the non reader if I mentioned them, and have intentionally left out parts of some of these moments for that reason..with two exceptions that I will explain when I get to them... however if you wish to discuss some of what I have left out, please feel free to do so in the comments, behind appropriately marked tags. With that being said, let's begin...


----------------------------------

**Minor/One Off/ and Historical Prophecies**

- Daenys The Dreamer : Daenys Targaryen was a member of that house that lived over 100 years before the Conquest of Aegon, it is known that she had made many different prophecies during her lifetime, the most notable of which was that she reportedly had a vision of the obliteration of her homeland and people.  This vision caused her family of minor Dragonlords to relocate to the the island of Dragonstone, off the coast of Westeros. 12 years later her visions came true when a great cataclysm destroyed the Valyrian peninsula, dissolving the freehold, all in an event that would become to be known as ""The Doom of Valyria"". 

- Bran/Jojen green dreams:  One prophecy that has been seen in the show was the dream Bran (Jojen in ""A Clash of Kings"") of the Sea swallowing Winterfell.. Readers and Viewers alike will remember in season 2 this coming to pass as a vague reference to the Ironborn takeover of Winterfell.. There are a couple of things in Jojen's dream that didn't make it to the show that included him seeing the drowned corpses of a few Winterfell inhabitants, most notable is Mikken the blacksmith, who would later be beheaded by Theon (as opposed to Ser Rodrick in the show)

- The Woodswitch and the Prince that Was Promised: During the reign of King Aegon V, the King's eldest son Prince Duncan Targaryen (Uncle of the Mad King, or a Brother of the Mad King by show canon) married a girl by the name of Jenny of Oldstones against his father's wishes.  When Duncan brought Jenny to court she brought to court wood's witch, and a friend of hers.  This unnamed woman was gifted with visions, and had a prophecy that from the line of Prince Aerys (future mad king) and princess Rhaella that the ""Prince that Was Promised"" would be born.  The second son of King Aegon, prince Jaehaerys (who would become King Jaehaerys II) heard this prophecy and arranged the marriage of his children Aerys and Rhaella.  

- John The Fiddler: This one in particular involves a spoiler for a Dunk and Egg novella, I include this because It can show how prophecy can be sometimes fickle and misinterpreted...It's a fairly large spoiler for the 3rd novella, so highlight at your own risk...  [Spoiler's D&amp;E: The Mystery Knight](#b ""During the 3rd Dunk and Egg novella, Dunk encounters a young man by the name of ''John the Fiddler'' competing at the tourney at White Walls.  This man later talks with Dunk confessing that he has prophetic dreams, he states that he dreamed about his elder brothers dying in the Blackfyre rebellion prior to it happening, but more notably he dreamed about seeing Dunk in a cloak of white, in the cloak of a Kingsguard.  Later it is revealed that John the Fiddler is none other than Daemon Blackfyre II, the son of Daemon Blackfyre.  However his dream was misinterpreted, the Tourney at Whitewalls was a ruse to gain support for him to possibly make another attempt at the throne.  And he, seeing Dunk as a member of the Kingsguard, approached Dunk believing him as a future ally.  Dunk did eventually become the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard decades later, but not under Daemon II Blackfyre, but under King Aegon V"")

--------------------------------------------

**Patchface/Shireen's Song**

In the Books there is a character by the Name of Patchface.. a fool in the court of King Stannis Baratheon, and a companion to his daughter Shireen.  Patchface was a Volanteen slave, who was freed by Stannis's father Lord Steffon Baratheon.  Lord Steffon and his wife had been sent across the narrow sea by King Aerys II in an attempt to find a suitable wife for Prince Rhaegar.. However just before making it home Lord Steffon's ship was destroyed killing everybody on board and orphaning Stannis as well as his brothers Robert and Renly.  The only survivor of the wreck was Patchface, who was driven mad by the incident.. Patchface was made a court fool who often sings inconiresnsable songs to often deaf ears... In the show the songs he sings were given to Shireen herself.. However two lyrics in particular are very suspect to the topic at hand, the first is a lyric that only exists in the show via Shireen.  

&gt;The birds have scales, and the Fish take wing.. I know I know

This lyric from season 3 seems to be pointing directly to the situation in the Vale with Petyr Baelish, and the fate of Lysa Arryn.. This is a show only lyric however and does not exist in the book, however.....

&gt;Fool's Blood, King's Blood, Blood on the Maiden's Thigh, but chains for the guest and chains for the bridegroom, aye aye aye. 

This lyric from early ASOS is almost undoubtedly an allusion to the Red Wedding to come later in that novel.. ""Fool's Blood"" being that of Jingle-bell Frey, the Grandson of Lord Walker who's throat was slit by Catalyn Stark at the Red Wedding (as opposed to Lord Walder's wife in the show).  ""King's Blood"" obviously being Robb Stark, and ""blood on the maiden's thigh"" being the bedding of Edmure to Roslin Frey.  And Finally ""But Chains for the guest and chains for the Bridesgroom"" being that not all of Edmure's wedding party being murdered, many (The Greatjon Umber for instance) being taken hostage, along with Edmure himself.  

There are more lyrics to Patchface/Shireen's song that can be broken down, but as far as the topic at hand we'll leave it at that..


----------------------------------------

**The House of the Undying**

As you might all know the House of the Undying chapter in the books are very different from how it was presented in the show. But there is quite a bit in the way of Prophecy she sees in the books that the non-reader might find enlightening.. Once again, this is not all inclusive (for Spoiler reasons) , but here are a few things that were in the book version of the HotU that you might enjoy.

Daenerys sees quite a few memories of her own life and the lives of others while in the HotU. For instance she is shown her childhood home in Braavos, she sees the deaths of both of her Brothers.. Rhaegar upon the Trident, and Viserys' crown of gold. She is shown her wedding night to Drogo, and she also sees a vision of man with silver hair and copper skin striding upon a horse with a burning town behind him.. This last vision is a vision of what could have been if Rhaego, the Stallion who Mounts the World, had lived..  But a few of her visions are a bit more impactful than that.. 

&gt;In one room, a beautiful woman sprawled naked on the floor while four little men crawled over her. They had rattish pointed faces and tiny pink hands, like the servitor who had brought her the glass of shade. One was pumping between her thighs. Another savaged her breasts, worrying at the nipples with his wet red mouth, tearing and chewing.

This terrifying vision of a woman being raped by dwarves many have interpreted as a prophetic allegory of what would come to pass with the War of the Five Kings.  The Dwarves being the Kings vying for control of the land, and the Woman being symbolic of Westeros herself. 

&gt;Finally a great pair of bronze doors appeared to her left, grander than the rest. They swung open as she neared, and she had to stop and look. Beyond loomed a cavernous stone hall, the largest she had ever seen. The skulls of dead dragons looked down from its walls. Upon a towering barbed throne sat an old man in rich robes, an old man with dark eyes and long silver-grey hair. ""Let him be king over charred bones and cooked meat,"" he said to a man below him. ""Let him be the king of ashes."" Drogon shrieked, his claws digging through silk and skin, but the king on his throne never heard, and Dany moved on.

While this vision isn't exactly prophetic, it did show something that would not be elaborated on until A Storm of Swords/Season 3.. And that is King Aerys II's plan to burn King's Landing to the ground via his Wildfire plot.  The Old Man being the Mad King, and the Man Below him being Jaime Lannister.  

and finally the big vision from Dany's HotU chapter...

&gt;Farther on she came upon a feast of corpses. Savagely slaughtered, the feasters lay strewn across overturned chairs and hacked trestle tables, asprawl in pools of congealing blood. Some had lost limbs, even heads. Severed hands clutched bloody cups, wooden spoons, roast fowl, heels of bread. In a throne above them sat a dead man with the head of a wolf. He wore an iron crown and held a leg of lamb in one hand as a king might hold a scepter, and his eyes followed Dany with mute appeal.

I don't think I need to explain what this vision was alluding to but It is very obviously a vision of the Red Wedding.  Imagery of corpses about a feast, a man with a wolf's head being that of what the Frey's did to Robb's and Grey Wind's bodies... It was in a book prior one of the strongest forshadowings of the the Massacare that befell Robb Stark, his Mother, and his Men..

There is quite a bit more in the HotU that I will not cover here, for reason previously stated.. (And it would take to long), but I'll be happy to discuss some of the other more spoilery visions/ visions that warrant speculation she sees in the comments via spoiler tags if you wish to learn..

---

#Baba Yaga's Hut

&gt; *We don't need to fear my father* - Cersei Lannister, in a truly timeless quote now relevant for anyone who used to be afraid of Tywin Lannister

* This is just about the very first flashback the show ever had. It's definitely not the first one in the books - memories of war, recollections of childhood stories and dreams of past events are quite prominent in the series. Sometimes such flashbacks would present a threat to the suspense, as they would reveal too much - the thing about vast amount of history is that you can't pinpoint what's exactly the important detail until way later on, while a TV recap would highlight the interesting parts in a overtly ""in-your-face"" way, as it already does with the entirety of machinations plotted by Littlefinger and Varys.
* What makes it even more of a rare sight is the kind of this scene - it's a prophecy, which is another type of content that's been almost entirely cut off from the show, or at least completely rewritten, as it was with the House of the Undying. Again, presenting such visions or even focusing on specific prophecies would reveal too much.
* Why show this particular scene, then? Well, unlike all the other characters, puzzled but unmoved by the things they've heard or witnessed, Cersei is heavily influenced by Maggy the Frog's prophecy. It's still on her mind after all these years, even more so now that so much of it has turned out to be true.
* What further explains Cersei's character and motivation is that Maggy has one more vision for her: ""a younger brother wrapping his hands around her throat"". This only fuels Cersei's hate for Tyrion, as she's afraid he'll be the one to take her down.
* The prince that Cersei was supposed to marry was noone else but Rhaegar Targaryen. The visit to the hut takes place during a tourney hosted in Lannisport to celebrate the birth of Viserys Targaryen. Aerys ""Mad King"" Targaryen was present, but he rejected Tywin's offer to marry Cersei to Rhaegar. Tywin was Aerys's Hand for 20 years, but he left King's Landing on bad terms. If you want to grasp on how tight that character diagram is, Aerys has later sent Steffon Baratheon (father of Robert, Stannis and Renly) to search for a suitable bride for Rhaegar; Steffon died in a shipwreck and the prince ended up marrying Elia Martell (sister to Doran and Oberyn Martell).

#Googly Eyes

&gt; *Thank you so much for your kind words* - Cersei, picking a very polite and restrained way to say ""Go and fuck yourself""

* The fourth book is called *A Feast for Crows* and takes off more or less where season 4 left us, starting with the plotlines of Iron Islands, Dorne and King's Landing who are left to deal with the events that finished *A Storm of Swords*. Other point-of-view characters in the beginning are Arya, Brienne and Samwell (the last two are new to the POV group).
* Iron Islands are at this stage for all intents and purposes written out of the show, and unless we revisit that location in season 6, expect the utmost level of salt from book readers. Myself included. If we see them again, however, expect HYPE as strong as the hype for [The Witcher 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYwe_WHARdc).
* King's Landing, for the very first time, is shown from Cersei's POV - up to this point it used to be Eddard, Arya, Sansa, Tyrion and later Jaime. This allows us for an insight into her mind and a very unique perspective of the location, never seen before.
* The chapter begins in the morning after Tyrion's escape. Cersei has a dream in which she's sitting on the Iron Throne, but once a dwarf starts laughing at her, she realizes she's naked and the blades of the Iron Throne start to harm her. She wakes up from the nightmare only to find out that her father is dead and Tyrion has escaped. The Kingsguard, maesters and the servants clean up the mess, with Shae's body disposed of in a way so that noone can find out about her.
* The mourning for Tywin Lannister lasted for seven days. His body has taken an unnatural color and spreads a foul stench. The scene in the Sept of Baelor features young Tommen, who is unable to withstand the reek. He is excused as emotionally upset.
* The crowd mourning Tywin is noticeably smaller than the ones that bode farewell to Robert and Joffrey Baratheon, as Tywin is still remembered as the man who sacked the city at the end of Robert's Rebellion.
* Cersei intially urges Jaime to take Tywin's post as Hand of the King. Jaime publicly japes at his hand-less status and refuses the offer.
* Lancel Lannister is a pious man, but definitely not one of the sparrows. In the books Tywin has him become a lord and marry a Frey woman (a widow) to please Kevan Lannister (Tywin's brother). In the show, Lancel jumps from a background character to a more prominent one.
* I've repeated that many times already, but the books handle sex scenes differently. We can start with the fact that only POV characters can have sex scenes, and then you have the problem of half of the POV characters being children. And since neither Loras nor Renly are POV characters, there are no gay sex scenes (with Olyvar being a show-only character).
* I'm not sure if it's time to say that already, but it seems this plotline has wrapped up: Loras's engagement to Cersei was never a thing in the books. Furthermore, as was already mentioned in previous followups, Loras and Margaery have two older brothers, so Loras is not the sole heir of the Tyrell family. Of course this dynamic is different in the show, but the book story explains why there was no urge on Loras to marry or no prior engagements (or, why did the Tyrells let him join Renly's Kinsguard and generally let him be ""free"" of marital arrangements).
* And then, or even in the first place, book Loras is a hopless romantic, still in love with Renly. He wouldn't sleep around.

#This Side Up

&gt; *The future is shit,  just like the past* - Tyrion Lannister, very optimistic about the show's development

* The fifth book, *A Dance with Dragons*, depicts events that occur **simultaneously to AFFC**. The two books are split by characters - while AFFC covers most of Westeros, action of ADWD is almost all in Essos (plus the Wall, plus some other stuff).
* ADWD was supposed to be published a year after AFFC. The delay was prolonged to 6 years for various reasons, one of them being the ""Meereenese knot"", in which various character storylines had to come to a common conclusion in Meereen, but they were all in a huge mess. The problem was resolved by band-aids such as adding new POV characters (Barristan Selmy being one of them), which gradually broke the consistency of the first few books (which juggled between a closed list of 7-10 POV characters) and starting to resemble the show format.
* What this leads us to, is the footnote to all scenes in Essos from now on: The show-only content is a new, alternative and quite possibly a way more thought-out story. The showrunners had the opportunity to re-do the whole thing and avoid making the same mistakes GRRM has made.
* For today's episode, let's just note that we're revisiting Pentos for the first time since S01E01, and Tyrion's story picks up where he starts in ADWD, even though there are some distinct differences.

#Unchained Slaves, Chained Dragons

&gt; *I'm not a politician. I'm a queen* - Daenerys ""Kelly C"" Targaryen, more correct that she realizes

* The events of this episode are the start of ADWD for Daenerys, although various events from ADWD like the events that led up to chaining the dragons were taken from ADWD as well. ASOS ends with Daenerys settling down in Meereen, and given that season 4 has already covered parts of her reign, we're bound to run out of book material by the end of this season. As we are with pretty much all of the characters, actually.
* The killed Unsullied was Stalwart Shield, but the show named him White Rat to keep the ""dirty"" theme.
* Sons of the Harpy mark their victims by drawing a harpy in blood.
* Again, quick reminder - there is no relationship between Grey Worm and Missandei in the books (considering Missandei is 10), but the show format chose to go for it in order to portray the effects of the horrors that made them into Unsullied, which the books achieve with background drops and omissions. A bit more ""show, don't tell"" approach.
* It appears that Daario Naharis has taken a few character traits from Strong Belwas, the fat gladiator who fought the champion of Meereen in the books. In this case it's the fighting pits background.

#A Warm Goodbye

&gt; *Traitor who planted a dagger in Robb Stark's heart. Don't you want to avenge him?* - Stannis Baratheon, blissfully unaware of what happens to anyone fighting in Team Stark

* The Wall is still finishing up the last few chapters from *A Storm of Swords*.
* Janos Slynt is not a sidekick to Alliser Thorne; it's the other way around. Book Slynt is a corrupt douche, but not a coward. I appreciate ""The Watchers on the Wall"" episode for what it was, but after seeing that hideously written character in ""The Hobbit"" I'm allergic to the ""ha ha what a coward"" archetype.
* Book Stannis is way more about arming up against the White Walkers than conquest for the sake of it (that was the entire reason for his journey to the North) in his rhatoric at this point, but I guess we can still get there later on.
* Mance gets ""famous last words"" and a conversation with Jon Snow, which we didn't have in the books. Cut from the show, however, is the issue of his wife and newborn child, which I presume is now irrelevant.
* The differences pile on and I'm going to wait a while before I uncover what they are. This problem can still be resolved in a different way. From what I've heard the Rattleshirt character has been recast, and we could see a serious re-writing of the Wilding plotline.

#The Scooby-Doo Corridor Chase

&gt; *So, where* ***are*** *we going?* - Sansa Stark, as puzzled as the readers and non-readers alike

* The extent of content that appears to be cut from the show is just ridiculous. Basically the entirety of AFFC when it comes to Sansa and Brienne has been discarded and rewritten from scratch.
* Good news is: We haven't lost anything of importance. Sansa's character development with Robert Arryn and lords of the Vale had its perks, but otherwise it's one of the weakest points of already weak book of the series. Same goes for the Brienne's solitary (!) road trip, which features myriads of dead ends and exploring locations and characters that seem highly irrelevant.
* In the next week's post - or in a separate post altogether, seems like a perfect job for /u/GRVrush2112 - we'll cover the entirety of Brienne's journey up to meeting Podrick Payne (and from there onwards, as it seems to be entirely different in its course). As for Sansa... let's just say that in the teaser chapter of *The Winds of Winter* (the unpublished 6th book!) she's still at Eyrie with Littlefinger and Sweetrobin.

WE ANIME ORIGINAL ENDING NOW

Seriously, right now the recommendation is not ""read the books so you can learn what will happen next"" but ""read the books so you can know the alternate story"". This is going to become problematic for my followups, as **I can't supplement a show-only content** in the same way as with straight adaptation.

---

And that concludes this week's followup. The character limit has been increased to 15 000 characters, so we should be able to fit all the followups in one post from now on, without having to put the excess content in first reply. Feel free to include any feedback, point out mistakes and/or omissions - I'll surely update the post.

And the fact that Martn has given up on the story and given HBO permission to do as they please shows that he in a way is admitting he fucked it up back in Feast for Crows. As a reader we didn't mind our heroes being killed off (I did but you know what I mean) but all these disposable walk on parts in the book have gotten tired.

Thank you HBO for doing what he won't be doing and finishing the story of Westeros.

So to my knowledge (this may be wrong, my GoT knowledge only consists of the show &amp; the first book) before Aegon the first conquered Westeros, there were seven kingdoms which were:

1. The North
2. The Kingdom of the Rock
3. The Kingdom of the Mountain &amp; the Vale
4. The Kingdom of the Isles &amp; Rivers
5. The Kingdom of the Stormlands
6. The Kingdom of the Reach
7. Dorne

So I believe to begin with Dorne stayed independent then it finally became part of the Seven Kingdoms through a Martell marrying a Targaryen. Then, Aegon split the seven Kingdoms into nine regions which were:

1. The North
2. The Westerlands
3. The Vale of Arryn
4. The Riverlands
5. The Stormlands
6. The Crownlands
7. The Reach
8. Dorne
9. The Iron Islands

My questions are: Is everything I've put here correct?

If there are actually nine regions, why does everyone refer to it as the Seven Kingdoms?

Thanks for any answers.

It seems to me that even when he had 100 thousand in his army he knew he would have to negotiate for his people's position south of the wall if they were to have any future there. Mance knew that without some kind of pledge of loyalty - either to the warden of the north or to the iron throne - there was no way Mance's people would have been allowed to stay south of the wall.

Even when he had a huge army Mance was a beggar king; he had his own realm, but the realm had become uninhabitable due to White Walkers. He came south knowing he had to beg land for his people from another king. He then inexplicably choose to burn rather than beg Stannis.

2828,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2015-4-14,2015,4,14,9,32i9fe,self.gameofthrones,"[TV] To clear up a common misconception about the ""Seven"" Kingdoms, a short history of each of the major regions of westeros",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/32i9fe/tv_to_clear_up_a_common_misconception_about_the/,demostheneslocke1,1428971545,"I thought I'd consolidate a short history of the major regions of Westeros by clearing up a common misconception.

Several times, I've seen people refer to the ""seven high lords of westeros"" or ""the seven regions of westeros"" or ""the rest of the seven kingdoms"" as if the ""Seven Kingdoms of Westeros"" was a literal seven regions. 

True, when the first Aegon was Lord of Dragonstone, before he landed in King's Landing, there were in fact seven kingdoms: the Kingdom of the North (Stark), the Kingdom of Mountain and Vale (Arryn), the Kingdom of the Isles and Rivers (Hoare), the Kingdom of the Rock (Lannister), the Kingdom of the Reach (Gardener), the Kingdom of the Stormlands (Durrandon), and Dorne (Nymeros Martell).

However, after Aegon the Conqueror and his wars, Westeros was in fact divided into nine regions.

1. **The North** is ruled by the Lords of Winterfell, originally House Stark until the Baratheons in King's Landing (who are truly only Baratheon in name) named House Bolton as Lords of Winterfell. 
The North was previously ruled by the King in the North, a Stark, until Torrhen Stark bent the knee to Aegon to spare the North from Dragons. The Starks were able to retain control of the North in Aegon's new kingdom.

2. **The Vale** is ruled by the Defenders of the Vale and Lords of the Eyrie, House Arryn. The Andals and the First Men (every family in Westeros except the Targs and Dorne can trace their lineages back to either The Andals or the First Men) had a patriarchal and primogeniture system - meaning the first born *male* inherits and only passes through the male line until there is no more men left and then it goes to the women. As a result, currently Robin is in fact Lord of the Eyrie and Defender of The Vale. Lysa, as a woman, is not the ruler of the Vale but instead acts as his ""Regent."" Practically, yes, she's the ruler. However, according to the law, she only rules in his name and her acts only hold weight because he is lord. When Petyr Baelish (Littlefinger) marries her, he acts as Regent. When she dies, there is trouble about who should be Robin's Regent. It's basically glossed over in the show, but Petyr ends up taking that role. **Prior to Aegon's conquering,** The Vale was ruled by the King of the Mountain and the Vale. When Aegon was conquering Westeros, the King was a young boy named Ronnel. One of Aegon's sisters flew her dragon up to the Eyrie and the King of the Vale was in awe of the dragon and liked Aegon's sister, so he asked his mom to submit the Vale. His mom, who was regent at the time, submitted the Vale to Aegon's rule. In exchange, the new Lord Ronnel got to ride on the dragon. 

3. **The Crownlands** are the lands that the Crown directly controls and are ruled by the King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, House Baratheon of King's Landing (aka King Tommen). It includes Dragonstone, the original seat of the Targs before Aegon's Conquering. After the Targ's conquered Westeros and founded King's Landing, the heir apparent of the throne was given the title ""Prince of Dragonstone"" and was given the seat of Dragonstone. After Robert's Rebellion, he gives Stannis (his younger brother and next in line to the throne until Robert would ""father"" Joffrey) Dragonstone, but doesn't name him ""Prince of Dragonstone."" That title dies with the Targs. Instead, Stannis is ""Lord of Dragonstone."" **Prior to Aegon's Conquering** the Crownlands were disputed between many different kings and lords. 

4. **The Stormlands** are ruled by the Lords of Storm's End and the Lords Paramount of the Stormlands, House Baratheon of Storm's End. Prior to Robert's Rebellion, Robert was Lord of Storm's End and Lord Paramount of the Stormlands. When he became King, he gave Stannis Dragonstone and gave Renly the seat of Storm's End. As a result, Renly effectively ruled in the Stormlands, but Robert was still the lord of the region at least in name. **Prior to Aegon's conquering,** the Stormlands were ruled by the Storm Kings, House Durrandon. The last of the Storm Kings was killed by Orys Baratheon, the best friend and (rumored) bastard half brother of Aegon the Conqueror. The Targs have married into House Baratheon a few times, including marrying Princess Rhaelle (Egg's daughter) to Robert's grandfather, Ormund Baratheon. Thus, King Robert's legal claim to the throne after he killed almost all of the Targs.

5. **The Westerlands** are ruled by the Lords of Casterly Rock, House Lannister. Tywin was the Lord of Casterly Rock until his death. After his death, succession is a little confusing. Jaime would be Lord, but as a member of the Kingsguard he has forsaken his inheritance. Technically, Tyrion would then inherit but we know Tywin's feelings about that before Tyrion killed him and went into exile. Tyrion being a criminal sentenced to death also basically disinherits it. Cersei wants the Westerlands, but they basically pass to Tywin's brother - Kevan Lannister.
**Prior to Aegon's conquering**, it was ruled by the King of the Rock. The King of the Rock and the King of the Reach joined forces to stop Aegon, but the resistance died on the Field of Fire. The King of the Rock survived the Field of Fire and bent the knee to Aegon. Aegon let him remain as the ruler in the Westerlands.

6. **The Reach** is ruled by the Lords of Highgarden, Defenders of the Marches, High Marshall of the Reach, House Tyrell. Mace Tyrell, Margaery and Loras' dad, is the Lord of Highgarden. However, everyone recognizes that the true force in House Tyrell is his mom - Olenna Tyrell (ne Redwyne). She is technically Dowager Lady of Highgarden and therefore has no legal power, but the bitch is baaaaad and Mace is an idiot.
**Prior to Aegon's conquering**, it was ruled by the King of the Reach, House Gardener. King Mern IX and all of his heirs died in the Field of Fire. When Aegon got to Highgarden, he was met by a Tyrell, the stewards of Highgarden, who surrendered the castle to Aegon.

7. **The Riverlands** are ruled by Lords Paramount of the Trident. Prior to the War of the Five Kings, the Lords of Riverrun, House Tully, held this title, but King Joffrey (aka his grandfather Tywin) gave the title Lords Paramount of the Trident to the Lords of the Crossing, House Frey, for its role in the Red Wedding. I won't go too far into who is now Lord of Riverrun, because it becomes a problem in the books and I don't know if it will be explored in the show. Technically, Edmure Tully - the guy who got married at the Red Wedding and Catelyn Stark's younger brother - inherited Riverrun after his dad, Hoster, died. However, he is now in a cell in the Twins curtesy of Walder Frey.
**Prior to Aegon's conquering**, The Riverlands have rarely ever been ruled by any dominant house. The lands, being surrounded by other Kingdoms and resting on the Trident - the bloodline of Westeros - were always hotly contested. When Aegon the Conqueror landed at King's Landing, they were mostly ruled by Harren the Black of House Hoare from the Iron Islands (you may remember him as the guy who built Harrenhal and burned alive in its melting walls). House Tully was one of the first powerful houses in the region who helped Aegon defeat Harren the Black and was awarded a newly carved region.

8. **The Iron Islands** are ruled by Lords Reaper of Pyke, House Greyjoy. Since Balon has declared independence as King of the Iron Islands, House Baratheon of King's Landing hasn't named a new Lord Reaper of Pyke or even taken on the Ironborn. In truth, it doesn't seem like they've done anything about it at all. The methods through which the Ironborn choose their leaders is really interesting and hopefully it'll make its way into the show. I don't want to delve into this for spoiler reasons. **Prior to Aegon's conquering**, ruled by the Kings of the Iron Islands, House Hoare.

9. Finally, **Dorne**. Dorne is ruled by the Princes of Dorne, Lords of the Sandship, and Lords of Sunspear, House Nymeros Martell. The Dornish trace their lineages to the Rhoynar, a different peoples than the First Men or Andals. The Rhoynar fashioned themselves as ""Princes"" and gave women more power in their families. You can see this in the ""Nymeros"" part of ""House Nymeros Martell"" - Nymeria was a Rhoynar Princess Warrior who led the Rhoynar to Dorne from Essos (the mainland) and married into House Martell, a house that was already in Dorne. They were not conquered by Aegon the Conqueror but are only subject to the King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm because they joined the Targ family through marriage. 


**Thus, the *nine* regions of Westeros.**

""Warden"" is in fact a military title and has to do with who controls the country's forces in that region. It is held by a person, not a house, but is usually passed through the house by tradition. It can be taken away from a house. There is a **Warden of the North** (Eddard Stark, then Roose Bolton), **Warden of the East** (Jon Arryn until his death, then Jaime Lannister because Robin was too young, then Tywin gave it to Robin to restore relations with the Vale), **Warden of the West** (Tywin Lannister until his death, then Cersei appoints Ser Daven Lannister, Tywin's cousin and brother-in-law), and **Warden of the South** (Mace Tyrell). 

Those are the four big ones. There are three smaller ones that have to do with historic wars. 

The many attempts to conquer Dorne, and the many rebellions by the Dornish who were conquered, led to the **Warden of Stone Way** (Lord Anders Yronwood) and **Warden of the Prince's Pass** (Lord Frankyln Fowler). These stopped being important after the Dornish joined the rest of Westeros peacefully through marriage. Nonetheless, they are still titles. Prince's Pass and Stone Way connect Dorne with the Stormlands and the rest of Westeros.

The eastern coast of The North was subject to a lot of raidings from mainlanders from Essos. One major river from the North empties east, the White Knife. In an attempt to defend the North from raiders up the White Knife, a King in the North established the Wolf's Den. The Wolf's Den is a castle in what is now known as White Harbor. The Lord of White Harbor, Wyman Manderly, is thus **Warden of the White Knife.**",39,196,False,self,,,,,

It's somewhat subtle, but stands out as something a little more than just being friends. Further, it seems that there is also a level of dominance in the relationship between the two (which, alone, isn't surprising given Cersei's character). The way the two girls interacted reminded me, whether intentional or not, of the friendships I've had with other girls/women that has been rooted in something more than a desire to be just friends, even if it was complicated or unknown to me in the moment.

Given this, I wonder if the show is hinting at the inclusion of Taena this season. She is a fairly significant character in the Kings Landing parts of AFFC and Cersei and her have a friendship that extends into a sexual domain where Cersei exercises control and dominance over the other woman. 

This may be a little too tin-foil, but when I was watching that scene, all I could think about was Cersei and Taena. ",3,4,False,self,,,,,

Let's start with this, all networks send out promotional copies of shows to reviewers and/or other sources in the media. In almost all cases they send out the first 4 and only the first 4 episodes. My friend frequently gets these promotional copies from his job. A few years ago, he got his hands on, and let me keep the promotional copy for the final season of Dexter. For those of you crying ""Bullshit"" [Here is the picture of the promotional copy I still own](http://i.imgur.com/f02QQFD.jpg)


He was very hesitant to give it to me, and I had to promise numerous times that I would not attempt to distribute the episodes online. The reason being (and this is where HBO made a huge mistake) Showtime uniquely watermarked each copy with a serial number. HBO did this to, but they were not as secure as Showtime was. Showtime had each copy watermarked at different parts on the episode, at different positions on the screen. The reason being, if someone tried to blur out the serial number, they could still use the placement and position as a reference to determine where the leak came from, and that company would be black listed. HBO however felt comfortable enough putting the serial number in the same spot for each copy (bottom left of the screen, continuously throughout the episode.) By doing this, all the leaker had to do was blur out the number, and for those of you who watched them, you probably noticed the blurred pixels in the bottom left corner. HBO had been doing this for all promo-copies of shows before this, I am currently asking my friend to take a screen shot of his old ""Eastbound and Down"" promo-copies for a reference, will post it when he responds. This was the first time it had come back to bite them in the ass, given the large popularity of GoT. 

So basically, for those of you seeing people saying ""my sources say more are on there way""...they are bullshitting you, and they know it. These were promotional copies that were leaked, and HBO could have prevented it with a better planned watermarking system. There will only be these 4 episodes, and if you want to see more, get ready to wait 4 weeks.",0,1,False,default,,,,,

The one set that I found seemed to lack this, so I'd like to formulate it more here. Some of them I have ideas for, while some of them I'm clueless. (Went with TV spoilers because some of the ideas would be spoilers.)

* 0 - The Fool: Arya
* I - The Magician: Littlefinger
* II - The High Priestess - Melisandre
* III - The Empress - Margaery, maybe?
* IV - The Emperor - Either Robert Baratheon or Tywin Lannister.
* V - The Heirophant - Grand Maester Pycelle
* VI - The Lovers - Cersei and Jaime Lannister
* VII - The Chariot - I was thinking Joffrey on a chariot being led by a stag and a lion.
* VIII - Strength - Danaerys with Drogon.
* IX - The Hermit - Maybe Master Aemon?
* X - Wheel of Fortune - Some representation of the Game of Thrones, *a la* Danaerys' Wheel speech.
* XI - Justice - Stannis Baratheon
* XII - The Hanged Man - I was thinking Theon/Reek on one of the Bolton... cross... things. You know what I mean.
* XIII - Death - Either a Faceless Man or the White Walker ""king"" on his horse.
* XIV - Temperance - Catelyn Stark, maybe?
* XV - Devil - Ramsay Snow
* XVI - The Tower - The Red Keep
* XVII - The Star - Sansa, maybe?
* XVIII - The Moon - The wolves on the card make me want to go with something Stark-related, and the card's meaning makes me want to go with something to do with Bran... but I'm not sure.
* XIX - The Sun - Tommen Baratheon
* XX - Judgement - The White Walkers
* XXI - The World - An image of Westeros, and the four animals surrounding would be a wolf, lion, dragon and stag.

We haven't seen the BWB in a long time, and so it's possible the writers are saving them for a big reveal. Characters like Melisandre and Lord Frey are also likely to be around Winterfell for the finale. I imagine characters like Lord Manderly, Able the bard, Wex, Jeyne Poole, etc. are going to be cut, and their parts distributed among characters we already know.

I feel like we're at a point where even book readers have zero clue what to expect, but if the characters are going to end up roughly where they are in the books by the end of this season, this would be a really practical way to facilitate that.",7,1,False,self,,,,,

Hello everyone! I know March Madness is over but maybe we can still have our own April Absolute Madness! I've always wondered and discussed with friends who we and who people think the best fighter in the SOIAF world is, and I've been wanting to put together a bracket format of characters and having people vote on who they think would win. I'm talking 1 on 1 in a pit, just picture Oberyn vs The Mountain and that's how every match would be. Character could be alive or dead.
Right now I'm just asking if you guys would be interested in something like this, using the search option I saw discussions of who people thought were the best but not with a tournament format like I'm planning on doing. Just let me know if you guys would be interested because I would love to put it together.

I'm an avid fan of the books and show and used to do some posting over at /r/asoiaf. I noticed a lot of subtle information in this first episode that might slip past show-only viewers, or even book readers themselves. My intention here is not to review the episode, but rather to fill in details and information that you otherwise might never know. I'll do my best to keep the content relevant, interesting, and spoiler-free. I'll include plenty of links for reference, all Imgur. If enough people like the concept, I will continue to post for each episode this season.*

**Opening Credits**

Let's get right into things with the intro. If you've been fast forwarding through this for the past 4 seasons you may have missed a lot. The intro of course is a map of the world, but each episode's is slightly unique, showing you the locations that will be featured that night. What's noteworthy in this week is the fact that the arms of House Bolton now appear over Winterfell which is being rebuilt, the Bite appears (we'll get to that later), and we get to see both Pentos and Meereen, finally giving us multiple viewpoints on the eastern continent of Essos.

**Scene I: FLASHBACK, Woods near Casterly Rock**

We see a young Cersei and her friend creeping through the woods near Casterly Rock, the home of the Lannisters where her, Jaime, and Tyrion lived as children. Cersei is searching for ""Maggy the Frog"", a supposed woods witch who can tell the future. Maggy tastes Cersei's blood and offers her three questions. These are as follows:

* Will I marry the prince?

* Will I be queen?

* Will I have children?

As for the first question, Cersei at this time is engaged by Tywin to marry Rhaegar Targaryen, son of then King Aerys Targaryen and also older brother to Dany. Yup. Maggy says ""no, but you will marry the king."" This one actually turns out true. She never marries Rhaegar but she does marry King Robert. Cersei then slips in a quick follow up making sure she will be queen. Maggy says yes but a younger and more beautiful woman will come to cast her down. The third question concerns children. Maggy says the king will have 20 but she will have 3. Again, true. Robert sired many bastards while Cersei has 3 children with Jaime. ""Gold will be their crowns, gold will be their shrouds"" says Maggy. We then cut to present time where this encounter is still clearly weighing on Cersei's mind all these years later. With many parts of this prophecy fulfilled already and Cersei suspecting Margaery as the younger more beautiful woman, you can begin to see some of what makes Cersei so paranoid in King's Landing.

**Scene II: The Great Sept**

This scene is pretty self explanatory. Jaime wants to deal with all the wolves in sheep's clothing outside who are eager to seize up Tywin's assets and divide his kingdom. Meanwhile, Cersei is still fixated on her hatred for Tyrion. 

**Scene III: Manse of Illyrio Mopatis**

Tyrion finally emerges from his crate after weeks at sea. His first sight is Varys standing over him with a crowbar. Anyone else get eerie flashbacks of Varys and his earlier crate with the old sorcerer? Tyrion showcases his typical knowledge and perception by correctly guessing they are in Pentos simply by analysing the architecture and vegetation. Nice one. Pentos is a tropical city on the western coast of Essos. It is directly across the sea from King's Landing. Varys confirms this and goes on to explain that they are at the house of Illyrio Mopatis. Now while this name may sound foreign to you, we have actually seen this guy before. Flashback to the very first episode and you'll recall that Illyrio is in fact the [man](http://i.imgur.com/DkuzQEk.jpg) who arranged Dany's marriage to Khal Drogo. Yes, Tyrion is now in the exact same mansion. Wild, huh. Illyrio and Varys are actually old childhood friends. They were first drawn together as ""loyalists to the throne"", political rebels who intended to depose Robert and put a more capable king in his place. Varys laments that this failed and the situation in Westeros is even worse now.

**Scene IV: Meereen**

Meereen is an old slaver city. Although it is also on Essos and Tyrion and Dany are on the same continent, it is on the complete opposite side of the landmass. They are still very very distant from each other. 
Immediately we see the Great Harpy being pulled down off the pyramid. The Harpy has always been the symbol of Meereen and its people. Pulling it down is Dany's attempt to stamp some authority on this vast city that she is so desperately trying to rule. Below in the streets, an Unsullied visits a brothel. Many Unsullied have been doing this. Although they do not have functioning parts or the capability to have sex, some of them simply enjoy the company of another and the touch of a woman. Sadly for this Unsullied, this will be his last cuddle sesh.
Back in the pyramid, Dany and her advisors discuss the murder. The gold-masked person who killed the Unsullied was one of the Sons of the Harpy. They are a radical group of Meereenese that oppose Dany and her presence there. It is suspected that the Sons of the Harpy are members of Meereenese nobility, united in their outrage at Dany's crucifixions from last season. 
The young man present at their meeting, Mossador, is the little brother of Missandei. As we hear,this is the first time the Sons of the Harpy have actually taken to violent protest. Dany makes a plan to give the murdered Unsullied a funeral in the Temple of the Graces, the most holy temple in all of Meereen. She knows this will piss off the Sons of the Harpy and hopefully draw them out to reveal themselves.

**Scene V: The Wall**

Here, Samwell sets up some of what will be a plotline on the Wall this season. The Night's Watch must choose a new commander. Many men will run for election and most of them are less than ideal candidates, according to Sam. We see two such potential candidates walk past, [Alliser Thorne](http://i.imgur.com/eakPyOC.jpg) and [Janos Slynt](http://i.imgur.com/J5iJYQ6.jpg). Sam mentions one man, Ser Denys Mallister, as perhaps the only decent choice. Denys is a seasoned Night's Watch man who rules a castle further west on the Wall, so you can count on seeing him show up at Castle Black as a new character this season. If you want to see the man cast to play him so you'll be ready when he shows up, [here](http://imgur.com/BeVmtWZ) is a link to the actor's picture. No spoilers.

**Scene VI: Runestone**

Runestone is the ancestral castle of House Royce, a family loyal to the Eyrie and the Arryn family. It is near the Eyrie but farther east on the coast of the sea. You can see from their [crest](http://i.imgur.com/4766MAh.png) that this is indeed Runestone. The dots can be seen on the two flags in the corners of the platform, and Lord Royce himself has runes woven onto his outfit. 
Littlefinger has elected to leave the young and frail Robin Arryn here while he and Sansa prance about the Vale doing Littlefinger things. Note briefly that Sanse ever so slyly tries to catch a peek of Littlefinger's message. Littlefinger of course turns it away but notice that Sansa has now really started ""playing the game"" and is no longer the sweet and innocent child she used to be. The man sitting with them is Yohn Royce, the head of the Royce family. He is a loyal man and Littlefinger trusts him at least slightly to retain that loyalty and look after Robin for a time. As a fun aside, Yohn's son Waymar appeared as a [cocky Night's Watch man](http://i.imgur.com/kKviZiq.jpg) in the very first scene of the series.
Littlefinger and Sansa then leave Runestone. They have told Yohn they are travelling to the Fingers. These are three long and skinny landmasses north of Runestone and you can sort of see them just below The Bite in the opening sequence (told you we'd get to it later). However, Sansa cleverly notes that they are in fact travelling west, not north. At this moment, they pass right beside Brienne and Pod. 
Remember, Brienne and Pod are out here because Jaime gave them:

* 1. The sword Oathkeeper which Brienne is fittingly polishing
* 2. The task of finding and protecting Arya and Sansa

Sit for a moment and relish in (or cringe at) the fact that Sansa just passed within 100 feet and Brienne will never have any idea.

**Scene VII: King's Landing**

Keep Maggy's prophecy of a young and beatiful woman coming to cast down Cersei and *now* watch her emotions as she observes Margaery flirting with Tommen. Puts a whole new perspective on things, doesn't it?
Cersei then has a conversation with Kevan Lannister, who is Tywin's brother and thus Cersei's uncle. Kevan is the father of Lancel who we see here, barefoot with a buzzed head. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/equAFmi.png) is a side-by-side comparison of Lancel's hair from last season and this season.
Kevan explains that Lancel is now a ""Sparrow"". Sparrows are a name for practicioners of the Faith of the Seven who elect to have no possessions and live a life of complete piety. Not much is known about them or their intentions. They have no homes and thus live on the streets, which is why Tywin would never have allowed them in the capitol. Now that leadership in King's Landing is uncertain, it appears the Sparrows are growing in numbers in King's Landing. Lancel has joined them, attempting to atone for the various sins he thinks himself to have committed.

**Scene VIII: Loras' bed**

The only thing to note here is that Loras and Olyvar are discussing Dorne. This is one of the Seven Kingdoms, the very southernmost, mostly desert, and a new location that will appear this season.

**Scene IX: Manse of Illyrio Mopatis**

No notes to add to this scene, other than TYRION AND VARYS ROAD TRIP HYPE!!!

**Scene X: Meereen**

The man talking with Daario is [Hizdahr zo Loraq](http://i.imgur.com/LRt3a6i.jpg) (pronounced Hiz - darr), a Meereenese noble we saw last season. Hizdahr has just returned from [Yunkai](http://i.imgur.com/C520lRQ.jpg), where Dany freed the slaves and the Mhisa Mhisa scene happened. She previously sent him there to negotiate trade and other political relations with the rulers there. Yunkai is willing to work with her terms, but they demand one thing: that she allow the fighting pits to open once more for the entertainment of the people.

**Scene XI: The Wall**

Mance seems pretty stubborn and stupid here, so I'll take a moment to explain Wildling culture. Wildling is a catch-all term that includes all the clans and peoples north of the Wall. They each have unique cultures and customs, but the one thing that unites them is their independence. Each clan follows their own leaders, whoever they see as the best ruler. The Wildings follow a man because they respect him and he is strong, not because he has a certain last name and wants you to kneel to him. In fact, ""kneeler"" is a Wildling term for those south of the Wall. Mance has lived his whole life according to this principle, it is the essence of his being. He was able to unite 90 different Wildling tribes because he was strong and smart, and they respected him enough to follow him. Because of this, he cannot simply kneel down before Stannis because Stannis claims he is the King. It goes against everything that Mance stands for and has worked his entire life to achieve. And that's why he chose to burn.

I hope you guys enjoyed the added backstory. If you have any questions or want to add on yourself, feel free!",52,221,False,self,,,,,

However, on a positive note, with the TV Show going in a different direction, there will be deaths, new characters and even more shocks which makes Game Of Thrones so great for people who are non-readers in S 1-4.

Arthur is then brought up by a lesser family where he is loved but is clearly less as his natural-born foster brother Kay. I propose that this connects the popular theory that Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark are John's parents. Furthermore it also supports the theory that John is Azor Ahai. George R.R. Martin is known to draw from classic historical events and while the Arthurian legend is most likely fiction it is also semi-historical.

That leaves other north men or IMO the Greyjoys. Now I know that the Greyjoys have the whole ""we take what we want"" kind of thinking but wouldn't it make sense for Stannis to try and team up with the house that just got their butts kicked by the Boltons last season? Obviously because the Greyjoys are kind of stupid they might not agree but I still think Stannis should try

On the Boltons side I don't see any reliable allies for them. The whole north hates them for what they did at the RW. Can they rely on the Freys to help them I doubt it based on every thing we know about them. Even though Walder seemed friendly towards Roose after the RW. I guess that leaves the Lannisters but from Jamie's own mouth they have enemies waiting to strike now that Tywin is dead so IDK if they could come to help either.

So I have a few questions

1) Do the Boltons have any other allies to help them out that I missed or are they just ruling the north solo?

2) Do you think the Greyjoys would help Stannis?

3) Military wise who do you think is stronger right now Stannis or Boltons?",7,2,False,self,,,,,

The network has been bashed for sticking naked women into every shot it can find any reason to, however thin the plot justification, and maybe this is a sign that they're finally listening. Or maybe it's just Benioff and Weiss poking fun. Either way, Neil Marshall, who directed ""Blackwater"" back in Season 2, said he was uncomfortably muscled into shooting [sexualized female nudity](http://winteriscoming.net/2012/06/01/blackwater-director-neil-marshall-on-nudity-and-creating-the-battle/) into his episode by HBO executives, and I can't imagine he's alone among the many writers and directors.

Not that this is the first episode to have no gratuitous nudity, but the joke in the brothel made me think that maybe the overall lack of lip-licking naked supermodels in the premiere is a sign that HBO is finally responding to the criticism, and has realized at last that Game of Thrones can stand on its own without HBO's trademark ubiquitous naked women. And should stand on its own without them, frankly, because shamelessly hypersexualizing women cuts against so many themes in the book and the show.",0,1,False,default,,,,,

With the war over, most locations in Westeros wouldn't be safe for Sansa. 

* Across the narrow sea (e.g. Braavos). Definitely out of Cersei's reach, but the exact opposite direction of where they're heading. 
* Dorne. Also out of Cersei's reach, but going over land doesn't make much sense, since they'd have to go through King's Landing.
* The Iron Islands. Actually are west and out of Cersei's reach, but it seems unlikely Petyr has some political scheme with them.
* Somewhere north? The North is Sansa's home and would have many allies for her there. Littlefinger's long term plans for Sansa probably involve Winterfell. But the north is now controlled by the Boltons.

This is an issue that bugs me more than anything else, and it has nothing to do with the books.

This fucking show keeps introducing very compelling and interesting characters, giving them a *shit* ton of (brief) screen time, and then just **completely dumping** their character as if they never existed. Even Arya is omitting some of these characters from her kill list because they've grown so irrelevant in the show!

Examples:

- **Greatjon Umber**: Major player in Robb's rebellion. Most memorable personality among any of Robb's bannermen. Shortly before the Red Wedding, the guy just dips out and is essentially replaced as Robb's right-hand man by Roose fucking Bolton. Never hear from him again, despite the fact that Rickon and Osha are supposedly on their way to the Umbers. Which leads me to...

- **Rickon Stark**: The forgotten Stark child. Was supposed to be headed to safety at Last Hearth back in season 3, have heard nothing from him since then. 

- **Osha**: This girl got so much screentime and did such a great job that she even *convinced GRRM himself* to give her more stuff to do in the books. And yet, she scoops up Rickon, heads north, and two seasons later we've all forgotten they exist.

- **Gendry**: Just when you think Gendry's storyline has reached its purpose and is coming to an end by way of the Lord of Light, he's shipped off to sea by Davos Seaworth. Season 3 is his biggest season to date, and yet we haven't seen him since. Some say he's still rowing across that narrow sea.

- **Beric Dondarrion**: This guy was so important that he *came back from the dead. Multiple times.* He was re-cast after season 1, and the new actor put on a memorable performance. Yet now, the entire brotherhood has simply vanished from the show after being such an integral part of season 3. Thoros of Myr, Beric, Anguy, they're all gone.

- **Edmure/Brynden Tully**: The show sure did spend a lot of time introducing us to these characters and developing their personalities, only for them to go MIA after the Red Wedding. If they're not dead, why not fill us in on what they're up to?

- **Walder Frey**: This guy's only responsible for the single most heart-wrenching scene in television history, and yet the show did him no more justice than a few minutes in the succeeding episode. 

- **Illyrio Mopatis**: He is the reason Daenerys has dragons. He conspired to murder Ned Stark. Varys and Tyrion are *at his palace right now*. And yet... no sign of him anywhere.

- **Balon Greyjoy/Yara Greyjoy**: Boy, they sure did butcher this one. The entire Iron Islands storyline seems to be pretty much useless at this point. Was it all set up simply to give Theon some background story? I thought Balon actually planned on doing something useful?

What this show has done to so many promising characters with top-tier performances is an absolute tragedy. I understand there may not be enough airtime for all characters, but for a show that prides itself on murdering notable characters, it seems most of the character deaths are occurring off-screen.",145,152,False,self,,,,,

It's a picture of Tyrion and a dragon, so my theory is that eventually Tyrion will have one of Daenarys' dragons, yet that can't be possible because only Targaryens can have dragons.
However in Season 5 Tywin yells at Tyrion that he is no son of his.

Also Varys is helping Tyrion out quite a bit, even risking his life for him. He helped him escape and for that he exiled himself from King's Landing. I don't buy Varys' cheap excuse for helping Tyrion. He risked his own life just because Tyrion is a good and smart guy? It doesn't add up to me. 

I think Varys is a secret supporter of the Targaryens and knows about Tyrion's secret parentage, afterall he's the master of whisperers, so he'd likely know about it.

What I am getting at here is that Tyrion is a Targaryen and is about to get some **motherfucking dragons.**",4,0,False,self,,,,,

Varys is always talking about his duties to the realm and that being the root for his involvement in the game of thrones.  Take it at face value that he is being a selfless person.  Varys is of course also a eunuch and I wonder how much of a connection GRRM is making to the removal of the sexual organ as a removal of a part of a persons selfish intentions.  Theons penis removal, shown in the show (implied in the book) of course was depowering him from a prince of the iron isles and it made him as Reek behave in some selfless ways.  Another example of this are the unsullied, who also are completely selfless, that is also through years of training and social mind control.  Will Grey Worm's psychology be further explored here? These above examples all have come from across the world and still have wildly different journeys to take but I feel this common thread is being a guide line.  Are there any other notable eunuch characters or groups to be mentioned?

This and other topics are discussed on my podcast [Nerd Optimal](http://nerdoptimal.com/?p=174).  We also call Cersi Lannister one of the plastics from Mean Girls and give Kevan Lannister some praise after living in his brothers shadow.  Finally we pull back the curtain and look at the invincible institutions in Westeros: the Faith of the Seven, the Maesters of the Citadel, the Iron Bank of Braavos.  Bake up some lemon cakes, roast up a sausage and listen in if you're interested!

I betrayed Robert Baratheon. Who was the King. Who promised me pardon if I acted as his agent. Who wanted you dead. I stopped him. He gave me the pardon anyway because he did not know that I betrayed him. But I did.

I betrayed him the moment I laid eyes on you at your wedding. I decided, then and there, that I could not be the cause of harm to you. I decided instead to protect you.

Part of that protection was feeding information to King's Landing, so that information as to Robert Baratheon's intentions could be given back to me. When you know your enemy's actions, you can stop them. 

I never told you this, because I wanted to go on serving you. If I had told you, you would have sent me away. Now you want to send me away, at the urging of a man who was commanding Robert's Kingsguard on the day he decided to murder you. Did you attend that small council meeting, Ser Barristan? Did your keep yourself safely away? Did you register a noble protest, as Eddard Stark did?

Yes, I knew of that. The eunuch kept me well informed.

Never mind, Ser Barristan. I am sure you behaved honorably. But answer me this: if Cersei Lannister had not dismissed you from the Kingsguard, would you still be guarding the Usurper's son?

But you are prepared to pardon those who served Robert, who serve his sons, provided they come over to you. That is good. You will never sit on your ancestral throne if you do not do this. The whole of the Seven Kingdoms served the Usurper. You must pardon them. 

Ser Barristan did not spy on you. I did. You will have me gone. You do not like secrets. But there are so many secrets, Khaleesi. So many things you do not know.

Viserys never told you why Robert Baratheon rebelled against your father. He never told you why Eddard Stark and Jon Arryn joined him. He never told you why Tywin Lannister turned so bloodily against the king he had served for 20 years as Hand. He did not tell you these things, because he did not know them. He was just a boy.

But Ser Barristan knows. He was there.

So as my final act of service, Khaleesi, I counsel you to get the truth about your father from Ser Barristan. Get the truth about Rhaegar from him. Understand why your family fell from power. And then, if ever you return, you can prevent yourself from suffering the same fate.

I hope you do, Khaleesi. I hope you conquer and rule and grow old on the Iron Throne, surrounded by those you love. 

If that happens, then perhaps one day I'll receive a pardon from a living queen, instead of a dead king.

Farewell.""

Now if you want a more detailed description on the tournament, read the wall of text I'm about to type.


Let me start by saying idk how much spoilers will really be in this, I just did it to be safe. The post yesterday got a decent amount of attention and discussion so I figured I'd try it and if people think its fun and participate that's awesome, if it bombs it bombs, so let me start by painting a scenario for you.


So imagine you're at your house, your keep, your castle, some of you are at the nights watch. You get a raven saying you've been invited to the Westeros world fighting tournament(ie DBZ world tournament). You ride and sail your way there, you get a pamphlet/program showing you the matches. You get hyped for these matches, its all fun, yayyy.


After some inspection of the tournament that /u/spm615 showed me, it was very book heavy, had a lot of competitors, and they didn't seem to care much about seeding. Therefore I decided to make this one show based, as a book one leaves some of the visitors of this sub out as there would be people they don't know. I was in a skype call with a few friends who also watch GoT but haven't read the book and we chose 32 characters that we have either seen in combat or know have a history of extensive combat that we may not have seen. Honestly some of them were just thrown in to fill out the bracket, but we still decided to pick people with combat experience compared to fan favorite who arent big fighters like Arya and Tyrion.


What we decided to go off of is you judge these matches based on the fighters combat skills you see IN THE SHOW, as well as you can factor in everything we've heard about them. Example: Drogo has never been defeated, Barristan is known as the greatest fighter ever. 


Let me start by introducing the bracket to you: http://challonge.com/GoTT I dont know how mobile friendly that is so here's an imgur: http://i.imgur.com/4la86b1.png


Now, I know there may be some disagreement over the seedings, consider me and my 3 friends the selections committee, feel free to not like some of them. As only show watchers they were bias towards people across the narrow sea, as a book reader I tried to secure people like Barristan and Jaime higher spots but went with them as they were outvoting me. As for the state of the competitors just assume they're all at their best that you see them in the show. The only exception we made was we wanted season 1 Jaime and not 1 handed Jaime. So this isn't young rebellion Robert and Ned, thats why they have lower seeds, think of them fighting how they are in the show.


For the style of the matches, imagine they're held in Kings Landing in the fighting pit that Oberyn vs The Mountain took place: http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/149746/3872498-2236570936-game-.jpg


and imagine all fighters have their choice of their preferred weapon, ie Daario uses a arakh, Karl uses daggers. They can wear whatever armor you see them wear in the show. Jon, Ned, and Brienne all have Valyrian steel swords. Fights go on till ones dead or they yield.


I'll post 4 matches every day starting tomorrow as we make our way of the first round, remember to make your vote based on what you've seen in the show, and you can factor in the hype behind some characters but if you feel more strongly about how you've seen someone fight, just vote on who you think would win a straight 1on1. Put all favorite character biased aside, if we were voting for our favorite characters I'd have Sandor #1 seed and going all the way, and base your vote on who you legitimately think wins the fight in 1vs1 pit.


Thats about it, props to you if you read all that, I'll answer any questions you guys have and take any anger over the seeding, but hey if your guys as good as you think, he'll go all the way right? Thanks to anyone who read and anyone who participates in the voting, if it creates fun and discussion I'll be happy, if you guys hate every minute of it, at least I tried.",109,78,False,self,,,,,

Last season y'all book readers were going wild in anticipation to a certain scene expected yet failing to arrive at the last episode. It was supposed to be the ultimate mind blowing surprise of the series so far from what i gathered. You all thought it would be the perfect ending scene for the season.

Could you perhaps refer to it without elaborating into a spoiler? it's unknown to me and other non readers what it was supposed to be.

Should we still be expecting that or is it probably dropped out of the show? Can we look it up if it's dropped? Basically what's up with that.

It got me thinking about season one, in which Varys was integral in the attempt on Dany's life by revealing to Robert Baratheon that she was pregnant with Khal Drogo's baby. It got me thinking that this is quite contradictory.
Was this a ploy from Varys and Illyrio to create a motive for the Dothraki to cross the narrow sea with Viserys. As if the Dothraki's future king had been murdered by Robert then they would have a common interest. Basically Dany was just planned to be used as a pawn to gain Dothraki loyalty.
My only issue with this, is that I feel Viserys would have been terrible for the realm. And would have been an impetuous and dangerous king. So i doubt Varys would have been happy with a Targaryen Restoration at this point.

It has come to our attention that people posting in other subreddits are claiming that we have shadowbanned them. This is a false claim, as can be verified in [Reddit's FAQ regarding moderators](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_what_is_a_moderator.3F).

Relevant point,    

&gt;Moderators have no special powers outside of the community they moderate and are not appointed by reddit.

As to what a shadowban is-    
A shadowban is a site ban. It means you are barred from participating on any reddit.com subreddits, no one can hear you scream. These are handed out by admins and admins alone, they only do it for extreme cases and if you've received one, more than likely you deserved it.

We work with the admins, providing them with usernames of people who PM others spoilers, etc. Those people do get shadowbanned but for harassing users and *not* just for breaking our rules.

Trolls who create multiple accounts to spam the subreddit also get shadowbanned for ban evasion which is once again a sitewide rule.

#  What does this mean for the average user?

Absolutely nothing at all. If you are not harassing people or trolling the subreddit, then a shadowban is just out of question.

We do not ban people based on the subs in which they choose to post. This has never been the case.

&gt; I just got banned from /r/gameofthrones! Why would you do that without a warning?

From [the ban policy linked in the sidebar](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/wiki/bans),

&gt;Due to the high volume of traffic that /r/gameofthrones sees, especially during the spring when the show is airing, it is simply not possible for the moderators to issue a written warning to every user that breaks the rules. In the case of serious violations (spoilers, piracy and sexual objectification being the main ones), it is important to correct the offense as soon as possible and prevent the account from posting like that again. Bans can be issued without direct warning from a moderator as an immediate fix. Sometimes issues like that get out of hand in a thread where one bad post leads to another, and bans are the only way to stop the flow of bad posts.

&gt;&gt;#**How to Get Your Ban Lifted**    
&gt;&gt;&gt;As soon as it is reasonable, bans are reviewed in Moderator Mail. When a moderator trusts that a user understands the policies and will not break them again, that user's ban is lifted and a note is made on their account that they have been ""warned"" about the rules. This happens as soon as the banned user demonstrates knowledge/understanding of the policies, which can be as soon as minutes after the ban has been issued. If the moderator has to explain why a user was banned, the process will take longer than if the banned user can figure it out on their own.

---

A quick reminder, we have *not* changed our stance on the discussion of leaked episodes. Asking for links and/or linking to subreddits to find those links is against the rules. The reasoning behind this is we do not want the leaks to change how the subreddit works for a normal user, we do not mind if you have watched those episodes- you can discuss events in them provided you use the correct spoiler tags but linking to those episodes is out of the question. [See our rules on piracy.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/wiki/posting_policy#wiki_marketing_and_piracy)

And as always, remember, **bans are not personal**. We have no vendetta against you and you will almost always get your ban lifted once it is confirmed that you won't break the rules again. ***We do not care if you pirate the show. We only care if you pirate the show in /r/gameofthrones.***

I started wondering what the best season opener of the series was and I came to the conclusion that last season's ""Two Swords"" was by far the best. From the epic opening where House Stark's Valyrian sword is melted down to the ending where Arya gets her own horse after killing Poliver with the Hound. The camera pans out and we really start to the realize the scope of the destruction that the war of the Five Kings caused.

However, I have started to lose my mind with George R. R. Martin's World, and I have started to read the books, aswell. I have also been told that there are quite a few really good novellas like The Rogue Prince, for instance, and that they are good for people who want a more in depth look at this fictional universe.
So my question for you is: What is the recommended order to watch/read the content? I have been trying to start the series all over and read the books at the same time, in order to have better understanding of everything that happens, but perhaps I should read the novellas first? Also, is there any content not directed by George Martin worth looking for? Give me your tips and bear in mind that I have time and I want to know as much as possible, but not superfluously, about the world of Westeros and Essos.

Peter Dinklage is first and I think he has been for a while.  Jaime and Cersei are next.  There doesn't seem to be any logic to it.  If it were big names and bargaining power, I'd think Lena Headey would be 2nd.  Meanwhile Maisie Williams is far down on the list despite playing one of the main characters.

I assumed it would all come down to negotiations, but [this article](http://herocomplex.latimes.com/tv/game-of-thrones-peter-dinklage-goes-first-and-hopes-it-lasts/#/0) made it sound like Dinklage was surprised to find he was first and makes it sound like the producers just pick the order for how they see fit, suggesting it represents their roles on the show for any given season.

Given that I figured it was all negotiated, it made me think Dinklage was a bit of an asshole to ask for the top spot.  In these kinds of things it's usually standard to leave it alphabetical.

I'd love to hear if anyone else has more insight about how the billing on the show works.  ",18,6,False,self,,,,,

Bronn  - no particular reason, the shows creators love pulling the rug from underneath us and killing characters we like, and i think Bronn is a prime candidate

Jon Snow - It would really piss me off if they killed him like they do in the books, but they'll probably do it anyway (Jon and the mannis are the only 2 guys i like left :(.

Ser Barristan - I kinda feel like this character was just brought back to replace Mormont, but now hes kinda coming back, so, Barristan, as a character, is kind of redundant.

Ramsay + Roose - if they dont kill The mannis, these two will be dead for sure, to my pleasure

Given that they are supposed to be legendary warriors, is there any mention in the books of the Unsullied being able to fight with other weapons (swords, knives, bows, etc)?

This came to mind when watching the scene in S05E01 where a group of Unsullied march through Meereen's city passageways with their shields and spears. I'm not a historian, but have watched enough TV/movies to know that fighting in such close quarters with a long spear is almost certainly asking to be killed, either because you have no space to maneuver your spear or because your spear-wielding friend accidentally stabs/hits you due to lack of space. 

It just bothered me that they were marching along the passageways with spears that were more than twice as long as the width of the passageways. Do they have better weapon proficiencies in the books? The Persian Immortals (whom the Unsullied were probably modelled after) are described as carrying [""wicker shields, short spears, swords or large daggers, bow and arrow""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortals_%28Persian_Empire%29).


On a related note to the spears but not about the Unsullied,

 [WARNING: **MAJOR** **MAJOR** TV LEAK SPOILER!!!](#s ""Ok this is related to the Unsullied but I wanted to avoid spoilers through the context: That's probably why the Sons of Harpy were able to kill a squad of Unsullied + Grey Worm. The Unsullied had the wrong weapons for urban warfare while the Sons of Harpy utilized guerilla tactics and the right weapons. It seemed a little off to me that the Unsullied would patrol with spears - especially after they know how the Sons of Harpy kill. Also, if they really wanted to kill the Unsullied they should have done it in an even more confined space. The chamber they led the Unsullied into gave them some space to swing their spears."")

I found some on Amazon but they have a big logo on them for Game of Thrones, and I wish it was just the sigil and name of the house. Has anyone had any luck on Etsy or another similar site?

Something like [this](http://www.amazon.com/Game-of-Thrones-Martell-Banner/dp/B00M21TWAO/ref=pd_sim_hg_3?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=03EB47H2XAC58MGDFGTR) would be nicer than something like [this](http://www.amazon.com/Game-of-Thrones-Targaryen-Banner/dp/B00JLHH2M2/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1429209952&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=game+of+thrones+sigil).

You design it, we craft it!",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/32usad/no_spoilers_im_creating_a_kickstarter_for/,KDTREE5,1429221214,"OK lords and ladies of reddit. Let us know what you think of Weapons of Westeros. I am gauging interest here before I start the fund.

Game of Thrones fans around the world can now rejoice as they enjoy their very own GoT related weapons, armor, and props that they can design their selves in the comfort of their own home. 

Here at Weapons of Westeros we have always long admired the art of crafting and believe it is time to put that art to work for the community. 

With this pledge of $50,000 we will be making a design studio that is online based and interactive. You will be able to share and post your favorite designs in a community setting and get responses from other fans! If your design is nice enough people might even want it for themselves and with your permission we will reproduce your items and give you the original designer a commission.

Along with this studio we will also be hiring several staff members to accommodate the vast variations we will be allowing you to design. Anything from custom forged steel of the highest alloy available to items of clothing that will compare with show quality material.

Until we can secure rights to distribute HBO licensed products we will be running designs created solely by our users. We hope that within a short period of time we will be able to feature your favorite houses, character items, and props directly from the show itself.

We also realize that their are competitors in this market. We feel as if our project will be very different. We plan on featuring only the highest quality material (no stainless steel swords here). Having a community based design project we feel as if we are giving the power to the people of Westeros to design whatever they would like, instead of having something thousands of others have. 

Now we need your help to make that a reality. 

Our pieces will include but not be limited to:

Weapons: (Swords, Scabbards,  Axes, Shields, Spears, and Bows)

Armor: (Leather, Metal, Chain Mail)

Clothing: (Gowns, Dresses, Underclothing)

Other: (Wine Goblets, Mask, Necklaces, Rings, Chains and many more accents, custom thrones)

One main challenge will be for us to secure licensing from HBO. While we will be focused mainly around community design we very much would like to make replicas based on the show itself. Featuring everyone favorite characters and houses will be crucial to furthering our cause once we are started. 

Due to the variations pricing will be determined by us quoting each piece by itself. Every piece will be different therefore we will need to have our best hands at play. 

Finding craftsmen and workers to complete these task will also be a challenge. We plan on flying in the best from around the world to offer them a chance at helping you the viewers make Westeros as real as possible. Only the best and highest quality products will be produced.

MAKE YOUR OWN HOUSE AND CONQUER WESTEROS!

She had on the yellow clothes similar to what Oberyn wore, and back in those times, the Lannisters and Martells were still friendly.
Also I remember Oberyn telling Tyrion a story about him and Elia visiting the Lannisters and Cersei was telling them what a monster Tyrion was while he was still just a baby.

It doesn't make any difference to the story but I just thought it would be interesting if that was Elia.

I noticed something that seemed more evident this time around watching season 1. Drogo was so beastly, aggressive and limited emotionally when we were first introduced to him. He didn't seem to be able to have the ability to have a soft, gentle, loving relationship with anyone. After just one episode of Dany saying, essentially, ""No. No. Let me go on top,"" when Drogo initiates sex, they have now seemed to have fallen in love. They are now gentle and soft when they kiss each other. Even the act of kissing looks odd to me after watching a prior episode. I know that time must have passed and the show watchers don't get to see every little detail between Drogo and Dany but it still didn't seem right to me.

Likewise, I know there is a lot of material to cover in the show format, however this seems like quite a drastic jump for a character. For context, I'm only up to epsiode 3 season 1.

Does anyone know if in the books it took more time? Did this stand out to anyone else?

I found it so odd seeing Drogo gently kiss Dany in bed after watching just two episodes before him raping her as she cried.

Would love to hear others opinions on this character transformation (which I seemed to not really care about, or notice, the first time I watched.)

A quick reminder we're voting for them based on their peak ability IN THE SHOW! If we haven't seen them fight much you can base your judgement off of how they're talked about in the show as well as your own opinion on how you think they'd fight. This is all just for fun, its been well discussed that in a prime based tournament Dayne or Selmy wins.


Bracket: http://challonge.com/GoTT


Day 1 results: Khal Drogo vs Ramsay Snow: Drogo coasts out of the first round with an easy victory over Ramsay 482-33. Beric Dondarrion vs Jorah Mormont: Beric puts up a good fight but the former knight Jorah is too much for him as he takes the win 251-194. Oberyn Martell vs Lancel Lannister: The Red Viper of Dorne lives up to his high seed with a very expected first round win over Lancel 465-5. Thoros of Myr vs Jaqen H'ghar: Thoros isn't able to provide delight to his fans wanting his addition as he suffers a first round upset to lower seeded assassin Jaqen H'ghar 307-137.


Match 1: #8 Jaime Lannister(season 1) vs #25 Ygritte. [Vote here!](http://www.easypolls.net/poll.html?p=5530f5b1e4b0908d4e83b677) Ser Jaime comes into the first round a bit frustrated with his 8 seed believing he deserves higher, expecting a quick and easy victory over wilding Ygritte who's weapon of choice is a bow. Is she fast enough to keep away from The Kingslayer to get a shot off?


Match 2: #9 Tormund Giantsbane vs #24 Ser Meryn Trant [Vote here!](http://www.easypolls.net/poll.html?p=5530f4cbe4b0908d4e83b672) I myself pushed for a higher seed for Tormund as I felt his strength, unpredictability, and merciless attitude would push him to do well in this tournament. But does a wilding stand a chance against a member of the kingsguard himself in Ser Meryn Trant. Although The Hound put it straight saying ""any boy whore with a sword could take 3 Meryn Trants"". Was he right? Or does Tormund fall to Meryn in the first round?


Match 3: #7 Daario Naharis vs #26 Stannis Baratheon [Vote Here!](http://www.easypolls.net/poll.html?p=5530f70be4b0908d4e83b67a) Daenerys right hand man Daario has admitted he was famous for his talents in the fighting pits, and he took down Meereen's champion with one swing, but does all that stand up to the true heir Stannis? We saw some combat from Stannis in the battle at the Blackwater but is it enough to stand and bang with the former Lieutenant of the Second Sons?


Match 4: #10 Grey Worm vs #23 Theon Greyjoy [Vote here!](http://www.easypolls.net/poll.html?p=5530f7dde4b0908d4e83b67f) The man The Unsullied chose themselves to be their leader Grey Worm faces off against the last living son of Balon Greyjoy. Did Theon's years of learning from the Starks teach him enough to take out a man bred and prepared for almost nothing but combat?

""The question of so you can experience the story in it's true form is kinda a loaded one. Ya know, I've said a couple times or posted the riddle. How many children does Scarrlet O'Hara have? 

Scarrlet O'Hara has 3 children in Margret Mitchell's novel, Scarlet O'Hara has 1 child in the classic movie Gone With The Wind.

How many children does Scarlet O'Hara have, what's the true story? Of course the true story is Scarlet O'Hara has no children because she never existed. She's a fictional character and there are two wonderful classic ways of telling a story.

That maybe the situation.. that is the situation. The show is the show and the book is the book ya know. 

Who did Robb Stark marry? Did he marry a noble woman from Volantis named Talisa who died at the red wedding or did he marry a woman named Jayne Westerling who will be seen in the prologue of Winds of Winter. 

Is one true is one not true, well how many children did Scarlet O'Hara have?""

The witch gains credibility by predicting other events of Cersei's future correctly like when she says that Cersei will never have children with the king but he will have 20 children but she will have 3.  

After that scene there is an immediate cut to Margaery Tyrell which Cersei obviously sees as her immediate threat.  I think the witch was actually talking about Daenerys when she made that claim and Cersei is focusing her energy on the wrong person.  Cersei has proven herself to be smart and great at using her power to her advantage but her Season 2 power struggles with Tyrion also proves that she can be duped especially when she is not looking in the right direction.

My prediction is that Cersei gets her way with Margaery and absolutely crushes her and any power she hopes to obtain.  Margaery is good at the game but Cersei is better and probably more ruthless (obviously she has been up to this point but we have yet to see what Margaery is truly capable of since she hasnt really had her back up against the wall).  Cersei's obsession with Margaery will lead her to not look at other options nor heed the advice of people warning her about Daenerys' increasing power and that will be Cersei's downfall.",169,261,False,self,,,,,

I'm not sure if it's just my perspective but an awful ruler. I kinda feel that she's meant to be shown as a terrible ruler, given that her dragons don't like her anymore, the city is at unrest and she's supposed to be just a kid in the books, also her ridiculously long name (queen of the andals and the first men, etc.). I find she always chooses to take a strong stance when she shouldn't be and she's quite short-sighted. 

With all that, why would Varys support her? Does he really think she's be the ruler that would be the best for the realm? I just don't see someone as careful and calculated as Varys thinking that.

What do you guys think?

A quick reminder we're voting for them based on their peak ability IN THE SHOW! If we haven't seen them fight much you can base your judgement off of how they're talked about in the show as well as your own opinion on how you think they'd fight. This is all just for fun, its been well discussed that in a prime based tournament Dayne or Selmy wins.


Results: #8 Jaime Lannister vs #25 Ygritte: The Kingslayers speed and ability proves to be too much for Ygritte as he takes a clear win 379-48. #9 Tormund Giantsbane vs #24 Meryn Trant: Being a member of the kings guard isnt enough for Meryn as only falls to a manbeast with a sword in Tormund Giantsbane 346-37. #7 Daario Nahaaris vs #26 Stannis Baratheon: Stannis puts up a fight with the closest score of the day but still isn't enough for Daenerys boy toy as he falls 298-112. #10 Grey Worm vs #23 Theon Greyjoy: The Starks tried to teach Theon well but not enough for a man bred for combat as Grey Worm takes the most dominant victory of the day 387-16.

Match 1: #4 The Mountain vs #29 Locke [Vote here!](http://www.easypolls.net/poll.html?p=55326fabe4b0908d4e83b8b6) The biggest strongest man in this tournament steps in for his first round match up against the Bolton army reject Locke.


Match 2: #13 Ser Loras Tyrell vs #20 Karl Tanner [Vote here!](http://www.easypolls.net/poll.html?p=5532703be4b0908d4e83b8b7) Karl was a fookin legend in Gin Alley as he looks at add another victim to his list, we saw him getting the best of Snow until outside interference, but is it enough to keep up with one of the most talented more technically sound and IMO underseeded Loras?


Match 3: #3 Ser Barristan Selmy vs #30 Yara Greyjoy [Vote here!](http://www.easypolls.net/poll.html?p=553270bce4b0908d4e83b8b8) One of the fan favorites Ser Barristan enters the arena to make quick work of his first round match up Yara.

Does the student dethrone the teacher? Or if Ned comes out on top is it considered an upset? We've seen a lot of talent from Jon Snow at the wall, but is it enough to hang the honourable Ned Stark?

But when Robert orders Dany to be assassinated, Varys doesn't do anything to stop it.  Jorah made his own choice to save her without Varys knowing.

* She gets close to Joffrey. She and her grandmother insert her as queen.
* She works Joffrey to the point where he's less cruel with her. She can charm him into minor concessions and almost makes him human.
* She realizes while a marriage to Joffrey would make her queen it would be extremely difficult for her as Joff is tough to handle and may prove impossible as he gets older.
* She gets Sansa's confidence, tells her she would like them to become friends. 
* She brings Sansa into a circle of trust, uses her as a mule to smuggle poison into the wedding and frames her and Tyrion for murder. 

Even if Littlefinger and/or her grandmother devised this plan, you basically have Margaery complicit in the murder of a king at his wedding (through really horrible means), along with framing a completely innocent girl (who she provided motive to) and the King's uncle, who has only really tried to do well for the realm since the show started. 

Margaery seems to get a pass, but she manipulated Renly and jumped ship when it was convenient. Then she manipulated Joffrey and had him killed. Now she's manipulated Sansa and her husband Tyrion to take the fall. Seems like she gets a big pass from a lot of fans, when she's really not been very honorable.

First it seems that Tywin totally despises Tyrion and wishes him dead. Then he appoints him as Hand of the King during the battle against the North. I would think this means Tywin recognizes certain qualities of his son. At least he trusts him to make big decisions, doesn't he? But then after the death of King Joffrey, Tywin does all he can to manipulate the trial against his son, knowing perfectly well that he was only a scape goat.  Now this contradicts to what Tywin did earlier; he said that on the day Tyrion was born, he wanted to leave Tyrion in the wild and let him die, but stopped at it because Tyrion was a family member. However unwillingly, Tywin always protects his family. So why did Tywin try to kill him in the end? Also worth noting, at a time Tyrion asks his father to promise Casterly Rock to him, Tywin was clearly furious about it. He says something about Tyrion would humiliate the family name if he inherited the castle. But that did not stop Tywin from naming his son Hand of the King, even though that was only temporary.

My thought on this is that, being larger than the continental USA, how in the seven hells does this massive land not fall apart into distinct kingdoms/nations all the time. I mean, the targaryens ruled for 300 years. It seems astonishing that one single family could unite such a large landmass for so extensive a time period. With the primitive technology of the day, not to mention the feudal nature of Westeros, I find it hard to grasp how King's Landing could successfully hold onto the many disparate lands.

This is all just for fun, its been well discussed that in a prime based tournament Dayne or Selmy wins.


Bracket: http://challonge.com/GoTT


Day 3 results: The Mountain vs Locke: The Mountain surges out of round 1 with an easy win over Locke 341-6. Ser Loras Tyrell vs Karl Tanner: The fookin legend of Gin Alley tried his best with his daggers but could stand to the knighted Loras as he falls 263-71. Ser Barristan vs Yara Greyjoy: Barristans old age doesn't look a factor in round one as he crushes Yara 328-4. Jon Snow vs Ned Stark: In one of the more anticipated matches of round 1, Jon Snow tries to hang with the big names in a close match but falls to his experienced father as Ned comes away with the upset(at least seed wise) 212-143.



Match 1: #5 Brienne of Tarth vs #28 Joer Mormont [Vote here!](http://www.easypolls.net/poll.html?p=5533ecabe4b0f84e696c99e5) Brienne has proven to be one of the best combatants in the show with numerous victories but can she stand to the long time Lord Commander of the Nights Watch in Joer Mormont?


Match 2: #12 Bronn vs #21 Ser Alliser Thorne [Vote here!](http://www.easypolls.net/poll.html?p=5533ed41e4b0f84e696c99e7) We saw Alliser in combat during the wildings march on Castle Black, and we've seen Bronn win 1on1 against a Knight of the Vale, but is Bronn's anything to win attitude enough to stand with one of the longest time rangers at the wall?


Match 3: #6 The Hound vs #27 Robert Baratheon [Vote here!](http://www.easypolls.net/poll.html?p=5533ee16e4b0f84e696c99ed) When asked if he should be competing in the tournament as the king due to his safety he replied ""Piss on that! I wanna hit somebody!"" but is The Hound the man he wants to be hitting?


Match #4: #11 Syrio Forel vs #22 Robb Stark [Vote here!](http://www.easypolls.net/poll.html?p=5533ef29e4b0f84e696c99f2) We haven't seen much of The King in the North at all but Jon Snow has said Robb was better than him at everything. Was he better at sword fighting as well? Even if he was, is it enough to stand to The First Sword of Braavos that took on 3 kingsguard and Meryn Trant by himself, with nothing but a stick?

I'm going to assume that S5 will follow ADWD fairly closely, meaning that all of the major events of ADWD will occur in S5.

Will he finally run into Daenerys (in a more 'proper way' than in ADWD)? Will she trust him and accept him into her court? How will he react to finally meeting one of the dragons he has so often dreamed about (for the book readers, we know he eventually sees one up close)? Will he encourage Dany to fight his own family?

Will he seek out Tysha? I suspect if he did, he would ask Varys to help as he has his spies all over the damn place. How will she react to him? Since he and Sansa never consummated their marriage, I suppose he could marry Tysha again... Although I don't think there is a system for divorce in Westeros.

What else is in Tyrion's future?

I only had gotten through the first sequence of the game, up to where the game's version of the show intro plays.  I ended up blowing the whole first episode in one session.

Let me preface this by saying that while Ramsay Snow is certainly not someone I like, I can still see why he tortured the ever living hell out of Theon.  For starters, Theon was considered a turncloak and an enemy of the entire north, which includes the Boltons.  Ramsay wanted revenge for not only deceiving Robb Stark, but also because he and most everyone thought he killed Bran and Rickon.  In addition, being bastard-born, Ramsay wants the approval of his father Roose even more.  Ramsay wants to show his father that he is a Bolton just like his papa, hoping that it will better his father's view of his illegitimate son.  In this respect, while I do not like Ramsay, he did not get the ultimate hate from the pit of my soul that Joffrey got, and I didn't even think he was as bad as Viserys.

Anyway, my progression in the game had gotten me to the point where young Lord Ethan Forrester was welcoming Ramsay Snow in the great hall of the Forrester's castle. For the love of me I can't remember the name of it, but anyway my plan was to offer Ramsay a piece of the forest where they grow their special wood in exchange for him leaving us alone.  Even when he was planning to take half the forest and give it to Lord Whitehill, I figured it was better than being completely plowed through by the Bolton's army.  

AND THEN HE STABS ETHAN.  This backstab was second to only the Red Wedding for me (which I'm pretty sure is everyone's biggest shocking moment).  But this death hit me harder than anything else besides that.  The worst part was that Ramsay kept that damn smirk of his on his face and didn't think it mattered that he murdered a lord that also happened to still be a young boy.  He knew he was going to get no repercussion for it, and he loved that fact. Now I hope Ramsay dies some horrible terrible death comparable or even worse than Joffrey.  Props to the TTG for being just as shocking as George RR Martin.

TL;DR: Played episode 1 of Telltale Games Game of Thrones game, didn't like Ramsay Snow but didn't hate him from the books and show.  Ramsay kills young lord who is also controllable character and I now have blood-curdling hatred for him.",2,0,False,default,,,,,

  Brianne meeting Littlefinger &amp; Sansa  
  No Arianne Martell  
  Mance is ""dead""    
etc....

Ser Meryn asks the two men if they are trying to deceive their Queen and if Cersei wants them thrown into the Black Cells. She says no and that she doesn't want to dissuade any of the other hunters. Now, I assume that any information given out about Tyrion, including his physical features aside from just being a dwarf, would be given out to those wanting to collect their Lordship and I imagine that scar on his face would be in that description. 

So, who cares, but were the two guys actually trying to be deceptive? Did they make that mark on the unfortunate dwarf's face either before, or after, lopping off the head? The hair was similar to Tyrion's, and the guys were seemingly not educated enough to know that the wound wouldn't heal posthumously. Not to mention, it was on the wrong side of the face altogether.

Arya has revenge.

I watched season 1 and instantly got hooked, then decided to read all the books before I watched anymore of the show. Now I'm all caught up, and completely prefer the books to the show. With the show going in a different direction (but from what I've heard having a very similar ending), are book readers still watching the show? I've now watched the first 2 episodes from season 5 and the changes just kind of put a bad taste in my mouth. 

With the show runners knowing the ending, I'm assuming that people they decide to kill off in the show will not play a part in the end of the books, so does that make anyone else hesitant to continue to watch the show? I would hate to know what happens in the end before GRRM writes it, but I would also hate to have something spoiled by reading it online. It just seems like spoilers are unavoidable.

What are everyone else's thoughts on this? Is it just me being paranoid?

It would have been a moment where more fans of the show may begin to start liking Stannis more because of this offer. However, the quick cut to the election for Lord Commander negates the significance of the proposal. 

Are Beinoff and Weiss consciously making choices in regards to the direction of the show for the audience to like certain characters and dislike others? Some of the changes in Stannis storyline portray him more in a villainous way than the books ever did.

I gave this a lot of thought and debated about it. 

So why did she execute him? 

She had to. As the queen, she is the law. The ex-slave broke the law when he killed a man awaiting trial. By breaking the law, he defied her and she had to punish him. The punishment was death. That part is pretty clear cut. The interesting part is why she did it in such a public manner.

She had to make an example of him to the other former slaves. The ex-slave killed the Son of Harpy and displayed his body in a very public manner and made it very obvious who did it. Word would have gotten out and spread. If the people saw no harm or punishment come to the transgressor, they might have felt that they too were justified in killing their former masters or anyone they suspected of being a Son of Harpy. This would have caused further strife and chaos among her people. She promised them freedom and justice and she made good on her promise. The law now sees the former slaves and former masters as on equal footing. She had to show them that the law will treat them equally, whoever they are and that the former slaves are not exempt from following it. 

And also don't forget that Dany is just a very empathetic person. She felt that she owed the former slaves an explanation as to why she was executing one of their own. 

Isn't she just mirroring Robb Stark and his mistake with the Karstarks? 

Don't forget that Robb was still in the middle of a war and his position was very unstable as the King in the North. At this point, Dany has already conquered Mereen and well established herself as its Queen. Robb hasn't even really won the crown at that point, Dany has. Now the question is if she can keep it.

side note:  would Cersei even be ok with Jaime's decision?  considering his relationship with Tyrion she definitely wouldn't trust him.

I feel as though it is necessary as it's a different medium for storytelling and given the catch-up to the books the writers need to create plot or surpass the books.  

This being said, as I was watching tonight I couldn't help but feel as though that a lot of this ""filler plot"" I feel as though they are creating (e.g. Jaime and Bronn going to Dorne, for example) might be coming at the expense of some fundamental storylines from the books which I hope they don't ignore.  I know a lot of people have wanted to see Lady Stoneheart (which mixed sources say will/won't be in the show) but I'd be much more inclined to see the development of House Greyjoy, and the kingsmoot.  If I remember correctly, a few seasons ago we saw Melisandre use the King's blood (via Gendry) to cast her spell on the ""false kings"" - I don't recall if Balon was included in this.  If he was, he would be the only ""false king"" still living in the show universe (unless he died and I forgot).

I understand that it's early days and this may be all included later on in the season or future seasons but I just hope that House Greyjoy is not forgotten.  I also understand it is hard to have a large ensemble cast, many locations and still deliver a clear narrative within a ten hour season within a set budget.

I'm a show watcher (on book 2 though and gaining ground) but as far as I know there's nothing in the books about why the Titan wields a broken sword. On the net I've found the following kinds of speculation:

-----------------------------------------

&gt; Maybe it's a lot simpler than all that, the Titan is Braavos itself, and the sword he's wielding represents their defiance to Valyria. The sword is Valyrian steel, which is much stronger than regular steel, and Braavos has broken it, and made a monument to their success.

&gt; Or it could just be something that I remember reading somewhere - the broken sword represents the inability of their opponents to take the city.

(The entire text can be found [here](http://www.quora.com/Why-does-the-Titan-of-Braavos-wield-a-broken-sword) for those interested.)

---------------------------------

Obviously there's the Braavosi connection. They both symbolise the warrior spirit of Braavos. Braavos as a city is known to be impenetrable anyway.

I don't really know what I'm getting at here if anything, but at the very least it could be further evidence that Syrio is alive. That he's unbeatable, even with his broken sword.

Apologies if anyone read my previous post spoiling something from the show*




With the exception of Lord Commander and Maester there are characters with titles even after swearing to The Wall.

*Ser* Alliser Throne

*Ser* Jaremy Rykker

*Ser* Waymar Royce - Seen in the very first episode.

Even *Lord* Janos Slynt the coward is still called Lord by Jon and I assume others.

I have also read all 4 books and am currently half way through the 5th (A Dance with Dragons) and so it is shown within the ASoIaF series. *If you wish to discuss the books please use spoiler tags*. 

Here is the Brotherhood's Oath;
**Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.** As [r/PhoxPhucker](http://www.reddit.com/user/PhoxPhucker) pointed out in the previous post, it doesn't specify as to drop or forswear their titles. Yet it is known that former titles are forsaken, thus given everyone a fair go to climb the ranks.

So why do some get to keep titles?

This is all just for fun, its been well discussed that in a prime based tournament Dayne or Selmy wins.


Bracket: http://challonge.com/GoTT


Day 4 results: Brienne of Tarth vs Jeor Mormont: Brienne proves to be too much for Lord commander as she makes it to the sweet sixteen 285-43. Bronn vs Ser Alliser: Bronn's honorless combat gets him the victory 287-29. The Hound vs Robert Baratheon: King Robert puts up the closest match of the day but should cut down on his whoring and drinking as he falls to The Hound 238-82. Syrio Forel vs Robb Stark: The King In The North shows what he can do but it isn't enough as he falls to Syrio 285-42.


Match 1: #1 Khal Drogo vs #17 Jorah Mormont [Vote here!](http://www.easypolls.net/poll.html?p=55352243e4b0908d4e83c286) This is one of two matches today that might make Daenerys not wanna watch as we get to see the #1 seed in action again against maybe his first true challenge of the tournament. We saw Jorah take out a member of the dothraki army rather easily with intelligent use of his armor, but does his experience and swift thinking stand him up against the leader of the khalsar? Daenerys may watch in nervousness as her sun and stars Drogo takes on the jealous friend zoned Jorah.


Match #2: #8 Jaime Lannister vs #9 Tormund Giantsbane [Vote here!](http://www.easypolls.net/poll.html?p=55352309e4b0908d4e83c287) We get to see The Kingslayer in action again as he faces off against Mance Rayder's right hang man in Tormund Giantsbane. We know Jaime is one of if not THE best technically sound 1v1 swordsman in the show, at least from what people say. Maybe people just love to over praise a famous name? Can Jaime walk by Tormund easily and advance to the Elite Eight, or is this match closer than people think?


Match #3: #2 Oberyn Martell vs #18 Jaqen H'ghar [Vote here!](http://www.easypolls.net/poll.html?p=553523bbe4b0908d4e83c289) #2 seeded Prince of Dorne made short work of his first round matchup with the most one sided victory in round 1 and Jaqen got by higher seeded Thoros, but does his assassin hype train get derailed here by the red viper? 


Match #4: #7 Daario Naharis vs #10 Grey Worm [Vote here!](http://www.easypolls.net/poll.html?p=55352437e4b0908d4e83c28a) The second match that may make Daenerys watch in worry as her boy toy faces off against the leader of The Unsullied in round 2. So Daario has a history in the fighting pits and was a famous name, but Grey Worm has been trained day and night for combat and plans to show the wrath of the unsullied with a victory over Daario and a spot in the Elite Eight. Can Grey Worm make the ruins of Astapor proud and take our Lieutenant Daario, or does Daario take out Grey Worm after a wink at Daenerys.


Thats all for today! Come back tomorrow for matches S, T, W, X and we'll be onto the Elite Eight after that! Thanks so much for voting! Hosting this has been awesome!",17,27,False,self,,,,,

So far on the show, counting last night, there have been 5 public beheadings if I'm remembering correctly - Ned beheading the NW deserter, Joffrey beheading Ned, Theon beheading Rodrik Cassel, Robb beheading Rickard Karstark, and now Dany beheading the slave. In the first episode, Ned Stark makes very clear his philosophy on death sentences, that he who passes the sentence must swing the sword. After that, the use of a headsman is an indicator of character and fairness as a leader. Joffrey did not behead Ned himself - he had Ilyn Payne do that. However, Robb and Theon both followed Ned's advice, though Theon botched his while Robb made one clean slice. Dany, like Joffrey, used a headsman, as Daario, not her, beheaded the slave. Just some food for thought. 

Also, all indications point to a beheading coming up real soon that's firmly rooted in Ned's philosophy, which makes for an interesting contrast with the recent events (trying not to be too spoilery, even thought I put a spoiler tag). ",5,5,False,self,,,,,

---

#Mr Jaqen No Here

&gt; *Jaqen H'gar? Nobody here by that name* - Jaqen H'gar, still mentally stuck in the book version of the events

* During her journey to Braavos, Arya befirended the whole crew of the *Titan's Daughter*. All sailors have insisted on Arya learning their name and were clearly afraid of her. It is not yet explained why.
* The doors of the House of Black and White are made of ebony and weirwood. The building is also referred to as the Temple of the Many-Faced God, and you might have noticed various idols inside it.
* Book version: The House of Black and White is open to everyone, there is nobody turning Arya down. Instead of Jaqen H'gar, she encounters a man with a yellow skull instead of a face, with a white worm in one of his eye holes. When he asks her to kiss him, she not only does that, but also tries to bite the worm. In that moment, his face changes to the one of the kindest old man Arya has ever seen, and he says that nobody has ever tried to eat the worm before.
* Yeah, they just brought back the recognized and liked actor. As a matter of fact, in *A Feast of Crows*, Jaqen H'gar is in another place entirely (Oldtown in the Reach), which isn't even stated outright - a man very much similar in presence to the one who left  Arya outside of Harrenhal appears by the end of the prologue of AFFC, killing the prologue's POV character (narrator always dies by the end of the prologue), a novice in the Citadel named Pate.

#The Plotweaver Inn

&gt; *My lady... Sansa Stark* - Podrick Payne, burning the bridge for two whole POV plotlines in *A Feast of Crows*

* There's a point where I should have stopped repeating ""It wasn't in the books"" mantra and we're clearly past it, but let's keep going and see what happens.
* GOOD GOD THIS IS TOTALLY NOT IN THE BOOKS. Basically, as I've said last week, two of the most boring AFFC storylines - Sansa's and Brienne's - have been nuked and are being rewritten from scratch.
* We've already surely skipped all the boring Brienne parts, including but not limited to investigating the family of ser Dontos (the knight made fool who gifted Sansa the necklace with the poison), so no harm done there. I'll sum up her book storyline once I make sure we're not revisiting any of its points - even though everything points to the whole thing being ditched, even the final chapter, which unlike all the previous ones made her story actually intriguing. But even that point might be scrapped, as the show seems to have written out one of the most shockingly supernatural elements in it. Let's just say it's somewhat connected to Thoros of Myr, the red priest with flamesword wielding holy-zombie buddy Beric Dondarrion.
* Next week, we tackle on Sansa's development in Eyrie. Which lasts the whole book, so maye it's a good thing we're not having it adapted.
* Oh and this is the moment where I play the card ""Any plot holes or awkwardness in character interactions might be explained by the total contradiction of the book story"". So all your ""Is Littlefinger that careless and stupid?"" and ""Is Brienne a brainless berserker?"" questions might be answered with ""Yes, the show version of them are"".
* The show plotline holds by its own rules, though: Sansa's disdain towards Brienne is fueled by her inactivity during Joffrey's wedding feast. In the books, Jaime and Brienne did not make it to Joffrey's wedding in time. Paired with Littlefinger's visit to Renly's camp, another scene not present in the books, it sums up to ""Well, it makes sense in its own way"". The show continuity is surprisingly consistent within its own borders.
* Oh and by the way Sansa has her great uncle Brynden ""Blackfish"" Tully in Riverrun. He escaped the Red Wedding before the massacre has began. His nephew and Sansa's uncle Edmure Tully is under house arrest in the Twins.

#Things Went South

&gt; *I'll make things better. I'm going to Dorne* - Jaime Lannister, in a yet another meta comment straight from the scriptwriter's workshop

* You thought we're done with show-only content? Think again! TV Jaime is heading the exact opposite direction than his book counterpart - instead of going north to pacify the Riverlands, he's now going south, to Dorne.
* How does it make sense? Cuts. Having Jaime in Dorne instead of Riverlands allows the showrunners to avoid having to film the Lannister camp and Riverrun (that's location cuts), casting Jaime's extended family and bannerman (that's character cuts), bringing in Blackfish and Freys for this season (cuts, cuts, cuts), and finally, Jaime's journey replaces another Kingsguard who was in Dorne, protecting Myrcella (cuts!) Basically that single decision has saved an immense amount of resources while coming to a fairly similar developments in Dorne.
* In case you don't remember, Myrcella has been sent off to Dorne after Tyrion's game in season 2 during his service as Hand of the King: he wanted to check who can be trusted, so he tipped Varys, Littlefinger and Pycelle about a marriage proposal. The proposal had three different versions, and since it was the maester Pycelle who revealed his version to Cersei, it was Myrcella who got engaged.
* Lollys Stokeworth (the book one) is a mentally challenged girl in her late teens who got raped and pregnant during the riots in King's Landing (season 2). Her engagement to Bronn was set to make sure someone takes care of her child... and that's pretty  much the last time we see Bronn. The show has decided to exploit the much liked actor one season more, and made him the sparing partner to Jaime (in the books it's ser Ilyn Payne, the mute executioner).
* We'll speak more of Dorne next time, I guess. For now, repeating the short note: the Dorne wasn't one of the Seven Kingdoms after Aegon's Conquest, as they resisted the Targaryen invasion and joined the realm through marriage years later. This allowed them to retain their traditional terminology, calling their sovereign ""prince"". Another noteworthy cultural difference is the Rhonyar inheritance: women inherit before their younger brothers (in Westeros, men inherit before their sisters regardless of age).
* Prince Doran Martell is sitting in the chair because of his gout. We'll hopefully learn more about him later in the season.
* The guard, Areo Hotah, is the POV (Point of View) character of the very first chapter set in Dorne.

#Let Justice Be Done, Though The Heavens Fall

&gt; *HSSSSSSSSSSS* - the new way to react to any element of the show you don't like, coined on 4chan's /tv/ board on the day of the leak

* It's difficult to approach Dany's storyline in these followups because we've been going through the ADWD material from the moment Daenerys decided to settle in Meereen, and scenes are being adapted in a seemingly random order. This means that I can't bring up any extra information about Meereen from the books, since I can't possibly know if they won't be covered in the show at a later point. And that would be spoiling.
* Backstory then! ""He murdered sons in front of their fathers"" - Barristan has a very specific event in his mind. When Rhaegar Targaryen disappeared with Lyanna Stark, her brother Brandon came to King's Landing to ask for explanation and demand that Lyanna returns home. However, Rhaegar and Lyanna weren't in King's Landing, and the Mad King threw Brandon and his company into black cells under charges of conspiracy against the crown prince. He then summoned their fathers to answer for their crimes. they were all executed, but Rickard Stark, father to Brandon, Eddard, Lyanna and Benjen, exercised his right to trial by combat. Aerys granted him that request, but named that the champion of Targaryens will be fire. Rickard was burned alive in wildfire, while Brandon was left before him, with a rope around his neck and a sword just out his reach. Trying to get to the sword, Brandon pulled the rope too tight and suffocated. As the Mad King ordered Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon to come to King's Landing, the immediate effect was the rebellion.

#Are We There Yet

&gt; *You're right, no point* - Tyrion, this time commenting on how this scene is just as good for plot progression as Gendry's hypotetical monologue while on a rowboat.

* Tyrion's journey will be covered more extensively some time in the future as it gets to a common point with the book version. Again, we've suffered a cut in the cast, this time losing a very promising characters from this season, and maybe even the whole show altogether. It involves travelling under the name ""Yollo"".
* This one time we're using the scarcity of things to dwelve upon in Tyrion's scene with the marvelous transitions between the scenes (King's Landing -&gt; Dorne, road to Volantis -&gt; King's Landing) to break the usual location-by-location format. Small council now!
* Master of Ships is an empty title after the battle of Blackwater, which has left the whole royal navy in pieces and ashes. The iron men are busy pillaging the shores of the North and Stannis is away at the Wall, which means navy is not a concern for the capital at the moment. It wasn't an ampty title when Balon Greyjoy rebelled against Robert Baratheon a decade ago, but even then the title of Master of Ships belonged to Stannis Baratheon, which translated to splendid results (he crushed the Iron Fleet) and no recognition (Robert and Ned took all the glory for taking the main islands).
* The book version of the small council is a bit less... small, and again, removing unnecessary characters has trimmed down the cast. It sums up to ""Cersei appoints weak, irrelevant men who she can easily control"".
* Book Tommen is a plump, 10 year old kid. Show Tommen might be more interesting than that, although certainly not as adorable.

#The Blind Luck

&gt; *You have no idea what people will do. All your books and you still don't know* - Selyse Florent, hitting us readers where it hurts

* As of now, we have effectively closed out the entirety of *A Storm of Swords*, barring the epilogue (which, however epic, might never get adapted in accordance with keep-the-supernatural-down policy).
* There are two chapters being adapted here. One is Jon's, and ends with Stannis's offer, and one is Samwell's and describes his scheme behind the election.
* Greyscale doesn't have a real-world equivalent by medical standards, but it's treated like leprosy due to the lethalithy of a similar sickness, the grey plague. When Grand Maester Pycelle was young, the disease has struck Oldtown, wiping out half of the city and majority of the Citadel. People who survive grayscale like Shireen are immune to grey plague.
* The show didn't do justice to the choosing and Samwell's ploy. It's actually Janos Slynt, not Alliser Thorne, who's being suggested by King's Landing as the Lord Commander.
* The choosing runs similarly to the conclave (choosing of the Catholic Pope), which means a candidate needs two thirds of the votes in order to win. the longest choosing in history of the Night's Watch has lasted for two years.
* Faced with the possibility of voting Slynt, the choosing becomes a deadlock between commanders of the outposts that mark the ends of the Wall: the Shadow Tower and Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. Candidates - Cotter Pyke and Denys Mallister - have both deserved the title of the Lord Commander, but dislike each other and their conflict stalls the vote.
* Stannis is irritated that the choosing has been in deadlock for days, and maester Aemon suggests that Sam remedies the situation. Janos Slynt comes to Stannis and suggests he should force the Watch to elect him into Lord Commander.

&gt; *Stannis ground his teeth. It is not my wish to tamper with your rights and traditions. As to royal guidance, Janos, if you mean that I ought to tell your brothers to choose you, have the courage to say so.*  
*That took Lord Janos aback. He smiled uncertainly and began to sweat, but Bowen Marsh beside him said, Who better to command the black cloaks than a man who once commanded the gold, sire?*  
*Any of you, I would think. Even the cook. The look the king gave Slynt was cold.*

* In the end, Samwell goes for the same plan that got John Paul II elected Pope: he introduces a new candidate (Jon Snow) to break the deadlock, playing off the commanders of the side outposts and convincing them to cede their votes towards Jon.
* At the last choosing, Jeor Mormont's raven files in, squeaking ""Snow, snow, snow"". That seals the deal and Jon wins by a landslide. Drop curtain, *A Storm of Swords* is almost finished after its ridiculous murdering spree. Oh and in the last chapter Lysa reveals that Littlefinger was behind Jon Arryn's death. And then there's epilogue.

Overall, even though I'm still salty to the highest degree about some characters that were cut, the show seems to have a very solid idea how to approach the clusterfuck also known as AFFC/ADWD. Even if the idea isn't perfect, at least it works.

#Bonus: Poll

I've been offered to move this series to an external site. A quite small one. What this means for you is better visual formatting (plus pictures), what this means for me is possible monetization (although I won't believe it till I see it, the website is fairly small). The downsides are no reddit comments directly under the wall-of-text (there's always Disqs, though) and ads in general (which I can't even vouch for, because I'm an economically insensitive poor twat and use Adblock everywhere).

The outcome of this poll will not be binding, but [please vote](http://strawpoll.me/4170918), as I highly value your opinion on it.

3) Dany chose to put him on trial.

My friend and coworker is one of those people. Every other day she seems to send me texts of a novel length complaining of plot and character changes. For instance the omission of a few key Dorne characters. So far I haven't heard if the Iron Islands stuff will be put into the show. Then there is the fact that a month or two ago Martin himself stated that characters would die this season that are still alive in the books.

Well lets all take a moment and remember one thing. The show runners know the overall ending of the series. 

So what if the reason plots are being changed, characters are being deleted from the show altogether, and characters are being killed off too early is because they don't contribute to the finale of the series? Maybe the show runners want to do some trimming so they can make room for screen time for plots and characters that actually do effect the end? 

That is just my two cents and the only reason I could think of for the show to be changing so much. ",1,4,False,self,,,,,

Today I'd actually like to dive into something we could have covered at any point since season 3, but have never had a chance to fit it in.   Over the past couple of years we have seen Dany travel through the city states of Astapor, Yunkai, and Mereen, freeing slaves and upsetting the customs of those who live there.... But what are those customs, what are they founded upon, why does this group calling themselves ""The Sons of the Harpy"" challenge her rule in favor of the old way?  Well I hope to answer a couple of those questions as today we will be covering a brief history into the oldest known civilization in all of George R. R. Martins ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" and that of the Ghischari and the former Ghiscari Empire..

- Note on Spoiler Scope

As custom before we continue we must establish what the spoiler scope of this post.  This post will deal almost entirely of backstory, so it is completely non-reader safe. I tagged the post for both Seasons 5, as well as ADWD to enable discussion in the comments for spoilers covering up to where we are in the show, as up to where the show is in the books, so there's that... One small deviation I will mention a few names that exist within ADWD that are not within the show, but I will not elaborate on those characters importance, or plot points from ADWD..  With that being said let us begin..


------------------------------------

**The rise and fall of a millennia old empire** 

- Birth of Civilization and the Dominance of the Ghiscari Empire..

Several civilizations are said to have existed in ancient times, during the time that the Long Night touched not only the First Men of Westeros, but even that of peoples across the narrow sea, some civilizations are said to even predate it.. But only one of these civilizations formed written records of their history dating back over 8000 years before Aegon made his conquest of Westeros and that was the ancient civilization of the Ghiscari Empire.   

The empire began when the city of ""Old Ghis"" was founded by Grazdan the Great some 8000 years prior to the events of the show and novels.  Old Ghis would act as a central hub to that of the rising empire that began to flourish as it's people spread across Essos and beyond, establishing major cities and spreading their customs through the continent.  The symbol of Ghis, the harpy, became one of the most recognizable symbols of dominance in the thousands of years the empire ruled.  The Ghiscari were brilliant military tacticians, and their use of their legendary lockstep legions, extremely well disciplined and obedient to their commanders made conquering whoever previously controlled what Ghis conquered lost to history.  Thousands of years later, the legions are still remembered; the Unsullied have been said to be the legions come again, and are trained as such. (More on them in a bit).   

If being the oldest civilization and their military might are a couple of the things that the Ghiscari empire was known for, the most notable thing would be the unfortunate institution of slavery.  Slavery predated Ghis, yes, but it was not until the Empire spread as far as it ever did that history would show that the Ghiscari were very ""talented"" at the trading of other human beings..  Slavery would be the biggest economic institution of the empire and it was on the backs of these slaves that some of the largest cities in the empire were built, the cities of aptly named ""Slaver's Bay"" the cites of Astapor, Mereen, and Yunkai.  And so the empire persisted for thousands of years, rarely challenged, and the most dominant force in the known world, that was until a small group of sheepherders nestled in a peninsula untouched by the Ghiscari made a startling discovery in the volcanos of their homeland, and very quickly began to consolidate power, enough power to challenge the Ghiscari, and that is the rise of the Valyrians, and the newly christened dragonlords.  


- The Rise of Valyria and the Fall of Ghis

From the fourteen fires of the Valyrian peninsula dragons came, and those who found them would lay the foundations that would form the greatest civilization known to exist within the World of Ice and Fire, that of the Valyrians and the Valyrian freehold. But first they would have to dethrone the current rulers of Essos, the Ghiscari Empire.  But it was not the Valyrians who cast the first stones in what would become the series of conflicts that led to the downfall of Ghis, it was the Ghiscari Empire, envious of the rising tide of Valyria who decided to make war with the Dragonlords..

Wether or not the Ghiscari foresaw the threat that the Valyrians would pose them in the centuries to come, or the enticing prospect of conquering their land, extending their empire further and claiming the dragons as their own is lost to history. What is known is that in the centuries of war fought between the Ghiscari and Valyria it was Ghis who initiated the fighting.. Over hundreds (or even thousands, no one is sure when the conflicts began) of years Valryia and Ghis fought a total of 5 different wars throughout Essos and the surrounding land, each war won by Valyria.  It was not until the 5th Valyrian victory, some 5000 years before our current story that at long last the ancient civilization of the Ghiscari Empire was completely obliterated. 

The most ancient civilization was no more, the capital city of Ghis was destroyed, burned to the ground by dragonfire.. The city remains a ruin to this day.  Its people were assimilated into the newly emerged Valyrian freehold, the religion and language of the Ghiscari people became that of the Valyrians.  The cities of Mereen, Yunkai, and Astapor remained intact, but were now subjects of the Freehold, though the custom of Slavery (also practiced by the Valyrians) remained in place. And so was the situation in what remained of the Ghiscari Empire for over four and half thousand years, until Valyria faced it's own destruction, and the Valyrian Freehold dissolved....


---------------------

**The post-Valyria Ghiscari, and the customs and practices of a New Ghis**

- The Ghiscari City States  

The Valryian Freehold met it's own end when a massive cataclysm destroyed the Valyrian peninsula and dismantled the system of governance the Freehold held over nearly all of Essos for thousands of years.  This left the old remnants of the Ghiscari Empire in an adventitious spot, no longer under the yolk of the Valyrians those with Ghiscari blood were free to take up some of their ancient customs. However in the 400 years that have passed since the Doom the Ghiscari cities remain independent city states.  Astapor, Yunkai, Mereen notably govern themselves and are their own masters, though trade (mostly of slaves) remain high among them and all three share diplomatic ties, no effort to reform the Empire has ever seriously been made.  However one city, the city of New Ghis, built after the Doom of Valyria does wish this to happen, and have even resumed the practice of training free men in the old ways of the lockstep legions.  Weather not they achieve their goals will be left for history to decide.  

- Culture and Customs of the Modern Ghiscari

Now that we have ventured for the most part out of the history of what was and what are the remnants of the Ghiscari Empire it is time to cover a bit of the culture and customs of what make the Ghiscari so distinctive.  As with any culture or civilization they had in the pre-Valyrian days their own language, as well as religion.. When the Valyrians took control, as I mentioned the Ghiscari assimilated into that culture, but in recent days, since the fall of Valyria the old ways of Ghis have began to reappear.  The Ghiscari still speak the Valyrian language, but have developed their own distinct dialect, interspersed with elements of their own ancient language. 

The Ghiscari nobility are among the most colorful of all those that appear in A Song of Ice and Fire. Wild hair styles and apparel are common among the highly born merchants to the slave owners of Mereen, Yunkai, and Astapor..  The most common garb of the Ghiscari is the tokar, a long garment that must in part be held by the wearer, and one that requires him or her to take small steps to avoid being tripped.  One of the most unique things about the Ghiscari are the names that we see in the books.  Without spoiling the nature of their characters these are some of the names Daenaerys encounters while in Mereen.  Reznak mo Reznak, Skahaz mo Kandaq, Hizdahr zo Loraq, Yezzan zo Qaggaz...etc  (There are several more, that's just to give you an idea of how ridiculous GRRM got with the naming of characters).. These characters, with the exception of Hizdahr, whom we've encountered on in the book who are unlikely to appear on the show, I would however be careful searching those names.. 

The Modern Ghiscari are still, unfortunately, renowned for their trade in slavery.  The most notable example are the Unsullied of Astapor.  As you know the Unsullied are men, trained gruelingly beginning as children to become the ultimate fighter, extremely obedient, and unafraid of any foe or pain, much in the ways of the Lockstep Legions of Old Ghis.  The training methods of the Unsullied leave most boys who go through the process dead, and all without their manhood.  They are given puppies as children and forced to murder them after a year in an effort to scrape out any emotion... All of this leaves you with the most regimented fighting force on the planet however.. The most notable event regarding the Unsullied is the infamous Battle of Qohor, where a force of Unsullied outnumbered 8 to 1 against and entire Dothraki Khalasar were able to withstand the horde with only 600 of their men left.. With that the Dothraki recognized their defeat and all 3000 remaining Dothraki left their braids at the feet of the Unsullied. 

Astapor is not the only city with a unique trade in slaves, while they cannot lay claim to the likes of the Unsullied, the city of Yunkai are known for their training of sex slaves.  They train a large percentage of their slaves to be sold to brothels and pleasure houses throughout the World of Ice and Fire, all of which begin at a young age..  However the most notable slave practice comes from the city of Mereen, not from the trading or selling of slaves, but for being the host of the ""renown"" fighting pits of Mereen.  The fighting pits were slaves are forced into combat by their masters to fight to the death for the amusement of crowds of thousands of cheering fans.  The largest and most notable of pits being Daznak's pit.  These fights bring a major economic boon to the otherwise crumbling city of Mereen.  Despite the brutality of the pits, and the forced nature of the fighting it has helped a handful of slaves earn their freedom and a smidgen of notoriety.. most notably that being Daario Naharis as he mentioned in the show (And has been mentioned by others, as a character known as ""Strong Belwas"" in the novels, Daario was never a slave in the books, and has absorbed Belwas' story for the show).  

So exist Ghis in the modern day.. In the wake of a disbanded Valyria they have returned to their old ways that made their former empire what it was thousands of years ago, or at least is their wish.  Those cities profit on the backs of those they enslave as they have always done and seem content living as such on their corner of the world... Or so they thought, little did they know all the way back in season 3, that just as their ancestors had thousands of years ago do they faced a threat, a threat with Valyrian blood, and a threat with Dragons....

Okay, so that's it for this week, I hope you all enjoyed reading..  I like doing these strictly back history installments from time to time (and especially when a new episode does not toss me a bone for something to talk about in the actual episode, as this week's episode has neglected)..  I love lore and rediscovering some of GRRM's massive world building is always great..  That being said I will give a shoutout to The Wiki of Ice and Fire as a go to for a lot of the finer points that I myself did not remember... Thank you all for reading and I will see you all next week...
 
P.S.  Sorry for the Very late post, I had a busy day and didn't have a chance to start this until a couple of hours ago.

Round 2 finishes with 4 more matches today! A quick reminder we're voting for them based on their peak ability IN THE SHOW! If we haven't seen them fight much you can base your judgement off of how they're talked about in the show as well as your own opinion on how you think they'd fight. This is all just for fun, its been well discussed that in a prime based tournament Dayne or Selmy wins.


Bracket: http://challonge.com/GoTT


Day 1 results: Khal Drogo vs Jorah Mormont: Jorah's armor and experience aren't enough for the man who's never been defeated as Jorah falls to Drogo 133-66. Jaime Lannister vs Tormund Giantsbane: The Kingslayer continues his one sided victories with a win over Mance's right hand man tormund 173-21. Oberyn Martell vs Jaqen H'ghar: The Red Viper of Dorne secures himself a spot in the Elite Eight with a victory over the assassin 165-38. Daario Naharis vs Grey Worm: One of the first matches I've gotten wrong so far as the boy toy takes out the leader of the unsullied 126-64.


Match 1: #4 The Mountain vs #13 Ser Loras Tyrell [Vote here!](http://www.easypolls.net/poll.html?p=55362defe4b0f84e696ca2fe) We saw Loras best The Mountain in a jousting tournament in season 1 using a clever trick of making The Mountains horse thirsty for Loras' horse in heat. But will Ser Loras be the one getting the D this time in a 1v1 battle. Prince Oberyn proved that smaller quicker fighters give The Mountain trouble, and Loras has done nothing but improve since season 1 since becoming a knight of the capital. Is everything he learned enough for him to take down the biggest man in the tournament?


Match 2: #5 Brienne of Tarth vs #12 Bronn [Vote here!](http://www.easypolls.net/poll.html?p=55362e96e4b0f84e696ca303) Both fighters took out a member of the nights watch in round 1 to face each other in round 2. Is Bronn's agility and dishonor enough to stop Brienne short of a sure Elite Eight bid?


Match 3: #3 Ser Barristan Selmy vs #19 Ned Stark [Vote here!](http://www.easypolls.net/poll.html?p=55362f06e4b0f84e696ca308) Ned was able to get by his bastard son in round 1 to face the man with more 1v1 combat victories than any other man alive. Does Ned's upset path end here as he said he was glad he never faced Barristan the Bold, or does he have what it takes to dethrone the man with the reputation as one of the greatest of all time.


Match 4: #6 The Hound vs #11 Syrio Forel [Vote here!](http://www.easypolls.net/poll.html?p=55362f8ae4b0f84e696ca30a) The Hound has proven time and again he is a force to be reckoned with and plans to continue his path of destruction into the Elite Eight, but does his journey get stopped short by the man who's death he mocked in season 4, The First Sword of Braavos?


That's all for the Sweet Sixteen! Come back tomorrow for the results and the beginning of the Elite Eight where we'll cut down to just 2 matches with matches Y and AA! Thanks for voting!",37,34,False,self,,,,,

Because I believe a Martel prince died during the war in the Kings guard (if someone can confirm or correct me I would appreciate that on this one) and of course what happens to Ellia and her children. So after the rebellion there doesn't seem to be anything that ties down the Martells and dorne to the other 6 kingdoms. And after they have resisted dragons and armies and at the time dragons are dead I'm curious as to why this didn't happen.

So is leaving ASOS until season 5 is done a good idea? I've come to understand that by the end of it it's starting to split from the show and overtake some of the characters story progress but I've also heard this season is just going straight up and moving away from the books.

If you missed last week's post, you can find it [here] (http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/32lg97/tvadwd_s05e01_episode_companion_and_what_you/). 

Also, I just want to note that these posts are spoiler free. While they contain background information from the books in order to fill in show watchers, there is no extra information I reveal that would otherwise ruin the book experience for you. I only pull book information to fill in context of what has already happened on the show.

**Scene I: Braavos**

Just for quick context, Braavos is a vast port city in the north western corner of Essos. [This map] (http://i.imgur.com/5gayWSE.png) is very helpful in showing the layout of Essos. As a fun aside, the first time ""Jaqen H'ghar"" meets Arya, he claims to be from Lorath, seen in the far north. Arya is in Braavos on the west coast. Varus and Tyrion are heading south from Pentos to Volantis. Dany is very far east of here. Braavos is notably difficult to access, mainly only possible by sea. In fact, its identity was long kept a secret due to its seclusion in that bay area. It was built by refugees and as a consequence of the geography, it is riddled with canals, much like the city of Venice. Arya's arrival shows just how vast the world is and how spread out the story has become. We now have 3 separate POV's on Essos! The only other thing to note here is that Arya is still incessantly repeating her hit list. Cersei, Walder Frey, The Mountain, and Meryn Trant. Meryn Trant is [this doosh nozzle] (http://i.imgur.com/r4ecw0s.png) from Season 1 who came to find Arya and subsequently fights Syrio Forel.

**Scene II: Tavern**

Well Brienne and Sansa actually end up meeting after all. This scene just gives us another glimpse into Brienne's tragic inner turmoil. Every lord or lady she has pledged her loyalty to has suffered a terrible demise. The circumstances surrounding these events (Renly's assassination, Red Wedding) are completely out of Brienne's hands and yet the fact that her sworn lords are all dead is all that people will ever see in her.

**Scene III: King's Landing**

In this scene we hear that Myrcella is being kept in the Water Gardens of Dorne. We'll discuss the gardens momentarily. We can also pretty safely assume that the serpent was sent by Oberyn's paramour, Ellaria.

**Scene IV: Stokeworth**

Bronn is back, baby! If this scene doesn't set the stage for the greatest buddy comedy in the history of Westeros, I don't know what would! Stokeworth is a family very loyal to the Crown, namely due to their proximity directly north of King's Landing. Their lands are great and fertile and the Crown relies on Stokeworth to grow the great amounts of food consumed in the capitol. Bronn was rewarded with the hand of this fine young wench, Lollys Stokeworth, as well as her castle and lands, which explains why he is being so sweet and sappy here.

**Scene V: The Water Gardens, Dorne**

Our first glimpse of Dorne. The Water Gardens are a rare oasis in the barren deserts of Dorne. This is an ancient vacation estate of the Martell family. It is a fertile area, filled with flowing water and sprouting foliage. Here we see a fleeting moment of Myrcella and the young Trystane Martell, the son of Doran. Prince Doran sits up on the balcony, his close friend and bodyguard Captain Areo Hotah guarding the door. In this scene, we learn just how cherished Oberyn was in Dorne. He was a young, wild, and attractive Prince, known for his charming smile and philandering ways. He was basically a superstar and beloved celebrity to the people. Given this context, and added on to the fact that he and his sister both now have been murdered in King's Landing, it is not difficult to understand why the people of Dorne desire to go to war for vengeance. Doran, on the other hand, is a very logical, calm and collected ruler who thinks this unwise. Ellaria mentions the Sand Snakes. This is the name applied to Oberyn's many daughters, who he raised to be strong willed and independent women, trained in the noble arts as well as combat. They are well known throughout Dorne.

**Scene VI: Meereen**

The only thing I'd like to discuss here is the state of slavery in Meereen. Keep in mind that Meereen sits on a geographic formation known as Slaver's Bay. Meereen, along with Yunkai and Astapor, holds an ancient tradition of slavery in Essos. Even the Unsullied fall under this category of slave. Forget every connotation you have of slavery in your mind. While the word may invoke thoughts of the Civil War in America, or the Caribbean, Rome, Greece, or Egypt, these are not necessarily comparable. Slavery is an ancient practice here, and quite refined. While it is not a stroll in the park for everyone, we must note the social situation in this area. The wealth gap in Slaver's Bay is HUGE. You are basically a slave, or a slave owner. Here, the 1% own 100% of the wealth, and the rest are slaves. However, for many, slavery is the only option of social mobility. In prestigious households a slave might be a master of arms, a horse trainer, a head chef, a tutor of language or geography or history. They would be given food, clothes, a place to sleep, a title, the respect of the family. In fact, many slaves of noble families were actually considered close friends and indeed even a part of the family. I do not intend to glamorize slavery and I certainly do not pretend that this was the situation for all slaves. However, this issue is hugely divisive here and the issue runs much deeper than Dany can possibly understand, perhaps. This is in part because of the historicity of slavery, and in part because, frankly put, many slaves are now in fact much, MUCH worse off since being freed.

**Scene VII: The Road to Volantis**

Not much here, but Varys and Tyrion have a long, long trip ahead of them. I hope they packed enough barrels of wine.

**Scene VIII: King's Landing**

Qyburn wants a head. Weirdo.

In the Small Council meeting, things are tense. Cersei has appointed Qyburn to replace Varys as Master of Whispers. Remember, Qyburn once studied to be a Maester just like Pycelle. However, he was kicked out of the order for performing some questionable experiments, and showing too much interest in dark and objectionable arts. This is the main reason for Pycelle's contempt towards Qyburn. Cersei continues to butter up Mace Tyrell, granting him the title of Master of Coin (Tyrion's old position) on top of his previously granted post as Master of Ships.

**Scene IX: The Wall**

Here we see Shireen, Stannis' daughter, teaching Gilly to read. Things seem to be going...well... I'd like to discuss Shireen's affliction, greyscale, for a moment. In Westeros, it is known that the disease is basically a death sentence. However, it is not always mortal in children. While it cannot be cured, Shireen is a good example that it can be mostly stayed. However, any adult exposed to it is a goner. Shireen also notes here that Maester Cressen is the one who taught her to read. You will remember him as Stannis' Maester in Season 2, [this guy] (http://i.imgur.com/WYE0Hw1.jpg) who tried to poison Melisandre, to disastrous results.

In the scene between Stannis and Jon, we see that a rather amusing letter has arrived at the Wall. Stannis has sent messages to all the lords of the North, seeking their allegiance. Unsurprisingly, he has received few responses, and the ones that have come in are less than satisfactory. The note in question comes from the head of House Mormont. This is the house of The Old Bear as well as Jorah, who in case you didn't know, was the son of Jeor, the Old Bear. Since Jorah was exiled in events prior to the show, his sister came to rule the ancestral home of the Mormonts, Bear Island. She, however, was one of the many slaughtered at the Red Wedding, although it is said she went down fighting, taking many men with her. Since her death, her infant daughter Lyanna has taken rule. She is the author of this cursory reply to Stannis. House Mormont is traditionally one of the most loyal families to the Starks. 

**Scene X: Braavos**

Welp, Arya has developed a much more refined method for catching [nice fat pigeons] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNmC-q9rdOM) now.

Also Jaqen.

**Scene XI: Meereen**

Dany wants to show the people of Meereen that she intends to rule a fair and just society, free of the atrocities of the old rulers. In order to demonstrate this, she publicly executes a kid in front of the entire city.

Also, Drogon is back!

.....aaaaand, he's gone.

See you all next week, and please add in your own details and correct anything I may have wrong here!

But I credit the show for grappling with the idea that sticking with the Hound and Littlefinger, two shady characters, is indeed better for Arya/Sansa. I'm certainly convinced of that by the encounter with Littlefinger in S5E2.

Although the quality of the story, directors, and actors all play into this success, the purpose of this short blurb is to highlight what I think to be the most important factor of the GofT Series success, the underlying political science theories. Prominent themes from Rousseaus Social Contract, Hobbes Leviathan, and even Platos Republic are latently present in the story line and apply to the world of Westeros in very much the same way as they do in our own.  In this way, GofT characters provide excellent case studies for making very abstract political theories far easier to remember and grasp for those of us not familiar with either obscure political science concepts.

An important theme running through GofT is the Prince that was Promised or Azor Ahai. This Prince is prophesied to unite the people of Westeros and save the world from the coming darkness with a flaming sword and a song of Ice and Fire. Many characters in GofT are hinted at representing this idyllic figure tinged with religious and political significance (none more so than Daenerys Targaryen). The coming of the Prince in a world outside Westeros (i.e. Earth) implies the establishment of order and harmony under a sovereign, much as how many Italian city states like Florence formed. 
Machiavelli was a political scientist in Florence living from 1469 to 1527. He was a close advisor and official in the Florentine Republic and witnessed the tumult in Florence after the ouster, then subsequent return, of the Medici in 1512. Such a time in medieval history saw many similar power struggles between the various European monarchies, oligarchies, and democracies. As a reaction to this violent political chaos, Machiavelli wrote The Prince as a guide for future rulers filled with advice on how to act as the head of state.  What is the best course of action? How do I raise an army? Should I hire mercenaries? Should I lie? Should I murder? 
Such questions were answered in a highly reasoned, brutal way. For example, Machiavelli lays out three ways in which to control a foreign city (i) create a puppet government controlled from your Capitol, (ii) move to the newly acquired city, (iii) raze the city and its kill all its citizens. Machiavelli advises that Option (iii) isnt mandatory (that is very nice of him) but this hardly hides the amoral nature of his work.

In the same sense as Machiavellis audience, Daenerys Targaryen also tests out some of these ethical dilemmas. As the ruler of Meeren, Daenerys Targaryen is a perfect case study applying political science theories to fictional scenarios. In Season 5 Episode 2 of GofT, The House of Black and White, Daenerys Targaryen is confronted with such a dilemma when a guerilla force called the Sons of the Harpy (individually Son) murder innocents and soldiers in Meeren as protest against Daenerys Targaryens occupation. A Son is apprehended and is sentenced to await a fair trial. This Son is subsequently murdered by one of Daenerys most senior advisors named Morrador. 
A Machiavellian decision is presented to Daenerys. Should she spare her most trusted advisor for violating her command?  On one hand the Son was plainly guilty of murder and was most likely going to be sentenced to die. Further, Morrador was one of the first slaves to rise up and fight for Daenerys and served her loyally in every aspect except for this one act. On the other hand, her command as ruler was ignored implicating either that (i) Daenerys had actually ordered the murder, or (ii) she does not have control of her subjects.
Combining the fictional scenario in GofT (and the hindsight it provides) with the theoretical application of Machiavellian principles, we come to an interesting conclusion. As ruler of Meeren, it was wrong of Daenerys to execute Morrodor, publicly at least. Critical to this answer is the implication that wrong denotes a mistaken choice, not because it is ethically wrong. The public execution was the essential reason the riot was incited and an abysmal failure of leadership and governance. Machiavelli would argue that even though the Prince is an extremely violent symbol, the Prince only uses violence as a means to the end, with that end being a stable lasting authority creating peace within the kingdom. Daenerys decision created anything but that, and in the context of this scenario, was not up to par with the standards of how The Prince should act.
The Prince Chapter XVII: Concerning Cruelty And Clemency, And Whether It Is Better To Be Loved Than Feared

Machiavelli addresses this question, and perhaps sheds light on future decisions made by Daenerys, by asking whether it is better to be loved than feared. Machiavellis finds that because it is difficult to unite them in one person, is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be dispensed with. Daenerys subjects love her. They call her Myhsa or Mother in their native language because she had previously delivered them from their former lives as slaves. She instituted new laws forbidding gladiator fights and even radically distributed wealth from former slave holders that greatly improved the lives of her ex-slave followers.

However, Machiavelli would advise against Daenerys relying on that love. Machiavelli held no faith in the concept of the love of the people since people in general are: 
. . . ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as you succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood, property, life and children, as is said above, when the need is far distant; but when it approaches they turn against you. And that prince who, relying entirely on their promises, has neglected other precautions, is ruined; because friendships that are obtained by payments, and not by greatness or nobility of mind, may indeed be earned, but they are not secured, and in time of need cannot be relied upon; and men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than one who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails. 

Under such an analytic schema presented by Machiavelli would Morrador have murdered the Son had he truly feared Daenerys?  GofT does not give a definitive answer, however, we can use inductive reasoning to hypothesize that Morrador satisfied his opportunity for . . . advantage, at the expense of Daenerys and likely would not have done so had he truly feared her.  Machiavellis general principle may be cynical, yet it is elegantly simple. The execution ordered by Daenerys is objectively valid in that he did murder an unarmed man awaiting trial.  However, the result of such a sentence to the recently liberated slaves was equivocal to the harsh judgment of their previous Masters, especially in light of the public nature of the judgment. The love that had seconds before been pronounced with cries of Mercy and Mysha transformed into a primal and resounding hiss sparking a full on city-wide civil war.
Obviously in this case, Daenerys decision did not turn out for the best. Why? Firstly, because decisions are not made in a vacuum and secondly because context matters. Daenerys utterly forgot the tension between the political units of the society she governed. She was ignorant of the long history, tribal connections, and blood feuds that created deep divisions in her society. As a foreigner she was not ethnically, religiously, or culturally connected to her people and relied on select military units not designed for urban warfare. The list of faults goes on, however, this is short blurb is only meant to address this specific questions of whether it is better to be feared than loved.

Yes, it is better to be feared than loved if you cannot have both, yet the important take away from this episode and the corollary political science principle is, a Prince ought to inspire fear in such a way that, if he does not win love, he avoids hatred; because he can endure very well being feared whilst he is not hated.

Game of Thrones has plenty of incredible characters; lots of them badasses; most of them dead. However, most of these characters don't die in really badass ways: Tywin Lannister, one of the most powerful men in the realm - shot in the bowels by a dwarf before shitting himself; Oberyn Martell, Dornish nymphomaniac who loved spears in more ways than one - killed by showboating and cockiness; The Hound - what more can I say? - killed(?) by infected wounds; Ned Stark - an honourable moron - a bratty kid had his head chopped off with his own sword.

None of those match up to the likes of Boromir, so I was wondering: who do you think has the most badass death?

Off the top of my head (sorry for the pun, Ned) it'd either be: Qhorin Halfhand or Yoren (Night's Watch ftw).",69,15,False,self,,,,,

Cersei - had Ned Stark killed

Walder Frey - had Catelyn and Rob Stark killed

A quick reminder we're voting for them based on their peak ability IN THE SHOW! If we haven't seen them fight much you can base your judgement off of how they're talked about in the show as well as your own opinion on how you think they'd fight. This is all just for fun, its been well discussed that in a prime based tournament Dayne or Selmy wins.


Bracket: http://challonge.com/GoTT


Results: The Mountain vs Loras Tyrell: The Mountain proves that Loras cant take him with a sword as he takes a decisive win 212-39. Brienne of Tarth vs Bronn: Bronn edges out Brienne to take the upset in a popular NCAA tournament pick of a 12 over a 5 in one of the closest matches so far 145-100. Ser Barristan vs Ned Stark: Ser Barristan coasts into the Elite Eight with a victory over Ned 216-29. The Hound vs Syrio Forel: The Hound falls short of the Elite Eight with an upset defeat to Syrio 150-98.


Quarterfinal 1: #1 Khal Drogo vs #8 Jaime Lannister [Vote here!](http://www.easypolls.net/poll.html?p=55378ccee4b0f84e696caa39) The #1 seeded Drogo runs into his first real test today as 8th seeded Jaime plans to prove Drogo's overratedness to the world. Does The Kingslayer fall short of the Final Four? Or can he take out the #1 seed with a victory over the Khal.


Quarterfinal 2: #2 Oberyn Martell vs #7 Daario Naharis [Vote here!](http://www.easypolls.net/poll.html?p=55378d1ae4b0f84e696caa3b) As a man who grew up in the fighting pits, Prince Oberyn has a respect for his opponent as he enters the arena. We've seen Oberyn take down a man the size of the mountain, but how does he fare against a smaller man possibly quicker than him?

I am on episode 2 of season 1 and I noticed something confusing.

First we see someone try to stab Brandon with a knife and Lady Stark and the wolf protect him. Then she says at the tree that she will ride to King's Landing to tell Ned. She also says she has been praying for Brandon for a month. So it has been almost a month since the Lannister party left the grounds.

Then we see Joffrey and Sansa strolling and the fight with the butcher's boy and Arya. So clearly Ned and Robert are close enough to the Stark's home that Sansa and Arya can walk to it? They wouldn't have brought them along right? So clearly they have not got to Kings Landing yet? Why would the girls know where to find their father yet their mother would think that Ned was at the capital?

If Robert and the Lannisters have been gone a month shouldn't they be further away than walking distance? If the girls can walk to them does that mean they haven't left?

Also when robert sentences the dire wolf to die, where are they? where is this mini throne robert is sitting on?",0,1,False,default,,,,,

Also this is my first time posting in here, if my formatting or anything is done improperly, let me know!

I am rewatching Season 1 currently. In episode 4, Ned Stark meets Gendry for the first time. Now, I've noticed them talking about hair color a lot more than on my first watch through and something Gendry said piqued my interest. When Ned asks about Gendry's mother, Gendry describes her as having ""yellow hair"". Earlier in the season, when Cersie is talking to Cat while Bran is in his coma, Cersie explains how she and Robert had had a first son ""a little black haired beauty."" Nothing, to my knowledge, is ever brought up about that son again.

Gendry told Ned that his mother had ""died when I was little"", and Cersie mysteriously lost a son (that, based on hair color, was undeniably Robert's).

The first time I watched through the seasons, I assumed that [S1 spoiler](#s ""Ned got killed because he found out that Joffrey is the product of incest."")

Now, I have a theory: [Gendry Theory](#g ""what if Ned was killed because he found Cersie and Robert's missing son? What if Gendry isn't just a bastard. What if he is the rightful king now that Robert is dead? This would mean Joffrey never would have been king whatsoever."")

Again, apologies if this has been discussed already (see, first time), just thought it was a clever little thought process of mine! Am I just blowing smoke or could I possibly be onto a tiny wisp of something?",25,25,False,self,,,,,

A quick reminder we're voting for them based on their peak ability IN THE SHOW! If we haven't seen them fight much you can base your judgement off of how they're talked about and their reputation in the show as well as your own opinion on how you think they'd fight. This is all just for fun, its been well discussed that in a prime based tournament Dayne or Selmy wins.


Bracket: http://challonge.com/GoTT


Results: Khal Drogo vs Jaime Lannister: The Kingslayer stands over the Khal as #1 has fallen 310-96. Oberyn Martell vs Daario Naharis: Prince Oberyn secures himself a spot in the Final Four with a victory over Daario 349-44.


Quarterfinal 3: #4 The Mountain vs #12 Bronn [Vote here!](http://www.easypolls.net/poll.html?p=5538de17e4b0f84e696cadfe) One would think Bronn would've gotten by Brienne using his quickness, agility, and anything to live fighting style. In the Elite Eight he faces a similar competitor, one he came close to facing in the show and would've used the strategy of his quickness to take The Mountain off his feet. Now this match has come to be, can Bronn put the dancing strategy to use, or can The Mountain get ahold of him and stop the 12 seed short of the final four.


Quarterfinal 4: #3 Ser Barristan Selmy vs #11 Syrio Forel [Vote here!](http://www.easypolls.net/poll.html?p=5538deb9e4b0f84e696cae02) The man regarded as one of the best of all time, faces off against The First Sword of Braavos. Does Barristan the Bold have the speed to keep up Syrio in his old age after Syrio took down The Hound to make it here. Syrio may have the younger and agility bonuses on his side, but is his technical ability enough to stand with Ser Barristan?


Thanks for voting and come back tomorrow for results and the first match of the final four, which will be Jaime Lannister vs the winner of The Mountain and Bronn!",123,47,False,self,,,,,

My first thought thought was that she was obviously referring to Margaery, but now I'm thinking that this queen might be Daenerys. Yes Cersei will be queen for a time but her replacement (Margaery) might not be the queen who will cast her down and take all she held dear.

In the previous posts, we've looked at mostly 4 man pressures, sometimes just straight 4-man with no disguises, counting on one of the pass rushers to win his matchup.  And then later with some fake blitzers who back out or switch out pass rushers.  In a few cases, we saw did see the Texans' defense sending more than 4 rushers in order to get pressure.  

This final post shows a little bit of everything.  Houston shows big pressure with 7 potential pass rushers on the line of scrimmage, including S DJ Swearinger, but then drops into coverage, but then it appears that there's also a delayed blitz.  We also get a great view of JJ Watt's anticipation and get off, beating LT Tyron Smith, but then failing to finish the sack, allowing Romo to escape and make a deep TD pass against WRs that somehow got 1-on-1 (no help) coverage on the backend.

In Post #10, Romo had Dez Bryant breaking into a deep post with the CB on his back hip (with no middle safety help) but didn't have the time to get the throw off.  Here, Romo makes the time with a spectacular reverse pivot spin move and again he has a WR running a deep post with the CB on his backhip and no middle help; this time it's Terrance Williams and this time Romo makes the throw.  The throw is slightly underthrown, but the DB falls down and Williams goes up and makes a nice catch.  

It's the Highlight play of the game and is even more interesting because of all the moving parts in the play.

*A note about the timer.   On the A22 and the EZ view, there's a timer in the lower left to show how long the pass rush lasts.  This is shown as ""X:YY"" (eg., ""2:31"").  The right-most 2 digits are in 1/60th of a sec, so 2:30 is really 2.5s.  In the post body, I use decimal format (2.5s) instead of the Time Code format.*

I also know that many people couldn't care less about Bran and his quest to learn more about the powers that he possesses. But I can't be the ONLY one out there that is interested in this branch of the story. Obviously he has made his way to this mystical tree man for a reason! (I know he has a name, but I am trying to stick to only spoilers for the show) I want to get some discussion going about where everyone thinks they are taking this arc of the story. How is Bran going to play a part in the bigger picture once he is done with this quest?

I personally think, and stick with me here, that Arya is going to end up with Daenerys in some way, just as it seems like Tyrion will. This will lead them all to Westeros at some point to take back the Iron Throne from the Lannisters (or whoever occupies it at that point). In all of that, I think Bran will have completed his ""training"" and come back across The Wall to find the war that has ensued. I'm sure after fumbling about for a season or two (if the past is any indicator), he will finally learn of his little sister's involvement in the war. His powers can then play a role in winning the Iron Throne for Daenerys. Of course there could also be some fun confusion in there if Arya has completed HER ""training"" and ends up coming to Danny as ""someone else"". That could throw a wrench in this WHOLE theory.

I've been doing well at keeping up with the show thus far, but this episode really threw me off and I'm finding it hard to go on with all these questions and things I don't get.... so if anyone has the time to help me with this, i'd be very happy....

Q1-Why did Varys tell Ned that he thinks Jon Aryon was poisoned with Tears Of Lys?

Q2- I did not quite understand the conversation between Illyrio Mopatis and Varys.... are they the ones conspiring to start a war? and why did Varys help ned earlier and now he is talking about getting rid of him?

Q3-What on earth did Catelyn think taking Tyrion Lannister to her sister would achieve? 

Q4-what was the whole conversation between Petyr Baelish and Varys about?

Q5-So Jon Aryon was tracking down Robert's bastards..... who was the first bastard child Ned found? Was it the guy at the armor smiths?

so those are my questions, sorry for asking questions that are SOOOO irreverent to alot of you guys....  but I need these things answered to continue the show. also, spoilers are fine if it answers my question.

However, best to start somewhere though, hey? I've been talking to the folks at minifigs.me and although they are super-busy, pretty much operating at capacity (also given the fact that they are about two weeks away from the birth of their daughter and in the process of moving house) they are really excited about doing some GOT minifigs, and told us that they would give us some to give away through the blog as competition prizes, which is fantastic news!

So what I wanted to ask the Reddit community to help me decide which 3 figures to start with. I was thinking to do a shortlist of 10 (based on some of the excellent suggestions that came up) and then let you guys decide on the 3 most popular ones by upvoting.

I'm very much a newbie here though, and I know that you have to be careful about how you use the upvote mechanism, and also full disclosure that I'd love you guys to check out our powerofthebrick blog, but apart from that, we genuinely want to get you involved in helping us decide. Can the moderators please tell me what might be the best way to do this?

Each minifig option could be listed as a separate comment maybe, and then people can upvote the ones they like best? Would that be OK?

Thanks again to everybody, this really should be Awesome in an EPIC way....

There are several ways to interpret how they both behave, but since it's more difficult to relate to a dragon's behavior, the mystery about that leads to more, and I think more interesting, speculation.

Discussing it with a few other people I came to this possible realization tonight: one of the reasons, if not the largest one, that Drogon may have sniffed his momma and then flown off is...she perhaps carried no or very little scent from Drogon's siblings. Or, alternatively,  maybe she did carry enough scent from her earlier visit, but the fact Drogon can't find them has told him definitively what she did and shares personal responsibility for doing. This explanation for me has the most potential to make the later events exciting because it introduces the possibility of Drogon being a character in a way that he isn't really in the book. He and Dany may have to reconcile in a way that the books don't present...at least, not yet.",7,12,False,self,,,,,

I read the books but this theory is based on my thoughts of where the show is going, not at all the books.

I think Sansa will end up on the Iron Throne, or in some other way triumph in the end.  She will do it by usurping everything Littlefinger is trying to use her to build for himself.  Here's my thinking:

- She has the pedigree.  Raised by Catelyn Stark, then taught to use her womanly charms by Cersei, and now the art of manipulation by Littlefinger.  By the end Sansa will have had a solid background in intrigue. 

- Littlefinger seems to be making a move to build up a force that can contend with King's Landing and the Lannister/Tyrell union.  Sansa seems to play a key part.  My guess is that he's planning to use her Stark name just like Tywin was hoping to do so by marrying her to Tyrion.  But I think he's underestimating Sansa, and in the end his obsessed with her mother will be his undoing at her hands.

- It would fit the theme of humble and unassuming people rising to greatness through times of hardship.  Sure she's nobility so she's not exactly humble origins, but in the beginning nothing much was expected of her outside of ""get married"".  I expect that she will be married off at some point, to someone that will benefit Littlefinger's plan.  But I don't expect her to be the wife of someone powerful, I expect her to be the one with the power in the end.

That's my theory/speculation, tell me what you think!",26,2,False,self,,,,,

Having breezed through books 1 and 2, I started the third book, A Storm of Swords, about two weeks ago. When I got to a part of the book that I had literally just seen happen in the most recent episode, I should have realized that there was a very good possibility for potential spoilers ahead. However, I was so close to the end that my desire to finish book 3 got the better of me. Fast forward to today! I had just reached the epilogue, only a minute or two is left of the audiobook to go and suddenly a plot twist on the scale of which I can only compare to Luke, I am your father, is thrust upon my unsuspecting ears! Realizing what I had just done, I turned the audiobook off immediately to prevent any further spoiling to take place, but I fear the damage was irreparable. So now I am left feeling a weird mixture of shock at this big reveal and disappointment in the fact that I may have just ruined season 5 for myself.

Fire in the room, the king laughing, and Jaime coming out from behind the throne and stabbing him in the back. Soon after Ned Stark comes in and catches him in the act.

Does Prince Oberyn's speed and reach overtake Ser Barristan's technical ability, or can Barristan the Bold advance to the finals for a championship match against The Kingslayer.


Thanks for voting! Come back tomorrow for the championship match and the 3rd place match!",23,33,False,self,,,,,

I haven't read any of the books.

1) Why did Ned Stark tell Cersei that he knew about her and Jamie? Surely he would have realized that she would have tried to move against him if given the opportunity.

2) How could Ned Stark know for certain that Robert would have believed him about Joffrey being Jamie's son? What if Robert refused to believe Ned and called him a liar. Did Ned have a plan for that?

3) Why wasn't the paper given to Ned enough to put him on the Iron Throne temporarily? It seemed like the guards knew it was legitimate. Shouldn't the guards have obeyed Ned instead of the Queen?

4) Why were Renly and Stannis going to fight? Wouldn't it have been in both of their best interests to first join forces with the Starks so they can attack the Lannisters together? I know Renly and Stannis both wanted to be kind but wouldn't it be better for them to defeat Joffrey first before they fight?

5) What did Stannis use to kill Renly and why couldn't they use it to kill Joffrey and the Lannisters?



6) Why didn't Rob Stark wait to marry until after the war when he no longer needed those troops? 


7) What is the Starks relationship like with Stannis? After Renly was killed why didn't they send an envoy to Stannis to try to convince him to become allies?

I literally don't take Littlefinger as the kind of person to settle down and marry. What can happen to Sansa if she does marry, scares me to no end. This might be the thing that the director hinted at during the interview that got a lot of upvotes last week.

Because of some family stuff, you have to stay with SO's family for a while. They start getting scary. You start to realize that SO is abusive. SO's family hates you, but you can't complain about it because you're scared of them.

Then your parents get into a fight with the family, and, long story short, your dad gets killed. Your mom and family leave you there. Your little sister disappears. SO and family start getting worse, hurting and deriding you, but you have nowhere to go. 

Suddenly, everybody hates you. They either want to fuck you, kill you, or use you. Nobody is your friend. You can't talk to anyone about it because they'll tell SO, who will have you or someone you love killed. You don't even know if your family is alive. People call you weak and useless, publicly humiliate you, and try to hurt you. Nothing that used to make you happy does anymore. And you're not even sixteen. You have no idea how to deal with any of this shit. All you can do is cry, and that's when nobody's looking.

So this is purely based off of the show.**

So I was reading the TIL section of reddit today at work, and someone posted a tid-bit about Dire wolves. I read it and came across something that said they were primarily a North American species. This sparked an idea in my head and I quickly began puzzling this together. 


* Dire Wolves in North America. 
* Wooly Mammoths in what is now Canada. (also I understand that mammoths basically lived everywhere)
* And the resemblance of Dornish snakes and rattlesnakes. 

My theory is that Westeros is a misshapen North America. 

Northern Canada/Arctic being the north beyond the wall. The rest of Westeros being the United States, and Dorne being the southwest and Northern Mexico, which is 90% sand and snakes. 

**Although this theory doesn't come complete with Cities, I realize North America doesn't have castles and I'm sure Europe was more of an inspiration for that.**

I do account for the east though. 

Mereen along with most of the cities Daenerys has been too, are obviously inspired by West and North Africa, great slavery powerhouses for centuries. 

Braavos and Pentos are blanks for me, although I'm leaning towards Sparta and Athens. Based on the legion at Braavos, and that Pentos seems to be culture and merchant based. 

The Dothraki I've been pondering aswell. They roamed the east in ""The Flatlands"". If I had to pick a society or culture I'd go with Mongolian. Nomadic and militarized. But not Asian. 

So the east I'm thinking is a misshapen form of the Mediterranean. And parts of Asia. 


Again, if this plainly contradicts the books, please tell me so. 

Any thoughts?

Final Four Match 2 results: Prince Oberyn and Barristan the Bold fought a hard close match up down to the wire but in the end, The Red Viper of Dorne stands tall in one of the closest matches so far as he takes the win 171-141.


3rd place match: #3 Ser Barristan Selmy vs #4 The Mountain [Vote here!](http://www.easypolls.net/poll.html?p=553cd9abe4b0f84e696cb698) Both men fought hard in this tournament but both fell just short of the championship match. Now they'll face off 1v1 for the bronze medal. Ser Barristan has proved he can still hang with wins over opponents like the honorable Ned Stark as well as the Braavosi Syrio Forel. Now he may face his toughest opponent as he faces off against The Mountain Gregor Clegane who fell to the hands of Jaime Lannister, both men look to bring home a prize with a win in the 3rd place match.


Championship Match: #8 Jaime Lannister vs #2 Oberyn Martell [Vote here!](http://www.easypolls.net/poll.html?p=553cda66e4b0f84e696cb69a) Ser Jaime has proven his underseededness as he advances to the finals after knocking off #1 seed Khal Drogo as well as #4 Mountain, but does his run stop here as he faces off against the man with one of the most impressive combat sequences we've seen in the Game Of Thrones world. Is Jaime's speed enough to keep up with possibly just as fast Prince of Dorne, and can Prince Oberyn's spear keep up and parry the quickness that Ser Jaime will undoubtedly bring at him. Both men fight to bring home the gold and prove they're the best.

We are both big fans. My question is though why is Jaime so popular? 

A lot of the comments here and my book reading friends in real life seem to think he's on a new leaf now trying to redeem himself. But I'm confused why. He almost killed Bran, tried to kill Ned, called Jon a bastard, disrespected Catelyn about Ned's death, and didn't want to free Sansa. The only good thing he did for the Starks was kill the last king who killed Neds parents and brother. Plus he murdered the last king before Robert when Tywin came into the city which is an obvious double cross. I get that they are his rivals for show purposes but apart from Tyrion who he'd never hurt he's been pretty cruel to his own family as well. He joined the Gold Cloaks to spite Tywin, plus the incest and even with the incest he still raped Cersei over Joffrey's body when she was obviously in mourning. That's pretty fucked up. Didn't he also kill his own cousin? He doesn't seem like a good friend either as he forced Bronn to break up with his girlfriend so he could win Cersei back by returning their daughter from Dorne. 

 I like Jaime because he is a good villian and probably the most evil Lannister now that Joffrey is dead but I don't get when people say he's a hero. It seems the only reason he might be redeemable is because he would never do anything to hurt Tyrion. But he'd rape, kill and betray everyone else.

However, he doesn't want to spoil the books for folks and leaves a lot out. I read ADWD a while ago and have forgotten a lot, so I'm looking for resources, preferably videos, that compare what's happening with the TV show to what happened in the books.

For example, some characters are cut or repurposed for the show, and I'd love some resources discussing each GoT episode, how characters have been changed, what has been cut, etc. 

Does anyone know of content like that on the web? Thanks!",24,17,False,self,,,,,

Can anyone please point to a reference or give some info on how much military strength each house has/had.

Some i know of are/were,

- Baratheon: Renly had 100,000 men, who later bent the knee to the one true king of Westeros.  By the time Stannis came to the Iron Bank, he had 4,000 fighting men. After that, unlimited? 

- Lannisters: As far as i can remember, Tywin had 30,000 men because he sent 30,000 men (half his forces) with Jaime to raid the Riverlands. And those 30k died i suppose. 

- Arryns: The Vale's army which now answers to LF.

- Tullys: Was their army also killed during the Red Wedding? 

- Tyrells: No Idea.

- Martells: No Idea.

- Wildlings: 100,000 men when attacking the wall. How many survived?

- Starks: I guess house Umber still counts as Stark army?

*However*, I feel like the show is losing its impact compared to previous seasons (paritcualrly 1, 2 and 3).

We've been told this season is building up something really great for the end but sometimes... it's not about getting on the other side, it's the climb (lol).

What do you guys think?

EDIT: A few of you guys ask why I think this so here you go:

In the earlier seasons, I found that a lot of the characters moved from place to place, they interacted with characters a lot more and storyline was mostly focused on the 4-5 main houses, which was good. However, recently, I don't enjoy how other (arguably) less significant houses are being focused on. I feel like they are taking away the suspense that is building up to the actual ""game of thrones"". Also, a lot of the episodes most ""significant"" events *are* interesting, but have no significance in the bigger picture.

This is just what I think so please don't give me any hate. Like I said, I love this show, and these are just few of the things I don't like compared to the many I do.",13,0,False,self,,,,,

And when talking Sansa into it he mentioned avenging her family. It makes a lot of sense, with the North having a Stark as their leader, and with the Vale at their side, they could avenge the dead Starks by waging war dethroning the Lannisters, because the north remembers and they probably love Sansa.

Even on the S5 trailer Varys said the ruler needs to be: Loved by millions, have a powerful army, and have the right name. Then alluded to a woman as a ruler.

I'm still only 99% sure.

**Nonetheless, I legitimately thought they had recast Lancel since his voice is *completely* different to me (so much *DEEEEEPER*, and it has a different timbre/tone), so different-sounding that the only explanation is that it's a different person.** It had been 3 years since we last saw Lancel, so the original actor could have moved on, like the original actor for Daario.**^1** 

I was 100% certain of this, until my friends corrected me when I said that ""at least they found someone who somewhat resembles the old Lancel actor.""  And I thought they were joking when they said it was the same actor, and I had to IMDB it to believe them.

Eugene Simon was born in 1992, meaning that he was around 19 years old when we last saw him on screen. In S2, we hear Lancel *loudly* announce all of Robb Stark's  rumored ""war crimes"" in the royal hallway while Sansa is kneeling in front of King Joffrey,  Simon's voice sounded like he was done with puberty.  Sounded like a man's voice, like a 30-year old.

But now that he's back on the show at 22-23 years old, and he sounds NOTHING like his ""old"" self.  The ""new voice"" is much deeper and it has a distinctive ""rasp"" to it, like he had been smoking 2 packs a day for 3 years.   

**Here's my question: Is it common or even normal for teens/men to exhibit such a HUGE change in voice that late into puberty, i.e. at around age 20-22?  It's like he's hit 2nd puberty!**

**TL;DR: Lancel's actor has gone through such an EXTREME voice change that I was 100% certain they recast the role with an entirely different person.  Now, I'm mainly wondering how common it is for men to continue to ""develop"" their voices at age 20+, especially if the voice at 18-19 is already medium/deep-pitched and wasn't cracking at all like he was going through puberty.**

**^1** Skrein first appeared as Daario in the last 4 episodes of Season 3, making an *impression* -- regardless of whether you liked his portrayal/look or not, he was going to be *the* Daario ingrained in your head.  Then, he all of a sudden *quits* his Daario job with *Game of Thrones* and takes up an offer to be the new ""Transporter"" in the upcoming film, [*The Transporter: Refueled*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeoKyTHn5Kg).

So, I thought maybe Eugene Simon similarly left the Lancel role for something else, especially with the 3-year gap in between.",6,0,False,self,,,,,

They then run into Bran and company at one of the deserted towers.  When Sam gets back, he informs Jon that he saw Bran.  So, Jon knows that Bran is alive north of the Wall.

Fast forward to now, why the hell didn't they have Jon tell Stannis the Mannis that Bran is alive, or was a short time ago?  This changes the entire dynamic of the fight for the North.  First, knowing that another Stark son is alive completely voids the Bolton claim to Winterfell.  Stannis can send people north to search for Bran, and when they don't find him they happen upon Rickon in Skagos.  This gives Stannis the Stark he needs to rally the northern houses to him and puts him on the fast-track to going south to take Kings Landing.  Not to mention is gives the Starks a leg up on revenge for the fall of the entire family, which would be huge for show-watchers whos favorite Stark characters have been killed off over the course of the show.

I understand that the show is departing from the books in major ways, and I accept that.  However as far as the show goes, this is a major hangup for me.  So basically Rickon, Shaggy Dog, and Osha no longer exist.",40,44,False,self,,,,,

I'd love to do this again sometime, but anyway, without further ado here are the winners!


3rd Place Match, Ser Barristan vs The Mountain: The Mountain stands as tall as he can and puts up his best fight but in the end can't hang with Barristan that Bold as he takes home the bronze medal with a win 145-79.


Championship Match, Jaime Lannister vs Oberyn Martell: Both men fight a long hard battle and in the end both are barely standing until one is able to get in the final hit, until The Red Viper finishes the battle with a swift strike of his spear through The Kingslayer as Prince Oberyn Martell remains standing and takes home the win and 1st place with a victory in the finals with the closest vote yet of 127-120!


So there you have it, #2 seeded Oberyn Martell wins it all in the /r/gameofthrones tournament!

As this episode was titled ""High Sparrow"" and heavily featured elements of the current relationship with the Faith of the Seven within the walls of Kings Landing, as well as the growing influence the Faith has been seeing in the past few episodes, I thought it would be a great time to break down the political influence that the Faith of the Seven has had over Westerosi politics for the last 300 years, since Aegon the conqueror landed and united Westeros under the banner of House Targaryen.

----------------------------

- Note on spoiler scope

Once again we are dealing mostly with back history in this installment, most of which is information presented contextually throughout the novels, and some of which will come from the new world book ""The World of Ice and Fire"".. However when we get to talking about the current climate of the Faith we will be treading into book territory and I will discuss a few minor book to show deviations.. but as always I will not go in this post past where we are in the show, making this, as always, non-reader safe.  

----------------------------

**Aegon's Conquest and the adoption of the Faith**

While this is not the place to break down Aegon's conquest, it is worth note to mention the part the Faith of the Seven played in the long War Aegon made with Westeros in his attempt to unite it.  At the time the Faith of the Seven was not headquartered in Kings Landing, King's Landing didn't even exist yet, it would be a few decades or so until the city, and the Red Keep were completed, and another century and a half until the Faith were centralized there (more on that later). No, the faith of the time were headquartered at the massive sept in Oldtown, known as the Starry Sept.  When Aegon began his conquest the faith was at a quandary, should they support or resist Aegon's campaign.. After several days of fasting and prayer the High Septon was resolved to not oppose The Conqueror and convinced Lord Hightower to not send the men of Oldtown off to war... this was a smart decision by Lord Hightower as none of his people died along with fellow men of the Reach and King Mern Gardner on the Field of Fire.

Towards the end of the Conquest, after King Torrhen Stark of the North bent his knee to King Aegon I Targaryen, and all Kingdoms were under his control, Oldtown was the last stone Aegon left unturned, he and his men travelled to Oldtown to truly gain their full submission.  It is not exactly known when Aegon decided to abandon the gods of his Valyrian ancestors, but before he travelled to Oldtown Aegon, and his Sisters had converted to the Faith of the Seven, albiet as a political move, to help garner support for his campaign... It turned out to be a very wise political move, because when he reached Oldtown he found the gates open and with Lord Hightower as well as the High Septon welcoming with open arms.. It was at Oldtown, during Aegon's official coronation, that the High Septon himself anointed Aegon with the seven oils of the Faith, and personally placed his crown on his head and named the Conqueror King Aegon of House Targaryen, the First of His Name, King of the Andals, the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm... 

This last moment is also interesting for one other small reason.  This is when official dating begins within Westeros.  The Dating in Westeros is labeled as BC (Before Conquest) and AC (After Conquest).  1AC starts at Aegon's coronation at Old Town, not exactly when he made landfall at what would become King's Landing.  Aegon was coronated when he made landfall and proclaimed himself King then and there, but as far official dating is concerned all, including King Aegon himself did not consider the start of his reign until after his crowning at Oldtown, meaning the 2 years in which the conquest actually take place are from 2-1BC.

And thus King Aegon began his rule, and for 30 or so years Aegon ruled, unopposed and began rebuilding his realm that his War had wrought havoc on.  King's Landing and The Red Keep were years away from completion so King Aegon did not live on the city, preferring to rule from his seat at Dragonstone, or spending time travelling amongst the realm making good with the Lords and former Kings he subdued, and part of these efforts were furthering his ties to the Faith.. The largest of his efforts in regards to the Faith was the building of a massive Sept in Kings Landing, the Sept of Remembrance.  And for the rest of his reign the Faith and the Targaryens did coexist for side by side for over 3 decades, but when the Conqueror did at last pass away, and it became time to crown his son Aenys the Faith had a little more to say about that.. 

--------------------------------------------

**A Militarized Faith and the troubles of 3 Targaryen Kings**

- The former power and strength of the Faith...

The Faith of the time before the conquest and during the reign of Aegon was much more powerful than it is today.  The largest component of that was the power they wielded at the time... One of the largest powers they had for example was the authority to arrest people they thought guilty of crimes against the Faith as well as the power to be the ultimate authority in a resulting trial.. But even that pales in comparison to the power they wielded in the armed division the Faith wielded, The Faith Militant.  The Faith Militant was as I said was an armed and fighting body in service to the Faith.. The structure of which consisted of two groups.  First were the Poor Fellows, these were the lightly armed foot soldiers for the faith, from all ranks of society they existed to protect travelers in the name of the faith and to defend those who could not defend themselves, their sigil was that of the seven pointed star of which they were known for carving into their chests.  Secondly there were the Warrior's Sons.  The Warriors Sons were fully anointed Knights of the seven Kingdoms, with much of the same duties as the poor fellows. (Protecting Travelers/Protecting Septs). These Knights swore no oaths of service but to the Fatih.  This was not too much of a problem as most of their ranks were full of Hedge Knights or Knights in service to minor houses, but still there were knights who were full members of the Large Houses of Westeros.. These knights would abandon any family loyalty, give up any inheritance when they became a Warrior's son, and only serve in service of the Seven.. 


- The Faith Militant Uprising, and the troubles of 2 Targaryen Kings. 

After King Aegon died and his son King Aenys I took the throne troubles immediately started.  Several lords began to recognizing that King Aenys, weaker than his Father was not worth following and rose in minor rebellions such as that in the Vale and in Iron Islands.  It was with the help of the King's half brother, Maegor, that these small skirmishes were put down, and for it Maegor was named as Hand of the King..  But the Minor Lords were not the only troubles to King Aenys' reign, the Faith began having problems with the Targaryens.  The Targaryen practices of polygamy and incest did not sit right with the Faith from the outset, as both Aegon's children were a result of Aegons' relationship with his Sister-Wives the Faith was offended on both fronts when Aegon's children came to the throne..  But they belated action for the time being, the biggest reason being that prince Maegor was married to the niece of the High Septon himself, Lady Cersey Hightower.  However the Faith was angered when prince Maegor took a second wife.  King Aenys placated the faith by stripping Maegor as Hand of the King and naming a Septon in his wake to that office, but even that was short lived.  Not too long after King Aenys arranged for a marriage for his eldest son (Aegon) to his eldest child and daughter (Rhaena), and had his Septon/Hand performed the marriage.  This proved to be the last straw for the Faith, as it ignited the flame to open conflict that pitted the Faith against the Targaryens, a conflict that became to be known as The Faith Militant Uprising. 
While not as large as some of the later Wars that plagued House Targaryen, the Faith Militant uprising was still significant and still had a large lasting impact on the rules of King Aneys as well as his successor King Maegor.  While the Faith was still headquartered in Oldtown, it was in King's Landing, from the Sept of Remembrance that the Faith Militant operated.  One of their first efforts was an attempt on King Aneys' life when they broke into the walls of the Royal Apartments of an incomplete Red Keep, if it were not for the Kingsguard the Faith Militant would have succeeded in killing the King. King Aneys and his family fled Kings Landing and returned to Dragonstone where a short time later he fell ill and died... 


In a surprise move King Aneys was not succeeded by his eldest son, but by his half-brother Maegor.  Maegor ""The Cruel"" Targaryen earned his moniker in the ways he dealt with his foes, the Faith Militant included.  Placing himself ahead of the three sons of Aneys, Maegor was crowned as king and traveled back to Kings Landing to challenge anyone who would otherwise oppose his rule.  A Warrior's son by the name of Damon Morrigen answered the call and emerged from the Sept of Remembrance to challenge Maegor in a massive Trial of Seven in which left only Maegor alive, but severely injured, and in a coma.. When King Maegor recovered his wroth was felt immensely, he flew his dragon to The Sept of Remembrance and burned it to the ground, killing all inside.  Maegor later ordered that the site be rebuilt into a large housing area for the Royal Dragons, a site that would later be known as the Dragon Pit in King's Landing.   Maegor also put out a warrant on all Poor Fellows and Warriors sons putting a reward for any scalp that a man could bring him (A Silver stag for the former, a gold dragon for the latter).  In the times where the crown and Faith Militant actually met in open battle it was a slaughter as hundreds of burned followers of the faith met with dragonfire..  Despite their losses the Faith Militant was a constant thorn in Maegor's side, one of which he could never truly put down...  Maegor was fighting other battles as well, he met with his nephew and would-be king Aegon in battle as the latter sought to regain what was rightfully his, but died in his efforts.  Maegor kept the family of his other nephews with him as hostage to assure his rule, but when some managed to escape he had King Aneys' second son Viserys tortured to death.  Maegor's rule was rife with many injustices, too many to go into here, but as his rule continued the more his support waned. The Faith Militant gained support from several lords of Westeros and continued to trouble Maegor, until finally Maegor decreed it law that the Faith Militant could be no more, that the Faith could no longer be armed... This became to be known as ""Maegor's Law"" .  However the troubles and loss of support did not stop, not until under mysterious circumstances King Maegor died, sitting upon the Iron Throne.

- Conciliation and Septon Barth.

The Faith Militant uprising was inherited by the youngest nephew of King Maegor, as King Jaehaerys I Targaryen took his place as ruler of Westeros.   Among his first acts as King was to fix the mistakes his uncle had made, chief of most was to make peace with the Faith.  King Jaehaerys offered amnesty to those in the faith that had opposed the crown, in turn for adherence to Maegor's Law.  The Faith accepted the terms of the King and the Faith Militant was officially disbanded, in consideration that the crown always protect the faith when they needed it, this is where the term ""Protector of the Faith"" comes from in the many titles that the King holds.  This act is known as ""The Conciliation"" and gave King Jaehaerys his moniker of ""The Conciliator"".  The King also took a septon as his Hand of the King, a Septon by the name of ""Barth"", and together ruled the seven Kingdoms in peace for over 4 decades. 

Before we move on the the next section a few words on Barth, Barth was a long time friend of Jaehaerys prior to him becoming King.  He is remembered as one of the most brilliant men who has ever lived in the seven Kingdoms and was appointed to the library in Kings Landing for that reason, and that is where Jaehaerys met him.. During their reign Barth helped the king develop the drainage and plumbing standards in the city, helped write a unified code of law to help govern. And truly the most capable hands that has ever served the realm, who served for 40 years until his death.  Now back to his intelligence, Barth is curiously a diamond in the rough apart from other septons of the Faith in regards to learning and intelligence, even more so than the Maesters of the citadel.  He was highly adept at the studying of the higher mysteries, or Magic.  His best known work ""Unnatural History"" speaks on the nature of dragons, but he also wrote many other works on the nature of carrier ravens, the doom of Valyria, and even some of which were prophetic.. but sadly, for reasons we will cover in a bit, most of Barth's work is lost to history and only fragments of which remain..  Barth was one of the most influential figures of his time and one of the best things to come out of the Faith.  

---------------

**A Faith with a King as One of their Own**

One of the Most controversial figures in the History of Westeros has to be King Baelor I Targaryen.  A highly religious and highly pious King, Baelor is known for advancing the cause of the Faith much more so than any King before or after him, and it was under his rule that the Faith held the most influence since before Aegon's conquest nearly 160 years prior.  King Baelor was a septon, a member of the faith amongst the Royal family and it showed in his reign as King.

Aside from the many deeds that Baelor is known for, such as his barefoot walk and peace treatings with Dorne, saving his cousin Aemon The Dragon Knight, not consummating his marriage, and locking his wife away in the Maidenvault (more on these if you want to check out the series I did on the Targaryen Dynasty during the off season between seasons 3 and 4), Baelor's biggest contribution to the faith was the building of the great Sept in Kings Landing, the sept that would eventually carry his name..  This great Sept would finally serve a purpose in relocating the headquarters of the faith from the Starry Sept in Oldtown to this new one in King's Landing, and so there have they been ever since.  The Faith has not only position to the capital city and all it's inhabitants, but also direct contact with the Royal family from then on.

Petyr's plan is to ally with Stannis to help him take the north and give it to Sansa and then he will have the Eyrie, The North, and Stannis's men, plus maybe the Stormlands via Stannis and that was all the things Ned and Robert had to do their last rebellion. Plus, the Lannisters are weaker now then the Targaryens ever were.

Why? Well imagine for a second that Stannis is successful in this war and wins the Iron Throne. But what do you know, he died somehow before he could take his throne - perhaps from wounds sustained in his final battle. Then who is left to take the throne? Stannis has one child - a daughter and Petyr is unmarried, and I belive not above marrying children. Petyr will propose marriage to Stannis's only child to solidify their alliance and to give Stannis the Eyrie and the North via Sansa. Stannis is too pragmatic to turn away from this chance and it he can rationalized it away by assuming he will father a male child later.

Of course Danny's dragons and the ice zombie apocalypse will ruin these plans but Petyr doesn't know much about those threats and until then its a solid plan that could work.",5,3,False,self,,,,,

Sansa is going to eventually recognize Reek/Theon.  She's doing to decide to get her revenge on him too.  Because, let's face it, he deserves it.

Therefore, HBO believes he would even go so far as to hand over Sansa to the Boltons. This seems like a stupid plot point for a couple of reasons:
1) What does Littlefinger gain from stabilizing the North in theory? Not much, chaos is opportunity for someone like him.
2) He is safe in the Eyrie, which means he is not motivated by any fear of the Boltons or any other powerful family for that matter

Moving beyond these strategic considerations, it's my belief that Littlefinger's main reason for pursuing power and playing the game of thrones at all is that he was rejected by Cat Stark because he was not from a powerful family. Having Sansa is symbolic for Littlefinger for this reason (she reminds him of Cat), and is not a piece he would so easily concede for the pursuit of power alone and a relationship which does not seem to clearly give him a more powerful position anyways.

What seems more likely is that HBO is manufacturing interest by creating buzz by violating the storyline and seeing people react online - especially when the series' natural plot points are not buzzing along (there are some slow moments). I fear this will only continue until GRRM finishes the series. I also believe the Sansa plot point was his reason for releasing a new Sansa chapter just before the series aired.",8,0,False,self,,,,,

He went on to tell me that this is probably foreshadowing the killing of Stannis - by Brienne. I didn't want to believe him, but I've heard her say it and now and the thought of it happening terrifies me.

But then my Dad said something shocking. The scene ended and I told him about the theory that Brienne will kill the one true king, and he said he would have thought that it doesn't foreshadow Brienne killing him, but Pod.

In the same scene we see her tell Pod she's gonna teach him how to be a knight, this pleases him. We know he wants to impress Brienne, or gain her approval, and we know that he knows she's out for the Mannis. I think it'd be unexpected and an interesting thing to pull, even if it's entirely speculated, and I want the Mannis to not be killed.

That blew a couple of my fuses! For me GOT is not a series that you causally watch in the morning while eating your cereals and painting your nails. Its a series made to be watched on the comfy sofa, with snacks and your beloved by your side.... 

By doing like she did, it was like pissing on GOT for me. Also I don't want the humilation of having to watch the episodes to catch up with her.

Personally in the books he cares a lot more for Sansa because of Catyln and I think he is trying to help her).


I think the deviation from the books by the show runners accomplishes a couple things: 

-it speeds up the timeline of Sansa getting back to winterfell 

-by combining plotlines it eliminates lesser known characters in an attempt to make the show less confusing (they have done this in a lot of other situations) 

-It immediately throws Sansa into a position where she can have a direct effect and act more like the heroine that the TV audience wants. See below:






To make the TV audience happier it makes sense to throw her into a situation where she can start scheming and making moves rather than just tucking her in the Eyre for the next couple years and just coasting into winterfell after the dust settles. Here she's operating behind enemy lines. Remember that the Manderly's are doing the same thing, and theon is as well, so she will have allies. The Boltons may only want her name, but once they get to winterfell she will be protected.

I think this is the only realistic reason why they would have changed her plot. I cant imagine the showrunners would have changed her plot just to put her in the hands of another sadistic asshole. I think shes being put in this situation because she is going to start acting like a boss. The TV audience is sick of her getting the short end of the stick and the showrunners wouldn't invent more shitty things for Sansa just because. She's now in a situation where she is going to have allies in the Manderly's and northerners. I am excited to see what happens here and so far I am very intrigued by the tweaks the show is making.",4,5,False,self,,,,,

There is such a plethora of treasures to mine in their characters and stories, that I could not wait to see them brought to life on the small screen.

But as casting news came, none of the Greyjoys were revealed. Balon Greyjoy remained alive, and nothing seemed on the horizon. D&amp;D could not even be bothered to get Theon's sister's name right! And they even messed up her arc when they had her appear and try to save Theon.

And that thought brought me to some clarity. All the Greyjoy's were ever good for to D&amp;D was to advance Theon's story. They didn't even worry about Asha's name (Yara), nor Balon when the leaches burned in fire promised Stannis the death of each other 'King'.

So, why did they have 'Yara' try to come rescue Theon?

I conclude that they had to add that scene just to finish off the Greyjoy story, and bring closure to the characters they needed before to build Theon's story (the only Greyjoy the show will follow). In that rescue, 'Yara' tried, failed, and gave up. We've not seen them since. I think we won't.

I believe that D&amp;D wrapped up, to them, the entire Iron Islands involvement with the show (and through Theon), with that one scene they added (and we all found an odd addition). And if we conclude the addition of that scene was for that reason, then the inclusion of that scene means there will be no King's Moot, no Crow's Eye, and no Dusky Woman... not this season, nor any other.

In fact, the current need to get Sansa into Winterfell may just be because they have written Asha/Yara (and the Iron Islanders) out of the show, and need her there to progress elements that Asha would have had. In fact, almost every deviation of the show from the books currently can likely be traced back to the addition of that one scene D&amp;D added, where Yara tries to save Theon, and gives up. There is no Loras of the Kingsguard at Dragonstone, no Redwyn fleet, because there is no Iron Islands invasion coming to threaten Highgarden. There is no Quagmire around Mereen because there is no Victarion to come break the blockade. There is no Sam at Oldtown because there is no Euron coming to attack the Citadel, hoping to find something, and there is no Marwyn working with him.

The only way they could have written the Iron Islands out of the show was to have them give up on Theon. Similarly, the only way they would have added that scene is if they had decided to give up on the Iron Islands. As such, the presence of that scene on the show means that D&amp;D had known back in Season 4 that the Iron Islands plots were done in the show. For them, to consolidate the show into 7 seasons like they want, it makes sense to cut out so much at once. As to what that means for the eventual parts that the Iron Islands will play in the written story, who can say. They may be less-important, or, like the Sansa plot we are seeing, they may just fold them into others, meaning the actions are important, if not necessarily the players. It likely means the books and show are going to deviate a lot, though, as they attempt to tell the same essential story... and because of the importance of this scene, it likely was in Season 4 where D&amp;D decided to go their own way with the telling of the tale.

**TL:DR - I believe every one of the storylines the Iron Island was involved with will be cut or given to others, and the addition of the scene with 'Yara' trying to rescue Theon proves it.**

First with people expecting her to make a grand appearance in the S4 finale, and now speculation on if/when she will appear in S5. Recently I came across an article stating people had seen actress Michelle Fairley credited on IMDB as the ""hooded woman"" for 5x10 of GOT(I'll try &amp; dig up this article again- no luck right now). This credit has been since removed. I personally think this storyline is still in the realm of possibility. Pod &amp; Brienne are still together in the woods not doing much, can we assume they'll eventually come across the brotherhood? If they start dropping a hint that random Freys are being killed across the west I might consider this a done deal. During the last episode of GOT (5X03) I couldn't help but feel a little foreshadowing of the end of Pod when he's telling the story of him *almost* being hung. 

After last season I reasoned with myself that they might entirely drop this storyline to save us the reaction of a better resurrection later on(Jon perhaps?). But then why would they make the point of introducing us to the brotherhood in the first place? Why show us the resurrection of Beric Dondarrion if not to foreshadow Lady Stoneheart's storyline?

I think there's a real possibility to see some zombie Cat during the season finale. With Jamie's storyline taking him totally off course from the book, it would make sense that they wouldn't have Brienne start this mission to find him until season 6.

Maybe just wishful thinking. But I think this jaw-dropper is just too good to skip on for the writers. What do y'all think?",4,0,False,default,,,,,

I don't know if it's just me but it feels a bit as if the writing's slipped a bit this season. Maybe because they're deviating from the books a bit more... I mean in the sense that they had so much material to cram into the early seasons, every word pretty much had a weight to it. They condensed a lot of material into few well chosen words, wheras so far in S5 it seems to be lacking a bit of punch? At a time when tension should be ratcheting up.

Same with characterisation, a few times now I've thought its all getting a bit modern day conversational where in the past you got a strong sense of the characters and the setting from how they spoke.

As book readers, I'm sure some of us weren't too thrilled (at first) with the sharp deviation that Sansa's plot took in S5/E3 the other night. I think, like many other instances in the show, this is going to create an extremely interesting and uncomfortable plot segue for Sansa. We know the show writers have replaced book character situations with characters we've come to sympathize with.

Which brings me to my theory... in the books we know that Jeyne Poole married Ramsay, and we know what craziness ensued afterwards involving our favorite dickless friend and a jump - and we know where they're going! I think that Sansa's fate will be the same as Jeyne's. How cool would that be?!

So in the books it is clearly stated how Tommen and Margaery do not consummate their marriage at all, and Cersei is extremely jealous of her because she thinks that Margaery will be the new, young, beautiful Queen that will end up over throwing her. In this weeks episode (and I know the TV makers are making the kids older in the show so that it isn't as creepy to watch) the bedroom scene between Tommen and Margaery happened. My question is, what's going to happen between Cersei and Margaery now? Cersei is out to get Margaery by trying to get her arrested because she does everything in her power to prove that Margaery is not being true to her husband and is having an affair. We know this because she drinks a special tea to make it so that she cannot get pregnant. It is speculated that she is having an affair with the singer that comes and sings to her and her friends constantly. Why else would she need to drink this tea unless she was having sex, and she is presumed to still be a virgin because she never consummated her marriage with Remly, and that's the whole reason she was able to be married to Joffery, who then died on their wedding day, and then Tommen. Once all this comes out Margaery turns the attention around to Cersei. Cersei ends up getting arrested. She eventually has to confess her sins of incest after all these years, and then repents by having to walk through King's Landing naked. How is this going to play out now?

This scene has a lot of tension, not only because of the content of the dialogue, but also because of the camerawork. The cinematographer knows his basic tricks; he uses them on several occasions. One of the most basic laws of camerawork is the 180-rule. It says that when two characters are interacting, they should stay in the side of the screen the began on. Nearly every professional film does this. But here, in this scene, it is broken.
Let me show you:

[The scene opens with Petyr being on the right and Sansa on the left](http://imgur.com/dLWbarl)

[When Moat Cailin is revealed, they have changed places, creating tension directed towards the castle](http://imgur.com/H01kPJ8) This shot is also fantastic in its symbolism, dividing the two characters and is also a lot darker than the others.

[Now, it's changed again and being that way for awhile to recreate the status quo](http://imgur.com/y3FOske)

[And now the most interesting thing: Here places are changed within the shot](https://imgflip.com/gif/ks0n8) Furthermore, all throughout the scene, there has been used stable and solid camerawork, but here the camera breaks from that in just that one second creating so much tension. The viewer is subconsciously disrupted and gets the same feel that Sansa gets, when a Petyr comes near. This could have been so boring a scene thinking, but here it is used so well and also throughout the episode.

[Like here; were conversed triangles show the instability of the Bolton control of the north](https://imgur.com/yxykI9v) or in the Casterly Rock Scene, were Tommen shows his silent dominance by also breaking the 180-rule.

I'm also looking for blogs or columns with more specialized content. For example, [The Hamfan](http://generalhamfannery.blogspot.ca/2014/02/game-of-threads-costume-analysis-s1e1.html) does a collection of photo essays about they symbolism and foreshadowing of the show's costuming (love the essays, but sadly Hamfan hasn't posted new ones in a while).

Should I start with ASOIAF and read the 5 books in sequence? I've heard of a prequel (Tales of Dunk and Egg?) about the Mad King, should I read that first to see if I like the reading style?

(1) Tyrion can't stand the monotony of the trailer ride.

(2) Tyrion wants to get out and see other faces.

(3) After many faces and a Red God gathering, it's time for a brothel.

(4) Go to brothel, see fine looking merchandise.

(5) Strike up conversation with skeptical prostitute.

(6) Look at prostitute's hand again and again, and get cold feet. Wait what? Tyrion decides NOT to get with a whore?


So....what exactly happened? Did she have grayscale? They were just talking about it in the previous episode. Was she pregnant, and rather than her hand he was actually looking at her stomach? Did he have thoughts of Shae? If non-spoilery, would some book context help me understand what happened here?

Everyone thinks he's this dumbass fuckin flower man with no over love than ships and Tommen of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. But what I love about this series and George RR Martin in general, is that we only understand the world from the perspectives of certain charcaters. Non-POV characters like Mace, Doran, and Littlefinger have complete control over their identities, because their identites are power. You absolutely CANNOT underestimate a single character like so many seem to be doing with Mace. That's the point. Remember what you thought about Jaime Lannister after season one? Remember the weird snake man who came from that desert place you kinda remember in season 4, and how AWESOME he turned out to be? One of the major running themes in A Song of Ice and Fire is that characters are absolutely not what they see, and any character good or evil, smart or dumb, has SOME level of validity for their way of being. Now, I'm not saying Mace is some kind of top-secret badass with a plan (though I think we all know he is), he very well may be a dumbass flower man. But my point is that THAT'S OKAY. It's fine to be a dumbass flower man, great even. Out of all the characters in the whole series, Mace Tyrell has earned the Most power with the Least amount of effort. Mace Tyrell has the largest net gain in the story.

I love Mace so much. What I love about him is just how little he gives a shit as long as he gets what he wants. He doesn't give a single fuck about think about him, all that matters is that he puts the pieces in place. He's content to be the idiot sycophant, because that's exactly what will gain him the most power. That's what's great about being the second richest house with one of the largest private armies, people can think you're an idiot and it won't matter because you're MACE FUCKING TYRELL, and you have your own army, fortune, and a long line of legitimate heirs to supplant the Seven Kingdoms. Who cares if the Lannisters think you're weak when YOUR army is guarding THEIR king? Mace can be as weak as he wants and it won't stop him from kicking ass.

Here's something important when analyzing the Tyrell game plan. Their House words are ""Growing Strong"". That's it. It seems lame compared to ""Hear me Roar,"" ""Ours Is The Fury"" and ""Winter is Coming,"" but look at those houses now! All of the ""power"" houses burned bright after Robert's Rebellion but are quickly losing steam after years of costly war. Meanwhile, the Tyrells have been planting seeds (seeds! flowers! growing strong! the game plan is in the imagery!) everywhere to allow their eventual rise to power. That's what they do, that's how they seize their power: They plant roots and grow until they eventually choke out their competitors. Mace is in it for the Long Con, and he's fine to be a dumb door-opener. It works great for him. Being master of ships gives him his own fleet, he already has an army, and every day more and more Tyrells spread through King's landing like a weed, taking key positions of power, especially the city guard. And all he has to do is smile and open some doors? That's a great fuckin gig, Mace. He's probably one of the only actually happy people in the entire series. Wouldn't you be happy if you're daughter was becoming queen and you're house was gaining immense power while all you had to do was have some ships and fuck bitches?

Think about how the Tyrells even became a Great House in the first place. They used to be a vassal house for the Gardeners, the TRUE Lords of the Reach. They followed orders and were rewarded for it. They gained power by appealing to the greater house and earned more land and more wealth. Eventually when Aegon conquered the Reach, their accumulated wealth made them the logical choice to take over. What did they do to earn The Reach? Surrender.Where the gareners revolted and were punished, the Tyrells gave the Reach to Aegon and bent the knee, and in return he gave them great power and charged them with control of The Reach. THAT'S how the Tyrells even exist in the first place. They surrender. They play meek and mild until their enemies have battered themselves to a point of weakness. Like his forefathers before them, Mace is gaining immense power by doing as he's told and waiting. He's Growing Strong.

But of course, every great house needs SOME push every once and a while. That's where Olenna comes in. Now, everyone thinks that SHE is the MVP of Team Tyrell, and they're right! But it's foolish to discount Mace as significant too. They are two sides of the same flower. Mace is the Rose to the Queen of Thorns. Mild and innocent, even sweet to some. Mace's complacency is what ALLOWS Olenna to thrive as well as she does. They're a brilliant pair, regardless of if they recognize it or not. Olenna could never get away with her scheming if the head of their house wasn't such a lovable, easy-to-manipulate host. There's a 12/8 year old boy on the Iron Throne directly in the pocket of his daughter, and all he has to do is smile for Tommen and play with his kittens. Great. Fuckin. Gig.

Something that unfortunately hasn't been translated well to the show is how sinister the Tyrell invasion has been. It's been happening since season one, and no one has really taken notice yet. Except for Cirsei. Think about it, they went from that gay dude you kinda remember with Renly Barratheon to arguably the Supreme Power in King's Landing (and therefore the Seven Kingdoms). Mace has been finding high-ranking suitors for his entire brood, and they're slowly establishing a lineage that will make them stronger than ever. In the books we get to see it described very subtlely. But over the course of the series there have been more and more Tyrell bannerman infiltrating Kings Landing. Not unlike when Tyrion restructured the city to put his people in power, Mace has been pulling those strings quietly for years. And by book five we start to see the fruits of his labor. There are so many Goddamn Tyrells in Kings Landing now. George RR Martin makes a point to emphasize whenever we see Green cloaks or a Flower, and we slowly see more green, and more flowers growing stronger and stronger as Mace prepares to pull his roots toght round the necks of his enemies.

And the best part? Everyone loves the Tyrells. What's not to love? Margery and Ser Loras are beatutiful verging on the status of Legend, Garth is rich and powerful if not gross, Olenna has a whole pack of supporters to protect her, and Mace is THE most inoffensive motherfucker in the whole Seven Kingdoms. Imagine if Littlefinger didn't run sketchy brothels and obviously act like a general snake? That's the position Mace Tyrell is in. And it's driving Cirsei fucking CRAZY, because she's losing allies left and right, and she's the only one who can see what the Tyrells are planning, and literally NO ONE will understand her about it. Cirsei still expects nothing from Mace because he's been giving everything she wants. But in doing so and being so weak, mace has indebted the crown to the Tyrell favor. Oh you guys need an army? have mine! Can't pay the iron bank? We got it! And now Mace keeps pushing for a little bit more, and no one is able to refuse. Hey can we get some of our guys on the City Watch? I mean, we DID save the entire city with our army, etc. The Tyrell's are both on their way to power AND beloved, a combination that drives Cirsei right off the edge. Wouldn't you if you watched everything you work for crumble under the roots of the New Popular Kid from school?

It's heavily implied through subtext that the Tyrell's are planning something big, if not consciously. Every adjective used to describe them carries an implication of slow treachery. ""Growing,"" ""Thorne,"" ""Root,"" ""Weed,"" even ""The Reach"" carries a certain level of envy and desire. This is absolutely intentional. George RR Martin's writing is riddled with symbolism and visual metaphors. Every house, character, animal, and color scheme is a direct reflection of their unique personalities and style of Gameplay. The Tyrell's are consistently in second place, poorer than The Lannisters (well maybe not anymore) and weaker than Dorne, yet here they are Reaching for the ultimate power. Mace knows exactly what he's doing, and his influence is directly imparted onto Margery. You don't need Power to be powerful, is the message. You can rule with love instead of fear, and have the people never even know you're ruling them. You don't need to be on a throne to command an army or make political gains. Margery rules with her beauty. Tommen and the rest of Kings Landing are eating out of her pockets while she drops subtle hints that keep her in full control. Mace is doing the same thing, only replacing Beauty with Flattery. He asserts his power and influence by distancing himself from enemies and complimenting his allies. The only direct fear now that I can see is Dorne (And not just specifically the Martells). In this season both Dorne AND the Tyrell's are receiving more screentime and backstory, and I don't think that's a coincidence. They have a rocky relationship as is, and now the Lannisters have fucked that up beyond repair (thanks to our friend The Mountain), only now with the Tyrells ruling a Lannister King (as Dorne sees it), it seems that they're quickly becoming forced to face their only enemy. An enemy who sees the Tyrells for what they are. A desert in which no seeds can grow, no flowers can bloom. Mace Tyrell has once again placed himself into Second Place, the second best place to be. They may be growing strong, but the last of the power houses is coming for them, Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken.",121,519,False,self,,,,,

I have thoughts on the last chapter of Jon Snow, I thought i'd share them seeing how the winds of winter may come soon.
My thoughts are of the coup that took place and the cause and effect. In the very last chapter we know Jon Snow gets stabbed 4 times, once in the stomach once in the shoulder, once in the back, and another unknown location... This is not something he is likely to survive, seeing how there is no maester on hand, My thoughts went straight to Melisandre... isn/t there a chance she could bring him back with the ritual used to bring back Beric Dondarrion? and is that the reason GRRM brought it up multiple times? But then i kept thinking.. If he is brought back wouldnt he be free of his vow to the night's watch seeing as he had already died, and be able to take the role as Jon Stark, Lord of Winterfell OR if the R+L=J theory is true vie for the throne. Now my second thought was IF the R+L=J theory IS true wouldn't this cause a problem? seeing how aegon would also be a son of rhaegar, who would be first in terms of succession? Jon is First born from one mother while Aegon heir from another, Could it lead to a war similar to the blackfyre rebellion?
I don't know if any of this would actually fit but it was just a string of thoughts i had...

Stannis is leaving Castle Black for Winterfell shortly. Brienne is already on her way there, and she would love to take revenge on Stannis for killing Renly. When Stannis arrives he will attack Winterfell and kill the Boltons. Somewhere in the midst of all of this action Brienne succeeds in her mission of revenge. 

Sansa may also die in this battle, or she could end up ruling the North. Who knows?

Little Finger will end up advising Sansa or weaseling away somewhere.

*Flash forward*...

Sam ""read in a book"" or somehow figures out that dragons will be a huge help in fighting off White Walkers (no shit). As the new lord commander, Jon Snow will send a raven to Dany in Meereen, who will then leave with her dragons (which she probably will be riding) to destroy the White Walkers. Tyrion will probably play some part in convincing her as he has been to The Wall and is a friend of Lord Commander Snow. Once she arrives, a great battle will ensue. At some point Bran will control a dragon with his worq power. 

After the battle is over and Dany, the Nights Watch, and whoever else may be fighting come out victorious, Dany will decide that there should not be a wall between the North and South anymore, that all people are equal. She will proceed to burn down the wall with dragon fire. Because there would be no wall, the Nights Watch would be disbanded. Jon Snow would become John Stark by decree of the Queen, and rule the North.

Meanwhile, Cersei has a proposal for you. If you can help both her and Joffery escape back to Casterly Rock, she will make you wealthy beyond your wildest dreams (with a castle to boot) and everybody knows the Lannisters always pay their debts.

The show has gone out of its way to characterise Loras primarily by his sexuality. From the books, which I've only read the first 3, he is always a knight first. Even Oliver, Littlefinger's spy/brothel manager, has more facets to his life.

In episode 1 of this season (5) Margery warns Loras to keep his sexuality under the radar. He responds that everybody already knows. King Renly has also been mentioned a few times in the 3 Episodes we've had so far and Brienne calls him out for liking men. This put a focus on a issue we've not really mentioned for a while. 
Recently we just saw Cersei offer a power play to the High Sparrow, a religious zealot. He comes across very charismatic and what not as a religious leader often is but it contrasts strongly with the actions of his followers. I predict that when he finally reveals his true darker side it will be Loras who suffers. There is a homophobic tendency in the culture of Westeros, with the constant remarks, and its why Margery would worry about him. I can see The High Sparrow seeing his homosexuality as sinful and making an example of him. We've already seen that he is not afraid to go after high profile people i.e. the high septon. Cersei is already enraged with Margery and perhaps would like to bring her down a few pegs by killing her brother in such a manner. It would also free her of any expectation to marry him.

Just a theory and I hope you guys enjoyed. I would also love to see the chain of reactions in Kings Landing should this happen. Thoughts appreciated. ",89,113,False,self,,,,,

(6 million on the show)

Assuming 1 Dragon = 1 U.S gold eagle, which is 1.09 Troy Ounce. Lets round that down to 1 TO for the sake of argument.

1 Metric Ton of gold = 32,151 TO. Or 32,151 Golden Dragons.

So 7 million coins/32,151= 217 Tons of gold.

Wait, Hold it. 

To put that in prospective, The Crown's debt approximately equal to 43% of modern European Union (2013)'s reserve numbers.

It is just kind of mind bogging. I just cannot even fathom how Robert was able to spend all that gold.  The only thing I can think of is Robert's government didn't physically get all of the gold, but accept it as a form of account payable/letter of credit (Say, from good old IB).
