I've already watched all three seasons of the show and I love getting more detailed information on the events I already know, especially in regards to the King in the North scene (I literally got chills while listening to this scene). 


Anyways, my question is in regards to the final Daenerys chapter. 
I've heard on this subreddit multiple times that Targaryens are not immune to fire, and Daenerys stepping from the fire unharmed was more than likely a miracle of some sort.


However, before she has Mira Maz Duur put into the pire the maege comments that she knows what Daenerys is doing and it won't work because Daenerys does not know the proper words. Daenerys replies that she learned from Mira that only death can beget life. 


Is it possible that the dragons were born from some sort of blood magic. Within the funeral pyre we have three deaths: Drogo, the horse, and Mira. From the fire three dragons are born. Three deaths for three lives. 

To add to this, we hear Mira ""singing"" before she dies. We already know that Mira is a blood mage and that in order to do the ritual with Drogo early, she had to sing in order to inact the magic. Is it possible that the birth of the dragons and the survival of Daenerys was not a miracle but the result of Blood Magic?

I'm curious to hear your opinions on this, thanks!",70,50,False,self,,,,,

They have a few paintings of GoT scenes and a case where they compare the execution scene from S1E1 between the script for the show and the scene in the book. There's not a whole lot of GoT things, but I learned a few interesting things I didn't know before. For example, I had no idea that Jon Snow is only 12 years old at the start of the series.

Besides this, there are a lot of neat things in the exhibits. They have David Bowie's goblin king outfit from Labyrinth, some props from the Narnia movie series, Inigo Montoya's costume and sword (and the six-fingered man's glove) from The Princess Bride. They also have horror and science fiction exhibits with more cool props. They have a few stakes from Buffy, an Alien from Alien, excerpts from Bram Stoker's original manuscript of Dracula, the saw from Saw, and the captain's chair from Star Trek (the original series). Along with a whole bunch of other interesting stuff from different media.

Finally, they have a couple music exhibits. One about Nirvana, one about female rock stars, and a sound lab where you can play around on drums, guitar, or keyboard.

Just a little tip for any GoT fans in the Seattle area looking for something fun to do for a few hours.",10,1,False,self,,,,,

What epic poem would you choose for the next Game of Thrones promo?",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1jiu3z/no_spoilers_so_amcs_breaking_bad_has_shelleys/,capybroa,1375393160,"If you haven't seen it, AMC released a trailer for the final installment of episodes in the last season of *Breaking Bad*, and it was, quite simply, [twenty-one flavors of badass](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3dpghfRBHE).

The clip features Bryan Cranston, who plays the high school chemist/meth merchant Walter White on the show, intoning the verses to Percy Bysshe Shelley's 19th century sonnet ""[Ozymandius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozymandias)"" over footage of the vacant New Mexico desert. It works for many reasons: the two works' shared subject matter of the fleeting nature of power and ambition, the significance of the empty and alien landscape as a visual counterpart of the march of time and the decay of human achievement described in the poem, and the twin figures of Ozymandias and Walter White, powerful, vain, and but still vulnerable. 

However, this trailer also works because ""Ozymandias"" is a grand, sweeping poetic work that deals with larger-than-life characters and themes, and Breaking Bad is also unquestionably a ""big"" show, one that operates along an operatic emotional range and uses intense visual gestures and symbolism to touch on lots of dramatic territory. It is a psychological study in epic form as well as a crime drama.

Given how great this trailer is, I wondered how this kind of preview style could work for *Game of Thrones*. Specifically, **If you wanted to make a trailer like this for this show, what poetic work would you use, which actor(s) should narrate it, and what should it look like?**

I'll be submitting my own entry a little later in the comments, but in the meantime I want to hear from the rest of you. It could be a very well known work or a barely known one and you could use one of the cast leads or one of the minor characters to voiceover. What visuals would you focus on? Would you show a sweeping montage of characters or focus on small, suggestive details and objects, like a sword, a crown, a chair? The editing room is yours.

Has anyone tried this method, and would you recommend it?  


 I was thinking of showing my friends that link because the most common AFFC complaint is the fact that characters like Jon Snow, and Dany don't show up, also, AFFC's slow pace.  Seems like it would address both issues.

""He said that ... ""something else"" was at work, and by the end of the series, we would all know what it was.""

Something is 'going on' and for maximum effect the clues need to be there from the start (which works for me as a n00b reader).  The start of the series and the start of every TV episode.

Some believe planet Earth is hollow:

(apparently some Nazis thought that was how over-the-horizon radar worked).

The start of every episode shows that the story takes place in a world that slopes ~up~ in the distance: 

http://i.imgur.com/ZwTaZj0.jpg

Some theories are that the entrance to the inner earth is the poles -- the 'First Men' came from the north because they entered at the north pole.

Some believe the 'Northern Lights' (a ""curtain of light"") is the inner sun reflecting light on the external atmostphere.  

http://i.imgur.com/g7DQth7.jpg

Bran sees them in his dream when he looks to the North - ""Bran looks beyond the Wall, and beyond the **curtain of light at the edge of the world**""  

http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Game_of_Thrones-Chapter_17


**Old Nan**

Rob: ""One time she told me, the sky is blue because we live in the eye of a blue eyed giant name Macumba""

Bran: ""Maybe we do""

**""The moon is no egg""**

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9_h0egj9YY

If the dragons came from a ""second moon"", that doesn't mean they came from the void of space (if the sun and moon are inside a lollow earth).

Years pass 'normally' as the planet rotates around the sun, but winters/summers last longer than years because the internal sun has an odd/erratic orbit.

When the character Mya Stone was introduced, she was described as follows:

&gt;Her dark hair was cropped short and straight around her head, and she wore riding leathers and light shirt of silvered ringmail.

So, I looked her up to see if anyone had illustrated the character. But what I found instead, was that her appearance had been phrased very differently in any wikis.

Here's one from A Wiki of Ice and Fire:

&gt;She is a tall, strapping young woman, with coal-black hair cut short and deep blue eyes. She is said to have a mirthful, lusty personality. She tends to dress in a masculine manner, eschewing dresses for leather.

I mean-- that's not what it said in my book AT ALL. Am I reading a wrong copy or something? The book I have is bought from Google Play. It's [this](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/George_R_R_Martin_A_Game_of_Thrones_A_Song_of_Ice_?id=JPDOSzE7Bo0C).

Got a favour to ask; i'm up to date with the show and i'm half way through ACOK. I know you guys know your stuff, so I could use some help, it's an odd request but here goes; my sister is 14 and she's at that inbetweeny age. I think she's old enough to deal with the gore and such that is depicted in the books, but as for the sexual refrences, it is a touch graphic for me to be comfortable with it. So I got her the first book, and i'm gonna just blot out a few parts. My question is, can anyone, off the top of their head remember the parts, or even just direct me to the chapters they remember where these are. If anyone can do this for any book they remember with (spoiler tags,) as I intend to read the books before I go checking them from book three onward.

Does Tywin know that Jaime is on his way to King's Landing when he plots the Red Wedding or does he think he is still a captive of the Starks? If he thinks Jaime to be in Rob's possession, wouldn't it be dangerous to kill Rob and Catelyn and the Stark host that was at the wedding? I mean, wouldn't the people that hold Jaime take revenge on Tywin (even though they wouldn't know he gave the order) by killing Jaime (as far as I can tell, there would be no other use for him, but for maybe a peace treaty)?

What will happen to our beloved characters?? Will any of them ever find any happiness?? Will any of them find love (and not die)?? Will Joffrey get stabbed in the face countless number of times by Arya??

Here are my predictions for what the end will look for our characters. I would like to apologize in advance, I have not read any of the books, and if I somehow offend someone with my predictions, I'm sorry; these are just guesses for what the end will look like.

I tried to put a little George into every ending, but to keep my sanity made a few happy endings.

You are all more than welcome to make guesses to and please try to keep predictions tied to the Series (Season 1-3) and keep book references hidden.



Brandon (Bran) Stark - Bran would ever continue North alongside his direwolf, Summer, his helper, Hodor, and his faithful companions, the Reeds. Whatever happened to Bran is unknown, Rickon Stark would send a collection of Knights to find any trace of Bran but nothing was ever found. It is said that Bran became one with the Flora and Fauna of Westeros, The old Northers claim that he is still alive and is ever watchful of the North.
Arya Stark - Arya would go on to travel with the Hound until he was no longer of use for her, she would not kill him but keep him alive and escaped out of his custody. From here she would move from location to location using her wits to stay alive and eventually join the Faceless Men. Arya would remain ever faithful to her brothers and sister, and become a warden of the north killing those who she deemed needed judgment. She would never return home, see her siblings, or ever find Nymeria.
Sansa Stark - Sansa would remain in King's Landing until for the most unlikely person imaginable, Jaime Lannister helped her escape one night and she would cut of all her hair and escaped to the vale where she would come upon her Uncle Brynden, Under his Banner and what was left of the Stark Loyalists, She would win over the North from the Boltons and be reunited with her Brother Rickon. Sansa would greatly help the North during the winter, but due to what had happened to her over the years, She would never have any children, and would consistently be plagued by nightmares until her very young death. Many mourned her passing and one burnt man would visit her grave every year.
Rickon Stark - Rickon would escape to Bear Island under House Mormont, hidden he was baptized in warfare and a burning revenge for the crimes against his brothers and sisters. When word spread of his sister Sansa and his Uncle Brynden fighting to reclaim to North from the Boltons, he quickly brought his own force from the North and Crushed the Boltons and reclaimed the Starkland. Rickon would become King of the North and marry a girl from House Dustin. They would have many Children all named after his fallen parents, sister, and brothers. He would rule justly but harshly alongside his sister Sansa. Rickon would become known as ""The Bloody Wolf""
Theon Greyjoy - Theon would rot in Bolton dungeons for many years. His Sanity would begin to fade and he would forget anything about himself. When the Stark's took over the Dreadfort, barely able to talk or stand, Rickon would kill him out of mercy. No one remembers who he was.
Jaime Lannister - Jaime returned to King's Landing a different man. His love for his sister quickly faded and his disgust for his family filled him. He would remain in Kings Landing, as part of the Kings Guard, Watching Kings Landing fall under Joffreys reign, Jaime would do the unthinkable again, When Joffrey was rapping a peasant girl in his chambers, Jaime would kill 2 Kings Guard members and stab Joffrey in the Belly, he would then flee with Sansa and let her go home. After this, Jaime was never heard from again.
Cersei Lannister - Cersei, after the death of her beloved Son Joffrey, and the sudden disappearance of Jaime, Cersei became mad with power, ruling as regent over Tommen. She would kill both Margaery Tyrell, and her brother Tyrion blaming them for the death of Joffrey. These actions would begin the long and brutal war of House Tyrell and House Lannister. Before she would have brought Kings Landing to ruins, Varys would kill her during the night. She died cursing all of Westeros, and cursing her father for all her unhappiness. This would mark the downfall of the Lannisters and the war for the South.
Tryion Lannister - Tryion would remain ever displeased but faithful to the crown, trying to keep Shae happy and trying to keep Sansa protected. One night, word spread that Joffrey had been killed, and Tryion witnessed his brother escape with Sansa during the night. Tryion would convene with Varys and convince him to give Shae whatever she wanted and keep her protected. He would trick Shae into boarding a boat to a foreign land. Tryion was shortly after captured by Cersie, and was executed. Tryion would die smiling.
Jon Snow - Jon would remain at the Wall for years to come, he would eventually become commander of the Nights Watch and remained ever vigilant. When word spread that his Half-Brother Rickon reached him and Rickons fight for North. Jon wanted to flee to him but never did, Jon would regret this decision forever. Jon would die during the winter sad and heartbroken. Rickon, after Jons death, made him an official Stark
Ygritte - Ygritte heartbroken would return home north of the Wall. However time would come and she figured out she was pregnant with Jons child. She decided to keep it as her own and lie that the father was someone and had died. This child was born with White hair and White eyes. This child would go onto to conquer Westeros under the banner of the Frozen Dragon.

So in the book, it seemed logical for her to be able to just snap out of it and betray him like that, but in the show, it seems she's very much, purely, in love with him.

Do you think the creators have another plan for Shae? Or will they stick to the books strictly, and sweep the rug out from under our feet? I guess it will be more surprising that way, though less logical. ",48,32,False,self,,,,,

However in the book the castle is controlled by Roose Bolton after she weasel souped the guards and helped prisoners escape.



Why did she not tell Roose Bolton, a bannerman of Rob's, who she was?



Edit: Alright so you guys pretty much all agree that she simply did not trust Roose and the boltons in general. So lets do some speculating...What if she did tell Roose who she was?
I doubt Roose would hurt his liege lord's sister or even hold her hostage.

On Tuesday I walked past and saw the actors out having a smoke break and took two pictures. Other people were taking pictures as well as they walked past. I had links to them on another posts comments and someone (/u/direhound) asked that I add them all to an album. I only had two pics but went armed the next day to take more.

I haven't seen the Game of Thrones series yet (I plan to! I promise) or read the books.

I'm going to a party tomorrow where I will be wearing the costume of Hodor (my team is Game of Thrones related and they determined that was the character I was going to be)

I need help with character personality. What are his mannerisms? Is he silly? Serious? Brooding? I want to get an idea of how I should be acting to bring more realism to the role (especially since I don't look very much like him aside from being tall)

Does he have any popular quotes that would go over well if I repeated them?

Any help would be appreciated!

I'm just starting ADWD now. But I have a question or two concerning Tywin's death that I'm wondering how D &amp; D will handle:

1) Tywin dying as he's taking a shit, to me, is a big part of it. He's basically more feared and respected than most kings have been, yet he died at the hands of his demon monkey of a son *while taking a shit*. I feel like this is significant. 

Now, obviously, there is no problem showing nudity on the show (although there has been much less lately), but I feel like if you actually physically *see* Tywin Lannister taking a shit, it will make the scene too comedic. Thoughts?

2) This is the obvious statement of the year, but Tyrion was affected by the whole thing with Tysha. A lot. The book gives that so much life, with Tyrion's inner thoughts, but in the show, she's barely mentioned. Obviously the reason he killed Tywin was finding out about Tysha.

------------------------------------


I was just thinking.

I think I have something  that might lend more weight to the theory that Jon Snow is Lyanna Stark's and Rhaegar Targaryen's son.

The Kingsguard.

Ser Arthur Dayne, Ser Gerold Hightower, and Ser Oswell Whent were part of a group of Kingsguard that were considered cream of the crop. True Kingsguard, unlike what Westeros has now.

These men would have died defending the King. They would have been there to defend Aerys. The Kingsguard does not simply let itself be regulated to guard duty for Rhaegar's plaything.

Unless.

Unless the King was there(Or a notable relation, i.e. Arys Oakheart with Myrcella). When the Kingsguard was sent to the Tower of Joy, we can assume Rhaegar was still alive. What if at that time Lyanna was pregnant with Rhaegar's child? 

If you're not getting it, what if Lyanna was pregnant with the heir to the Iron Throne.

The Kingsguard would lay down their lives and die to protect him. Not the Mad King who they probably considered lost.

This links up with another theory that after the Rebellion, Rhaegar planned to depose Aerys. Which probably made him the de facto King in the interim. 

When Rhaegar was killed, then the Mad King, the heir to the throne would be... you guessed it. Jon. Which explains why the Kingsguard were there, instead of at King's Landing. 

Is this anything new? I'd be sure people have picked up on this before but I haven't seen it anywhere.",45,4,False,self,,,,,

The subreddit has once again been doused with wildfire to celebrate! We'll stay green for the next 1,000 subscribers. Thanks for helping to build such a quality community.

The mods have been talking about additional things we can do to commemorate the event, and generally have fun with it.  Some ideas already on the table include:

**a contest of some kind like**

* make the best GOT/ASOIAF wallpaper
* find the best GOT/ASOIAF wallpaper (so you don't have to make it, but first submitters get credit for the find)
* make anything GOT/ASOIAF-related (costume, jewelry, knitted figurine, 3D-printed sword, whatever)
* find the coolest GOT/ASOIAF-related thing (like the above, but you don't have to make it)

**a change to the subreddit design to mark season three**

* it ought to be specific to season 3 and not be something easily referenced in other seasons
* it has to be spoiler-free
* [Season 3/ASOS](#s ""that means no, we're not putting a wolf head on the snoo, but yes that would be cool"")

So far we don't have a consensus, but we've already hit 250K, so if anyone has another idea, please post it below, and if you like someone's idea vote it up.  If you like one of the above ideas, post it for upvotes too.  

For a prize we're talked about granting some custom flair text, and I'll donate a month of Reddit Gold.  Please feel free to post any other comments or questions below.

Cheers

Let's face it. Robb is in a very tight spot.  He has thrown over the alliance with the Freys for no better reason than he wanted to.  This shows that he is imprudent and it gives more seasoned commanders like Bolton and Karstark the impression that he is a callow boy.  It would be hard to argue with this position.  

   The Show has established that Robb needs Karstark and his men.  Karstark is blinded with rage and grief. He wants Jaime's blood.  Then, Caitlin fucks it up and lets Jaime go. Well now what should Robb have done? I have thought about it a lot and here is what I might have done. Bring the bannermen to Riverrun and assemble all the Lords and speak thusly:

  ""Lord Karstark, it is true that you are owed blood for blood for the life of your sons. However, it was my Lady Mother who has wronged you in this.  As you King I crave to give you justice, yet you would ask me to sin against the old gods by punishing my mother.  This I cannot do.  However, I trust in your wisdom and I am certain that the gods will guide you to the path of wisdom. Therefore, I leave my Lady Mother's fate in your hands.  You may pass judgement upon her."" 

 Now, if this is done in the Tully home would Karstark be foolish enough to demand her blood?  Conversely, as she is accused she has the right to trial by combat. Is there a doubt that the Blackfish could kill any champion that Karstark could put forward?  

Is Kartstark married?  What about giving him Caitlin from which to create a new line?  Certainly the option of new sons who would be half-brothers to the king has to be an attractive prospect.  

Anyway, some fun speculation.  I crave the feedback of my fellow redditors.

So now that he's in the south, do you think he'll go back and join up with Mance before the first battle at the Wall?

Also, how do you think they'll handle his relationship with Jon? In the books, they spent quite a lot of time together, and I had no problem believing that they were friends. I didn't get that so much in the show (except for the one part about the seal XD). Maybe they'll bond a bit more after Tormund is at the Wall with his people? I hope so.

The woman, High Heart, predicts and explains how two brothers murder each other for the crown that they believe is theirs(Euron/Balon &amp; Stannis/Renly). She also predicts the red wedding, the death of Joffrey and zombie Catelyn. I do have one question regarding Sansa.

In a storm of swords Arya meets the Ghost of High Heart and she tells Arya a prophecy about Sansa Stark: ""I dreamt of a maid at a feast with purple serpents in her hair, venom dripping from their fangs. And later I dreamt that maid again, slaying a savage giant in a castle built of snow.""

The first part of the prophecy might be interpreted as Sansa Stark being taken advantage off by Littlefinger and Olenna Tyrell to smuggle the poison that killed Joffrey Baratheon.

The second part, however, is a lot more unclear. It speaks of Sansa ""slaying a savage giant in a castle built of snow"" and what it refers to exactly is unknown. At the end of ADWD we are left with an anticipation that the Vale will invade the North if everything goes according to Littlefinger's plot to marry Sansa to Harry the Heir. 

""A castle built of snow"" might then refer to Winterfell in more than two ways: 1. It's held my Ramsay Snow. 2. Winterfell is currently in a midst of a snowstorm. The savage giant might thus refer to Ramsay Snow and that Sansa Stark will somehow kill Snow if and when the Vale decides to get involved. This might mean that Sansa will follow in her father's footsteps and pass both sentence and sword, as befit a true Stark. 

Another possibility is that Littlefinger is this savage giant and Sansa kills him. The castle of snow might be some sort of wedding.

Yet another possibility is perhaps Sansa slaying Theon at the wall or at Stannis's camp outside Winterfell or perhaps Hornwood that is now Ramsay's lordship.",31,12,False,self,,,,,

A small request: I found some awesome artwork of the main house animals fighting on reddit a few months ago, and recently saw it again as the artist had begun pencilling in the design. Distinguishing features were the wolf biting the lion, with a crossbow bolt in his heart, with a dead stag underneath and a kraken at the bottom, with the three dragons encircling them, along with the flower etc. 

Does anyone know what I'm talking about? It's a great piece and I'd like to buy a print for my brother's birthday coming up (who introduced me to the books so many years ago).

And we all know of Lyannas dying words, ""*promise me, Ned*"", which plagued Ned for the remainder of his life. It is also not like Ned, an honour bound man, to sleep with another woman with his wife in Winterfell! 

The room in which Ned found his sister is described as being bloody, with a strong smell of it in the air, so could she have just given birth.

To sum up his note, the fourth and fifth books are written geographically, not chronologically. They both begin where ASOS left off, and the storylines mesh together at some point in A Dance with Dragons--AFFC covers mostly events in Kings Landing, ADWD covers other regions. He states that he had begun writing everyones story when it dawned on him that AFFC would be too big to be a single volume, so he would have to split the series. He decided instead of splitting up the storylines, he would split up the locations. 

After doing some research, I found this: http://boiledleather.com/post/25902554148/a-new-reader-friendly-combined-reading-order-for-a

It provides a suggestion for combining both books chronologically. If you look in the comments, there is also a link to a pdf that combines both books in that specific manner, and can be read chronologically and not by location. 

My question is, to those who have read the books, would you have preferred to read it chronologically, or do you recommend reading it the way it is? What do you think of the above suggestion? What are pros and cons for either choice?

The professor hammered into our heads that the original notion of 'tragedy' was a story where one of the victims was the cause of their own downfall. Literature majors may take offense to such a blunt definition, but you're reading a post on Reddit. Deal with it.
What makes tragedy work (be it theater or moving picture) is the sense of inescapable fate that comes about in hindsight. A good tragic moment will be so integral to the plot that it's impossible to excise the downfall without at least excising beloved plot elements, or collapsing the story altogether.
When people accuse George RR Martin of being a sick, twisted bastard with unresolved issues, they seem to forget that no interesting story is free of evil. Real drama is about conflict and tension. Characters must face a dilemma of two equally shitty options, and the chosen option is originally presented as the lesser of two evils. Then when the tragic moment occurs, you try to convince yourself that the other choice was the real lesser of two evils, but you know it wasn't. Something else would have gone wrong. The Greeks blamed the gods, 'The Wire' blamed institutions, and 'The Sopranos' blamed untreated psychological issues. Who's to blame for the Red Wedding?

We can blame George RR Martin for being good at his job of creating compelling characters we care about even though they're not real (which sounds a description of insanity) or we can blame the characters who made the decisions. We are, after all, crazy enough to think of them as if they and their world are real. Let's run with it.

Let's go in logical order, start backwards and figure out whose fault this is:

1. It's all Robb Stark's fault: Virginity and the Karstarks

""You lost the war the day you married HER."" - Lord Rickard Karstark on Talisa Stark nee Maegyr

Actor Richard Madden revealed before Season 2 aired that he made the choice to play Robb as a virgin. Which pretty much explains everything, doesn't it?
As much as people wanted Robb to be a noble prince, he wasn't. The idea that the Red Wedding can be traced back to a virginal Robb wanting nothing more than to pop his cherry... it's pretty cynical. Robb and Talisa were presented as being in love, and that fit with the idea of noble, infallible Robb. As early as the first season, however, Robb is thinking with his dick (or at least about his dick). His reaction to finding out he has to marry a Frey girl is to ask if any of them are attractive. Robb was a fully formed human being, who just wanted to bust a nut. The fact that his sense of honor made him marry the wrong woman instead of cheating on his betrothed (in a world where that's allowed), that was his shitty choice.

It should also be pointed out that Lord Karstark, an asshole who doesn't realize that marching your sons off to war means they might die, was right on two counts. His final words, ""I want it to haunt you until the day you die"", nearly predict the Red Wedding. As a result of beheading Karstark for light treason, Karstark's men abandon Robb (a minor tragedy in and of itself). This necessitates the alliance with Lord Frey. The Karstark incident brings out more of the right advice from the wrong people. Catelyn Stark advises holding Karstark as a hostage, but Robb has never listened to his mother's advice. This becomes more pronounced after she lets Jaime Lannister loose (Most bad decisions in this show can be traced back to 'Think of the children!'). Edmure Tully is introduced to the audience as an incapable fool, which means his endorsement of the hostage idea is presented to the audience as a cowardly move.
Robb didn't listen to asshole Lord Karstark the one time he was right, and he didn't listen to Edmure and Catelyn the one time they were right. He did trust Theon, and that didn't turn out well. Surrounding yourself with people you can't trust is a bigger problem than not being able to keep it in your pants.

2. It's all Ned Stark's fault: Honor VS Gamesmanship

""Today IS a good day to die!"" - Worf, son of Mogh

Ned Stark was presented with two viable options for taking control of the Iron Throne following Robert Baratheon's death. Unfortunately, they both involved lies, ambush, and abduction of children. Ned couldn't abide by those options. The Starks have a tradition of honor, and the fact that their house dates back thousands of years makes them arrogant about that honor. Ned Stark knows he is smart, he knows he can fight, and he knows he has honor. He thinks that will be enough, and it isn't.

Honor consists of unwritten rules, and unwritten rules technically don't even exist. When Ned gives Cersei a chance to flee with her children, he's following the unwritten rule that you don't kill women and children. The written rule, of course, is that cuckolding the king is treason. Does it not occur to Ned that an emotional man like Robert Baratheon would probably have charged Ned himself with treason for letting Cersei flee? Does Ned think that Robert will let him off for old time's sake?
The real reason not to kill Cersei and her children is much more pragmatic: Tywin and Jaime Lannister would seek vengeance. In all seriousness, if Tywin's only daughter children/ Jaime's incestual lover and her children were killed, that would be one HELL of a war. Ned was never going to listen to gamesmanship players like Renly, Littlefinger or Varys. He couldn't even bring himself to publicly reveal that Cersei cuckolded Robert - Ned didn't just safeguard his own honor, he watched out for Robert's too. In a game with strict rules and professional referees, Ned Stark might have lasted.
The irony is that war tends to breed notions of honor precisely because warfare is a large act of sanctioned criminality. Soldiers killing soldiers isn't murder, and soldier taking from civilians isn't theft. 'Honor' is the original guard against crimes of war, but it doesn't work. If Ned had ever thought about the hypocrisy of honorable warfare, he might have realized that honor has no place in the game of thrones. When Ned chose to save Cersei, Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen, he doomed his own wife, son, daughter-in-law and unborn grandchild to death.

3. It's all Brandon Stark's fault: Geographical Determinism

The obvious jab is that Bran shouldn't have been climbing the old abandoned towers of Winterfell, noticing the crimes of others. So, technically speaking, the Starks were doomed from the pilot. But there's a bigger reason why the Starks never had a chance, one that goes back to the original Stark king, Brandon the Builder.
In the Pulitzer Prize winning book 'Guns, Germs and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies', Jared Diamond argues that the titular fates of societies aren't determined so much by WHO inhabits a society, but by WHERE that society is located. Critics dismissed it as 'geographic determinism', but those who know how to read maps agreed that geography determines a lot. (Don't invade Russia in winter. Just don't.) Let's apply this thinking to Westeros.

In the appendices to 'A Game of Thrones' and the special features to the first season DVD, the basic history of Westeros is outlined. The First Men were (duh) the first humans on the continent, and set up  dozens of kingdoms from Dorne to the North. After the Andals invaded from Essos, the only First Men kingdom to survive was The North, ruled by the Starks. 

Studying various canonical maps reveals that Andalos is located more or less east of The Vale and The Riverlands, comfortably south of The North. It's reasonable to assume that when the Andals sailed west, they didn't land in the North. The Andals most likely approached the North via The Neck. The books mention that The Neck is a vast marshland, and the Kingsroad is a causeway of raised dirt wide enough for wagons to camp on. The first book also explicitly mentions that the castle at Moat Cailin can be held by as few as 1000 archers. The implication is that Moat Cailin overlooks the causeway, and no army trying to invade the North can pass this bottleneck. When Greatjon Umber boasts that the old Kings in the North beat back armies 'ten times their size', he was probably referring to battles along the causeway and Moat Cailin. If those battles were in the snow, it officially makes the North the Russia of Westeros.

Speaking of snow, there's also a negative side to the North's isolation. The size of Robb's army, 20,000 men, is mentioned several times in both Book 1 and the series. It's also mentioned that the Lannisters have 60,000 men at the end of the first season, and Renly and the Tyrells have a combined army of 100,000. The wealth of the Lannisters means that their soldiers are most likely mercenaries, with the possibility of raising new armies by hiring new men. Early in the second season a minor lord speaking to Bran Stark mentions that all the young men have gone off south to fight. This implies not only that the Stark army is composed of conscripts, but that they have already rallied every last man in the North. When Robb says in season 3 that they need their men more than the Lannisters need theirs, he means that they have no possibility of reinforcements. Every battle is a potential last stand for the Starks before the fighting even begins. That's a bad way to wage a war.
The North is stated to be as big as the other six kingdoms combined, but it's implied to be mostly worthless land, incapable of supporting as many people as the southern kingdoms. The features that make the North defensible make it a terrible base for further conquest. Maybe the Starks have held the throne and lordship of the North for millennia because no one else wants it. And if the North had had a larger army to begin with, Robb wouldn't have needed Walder Frey.

4. It's all Benjen Stark's fault: Marriage and the Freys

""These are perilous times, and the crown must forge new alliances. These alliances must often be sealed in matrimony."" - Tyrion Lannister

""She's got huge... tracts of land!"" - Monty Python

This one is also about Brandon 'The Builder' Stark, and the thing he built, The Wall. And Benjen Stark, First Ranger of the Night's Watch, who has no idea that his family is getting it's ass kicked and couldn't do anything about it even so. In short, the Starks wasted generation after generation marrying excess sons to The Wall when they should have been marrying Frey girls.
To wit: Ned Stark had one sister, Lianna, an older brother, Brandon and a younger brother, Benjen. There is no mention of any Stark uncles or cousins. There is an endless supply of Lannister cousins for Robb to take hostage, so where are the other Starks? They never existed.
Robert's Rebellion begins when Robert Baratheon's betrothed, Lianna, is kidnapped by the Crown Prince. Lord Rickard and Brandon die in negotiations gone wrong (to put it mildly) with the Mad King, and Benjen appears to have already joined the Night's Watch. This not only leaves Ned in charge, but alone. The alliance of Houses Stark and Baratheon honors an impending marriage. House Arryn joins them because Jon Arryn raised Ned and Robert in the Vale, making them the children he never had (Where are the other Arryns?). House Tully joins the alliance when Ned and Jon marry Catelyn and Lysa Tully, respectively.
House Martell of Dorne sides with the Targaryens when Crown Prince Rhaegar marries one of their daughters, and the Lannisters sit it out because the Mad King named Tywin's favorite son, Jaime, to the celibate order of the Kingsguard (just to piss Tywin off). Then, after Tywin performs a war-winning assist, Robert marries Cersei Lannister.
In other words, the families with extra children to survive tragedies and available for marriage formed the largest alliance and won.

Which is where Walder Frey's penis comes in.
Frey's first scene in the TV series shows off his insanely large brood and a barely teenaged wife. The 'Late' Lord Frey is presented as an untrustworthy, dirty old man who somehow staved off erectile dysfunction. When he asks why he should care about the problems of Stark, Lannister and Baratheon, we're meant to think that he only cares about getting his rocks off with the latest young thing from the kitchens.
Then two seasons later he masterminds a massacre.
In the interim, there are a lot of hints dropped about Frey's chessmaster abilities, and it's really very simple. There are several mentions of Jaime Lannister fighting in tournaments at weddings (or maybe only one very awesome wedding). The wedding is heavily implied to be a Frey-Lannister wedding. By the time Brynden the Blackfish Tully offhandedly mentions that Roose Bolton married a Frey girl, it seems like a running gag and not a harbinger of betrayal. Frey won because he had the excess children to marry into the right family, and the Stark's didn't. Lord Bolton picked the fattest Frey not just to maximize her 'weight in silver' dowry, but because the ideal Westeros marriage is business, not personal.

George RR Martin has stated that he wrote the Red Wedding to subvert fantasy genre conventions. Among those conventions is the idea that true love wins. Marriage based on love is a relatively recent invention in human history, and events in Westeros show why.  Renly lasts as long as he does by marrying into the rich Tyrell family. Stannis's wife isn't mentioned as having connections, and he hasn't fared well. Lord Frey's revenge is enabled by his in-laws. He might be the best chessmaster in the whole damn series.
The loving, honorable Starks of Winterfell were introduced as traditional heroes. In a series that deconstructs traditional tropes, that's a bad thing. Early in the first season, Ned Stark tells Jon Snow that Starks have served in the Night's Watch for thousands of years. God knows how many able, young, fertile Stark men were wasted freezing North of the Wall instead of making generations of little Lords with southern Ladies.  The tragedies in 'A Song of Ice and Fire' are all about Stark honor: marrying the girl you love instead of the girl you're promised to; playing the game by the rules instead of cutthroat; serving the realm at the Wall instead of your House in a marriage; and climbing the towers when your mother told you not to.

Scratch all that. It really is all Bran's fault.",73,200,False,self,,,,,

Just gonna start with the first book again now and read right into ADWD with enough time before TWOW to look into theories.** 
Just finished AFFC and I am freaking out that I have so long to go until TWOW is getting released and have only one book left. I started reading AGOT at the beginning of this summer and have just completely ignored my friends and binge-read the first four books. I don't want to just run through the 5th book like the last 4, because I'm not even sure it will close some ends left at the end of AFFC! I also know I'll probably have to wait until December 2015 for the 6th book.([APPARENTLY NOT TRUE](http://www.hypable.com/2012/10/10/game-of-thrones-george-r-r-martin-winds-of-winter-a-dream-of-spring/)) . So in a fit of sadness following Brienne's last chapter in AFFC, I set up a long term rereading schedule. How have you all gone about doing this?

I added up the page count of the books I've read.

AGOT: 807 pgs.
ACOK: 728 pgs.
ASOS: 1128 pgs.
AFFC: 976 pgs.

3,639 pages Total (52 Pages a week until 12/22/2014, my birthday)

I'm gonna start ADWD on my 22nd birthday in 2014 which will mean reading 52 pages a week from the predecessors starting this week.

ADWD: 959 pgs.

I'll be reading ADWD 25 pages a week which will have me ending at this date in 2015. That will give me the fall and the start of winter to process what I read and then will hopefully get TWOW on my birthday in 2015.

Without making a clear ""Lannisters are manipulative assholes""-type statement, I did think it was interesting to look at the principles of agency we ascribe to ourselves and how that translates to which families we enjoy following the most in the Westeros conflicts.  I'm no Freudian (and I know his theories are outdated), but I can't help but draw the parallel with Freud's theory of the id, the ego, and the super-ego - and since this is fiction and not real people, I figure it could apply as a way to understand what draws us to each family.

The Greyjoy mentality seems to be very much one of immediate gratification.  Balon Greyjoy wants to be king, so he claims himself king.  Theon wants to proove himself to his father, so he rashly takes Winterfell.  The Greyjoy motto is ""We do not sow"" and they're fond of paying ""the iron price"" - they want something, they take it immediately and by force.  This direct, I-want-so-I-act mentality resonates with some people.  This, in many ways, is the ""id"".

The Lannisters, meanwhile, still act very much as a function of what they want, but are much more tempered by the reality of their situation and are willing to play the long game, including deceit, manipulation, and use of leverage, to maximise their position, delaying immediate gratification if it means maximum gain for themselves later.  This intelligent approach to ambition also resonates with many people, and I feel best exemplifies the idea of the ego.

Finally, the Starks are the image of denial of their own wants in order to best serve their society.  Ned does not want to be Hand, but accepts because he understands his friend and the realm need him.  Benjen and Jon volunteered for the Night's Watch because of a sense of duty to protect others.  Even Robb only accepted the title of King of the North when he was acclaimed by others, as a means to assure his bannermen would not have to suffer King Joffrey.  Granted, he also wanted to avenge his father, but even that is a matter of doing what's right (by his cultural standards) rather than what he actually wants.  This attitude of duty and self-sacrifice for as a function of your society's needs also resonates strongest with some (most people, arguably), and is most demonstrative of the super-ego.

I know there are other families, but in many ways I feel they're mostly variations of the three families I've described.  The Boltons, for instance, split their motivations between Ego (Roose) and Id (Ramsay), and so are thematically placed between the Lannisters (Roose/Tywin and Jaime) and the Greyjoys (Ramsay/Theon).  The Tyrells are also similarly split along Ego (Margery, Olenna) and Super-Ego (Loras), and so their main involvements are with Lannisters (Margery/Joffrey, Olenna/Tywin) and Starks (Loras/Sansa).

Thoughts?

Martin drew on to design the various groups and people of ASOIAF.  Any suggestions would be much appreciated.  I will note that my comparisons in this post are made only with the knowledge from the first three seasons of the show and the first two books.

I have a theory for the land of Westeros.  The popularly assumed idea that the land is modeled after Great Britain.  However, I believe that   Therefore many of the factions will have their history drawn from this area.  

Stark - I can see the house of Stark as a representation of Scotland.  The Starks are descendants of the First Men and were subjugated by the Andals.  The Scottish were subjugated by the English.  This happened until William Wallace, a nobleman, decided to start a rebellion.  This rebellion was short lived and ended in his execution.  Wallace's successor however, Sir Robert the Bruce began a long war against the English before dying of leprosy later in life.  While Wallace and Bruce don't perfectly fit to Eddard and Robb, there are several similarities that tie in well.

The Southern Kingdoms - The Southern Kingdoms constant battle for their family's control of the throne reminded me of the War of the Roses.  This was a battle between the houses of Lancaster and York for the throne of England.  Lancaster even sounds like Lannister.  Lancaster's rose was the Red Rose.  York was the White rose and doesn't fit very well with any one of the single other houses.  The intricacies of House York and their connection to the other houses of the Southern Kingdom could be a post in and of itself so suffice it to say York is an amalgamation.

Nights Watch &amp; Free Men - Although these lands are connected to Westeros in ASOIAF I believe this component is representative of Ireland.  The Night's Watch is the Protestant Northerners and the Free Men are the Catholic Southerners.  The wall could be representative of the border.

Greyjoy  Any explanation for the House of Greyjoy escapes me in this theory of mine.  The Greyjoys are a naval power who only loosely follow a monarchy.  Their people are given a lot of freedom and they have a Riddick-esque philosophy of you keep what you kill.  They were also put down in a rebellion against the Starks.

This is taking a lot longer to type up then I had originally thought.  If this post garners any attention Ill add more details but a couple comparisons to be added next time are...
Dothraki = Huns
Unsullied = Spartans
Narrow Sea = English Channel
Qarth  = large trading city in Netherlands or could be Istanbul.
IF YOU TOOK THE TIME TO READ ALL OF THIS, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR PAYING ATTENTION TO THE RAMBLINGS OF MY BRAIN.

I just finished ASOS and I enjoyed the crap out of it and I only had two questions:

1. Did Tyrion actually do it? After he admits it, he internally says something like ""I wanted to scream, 'No Jamie, I didn't'"" but then he remembers Tysha and how bad Jamie hurt him. Also, the way Petyr describes the death of Joffery and the way Sansa is afraid of the hair piece left me confused. If there's more about Joffery's death in later books, please don't spoil it. 

2. Why did the brotherhood bring Catelyn back through R'hllor? I thought that they served King Robert?

I noticed in the last week there have suddenly been a lot more posts without the scope, so I wanted to make a more obvious reminder about it.  Titles can't be edited, so if you don't add one, it just means a mod will remove your post and you'll have to make a re-post.  Please save everyone the trouble and put in a good scope in the first place.

Seeing how much Varys has planned in ADWD, he basically planned all of the invasion of Westeros by the Targaryens and the alliances with the Martells..

I believe there is more to Shae being in Tywins bedroom, I believe Varys got her there to damage the reputation of Tywin, especially since he had plans for Tyrion as well.

What do you guys think?

The reasons for doing this are sketchy though. They could be rewarded with coin or holdings but that almost seems to bland a reason for them. 

Little finger has stated to Sansa that he intends to put her in command of the north and the vale.  If this is the case the river lands would likely rebel once again and join her should she go to war with the Iron Throne.  Alone though, and even with the help of Dorne the war would be far from won. Plus, who gets so sit the Iron throne after?

What I find interesting is that Little Finger seems to have similar motives to Verrys. He is never likely so sit the iron throne, but could get land or coin out of putting someone in power. Once again, too bland, and who? 

I think the answer to the first question is Dany.  He put Cersei in power knowing she would muck everything up, and now plans to launch an offensive from the north as Dany attacks up through Dorne.  Together the Iron throne would fall and order would once again be restored in the 7 Kingdoms. 

The answer to why he would want to do that though is still in the air.  I don't think it has to do with gold or land.  Do they know about the white walkers and just want unite the 7 Kingdoms so they can live? Do they have a sons of liberty thing going where they really just want the best for the realm? Do they think business might be better in a time of peace? We are also faced with the question of if they are working together, or just with similar motives. 

What do you guys think?

I noticed that the first book have a fascination with albinos of all kinds. To a point I start to wonder if it have a deeper meaning.

The 0 albinos: The Others they are described as milk-white pale skin and blue eyes deeper and bluer than humans.

The first Albino in the book is ghost, find by luck with red eyes.

The second albino is the weirwood tree on winterfell. Making two consecutive chapter introducing an albino or three if you count the prologue. They have red eyes.

The third albino is the ghost grass. White grass as high as a man on a horse that was consuming the Dothraki sea. The Dothraki believe that the end of the world will be when ghost grass cover the green sea. No eyes

The fourth  albinos is Hodor, brown eyes.

The fifth albino is the wight with blue eyes. Ghost (albino with red eyes) found it on the weirwood fored (albinos with red eyes). At this point was the first time Jon realized how similar is Ghost to the weirwoods.

I don't know if there are more albinos out there or if i missed one on the first book but reading the wiki I found more albinos

It is also home of some very versatile acting.

However, with some bravura performances, comes some pretty monotonous work too. TV is very kind to bad actors.

I'll start off with an unpopular choice:

Emilia Clarke- Although she has a pretty face (and a huge fan base), that in no way compensates her complete inability to capture Daenerys' character. She is emotionless eg. look at her eyes whenever she acts, and makes Dothraki sound like some sort of bastard Arabic (although her High Valyrian is alright). Also her entire saga seems like a distraction to the 'main' plot in Westeros, while in the books, she is just as important. She is by far the worst actor on the show. That being said, I do not think she is inherently untalented. She just cannot emulate Daenerys' personality.

Sibel Kekilli- I don't even know how she landed the role of Shae. Last part she played was in a Tukish porno (i am not making this up; don't look it up it sucks). Apparently, the producers were intrigued by her 'accent'. I really don't know where they were going with that. She seems very monotone and out of it, especially in contrast to Peter Dinklage.

Lena Headey- I actually kind of liked her at first. The quiet and solemn queen who seemed like she always had the upper hand. And her expressions were great and her character got under my skin. Up until mid-2nd season. I don't know what happened; she needs to realize just saying things quietly, making an irksome voice, turning her head and just playing a bitch does not qualify for Cersei's very intricate character.

I am open to counterarguments and disagreements. Please rebuff my claims. Also, add more actors and characters that did not meet your expectations or cannot mirror the book-version.

I am perfectly aware that all these actresses are female. I really could not think of horrendous male actors on the show.

I've recently been trawling my way through the GoT and the whole Bran/Children of the Forest story line has really interested me.

So I've been doing a bit of research on Coldhands, and I came up to a few interesting lines..

As a preface, I personally believe that he must be a member of the nights watch as most people seem to share.

[ADWD](#b """"They killed him long ago"" said by Leaf"") makes me believe that Coldhands cannot be Benjen Stark, as the Children of the Forrest live for so long, [ADWD](#b ""a long time ago"") must be longer than the two years ago when Benjen went missing/died.

I think it was Brandon Stark the thirteenth Commander of the Nights Watch. A.K.A The Nights King

Now when I did some reading into Old Nans tales , the thirteenth commander of the Nights Watch was erased from history because of his relationship with a woman who is described to be one of the Others ""her skin was as cold as ice"". She also alludes to the fact that he was a Stark and shared the same name as Bran.

That would one solve the problem of Coldhands being reanimated (due to his relationship with one of the others) as well as Coldhands being dead for some time, as Brandon Stark was alive during the Age of Heroes.

But also when Coldhands responds to Bran's question about his history, he replied with [ADWD](#b ""Your monster, Brandon Stark"")

Now what happens when instead of stating that he the monster of the living Brandon Stark, he is instead stating the name of the living Brandon Stark's monster is Brandon Stark?

So the quote ""I'm your monster, Brandon Stark"" is just a double entendre on the fact that ColdHands name is actually Brandon Stark, the Nights King.

This could also explain why he could not travel under the wall, but had knowledge of the black gate. He was alive during the Age of Heroes and a commander of the Nights Watch, privy to information about the Black Gate, something that a first ranger might not know.

And not being able to travel under the wall might be due to the fact that he is infact a turncloak and cursed by the Nights Watch.

Those are my two cents, flame away

In [this map](http://barbariana.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Map1-5_The_Land_Beyond_The_Wall_AGOT.jpg) we can see the wall ends in the shore at the east, but in the west it ends in a river. I'm about 1/4 in ACoK and I've not seen the TV show, and in ACoK [ACoK minor spoilers](#b ""they say the wildling are getting across the wall by going around in little boats by the Bay os Seals"")

 I think they are also [AGoT spoilers](#b ""getting across the wall in the west, because if I remember correctly Osha and her group said they went across the mountains."")
 
 The Wall ends in a river in the west. There's a village there, The Gorge, and it seems to be beyond the Wall. The river is narrow enough for the wildlig to cross in boats, safer than going around by the Bay of Seals. And the river only ends when Brandon's Gift ends, the gift is said to be 25 leagues.
 
   Shouldn't the Wall be where Brandon's Gift is? If there is a explantion later in the books tell me and mark spoilers if you're going to explain please. I'm very happy I started with the books first, eerybody was telling me to see the series but I bought the books. ",23,20,False,default,,,,,

We're pleased to finally be rolling out with those changes. 

-All Hodor posts that aren't extraordinary (mod's discretion) belong in /r/hodor. No more dumbass replies of Hodor. Got it?

-No more posts with normal image macroes with characters overlaid (i.e. Overly Attached Ygritte). Send that shit to /r/asongofmemesandrage

- Repost rule change: We're going to change the limit based on what time of the season it is. Guidelines in the handy-dandy chart below:


----
* April-June = 1-week limit
* July-August = 2-week limit
* September-January = 1-month limit
* February-March = 2-week limit

----
* 5 months of the year would have a 1-month limit
* 4 months would keep the current 2-week limit
* 3 months during the peak season time drops to 1-week

----

-No more weak relevance posts- this includes a simple pun or play on words that uses GOT as a meme without actually having to do with GOT itself. God, these mods really are hitler.

-No more Tumblr-style animations. These short, shitty gifs should be posted as image stills or videos. Regular upvote .gifs and shit like that? Love 'em, keep 'em coming. What we mean is those series of .gifs uploaded either directly from tumblr or as an album on imgur. If it requires more than one .gif to get your point across, post a video. Sorry for your karma loss, I grieve for you.

-We **WILL NOT** be rolling out the proposed change to the spoiler tag, i.e. that the [All Spoilers] tag will include speculation and theories. You will still need to use the [All Spoilers/Theory] tag. Unless you want your post removed. We can do that too. 

-We've also decided to not place a ban on memes with GoT source material. I think this is stupid. But we're not Hitler, and a large majority of you want these. 

So if you've been keeping track, that's all the votes except one. I saved this one for last, because I take *extreme pleasure* in announcing the banning of all photos of y'all meeting with the actors. Extraordinary photos (like the one with Locke's character from a few weeks ago) are good, but don't bother if it's just your ugly mug next to an actor. Congrats, you met Tywin of House Lannister,  Lord of Casterly Rock, Shield of Lannisport and Warden of the West. You don't need to broadcast it to everyone, though. And god, these comment threads always become cesspits of moderation.  If you meet them on the set and get a picture of them in costume, great. But if you waited in line and got a staged picture with a bunch of other doofuses (doofi?), share it on facebook. 

Seig Heil

Book readers are welcome too! After watching Season 3 and discussing a lot of with my friend who has read all the books, he convinced me to read the books too. Best decision I've made in a long time. I finished ASOS recently and am in the middle of AFFC and I'm loving it. It's also great to see how everything is interpretted from the books to the show and how the writers are gonna do things.

Anyways, to my answer my own question I'll start off and say STANNIS BARATHEON.

There's a few logical reasons why I support Stannis, but other than that I have no idea why I first started liking Stannis, but I just did. On to the points. 

I'll go ahead and say that I'd like to kind of use this to help show-watchers understand Stannis a lot more and see if I can change how he is perceived because my main peeve with this show is how they portray Stannis.

1. He is, without a doubt the righful, lawful, and true heir to the Iron Throne. Dany is not. She has a claim, but not the strongest claim. Her father was deposed and her family branded as traitors of the realm. The Baratheons are now the reigning family and there blood takes precedent over the Targaryen one. Lawfully, Robert told Ned to name Joffrey as his successor, but Ned (in his honor) changed the wording to rightful heir. Legally, Stannis is actually the heir and Ned paid for this honorable deed with his life. 

2. Stannis is the most righteous or one of the most righteous of the kings who are/have tried to rule. GRRM even says it, although I cannot provide a source. Varys mentions that there is nothing more frightening than a truly just man and that is Stannis Baratheon. He is a man that does justice. He would possibly end the game of thrones and is a threat to every noble that plays it. That is why Stannis was the biggest threat at the beginning of the War of Five Kings. 

Some would say killing Renly was not just, but in war they would've thought and killed one or the other and good men would die over a petty sibling dispute. Whether you liked Renly or not, his claim was purely by conquest and was thus a traitor in Stannis' eyes. It's not like Stannis killed Renly without a second thought. He straight up offered Renly to be in his small council and become Stannis' heir if he joined with him, instead Renly made immature jokes and insults at Stannis.

An example of Stannis' justice is Davos Seaworth. Davos saved Stannis' life, which will be mentioned in detail earlier, but was still a smuggler and smuggling was a crime and immoral. Stannis did not play any favoritism or gave in on his principles. He cut off Davos' fingers for his crime of smuggling, and Davos is his most loyal follower and supporter to this day. Davos is incredibly honorable, and it means a lot that he would support Stannis. It speaks about how much of a person and King he sees in Stannis that wins Davos over for him.

3. Stannis isn't claiming the throne for his ambition or for any greed or anything else. He's doing it because it is his DUTY. He feels obligated because he is the true and rightful heir. Something that Ned Stark died for to prove. 

4. Stannis is or one of the best military commanders of Westeros at this moment. A bit of history for any show-watchers that don't know: When Robert's Rebellion began, Stannis was tasked with holding Storm's End while Robert was away. In the meanwhile, Mace Tyrell led a huge host of troops to Storm's End to siege the castle. The siege lasted 1 year and Stannis stood strong and starved with his men. If not for Davos then Stannis would've died of starvation. 

Later, during the Greyjoy Rebellion, Stannis was tasked with defeating the Greyjoy fleet. Now, let's not forget that the Iron Islands are known for their ships and sailors. Defeating the Iron Fleet led by none other than Victarion Greyjoy at Fair Isle is an incredible accomplishment.

Next, Blackwater Bay, where Stannis personally led the beach assault at the front of the lines with no helmet on charging forth with his troops in equal if not greater peril than the rest. To add even more badass info, he was the first man to climb the ladder and fight on the walls and only left because his men forced him to. He is not one to sit back and watch as his troops die for him, he'll suffer their pain and the despair of war leading them headfirst. Not even Robb can claim to be at the very front of the army.

5. Stannis has to put up with SO MUCH SHIT his ENTIRE LIFE. More explanation for show-watchers. You thought Dany's life was hard, Stannis' was full of insult after insult. At a young age (13), Stannis lost his parents and his faith in the Seven. He prayed all he could and his prayers were never answers. Growing up he was THE middle brother. Any of you middle children out there will understand what it meanst o be the middle child. 

At the end of Robert's Rebellion, for his rewards in holding Storm's End and almost starving to death, Stannis received Dragonstone, while Renly received the whole Stormlands. Now, how would you feel if you almost died trying to hold land against a huge enemy force to only see your little brother still young and not of age receive the land instead of you? Add insult to injury and all you get is this island with no real vassals or prestige. Thanks Robert! Oh wait, Stannis wasn't even thanked for saving Storm's End, Ned was.

Then, he takes on the Greyjoy fleet and defeats it and is commanded to take Great Wyk while Robert and Ned get all the glory of storming Pyke. You can see a trend here, and why Stannis only respects Ned for his honor and nothing else. 

You thought life was done with Stannis? Not yet. His wife Selyse is pretty much a lunatic and his only daughter and child, Shireen is plagued with greyscale. Stannis has a pretty damn good reason for not loving his brothers or Ned. They never loved or respected him anyways.

6. Stannis is honest and blunt with a bit of dry humor thrown in. Idk about the books, but in the show Shireen asked him, ""Did you win?"" Stannis replied honestly and said, ""No."" Back track and see that Stannis also admitted to his wife about his infidelity and it was not a casual thing for him to admit either. There a few witty lines in the book that Stannis says, but I can't find them at this moment. Another example: in the letter to the Lords of Westeros, he properly refers and corrects his scribe that Jamie Lannister should be changed to Ser Jaime Lannister because that he acknowledges Jaime as a knight and not as just an enemy.

7. Show-watchers, I'd like to point out that Stannis is NOT Melisandre's bitch in the books. He questions everything she does and always heavily weighs the decisions he makes. In the books, Edric Storm (the only acknowledged bastard of Robert) took the place of Gendry in the show about the leeches and the sacrifice. Stannis doesn't make the decision easily and heavily questions the Red Woman about it.

8. Melisandre, though she may appear to have evil goals or ideas, is not inherently evil. She is doing what the Lord of Light shows her in the fire and truly wants Stannis to become King seeing him as the Messiah of R'hllor meant to defeat The Great Other. There is always a justifiable reason.

9. At the end of season 3 we see Melisandre urging Stannis to answer the Night's Watch's call to go to the Wall to defeat the coming Wildlings and White Walkers. Has Joffrey? No. In the books, Stannis gives an awesome quote about the decision and how it changed his attitude and mindset. 

10. Stannis has flaws, just like every other character, but he really can be a good King especially the state Westeros is in. In Season 4, show-watchers may or may not start to like Stannis more if I haven't convinced you. That's if the writers do it correctly. They really don't like Stannis if you can tell. A bit of their bias seeps into the show at times. They hype up Dany or Robb and make Stannis out to be some sort of subservient dog. It's main pet peeve.

Anyways, that's my chosen King. I'd love to hear some counters to my points and any other people you support for the Throne. Cheers! 

EDIT: Some corrections. Thank you hyperomega

&gt;**TYRION II**

&gt;Tyrion is with the Second Sons and Jorah, readying for battle. Brown Ben has gone to see the girl general. However, the Second Sons are still on the side of the Yunkai. There are great laments that they are fighting for the wrong side. There is fighting in Slavers Bay and under the Wall. The fight will be upon their position soon.

&gt;Tyrion watches the sun rise over the battlefield. One of the dragons (he cant tell which) eats soldiers being flung into the air by one of six things called the Wicked Sisters (apparently some kind of embattlement). Why do the gods keep putting him into battle? thinks Tyrion, since hes not made for it. His thoughts turn first to Shae, then to his first battle at the Green Fork. He remembers the Green Fork better than Blackwater. And the Second Sons saddling up remind him of Bron.

&gt;He is not yet in armor, so he returns to his tent. Penny is there, dressed in real armor for her defense. As she helps Tyrion suit up, they talk. When he mentions Cersei, Penny says, You would sell your sister for a cup of horse piss. Tyrion has to laugh: Is my taste for horse piss so famous or have you met my sister? He then explains his thoughts on strategy for the upcoming battle  a great plan to be heard and followed by no one. And as he remembers his father remaining above the fighting at the Green Fork, Penny kisses him.

&gt;Tyrion is enraged. He rants at her about the slaughter of the battlefield and the reality about to invade her innocent world. Penny apologizes, saying shes frightened. But this echo of Shae makes matters worse. He leaves to see the battle. It is Viserion chowing down on flying soldiers. Rheagal is in sight, however. The camp is in a panic.

&gt;A man in golden armor rides up from the Supreme Commander Gorzak (ph). No one in the camp knows who Gorzak is. This man is his emissary and commands them to move to the bay and attack the savages from the squid ships. Tyrion, as a Lannister, is well aware of the Ironborn depredations and is not inclined to follow the command. The Second Sons agree: they are cavalry and cant walk on water. They decide to wait for Brown Ben to return. The emissary, assuring them of the wrath of Gorzak, departs. Tyrion and Jorah agree  they are fighting for the wrong side.

&gt;Viserion withdraws from the skies. Rhaegal still flies, however.

&gt;Brown Ben returns. Melessa (ph) wants them to defend a Wicked Sister. Tyrion crudely points out that the girl has nicer breasts. And at that point, a Yunkai nobleman rides up. Tyrion approves of the depraved scene depicted on his armor, but his news is less welcome. The nobleman swears vengeance on the Prince of Tatters and Tyrion mocks him. Brown Ben defends Tyrion from the nobleman until Jorah runs the Yunkai nobleman through.

&gt;And Brown Ben proclaims that they have been Queens Men all along! Joining the Yunkai was merely a clever ploy. Tyrion isnt fooled by this, but is happy with the development.
