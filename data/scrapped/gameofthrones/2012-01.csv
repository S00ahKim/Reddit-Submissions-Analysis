In fact, now that I think about it, even if Varys had no part in Daenerys' marriage, why would he still advise to kill her?  Isn't it starting to seem like Varys is a Targaryen loyalist?",9,6,False,default,,,,,

He knows Jon well enough to manipulate him with something like this, it would not be the first time he fooled him (the horn of Joramun actually being a fake).

Is sending the military strength at Castle Black just so that Bolton can be taken down and Stannis declared victorious or does Mance want to get back to the wall while its forces are elsewhere?

Is it some kind of ploy? I think Tormund would object to Mance rallying the wildlings again, there will probably be some kind of fight. I'm wondering what their role is going to be as the story goes on and winter really bites Westeros.

Another facet to this, I'm convinced Mance is responsible for the Others returning. Searching for the horn of Joramun caused 'hundreds of shades' to be released into the world according to Ygritte. So whether or not their return was prophesied, Mance might have ended up being the cause -- and that's why he's so bitter about the subject when Jon mentioned it to him.",10,3,False,self,,,,,

I didn't exactly understand what Jamie told him about the whole first wife thing. 

So if I have it right, they hadn't hired a whore, but rather just paid an ordinary woman to leave him? It's a bit worse, I guess, but still nothing to get so angry about. Well, that's just my opinion as a cold observer.

Amazing description of war for the common man (AFoC Spoilers)",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/o3njt/is_a_broken_man_an_outlaw_amazing_description_of/,JoeyS7,1325745181,"I just finished reading a chapter from Brienne's point of view.  It is when she, Hyle Hunt, Podrick, and Septa Meribald are on their journey to the Saltpans to search for the Hound.  The Septa says that some villagers told him of broken men stalking the roads, and that the small party should keep watch tonight, but not hurt them.  Instead, give them food and shelter.

Of course, Hyle Hunt sees this as too trusting, saying that the men will probably slit their throats while they sleep.

It leads to this, which I just had to post. 

&gt;""Ser? My lady?"" said Podrick. ""Is a broken man an outlaw?""

&gt;""More or less,"" Brienne answered.

&gt;Septon Maribald disagreed. ""More less than more.  There are many sorts of outlaws, just as there are many sorts of birds. A sand piper and a sea eagle both have wings, but they are not the same.  The singers love to sing of good men forced to go outside the law to fight some wicked lord, but most outlaws are more like this ravening Hound than they are the lightning lord.  They are evil men, driven by greed, sourced by malice, despising the gods and caring only for themselves.  Broken men are more deserving of our pity, though they may be just as dangerous.  Almost all are common born, simple folk who had never been more than a mile from the house they were born until the day some lord came around to take them off to war.  Poorly shod and poorly clad, they march away beneath his banners, ofttimes with no better arms than a sickle or sharpened hoe, or a maul they made themselves by lashing a stone to a stick with stripes of hide.  Brothers march with brothers, fathers with sons, friends with friends.  They've heard the songs and stories, and go off with eager hearts, dreaming of the wonders they will see, of the glory and wealth they will win. War seems a fine adventure, greater than the most of them will ever know. 

&gt;""Then they get a taste of battle.

&gt;For some, that one taste is enough to break them.  Others may go on for years, until they lose count of all the battles they have fought in, but even a man who has survived a hundred fights can break on his hundred and first. Brothers watch brothers die, fathers lose their sons, and friends see their friends trying to hold their entrails in after being gutted by an axe. 

&gt;""They see the lord that led them there cut down, and some other lord shouts that they are his now.  They take a wound, and when it is still half healed they take another. There is never enough to eat, their shoes fall to pieces from the marching, their clothes are torn and rotting, and half of them are shitting in their breeches from drinking bad water. 

&gt;""If they want new boots or a warmer cloak or maybe a rusted iron half helm, they need to take them from a corpse, and before long they are stealing from the living too, from the smallfolk whose lands they're fighting in, men very like the men they used to be. They slaughter their sheep and steal their chickens, and from there it's just a short step to carrying off their daughters too.  And one day they look around and realize all their friends and kin are gone, that they are fighting beside strangers beneath a banner that they hardly recognize.  **They don't know where they are or how to get back home and the lord they're fighting for does not know their names, yet here he comes, shouting for them to form up, to make a line with their spears and scythes and sharpened hoes, to stand their ground.  And the knights come down on them, faceless men clad all in steel, and the iron thunder of their charge seems to fill the world...**

&gt;**And the man breaks.**

&gt;He turns and runs, or crawls off afterward over the corpses of the slain, or steals away in the black of night, and he finds someplace to hide.  All thought of home is gone by then, and kings and lords and gods mean less to him than a haunch of spoiled meat that will let him live another day, or a skin of bad wine that might drown his fear for a few hours.  the broken man lives from day to day, meal to meal, more beast than man.  Lady Brienne is not wrong.  In times like these, the traveler must beware of broken men, and fear them... but he should pity them as well.""

Sorry if it's really long, it's about two pages worth, but wow.  I feel like it's a powerful description of how awful war is for the common man, even the huge ones of the last century, like WWI and WWII and the Viet Nam war and etc.  Really powerful stuff. ",8,26,False,self,,,,,

The bit we found odd was that there doesn't seem to be any way to un-rout a unit, it is simply stuck like that for the entire game. With that in mind, what then is the point in the castle symbol house card abilitys? If a unit that loses a battle is permanently useless, why would it not be better to just let them die and not take up supplys anymore?

Assuming that the planet on which Westeros is located is nearly analogous to Earth (atmosphere, climate, seasons, etc), how can a winter or summer last for multiple years? For that matter, even if Westeros' planet does not conform to the seasonal cycles of Earth, which seems obvious, how can it be that it has an erratic orbit and/or rotation cycle so as to cause seasons with different lengths?

I suggest two possibilities: First, ""winter"" doesn't specifically refer to the season but is a metaphorical time of struggle and difficulties; though that would make Old Nan's tales even more embellished, ""snows a hundred feet high"" indeed. This would also make the Stark words more of a ""trouble lies ahead"" statement. Second, it might just be one of those parts of the story that isn't meant to be over analyzed.

In addition, let's talk about it in the comments.

Let me start off with a brief description of the game. GoT is a strategy game ala Risk, with a ""no one is safe"" feeling, much like in the books. The object of the game is to control castles on the map with automatic victory being obtained after 7 castles are under your control. There are no dice in this game. Battles are determined by the number of men in combat and the randomness of battles is determined by which House Card you use. House Cards represent the presence of a character from the books. These cards include such characters as Eddard Stark, Jamie Lannister, Theon Greyjoy and many others. Each house card has varying strengths, and most importantly, can't be used until all of the other House cards have been used. I think this adds more strategic decisions while creating a mystery element to combat.

Most of the action is determined by ""orders"". These include Raid (destroy an enemy order), March (which will start combat if you move into an enemy territory), Defend (bonus to combat when defending), Consolidate Power (gain power tokens and muster armies), and my favorite Support (assist any combat in adjacent squares). Support orders are my favorite because they are the best way to backstab someone. For example, say Lannister and Tyrell have an alliance against Baratheon. Lannister is about to attack Baratheon's men in the Kingswood and Tyrell, as part of his verbal agreement with Lannister, places a support order on his adjacent territory. When combat is joined between Lannister and Baratheon, Tyrell can actually use his Support to help either player: Tyrell can add his combat strength to Baratheon's or Lannister's side. I look forward to using this to become an annoying dick next game.

Other aspects of gameplay include the Westeros Phase and the Influence Tracks. The Westeros Phase represents conditions outside of the players control such as Wildling raids (which players bid on supporting the Night's Watch the most), political strife, etc. The Influence Tracks rank the Houses on their position as Military leaders, Iron Throne hopefuls, and players in the King's Court. The highest ranked House on each track gets special bonuses. For instance if a combat has a tie, the House that is higher on the Fiefdom (Military) Track wins.

Now I can't go into full detail on the rules but you can read them here: [GoT Rules PDF](http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/agot-bg-2nd-ed/support/VA65_AGoT2_Rulebook_web.pdf). 

Now let me now talk about how the game went.

While the initial learning phase is difficult, once we got into the swing of things I could tell that this would be one of my favorite board games. I played with 4 experienced gamers, 1 disinterested woman, and another interested woman. 

Explaining the rules was difficult; I was the only one who had read the rules before we started. Some players had problems distinguishing the different types of game pieces. This may have been due to my poor explanations, but the different game piece types could be more unique. Every piece has a House's banner on them, which creates confusion on how the pieces are different.

After a lengthy start-up period we began to play. The first round is short and slow which I think is a good game design decision. This prevents players from stealing an advantage in the first turn. Most of us collected nearby castles and defended.

By the end of turn 2 both of the women stopped playing and we used their pieces as stationary neutral armies. As Stark I used my isolated position to consolidate my strength and then attack Lannister's gains in the Riverlands. However, Lannister used a defend order when I attacked and was able to win the combat with his tie breaker (he was higher on the Fiefdom Track). As my forces were retreating Baratheon set sail from Dragonstone and assaulted Martell on Storm's End. Martell was forced to retreat but lost his navy, which was cornered in the port.

During the Westeros Phase of turn 3, a card was drawn that had everyone bid on positions on the Influence Track. Baratheon, who had accidentally collected numerous power tokens, took control of the Iron Throne and Fiefdom (Military) Influence Tracks. This spelt the doom of the rest of us. Two turns later we stopped the game as it was getting late. Greyjoy and Baratheon both had 5 castles, however due to Baratheon's higher position on the Iron Throne Track he broke the tie in his favor (EDIT: We played this incorrectly.).

My first game wasn't the best: I messed up on explaining the reveal of orders, and forgot that we could muster men more frequently than I thought. However, I think everyone saw the potential in the game. I'm hoping to play again on Saturday and play it all the way through.

Has anyone else played the game? What are your thoughts? I'm hoping to type up a battle report for next time. Also, any opinions on the Tides of Battle Supplemental Rules? 

TL;dr: GoT is a fun game, but hard to initially learn.",38,23,False,self,,,,,

There are some more changes coming up.  I'll be adding some buttons to the header for popular links, the sigil shields will be getting an update, and there will be some more options added to the House flair and custom wallpapers, including backgrounds for Kindles.  If you have any other suggestions for new features or design tweaks, please [message me with your thoughts](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kjhatch).

It plays off the personalities that you develop within your own family that you manage for better or worse during the game play session. This gameplay is ideally suited for the universe of ASOIAF (indeed the first crusader kings actually has a total conversion out). 

Since the release of crusader kings 2 is coming early next month I figured now is a good time to let the ASOIAF community know about what looks like a pretty cool project in development by the modding community of CK2.

(NO SPOILERS),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/ocbuf/affc_audiobook_discussion_roy_dotrice_slipping_no/,supertruck97,1326290207,"I am a few chapters in to the new AFFC Audiobook that came out in December. Having listened to the 1st 3 books of the series on audiobook, I had gotten used to Roy Dotrice as the narrator and was happy to see that they finally released a version with him narrating. However, I am noticing some things that seem a bit off with his narration from past books.

His pronunciation of some of the names has changed from previous versions, and even changes within a single chapter. For example, in the 1st 3 books Brienne's name was pronounced Bry-een. However, so far in this book he has pronounced it Bree-ihn. Similarly, Catelyn Stark was pronounced cat-ih-lin in previous books, and he now pronouncing it kay-ti-lin. Was this a directive from GRRM or is Dotrice simply slipping a bit.

Similarly, he actually changes name pronunciations within the same chapter. Specifically with Brienne, he pronounced it both the new way and the old way within the same chapter (though he only used the old pronunciation once or twice).

Also, he seems to have drastically changed his ""voices"" for some characters. As I mentioned, I'm only a few chapters in so far, but noticeably John Snow's voice has been drastically altered from previous books. Given that little to no time has passed between book 3 and book 4, one would assume that the voices should sound the same. Obviously, Dotrice has aged between the two book readings, but some others seem to have stayed the same (Sam).

Is this Roy Dotrice simply slipping a little as a narrator, or did GRRM ask him to do these things a bit differently? Not that it detracts from the quality of the book, but it takes my mind out of the story when characters do not sound like they have in the past, and names are pronounced completely differently than in the past. The strength of this series has been the investment in the characters, and the discontinuity in these small things takes some away from that strength IMHO.",2,2,False,self,,,,,

(Maybe I'm just dumb) It also works well because it's in a novel, you don't get to actually ""see"" the character so you don't ""see"" what the character looks like and quickly identify him.
What I'm wondering is how are they going to do that in the TV series? I guess you could throw a huge beard on the guy to disguise him but clever people will see in the credits that it's the same actor and they will probably guess that Arstan is Barristan Selmy in disguise. Personally, I think they are going to change the story a bit to establish earlier on that Arstan is Barristant Selmy or just ditch the Arstan character and call him Barristan Selmy from the start.

I also hear mention of a Now, I don't know if that's an exaggeration, and I still need to back-check to see if it's in the book, but civilization in Westeros seems to be very, very old. Much older, in fact, than ours, given that human civilization *started* roughly 12,000 years ago. We don't know much of anything about those days, but many Kings in Westeros seem to be able to trace their ancestry to the Age of Heroes, which lasted for 4000 years, and then you have the Andal migration and the Valyrian Age. All of this seems to occupy roughly *12,000* years of semi-recorded history. And this is *before* Aegon's Landing. 

On that note, Westeros is still in a Medieval-Renaissance-era world, at least visually. Were the Age of Heroes and the Valyrian Age roughly analogous to the Bronze Age, and the Roman Empire, or has this been the status quo for milennia, a la Star Wars? Furthermore, Is Westeros supposed to be fairly modern culturally, even if technologically speaking they aren't?

Who in your opinion is the most ruthless, toughest bad-ass in the ASOIAF series? Which character in particular would you want to avoid at all costs?  

Personally my vote goes for [Victarion Greyjoy](http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2011/203/0/0/victarion_greyjoy_by_mattolsonart-d41bsk1.jpg), for his vicious, twisted code of honour and relentlessly savage and brutal ""justice"". His chapters in ADWD especially portray him perfectly as one tough son of a bitch, and he's illustrated so powerfully by GRRM that one can't help but be awed at what he does. His POV's are my favourites.

Close contenders for me are [Ser Barristan Selmy](http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs46/f/2009/245/6/4/Ser_Barristan_Selmy_by_capprotti.jpg), [Gregor Clegane](http://th09.deviantart.net/fs10/300W/i/2006/160/e/0/Ser_Gregor_Clegane_by_serclegane.jpg) for obvious reasons, and [Oberyn Martell](http://www.theironthrone.it/it/images/stories/personaggi/oberyn-martell.gif) [A SoS Spoiler](/b ""I know we only see him for a short while but he left an impression of being someone not to mess with - I mean he beat the mountain in one-on-one battle and left him to die a protracted death in utter agony, pretty good going!"")

I'm hoping that will turn out to be like Thoros of Myr &amp; Beric Dondarrion; Lady Melisandre will use some sort of magic and raise him from the dead.  She saw it coming, hopefully she's able to undo it since she just warned Jon and didn't take any steps to stop it.

* I don't think Stannis is really dead either; like Jon said, there was truth in Ramsay's letter but I think there was equal parts deception as well.  If he really smashed the Baratheon force he would have found Jeyne and Theon.

* And one of the last things I want of Bran is for him to turn into a tree and live out his days in a cave north of the Wall.  He better come back to reclaim his birth right and rebuild Winterfell some how!  Was that supposed to be him in the skin of Mormont's raven when it said, ""Jon Snow""?

* But one big thing I can't seem to ponder out, what is going to be the big pay off with Arya?  What is all the assassin training leading to?

* Bran: Ned's 2nd youngest boy. Felt from tower, can't walk.
* Jon snow: Ned's bastard, Nightwatch.

Etc etc... The easier name are easy, but when they bring up the first name of some of as anexemple the Lannister kid (like the 2 kid at the breakfast table after Tyrion slapped Joefrey), I get tottaly lost and I am like, ""what? New character?"" When they aren't new at all, I just didn't remember their name.

It would happen when I red the Harry Potters, but I didn't care and just kept on reading, but as I said, now I worried of missing something if I don't keep track!

Let me know! Thanks.",19,13,False,self,,,,,

I started with A Game of Thrones and am currently on page 139 out of 807. 

The FAQ to the right states that, ""There are several layers of complexity, side plots, characters, flashbacks, and prophesies that had to be either simplified or left out of the series completely."" I'm just not seeing it. The only changes I've seen so far have been minute details or differences in setting. Every now and then you may get an inside into the thoughts of certain characters that you wouldn't have otherwise. In no way, however, am I seeing complex side plots that were left out of the show.

Later the FAQ also states that, ""watching season 1 of the show does not replace reading the first book. While the main plot of TV series is accurate to the novel, the books provide a much, much more detailed view of the world with additional story arcs and characters. Skipping ahead to book 2, Clash of Kings, will likely confuse people who have only seen the show due to the differences between the two mediums."" Once again I have yet to see these story arcs come to fruition. I asked a friend of mine who's read the released books twice and has of course seen season one. He assures me that this isn't the case. In his words the best reason to read book one was to just compare the mediums of reading vs. watching something and seeing what they both have to offer, since they are so closely related. As far as missing story elements or being confused in the second book he said it just wouldn't happen. 

The FAQ even seems to change its mind by the time it puts forward the question as to what's different by saying, ""Detailed readers will also notice many small changes in set and prop designs that make subtle changes but otherwise do not effect the main story.""

So be brutally honest with me, should I finish out the book and why? I know I'm only an 8th of the way, but at this point the only differences are the presence of the direwolves, the ages of many characters, a scarce amount of insight into certain characters not provided in the movies, and differences in setting here and there.",23,0,False,default,,,,,

* In ASOS Tyrion comes to the conclusion that Joffrey was the one that tried to get Bran killed while he was in a coma, my question is WHY? What could Joffrey possibly gain from having Bran dead? Was he just being his usual crazy little shit self or did Cersei plant the idea in his head?


* In AFFC did GRRM just fucking kill off Podrick Payne? and Brienne? That cruel heartless son of a bitch! I shall hence forth call him HopeSlayer.


* Why was Edmure Tully freaking out when Tom O Seven Strings started singing for him? (this is during the siege of Riverrun, Jaime brings Tom O Seven (even though Jaime doesn't know who he is) to sing to Edmure and Edmure freaks out, is it because Tom sang ""rains of castamere"" and Edmure had a RW flashback?


* DAE agree with me that Salma Hayek should play Taena Merryweather?


* What the hell is Qyburn doing in the dungeons? Is he experimenting on people? Trying to raise the dead like they've raised Dondarrion and Catelyn?


I'm going to start ADWD in a couple of days if some of these questions get answered in that book just let me know but without spoiling anything big :P

I actually really liked AFFC it's no ASOS but it's still pretty cool, it could get boring at times but over all I enjoyed it. I'm still kind of shocked that Brienne might be dead (poor Podrick) and if Arya really is blind and not just under some spell or something.

That last Cersei chapter, holy shit it was awesome! I think right now Littlefinger is winning the Game of Thrones. It seems like all his pieces are doing what they're supposed to be doing, he's just watching the game play in front of him with a devilish smirk on his face.",3,12,False,self,,,,,

So I had finished Tuf Voyaging and I thought a little weird thing, I can be the world of Game of Thrones be under the influences of the ecological engineering?

I know everybody have read GoT, but not sure about Tuf Voyaging, that is a science fiction novel by George R.R. Martin. Resuming we can say that the novel is about one guy that finds a very big starship with ecological engineering capabilities called the Ark. Then Tuf travels the galaxy offering his service to worlds with environmental problems.

First we have to think about the world, the world of Game of thrones is a little strange, the seasons are much larger than what we have on the Earth, so if we have to put the world we can imagine that will be an extraterrestrial world. 

Then we have some animals that it seems they have some kind of powers. This also can fit in the two realities, in Tuf Voyaging we can found cats with psionically powers, species with telepathic abilities and all of them can be created in the Ark. In the aSoIaF we have the direwolfs with some kind of power and the dragons. Can be these two created in the Ark?

Another interesting thing to have in mind is that westeros is a place of magic, but not the typical magic that you can see in Skyrim or LotR, more like some people or animals have powers, but can all these powers be explained with ecological engineering? It's hard to say because there is a lot of mystery to be solved, like how can some people kill in the distance.

Another thing that brings me to the idea of the merge of the worlds is that Tuf, at the end of the novel feels like a God. And can he prepare a world with some kind of animals and playing with the people like he do in ""Call him Moses""?

tl,dr: What I just want to say is that the two ""realities"" can fit together, or at least they have a lot in common.

Obviously going nuts and killing people seemed to be a Targaryen thing, how is it then, that no Magna Carta-like event has taken place, where the major houses force the king to use legal powers rather than summarily executing those that displease him? Why in all this time hasn't a parliamentary body formed that would curb the absolute authority of the kings?

I definitely don't think he's dead, or they would have surely found his body or some evidence of this by now. Or if he is dead, he's dead in the way that Catelyn is (ie: he straddles the line between alive and dead as a White Walker, which supports the Coldhands theory).

I know it's supposed to be like the book, but it got really annoying how they built up all these awesome characters and then just killed them all off.  Not just Ned, but King Robert, the sword teacher, Drogo, even Drogo's unborn child. Just when you start to like a character they kill them off. It just feels like cheap storytelling for shock value. I mean, what was the point of all of this building up Ned to be ultimately honorable, just to have him confess to treason he did not commit, and then have him killed anyway? What happened to honor being more important than living out his years in disgrace, like he gave that speech to little finger about? Then he goes an pisses his honor away by confessing, it just seemed so out of character, I would never thought he would do that to try and save his own life. He should have been defiant and told everyone how Joffrey was a bastard and the queen a incestuous whore, and then died with honor. Instead he died like a bitch, trying to save himself. Guess he wasn't that honorable after all. Which is dumb because up until that point he totally was. It didn't make sense. And how they kept building up Drogo's son to be this great conqueror, and had us geared up for Drogo himself to go conquering, and then they kill him and the baby off and then at the end are like, ""doesn't matter, Dragons!""  Fuck the dragons I want my character development to go somewhere! I'll still watch the show, mainly for the awesome fight sequences and visuals, but the last 2 episodes left me cold.

Right when this scene began my Pandora pulled up a super appropriate metal song that was just a perfect parallel with what was going on. When that chapter was done I threw my book down (this is in the middle of a cafe btw) and called up my friend and screamed ""SHIT JUST FUCKING GOT REAL"".

I'll just post a comment about my thoughts on his submission. To my surprise, the link didn't gain many votes at all, but was instead surpassed by a link to the same exact page by another user named ablebodiedmango. 

The only difference is that his link was appended with two extra characters, youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=rOzXsqoJhtE**#!** . These extra characters can be added to the end of any youtube link and still take the user to the original video, as they are not recognized. Youtube will only recognize the first 11 characters after the = sign. The downside to this is that the previously submitted content filter can be bypassed allowing one user to beat out another one solely based on titling or a thumbnail. Ablebodiedmango obviously recognized this flaw and used it to his advantage, which in my opinion, is a cheap shot towards another redditor.

Go ahead, try any one of these links and see if it doesn't take you to the exact same page.

Sure, sure, he has the chain gang in the cart--given what we know about them, those guys fall into the criminally sociopathic category--but the cadre of walkers/riders he has isn't exactly made up of nothing but petty thieves and poor dudes. It'd be entirely too easy for a convict to convince the rest of the crew to go mutiny and murder Yoren.

No matter how better armed or trained he is, he's still one man against twenty across a lifetime of trips north and south. Dude had to know his time was short.

I honestly can't at the moment recall if his monstrous testicles have been addressed in the books apart from mentioning the 'dangerous' criminals being caged for transport. I think that's bollocks; even a petty thief might turn murderer to avoid a life on the wall if it's a forced choice.

Love it, almost everything plays out how I had envisioned it in my head.  But they left out a couple of critical details.

First: Ghost.  Ghost is silent.  That's a big thing.  He's albino and mute and this plays into the plot more than once.

Second:  Where is Mormont's crow?  Where the hell is it?  The fact that he has a talking crow is a major plot point SoS, plus it's an awesome talking crow.  They just left it out entirely.  

Third:  The talk that [TV/COK spoiler] (/s ""Catelyn has with Jaime at the end of the season isn't supposed to happen until the end of Clash"")... what gives?

Other than that, I have loved it.  I just have been raging about these for a few months and I'll be just as nitpicky about season to.  Does anyone else have any nits they want to pick?

I grabbed a screencap from the new trailer (""Shadow"") and am wondering if anybody has an idea where scene this is from?  Judging by the shield it's one of the Clegane's killing the crap out of somebody in what appears to be King's Landing.  However, the only time I remember that happening in ""CoK"" is during the Battle of the Blackwater, which I don't think this is due to the general non-military nature of the people around the fight (people are just kind of chilling out, one guy in the foreground is just drinking).

Thoughts?

This is not meant as a criticism of the show, and I have thoroughly enjoyed the casting decisions made. I just think it is strange that everyone speaks like they come from the north of England, especially when Scottish actors (I'm thinking the Mormonts here) have deigned to speak with an English accent. Given that the Wiki of Ice and Fire speculates that much of the arms and armour of the North are based on Scottish armies of the 13th and 14th century, would anyone else like to hear some Scots in the North?",3,1,False,self,,,,,

Has anyone noticed the motif (if that's the right term) of repetition in ADwD? 

In one of Bran's chapters, three stages of the moon are repeated to show the passage of time, we have Reek constantly repeating his ""Reek Reek it rhymes with..."" bit, in an Asha chapter we have the line about marching for ""15 days, 100 miles as the crow flys"". 

I suppose it's not really limited to ADwD when you take into account phrases like ""Valar Morghulis"", ""The night is dark and full of terrors"", and the prevalent reminder of how little Jon Snow knows, but these are rooted in dialogue, whereas the aforementioned ADwD are more like literary devices.
