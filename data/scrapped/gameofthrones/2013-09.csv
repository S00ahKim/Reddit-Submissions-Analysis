The threads were so popular and such a great way to keep people inovlved during the offseason that we've decided to do it again this year.  Therefore, I'm happy to announce the beginning of the 2013-2014 re-watch series:

##30 Weeks, 30 Episodes until the Season 4 Premiere!

Now, I know what you're thinking, and no HBO hasn't announced a premiere date for Season 4 yet.  We're just going to have to get this party started based on an educated guess.  So until we hear otherwise, we're going to assume that Season 4 of Game of Thrones will begin on Sunday, March 30, 2014.  This is the date that most closely matches the premieres of the previous seasons and it is exactly 30 weeks from tomorrow night, September 1, 2013.  Just enough time to rewatch all 30 episodes of Game of Thrones!

Re-watch re-discussion threads work almost exactly like the regular season discussion threads with one major difference:  **The threads have a spoiler scope of [TV Spoilers] meaning that spoilers from all of the officially aired episodes are allowed.**  It is a **re**-watch series, so if you are participating in the threads, it's assumed that you've seen the episodes at least once before.  Otherwise, the threads will be just like they normally are during the season.  They will be posted at 9:00 PM EST on Sunday nights and will stay up for the entire week.

Tomorrow we'll start it all off with episode 1.01 ""Winter is Coming.""  See you there!

---|
Robert Baratheon (King of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros) and his Queen, Cersei Lannister, travel north to make his old friend Eddard ""Ned"" Stark  Lord of the frozen land of Winterfell  an offer he cannot refuse. Across the narrow sea in Essos, the exiled Prince Viserys Targaryen forges a new alliance to regain the Iron Throne; he will trade his sister Daenerys in marriage to the savage Dothraki warlord Khal Drogo in exchange for Drogo's army. Back in Winterfell, Ned's wife Catelyn receives a clue that may implicate members of the royal family in a murder, and their young son Brandon makes a jaw-dropping discovery.|

- So I guess we should presume he'll be present at the wedding?
- Is Jaime aware that Cersei's offsprings are actually his and not Robert's? I don't recall this is actually mentioned anywhere?

Considering that the Baratheons originally branched off from the Targaryen's through a bastard, is it possible that it's just the Targaryen blood that is magic and nothing to do with him being king?

There are no spoilers here, as the only info from the book is the length of the seasons, which is one of the basic premises of the series. 

Anyway, I was thinking about how long the seasons were. For arguments sake, lets say that the average season is 5 years. That makes one complete revolution around the sun about 20 of our earth years. Now for whatever reason the people of Westeros don't count their years by season, so again we'll assume one year for them is 365 days. This means that the rotation of their planet is the same speed as Earth. 

Now, the seasons are caused by Earth's 23.5 degree tilt. So in order for the seasons to last so long, the planet would have to be tilted in any given direction for that length of time. For this to occur, the orbit of the planet must be large enough. By my calculations, it would have to be at a distance from its sun equal to about 324M Km (Roughly halfway between Jupiter and Saturn from our sun). 

At this distance, to maintain the same size sun we see in the show (our own) and the same levels of heat, the sun in this system would need to approximately 6.67 times larger than Sol. Now I havent calculated anything about the actual temperature this sun would need to be but I have to assume it would be a yellow sun. 

Just some food for thought. And if I'm horribly wrong about any of this please inform me otherwise!

Edit: assume its not a magical cause for arguments sake.

I actually emailed my professor about it and he explained that another possibility, one that a few of you have mentioned, is that the axial precession of the planet is changing at a rate nearly, but not quite perfectly equal to the length of one revolution. This would account for the long seasons and the varying lengths in most cases. Its not a perfect explanation but its all fiction anyway so its just fun to speculate.",39,27,False,self,,,,,

I just finished chapter thirty-eight, I know that's a Tyrion chapter, but this actually concerns both him and Bran.
Okay, so we all know Jaime pushed Bran, he was crippled, and then an attempt made on his life with ""Tyrion's"" dagger, which Peytr Baelish claims he lost betting on a tourney.

None of that makes any sense. Totally get why Cersei/Jamie want Bran dead because of the twincest, but why give that knife to the sellsword? Tyrion points out to Lysa in the Vale that he'd never bet against his family which is a huge fucking DUH. Tyrion and Jaime clearly have the best relationship in their family.
So my question is: If Tyrion never bet against Jaime in favor of Loras, and therefore never won the dagger from Littlefinger, who sent the sellsword with that particular weapon?

Was it Littlefinger acting on orders from Cersei and he mistakenly chose his own knife, only to lie to Catelyn about losing it when realizing his blunder?
Were Littlefinger or Cersei trying to frame Tyrion?

If this is a detail that is revealed in later books or if I'm just completely over-analyzing this whole thing, someone PLEASE let me know before I lose my mind, do the unthinkable, and turn to google. Does who's dagger it is actually mean anything to the overall plot of the story? Maybe I missed a scene clearing up the confusion in the show, but I do believe after Tyrion was released from the Vale the whole ""who the fuck tried to kill my son"" Scooby Doo-esque mystery just vanished.",51,14,False,self,,,,,

My biggest disappointment in what they changed from the book was Jon's final chapter. Where they went through a tense and harrowing campaign trying to escape the wildlings and being picked off one by one.

I liked the show's banter between him and Ygritte, but ""Jon gets lost, gets captured, finds out every other ranger except Qhorin got killed searching for him"" was really weak in comparison. 

I mean they already have wildling extras and Night's Watch extras, they don't need to hire actual actors. Just have the Halfhand give them their orders (""you're our best archer, you need to stay behind and hold them off"", ""head back to the Lord Commander while we lead them the other direction""), find a little cave (or have one on a set) for the final standoff.

---

There are only two more faiths that are significant to the story and have been discussed in the series, and neither are really accepted by the majority of Westerosi common folk.

###THE DROWNED GOD

The Ironborn are a brutish ethnic group, very much resembling Vikings and pirates, but they also have their own distinct culture. And with that culture is their own distinct religion. Because they live on islands and spend a lot of time seafaring, it seems natural that their belief system has centered around two godsthe Drowned God and the Storm God.

The Drowned God is the good god in this faith, but he is a harsh god (harsh as his people). It is said the he made the ironborn to reave and rape, to carve out kingdoms on the mainland, and to pay the iron price. He resides in a great hall under the sea. His eternal enemy, the Storm God, resides in a hall within the clouds. It is said the two deities have been in conflict for millennia and that the sea roils in anger when they engage in battle. While the ironborn believe in the existence of the Storm God, they do not worship him.

##Drowning

When an ironborn dies, custom dictates that the body is dumped into the sea. It is believed the deceased will be feasted in the Drowned Gods watery halls, his every want satisfied by mermaids. Its very important for the Ironborn to be close to the water (recall Yara telling Theon not to die so far from the sea in Season 2), which also explains why they never settle on the mainland.

Drowning and resurrection is a huge part of this faith. Drowning is the traditional method of execution, but is also viewed as holy, and it is believed that the faithful and righteous have no need to fear it. Newborn are drowned shortly after birth, being submerged into seawater (think christening). This is done to commit the child to the Drowned God, so that when they die they may find the DGs watery halls.

It is also traditional to use drowning as a cleansing ritual. A priest of the religion, known as a Drowned Man, will drown the person and then use a technique akin to CPR to revive them. It has a high success rate (higher than CPR has naturally, so I believe there can be some supernatural aspect attributed to the DG). If the man dies, he is assumed to not be a true believer. All of the Drowned Men have at one point had a second drowning.

Upon his return to Pyke, Theon is drowned (in the show, the equivalent was splashing water on his face) by a Drowned Man. Drowned Men also bless ships, and are forbidden to shed the blood of any ironborn (drowning is of course not considered spilling blood).

A repeating phrase in this faith is What is dead may never die, which refers to the first death when a child is drowned, gaining strength from the experience.

###THE FAITH OF RHLLOR

The Faith of Rhllor (also known as the Lord of Light) is a very dualistic religion with origins in Asshai (the birthplace of Melissandre) and has spread throughout Essos and has sprouted roots in Westeros with King Stannis.

The basic belief is that Rhllor, the god of life, fire, and light, is engaged in a timeless struggle against the Great Other, whose name cannot be said, the god of ice and death. Their eternal struggle over the fate of the world is destined to end only when Azor Ahai, a messaianic figure, returns wielding a flaming sword called Lightbringer and raises a dragon of stone.

##Azor Ahai and Lightbringer

Azor Ahai was said to have lived during the Age of Heroes, around 8000 years before Aegons Landing. He lived during the battle with the Others and would eventually defeat them with the sword Lightbringer.

Lightbringer itself has a great legend associated with it. When Azor Ahai was chosen to fight the darkness, he was told he had to forge a heros sword. He labored thirty days and thirty nights, but when he went to temper the sword in water, it broke. He started over, spending fifty days and fifty nights to make an even better sword. He captured a lion and drove the sword into its heart to temper the sword with its blood, but once more the sword shattered. The third time, knowing hed have to make an ultimate sacrifice, he spent a hundred days and nights forging his sword and drove it through the heart of his wife, Nissa Nissa, tempering it with her blood. Her soul is said to have combined with the sword, creating Lightbringer.

The Faith of Rhllor is based on the prophecy after he defeated the Others, which went as follows:

*There will come a day after a long summer when the stars bleed and the cold breath of darkness falls heavy on the world. In this dread hour a warrior shall draw from the fire a burning sword. And that sword shall be Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes, and he who clasps it shall be Azor Ahai come again, and the darkness shall flee before him.*

Sometimes on this sub and /r/asoiaf, you will see a [Book Spoilers] post about Azor Ahai theories, and there are people who try to compare events and actions in the stories, saying that X person is Azor Ahai, and y represents his Nissa Nissa, and he will defeat the Others with z, which represents Lightbringer. We dont know who Azor Ahai is (and to all book readers, this is not the place to debate it), but Melissandre has a guess that shes very sure about.

##Melissandre and Stannis

She approached Stannis around the time he left Kings Landing (after the death of Jon Arryn right before the events of Season 1), and said that she saw in the fires that he was Azor Ahai reborn, destined to defeat the armies of the Great Other. She is a Red Priestess, the name given to the priests of the Faith of Rhllor. While he has the strongest claim on the Iron Throne as Roberts true heir, his war for the Iron Throne, at least to his supporters, is to consolidate his power in Westeros to fight against the Great Other when the time comes.

It is for this reason, when they hear of the white walkers attacking the Nights Watch, Melissandre is quick to position Stannis to save them. She believes that the real enemy is the Great Other, the god of the white walkers. And as Davos said in the books (a line which should not have been omitted): Youve been trying to win the throne to save the kingdom when you should be trying to save the kingdom to win the throne.

His most loyal supportersor most of themhave converted from the Faith of the Seven to the Faith of Rhllor, with Davos being the shining exception. One God, One King, One Realm is the general battle cry of his followers. He gave up the crowned stag sigil of his family, favoring instead a sigil of the burning heart of Rhllor, with the stag in the middle.

##R'hllor in Essos

As mentioned, the priests are known as Red Priests, for the flowing red robes they wear. They may be priests or priestesses, as opposed to the septons of the Faith of the Seven and the Drowned Men of the Faith of the Drowned God. In Essos, red priests are a common sight, as the Faith of Rhllor is widespread in the Free Cities. The Red Temples are the houses of worship, and they oftentimes buy children as slaves who are raised to be red priests and priestesses, temple prostitutes, or warriors. The warriors are known as the Fiery Hand, and they protect the Red Temples.

There are Red Temples in Pentos, Braavos and Selhorys. One of the largest Red Temples is in Lys, while Volantis has one known as the Temple of the Lord of Light. It is suggested by Obara Sand that a red temple exists in Dorne, and a small one for sailors can be found in Oldtown in the Reach. In the show, the only red priests/priestesses weve met so far are Melissandre and Thoros of Myr, though there are two others that make appearances as far as I can recall in the rest of the series.

Every evening, red priests light fires and sing prayers to Rhllor, asking him to bring the dawn the next day. Priests often gaze into the flames in an effort to receive visions. Red priests sometimes perform sacrifices. If youll recall, Varys tells a story in Season 3 about a red priest throwing his balls into the fires when he was cut.

Just like the Faith of the Drowned God has a signature phrase, the Faith of Rhllor has one: The night is dark and full of terrors. Youve probably heard it once or twice.

When it comes to magic, it is very obvious that the priests practice magic. If it wasnt obvious when Melissandre gave birth to a shadow (the very scene which encouraged me to read the books to find out what the fuck was happening), then it was certainly obvious when Thoros of Myr brought Beric back to life *six* times.

A lot of people use this magic as proof that Rhllor is the one true god in the ASOIAF/GoT universe, although that negates the fact that the old gods have a lot of magic associated with them (warging and greensight, for example). I am personally of the opinion that the red priests know how to use magic with fire, and have attributed that magic to a god. But no one (book readers included) know which (if any) belief systems are right or not.

As always, leave any questions and comments below. This is the last religion post, so next time Ill start getting into the Targaryen dynasty with the rule of Aegon the Conqueror and the subsequent rules of his children King Aenys and then King Maegor the Cruel.

For me, there are several things.

First of all, I do not in any way, shape or form, want Jon Snow to leave the Night's Watch, this is simply because I'm tired of oathbreakers, from Jamie to Ser I'm gonna bang the princess of Dorne then get my face smashed in, I'm just tired of them. Plus I think he's much more badass as Lord Commander as apposed to Lord of Winterfell, Warden of the North etc.

Secondly, and this seems to be a unpopular opinion, but I truly want to see Arya become a faceless man, a true faceless man, meaning she becomes no one. I still want to see her carry out her vengeance, but rather as someone who is Arya Stark as well as many others. This is because I think the Faceless men and the Bravoosi are the most badass motherfuckers in all of the world, and I want to see Arya become completely devoted to her God, Death.

Thirdly, I want R+L=J to not happen, not because I don't believe it's true, I'm actually 99% sure, but rather because I want to see GRRM go ""lol fuck u"" and pull a complete 180 and make fools of us all.

And lastly, I want to see Varys show us his true colors and turn into a merman, but I digress, this is a what you want thread and Varys is most surely a merman.

And also of course, Stannis the Mannis for the Iron throne.",63,6,False,self,,,,,

I always seem to be drawn to the ""baddies"" in fictions, no matter the medium, and I often get asked in discussions to justify WHY characters that most view as cruel are my favorites. Draco Malfory is probably who I have to stick up for most, though it's getting very hard to convince people that I'm not demented for being head over heels for Ramsey Bolton. He's the heir to my House, after all.

But I'm afraid I digress! I have to stick up for Joffrey a lot too and I honestly do not understand the total unbridled hatred that people seem to have for such a young boy.
I honestly think that is a case of more nurture than nature, even if a lot of his bad attributes are blamed on his incestual conception. Tommen and Myrcella seem both delightful, smart children, so why is Joff the rotten apple?

In my opinion it's simply his upbringing. Cersei's yielded to his every desire since he was born and just loved him in the most selfish way which was bound to screw him up a little. That combined with Robert's almost constant neglect, especially emotionally, throw in Joffrey's Malfoy-esque obsession to make his father proud of him and he's a regular time bomb. Of course his psychopathy only worsened when he was put on the throne, he's still a child with a twisted idea of the responsibility that has been thrust upon him.

It didn't have to be that way! I see Joff not for the little shit he is, but  what's underneath. I personally think that Eddard should have taken Littlefinger's advice of keeping Joffrey as his ward until he came of age.
Stark was an obviously honorable man, something he could've instilled in Joffrey after his Robert's death. All of the Stark children have a very good sense of right and wrong, and they appear to base their decisions on what is right rather than what Joffrey does, which is whatever the seven hells he wants. It's the classic battle of what is right and what is easy.
Also, if he had remained betrothed and eventually married Sansa, I think she could have finally shown him that he was capable of caring for someone. Joffrey liked Sansa and I feel like that would've only continued to grow. Even if Ned had been executed as normal, Sansa showed her wits by playing them against Joffrey's. The only example that immediately comes to mind is when she prevents him from killing the drunk knight on his name day. She got what she wanted without angering the Brat King, he also never noticed her subtle manipulation. Sansa is a very smart girl, like a young Cersei with better intentions, and I find it very likely that she would've continued to sweetly manipulate Joffrey, and slowly changing him into someone decent enough to govern the realm.

Again, it's all speculation, but I think he is very often unfairly judged and if people just look deep, deep down they might appreciate just what an interesting character he actually is. I'd love to hear different theories or evidence as to why/why not you agree. Maybe my opinion of him will change, with four books to go I don't doubt it!",40,18,False,self,,,,,

Bran's fate remains in doubt. Having accepted his new role as the King's Hand (the King's closest confidant and chief bodyguard), Ned leaves his home in Winterfell with his daughters Sansa and Arya, while Catelyn stays behind to tend to Bran. Jon Snow, Ned's bastard son, heads north to join the brotherhood of the Night's Watch, protectors of the Wall that keeps the vicious ""Others"" and the savage wildlings from entering civilised Westeros. Tyrion Lannister, a dwarf and the Queen's brother, decides to forego the trip south with his family, instead joining Jon's entourage heading to the Wall. Viserys bides his time in hopes of winning back the throne, while Daenerys focuses her attention on learning how to please her new husband, Drogo. |

Having read all through ASOIAF and watched the show, I firmly believe that Martin's willingness to kill off any character - any time, anywhere - is the single most important element in making the story great.

It's great because, even when a character survives a harrowing incident, you're on the edge of your seat because you know they might not! He killed Robert, Ned, the Old Bear, Robb, Catelyn, Joffrey, Ygritte, Tywin, Jon (maybe), Kevan, and probably Moonboy for all I know! So, when Brienne is confronted by the Bloody Mummers, I am very genuinely fearful for her life.

When discussing ASOIAF with non-readers, I'm just as careful about revealing survivals as I am with deaths. It's very unique in that ""so-and-so doesn't die (yet)"" is just as much a spoiler as that same character dying.

I just started watching Breaking Bad (no spoilers, please), and while the show is really outstanding television, it's kind of lame knowing the Walt and Jesse can't die. Dexter can't die (at least until the series finale). In the vast majority of drama and/or action shows, the main character can have all kinds of horrible things befall them, but they can't die. So, when a bad guy puts a gun in their face, you're not really afraid for them.

*TL;DR: Thanks a lot, GRRM. You've ruined television and movies for me.*",55,60,False,self,,,,,

For those not aware of the basic plot, [here is the synopsis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigone_\(Sophocles\)#Synopsis).   
  
**Stannis and Creon both are hard, rigid men.** Neither would compromise their beliefs to appease others. Just as Stannis was unflexable in meeting with Renly (he offered him succession to the throne and Storm's End, not bad considering Stannis had practically no bannermen), Creon was unflexable in his sentencing of Antigone, which itself was a result of him making a point by leaving his nephew to rot. In addition, both men are not generally liked to the people at large.
  
**They both don't let their personal relationships get in the way of what (they feel) must be done.** Creon sentenced his daughter-in-law-to-be to death, left his own nephew to rot once dead, and the only person I believe Creon to be truly compassionate towards is his son, Haemon. Stannis told Renly in no uncertain terms that if he did not bend the knee, he would be killed. He was then killed. Stannis has always been transparent in the fact that he harbors no love towards his brothers, his allies, or even his wife. The only character I have seen him show genuine affection for is his daughter, Shireen.  
  
**They are both wary of the gods.** Stannis had no interest in the new gods, or the old, and even regards R'hllor with disinterest at times. For him, his religion is his rightful kingdom, and a subordinate  society He is only interested in Melissandre for her apparent powers, as soon as he claims his throne, my money is that if he could, he would drop her like a bad habit. He's wary of her, and her intentions (with good reason). Creon is still a follower of the gods, but he obviously puts little stock in them. He defiles their laws in place of his own. He puts his own values of a docile society where he is king in front of the will of the gods. It's not until Tiresias warns him that all of his sins will come back in a big way that he finally bends and seeks to undo what he has done.

Some other connections:  
  
Ser Davos is Antigone. He is imprisoned when he breaks the law in an attempt to change the will of his king, despite being close in counsel with Stannis. In many ways, Ser Davos is just as headstrong as Stannis, risking his life and freedom recklessly in attempts to sway Stannis' path. He also shares a personal relationship with Stannis' daughter.  
  
Shireen is Haemon. She's the only person Stannis has affection for. Despite the fact that Ser Davos is Shireen's BFF, he imprisons him, and doesn't attempt to hide this from his daughter.  
  
**Some quotes to consider:** (the following quotes are said by Creon, unless otherwise stated)  
  
*""...and as for the man who sets private friendship above the public welfare,I have no use for him.""*   
  
*""...but his brother Polyneices, who broke his exile to come back with fire and sword against his native city and the shrines of his fathers gods, whose one idea was to spill the blood of his blood and sell his own people into slaveryPolyneices, I say, is to have no burial: no man is to touch him or say the least prayer for him; he shall lie on the plain, unburied; and the birds and the scavenging dogs can do with him whatever they like. This is my command, and you can see the wisdom behind it.""*   
  
Choragos: *""I have been wondering, King: can it be that the gods have done this?""*
Creon: *""Stop! Must you doddering wrecks go out of your heads entirely? The gods! Intolerable!""*  
  
*""[Antigone] has much to learn. The inflexible heart breaks first, the toughest iron cracks first, and the wildest horses bend their necks at the pull of the smallest curb.""*  
  
*""[Antigone] is guilty of a double insolence, breaking the given laws and boasting of it. Who is the man here, she or I, if this crime goes unpunished? Sisters child, or more than sisters child.""*  
  
Haemon: *""You are not in a position to know everything that people say or do, or what they feel: your temper terrifies themeveryone will tell you only what you like to hear.""*  
  
What do you think? Is there any chance GRRM based parts of Stannis in Creon, or am I grasping at straws?

My faculty (engineering) typically bases its theme off of blockbuster movies. This year, however, we decided to take things in a different direction by going with Game of Thrones. 

After lots of debating and planning, what you see here is the result of many months of planning. 

The throne is made of a wood base, with chicken wire and paper mache having been used to shape the form. After that, we used cardboard and Styrofoam to create the illusion of the swords. 

The Dragon was modeled in SolidWorks prior to its construction. Similar to the throne, chicken wire and paper mache were used to make its general form. However, the wings were constructed primarily of aluminum. In addition, each wing was powered by two pistons. Furthermore, there were three addition pistons inside of the body to drive both wings simultaneously.

All credit for these designs goes to our build team, who worked tirelessly to create what you see. If you have any questions, feel free to ask, and I'll answer as best as I can. Thanks!",0,1,False,default,,,,,

Theyre conspirin with Tywin to ruin King Robbs day.  
Young Tyrion, hes an imp I hear, but ever so clever and sly.  
Hes half your height, most certainly, but hes got twice your mind.  
And Cersei the beautiful, how charismatic and sweet.  
Unless, of course, you look again.  
Then you and the snake shall meet.  
Dont think Ive forgotten, the master of them all   
Not Joffrey, no, hes a dick.  
Lord Tywin with the lions maw.  
The Rains of Castamere, the song so clever and cruel.  
How much is legend how much is truth?  
It matters not, for its he that rules.  
But Joffrey sits the throne, you say, before him all must cower!  
The question is, if you think for long,  
do you think a crown gives you power?  
The answer is no, tells you bastard Jon Snow  
Hes seen the king beyond the wall  
His army will march, for sure they will,   
and night's watch will kill them all.  
Whitewalkers are coming, three blows on the horn.  
It signals that death is near.  
The icy cold grips round your throat,  
 leaving naught but fear.  
But alas, hope is not lost, Daenerys Stormborn comes!  
Targaryen, the Breaker of chains  
Only slavers and rapers she shuns.   
Shes Mother of Dragons, Khaleesi, and more  
But she alone can save us.  
Fire and blood, the old words say,  
For shes queen of westeros.  
Stannis hopes to win his throne, the place thats his by birth.  
But how will he fair, with his brothers dead, and his face so absent of mirth?  
Who can say whether hell succeed, save Melisandre the witch.  
She whispers council in his ear, and claims to make him rich.  
The war of kings the songs all say, leaving out the queen.  
But in the end,Lord Baelish wins,   
through his clever schemes.  
In the game of thrones you win or die, no room for grey or shade.  
In the end, only the rich folk win.  
Its them for which the swords are made.  
Renly, Robert, Aerys, Viserys, and poor Ned of Winterfell.  
For power lies not with kings or lords  
Only men with  swords to sell.

As a bookreader, I'm interested in seeing non-reader responses. It's like a blast of nostalgia, taking me back to my first journey with GRRM across Westeros and Essos. Book readers are welcome too, since the pacing of the series has changed rapidly and things are happening at totally different times than they do in the books. Just make sure you use the proper spoilers!",15,17,False,self,,,,,

Ned joins the King's Small Council at King's Landing, capital of the Seven Kingdoms, and learns just how poorly Westeros is being managed. Catelyn decides to go covertly to the south to warn her husband, but is intercepted by an old friend, Councillor Petyr ""Littlefinger"" Baelish. Jon struggles to adapt to life on the Wall, as he trains with a number of low-born recruits who are not impressed by his bloodline. Tyrion, also visiting the Wall, is beseeched by the Watch Commander Lord Mormont to plead the King and Queen to send more men to join the Night's Watch, for powerful enemies are massing beyond the Wall. Bran, now awake, is unable to recall how he fell. Daenerys, now possessing no small measure of control as Drogo's ""Khaleesi"", begins to stand up to Viserys.|

But even if they had, I would love for them to at least say something to one another, just an interesting last conversation before Joff finally bites it.

1. Is Arya a skinchanger as well? Did she know the guy attacking her was who he was because she saw through the cat or did she just figure it out?
2. This is more of a theory/question but could Jaime, Cersei, Joffrey, Tommen, and Myrcella all be Targaryens? There is a chapter in [AFFC](#b ""The last Jaime chapter iirc, but he is talking with his aunt Genna Lannister and she says something like you aren't Tywin's son, only Tyrion is, which at first I took to just mean he is the only one who can inherit because he is not Kingsguard and he is not a woman, but then I read into ADWD"")

[ADWD](#b ""I recently read a Daenerys chapter where she asks Ser Barristan who her ancestors would have married had it been their choice. Barristan says her father Aerys Targaryen had his eye on Joanna Lannister and while at the wedding, said something out loud like 'It's a shame we no longer have the old way where a King can claim the right to the first night' much to the displeasure of Lord Tywin. Then Barristan says he has said too much and gets cut off."")

[Jaime and Cersei theory](#g ""There is also the old saying that when a Targaryen is born, a coin is flipped. Jaime and Cersei could be both sides of the coin, and since they interbred like the Targaryens did, Tommen and Myrcella could be the 'sane' side of the coin, and Joffrey the 'insane' side."")",16,3,False,self,,,,,

1107,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2013-9-20,2013,9,20,0,1mpti0,self.gameofthrones,"[Season 3, possible AFFC/ADWD]A question to all of you about Jaime and Theon",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1mpti0/season_3_possible_affcadwda_question_to_all_of/,GuanYuber,1379605965,"Wall of text incoming; tl;dr at the bottom.

So I have a question that's been nagging me since I watched Season 3.  Basically everyone that I've talked to about the Season has told me two things that has been almost uniform: the first is that everyone is starting to see Jaime's side of the story, and are beginning to like him more, especially as Season 3 came to a close.  The other is that no one likes Theon, regardless of all he's been through.  This confuses me, and let me explain why.

BEFORE I GO ANY FURTHER, THESE QUESTIONS ARE LIMITED TO THE END OF SEASON 3 AND NOT NECESSARILY DEALING WITH THE BOOKS, SO IF THERE ARE ANY BOOK SPOILERS PAST WHERE THE SERIES HAS LEFT OFF, PLEASE MARK THEM

Theon has, in my opinion, one of the best story arcs in the series.  Having been taken away from his strict Ironborn family to be raised by the Starks who constantly remind him that he doesn't truly belong, he returns to the Iron Islands hoping for a warmer welcome from his family, especially considering he is the last living son of Balon.  Instead, he is seen as weak and, while not strictly told he doesn't belong, it is heavily implied that he is too weak to ever belong to the Iron Islands.  Torn between his real family and his ""adoptive"" family, Theon has to make a choice and go full steam ahead in trying to become one with that family.  Having failed to be seen as part of the Stark family for 10 years, Theon decides to try to belong with the ironborn.  Theon steps deeper and deeper into more heinous acts in his attempts to become a Greyjoy, culminating in the supposed murder of Bran and Rickon (which everyone still believes he did).

This is the part of the series when most people say they hate Theon most.  But then we move into Season 3 when Theon is captured and brutally tortured, however not before Theon confides in Ramsay that he regrets what he did and laments that he can never go back to the Starks, ultimately deciding that he can never belong anywhere, unless he wants to continue down the path of cruelty that he showed in Winterfell.  In spite of this, Theon is brutally tortured, having his little finger flayed/cut off among other things.  Theon's story's theme, to me, is ""At what point have you condoned for your sins?""  Despite all the pain Theon has gone through as a result of his horrible acts, at what point, in each reader's mind, will it be enough to say he has repaid his ""debt?""


Even after all that Theon has suffered, everyone I ask still says to me, ""I don't really like Theon,"" or even ""I hate Theon.""  This brings me to Jaime.

Unlike the face that Theon puts on (where he is despotic/tyrannical as the lord of Winterfell), the only face that Jaime puts on is that he isn't bothered by declarations of ""Kingslayer.""  He pushed Bran from a window hoping to kill him, for the simple crime of catching him and his twin sister having sex, and is unrepentant, even when confronted by Catelyn about it.  But when Jaime falls into despondency and self-pity after losing his hand, people I ask start to feel sorry for him, pity him, and even say they like his character now.  Certainly, Jaime takes opportunities to redeem himself through saving Brienne from the bear pit among other things, but the only difference between Jaime and Theon, in my mind, is that Jaime was given the chance to redeem himself, whereas Theon never was.

Both Theon and Jaime are misunderstood, but in my mind, Theon has more redeeming qualities than Jaime does.  So why does Jaime get a ""free pass"" and Theon doesn't?


tl;dr: Why does everyone like Jaime and dislike Theon, even though they're very similar in a lot of ways?",44,22,False,self,,,,,

I realized in another thread that I believe they will NOT use the hairnet. 

The costume designers for GoT have not taken the typical historical costume drama route. I am not complaining about this at all. I think it's a genius approach because it adds even more of a fantasy element. [Dany's Qarth Costumes](http://i.imgur.com/Z1xvO2N.jpg) and [Cersei's armor dress](http://i.imgur.com/wcLNIVL.png) are two examples. 

This is an example of a hairnet that GRRM was talking about. [From Showtime's The Borgias](http://i.imgur.com/zePgHtX.jpg). This would look ridiculous with the other costumes, and its also completely illogical that Sansa would randomly decide to start such a trend. 

I suppose they could replace it with a necklace or ring but I don't see how Sansa wouldn't realize someone removing a part of something like that. 

It makes me wonder if they will have Sansa have a more direct involvement with the assassination. She was obviously naive and immature last season, but I wonder if they'll have the RW be a tipping point for her character, with a little help from Big Daddy Baelish of course.

Towards the end of the book, I thought it was weird that Melissandre was encouraging Jon to warg with Ghost. This made me wonder if Jon's role was even bigger than that of Lord Commander.

Previous to this, and I'm sorry I can't remember where I got this notion (somewhere in the last three books - I read them quite quickly so they kind of blur in my mind's eye) I had weighed the possibility of Jon being Lyanna and Rhaegar's bastard. This would explain the apparent out-of-character behaviour of Eddard when he fathered Jon - he created the lie of his infidelity to protect his sister's baby. It makes sense that Eddard never betrayed his honour apart from to protect his and his sister's children. I admit that I am no expert, having only read the books once, but as far as I can remember, nothing makes this impossible.

Assuming that this is the case, Jon is the third remaining descendant of the Mad King and as such the possibility of him being the third head of the Targaryen Dragon (with Dany &amp; Griff jnr.) emerges. As well as his dragon blood, he has the first men's in his veins. the former is necessary for control of dragons; the latter is true of all wargs. So John is possibly the only one with the ability to warg a dragon. This might be the reason Melissandre encourages his warging, whether or not it was an intelligent decision on her part or simply came from a vision.

Reading on, (again assuming the above to be true) I realised that Jon's demise at the hands of his brothers makes him a candidate to be Azor Aghai. He now has the potential to be (re)born amidst the salt and smoke that was seen as confirmation of Dany as the saviour. If Thoros can resurrect Dondarrion, surely Melissandre (as an apparently far greater priestess) can bring back Jon. His mix of  first men (who historically repulsed the Others) and dragon blood (embodying fire) seems ideal to fit this role. Stannis never seemed particularly amazing anyway.

To me at least, this is a pretty exciting theory, and although I can't see anything which totally rules this out, I am far aware it is far from certain to be the case. There are a lot of things which could turn it upside down e.g. Jon being vulnerable to fire. If anyone knows anything that would exclude my theory please let me know.

I realise that some of you have probably re-read the series so have a better idea of what might happen but I really want this to be the case, just so Jon, who was probably my favourite character and was one of the few I thought GRRM would let survive, can not be dead. Riding and warging a dragon while weilding a flaming sword would be pretty cool too.

In summary:

* Jon Snow is Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark's bastard
* His Targaryen blood grants him some allegiance from dragons
* His Stark (and therefore 1st men's) blood allows him to warg 
* Together his parents' lineages mean he could warg a dragon
* His death allows him to be (re)born by Melissandre's hand and fulfil the prophecy as Azor Aghai, fighting the Others

Hit me with your thoughts, rebuttals and other ideas!

EDIT:

My friend just pointed out that this would also fit with the ""Ice and Fire"" of the series title. Pretty Cool.",53,29,False,self,,,,,

Here is my wish list:

**Jaime + Sansa**

Since Jaime arrives before the wedding, I think they *have* to do this. It makes sense that Jaime would visit Sansa, try to comfort her, help her, protect her since he wants to keep his oath. Sansa can be suspicious and block every attempt.

**Brienne + Loras**

I want the see how they talk in the cell and how Loras comes to realize, she did not kill Stannis.

**Joffrey + Margery**

None of them are a POV character, but I think we need it. This scene has to make clear that even with all her wits, good will, and charms, Margery still can not control Joffrey. The scene could show Margery fail and Joffrey going crazy, possibly hurting Margery. This establishes then the need and motives for the Tyrells to change their approach. One problem is only that it might be to late for this scene since Littlefinger is already gone and he would needed to be involved after it, but he already is.

**Oberyn Council &amp; Jury scenes**

To establish Oberyn a little more, show him on the council and jury, arguing, outwitting the others (Tyrell,Pycell,etc).

Someone posted a mashup with ""The Wall"" but I really feel that song doesn't match the tone of the show very well, and ""Hey you"" does. Plus, there is a lot of great material that seems to refer to GoT. I'd like some ideas for any scenes from the show you can match up to lines from the [song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RIlo9TMeDw):


Hey you, out there in the cold  
Getting lonely, getting old  
Can you feel me?  
Hey you, standing in the aisles  
With itchy feet and fading smiles  
Can you feel me?  
Hey you, don't help them to bury the light  
Don't give in without a fight.  


Hey you, out there on your own  
Sitting naked by the phone  
Would you touch me?  
Hey you, with you ear against the wall  
Waiting for someone to call out  
Would you touch me?  
Hey you, would you help me to carry the stone?  
Open your heart, I'm coming home.  


But it was only fantasy.  
The wall was too high,  
As you can see.  
No matter how he tried,  
He could not break free.  
And the worms ate into his brain.  


Hey you, standing in the road  
always doing what you're told,  
Can you help me?  
Hey you, out there beyond the wall,  
Breaking bottles in the hall,  
Can you help me?  
Hey you, don't tell me there's no hope at all  
Together we stand, divided we fall.

However, I paid little attention to the fact that there were books as well. I sort of assumed it would be like Dexter, where the first season is nearly identical to the first book, but then the stories split off in their own directions. I would like to know, how closely related the books are to the show? I really love this universe and really want to get into it more, but when completely different plots are happening with the same characters, I get easily confused. If you have the time, I would love some help with this. Thanks! TL;DR: How similar are the plot lines between the books and the show?",16,10,False,self,,,,,

Ned searches for clues to the unexplained death of Jon Arryn (the former King's Hand), and in the process uncovers King Robert's illegitimate son. Robert and his guests witness a tournament honoring Ned. Jon takes measures to protect Samwell Tarly, an awkward and friendless boy, from the abuse of the Night's Watchmen; a frustrated Viserys clashes with his newly empowered sister; Sansa dreams of life as a queen, while Arya envisions a far different future. Catelyn rallies her father's allies to make a point, while Tyrion finds himself caught in the wrong place at the wrong time.|

* **Book spoilers still need tags:** If it's not in the show, [tag it](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/wiki/spoiler_guide).

When Robb and Talisa get married the words they say are in prayer to the Seven. This struck me as odd, since I had believed the Starks of Winterfell were all about the Old God's, and Talisa being from Volantis wouldn't have had any strong link to the seven either.

Has it been stated anywhere that Robb prefers the Seven over the Old Gods? Could it have simply been something Talisa preferred?

I'm assuming the show is just a retelling of the original books, right? Since there are 5 books (with a 6th and 7th in the works), does that mean there will be that many seasons? 

Like, does season one cover the first book, season two the second, season three the third, and so on? If so, will there be a season for the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th books? Apparently the 6th is still being written, with the 7th only a concept right now, and it took George R. R. Martin 5 years to write the 5th book. It could be another decade before the 7th is released.

Is that how the show is structured? Or does it just follow a narrow story arch within the books? I never read the books, so I don't know if there's a lot more going on in them that the show doesn't cover or what.

So, I love the books and the series so much, I decided to make these embossed leather iPad covers for myself:
House Stark: [iPad](https://www.etsy.com/listing/156815812/game-of-thrones-handmade-leather-smart?ref=shop_home_active) and [iPad mini](https://www.etsy.com/listing/156757929/game-of-thrones-handmade-leather-smart?ref=shop_home_feat)

House Lannister: [coming soon](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=526161757462560&amp;set=a.490066031072133.1073741834.490032504408819&amp;type=3&amp;theater)

I make the embossing plates, I emboss the leather (which I source locally), I embed the magnets in bookbinding board, and I assemble the covers right here at home. Here's a look at [my process](https://www.etsy.com/shop/MakeThingsBetter/about/) and [things I'm working on](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.490066031072133.1073741834.490032504408819&amp;type=3).

At first I just wanted them for me, but the process is kinda fun, and the initial effort would've been a bit of a waste for just a one-off, so I decided to put them [on Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/MakeThingsBetter). So, if anyone wants one, lemme know. I welcome any and all feedback.

PS  I'd also be happy to make them for non-Apple devices, though (since I don't own any) I've got to handle those on a per-request basis. I've made a few Android tablet covers and had good luck in the past.",13,11,False,self,,,,,

So Robb is at war with Joffrey. Which means Winterfell vs. Kings Landing? Or which other armies/places does Joffrey currently command now that he's king?

Which major holds are not involved in this war, that are worth keeping an eye on?

Now Daenerys commands a fraction of the Dothraki in the east. Now she has to watch out for the main Dothraki force, I presume. Are there any other major threats in the east?

There is just so much to say about this girl, and while I WANT to like her, she's quickly risen to the top of my list of characters I can't stand. 

She spent the better part of the series trying to find a way back to Westeros and re-take the Iron Throne. It was this drive of hers that instantly had us to loving her because we were led to believe that she would eventually be the heroine that brought peace and order back to the Iron Throne. 

She makes it through the desert, she survives the warlocks in Qarth, she FINALLY finds herself an army, and what does she do? Does she start looking for more ships and a way back to Westeros?  NO! She launches herself and all her resources into an idiotic conquest against slavery in Slaver's Bay, itself! 

At this point I'm thinking to myself, *Ok, she's going to carve herself a bloody path back to Westeros.* NOPE! She sets up shop in Meereen and spits in Daxo's face when he offers her ships to take her and her entire army to Westeros. Now that she's in Meereen, she soon finds herself surrounded by enemies on every side and ruling over a people who want her dead. SURPRISE, SURPRISE!!

She refuses to honor the pact her family had with the Martels, and instead of going for the option that would have given her all of the spears in Dorne, she decides to ""do what's best for Meereen."" She marries the rat, Hizdahr, who turns around and tries to poison her in the very next chapter. SURPRISE, SURPRISE!! DANNY! Did you ever stop to seriously think that maybe the best thing for these people is for you to just pack your bags and get the fuck out?! This isn't her war! These aren't her people!

What gets me is that despite the fact that there have been many opportunities for her to get back on track with her original goals, she has refused them all and instead chosen to sink into this quagmire of shit in Slaver's Bay. On top of it all she bitches and moans and complains about how being a Queen isn't easy and how her path is always hidden from her. Exercise some common sense, woman! JEESUS!

Anyway, I'm just past the part where Drogon has carried her away. It's possible that her situation is now about to change drastically again, so I'll just have to wait and see. Thanks for bearing with me while I vent. What do you guys think about all of this?

I have been getting her Harry Potter merchandise for every holiday and other significant day, because it's a mutual love and I like the stuff as much if not more than she does. Anyway, I'm out of HP stuff to buy (seriously, it's a problem). Anyway, she has all the books and DVDs, so that angle won't work. I want it to be something of a worthy significance, but not something that's going to break the bank, although I'm pretty flexible on price.

Her and I became very close due to our affection toward the series so I figured this would be the best way to ask her to the dance.Now, there are a three things I'd like to mention beforehand:

1) I'm quite artistic, so constructing the card as well as designing it won't be a problem

2) I'm planning to give her the card in a boom-mic box with a rose in it as well (It's an inside joke between us) so If you can build on that, that'd be great!

3) Like I said before, I will be putting a rose in the box, but if I need to change that prop to go with the card, then that's fine

I think that's just about it... I can't wait to see what you guys can come up with!

And of course, I will be posting a picture of the project and the process of making it!
