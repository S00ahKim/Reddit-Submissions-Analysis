This theory will attempt to argue that Varys is actually the Last Lord Tarbeck, son of Rohanne Tarbeck and grandson of Ellyn Reyne. This theory also acts as a counter to the idea that Varys is either a Targaryen (as if there aren't enough of those in the show and books already) or a Blackfyre.

So, to begin with the Last Lord Tarbeck, the Tarbecks were a family who met the same fate as the Reynes of Castamere, the subject of the song, the Rains of Castamere. Ellyn, the last lords grandmother, was married to Tywin Lannister's uncle, Tion, and functionally became the Lady of Casterley Rock. However, when her husband died her influence waned, until she apparently attempted to have an affair with Tytos Lannister (Tywin's father) and she was quickly married off to House Tarbeck. During Tytos's time as Lord of Casterley Rock the Lannisters became more of a laughing stock, especially because of the rise of House Reyne in wealth and influence. This led to Tywin exterminating both House Reyne and Tarbeck, leading to the inspiration of the song, the Rains of Castamere. However, during her marriage into the Tarbeck family, Ellyn had three children and one grandson. They were all put to death, apparently, but the book, a World of Ice and Fire, states that the grandchild disappeared during the assault, and states that the child was brought to Essos and became a bard. However, what if this child was Lord Varys. I will now discuss some evidence from the show and books that may give strength to this argument:

1. Varys grew up an orphan in Essos and he appears to be roughly the right age to fit into these criteria.

2. Varys is a master of disguise, a trait that might have been instrumental to his survival.

3. In Season 3 of the show, Varys tells Shae he has no surname, this could arguably be because his family was entirely wiped out, rather than relating to his lowborn status.

4. The fact that Varys is referred to as 'Lord Varys' may foreshadow his status as a lord, as stated in Season 4, when Varys speaks to Oberyn.

5. Sticking with the same scene from Season 4, Varys says he does not bother with desire because of what it does to people and has done the country, this can imply two things: firstly, his allegiance to the Westeros; and secondly, it may refer to the desire of both House Reyne and Lannister in being the richest and most powerful which led to his famly's demise. 

6. His origin in Westeros may explain why he feels for strongly for Westeros but might also show his motivations for being in Westeros: Revenge.

7. We see Varys as a calm and cunning character, skills needed for the Master of Whisperers, this coolness allowed him to get his hands on the Sorcerer who made him the eunuch he is. Varys might also exercise the same cunning and patience in getting his revenge against the Lannisters, wiping out their entire line, just as Tywin ended his family.

8. The Mad King's paranoia has some of his origins in Varys, and we see Tywin losing his position as Hand-of-the-King, due to this paranoia. Perhaps this is a part of the revenge Varys wanted, humiliating Tywin. 
 
9. Varys views children as 'blameless' (Season 6) and employs them as his little-birds' to give them roles, this could highlight his own blamelessness in the Reyne-Tarbeck Rebellion which altered his entire life.

10. A plot-hole I had difficulty in understanding was the fact that Varys was involved in the assassination attempt on Daenerys in Season 1 and the first book. This seems very much against the theory that Varys is either a Targaryen or Blackfyre. However, this assassination attempt can make sense if Varys true loyalties don't lie with Targaryens (or Blackfyres), and he merely sees Daenerys as a means of removing the Lannisters from power.

11. Following on from 10, Varys uses his place on the Small council to humiliate Tywin might be seen as a reason for Varys' current loyalty to the Targaryens: guilt. He views his selfishness as a key reason why the Targaryens fell from power and the realm fell into disarray.

12. Varys lack of loyalty to the Tyrrells may also convey his lack of direct loyalty to the Targaryens. The Tyrrells were one of the few great houses that sided with the Targaryens during Robert's Rebellion and Varys would be aware that their loyalty only really changed to the Baratheons after the Targaryens lost, out of self-preservation. However, Varys's masterplan, in the Epilogue of a Dance of Dragons, seems to hang on the Lannisters and Tyrrells destroying each other. Varys would more likely use the Tyrells rather than sacrifice them if he had loyalty or sympathy for them.

13. Varys stating, 'they sing no songs for Spiders' might refer to his omission from the song, the Rains of Castamere.

14. Varys allegiance with Tyrion may be Varys icing of the cake as he works with a member of the Lannister family to take the Lannisters down, also Varys speaking against Tyrion at his trial might have acted as adding to his humiliation of the Lannisters.

15. Varys saying, 'I've always hated the bells, they ring for horror, a dead king, a city under siege...' (in Season 2). This might be a reference to his earliest memory of House Tarbeck being under siege. The dead king may highlight his guilt over Aerys II's death and the Sacking of King's Landing, an event that heightened Tywins power.

These are some of the pieces of evidence that might support the idea that Varys was born of a marriage between House Tarbeck and House Reyne, and his character arc focusing on getting vengeance for his dead family. 

Another related theory attached to this one: the quick marriage between Ellyn and Lord Tarbeck might also imply Ellyn was pregnant with Rohanne, who in this theory is Varys' mother, due to the affair with Tytos, potentially making Varys a Lannister bastard       ",18,47,False,self,,,,,

Here are in my opinion the biggest cons in game of thrones:
1) The recasting of the mountain numerous times
2) The recasting of daario nahar ( Leader of the second sons) sorry if i spelt wrong
3) Sam and Gilly storyline very dull and boring imo


Pros:
1) amazing storylines (my favourite being Jon Snows story line)
2)Very good quality show all around (Ex good effects good acting...)
3) lots of content 

I would recommend to game of thrones a lot and is one of my favourite shows

As good as the show is this is INEXCUSABLE.

We'll start with the most egregious.

What they did to King Stannis is disgusting. It made absolutely no sense. He would NOT burn his daughter, he would NOT be as stupid as they made him look. This is a guy who is a military genius and the most honorable man in the Seven Kingdoms. A fitting death for a character as great as this(if he had to die) would be against the White Walkers fighting with Jon and co., but nope....they never liked him and they wanted to ruin the character, and then having stupid Brienne kill him and saying his brother was the rightful King. No, his brother was NOT the rightful King. It's why the Seven Kingdoms have that harlot Cersei sitting on the throne now. 

Secondly, they killed Ser Barristan in an idiotic way. Like he'd be prancing around the city at such a dangerous time and not even wearing his full armor of course. He had plenty of more story to tell and they just get rid of him probably to make more room for Tyrion. 

Finally, it was totally unnecessary to kill The Blackfish. The honorable thing for him to do would be to go and help the rest of his family, not die after killing like two guys(which of course we couldn't even see).... a great character who returns just to ruin him.",35,0,False,self,,,,,

I know that in the first few episodes after Bran falls out of the tower Ol' Nan tells him of the ""Long Night."" Which according to her, was a winter that occurred a thousand years before the setting of the show. She said that the winter lasted a century, and during that time the whitewalkers emerged to terrorize people.   

Now I also vaguely remember something about the Targaryen conquest happening roughly a millennia early than the show setting as well. Is this true?

If so, my question is did the Targaryen's successfully conquer westeros because the realm had already been weakened by the whitewalkers? Did the Targaryen's vanquish the whitewalkers?

North: Moat Cailin prevented land invasions from the south. Invading the capital during winter is impossible since Winterfell is warm while it's surrounding area is extremely cold and lifeless. Even though it's population is low, the fighting men are extremely fierce and tough due to harsh conditions not to mention they are unified under the Starks for necessity of surviving the winters. This makes them much more loyal to their rulers than other regions, which helps greatly when facing wildlings, ironborn and southron regions constantly. 

Vale: Mountainous region provides natural fortification. Loyalty to Arryns bound by honor. Most militarily discipline army in Westeros. It's capital is impregnable. 

Westerlands: Extremely rich due to numerous amounts of gold which allows for best military equipment and adequate supplies of food. It's capital is almost impossible to take. 

Reach: Most fertile land which gives the Gardeners the biggest army. Large navy from Redvynes. Wealth from trading food and arbor gold allows for well equipped army. Men aren't as tough as Stormlanders or Northerners. 

Riverlands and Iron islands: Ironborn have the most powerful naval force.

Stormlands: It's capital is mighty and can withstand any storm. The harsh lands breed tough men. 

Dorne: Isolated and extremely hot region. It's deserts and unfamiliarity allows for the Dornish to beat back bigger armies using guerrilla tactics. Creative use of resources such as poison.

I'm re-watching the series and as someone who hasn't read through all the books yet, I'm left wondering about one thing.

Over the course of the show at least, Daenerys develops from a pretty well relatable character into an increasingly unsympathetic one. Now of course there's actual plot points that have an effect on this, but some of it could be acting-related.  

Every now and then I've seen people mention they're unhappy with Clarke, but I haven't delved any further into that, so I really don't know whether they generally just don't like her acting or if it's a novel vs. show issue. Is it due to Emilia Clarke's portrayal of the role (which *seems* pretty exaggerated to me, but then again I don't know the later books) or is Daenerys acting more and more agitated and, uh... questionable something that's the same in the source material?

TL;DR: I have difficulty telling whether the show wants me to root for Daenerys or not.

The scene where she kills Walder Frey is one of my favorite of the series. To finally see the power she posses and strength she has learned is chilling. Not to mention, everyone thinks she is dead.

Maybe he's not.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/5m02zq/everything_think_benjen_stark_is_just_benjen/,Danth720,1483547586,"Could Benjen Stark be more or possibly even someone completely different then Benjen Stark? I tend to think so. I think Benjen could have a different identity entirely. 

First Lets take in a couple different facts. When we first see Benjen he is visiting Winterfell and his ""Brother's"" family. He hugs Ned but then do we see him chummy with Robb? No. 
Do we see him chummy with Bran? No. 
Do we see him chummy with Sansa? No. You get the point. 

We see him spending his precious time and his words with Jon Snow. Talking to him about having women and sons and how that is all gone if he joins the Night's Watch. He also doesn't fight it too hard to keep Jon from coming to the wall. 

Now we jump to the fact that Benjen is Cold Hands confirmed in the show. The Children of the forest imply that Cold Hands has been around a lot longer than Benjen has been gone. Which Makes it strange that Benjen can be normal in Winterfell and normal at the wall and then gone for a while and then Cold Hands. Unless Cold Hands is a change in his appearance that he can change. Perhaps, its a change in appearance in between one disguise to his real identity, Rhaegar Targaryen. 

So now it out there, here is the timeline and how it happened:
Rhaegar at the Battle of the Trident dressed up a similar looking man in his gear and that man died while Rhaegar lived on. But this couldn't be known so he had to hide. Before heading North of the wall he went to the Tower of Joy to see his beloved and his son Jon Snow but Ned was already there and taking the child to look after it. 

North of the Wall Rhaegar disguised himself as Cold Hands and when the opportunity presented itself he killed Benjen to disguise himself as Benjen to get to his son Jon. Once at the wall he had to disappear again so Jon wouldn't find out he wasn't his Uncle. He then Helped Bran because the three-eyed raven told him that Bran was the only hope to survive the white walkers. 

TL;DR
Benjen Stark is actually Rhaegar Targaryen

After finishing season 4, I found myself thinking about how great The Eyrie &amp; The Bloody Gate would be for the war to come. In S4E5, Littlefinger &amp; Sansa approach The Bloody Gate on the way to the Eyrie. Sansa asks him ""Is this the only way into the Eyrie?"" He tells her ""The mountains are impassable. If you want to get to the Eyrie, you have to go through The Bloody Gate. It doesn't matter how large your army is. If you attack this gate, you do it on this road, 3 men abreast and get slaughtered like goats"" This would make the numbers in the Night's King army count for nothing. ""Know your strengths, use them wisely and one man can be worth 10,000."" Littlefinger is a very smart man, I believe he will urge Jon or whomever that The Eyrie would be the best place to defend against whats to come. Let's assume the Wall somehow comes down, and the white walkers roll over everything they come across. Fighting them out in the open is something none of them would want to do. Forcing them into the cliffs, on to the road in front of The Bloody Gates would be a prime spot to hold. It would also be a real easy target for Dany's dragons to make passes over top, lighting anything on the road to a smoldering pile of ash.

If a story didn't have 'plot armor' it'd be boring as all hell.

Do you really want everyone you care about dead, so the story can just end, and evil will win and that's it? Bleak, anticlimactic, sudden end. Really?

If you think GoT has 'plot armor' you must find just about any other show/book/story of any kind absolutely unbearable to watch.. Just because a character is still alive doesn't mean they've been saved by 'plot armor' and even if they are, who cares? The show is still extremely unpredictable and treacherous for everyone in it, and it'd be a TERRIBLE story if everyone died as unceremoniously as, say, most of the deaths in the show. Is that really what you want? No.

Basically, plot armor exists in every story ever told. It's far less prevalent in GoT than any story I've ever read or seen, yet people still complain about it constantly. Your thoughts?",26,24,False,self,,,,,

Now to get to my thoughts and theories behind the upcoming season.

I hope to see Arya heading to Winterfell and we get a long awaited reunion between the family. Since she is heading from the Riverlands we can maybe get her to at least get a glimpse of Nymeria along the way.

Brienne and Podrick should appear at Winterfell as well, which we may get some more Tormund loves Brienne humor.

Edmure should finally be a free man and hopefully redeem himself for his surrender to Jaime and give his banner support to Jon once he retakes Riverrun.

I'm not sure if we will see anymore of Melisandre this season but if so maybe she runs into the Brotherhood without Banners and joins them, I feel we aren't done with her, she said she would be needed for the Great War still to come, so I feel she was allowed to live until she will be of use later.

I'm really not sure what direction they will go with Sam's story. Other than maybe discovering some methods to stop the White Walkers, this season I can really see him having limited screen time, other than if his father either comes with fury for stealing the sword or maybe some respect for having the balls to take it in the first place.

We will finally see Dany arrive in Westeros. I think we will maybe see the battle with the iron born first to fulfill her part of the bargain before the larger battle. Maybe once that is done we will actually get to see Casterly Rock as their invasion point. I also would eventually like to see Highgarden. As all guess I see her making an alliance with Jon. Since he is part Targaryen it would allow him to be the second dragon rider and also help fulfill his prophecy of being the Prince who was promised. Now at some point I expect maybe one dragon to die, but they still need a third dragon rider and I'll get to that later.

As for Jon himself, beside the Dany situation. I expect to see either Sansa conflicting with her feelings of being in charge or protecting him from Littlefinger. Who I think needs to die by season end. Perhaps he will try to wed Cersei in exchange for betraying Jon and it will backfire. More Davos and Lyanna will be great. Also Jon will probably find out about his true parentage. Perhaps because of Howland Reed showing up?

I think the Lannister emblem will be on King's Landing at opening from now on. Speaking of King's Landing. I think this will be Cersei's last season. I can really only see two options as to who will kill her. In an excerpt from the book that was omitted in the show, when Cersei met the witch as a young girl, she said the valonqar (or little brother) would strangle her. Now that to me only leaves Tyrion (which is why she always also hated him) who would be a satisfying watch to kill Cersei, but the other and more who I think likely is Jamie. First off he is technically her younger brother as she came first. But lets look at some other points, he killed the Mad King for threatening to do exactly what she just did in the season finale but furthermore, in a small part in S5 when Jamie and Bronn are talking about death Jamie says he'd like to die in the arms of the woman he loves. I think this was a small foreshadow to him killing Cersei and she stabs him back and they die in each other's embrace, a poetic end as they came into the world together and together they shall depart. Most likely she will have some way of provoking him into seeing no other way. Maybe killing Brienne with a whole lot of other innocents or something.

I really do pray at some point Clegane-bowl will happen and we will see The Hound defeat The Mountain.

Now for one of my favorite theories. I think not only we will see the long awaited return of Gendry. But he will either rally the Stormlands and be another powerful bastard, or since he technically has Robert's blood, which does have some Targaryen in there, he will become the third dragon rider. Why else would they have left him alive and kept him in the back pocket so long. He must have a pivotal role eventually. (another less likely theory is that Tyrion is a Targaryen as well, that the reason Tywin left being Hand of the King to Aerys was because he raped or seduced his wife Joanna and since he couldn't prove Tyrion isn't his he raised him as Lannister, Targaryen's do have a reputation of killing their mothers upon birth and it could explain his hatred of Tyrion)

As for the Wall, I think Bran will end the magic that keeps out the dead when he crosses the barrier. Since the Night King touched him and left that mark, he is able to cross the barriers made by the Children. I think the final episode we will see Bran cross and the Wall start to crack.

So these are pretty much my thoughts on what will happen this upcoming season. Let me know what you think or agree/disagree with.",6,10,False,self,,,,,

However, now that most of the wars / battles are done, what is their goal?

As we know from the TV show, they recruit Sandor, stating a few times that the Gods aren't done with him just yet. 

Do they know of the White Walkers? Are they heading North to help defend the living?

Further, I am not an avid GoT theorist or up on all the details. Therefore, please be kind in your thoughts/criticisms. 

I believe I have heard it mentioned before that the Stark children are becoming familiar 'fantasy/ Dungeon and Dragons/ gaming' archetypes. Jon is the warrior, Arya is the rogue/assassin, and Bran is the wizard. If Martin did this on purpose, then it seems strange that Sansa does not seem to have an archetype; other than becoming more confident, unselfish (compared to her childhood), and more of a leader figure.

However, has anyone speculated or theorized that Sansa will become another archetype: the healer? Has anyone previously theorized that she will become a priest of the Lord of Light. Anecdotally, she has red hair and the lord of light is also known as the red god. Melisandre  is going south, perhaps she runs into Sansa and helps Sansa discover her powers.

While doing my annual rewatching of all the seasons, there's a huge plot hole regarding Stannis, the North, and Jon's attack on Winterfell.

So when Stannis comes down to make his siege on Winterfell, he's in bad shape. The horses are dying, the men are sick, and they're buried under a ton of snow, so Stannis decides to burn Shireen. This has the desired effect of melting the snow...along with half of Stannis' forces deserting and his wife hanging herself, but I digress.

Fast forward to Battle Of The Bastards. Jon and his armies are camped near Winterfell. Close enough to where Jon and his advisers were able to parlay with Ramsay, make it back to camp that night, have their war council, and be arrayed for battle the next morning at close enough to first light.

How far away was Jon's camp from the battlefield at Winterfell? Only a few miles? Certainly only a few hours march at most.

Rewatching the episode however, Davos comes across Shireen's funeral pyre a few hundred feet outside of camp. This means Jon camped in the same place Stannis did.

So basically, Stannis burned his daughter while only a few miles from Winterfell. What gives? Was he so far gone mentally that he thought it was justified? Did he not know how close he was to Winterfell?

I will leave a link to all four parts down here:

Part 4: https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/5jftil/everything_the_battle_for_kings_landing_part_4/

Now i did the last part of Battle for KL 16 days ago so i think that is a good time from then to now to do this. I know i am making these predictions too early but first of all people are already making predictions for the end game before season 7 so yeah. Secondly i had alot of fun making the last one so i decided after feedback from one fan (which of whom i will not name but this is a shot out to him) i would do Battle for the Dawn next. Now for a Recap Dany wins the battle with the Mountain, Daario, Randall, Euron, Illyn Payne, Qyburn, and Cersei all die either before or after the battle. But there were cost as Bronn, Missendei, The Hound, A Good amount of small folk Resistance, Davos, Brienne, Nymeria, Elliaria, Obara, Tyrene, Viserion, Drogon, And Arya Stark (now for the predictions i had Arya either lives or dies and had Grey worm either lives or dies and showed the outcome for both characters well outcomes. But to make things easier i'm going with that Grey Worm lived and Arya died). However in the end Dany was crowned queen with her new dragon by her side. Illyrio is master of coin, Varys is Master of Whisperers, Yara is master of ships and Queen of the Iron Islands, Surella gets a raven saying she is legitimized and lady of Dorne, Olenna is lady of Highgarden until death, Grey Worm is commander of the city watch, Jorah is head of queensguard, and Gendry is made lord of Storm's end. Now i got that out of the way let's get into the action:

Dany declares as her first action as queen that the realms will be divided into four independent kingdoms. The Kingdom of the North (made up of the north, the vale, the riverlands, and The Neck), The kingdom of the Iron Islands (made up of what else the Iron islands), The Kingdom of Dorne (made up of Dorne....and that's it), and The 4 kingdoms (the Crownlands, the westerlands, The Storm lands, and Highgarden). team Dany celebrate the victory with a feast and and party but one is not pleased. Jon Snow who confronts Dany telling her during the battle she saw her dragons and soldiers not only kill soldiers but also Dozens of Innocent people and saw the rubble of peoples homes.

Finally and most maddeningly Jon blames her for Arya's death saying that if she had not forced the Baratheon boy to be Betrother to her his sister would have not been compelled to come to KL and his little sister the one who has been threw enough would still be alive (yes i waited for now to reveal Dany betrothed Gendry to herself because at this moment in the story it would be a twist. The reason was Dany to avoid another Rebellion decided to marry Robert's last son mirroring how the real life war of Roses ended).

Dany explains that first of all his sister would've never had come if he had not sent a Raven before the meeting that took place before the battle so it is his fault as well, And secondly it is called war for a reason and those are the consequences people die. But Jon thinks not in the way she thinks so Jon with anger storms out of the feast hall but before he does he tells her that you should care about the casualties still as the people will not see you as a hero if you don't and to think about what he said. The next morning Jon along with Howland, Pod, Ghost, Sam, Marwyn, Jaime, and Gilly and Little Sam (who they found in the end of the battle locked up in one of the Tarly ships) pack up on a ship with three funeral casket (Davos, Brienne, and Arya) Tyrion, Jorah, Gendry, and Varys tag along to attend the Funeral.

The Priest (still played by Mads Mikkelsen) Stops them demanding that the girl gets a funeral of the faith of the seven for her contributions for the resistance. However Gendry slaps him in the face to snap him out of it telling him she was a stark she is getting a northern funeral. The Priest let's them through. As the northerners leave Dany thinks about what Jon said. That same day Dany goes to her people and stats her next act as queen is that a stone Panel of the names lost in the Battle for king's landing and the burning of the sept would be put inside the new Sept of Baelor and that a funeral would be held for those who dead and her Dragon Drogon.

Later Jorah realizes that Dany is pregnant with Daario's bastard child and that the child may not make it. Dany also finds the ingredients that where used to bring back the Mountain and to create Ageonion she asks Kinevara if this could be done to bring back Khal Drogo. She says yes but then Dany decides not to as she decides she must move on and then ask her if she knows any type of magic could be used to help her unborn child survive the Birth.

Meanwhile Jon and co. make it back with Sansa and Bran expecting there sister only to find three caskets. With bran quickly realizing the third was Arya's. Sansa ask Bran what's wrong Bran tells her who is in the third casket and Sansa starts to cry and is in disgust to see Jaime there though Jon explains why Jaime is with them. That night the Northern Funeral is held for Davos, Brienne, and Arya. Bran, Jon, and Sansa cry as there sister is dead, Tyrion and Jaime show there respects, so does Jorah and Varys, Gendry devastated puts a blue winter rose on her casket (mirroring when Rhaegar gave Lyanna the blue winter rose at the tourney), in a surprise Dany comes to the funeral and pays respects to the three, and at the end Davos remains are send back to House Seaworth, Brienne's remains are send back to tarth, and Arya is put in the crypts next to her father.

As the funeral ends Dany flies on Ageonion back to KL (with Tyrion some how getting control of Rhaegal and riding with her back with Jaime on the back of Rhaegal with Tyrion). They go to The funeral Pyre of Drogon at the dragonspit where a ritual will happen where Dany's child with Daario will be born in fire. She goes into the fire and screams of her giving birth are heard Jaime worried rushes in and in a shocking twist.....Dany AND Jaime with Dany's born child born in fire come out untouched even Jaime.

Coming out of the fire is a beautiful healthy boy. Jaime explains to Tyrion that they and Cersei are the bastard children of the mad king Areys Targaryen. Jaime knows this because before Areys dead Areys whispered to Jaime the truth. Tyrion at first is angered but is calmed and hugs his brother Jaime rides back with Dany on Ageonion to the north where Jaime is excepted to go to the wall to take the Black. Dany drops off Jaime then flies back to her kingdom Jaime before getting slapped by Sansa makes his way to the wall accompanied by Thoros and Beric (Varys and Gendry have returned to KL at this point by the way).

Meanwhile Dany informs Gendry he can marry whoever he wants. Gendry still sad over Arya and Davos death is then jeered up by Tyrion when he finally finishes that joke from last season. Anyways at the wall the white walkers come with the head of Benjen Stark and The Night King touches the wall and suddenly the wall starts to shack and the wall crumbles and falls. With the Brotherhood and the night's watch getting killed and Thoros and Jaime barely making it out alive. Jaime and Thoros inform king Jon of what has happened. Jon knowing what is coming informs Bran to try and figure out where the others are now. Then he informs the other northern lords, Thoros, and Jaime to get ready. Jon then goes to the crypts to try and find some clues to how he can stop the white walkers. 

Jon finds something. He finds a dragon under the crypts the dragon shots fire at Jon and Jon is unburned (the reason he is fire proof now is that his resurrection unlocked this ability). Anyways Jon takes out the dragon from the crypts with everyone shocked. Jon sends Dany a Raven that it is time and Dany flies Ageonion with her armies by her side, Gendry and his armies, Yara and her armies, Tyrion and the Clansmen, and the House Tarly forces (highgarden and dorne stay behind on this one) go to help fight the war with Tyrion riding Rhaegal by the way.

Jon is offered the dragon he found but refuses it as he would rather stick to his stark roots. So Jaime takes the dragon and names it Tytos after his grandfather. So Jon with the north, the wildlings, Howland's army, and the Knight's of the vale. Along with all of Dany's forces go up against the white walkers with Dany riding Ageonion, Tyrion riding Rhaegal, and Jaime riding the new dragon Tytos.

Now if some of this is confusing then go read the Battle for KL predictions first. Also sorry if this seems to fan fictiony but i hope you like it  also for no battle but this what i think will happen before the battle so be ready for part 2. Also if you want to see the outcome for if Arya lives and Grey Worm dies let me know.  ",3,0,False,self,,,,,

Honour.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/5mg3v8/s1e9_ned_stark_family_duty_honour/,admralfie,1483735983,"Here's something people dont think about. The Tully words are ""Family. Duty. Honour."" - family comes first, as Bran so poignantly pointed out in Season 1. 
As the season progresses, I realised just how much these words affected Ned, a man of honour. Many fans are questioning his honour at the moment after the revealing death of Ser Arthur Dayne, and I have my own theories on that. 

I think Ned has been bending the truth around this event; much like has with Jon Snow. I believe he has been careful not to lie about the fight, because ultimately he *did* kill Ser Arthur. Perhaps he left out the details of the fight when retelling the story, making people come up with their own interpretations, and because he is a man of honour then people just assume he beat him in fair, single combat. 

This can also be applied to Jon as early as S1E2 - ""You may not have my name, but you have my blood."" Again, he's not lying, they do share blood, he's just allowing people to interpret this as they want. The only possible source of outright lying I believe we see from Ned is when he's discussing Wylla, the wench he apparently slept with during the rebellion, ""Your bastard's mother,"" Robert says. He's only lying because has to, to protect his family, to honour the promise he made to his sister. Then again, maybe he really did sleep with Wylla, Robert seems to think so, and Ned's reaction was rather convincing of a sore, dishonourable act. Maybe

However, whichever theories you follow or believe I think it's clear that the Ned we know at the start of the story is the honourable man we believe him to be. 
As we go through the story, we start to see Ned get pushed out of his comfort zone by the politics of King's Landing, and this brings me to my main point.
 Family. Duty. Honour

People don't seem to notice this. Ned tries to act with Honour, Varys knows him to be ""one of the few men of honour left in the city"". It's interesting to see Ned eventually put aside his honour towards the end of his life, choosing this dishonourable path presented by Littlefinger to pay the Goldcloaks in the name of Duty - putting the rightful heir on the throne. Duty comes before honour.

Of course, this backfires, and perhaps he should have known better but latter we see Ned presented with another choice of options, this time by Varys. Does he stand by his word and his duty, to denounce Joffrey and the Lannisters? Or does he proclaim him as the rightful heir in order to protect his family?

Ned chooses his Family. Family comes before duty. It was only Joffrey's unpredictable actions that caused Ned's death. Otherwise, I think most people would agree that he would have happily gone to the Wall to be with Jon.

Family. Duty. Honour.

Ned lived and died by these words. Take from that what you will, there could be a lot of discussion about it, but I find it amazing, and heart warming, to see that the Tully words of his wife's family affected Ned in such a great way, to do such acts for the sake of his family, even if it did mean making the ultimate sacrifice.

Forward to season 5 finale, Jon is killed by the traitors on account of his actions as Lord Commander. (This is where theorizing begins). Maybe Jon meets Ned in the ""next world"" and this is where they discuss Jon's mother (which we now know to be Lyanna Stark, and his father to be Rhaegar Targaryen). When Jon is resurrected by the Red Woman, he is asked what he saw, but he says ""nothing""; however, he may only say this so he doesn't draw to much attention.

(SHOW),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/5mms1d/everything_what_did_arya_think_of_tywin_at_the/,HEV_tux,1483823060,"As two of my favorite characters, I find the interactions between Arya and Tywin to be very interesting. I have been told this did not occur in the novels so everything I mention here will be about the HBO show.

What does everybody think Arya's opinion of Tywin was at the end of their time together? It is never really explicitly stated how she feels about him and he doesn't make it on her list.

Obviously Arya knows Tywin is related to two of the people on her list, and at first she wanted him dead. She considered killing him with the knife early on (probably would have if she had more time to think about it) but as season 2 progresses she seems to find him at the very least interesting.

I personally think she doesn't LIKE him per se, but she respects him and doesn't hate him as much as the other Lannisters (or other people in general) because she sees a lot of herself in him, and maybe even sees him as a bit of a much needed father figure who represents the harsh new nature of reality she has been introduced to. Tywin is a man who does what needs to be done to protect his family, and that is very similar to where Arya finds herself.

A few moments to support my theory:

1: When Tywin says ""perhaps you should devise our next battle plan while your at it"" she gets a sort girly smile almost like she got complimented by a father. This could be partially ""hah, I am smarter than lannister commanders"" but it still came from Tywin.

2: She shows interest in Tywin's father.

3: She seems to enjoy listening to him. Her general attitude towards him seems to be not hatred or contempt but curiosity (not that the two are mutually exclusive.

4: He treats her with far more respect than most people. Up to that point in the show most people (even her fellow Starks) treated her as ""just a girl"" which we know she hates. Only Syrio ever treated her as a person first and a girl second and saw potential in her. Tywin also does this, he respects her intellect and does not demean her unnecessarily just because she is a female, nor does he treat her like a soft and delicate flower ""careful, I enjoy you but be careful"" and just the general way he orders her as his cup bearer.

4.5: Tywin also openly complements her older brother on his battle prowess, he isn't afraid to admit the truth. He isn't afraid to talk shit about Lannisters. I think this shades of grey attitude is new and fascinating to Arya.

5: She uses one of her free Jaquen kills to kill the man who is about to tell him something rather than to kill Tywin himself. This is a small point, I am sure there are other reasons she for this, some have said she feared killing Tywin would mean Sansa's death, etc.

I think Tywin sees her as the kin he always wanted. Someone who is interested in history and cunning. Especially the way he says ""Correct! a student of history are you?"" after she knows about the dragon riders.

Would love to hear other peoples opinions on this, I feel it's one the most interesting relationships in the show next to Jaime/Brienne and Arya/Sandor.

We first meet Rickon at Winterfell, a very young boy who's about 9 or so (I think 4 or 5 in the books?). He's younger than Robb and Bran so there's not too much hope for him to somehow become Lord of Winterfell. Well, when Bran falls into a coma and is now paralyzed from the waist down, it would be hard for him to have children. This would technically make Bran out of the line of succession. Good thing Robb is alive and well! Oh. 

So when Theon takes over Winterfall and Bran and Rickon are forced to travel north of the Wall to find the Bloodraven, Robb's death kind of makes Rickon Lord of Winterfell. Bran sees the danger and sends off the lordling with Osha to Last Hearth for protection with the Umbers. 

Smalljon Umber betrays the Starks and turns in Rickon to the Boltons. Well this is Season 6, characters that have been destined for greatness have been all done being killed off, right? 

Rickon gets an arrow through the chest and Sansa is the only confirmed legitimate Stark still alive to the knowledge of the people of Westeros. And she doesn't even inherit Winterfell.

I know this isn't particularly a new theory, but I believe it is much more believable than the Blackfyre or Targeryan theories. 

So here's the theory - Varys is a Reyne. And not just a Reyne, but the youngest and only surviving son of The Lord of Castamere who rebelled against the Lannisters. 

Proof - 
1. His age - The Reyne rebellion occurred in 261AL and the year that is ongoing in season 6 is 303AL. Varys is easily in his late 40s or early 50s right now. Maybe he was smuggled away from the castle of Castamere when the news of Tywin marching first came. We know that House Reyne wasn't the only house in the westerlands unhappy with Tytos. 

2. Tyrion's escape - There is no way in the world that Varys helped Tyrion escape his captivity just because Jaime asked him to do so. And Varys has always been loyal to Tyrion. Why? Because Tyrion hated Tywin. 

3. Varys and Olenna - Varys tried as much as he could to create a strong bond with the Queen of Thornes because he knew it would come handy later on if he were to ever turn against the Lannisters. 

4. Varys escaping with Tyrion - Varys wasn't supposed to go with tyrion but when he hears the bells he realises what tyrion has done and so his work in Westeros is done for now. 

5. His bald head - It is very possible that Varys is bald by choice in order to avoid suspicion because the genetic features of specific houses are very easy to point out. 

6. I'm not a lord - I think the reason he says this line to Oberyn is because his surname has virtually lost all meaning and even though he should be called lord, he doesn't like because his family has lost its status. 

7. Jaime's induction into the Kingsguard - Jaime was inducted into the Kingsguard in 281 AL by Aerys for humiliating Tywin. Varys entered the service of Aerys in 280AL. 


It all adds up. Varys's hatred for Tywin. His skills in disguise. His younger years as a poor kid, being sold into slavery, it was all to keep him alive. Similar to the way Ned did everything to keep Jon alive. 

I think that this is honestly much better than him being a blackfyre or a targeryan because the whole blackfyre theory doesn't really add to the storytelling (IMO) and the Targeryan one is just bland and predictable.

Also Brandon the Shipwright, an early King in the North, tried to found new land in the West and sailed to the West but was never seen again.

But maybe he found sth. and just decided to stay there. Maybe he is sth. like Christopher Columbus and explored a new world and founded a new dynasty there?

So I dont think it will ever been showen in the books and specially not in the series. But its interesting to think about and maybe another opportunity for a spin off?

This doesn't make sense to me because Rodrik Greyjoy, Balon's eldest son, was killed at Seagard by Jason Mallister in a previous encounter. How did Balon lose 3 sons that day? Who is the third? 
It is known that Maron died when the tower fell on him and Theon was taken ward of Ned Stark.

I once thought he's an archer. Killing the Tickler from the top (assuming) and killing Amory Lorch through arrow (assuming) again. He also did kill the guards for Arya's final name(s) and let's assume he did that through archery again.

Now, Arya trained to become a faceless man. Jaqen said he successfully became a No One. Never in her training we get to see her hold a bow or anything similar. What we knew is she uses different faces to get close to her targets. Deadly but not satisfying knowing the faceless men are feared in Braavos.

The Waif is shown to be good in hand to hand combat but with Arya's training, Arya turned to be better. So if the Waif is a legit faceless man, then they're not really that good at all.

Yara and her Ironborn fleet and Gendry and his storm lands fleet decide to have a surprise attack by attacking the others from the side by sailing beyond the ruined wall to the land always winter. When they get there they see thousands of wights and they realise they may not win. But fortunately they still have some wildfire that was used for Euron's Balistae so they use some more wildfire laced bolts to fight off the wights. They run out but they killed enough to the point where the rest should not a problem. Yara, Gendry, and there men kill the remaining wights using fire laced arrows and crossbow bolts they also fight some of the white walkers using Arrows and Crossbow bolts with dragonglass and also Valaryian steel swords found in the armoury of Dragonstone.

Meanwhile back in King's Landing Mads Mikkelsen's priest goes to find Kinevara and get her to help evacuate everyone just in case the white walkers get to KL. However when she finds her she has hung herself and left a note. Mads Mikkelsen's priest opens the note and is shocked by what he reads. He races as fast as to get everyone evacuated to Highgarden in time just in case the others make it to KL and also needs to hurry so he can take a ship to the north to reveal the shocking content of the note.

Back at the area where Yara and Gendry were fighting the others the battle was starting to get heavy as Ironborn, Others, and Stormlands soldiers were getting killed left and right and Gendry's warhammer is destroyed by an other and Gendry is about to die when Yara comes in a stabs it in the back with a piece of dragonglass in the head. Gendry sad over his warhammer being destroyed Yara convinces him to move on. a reinforcement of Wights come in and the armies try to fight them off with fire Arrow and Crossobow bolts but it is still too much and Yara and Gendry are forced to fall back with whatever is left of there fleets and as they are leaving a Ice Dragon comes in and destroys a good handful of the Ironborn ships and Stormlands ships. But Yara uses once last Bolt on the Balistae and use the last of Euron's wildfire to lace it and kills the Ice Dragon. With only a small amount of Ironborn and Storm lands ships left they have no choice but to fall back with Gendry sad wishing that he had dead and not Arya but Yara soon convinces him that what is in the past is done she is gone there is nothing he can do about it and right now what they need to worry about and that is getting to where the main army is and helping them wall Yara and her remaining fleet return to KL to help evacuate everyone. Gendry and his fleet go to where everyone else is wall Yara and her remaining fleet heads to KL to help everyone evacuate just in case the white walkers make it that far.

Meanwhile at the main battle Jon and his armies along with The Knights of the Vale, The Clansmen of the vale, The Tarly forces, The Westerlands forces, and Danys forces fight the Others and wights on the ground using Fire arrows and Crossbow bolts for the wights and Dragonglass and valaryian steel for the others. And Dany, Tyrion, and Jaime burning a majority of the wights from below to help the armies on the ground. The battle is brutal as Tormund is overpowered by a pack of Wights, Most of the Dothraki are killed by Wights and/or Others, and Jon's direwolf Ghost gets his head torn off by the night king. Jon in a fit of rage attacks the Night king the two fight but the night king comes on top and throws Jon off the hill where they were fighting but fortunately for Jon he survived the fall. dickon Tarly ends up being killed by a white walker but Grey Worm comes in and kills the Other that killed him then puts Dickon's corpse on fire to prevent him from turning.

Then the Night king awakens an Ice dragon and hops on it and flies to where Dany, Tyrion, and Jaime are and when Jon realises this he gets all the armies to fall back immediately as they are outnumbered. Jon's forces, The Knights of the vale, Timett and whatever is left of his clansmen, The Westerlands forces, and whatever is left of the Dothraki forces and some of the Tarly soldiers fall back wall the Unsullied and the Other Tarly soldiers choose to stay and would them off. Howland and his men also choose to stay and hold them off and Howland Reed dies a heroic death killing a crap tone of others then Howland puts himself on fire to avoid turning into a wight. Jon arrives at Winterfell where Sansa, Gilly, Meera, Sam, Marwyn, and Lyanna are keeping the woman and children safe and Bran is at the tree warged into Rhaegal to help Tyrion control him. Jon informs Sansa to get everyone to retreat to the Riverlands (The Knights of the vale and Timett and his clansmen have retreated to well the vale and the westerlands forces retreat to well you know) and that they need to get everyone out of here. Sansa then takes Jon's orders and her, Gilly, and Lyanna with help from some of the northern soldiers and the Dothraki get the women and children out of the north and south the Riverlands safely where everyone will regroup.

The Others make there way to Winterfell wall this is happening Grey worm is killed by A pack an other and The remaining Unsullied have no choice but to retreat Jorah and Thoros retreat with them aswell. Jorah tries to convince the Tarly, Hornwood, and Umber soldiers that stayed to retreat with them but they refuse as they need to stand and defend there home. Jorah and Thoros have no choice but to leave with the remaining Unsullied, Mormont forces that stayed, and the Manderly forces that stayed. Meanwhile Dany on Ageonion fights the night king on his ice dragon wall Jaime on Tytos fights the wights from above only for the dragon Tytos to be overpowered by a Storm of Wights and Jaime barely making it out alive and jumps on Tyrions dragon Rhaegal. 

Dany and The Night King fight in the sky and in one last blow Ageonion blows his fire into the dragons mouth and kills the Night King's ice dragon only for Aegonion to fall to the ground and be overpowered by Wights and others Dany fortunately lands on Rhaegal which is what Jaime and Tyrion are riding on and they fly back to Winterfell with Dany heartbroken as she is forced to watch her dragon children die in front of her very eyes again. Meanwhile in Winterfell Thoros arrives and Marwyn the Mage gives Thoros ingredients to use a spell that can hold of the others so they can get the woman and children out in time so Thoros and Marwyn use this spell creating a fire wall of sorts keeping the others from getting any closer. Wall this is happening Mads Mikkelsen's priest sees that Yara and the remaining Ironborn have arrived he informs her to make sure that Dany's child and the people of the city get to Highgarden safely. he also explains he must get north to inform the armies of his shocking discovery.

Part 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/5mz5vz/everything_the_battle_for_the_dawn_part_2/

Now i was originally going to make this longer up to 10 parts but i decided that be too long and trying to extend it to two parts is a very daunting tasks so i just stuck to having it be three parts but if you want i will make a part 4 focusing on what would've happen if Arya survived the Battle for KL and if Grey Worm died there instead of lived. Anyways now that is out of the way let's conclude.

The Tarly, Hornwood, and Umber soldiers that stayed behind and are trapped in the fire wall realise that when those two Ice Dragons were killed half of the wights collapsed lifeless so the solders decide when the third ice dragon lands they will overpowered it as the wights did with the queens dragons. So when the third and final ice dragon lands to save the night king the soldiers overpower it and kill the ice dragon with Dragonglass and Valaryian steel when it dies more of the wights collapse to the ground but that does not matter as they are still overpowered by the others and wights that did not fall and The Tarly soldiers that stayed are killed and House Hornwood and House Umber goes extinct but will be remembered in history for there sacrifice.

Meanwhile mads Mikkelsens priest makes it in time with some faith militant and rides to Winterfell where Jon and his forces with the Dothraki, the Tarly forces that retreated, and Remaining Unsullied get ready for the others and Sansa, Gilly, Sam, and Lyanna are getting the women and children on wagons to the Riverlands. Meera also gets Bran out of warg mode so they can escape she get Bran on one of the wagons to the Riverlands wall she stays to help fight the others in one last stand against the others. It is also revealed that the night of the funeral Sansa and Podrick slept together and Sansa is pregnant with Pod's twin children.

Meanwhile Dany, Tyrion, and Jaime with Rhaegal have made it to the Riverlands with Rhaegal flying back for unknown reasons. Dany, Tyrion, and Jaime make there way to Riverrun where The Westerlands army is and the knights of the vale and Timett and his clansmen. Timett informs Tyrion that they got a Raven from Jon stating that this is where we would regroup at the Riverlands. Jaime, Tyrion, and Dany enter the castle to meet with Edmure Tully and Roslin Frey. Jaime apologises for threatening Edmure. Edmure Reluctantly accepts his apology they do not know what to do next. Tyrion decides to go for a walk in the woods where he meets Nymeria and the wolfpack Nymeria tries to attack Tyrion at first but Tyrion put his hand out letting her know he means no harm and pets her informing her about the bad news about Arya. Jaime and Edmure discuss a plan to fight back Wall Dany chooses to stay as she is too weak from the battle.

Meanwhile Mads Mikkelsen's priest and his Faith Militant go with the women and children to the Riverlands Wall the fire force field wares off and the others and remaining wights come in and kill Marwyn as Thoros escape The Tarly Forces that retreated fight the others but are over powered and the others make there way to winterfell where Jon with his Northern forces, Remaining Unsullied, Meera and the remaining Reed forces, and The Dothraki get ready to fight off the white walkers but then out of nowhere Edmure, Jaime, and The Reiverlands forces come in with Dragonglass and flaming arrows come in and help fight off the others and remaining wights and Rhaegal come sin and fights off some of the others and wights. However the Night King with two others  makes his way into Winterfell where Sansa is with Gilly, Sam and there baby. Podrick defends them off and kills the other two White Walkers with Dragonglass but The Night King knocks him down and bashes his head in with his fist killing him.

But this gives them enough time to escape. The Dothraki Commander finds Lyanna hiding in the Armoury and the Dothraki Commander picks her up and he races as fast as he can to the wagons exiting the city and pushing wights out of his way Wun Wun style. Gendry with his remaining Stormlands fleet come in and help take on the others. Jorah also mistakes Jon for an other and accidently plunges his sword into his heart killing him for good but when he pulls his sword out it starts glowing. Anyways Jaime hops on Rhaegal and flies off to the Riverlands wall Jorah, Sam, Gilly, Meera, The Dothraki commander, Jaime, Edmure, and Gendry retreat along with the woman and children, The Northern forces, the Riverlands forces, The Reed forces, The Remaining Dothraki, and whatever is left of the Unsullied.

Everyone regroups at the riverlands where they are trying to decide what is next with both the human and the others sides have heavy casualties. Tyrion decides enough is enough and they need to make peace with the others that is what Jon would've wanted. The Priest finds Jorah and informs him he is Azor Ahai and that there is three sacrifices the water, The lion, and the Nissa Nissa. Jon was the water sacrifice now he has to kill Tyrion (the lion) and Dany (the Nissa Nissa). Jorah goes with Tyrion and Dany to discuss peace Jorah kills Tyrion and his sword turns red then he goes to Dany and confesses his love to her and that he is sorry. and as he is crying he plunges his blade into Dany's heart.

When he releases it the blade turns flaming and he heads to the Night King. Jorah demands to know why they want to destroy humanity. The Night King explains that Humanity can not be controlled and explains that they kill each other and worship the red gods and the Night king wants to destroy them to lead and new species that would heal the world. But the Night king also stats he is not a savage he sees the good in humanity as well the compassion, the love, the honour, etc. he also stats that Jorah is indeed a man turned good he would die for his love, go above and beyond to help those in need, a man once dishonour now would go so far as to kill the woman he loved to save humanity and says that if he gave Jorah his power he would see the peace through.

The Night King takes Jorah's sword and plunges it into his heart and the sword turns into ice and the Night king as he dies turns human. Then he whispers ""the peace has been made. You are the night king. You know what to do"" then he dies and the wights collapse and then Jorah turns into an other. Jorah with his others goes to the Riverlands and informs all that the treaty between humanity has been made and as long as humanity learns from it's mistakes there will not be another war and no need to build a wall. Jorah with the remaining others leave humanity wall bran goes with them as he is the new three eyed raven.

Sansa pregnant with Pod's twin children becomes queen of the seven kingdoms with Thoros as hand of the queen, Varys resumes master of whispers, Gendry is lord of storm's end, Timett is made lord of the vale, Lyanna Mormont is made queen of the north until Sansa's unborn children come of age, Sam becomes lord of Highgarden Marries Gilly and writes the song of ice and fire, Yara resumes as master of ships and queen of the iron islands, Jaime is offered casterly rock but declines it and becomes queensguard to protect sansa in the name of Brienne, Rhaegal flies off into the sunset never to be heard of again, and Sansa raises Danys child as her bastard and when he comes of age she will name him his era and founder of house Stargaryen.

The characters who live are: Sansa, Bran, Meera, Sam, Gilly, Yara, Little Sam, Gendry, Jaime, Varys, Timett, Edmure, Roslin and their child, Lyanna Mormont, Nymeria, Thoros, and Rhaegal.",3,1,False,self,,,,,

Here's my take - 

Robert Baratheon and Rhaegar would still face off. Robert would severely injure Rhaegar, but unlike what happened, the loyalist army do know who to take orders from since the two men Rhaegar trusted most, were there. 
 
Gerold Hightower would lead the forces, and Arthur Dayne would fight Robert in single combat, and Athur Dayne would narrowly win, killing him. The army of Mace Tyrell would be called into the Trident, instead of being sent to storms end, and a lot of the Rebel forces would be killed, including either Ned or Jon Arryn, or both. 

Stannis bends the knee because his brother is dead and he doesn't really have a choice. 

The Starks will be allowed to keep the North under maybe the newborn Robb. 

The vale would also bend the knee. 

The sack of KL still does happen, and the mad king is dead. 

Rhaegar promises that he isn't and won't be his father but strips off House Lannister off most of their titles and lands for what happened to Elia. 
Tywin and jaime would be executed, leaving Tyrion  to live his days in Casterly Rock. 

The war is over and Rhaegar becomes a good but depressed ruler because both his wife, and Lyanna, would be dead. 

He would then go to the TOJ to bring back the newborn Aemon Targeryan and train him to be his heir. 




Edit - my bad for writing this an a hurry. Sorry. 

Robert doesn't kill Rhaegar, but severely injures him and then when Rhaegar goes falling down into the ruby ford, some of his loyal troops carry him out of the battlefield. He gives command of his army to Gerold. 

Edit 2 - again sorry for the mistakes about the Westerlands. I don't quite know what would happen in the Westerlands but I guess the second most powerful house would be given charge.

Arya Stark and Oberyn Martell: 2 hotheads who are both obsessed with revenge. Arguing over who gets to kill The Mountain or Twyin Lannister would make for a great scene.

We are led to believe that Robb breaking his original oath with Frey is a strong preceding event leading to the Red Wedding. However with a man such as Frey, is it possible that the Red Wedding would have occurred regardless of whether Robb kept his original oath with Frey?

So then how come none of them did anything about Qyburn whom they both hated? You would think without his only protector Qyburn would at least be thrown into the dungeons? 

Season 5 has many rushed plot lines but they atleast have a bit of explanation here and there. We atleast see Cersei giving permission to the Sparrows to arm themselves before they do a blitzkrieg and take over the city and even parts of the keep apparently since they got to Loras so easily. Its rushed but atleast there is an explanation. We get to see Ramsay telling Roose that he is going to hurt Baratheon army's integrity by sabotaging their resources. Yeah it took only twenty good men but atleast there was an explanation for why Stannis's huge army from end of season 4 becomes so hungry and broken by the end of Season 5. 

But there is no explanation for how and why was Qyburn allowed to stay in the Red keep and create his monster for Cersei. You can't say its not a big deal since Zombie Mountain plays a big role throughout Cersei's season 6 plot line.

I'm trying to gauge how skilled these two guys are as warriors when compared to other characters in the novels and/or television series and how skilled they're supposed to be compared to, say, your average knight or skilled man-at-arms. 

&amp;nbsp;

We'll start with Beric Dondarrion. What we know about the man before his time leading the Brotherhood is that he was the one of the Marcher Lords of the Stormlands, Houses that are implied to he more martial and perhaps even see more action than many other Houses in Westeros due to their location in relation to Dorne and the Reach. We also know that Beric is a rather young Lord and a knight (two things that imply high-level training as he grew up and some level of skill in battle) and that he was the man chosen by Eddard Stark to lead the mission to capture Gregor Clegane. Now whether that was simply out of the convenience of Beric being present when Eddard made the order or because of some unmentioned reputation as a skilled, young Lord from the Dornish Marches is probably unknown, but we *can* say that he was chosen ahead of Ser Loras Tyrell, a man that we know is very skilled in arms. Furthermore, while we don't see much of the action that the Brotherhood takes part in, we do hear things second hand and get to view his swordsmanship skills once against Sandor Clegane, a duel he ultimately loses, but acquits himself fairly well for a short time against one of the most seasoned and dangerous warriors in the known world and ultimately loses due to a weakened blade.   


On the negative side, we know that Beric has been killed in battle many times, something that doesn't lend a lot of support towards him being a particularly noteworthy warrior. How much of this was simply chance and how much was him being over-matched (against, say, The Mountain) is hard to ascertain with certainty, but is definitely worth noting when we try to judge his martial prowess. 

&amp;nbsp;

Next we have everyone's favorite drunken Red Priest, Thoros of Myr. We know much less first hand about his actual warfighting skills as opposed to even Beric, as we never actively see him in a swordfight. But what we *do* know is that he has defeated The Hound in tourney melees before (though implied to be heavily influenced by his use of a flaming sword), but this also suggests that he did at least above average against the others in the melee that didn't have such a fear of fire. We also know that at the start of AGoT, Thoros is seemingly out of shape, pudgy and probably not in the best condition for battle, however we learn that after spending time with the Brotherhood in the Riverlands that he becomes much leaner, presumably in better fighting shape, and perhaps most importantly, he **isn't** killed several times like his friend and BwoB leader Beric Dondarrion is despite taking part in the same battles! One final noteworthy and potentially important pro for Thoros is that he was noted for having been the first man through the breach at Pyke during the Greyjoy Rebellion, implying that he possessed both bravery and some level of confidence in his skill at arms at that point. It becomes potentially more notable because we learn that the second man through the walls at Pyke was none other than Jorah Mormont, who was knighted for his performance in the same war.   


On the flip side, we know that Thoros also lost a tourney melee during Joffrey's name day celebration to Bronze Yohn Royce when his flaming sword went out and he was clobbered with a mace, perhaps suggesting that whIle possessing some skill that he isn't on the level of the better fighters of Westeros and formerly relied more on parlor tricks involving wildfire than his own swordsmanship. Also worth mentioning is that while he *does* survive the battles that kill Beric, we never really hear much about how he preforms in them and when it came time for Sandor's trial by combat, Beric was the one chosen to face off against the Hound and not Thoros. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, with all of that said, how skilled at arms do you guys think Beric and Thoros are supposed to be implied to be? Are they just average fighters waging a losing guerilla campaign, or are they above average, but below the elite fighters of the realm? And just for fun, which of the two do you believe to be the more skilled warrior -- if Beric and Thoros were to have a melee scrap, who do you believe would win and do you think it would be a close fight?",8,1,False,self,,,,,

-

**Images on Imgur are linked at the bottom, click on them if you wish, then come back and read the post; there should be 8 pictures in total.**

-

In the first scene between them, in the very first episode, Rickon is picking up misfired arrows from the floor and giving them to Jon Snow. In the last scene between them, Jon Snow is trying to pick up Rickon before he is shot by ""misfired"" arrows at the start.

-

After Rickon gives Jon the arrows he goes to the background to pick up more of them, we are presented with a scene of Jon Snow in the foreground placing the arrows into the bucket, while Rickon in the background goes behind the bulls-eye mark, walking with a stretched arm towards Jon Snow in the foreground, Jon Snow's body intentionally moves away as Rickon is getting closer to him in the background, and then he touches Robb Stark who is behind Jon Snow with Rickon in the background (*touches the dead brother by Season 6*).

-

I am not sure if all of this was intentional. But if they knew in Season 1 that *Rickon was going to die with arrows while running towards Jon Snow*, then I would say most of this was intentional. Similar to my last post about how Catelyn tells Bran that he always looks at his feet before he lies and then two scenes later we have Ned Stark looking at his feet before he lies to King Robert about Jon Snow. It's just easier picking up on these hints/foreshadowing in hindsight. And I am sure we will find many more once the whole show is finished.

-

There is also an interesting parallel between the very same scene (*Episode 1*) where Catelyn is looking down on Jon, and at the end where Melisandre is looking down on them from the opposite side of the courtyard. One hated Jon Snow, the other now believes he's the savior. One who wished he would die, the other brought him back from the dead. Taking book events into considering, other interpretations could be drawn too. But I'll leave tin-foil theories out of it and keep it just on the parallels.",8,6,False,self,,,,,

But then I started to think about it harder, and I'm just not sure. The easy answer I think would be **Jon**. He is undoubtedly the greatest swordsman in the North at present, having killed a whitewalker, and killing 19+ men in the Battle of the Bastards. He's fought some of the best fighters, and he's won. When it comes to sword on sword, he clearly has the upper hand.

But then you have people like **Bronn** and **Daario** who are clearly skilled fighters in their own respect. They fight in a much grittier, less formal/traditional style. Neither have met an opponent that they couldn't defeat, and both have used their street/slave fighting to best those who have been taught by Lords/Knights. They can be just as deadly, if not more so than Jon in battle.

Then you have the **Hound**, **Brienne**, and the **Mountain**, who are utter tanks in battle. All 3 have proven themselves time and time again, with Brienne beating Jaime and the Hound, albeit both men were at a disadvantage. The Hound proving himself on multiple occasions, and the Mountain being, well... the fucking *Mountain*.

Then again, couldn't you just throw a lantern on him and watch him go up like a roman candle? I mean, isn't he dead and all? I would wager both the Mountain and Benjen are now more terrified of fire than the Hound is.

I would say that IMO, **Bronn is the best fighter**. He's been beyond the wall and back, fought and won against every opponent (both knights, soldiers, and... assassins? *Maybe that's giving too much credit to the sand snakes*). While he did not face the Mountain, he did offer up his services to Tyrion in exchange for a large castle, and the Mountain has fallen before to an opponent who is quicker than him. I think Daario is close behind, but Daario has only been in Essos, and has not spread out his combat as much as Bronn has. Sure, he's probably faced a Westerosi knight before, but that's just it; Bronn doesn't fight like a knight.

Just to be safe - CW: death, cancer, loss


I know this is a shot in the dark and probably not the right place but I'm going to keep trying to get this done.

Christmas 2015 my mum was diagnosed with Stage 3 lung cancer. After chemo and radio, everything looked ok as the single tumour they found appeared to be shrinking (by about 5cm in 6 months).

Approaching Christmas 2016 the doctors found two new tumours, one in each lung.
Christmas eve mum got a headache. It lasted 8 days so the doctors ran tests and, after a CT scan, they found the cancer had spread to her brain.

They've said there is nothing they can do and she's been given 4 months to live, at most.

Now, my mum has a bucket list. Some things we can do easily (she wants to go on a road trip as a family and she badly wants to get her first tattoo) so that is happening in the next week or two.
My mother has been obsessed with GoT since it started... well, both my parents have been. They don't have pay TV so they wait for it to come out on DVD each year and then they buy the latest season and rewatch the whole thing together.
I haven't seen them this into a show since Farscape ended in 2003. Mum is obsessed with Tyrion and she has more theories about what's going to happen than anyone without social media or internet access should have.

You get it. She's deep in the rabbit hole.

I'm concerned she won't get to see what happens next because the season doesn't appear to be due to air until after April this year.
I've sent enquiries via the HBO website, as well as direct to the HBO Australia Facebook page. I don't have twitter so I haven't tried that avenue, but I've stayed away from posting things where family and friends can see it, as I'm trying to not get anyone's hopes up.

I was wondering if anyone knows if this is a thing that could happen? If so, how I should be trying to make it happen? Mum doesn't know. Like I said, she's not really into social media (though the rest of my family are) and would likely tell me I shouldn't trouble the nice people of the internet.

She's a great person. I love her and I just want to help her complete her bucket list before she goes. Seeing her as happy as she can be for the rest of the time we have together is really going to make the difference for my whole family.

Thanks for any info/advice you can give. All the best.",14,70,False,self,,,,,

I'm on Season Five of my rewatch, and I was kind of dreading this season. It gets a lot of flack, and deservedly so. But it did have some great moments and storylines, and I was really impressed with Jon's first execution as Lord Commander. We saw him channel Robb in his slow, calm, quiet interrogation of his unruly lord, who ultimately follows through with his threat violently. He also followed the Stark tradition of the ""man who says the sentence swings the sword"" creed from Ned. I know they changed ""Ed, fetch me a block"" for apparently no reason, and a few other details I liked, but it was a pretty well done scene. We learn a lot about Jon, on the first of many difficult decisions he faces in his journey to become a leader. We learn about his Stark mannerisms, and learn to subconsciously associate him with the other male Starks. 

I also thought both actors did a good job. If I had a complaint I would say the blocking was a little weird when Thorne obstructed Edd, the actors justice seemed to move really oddly. The actor playing Janos was pretty good also. All in all, one of the better scenes in a 'meh' season. ",31,148,False,self,,,,,

Cersei wouldn't have been led to arm the Faith Militant since they weren't there in King's Landing, and then Margaery would have married Tommen and they would still be together as man and wife. Loras Tyrell would have never been imprisoned, most likely married Cersei but never have consummated the marriage. In the north, Ramsay would most likely have never killed his father whilst Tywin Lannister lived knowing that Tywin supported his father. Sansa wouldn't have been sold to the Boltons by Littlefinger and none of the imprisonments of Loras, Margaery, and Cersei would have happened. Cersei's walk of atonement would have never happened giving her no reason to blow up the sept with wildfire. All the Tyrells and Kevan Lannister would still be alive. Most importantly, the realm would essentially be at peace, considering the Boltons could have still very easily beaten Stannis and his army at the fault of Stannis burning his daughter and losing all of his men. Conclusively, if Oberyn Martell would have just killed The Mountain on the spot then and there when he had the chance, the realm would be at peace and Tommen, and all the Tyrells would still be alive.",7,22,False,self,,,,,

There were a few things that I felt were overlooked, a few things that were left out for time constraints, as well as the cliffhanger with Sansa that I'm too impatient to wait until summer for the resolution. I started with the actual teleplay, and made my changes on that. If you like this I'll post more, including future stuff (like Daenerys meeting Jon or a Stark reunion). Hope you enjoy!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

INT. WINTERFELL - DINING HALL

JON SNOW is sitting at the high table. SANSA sits beside him. Representatives from Northern houses, the Vale, and the wildlings are gathered in the dining hall. LITTLEFINGER stands off to the side, watching.

ROYCE: You cannot expect Knights of the Vale to side with wildling invaders.

TORMUND: We didnt invade. We were invited.

ROYCE: Not by me. (sits down)

JON SNOW stands up, defiantly.

JON SNOW: I invited them, because I remembered something that you've all long forgotten; The wall was not built to keep out the living, it was built to keep out the dead. Their ancestors just happened to be on the other side of the wall when it went up. But anyone who has been north of the wall will tell you that up there, the free folk are the least of your worries. Some of my brothers thought it would be better to leave them in the north to die, as if they'd forgotten that men don't stay dead north of the wall. When I went to invite them at Hardhome, an army of dead men attacked, and massacred us. Nearly a hundred thousand were slaughtered; Men, women, children... now they fight for the Night king. Unlike the free folk, we can't negotiate with THEM, because the only thing that will satisfy them, is for all of us to die.

NORTHERN LORD: You expect us to believe these stories Jon Snow? And let us not forget that you invited the wildings as Lord Commander of the Night's Watch; an oath taken for life. Why should you not be executed as a deserter?

JON SNOW stands up and lifts up his blouse, revealing the scars on his torso.

JON: (Shouting) I GAVE my life to the watch. Some of my brothers thought I broke my oath when I let the free folk pass through the tunnel, so they murdered me. But the gods weren't done with me, so they brought me back.

SER DAVOS stands up

DAVOS: Its true! I was at castle black when Jon Snow was murdered by men who called him brother, and Lord Commander. His heart stopped, his breath stopped, and his body grew cold... for days. I'd seen the Red Woman do things beyond explanation before, so I asked her to try to use her magic for good for once. She prayed to her Lord of Light, and Jon Snow arose. I'm not the only one who saw it either, go to Castle Black and they'll tell you the same thing. These men saw it too (pointing at Tormund and crew). 

JON SNOW: Growing up, our maester told us that things like magic, giants and white walkers were just stories told to entertain children. And even if they were real, they died thousands of years ago. I believed it too, until a dead man tried to kill me... Now you've seen a man brought back to life with magic. Now you've seen a giant with your own eyes. And if you go beyond the wall, you'll see the white walkers too. Mance Rayder didn't want to conquer the 7 kingdoms, he only wanted to pass through the wall, to get his people the same protection that we've all taken for granted for millenia.

The crowd murmurs. LORD CERWYN stands.

CERWYN: The Boltons are defeated. The war is over. Winter has come. If the maesters are right, itll be the coldest one in a thousand years. We should ride home and wait out the coming storms.

JON SNOW: Aye, the Boltons are defeated... the battle is won, but the war has just begun. And I promise you, friend, the true enemy wont wait out the storm. He brings the storm... An army of dead men has been secretly forming for a long time now, and its bigger than all of our armies put together. And unlike most armies, after they fight a battle they end up with more soldiers than they had before it started. I can't tell you how they're going to do it, but when the Night King marches south, we can't depend on the wall to stop them. 

You say you won't fight with wildings, but they fought beside me when most of you did not. They stood up to tyranny when you did not. They didn't fight for our home. They don't care what crimes the Boltons committed. They didn't fight to return the Stark's to Winterfell. They fought because they know what's coming. They know that when the real war comes, the living must stand together as one. The Boltons divided us, but (points at his sister) the Starks have always united the North. And if you think you can hide in your castle when the dead march on the living, it will be too late to act when you finally realize you were wrong. We must stand together. We are not fighting against a tyrant, or injustice. We are not fighting corruption, or indignity. We must fight for our very survival. We must fight, or mankind will perish.

more murmurs from the gallery.

NORTHERN LORD: You say we can beat them if we stand together, but how do you kill what's already dead? Like the Ironborn say, 'What's dead may never die,' so how can we stop them?

JON SNOW: First, we burn the dead so they can't be turned into one of them. We can kill the wights with fire and steel. As for the white walkers, the first men used dragon glass. We found a cache at the fist. Samuel Tarly used a dagger made of dragon glass to kill a white walker. And I... (Jon unsheathes his word) this sword was given to me by my predecessor, Lord Commander Jeor Mormont (looks at Lady Mormont), after my direwolf Ghost and I saved his life when he was attacked by a wight. The White Walkers can turn common swords to ice and shatter them like glass, but this sword is made of Valyrian steel. I defeated a white walker at Hardhome, and when I struck him with this sword his body shattered like broken ice. They CAN be stopped, they can be defeated... but only if we can stand together. No other battle matters. We must stand together as the living in order to defeat the dead. When we defeat his army, I'll drive this sword into the Night King's cold heart and end the war, like our ancestors before us.

JON SNOW lays his sword on the table before him, and sits. The men begin to murmur. LYANNA MORMONT stands.

LYANNA: Your son was butchered at the Red Wedding, Lord Manderly, but you refused the call. And how long has your house been loyal to the Starks Lord Glover? Yet in their hour of greatest need, you refused the call. And you, Lord Cerwyn, your father was skinned alive by that traitorous cunt Ramsay Bolton himself. But even you refused the call. But House Mormont remembers. The North remembers. We know no king, but the King in the North, whose name is Stark! I dont care if hes a bastard. Ned Starks blood runs through his veins. Hes my king from this day until his last day.

JON SNOW's eyebrows raise and his mouth falls agape in shock. He stands up, at a loss for words.

JON SNOW: My lady, you honor me... truly. But, that's... not why were here. I have no desire to be a king. Besides, a trueborn Stark sits before you (points to Sansa sitting beside him, who smiles). I only fought, because my sister called upon me to do so. and I didn't defeat the Boltons, I lost the battle. Lady Sansa warned me that Ramsay Bolton would trap me, but I didn't listen. She told me he would never let our brother Rickon survive, but I didn't listen. I fell into his trap, and scores of men died because of it. If it weren't for the Knights of the Vale, Ramsay Bolton would be standing here, and his hounds would be feasting on my corpse. The Knights of the Vale came, because my sister called upon them. She was born to be a queen! She would have been the queen of the 7 kingdoms if Robert Baratheon had a trueborn son. If the north is to be a kingdom again, let it be her who rules us.

SANSA smiles and grabs Jon's hand, and he pulls her upright. Men murmur, and a few bang on their tables in approval. Sansa looks at LITTLEFINGER as a sinister smile creeps across his face. Her lip stiffens. Jon sits back down.

SANSA: Thank you brother, but you're right... a war is coming. A war no man can avoid. A war that will decide the future for all of us. We do not need a queen... (looks at Jon) we need a commander. 

(The smile dissapears from Littlefinger's face, he furrows his brow in concern and narrows his gaze)

Bran the Builder built this keep. He allied the first men with Giants to do so, and to erect the wall as well. And just now the last living giant fought and died for my brother Jon, right here, at Winterfell. Starks have manned the wall for thousands of years. Unlike the rest of the world, the Night's watch chooses their leader, and they chose Jon. And unlike the rest of the watch, he chose to be there; to serve the realm, forsaking himself. He has made hard decisions for the good of us all. He has fought beyond the wall. He's one of the only men to kill a white walker in thousands of years. 

My mother made sure Jon always remembered he was not a Stark, and... (looks at Jon) I'm ashamed that I did as well. But our father wasn't born to be lord of Winterfell either; he was a second son. He accepted it as his duty when the mad king murdered his older brother... He always did his duty. He was one of the most honorable men in Westeros, and yet even he had a stain upon that honor. A single stain, but it was Jon who was forced to wear it. Jon was not born to be a lord or a king. He too has always done his duty. He learned humility, and the meaning of honor. He has led a life more than worthy of the Stark name. 

I say Jon Snow died that day at Castle Black, and instead, the gods brought him back as Jon Stark. Divided, we will surely fall. But Jon will unite us. I called on him to fight and he did, despite overwhelming odds. We don't need someone who claims a throne as their birthright, we need someone who will become king for the good of his people. Someone who will accept the burden of rule because it is his duty. He would fight and die for any of us, and he will inspire other men to do the same. We don't need someone to sit on a throne; we need a commander, standing at the head of our army, leading men to fight an enemy worse than any we have faced in eight thousand years. (she points at Jon) That person, is my brother Jon!

The men all cheer, and bang their fists on tables. JON SNOW stands up, and embraces SANSA She looks over his shoulder, locking eyes with LORD BAELISH again. She shoots him a sarcastic look of apology.

The men resume murmuring. LORD MANDERLY stands.

MANDERLY: My son died, fighting for Robb Stark, the Young Wolf. I didnt think wed find another king in my lifetime. I didnt commit my men to your cause, cause I didnt want more Manderlys dying for nothing. But I was wrong. Jon Snow avenged the Red Wedding. While we did nothing, he defeated the greatest traitor the north has known in centuries. He united people that have been divided for ages. (he points at Ghost, sitting at Jon's side) He is the White Wolf; The King in the North!

MANDERLY draws his blade, then rests it point-down on the ground and kneels. LORD GLOVER stands.

GLOVER: I did not fight beside you on the battlefield, and I will regret that until my dying day. A man can only admit when he was wrong and ask forgiveness. I will not make that mistake again. House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousand years! And I will stand behind Jon Snow the King in the North!

GLOVER draws his blade, then rests it point-down on the ground and kneels.

GLOVER: The King in the North!

Everyone in the hall stands and draws their blades.

ALL: The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North!

LITTLEFINGER looks dissapointed. SANSA smiles and raises Jon's hand above his head, and joins in the chanting.",25,24,False,spoiler,,,,,

Both Margaery and Olenna have  shown a real talent for the power game of King's Landing.  Margaery's conversations with Littlefinger in Renly's camp before and after the assassination to me is still the best example of a character who know's Littlefinger's game and plays it even better than Littlefinger himself.  However, when it came to dealing with the Sparrows, Margaery allowed her emotions to control her actions, specifically her devotion to her brother.  

Margaery used her abilities to demonstrate to the High Sparrow that she would play his game, but she didn't use her new found freedoms to help herself.  When the High Sparrow asks her want she wants to do first, she reveals she wants to see her brother.  This confirms to the HS that he can control her through her brother, thus showing him he can give her a little length to her leash so she can bring her husband the King into the faith's fold without running off.  We know she could leave the sept because the HS talked to her about not sharing the King's bed and saying she should do so more.  This is the perfect opportunity for her to hold up in the Red Keep like Cersei did minus the walk of (shame) atonement, or an even better opportunity to use her control over Tommen to force him into making changes.  Tommen's attention was being fought over by Cersei and Margaery before the HS got involved, but Margaery could now work with Cersei to rearrange the power struggle after Cersei's walk.  Instead, she stayed under the HS's thumb so she could try to get her brother out.  

Olenna in her younger years would have used her persuasion to force the King's hand, and she clearly realized in House Tyrell that the women are the power players and the men are more aloof.  I think Olenna would have abandoned her brother for a time to try and save the situation, where Margaery couldn't disconnect herself enough to play the game properly as she had done before.  To me this is the best part of GOT, that the characters show flaws and get defeated by them. Margaery showed he abilities to control and direct some of the most difficult/powerful people in Westeros: Littlefinger, Joffrey (the only person who could control him in fact), Sansa, Renly and others. But the HS found her weakness in Loras and used it to his advantage.

I have a post about it that u can checkout here - https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/5mqw55/main_spoilers_varyss_origins/?st=IXUVXURS&amp;sh=3c93381c

Now in this article I'm gonna talk about why Varys was cut. 

Now we have already established Varys being a Reyne. Good. Who was the reason the Reyne family died out? Tywin Lannister. 

So my theory is that, Tywin got Varys cut. 
What all do we know about Varys's cutting? Firstly we know that the priest who bought Varys from the actors paid a VERY HUGE AMOUNT of money. Who would sanction this? Obviously, the richest man of westeros. 
Why? Because of the actions of Lord Reyne. Obviously. 
Secondly, we do know that there was a voice in the flame. Most people say that's just for Kingsblood. But kings keep changing, nobility doesn't. The voice in the flames is for Noble Birth. Varys was of noble birth, but his family had lost their lands and titles and he was the last one. 

Now the question comes to your mind. Why not just kill Varys? 
Tywin was a sensible man. When he sent the person to deal with Varys, the mad king's reign of insanity was just beginning. He did not want to be what they called the mad king. And he was sensible in general. Why kill a little boy for the doings of his father? Instead just cut off any hopes of future Reyne members. Solves the problem. 

I know the kingsblood part is highly subjective. But all this makes sense to me.

Of course, even if he did do that, I'm sure Ramsay would've found a way to kill him anyway... but just the fact that Jon got to see Rickon for the first time in years only to see him die made me so upset.

It's pretty damn good, I was binge watching the show all night and I'm not even tired so I'm going to watch a little more. Anyways, on to my question. 

I was wondering if I should put the show on hold and read the books first. Do the books tell the story of what happened before part the show kicked off at? It seems like they have referenced a lot of things from the past that I don't really have a clear understanding of, like how exactly Robert Baratheon became king after King Aerys was killed. 

So should I stop the show and go ahead and order the books? If I had to choose one, I would prefer watching the show if I'm not missing out on a ton of history.",16,2,False,self,,,,,

Robbed Rob by becoming the victor

Took his head

And ruled in his stead

He's one of the Lannisters

The one who called his banners' sers

He lived in Casterly Rock

Where he nearly put Jamie in wedlock

&amp;nbsp;

Then we have Cersei

Who tried to give Ned mercy

But Joffrey denied her

His wrath the people incur

She tried to rule Kings Landing

But found her son too demanding

She acts as queen regent

And made Tywin move his legions

&amp;nbsp;

Tyrion the imp

Some call him a pimp

Why with all the whores

He's known at brothel doors

He's really quite a smart guy

When he tries not to die

He won at Blackwater bay

But no one wants him to stay

&amp;nbsp;

The Lannister sigil

Inspiring vigil

Gold lion, red cloak

Certainly aren't broke

The army's vanguard

Marching lands they charred

The war left them scarred

While the mountain starred

&amp;nbsp;

Mance Rayder

He's no born invader

The king beyond the wall

Hoping the Nights Watch will fall

When they heard about the others

They had to pass the black brothers

It was tougher than they thought

And tougher when Stannis fought

&amp;nbsp;

I hear he knows nothing

And he's eternally suffering

His name is Jon Snow

Everyone else learns so slow

But he loves Ygritte don't you know

And Ygritte loves that crow

He fights with longclaw

Riding alongside ghost's paw

&amp;nbsp;

The life of Rob Stark

Ended very dark

When his man wed a Frey

He saw his final day

He's the king of the north

Who claimed men that came forth

The grey direwolf

Who bested every hoof

&amp;nbsp;

The household head

The noble Ned

Who finished dead

When Illyn took his head

He's got a bastard son

From the war he won

Now he's in the tombs of Winterfell

Where all his ancestors dwell

&amp;nbsp;

The old Valyrian flood

Drew out the dragons blood

In the ancient barbarians

Then came new targaryans

Half of them turned insane

But they all played the game

Of thrones of course

With bother and sister intercourse

&amp;nbsp;

The house Stark

Worship the sacred bark

Of the ancient weirwood

Where the first men stood

They believe in the old gods

No bowing where the 7 trods

A house of noble men

From Brandon to Benjen

&amp;nbsp;

As rich as a Lannister

Having sex with their ancestor

They have golden hair

An a deadly stare

Their name strikes fear

With the reigns of Castamere

A Lannister always pays his debts

Even if the other party forgets",1,1,False,self,,,,,

How in Westeros was Robb Stark planning to take Casterly Rock? Would his plan have worked if he didn't get Red Weddinged by the Freys? It seems to me like even if the Freys were nice to Robb and let him cross the bridge, he would not have been capable of taking Casterly Rock and the siege easily would have been broken by one of Tywin's many allies or the Greyjoys.

(Feel free to include more than one, and explain as much or as little as you like!)

I'll start. From S6-E10.

*Davos Seaworth to Melisandre: ""I loved that girl, like she was my own. She was good, she was kind, and you killed her!""*

Davos finally learning the specifics of Shireen's tragic fate was a long time coming, and to say Liam Cunningham delivered would be a massive understatement. Shireen's death scene in S5-E9 was a real punch in the gut, but I was more angry and disappointed at the time than sad. 

Given how much I enjoyed the dynamic between Davos and Shireen, the revelation was something I was both anticipating and dreading throughout S6. When Davos discovered the damaged stag toy mere hours before the big Jon Snow-Ramsay Bolton showdown, I had a nagging fear that Davos would be killed in battle, and thus never able to fully confront Melisandre.

Needless to say, I was relieved when that didn't happen, and just *thinking* about the devastation in Cunningham's voice when all was revealed almost caused me to lose my composure at work the next morning. Thankfully, 'customer service mode' kicked in before I could make any sort of scene. ",71,64,False,self,,,,,

Let's review.

* Renly's 100,000 strong against Stannis. Guess what? Blood magic. Stannis wins.
* Blackwater Bay - Stannis is set to steamroll Kings Landing. Wildfire trick wipes out half of his men. The other half is ambushed by Tywin and the Tyrells.
* Mance Rayder and his 100,000 wildlings attacking the wall. Cut down by Stannis and his ~5,000 from the Iron Bank.
* Stannis marching on Winterfell with the numbers advantage. Ramsay and his 20 good men. Mutiny. Stannis defeated.
* Boltons set to slay Jon and the Starks/Wildlings. Boom, Knights of the Vale.

All of the expected outcomes have been squashed in battle. Look who is sailing up to Kings Landing with a massive army. How can this possibly go well for Dany? The show is relatively unpredictable, granted, but when it comes to battle it's pretty predictable. Dany is cruising for a bruising. I don't think she's going to die, but experience is telling us this will not go well for her.

He's undeniably badass, and while he's very, very harsh, when he finally meets with someone who approaches his intellectual equal - Arya - he *smiles*. He has pleasant conversation with her. I feel like Tywin is cruel because everyone compared to him is an idiot. He wants strength and control above all else, but almost every single Lannister is *ruled* by their vices, which must piss Tywin off even more. When he finds Arya, he gives her his food and even offers her advice on how to survive; if he finds someone he actually likes, he's not cruel to them.

In what order?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/5o3yov/everything_stark_heirs_to_winterfell_in_what_order/,DutchArya,1484487535,"In light of Robb's Will, what do you think that means for the heirs to Winterfell?

George confirmed the Will is going to be addressed in the next book. And he also wondered (in response to a question about Jon becoming a true Stark via Robb's Will) George replied asking if Jon really was made Robb's heir? It's left very ambiguous in the books.

Hmm. That would be the logical assumptions if you consider what Robb tells Catelyn before he speaks to the Northern Lords and has them witness his Will. Robb wants Jon to follow him as heir if he leaves no children of his own before he dies. 

Robb names his dead siblings: Bran &amp; Rickon and disinherits Sansa. George makes no mention of Arya &amp; Jon in that final scene with the Will. Robb thinks Arya is dead in an earlier conversation with Catelyn. Telling Cat to stop fooling herself and that Arya is as gone as Bran &amp; Rickon. **Yet why does Robb not mention her later at the Sealing of the Will when he names all his dead siblings?** 

I think Robb made Jon his heir **WITH** the clause that there is no other rightful living heir (bar Sansa who was disinherited).

Which means the order of Stark heirs: Bran, Rickon, Arya, and Jon are heirs to Winterfell and the North.

So it goes....

&gt; LF wants to gain power over the North and the RL through Sansa, but the will would bar her from that. No Glover, Umber, Malister, Tully and Mormont and no Reed (if UnCat retrieved the will from Mag's Hire and had BwB sent to get it to Greywater Watch) will support Sansa. LF simply has no idea yet. He's planning for it, manouvring for it, and it wall all crash down on him. And the irony is that Robb barred Sansa from inheritance because of LF's secret interference in Sansa's marriage plans. It's the snake biting his own tail. A big FU at LF, unbeknowest to Robb at the time, and still unknown to LF.

&gt;Robb had the intention to name Jon heir, but not over his own possible future offspring. Coming after them would be Bran, Rickon, Arya and then Jon.",12,2,False,self,,,,,

Honestly I question whether you are even a decent person if you don't support the one true king. By every law and right the iron throne is his. There is no more honorable man in the seven kingdoms. When Jon Snow called for help at the wall, NO ONE LISTENED except the king who cared.... Stannis Baratheon. He wants to be king because it is his duty and right. If you don't support King Stannis then you have no respect for law and order. Eddard Stark supported the one true king, and so did Jon Snow, so if you like either of those characters you should like him too. He cares about your ability not your birth. He made a very lowborn man the Hand of the King. There is no one who cares more about justice than him. For those of you Dany lovers you like to ignore the fact that her father was mad and committed mass murder. They lost any right they had to rule. Stannis is the one true heir to the iron throne, and I am sick and tired of people hating on him. He's a great character, a strong leader, a brilliant tactician, and men would follow him out of honor and principle, not simple fealty.

Only King Stannis can protect the realm from the threats that lie from within, from across the narrow sea, and from the horrors awaiting beyond the wall.

Looking back and marathoning seasons 1-6, Dany has followed a very meticulously crafted story arc. 

She had much success conquering her enemies alongside her dragons - however, when it came to becoming a real queen and actually *ruling,* she isn't very good at it (which is understandable, considering she never had to handle such responsibilities before). 

In season 5, she tries to be as fair a ruler as possible, but it quickly becomes clear that Dany does not know what she is doing - she treats her subjects like they are Westerosi, marrying a foreigner when, it turns out, that that was not the answer at all  - in response to this, to her changing her ways, Drogon abandons her. Only when she is in danger, does he come back, wherein Dany sees him slaughtering the harpies but, much like herself, he is about to be butchered until she approaches and helps him, and together they escape with their lives. 

After this, Dany realizes she is effective as a conqueror, and only with Tyrion at her side can she hope to be an effective ruler. Her change in dress between seasons 5 and 6 symbolizes this change in viewpoint, and her ease in annihilating the slaver army further cements this fact.

Now we all know the scene when Ramsay tortures Theon and gives him his new identity as Reek. He asks...

https://youtu.be/FiN6NDmONFM?t=2m29s

...""what's your name?"" and then proceeds to hit Theon angrily when giving him the wrong answer. Now of course Ramsay would want to have an intimidating presence in this scene, but to me he almost seems to be filled with rage, a bit too much so in fact. I believe there is an explanation for this.


During the scene when Ramsay is legitimized, Roose asks him an interesting question. 

https://youtu.be/Bj9vZ378tXU?t=1m2s

""Now tell me, what is your name?""
Maybe this is just a parallel between the two Boltons but I believe there is more to it than that. Ramsay seems disturbed, annoyed and almost dissmissive of the question like it has been asked to him a thousand times before and I believe it also has been. Ramsay's answer is of course ""Ramsay Snow"" because it is what he expects it to be. To come to my point: I believe Roose Bolton used this question many times before in order to put Ramsay in his place when overstepping his bounds as well as a means of psycolocical torture on Ramsay as he hates being a bastard and it is something I honestly could see Roose enjoy doing.


TL;DR: I believe Roose used the question ""What is your name?"" as a means of psycolocical torture against Ramsay as he hates the fact that he was born a bastard.",29,215,False,self,,,,,

I came to a sudden realization that Ghost's white hair may be tied into the Targaryen legacy of having white, platinum hair. While Jon looks almost all Stark presumably due to dominant genes, his dire wolf is white. He's given the albino wolf and the runt of the litter because of his status as a bastard, but it could be some symbolism of his fathers white hair. Sort of a subtle hint placed in the show and book? There's no reason the runt of the litter has to be an albino so it struck me as a possibility that it was intentional. 

Any thoughts on this?

We have sixty episodes to get through, and no official date for season 7. Along with a desire to accommodate people's viewing habits, we're approaching the rewatch in a slightly different way this year.

The plan is to watch five episodes a week, starting on Sunday, January 29. You can view the full schedule [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/wiki/discussion_series).

We'll also be including a few features in the post for the first time. We'll have links to popular post series for each episode, end-of-season surveys to rank the episodes (if there's interest), and links to view the sub on each episode week.

**Weirwood.net - View the sub on any episode week**

* [Collection of episode week links](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/wiki/weirwood_net)
* [Season 1 detailed breakdown](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/wiki/weirwood_net/season-1)

It can be really interesting going back and reading the old episode threads to see what people were saying at the time, and this an extension of that.

The two links above let you view all the top posts from the sub for each episode week. The top has links for all six seasons, whereas the detailed breakdown (the other seasons will be available very soon) works on mobile, and, as the name suggests, includes a bit more info.

---

We are entirely open to suggestions on better ways to schedule the rewatch, or other ideas for it, so please go ahead and share any feedback you have.

We know for the fact, that TER wanted to teach Bran a lesson about the manipulation of the past events, right? Why did he show Bran this moment from the past in the first place other than showing him something else? I come from the predicament that TER was way smarter than what we are presented with and there was a direct reasoning for him to show this to Bran. Maybe, he knew the possible outcome of the future and it was important to preserve this vision throughout Bran. Am I wrong to assume that the whole arc revolving around Bran's knowing Jon's identity basically confirms that Jon is the most important person in the GOT and that his identity plays a huge role in the future events?

Sorry if I am misunderstood. I am almost not sure what my question even is. I am probably looking for confirmation of what I think and if you think I am wrong, I am very open to your ideas.

This is a list I made of sort of ""tiers"" of the moral systems of each character, descending from most ""good"" to most ""evil"" Based more or less on general stereotypes of good and evil.

Because of the Complexity of the characters, some of them are featured in multiple ""tiers"".

Would love to see how other people feel about this list and if they think the characters are organized properly. People I had difficulty placing were Jon Snow, Jaime Lannister, and Cersie and Catelyn.

Everyone's all wrong about the Jon and Dany thing. Dany is gonna be too worrued with conquering Westeros and Jon's gonna be too pre occupied with the Walkers.
What we really need to focus on isn't the combat side of the war against the dead, but the intellectual side. Sam is currently in the largest library in Westeros, and Bran is tripping balls on tree roots. Since we already know Brandon can see the past/ affect  I believe he will witness the creation of Valerian Steel, and warg a smith to write down his process of how to make it (or some equivalent) and will make sure ano instruction of some kind ends up in the Library Sam is in who just so happens to find it. Raven to Jon with this info, saying he needs a Targaryen Dragon.
Bc Jon is likely part Targaryen he will steal one of Danys dragons and ride to the north where he will make a shit load of Valerian steel. Equip an Army and ride into battle on a Dragon but the Dragon won't be able to fly bc Jon's balls are too big at this point. Walkers get Shrekt and Dany executes Jon for Grand Theft Dragon.

I'm not sure. 

Now, it has come to my attention that Dany is barren. Which means she cannot produce a child. 

""When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east, when the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves. When your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child. Then he will return, and not before."" - Mirri Maz Duur

This means Dany cannot have no more children because it would mean Drogo will return to her and that is impossible. I was thinking he would return as a white but I realised his body was burnt so that once again is impossible. Dany also mention somewhere that her dragons will be her only children. 

Dany is now on her way to surely conquer Westoros and sit the iron throne. She could be a good ruler or a bad ruler, doesn't matter. What matters is that she is unable to produce an heir. When she eventually dies it will mean everyone from everywhere who believe they have a claim to the throne will raise their armies and another war will break out. I believe one of Dany's main aims is to ""break the wheel"". However, instead of breaking it. She could actually be the one to re-spin it.

I just finished episode 2 of the 1st season and honestly I thought it was a total gem. 

We see many behaviors and actions that speak to who certain characters are to be in the future.

We see how cold hearted and spiteful Cersei is and will continue to be when she not only attempts to have bran assassinated. We also see how good she is at lying when she visits bran and gives Catelyn her condolences. You see her persuasiveness and power as well when she not only tries to have Arya punished for Nymeria's attack on Joffrey but also how she makes sure that a direwolf is killed.  

We see a young and corrupt Joffrey very early as well. He not only cuts the bakers boy in an attempt to impress Sansa but also lies about the incident in order to try and have Arya punished. This is a great foreshadow of the corrupt and crazy king he would become. 

We also see a young and brave John Snow. Even when Jamie basically tells him how shitty his life is to become once he takes the black, he stands up for the Nights Watch and does is best to protect their honor. We also see how even though he is the neglected and hated child in Cat's eyes, he has tremendous love and affection for his siblings. He has needle made for Arya and visits Bran knowing that it will bother Cat anyway. 

We see Danny finally start to become her own woman and take control as well. And we all know how powerful she eventually gets. 

We see a brace and reckless Arya. She has a whole lot of fight and emotion in her that we see with her incident with Joffrey as well as her reaction to Joffrey and Sansa lying. She is full of emotion, and this is something that throughout the series helps to control her decision making. This is also her first incident of hating both Joffrey and Cersei who both become names on her kill list that she recites throughout the series.

We see a naive and honestly pretty dumb Sansa as well. She's so caught up with being a lady and possibly becoming queen one day that she lies about her own blood sister. This thirst to be a royal member of Kings Landing guides her choices and decisions for the future. 

We also see the first hint at Tyrion's intelligence in the scene with John Snow where he is reading. He explains that because he is a dwarf, his most powerful weapon is his mind, and boy do we see how powerful this dwarfs mind truly is in this series. Great foreshadow of a phenomenal character.     

And last but not least we see the incredible loyalty and honorability of Ned Stark. We first see this in his decision to leave his family and kingdom behind to serve his King and friend. We also see his honorability in protecting Jon Snow by never giving up his real parentage, even when it clearly is the one dagger in his marriage and life with Catelyn. Not to mention the very first foreshadow and hint of Jon Snows parentage is in this episode when he tells John that he may not have his name, but that his blood runs through him. Not to mention his loyalty to the north by executing Lady himself as he believes that people and animals from the North deserve respect and honor. 

Other: we also sadly do witness the first direwolf death, but we also see Arya have Nymeria run away, and as all fans hope, is still alive in season 7. We also see the first shot of the Wall and it's incredibly massive size and structure. Can't forget as well that this episode sets up the fight between the starks and Lannister by Cat figuring out that Bran did not fall on his own. And one last thing is this episode is the first hint of dragons being born as Danny discusses their origins with the woman slaves. 

Sorry for the ramble, just couldn't help but notice the amount of foreshadowing and original character development that this episode has. Cheers! ",10,16,False,spoiler,,,,,

The answer has been dangling there since S01E01.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/5ork1w/everything_the_existential_and_for_some/,FattyBowlPack77,1484768430,"I've been researching this fan theory for a couple months, occasionally searching YouTube and Reddit to see if someone else made the claim yet so I don't have to, but so far, no one has to my satisfaction. I swore I'd never write my own fan theories, I swore I'd never write my own fan theories, but this one is too apparent that I can't keep it to myself anymore. Here it goes...

The answer lies at the Citadel. What exactly, well, I can only venture to guess based on some combined clues from the show and, specifically, TV show. S06E10 takes us into the Citadel where, for the VERY FIRST TIME, the audience sees that massive archaic heliosphere in real time rather than just in the credits. Think of that burning and spinning object that defines the intro credits. This seems like nothing to most but, having read ASOIAF, and recognizing Martin's mastery of foreshadow, I believe there is intention as to why this sigil-claded gyroscoping heliosphere is the focal point in the credits. These sigils tell stories, many of we know. Some of the stories of these sigils include:

- A Dragon setting fire to King's Landing (very first image of credits!) (Aerys Targaryen?)
- An army set against the wild Dragon (Robert's Rebellion?)

Then after panning down into Westeros and the whole city routine, it shows:

- Lion strangling the Dragon with the Stag helping while the Wolf seems to be off to the side (hurt?)

Then they pan down to Westeros for quite a while and come back to the heliosphere to end the show with:

- The lone and glorified Stag with the Lion kneeling in submission

The main point that I would like to make here is that, these events are closed within a cycle. Like the zodiac of tradition, there is a repetition that is in place for existence that seems beyond the characters control. Even after all of these characters die, centuries later, these same stories will manifest but with different people of the same houses. And the other gyroscoping bars that spin around the sun probably are variables of others tales or something that cross-sect with other stories, essentially allowing one to ""see"" into the future if they understand correctly how to read this helioscope-gyroscope thingy that has been in the credits since S01E01 yet not revealed until S06E10.

Go and rewatch the episode and pay special attention to the way the camera shot swings around the heliosphere JUST like it does in the intro. I believe that the Martin and the showrunners are familiar that ""they've shown us a pistol in the first act, and they know it's gonna go off in the third.""

Also, not quite sure what it means, look at the lens the clerical maester uses in S06E10 when Sam and Gilly arrive at the Citadel. They are the same exact lens that swipe and change during the credit sequence.

I believe, personally, that maybe Martin believes that all of life is a repetition of events and cycles of thoughts, repressions and freedoms, that makes up the ebb and flow of life. There are very specific times throughout ASOIAF where Martin mentions various Bran's that have cycled back through existence and seem to even be the same person. Life, maybe when you look at it from a god-like level, is not all that surprising or revealing, but a much larger consequence of actions far beyond our understanding. 
Like life, the point of it all is perhaps a little disheartening and, like the characters in ASOIAF, we all just need to learn to act accordingly.",26,10,False,self,,,,,

After all, it is a key element of the Azor Ahai legend, first introduced to the audience in early Season 2, alongside the characters of Melisandre and Stannis Baratheon.

At that time, of course, Melisandre proclaimed Stannis to be Azor Ahai reborn, and had him draw a flaming sword she dubbed 'Lightbringer,' consistent with her religion's prophecy. 

Despite the high amount of lore associated with Lightbringer from Book!Verse, however, it seems to have been largely glossed over by the show thus far. As far as I know, there has been no explicit reference to Lightbringer since that very first scene, despite numerous opportunities to do more with it. The show does not include, for instance, Salladhor relating the Lightbringer legend (most significantly, Nissa Nissa's sacrifice being necessary to forge it to its full potential) to Davos, nor is there a scene during Stannis's stay at Castle Black where Maester Aemon observes the sword, and comes away doubting its authenticity. Furthermore, despite including scenes of Stannis engaged in frontline combat at both Blackwater in Season 2 and Winterfell in Season 5, no effects are used to make Stannis's blade look noticeably different from others on the battlefield.

I hate to say it, but I get the feeling that Lightbringer is going to be yet another aspect of Book!Verse that gets lost in the mix.",2,1,False,self,,,,,

I will focus on the show version because with visuals those visions are easier to interpret. 

* Dany is in a destroyed throne room

I guess this is the result of the War between Cersei and Dany. However I cannot say if it's due to wildfire or dragonfire or both

* It's snowing in KL

Sansa Stark: ""Winter has come""

* The camera focus on her hand almost touching the throne. We can see she hesitates but gives it up and finds herself crossing the Wall. She then enters a tent inside which she finds Drogo and Rhaego. 

Here my interpetation of the vision: Dany will never be Queen. It's tragic because taking the throne to avenge her family was what she ever wanted but we all know it's GoT and people never have what they want. Sansa wanted to marry a Prince and she ended up with Ramsey lol. Same with Bran who wanted to be a member of the Kingsguard and became a cripple wizard. Instead Dany will choose to give up her claim to the throne to fight what's beyond the Wall aka the White Walkers. She will die in the process and then reunites with her Sun and Star. It also fits [Mirri Maz Durr's prophecy] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5E7kPax4eno). 

&gt; Dany: ""When will he be as he was?""
&gt; MMD: """"When the sun rises in the west, sets in the east when the seas go dry. When the mountains blow in the wind like leaves""

**When the sun rises in the West, sets in the east** : In the book some fans interpret it as Quentyn travelling in Essos. I don't know how it can happen on the show and in which context. Let's wait and see. 

**the seas go dry**: The Dothraki Sea is empfy now Dany brings her Khalassar in Westeros/ Seas  or lakes are freezing due to Winter

**When the mountains blow in the wind like leaves**: I'm 100% convinced it refers to the Wall coming down due to Bran crossing it and thus breaking the spell that protects the Realm of men

Oddly MMD never mentions the ""when your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child"" part  but Dany associates her infertility with the prophecy when she tells Khal Moro she will never bear a child for anyone ""not until the sun rises in the West and sets in the East"". I don't like the pairing because it's boring but Jon+Dany is (too) heavily implied at the end of S7. Tyrion advices her to dump Daario because she will have to find a husband once in Westeros (Jon is the only bachelor available) and then he tells her to move on because **""He wasn't the first to love [her] and he won't be the last""**. That's the cheesiest forshadowing of all time but there is nothing we can do about it and shippers all over the world will be happy :p

My second interpretation of Dany's vision is that she will find her second Khal Drogo (Jon) beyond the Wall and creates a family but I'm still convinced she's a goner. If she's Nissa Nissa and Jon, Azor Ahai he may sacrifice her at some point to forge Lithbringer. I don't know if Dany will indeed give birth to a living child or if the child will die in the sacrifice. Let's wait and see!

With Littlefinger spending so much time away, it will be interesting to see what kind of hold he has on the young lord of the Vale.

All theories welcome!",14,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

Then, he changes his face. There, we meet the Kindly Man, who then adopts the Jaqen face. Throughout Arya's time there, she also interacts with the Waif, who seems like a more advanced apprentice, but also no a true Faceless Man yet. She is antagonistic to Arya, while Jaqen tries to guide Arya. When Arya kills Meryn Trant, someone wearing a Jaqen face dies, and the other person in the room wears both the Waiface and the Jaqenface. Then we go right back to Arya being mentored by a Jaqen, and battling a Waif. Then Arya kills the Waif, brings her face back, and Jaqen smiles when she says she's leaving. 

So, obviously when anyone can change their face, it presents difficulty knowing who Arya is dealing with. Especially when the mantra of the order is to give up personal identity. She may never have met the same person who gave her the coin again. So how many different FM does Arya meet? Well, the original one in Harrenhall, and at least two others; since we see two die and one survive. And there could very well be many more. But whatever their numbers, they have different feelings about Arya. The Original one wants her to come to Braavos, and so does the Jaqen she meets there. The Waif exists to put Arya down, and when Arya kills her, she is able to cut off the Waiface. Being able to cut off the face makes it seem reasonable that it is her real face. 

So we have one Waif, a disgruntled apprentice who Arya kills. We have a Jaqen who was imprisoned in King's Landing and wanted Arya to go to Braavos. We have another or possibly the same Jaqen wearing the Kindly Man face, who tests her resolve before letting her in. We then see two FM wearing Jaqen faces almost at the same time; one apparently commits suicide to pay for Arya's mistake, and then one who begins the scene as the Waif and becomes Jaqen after the first FM dies. This may or may not be the true Waif though. 

So I'm stuck. I count at least three Faceless Men, with at least two distinct agendas. But there could be many more. I simply don't know how many Jaqens are running around, why they wanted Arya, why they were happy she left, or why they love that one face whenever Arya is around. Does anyone have any better theories, or see anything I missed?",61,151,False,self,,,,,

Here are three ideas i have:

1. He could have been lost at sea and found by Oberyn who put him on a ship back to Dorne (which explains where he's been). However he has to leave after Ellaria kills Doran and he makes his way to Highgarden and is under the protection of house Tyrell. When we next see him he is the general of the Highgarden forces. This would be awesome and this means Gendry already has a positive tie with Dany and house Tyrell and even House Martell.

2. He is a simple blacksmith in KL. This one is alittle more boring but he will still be useful as he can make valaryian steel.

3. He is leading a Resistance against Cersei and Dany spares him bringing his Resistance to her side but he must marry her in order to keep peace between Baratheons and Targaryens. Basically gendry will not like this and take a boat to WF were he can reunite with Arya and possibly marry. this one is the most likely as Robert's wish would be fulfilled but also it would be awesome to see him lead a Resistance.",6,0,False,self,,,,,

And Danny is coming over the narrow sea to take kings landing (assuming that she does) when she takes kids landing and when Jon and her clash heads they might come to the deal that Jon snow can rule in the north and Danny can rule everything else. I believe this was foreshadowed in the episode where theon and his sister requested that when they get back to westerous the iron island can be free and tryon said ""what if others demand independents too"". I believe this is a very possible scenario because I can't think of a reason Danny would care about the north and it's also very possible that it will be reviled to here that Jon is half targaryen. So she might feel more comfortable with Jon (the only other possible threat to her sitting on the iron throne) in the north where he wants to be. Because just as it can be assumed daenerys cares not for the north it can be assumed Jon cares not about the south.

something to think about I would say it would be a very satisfying ending for almost all partys. Theon &amp; His sister get the iron island, daenerys gets the south and dragons bay, and Jon and his sister's and brother get the north.

Why after 8000 years they were coming back. Then I thought how many days ago would that have been? 2.92 million days. We also know that the ASOIAF world is parallel to our world in technology and civilization. Game of Thrones would've taken place somewhere around the 1100's and 1200's in our time. 8000 years before that would've been 7000 BC. According to Wikipedia, the world population was around 8 million in 7000BC. It's safe to say the white walkers killed enough people to be a large percentage of the world population, but humans wouldn't have won the war for the dawn for sure if half of the world population was killed by white walkers. So they killed roughly 3 million people. So after all of this time they return after around the same amount of days as lives they've taken. We also know that magic is typically powered by death and blood. Perhaps the white walker magic can only last around a day for each life taken. They do seem to be sentient, which also means they have the same will to survive as the rest of us. If this is also true, then the white walkers don't want to kill everyone. If they do that, they won't be able to survive the next time they need blood. They know they have to keep people alive to survive longer. A sizable amount of people too so they have enough lives to take the next time. But they still are going to end up killing a fuckton of people if nobody stops them for good.

I like Dany, but she feels entitled to the throne. I'm not holding it against her, but I feel the story is setting her up to lose everything. It won't be during a great battle. It will be afterwards, when she feels the safest. I think she will take King's Landing and rule for a time. One of her dragons will die during the battle (the big one).

During her rule, Jon will plead with her for help to defeat the white walkers. Most of Westeros won't believe in the white walker threat. Jon will head north to capture a white walker, or at least a wight, and bring it to King's Landing as proof. Dany will agree to use her remaining dragons against the walkers, but then she will be murdered (I'll get to this in a moment). 

At some point, Arya and The Hound will meet up again. The Hound will die killing the mountain. Arya will kill Cersei. Hot Pie will have little to no screen time (sorry Hot Pie!). Samwell learns how to cure Jorah while training as a maester. 

On another note, I feel Varys' supposed ambitions are simplistic for such a cunning man. He wants what's good ""for the realm""? I don't think so. I think his abilities for manipulation rival Little Finger's, although he hides it well. He might have ambitions to rule and knows the only way to get there is behind Dany. Either way, I feel he is planning something, and it has everything to do with whatever he heard that voice say in the wizard's fire. Varys or Little Finger will be connected to Dany's death. If Varys is behind it, he will be killed by an enraged Jorah who has nothing to lose anymore. Jon will have a chance at the throne, but will turn it down just as Ned Stark did. His goal is still to defeat the white walkers.

Euron will use the dragon horn to control a dragon, and will try to take the iron throne. Yara and Theon will fight against him. He will be defeated. Little Finger or Varys will make a move on the throne during the resulting chaos. Bran will use his warg abilities to control the other dragon. Bran and Jon will fight the white walkers with the help of Benjen. There will be a battle and the dragon will die, to be resurrected by the Night King.

A major plot line will involve Jon versus Little Finger, with Sansa torn between them. Sansa or Jon kills Little Finger. Sansa will die, killed by a white walker as Jon watches. The finale will be Jon versus the Night King, who has a dragon and commands a huge army of wights. The white walkers lose, and Jon nearly dies. He will reluctantly take the throne as the seven kingdoms rally behind him. He never wanted to be Lord Commander or King in the North, but he accepted those roles and the responsibilities that came with them. His hand has always been forced.

I am making the prediction that he will betray Cersei; either by - helping Tyrion execute the Invasion / killing her himself.

The only time i can recall him even being in a conversation where they were brought up was a small council meeting with TYWIN and the other members of the SC. I have to assume that he know's about whats going on w/ her/them. Seeing as he usually has a endgame or an out for every foreseeable eventuality, I find it odd that we havent seen him make any mention, plans, talk, about a possible plan. I assume that his plan was install Sansa back into winterfell, and either marry her and rule, or marry her to Robin and continue to manipulate him to his will, or some of both, minus the sansa and robin marriage.

 Do you think that his lack of interaction with danny, directly or indirectly is genuinely because he doesnt have plans for her, or on purpose by the show, only to surprise viewers later? or because now that the marrying sansa plan has presumably failed he is going to make a move with danny? Also, what is the status of his one time alliance with Olenna Tyrell? Is that just out the window and Olenna is just out for Cersie's blood and nothing else matters? 

I Realize that given LF's nature, and what vary's has said about him, in particular, ""He'd see the country burn if he could be king of the ashes"", that playing second fiddle to Danny's conquest doesnt seem like his style, unless it was some sort of temp arrangement for survival if the starks turn their back on him, and presumable cersie learns of his betrayal.

So apparently I needed to title this better. Hopefully this isn't too vague now.

Rewatching the show and I just finished the episode where Catelyn lets Jaime go because she knows Rickard Karstark is likely to kill him for revenge in the morning. This moment was a huge turning point in the series and, to me, is where Robb lost the support of his men and ultimately the war.

It largely happens because Robb if away from camp but had Jaime not escaped thanks to Catelyn's help or had the Northmen found him, do you believe Robb would have let Rickard take Jaime's head?

On the one hand, it would have absolutely meant the death of Sansa and (as far as Robb knew) Arya. Being that they're his sisters and they're two of the only truly innocent people in this war, I can see Robb saying no.

In addition, killing Jaime really weakens Robb's hand as far as a peace settlement goes. Jaime is probably the ONE person in which a true settlement can be reached. What that settlement would be, I have no idea as Joffrey would absolutely not have allowed the North to remain independent (nor would Tywin) but Robb would still want his head.

Could Robb have given up his war to avenge his father if it meant his sisters would live?

On the other hand, I find it hard to believe Robb would have allowed a murdering Jaime Lannister to remains alive after he so clearly killed two people in his camp. There have to be rules, no? And if Jaime can kill Robb's prisoners and his men with impunity, what message does that send?

To me, Robb was in a shit position but I truly believe he would have thought hard about the decision and ultimately let Rickard have his vengeance to keep his bannermen loyal and hope, beyond hope, that he hadn't doomed his sisters in the process.",6,0,False,self,,,,,

We have seen a red wedding and a purple wedding. I think that season 7 is going to show us one more weddings - gold and white. Gold is a lannister grey joy wedding. Euron will help Cerci to beat dany's initial conquest (mid season finale) . Dany and rest of the crew flee north to get help from the king in the north. So cerci and euron marry to fortify their relationship. With Jammie not getting love from cerci anymore and also after witnessing that she is the newer version of the mad king, slays her. So he becomes the queen slayer and also fulfills the valanqar prophecy (season finale). 

 Baelish and sansa decide to get married after sansa grows jealous over Jon snow. They decide to team up. Mean while arya comes across the hound who is with the brotherhood at the moment. He tells her how baelish betrayed her father and updates her abt the current situation at winterfell. She then leaves from the river lands to winterfell (mid season finale)(along with gold wedding). She tells sansa abt what she heard from the hound. Sansa,arya and Jon(maybe) plan together to betray him on his wedding. So the black wedding happens and sansa holds a dagger to baelishs' throat. Jon snow passes the sentence and swings his sword, thus avenging Ned's death (white wedding).

Shouldn't be hard and anyone garrisoned there will likely see me as the rightful heir. As I arrive in kings landing, from the black water, the army from the Reach arrives from the other side. We might find it burned to the ground, but if not we can easily smash what is left of the Lannister army garrisoned there. From there I send my fleet around to white harbor, where they are unlikely to encounter ironborn along the way. I take my dragons and the bulk of my force to the river lands and lay siege to river run and the twins. Destroying house Frey along with my offer of Marriage to Jon snow will likely allow my fleet to enter white harbor in peace. After marrying Jon snow and securing the north I execute lord barlish for his numerous treacheries, which varys has informed me and Sansa and Jon snow of as soon as we all meet. Robyn aryyn might object, and refuse to believe that little finger killed his mother, but lord Royce will believe and he controls the knights of the vale. I then send every bit of my naval power to take the iron islands while I garrison the kingdom and take a host of northmen and my dragons to the wall. The majority of the 7 kingdoms will be enough to destroy Euron greyjoy, and while I might lose less men by sending my dragons, euron is know for treachery (in the books he has a horn that can control dragons) if he divides his fleet I may send my dragons to wherever he isn't, but they are to valuable to risk against him. After restoring and garrisoning the castles along the wall. I take my dragons over the wall. I ride one. Jon snow, who has blood of the dragon, rides another and Brandon Stark wargs into another. We fly high and careful, avoiding white walkers and slowly but surely burning the army of the dead. They have previously shown no prowess in archery or spear throwing, so my dragons are likely to be safe against just them. Once the majority of their host is burned I will take the greatest warriors in the 7 kingdoms north of the wall, armed with dragon glass and valerian steel. using gorilla tactics, we will strike at the white walkers, taking care not to lose any men or dragons, so to deplete their army. It may take years but we will drive them back, destroying their army of the dead as many of them as we can. With no ""meat"" or living people left beyond the wall their army will diminish in size and we can surround the remaining white walkers with Valyrian steel and dragon fire.

Also that the Darkness gathering is not the threat of the white walkers but Azor Ahai and dragons (notice how i don't mention his or her's dragons i will get to that in a bit) and that the true hero is the prince that was promised (Jon) would unite white walkers and humanity to make darkness flee before him. Now here is why:

1. Jon has been shown to be very Honourable. He made peace with the wildlings, Became commander of the watch and led it very well, and always followed by his father's rules (a man who passes the sentence should swing the sword) wall dany has killed people with no peace offering, Has burned alot of people, does not swing the sword when passing the sentence, and she does not negotiate.

2. it has been hinted at so much and set up so much that Dany is the hero of the story and she will win. Well that is too obvious. You can argue for Jon but Dany has been given that more then Jon

3. The song of ice and fire is not Jon and Dany but Jon himself. His stark side ice and his Targ side fire.

4. Dany would not be okay with Jon being around sense he could end up challenging her claim

5. White walkers have been seen as villains. Them to be negotiated with would be a huge twist and fit with the story. Perhaps Jon unites humanity and others against the dragons and Azor Ahai. 

6. Seriously would anyone really want Jon and Dany together in the end. No it is too predictable and obvious

Now let's get to Azor Ahai. If Dany is the villain then how come she is not Azor Ahai. Well she is the darkness gathering the true Azor Ahai will be the last person anyone thinks is Azor Ahai. The person everyone thinks will die in season 7 that person is.............Euron Greyjoy.

Yep i submit to you that not only is Dany and Azor Ahai the villains and dragons are the true darkness falling heavy on the world. But Euron Greyjoy is Azor Ahai reborn. And will fordge Lightbringer by killing a red priest and try to destroy the world. So the final season will be Jon and the starks (mainly Arya) with his forces and the white walkers against Dany her dragons and her forces and also Euron (azor Ahai) and his ironborn and the Second sons and sons of the harpy (yes Daario is revealed to be working with Euron) and when he defeats them he will be offered the iron throne.

But he declines it leaving with the white walkers to the land of always winter as the new night king. And Gendry, The stark children, Tyrion, Yara, and Varys will help rebuild Westeros and decide what will happen next. Tyrion is also offered the throne but declines it and becomes Lord of Casterly Rock and Gendry is put on the iron throne with Arya as his hand/Wife, Sansa is queen of the north, Bran goes beyond the wall and is the new three eyed Raven. and the kingdoms are now independent.

EDIT: Also another possibility for who could sit on the throne is that either Jon after all or a new character we have not met yet that proves himself ",21,1,False,self,,,,,

This is odd, as his hair is shorter now, and would be less easy to tie back. A few episodes later, Sansa crafts him a cloak like the one Ned wore. This got me thinking, who wanted to make all these ties between Ned and Jon? Obviously the showrunners want to do this for the sake of the audience, as Jon is returning to his Stark roots. But are Jon and Sansa also intentionally styling Jon as Ned? I'm almost certain Sansa thought it would be a good political move for Jon to resemble Ned, as just before she hands him the cloak, she argues that the north remembers. She's thought this through, she needs people to see Ned in Jon in order to rally the Northern lords. But Jon's hair change comes before he has even decided to lead the rebellion. In fact, it's almost immediately after his resurrection. This makes me think it was more of a showrunner only decision rather than a Jon character decision. 

Unsubstantiated Tinfoil: Bran sent Jon dreams of tying his hair differently! Bran also recently underwent a haircut, so we definitely know he thinks about men's hair, and Jon has weird dreams in the book about the Winterfell crypts that could have come from the 3EC. ",18,34,False,self,,,,,

Like the Wildlings ran from them, perhaps the White Walkers are running from someone worse than them. But what could be worse than something that could raise the dead and add it to their army?

Something that cannot die in the first place, perhaps? Atleast not to the White Walker's weaponry. I'm just spitballing here, but maybe this ''invincible'' enemy was a part of the White Walker 'civilisation' but broke off and decided to attack the other kind for reasons unknown, and now they are on the run from them because having an army of the dead can't do anything to fight something unkillable, except bolster their numbers and the odds that the White Walkers can escape unharmed?

What if, when the whole war between Dany and Cersei is over, and they finally gather to fight the White Walkers, it's revealed that there is an enemy even worse than them. Like in previous seasons when we thought that there would be a war between Starks and Boltons, but they'd have to band together against a White Walker invasion mid-battle, this could be something similar. Maybe they could add some 'character' to the White Walkers by revealing they can speak in the common tongue, as they inform Jon and co's army of who they're really running from - But unlike the White Walkers, the army of the 'south' have Wildfire, Dragons, and Dragonglass etc. Assuming that the 'unkillable' race are similar to the White Walkers, they won't be unkillable for very long.

I think this would be a nice twist on the ending, so that it's not just a big fuckin' army fighting against a bigger fuckin' army of the dead, and overcoming the odds like they almost always have done in past battles in the show.

Thoughts? Would something like this actually be possible?",5,0,False,self,,,,,

The plan of Littlefinger was solid. Remove the Boltons from power as asked by later Queen Cersei, put the Starks into power again, be the deciding factor in the battle. With Bran presumed dead, Sansa is the legitimate heir to Winterfell and the North and having Sansa at his side will technically give him the power to the North as well. It would've been the Vale (with Robin), North (with Sansa), and the Cersei's ""alliance"" on his side.

Now that Jon was proclaimed the KITNORF, what's his next game plan? He's an excellent player and he's good at improvisations. Do you think he'll help Jon or kill him to get the North? Jon's not really into the politics as he is more focused on the battle against WW so Littlefinger can easily do his tricks without being monitored.

I have a gut feeling too that Sansa will betray Jon for Littlefinger in S7. I know everyone will be angry at Sansa if this happens but it's not too far-fetched. We've seen Sansa betraying Arya for Joffrey in S1 and her saving Littlefinger from the Vale in S5(?). Sure she can be the manipulative chick we all expect her to be but the fact that Sansa hid the Vale support from Jon makes me wonder what her plans really are. Right now, we know she owes Littlefinger something and we've seen Sansa marry people she hated ""in order to survive"". Who knows. 

For sure, Sansa will play a big part in Littlefinger's plan in the future and with chaos still in play, what's the next move of Littlefinger?",34,6,False,self,,,,,

There's also a voice during his mutilation. We can assume that it's not from the sorcerer's voice from what Kinvara said. What we don't know is if Varys knows whose voice is it. Kinvara knows who s/he was for sure.

What did the s/he say? Why is Varys in horror just listening to Kinvara telling the story? Why is Varys being mutilated in the first place?

Do you think Varys' past will have a bigger effect in the story for S7? Do you think Kinvara is right that Dany is the 'Prince that was promised'? Is Kinvara also a very old woman like Melisandre?

Let me start by saying this: The showrunners and GRRM gave more depth to female characters than previous fantasy works, a thing that I respect. But what bothers me is that I find most of these characters annoying at times.

Starting with Cersei, everyone on this sub seems to consider her a true player of the game. But what did she acomplish on her own really? She was outplayed by Tyrion during the whole Season2 (even worse in the books). And since then she had spent her whole screentime arguing with Tywin, Jaime, Tyrion (and Moonboy for all we know). Things happen and she becomes ruler again (as Tommen's regent) but as Kevan said in the books: ''You are as unfit a ruler as you are a mother''. My problem with her is that she's dumb and doesn't want to admit it.

Im not gonna bother with a long thread of the rest of the characters so Im going to give you a summary of my opinion.
 
Dany - Great in the books, Mediocre in the show
Arya - Great in the show, Mediocre in the books
Sansa - Mediocre in the books, horrible in early seasons and mediocre in Seasons 4,5,6
Ygritte - Great in both
Margaery - Great in both
Shae - Tyrion's wits are smaller than his dick...
Brienne - Great in the books, Mary Sue in the show.
Catelyn - Great in both
Sand Sneks (that was on purpose) - Do I really need to go into details?
Mellisandre - Pretty good im both

Also Remember That: 
John Snow as we all know was declared King of the North at the end of season 6. 
John Snow is a Targaryen. 
The Targaryen's are known for inbreeding. 

My theory is that the Season 7 Finale will conclude with all seven kingdoms (the North (home to Winterfell), the Vale (home to The Eyrie), the Stormlands, the Reach, the Westerlands, the Iron Islands, and Dorne) will be united under the marriage of one King (John Snow) and one Queen (Deaneries), which will complete The Song of Fire and Ice.",24,0,False,self,,,,,

A Quick World Overview 


The world is basically like if you swapped Britain's spot on the map with Greece. And weirder. This land is an island called Westeros, and is where most things take place.  Scotland would be a frozen hell-hole with all sorts of monsters, demons, hillbillys, and zombies; much like the Scotland of today. There's a giant wall build between the north and southern lands to keep all the bad guys out. In the southern half of the island are 7 regions that make up a confederacy of sorts to form a nation called the 7 kingdoms, with it's capital at a city called King's Landing. There's a king in charge and everyone pretty much hates each other unless they've married off one of their daughters to form an alliance. To the east there is a sea called the Narrow Sea. It has some weird islands and stuff like the Aegean, and there's another big continent like asia minor to the east of it called Essos. It's mostly like desert and plains and stuff.  There's a couple independent cities along the coasts. To the interior is a great plains where hordes of mongolian horse bikers called the Darth Rocky ride around terrorizing and raping everyone. There's probably some other crazy stuff going on outside these lands, but nothing that is important to the story. Here is a map is you want to see what I'm talking about: [Map of Game of Thrones](https://quartermaester.info/)

In The Wilderness of Scotland:


The episode begins with three guys exploring the wild areas of frozen scotland looking for some hillbillys called ""Wildlings"". They find some body parts of dead wildlings arranged in a pattern, then a ""White Walker"" kills two of them. White walkers are these boney White zombie things that love murder, snow, and Iron Maiden. The third guy escapes and runs away like a coward. He is eventually captured for going AWOL. 

In Winterfall:

The episode cuts to Winterfall, the capital of the northernmost of the southern kingdoms. Here a family called the Starks are in charge. The head honcho is Boromir Stark. Everyone calls him Ned or Nedward for some unexplained reason. His wife is Catlyn Stark, is from another kingdom called Riverrun. Her maiden name was Tullie and she was wed to Boromir to form an alliance. They seem to get along though. They also have a bunch of fucking kids. 

Rob Stark is the oldest son. He's pretty cool. He a badass warrior, and has good leadership skills for a young man. You would guess in his early 20's but in this world everyone looks 7 years older than they are. Then Santa the eldest Daughter. She's almost old enough to be married off for an alliance, so you would think about 17 or 18, but in apparently in Westeros the age of consent is like 12. She's kinda prissy and bitchy. Then there's Bran Stark. He's just a kid who like climbing. He's not very interesting. Arya Stark is the youngest daughter, she's a total tomboy caught up in medieval princesses world. Then the youngest is Rickon Stark. I don't think you ever even see him, and I'm not even sure he really exists, but the other characters mention him from time to time.
The Starks didn't learn their lesson in having 5 fucking kids but also took in two more. Theon Greatjoy is from some viking island. His people invaded years ago and Boromir defeated them. He took Theon as a trophy of his victory. Theon is good buddies with Robb Stark and probably around the same age. John Snow is the 7th kid living in the Stark household. He is just a little younger than Robb and Theon. He's also Boromir's bastard kid, and Catlyn hates him. All the women I know think he's panty-soakingly hot. I don't understand why, he's pretty whiny and kind of a wuss.

Boromir then beheads the guy who ran away from Scotland for the crime of cowardice and makes all his kids watch. The deserter warned them of White Walkers before he lost his head. Bran asks his dad about the White Walkers and Boromir tells him not to be a pussy. On their way back home, the Stark men find a dead deer that was killed by a big-ass wolf called a direwolf. The deer also killed the direwolf back, leaving it's puppies abandoned. The stark kids each keep a direwolf puppy because the wolf is a sacred deity or something. John Snow gets the runt. Only Theon doesn't get one, which is pretty unfair if you ask me.


In King's Landing:

King's Landing is the capital of the empire. The current King is Robert Brathion. He's king because he  usurped the last king, who allegedly was really mad at everyone all the time. He's a no-nonsense fat guy who like banging whores, drinking, and hunting boars. My kind of guy. His wife is Cersee Brathion, from the Lancaster family. She's a total bitch and their marriage is loveless. They have three kids: Jeffery, Marcella, and Tommy. Jeffery is everything evil in a human being. He is cruel, cowardly, and a total spoiled-brat. You'll hate him forsure. You pretty much never see the other two kids. Jamie Lancaster is Cersee's suave and douchey twin brother. His nickname is ""Kingslayer"" which sounds totally badass. He has a very close relationship with his sister. Tyrion Lancaster is the other brother of Cersee. He's the dwarf, and is literally the the best character on this show. He's witty, funny, and drinks heavily. He is constantly tormented for being a midget, even by his on family, despite the fact that he's the best member of it.
John Erin, The King's right hand man, cleverly called the ""Hand of the King"", has died. I think they said it was to a fever, but it's kinda sketchy at best and probably a murder. Cersee and Jamie talk about secrets dying with him - Their secrets we are left to assume.


In Winterfall again:

Ravens carry text messages around the kingdom, because carrier pigeons aren't cool enough for medieval europe. One arrives with a message informing the Starks of John Erin's death and that the King himself is coming for a visit. When the King arrives, he and Boromir chat like old friends, because apparently they are. He asks Boromir to take him to the crypt beneath the city, so he can pay his respects to Boromir's dead sister, who he used to love.


Just some background to alleviate confusion:

The Robert Barthian, before he was king,  used to love Boromir's sister, Liana. I think he was engaged to her as well. Anyways the king at the time was from the Targarian family, and was known as the mad king. One of the other Targarian family members stole Liana and ran off with her. Boromir's dad and older brother went to the the king to ask ""WTF, give us back daughter/sister."" The Mad King, being angry at everyone all the time, killed both of them. Because fo these events, Boromir and Robert started a rebellion, which they eventually won, leaving robert to be the new king. Liana died in the fighting or something. It never really says how, but she's dead. Oh and also, the Mad King was Killed by Jamie Lancaster after their family hoped in the civil war. He was one of the kings guards at the time and stabbed him in the back. That's why Robert married Cersee, to make the Lancasters allies.


Still in Winterfall:

The Fat King Robert tells Boromir that he wants to marry his brat son Jeffery to Santa to solidify their alliance and also to make Boromir the new Hand of the King. Boromir reluctantly accepts. Then the dwarf is getting laid in the whore house, and you get to see lots of boobs. It's pretty sweet.


In Pentos:

Pentos is a free city-state on the coast of Essos. When the civil war ended all of the Targarians were killed by the Lancasters. Only Two managed to escape to Pentos, the platinum blonde siblings Vizerese and Dinnerese. Vizerese the older brother, is a snarky, creepy douche. Dinnerese, the younger sister, is hot as fuck and you get to see her naked. 
Vizerese is trying to get back the Throne of the seven kingdoms. His plan is to sell off his hot younger sister as a wife/sex-slave to Carl Drone-go, chief of a mongolian mongolian horse biker gang called the Darth Rocky, in exchange for the use of his army. Carl is the ultimate bad-ass. In the Darth Rocky culture, you grow a ponytail and you don't cut it until you lose a fight, and Carl's pony tail goes down to like his ankles because he's never lost a fight. Dinnerese says she doesn't want to marry him, but Vizerese DGAFs and threatens to let all his horses bang her if she doesnt.


In Winterfall:

There's a big feast/party for the King. John Snow ask's Boromir's brother Benji, if he can join him at ""the wall"". Benji says no because Snow is still too much of a pussy, but hell talk with Boromir about it later. As Boromir and Catlyn are readying for bed, a letter arrives from Catlyn's sister- who was married to John Erin. The letter says she has fled the Captial back to her home in the Erie because she believes her husband was murdered by the Lancasters.


Somewhere in Essos: 

Carl and DInnerese have their wedding ceremony. In Darth Rocky culture, a wedding sucks if less than 3 people die from fights. Dinnerese is given the gift of three petrified dragon eggs. Then a man named Jora Mormon who is from Westeros, and offeres to serve as her guide in the Darth Rocky world, since he has been living there and understands it. Carl gives her a horse. They ride off together, and Carl bangs her on a cliff by the ocean. It's revealed the only English Carl speaks is the word ""Nope"" and you get to see her boobs again and it's totally rad.


In Winterfall:

Boromir, the King, and a bunch of the men go off to hunt boars. Bran Stark climbs up a tower because he likes climbing, and sees through a window Jamie and Cersee Lancaster banging. That's right, some good old fashioned Medieval incest. Jamie catches him and throws him from the window. Roll Credits.

If this helped clear up anything for anyone with this often confusing show, or if you enjoyed it, let me know and I'll do a synopsis of the next episode. Thanks!

He died in Season 5. The man who you see walking around is not Jon Snow, it's Bran Stark from the future.

After witnessing Jon being murdered through weirwood.net, Bran Stark stayed beside Jon Snow, waiting for him to be resurrected by Melisandre's magic, hoping he would come back. But soon Bran realizes that Jon isn't coming back. He realizes that it was him all along. Like what he had done to Hodor, his destiny and purpose was there and the ink was dry. As he accepts his role in the war to come, he embraces his fate and resurrects Jon with wight magic (which turned out to be Children of the Forest magic that Bran could have harnessed) it and wargs into Jon's dead body.

It's possible that Jon will wield this sword at some point. Perhaps Melissandre presents it to Jon. Either way Eddard carried the sword back to house Dayne, and the sword is even seen along Lyanna's bedside before the reveal of baby Jon.

I recently read Sun Tzu's book The Art of War. I enjoyed it a lot, learning about stratagem in battle and how to not fear the outcome of an upcoming battle under certain circumstances. I'm going to break it up into multiple points to really try and convince you guys.

&gt; ""It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy's one, to surround him; if five to one, to attack him; if twice as numerous, to divide our army into two."" - The Art of War Chapter 4

The reason this relates is because in the battle of The Whispering Wood and also the retaking of Riverrun, Robb divides his army into two, tricking Tywin, (one of the most renowned battle Commanders ever to live by the way) into thinking he was foolishly attacking the Lannister army head on. To their surprise, he was actually fighting Jaime and beating a force larger than his own.

If you are not convinced Sun Tzu explicitly says in his book

&gt; ""All warfare is based on deception."" - The Art of War Chapter 2

Now you could argue that while Aegon took over almost the entire Seven Kingdoms with the exception of Dorne, Robb couldn't even beat the Lannisters. But if you have read the history of his Conquest you know that in the main battles of his Conquest like the Field of Fire the singular reason he won that battle was because he and his sisters rained fire on the Reach's army.

If every person who went to war had a huge ass dragon called Balerion the Dread, and his sisters had two huge ass dragons along with yours, your Conquest would be quite easy as Aegon's was.

Now, Sun Tzu was a real life super infamous battle Commander, he didn't have any dragons and neither did Robb Stark, so you should give more credit to Robb Stark then you might already.

&gt; ""Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple ere the battle is fought. The general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand. Thus do many calculations lead to victory, and few calculations to defeat: how much more no calculation at all! It is by attention to this point that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose."" - The Art of War Chapter 2

Now, think critically about the battles Robb Stark lead against the Lannister forces, in most of his battles he took the enemy completely by surprise, you can't do that if you haven't thought about what you were doing beforehand, in other words, he made a lot of calculations before his battles.

But did Aegon the Conqueror? not really. Black Harren refused to bend the knee, so Aegon decided to burn him, his subjects, families, and lots of innocents alive inside their castle. Hm, doesn't seem like he thought about that much and more accurately just ran into conflict because he was pissed he got refused.

Yet again at the Field of Fire, he just killed Lord Gardener and thousands if not tens of thousands of his soldiers, then just installed Lord Tyrell because Lord Tyrell bent the knee. I don't know about you but I'm seeing a recurring theme here, Aegon just killed anyone who didn't bend the knee, and yes while destroying your enemies is part of being a true battle Commander, Sun Tzu states,

&gt; ""Therefore in chariot fighting, when ten or more chariots have been taken, those should be rewarded who took the first. Our own flags should be substituted for those of the enemy, and the chariots mingled and used in conjunction with ours. The captured soldiers should be kindly treated and kept. This is called, using the conquered foe to augment one's own strength."" - The Art of War Chapter 3

Essentially, while you should take what is yours from the enemy after defeating them in a battle as is your's but also your soldiers right, keeping your enemies prisoner and treating them well, shows everyone else a certain kind of strength as a Commander. Aegon didn't treat his enemies kindly or capture them, he burned them.

Whereas in season two of the show, Lord Bolton offers to flay some of the prisoners, not really to get information, but because their prisons are overflowing from prisoners of battle. After this proposal, Robb Stark turns down Lord Bolton's offer (thank god) not only showing his humanity but his strength as a, you guessed it, Commander.

I could go on and on and on about why Robb is a better actual battle Commander than Aegon was just from Sun Tzu's book Art of War. If you don't think Sun Tzu is trustworthy, just look the guy up, he was insanely cool.",281,2102,False,self,,,,,

But it's kind of important to consider that part of the episode just as carefully as the part where he cowers beneath the glare of his dad while Gilly defends him.  And here's why:

Sure, there's a lot of people that have talked about whether it's good or bad for Gilly having defended Sam (she outed herself as a wildling for one, and she seems to be just another woman behind whose skirts Sam can hide, as his father seems to think he does).  But this scene, imho, is just a reminder of how Gilly inspires bravery in Sam.  Sam kills a White Walker... when it goes for Gilly and little Sam.  Sam kills a Thenn... when he's fraught with worry because Gilly's right there in the basement.  And now?

After the dinner in which things definitely do not go well for Sam, he's in Gilly's room to apologise for allowing his father to treat her the way he has (which in itself is a sign of an emotionally abused person but it's not like we didn't already know this) and to tell her he has to leave at first light.  Little Sam seems to feel something is up because he's restless, and after Sam and Gilly share a kiss you see how utterly devastated Sam is as he says his goodbyes and leaves Gilly in her room.  Gilly just loosk stunned, but she instantly turns to tuck in her son, who is her first concern...
And then Sam comes back into the room with a determined look on his face, surprising Gilly (and don't tell me you weren't surprised as well).  He tells Gilly to pack her things and then explains that they belong together, all of them - him, Gilly and little Sam.  It's not that he doesn't trust his father to treat Gilly well, I believe - he was perfectly content leaving them behind only a minute or two before - but he has already been forced by his father to leave his family behind once and he refuses to do so again.  Gilly and Sam are his family now, he's said it and proven it many times now, and he refuses to be without them.  Gilly gives him strength, confidence, and warmth, and he grasps those with both hands.

""So what about Heartsbane?!"", I hear you cry... why did Sam take Heartsbane?  There's a number of theories in my mind for that, but the most prominent one after rewatching the episode is the most banal one.  Sam doesn't look up with the rest of the family while Randyll talks about it... until the mention that it's Valyrian steel.  Like, the kind of steel that can kill a White Walker.  And even then, I don't think he looks at it and goes 'I'm gonna take that with me to the Citadel!'... his look is more like 'oh my god, I had no idea my family had a sword that can kill the Walkers!'.  I think he takes Heartsbane on a hunch, not to 'show his father up' or to 'take his birthright that his father wants to deny him' but just... because it's there and it can help him.

(might I also mention that this is the first time you see Sam voluntarily pick up a sword?  And add the fact that he also takes the scabbard, and sheathes the sword seconds after he takes it?  This sword, to him, is an item he does not intend to put to its most obvious use, or to use as a trophy, but to use in his research.)

But most importantly are those five words he speaks when he sheathes the sword, really.  When Gilly asks Sam whether his father would come for the sword he's now effectively stealing, Sam answers ""He can bloody well try!"".  Sam said those words before, when Jon (light-heartedly or seriously) said the Citadel would make him swear off women too.  Back then, Sam spoke them unthinkingly and without a second's pause, still bolstered by the fact that he and Gilly are now what he considers 'properly together'; here, he says the words with determination and strength, clearly understanding that his actions will have consequences and he's ready to face them.  He's ready to face his father, even if he couldn't face him before.  He was ready to stand up to the order of maesters concerning Gilly; now he's standing up to his father concerning basically everything.

Sam stands up to his father and basically takes the one thing his father values but he does not from his family home... when Gilly is upset about how his father treats him.  For himself, he'd take the abuse for the rest of his life; for Gilly, he won't stand for it.

...I'm not initiated in the books (yet) so feel free to throw facts from the books at me to disprove me, or facts from the TV series for that matter.  I live to learn, after all.  But consider this is just my thoughts on the matter.",11,3,False,self,,,,,

They had ships so they could've just sailed up there, even if the Neck was flooded at that point. Wouldn't control over a giant ice wall be a huge bone of contention and at least the basis of 1 or 2 wars?

I think the Neck was flooded during the Andal Invasion not the war with the FM. Moat Cailin would've needed to already have been built in order for the COTF to use it to call down the Hammer of the Waters.  The COTF and FM are living in harmony after the Pact. The FM at Moat Cailin ask the COTF for help in stopping these ""new comers"" and give up the stronghold to destruction for this cause. COTF flood the Neck- could explain why Andals may not have been Wall savvy because they were greatly held back from even getting up North. ??",4,6,False,self,,,,,

I truly believe that Tywin aided in the plot to kill Joffrey.

*For the best understanding of the theory, I advise you watch all scenes*.

&gt;Tywin: This is a **plot. Plots are not public knowledge**. And the *Tyrells won't cary this out until after Joffrey's wedding*. We need to act first and kill this union in its crib. We need to find Sansa stark a new husband.

[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVfClyxJOHA
)
Now, for this theory to make sense, I have to go all the way back when the Lannisters and the Tyrells first formed a relationship.

Tyrion is Hand in King's Landing, in Tywin's rule, and Tywin is at Harenhall (where is in the books, Roose Bolton is in Harenhall while he's conspiring with Tywin, while Tywin is off fighting in the North).

Stannis Baratheon is planning to attempt to take over King's Landing, and after killing Renly Baratheon (who is married to Margaery Tyrell and is actually a gay lover to her brother, Loras) it gave the Tyrells a stronger reason to fight against Stannis.  After hearing Stannis assassinating Renly in the books, Tyrion sends Littlefinger to Ser Loras in order to try and gain his army of ten thousand while in the show Tyrion sends Petyr to Catelyn Stark about the proposal.

[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9jac7Qg9w4)

Later in the series, Lord Tywin reveals to Cersei that the Lannister gold mines have been run dry for the past three years.  House Tyrell is the second wealthiest family in Kings Landing.  Petyr Baelish is the master of coin, and I believe he has known about the Lannisters predicament since the beginning (in the books this does not happen, but I think it gives a stronger reason for Tywin to link up with the Tyrells).  If House Tyrell is the second wealthiest/most powerful house, then I do not doubt that Littlefinger would take advantage of this situation to get Tywin to comply. And Tywin would be stupid to refuse a marriage between the Houses, because that would be the surest way to keep peace between the two houses as well as sustaining the Lannister's power.

Littlefinger knew Catelyn wanted her daughters back, the proposal by Tyrion among Tywin, Catelyn and Robb is the exchange of Jaime for Arya and Sansa. Catelyn complied by sending off Jaime to King's Landing so she can have her daughters back, while Robb would obviously refuse this proposal out of honor of his fathers death. Tywin also wants his son back, so the only logical thing for Tywin to do is to agree with the release of her daughter as well as killing Robb off, after the release of Jaime, to ensure peace.

**Fast forward to the Battle of Blackwater**

Tyrion has taken out a good portion of Stannis' fleet.  Enough to delay them from entering the Red Keep to which *both* Tywin Lannister's fleet *as well* as Tyrell's ten thousand strong finish off the Battle of Blackwater.

Before Tyrion and Sansa's arranged wedding, the Tyrells were going to marry Sansa to Ser Loras to secure the North. However, Tywin got in the way of that by marrying Tyrion to Sansa so the Tyrells didn't overstep their power.

The day after the Battle of Blackwater, there's a post-battle ceremony. Tywin entered the court on his horse after his horse shit, he receives his title as Hand of the King and then he leaves the court like he does not give a fuck. Littlefinger is granted Harenhall (which was of Tywin's plan), Ser Loras asks for Joffrey to marry Margaery, to which Cersei and Maester Pycelle dismiss Joffrey's commitment to Sansa, and after Joffrey agrees to mary her, Ser Loras asks for a place in the King's guard, which is granted.  

Now, listen to the conversation Tyrion is having with Tywin and Cersei in regards to refusing Sansa's marriage to the Tyrells:  

&gt;Tyrion: Sansa is key to the North *The Tyrell army is helping us to win this war.  Do you really think it is wise to refuse them?* 

&gt;Tywin: *There's nothing to refuse.  This is a* **plot. Plots are not public knowledge**. And the *Tyrells won't cary this out until after Joffrey's wedding*. We need to act first and kill this union in its crib. We need to find Sansa stark a new husband.

Then Tyrion realizes that they are to marry Sansa off to him. Tywin knew the Purple Wedding would happen. He had foreknowledge of a ""plot"" that will ""happen after Joffrey's wedding"".

**What would Tywin's motive be to kill off Joffrey?**

Tywin is all about sustaining family image.  The very first scene he was ever in, he is quoted: *""Family is what lives on, Family is all that matters""*.  And Tywin needs an heir to Casterly Rock.  The thing is, in his family's current situation, his direct family's heritage of Casterly Rock is at stake.

Jaime swore an oath to king's guard and when you swear an oath to King's Guard, you can't *marry*, so no offspring (that can't be bastards), and you must disregard *all* inheritance, making Tyrion rightful heir to Casterly Rock *which Tywin did not want*. Tywin's grandchildren are Baratheons by name, so they can't inherit it either. Since Tywin did not want Tyrion to inherit Casterly Rock, he wanted the possibility that Tyrion would produce an heir (since it is possible for a dwarf to have a normal baby) or have Jaime to give up the King's Guard to serve at Casterly Rock.  Cersei could still produce an heir through Ser Loras, but it is known that Ser Loras is a ""sword swallower""/gay, so he would want Tyrion to produce an heir.

At Tyrion's wedding to Sansa, Tyrion gets quite drunk and Tywin commands Tyrion to consummate the marriage and produce an heir  *through any means necessary* (including rape) . Later, Tyrion gets upset at Joffrey and threatens to cut off his dick:

[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15zQAdNoRck) S3E8

I think Tywin considered this as a possible opportunity to get rid of Tyrion at the time since Tyrion just openly threatened the King in front of many.

Joffrey started soiling the Lannister name by acting the way he was and dragging the Lannisters into war and getting Jaime captured (Tywin's only hope for Casterly Rock), by unnecessarily beheading Ned Stark. The war Joffrey caused is why Tywin sent for Tyrion to serve as King's Hand (in his place) to rule over Joffrey at the end of season one. The war also halted the gold mines at Casterly Rock, putting them in debt. Tywin sees Joffrey solely responsible for all of this, especially Jaime's capture, and soley responsible for putting the family's name at risk. 

Tywin's only concern of the entire war was that Jaime was captured by Robb (remember: Family is all that lives on, Family is all that matters):

&gt;Tywin: *""They have my son!""*

[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-5-qlj8aZg) S1E10

&gt;Tyrion:(knocks cup off table, breaking it) *""There's your peace. Joffrey slaughtered that when he chopped off Ned Stark's Head""*

&gt;Kevan: *something something Casterly Rock*

&gt;Tywin: *""THEY HAVE MY SON!""* Get out, all of you. (proceeds to name Tyrion Hand of King)

When Tywin got to Kings landing and the Red Wedding happened (which Tywin planned), Tywin took over Tyrion's spot as Hand of the King and, at this point, pretty much assumed rule over the Kingdom. You can see Tywin's assumption of ruling over the Kingdom in two different scenes.

The first scene Tywin strides up to Joffrey sitting on the Iron Throne (with no one in the court) while the King's Guard followed Tywin, juxtaposing Joffrey's lack of King's Guard.  You can see who has the power in this scene:

S3E7: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tk5hKomP4MA)

(note this is only part of the scene that's proving my point about Tywin not giving a shit about Joffre's rule as king, but the entire scene is important):

&gt;Tywin: I'll see to it that you'll be consulted *whenever it is necessary*.

*walks away, then turns around as if he completely forgot*

&gt;Tywin: *Your grace*

Then there's the scene

And then the King's Counsel announced the death of Robb Stark happened and then this happened:

Tywin hinting that he'll aid in poisoning Joffrey: ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRrV1ff33iM))

*after Tyrion threatens Joffrey and Joffrey exclaims I AM THE KING*:

&gt;Tywin: Any man who must say ""I am the King"" is no true king.  *I'll make sure you'll understand that once I won your war for you*.

&gt;Joffrey: *My father won the war.  He killed Rhaegar, he took the crown!* **While you hid on a Casterly Rock!**

Tywin stares down Joffrey.

&gt;Tywin: The King is tired, see him to his chambers.

&gt;Cersei: Come, you *have a wedding to plan*, you must rest.

&gt;Tywin: Grand Maester, perhaps some *Essence of Nightshade* to help him *sleep*.

&gt;Joffrey: I *am not* **TIRED!**

It is noted that Essence of the Nightshade was going to be used by Cersei to commit suicide at the Battle of Blackwater in the show and foreshadowed Joffrey and possibly her own death in the scene where Bronn is singing Rains of Castamere. And when Cersei is about to kill herself and Tommen, in strides in Tywin to save the day, which Cersei drops the Essence of Nightshade.

In the books, Tywin mentions that there was another king that often liked to remind people that he was the King: the Mad King. Who Tywin hated dearly.

This scene happened at the season 3 finale, then the Purple Wedding happened *two episodes later in the next season*.

And then, after the conversation when the counsel found out Robb and Cat being dead and Joffrey is escorted out:

&gt;""The boy is thirteen. There is time yet."" Lord Tywin paced to the window. That was unlike him; he *was more upset than he wished to show*. **""He requires a sharp lesson.""**

I would like for y'all to watch the Purple Wedding all over again.  

The opening scene to it is a conversation between Olenna and Tywin, which she said:

&gt;Olenna: *Wars are rather expensive. The Iron Bank will have its due*

Casterly Rock's gold mines have almost gone dry, as well as halted by the war, three years ago. The Throne's debt is also the Lannister's debt. Tywin needed the Tyrell's relationship because the Tyrells are the 2nd richest house, and they have Daenerys threatening to cross the sea, and the Stormborn in the Iron Islands threatening a rebellion.

[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylnGorj9oXk)

Someone plays **the Rains of Castamere* to Joffrey.

[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4q6PyoW5JU)

Tywin once used the Rain of Castamere to strike fear in a castle he was raiding and would play it to remind himself how powerful he is. Olenna Tyrell could possibly have done this as well, since she did remark:

&gt;*I do so hope he plays 'The Rains of Castamere.' It's been an hour, I've forgotten how it goes.*

Joffrey embarrasses Tyrion and then tries to remind Tyrion that he is the king.  Margaery breaks the tension by pointing out the pidgeon pie.  (Interestingly enough, birds are heavily associated with Sansa. Joffrey beheaded a pigeon with his new Valyrian steel sword, to which he commented that *""Every time I use it, it'll be like cutting off Ned Stark's head all over again""*).  And then when he was eating the pie and is reminded about Tyrion not kneeling, he calls for Tyrion for his wine to wash down the pie, to which you can see Tywin visibly pissed off.

Joffrey drinks the poison and starts choking. After Cersei goes after Joffrey while he's dying, and the king's guard on the right side of the tables sprints to check on him, you can see Tywin covering up Tommen's eyes (the only one left at the Lannister table besides Sansa) before Ser Dontos escorts Sansa off.

After Sansa is escorted off, Tywin steps up to Joffrey and observes Joffrey (which is where the scene ends):

[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifx0Fg_drBI).

And then in the beginning of the next episode, Cersei questions where Sansa is and then Tywin commands ""Find her. Bar the gates of the city, *seize every ship in the harbor*.  **No one** leaves the capital!""

Ser Dontos leads Sansa to a boat which they rowed out to Littlefinger's boat, which is hiding in a misty cloud.  Only to find out Littlefinger was part of the plot of killing Joffrey, and Ser Dontos was helping Sansa to get payed.  Wouldn't Tywin commanding that every ship in the harbor be seized only suggest that he may not want anyone seeing or going after Ser Dontos taking Sansa into Littlefinger's boat in the fog?

**Tywin is a Kinslayer?**

There are a couple things to consider here.  Joffrey is Baratheon by name, not Lannister.  I don't think Tywin would care *as much* unless Joffrey is named *Lannister* (cause, again, *Family/name is all that lives on*). Joffrey is also known, or at least possibly considered, by almost everyone in King's landing as a product of incest. Tywin knows this, which is why Tywin tried to get Ser Loras to marry Cersei, to produce an heir that everyone knows is not incest (in the scene where Tywin announces Tyrion and Cersei's wedding to Sansa and Loras respectively, Tywin told Cersei that *he wanted to put an end to the incestuous rumors that was soiling the Lannister name*).  Tywin just turned a blind eye to Jaime and Cersei to pretend that it didn't happen or he didn't care. Maybe he didn't care as long as it isn't public, because Tywin was all about not bedding whores, but he ended up bedding Shae in secret. 

Whenever they had Joffrey's body in the sept after his death, Cersei, Tommen, and Tywin were in the room. Tywin discusses to Tommen on what makes a good king.  During which, Tywin said:

&gt;A wise young king knows what he knows and knows what he doesn't. You're young.  *A wise young king listens to his counselors and heeds their advice until he comes of age.*  And the wisest kings continues to listen to them long afterwards.  Your brother wasn't a wise king.  Your brother wasn't a good king.  **If he had been, perhaps he'd still be alive.**  *Now, as the king, you have to marry.  To further the family line.*

[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doY0IjisBlk)

Tommen is an easier pawn to control to Tywin, while Joffrey was a loose cannon that did as he pleased.

**Why would Tywin help Sansa?**

The proposal from season 2 by Tyrion was for Robb to release Jaime in exchange for Arya and Sansa.  Robb refused this, so Catelyn took up the offer and released Jaime to bring her daughters back.  Tywin is a man of his word, so why not help Sansa?

Tywin also wanted Tyrion to produce an heir. Sansa is Tywin's plan B. There's a chance that the child will not become a dwarf (fifty percent chance by the punnet square) and plus Tywin never knew whether or not Tyrion actually bedded her, and he hoped for him to produce an heir. Tywin has greater hope getting Sansa to produce an heir through Tyrion than getting Ser Loras to bed Cersei, which is Tywin's plan C.

**Why did Tywin spend so much money on the wedding?**

As Syrio Forel said: *""Never do what is expected""*

Tywin spending so much money on this wedding would only serve as a smokescreen to him aiding the plot. Why *would* Tywin spend so much money only to kill his grandson? Not to mention half of the wedding was payed by the Lannisters, from *the throne's money*, and the other half is payed off by the Tyrells.  Even having the dwarfs fight as a play was arranged by Littlefinger.  All of this pointing to both the houses and Petyr Baelish having ties into the plot.

And the cherry on top of this whole theory:

Olenna speaks with Tywin Lannister [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrkZQQ_5ywU). The scene opens with Tywin Lannister pouring wine into two cups, after the Purple Wedding, giving one to Olenna while talking about the Betrothal of Ser Loras to Cersei. Tywin is always a man of foreshadowing/symbolism.

Remember how the marriages were played out in the beginning.  In the books, Littlefinger rides to Ser Loras Tyrell for help at the Battle of Blackwater, Tywin, his troups, and the Tyrells arrive when the Battle of Blackwater happens.  Then Margaery is arranged to mary King Joffrey, and Ser Loras is to be King's Guard, while Tywin gave Littlefinger Harenhall.

In the show, Littlefinger rides out to talk to Catelyn Stark of Tyrion's proposal with the exchange between Tywin and Robb.  Robb will obviously refuse, so this is why it is brought to Catelyn.  Littlefinger then rides to Tywin about the proposal.

Olenna Tyrell poisons Joffrey, Tyrion is blamed as well as Sansa by association. They are both set up. Olenna wanted gain power over the throne, Littlefinger helped plan this so he could help Sansa for obvious reasons, and Tywin wanted to sustain the family name while also keeping his end of the deal by helping the release of Sansa.

At the trial, before Tyrion's final verdict, Jaime reveals that Tywin knew Tyrion didn't murder Joffrey and that the court was a farce by Cersei to make sure Tyrion was sentenced whether or not he was innocent. In fact, Tywin rigged the judges.  He assigned Mace Tyrell as one judge, and he bribed Prince Oberyn Martel with Gregor Clegane's life as well as a spot on the King's Counsel in return of being the third judge to convict Tyrion.

Jaime didn't want risk Tyrion's death, so he told Tywin that he would take down is oath to King's Guard in exchange for Tyrion's survival.  Tywin happily agreed and told Jaime that he would rule over Casterly Rock and Tyrion would take the black, *only if* Jaime were to leave the King's guard and take up Casterly Rock.

Tywin knew about Shae all along. Cersei found out about Shae whenever she learned that Shae was a handmaiden, wasn't noble born, and couldn't curtsey while she climbed the ranks to handmaiden at King's Landing. Cersei would use Shae against Tyrion by paying Shae to say that *""Tyrion wanted to please Sansa by getting revenge for Ned Stark.  So he planned to poison the king""*, There are theories that Shae was Tywin's to begin with, but from what I know and my current research they *seem* speculative.  It may have more solid grounding, I do not know.

Also, note the conversation Jaime has with Catelyn Stark, when he is Robb's captive, in regards to vows:

[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpD47mmlei4)

&gt;Catelyn to Jaime: You are no knight.  Youve forsaken every vow youve took.

&gt;Jaime: So many vows.  They make you swear and swear. Defend the king, obey the king, obey your father, protect the innocent, defend the weak, *but what if your father despises the king?*  **What if the king massacres the innocent?**

Joffrey is often referred to in the books as King Aerys III, and he has been equated to the Mad King in several other instances.

Given all of these things that had happened, I think it's more likely than not that Tywin helped plot the Purple Wedding. Tywin did not like Joffrey, and Tywin wanted Tyrion dead from his birth.  Tywin only called Tyrion his son when he wanted to use him. Because the mines have ran dry and the Lannisters are in debt, Tywin also needed House Tyrell's strength to ensure the Lannister's survival. Joffrey only put a stain on the family name as well as putting Tywin's line at risk.

**TL;DR: Tywin hates Joffrey for soiling the family name and putting his family line at risk, Tywin needed the Tyrells for power/support of the family, Tywin fulfilled Tyrion's proposal to Catelyn/Robb Stark by getting rid of Sansa, in exchange with Catelyn for Jaime, as well as killing off Robb to put the north at bay**",20,14,False,self,,,,,

While it seems really cool in theory, every time I come across it, I cringe. 

It just seems paradoxical that a dragon (an embodiment of fire) could be susceptible to the Night King's magic (which is the embodiment of ice). Dragons literally produce fire, which, as we've seen, is the one thing that destroys the White Walkers' zombie magic. Additionally, the WWs are vulnerable to Dragon glass (aka Obsidian) which is a product of rocks melted and the rapidly cooling in volcanoes and volcanic eruptions-- again, fire and extreme heat. Dragon glass, then, could be literally created by dragons, melting and rapidly cooling certain minerals. Furthermore, Jon showed us in s5e8 'Hardhome' that WWs can be killed by Valyrian Steel. GRRM has confirmed that the creation to Valyrian steel has something to do with magic and I wouldn't be greatly surprised if it also had something to do with dragon fire which is known to be hotter than most other fires (eg. melting the walls at Harrenhall). Other than that, there's not a lot of information about how it's forged, so that's still just a theory for now.

Lets say that the WWs do manage to kill one of the dragons (which seems possible, even likely). Does that likewise indicate that the Night King would be able to bring it back as a wight? I think for it to make sense the show would have to expand a lot more on the nature of magic. We know that the WWs were created by a shard of Dragon Glass to the heart by the Children of the Forest, so I could see something there that would possibly reconcile the storyline and make it more plausible. But I just don't think that the show has time to get into all that in the 13 remaining episodes. I'd love to hear any ideas I may have missed that make this theory make more sense or just to hear other people's thoughts.",7,8,False,self,,,,,

Well, Lyanna Mormont gave a great speech but I don't really think that would be enough to convince the Northern lords. There is a pretty good reason though, but the show left it out. On their way to the Red Wedding, Robb mentions that he hasn't gotten Jeyne Westerling Stark (Talisa in the show) pregnant yet. He wonders what will happen if he should die before he has an heir and discusses the issue with Catelyn.

&gt;Jon is the only brother that remains to me. Should I die without issue, I want him to succeed me as King in the North. I had hoped you would support my choice.

When Catelyn objects that he is a bastard he reminds her that kings can legitimize bastards. She still objects of course, but he isn't really interested in her opinion on the subject and later in the chapter calls the Northern lords together to make a proclamation on the subject (though the chapter ends before it's explicitly stated what he said, but it's not a stretch to assume he legitimized Jon Snow and made him his heir).

This isn't mentioned in the show at all, but it adds tons of legitimacy to Jon Snow's claim as King in the North knowing that the previous king had named him as his heir and legitimized him.",29,46,False,self,,,,,

What if Lyanna and Arthur were in love. Rhaegar, unable to bear the sadness of his best friend as the woman he loved was being married off to man she didn't care for, ""took"" her and along with Arthur, got her to safety. 

Everything that happened at the tower of joy would still fit (Robert would have killed the kid no matter who the father was) it would also make Arthur's presence there much more appropriate and explain his lack of animosity towards Ned. 

The only reason I'm even suggesting this, is I think it would be quite appropriate for the second Long-Night to be ended by the Dawn (I'm assuming we can all agree that Jon would be worthy of being considered Sword of the Morning). Dawn = Lightbringer

In the show they present the different religions. But it seems to me atleast that they have gone out of their way to show the Lord of Light as the religion with the most substantial amount of proof. 

However in the books, they make a point to say that ghost seems to belong to the old gods due to looking like a weirwood. This convinces him to stay in the watch and leads him on the path he has gone down today. Theres also more going on when it comes to that religion.

My question is this: Can someone explain what is going on with this? Is there supposed ti be more then one true religion? I feel like if the Lord of Light is true, and the old gods are just a myth, it kind of takes away from a lot of stuff that is talked about. 

But the red priests claim there is only 1 true religion. So what gives? Am I missing something?

If not for his revenge boner, he would've easily killed the most feared man in Westeros.

Anyway, right now we lost a few top tier fighters. Oberyn of course. Jaime lost his right hand. Barristan's dead (and old). The Mountain's a zombie. Drogo's dead. 

The people who can take the honor are Bronn, Tormund Giantsbane, Daario Naharis, Brienne Tarth, Sandor Clegane, and Jon Snow.

Bronn - Sure he is a ""dirty"" fighter but I argue that his battles are between life and death. It's not a fight for the sake of fighting (Jaime in most cases). He easily killed the best fighter of the Vale (I believe he is since Lysa chose him personally and we know how much Lysa wants Tyrion killed). He didn't even have any injury in the BoBlackwater wherein they were outnumbered before Tywin's forces arrived. He gained the respect of Jaime Lannister, a former squire of Ser Arthur Dayne, and considered as top 3 fighter in Westeros before his hand was cut.

We saw Jon spitting on a Thenn during the battle in Castle Black. Well, if he didn't Ygritte would definitely save her anyway but still. It's worth noting.

Tormund - he is a mad man. A beast. That's the way he is. He will kill the enemies with strength and incredible speed for his size. Though he doesn't have an armor. 1 mistake and he may be done. He also didn't have much skilled opponents before. So with his size and speed, he already had the advantage in his area.

Daario - He's pretty much the Bronn of Essos. However, we haven't seen much fighters in Essos so we couldn't really say he is one of the best. He is very skilled of course and had a lot of battles before but then Jorah's a freaking badass in Essos too. And I believe Jorah is just a regular legit knight in Westeros. So yeah.

Brienne - she is definitely the best female fighter around. Maybe in history. We don't know. She defeated a number of decent fighters (Loras, Jaime, Hound) but if we see the situation of when it happened, it's not that impressive. The win against Loras is legit  I believe. though Loras is just a ""skilled"" warrior but definitely not in the elites. Well, that's just what I think the writers want him portrayed. Jaime was in chains when they fought AFAIK. He was also a prisoner for months so he only get little food and very unhealthy at that time. Same with the Hound who have a wound he wouldn't want be burned. Nevertheless, she's a great fighter.

Hound - I think in the current timeline, he's slowly becoming healthier which is a good sign. Though as Beric said, he's not getting any younger. He might be slower than before but of course the strength is still there. He is skilled and still a top fighter in Westeros.

Jon - He had a lot of battles in his young age. Had a lot of experiences already. He's good at improvising in fights and very skilled fighter. Though the thing about him is he is a generic fighter. A quintessential fighter and that makes him look ordinarily good. He is young, fit, brave, and skilled. All the good traits. I don't know why this is a con but it makes him more generic  which makes him unspecially good.



edit: sorry I forgot about Grey Worm!! He is also the best unsullied fighter in Essos as well. But we haven't really seen him fight that much.",70,14,False,self,,,,,

That honour falls to someone else, Jon Snow.

The Targaryen crown was inherited patrilineally (meaning from father to the eldest living son) and so, had Rhaegar out-lived his father, Aerys II, the crown would naturally have fallen to him. As it happened, however, Rhaegar was killed at the battle of the Trident before his father died in the Sack of Kings Landing. In this situation, the crown then moves on to the next heir. Who this is varies depending on a) whether the original heir had any children, or b) whether the original heir had any siblings.

At the close of Roberts rebellion, Rheager had one younger brother, Viserys, and would soon have a younger sister, Daenerys, but he also had a son: Jon Snow. And so, with the death of Aerys II at Kings Landing the crown *did not* pass to Aerys second son as many, including Viserys himself, believed, but to Rhaegars son instead.

Jon Snow was, at least for the small period of time between Aerys IIs death and Roberts claiming of the throne, ruler of the Seven Kingdoms - the last Targaryen king.

The following is from the [ASOIAF Wiki regarding the Azor Ahai prophecy](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Azor_Ahai/Theories):
According to the prophecy, as recounted by Melisandre, these are the indicators of the coming of Azor Ahai:


-After a long summer, when the stars bleed and the cold breath of darkness falls heavy on the world

-Variant: When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers

-He shall be born again amidst smoke and salt

-He shall wake dragons out of stone

-He shall draw from the fire a burning sword, Lightbringer



If Azor Ahai is the same as the prince that was promised:

-He is born of the line of Aerys II and Rhaella, according to the woods witch

-According to Maester Aemon, the word used to describe the prince in the prophecy was a gender-neutral word. While all assumed that the prince must be male, Aemon recently came to believe the prophecy could point to a female as well.



According to Benerro:

-Azor Ahai will make the world anew

-Azor Ahai will triumph over darkness will bring a summer that will never end

-Death itself will bend its knee, and all those who die fighting in Azor Ahai's cause shall be reborn



Some additional info I've found:

-Archmaester Marwyn recalls that according to the prophecy, the prince would be ""Born amidst salt and smoke, beneath a bleeding star.""

-Maester Aemon and Rhaegar both believe that ""the dragon must have three heads,""



Some of this won't apply to my theory, but I wanted to show all of the supposed criteria in case someone gathers their own theory from this.


So, the evidence for **Jon Snow** being Azor Ahai is pretty well-known. He was born under a ""bleeding star"" (Dawn, after Ned's fight with Ser Arthur Dayne), he's on the front lines against the White Walkers (""the cold breath of darkness"" and ""the darkness gathers""), Longclaw could be considered a ""burning sword"" since it's Valyrian steel and there's clearly a connection to dragons there, he's born from the line of Aerys II through Rhaegar, and he's literally been brought back to life or ""born again"" (at least in the show). 


Now there's also a lot of evidence towards **Daenerys Targaryen** being Azor Ahai. 
Aemon believes the translation of the prophecy, which uses the Valyrian word for ""dragon"", is incorrect in calling for a prince, as dragons have no gender, so a woman is just as likely to be Azor Ahai. She was metaphorically ""reborn"" in the funeral pyre of Khal Drogo, so that definitely covers smoke. One could also say that her journey across the Narrow Sea to Westoros (again, only in the show so far) could cover the salt aspect, or this could be covered by Slaver's Bay, or even the Battle of Mereen. An even further stretch for salt would be that it has to do with the Greyjoys (also only in the show as of yet). No matter how you slice it though, she's covered on the salt and smoke bit. ""When the red star bleeds"" is interesting for her, because some may link this to the red comet passing in the sky right before Drogo's pyre. The most important part of the prophecy as it relates to Dany however, is that Azor Ahai ""shall wake dragons out of stone."" This speaks for itself, as she turned fossilized eggs into living, breathing dragons. On top of that, she may have 3 ""Lightbringers"" in the form of her dragons. What says ""burning sword"" more than fire-breathing dragons?



This next one may be new to some people, but hear me out if it sounds strange to you: **Tyrion Lannister.**
There is a very popular theory going around, though of course not confirmed, that Tyrion is actually the bastard son of the Mad King. Apparently, Aerys II had a thing (to put it lightly) for Joanna Lannister, Tyrion's mother. In the books, Tyrion is described as having a mix of black and very light blonde hair, so light that it's almost white. He also has mismatched eyes (black and green). This, in itself, is not proof of anything, but consider this: why does Tywin hate Tyrion so much? Is it really just because he's a dwarf? Is it because his birth killed Joanna? Or is it possibly because he has the sneaking suspicion that Tyrion may not actually be his son? Tywin has no proof either. So between that, and that no matter what he's still at least part-Lannister since Joanna was no doubt his mother, Tywin won't directly kill a member of his own family. Also consider that Tyrion was very easily able to befriend Dany's dragons, at a time when even she was unable to get close to them. While dragons are smart, I don't think simply saying ""don't eat the help"" will keep them from killing you if they really want to. All of this is crucial in verifying that Tyrion is, in fact, born from Aerys II's family line, as Azor Ahai was prophesied to be. Another big factor that backs up Tyrion as Azor Ahai, is that he was metaphorically ""reborn amidst salt and smoke"" at the Battle of Blackwater. Blackwater Bay is a salt water bay, and there was plenty of smoke there when Tyrion's wildfire plan set the entire battlefield on fire. Tyrion fell in battle here, and nearly died. He later woke up and felt betrayed by his family and city, and therefore had a huge change in attitude and, to an extent, his entire personality. This could be considered a rebirth of sorts. Wildfire could also be considered his ""burning sword, Lightbringer."" 



So with all of this being said, who do I think is Azor Ahai?

All of them.

Why? Because Rhaegar and Maester Aemon both believed in one thing: ""the dragon must have three heads.""

Aemon brought to light the fact that the term used in the prophecy, the Valyrian word for ""dragon"", is gender neutral. Taking this into account means that this supposed three-headed dragon that is Azor Ahai can easily be three different people: two men, and one woman. They all come from Aery's family line (supposedly), which is very helpful but only if the theory about Tyrion is true. An important thing to note is that by themselves, none of them fit all the criteria in the prophecy to be Azor Ahai. Together, however, I think the check every box.


**TL;DR** - Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen, and Tyrion Lannister are all Azor Ahai. Alone, none of them fit the criteria, but together they do.

Part of me just also hopes this is true, so that we get to see all three of them riding Dany's three dragons to fight the White Walkers and unite the Seven Kingdoms.


So what do you guys think? Does my theory hold water? Who do you think Azor Ahai will be?

1) The meaning of the Nights King sigil:

Its a map. 

http://imgur.com/a/4ajJp

As you can see its not perfect but there are too many coincidences.

If the sigil its the symbol of the wall and other cities such as hard home, this means, night king is Brandon the builder. Why the others use a wall sigil ? because night king was the creator.He built it and now he will destroy it. The dark blue zones are the wall castles, and the cities connected to the nightwatch. The light blue areas are more difficult to fit in the map. I think there are battles and ways to be done. For example the way from fist of the first men from hard home, its the way of the others in season 6, but if this is true, i dont understand the semi circle in the gift lands area, maybe the last battle ?? I dont know. In season 7 we can predict a battle in the north of Eastwatch.

Ok, in my opinion Night king = bran the builder = bran, but, i dont know how bran ends up 13000 years in the past ... not yet. But makes a little sense, remenber brynden rios saying bran ""you are late like5000 years ?"" or saying ""you are not ready"", because the thruth is, you are the night king. Its like Hodor, you are doomed to fullfill your destiny. THe night king can enter in the cave because hes bran, and whatismore, he knows all exactly because he knows her own past. When nightkings touches bran, hes bloking her ability to see the future, especially the parts when hes converted, and night king could kill bran, but he didnt, why ? because is a perfect circle, night king let bran alive because bran is him in the future. Bran goes to the past, i dont know how ... then he became bran the builder, and finally hes converted to the night king. This is so deep, so i better write more when i get something than just speculation. The goal of three eyed raven is to convert bran in the nightking ... its weird. And the Spiral in the scrifice tree ... is the symbol of the 3 eyed raven, what a coincidence.


2)About SPIRALS:
 Its the symbol of 3 eyed raven, remenber one thousand eyes and one more ? the spirals are the 1000 eyes (every corpse or children represents an eye), the center of the spiral the one eye. Other clue, we can see the spiral always from the sky, like a raven.

http://imgur.com/a/4sRU7 Spirals in the north

http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Thousand_Eyes,_and_One


3)About the CORPSES:
Looks like a circle ( but its not, its a triangle) with a straight line crossing it, ""the wall in the middle"", its again the map of the lands of the gift, the nort of the wall and the wall. The same idea, ""i will destroy the wall"" the corpses are the symbol of the shattered wall.

The idea of the project not only remake of the official maps. Some of you could note that my map contains a lot of speculative information and even differ from the official Land of Ice and Fire, because some things have been restored by text not graphic. In addition, the map contains the following goodies:

* scaling
* filtering of the icons
* inset with maps before cataclysms
* search by name (English allowed) or owner
* animated character path (24 characters)
* political borders and battles

Alas, this is a Russian language map only. And the question is if you interest in this project to be translated to English (my poor skills in language wouldn't be a problem for this I hope).

What will happen if/when the Northerners learn about Jon's true lineage? Will they still consider him the King in the North since he still has Stark blood? Or will they denounce him since he has Targaryen blood as well?

For those who don't know, this is the episode ""The door"", I'm sure you know which one I'm talking about.

I just wanted to share what I felt while watching this episode hoping to find other people who felt like me.

I'm gonna be clear: this episode finale is the best thing I have ever watched in TV/Movies/Series/Anything. 
I've always liked shows where ""time"" was explored and the way Hodor, the only pure hearted character in the series, the only who was completely oblivious and just GOOD, died, creating a time paradox, explaining the origin of his name: it was a mix of feelings and sensations that gave me chills, made me cry, made me completely subdued. I don't think I'll ever experience something like this again. I've seen many good movies, many good series but this was completely over the chart. I'd pay good money to forget about this episode just so I could rewatch it for the first time. The whole GoT series actually. 

Damn guys, at this point I don't know if I'm overpraising this scene or if you actually feel like this, let me know.

Cheers!",5,10,False,self,,,,,

I think Aemon also knew that Lyanna gave birth and where that baby went, so when Jon showed up at Castle Black, Aemon knew who he was. Commander Mormont knew through Aemon so that's why he chose Jon to be his Steward, so he could train him to be a leader, and that's why out of all the Night Watch he gave Jon his Valariyan steel sword.

*NB: This has already been posted, but was removed due a violation of the sub's rules. In order to comply with the mods' ruling, I have removed both the title of the post that I am responding to and the username of the poster in order to conform with subreddit policy, as well as the name and link to the rebuttal by another user on the /r/asoiaf sub. The full text of both can be found in my excursus post down below.*

Five days ago a post was made on /r/asoiaf about how Robb Stark was a superior ""battle commander"" than Aegon the Conqueror. It was not well received and there were numerous rebuttals that were not addressed either in that thread or in the post subsequently made here on /r/gameofthrones. On checking both posts using the [Small SEO Tools Comparison Checker](http://smallseotools.com/comparison-search/), no differences between the earlier and later posts were found.

The intention of this essay is to systematically dismantle the concept that Aegon was a bad commander. Through selectively paraphrasing the text of A World of Ice and Fire and the main novels, the poster painted Aegon in an unfavourable light. He suggests that Aegon ""just ran into conflict because he was pissed he got refused"" and that he ""didn't treat his enemies kindly or capture them"", contrary to the advice of Sun Tzu and the practice of Robb. This, as you will see, is as far from the truth as you can get. Aegon planned his invasion very well, and he was both merciful and magnanimous to those whom he defeated in battle.

**Limitations of This Post**

It is impossible to properly judge either Aegon or Robb on their skill as a battlefield commander as we only have secondhand information about their battles: we do not witness Robb's battles in the books or the show, with the exception of a few glimpses, and only have a bare-bones, in-universe chronicle on Aegon's conquest, that summarises two years of campaigning into only a few thousand words. As such, all we can do is examine the broader strategic and high level tactical performance of the two leaders. This, fortunately, is where Sun Tzu's *The Art of War* - and, indeed, most other books on ""The Art of War"" - is most useful.

In this post, for reasons of both space and time, I won't be performing a total comparison of the two: the main goal of this post is to refute the idea that Aegon was a poor commander, not to denigrate Robb or argue which on was the better commander. The actions of Robb, where mentioned, will be drawn exclusively from the books^6 and used to refute, expand or contextualise claims made by the poster.

**On Sun Tzu**

One notable aspect of the post was an appeal to the authority of Sun Tzu: 

&gt;If you don't think Sun Tzu is trustworthy, just look the guy up, he was insanely cool.

If one looks up Sun Tzu, one finds that, far from being ""insanely cool"" and a ""super infamous battle Commander"", he possibly never existed. Wikipedia has a good [summary of the debate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Tzu#Historicity), which even a cursory search would bring up. Ralph D. Sawyer's opinion that Sun Tzu likely existed, was likely a commander of the period and wrote the core elements that form the *Art of War*, but that the present version was been refined over the years by members of his family and constantly updated in accordance with their own experiences and the changing methods of warfare over time is likely the most correct opinion^1. That the work of Sun Tzu's alleged descendant, Sun Pin, draws heavily on Sun Tzu's work and shows evidence of having been collated and modified by a group of followers or subsequent generations is perhaps evidence enough of both the historicity of Sun Tzu and provides evidence that Sun Tzu's *The Art of War* would have been modified over time by successive generations^2.

However, the fact that Sun Tzu was probably an actual historical commander and so had experience does not necessarily imply that his work has any more validity than any other. Vegetius, who had no military experience, wrote one of the most widely known and highly valued military works of the Western World, *De Re Militari*^3 , which is itself very similar to Sun Tzu's *The Art of War*^4. Whatever authority that *The Art of War* has, therefore, it derives not from the experience of those who wrote it, but the fact that the principles it contains are both universal^5 and capable of being employed over a long period of time and wide variety of areas.

##**Arguments for and Against Aegon the Conqueror**

**The Arguments for Aegon's Inferiority**

The post provides only two examples on which he rests the case of Aegon's inferiority to Robb. These are, namely, that anyone can easily conquer a South American sized continent if they had three dragons, and that Aegon constantly squandered potential manpower by annihilating his enemies. Of these, user only attempts to justify the superiority of Robb over Aegon by using Sun Tzu in the latter case:

&gt;Yet again at the Field of Fire, he just killed Lord Gardener and thousands if not tens of thousands of his soldiers, then just installed Lord Tyrell because Lord Tyrell bent the knee. I don't know about you but I'm seeing a recurring theme here, Aegon just killed anyone who didn't bend the knee, and yes while destroying your enemies is part of being a true battle Commander, Sun Tzu states,

&gt;*""Therefore in chariot fighting, when ten or more chariots have been taken, those should be rewarded who took the first. Our own flags should be substituted for those of the enemy, and the chariots mingled and used in conjunction with ours. The captured soldiers should be kindly treated and kept. This is called, using the conquered foe to augment one's own strength.""* - **The Art of War Chapter 3**

In the case of the former charge, that anyone could conquer Westeros if they had three dragons, no evidence is offered from Sun Tzu that this is the case. No argument is brought up about any supposed superiority in scouting and justified with a quotation, nor any mention made of what could be superior tactical maneuverability or of superior firepower. All that we are supplied with are assertions that conquest is easy once you have dragons.

&gt;If every person who went to war had a huge ass dragon called Balerion the Dread, and his sisters had two huge ass dragons along with yours, your Conquest would be quite easy as Aegon's was.

&gt;Now, Sun Tzu was a real life super infamous battle Commander, he didn't have any dragons and neither did Robb Stark, so you should give more credit to Robb Stark then you might already.

Finally, the poster brings up Robb's use of deception, but does not attempt to argue that Aegon did not attempt this, nor that he was worse than Robb at it. He is not, thus, suggesting that Aegon is an inferior commander in this regard, nor is he proving that Robb is the better commander: he is just making a groundless assertion, presumably designed to glorify Robb, that should have been easy for him to prove or disprove had he so desired to make the point valid.

**The Arguments for Aegon's Competence**

In defence of Aegon, another user made a number of salient points. While I intend to do my own analysis, I shall summarise their arguments below:

1) *War isn't merely a clash between armies upon a field. War is everything that makes up the situation and everything that follows after.* Dragons are like tanks or fighter jets in that, while they can take ground, they can't hold it. In order to control an area you need a way to maintain a hold over the inhabitants of the area. Ideally this would be by recruiting the local nobility to your side, because otherwise you need to supply the men yourself. They're needed to keep the population from rising up, collect taxes, uphold the law and prevent any bandits or rogue forces gaining a foothold in the area. Three thousand men is not enough to do this for even what would become the Crownlands, let alone the whole of Westeros.

2) *Aegon's war was a war of winning people and land faster than his enemies can respond.* As noted above, manpower is needed in order to maintain control. In order to do this, Aegon needed to have friends and allies in all the countries that he intended to conquer, and he did his very best to acquire these prior to his attacks. But, even after the defeat of an enemy, he would integrate them into his new kingdom in order to make use of their manpower and resources.

3) * For most of the time, his enemies didn't even know he was there until he made the first attack.* Aegon used his small army's size and speed to outmaneuver and surprise his enemies consistently and constantly. This is in and of itself a form of deception. This also allowed him to choose his own battlefields, much to his own advantage.

4) *On the other hand, Aegon the Conqueror had been preparing for his conquest for god knows how many years.* Aegon, unlike Robb, was well prepared for his invasion of the mainland of Westeros. He had scouted the area, mapped the terrain and landed in a strategic, but undefended location. Robb, however, had only a short term, limited plan, and he quickly became entangled in it.

##**Analysis of Aegon's Conquest of Westeros**

**Preparations and Landing**

&gt;After estimating the advantages in accord to what you have heard, put it into effect with strategic power [*shih*] supplemented by field tactics which respond to external factors. As for strategic power, [it is] controlling the tactical imbalance of power [*ch'uan*] in accord with the gains to be realised. - *The Art of War*, Chapter 1^7

We know comparatively little about Aegon's planning for the invasion. What we do know is that he had the Painted Table constructed ""years before"" his invasion of Westeros, and that he and his sisters had visited Oldtown and spent time with the Redwyne family^8. From the early construction of the Painted Table, we can see a clear interest in Westeros before the events involving King Argilac transpired, and the time spent with the Redwynes could potentially be seen as an attempt to gain support in the Reach. 

More concretely, we know that the Bar Emmons of Sharp Point and the Masseys of Stonedance were more closely tied to the Targaryens than to their lord, King Argilac. Exactly what these ties were are not entirely clear, but they were certainly significant enough for these two Houses to rebel against their king. Likely these were not ties put in place by Aegon himself, but by his father, grandfather or other relative in order to better control the Gullet. However, while he may not have created these ties, Aegon made full use of them when the time came.

Now we come to the event that started the war: King Argilac's offer of his daughter's hand in marriage to Aegon. Argilac intended to create a buffer between himself and Harren the Black, and did not want to cede any of his own land to Aegon in order to create it. His dowry, magnanimous as it was, was not his to give^9, and he obviously intended that Aegon should conquer and control this land for him.

Aegon could have accepted the marriage, it's true, and just waited for Argilac to die in order to inherit all of the Stormlands, but this would have required him to fight a war against the Ironborn for several years, perhaps even as long as a decade. And, as becomes quickly apparent, Aegon did not truly want to have only the Stormlands under his control, but the whole of Westeros.

So, pleading his marriage to his two sisters, Aegon declined King Argilac's offer of marriage and proposed a match of his own: Argilac's daughter his Orys Baratheon, Aegon's bastard half-brother. More than that, however, Aegon demanded additional land. This land included Massey's Hook - home to the two Stormland Houses who would rebel against Argilac to join him - and a significant amount of forest and coastal plain. While not as large the area offered to Aegon by Argilac, nor as productive as the other land of the Stormlands, it nonetheless represented a large portion of Argilac's kingdom. These were not lands to held in feif: these were lands to be held outright by Aegon.

The fact, therefore, that Aegon suggested his bastard half-brother as the groom is not the most significant factor in Argilac's rejection of the proposal, but should be considered as being equal to the land Aegon demanded. Argilac did not want to lose land and the revenue it offered in order to create a buffer. He wanted to keep his own land and gain a buffer. Aegon's demands should, as a result, be seen in the same light as Henry V's demands of the French with the regards to him marrying Charles VI's daughter. That is to say, lip service in order to show that he was willing to negotiate, while all the while preparing for war^10.

Whether or not Aegon was truly ready to begin his campaign isn't known, but we do know that he subsequently called in all the lords who supported him, including two who would be rebelling against their king, and held a council with them for seven days^11 . This is probably an artifact of the in-universe text, designed to fulfill both a religious (seven days for the Seven) and rhetorical function (seven days for seven kings), but we can still assume that the meeting went on for some time and that it wasn't a seven hour affair. Likely it went on for several days, where estimations were made, calculations performed off those estimations and then, when it was decided that now as the right time to act, plans finalised.

The council of war done, Aegon sent out messages to every lord he had a raven for, declaring himself king over all the seven kingdoms, and then set out for the Blackwater Rush. As /u/seinera has noted, Aegon landed in what was a strategically good location. It was a poorly controlled non-man's land, smack bang in the middle of the south of Westeros. It offered him good access to the Stormlands, Riverlands, Westerlands and the Reach, the most essential parts of Westeros^12, as well as a temporarily secure base from which he could gain a foothold.

Following his landing, Aegon moved quickly to secure the support of the local nobility. His sister Rhaenys secured the support of the Rosbys, while Visenya did no more than set fire to a few of the roofs in Stokeworth castle after being shot at by crossbowmen. Stokeworth subsequently surrendered and bent the knee without any casualties resulting from the incident.

Lord Darklyn of Diskendale and Lord Mooton of Maidenpool then launched a counterattack of their own, with three thousand men. Aegon sent Orys to attack the force while on the march, presumably in an ambush, while Aegon himself attacked on the Black Dread from above. I think it's important to note here that Aegon didn't take on the whole army by himself: he obviously needed the enemy force to be engaged before he attacked, quite probably because dragonfire isn't nearly as effective as is often made out (see below) and because, while the dragons might be immune to arrows and crossbow bolts, the riders are not, and the risk of being injured or killed was too high for Aegon to risk a solo attack^13 . 

Following the defeat of the two lords, Darklyn's son and Mooton's brother chose to bend the knee and surrendered their castles within the towns. Visenya who, from the text, appears to have been sent on ahead of the main force to Duskendale, prevent it from being looted, but did take control of the town coffers^14 . This simultaneously provided the Targaryens with some much needed specie, but also preserved the town's economic base, so that it could continue to be a source of revenue for the new kingdom. 

Finally, Aegon held his first coronation. He had all the lords and ladies of the castles he'd conquered attend him, and he confirmed them in their lands after they swore allegiance to him. He also had a banner made, something which was not a Valyrian tradition, but a Westerosi one. This seems to have been a factor in the support he enjoyed from the smallfolk^17. It was a simple gesture, but it was one that symbolized that he was, despite his Valyrian heritage, Westerosi.

**The Major Campaigns**

&gt;""Thus if one knows the field off battle and the day of battle, he can traverse a thousand *li*^15 and and assemble to engage in combat. If he does not know the field of battle or know the day of battle, then the left flank cannot aid the right nor the right flank the left; the front cannot aid the rear nor the rear aid the front. How much more so when the distant are some tens of *li* away and the near several *li* apart? As I analyse it, even though Yueh's army is numerous, of what great advantage is it of them for attaining victory? Thus I say that victory can be achieved. Even though the enemy is more numerous, they can be forced not to fight. - *The Art of War*, Chapter 6^16

Following his coronation, Aegon split his forces into three: The bulk of his foot soldiers, under the command of Orys and Rhaenys, headed south to face King Argilac. Aegon, with a much smaller force, headed into the Riverlands to face Harren the Black at Harrenhal. And, finally, Visenya flew with the fleet to Gulltown and the Vale.

Normally, splitting such a small force into three even smaller ones would be a bad idea. Even Sun Tzu only recommends splitting your force if you outnumber your enemy 2:1^18 . However, there are two points in Aegon's favour. First and foremost, he must have known that the Riverlords would support him. We've already seen how long Aegon had been planning his conquest of Westeros and that he was not, as has been previously asserted, a rash man. He could move decisively and he could exploit moments when luck was in his favour, but he was still cautious. The in-universe chronicle doesn't say outright that Aegon and Edmyn Tully conspired together, but they must have, given Aegon's nature.

Secondly, the naval forces weren't needed for the land campaigns. Any support from the rivers would have been provided by river barges and fishing boats, not the large war galleys in the Targaryen navy. It made sense to send them to establish a beachhead in the Vale by taking Gulltown, or else to destroy the Vale's naval assets, which might be sued to attack and harass the land already conquered by Aegon. Visenya, the more warlike and militarily astute sister, was sent with this force because the role demanded a sharper military mind and more independent skill that Rhaenys had. Though the best flyer of the three, Rhaenys was nonetheless the least interested in military affairs and so would be least useful for not only protecting the fleet but also conducting solo offensive operations against the enemy. Rhaenys, however, was well suited to be the scout for Orys, who most needed good intelligence about his enemy.

So, Aegon took a risk in splitting his forces, we can see that he did not do so hastily or for no reason other than to be clever for the sake of being clever. He was able to attack both the major land threats simultaneously, while keeping a third, potential, enemy from harassing his rear. It is possible to argue that Aegon's splitting of his force was a better military decision than Robb's decision to split his forces, which left one force dangerous weak of infantry and the other dangerously weak of cavalry, but that will be more closely examined in the excursus.

As noted above, when Aegon marched on Harren, the Riverlords rose up and joined him. They managed to bottle Harren and his sons up in Harrenhal, but not before two of Harren's sons inflicted heavy loses on Aegon's contingent through a surprise attack from across the God's Eye. Here again we see the weakness of the dragons: it was not until after Harren's sons had begun their return journey that Aegon was able to burn them. Despite having the largest and oldest of the three dragons, Aegon could not prevent his men from being surprised and, given their loses, routed by what was probably no more than two hundred men. 

Harren, besieged in his mighty castle, refused to surrender when given the choice, claiming that Stone does not burn.^19 He sent all his spearmen, archers and crossbowmen to the parapets of the castle, telling them that who ever killed the Black Dread would have their pick of the riverlords' daughters. There must have been some truth to his thought that such men could down a dragon, because Aegon didn't attack from over the walls, but flew right up as high as he could, and then plummeted down into the castle, Balerion spewing fire as he did so. Perhaps he remembered the Rhoynish archers killing two dragons and wounding a third some seven hundred years previous^20 , or perhaps he was worried about having to fly through such an arrowstorm himself. In any case, by diving down from above, Aegon avoided the worst of the arrows, and his surprise attack kept him and his dragon safe. Between the fire and the smoke, they would have been a hard target to hit properly, and the raging inferno would have terrified most of the men. Of the remainder, those too eager for glory or too disciplined to panic and run, they were likely too few and too scattered to make much of a difference.

This, in one fell swoop, ended the threat from the Riverlands and gave Aegon a buffer against the North, the Vale and the Westerlands. The Green Fork of the Trident and the Trident itself served to protect against the North and the Vale, while the Tumblestone, Red Fork and Riverrun served as bastions against the Westerlands. 

Not long after this, Orys and Rhaenys faced off against King Argilac with a very small army. Probably they had under ten thousand men, most likely five or six thousand in truth. Of these there might have been, at most, a thousand heavy cavalry. Against them stood almost all of King Argilac's bannermen. Rhaenys, acting as a scout, detected their approach and relayed their numbers and dispositions to Orys, who made the decision to stop and dig in on some hills just south of Bronzegate. He had already suffered a thousand casualties while crossing the Wendwater, and despite Rhaenys' burning of what would become known as the Kingswood and the retreat of Argilac's vanguard, they had doubtless received the worst of the encounter. Their position, however, was a strong one. In pre-modern warfare, especially in medieval warfare, it was a well acknowledged rule that whoever marched to attack the enemy, especially uphill, would lose the encounter^21 , so the disparity in numbers didn't matter quite as much as it might had they met on an open plain.

Prior to the battle it began heavily, and the rain continued throughout the battle. While the rain did make a full charge uphill against the Targaryen army impossible for the Stormland cavalry, it also grounded Rhaenys and Meraxes, obscured the advance of the Stormland infantry and prevented the Targaryen army from using bows or crossbows against their foes^22. As such, Orys was at more of a disadvantage than Argilac who, after sending their spearmen against the Targaryen lines, were finally able to break through their center. Here they met Meraxes. Though grounded due to the weather, the big dragon was able to destroy the forces who penetrated the Targaryen line, killing or unhorsing the majority of the high ranking Stormland nobility.

Advancing downhill, Orys came across King Argilac and offered him a chance to surrender. The king refused, and so Orys was forced to kill him. This resulted in the complete rout of the Stormland forces, who scattered to the four winds. Word of what had happened to Harrenhall was sufficient for the garrison of Storm's End to defy the Princess Argella, whom they delivered naked, bound and gagged to Orys. Orys treated her kindly and, although his marriage to her was doubtless not of Argella's choosing, it was a good way to add legitimacy to Orys' take over of the kingdom on behalf of Aegon. Orys even took on the Durrandon arms and words as his own, to fully integrate himself as the ruler of the Stormlands^23.

Now, however, the Reach and the Westerlands marched against Aegon. Fifty five thousand  men, including five thousand heavy cavalry, marched north by northeast towards Aegon and the Riverlands^24. It is probable that, as Aegon was the one who had declared himself king, Mern IX, King of the Reach, and Loren I, King of the Rock, saw Aegon as both the figurehead and the brains behind the invasion. They likely thought that, if they could defeat Aegon, the rest of his forces would crumble before them and they would not only have eliminated a major threat, but could also gain a good deal of land as well.

Aegon, with somewhere between ten and eleven thousand men, most of them of recent and untested loyalty, was able to move much faster than the larger army of his enemies. He quickly reached the town of Stoney Sept, where he was joined by his two sisters. He then continued south, to the plains below the Blackwater Rush, where he intended to meet his foes. A look at any map will show that there was more rugged terrain he could have aimed for, areas where he could draw up on a hill or behind a bog so that his enemies would have a hard time reaching him, and would be exhausted in doing so. But, instead, Aegon deliberately chose to draw up for battle on an open plain, where he was at a severe disadvantage.

This was not foolish courage, but cold calculation. Had Aegon withdrawn to areas where the combined forces of the Reach and Westerlands would have had difficulty reaching him, he would lose the chance to defeat them once and for all. Once they found him, the Kings could split their forces, slowly surround him and force Aegon to fight multiple battles at once. Or, worse, they might refuse to come to battle if Aegon choose too strong a defensive place. No, what Aegon needed to do was win a decisive battle, and he had to give his enemy a reason to attack with all their strength.

As Sun Tzu said: 

&gt;Thus one who excels at moving the enemy deploys in a configuration [*hsing*] to which the enemy must respond. He offers something which the enemy must seize. With profit he motivates them, with the foundation he awaits them. - *The Art of War*, Chapter 5^25

Aegon, by choosing a place where the enemy has an overwhelming advantage, caused his enemies to attack him without fully considering the battlefield. They saw a force that they probably outnumbered in cavalry alone^26, and did not note just how dry the grass and wheat was, or that it was windy^27. All they saw was firm ground that was perfect for their cavalry.

The account of the battle is a little confused. It seems that the Kings broke part of Aegon's line, or perhaps that they intended to but were prevent from doing so by the fires set by Rhaenys and Visenya. Possibly some part of their force broke through the center, while the remainder went around the flanks of the crescent Aegon had formed of his men, and that these were subsequently cut off from them by fire and had to charge back through it in order to reach their foes. However, the ""tens"" of thousands"" who suffered burns would indicate that fires were set behind the infantry as well. If this is the case, then the army of Riverlords, commanded by Jon Mooton^28, would also have been in danger from the fire.

Whatever the case, it doesn't really matter how the battle went down precisely, except to know that while Aegon directly attack his enemies on Balerian, Rhaenys and Visenya set fires that broke and routed the cavalry and, almost certainly, the infantry of the Reach and the Westerlands. Yet, despite this, only four thousand out of the fifty five thousand man army died from the fires, and only another thousand were killed by sword, spear or bow^29. Either the dragons, great as they were, were not the super weapons they're made out to be, or Aegon and his sisters weren't attempting to destroy their enemies' army completely. If the first case the thesis that anyone with dragons can win a battle is void, as the dragons were only able to kill four thousand men out of a much greater host. If the second case, then the idea that Aegon annihilated anyone who challenged him has no value.

Following this battle, King Loren was captured, and he bent his knee. Aegon not only accepted his fealty and confirmed all his lands, but also made him Warden of the West, perhaps the second most powerful position after that of the King himself^30 . Aegon also accepted the oaths of the other lords who had fought against him, as was, we have seen repeatedly, his custom.

**The Final Conquests**

Although Aegon had defeated the Reach and the Westerlands, he still had more to do. He managed to secure Highgarden, but before he could accept the surrender of Oldtown, the Arbor or attempt to invade Dorne, Torrhen Stark attacked from the North with thirty thousand men. Aegon raced ahead of his army, sending word to everyone who had sworn him fealty. Men came from all over. From the Stormlands and the Westerlands, the Reach and the the Riverlands a vast horde of men had assembled on the banks of the Trident. Marching in many separate columns, the army had reached this point and assembled quickly enough that Torrhen never had a chance of crossing unopposed against anything even approaching his own size.

Wisely, Torrhen Stark knelt.

Freed by the surrender of the North, Visenya tried again for the Vale and Rhaenys flew to Dorne. Visenya, flying over all the defenses that Sharra Arryn had manned to defend he son's right to the Vale, managed to secure the loyalty of the Vale without any overt threat of force^31 . Rhaenys was not so fortunate. Though there were spearmen in the Princes Pass, everywhere else was deserted but for women, children and old men. There was no-one to surrender and, when Rhaenys did find Princess Meria Martell, there was no question of Dorne surrendering. Though Aegon would later try and take Dorne and was crowned ""King of the Seven Kingdoms"", Dorne would not be conquered for another hundred and fifty years^32 .

Aegon, on coming to Oldtown, was welcomed by both Lord Hightower and the High Septon, who had allegedly been shown by the Crone that the city, the Hightower and the Starry Sept would all burn if they resisted Aegon^33 . It was here, for the second time, that Aegon was crowned King of Westeros for the second time. This time, rather than being witness by a few hundred minor noblemen and the ceremony performed by Visenya, the ceremony was witnessed by hundreds of powerful lords and performed by the High Septon himself.

After two years, Aegon had completed his conquest in name, if not entirely in deed.

##**Conclusion**

I believe that I have fully demonstrated that Aegon was quite an excellent general and that, contrary to the user's assertions, Aegon did not squander the men he conquered and neither did he rush headlong into things without much planning. Aegon consistently allowed men who bent the knee to him to retain the lands and, for the most part, titles, even if they had fought him. Lord Jon Mooton of Maidenpool, for instance, commander Aegon's infantry at the Field of Fire, while Loren I, once King of the Rock, was instated as the Warden of the West. Aegon did not punish those who fought against him, therefore.

Using the evidence of his prior visits to Westeros and the construction of the Painted Table, we can draw the conclusion that Aegon had been planning to invade Westeros for some time. His long planning session with those few lords who supported him prior to his declaration of war demonstrates that he analysed the situation before doing anything rash, and his campaigns show a man who knew how to use both ground forces and his dragons to best advantage, as well as use the terrain to his own advantage. Finally, Aegon's splitting of his forces indicates that he was both a confident and capable general, who knew how to keep what lands he had taken and avoid being attacked in the rear or the flank.

With all this information combined, I can only conclude that Aegon was, in fact, a very competent commander. Whether he was a better ""battle commander"" than Robb Stark is an argument that can never truly be solved, due to a paucity of direct, detailed, first hand information about the battles that either fought. I think it likely, however, that Aegon *was* the better overall commander, and that he may well have had battlefield commanders under him who were better than Robb. Jon Mooton, in particular, must have been truly skilled in order to keep his men from routing during the first charge of the two Kings or from panicking after the fields were set on fire.

The composite bows would have had fully tensioned strings, and so they would performed as his waxed example did). Most likely, it would have been the wind and the poor visibility caused by the rain, not any wet strings, that prevented Orys' archers from using their bows.

https://youtu.be/O6FOHHwpW3g?t=1m50s
This one on one with Stannis and Davos sums up their characters in one scene. We see Davos, who always counsels Stannis based on the most honorable and just decision possible. He doesn't care if that decision could negatively affect him, but he has to do what he thinks is right.
Meanwhile, we see how Stannis will do everything in his power to fulfill his duty. He will even go as far as killing his own family and using dark arts to win the crown. However, there is a small part of him that still wants to do what is right, which is why he needs Davos.
This is one of my favorite scenes in the show, and I think the actors portrayed these characters perfectly. I wish we could have gotten more of Stannis.",20,6,False,self,,,,,

Either the Maesters will cure him, or Samwell will be the only willing to cure him.  No matter which way it goes, Sir Jorah and Samwell will end up meeting.  Samwell will tell Jorah about Jon and Jorah will tell Sam about Dany.  I believe that somehow Samwell or Jorah will figure out that Jon is part Targaryen.  The two will want Dany and Jon to meet, so do we all.  Jorah and Samwell will go to Winterfell and meet Jon.  They will both insist on it, and Samwell's words will move Jon to meet Dany at King's Landing.  Meanwhile, at King's Landing, Cersei will be queen and Jamie will not be liking her ruling. When Dany's ships pull into the harbor and the dragons fly over the city, Jamie will notice Tyrion on the ship. Cersei will be prepared for this invasion with Wildfire. But, Jamie will come on at the last minute.  Cersei will say ""Burn them all,"" and then Jaime will kill Cersei and become a King and Queen Slayer.  This is my prediction for some of the major events in Season 7. Thanks for reading, and comment flaws, your own beliefs, and agreements on this theory.",43,20,False,spoiler,,,,,

Well that might be all well and good to further the battle for the dawn, except for [this scene](https://youtu.be/kRR0NlesJy8?t=2m45s) in Season 6 where Dany tells her Dothraki army that she chooses all of them to be her bloodriders.

If I'm not mistaken, it was my understanding that bloodriders were required to avenge those who kill their Khal (in this case Khaleesi), before willingly following them to the grave. This means that every Dothraki soldier would be honor bound to kill Jon should he sacrifice Daenerys. After killing him, perhaps they would also commit mass suicide after having served their purpose in life?

Alternatively, they might share Jon's bed with Dany as the bloodriders did in times of old.",22,20,False,self,,,,,

Also I am aware of some of the set photos leaks so i will combine some of my ideas with that of what i can gather by connecting the dots of some of the leaked set photos and leaked details i have seen and read. Also i have not seen every leak set photo or detail and i have NOT read the leaked plot so PLEASE do NOT spoil anything and if you are going to use spoiler tags. Now i got that out of the way let's get started:

Dany I think on her way to attack KL will not only be attack by Eurons Fleet but also it will be revealed that Daario and the second sons have disobeyed there queens orders and left Marreen. Danys fleet comes on top but Euron still stands and he has taken Yara, Missendei, Daario, The Second Sons fleet, Kinevara, Ellaria, and Tyene hostage and killed Obara Sand. Dany then decides to split up her fleet with Her main fleet and the Greyjoy fleet taking Dragonstone and The Martell and Tyrell fleet headed to The Reach. Tyrion suggest due to her fleet being weakened that they get help from the north Dany though at first refuses as she does not want help from a house that supported Robert. But Theon convinces her other wise and she decides to send a Raven to the North for support in the battle for KL. Dany then with her dragons fly to Dragonspit and take them for house Targaryen wall Tyrion takes a ship to the vale to meet with Timett and the Clansmen about helping them in the battle.
 
Meanwhile Arya finds Melisandre and kills her for taking away Gendry however in her dying breath Mel explains that Gendry is still alive and Jon Snow has retaken winterfell. After learning Arya takes Thoros and Beric off her list as forgiveness and now must decide if she will look for Gendry or head home and after some thinking she decides to head home (also she has a short and sweet reunion with Nymeria).

Jorah makes his way to Qarth where he finds Quaithe and ask her if she can cure his greyscale she stats she cannot cure it but she knows a Priest from Myr in the Riverlands that can but to find him he must get help from a Stag in a land where all storms come to an end. Jorah knows what Quaithe is talking about and heads to storms end where he meets Gendry and quickly connects the dots and finds out he is Roberts son. He ask Gendry for help in finding the red Priest to cure his greyscale he says he will do it on the condition that he helps him find his lady (Arya) and that when Dany takes over he is Legitimized and made lord of Storms end Jorah promises and they go to find Thoros. Gendry and Jorah find the BWB and Gendry leaves explaining that he can never forgive Thoros for giving him to the red woman that and he made a promise to a woman back home (the shows version of Willow Heddle (played By Emily Kinney)) that he would help a Priest (played by Mads Mikkelsen) lead a Resistance against Cersei and also if he finds Arya tell her he is sorry for not keeping to his promise and that he misses her. Gendry then leaves and afterwards Thoros cures Jorah of his Greyscale and his arm turns black, Burning, and Smoking (book readers will know why it is in detail ;)) and Jorah joins them on their travel north. On their way they meet a boy around Aryas age named Edric (if you are wondering this is a new character not Edric Dayne not Edric Storm but a completely different Edric and until I come up with a more original name that will be his name for now) who wants to join the BWB Thoros impressed by the fact he is brave enough to stand up to him and the Brotherhood and allows him to join.

Later that night Arya finds them and explains that she has learned that Gendry is still alive and that Jon has retaken winterfell and ask if this is true. Jorah says yes Gendry is still alive but he has gone to the KL to lead a Resistance and he will be fine. Thoros stats he does not know if what Mel says is true but he still trust her so he will believe his word Arya decides to willingly goes with them to Winterfell (also Edric gets a crush on Arya and tries to flirt with her but it fails).

Meanwhile Bran and Meera pass the wall and wall it does NOT destroy it immediately it does weaken it. Bran tries to convince Edd and some of the other nights watchmen to come with them but they refuse as they must stay at their post Bran and Meera decide to leave to WF. Arya and Co. end up running into Brienne and Pod and wall Brienne and The Hound have a heated Reunion the two decide to make truce as they both want to get Arya back to Winterfell safely. Bran and Meera get attack by bandits with them threatening to kill Meera and make Bran watched but Arya and Co. make it in a nick of time to save them and kill the bandits after this is done Bran and Arya have a reunion.

Meanwhile at WF Jon and Sansa get into a small conflict with each other on who should rule WF but it is quickly resolved as they must remember the true threat that is coming. Howland and the sister of smalljon umber comes to winterfell to speak with Jon. The sister Umber apologizes to Jon for her brothers involvement in Bastard bowl and that she forgives house Umber as from this day they will remain loyal to the starks. Jon accepts her apology. Howland speaks with Jon saying sorry for not adding him in bastardbowl and also to come with him to the crypts. Howland reveals to Jon that he is the son of Rhaegar and Lyanna and that he proves this by showing him a page from his Journal confirming this, Rhaegar's armor, and also Jon's real name is Jahaerys. After learning this Jon is given the Raven from Dany. He along with Davos, Howland, Ghost, Lord Manderly (yes lord Manderly), and some of the northern forces with some of Howlands bannermen leave to Dragonstone to meet with Dany with Jon leaving Sansa in charge as queen of the north. Bran, Arya, Meera, The Hound, Jorah, Brienne, Pod, and the BWB make it to Winterfell where they hear Jon has left. The Hound, Brienne, Jorah, and Pod leave to catch up to Jon (which they do by the way) and the BWB leave to the wall to help prepare for what's coming but Edric stays as he still wants Arya. Arya, Bran, Meera, and Edric make it to Winterfell and Bran and Arya have a reunion with Sansa (also there is a small conflict between Sansa, Arya, and Bran started by Littlefinger but it is also quickly resolved via Bran and the mockingbird is either poisoned by Sansa or Pushed out the moondoor by either Robin or Arya)

Meanwhile Euron makes it to KL with his hostages and Daario is revealed to be a spy for Euron and his Second Sons are also with him on it. Cersei other than Illyn Payne, Qyburn, The Mountain, Euron, and Daario is being hated by the citizens of KL after what happened to the Sept. The citizens are rioting, a Resistance has started led by Gendry and a Priest (played by Mads Mikkelsen) and even Jaime is regretting his incestuous relationship with Cersei and even starts a small Romance with Missendei. Randall also comes in and bends the knee to Euron NOT Cersei and brings fourth Sam, Gilly, and Marwyn as his hostages (the reason little Sam is not there is because Dickon stabbed his father in the back by making sure the child is safe in the hands of Surella Sand).
Jon, Howland, Davos, Ghost, Lord Manderly, Jorah, The Hound, Brienne, Pod, and the Northern Soldiers make it to Dragonstone where Tyrion has returned in time for a reunion with Jon. Jon also has a heated reunion with Theon. Jon meets with Dany and explains that he is the son of Rhaegar and Lyanna, The White Walker, and the Real war that is coming. Jon also stats he will help her take KL on the condition that she helps him with the war of the dawn and they atleast negotiate peace beforehand (also Dany explain the North will be made independent when she takes the Iron throne with the vale, The Neck, and the riverlands being included in the independent north and he will need to marry a stark to keep his hold on winterfell (yes i support JONSA don't judge me) Also Davos knows a boy named Gendry who can help and him and Tyrion get him and bring him to Dragonstone).
Anyways Lord Manderly is send with his forces to Harrenhal where he takes Harrenhal and frees the prisoners. Meanwhile Arya now that she has spent time with her family again decides to leave back to KL to resume her list. But before she leaves Edric and Lyanna Mormont confront her but understand why she must do this and they help her get to a boat that will take her to KL. Edric, Arya, and Lyanna all talk and Edric and Arya bound over the stuff they were forced to go through in their lives. Edric also reveals that her father Ned saved him from some bullies and promised him that would be promised to one of his daughters when he comes of age. Also that Edric too lost his father and after he dead was found by some bandits and taken as a captive to The reach but was saved by some Tyrell soldiers and became a Squire to Mace Tyrell until he came of age and became a guard of highgarden until he heard about what happened to the Tyrells and left to the north for help from Jon. Arya tells him she does not love him but she will always see him as a friend when they get to the docks Arya hugs Lyanna goodbye and kisses Edric on the cheek and then gets on the boat headed to KL. (also she leaves a note for Bran and Sansa informing them she has left)

Meanwhile Jon, Dany, Davos, Brienne, Pod, Jorah, Varys, Tyrion, Theon, The Hound, and Grey Worm all meet Cersei, Jaime, Bronn, Euron, the Mountain, and Qyburn at the dragonspit bringing Missendei, Marwyn, and Yara with them. Jon offers one last chance to surrender trying to explain to them what is coming (the reason Gendry, Olenna, Lord Manderly, and Nymeria Sand are not there because they are back at Dragonstone waiting to see if it whined down well) Cersei does not buy it and tricks Dany into letting Viserion out and kills the dragon with Wildfire. Also Dragonstone is destroyed by Wildfire with Olenna, Lord Manderly, and Nymeria still in there (Gendry, Timett, and the Dothraki commander make it out a okay though), Euron kills Missendei right in front of Grey Worm, Cleganebowl happens with The Hound winning but dies not long after to blood lose, Grey Worm gets wounded, Qyburn is burned alive by another one of Dany's dragons, and everyone else who survived escapes and they get Marwyn and Yara as well. Gendry gets back to KL where he reunites with Arya and the two get to the Resistance HQ to prepare for the battle.

Dany prepares to lead her fleet to the Eastern Gates with Some Martell and Tyrell ships and The Greyjoy fleet with some Martell and Tyrell ships as well get ready to fight Euron's fleet and the Second Sons fleet with Some Lannister and Tarly ships, Jon's forces, Howland's forces, and Some Dothraki land in the storm lands to attack from the main gates, Timett and his clansmen attack sneak in with Tyrion and Jorah through the sewers, and The Resistance is getting ready for a huge riot in the center of the city. Bronn and Jaime change sides and let Dany's forces in and Arya gets to the front gates and let's his forces in. The battle is brutal Theon kills Daario, Euron kills Theon, Yara kills Euron, Davos and Brienne are killed in the battle, Illyn Payne is killed by Arya, Randall is killed in a fight with Jaime, Bronn is taken down by a storm of arrows, Timett kills Tyene and Ellaria under orders from Tyrion for the death of Myrcella, grey Worm is either wounded or killed by one of the Queensguard, and Arya sneaks into the Red Keep only to be confronted by Jaqen who has come as she was given a name by Dany that name being Cersei. But he is then killed by Euron's shadow demon he had with Kinevara and the shadow takes the form of Arya herself. Real Arya comes on top and with help from Kinevara kills the demon but Arya is wounded.

She then makes her way to the red keep but before she can kill her she chooses family over vengeance and allows Jaime to have the kill. After this Jaime rushes Arya to the healing room where Kinevara tends to the wounded. Meanwhile Jaime returns to tell Tyrion of the wildfire so him, Jon, Tyrion, and Timett go to find the barrels of wildfire and destroy them (which they do). Jon also finds Arya in a bed of blood and one of two things happen A. Arya makes Jon promise to never tell Sansa or Bran of the things she has done and not to be angry at Jaime as he was the one who got her to the healing room. He promises and she dies in Jon's arms or B. She is stitched back up and recovers and has a reunion with Jon with Jon relieved that his little sister is not hurt.
Dany is crowned queen and makes divides the kingdoms into four independent kingdoms The Northern Kingdom, The Kingdom of the Iron Islands, The Dornish Kingdom, and The Four Kingdoms (The Reach, Westerlands, Storm lands, and Crownlands), Varys resumes his role as Master of Whisperers, Illyrio and Surella get Ravens with Surella being legitimized and made queen of Dorne and Illyrio being named Master of Coin, Yara is Mistress of ships and Queen of Iron Islands, Tyrion is offered the Westerlands but declines it and remains hand, Jaime is banished to the wall, Jorah is made Head of Queensguard, and if Grey Worm lives he is commander of the city watch but if he dies the Dothraki Commander is made Commander of the city Watch, Dickon is spared and made lord of Highgarden and promises to Sam his baby will be returned to him safely, And Gendry is legitimized and made lord of storms end (and if Arya lives Gendry gets betrothed to Arya).
Jon however leaves as not only did he see her dragons burn innocent people during the battle but also that he blames her for Arya's death (but if Arya lives it will just be the burning innocent people thing) and Jon with Howland, Pod, Ghost, and there remaining forces leave with Arya's body to take to the crypts (but if Arya lives she will want to stay with Gendry. Jon allows her to with Tyrion promising he will make sure she is safe. Both cases would be sad because if Arya dies it would be everyone's favorite character being axed not to mention it would just be sad for Jon to experience. But if she leaves and stays with Gendry it will still be sad because wall he will atleast know she is growing up and she is safe he will still be sad over possibly never seeing her again)
The season ends with the wall coming down and Thoros and Jaime making it out to tell Jon and Jon sends a Raven to Dany for her help. and Dany and her armies march North with Her riding Drogon and Tyrion riding Rhaegal.",14,4,False,self,,,,,

The weapon he's carrying is  inspired by an Indian weapon, called the [bhuj.](http://www.simonray.com/catalogue.php?id=96) Intrigued, i did a bit of research on the character and found out he belonged to House Martell.

This can be relevant to both the show and the books, but I'm mainly focusing on the books, as they have the deepest lore. My question mainly stems from this quote from Roose to Theon: 

&gt;	Lady Walda is a Frey, and she has a fertile feel to her. I have become oddly fond of my fat little wife. The two before her never made a sound in bed, but this one squeals and shudders. I find that quite endearing. If she pops out sons the way she pops in tarts, the Dreadfort will soon be overrun with Boltons. Ramsay will kill them all, of course. That's for the best. I will not live long enough to see new sons to manhood, and boy lords are the bane of any House. Walda will grieve to see them die, though.

This sounds like a pretty terrible idea in order to keep a house from going extinct. And Roose admits a sort of admiration towards his wife, which isn't necessarily paramount in political marriages. And he knows that Ramsay killed Roose's first true-born son, Domeric, with this quote, also to Theon:

&gt;Ramsay killed him. A sickness of the bowels, Maester Uthor says, but I say poison. In the Vale, Domeric had enjoyed the company of Redforts sons. He wanted a brother by his side, so he rode up the Weeping Water to seek my bastard out. I forbade it, but Domeric was a man grown and thought that he knew better than his father. Now his bones lie beneath the Dreadfort with the bones of his brothers, who died still in the cradle, and I am left with Ramsay. Tell me, my lord  if the kinslayer is accursed, what is a father to do when one son slays another?

Roose is even annoyed at Ramsay's ""games"" with Reek and other things Ramsay does when uncontrolled. Why seem so accepting of this fate of ""my bastard is just going to kill my sons and rob me of my heir, eh"". And not even attempt at having, if not a less batshit crazy, more stable family, at least a better chance at not going extinct.",13,12,False,self,,,,,

The fact that they were filming in Winter killed me because I knew it'd take longer. Then I luckily had a full rewatch of the series with a friend of mine who was new to it, so getting to indulge in her questions was just a wonderful way to keep the world fresh for me. 

Then I dropped all thoughts of it. I always try, to make sure it's not a long year. I don't come to this sub too often, but when it comes to a conversation about it, I can't pass it up.

Anyway, it's around that time of year when we get a trailer. We won't be getting one any time soon I'd imagine, but nonetheless, the feeling of awe is encroaching on my life now. I just watched a clip or two from season 1 and I had that ""And this is why I love GoT"" moment. It wasn't anything wonderful, but just the simple Ned-Rob conversation on the way to King's Landing. I had forgotten how much time I've given to the show, the books, the mods, the games, the talks.. How emotionally wrecked I was watching the Jon reveal, seeing Dany's ships actually going to Westeros. Of course it was a bit of a joke, ""she's finally coming, hurdur"".. But it's true. Dany will actually land in Westeros within the next 6-7 months of our lives, and I can't hold back how I feel about it.

Think a Total War OR Civilization style game, either way works TBH.

So, my problem is that, in this game, the dragons are the Targaryen's greatest strength as Uber Units, but they get to be OP. While the Targaryens have a much worse start than everyone else (Stannis starts with his brother's ""inherited"" soldiers, Rob starts with lots of cities, the Lannisters start with extra gold, etc, while the Targaryens start with nothing, across the ocean, surrounded by enemies, etc), and the Dragon's take special quests to unlock, you can only get one at a time, and hopefully the last one is late in the game... there stands the extremely powerful strategy for the Targaryens to rush all, or even the first two, of the dragons, cross the narrow sea, and then gank the rest of the factions with them.

So... there has to be some sort of strategy to counter the dragons to cut down on the strength of that strategy. Some units that would excel at dragon hunting, or something... anyone have any ideas?",25,3,False,self,,,,,

Because she is such an awesome wife she recommended the UK because I have always wanted to visit and she knew for a fact that a lot of Game of Thrones is filmed in Ireland.

Coming from Australia it's a very very long flight but it will be totally worth it!

I will also be hitting up castle ward as it is not included in our original tour.",7,3,False,self,,,,,
