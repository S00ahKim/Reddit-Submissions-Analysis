Would it be too much of a stretch to postulate that they may show other characters who leave us for a short while, like Rickon? After all, even those who've read the books have no idea where the little guy has been or what he and Osha have been doing. Showing Rickon's whereabouts after he separates from Bran would throw a massive curveball and keep even us book readers on the edge of our seats waiting to see what happens next.

Obviously she is a dragon, she is the mother of Dragons, Daenerys Stormborn, The Unburnt her importance cannot be understated, a dragon has three heads and like Aegon The Conqueror needed his sisters to 1st capture Westeros I assume that a similar pattern will be implemented before the end of this epic series.. 


2. TRUST NONE OF THEM- how is she supposed to not trust herself? You ask. AHHHH here comes the famed deception of prophecies into play, as I am not GRRM, I do not know the exact meaning of this quote but I take this line to mean one of two things: not to trust Viserys assumed reign as the Beggar King and Illyrios fake recognition of Viserys kingship(more on this way later) or for Dani not to trust or believe herself in her belief that she is the rightful Queen of Westeros 


3. REMEMBER THE HOUSE OF THE UNDYING- here is where it all comes together, in the house of the undying Rhaegar says there there must be three heads which would be seen as a reminder to Dani that Aegon cannot do it alone and despite not being the rightful queen she must remember that the dragon has 3 heads one of which must be her, obviously Aegon another and if R+L=J (which lets face it, were all pretty darn sure that it does) Jon Snow the 3rd head to Dani &amp; The rightful Heir and King of Westeros Aegon Targaryen VI


4. This is longwinded and if youre crazy enough to still be reading at this point I will solidify my hypothesis for you NOW! THE THREE HEADS OF THE DRAGON: Daenerys Stormborn Targaryen The Mother of Dragons, Aegon Targaryen VI The Prince That Was Promised Rightful heir to the Iron Throne of Westeros, and Jon ""SNOW"" Targaryen--&gt; a son of Old Valyria and the First Men, the true born son of Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen a man who will be reborn amongst Salt and Smoke :Azor Ahai. These three peoples are the 3 heads of the dragon the chosen ones to fight against the great evil and prevent the failure of the world. I'm taking a lot of leaps here understandably but it is as possible as any other scenario that the Prince That Was Promised and Azor Ahai are not the same person and that they need each other as well as the mother of dragons to save the world. 


5. There is and always will be 3 heads to the dragon Aegon, Visenya, and Rhaenys   Daenerys, Aegon VI, and Jon. Under the scenarios that Aegon was truly switched out and saved by Varys and Illyrio who play up the mummer's dragon farce with Viserys to be able to report on ""the last of the targaryen's"" to keep faith in the court at King's Landing and simultaneously keep Aegon safe ( Varys saves Aegon, advises The Mad King not to open the gates to Tywin, could he be telling the truth in that he is truly serving the realm?). Also if Jon was saved by his Uncle Eddard Stark who took him on as a bastard to protect him from the wrath of Robert Baratheon and the Lannisters who would have undoubtedly killed him as they did the Pisswater Prince believed to be Aegon and Rhaenys (""promise me Ned"") then this scenario is not only possible but in my opinion highly likely. Only time will tell, I doubt anyone has gotten to this point but if you did remember I'm not saying with complete certainty Im right just a fan using my imagination to dive into a potential future in The World of ICE &amp; FIRE. MUCH LOVE to GRRM for creating my favorite fantasy universe ever.",10,0,False,self,,,,,

Since a quite a bit has gone on, those images need to updated for Season 3 (or Season 4, since everything is likely done by now) Here is what I would suggest:

* Band 1: Stag approaching direwolf (Robert asking Ned to be Hand)

What do you guys think of him really?

I don't see him as that bad a guy, just he feels a bit miffed that people ridicule him for killing the king he was supposed to protect, when said king was making his people suffer. 

I think because of this he doesn't care what people think of him as he's already disliked by most, which leads him to act like a bit of a prat.

I posted a few months ago with my first beer, an Irish Red ale called Lannister Crimson Ale. I've since brewed an oatmeal stout called Winter is Coming, an amber ale called The Imp, an IPA called Slaver's Bay IPA, and an apfelwein called Arbor Gold.  I have recently brewed a hefeweizen (Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier clone).  My GF bought me all of the ingredients for my birthday and helped me brew it, so I wanted to name it and label it after us in a way related to game of thrones.  I was originally thinking something along the lines of ""The Bear and the Maiden Fair"" but it's kind of a long name for a beer, and creating a label would be a little difficult.  Anyone have any ideas how I can name and label a hefeweizen, tying in both game of thrones and my gf and I?  

Here are a few pics of my labels (haven't finished the Arbor Gold label).  Please note that none of the art used is mine and I use it only for personal use, I found it on google images for the most part.  I only added the writing, did the sizing, added small things etc.  

* Slaver's Bay IPA - http://imgur.com/JBBgPe1
* The Imp (Amber Ale) - http://imgur.com/4fvfjDQ
* Winter is Coming (Oatmeal Stout) - http://imgur.com/ceTxqwq
* Lannister Crimson Ale (Irish Red) - http://imgur.com/1MXxDF6

I'd also totally be willing to hear your ideas for future brews!  Some of mine include The Red Viper for a pepper beer, a porter with a Greyjoy theme, and sometime down the road a wild ale called Dothraki Blood.  Thanks!  Also, let it be known that I started this endeavor before Ommegang....hahaha.

For the past week or so spoiler tags have not been working for me using this app, I can see everything that is meant to be hidden behind a spoiler tag plain as day when I open a thread.

This is not problem for me as I've read through the series, but I know there are many here who haven't, and with season 3 upon us spoilers for the book are numerous, and while most are properly hidden behind spoiler tags, that function seems to not be working so those who have not read the books might be exposed to spoilers using this app.  I do not know if this problem extends to other subreddits, I know that r/asoiaf uses a similar spoiler tagging ststem if spoilers extend beyond the scope of the thread, but I'm not sure if the method extends to all of reddit, so I'd be cautious using this app elsewhere as well.  I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, but the problem persists, so I don't think it's ""just me""...

A Dream of Spring

Chapter 47

5 years after the Fall of the Wall.

It was a clear and starry night. The gigantic doors of the seven-tipped sept opened, the bells tolled and a mighty roar rose from the thousands of throats assembled in the square cheering for their new King and Queens, the passing of Winter, and the changes it brought with it, burying the old, celebrating the new, while the proud, peace invoking, seven-ringed banner of Westeros blew in the sweet smelling winds of the warm spring evening.

Tyrion stepped out of the gate, smiling. For once, he wasn't looked down upon. He gazed over the assembled masses, and lifted his right hand in cheers. The roar grew even louder. 

He was still aware of the crowns weight, but noticed it less and less. That bothered him a bit, but for today he decided to ignore it. He looked up at his left, then at his right, both times bathing in the eyes of his two beautiful wives, both having placed one hand each on his shoulders. For the first time in his life he felt content. In their eyes he saw both the love he lost and the beginnings of a love he had never dreamed living. ""Where do whores go?"", he asked himself and found that he didn't much care. He just knew his future was filled with love and passion and more than that, this marriage would bind the houses Lannister, Greyjoy and Targaryen together, they themselves intwined with the others. Tyrion Lannister, Seven-crowned King of the Realm, First of his Name, was at peace.

Daenerys and Asha shared a knowing look. The reasons that had drawn them into the hands of Tyrion were different, but each of them had also found more than they had bargained for. A love for each other. Tyrion Lannister was a brillant leader, holding the earth, Daenerys Stormborn held the air while Asha Greyjoy held the sea. Their love for each other as well as their abilities, would ensure peace for all their people.

Behind them Brienne stepped out into the night, her arm entwined with Jamies. She, too, was content. Her Kingsguard armor sparkled in the light of the torches, the new responsibilities leading them were forgotten for the moment. She was close to the man that would father her children. Smiling she lay a hand on the plate armor covering her stomach. It was a tight fit already. What more could she wish for? She leaned her head on Jaimes shoulder.

Jaime, touched the symbol of his office, made according to his wishes, attached to his stump of an arm. ""I may have lost my swordhand, but I gained one made of gold."", he thought musingly. He softly kissed Briennes forehead. ""You look stunning. More so every day my beloved."", he whispered. The mockeries of the past were just that, of the past. He meant every word. He loved her with everything that he was.

Sansa and Arya, maids of honor stepped lightly in front. Sansa holding the hand of the Hound, Arya holding Syrios. Sansa, her hair done up in elaborate braids, wearing a white satin dress, richly emboidered with gold, depicting the spring flowers of the North, passed a quick, disapproving look over Arya for the hundredth time that day. She was not yet ready to approve of her sisters short cropped hair, dark mens clothing and, least of all, Needle at her belt.

Arya giddily thought of the next evening, again a night of festivities, but this time in her and Sansas honor. Their respective marriages to the men walking beside them. Out of the corner of her eye she caught her sisters glance and held her eyes trained on hers till she got her attention.

""Tommorow night..."", Arya whispered, so only Sansa might hear, ""Do you think they'll stick us with their pointy ends?""

Sansa stared at her sister, all the while blushing furiously. Then they both broke down in uncontrollable giggles.

The Hound watched them wearily. He had heard everything of course, his undamaged ear had to do the work of two after all, but was confused by the meaning for a moment. Then he barked a hearty laugh and slapped Syrios shoulder. ""What a glorious time it is to be alive!""

Syrio leaned over. ""What do we say to them?""

The Hound looked at him questioningly.

""Not today.""

The Hound looked confused.

""But tomorrow is another day after all.""

The Hound stared at him for a moment. When realization came, both men roared with laughter and now both sisters turned a pretty shade of red.

Catelyn looked at them from a distance and wondered if she had ever seen the Hound laughing before, or her daughters giggling together. She gave each of her newborn twins, Ned and Robb, a kiss, and held them close, while Littlefinger caressed the scar on her neck. Father of her youngest children, love of her life. She looked to Jon and gave him a small, but heartfelt smile.

Jon shook his head in wonder and tentatively smiled back. Today, it seemed, everyone was happy. He bowed at Tyrions passing, his job as first man behind him, and thought back to their first real talk on the top of the now torn down Wall. He had known nothing back then.

He turned around and took Renlys hand, smiling at him. He had found a loophole after all. He was glad to be here, but would also be glad to be back on his throne in Winterfell. The adopted bastards of Robert filled the place with laughter and gave Nan a new purpose in live. It was a happy place, the once desolate halls full of life again, and the newly crowned King in the North missed it already. He gave Theon a last clap on the shoulder, embraced him as a brother and pulled Renly with him.

Theon returned the embrace and watched Jon strolling towards the direwolves. ""Live well, my brother. I don't deserve you."" There were more things he didn't deserve, he thought. ""Consul of the Iron Isles."" True, with his brothers, but who could have seen that coming? Asha marrying the King, forcing the three brothers to work together, even finding common ground. The truth of it was, to his surprise most of all, he liked his brothers, and they were good together. He was good at politics, Victarion at war and Euron... Well, Euron was Euron.

The other thing he most definitely didn't deserve he felt the whole time prickling in his back. He turned around, saw the sand-sisters smiling at him coyly and turned back quickly before he could blush. He didn't know why they wanted him, but they did. The things they had said to him almost made him trip in anticipation of tonight. He remembered last night, as he had drunkenly stumbled to their table, slumped down and uttered the first thing that came to mind. ""I don't like sand. It's coarse and irritating and it gets everywhere. Everything here is soft and smooth."" To his own surprise they had taken him with them to their quarters. To his further surprise they didn't pull a Bolton on him, but rather... He blushed even thinking about it. ""Reek rhymes with sore for a week."", he thought.

He tried to distract himself by staring at the other side of the crowd, only to have his eye caught by the woman in Red. He quickly looked away. Better not to get her attention.

Stannis stood still. He would not let that woman dominate every one of his thoughts or actions. She leaned close to his ear and whispered of fiery swords igniting fiery sheaths. As erect as he could manage, Stannis stood still. 

Varys had an inward chuckle at the stoic but profusely sweating Baratheon lord. In this new era of peace, it seemed he would need to look for a new business. An orphanage sounded tempting, filled with thieving little birds. With a last glance at the King he vanished in the crowd, dozens of little street urchins trailing behind him unnoticed.

Lastly, at the end of the procession walked Bran, shyly holding hands with Myrcella, and Rickon, riding Shaggydog as usual, looking about in child-like wonder, mouth agape and slightly drooling.

Bran saw the future. It was brighter than he ever could have imagined. Like the ending of a fairy tale, jumped out of one of Nans stories. He looked over to Rikkon, only to find him missing. ""Why does he keep disappearing all the time? It took us months to find him the last time!"" He sighed. ""Poor Rickon.""

Nymeria and her siblings walked at the back of the procession, heads held high, watching for potential threats. Ghost saw Jon in the passing crowd and trotted over to lick his hand once, saying goodbye, then trotted back to Nymeria and the pups, remembering his newfound duties.

Rikkon climbed off Shaggydog in one of the back streets, discarding his fancy clothes, revealing torn ones. He started to walk hunched over, head held low, limping slightly, crossing a few streets, turning a few corners and, as if by accident, stumbled into a fat, bald man.

The mans eyes rose in surprise, feeling the cold, numbing steel in his crotch. He never thought he would feel too much in that region again. The coldness now entered his stomach, twisting, slashing. ""This will not be a good death."", Varys thought, even as the blade slowly went higher, guts spilling to the dirty cobblestones, finally reaching under his ribs and finding his heart. 

""You taught me well."", Rikkon said, kicking and leaving him lying in the street, slaughtered like a pig.

""Come out!"", cried Rikkon, then whistled for his direwolf. They came. Climbing down from windows, turning corners. About fifty of them, one more dirty than the next. He climbed Shaggydog and let him feast on the corpse. ""The offer stands. I sail tonight, passage for everyone that comes, no questions asked, no answers given. You know where to find me."" Without another word he started Shaggydog down the streets of King's Landing, keeping to the back alleys. Glad to be finally free of his families troublesome business. Glad to be free of the Eunuch. They thought him touched in the head, just as he wanted them to. He had tried to keep out of it for years, but they always managed to find him again. More trouble than they were worth, the lot of them. Varys death ensured his freedom. ""Ride! To the sea Shaggydog. To Bravoos! To the Dothraki Sea!"" The wolf snarled. From the dreams he knew of the large hunting ground. Warriors. He would feast on Warriors.

Tyrion looked around one more time before entering the carriage, looking at his people. ""I think I did well."", he thought, nodding to himself. ""I think I'll do well.""

As the king entered the carriage Hodor strained with all his might. Slowly but surely the carriage began to move through the streets of King's Landing, while overhead the three dragons illumined the night sky with their fiery breaths and their roars reverberated of every wall of the city, echoing in a new age of peace and prosperity for Westeros and the lands across the Narrow Sea.

""Hodor."", said Hodor. This time he really meant it.

Epilogue

Joffrey watched from a darkened balcony as the procession passed him by. He smiled the most honest smile he ever had in his life. It had worked! All his work had come to fruition, all his scheming, all his wishes, all his acting had paid off. Everything had fallen into place exactly as he had planned. The world was at peace, without even knowing who they had to thank for and that was exactly how he liked it.

He turned around and tenderly placed one hand on Cerseis cheek. She shuddered under his touch in excited anticipation. His gaze thirstily drank in the nakedness of her body, feasted on the willingness in her eyes and the trembles of her pale flesh.

Finally, when he couldn't hold back his loins any longer, he tightly embraced her in his claws and kissed her as fiercely as a roaring lion.

Forgive any factual errors.

Not sure if this has been brought up a lot here but I find it interesting that no Kings have been given POV chapters. Queens have, however. It's a pretty long list of people who are kings, or even close to being kings, and none of them have POV (Robb, Robert, Stannis, Renly, Mance, Balon, Joffrey, Tommen, Young Griff/Aegon has a good claim. You could even throw Euron in there for winning Kingsmoot.) Instead we always see what they are doing through their subordinates. We do, however, see Queens (Dany, Cersei, you could say Catelyn was Queen in the North too)

So this leads me to speculate 2 things. [speculation](#g ""Asha will win the iron islands as GRRM seems to like his female POV characters in power, and if you believe in R+L=J, then Jon will not ever be a king, as no POV man can be king"")

So, I get home, open the box, put the first DVD in my computer- and the only thing the DVDs have are the episodes. Not extra features, no commentary. Not good. My next thought was to try the digital downloads. I set my computer up to download the season to iTunes last night, checked them this afternoon, and there doesn't seem to be a way to access the audio commentary on these either.

Also, I was never really all that invested in Robb as a character (lack of screen time and POV, I suppose) or overly fond of Cat. 

Now, the structure of the television show will certainly mitigate some of that (especially with the all the extra Robb stuff in S2 - he's a much fleshier character in the show), but I also think that the television show has built up the threat more explicitly as well (Cat's admonishing of Robb, but also the bridge convo between Robb and Talisa which was about as subtle as a brick to the dome). Further, this show has a very well developed reputation at this point for killing off characters left, right and center.

At the beginning of this month, I was thinking about how awesome it'd be if we got the chance to field some questions to actors, crew, or even the man himself - GRRM - right before kicking off season 3. I've talked to a couple other subs, and they have expressed interest in making this kickass idea work. The problem is, we can't do it ourselves. I need to ask 3 things from you guys.

1. Ask if you know cast+crew+GRRM directly to come on here, and take some questions, or if you know a guy who knows a guy.

2. Think about, if you had to choose 1 person to focus on, you would love to see an AMA from, and has a high possibility of answering.

3.  **VERY POLITELY AND RESPECTFULLY** ask some people you would want to see to do an AMA here. If they notice their fans are getting hopped up for this, they may just do it. Being a dick and spamming their twitter ruins it for everyone and there is no way they'd feel compelled to do so. Don't ask on a post labeled ""My Grandma just died today :(."" The last thing we need for them is to think this is a community full of rude people, but a place with dedicated fans they can talk to. 

So lords and ladies, if you can do any of those things above, we may have a chance to get some pretty cool AMA's before season 3 starts.

Don't know if this has been posted before but I just thought about it and wondered what others thought.

So I know we're still waiting on season three but I was thinking about how AFFC and ADWD basically run parallel to each other since they were split up by character.  Now realistically for TV purposes I really don't see them keeping out three of the most liked characters (Jon, Arya, and Tyrion) from the fifth season of the show.  I figure they will combine the stories from the two books and split the seasons somewhere in the middle, but what in your opinions would be a good choice for the split for each character?  

Such as: 

[AFFC](#b Ceresies' story ends when she talks to Kettleback about framing Margery.  That leaves plenty of room for season 5 to continue her story)

[ADWD](#b Tyrions season 4 ends when he is captured by Jorah Mormont in the brothel)

Things like that.  So what do you guys think they'll do or would you like to see?

They have a nearly perfect squad (in the main house) for control.

* Lord Tywin: Able to bring back a laughing stock of the realm, extremely intelligent and feared by nearly all, but also able to bring people to his side easily

* Tyrion: Extremely intelligent as well, one of the best players in ""the game""

* Cersei: Very beautiful and able to sway men to her side (supposedly)

* Jamie: Very skilled knight


I think if Cersei didn't have the mental problems she obviously has, and if Tyrion hadn't been quite so disfigured they would easily have control of the entire realm at this point. Like Lady Genna said to Jamie, Tyrion was the true heir to Tywins legacy. That, coupled with Jamie and Cersei would have been unstoppable. Too bad they couldn't work together.

Which is great  dont get me wrong. We can attribute this to the talent of the showrunners, D. Benioff and DB Weiss, and their immense respect for the source material from George R.R. Martin. And not just respect but also open collaboration; so much so Martin even wrote Blackwater (E09), arguably the best episode of last season. 

Therein, I was thinking, since the collaboration is so closewouldnt it be great if for an episode or two (which Martin could write) the narrative could feature one, or two, or three plot twists from the novels? Again: as if the books and the show were two parallel universes, very similar to one another, except for those rare moments of variation between them. Martin could give us a glimpse into how Westeros and Essos might be ever so different if someone had just done or said something different. Not wildly, perhaps, since Martin wouldnt re-write the whole thing. But enoughto glue fans of the novels to the show. And send fans of the show running to read the novels to find out what was so different in the book universe. A glimpse of someone surviving an assassination. Of someone apologizing. Of the person next to them dying. 

Id think itd be pretty neat. Especially as season 3 is starting and there so, so many threads where these sorts of twists and turns might play off nicely, and still allow the basic narrative arch to move forward intact from the books to the screen. 

What do people think? Ive never seen this done before with page-to-screen adaptations; but, then again, theres never been an adaptation like ASOIAF and GoT.   ",0,1,False,default,,,,,

I've watched the series multiple times and I'm at the beginning of re-reading the series so I decided I'd do a program at the library I work at to give some more depth for the show viewers discussing things from the first two seasons/books.

I'm going to do one program where I'll talk about characters/families and locations.  I'll talk about the Targaryens, Starks, Baratheons, Lannisters, Arryns, Tullys, Greyjoys, Tyrells, and probably some less prominent houses such as the Cleganes, Umbers, etc.  I will talk about most of the main locations that are visited and show their relation to eachother, also including a map showing the size of Westeros compared to North America.

The second program will be History and Lore of Westeros.  I'm going to cover the Andal invasion, Aegon's conquest of Westeros, the history of the Wall, Robert's Rebellion, the Greyjoy rebellion, Doom of Valyeria, etc.  I'll probably also mention and discuss the Old Gods, the New, and the Red God.  And possibly some history of Essos cities like Braavos.

Does anyone have anything else that could be important that I don't want to forget or any input as to presenting the information in a fun way?

I'm thinking I may get a lot of people who think Daenerys's name is Khaleesi so I'm thinking this information will give them a greater appreciation for the series.  I will also be bringing my 4' miniature of Westeros and probably cooking a couple of things from the ""A Feast of Ice and Fire"" cook book (all while having season 1 and 2 soundtrack playing in the background).

At the end of the first program I may show the trailer for season 3 and give them a basic breakdown of it without sharing any spoilers.  Any input to make this presentation as awesome as possible would be useful.  Thanks!

TLDR;  I'm putting on a 2 part presentation on characters/locations/history/lore. What should I be sure not to forget?

Why? The concept appeals to me on a personal level. I don't believe in an afterlife. I think the time we have is the time we got and the time that matters. (every man must die)
I also believe in doing the good thing, protecting our beliefs and what we value (every man must serve).

There are other reasons and I can develop on it if someone requires.
I was thinking about having one part in one forearm and one in the other. Thing is, I can't quite decide how to visually represent each part. I've thought about a dagger, skulls, flowers, a hidden (hooded) face, many things! And I like a lot of them!

I am really indicisive on what to get and since you guys are an awesome community and the topic is of your interest, how about you give me your opinions and ideas? Would hate to get something only to think of a better idea after I get it.

In the books, she *never* really seemed like she *actually* cared about Tyrion. Perhaps a little bit, but you could still plainly expect that she was just using him. In the show, the conversations are different, Tyrion's commitment is different, and Shae seems to be genuinely in love (or just really in LIKE) with him.

So, what do you all think will happen with her in the show? Are they going to turn her character around and steer clear of making her in to that treacherous bitch from the books?

So, my roommate and I are pumped. Season 3 starts soon. 

""Hey man, do you want to watch through all of the GOT's so that way our brains are super funky fresh on all that content and stuff?""

""Yeah man.""

Now, his girlfriend lives with us. She is not the nerdy type. Enjoys sports and all that jazz (not saying you can't even if you are a nerd). But your somewhat typical, well adjusted party girl. 
She has never seen GoT but she has heard us geek out over it from time to time. 

""Is this the show you guys are always going on about?""

""Yeah babe, you should watch it. It will blow your mind.""

""Ugh. No thanks. I hate fantasy shows, they are all so predictable and dumb.""

So I chime in, ""This isn't like any fantasy you have ever watched. You should watch it."" 

""Nope. You guys can though, I'll just sit here and read."" 

Okay, that is fine. We will just enjoy it on our own. Slowly but surely her eyes start wandering from her Kindle to the TV.  Next thing you know we are a few episodes in, and you can tell she is trying not to enjoy it. But she so is. 

So week keep watching a few episodes over the next few days and here comes the part where [Season 1](#s ""Good old Robert dies."").

She lets out this guttural sigh and is like, ""Okay, I'm done.""

""Why?""

""Because it's doing the exact same crap every other fantasy does. The king is murdered so his best friend avenges him and becomes king. It's so predictable. Obviously Ned is going to become king. He is the kings assistant guy after all."" 

Nick and I just glance each other really fast.

""You should just keep watching. Trust us it's really good.""

""No. I'm going back to reading. Who ever made these shows should really go back to school and learn better storytelling techniques.""

Now yet again, her eyes wander from her kindle to the screen. We are now at the part where [season 1](#s ""Joffery decided he is going to have poor Ned's head instead of just letting him live out his life on the wall."") 

As they are taking him up to be executed, she is bawking like a chicken how any minute now someone will come off screen and save him.

Any minute now. 

Any minute. 

Here comes Ser Ilyn Payne. 

Any second now. 

Any second.

[Season 1](#s ""The sword falls and cuts off his head- screen fades abruptly to black."")

It goes quiet. I look over at her, and there she is, with the most dumb and confused expression on her face. 

""...did he just?""

""Yep.""

She is still starting at the screen, mouth wide open trying to make sense of what just happened.

Is that a good idea or is there some things in the first two books that weren't in the first two seasons of the show but might pop up in future episodes in season 3?

So, who would you choose to play Lyanna Stark, Lord Commander Gerold Hightower, Oswell Whent, and Arthur Dayne? If you'd like, you can even pick actors for Howland Reed, Willam Dustin, Ethan Glover, Martyn Cassel, Theo Wull, and Mark Ryswell.

As for my choices:

**Oswell Whent**

As my flair over on /r/asoiaf suggests, I have a soft spot in my heart for the Ser Oswell. We don't know much about him, other than that he may have been close with Rhaegar, Ser Barristan characterized him as having a ""dark humor"", and that Jaime holds him in high regard. This is probably my most out there casting decision, but I'd go with **[Bill Hader](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0352778/)**. He's [tall](http://i.imgur.com/zKUZ4Js.jpg), and [very funny](http://i.imgur.com/EJ4Njri.jpg), and I've always pictured the Whents as a sort of odd-looking house. Maybe it's something about the bizarre history of Harrenhal, which the Whents were the last to hold before the events of the books, but I always pictured them as a [sickly, skeletal-looking clan](http://i.imgur.com/HKJE5ti.jpg). I'm always a fan of comic actors getting the chance to stretch out, and [Hader has a lot to offer](http://i.imgur.com/vqFxMKS.jpg).



**Gerold Hightower**

This one was the easiest for me, and the entire inspiration for this whimsical exercise. I would have the White Bull played by **[Stephen Lang](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002332/)**. He's made an entire career of playing hardass military leaders, and [all you have to do](http://i.imgur.com/p4QFqsC.jpg) is look at him [to see why](http://i.imgur.com/g2hPPTq.jpg) he's the perfect [LC Hightower](http://i.imgur.com/MBfvDVy.jpg) for any possible adaption of the scene. He exudes authority and imposing might from his very being, and given that it's such a short, terse tableau I feel the need to cast for types; to build character through our pre-existing conceptions of these actors, which leads me to...

**Arthur Dayne**

I thought about this one for a bit, but the second I thought of this actor, it completely clicked. The Sword of the Morning should be played by **[Ryan Reynolds](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005351/)**. We need the mere visage of these actors to fill all the gaps in characterization, so who better? He's [dashingly handsome](http://i.imgur.com/Ncom0Be.jpg), so you've got your Dayne quasi-Valyrian good looks covered, and he's an [incredibly affable and likable guy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uuPsGx0mBM) (must see link, he recites the Green Lantern Oath at Comic-Con, at a little kid's request), which is a sort of meta way of instilling the whole ""Everybody Loves Arthur"" feeling the books give us. Plus [we know that Ryan Reynolds can wield the hell out of a sword](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnbnJraPOzY) (sorry for the buttcam quality).

So, who ya got?",17,4,False,self,,,,,

We've also noticed that a lot users have been pretty careless with their spoiler tags, specifically scope warnings in titles and the lack thereof.

We certainly don't want to hinder discussion about season 3, so please take the extra time to think about what kind of content you intend to generate with your post before you submit it.  If you want to talk about things that will happen in season 3, make sure you put the appropriate [ASOS/Season 3], or similar, warning in your title.  The red link flair that mods add to posts is meant to be an extra level of spoiler security, not the first line of defense, and *should not be depended on*.

Also, in the excitement for season 3, it seems that a lot of people are becoming lazy or forgetful about tagging comment spoilers, especially in threads that do not have scopes in the title.  It's important to note that, even if the thread was started by a poster of season 3 (for example), if it doesn't have a [warning scope] in the title, the thread should be considered a spoiler-free zone.  Please make sure that when you are posting in a thread on /r/gameofthrones that you are aware of the spoiler scope and that you tag your posts accordingly.

So in short:

* Put appropriate [warning scope] tags in your title -- do not expect the mods to do it for you.
* If you are posting in a thread with no warning scope in the title, you must cover **all spoilers** in the comments with appropriate tags, even for events that occur prior to season 3/ASOS.

In my history studies, I have focused on British History, and this semester I've been in a class on England to 1688. While studying the Heptarchy period (roughly 4th-9th Centuries), i noticed a lot of parallels with the series' premise. Just some that I noticed:

Heptarchy- 7 Kingdoms
-Wessex
-Mercia
-Northumbria
-East Anglia
-Kent
-Sussex
-Essex


* **First Men**-
Celtic Tribes, possibly including the Romans.

* **Andal Invasion**-
Coming of the Anglo-Saxons. While it may not have occurred as a literal invasion, the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes migrated to what is now England and established the Heptarchic kingdoms.

* **Dornish Migration**-
Vikings, perhaps. A culture significantly foreign to the Anglo-Saxons, they occupied much of eastern England and settled there.

* **White Walkers**-
Also possibly Vikings. Northmen who arrived to plunder the lands, and were SCARY AS FUCK to them. The Anglo-Saxons fought with them for decades, being subjugated, liberated, subjugated again. A vast swath of England became known as the Danelaw at one point, where Viking law was dominant over that of the A/S.

* **The Wall**-
Hadrian's Wall, built by the Romans in ancient times. One of the largest, and most impressive structures in England, it was the de jure northern border of England, separating them from the Celtic tribes (Wildlings) in what is today Scotland. Much of Hadrian's Wall still remains today.

* **Targaryens**-
Little harder to place. I think they may be based on William the Conqueror and the Norman Conquest of 1066. They fundamentally changed the nature of England and English society, binding the country together in a unified kingdom. They invaded from across the sea similar to the Targaryens (from the English Channel, in Normandy). After defeating the Anglo-Saxons at the Battle of Hastings, they subdued the land by burning and pillaging through SE England prior to arriving at London. Some credit the Normans' use of mounted cavalry (parallel w/ dragons) as a technological advantage over the A/S, seen in the [Bayeux Tapestry](http://www.bayeuxtapestry.org.uk/Bayeux27.htm) where most A/S forces a on foot whereas the Normans were mounted. The A/S certainly used cavalry forces, but mainly as transportation to battle where they would dismount. 

* **And, most significantly, the Lannisters**-
Prior to the Norman Conquest, there was a family known as the Godwins. Hailing from Wessex in the West of England (like Westerlands in Westeros), the dominant kingdom in the late A/S period, the Godwins were the richest family in England. This presented a problem however, just like in GoT, that the Godwins' power rivaled that of the King, leading to a sovreign that was not the absolute supreme power in the land. Also, the Godwins worked themselves into the royal family by marrying Earl Godwin's daughter to King Edward the Confessor (sound familiar?). After Edward's death, Harold Godwinson, the king's brother-in-law (aka Harold Hadrada) claimed the throne and became king for a short time prior to the Conquest. The Godwin family bloodline was extinguished during the Battle of Hastings.


If this was George R.R. Martin's inspiration, I love it. As a history student, the prospects of educating people about the lifestyle and experience of people in the past through popular fiction sounds like an excellent prospect. While I haven't seen it yet, History's ""Vikings"" may be able to do something similar if they can make a popular series without becoming too historically inaccurate. Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed series also does a good job of playing off historical events for entertainment purposes.

I understand most of you are not history students or history buffs, but the parallels I see are really cool. The fact that GRRM's world once existed in a form in reality make GoT and ASOIAF that much better for me.

I'm sure many of us recognized from the start that ASOIAF was based on medieval Europe, these are just some specific points that I recognized. As I said, I am only a student. If anyone has more detailed information about the period, I welcome your input! Also, I am an American, so I'm not sure how easy it was for my fellow Redditors across the pond to recognize these in their heritage.

So, Reddit, what are your thoughts? Are these coincidence, or do you agree with my conclusions? How does this make you feel about GRRM's work? Does it somehow diminish his series since it is not necessarily original in all aspects? Any other historical periods you think deserve to be similarly popularized?

**tl;dr** There are many close parallels between GRRM's ASOIAF and English history.

Also, for those unfamiliar with the period, Wikipedia has a good entry that covers a lot of the major aspects of what I've mentioned.

I've read through each book twice, and have been following the reddit posts like my life depends on it.  Recently I was looking at the Targaryen Family Tree and noticed the character Brynden Rivers - and the name ""Brynden"" rang a bell with the Children of the Forest thing.  After delving a little more, I realize the two are linked..  for those interested, here is the site: 

http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Brynden_Rivers  
http://awoiaf.westeros.org/images/c/c6/House_Targaryen_Family_tree.jpg

I just kept thinking, where on earth is all this information coming from..?  How are there illustrations of characters I've never even heard of..?  Then, maybe I'm a little slow, I realized most of the references are not actually from Game of Thrones itself, but rather the Dunk &amp; Egg short stories.

My question is this:  For those who have read the Dunk and Egg series, how much does it go into the Game of Thrones storyline..?  I guess it explains more of the Targaryan/Brynden backstory, and I understand Aemon (Knight's Watch maestor) has something to do with the Dunk and Egg, as when he is going in-and-out of consciousness, he keeps referencing someone named ""Egg"" (I assume he was some type of squire)..

This post includes some back story about their relationship which is drawn from the first book.

As a young boy Viserys fled his home with his mother and some men he was told he could trust as his family was slaughtered. Shortly thereafter his mother died giving birth to his baby sister, whom he would protect for the rest of his tragic life. The two were raised together for some time by a knight, but they were both young when the knight died and the others they were to trust betrayed them and stole their wealth.

At this young age, Viserys already understood that the fate of the greatest dynasty rested on his shoulders, and that he was owed something he did not yet have because it was stolen by those who murdered his entire family. We don't see the years that follow -the years on the run where Viserys keeps them moving, afraid of assassins - but Daenerys recalls the cities that they had visited at one point and if she is not mistaken they covered the better part of a continent together. During this time Viserys cannot possible play only the role of Daenery's brother, but he must also play her father as well. His ability to discipline her could sometimes mean their survival (or at least he is genuinely convinced of this), and it's hard to imagine a young boy whose only known those who care for him to die or betray him to come up with much other than violence.

Of course, this was not their entire relationship. Daenerys knows tales of Westeros and her family because Viserys shared his hopes with her. Where she was afraid, he had to be fearless, for to allow that destiny was not on their side - that two children against the world, trying to reclaim a throne as their family and friends and wealth vanished, was an impossible mission - would have broken them. For years he was the only source of safety she had and he confided in her his hopes. And Viserys surely must have had doubts he fought hard to deny and kept hidden. He must have been scared, often.

When we are greeted by Viesrys, his mission has suddenly become plausible instead of impossible-in-denial. One of our first impressions of him is that when his sister objects to the plan, Viserys tells her that he would gladly have her raped by the Dothraki and their horses for their mission. I personally consider this to be untrue, only dramatic rhetoric (that she perhaps fails to pick up on), but that is not central to my argument.

Viserys then watches as Daenerys is given more than he ever is - not just power, not just wealth, but also love. What was so wrong with him? He was a boy that everybody in the world was supposed to respect. He was supposed to have power, but instead the world used its power against him, against his family, every chance it could. He was entitled to his family but they were killed; he was entitled to his wealth but it was taken. And he finally gives a man the one friend he's had his entire life in exchange for an army, and instead he gets nothing and watches as they give to someone else instead. From his birth, he should have been especially respected, yet he has been spat on his entire life. How can he reconcile this with being anything other than worthless?

He doesn't hide his hurt so well - no, he lashes out. At one point he strikes Daenerys and we are very upset, because he see from her eyes and it is this cruel brother who rules her with abuse. How we forget that they are young siblings fighting! Viserys, who should have had power, is watching as his baby sister he protected his whole life is given more power as he is ignored - siblings fight over things that hurt far less deeply.

So he gets drunk one day and makes demands he shouldn't. And when Khal Drogo tells him he will get what he wants, he smiles in disbelief. He's not worthless after all, that's all he needed to know. The scene is very hard for me to watch on the show. He doesn't understand it is a pun, that he is about to be killed as an insult, his death a statement confirming his darkest fear that nothing he ever thought he deserved would ever be his. And then, he is suddenly confused, and afraid, and screams for his sister - who he protected his whole life - to protect him. For mercy, for help.

Up until this point I have tried to argue that Viserys could not be the monster we first perceive him as from what we observe of his interactions with his sister. But suppose you have rolled your eyes at all of this, and think he has been just as cruel to her their entire lives. Fine. Maybe Daenerys only relied on him for safety the majority of her life and had some sort of Stockholm Syndrome.

Either way, as she hears his screams for help and mercy, she should feel something. Grief that a rabid dog must be put down. Fury taken too far. Excitement for relief when his power over her vanishes. Horror that he has gone too far and she is now powerless to prevent the death of the only family and friend she's had through her entire life.
But instead, she is emotionless, then comments that he was always full of shit. I find this more horrifying than anything we witness Viserys do. It's been two seasons and we haven't once seen her cry for him.

(SPOILERS ALL),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1a3nmx/what_do_you_think_will_happen_in_episode_nine_of/,ToxtethOGrady,1363033440,"It's an HBO tradition to have the climax of a season's plot come in the second-to-last episode, and that's certainly been the case with Game of Thrones.

""Baelor"" in season 1 saw the death of our ostensible protagonist. ""Blackwater"" in season 2 was the biggest battle in cable history. If rumors are true, ""The Rains of Castamere"" in season 3 will feature the Red Wedding.

Knowing all that, which events do you think D&amp;D will highlight episode 9 in seasons 4, 5, 6...?

My guesses:

**SEASON 4:** Since Tyrion's trial and the battle at the Wall form the two strongest threads of ASOS's second half, episode nine would be a great place for the Gregor Clegane-Oberyn Martell duel. Stannis arriving at the Wall seems like an obvious choice, too but that happens a lot earlier in the narrative. I could see Jon's election as Lord Commander happening here, too, as well as Littlefinger's famous embrace of Lysa. 

**SEASON 5**: Assuming season 5 and six are a combination of AFFC and ADWD, what should the climax be? With some rejiggering, we could put Dany and Drogo in the fighting pits here. And, to give some thematic unity, we could also throw in Arianne's aborted plot to crown Myrcella.

**SEASON 6**: The book version of ADWD is unfinished, in a way; GRRM and his editors lopped off a few of the final chapters and held them for TWOW. This makes a few of the arcs seem strangely incomplete, a problem HBO can rectify: Put the Battle of Meereen and the Battle of Winterfell (if TWOW reveals it actually took place) here, and give the book an ending again! If that's too expensive, Jon's Julius Caesar moment could work here too.

These are just my ideas, though. What are yours?",50,31,False,self,,,,,

Exit out of this post. Don't spoil this for yourself. Even if you are a book reader, you may not want to read this:


I can confirm that the Red Wedding does happen this season. Most of you already knew that. However, what you don't know is that Robb does NOT die during the Red Wedding. Catelyn is killed and it is her head that is cut off. Grey Wind's fate is left unanswered. Another animal, a goat or some such animal, is sewn to Catelyn's body.


The showrunners were pressured by HBO execs to not kill off Robb. If you haven't seen **Boardwalk Empire** there are spoilers for that show below that play heavily into this.


At the end of the Season 2 finale of Boardwalk Empire last year, the character Jimmy Darmody was killed off. This was huge because Jimmy was a major character and was considered the ""good guy"" of the show. This was a very polarizing decision by Terrence Winter, Boardwalk Empire's showrunner. A lot of fans were upset by this move.

Some of the higher ups at HBO were not happy with how Season 3 of Boardwalk Empire played out this year without Jimmy. They felt that Jimmy's death hurt the show, and they do not want this happening to Game of Thrones. Despite the second season being successful even after the death of Ned and many other characters, they pressured the showrunners to keep Robb alive. They even got GRRM's approval, apparently.


Richard Madden will appear in season 4 as a living, breathing, Robb Stark. How big his role will be, I don't know, but he will be in the show. I have friends who are close to the show, that is where I'm getting my info from.


Believe me or not, you will see by the end of the season.

I have never ever had a hard time to choose who to root for in a tv show, it really shows how well it's written. I think I've narrowed it down to two though; Arya Stark and Tyrion Lannister.

Tyrion Lannister mainly because he's the only one playing the game properly. But now with the events of the end of Season 2 I'm afraid his days of bringing sensibility and rational thought to the kingdom are over.

Arya Stark because she was pretty much collateral damage with the events that happened in Season 1, but also because she has the strength and courage to keep going. Also, because she has the nerve to look Tywin Lannister in the eye and say ""No, my Lord, anyone can be killed"". That part gave me chills.

Even the villains aren't one-dimensional, I absolutely hate Cersei but while they were sitting in the throne room near the end of season 2 I find myself nearly crying as she feared for her and her son's safety.

P.S. This show needs more Mord.

Edit: It's ""Tyrion"" with an ""o"" not with an ""a""! Thanks for letting me know, that stuff always bugs me too!

And to make it worse, he's clearly not a book reader as his response is ""Cool! I hope that retarded looking bird isn't in it though"" Facepalm.

Also, dear super cute girls in line behind talking about how they're getting fed up with the Davos chapters in book 4: who are you, and are you single? 

P.S. Getting a pic taken with the throne was pretty cool, albeit a little underwhelming. The lineup was huge and the pics they take for you are pretty terrible, but you can take your own so BRING A CAMERA!

Also, they let you choose a House sigil to go on your picture. I think the breakdown was like 55% Stark (I head someone say ""whoever the good guys are."" when asked which House they wanted so I can see why) 20% Lannister, 8% Greyjoy, 12% Targaryen, 5% Renly, and 2% Stannis. (I might be forgetting one). I picked Baratheon and was disappointed I had to pick between Renly and Stannis and couldn't get Robert/pre-ACOK Baratheon.",5,2,False,default,,,,,

What was real disappointing was the Dornish story line. For 90% of the book, I hated Doran Martelle for doing nothing at all, he just stood behind Hotah as he watched the water gardens, that is until he revealed his connection to the Targaryens and now I love him. So there are few topics I wanted to open for discussion and perhaps some clarification. For the record, I know about Tower of the Hand, but i find here a better place for discussion:
1.The status of The Hound
2.Intentions of Lady Stoneheart
3.Betrothals between the Dornish and the Targaryens
4.Qyburn's plans, without any spoilers from ADWD
5.Brienne's status, I'm really not sure what's going on anymore, the Greyjoy's are right, ""What is dead may never die""

If I've violated one of the rules please let me know and I'll take this down.

I have 2 VIP passes to the upcoming exhibit, [""Deeper Than Swords,""](http://deeperthanswords.library.tamu.edu) which takes place March 21st and 22nd at Texas A&amp;M University. I'm really excited to go but unfortunately my friend had to bail on me. I've tried to ask around to get a replacement but it's hard to find a friend who's that into the books and can take off work for two days. So, I'm seeing if I can sell it.

The VIP pass includes:
* [A themed dinner hosted by George R.R. Martin](http://deeperthanswords.library.tamu.edu/events.html#Dinner)
* A preview of the George R.R. Martin exhibit
* Special seating at the lecture (where I hope he might read a new chapter from WoW)
* Author signing before the lecture
* ""and other exclusives""

Also, they've announced that following the lecture on Friday there will be an advanced screening of the Season 3 premier episode.

The VIP packages were originally $400 each. I'm not expecting to get face value back but I'd like to get something rather than just eat the cost. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'd like to get $200 for it. 

Lastly, I already have a room booked for a nearby hotel (twin beds), so if this interests you, I'm also looking to split the room (should be about $50). I'm not a weirdo, and I'd be more than happy to speak over the phone or video chat to confirm that. I'm just a huge ASOIAF fan who's been looking forward to this event for months. They mailed me the physical tickets so I could either need to express-mail them to you, but it'd probably be easier to just meet up in person prior to the events. I'll be driving up from Austin so I could meet there as well. 


And on a related note, is anyone else going to the event? Right now I'll be rolling solo so I'd love to meet up w/ some fellow redditors before or after the exhibit.",1,6,False,default,,,,,

In fact, I think it's the most fun I've had reading since I was in middle school or so.  I stayed up way too late on work nights because I couldn't put the books down;  I *had* to find out what happened next.


But try as I might, I just can't make myself sit through the t.v. series.  All those characters I loved and loathed in the books?  There's no time spent in their development in the t.v. series.  So much of the books are about what the characters are thinking, remembering, snickering to themselves, plotting &amp; scheming.  I know it's hard to portray this in live action, but it's like they didn't even try.  


I was heartbroken when some characters died in the books.  But when I watch the t.v. series, I could just care less whether they live or die, mostly because there is no time spent in really introducing you to the characters.  


Anyway, I only made it about 75% of the way through season one, but  even that was a painful slog.  I mostly find myself wanting to play around with my phone or surf the internet rather than pay attention to whatever is going in the show.  


Anyone else love the books but find the t.v. series to be ridiculously overrated? ",11,0,False,default,,,,,

Questions should fit into one of two categories: ""Show Only"" or ""Other Media"". Difficulties should rank from 1 to 3 or so; Easy, Medium, Hard.

Some examples:

**TV Show, 1**

Q: Catelyn Stark was originally from another House of Westeros. Which House is this?

A: House Tully.

**TV Show, 2**

Q: Tyrion uses a number of euphemisms to refer to the act of pleasuring himself. Name at least one of these.

A: Acceptable answers include: ""Milked my eel"", ""flogged my snake"", ""skinned my sausage"", or ""made the bald man cry"".

**Other Media, 2**

Q: Archie Allen, who plays Theon Greyjoy, has a famous sibling. Who is this?

A: Lily Allen, the singer.

**Other Media, 3**

Q: Two prominent actors/actresses from Game of Thrones also appeared in the Christopher Nolan Batman movies. Which two were these?

A: Jack Gleeson (Joffrey) played a little boy that Batman saves in ""Batman Begins"". Aidan Gillen (Petyr Baelish) played a CIA operative who experiences a bad plane crash in ""A Dark Knight Rises"".",0,1,False,default,,,,,

Any help from everyone at Reddit is greatly appreciated, and will save us a lot of time from trying to come up with creative questions on our own. :)

Questions should fit into one of two categories: ""Show Only"" or ""Other Media"". Difficulties should rank from 1 to 3 or so; Easy, Medium, Hard.
Some examples:

**TV Show, 1**

Q: Catelyn Stark was originally from another House of Westeros. Which House is this?

A: House Tully.

**TV Show, 2**

Q: Tyrion uses a number of euphemisms to refer to the act of pleasuring himself. Name at least one of these.

A: Acceptable answers include: ""Milked my eel"", ""flogged my snake"", ""skinned my sausage"", or ""made the bald man cry"".

**Other Media, 2**

Q: Alfie Allen, who plays Theon Greyjoy, has a famous sibling. Who is this?

A: Lily Allen, the singer.

**Other Media, 3**

Q: Two prominent actors/actresses from Game of Thrones also appeared in the Christopher Nolan Batman movies. Which two were these?

A: Jack Gleeson (Joffrey) played a little boy that Batman saves in ""Batman Begins"". Aidan Gillen (Petyr Baelish) played a CIA operative who experiences a bad plane crash in ""A Dark Knight Rises"".",55,26,False,self,,,,,

So when each of these characters were approaching their doom I had expected it. Robb and Catelyn's deaths were being anticipated ever since Robb was approached with the proposal to marry Edmure to Roslin so when it did happen I wasn't as bothered as somebody who didn't know would have been.  
I had no details of Joffrey's death other than that he did. How his death came about was actually somewhat surprising, but when it was mentioned how drunk he was I began to suspect it.  
TYRION KILLS TYWIN!!!! - The message I had read to spoil that death for me. I knew it was coming sometime and when I hit that Tyrion chapter when he escapes I knew that this was going to be his last chance to. It was still a cool moment for Tyrion though.  
 
 
This brings me onto why I loved the ending so much. I had no idea what was going to happen in the Vale. As I was reading Lysa's 'interrogation' of Sansa I was thinking ""nah if Sansa died somebody would have spoiled that for me as well"" yet still I could feel my heart pounding in my chest as I read, never before has a book elicited such a reaction from me. And holy fuck Littlefinger. Never. Trust. Littlefinger. His final put down - ""I've only loved one woman. I promise you ... Only Cat."" - was simply wow. I still don't like that he kissed Sansa though, that storyline doesn't interest me too much, but still a great ending nonetheless.





Having Catelyn come back from the dead to condemn Merrett as well surprised me. I imagine that she was brought back the same way that Beric has been brought back many times but I'm still unsure. The fact that her throat had been so badly damaged that she couldn't speak makes me hate the Freys even more as a simple stabbing to the chest would have sufficed for her, not butchering her neck.

People defend his actions because he's acting of Joffrey's behalf.  So. fucking. what.  He doesn't have to be Joffrey's personal bodyguard.

The good does not wipe out the bad.  Sandor Clegane has committed some terrible acts, and the complete dismissal of what he has done is on the level of people who think that ""Beauty and the Beast"" is so romantic when in fact it should be called ""Stockholm Syndrome: The animated musical"".  Thinking that she can help save him is naive and cliched, the only person who could fix Sandor is himself, [AFFC](#b ""which maybe he will,"")[Speculation](#g ""especially if he becomes champion of the Seven and fights Ser Robert Strong/headless zombie Gregor."")

Sansa and the Hound's interactions were some of my favorite in ACOK, but just because they had an interesting relationship *doesn't mean I wanted them to end up together.*

And as a man of Honor, Robb had to marry her.  Keeping with the Stark M.O., always honorable.

Today I started again and with the rest of the series in mind, [Ep1.02](#s ""when Cersei told Catlyn about how her first child with Robert died of a fever""), it clicked in my head that in [Ep1.01](#s ""someone said something about Jon Arryn having a fever when actually he was murdered by the Lannisters."")

Tyrion: Are you going to leave me?
Shae: You have a shit memory. I am yours, and your mine.
They embrace and the episode cuts immediately to Robb and Talisa being married by what I presume is a septon [in tandem]:
Robb: Father. Smith. Warrior. Mother. Maiden. Crone. Stranger. I am hers and she is mine.
Talisa: Father. Smith. Warrior. Mother. Maiden. Crone. Stranger. I am his and he is mine.

We know from ASOS that Shae testifies against Tyrion at his trial for Joffreys murder in a particularly nasty and hurtful way so her proclamation is, at best, qualified. It could be an outright performance. Since Talisa and these scenes dont exist as such in the books, does this dialogue match portend Talisas role in Robbs downfall? or is it just a coincidence?

Some additional information about Jeyne Westerling and Talisa Westerling that may or may not be relevant:
-Jeyne Westerlings maternal grandmother was some woman  brought back from the east. A frightening old crone, supposed to be a priestess. Maegi, they called her. No one could pronounce her real name, according to Ser Kevan Lannister (ASOS, Tyrion III).
-Volantis is in the east (in relation to Westeros) and Maegyr and Maegi share a resemblance.
-Jeynes mother, Sybell, conspired with the Lannisters on some level against the Starks. She claims to have taken measures to prevent Jeynes pregnancy (AFFC, Jamie VII). (Probably moontea, [ASOS, Catelyn III]).
-Talisas last name is Maegyr, a name shared with Malaquo Maegyr, one of Volantis triarchs (ADWD, The Lost Lord).

While Im not sure definitive evidence exists to determine whether Talisa Maegyr is Jeyne Westerling in disguise as a low level spy reporting on troop movements, casualties, etc., who happens to get close to Robb, and in position for a much bigger operation; or if Talisa Maegyr is the television series device for streamlining the Westerling-Spicer family and Westerling-Spicer-Lannister side of the Red Wedding conspiracy; or if Talisas only role in the show is to be the means by which Robb breaks his marriage compact with the Freys, and a Volantene name was chosen as a nod to the books Westerlings; or some sort of variation of the above.

The matching dialogue from season twos finale, and a sample of the textual evidence from the book series, does suggest that Talisa Maegyr plays an active role in conspiring against the King in the North, whether she twists the knife or not. Or that theres some other benign parallel between Tyrion &amp; Shae and Robb &amp; Talisas relationships.

I'm not so much interested in the merits of the decision to replace (or disguise) Jeyne Westerling or the success or failure of such a move. The first has already been discussed ad nauseum and the second can't really be assessed until the conclusion of Robb and/or Talisa's storyline(s). I am curious about what these two scenes do tell us about Robb and Talisa (and Talisa and Tywin; etc.) Thoughts?",4,7,False,self,,,,,

However, it could be a little too ruthless if they want to soften Dany's character. 

I would like to point out that I am not complaining about whatever direction they will take Dany's character. In fact, I kind of like the idea of juxtaposing her WMD children and her motherly love.

Considering the ""fan favourites"" Tyrion and Dany are not in AFFC it would be a bad move not to include DWD in Season 5.

The problem is, in my opinion, that the last two books are the weakest of the series with not a whole lot happening in terms of action - but combined they make a decent transitional, political story with just enough material.

If HBO decided to stretch AFFC/DWD over Seasons 5 and 6, it'll be literally two years moving characters around the map and it could kill off interest in the show (after the high of Season 3 and 4).

I felt the first three books were a crescendo and while I understand AFFC/DWD were meant to be a ""middle of story"" transition, I feel that they should be combined in one season of 12 or maybe 13 episodes as a setup for the final arc of the WOW and ADOS.

Of course that depends on how fast GRRM can deliver, but does anyone else feel the same way?

So the new EW (the one with Kit Harington and Emilia Clarke on the cover) is out and the big Thrones article inside has an ending that I found telling. There's a wedding at an ornate cathedral and everyone's there: Sansa, Margaery, and Cersei are specifically named. And Cersei and Margaery actually have lines to each other quoted.

There are, obviously, two weddings in King's Landing in the book, but THERE ARE NO TYRELLS AT THE SANSA-TYRION ONE*. It's a huge plot point that they aren't at Sansa's wedding because it's kept secret from them so they don't mess with it. The wedding the article is describing has Margaery (and sounds more ornate than Sansa-Tyrion), so it has to be Joffrey's. If you want more circumstantial evidence, earlier in the article it flat-out says Sansa gets married this season but the paragraph at the end talking about this wedding specifically dances around actually saying she's the bride (because she's not).

So yeah, I'm convinced; it just never made sense they would kill Robb and leave Joffrey alive for 10 months

Then when that didn't happen, I heard it was pushed back to the summer, probably July or so... then when that didn't happen, it was pushed back to October 2012... I was so excited, but then that day came and went and still no paperback.

I was then informed that it would be released in March of 2013. It sounded like a solid plan... release of the new season, a book release to coincide...

I go to check the release date again today, only to find out that it's been pushed back to October of 2013.

Seriously? October?

Freaking ridiculous.. The hard cover has been out for some time, I think it's time for a paperback release. And in case you are wondering, I do 90% of my reading on public transit, so small paperbacks are much easier to carry and take with me. That is why I wait for their release. It feels like the publisher is playing games or something. Stringing fans along, or has there been any ""official"" reasons?

[Book Spoilers, ALL]",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1aj7wh/should_i_continue_finishing_book_5_before_season/,cheezeebred,1363626655,"I've procrastinated as of late, and before I know it, Season 3 is already 2 weeks away! Now normally it would be obvious that I shouldn't need to read the 5th book for a season that's only from book 3. However, I know they are going to have to certain tidbits from Book 5 in season 3 due to the different nature of TV shows.

I'm talking of course about the scenes with Theon and Ramsay Snow. Now I've heard this Bastard of Bolton become hyped up beyond belief from the fans and characters in the book a like. And I basically have one question: I've only read up to the 2nd Jon chapter, so I haven't reached the point in the book that takes place at (presumably) the Dreadfort. I'm a really slow reader and quite busy with work and was wondering if I could skip to the chapters featuring Theon and The Bastard? Or would I be missing out on any important context involving them? I might be able to plow through until I reach the chapter but rushing is not nearly as enjoyable as taking it easy and savoring every last bite. 

The reason I ask is that Ramsay Snow has been so hyped up for me that I just assume his parts must be pretty enthralling to read. I don't know if I should experience Book Ramsay first, or show Ramsay.

So, finally after a long wait, the Game Of Thrones ""Iron Throne Blonde Ale"" is upon us, and suffice it to say, I'm pretty impressed.  
I've been into craft brew for a couple of years now, and was excited when one of my favorite breweries (Ommegang) announced a tie in beer with one of my favorite series (book and television).  Though the announcement of the first beer being a, then perceived, ""simple""  blonde ale did leave me a bit disappointed.  Ommegang makes some fantastic brews, their BPA (Belgian Pale Ale) and their Saison, or Farmhouse ale are among the best of those styles, but I understand a blonde ale is the most accessible style of beer that Ommegang could have gone with, and that there would be more tie in beers to come, so I withheld judgement...until now..

And, as I said I am impressed with this brew. And for a blonde ale it bridges the span of accessibility and complexity that I think both craft beer nuts such as myself and those who are just stepping a toe into the microbrew world can enjoy.  

The flavor profile is not far from what is typical of a blonde, though hints of other spices, such as banana and citrus among others do push this dangerously close to a Saison, though the clear finish cements the blonde ale style with very little bitterness.  Do prepare yourself for a slightly stronger kick though, at 6.5% ABV is about a percent higher than what is normal of the style. The brew pours a hazy gold with a nice thick off-white head. Any glassware style should be appropriate.. A pint glass should work fine if you have one.. (I had mine in a Weizen glass, and it turned out just great).. and I am not one to recommend serving temperatures; so it's your call on that.. Refrigerator temperature into a chilled glass is where I was at.  And while I am a novice at cellering/aging beers, I think blonde ales are usually recommended fresh.     

Overall, good beer something I would could recommend to those who are dabbling into craft brews and are looking for something that is of good quality without getting too adventurous.  And for my fellow beer enthusiasts, It's worth a try.. It might not be anything too special, but still worth a try. I personally don't see myself picking up another bottle, at that price range I'd rather pick up one of Ommegang's other brews, but don't let that dissuade you.. this is a mighty good brew.. and I eagerly await the next tie-in beer.

The camera slowly pans down, and as it does we see deep turquoise water swiftly pass beneath. The camera dips down, whilst picking up speed riding just inches from the water focused on the horizon ahead. 

The camera pivots down to reveal a distorted reflection chopped up by the wavy sea. It's mostly black, but a slight crimson shade is revealed. Hmm, could it be... A screech pierces your ears from the right side. The camera shifts quickly to look just in time to see a mouth full of teeth *snap*. 

The camera rolls to the sky, to the water, to the sky and back again. Once regained and level, the camera looks to the left. You see a golden winged dragon riding along side you. Viserion you playful bastard you. The camera looks to the right to see the deep green wings of Rhaegal, and further off in the distance, the Balerion with full sails is drifting in an endless sea. 

The camera cuts out of Drogon's POV to show the dragons playfully swooping in and out, up and down, in streaks of red gold and green until they reach the ship. [Cut to this scene.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=RWyeCEQmAG0#!)

It makes me think because the series is very close to the source material, so if they condensed the 10 hour seasons down into a 3 hour movie, what would they keep in, what would they take out? 

An example is Lord of the Rings, which in opposite fashion, was condensed into three movies that left out a lot of the source material. If LOTR was made into a TV series instead, the content would have been spread out more and could develop the characters and establish setting more etc.

Anyway, how do you think that would have changed the outcome of Game of Thrones if it was done in films instead of television?",6,0,False,default,,,,,

However, am I the only one who thinks Kit Harington is all wrong for Jon Snow, physically speaking that is?


The show has done a really good job casting characters, but Kit looks nothing like how I imagined book Jon. In the book Jon is skinny and agile, and has a lean face structure. Kit on the other hand is stocky and has a round face. I don't want to say that he has a ""fat face"", because Kit isn't fat(He's actually in great shape), but there's a certain roundness to his face that is just wrong for the character. There are moments in the show where it looks like he has a double chin.

[This is a picture of Kit where he has shorter hair and no beard](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_3jnKT3wsFgg/SnXTlQ6vFII/AAAAAAAAAPI/9Tdz4Isw1_M/s400/kit-harington-1.jpg) I think Kit looks far closer to Jon Snow in that picture then he does in the show. I think maybe his round face has to do with the long curly hair and beard(which is all wrong for Jon in my opinion). Maybe that makes his face look more round?


Does anyone else want them to give Jon a hair cut and shave next season? I know some of you are face palming while reading this thinking ""who the fuck cares"", but honestly, it does sort of taint the character for me. 


I still think Kit does a good job of acting(for the most part), but his appearance just seems off to me.


Also, what are some other superficial criticisms you have of the show?

Tyrion literally has no nose by the end of book 2 and by the end of season two and from images of season three, he has a more or less fully complete nose with a scar on it. In the case of Brienne, it's not as drastic a difference but although Gwendoline Christie isn't the typical pretty women and is made to look rough in the show, she's still not the broken nosed Ogre women described in the book. 

There is obviously good and sound reasoning behind why they cast these individuals and made certain character design choices in the show, such as maximizing sex apeal and using less resources in the make-up department. 

But would you have preferred a more true to the book approach to casting, or do you appreciate the direction the show has taken?

What will happen to him as the Targeryan host moves north with possible Dornish backing?  I guess this also brings questions about Stannis.  The Hand of the King does not seem to stand for long, are Davos and Stannis keeping each other in touch with a deep understanding of honor?  Is this keeping both of them alive?  Who will be Azor Ahai reborn? Daneryus? Will she ever wield a sword in battle?",3,0,False,self,,,,,

I recently started reading the first book, and am already pretty addicted. I can't wait to start the series too as I've heard so many good things about it, but I have always had this rule that the book must come before the film/series. So I was wondering where the books and series overlap, so I can know when to start watching without ruining anything. Is it the first book = first series, second book = second series etc.? I know I could google it, but I really don't want to risk seeing any spoilers at all. Thanks for your help!",5,1,False,default,,,,,

**Spoiler free review**


First of all, let me say how wonderful it was to see this show on the big screen in a stadium seating movie theater with a bunch of other eager fans in Times Square.  I hope your television, my television, your computer, whatever, can convey how beautifully shot this show is...the things shot on location are stunning, the built sets are stunning, the CGI backdrops are stunning...it *looks* better than before, and I say that with no insult to season 1 or 2.  This season is a step up.


The effects are spread across the episode, and look damn solid.  Also, they seem more comfortable in these settings.  There was no shot or moment that said, ""Look at *this*!  Impressive, eh?""  Even in impressive scenery, the characters were the focus; the episode had a confidence about its production values, like it wasn't trying to impress you with how big a budget it has on tv, but rather that this is just how its supposed to look.


Not much plot happens in the episode.  I don't mean that as a criticism, but some may feel it was rather uneventful.  Things certainly happen...new characters arrive, there are meetings, old characters return...but it is very much a ""setting the stage"" episode.  The aftermath of Blackwater and the rest of last season is dealt with, and the very beginnings of what will come is only hinted at.  Despite this, there are some terrific moments.  Three or four different scenes of two characters battling verbally stand out as some of the strongest bits of performance I've seen in the series.  There are some gruesome things I didn't expect them to show, and some budget-draining things I didn't expect to make it.  All in all, while it has a few ""wow!"" moments, this episode is more about getting us all reacquainted with old friends, meeting some new ones, almost a calm before the storm.


[SPOILERS FROM EPISODE 1 OF SEASON 3](/s ""Prologue!  There is a prologue; a pre-credit sequence.  They made a smart move taking Ghost out of Jon's storyline and leaving him with the Old Bear and the rest of those fleeing the White Walker attack on the Fist of the First Men.  A very impressive Ghost gets to help with some badassery during the retreat.  Then, credits.  We have a new city in the credits:  Astapor, complete with clockwork chains and a giant clockwork Harpy.  Winterfell is different in the credits; it smokes constantly, a complete ruin except for the Heart Tree.  Peter Dinklage and Charles Dance share an incredible scene together; one of Peter's best bits of work, as he pleads for what he feels he deserves and Tywin responds with his usual warmth.  It is INTENSE.  Despite my calm before the storm comment, some sequences are rather intense.  Davos has a particularly wonderful though brief scene near the end of the episode that executes a lot of his storyline in an efficient and effective manner.  I'm sorry I'm sort of all over the place in these spoilers...I'm writing as I remember things, so its out of order.  I'm sure some bookreaders will be disappointed in this - not me - but there is no Arstan Whitebeard.  He tells his name flat out, Jorah recognizes him, the completely dispense with that subterfuge.  I think its a smart move; while fun at the time, that deception isn't necessary and would just take up valuable time.  The dragon-over-the-water shot is a longer effects shot than the trailers let on.  You might suspect that it, as a showcase shot, was just what we saw in the trailers and then the dragons hide in a box.  Nope.  We see all three playing in the air.  We see them dive for fish around the boat, and toss fish in the air roasting them and then catching them.  We see Dany pet a dragon head the size of a melon.  They go to Astapor, and Missandei has been aged up significantly.  Also, she's SUPER HOT and is wearing something that would be...inappropriate...on her in her book age.  An unsullied gets his nipple cut off; I cringed.  Kit Harrington has a great sequence with Ciarin Hinds, our Mance.  It changes slightly from the books, but cleverly incorporates an addition by HBO that wasn't in the books from season 2 and makes it more relevant.  Much like the nipple cutting, I was not expecting to see a giant, nor one rendered so wonderfully.  It's a DAMN impressive giant.  The Tyrells in King's Landing have a couple of really nice character development scenes that are not in the books, one involving dinner with Joffrey and Cersei in which all present at the table subtly jab at each other, barely contained smiles and evil glances; Joffrey and his mother even exchange some barbs as the Tyrells plant the seeds of discord.  There is a brothel scene.  Ros is in the episode, but the direction they are taking her character in is actually fairly interesting, in my opinion.  I'm rambling now, aren't I?  Not so much a review anymore, so I'll stop just spoiling things."")



If anyone has specific questions about the episode or how something is pulled off, please ask=)  All in all, a solid and entertaining episode that only left me eager for #2 (and damn me, now I have to wait *even longer* to see it than if I had waited until the 31st!)",71,66,False,self,,,,,

As for individual characters and accomplishments, who knows... but in terms of what it's building to, how can this *not* be White Walkers vs Dragons?

The series is literally called **A Song of Ice and Fire.** Ice = White Walkers, Fire = Dragons. Daenerys is off doing her own thing in a nearly separate story line, waiting to converge with the rest of the characters. She has been given dragons by GRRM under the assumption that they can and will fuck shit up eventually. So there's looming threat #1.

Looming threat #2 is the White Walkers. Eventually, in book 7 probably, it'll be dragons vs zombies, ie, a fight of ice and fire. I'm sure I'm not the only one to see this, but I've been lurking on these boards for over a year now and have never seen it brought up.

I know this might be a bit of a stretch, but bare with me. 

* Sansa's direwolf was named Lady: Sansa herself is becoming more and more of a Lady, being ultimately groomed to marry the heir to the Vale.


* Arya's wolf is Nymeria, a famous warrior queen. Arya is training to be an incredible warrior and assassin and a lot of people are predicting that she will leave the faceless men and return to Westeros later on.

* Jon Snow: Ghost. As everybody who has read the books knows, Jon is stabbed in the last chapter of ADWD and the common theory is that he will warg into ghost, thus preventing his death, but effectively making him a ghost.

* Robb: Grey Wind. (This one is probably the biggest stretch of all). Robb's life as King in the North was like a wind: He blew strongly and made a huge impact, before suddenly dying away. 

* Bran: Summer. Bran is currently North of the Wall, learning how to Greenseer and I'd bet a lot of money that he will be instrumental in ending the winter that's bringing the White Walkers down from the far north.

* Rickon: Shaggydog. Rickon has run off with a wildling woman to an island full of cannibals and unicorns. Even before this, he was described as growing wilder and wilder.

does he say this whole ""not today"" thing in the books?  I read the books awhile back and I just can't remember if that was in the books or not.  I no longer have my copies of the books so I can't just go and look.  Can any of you tell me if this is from the books or if it was just something they put into the show?
thanks",19,12,False,self,,,,,

Am I the only one that is starting to think that what he ""did to"" Lyanna was get her pregnant which lead to the birth of Jon Snow?  It would explain why he would look a lot like Eddard and I would still find it hard to believe that he would go against his honor with a whore.

Obviously Eddard would want to keep that from Robert, so he would say that he killed her when she probably just died in childbirth.  If I recall correctly, they were lovers at some point weren't they?

Apparently, I'm not the only one, and someone with skills produced a Fan Edit of Season 1 of the Walking Dead which cuts about 1/2 of the first season, trimming away a lot of the repetition and bad dialogue to a tight, exciting 3 hours of tv. 

It got me thinking...given the way that Season 2 had a strange mix of higher highs and lower lows than Season 1 (notably the strange handling of Robb's marriage, Catelyn letting Jaime go free, Jon's storyline, Dany's storyline)...wouldn't Season 2 of Game of Thrones be perfect for a fan edit?

Now, I have no video skills whatsoever, but I was wondering how Season 2 could be fixed. My initial thoughts:

* Move the scene where Robb and Catelyn find out about the taking of Winterfell (since we haven't yet had a scene about them finding out about the ""deaths"" of Bran and Rickon) to right before Robb sleeps with Talissa and Catelyn frees Jaime, follow those scenes with Robb confronting his mother about freeing Jaime, her talking to him about why he can't marry Talissa, then the marriage. That at least better approximates the original ACOK/ASOS plotline, and gives better motivation to both Robb and Catelyn. Don't know if you could fix the Talissa-for-Jayne substitution, but maybe you could improve it by leaving in the lines where they make it seem like it's an obvious cover story, and then cut her backstory speech down?

* Consolidate Dany's storyline into 2-3 episodes. Her in the desert and arriving in Qarth, the Party Scene, her dragons being stolen (you could even cut Irri's death!), the confrontation with the Thirteen, the House of the Undying. Keep the ""where are my dragons!"" to a minimum and get right to magical weirdness, and I think this plot improves significantly.

* Fix Jon's storyline by reducing the number of times he screws up. Cut from him seeing the White Walker pick up the baby to Mormont saying ""the Wildlings serve crueler gods,"" and be very careful not to not cut to Jon's beaten-up face, then go straight to the Fist of the First Men. Then the first bit with Quorin up to him charging after Ygritte. Maybe keep the horizontal lapdance and Ygritte's comedic monologues while minimizing the wandering around, cut from the introduction of Jon Snow to Rattleshirt to Quorin's whispers about becoming a spy to the duel (i.e, leave out the bit where he explains that Jon got all the rangers killed).

* I was personally fine with this change, but you could re-order the Cressen thing so that Mel drinks first (is that the ""Han shot first"" of ASOIAF?)

* You could really easily fix the bit where Bran and Rickon are supposed to ""die"" by leaving out the bit where they encounter the farm. Much less telegraphing, much more believable scare and later reveal.

* For those who didn't like this scene, you could excise the whole of the Cersei/Littlefinger scene without damaging any plot lines.

What would you do?

Every quarter we have a 21 and over night centered around a theme (usually something pop culture). We encourage costumes and put together hand-on activities centered around the theme.

For example: ""Blood Thirsty Thursday"" was a zombie theme. We had demonstrations of ""virus spreading"" with powder visible in blacklight. Bone identification lab (how to tell if these are your Mom's bones or your Dad's), etc. 

""Spyence"" was a James Bond science night. 
...you get the idea...

We're thinking of trying a Game of Thrones night, and none of us are massive Game of Thrones fans. So, naturally I figured r/gameofthrones was the most logical place to get feedback.

We were thinking of taking a Middle Ages angle with the science activities and working in some full moon goodness (since it'll be on the full moon in April). 

Is this the correct approach? Do the Game of Thrones faithful have some particular elements of the show they want scientifically explained? 

Thoughts on this idea in general? ",51,30,False,self,,,,,

What we know (from Winter Is Coming and trailers) 

- Talisa will be there 

- Wendel Manderly has been cast this season and will be there 

- Auditions put out for amputees, and also for cello players 

- Reports of a large battle scene at the Twins, and reports of the gruesome Robb-Grey Wind headswap. 

Some screenshots from trailers which are likely from the RW: 

[A shot from the S3 ""War"" Preview](http://imgur.com/a/GQRsB). The scenery and mounted cavalryman seem to point to this being the massacre of Robb's army camp, with the fires and destruction. 

[One from the ""All of us"" preview and one from the Red carpet feature](http://imgur.com/a/93WTj). We see a large hall full of the guests being received, and I spot in the first pic: Cat, Wendel, Talisa, Robb, and Roose right behind him. The second picture shows a stressed Cat and a distracted Robb at the feast. Looming behind them, seems to be Lord Walder himself up on the table. Above on the balcony, you see the blurry outlines of the ""musicians"", with the instruments in their hands, soon to be wielding crossbows. I already have *heh* ringing through my hears. I'm sure David Bradley, who is actually Argus Filch from Harry Potter, will be great as the Late Lord. People will hate him all over again

Here's what I would like to see. The song ""Rains of Castamere"" begins and continues in the background, getting louder and louder. Cat getting more and more suspicious, confronting some Frey, we see he's wearing armor, she slaps him. Robb gets angry, the crossbowmen fire, madness erupts. 

I want some form of the Smalljon's act, one of my favorite in the series. His first reaction is to rip off the *entire table* and hurl it over Robb as a shield, before finally dying. I can see Wendel doing this, since no Umbers seem to be cast for this season sadly (here's hoping Greatjon will escape his captivity to fuck people up in the future, the Umbers are all legends). 

Catelyn struggles over to get Jinglebell, who's portrayed as being as harmless and simple as he was in the books. Maybe intercut with all this are scenes of the butchery outside: destruction of the Northern army, slaughter, Grey Wind fighting his last fight :(( , and of course Arya with the Hound. Arya looks terrified and confused. But she's determined to finally get back to her family. Grey Wind is struck with bolts and howls. They could fit Talisa in here. And all the while: ""And who are you, the proud lord said"" and the rest. 

Robb gets up, Cat trembling pleads Walder to spare Robb for Jinglebell,  she tells Robb to go. Robb says something along the lines of what he said in the book: ""Mother, Grey Wind... Talisa"". Walder shrugs it off, uncaring and merciless. Roose steps up to Robb, it looks as if he's going to protect his king. 

*Jaime Lannister sends his regards*. Stab, Robb's dead. Cat loses it, murders Jinglebell, and claws at her face. The Freys grab her, some variant of *Not my hair, Ned loves my hair*, they cut her throat. 

Outside: Arya runs as fast as she can to the Twins, chaos everywhere. Sandor yells at her, she doesn't stop. He rides towards her, raises his axe, she's still running, the axe goes down, and Arya falls. *Greg Spence*

I haven't really mentioned Talisa, since the point of the RW is Robb and his army's betrayal and deaths, and Cat's grief and madness. Views on how you want this episode to play out?

Let me explain.


I'm a great fan of Game of Thrones, both the show and the books but I feel like in an island among my friends because they don't care about it. I can't comment or talk or discuss about this topic with them and soon I'm being ignored. The internet with communities from all around the globe and reddit principally help to fill this hole.

Anyway, with less than a week to the 3 season, I'll be watching it alone and I feel like losing a great deal of the fun without somebody to watch together and watching his reactions!

Yeah, the public reaction! The book readers know what I'm talking about. It's something like this (Star War spoil warning):

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qn966F69ctA

Well, actually I expect more like this kid's reaction: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbV5hn_ET0U

Well, I know it is weird, but I think it worth asking. There will be surprises and great turns in the GoT history and I'm willing to see the general reaction to those scenes.

I think the begining of the 3rd season will be slow or without surprises but later on... Well, you'll see by yourself and I'd love to see your face when that happens :D

I've decided to come up with a drinking game for my friends and I to play when we watch the season premiere. I know there are plenty of variations out there, but I came up with a twist I couldn't find. I'm going to split the reasons to drink into various houses. Each player will select houses (or have them randomly chosen) that they will drink for. At the end of the episode, the person who drank the most will be declared victorious.

Currently I have things broken down into four houses and a fifth ""All drink"" category. I'll share which houses I'm thinking of using and a couple examples for each.

Let me know what you think and give suggestions for each house.

House Lannister drinks when: 

* Tyrion or Cersei drinks

* Cersei references genitals 

* Joffrey has someone maimed or killed 

* Someone says ""A Lannister always pays his debts"" 

* Tyrion is called an imp, dwarf, or half-man 

* Jaime makes a condescending comment towards Brienne (drink again if it's sexual in nature)
 
House Stark drinks when:

* Someone says ""Winter is coming""

* Someone calls Jon Snow a bastard or Lord Snow

* Someone says ""The King in the North""

* A direwolf is shown (drink twice if the wolf does something badass)

* Sansa tells an obvious lie about how loyal she is to Joffrey

* Arya repeats her ""to kill"" list

* Ygritte tells Jon Snow that he knows nothing

* Hodor Hodors

House Targaryen drinks when:

* Dany says her full name and title
 
* Someone calls Dany ""Khaleesi""
 
* Dany says ""MY dragons""
 
* Dragons appear on screen (drink again if they breathe flame)
 
* Someone says ""Fire and Blood""
 
* Dany speaks Dothraki
 
* Jorah tries to lecture Dany

House Baratheon/Greyjoy (planning to combine since otherwise Stannis would be lonely and he doesn't prompt nearly as many drinks as Dany) drinks when:

* Stannis calls himself the ""rightful king""

* Melissandra looks into the flames or references the flames showing her something

* Someone says ""The night is dark and full of terrors""

* Someone mentions the Red God or the Drowned God

* Theon whines

* Someone says ""We do not sow"" or ""What is dead may never die""

* Someone references the Greyjoy fleet, but no more than one ship is shown (drink again if none are shown)

All drink when:

* Nudity (again if it is male nudity)

* Littlefinger or Varys makes a vague comment about secrets they know (drink again if Varys mentions his little birds)

* Margaery smirks

* Sam does something cowardly

* Dolorous Edd says something acerbic

* Anyone mentions Ned Stark or Robert Baratheon

**A new named character is introduced (optional rule if you want to get DRUNK)**

Pardon me if this has been answered. I looked around prior to posting this, but didn't see what I was looking for. 

I'm wondering when season 3 episodes will be available to purchase and watch streaming via xbox arcade. Other shows, like Walking Dead, usually only have a 24 hour delay. 

Is anyone here familiar with watching GoT on XBLA, is there a published Xbox release date?

This would, of course, assume R+L=J.

Now, Jon is, from what I understand, named after Ned's foster father Jon Arryn. Makes sense. Jon Arryn was a very influential figure in Ned's life.

But what if Ned didn't name the boy? What if Rhaegar and Lyanna named the boy while he was still in the womb? Maybe he wasn't named after Jon Arryn at all, but, in fact, was named after Rhaegar's good friend Jon Connington?

I know that this is nothing mind blowing. It's just a neat thought I had. I could be wrong. I don't remember if it was ever stated that Ned named the boy himself. Anyway, share your thoughts if you like, or let me know if I'm mistaken.

Also, there be spoilers below through book 2/season 2!!

The Song of Ice and Fire/Game of Thrones is a commentary on sexuality and sexual politics in the world and how a heterosexual monogamous male dominated society is bad.  Here are the basic ideas of this theory with more detailed explanations for each below:

- Westeros represents standard patriarchal society where male aggressiveness results in constant conflict and a tearing apart of society (the kingdom).

- The Wall and the Night's Watch  represent gay men with special nods to the Catholic priesthood.   

- Daenerys Targaryen represents feminism and a desire for female dominated society.


The society of Westeros represents common western patriarchal power structure.  Men and women marry into monogamous relationships and have children.  The men pass on their power and holdings to their sons.  Meanwhile, the whole structure of Westeros is crumbling due to male aggressiveness, competition for power, and sexual repression.  Wars have broken out and there is civil and social unrest.  There is backbiting, underhanded dealing, betrayals, and sex outside of normal monogamy.  In fact, there is way more sex shown outside of monogamy than there is ever shown within it.  The entire society is in turmoil because people just want sexual freedom.  At the beginning of the story who is shown as the Westeros ideal?  The Starks.  The word ""stark"" is defined as  ""unpleasantly or sharply clear; impossible to avoid.""  They are shown as the unpleasantly or sharply clear model of heterosexual monogamous happiness and what happens to them?  They are killed, crippled, they are torn apart from one another, made into hostages, political slaves, and turned into killers.  And most of them are still children!  George R.R. Martin is showing us that the ideal cannot be maintained.  

George R.R. Martin's Wall Watchers are an analog for gay men joining the Catholic church.  When they join they take the black and have no sex with women.  They are there to fight ""Wildlings"" who live north of the Wall.  The Wildlings refer to themselves as the ""Free Folk"" and live life free of the social restrictions imposed by Westeros society.  They engage in behaviors to fulfill their base animalistic desires while the men in black are the line on a sexual frontier and strive to hold back these wild ""Free Folk"" behind a massive wall.  Instead of exploring that frontier they lock themselves, celibate, behind the wall which visually represents the monolith of god fearing social values who keeps safe the heterosexual monogamy of Westeros.  The Wall is made of ice, which is bitterly cold and refuses the heat of sexual energy.  And who makes up these Wall Watchers?  They are bastards and outlaws.  Outcasts, much like homosexuals were in our society until relatively recent times.  Due to the active hate and distrust for gays, decades ago homosexuals had only one place to go to avoid heterosexual monogamy, which was the Catholic church to become priests dressed in black.  There they stayed to create a community amongst themselves, isolated, celibate, and outside the norm, in a effort to reinforce social and sexual values while not participating in either.  And what is coming next over the Wall?  The White Walkers, a representation of out in the open gays.  They are white (code for semen), they are mindless and cannot be reasoned with (in closed-minded hetero society outwardly gay men are seen as cock hungry beasts unable to control their desires), their appearance is that of openly monstrous abominations,  and they are unstoppable.

Now we get to Daenerys Targaryen.  She represents  a feminist, matriarchal run society, which steps far outside the Westeros (as well as our world) norm.  She is shown to be something special and different from other humans due to her white hair and ability to control dragons, which are creatures outside of normal nature (they are large flying creatures who can breathe fire and whose bones are immune to fire).  The sigil for House Targaryen is ""Fire and Blood"".  The fire is indicative of the feminist movement of bra burning and the blood is a suggestion of menstruation, a solely female body function.  What journey does Daenerys Targaryen take in this story?  She goes from innocent virgin, to being sold as basically a sexual slave to a man who takes her as his wife where she learns how to be a woman from other women, and then becomes a widow.  After this compressed harrowing journey through the female life cycle it is then she finds her power.  She becomes a queen, gaining a special power thought to be extinct (three dragons), winning the affection of her subjects with love, not through money or power (because she has neither), leads those loving subjects through a desert wasteland where they do not give up hope, and takes them into a city of power-and-wealth wielding men who attempt to confine her, trick her, and betray her and her feminine ideal.  She triumphs over them and sets her sights on Westeros, the land of patriarchal heterosexual monogamy.

George R. R. Martin is telling us that the lack of sexual freedom in a patriarchal heterosexual monogamy structure is destroying the very society it is trying to uphold because humans just want to be free to indulge in their desires.  With the seemingly inevitable waves of things from above the Wall and from beyond the sea he is telling us that that change is coming.  We are meant to pay attention to these fronts so strongly that the series is actually called ""A Song of Ice and Fire"".

I am a show watcher, have not touched the books yet and feel like a conversation between two friends I was a part of may have ruined season 3 for me a bit. I can't shake this feeling and my excitement sort of fizzled. 

I just want to share what it is I know and I am curious as to whether or not I know too much or too little so that the event is still a nice shock or surprise.

So my friends were talking and the one turned to me and said [ASOS Spoiler](#b ""to get ready for the Red Wedding where Jaime sends his regards to Lady Catelyn during the Tully Wedding. So I took from that that there is some sort of wedding crash."")

I feel like that sort of knocks the wind out of what could have been a big surprise waiting to happen instead I feel like I'm going to be expecting it. I normally stay far far away from here due to the fact that I have not caught up to the books and HATE spoilers. And I know this sort of question sort of prods a minor spoiler in saying whether or not I know too much and the season's big moment is ruined. I may very well be off base or know absolute nothing and the big surprise still awaits me. 

Sorry if this post is a little off base. I'm just a little worried and figured you'd guys would be able to help.

I know this has been debated to death over countless websites and GoT gatherings. (R+L=J vs Wylla etc etc.) But when everyone discusses evidence, I feel as though one HUGE, ENORMOUS fact is underrepresented in this whole big, epic debate. That is: 

The kingsguard.

When Ned went to go rescue Lyanna, she had 3 kingsguard knights in the Tower of Joy defending her. If i'm not mistaken, the kingsguard's job is to defend the ROYAL FAMILY, and at this moment in time, Rhaegar has already been killed at the Trident, so WHY would the kingsguard be with Lyanna?

IF this hasn't been theorized before, I would speculate that Rhaegar and Lyanna secretly married. I'm pretty sure the history of Westeros has something about kings and princes taking on multiple wives in the past, so it's plausible. If this is the case, then Jon Snow WOULDN'T be a bastard at all. He'd be a legitimate Targaryen.

**Tyrion** - I'm actually leaning towards him poisoning Joffrey as the final scene of Episode 10, but maybe they'll cut it off earlier than that. So, same end point for Cersei and Joffrey.

**Daenerys** - Astapur attack, saving all the Meereen stuff for next year

**Catelyn/Robb** - well.... the RW in Episode 9, obviously

**Bran** - he doesn't really do anything in this book or the next, so he'll probably only even be in 3 or 4 episodes anyway.

**Arya** - probably when she gets knocked out by the Hound

Did I forget anyone? Anyway, all speculation. What do you guys think?",55,10,False,self,,,,,

In the second episode, after Bran gets pushed from the tower, Tyrion walks in on the Lannister family having breakfast, mentions that Bran may live, and further conversation regarding the subject ensues. Throughout this whole scene, Jaime and Cersei are exchanging nervous glances. At the end of the scene Cersei takes her kids, leaving Jaime alone with Tyrion. Tyrion tells Jaime he would like to know what the boy (Bran) has to say about his fall, to which Jaime basically asks him which side he's on. I'm guessing here that Jaime caught on to Tyrion's probing, and he knows that Tyrion figured them out. 
Here's the best part: Tyrion then says, ""You injure me, you know how much I love my family"". Was that blatant sarcasm? We know how he hates Tywin, Cersei, and Joffrey. Was Tyrion implying that he wasn't on the Lannister's side this time?

The following is what resulted.  




Some Knights  




Some knights are Lannisters of Casterly Rock  

Some knights still support Aegon  

Some knights wish their ship could raid a castle  

Some knights know that winter has come  




But your Other wakes up, I still see your form  

R'hllor, I'm still not sure about Melisandre  

Oh Melisandre...Oh Melisandre  

Most knights don't know who's dead anymore  




Arya:  

This is it Joff, this is war--what'd you threaten my direwolf for?  

Let's use the pointy end already.  

I was never one to be ladylike--left my eyes in the House of Black and White  

The Greyjoys will never stay on Pyke, but here Theon comes to take back his isle  




Tyrion:  

And here's my plight: I found Shae in my father's bed tonight  

Strangled her with my own chain of hands...the hand, the hand, the hand

Oh patricide? mmm...mmm...  




Well some knights fight for Daenerys Targaryen  

They want to see some dragons for a change  

And some knights wish for Baratheons again  

For some knights, Stannis wins, Stannis wins  




But your Other wakes up, I still see your form  

R'hllor, I'm still not sure about Melisandre  

Who is Melisandre? Who is Melisandre?  

Most knights look down on Crows.  




Catelyn:  

So this is it? 

I lost my life for this?  

Lost my tongue and died for this?  

I miss my sons and Ned for this?  





Jon:  

No. When I see Starks, 

when I see, when I see Starks, that's all they are.  

When I hear Crows, they sound like I do, so I'm in.  

Oh I''m in. Oh I'm in. Oh, I'm in.  




Myrcella:  

Well this is it Arys, you fell--five minutes in and I'm alone again  

Twelve years of life, I'm not sure of anybody's designs  

This one is not for the folks at home; Sorry to leave mom, I seek the the throne  

Why the fuck did Arys have to die for me all dried up in the desert sun?  




Jamie:  

My oath is breaking for my sister because she calls me ""love""  

When I look into my ""nephews'"" eyes...  

Man, you wouldn't believe my children are kings all because of...  

Circe's lies  




Oh woah, oh woah, oh woah, oh oh  

oh woah, oh woah, oh woah, oh oh  




Bran (to his direwolf):  

Summer, you wouldn't believe the green dream I had about you and me  

I ran with you, but as you can see  

I can't go the distance  

I wish my legs were working...oh...  

I can't go the distance

Ned was a main character in GOT, sure. But he lasted less than one book. While he may have had an important role, when looked at through the prism of the entire series, he's really barely even in it at all. His whole point in the series, really, was his death.

Catelyn died brutally... but came back, at least sort of. Lady Stoneheart may not be *exactly* the same as her, but she looks like her and continues her motivations (albeit with a lot more blood and vengeance). So this can only really count for ""half a main death"" if that.

Quentyn Martell and Arys Oakheart weren't exactly major by any means.

As far as non-POV characters, Robb was sort of important... but even then, he was basically an important guy in the background of one and a half novels. He barely served a purpose in the first book.

Joffrey is important, but his death was inevitable. Not only was he one of the worst villains in the series, there was only so far the story could go with him in it. His death wasn't exactly a surprise.

Khal Drogo seemed important, but much like Ned, he was created more for his death than anything. Lasting less than one book hardly makes you a ""main character.""

I could go on and on and on. Point is, the real MAIN characters have always been Daenerys (who has total plot armor), Jon (who has a little bit, which is why I highly doubt he's simply ""dead""), Tyrion, the Lannister twins, Arya, Sansa, Bran, and Stannis simply for being the last Baratheon.

They've been around since the first book, except Stannis, and have played important roles in the overall story. Honestly, I think instead of killing off main characters, he builds interesting characters that are feigned as important so that he can kill them and keep us on our toes. Which, actually, is brilliant. But the ""don't have a favorite person, he'll kill them!"" joke is a bit silly when nearly everyone he kills isn't that fleshed out as a character or doesn't last for more than one novel.

Thoughts? If someone has a good counter argument I'm all ears and willing to be convinced of my error :)",14,6,False,self,,,,,

The Watch is not only outside the jurisdiction of the state (in this case the Iron Throne, representing the united seven kingdoms), but rather it is itself a state, complete with territory (the Wall and the Gifts) and a structured system of governance. 

Furthermore, the Night's Watch is essentially a buffer state (between the wildlings and Westeros) and a vassal to the Iron Throne, relying on it for supplies and men. While the Watch seems to have nearly complete sovereignty over its internal affairs, this dependence on King's Landing necessarily leaves it vulnerable to outside political influence from its southern benefactor should the need ever arise (e.g., your supply of men stops if you don't appoint X as Lord Commander). 

One of the things most interesting about relationship between the Watch and the Iron Throne is the essential quid pro quo at the heart of the relationship: the Seven Kingdoms give the Watch men, and the Watch gives the Seven Kingdoms protection. During the time of the books this understanding has clearly deteriorated, as the return on the Iron Throne's investment in the Watch is not as evident as it was in the past, now that the memory of the white walkers has been buried in a 1,000 years of uneventful winters and long summers. 

Thus from mutual dependence, the relationship between the Seven Kingdoms and the Watch has devolved into one of unilateral reliance for all necessities of life. To remedy this, The Watch, which already levies taxes on those living in the Gift and New Gift, should encourage settlement of these sizable territories. Any number of policies could attract settlers, not the least of which being protection from the ravages of war in the south. The ban on women, too, should be lifted, so as to boost numbers. These measures would eliminate the reliance on the Iron Throne for personnel, as well as considerably aid the Watch's finances. 

It would take only small steps such these to constitute full independence for the Night's Watch, making it essentially and eighth kingdom--and an at least partially democratic one at that--of Westeros. 

Also, does anybody have a good recipe for mulled wine?

Prologue and Epilogue characters aside, we've lost three POV characters (four if you count Cat, which I suppose is true enough (five if you believe Jon dead) ). I'd wager that shit will *really* be hitting the fan in TWOW, and quite a few POVs will get offed.

Who is on the chopping block and why? I'm curious to see everyone's theories. Please refrain from just listing your least favorite characters and why you want them to die. This is for characters that you truly believe are soon to die. Note that this is for *POV characters only*. Characters such as Euron Greyjoy, Stannis (the Mannis) Baratheon, Ramsay Bolton, etc. are off the table. 

Remaining POV characters are, to refresh:

-Jon Snow (maybe/possibly/probably)

-Daenerys Targaryen

-Tyrion Lannister

-Jaime Lannister

-Arya Stark

-Bran Stark

-Sansa Stark

-Cersei Lannister

-Theon Greyjoy

-Asha Greyjoy

-Aeron 'Damphair' Greyjoy

-Victarion Greyjoy

-Davos Seaworth

-Samwell Tarly

-Brienne of Tarth

-Arianne Martell

-Areo Hotah

-Barristan Selmy

-Jon Connington

-Lady Melisandre

I'll begin:

I think we'll soon be seeing the last of Victarion Greyjoy. Badass as he is (and he is *quite* badass), he's not going to be making it back to Westoros. What with a big battle coming in Meereen, the fact that he's attempting to steal the Mother of Dragons (and her dragons), and his general, erm, lack of guile, he's not going to make it out of the book alive. I don't doubt that he'll get a pretty big body count before he goes, and I expect something to be done with that horn of his, but not what anyone's expecting, and it may very likely blow up in his face. Regardless of whether he's roasted alive by dragon fire, felled by swarms of Second Sons, or something else unforeseen, Victarion will burn out (heh) in The Winds of Winter.

The rest of you are better at postulating than I am, though.

And, so one of you doesn't get a chance to make the joke: I think the Prologue/Epilogue character is probably going to end up dying. ",63,16,False,self,,,,,

The Roz scene was one of several exposition-and-boobs scenes, but both the Arya/Tywin and Roz/Littlefinger interactions were written for the show, so I found this connection a little bit interesting.

There was so much going on at the end of the book that I don't know if I got everything. So I'm going to name the things that affected my feels and let me know if I'm missing things.
1. Aegon is going to take Storm's End
2. Theon ends up with Asha by way of Tycho, apparently he just wanted to stop by Winterfell or something.
3. Victarion and Moqarro are going to summon dragons by killing people.
4. Quentyn makes good dragon bait
5. Barristan basically rules Mereen
6. Tyrion is helping run the Second Sons
7. Cersei is having a trial with Robert Strong as her champion.
8. Jon Snow :'( I'm hoping he returns via Mel or Ghost
9. Dany flies dragons into the middle of nowhere and finds Dothraki, who will probably make good Drogon food.
10. Varys is winning the game of thrones, with 9 year olds. He's also team Aegon.

I'm having a marathon of the show before the premier and I noticed something about Gendry.

When Cersei went to see Bran when he fell, she told Catlyn that she had a son with black hair and she lost him to a fever, except she said that the kid was taken from her and she never saw him again, therefore not actually seeing him die. I don't recall if this was mentioned in the book as its been a long while since I've read them.
Then later on when Ned goes to see Gendry and asks about his mom, he said that she had ""yellow hair"".

I didn't exactly keep a running tally the first time I watched, so when I did my recent season 2 re-watch, I kept track of the exact number of time she says her infamous line. And...

She only says the line a grand total of *one* time.

This is when she comes home to find her household slaughtered and her dragon cages empty. Kind of an appropriate time to ask where they are, don't you think? The only time she comes close to repeating it is in the next episode when she calmly says to Jorah, ""Find my dragons."" Not exactly the shrill, incessant ravings of a crazy person, is it?

This is like saying that The Emperor from Star Wars' catchphrase was ""UNLIMITED POWER"", just because it's a hammy, overacted line that people associate with his character from that time period, despite the fact that it's also a one-timer.

So how did Dany's single line become so engraved in the Internet hive mind as her catch-phrase?",82,81,False,self,,,,,
