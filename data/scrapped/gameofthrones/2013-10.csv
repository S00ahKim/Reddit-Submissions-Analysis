the first book i have is this one: (I got this from a bookstore)

http://www.amazon.com/Thrones-Martin-George-published-Bantam/dp/B00E32K4RK/ref=sr_1_52?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1380643500&amp;sr=1-52&amp;keywords=a+game+of+thrones

but, i found out that my brother had all the other books all along, published and all of the books i have are different from the ones available in the bookstores right now

the best example i can find is a feast for crows

My version:

http://www.amazon.com/Martin-George-R-R-s-Feast-Paperback/dp/B008EAWB7I/ref=sr_1_24?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1380643667&amp;sr=1-24&amp;keywords=a+feast+for+crows

Version I found in bookstore + friends have:

http://www.amazon.com/Feast-Crows-Song-Fire-Thrones/dp/055358202X/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1380643656&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=a+feast+for+crows

My biggest concern is this

my version has ~770 pages

while the one I found in book stores has 1104 pages ..

can some one tell me if I have made a huge mistake and that the missing ~300 pages contain relevant material?

I would hate to have to read all the new versions all over again ... i thought the books were the same. I am half way through the feast for crows right now but until I sort this out, I don't wanna go further. can someone please help me out?

Can it do no wrong?",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1nljvg/possible_spoilersbook_show_discussion_those_of/,ihadaface,1380737899,"This is coming from somebody who just finished Breaking Bad, and migrated over to having Game of Thrones as my new top show. However, the difference is that Breaking Bad was being written by the creator as things went along, where with Game of Thrones, it's pretty much like a movie based off a book. The story is already there, the creators just have to recreate it. 

With that being said, does this pretty much mean that Game of Thrones *will* be consistently good, until the very end, since there will be zero filler? Since the story is already there, and all that needs to be done is optimizing it for the screen. 

Another question I have is for those who've pretty much read every book up to now and is completely caught up with the story. Does this kind of spoil things for you, when it comes to the show, since you're so much further ahead? Or do you enjoy seeing how the show interprets the books? Is enough content omitted and replaced in the shows for it to feel new to you? Does this bother you? The fact that things from the show are either combined or totally new from the books, does that mean that even *you* can still be spoiled, to an extent?

I find Game of Thrones a pretty interesting thing. This series could have just as easily had a series of films based off of it, but instead has a totally uncensored TV series instead. Do you think this medium allows the creators to cover a lot more details from the book that a movie could never do? Does the show do a lot more justice to the books than movies ever could?

We all know that the producers are chomping at the bit to make a movie and cash in on GoT fever, but the issue is that the written story doesn't lend itself well to movies.

So instead, what are the opinions on movies covering GoT history? Personally, I think Robert's Rebellion would be perfect for the big screen. It's not quite the hornet's nest of political plots and intrigue, has a straightforward narrative and is rife with great storytelling.

That the show might work better starting in October rather than in April.

One of the biggest complaints I have with the show has nothing to do with the show, but that it begins right at the start of spring and lasts through the start of summer when the days are a bit longer and warmer.  When it's extremely more welcoming to be outside on a Sunday at 8pm.  I'm sure I'm not the only person who thinks this and I feel it would be better for the show if were the other way around.  If it would be better to air the show when days are getting shorter and nights cooler, to where people would be accustomed to being inside and in front of their TVs at 8 on a Sunday..   I wonder if such a move would have any positive (or possible negative) impact on ratings.

If HBO were to ever consider moving the series to a fall schedule, I could get behind the idea, but there would be a few downsides.  The first being an even longer delay between seasons the year they decide to (hypothetically) move. A 9-10 month gap between is long enough, I don't think many would be into a 15-16 month gap.  GoT isn't Doctor Who that it can start a new season whenever the hell they want and the fans will just abide. 

The second issue would be the competition.  Spring is somewhat of a niche schedule .. Quite a deal less popular shows, or new shows occupy the spring schedule and instead opt for the fall, as it's always been.  There is comparatively a lack of conflict of professional sports going on in the early spring as there is in the fall.. Airing in October would put the show in conflict with pretty much every televised sport at one point or another (American Football would be going strong, the Baseball season is wrapping up, and basketball as well as hockey would be gearing up).  So given those two conflicts would it be better for GoT to stay as a spring program?  When would you think the show would get better viewership? 

These are just some musings I had, I would like your opinion should you chose to offer one.... Till then have a great Sunday. ",14,4,False,self,,,,,

As of right now, I have no clue who to root for. I think it's safe to say that everyone hates Joffrey because he's a dickhead, but I don't really see him as a big threat. He's just an overly angry/cruel child with too much power. When Tywin and Tyrion were talking in the finale, it was made pretty obvious that Tywin is in the real position of power (as far as I know), since he knows the game much better. He can order Joffrey around, and he still obeys as much as he doesn't like to (probably elder authority).

I sorta want to root for Dany, but I haven't read the books at all. For awhile, she was being pretty conquer-y, using her dragons as leverage to get what she wants, and being pretty merciless. At the same time, she treats the people she gains very well, so there's that. I have no clue if she's the one to root for because of her dragons, or if Stannis is gonna come in and use Melisandre's voodoo to win. Stannis eluded to Dany winning by saying that last time Westeros was conquered, it was due to a small army and 3 dragons, which is the exact position Dany is in. I think Melisandre is a fraud though, cause you'd think her ""god"" would have told her about the dragons. I think she's some kind of witch, and is using totally unrelated magic in a clever way to make it seem like she had more power than she really does. I wouldn't be surprised, with all the lying so far. Literally everybody has some sort of ulterior motive. There aren't very many genuine parties. I guess maybe Bran's party is alright, but I don't know. That boy and the girl came out of nowhere, and know everything for some reason. I wanna trust them, but can't. In this show, everyone who's genuine is in the company of dickheads. Fact. There have been no exceptions at all yet or anything to make me think otherwise.

Anyway, I know for a fact that those who read the books are much further ahead and already have a better idea of who might win or lose/the general state of everything, or if gaining the iron throne is even the whole point of it all. I'm just having a really hard time pinpointing who to root for or who to like/not like, simply because of how schemey everything has been. It's like the characters start to open up, and I start to like them a little, and then they clamp shut really quick and start being dickheads again. This is the first show ever where the plot actively keeps you from fully liking anybody. Once you start to, you're reminded again why you shouldn't.

Multiple parties have wronged multiple others in multiple ways at this point. Every time someone does any good, I think back to that one time when they were dickheads too, which I guess is the whole point. And when they finally do that good deed, I always feel like it was for a reason, a dickhead reason. It's all politics. I haven't seen a more morally gray show in awhile (some people more so than others). 

But yeah, now that I'm caught up on the show, can anyone sort of help fill in the blanks of what I'm missing from the books, or future shit that may/may not go down? I don't mind being spoiled all that much, since as much as I'd like to read the books, I would have a hard time finding time to do so. Pair in the fact with how slowly the show is being made. By the time I'm caught up with the readers, the last 2 books will probably be long out. I just need some kind of... I don't know, supplementing or something. If you don't wanna drop any fat spoilers, you don't have to, but it won't matter to me if you do. I'll read the books eventually, but based on how complex the show's been, I know those books are beefy. I could probably read plot summaries online, but meh.

There's just A LOT I have to kind of take in at this point. There are so many angles, and apparently so many different things going on. I don't know if this makes the show disjointed or brilliant. You have the White Walkers at one end, the schemey underbelly of the Lanisters trying to stay on top, and then the big picture of Stannis and Dany wanting to conquer everything in their own ways (both of which are totally oblivious to each other, with Dany being totally oblivious to everything that's happened so far. She's literally in her own little world right now). 

But yeah. ._.

When people talk about the prospect of adapting the War of the Usurper for television everyone talks about who they'd want cast as Ned Stark, Robert Baratheon, Lyanna Stark, Rhaegar Targaryen and so on; the main cast.

I'm more interested in the supporting cast, particularly Aerys' Kingsguard and his various Hands following the resignation of Lord Tywin Lannister.

In an ideal world who would you want cast in the roles of:
Ser Gerold Hightower?
Ser Arthur Dayne?
Ser Barristan Selmy?
Ser Lewyn Martell?
Ser Oswell Whent?
Ser Jonothor Darry?
Ser Jaime Lannister?
Lord Owen Merryweather?
Lord Jon Connington?
Lord Qarlton Chelsted?
Lord Rossart?

Just to get the ball rolling, personally speaking I'd pick Ian McShane for Hightower, John Simm for Selmy, Michael Mando for Martell and Mark Strong or James Nesbitt for Whent. But what do you guys think?",42,9,False,self,,,,,

I however, did not mind the Red Wedding. Yes I was very surprised it happend but after the episode i was more glad than sad. Most likely because I find Robb and Catelyn very boring and uninteresting characthers compared to the remainder of the Stark Family.

A simple solution would be just to have Daenerys transfer her crush to another sellsword, after Daario has moved on offscreen between seasons. She is beginning to moon over a second young hottie with a different name. Daario's declarations of loyalty meant nothing, and he either died in battle or had a brief fling with her and split.  

Dany doesn't care, and is just happy to be dating. Jorah is the same frustrated obsessive. I don't think there is any great loyalty on part of fans to the character of Daario, or to this aspect of the Mereen storyline. It would make the change of actor less distracting.  

It wouldn't change the purpose of the sellsword character in relation to Dany or Jorah (a love interest and a romantic rival). His loyalty could still be in doubt. A precedent for this would be when Martin encouraged the producers to rename the Westerling character after changing her around so much, thus birthing Talisa.",12,0,False,self,,,,,

I finally revisited Season 1 and in Season 1's Episode 4, Gendry says his mother had yellow hair. This raised a flag for me.

I remembered Cersei and Catlyn having a talk about sons after Brandon's fall which I found to happen in Season 1 Episode 2. Cersei called her lost first born son a ""black haired beauty"" (!) and that he ""was a fighter too"". Though she said ""they took his body away"", she also said she never visited her son's burial site (""crypt""). It's a longshot but there's reasonable doubt!

In Season 3 Episode 7, Lady Millawhatever mentions to Gendry his strength and ""talent for fighting"" as she reveals to him that he's the son of Robert, which highly matches to Cersei's description.

I think Gendry is the first son of Cersei and Robert! I want to believe! xD",15,0,False,self,,,,,

And I thought since I was able to pick up a bottle of their second tie-in the ""Take the Black Stout"" (my beer pictured in the link below), that I would give my thoughts in this second GoT themed brew from Brewery Ommegang.


http://i.imgur.com/JyjVSUH.png


To start out with I will say that stouts and porters are among my favorite beer styles, and going into cooler fall and winter seasons I am more than happy that Ommegang chose this particular style for this second GoT beer.  However, therein lies my biggest problem with the beer, it's hardly comes off as a stout.  Not to say I'm not enjoying the brew, I do, but it is more of a Belgian black ale than a stout, or what is almost a hybrid of the two styles.  A stout is supposed to be somewhat thicker, less sessionable brew with a thicker (or creamier) mouthfeel; something which this beer does not have.  This beer drinks easier, and has a lighter mouth feel.  

But that's where my issues with this brew stop, just at a mis-classification.  I do really enjoy this beer however, and is a great step up from from the relatively safe Blonde Ale that was their first GoT outing.  

As pictured above, the beer pours a thick 3-finger khaki head over the very dark beer.  The licorice aroma is abundantly apparent on the outset and is the most prominent flavor that hits you upon first sip.  The Belgian yeast flavor follows up.  And while I said I wouldn't call this a stout there are some characteristics of the style present in the beer.  Along with the licorice, there are detonate notes of a nutty profile with hints of chocolate.  Other reviews on this beer have stated a hint of coffee as well, but I'm not getting much of that.  As the beer is (as discussed) much lighter and less filling than what's expected of a stout, the beer is very sessionable and had this beer been available in 12oz singles, I could see drinking 2 or 3 of these, but as it is I had no problem finishing the 750ml bomber. 

Overall, and despite my misgivings of not really being a stout IMO, I really liked this beer and could see myself picking up another, and perhaps trying to age a bottle for a while to see how that effects the brew.  If you are a drinker accustomed to darker beers this should be welcome, and I would recommend it to you.  Pick it up if you can find a bottle..

My final rating would be a 7.5 out of 10

Jaime is still Jaime and Brienne still Brienne, but new viewpoint characters have different monikers. Why are the characters in the Iron Islands and Dorne given other titles?

""The Kraken's Daughter"" instead of Asha, or ""The Soiled Knight"" instead of Arys. It makes me wonder why Jaime's chapters weren't always titled ""The Kingslayer.""

As if there aren't enough characters to keep track of, this just makes things confusing!

So what's the reasoning?",36,28,False,self,,,,,

Ill start off by saying Im a big fan of everything the show has done with the story including the Red Wedding.

That being said, I can't help but shake the feeling that they missed out on what could have been a very epic addition to the already most memorable moment in the series so far: The last stand of Greatjon Umber, at the RW. 

(In the books, Greatjon is there, and the following happens, summerized)

When those arrows start raining down, and Robb takes his first hit, just imagine the Greatjon crushing through Frey men from the other side of the room, (though clearly drunk), smashing skulls as he runs. Then imagine him grabbin and flipping a table infront of Robb just in time to save him from a couple kill shots that go thunk thunk thunk into the wood. 

Imagine the collective sigh of releif as the audience thinks that there is a chance, a small chance that Robb is making it out of here alive. 

But alas in a heroic attempt and fight, The Greatjon goes down to a swarm of soldiers. 

I know they didn't have him on for the entire season, but even for that one episode he could have had him show up with some explaination, saying somthing like ""hell I would never miss a wedding!"" The audience already knew who he was so they wouldnt have had to explain too much. 

I think it would have been an epic addition.

Ideas are welcome!,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1o9mjo/no_spoilers_planning_a_game_of_thrones_wedding/,valentinevar,1381545819,"So I am getting married in December (this December. Yes, its soon.) I'm having a wedding at my husband's parent's house and I'm on a budget. My husband and I are HUGE Game of Thrones fans (clearly) and decided to make this the theme for our wedding. I have a few ideas that I will implement already: 

1- Will walk down the aisle to an acoustic guitar version of Rains of Castamere.

2- Will label the tables after Houses of Westeros (Lannister, Baratheon... etc you get the point) when I run out of major houses I'll name them after minor houses and my favorites, like House Dayne and Essos locations (and will probably also have a table named Dothraki).

3- Will be serving spiced wine and Dornish inspired food (House Martell is my favorite house) that my husband is taking care of since he's a chef.

4- We are not doing ""medieval-like"" costumes or such but I'd like to have something inspired by Game of Thrones... and particularly Dornish culture so any ideas /styles are appreciated

5- Already sent out wedding invitations with the sun and spear in the background since, again, Martell ftw.

I'd like to see what other redditors have seen around the interwebs or any suggestions, ideas, links, anything is welcome. I would like to make an ""Iron Throne inspired love seat"" for me and my husband so ideas on how to make that would be awesome and well received.

I'm thinking of making custom wine bottle labels for each table with maybe a type of wine from ""their area"" and center pieces with the banners of each house &lt;- which, btw, if have seen any small banners that have all the sigils (I usually can find the common sigils but my favorite, Martell, tends to be missing more often than not... and with good reason they haven't appeared on the show yet so I understand)

Cake... I have a few ideas. I've seen a lot of Iron Throne cakes that I don't particularly like. So far my favorite has been this one http://prntscr.com/1wql9s and this one http://prntscr.com/1wqldh but any other ideas are welcome! 

On a side note: Things that will **not** occur at my wedding

1- It won't have Dothraki standards, I am not killing anyone/anything.

2- Just like 1 says, I am not having a red wedding.

3- Well maybe I can... no no, never mind, not killing anyone.",10,0,False,self,,,,,

**A Dragon from Valyria**

When you gooooo will you send home   
A raven from Valyria?  
Take a look up the straight road  
From Volantis to Astapor  

(Well)  
Broke off from my work, the other day  
I spent the evening thinking about  
Targarean blood that flowed away  
Across the ocean to the second chance  
I wonder how it got on when it reached the Summer Lands...  

When you go will send home   
A raven from Valyria?  
Take a look up the straight road  
From Volantis to Astapor  

I've looked at the ocean  
Tried hard to imagine  
The way you felt the day you sailed  
From Westeros to Braavos exile  
We should have held you  
We should have told you  
But you know our sense of timing  
We always wait too long  

When you go will you send home  
A raven from Valyria?  
Take a look up the straight road  
From Volantis to Astapor

Targarean blood  
Will you ever return  
To help us kick the life back  
To a dying mutual friend  
Do we not love her  
I think we all claim to love her  
Do we have to roam the world  
To prove how much it hurts?  

When you go will you send home  
A Dragon from Valyria?  
Take a look up the straight road  
From Volantis to Astapor.

Some of the name changes are surprisingly easy, e.g., ""Wester Ross"" -&gt; ""Westeros""(!), but some are more tricky and involved some scouring of the ASOFAI maps... any better suggestions welcome!

And I have to say - I didn't *love* first two books as much as I loved the show. It may be because I had already known the story, or because the food/nature/clothing descriptions are boring. I can't give a clear answer, but...

Just recently I finished reading Tyrion's chapter IV from ASOS. Before that, I was a die hard fan of Ned and Stannis, but this chapter made me feel a wind of change. First of all, it was *the* chapter that made me fall in love with ASOS. The chapter is pure gold - smooth, funny dialogues, that beside being funny also gave a lot of info about the characters' past. Secondly, I think I have a new favorite character - Oberyn Martell. 

I mean, how can you not love someone who had maimed a Tyrell and then brings a bastard paramour to a Lannister/Tyrell wedding? How can you not love a man who pulled off a few exceptionally good jokes on Tyrion? Also, I feel like his line *A taste we share. Lord Gargalen once told me he hoped to die with a sword in his hand, to which I replied that I would sooner go with a breast in mine.* is going to rival Tyrion's one about praying with a cock for the #1 quote spot in the series so far.

To end my post I'd like to say that.. Well, damn, I imagine how this chapter will look on TV and my hopes are high for one of the best scenes I will have seen by then. Also, I hope they're going to introduce more characters as badass as Oberyn, because.. well.. The most badass characters didn't stay alive for too long so far.",16,0,False,self,,,,,

Stag King 

Frey

Wolftrap

Stark Raving

Also, I've created a drink called the ""White Walker."" It's on the sweet side, so I'm up for suggestions for sprucing it up. It's:
1 Part Baliey's Irish Creme

2 Parts Milk

1 Part Hiram Walker Creme de Cacao

serve chilled or over ice

Ned confronts Queen Cersei over the truth of Jon Arryn's death as Robert, mortally wounded during his hunting, prepares to name his successor. Jon Snow takes the vows of the Night's Watch. Khal Drogo summons his army to invade Westeros after Robert conspires to poison Daenerys. Robert appoints Ned as Regent of the Iron Throne, who will rule until his heir is of age. Ned brings the King's declaration before Cersei, Joffrey (eldest of the King's children), and the Small Council. Ned asks Baelish to secure the cooperation of the City Watch in removing the Lannisters from the throne  Joffrey is not Robert's son but Jaime's, he reveals, making Stannis Baratheon (Robert's older brother) the true heir. However, the loyalty of Baelish and the City Watch lies with the Lannisters: Ned is swiftly captured, and his men killed.|

It would be pretty cool to do a mega game I think. The game can apparently handle up to 64 players, (although I can imagine it would be difficult) and maybe we could reserve certain titles to play. 

Edit: Looks like we have enough people to get a decent sized game going at some point. We'll have to work out times and what not later. I favour a one off event all day kinda deal, but I'm open to whatever.

**Reserved titles so far:**

SouthernSkeptic - House Tarly of Hornhill

Thimbleyjoe - House Tyrell of Highgarden or Redwine of the Arbor

Whitehatguy - House Bolton of the Dreadfort

Youdidntreddit - House Royce of Runestone

Eonge - House Hightower of Oldtown

Lebeast - House Greyjoy of Pyke

unhhoh12 - House Manderley of White Harbour

Speaking_intounges - House Dayne of Starfall

Morfree - House Lannister of Castlely Rock

w4tch3r0nth3w411s - House Reyne of Castamere

mma2358 - House Tully of Riverrun

timeywimey207 - House Stark of Winterfell

The_Flying_Noodle - House Frey of the Crossing

t_elliot - House Arryn of the Eyrie 

and I would like Harrenhall.

**Good titles still up for grabs;**

House Karrstark of the Karrhold

House Martell of Sunspear

House Tarth of the Staights of Tarth

House Darklyn of Duskendale

House Rosby of Rosby

House Baratheon of Shipbreaker Bay.

Edit 2. This is good we should have enough for a very good sized game, we need dates etc now. I'm still happy to host, but upon speed checking, my shitty backwater internet may be kinda slow-paced, but I might still be able to do it.",67,35,False,self,,,,,

A legendary warrior, a loyal friend, and a man of his word.

With hobbies like drinking and whoring, he was known as a bit of a bafoon. He still sat the Iron Throne.  Destroyed an entire empire for a woman.

My question is, as Aegon was a Conquerer, Aerys Cruel, Brandon a Builder, so on so forth:

My guesses would be The Hammer that Smashed, or Robert the Usurper.  What do you think?",60,12,False,self,,,,,

My mind immediately connected the Golden Company and our dearly departed beggar king.

As you should know the Golden Company traditionally coats the skull of their deceased commander-captains in molten gold, and Viserys' skull received a similar treatment.

Is this just a case of recurring imagery? or is there something else here other than the fact that both the GC commanders and VT were trying to win back the iron throne and failed?

Additionally:
- Our dearest Joffrey wears a golden crown as well and *koff koff*'s his way out of this world. 
- Renly wears a nice stag-inspired golden crown and gets shadow assassin-ed. 
- The Young Wolf wears a cheaper headpiece (bronze and iron), and gets bolt(on)ed. 
- Balon dons the crown of salt and rock and gets FM'd on the rocks below Pyke. 

Is there something about the headgear, or is mine just not on right? Do the books ever mention Daenerys, Aegon I, or Euron explicitly ""donning"" their crowns?

p.s. - Daenerys has one (in addition to her floppy ears) that she got in Qarth but I can't recall her explicitly ""donning"" it. Stannis' crown is mentioned but I don't recall him wearing it all that often either.

Specifically: Daenerys.",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1okh50/s2_acok_rant_about_sex_in_game_of_thrones/,[deleted],1381926476,"Disclaimer: I love Game of Thrones. But I love A Song of Ice and Fire infinitely more, and I'm only about 2/3 through A Clash of Kings.

The more I read A Song of Ice and Fire, the more I realise how many unnecessary sex scenes were put into Game of Thrones. I just don't understand it. Did the producers not think that the story would be enticing enough as it is?

I mean sure in the books there's a fair amount of it, but I don't think it's ever there where it is not relevant to the story. And the way the show does it just gets on my nerves.

One thing that really annoys me is when Dany marries Khal Drogo in the show, he's shown to be raping her on their wedding night. She doesn't want it, he goes ahead anyway, does nothing to make her happy. This is NOT the case in the book! She's terrified, he realises it, he wipes away her tears and makes it an enjoyable experience for her. I'm not annoyed that they showed that he raped her - either way, she didn't really want it, she was too young and they hadn't even had a conversation before this point. But it's just unnecessary to show him fucking her from behind with a frown on his face while she's crying. This is not how it played out in the books, when I read this scene I actually found it pretty heartwarming.

And again with Dany. In the books she wears a traditional Qartheen robe, bearing one breast. She comments on how Ser Jorah can't keep his eyes off, whereas Xaro Xohan Daxos doesn't even notice. Fair enough, nothing inappropriate there, I'd say. Just a boob. But??? The people on the show decided it would take away from the integrity and power of her scenes????? like? one. fucking. boob. why are they so oversexualised it annoys me so much. In the books, she even uses them to breastfeed her dragons? How is that sexy?! If anything I think sticking to the canon would have added to the sense of female empowerment because Dany IS a female and she IS a badass and she's more than ok with sex by this point. On entering Qarth she sees one of their walls covered with images of sex. She blushes and then realises how stupid it is to blush over images of men and women giving pleasure to each other, while nobody even flinches at the wall covered with depictions of battle. (A view GRRM holds himself)

I fucking love Dany. And even though the show portrays her as a fucking badass and I loved her before I even touched the books, they could have done a lot better.

I could probably go on about this for pages and pages but I have stuff to do. Please call me out if I got any facts wrong, give your opinions, I'd love to have a discussion on this topic.",27,0,False,default,,,,,

Adding Context for non readers,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1oll29/spoilers_asos_15_little_known_facts_on_the_world/,GRVrush2112,1381958228,"Hello there, it's been a while since I've posted one of these.  At the end of last season I promised some bonus episodes, so here you go.  For this episode instead of going in-depth into one topic, I wanted to post several (In this case 30 to be split into two parts) short facts/backstory notes/changes from books that the non-reader might not know and give a short writeup on each fact.  I hope you all enjoy.


**Note On Spoiler Scope**

Tagged this as for ASOS spoilers, but I have limited these to not extend beyond where the show is now.  However this is several backstory notes that may or may not come up on the show, and several of which have been partially covered on the Season 1 and 2 Blu-Ray extras.  Other than that enjoy.

-  **Robert Baratheon is the Great-Grandson of Aegon V (Egg from Dunk and Egg)**

The daughter and youngest child of King Aegon V, aka Egg, from the Tales of Dunk and Egg series of novellas, was married to an Unknown Baratheon, their child was Steffon Baratheon the father of Robert (as well as Stannis and Renly).  It was this Targaryen lineage that Robert established his claim to the Iron Throne after his rebellion.

-  **The Bolton treachery was a long time coming**

While many viewers were surprised by Roose Bolton's turn on King Robb at the Red Wedding.  But in fact as with most Major Houses they all have their long standing rivals; House Tully has the Freys, House Lannister had the Reynes, and House Stark had the Boltons.  Over thousands of years the Boltons had risen several times against the Starks prior to Aegon's landing, the fact that Roose was finally able to capitalize on a millennia of feuding was a more compelling reason to turn on Robb rather Robb simply rejecting Roose's advice.

-  **Thoros of Myr won the melee during the Hand's Tourney**

While the show displayed the jousting of the Tourney to celebrate Ned Stark taking the position of Robert's Hand of the King, the books also elaborate on the melee portion of the tourney, which was won by Thoros of Myr.  Another future member of the Brotherhood without Banners won the archery competition at the same tourney, that being Anguy.

-  **The Free Cities and Valaryia**

During the longstanding reign of the Valyrian Freehold, the civilization is responsible for all of the Free Cities: Pentos, Tyrosh, Lys, Myr, Qohor, Volantis, Lorath, and Norvos.  All of which were outposts of their freehold, except for Braavos, which was a city founded by escaped Valyrian slaves and kept secret from the Valyrians for centuries. 

-  **Lannister family sword woes**

One of the biggest irritants to Twyin Lannister is that out of the many great houses, that his lacks an ancestral Valyrian steel family sword.  The Lannister greatsword ""Brightroar"" was lost sometime between the Doom of Valyria and Aegon's conquest when King Tommen of the Rock sailed to Valyria with Brightroar to never return.  Centuries later Twyin's youngest brother Gerion sailed to the ruins in an attempt to recover the sword, he also has never been heard from again.  Tywin has attempted to purchase the Valyrian steel swords from other houses to no avail.

-  **The Fat Tom**

As part of Arya's dancing lessons she chases a particular mean and elusive black cat with a torn ear. The description of the cat matches that of a kitten named Balerion that once belonged to Princess Rhaenys Targaryen prior to the sack on Kings Landing. 

-  **Gift/New Gift**

You might not know, contrary to their oath, that the men of the Night's watch actually hold lands, that belong to the watch itself (not any one member).  Brandon the builder gave the land 25 leagues south of the wall to the Watch to do with as they please (Farm and Tend the land), much later Queen Alysanne Targaryen gave the Watch a further 25 leagues.  These allotments are known as the Brandon's Gift and the New Gift.  There are holdfasts and small communities within this allotment, to which taxes are collected by the watch, and not Winterfell. 

-  **Arstan Whitebeard**

In the books Barristain Selmy did not immediately identify himself when he joined Danerys.  He spent a good time, up until after the taking of Yunkai (where we are in the show at the end of season 3) incognito as a man known as Arstan Whitebeard to determine whether Dany was mad or not before finally revealing himself.

-  **Seven Wonders**

There was a famous traveller in Westerosi and Essosi history named Lomas Lonstrider, among his travels he compiles a book known as ""Wonders Made By Man"", in which he details some of the greatest structures made by man, nine to be specific.  While all have not been detailed in the books, readers know of 4 of these Wonders, those being:  The Wall, Roads of Valyria, Titan of Braavos (similar to the Colossus of Rhodes), and the Triple walls of Qarth.

-  **Rhaegar and the Tourney at Harrenhall**

While many significant things came from this historic and game changing tourneys, from many fan theories, to the departure of a King's hand.. Not many people are aware of why the tourney was held in the first place.  It is highly suggested that the Tourney was held as a pretext by Rhaegar to meet with the high lords to possibly remove the increasingly mad King Aerys from power.  Varys told the king of this rumor and personally attended the Tourney to make sure that it wouldn't be the case.  How different history could have changed if Rhaegar was allowed to be with those lords...

-  **The Faith of the Seven used to be Militarized**

When Aegon conquered Westeros the Faith of the Seven quietly abided his invasion and subsequent reign, however after Aegon I's death that was not the case.  The Faith of the seven were armed and militarized at the time and resisted the rule of Aegon's son Aenys I, resisting because of his incestious birth.  The conflict was violent on both sides and persisted through the reigns of King Aenys and King Maegor.  It was not until the reign of King Jaehaerys I that a diplomatic truce was reached.  The Faith was de-militarized as long as the crown always ""Protected the Faith"".. this became to be known as ""Maegor's law"".  The Armed branches of the faith were the ""Warrior's sons"" (Knights who renounced lands and family loyalty) and the ""Poor Fellows"" (Lightly armed traveling commoners) .

- **Two Shadow Demons**

In season 2 we saw some of the power of the Red God and Melisandre when she gave ""birth"" to a shadow that subsequently murdered King Renly.  However in truth there were two that appeared in A Clash of Kings, the one that killed Renly, and a second one that killed the caretaker of Storm's End; Ser Cortnay Penrose, when he did not allow Stannis into the castle when he came knocking. It was this second demon that Davos Seaworth witnessed being ""born""

- **Jaehaerys II does not exist in the show**

The father of the Mad King does not exist in the show, that being King Jaehaerys II.  Jaehaerys II is the second son of Aegon V (aka Egg from the Tales of Dunk and Egg).  However in the show when Maester Aemon reveals his lineage to Jon, he correctly identifies Aegon/Egg as his Brother, King Maekar as his father, but he names Aerys as Egg's son, not his grandson...effectively omitting King Jaehaerys II from show canon.  

-  **Hints of Aerys Wildfire Plot prior to Jaime in Harrenhall**

Before it was all laid out by Jaime at the baths in Harrenhall on how he saved a city from burning there were a few hints before hand which support Jaime's story in the previous book ""A Clash of Kings"".  The first of which was when Tyrion was prepping for battle in Kings landing and organizing the Wildfire, he is told by the Pyromancers that over the past several years that several cashes have been discovered that they have no idea for their reason being there.. From Flee Bottom and to the Sept of Baelor stocks of the substance have been discovered with possibly of much more undiscovered.  The second hint we get is a vision Dany has in the House of the Undying.  In this particular vision Dany witness an old man with long silver hair in a hall of dragon skulls tell an unknown person ""Let him be king over charred bones and cooked meat, let him be king of ashes"".   Presumably being King Aerys referring to Robert and him torching Kings Landing.

-  **Something's amiss at this wedding**

While on the show the Red Wedding has came and went, there were several queues throughout the chapter in the book that things were amiss.  The chapter is from Catlyn's POV and she notices several occurrences that hint things are amiss, only to put it all together too late.  Walder Frey is at first reluctant to offer Bread and Salt (thus refusing Guest Right) to the wedding party.  A few Freys are missing (Robb's squire Olyvar, Perwin, and Alasender Frey) all were judged to be too sympathetic to Robb's cause.  Edmure's bride Roslin is weeping throughout the proceedings, Catlyn mistakes this as her being apprehensive about the bedding ceremony, not about the impending massacre.  The Freys are very friendly and intent on getting the northern host Drunk, (particularly The Greatjon) while not imbibing themselves.  Upon arrival Grey Wind is uncontrollable and snaps at many of the Freys, and not allowed entrance to the Twins.  Dacey Mormont approaches Edwyn Frey for a dance who violently jerks away when she grabs his arm.  One of the biggest giveaways was, unlike how it was in the show, the band sucks, constantly off key and out of tune, not knowing they are soldiers in disguise.  Lastly it is when the band begins the Rains of Castamere that Catlyn puts it all together, he approaches Edwyn Frey and notices the ring mail beneath his clothes (not Roose Bolton).  The slaughter then begins.  ...

Neither was she trained in any of the arts of war nor has any political street smarts.
Aegon on the other hand according to his references seems to be what Danny isn't .He seems to be a Conqueror .Dany seems to be the girl with the dragons.

Don't get me wrong , I love Dany's chapters and her character but i feel that she has made ALOT of mistakes .

And don't get me started on what mistakes she made during her stint at Slaver's Bay.
Banishing her most loyal companion.Marrying the most obvious leader of the Son's of the Harpy and Getting the flux into Merren ,etc.

In my Opinion Aegon seems a better candidate for the Iron Throne .(If a Targaryen has to take the throne.)

Melisandre needs kings blood and her fire magic to revive dragons from stone.

Daenarys burnt Drogo on the fire pyre alongside her dragon eggs (stonified) and Mira Maz Duur with her magic.

Is Melisandre basically talking about the same technique that Daenarys used (accidentally?)

What if any is different. It seems like Melisandre doesn`t really know what stones are made into dragons etc.

I have only gotten through the first 3 books and watched all of the TV series.  My question is why do people like Stannis so much?  In the TV series so far he seems very foolish.  I get that some people think that his claim to the throne is better than Joffrey's.  That is kind of debatable since his claim to the throne is only because some lords bent a knee to his brother.  But, as soon as lords bent a knee to Joffrey, he had an equally valid claim to the throne.  But, so far as I can tell, he seems like a really horrible person given the way he treats people who don't worship the evil deity he is trying to push on everyone.    ",92,29,False,self,,,,,

1209,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2013-10-20,2013,10,20,10,1ot5p6,self.gameofthrones,"[ASOS] Yet another ""I finished book 3"" thread",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1ot5p6/asos_yet_another_i_finished_book_3_thread/,WasabiG,1382230824,"So I decided earlier this year that I would read to the end of book three, even thought it would spoil the next season of the show. Starting out as a show watcher, I was reluctant to read past season 3, but I figured I'd try it out and compare the two experiences. I finally finished just this week.

All I gotta say is, Christ Martin killed off a ton of characters. In the second half alone, I counted Ygritte, Jeoffry, Oberyn, Shae, Tywin, Lysa, and the Hound (?). Not looking so bright for House Lannister as of now. For that matter, it's not looking real bright for anyone, not even Daenerys, whose crusade to end the plight of the slaves of Essos simply worsened their condition and turned her into a butcher. Surprisingly, Stannis is actually in the best place as of now in my opinion- he holds the north, defeated Mance, and has earned if not the loyalty, at least the respect of the Night's Watch. I'm interested to see what will happen to him next. 

I must admit, I was a bit disappointed with Tyrion's plotline during the second half- I really expected to see Sansa and his relationship warming up, preparing him to become Lord of the North at some point. Alas, she abandoned him, and he spent half the book languishing as a prisoner. The only thing that can be said is that his exile in the free cities will set him up nicely to meet Dany, and I can't wait for those two to work together, and fulfill part of the three headed dragon theory I've been hearing so much about. 

I still have trouble understanding why Littlefinger decided to kill Jeoffry; though it is clear at this point he has no loyalties but to himself, the explanation he gave to Sansa is wanting and I hope it's expanded on later. Damn the way he killed Lysa was ridiculously cold hearted.

That brings me to another point- the deaths in the second half of ASOS lack the intensity and thrill of the fist (especially the Red Wedding), but are instead characterized by a pure gravitas and sadness that just tear my heart out. It is masterfully done. While I stared at my screen in horror as I watched the Red Wedding unfold, I just felt a pit open up in my stomach as I read Arya abandoning the Hound, Baelish pushing Lysa out of the moon door, and Tyrion killing Shae and his father after denouncing his brother. There was no surprise in any of these deaths; I saw them coming pages beforehand, but if anything this simply built up the sadness which seemed inevitable in the end. This was some pretty heavy reading. Martin, forget the Red Wedding being hard to write, I would have struggled much more to transcribe the aforementioned deaths. 

So overall, the book leaves me doubtful as to what the show is going to do now. I can't imagine spending an entire season watching Dany try to learn how to govern a city, but on the other hand I can't imagine that fans will be pleased to see a season without her. Bran's story basically ended at the end of the book in exactly the same place that the show did, so I assume that season four will delve into some AFFC material. The show also seemed to imply that Sansa was warming to Tyrion, so I don't know what will happen to that, not to mention Shae. Where the hell is the show going to take her character, which so different from the one in the books? 

So yea. That is my reaction to ASOS, a masterful book by a great storyteller. If you want to discuss, please don't mention anything beyond book 3.

I'm re-watching this episode with my boyfriend who has never seen the series. And, he asked me how Stannis lost the battle at the end. (Was pretty chaotic) and I would like to be able to explain it to him properly. 

It was my understanding from before that Stannis had won the battle. Perhaps I had just read it wrong. But, what happened to him? They were winning the fight hands down (men on the walls, in the city, charging Tyrion lannister ""oh fuck me""). But after re-watching, I always wondered, how did Tywin Lannister march in at the end and say ""we've won!""? What happened to Stannis Baratheon? Did he retreat? Just confused me.....and my boyfriend.

Jon and the Night's Watch confront an ancient evil from beyond the Wall, while across the Narrow Sea, Drogo's army marches west towards the Seven Kingdoms.|

It's a recurring theme, just like the competition between Houses for control of land in Westeros.  Martin has not explicitly explored the related themes, so it might help to put the economic impact of slavery in the context of an analogue:  the American South.

**Capitalization of Land**:  In the antebellum South, land was undercapitalized.  It wasn't valueless, but it was simply worth less than the cost of labor.  This is counter-intuitive at first, considering that slavery is (in theory) free labor.  The fact is that slavery was actually very expensive, and slaves themselves were valuable.  (Plantation owners were often cruel to slaves, but they rarely killed them or took it lightly when a slave tried to escape.)  Land was downright cheap by comparison.  In simple terms of supply and demand, westward expansion reduced the value of land, whereas the [prohibition on slave importation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_Prohibiting_Importation_of_Slaves) raised the value of slaves.  Economists refer to this as the capitalization of labor.  (Note that the act was not entirely effective at stopping the transatlantic slave trade, but it had tremendous impact on the supply curve.)

**Capitalization of Labor**:  Compare this economy to the post-war South, in which the value of labor plummeted relative to the value of land.  Newly freed slaves could be paid next-to-nothing while their former owners no longer had to pay for their food and lodging.  The freedmen's desperation for work put downward pressure on wages.  Without a minimum wage or unionized labor to ease the pressure, workers found themselves undercutting one another to compete for the same jobs they had previously done in bondage.  Meanwhile, plantation owners turned a profit by investing the labor savings in the formerly valueless land.  This, in turn, boosted the value of land.  Almost overnight, the capital of the Southern economy went from labor to land.

**Inverse Value of Labor and Land in ASOIAF**:  The economies of Westeros and Essos are analogous to the post-war and antebellum South, respectively.  Aside from the Braavosi and the Breaker of Shackles, slavery is a cornerstone of commerce in Essos.  (And while I'm running short on quotes, I recall the disdain Mopatis and others have for the Westerosi obsession with land and territorial control.)  The Westerosi feel differently and generally despise the slave trade, while the major and minor houses all battle for control over land.  The themes may not be as historically linked in Martin's universe as they are in American history, but it's worth considering the intersection of land and labor, and how these economic factors influence the politics in ASOIAF.",9,19,False,self,,,,,

How much of the dialogue from the TV series is directly lifted from the books? Does George R. R. Martin write dialogue as witty and intricate as some of Tyrion's quips and things in the TV show? Or is that what the TV writers do, make the story better for TV by writing snappy dialogue? Or is the work of the writer for each episode basically just adapting scene after scene in the book onto TV format paper?

Or any other kind of pairing/character who we want to live happily ever after. 

Now, the help I want is suggestions of who to cast for the following characters, this is for my NaNo. The scenario is: what if Lyanna Stark and the Dayne siblings (Arthur and Ashara) survived.

Thus for Lyanna it would be 35-40 year old woman with dark hair and pale eyes. Preferably been cast in a medieval/fantasy drama so she is in the right kind of clothes. (Also preferably not too well known.) (Younger than Lena Headey)

Ashara is a 40+ year old woman, with brown hair and light eyes. (Older than Lena Headey)

Arthur is 40+ year old man with pale hair and light eyes (Same age as Sean Bean/Mark Addy)

My issue is that whenever I go searching for such people I will always get the usual teenagers-young adult fancast. I would rather have a more present day game of thrones cast for these characters that I am trying to resurrect in my head. 

I know this sounds silly, but I would appreciate any help that could be given :)",1,0,False,self,,,,,

I've been given Petyr ""Littlefinger"" Baelish, and I was wondering if someone could help me out with what to do about the costume. I've seen the Mockingbird pin on ThinkGeek, so I'll definitely grab that, but I'm not sure what to do about the rest of the outfit. My sewing skills are quite limited and I don't have a sewing machine, so premade stuff would be convenient. That said, I don't want to be spending lots of money on this, but it doesn't have to be perfect, it just has to look the part.

* Have you ever heard people referring to characters not by their names but solely by their principal physical and personality characteristics? 
* Have you ever wished that your watcher friends would pay more attention to the intricacies of the political and heraldric relationships?

If you answered ""YES!"" to any of these questions, I need YOUR help!

After finishing all of the books and getting a few friends hooked on the show, I've found that those that only watch the show are (in general) severely lacking in knowledge on the world and history of Westeros, Essos and Sothoryos.

To start off, I want to create a quiz to gague people's knowledge of the series as it pertains to the show to get a feel as to where most people are coming from, then create videos on different topics such as the basic geography of the world; the primary houses (Starks, Lannisters, Baratheons, Martells, Tullys, Arryns, Targeryens, Tyrells and Greyjoys), their importance and relationships of fealty towards lesser houses (e.g. Tarly, Umber, Payne, Dayne, Clegane, Mormont, etc.); Music and cultural ceremonies (e.g. The Bear and the Maiden Fair, weddings, guest rite, etc.); Religions (e.g. The Old Gods, The Faith of the Seven, R'hollor, The Drowned God, etc.); History (The Blackfyre Rebellion, The War of the Ninepenny Kings, The Doom of Valyria, The War of Conquest, The Greyjoy Rebellion, etc.) and finally, notable figures as related to said history.

All of the content is relatively easy, the hardest part (for me personally) is the quiz section. In finishing the books, I'm relatively steeped in the whole culture of the world to the point that I'm not sure anymore as to where your average show watcher is coming from. These questions would ideally be multiple choice and ranging to very easy (e.g. What's the name of Ned's best friend and king?) to medium (e.g. Who said he killed a boy by kicking him in the balls? or What's the name of the Royal Headsman?) to hard (e.g. What's Tywin's brother's name? or Who got mistaken for Gendry because he stole the bull's head helmet?). 

Once I have the questions, I'm going to start on production of the video-quiz and subsequent videos to be put up on youtube. As soon as the first round is out, I will be post them here on this subreddit. If you post a question that I end up using, don't worry, I will put your username up in the credits of the video.

TL;DR I'm making a series of videos for show watchers to give them the exposition the show can't, but I need help making a quiz to test average knowledge. Help me with questions and get your name inthe credits.",0,0,False,self,,,,,

One of them is ADWD, and since I've been dying to read it (the paperback came out this week and I don't have any money to get it), he lent me it.

The problem is that I think I only have Part 1 (apparently, ADWD is divided in two parts in the UK, according to Amazon at least), because I'm really close to finish it (98% according to Kindle) and... well, nothing happened, to be honest.

So, can you tell me if I only have part 1 or if this is the real deal?

- Asha left the North.
- Davos is with that lord who has Wex, the mute kid, and will give all lands to Stannis if he finds Rickon
- Jon had a big conversation with Melissandre, where she kinda told him that the raiders that he sent outside the wall, will be dead in a couple of days
- Mance rayder is dead, burned by the red witch
- Tyrion is with Ser Jorah Mormont, they are trying to reach Daenerys.
- Daenerys is in Meereen and her dragon hasn't come back.

In AFFC, everyone's friend Littlefinger tells Sansa Stark:

""...it is a good thing I thrive on chaos. What little peace and order the five kings left us will not long survive the three queens, I fear.""

At this point in the series, Baelish only knows two queens: Cersei and Margaery. Daenerys, Myrcella, or even Asha being queen is not a possibility. So who is the third queen Littlefinger talks about? Later in the chapter, we discover he plans to marry Sansa Stark to Harry the heir and expose her true identity, thus uniting the Vale and the north.

Now let's take a step back and look at the realm a little bit. The strongest alliance is probably the Tyrell-Lannister one, but even that is uneasy. Everyone has suffered and is only losing more, except for the Vale. The Vale still has full levies, fresh troops that could beat the exhausted West, North, or South. When Sansa and Harry get married, they will have the opportunity to command parts of the north and the entire Vale, probably with some Riverlands lords. The host they could raise would be a force to be reckoned with.

And what would they use this host for? To name Sansa Stark the new queen of the north, that's what. With a giant army they can beat the Lannisters and finish the war Robb Stark started.

That, I think, is Littlefinger's plan. To create a new Kingdom of the North, and make Sansa Stark the third Queen.

She's a different character to the one in the books. It's clear, at least in my opinion it is, that she does care about Tyrion.

So, this is what I think will happen:

She will be the Tysha of the books. She will be sent across the narrow sea, and Tyrion will be looking for her. He will ask Tywin where she is, and he'll say ""Where whores go.""

Reasons why:
I don't see her betraying him or Sansa, even if she is threatened and definitely not if she's bribed by Cersie.
I don't see Tyrion killing her.

And he was going to be nice and te;l Cersie first so she could leave Kings Landing so Robert wont kill her.

One thing stuck out, and GRRM made sure to point it out, twice. 

The narrator tells us Ned called Cersie to meet him in the kingswood, next to the weirwood. 

After that Cersei flat out ask ned, Why would you want to meet here.. Ned responds, So we can speak, in front of the gods. 

If you remember Cersei does not deny it, and she flat out tells Ned she loves Jaime and Ned needs to watch his back and he needs to pretty much keep his mouth shut. Im wondering if this will have any play with Bran being able to see through the weirwoods in time. Because throughout the entire story, he doesnt remember what happened before his fall, but it even says, Every time he thinks of Lannisters he gets a throbbing head ache, and butterflies in his stomach. 

GRRM said it would end the way it began. I honestly dont see the Lannisters being the last Lords of the south left, now that Tywin is dead. But if they were, Bran could now tell Sansa (Warden of the east) &amp; Rickon (Warden of the North). The truth about the Lannisters with 100% certainty.  And if he told Robb, he could tell Stannis as well. He would literally be able to get everyone to hate the Lannisters!

As the Stark and Lannister armies prepare for their first battle against one another, Tyrion leads his barbarian allies into battle while Robb and Catelyn bargain for a renegade Lord's help. With Drogo dying from his infected wound, Daenerys goes to desperate measures to save her husband's life by using a witch's blood magic, much to the horror of the Dothraki. At the Wall, a Targaryen reveals himself  and the price of loyalty  to Jon, who worries about events outside of the Wall. In a final bid to save his daughters' lives, Ned falsely confesses to conspiracy and swears fealty to Joffrey as the rightful heir to the Iron Throne. To the horror of Ned's daughters  and delight of the assembled crowd  Joffrey has him executed regardless.|

Generally his actions do show that he holds little loyalty to any particular house and acts in a way he sees best to hold stability and peace in the realm. Because of this I find it strange that he would have told Aerys about Rhaegars ulterior motives in the tournament at Harrenhal and thus ruin his chances of consulting with other lords about deposing Aerys. It seems to me it was obvious that Rhaegar taking power was what was best for the realm and that Varys would be more likely to let the possible coup take place. ,20,2,False,self,,,,,

**I am new.** 

**Will George R. R. Martin die before he finishes the books?**

**Will the show catch-up to the books before they're finished?**

I am new to the series and have been enjoying watching episodes at a marathon pace to catch-up. Being new (and i assume most people would know this anyway) I looked at some background and came to learn that the show is based on a series of books, of which 7 are planned and 5 have now been completed.

I was somewhat surprised to find that the writer of the series, George R. R. Martin, is a rather well established and rotund figure.

Given the time between releases seems to slowly increase (the last being 5 or 6 years) what are the chances he might not be able to release all the books?

[Already at 65 years of age he isn't a picture of health for that age group.](http://i.imgur.com/KpujLTS.jpg)

Another point of speculation - should the TV series catch-up with the books ( i assume 1 book is 1 season)

Could this be a problem? Since some of the adolescent characters already seem to age rather quickly. Should they stay alive, a significant gap between the series may mean they need to cast someone else.
