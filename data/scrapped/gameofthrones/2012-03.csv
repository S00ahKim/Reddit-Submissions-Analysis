Be warned.**

During a re-watch of the series I noticed just how different the conversation in the dungeons between the two conspirators is then how it was in the book. The main difference being the ending. [Spoiler Book and Show](/b ""In the Book the conversation ends with Varys asking Illyrio for more gold and more birds - the part about 'Delay you say, Hasten I reply' is still in the show, but in the show the conversation ends with Varys saying 'This is no longer a game for two players' and Illyrio responding with 'It never was'"")  Now please, correct me if I am mistaken - a friend has my copy of book one so I cannot verify - but I don't recall that part being mentioned in the book. My [Speculation](/g ""Is that this is further hint/tease for Ned being alive. In the books Arya never actually witnesses it, Cersi and Sansa are stated as actually being farther away and at an awkward angle and it's even mentioned how only the profile matches Ned Stark's, that the face is different. Also I recall that in one of the books"")[aSoS](/b ""Bran has a dream about his father but when he wakes he convinces himself that it was stupid and just a normal dream because his father is dead"") It's very convoluted I know, unlikely, but why change that part of the conversation in the show if there wasn't a reason for it?

I wonder because, for example, episode 10 begins with [TV Spoiler](/s ""news of Ned's death in Winterfell."") Although this is shown immediately after it happens, it must be some time in the future because of the time it takes the ravens to get there. Of course it makes sense to just skip ahead in time and show that, but I also like how in Clash of Kings, [ACOK Spoiler](/b ""Dany finally hears news from Westeros -- King Robert's death. Of course a lot had happened since then, but being so far east, there is quite a delay."") I like this realism. It's a lot more believable than when someone dies at the end of one chapter, and the next chapter begins with someones reaction from 1000 miles away.

And I carry my list close to my heart,

Hoping that one day I take their last breath,

But if I were to be asked ""Who are you?""

We have a posting policy that defines what is ok to post here, but some of these posts get multiple mod reports every time even though they have been technically fine to post.  So in an effort to let the community help make a decision about these types of posts, we're going to have a vote to see just how much people hate them.  

**Each content type is listed in its own thread below.  Vote up if you think it should remain; vote down if you want it gone.**  If you have a question about the content type, post a reply in its thread for clarification.  

A barely negative result will not guarantee the post-type will be excluded; based on the overall results we'll find a line in the percentages that indicates a ""clear majority.""  That's what we are looking for to prove the need to make the change.  We want to be inclusive much more than exclusive, so I expect that will mean needing a 2/3 majority or better to push a change through.  

Remember: Up to ALLOW - Down to REMOVE

People felt most strongly about keeping memes and cast photos, as long as the photos were not just showing the actors in another movie or show.  

As far as policy changes go, we'll now be removing photo-posts such as ""I see a character as..."" and ""My face when I read...""  Expect similar post-photo-for-karma topics that don't really go anywhere to also be removed under the same umbrella.  Posts about posts will also no longer be allowed, so post something new or wait the 2-weeks to repost.  The rage comics votes were *barely* over 2/3 negative a couple days ago and actually got a couple points more positive in the meantime, so for now rage comics will stay.  Vote them down if you don't like them.

Changes to the posting policy reflecting the results of this vote will be posted soon. Thanks everyone for contributing.

Here's why:

Khal Drogo, where do I start. He's the series' original badass. He's Khal of the Khalasar, married to Daenerys Targaryen, and doesn't give two shits what you think of him. [AGoT Spoiler](/b ""he dies in the aftermath of killing another Khal (in the show, because he's protecting Dany), never cutting his braid throughout his entire life. If it weren't for his funeral pyre, those badass dragons also wouldn't have hatched!"")

Oberyn Martell is not only one of the most badass characters, he's in my top 5 favorite characters in the entire series. [ASoS Spoiler](/b ""He agrees to Tyrion's champion solely for the purpose to get revenge on Gregor Clegane, they man who murdered his sister and her children. ""You raped her, you murdered her, you killed her children,"" ending with the most heroic ""ELIAAAAAAAA"" before getting his face smashed in by the Mountain, but he's not done. Even after death, his poison continues to slowly and excruciatingly kill him."") Beast.

Beric Dondarrion is the fucking Lightning Lord. His [ASoS Spoiler](/b ""fight with the Hound, where he lights his sword on fire with his own blood"") one of the coolest fights in the series. Not only is he the leader and founder of the  Brotherhood Without Banners, [ASoS Spoiler](/b ""he dies seven godly times."") *Nuff' said.*

Reply with your most badass character in the comments, and remember to hide your spoilers!


Edit 1: I made this list so quickly, so here are some honorable mentions: 

Victarion Greyjoy - seriously, just type his name into Google and look at auto-finish

Arya Stark! - no explanation needed

Daenerys Targaryen - really shines in Book 1 and Book 3

Joffrey Baratheon - just kidding. I hate that prick. *kof kof*

Thoros of Myr - because Beric would be nothing without him

Bronn - the sellsword that doesn't take shit from anybody

For instance, in the final Sansa chapter [Book Spoiler](/b ""I actually got the sense that Sansa's character was more dynamic than she had been before.  Some of the things in that chapter seemed to signal that her character might be undergoing changes.  Her having lived under a different name and being so close to Petyr for so long had a part in that I suppose."")  I also thought that the last Samwell chapter [Book Spoiler](/b ""did quite a bit to move the plot forward with the dying words from Maester Aemon to Sam while aboard the Cinnamon Wind."")

In addition, [Book Spoiler](/b ""the pickle that Cersei ends up getting herself into was particularly satisfying especially since it was almost entirely of her own making.

All of the other areas have a few characters who jump out in the show and make it interesting, except for the watch, all you have there in the show is Jon and Sam, and I guess the Old bear to a lesser extent. So I think that if they did do webisodes involving Pypp and Grenn, it would bring a lot more character to the wall and will help make it more intriguing to watch.

And not only the lands, but also the people that live in them. Here's what I figured.

**The North**. Scandinavia. Lots of forests, wolves, lakes, snow, ice. 

**The Riverlands** Germany&amp;The Netherlands. Rich, fertile, populous. The rivers are important for trade. 

**The Vale** Switzerland. Isolated from the rest of Westeros. Lots of mountains, almost impregnable. 

**The Iron Islands** Iceland. Just rocks and ice, that's it. Rocky, stormy, not a very friendly place.

**The Reach** France, of course. Chilvary is very important. The best wine in Westeros comes from The Arbor (House Redwyne)

**Dorne** Spain, Morocco. The hottest region, lots of sand, hot-blooded people.


Not sure about The Westerlands, though. It doesn't really stand out. I would say the Lannisters were like Italians, but they are all blondes.

It can even be a twist and make it so Jon Snow is the assassin instead of using Ezio at all (with Jon wearing a Nights Watch themed assassins armor).

That's not to say I haven't enjoyed the series to far, I definitely have, and AGOT and ACOK were good in their own right, but now ASOS really took GRRM to the next level. 

By now, the characters that have been around since the beginning have really started to take form, we can anticipate how they will respond to reactions, but GRRM keeps us on our toes with the twists. I loved the Red Wedding, I almost forgot I was reading a book, it was like I was actually their, watching it all happen. I cried over the death of a few characters I loved. Then, I fist pumped when a few of the ones I hated died (Looking at you Joff). And then we see Jamie, who's chapters I love second only to Arya's, become one of my favorite characters (I think someone mentioned this in a meme earlier on this subreddit. Spot on) 

I can't wait to start on AFFC, I hope it takes the baton from ASOS.

The objective of the draft was to create a new House from the best combination of 13 characters, considering military might, culture, future lineage, and awesomeness.

Here are the results:

**House JSB**
* Daenerys Targaryen
* Jamie Lannister
* Bran Stark
* Varys
* Bronn
* Jorah Mormont
* Alliser Thorne
* Osha
* Catelyn Tully
* Yoren
* Samwell Tarly
* Hodor
* Septa Mordane

**House KDF**
* Eddard Stark
* Robert Baratheon
* Petyr Baelish
* Cersei Lannister
* Gregor Clegane
* Tywin Lannister
* Rickon Stark
* Sansa Stark
* Jeor Mormont
* Shagga, son of Dolf
* Walder Frey
* Hot Pie
* Qotho

**House JDG**
* Jon Snow
* Tyrion Lannister
* Loras Tyrell
* Robb Stark
* Sandor Clegane
* Barristan Selmy
* Shae
* Doreah
* Maester Luwin
* Ros
* Grand Maester Pycelle
* Kevan Lannister
* Jory Cassel

**House RDJ**
* Arya Stark
* Khal Drogo
* Syrio Forel
* Maester Aemon
* Gendry
* Benjen Stark
* Irri
* Illyrio Mopatis
* Beric Dondarrion
* Rakharo
* Jon Umber
* Rodrik Cassel
* Tommen Baratheon

Who will have the best House dynamic?  Who would win an all-out war?  We can't decide, because we each thing we have the best House.

*So, who won?*

Note: We assumed that all characters are living, they come with all of their inherent strengths [TV Spoiler](/s ""(dragons, dire wolves, third-eye)""), but do not automatically possess any one region (so if you had a Stark, a Baratheon, and a Lannister, you don't get The North, King's Landing, and Casterly Rock).",20,5,False,self,,,,,

It'as at around 0:37 right after ""On April 1st"" and it shows two knights in full plate fighting it out atop a wall, with one knight eventually knocking the other of. There is a lot of spectators and looks as if it's a trail by battle except there aren't any until [SoS spoiler](/b ""The Mountain vs Prince Oberyn""). So I was wondering who is fighting and where is it? 

Edit: Upon closer inspection it is the Hound. I still don't know what part of the book its from.

Here it goes:

Petyr convinced Lysa to murder Jon Arryn and write the Starks that the Lannisters did this. So this meant the Starks suspected the Lannisters first when Bran fell.

I've been looking forward to grabbing Season 1 on BR for a while. It comes out tomorrow in my country (New Zealand).

However, my wife bought it for me as a surprise over the weekend from Amazon. Which is awesome, except that NZ is region B for BluRay disks, while the US is region A. I tried to cancel the order, but they had already shipped it.

I found a webpage that says it's actually region free (http://regionfreemovies.com/bluray/Game_Of_Thrones_-_Complete_First_Season/US) but I don't know if I can trust that site, and if I open the disks when they arrive, and they don't work, having opened them means I wont be able to return them.

So, could someone who has the BR set (preferably from Amazon) have a look at the back of the cover and tell me what it says for the region? I'm hoping it says ""Region ABC"" meaning that it's not region locked at all. Could someone confirm it for me?

Thanks!",8,2,False,self,,,,,

When Sansa gets snatched away/saved and becomes Alayne, Petyr Baelish has a very frank conversation with her, about necessary evils. He slices open a pomegranate, and presents her with half of it. She refuses. Is this some sort of Persephone reference, or an innocent piece of fruit?

Daenerys chapters always have her full name as the title, but she goes by ""Dany"". The teaser at the end of Feast for Crows switches between Dany and Daenerys depending on how confident/cruel or compassionate/human she is. Do you think she ends up as one or the other, or both?

Obviously, this flies in the face of Jamie and Robert never having a legitimate child. Did they have a legitimate child (and a legitimate heir) that was taken from her at a young age?

Two episodes later, when Ned starts following John Arryn's tracks and meets Gendry, he recalls his mother having ""blonde hair"" and being taken from her at a young age, in a way that seems to echo the Cersei/Catelyn discussion, at least to my ears. Obviously, this doesn't mean it's definitely Cersei, but might the producers of the show (and Martin) be upping the stakes for Gendry's character on the TV show? 

Or if not, just what is the deal with Cersei's story there? When I watched the show last year before reading the books, I thought it served to humanize her character some. But now watching the scene after reading the books, I wonder if there's more to it. Thoughts?",47,14,False,self,,,,,

I think evidence supports Jon being a ""hero"" of the book, if such a word really applies to a series with such delicious and grounded moral ambiguity, and I feel confident but not positive that he will turn out to be AA come again.



That being said, one of my favorite things about this series is how Martin seeds the books with so many twists and questions that speculation and theorizing can happen to the extent it does.  It's fun to come out with theories even if you don't think they are true, or would rather they didn't ever come true.  I've been thinking about how certain characters who could be called ""villains"" at the series start (again, like heroes, not quite an accurate label for this series but you get what I'm trying to say) who turn to ""heroes"", or turn from ""bad"" to ""good"", so to speak.  Our golden-handed Kingslayer and Theon Turncloak both have arcs that show this kind of shift.


What I wonder is if Martin has another genre-bending twist in store along these lines; while I don't think this will happen, and would prefer it didn't:  What if the Starks are the ""villains""?  Much like how killing Ned in the first book goes against the fantasy tropes that set him up as a ""hero"", perhaps the entire first book aligning our sympathies with the Stark family was another brilliant literary bit of misdirection.  We have seen the family destroyed.  We have seen the patriarch killed, and the matriarch turned into a vengeful zombie.  We have seen Arya turned into an amoral killer.  We have seen Sansa go immediately from childlike glee to being crushed by cruelty that could turn one very cynical, and turn one's heart to stone; now she is being trained by a master manipulator who uses his skills to obtain his desires at the expense of others lives.  The youngest Stark is wild, and in the wild, with a wilding, hanging with cannibals.  Bran has become part of something so great, so everlasting, that perhaps the squabbles and concerns of the mere mortal will become meaningless to him, existing beyond the reach of age and time and death, manipulating things from a frozen north far from society and human concerns.  Jon Snow could come back from the dead changed; angry, or feeling betrayed, or simply no longer himself.  What do you think of the spitball notion that the Winds of Winter, formerly a Time of Wolves, is about how the remnants of the Starks become a scourge, the ""villains"", that need to be defeated by our heroes, the Kingslayer, former friend of the ""evil"" Jon Snow, Samwell Tarly, Dany returning to right the wrongs done by the usurper and his cold-eyed pet wolf (now fighting the man's family, all even colder than she had heard he was, their blood turned to ice by the horrors perpetrated on them)?


**TL;DR**:  I don't think this will happen, but just for the fun of crazy speculation and theories, what if the Starks have been turned into the ""villains"" of the story by all that has happened to them, and they will be the ones doing the dark deeds and needing to be stopped by the ""heroes"" in these final books?",3,9,False,self,,,,,

I figured I'd share my ""theory"" on how they'll work around this issue.  
[Book Spoiler](/b ""Bran can be kept busy at Winterfell throughout the season, no problem (as long as his green dreams are somehow incorporated, even if they go mostly unexplained/are vaguely explained) However, the sack of Winterfell does have to occur at the end of season 2 since its the only 'logical' way for Jaime to be released by Cat (she goes mad with grief and whatnot and her decision to send him to fetch her daughters would not make much sense otherwise. Basically, Bran and Rickon need to 'die' unless the writers intend to keep Jaime locked up doing absolutely nothing for a whole 'nother season.) Bran and Rickon can easily escape with Osha and Hodor. What the writers could do (hopefully did) is mention the Reeds (Maester Luwin telling Bran that two Crannogmen (Crannogchildren?) are en route and that hopefully they will provide good company for the young prince. Then, within the first half or third of the third season, Bran could be 'ambushed' or something by Meera and Jojen, who tell him that they knew he would be in that area because Jojen had a dream about the young wolf prince escaping the sea and flayed man on the shoulder of a giant (or something along those lines). They explain that they were the Crannogmen that were supposed to go to Winterfell but that they instead stopped and waited in the wilderness when Jojen saw that there was nothing but death waiting for them at Winterfell. Bran is wary at first but quickly learns to trust the swamp children since Jojen can give him a little more insight about green dreams and warging. After that, the story pretty much goes on the way its supposed to, with the large group splitting into two, one headed for the crow and the other headed for Skagos. Osha can shed a little light on Bran's dreams (she can tell him that she's heard of dreams that tell of the future) so that all Jojen has to do is offer to give a more precise explanation "")

Again, just my two cents. I'd like to hear what others have to say. Does my theory make sense?is it plausible/sensible/practical? What do you think will happen?

As Robb Stark and his northern army continue the war against the Lannisters, Tyrion arrives in Kings Landing to counsel Joffrey and temper the young kings excesses.  On the island of Dragonstone, Stannis Baratheon plots an invasion to claim his late brothers throne, allying himself with the fiery Melisandre, a strange priestess of a stranger god.  Across the sea, Daenerys, her three young dragons and khalasar trek through the Red Waste in search of allies, or water.  In the North, Bran presides over a threadbare Winterfell, while beyond the Wall, Jon Snow and the Nights Watch must shelter with a devious wildling.
Written by David Benioff and D.B. Weiss; directed by Alan Taylor.

Episode #12:  The Night Lands

In the wake of a bloody purge in the capital, Tyrion chastens Cersei for alienating the kings subjects.  On the road north, Arya shares a secret with Gendry, a Nights Watch recruit.  With supplies dwindling, one of Danys scouts returns with news of their position.  After nine years as a Stark ward, Theon Greyjoy reunites with his father Balon, who wants to restore the ancient Kingdom of the Iron Islands.  Davos enlists Salladhor Saan, a pirate, to join forces with Stannis and Melisandre for a naval invasion of Kings Landing.
Written by David Benioff and D.B. Weiss; directed by Alan Taylor.

Episode #13:  What Is Dead May Never Die

At the Red Keep, Tyrion plots three alliances through the promise of marriage.  Catelyn arrives in the Stormlands to forge an alliance of her own.  But King Renly, his new wife Margaery and her brother Loras Tyrell have other plans.  At Winterfell, Luwin tries to decipher Brans dreams.
Written by Bryan Cogman; directed by Alik Sakharov.

Episode #14:  Garden of Bones

Joffrey punishes Sansa for Robbs victories, while Tyrion and Bronn scramble to temper the kings cruelty.  Catelyn entreats Stannis and Renly to forego their ambitions and unite against the Lannisters.  Dany and her exhausted khalasar arrive at the gates of Qarth, a prosperous city with strong walls and rulers who greet her outside them.  Tyrion coerces a queens man into being his eyes and ears.  Arya and Gendry are taken to Harrenhal, where their lives rest in the hands of The Mountain, Gregor Clegane.  Davos must revert to his old ways and smuggle Melisandre into a secret cove.
Written by Vanessa Taylor; directed by David Petrarca.

Episode #15:  The Ghost of Harrenhal

The end of the Baratheon rivalry drives Catelyn to flee and Littlefinger to act.  At Kings Landing, Tyrions source alerts him to Joffreys flawed defense plan and a mysterious secret weapon.  Theon sails to the Stony Shore to prove hes worthy to be called Ironborn.  In Harrenhal, Arya receives a promise from Jaqen Hghar, one of three prisoners she saved from the Gold Cloaks.  The Nights Watch arrive at the Fist of the First Men, an ancient fortress where they hope to stem the advance of the wildling army.
Written by David Benioff and D.B. Weiss; directed by David Petrarca.

It doesn't even have to be a specific character, I can just be a 'Lannister' or a brother of the Night's Watch. It does have to be simple to dress up as and cost effective since I'm broke. 

Please suggest a character/individual to dress up as, and where to get the cosplay materials. Thanks everyone!

It's rather larger than it needs to be; it's like he has a letter opener stuck to his chest. This has led to a rather morbid train of thought. In the previews for Season 2, we see Tyrion wearing the same Hand pin several times. However, there's not much sight of the gold clasping-hands chain (he might be wearing it on his armor in one shot?). In the books, it's mentioned a lot. It's a really obvious gun on the mantlepiece. This seems to have been replaced with the pin. What if in Season 4 (?) when Tyrion finally goes to kill Shae, instead of choking her with the chain, he ends up just stabbing her to death with the pin? (Honestly, I'm not sure if that's more or less horrible.) I bet this is what they'll end up doing. ",6,4,False,self,,,,,

One of the awesome features is that there's a menu on the right side as you watch, and it will light up if there's additional info about the scene.  They give a blurb or two about different characters.

But the best part is, the history section has its own videos, that will pause the show and play the video, then go right back to the show, and they get into a LOT of the history that was explicit in the book but only hinted at in the show.  The videos are narrated by various GoT actors (Charles Dance for example does a few of the Lannister ones).

What else is neat is that they do various viewpoints.  There is a Stark viewpoint about the Night's Watch, and a contrasting Lannister viewpoint about them as well, that tells the story slightly different.  There are several viewpoints for other things as well (wars, magic, etc.).

I have no idea if any of this is available on the regular DVD, but if you're shopping it should say if it does on the back.

I am a pathetically slow reader, though calling myself a 'reader' is a stretch to begin with. I knew minimal about the the timeline of the book releases and nothing about the pretense of both AFFC and ADWD until i was about to start AFFC and wanted to learn why it got poor reviews.

Despite learning that there was an unusual long wait before AFFC and that the series was originally intended to skip books 4/5 and pick up 5 years later ... It hadnt dawned on me until about midway through AFFC  why this book was so '*different'* and where the bad reviews were coming from... But now it is quite obvious: *by already planning to leave book 3 and pick up 5 years later he had forbade himself from killing anyone or dramatically changing the plot arcs of any characters*.

The former issue is a huhge one because GRRM is synonymus with death. The magic of the first three books is the reminder that you dont know who will survive or how long, no matter how much he builds the character up or what direction you think he is leading you. But moreso is the complete inability to create any new paths for the characters to take that would leave a reader lost if they weree to skip books 4/5. 

That is the key element in AFFC that causes so many readers' disappointment ... *and*, i'd wager was the entire reason why the last two books took so long for GRRM to write relative to the biannual pace of the first three. ""Can you skip books 4/5 and not be completely lost?""  

I'm now 80% though AFFC and the most noteworthy characters to die have been Biter and Aemon. Thats it. Meanwhile no character has done anything substantial that couldnt be described as a continuation of ASOS's ending. *That* is the cause for all the disappointment, not that GRRM lost his touch.

Ultimately, when reading all of the AFFC complaints my one worry was that GRRM had lost his 'mojo': that he concluded a three book whopper of a story and ""hit the wall"" so to speak. It wasnt until i could put the experience of reading the actual material into proper context to be relieved that that fear was so very very wrong. In fact, that GRRM had already clearly detailed out the future of the characters to the point that the following books couldnt disrupt their path from the conclusion of ASOS became assurance that he definitely knew what he was doing and that this series is going to have one ridiculiusly epic conclusion.

Unfortunately I havent gotten a chance to read the books yet. Please dont condemn me, I do in fact read books, I just havent gotten around to it.



Do you think it would be better to read the books before I start watching season 2, or just wait until whenever I feel like it? I am in Germany, and probably won't be able to watch the series (legally) until the end of 2012.



I really love the show, but I somehow dont want to ruin my viewing experience by having read the books beforehand. does anyone get where Im coming from? 



I had never read the books, when I first watched the show, and I was mesmerized by it. I fell in love with the actors and can't wait for the next show. I love the way the show was filmed and edited and I'm afraid if I read the books first that I'll ruin the viewing experience for myself.



And before you get your pitchforks out: I do enjoy to read, I am not an illiterate dumbass, but I am especially tied to the TV series.







ALSO:

(This might seem completely weird, but:)




A couple of days ago I read that Jason Momoa (Khal Drogo) proposed to add a scene to the series where they show what a bad-ass his character actually is.


[TV Spoiler](/s ""This was shown by him killing Mago. Now I'm wondering , would Mago have been killed off anyway, or not? Wouldnt the actor who played Mago be pissed off that his death was proposed by Jason Momoa and he was therefore cut from the show?"")

This has probably been brought up before and I don't remember what exactly I read to make me think this, but does anyone else think this might be the case?

Lyanna's death hasn't been explained yet (could have been from childbirth?) and from DWD, the relationship between Lyanna and Rhaegar was made even clearer.  It also makes sense for Ned to take Jon, raise him and claim him as his own bastard.  Ned's dreams also involved Lyanna asking him to promise her something.

The one problem I see with this is why would he let Jon take the Black, knowing full well that he would be pretty much removed from the realm up there.  But then again, he would still be a bastard born between Rhaegar and Lyanna and that would have been the safest place for him to be given Robert was still king.

Also, there are already 2 Targaryeans in play and 3 dragons.  If Jon Snow really is Rhaegar's bastard son, he could very much be the 3rd dragon rider (if he survived DWD that is).

Does anyone else have anything to add?  Any glaring holes that this speculation might have?  The more I think about it, the more it actually makes sense, but of course I might have missed a couple of things.",2,0,False,default,,,,,

Spoilers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/r1u13/question_about_the_whole_across_the_narrow_sea/,kol-,1332056577,"Hey guys, I've just finished watching the first season of GoT and I'm having a hard time understanding some of the details of the Across the Narrow Sea plot. 

OK so Visyrys forces Daenerys to marry Drogo because he is under the assumption that if he does this then Drogo will use his army to help him reclaim his throne. But Drogo shows absolutely no interest in doing any of this until Daenerys is nearly poisoned, well after Visyrys death.

When Arrya is hiding in the dungeon she overhears the eunuch guy talking with Illyrio, and it is revealed that they are in cahoots with the Targaryans and are conspiring to have Drogo and his army invade and conqueror the kingdom. But then the eunuch is later shown to be in favor of the assassination attempt on Daenerys and even lobbies for it.

OK so my questions are:

A) Did nobody bother to talk to Drogo about this? Out of all the characters he seems to be the only one oblivious to the fact that people expect him to invade the kingdom. The eunuch mentions that Drogo is waiting for his son to be born before invading, but a few episodes later we are shown Daenerys talking to him about the idea, and he seems unwilling to accept the notion that they can even make it across the sea, much less win the war. Not to mention he comes right out and says ""The stallion who mounts the world has no need for iron chairs."" So why does everyone have these massive misunderstandings about his intentions? Visrys thought he would mount an attack immediately after the wedding, Jorah says Drogo will attack when the omens are right, And the eunuch says he's waiting for his son to be born. Either Drogo was never in fact asked about his intentions, or he has the worst translator of all time.

B) If Drogo had no intentions of invading the Kingdom why did he marry Daenerys? I'm under the impression that in this universe powerful men marry woman for political reasons, so why would he agree to marry a woman he's never met before when there are no clear political benefits. 

C) And finally, what was the eunuchs end game? Did he want an invasion? Did he just want information or was there something I missed?


I would be extremely grateful if someone could answer any of these questions for me. If any of these questions are supposed to answered at a later time, please don't spoil the second book/season for me, just let me know that more details are coming. Thanks.

What do you guys think of the possibility that Jamie is Cersie's prophecized killer? 

The Frog's prophecy only stated that she will be killed by her younger brother. It was never stated explicitly that it was Tyrion. Cersei just assumed that part. Even though Jamie is her twin, if I remember right he was born second, so that would make him (slightly) younger. I think it would be odd for Martin to mention that, if it wasn't significant. This seems to fit well with the arc of the story where we see Jamie growing further apart from his sister, and Cersei becoming more and more insane. Such a tragic plot twist would be fitting of Martin's style. I don't really think it would benefit the development of Tyrion's character for him to kill his sister, but Jamie... wow.

Just does not look that well made. While watching it I thought of (what I believe to be) an awesome game that should be made, and was wondering what your opinions on it are. Keep in mind this is just a fun idea that I felt like sharing.

It would be made by Bethesda, a far superior game maker to Cyanide, and would essentially play out like Assassin's Creed only in Westeros and the Free Cities. This would allow for far greater detail to be put into the cities that GRRM has described so vividly. The player would basically be a Faceless Man or Jaqen H'ghar and go around the world straight murken people in awesomely unique ways. No plot yet.

TL;DR: A GoT game like Assassin's Creed where you're Jaqen H'ghar or some random faceless man.",7,5,False,self,,,,,

I much prefer the way Lena Headey plays her as so demure that she's almost swallowing her words before she says them. She really stands out, especially in scenes with Robert and/or Ned, who are more likely to play to the back of room. It suits her much better and makes her plotting that much more theatrical.

(possible spoilers on all books),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/r71un/what_are_some_things_from_the_series_that_you/,A_Polite_Noise,1332352894,"Now, before I get accused of any blasphemy let me say that I love Martin's series.  I think he has constructed something beautiful and fascinating, full of rich characters and a world so well developed that we can spend years theorizing and picking every single paragraph apart and enjoying that almost as much as the actual prose, which itself is fantastic.  However, it is not without flaws; even Martin admitted in one interview I recall that Tyrion doing a tumbler's flip as his introduction to Jon Snow was a bit silly (though I think he did a good job in aDwD retconning an explanation for it).  Also, there are things that work great in the book but are perhaps more interesting (subjectively?  objectively?) in the way they appear on the television; some angle or notion or quirk of performance that HBO brought to the table.



For me, I love Shae.  I was so excited when Sibel Kekilli was cast for the role.  I had first seen her in the Fatih Akin film *Head-On*, and she was wonderful.  Some people have made a big thing that she was once a hardcore pornstar, but she has been doing ""legitimate"" acting for a while now, and I prefer the characterization of Shae that HBO has given her to the one in the books.  Shae in the books exists almost solely to be a quiet, adoring wall for Tyrion to bounce exposition and ideas off of.  Yes, later in her storyline we see that maybe there was more to it that whole time, but it was never evident.  The Shae of HBO as someone more driven, with a little more anger and a little more mystery, who is a bit older and stronger and will make a more interesting conversational foil and counterpoint to sharp and witty Tyrion is a great change that I think will add a lot to Tyrion's scenes.




Also, as much as I love the image of the White Walkers that we get in the prologue of the book - as knights clad in armor that wavers, almost illuminated in white - I also like the visual of them as something darker and more primitive; something ancient.  The ""White Walkers"" we see in the prologue of the HBO series are nothing like the mystical knights we see in the book, and are more akin to Uraki from LotR...and while I don't know that I prefer one to the other, it was nice to be surprised by something I had already read before.  And, again, I love how *old* the world of Ice &amp; Fire is, and the depiction of them as ""primal"", as opposed to armored and ""modern"" makes sense to me.





I also like the idea of expanding Joffrey; we only saw it a little bit in the first season, but I expect more as the series goes on.  He is still a little shit in both show and book, but the show had a few moments...him talking with Cersei, for one...that gave him some more characterization.  Mainly I am thinking of his moment of doubt:  he questions both Eddard and his daughter Sansa about why Eddard would claim Joffrey had no claim to the throne.  The uncertainty brought by Gleeson and by the writers/director to Joffrey about Eddard's claims make him seem less a monster; not sympathetic, but a horrible villain whose damage is a bit more evident.  While we all could figure out why Joffrey was such a mess in the books, from his looking up to an absent father to the teachings of his controlling and paranoid mother, it is still nice to have these elements come out of the character/performer first hand.



**TL;DR**:  I love the books, but there are some things the series did differently that I might actually prefer.  Namely:  Shae, the design of the White Walkers, and the slight expansion of Joffrey's character.  What are yours?",40,14,False,self,,,,,

Westeros has dramatically changed from the reality of Game of Thrones with the Starks, Baratheons, and Lannisters being the major houses in the ""game."" Daenerys Targaryen and her brother were refugees having to seek an army in the arms of Khal Drogo, who was supposedly going to ride upon Westeros with 40,000 Dothraki screamers.

By ADWD, House Stark has fallen from grace, lost Winterfell, and had most of its family members killed or exiled. House Baratheon possibly has no living members left to inherit the throne. House Lannister has it's three remaining members incarcerated, disillusioned (and willing to betray/abandon the House), and exiled abroad as a damned slave. The Houses named Martell, Tyrell, and Bolton appear to be on the rise in Westeros, while Targaryen and Connington (by way of Targaryen) are relevant coming from the eastern lands.


The landscape has changed SO much since the first book, and I love GRRM for it. As we all know, nobody is safe - not even those who appear to be the chosen ones (Jon Snow anybody?). To me, it feels like Daenerys is GRRM's baby and she is the only untouchable...but I also think this could be shattered. I do think GRRM may be writing toward ""restoring the proper order"" of the Targaryen dynasty, since in the full scope of Westeros, the Baratheon Rebellion was a hiccup.


------------------------------BULLSHIT THEORIES BELOW, I know it has holes and errors galore. I'm just thinking of the worst case scenario. I typed this up in a bored 10 minutes--------------------


Here's my worst case scenario for how things could pan out [based o my love of the characters], but maybe in the most ""GRRM"" fashion. This is not knowing about the introduction of new characters in WoW or DoS. Keep in mind, I literally cannot touch on every storyline because it's so complex so this will just be a rough overview:

North - Ramsay Bolton has actually killed Stannis, and he and his father have a tenuous hold on the North. The Night's Watch has been completely destroyed without Stannis' support - and it has been overrun by the Others, who have penetrated south of the Wall and have the strength of a full winter owning them. Bran and Rickon...I have no idea.

South (broadly - everything south of Riverrun) - Varys' plan to create a rift by killing Kevan has worked, but the Faith has gained overwhelming control of King's Landing. Cersei's somehow won her freedom through Robert Strong (just because she's a fucking cunt and i know she won't escape punishment). The Tyrells collapse under Euron Greyjoy's assaults, and lose their footing in King's Landing. The the Martells have moved into the void. The Sand Snakes are seeing that Doran's plan is coming to fruition. Jon Connington and young Griff's forces are sweeping in from the east and crushing opposition on their way to the throne. So two armies coming in for King's Landing.

The Eastern lands, broadly everything across the sea - (this is the most farfetched part but I want to have fun here) The Greyjoys are devastated as well. Asha is killed when Ramsay overruns Stannis' army. Victarion dies in his efforts to pursue Dany, but she is crippled when Euron's dragon horn plays a part in chaos which results in the deaths of two of them. Dany's command and presence is devastated when she has only one dragon to her name, and she loses much of her army/following. Reflecting on the devastation she has suffered in her efforts to reclaim the throne of Westeros, she does the unthinkable and settles for ruling territory in the Free Cities/somewhere further East. She never comes home, enraging millions of readers. Arya returns to Westeros as a full fledged assassin and seeks out Cersei for assassination. Jaime aids in her betrayal. She remains unaware that any of her siblings are alive and does not reunite with them. Tyrion...DIES. Yep, GRRM just offs everybody's favorite. Not sure how, but it won't be glorious.

TL;DR - Boltons rule the North, but the Others are coming south of the Wall. King's Landing is ruled by the Faith as Euron Greyjoy sweeps through the Reach from the West, and Connington's army sweeps in from the East. Both armies are trying to seize the throne. Cersei is free but the Faith is ruling in King's Landing. Arya is on her way to assassinate Cersei. Dany loses two dragons in battle with Victarion, and lamenting her losses doesn't come back to Westeros. Tyrion is dead.

I don't think I've ever disliked Stannis and his stubbornness as much as I did reading that scene.

I figured to use a medieval recipe. Poking around, I remembered that I hate medieval cookery. What's with stewing fruit with meat, all the time? Why was medieval cuisine so deadly opposed to savory?

But neither did I want to go straight up modern - I make ribs all the time. They're awesome. But you'd never mistake them for Westeros. A backyard in Texas, maybe - but not Winterfell. So after some more poking around I found a recipe for ribs that Bunratty Castle uses for their medieval-themed catering. Boiled ribs. Heresy. Yet, authentically medieval-ish, it seemed to me. Still, their sauce uses quite a few modern ingredients, so I just pitched that and made my own. I believe it's sufficiently original to count as my own.

Westerosi rib with garlic and herbs (this recipe is per rack, adjust ingredients appropriate)

1 rack of baby back pork ribs.

*1/2 a yellow onion

*1 tbsp olive oil

*4 cloves of garlic, minced

*4 sprigs of fresh thyme, chopped very fine.

*4 leaves of fresh of sage, chopped very fine.

*1 Bay leaf.

*1 tsp of Worcestershire sauce

*1 tsp of powdered onion

*2 cups of ham stock

*1/2 tsp of dried tarragon

*A pinch of truffle salt

remove the membrane from the bone side of the ribs. Put the ribs in a large pot, and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil and simmer for 35-40 minutes - longer for more ribs. Until fork-tender. Scoop the fat out occasionally. Preheat your oven to 350F/175C.

Meanwhile: In a small sauce pan, heat up the olive oil over high heat. When it shimmers but before it smokes, put in the onion, and cook until soft and translucent, about three minutes. Add the garlic, thyme, sage, powdered onion, bay leaf and tarragon and a pinch of truffle salt if you have it. Stir.

When the mixture is hot, stir in the ham stock. Dash in the worcesteshire sauce, season to taste with salt and pepper, and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer, and reduce the sauce until it's thick and sticky and will stick to the back of a spoon with gusto. This may take about as long as the ribs will boil, so it's good to do them together. Remove the bay leaf.

When the ribs are tender, put them on the rack of roasting pan. Slather all over with the sauce. Put it in the oven, meat side up, and bake for about 40-50 minutes, until the sauce is crusty and brown.",19,36,False,self,,,,,

* At the very end of aDwD, she is found by Khal Jhaqo and his khalasar. Jhaqo's khalasar supposedly consists of 20,000 riders. Mago is one of his bloodriders. 
* Daenerys vowed in aGoT to avenge the death of one of her captured slaves Eroeh: ""Before I am done with them, Mago and Ko Jhaqo will plead for the mercy they showed Eroeh."" (so it's safe to assume she hates these dudes, and they would hate her for various reasons as well)
* This meeting is also the first time that Jhaqo and his riders have seen her dragon, and they possibly had no idea she had them to begin with since they fled before she gave birth to them in aGoT.

Personally, I loved her character way more back when she was still in a Dothraki setting. That's where she did the most growing, and maybe this opportunity presents itself as her reaching a final maturity/readiness to take on Westeros.

TL;DR - Now that she's back in the world of khalasars and Dothraki, do you think she will be able to get them to fight with her all the way to Westeros? Any other theories?",7,0,False,self,,,,,

Basically I read all the books one after another. Let me start by saying I love the series. But of course there is a but. I think GRRM really messed up the series with Storm of Swords. The Red Wedding, Joff, Tyrion killing Tywin, and some other things. I understand the need to be spontaneous and to kill off some characters but I feel like the series hasn't really recovered from a Storm of Swords. It was setup perfectly for this large conflict between the Starks and Lannisters and Dany could of come to mix things up but the whole narrative changed with those events. I feel like he overreached.

Call me a doubter but I don't see a really satisfying ending for the Starks (and maybe thats the way its meant to be). Joff is dead, Tywin is dead, the Mountain is dead (supposedly), Jaime is reformed. All that's left is Cersei and as evil as she is. I don't see her as the ""big bad"". Who does Arya assassinate now? Will there be justice for Ned? The glory that should have been the Starks has been stolen by the likes of Tyrion, Littlefinger, and the Red Viper. I was hoping the Starks could get back in it in Feast and Dance but they show no signs of  it. Instead GRRM shifts the narrative to plotlines we either didn't care about initially or even know about: Doran, Quentyn, Arianne, the sand snakes, Euron, Damphair, Victorian, and in my mind the most egregious, Aegon who comes out of nowhere. I feel like Martin has created so many storylines he wont be able to bring them all together and finish them off in a satisfying way.

I think it will all boil down to Dany and Jon and fighting the Others but I don't want the story to just be that. I want all the other stuff to matter. I want the time I invested in the Starks and Lannisters to mean something. I don't care about the Ironborn or the Dornish or Aegon. (At this point I know I'm ranting I figure I'll just keep going). I don't want twists and turns just for the sake of having twists and turns. Martin shouldn't be unconventional just to be unconventional. There should be a purpose to it all. 

I want an alternate storyline where Robb lives and has a massive battle with Tywin and Jamie. I want Arya to sneak into the Red Keep and assassinate Joffrey whispering Valar Morghulis in his ear while she slips Needle into his belly. I want the Hound to rescue his Jonquil from littlefinger. I still want the Jon and Dany victories. I still want the realm to be saved. I just wish ...

Anyways I'll stop ranting. Those were my thoughts and I wanted to know if anyone had a similar view. I'm still pulling for Martin and I think he's done a great job so far. I just hope the last 2 books bring it all together in a meaningful way.",15,1,False,self,,,,,

* A summons to Castle Darkstar606 for one Lord [name of friend], [titles].

* Your lordship, bannermen, and host are invited to the great feast in celebration of the witness of the Clash of Kings to decide the fate of the Realm of Westeros.

* Upon arrival a tribute of delicacies from your lands will be made to the preparation of the great feast.

That is all I have so far and I have room for maybe 2-3 more sentences. We are planning on each bringing different dishes and have medieval music and watching Game of Thrones, obviously. I would like to say something along the lines of how they will be entertained and would like to sound... medieval, for lack of a better word. We are a bunch of smokers too and I would like to include something about that activity. Can someone who is more creative than me please help me out? Thank you!

I realized that at that moment he will probably be reborn as Azor Ahai, as in reborn in the flames. His body won't burn and he will come back with his sword aflame (the true Lightbringer).

Danaerys in the Plaza of Pride atop her white steed brought tears to my eyes for an hour. So many themes collided in this one chapter: 
 * how she was not embittered by her botched liberation of the Lhazareen women that killed Drogo;
 * how she turned from listless, vapid child into a woman worthy of the title Queen, and now my favorite character (and now that she's won me over, in danger of being sacrificed by GRRM for a future climactic scene);
 * the juxtaposition of bringing freedom to the slaves to whom she owed nothing, and ""justice"" to the slavers, to whom she owed all her worldly and otherworldly possessions (Drogon);
 * establishing her fledgling legacy for the Westeros rumor mill to chew on;

I'm new to this subreddit also, so if this is a re-post, sorry. I read through them really quickly, and haven't yet re-read them, so I have this theory, and can't remember anything specific that would make it impossible, if I've forgotten something that makes it impossible, please let me know. Here goes:

Is Syrio Florel possibly a Faceless Man? and if so, could he actually be Jaquen H'ghar? Some points to ponder:

* Jaquen was in the black cells of King's Landing, reserved for the worst-of-the-worst prisoners, but he doesn't seem to be all that terrible, especially compared against Rorge and Biter, who also came from them, does this mean he is otherwise to be greatly feared? (even Rorge is scared of him) Or for some unknown reason, a very important, unique, and uncommonly dangerous prisoner?

* I can't remember Martin ever outright saying that Syrio was killed, I know the Kingsguard Knight (Meryn Trant?) he was fighting appears later in the books, which implies of course he killed Syrio, but Martin doesn't have a problem killing characters off, and ""rubbing your nose in it"" why the ambiguity? (ala Benjen Stark)

* Why was Syrio in King's Landing anyway? Considering his former position as First-Sword of Braavos, wouldn't he have to have had something important to do there to leave Braavos? Was he an assassin? Was he trying to make his way into the good graces of House Stark?

* Syrio's bits about the God of Death, the fragility of life, and the ease with which it can be taken away, have the ring of the House of Black and White all over them.

* They have very similar manners of speaking, mannerisms, constant use of phrases, idioms, sayings. Both show a playful sort of demeanor, sarcastic sense of humor, ""macho"" attitude, extreme self-assurance. They both make a practice of referring to people with pronouns only, ""a girl is quiet as a cat, but a man still hears her""...etc.

* Both are highly-trained, seasoned killers, adept in guile, stealth and grace.

* They both seem to really care about Arya, and what happens to her.

* The books say Jaquen is Lorathi, (or is that just what he tells Amory Lorch, Bolton, Hoat et. al.) but he gives Arya the Braavosi Coin which ultimately gets her into the House of Black and White, and teaches her Braavosi phrases to get her where she needs to go.

* There just seems to be more going on with Jaquen than meets the eye, and he seems to understand something about Arya's nature that makes him want to see her become something fierce and wrathful, but more than that, provide her a path to do so in a way that will make her an unstoppable force when she learns the necessary skills, the only other character who takes such an interest in her growth into a deadly little Wolf is...Syrio Florel.

edit: formatting, poor grammar/punctuation.

If I have forgotten something that makes all of this moot, let me know, as I said, I read the books very quickly, I am sure there is a lot I missed, and I can't wait to see how much more I pick up the next time through. Please share your thoughts, I've been scratching my head about this for some time, and I only have one friend who has read the books, when I brought this up to him, he waved his hand dismissively and said ""Syrio died, dumbass"". I think there may be more to it than that.

Final Essay Assignment on The Game of Thrones

Due: as soon as you are able to finish over Spring Break

The Game of Thrones by George RR Martin, creates a story of competing families,
tribes and world views, each with their own values, priorities, and goals.

Take three or four of those tribal world views and explore:

--their primary values (what are goals or characteristics are deemed most
important to that tribal or familys world view, whether you agree with them or
not)

--their god or gods if there are any (a helpful definition might be: To what or to
whom does this tribe or family give their ultimate allegiance?)

--any rituals that go with their worship of that god or godsclothing, language,
legends, sacred places or objects

If you can find parallels in our world today for those whose values, gods, or rituals
may be similar, please explain.

I have a feeling that Martin is not just writing fiction, but may be making a
commentary on similar forces we find in our world today. See if you can make the
comparisons.

I think Danaerys' (and Viserys', but at least I don't have to look at that anymore), Joffrey's, and Jon Snow's hair looks ridiculous, and it kind of takes me out of the immersion because all I can think when I look at them is ""get a better hairstylist, for the love of god!""

Danaerys' hair looks completely fried - it looks like straw. Perhaps it would've been better if they'd used a wig that looks a little healthier. Joffrey's dye job is awful, too - you can see the roots for god's sake. Jon's haircut irritates the heck out of me, it completely does not suit his face at all whatsoever, he looks like a mop and the colour doesn't match his eyebrows/facial hair and just looks.. weird (then again that actor irritates me in general..).


I figured for a show with such a large budget they'd at least make the hair look a little more.. believable, considering the detail in the rest of the show (set designs, wardrobe, etc.). Am I the only one this bothers? Am I just being way too picky in expecting believable looking hair? Will any of this get fixed in Season 2 or am I doomed to look at terrible hair forever?

The first, of course, is Mago, who becomes a Khal of his own following the dissolution of Khal Drogo's Khalassar in Book 1. As we know, in ADwD Khal Mago is the one who finds Dany and Drogon in the Dothraki Sea. This will have to be changed in the show, as Drogo kills Mago in episode 8.

Another character whose fate has been edited is Doreah (the hot girl who dry humped Dany). In book 2 she dies in the Red Waste. However, in the promos of the show, you can clearly see she reaches Qarth. I imagine the creators like her and want to extend her presence on screen.

Even moreso, Ros the whore's role in the show extends far beyond her passing mention in the books; I don't believe she's even described.

I was wondering if anyone else has picked up on other characters whose presence is either expanded or reduced.",19,6,False,self,,,,,

It involves the war between Robb and Tywin. I've just finished this part of the book and I've referred back to the map a few times but I just can't get it straight in my head exactly what is happening. 

Here is my very limited understanding. Lannister's scout was caught and told to report back to Tywin that Robb commanded 20,000 soldiers and was heading straight for him. Robb did this as misdirection and actually sent 2,000 soldiers to attack Tywin head-on (thereby sending 2,000 soldiers to their death). The remaining 18,000 soldiers somehow split off and attacked Jaime (why was Jaime separated from Tywin?). Jaime did not expect this attack as all of his ravens were shot down by Stark's archers and Jaime walked straight into the trap. Jaime was then captured by Stark. 

I guess my questions are:

-Where were the Lannister armies going and why were they split? 

-Did the army of 2000 realize they were on a suicide mission?

-Why did Tywin not suspect something when Robb sent the scout back unharmed while knowing vital information about his army?

I'm certain that my overall understanding of this entire situation is very lacking. If someone wants to explain exactly what is happening here I'd greatly appreciate it!",42,17,False,self,,,,,

&gt;Last resort: When she realizes the merchants of Qarth are interested only in obtaining her dragons, Dany considers accepting help offered by a warlock. But to reach his leaders, the Undying Ones, she must travel through a complicated stone maze and face mental and physical challenges.

I would be disappointed if the show removes the supernatural aspects of the House of the Undying, especially the visions. The word ""mental"" gives me hope of a faithful depiction, though. Regardless of anything else I expect to see a dragon saving Dany at the end.

**Dislike:**

One of the things that bothers me the most from book to TV is Jon's dire-wolf Ghost.  In the TV series he growls and barks and makes all sorts of noise and there's very little emphasis on him.  

In the book, Ghost is exactly that,  a ghost.  He doesn't make a sound and it's repeatedly mentioned that he ""padded silently..."" and so on.  There's also more interaction a between him and Jon that I would've like to see since the dire-wolves play such an integral part in the following books (especially Summer).  I hope it puts more into their companions in the following season.

I understand the need to convey whats going on with a little sound, but for me, Ghost was entirely to loud.



**Like:**

I like the interactions that aren't in the book, from characters that don't have a first person perspective.  It gives a good sense of the mentality of most characters, for instance the interaction between Renly and Ser Loras.",42,10,False,self,,,,,

I will say that I hated her at first but as the books went on, I found myself actually liking her quite a bit. I honestly feel that she has the worst circumstances, other than maybe Theon, and yet she has managed to stay fairly sane. I find myself frustrated that she doesn't act more strongly but it is more in a ""you can do it"" kind of way.

1724,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2012-3-31,2012,3,31,4,rlcc7,self.gameofthrones,My thoughts so far (4 books in),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/rlcc7/my_thoughts_so_far_4_books_in/,[deleted],1333135540,"I'm towards the beginning of the 4th book and I thought I would share my opinion and thoughts. I don't care if you upvote but please don't downvote. That makes me sad :(

I have always been into books but have been rather shy to them. Mostly because they all end too soon. I would reada book and towards the end I would almost come to resent ever starting it because it would end too soon for me. I try to stick to epic fantasy novels such as the ""A song of fire and ice"" because the worlds are usual quite similar to ours and yet so far away and I find it easy to embrace the new universe and live the book(s) word by word. But the problem is always how they end to early take the ""Wheel of time"" series spanning 14 books I have only read 8 of them so far but I feel reluctant to go on knowing it will end all too soon.

For me the way the author writes how he describes the world and the characters and their thoughts and actions are very important to me but whats more important is how alive the ""universe"" is. Take the books by J.R.R. Tolkien for instance, they are well written and the story is easy to understand and follow and yet really complex for the one who cares about details. But his universe never truly felt as a live as GRRM's does. Despite it's rich history, many races and the sheer size of it, it's still a desolate universe in comparison. GRRM is also really good at keeping the suspense, when jumping from character to character he often makes you want to skip to find out what happened where you left the character. But instead of just blurting it out he makes you wait and wait building up the suspense until you realize it wont continue exactly where it left of nor directly tell you what happened. The time flows by as you follow everyone's movements which it does in all books i've read as I can recall but the big difference with the ""a song of fire and ice"" is how he helps you figure out what happened during the character jumps. Even though he is not openly following the the time between jumps he makes it very easy for you to bridge the gaps by yourself.

I am actually not sure what I was going to write to begin with or what my thoughts where exactly. But if you have not read the books you should! I love and hate them for many reasons one being how GRRM so easily kills of the characters I come to love. He makes it so easy to become attached to a character that its painful to watch them die. He'll make you think X is going to happen and how they will do this and that but instead Y happens and they die a miserable death. I really hate the way he writes them off but at the same time I love him for it. I find it makes the universe seem more a live and real not knowing what might happen and who might die and how. Each page is sure to surprise you. With Tolkiens LOTR for example you kind of realize quite early who is important to the story and most likely wont die so during the ""action"" scenes where someone risk dying you know they most likely wont and there is no real suspense although he does surprise you some it's not  directly *(why would I even try ompare them? They are both amazing writers)* comparable to Martins way of writing.


GRRM is such an amazing write it makes me wounder why I had not read his work earlier though reading the books now makes me wish I hadn't started, knowing i'll run out of books quite soon it makes me wish the series was at least 3 times as long. Another thing I love with the series is how everything is so ""real"" there is no magic, no mythical beasts no weird races or anything. It's all just like earth but different, middle aged earth but still not earth, it's all just stories told by men hundreds of years ago. But for each book the mythical legends become more and more real catching you off guard.

In fact I am certain that anyone who is not into these kinds of epic fantasy universes would find it quite easy to embrace this one. He really warms you up to it and keeps you excited. And um I suppose I should quit but one last thing usually comparing the book and the TV series is a bad thing. But here I'd say they are both great, the TV series is really great and almost as exciting as the books.
