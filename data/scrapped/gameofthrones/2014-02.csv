The off-season is over, and now that the high-activity season has begun, your friendly neighborhood mods have decided to post a reminder about the rules, guidelines, and policies of the subreddit.

Some quick links for you, which can be found in our sidebar:

* Our [Posting Policy](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/wiki/posting_policy)

* The [Spoiler Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/wiki/spoiler_guide)

* Our [What Not to Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/wiki/dont_post) list

And now for some highlighting of the major points for those who will, inevitably, not look at those links:

**1. ALL CONTENT must be relevant to subreddit discussion**

This means that comments and posts must be related to the HBO show, the ASOIAF book series, related works, etc. From the posting policy:

&gt; * Something related to the show or books should exist in the image/article/etc. prior to the post, and that connection should be the focus/point.

&gt; * Posts about non-related subjects that have only a casual connection are not relevant to story discussion

---

**2. Content With Spoilers MUST Provide Warning**

Most of you are pretty good at this, but there are still a few of you guys who aren't abiding by the spoiler guide. You can find the instructions for making spoiler text in the sidebar. Please pay careful attention to the colors, which are as important as the spoiler scope.

All posts must begin with bracketed spoiler warning (even [No Spoilers]). If they don't have any, they will be removed by the Automoderator, before anyone else can even see them. **The spoiler warning in the title sets the scope for discussion in the comments.** Any spoilers beyond the scope designated in the title must be tagged.

In your spoiler tags, your scope must be specific. No ""minor spoilers"" or ""possible spoilers"" or ""Jon storyline spoilers"". Your scope must name a season, book, or be [All Spoilers] or [No Spoilers].

**[All Spoilers] refers to spoiler from all of the released books and ASOIAF material, including Dunk &amp; Egg, the Princess and the Queen, and TWOW previews.** There is a seperate [All Show] tag which means what it says. Do not get the two mixed up, or that can cause a lot of drama and spoiling in the comments.

**[All Spoilers] also does not encompass theories.** You can talk about any event that happens, but if you want to talk about theories that are not in the books, you must use the [All Spoilers/Theory] tag. This goes for the show too. It would be [All Show/Theory].

**Posting from mobile/not knowing how to tag is NOT an excuse for not tagging comments.** Saying MAJOR SPOILERS BELOW is not a spoiler warning. It will be removed, and you may be banned. If you cannot tag your spoilers using the code in the sidebar, then you cannot post spoilers in the comments.

**Joke Spoilers must be tagged.** If someone says that they really hope x character dies, you cannot say ""Well, then tune in to Season 5!"" That's a spoiler, and must be tagged.

---

**3. CONTENT MUST BE LEGAL AND RESPECTFUL TO OTHERS**

I don't think I have to go over the meaning of the word legal. It's pretty simple. Don't post links to illegal downloads (and don't ask for them either).

**If you sexually objectify a character, actor/actress, or another redditor, you will be banned.** This means comments like ""What I wouldn't give to fuck her"" or even vague things like ""I'd do unmentionable things to that man."" If a redditor posts a cosplay, do not get all creepy up in the comment section. No one wants to read that.

Game of Thrones covers adult topics, and nudity and sex are a large part of the series. We expect a certain amount of maturity. Talking about sex in the context of the series is fine. Saying you'd love for Daenerys Targaryen to wake your dragon is not.

Along with respect comes a few reminders: **DO NOT say ""You know nothing"" or ""You sweet summer child""** The only time those are appropriate are if you are talking about dialogue between characters. Otherwise, it's considered rude, and it WILL be pulled. It might have been funny the first thousand times, but it's older than Maester Aemon at this point.

When it comes to profanity, again, be respectful. From the Posting Policy:

&gt; * Don't post excessive profanity, slurs, or any needlessly offensive or insulting comments

&gt; * Don't post inflammatory, derogatory, or rudely trollish remarks (including no real-world politics or religion)

---

**4. There is certain GOT-related content which is not accepted on this subreddit. Do not post it.**

A comprehensive list was posted above. Memes, rage comics, image macros (which do not contribute to subreddit discussion), etc. can be directed to /r/asongofmemesandrage. Generic Hodor posts can go to /r/Hodor. Anything that would fit in on /r/shittytumblrgifs does not belong here. Puns and play on words don't belong here either. Do not post face swaps.

Some other points from the Posting Policy:

&gt; * Posts about jobs the actors had before or after Game of Thrones are almost never relevant. People know how to use IMDB.

&gt; * Actor photos are not relevant unless they have something to do with the show, like meeting an actor at a filming location or you are in GOT cosplay and meet an actor at a con.

---

And finally, a more minor rule which didn't fit in any of those topics (and doesn't come up often), but needs to be said, is the Marketing/Piracy aspect, which has its own section in the policy. Some quick copy/paste for you guys:

&gt; * Photos of generic merchandise purchases are no longer considered relevant. Do not post photos of your books, t-shirts, pins, swords, or any other run-of-the-mill swag that anyone can get.

&gt; * Linking to places where merchandise can be purchased is ok.

&gt; * Commercial posts are allowed as long as they're not also spam.

&gt; * Spam accounts that exist primarily to promote a website are not allowed.

&gt; * Links to other subreddits are fine as long as the links are relevant to the discussion context and the links aren't repeated like spam.

&gt; * Don't post links with a URL shortening/hijacking tool (wp.me, bit.ly, su.pr, etc.)

&gt; * Posting the name of a site counts as directing someone to pirate, and asking for a PM to a pirate link in a comment is still asking inside the subreddit.

&gt; * Discussion of piracy as a concept is fine, including the idea that HBO's choice to limit access is driving people to piracy; just don't use this community to perform piracy.

---

**PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO LOOK THROUGH OUR [WHAT NOT TO POST LIST](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/wiki/dont_post)**

It includes a lot of things which are posted often during the high-traffic season, including (but not limited to) pictures of smartphone conversations/FB statuses/omegle conversations, etc.

---

Thanks for (hopefully) reading through those rules in the Posting Policy, Spoiler Guideline, and What Not To Post page. For getting through that all, you guys deserve a [puppy pic](http://i.imgur.com/jTABf63.jpg).

Keep posting, have fun, and hopefully soon we'll have even more trailers to hype us up some more (and on that note, please also refrain from saying GET HYPE. It's not a rule, but it's beginning to get annoying IMO).

---

**EDIT**: There was a question below about the [Season 4] tag and the [Season 3/ASOS] tag. Here is the answer I gave:

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1v452w/mod_raven_psa_what_season_4_means_as_a_spoiler/) was the old PSA about what the [Season 4] tag means. **Tagging [Season 4] means mentioning items in the trailers, promo shots, etc. Only things that are 100% in S4. Even if it's generally accepted that the season will cover something, you cannot post anything about that in S4.** You *can* post things like that in [S4/ASOS], which includes the ASOS tag. Non-book readers can also speculate their own ideas in [S4/Theory], which does NOT encompass ASOS.

As the spoiler guide says, **the [ASOS/Season 3]** tag or any tag with the form [Book/Show Season] includes all the events of the show up through that season, as well as all the events of the books up through that book.** These should generally be used for comparisons between the book and show, or mentioning how a specific element from that book was handled in the show. **THAT TAG IS NOT SAFE FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT READ THE BOOK.**

Now, please feel free to ask more questions about the policy if it is unclear. Please read through the links at the top first, but if there is something that you don't understand, please ask. I'd rather have to give a lot of long winded answers than have some people accidentally spoiled.",16,36,False,self,,,,,

The solution? The three shows plans. Create three shows, one which airs on Thursday, the next on Friday, and the third on Saturday, which all focus on different aspects of the story.

Game of Thrones: War of Kings, will focus on Westeros, and the conflict between the surviving powers in the region.

Game of Thrones: Beyond the Wall, will focus on the titular region of the Northern region of the Wall and beyond.

Game of Thrones: Queen of Dragons, will focus on the region of Essos.

Since characters may move from region to region, contracts will be tied to the franchise in general and not a show in particular, in order to prevent HBO from paying one actor three salaries.

This setup allows for the focus on the events that take place in one region, since events in a singular region do not usually interfere with those in another.

Since characters may move from one region to another, and some happenings in one show may affect another, fans would be forced to watch all three shows, increasing HBO's viewership by 300%.

It's a nice plan, by my standards.",4,0,False,self,,,,,

Melisandre looked up sharply. Her tower was empty save for herself and the guards posted outside  two guarding her door, another pair at the foot of the spiraling stairway, and four posted at the entrance, all loyal servants to Rhllor, men who would give their lives without question to prevent intruders from entering this sacred place. Yet before her stood a slender figure cloaked in a deep grey, grey as the ashes of a dying flame. She had not heard a sound to suggest the strangers entrance. *So the day has come,* she thought.   


Valar dohaeris, girl, she replied. I have seen you in the flames. The men outside, you killed them. It was not a question.   


I gave them the gift, said the intruder. All men must die, but first all men must serve. They have fulfilled both, as must you.   


I see, the red woman said, amused. In this the servants of Rhllor and the Many-Faced One are alike. But do not presume to think that your god can best mine today, or for any day to come.   


There is only one god.   


And it is Rhllor! sang Melisandre in a voice resonating with truth. I have heard that the Faceless Men hide in the shadows, and are blinded in the face of light. Remember, child, the shadow can only live as long as the flame.   


No. When the candle dies, the world fills with shadows. Across the room, the false gods servant parted her lips as if to begin a prayer, and the flames in the room vanished. True to her word, the room was instantly plunged in darkness. Melisandre grew cold. *No the hearth fire, it must never be-*   


She heard the *clink* of cold steel pressed against the ruby at her throat. In the darkness, Melisandre uttered a word. She heard a sharp intake of breath from the figure at her back as the heat of the jewel disintegrated the dagger. Whirling, she grabbed the assassin by the throat and declared, Whatever your god can do, Rhllor will return a hundredfold. With that the torches in the room sprang back to being, and the hearth fire roared to life with a ferocity even she had never seen.   


As the priestess looked back at her prisoner, however, she found nothing but empty air and shadows. Wheeling, she saw the assassin beneath the shadow of a pillar across the room, flaring back her cloak to reveal a short blade as slender as its user. She drew it from its strap, and slid into a sideways stance. Melisandre laughed. How fitting, that a water dancer become a Faceless Man. And yet how strange, she thought. How had the youngest daughter of Stark, a highborn girl from Winterfell, come to join and acquire the powers of the shadowy Braavosi order?   


The girl gave her no time to think. Quick as a snake, she darted towards the priestess, Needle flashing in the torches light. Melisandre reached inside her voluminous sleeves, and tossed out a handful of glittering crimson powder. The dust crackled into a sheet of fire, blistering the air between her and the assassin. The girl disappeared from Melisandres view as the light of the blaze engulfed her vision.   


Her assailant burst through the wall of flames, whipping her burning cloak at the red womans face. As Melisandre knocked aside the flaming garment with a sweep of her arm, the girl came hurtling through the air, Needles point aimed for her heart   


A hand black as night grabbed the sword, wrenching it out of the intruders hands. Before Melisandre stood a dusky shadow of equal height holding Needle in its left hand and a black sword in its right, a shadow that seemed almost solid, and did not shift to the flicker of the torches. In the light of the flames, the red woman saw something like a glimmer of fear in the girls eyes. The priestess laughed again. It seems you can move through shadows but can you move mine?
This time, Melisandre saw the girl disappear into a shadow, and reappear once more at the far end of the room. Under her cloak she had worn clothing of an even darker shade of grey. Once again she held Needle in a water dancers stance. The priestess glanced at her shadow pets hand, and saw it empty. You wont take this from me, the girl said. The assassin muttered a word, and her slight frame rippled.   


Melisandre blinked. Where her foe had stood alone were four wraiths cloaked in the same grey fabric, their faces hidden in the folds of their hoods. Her opponents fanned out, sliding into sideways positions.   


The red woman pointed at the hearth fire, and a stream of flames shot from the furnace to her hand, crackling with heat and power. As the wraiths closed in on her, she hurled the fire at one of the figures while the priestesss shadow moved to intercept them. The conflagration engulfed one of the ghosts, while her shadow crossed blades with another with a resounding *clang*. The shadow pushed off the cloaked assailant with its sword hilt and thrust the dark blade into her stomach. A third wraith leapt at Melisandres creature and lopped off its legs at thigh and knee, bringing it down with a *crash*. In its dying throes, the shadow seized its foe by the neck and smashed her head into the stone floor. Melisandres eyes narrowed, sweeping the room as she searched for the last wraith. *To my left? To my right?*   


Behind, the girl whispered. Melisandre gasped as cold steel thrust through her back and out her chest. The sorceress fell to her knees, coughing blood. Behind her stood the real assassin, panting as she held Needle pushed into the priestesss body, its blade sheathed in red. The Many-Faced God has given you his gift, she said.   


A deep, throaty laugh filled the room.   


The only gift, little child, said the red woman as the girl watched in shock, is the gift of truth, and you shall be receiving it, not I. I gave it to that foolish maester years ago, and to countless others before him. And as she stood, Needle melted into liquid steel and oozed out of the sorceresss body. She turned to face her assassin, and said in a voice ringing with power, Now know true understanding, daughter of Stark, and with it true despair, and know that your god is powerless before Rhllor. And the girls eyes widened in fear as an inferno burst from the red witchs hands to engulf her in flames   


As she lay smoldering, Arya Starks eyes closed, and Melisandres hands wrapped around her throat. The priestess smiled. *And so another serves the Lord of Light.*   

**Hey Redditors, this is my first time posting in this subreddit, and the above is basically a chapter of fan fiction that I wrote on what I envision a duel between Arya and Melisandre would look like. I really like the duels that GRRM writes in ASOIAF (especially The Red Viper vs The Mountain, nothing will ever beat that), and I wanted to contribute something of my own to a series that I am in love with. I hope you enjoyed it!**

I want to pay for the show. I want to support the actors, creators, and George R.R Martin. Yet I'm forced to steal the show if I want to watch it without having to pay hundreds for a cable subscription.

If I were **forced to recast, I think I would choose Bran Stark.**  I know I know, sad, and unfair.  

* First, I think Isaac has done a fantastic job as Bran.  He's an amazing actor for his age.  

* Nonetheless, the problem is that **Bran was born in 291 AL; the show takes place between 298-300**.  So, Bran is between 7 and 9 years old, at the very least (he might even technically be 7 or 8 years old during season 3, if Bran has a late-year birthday/name day).  

* **Obviously, Bran is far from puberty, but Isaac is not.**  My concern is that by his final season, barring any time jumps, he'll look and sound like a *college student* posing as an 8 or 9 year old, or 10 or 11-year old at the most extreme.  The pictures from the Screen Actors Guild Awards show a really mature looking Isaac, with an adult-sized nose.

* **I guess they could start filming as many ""future"" scenes as possible, to really squeeze out as many scenes of young Isaac as possible.**  This would require a ton of planning AND moving beyond the show's pace (for example, filming *A Dance with Dragons* 

* **Whom would I cast?**  Obviously, someone much younger.  Isaac was born in 1999 -- so I'm guessing an actor born in perhaps the 2001-2003.  **Easier said than done, however.**  I'm guessing that they cast Isaac because they couldn't find a young enough actor who was good enough to portray such a meaty role.  


So, ASOIAF/GoT fans, **which character would you recast if you had a crossbow-to-your-head and absolutely had to pick a character and replace him or her with a different actor or actress?**

Jaqen clearly explains to Arya that he'll kill anyone she names.  **Why didn't she name Tywin Lannister first?**

She really could have been the deciding factor in the War, by chopping the patriarchal head off of the Lannister family.  She also had plenty of cause to kill him, since he is the head of the most vile family in the realm, a family that has produced Cersei and Joffrey.

I understand the 2nd kill, since it was made purely in haste and self-preservation.  But the first?  Shouldn't Arya have more cause to want Tywin dead than The Tickler?  Sure, the Tickler messed with Gendry, but Tywin is the head of the army that looks to crush Robb and the North.

EDIT: I realize that she tried to name Tywin as he was leaving Harrenhal, making it even more confusing as to why she didn't name him immediately.  She certainly wanted Tywin as a target, I just don't understand why she didn't do it with the first name.  It's nearly a plot hole.  ",41,6,False,self,,,,,

I have not read the books yet, however, I do plan on reading them them prior to April. 

Here is my question. It is unclear to me what the cripple stark boy's goal is. He wants to go one direction, but these other folks want him to head in another. Why does he want to go the way he does? What is that supposed to accomplish? What would happen if he went the other way? What good would that do?
At this point how aware is he, of who is dead in his family?

As an aside, I did grasp that he has learned about his special ability, and that it is apparently beyond what anybody else can do.

If I didn't post this right, please let me know.

Also, if this info was already covered in another post, please lead me to it.

I think it would just add to the WTF?! of the moment.  Also, the wording in the song seems very relevant. (Cat, over the Moon etc)

After reviewing the statistics from last year and discussing the availability of the current mods, we've decided it would be a good idea to add one or more additional moderators prior to the start of Season 4.  

We're now accepting applications, and if you'd like suggest someone else for consideration, please [let us know](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fgameofthrones), so we can invite them to submit an app.  The goal is to maintain the consistency and relative spoiler-safety the subreddit provides while the Season-surge is ongoing.

EDIT: To be clear, send your app to the mods via [modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fgameofthrones).  Don't put it in any other format/program/site.  We need to copy+paste your app into a mod thread, and we don't want to ""convert"" anything.  Keep it simple please.

----
**To apply for a moderator position with /r/gameofthrones, please answer the following questions and [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fgameofthrones) with your responses.**

So, Game of Thrones is pretty cool. You can ask most anyone and they'll probably agree.
If you aren't familiar; it's a series on HBO based on George R.R Martin's book series ""A Song of Ice and Fire"". I started reading the books long before I ever watched a single episode, and I knew absolutely nothing about the plot. Hell, just seeing the previews on television I thought Daenerys was the antagonist. Nobody stands in front of a burst of fire with that expression and isn't evil, I reasoned. Upon beginning the books, I was moved by the plight of Daenery's and her brother. This Usurper was a bad man. I imagined him as an evil knight dressed in a full suit a dark plate armour. It took a few chapters before I connected him to the portly King Robert, and he wasn't such a bad bloke. I was taken aback. I'd been rooting for Daenerys' and her cunt brother all this time. Conflicting allegiances aside, it added more humanity to the story. Of course neither the usurper nor the usurped were entirely malicious. We're not talking Sauron versus happiness and rainbows here. I was utterly befuddled that it had taken 15 years (Game of Thrones was written in 1996!) for this masterpiece to get a series when TWILIGHT got a trilogy in 3. Imagine how much more the franchise could have been milked.
Speaking of milking the franchise; Cyanide Studios has created Game of Thrones: The Roleplaying Game which was Published by Focus Home Interactive. I've never heard either of these company names before. I do, however, know of Metacritic.com where Game of Thrones: The Roleplaying game managed to score itself a 58 out of 100. 

Ouch.

Based on these numbers, I'd have never touched the title if not to quickly hurl it into a fiery pit in the center of a volcano. However, Focus Home Interactive seemed intent on having me possess it. Focus Home Interactive has scored itself a Humble Bundle. Humble Bundle is a neat charity project where developers and publishers often offer a package of their games in an effort to raise money for various charities. Any donation nets you your swag; however there are usually two items available only for people who pay above the average, which in this case happened to be 6 USD. Game of Thrones was not above this threshold. I drew the slider 100% towards charity and paid my six dollars because a friend told me to. Not for Game of Thrones, of course, I already knew what manner of trap that was. Or, rather, I didn't. While I'd read a short review (From someone who gave it a 0/10 rating) and most certainly knew what happened to people who fell for the franchise prostitutes (RIP people who bought The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct), I had no idea what the game itself was about. Seeing as I got it and more impressive titles for a fifth of the cost of Game of Thrones alone all while donating to charity I felt that I could, in good conscience, give it the old college try.

Though not without posting the experience to Reddit.

The game has been uneventful so far. Probably because I'm still in the Main Menu. The Game of Thrones theme is playing on loop, which means the music isn't entirely shit. Lets see what manner of foul demon we release when we click ""New Game"". I choose Lord difficulty of course; because if I'm going to have a bad time it may as well be REALLY bad. Lord is the highest difficulty with Knight being medium and squire being low. Don't think you can fool me with cute themes, Cyanide, I know what you're up to.
The music stops and Varys takes over as Master of Exposition, telling the story so far over a map of Westeros. The year is 297 (Or was is 298?), and it is after Robert's Rebellion. But none of that fun stuff for now. After teasing me with the prospect of killing Lannisters Varys pulls the expositon train into station at The Wall. He says something ominous about how small-bladdered men try to flee from their duties on The Wall and the screen fades to black, leaving me with text reading ""Somewhere south of the Wall"" and a button that says ""Play"". Jeez, a couple minutes in and I am already being railroaded.

It's a cutscene. A man in black with a crossbow is being chased by another hooded man in black and his pitbull. The crossbow man hides behind a tree, but apparently the other fellow's hood has some sort of sonar and he shoots a stern look at the wooden accomplice. The jig was up, and Mr.Crossbow steps out into view. His given name is Golrod, and he explains that Mr.Hood is actually Mors Westford, who seems to have embarked on this chase armed with nothing but a lecture and happy thoughts. When talking fails, Golrod makes to shoot this man who probably should be showing more emotion for someone with a crossbow pointed at his face. Of course, when Golrod hears the dog growl at him he forgets all about pulling the damned trigger, looks at the dog, mutters something smart and gets his face bitten off.

Oh, so I'm not actually playing. Apparently ""Play"" means ""Watch"" to the folks over at Cyanide. The cutscene is over. ""Chapter 1: Mors"", and then there's some backstory; punished for choosing to act with integrity in a world divided bla bla bla... ""Given the same choice as all other criminals""? ""Death or Exile""? Murderers, rapists and traitors get that choice, sure, but it's not as if everyone who's ever stolen an apple either gets shipped off to Svalbard or hanged. It sounds dramatic, but you've given me something to nitpick so ha-ha!

Apparently I, that is, Mors Westford, am returning to Castle Black after hunting down a deserter. Oh, I see. One man with a crossbow beaten by an unarmed old man and his dog. And I didn't even get to do anything. Lets click Watch again.

This time I'm at a screen that says 'Combat Style'. I can choose between one of three styles: Landed Knight which prefers a sword and shield, Hedge Knight which uses two-handed swords, and Magnar which gets a weapon in each hand. Ignoring the fact that none of those names have anything to do with fighting styles, there's not exactly a plethora of options here. I figure that will change. I pick Hedge Knight because of his badass greatsword and initially put three of my skill points in Strength and the remaining two in intelligence. Strength will boost my Damage, Critical Damage and Damage Resistance. Intelligence increased 'Energy Recovery', bargain chance and the number of skill points I get when leveling up. I reconsider and invest all five points into intelligence instead.

After this comes the skill tree. I'm a Hedge Knight, so I have to take Devestation which does damage in an area. In addition I pick up Earthquake, which interrupts enemies in an area and Headbutt which presumably has me grab the nearest meatbag and slam my Viking skull his face. Just when I think I'm done weapon talents pops up. Well, at least there's a decent character building mechanic in this. I put all ten points into swords because it gives me double value for the points like I have some kind of customer loyalty discount. It's a shame, I wanted to put them all in Axes. But wait! There's more! I can pick character traits! I go with Gifted, Bruiser and Acrobat which grant me two more skill points, 2% more damage with Two-handed weapons and +6 to deflection. It's all a bit shit considering I'm having to make all these choices without any idea of what the hell I'm doing. In addition to the good traits, I also need to cripple myself somewhat. I pick Bad Leader and Asthmatic. Bad Leader reduces damage dealt by my allies by 7%, which is good, I wouldn't want them taking all the glory. I also take Asthmatic and the 8% increase to energy cost that goes with it. I'm something equivalent to a wheezy Viking with people issues now. Lets confirm and continue.

So, Gorold is alive. Me and my scary dog have brought his ass back in ropes. We're getting a bit more perspective now. Gorold and I are supposed to be old buddies, and here I am dragging him to Jeor Mormont, the Lord Commander of the Nights Watch. Oh, a speech option? So despite not actually having control of Mors yet, I am finally playing. Sort of. Mormont thanks me for wrangling my heterosexual life-partner. It was worse than anything you could imagine, dude! My spidey-sense made it way too simple! And then out of the blue Gorold is talking about raping young boys. God dammit, Gorold.

Jeor is giving his pep talk to some new Sworn Brothers. Just to drive home the happy family message, I behead Gorold.

Finally! Out of the damned cutscenes. I pocket the Executioners axe used to kill Gorold, which is actually miles better than the sword I've got. This kicks off the next ten minutes of me going around and stealing everything not nailed down. Isn't that the sort of thing that gets you sent to the wall in the first place? In between snatching every shiny object in Caste Black I overhear a pair of Brothers talking. They're... Talking about Will, Gared, and Ser Royce. The three guys from the prologue of Book 1. Points for detail, Cyanide. Maybe this won't be all that bad. I should probably be escorting those new recruits like the Lord Commander said, but there's more stuff to steal in the common hall. Before I can empty his pockets, I'm talking to a bloke named Walder about a statuette. I learn that Mors is from an old family from the Westerlands; bannermen of House Lannister. I discover more useful things talking with Walder; there are collectibles in this game! I've already got a staute of The Warrior, and ancient relic of my house apparently, and Walder wants me to recover six other statues. I get 80 Xp just for talking to him.

I wonder how much these sell for. Oh, nothing. It's a quest item. Despite this disappointment I sell the rest of my loot to the Blacksmith, mumbling something about inheritance and wildlings and most certainly not theft, and use the money to get an even better sword. I get it for 20% off too, which means I have 6 stags to spare and a new toy to play with. I'd get something for the dog too, but the blacksmith just doesn't have any antlers made of steel.

I think I have enough booty for now, lets see about babysitting the recruits. Mors begins as any decent commander would; by kicking their asses one by one. Their maces and swords are no match for my adamantium skull. ",6,2,False,self,,,,,

Jaime steals a sword and tries to fight his captors, but he is immediately defeated and recaptured. Varys tells Tyrion how he became a eunuch, and that he now has in his power the magician who castrated him. Bran, with the aid of Jojen Reed, continues to chase the three-eyed crow. At Craster's keep, the surviving Night's Watch, starving, come into conflict with their host. Craster and the Lord Commander are slain in the struggle and Sam flees with Gilly and her son. Arya and Gendry are taken to the secret cave of the Brotherhood without Banners where they meet their leader, Beric Dondarrion, who later sentences the Hound to trial by combat with him. Theon Greyjoy is betrayed by the cleaning boy, who returns him to the prison for torture. Daenerys meets with Kraznys to complete the trade of a dragon for the Unsullied army. She tests the Unsullied, then orders them to kill their former masters, reclaims her dragon and frees the Unsullied, her new army.|

Okay, so showing Drogon bigger than he was before is fantastic and I love the fact that he's still growing... but that one scene they showed us, I am a bit concerned about. First off, let me just already come out with it and say [ADWD](#b ""I don't believe that's the shepherd's daughter on account that in the gif it looks more like a male boy, so either this isn't the scene or they cast a boy for that scene, which I have no idea why they would change it like that."")
Secondly, [ADWD](#b ""This can't be the scene of the shepherd and his daughter because, IMO, this seems way to early for something like that this season. I mean, we're finishing up book three and heading into book four. Why would they give us a scene that's only described that had occurred in book five?"")
Perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself, and I understand that [Timeline](#b ""books four and five run parallel""), but that's just what's on my mind. Any thoughts for you book readers out there?",3,0,False,self,,,,,

With Jaime in the Kingsgaurd and Tyrion on the run why would Cersei inherit it when Kevan holds no lands and would technically, as his younger brother, be Tywins heir? I understand Winterfell and Sansa because they believe all male heirs dead, but if Benjen had not joined the Nights Watch and was still alive wouldn't he have inherited Wintetfell if they truly believed all of Ned male sons dead?

Had a few simple questions now that I've gotten this far:

Firstly, and no need to answer this if it's revealed in later books, but is it ever said how Lyanna Stark actually died? Or are we supposed to infer something about her death? I know that what Ned promised her is supposed to be vague and questionable, but I'm not sure if I've just happened to have missed what actually caused her death...

Secondly, I noticed the books made Renly Baratheon like...a thousand times less gay than the tv show. There seemed to be subtle hints at his flamboyance, like Stannis' quip about Maergery being a virgin for a long time/Renly won't have a son anytime soon, and that he always dressed very fancy, but does anyone remember concrete times that GRRM really wanted us to feel that Renly was gay?

Just hoping for an open discussion about those two ideas.

I searched the sub, the net and netflix's website and I can't find an answer.

Will Game of Thrones season 3 come out on Netflix DVD? I know the DVD is coming out soon but I can't find an answer about the DVD being available on Netflix specifically (I know it will never come to streaming).

If not, is it possible to get HBO on demand and watch all of Season 3 in one month or do the purposely have not all the episodes up to watch in any given month? From the HBO's website Game of Thrones wasn't even listed in the series on demand section, unless I'm looking at the wrong thing.

I think its pretty obvious that in 3-5 years the TV show is going to catch all the way up to the books. Martin's publisher said there is no way WoW will be out before 2015. Assuming we can squeeze 3 seasons out of the Crows and Dragons books, WoW will probably be released by then but it will be 3-5 years before the last book, assuming George doesn't have to add another book to the series.  Also unless he writes at an amazing pace, gets help writting it, or just dumps story lines to get it out faster, I don't think we will be anywhere close to getting the last book by the time the show catches up with WoW.

I was thinking today of what the show could do to stall this undesirable outcome. I fear it's likely they will have to write a lot of new material themselves to either stall, or maybe even possibly come up with their own ending. But, thinking of how the story lines ends at the end of DwD, I thought it might also be possible that they stop filming for a few years, and then pick it up again once the last book has been or almost will be published.

Here is my train of thought for how they can pull it off, forgive me because I have not read the book since it came out so some character names and details have left me,


WARNING MAJOR SPOILERS FROM HERE ON



YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!


So the biggest concern is the child actors, but if they were to incorporate a time skip I think their age progression is easily explained away. For Bran and Arya, both are doing their own separate training. It could be believed that they train on their own for 2-3 years and the show can pick up from there. With Sansa, I think it's easy to believe that she could just be chilling in the Vale without much going on for a few years except Little Finger trying to finger her.

On Daenerys side, they could end the pre-little Aegon (I think that was the kids name?) getting attacked and killed by a dragon and having Daenerys Fly away.  Instead, it could have her leading her city for a few years, learning from her counselors on how to be a good queen. Tyrion would also be in the city but maybe waiting for the right time to reveal himself.
Aegon would live there as well trying to impress Daenerys.

After the time skip picks up a few years later, the events at the end of Dragon will occur, and then go from there.

Back in Westeros, Brianne will join with Stonehart and go cavorting around with him while Jamie also does his own thing. Once the time skip is over, the events at the end of Dragon will occur.

Cersei will have her trial then go to jail for the entire period of her time skip, then have the zombie mountain fight for her after the time skip.

Jon will lead the Nights watch for the years of the time skip, and then get killed in the beginning once the series gets picked back up. THen whatever happens with him in the new books will go from there.




So that was my thought process on just a few of the main characters, but there are too many to go over them all. I don't think I sold this idea very well, but think that in the hands of an HBO writer, they could make it work. The above was just one way it could be incorporated, specifically from the end of Dragons. Do you guys think something like this is even plausible, or just total hogwash?",22,3,False,self,,,,,

Okay, I was watching the new trailer thing for the new season, and for whatever reason I had a relapse of PTSD about a certain Jon Snow ADWD: getting ab-stayed by Owen-bay Arsh-may in Castle Black after Wun Wun went postal and killed Sir Patrek. 

ADWD: Well, the men of the Night's Watch stabbed Jon repeatedly while crying... THEY WOULDN'T DO THAT IF THEY WERE ANGRY. Or, perhaps, they would and I'm totally wrong. 

TWOW: So I was thinking that the Red Lady incited all of this nonsense, and told Bowen he had to kill Jon... so she could revive him and he would be free of his damned vow to the damned wall!! YES, G.R.R.M. wouldn't have gave us that first person POV of Jon's death without bringing him back. It's perfect.

After watching last season of the show, I decided that I couldn't wait another entire year for the show to come back, so I decided to read the books. I casually read AGOT, but I've flown through ACOK and can't seem to put it down. I'm about 100 pages from finishing. With the show starting in April, if I love ASOS as much as ACOK, I'm thinking I'll be done right as the new season is starting. So my question is, do you guys think I should postpone watching the 4th season until I finish AFFC?

I was thinking about Game of Thrones and what sort of things would be going on right now in the story that we might not see. One thing stood out in my opinion. Looking for more dragon eggs. I don't know if the 3 eggs were the last ones. Does the book or series say they are? But the last ones are rarely really the last. Most of the time some guy has one hidden somewhere.
I mean if I was living somewhere in that world and I had time and money I would spent a little bit of it looking for dragon eggs. Word is out that dragons do exist so if you have one or a few or know where to find some it would be the right thing to do if you want power or money.
So my question is, is someone looking for eggs right now? Maybe book readers have an answer."")

I figured there's no harm in doing so. However, if it would contain spoilers somehow by doing so, I'd obviously rather not.

I ask this in part because I want to stay ahead of the show, and also want to watch season 4 having read everything that's taking place, but I've heard there are elements of both AFFC and ADWD. So if I was switching between the books, I may stay ahead of the show entirely......

Or feel free to let me know if I should just wait till I finish all the books, in order, to even bother watching season 4.

Watching a documentary on Roman Britain earlier today, I was struck by not only the seeming similarities of not only the map/topology, weather, slight similarities between the dress of Roman soldiers in Britain and Brothers of the Night's Watch, even the word ""wildling"" is said with the sort of disdainful tone that you can imagine a Roman referring to the ""barbarians"" of the north. This got me thinking - could this have been a bit of GRRM's real-life inspiration for The Wall? Has anyone ever seen this mentioned?

Even the maps of Westeros 

&gt; http://gameofthrones.net/resources/50-maps-of-westeros/399-map-of-the-political-boundaries.html 

And Britain

&gt; http://www.ezilon.com/maps/europe/united-kingdom-maps.html

That would make Daenerys and Robert only removed by one (or two?) generation! Their grandparents would have been siblings!! And I think that would also mean they all have a living great uncle Aemon! :o

Is this why all the Baratheons claim to have such high rights to the throne?? I always thought it was just because of Robert's Rebellion. And that Stannis and Renly knew about Cersei and Jamies whole deal..

I'm partway through A Clash of Kings and noticed that Theon is calling himself a prince. What exactly is he a prince of at this point? I'm on page 278 of the paperback if that's any help. Also, when he arrives at the Iron Islands has he already planned to betray Robb or is that yet to come? Feel free to spoil up until the books equivalent of season 3 but try to not spoil anything past that unless it's relevant, which I can't imagine it would be at this point.

With the help of Littlefinger, the Lannisters discover the Tyrells' plot to marry off Sansa Stark to Loras Tyrell. To prevent the union, Tywin Lannister plans to marry Sansa to Tyrion, and Cersei to Loras, despite Cersei and Tyrion's protests. Stannis confesses to his wife, Selyse, about his infidelity, only to realize that his wife has always known and approves it. His daughter, Shireen, sneaks into the dungeon to visit Davos and teaches him to read. The Hound defeats Lord Beric in trial by combat and is released. Gendry decides to stay with the Brotherhood, and Thoros and Beric plan to ransom Arya Stark to her brother, Robb Stark. After being delivered to Roose Bolton, Jaime confesses to Brienne why he killed the Mad King. At Riverrun, despite many objections, Robb Stark decides to execute Lord Karstark after he murdered two captive Lannister boys. With the Karstarks abandoning him, Robb plans to make a desperate alliance with Walder Frey. Jon Snow struggles to earn the Wildlings' trust while holding back the important information. Later, he and Ygritte have sex. While on the march, Daenerys Targaryen's Unsullied select Grey Worm as their leader.|

I was wondering what are everybody's thoughts on how Tryrion will kill her in the show since the Hand's Chain isn't in the show (at least not yet). If they don't somehow introduce it, I think it would be an awesome alternative if Tyrion stabbed her with the Hand's pin.

I'd like to see it if someone uses it, and credit for the idea is always nice.

It begins with Jaime showing off Oathkeeper to, I don't know, Cersei. Now, if you remember, Oathkeeper was made from House Stark's Valyrian steel sword Ice, which was melted down to forge two longswords for Jaime and Joffrey, and Ice was last in possession by Eddard, who is now dead.

Cersei asks how it's different from any other sword. Jaime says that it's made of Valyrian steel. Cersei remarks on this, saying ""Where'd they get the Valyrian steel for the sword?""

Jaime comments, ""From Ned.""

""Who's Ned?"" says Cersei. (I am fully aware that Cersei knows who Eddard Stark is, the whole kingdom knows him. But for the joke's sake, let it go.)

""Ned's dead baby,"" says Jaime. ""Ned's dead.""

I was wondering if you think of what could be added to the TV show that was not in the books, or maybe was in the books differently.  George RR martins world is so vast with it's own history, culture and languages that I feel like the TV show could add things without it seeming like empty padding.

Jamie - Since he's in King's Landing before the big wedding, I think he can interesting conversations with people still in King's Landing.  Sansa and Oberyn in particular.

Brienne - I feel like she can be used as a POV to show the ruins of the Riverlands.  I don't think the show has shown that part where Tywin briefly mentions ordering setting the riverlands on fire and the devastation it causes.  They can even make a subplot of brienne being hunted by vengeful riverlanders against anyone who represents the lannisters.

Bran - If he starts being able to control his visions, he might be able to see many of the Dream sequences in the books that were cut from the TV show.  Also him learning about the fate of his family through these visions could make a very dramatic scene.

These are just a few ideas I had.  Wondering what you guys think and if there are other ideas out there.

Also, I don't really have the time to read all the books before season 4 starts, so would it be smart to start reading where season 3 left of or maybe during that time?

If that isnt what you were expecting,  GET OUT NOWWWW! 


**Four popular quotes from the show / books about Stannis:**

1.
""These pardoned lords would do well to reflect on that. Good men and true will fight for Joffrey, wrongly believing him the true king. A northman might even say the same of Robb Stark. But these lords who flocked to my brothers banners knew him for a usurper. They turned their backs on their rightful king for no better reason than dreams of power and glory, and I have marked them for what they are. Pardoned them, yes. Forgiven. But not forgotten""

2.
I shall bring justice to Westeros. A thing Ser Axell understands as little as he does war.. Celtigar must pay the traitor's price himself, in his own person. And when I come into my kingdom, he shall. Every man shall reap what he has sown, from the highest lord to the lowest gutter rat. And some will lose more than the tips off their fingers, I promise you. They have made my kingdom bleed, and I do not forget that""

3.
""I have always served thieves according to what they deserve, as you well know Ser Davos.  They are all thieves. They will bend the knee or I will destroy them.""

4.
Stannis Baratheon: The Iron Throne is mine. By right. All those that deny that are my foes. 

Renly Baratheon: ""The whole realm denies it from Dorne to the Wall. Old men deny it with their death rattle and unborn children deny it in their mothers' wombs. No one wants you for their king. ""

Baratheon Words:
Ours is the Fury


**So here is a fun question:**

What happens when winter comes, and the northerners would prefer to hunker down and protect what is theirs, instead of marching south into war to pursue Stannis's claim to the iron throne?  What happens when Renly's final jab to Stannis rings true in his mind? What does he do next?

Tyrion at the small council is mocked for believing in the white walkers. Surely if Alliser Thorne had turned up it would have been more than satisfactory evidence that everyone's attention is focused the wrong way. 

Am I missing something, or did he just disappear?

(I'm in the process of reading the books, so I'm unaware of what happens so far)

The city that it was flying over looked remarkably like King's Landing, right? [Here's the video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZY43QSx3Fk) for reference, it's at the very beginning.

Now, I'm normally just a GoT watcher, but I occasionally do read ahead in the wikis because I don't care about certain things being spoiled (NOT AN OPENING TO TELL ME ALL OF THE SPOILERS, HOWEVER). But I'm pretty sure that, through my wiki readings, I haven't read about a dragon at King's Landing in ASOS. 

So, am I wrong in thinking that the city in the video is King's Landing? It looks incredibly like it. Is it a dream that someone has, perhaps? Or, are the show's creators taking a completely different direction? Any input? What do you think?

And you have to imagine the last book will take 5+ years to finish. That puts the books to end around 2021.

Assuming the books out will take 3 more years and maybe WoW will be split into two seasons, that's 2018. All signs are the book will be out by then. Then even if they split the last book into 2 or 3, it is still very likely that the final book won't be released by then. 

But anyway, the way I watch the show now is I think about how this and that is different or the same as the book. The more I think about it, it won't make that much of a difference if that's reversed. And it will make the wait way more bearable. Plus it won't be exact so there will be 2 versions of the same thing, which makes for an interesting dynamic. 

Through interviews I've seen Martin complaining that the show killed certain characters and whatnot, so I get the impression he's gonna try to motherfuck the show by the last couple books. So it will just be 2 separate entities and it will be fun to watch. So honestly, I used to stress about the show outpacing the books, but now I don't mind so much. 

Oh, I forgot a few things. Okay so I'm happy that we'll at least get the ending sooner and also (sorry to be gloomy) but a lot of the actors a very old on the show, so I fear something happening to them before the series is over. I know they completely wrote Illyn Payne out of the show, don't know if they aren't willing to recast in any situation so that is a worry for me. ",20,0,False,self,,,,,

He said he watched one episode and thought it was the stupidest thing in the world. My friends and I tried to say, ""Dude... but you have no idea what it's even about in the slightest!"" No good. He hates it. Okay, fine.

Then I met someone else the other day who said he watched the whole first season, and he says he was disappointed because it wasn't what he expected. ""It wasn't like Lord of the Rings,"" he said.

I don't know if I'm too invested, or what, but hearing these things gets a rise out of me I can't explain. And it totally diminishes their credibility in taste for shows. That same guy in the latter example told me, ""We're going to hang out this weekend, and I'm going to sit you down, and force you to watch American Horror Story."" Now, I've actually heard good things about American Horror Story. I'm sure it's a great show. But coming from him... It's like all the other things I've heard about the show go out the window. ""Oh, you like AHS but you don't like GoT? So AHS must be mediocre then, is that it?"" 

Why am I like this?! 

To be clear, I've read the whole book series through. I've gone back and re-read certain chapters. I've re-watched the whole series at least twice. I've heard all the tin-foil theories (mind your spoilers in the comments, reminder). I've also enjoyed The Sopranos, The Wire, the first four seasons of Dexter, Breaking Bad, Weeds, Extras, Hello Ladies, The Black Mirror, Shameless, Sherlock, Skins, Peep Show etc. etc. etc... But none of them compare to the level of foreshadowing, detail, or intellectual entertainment which Martin offers. Not the ones which aren't already finished, anyway. I mean, am I a moth whose flown too close to the light? This is just unhealthy, I say...

UNHEALTHY!!!

My thoughts are this, we know that Cersei sent Robert out on the hunt and gave Lancel the strongwine that ended up getting him killed. Cersei did this so that she could rule as Queen Regent via Joffrey. And if she was ruling she would have had the power to overrule Joffrey and make sure that Ned did not lose his head. Also, Ser Ilyn was already there on the spot with Ice in hand ready to do the deed (indicating it was planned, why else would they have the executioner there?). We also see that [AFFC](#b ""Tommen doesn't really do anything other than sign/stamp royal documents/decrees and there really isn't that much of an age difference is there?"").

 So was the whole wall thing just a cover story so that she could paint Joffrey as the bad guy since it is more excusable for a boy to do something stupid than the Queen? There are other examples in the series and books that show Cersei willing to do anything to hold on to the power that she has attained.

**Trivia**  
* HOW IS NED SO HIGH? Well, many reasons. A) There were far fewer characters total in Season 1, so on average the main characters got a lot more focus (twelve people had at least 100 lines, while in Season 3 only four people did); B) Ned was a real lead who never missed episodes, whereas most other characters frequently miss multiple every season (Shae was in all three seasons but only six more episodes than Ned); C) Ned averaged a whopping 34 lines per episode, whereas most main characters average 8-15ish...if you do the math, it takes awhile for them to catch that (he got 77 in one episode once, and more than 40 in four more episodes, which is very rare for people who aren't Tyrion); D) Ned had a major storyline in pretty much all his episodes (often 10+ scenes), while some major characters like Bran, Littlefinger, Varys, Theon, and sometimes even Jon and Robb often just get one scene in a number of episodes, which takes awhile to accumulate; E) his high ranking isn't that crazy because you can tell a bunch of people will surpass him during Season 4.  
 *Most lines in an episode: Ned, with 77 in ""The Wolf and the Lion"".  
 *Most times 1st place in an episode: Tyrion (9) followed by Ned (6).  
 *Most times 2nd place in an episode: Tyrion (7) followed by Robb (3).  
 *Most times 3rd place in an episode: Jon and Arya (4 each).  
 *Highest lines-per-episode average: Ned (34.1), followed by Tyrion (27.8), Davos (18.5), Robert (16.7), and Daenerys (15.3).  
 *Most lines by a one-episode character: Mero (17 in ""Second Sons"").  
 *Most lines by a guest star: Osha (124).  
 *Fewest lines by a credited regular: Khal Drogo (46).  
 *Least prominent character to get 1st place in an episode: Ramsay Snow (20 lines in ""The Climb"").  
 *With deleted scenes included, Tywin would rise to 3rd place in Season 3 (making the top 3 all Lannister men), and 13th place overall.  
 *Tyrion has been in the most episodes (28), followed by Arya (27), Cersei (27), Daenerys (25), and Catelyn (25).  
 *Tyrion has the most lines in season premieres (82) and season finales (66).
 *Only Tyrion and Daenerys make the top 5 for every season. Arya, Jon, Robb, and Cersei make the top 10 for every season.

I know that some of these may sound far-fetched, but these are just my theory on whats going to happen in relation to some of our surviving Starks.








SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT









So let me lay down some foundation background stuff for what I'm talking about.

1. Ah yes, Poor Ned. Now, I'm sure you remember the finding of the direwolves, the dead direwolf in the snow with the antler in its side. Shortly after this, Ned confessed his belief that the Seven had no power and he didn't believe in omens, as he laughed off his wife's suggestion that the antler was a bad omen. Well, King Robert showed up and dragged him off to King's Landing. And one of the first things that is mentioned on Stark's arrival is Baelor's Sept, the proclaimed greatest house of worship to the Seven in all Westeros. My alarm bells went off at that point, and my worst fears were confirmed a couple of hundred pages later when Ned grew a foot shorter on the very steps of Baelor's Sept.

2. The Stark's luck when it comes to family traits. Honour and being blinded by their love for those close to them and the role it plays in the downfall of their family. Honour gets Ned killed, nuff said. But the love bit is interesting. Catelyn's ""I do for love"" unfortunately plays a major role in her own death and the death of her son. Her action in capturing Tyrion due to the grief she has over Bran's fall and near death experiences with the assassin throws Westeros into war. Her releasing of Jaime removed a much needed bargaining chip from Robb's hand and threw his bannermen into disarray, resulting in him losing the loyalty of some of his bannermen. And her passing on of this trait to Robb, who foolishly chose to overlook the consequences his actions would have on the Freys in marrying the Non-Frey wife. Catelyn's own love for Robb also blinded her of the same consequences, leading to both Robb's death as well as her own.

3. Robb's foreseen death: Now, in Daenerys' visit to Qarth, you may remember her visiting the Palace of the Undying to ask the Undying for assistance. Apart from the ""Three heads, Three betrayals"" prophecy, do you remember one of the visions she saw in one of the doors? A feast of the dead, and at the head of this table, A king with a GREY WOLF'S HEAD AND AN IRON CROWN. Ring any bells? And so Prophecy becomes involved.

4. Jojen's green dream's and Bran. The winged wolf with three eyes, chained down and unable to fly. This green-dream leads Bran to begin developing his warg abilities and the finding of his mentor, once again laying down this prophecy pattern, as well as a distinct pattern between the fates of the direwolves and the Stark children.

So, running with this pattern let me lay down a couple of doozies (these probably seem a bit far fetched, but bear with me).

1. Nymeria, Arya's direwolf. Stories are regularly heard following their separation of a great direwolf leading a large wolf pack throughout Westeros, whose boldness and savagery has never been seen before. Arya's involvement with the Faceless men and her training under them is there for all to see. The wolves have become more deadly and bold in their actions under the leadership of Nymeria, and so too will the Faceless Men under Arya. Arya will become some form of Guildmaster of the Faceless Men.

2. Sansa's fate (I will admit straight off the bat, quite a few of my friends thought I was stretching it a bit with this one). her wolf, Lady, was put down at the hands of one who loved her to repent for the actions of one of her absent brethren. So too will Sansa follow this fate. Due to either Arya or Jon Snow's actions (I'll explain Jon's in a second) Sansa will be executed by one who loves her (Possibly Littlefinger, but maybe someone else?).

3. Jon Snow and the silent dangers. Jon's wolf Ghost has never howled, and is renowned for its ability to silently appear and disappear throughout the book and, as such, is an incredibly dangerous enemy, as you won't hear or see him till its too late. He is also the outcast of the litter, and the only white one of the litter. As I see it, Ghost is the embodiement of Jon Snow, and as such, Snow (Or Targaryen, whichever you know him as) is the hidden danger to Westeros. Jon Snow now has the freedom to leave the Wall (If he's resurrected by Melisandre as many people believe will happen), and its also a common theory that Melisandre has actually chosen Jon as The Champion of the Light to wield Lightbringer, not Stannis. With Mesilandre's support, Jon could very much become the new power in the North. But is the R'hllor religion what it seems to be? A God who apparently symbolizes purity and cleansing and light, but has followers trained in necromancy, who slowly remove the personalities and capabilities of their thralls when resurrected (Remember lord Beric Dondarrion, and the husk he has become due to Thoros' repetitive resurrections)? Shadow-spells and human sacrifices (The death of Renly and Davos' experience at Storm's End beneath the wall, and The burning of the Horn of Winter and Rattleshirt)? Communicating through fire? R'hollor is not who Melisandre says he is. Melisandre is from Asshai, which is known to be bordered by lands simply known as the Shadowlands, and is believed to be ""Under the Shadow"". What is casting ""The Shadow""? Or, more to the point, What is ""The Shadow""? I believe it is the same thing that caused the Doom in Valyria, the same thing that the followers of the Light are now unwittingly worshipping. A demon. And Jon Snow will be its Champion.",2,9,False,default,,,,,

This series is here to help the audience of the show gain a deeper understanding of the world surrounding the characters.

Now as we are still just over a month out from the start season 4, I wont be going into things covered in a particular episode, but delving into a topic of my choosing.  So for the next few weeks I will be covering in several parts the history of the Targaryen Dynasty.  These posts will expand upon a post I made during the season last year, which can be found [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1f5w2p/all_show_the_targaryen_dynasty_reference_guide/) .  While that post did cover every Targaryen ruler and a brief paragraph explaining his rule, I wish with this mini-series to go more into the history and happenings during the time each king ruled. I wish to get through the entire history before the start of season 4. I hope you enjoy.

- Note on spoiler scope:  Most of this mini-series of posts will be marked ""no spoilers"" as it will mainly consist of general backstory/history.  However later installments will consist of some spoilers of the novellas that George has written, when those come however I will appropriately note it. Now onto the show..

**- Aegon I: before and after his conquest**

  Aegon I is probably the most prominent figure in Westerosi history. As the figure who united the various kingdoms of the continent into one, and establishing his house as the ruling family of Westeros for nearly 3 centuries.  And there are tons of information on Aegon as well as his sister/wifes Visenya and Rhaneys Targaryen, and their dragons Vhagar, Meraxes, and Balerion the black Dread. Unfortunately there is little information on Aegon that does not pertain to his conquest, which has been thoroughly covered, and does not bear repeating here.  So for this section I wish to talk about some of the history prior to the conquest, and speculate on what was likely to have happened during his near 40 year reign as the first King of Westeros. 

  Aegon prior to his invasion was the ruler of Dragonstone, the westernmost, and only remaining outpost of the former Valyrian freehold following the Doom of Valyria a century prior to his conquest, and the only remaining family of Dragonlords to survive the mysterious cataclysm that befell the once great empire.  While on Dragonstone, in the east the former Valyrian colony of Volantis was urging House Targaryen for aid in an attempt to restore the freehold by re-taking the free cites by force.  The Targaryens ignored Volantis' request for assistance, and when Aegon himself became the ruler of Dragonstone, joined in alliance against Volantis and their wish to reform the freehold.  It was after this that Aegon set his sights on Westeros and landed on the shores of the continent with his dragons thus beginning his conquest.

   After Aegon succeed in uniting all of Westeros under one banner, there is very little known of his actual reign, which lasted for 37 years.  But we do know he established most of the practices surrounding the royal family that exist in our current story.   We know his alleged half-brother Orys defeated the Storm King, wed his daughter and formed house Baratheon, becoming the lords of Storms End.  Aegon I established the office of ""Hand of the King"" and gave the office to Orys Baratheon.  The calendar of Westeros was constructed which made the year of his landing in Westeros the first year of the calendar.  He established Wardenships to former kings or newly up-jumped lords in Westeros.  The order of the Kingsguard was formed, and Aegon adopted the religion of the Andals, the faith of the seven.  King's Landing was named the capital of his new country and construction of the Red Keep had begun, it would not be completed however until the reign of his second son Maegor however.  And then he ruled, we do not know what he did during those years, but I would think that, without a permanent home that he traveled, getting to know his kingdom and help rebuild the lands his conquest had destroyed, thus establishing loyalty to house Targaryen through the land.  He had children, two sons that we know of for sure, one by each of his wives and both future Kings.. And then Aegon died, by as of yet unknown causes.  His eldest son Aenys I ascended to the throne.  

**- The Faith challenges the Throne**

  With the Conquerer dead, it was time for the second King of Westeros, Aenys I Targaryen to take his father's seat, however this was not only met with trepidation as Aenys was considered weak compared with his father, but with outright and violent conflict.  Conflict, not with any noble house of Westeros but by the church.  

   Prior to the conquest and during early Targaryen dynasty, the Faith of the Seven was a fully armed and outfitted organization due to a branch of the faith known as the ""Faith Militant"" who challenged Aenys' ascension due to Aenys being born of incest.  Aenys mother as you may or may not know was Aegon I's sister/wife Rhaenys Targaryen.  The following uprising lasted a decade and would later be known as the ""Faith Militant Uprising"".  Aenys struggled to deal with the issue thus the majority of the opposition to the faith was left to his Hand of the King, and half-brother Maegor.  The conflict lasted the duration of Aeny's reign and beyond... 

Before we move on to the final section a brief note on the ""Faith Militant"".  This branch of the faith is also sub-divided into two branches as well, first being the ""Warrior's Sons"", made up of knights who renounce land and inheritance in service of the Seven; vowed to protect the faith.  The next being the ""Poor Fellows"" which acted as armed foot soldiers who acted as protectors of innocents on the roads.  In battle they would be lead by the Warrior's sons.  

  

**- The Cruelty of Maegor I**

   Maegor I had already gained notoriety while serving as hand of the King under his half brother as a ruthless and bloodthirsty warrior.  His opposition to the Faith Militant was heinous.   He was known for offering bounties of a gold dragon and a silver stag for the scalp of a Warrior's son or a Poor Fellow respectively, earning him his moniker Maegor ""The Cruel"".  His prowess on the battlefield was noted by his brother during Aenys' reign and was bestowed with the Targaryen sword ""Blackfyre"" 

Maegor's cruelty was expanded upon when he ascended to the throne upon the death of his half-brother in 42AL and ahead of his nephew Jaehaerys.  The reason for Maegor taking the throne ahead of Aenys' rightful heir is unknown.  During Maegor's reign he married many times keeping even a few at any one time, yet he never had any children of his own.  Construction of the Red Keep was finished and Maegor in appreciation had the workers and architects killed to protect the castle's secrets.  ""Maegor's Holdfast"" where the royal apartments are kept in the castle is named for him.  All the while the faith continued to oppose him.  Maegor established what is still known as ""Maegor's Law"" which forbade holy men from bearing arms forcing the Warrior's Sons, and the Poor Fellow's to lay down their arms.  Despite all the effort Maegor went through in opposing the Faith Militant, he never fully was able to cull the resistance, and died while sitting the Iron Throne in 48 AL.  As he had no children of his own, he was succeeded by his nephew Jaheaerys I Targaryen.....





....and that's where we end for this installment, join us next time where we will cover a 60 year peace and two different debates of succession.

Now that I'm at the fourth book, I feel like it is nothing like where the third season left off. 

**[Spoilers]** The differences that I've noticed in just a few chapters: 

* Apparently Joffrey was poisoned by an unknown suspect (I'm assuming it was Littlefinger), and now Tommen is king. Nothing even close to this happened in the third season. Oh, and he didn't marry the Tully girl, though it happened early in the season.

* Lord Tywin and Shae were killed, and Tyrion is locked up. 

* Sansa escaped (I'm guessing she left with Littlefinger, though in the shows, she ended up marring Tyrion and refused Littlefinger's offers.)



* Jon is suddenly the commander of the Watch, even though he deserted them in season 3. 

I'm very lost. Was season 3 really this different from the third book, or is it supposed to be this way? ",2,1,False,default,,,,,

The books I realistically don't know how Martin would do it. Not saying he can't but like there are some events in Westeros history that don't necessarily warrant a whole book but are still too long to be a short-story. However this is why I feel the TV format would be so perfect. The show would have some cool title like ""Tales of Westeros"" or something like that.  And Some events could really be chronicled by 1 episode or there could be multi-part episodes using a variety of actors. The episodes wouldn't need clever titles as many historical events have titles. They could delve into the first men. Roberts Rebellion, The Greyjoy rebellion, Aegons landing, or old valariya which would make me squeal in joy. Like frankly speaking I love everything to do with ASOIF/GOT. Like my obsession is disgusting and honestly in all of westeros history there are some far more exciting times than the present. I mean the feeling that must have come with Aegon burning everything in sight is more horrifying to me than actually seeing what we see in the show and read in the novels. Just faint recollections of the mad king seem more terrifying than anything we've seen and I feel we as fans deserve to see a real depiction of the incredible history of westeros.

There's an attractive theory that he's a faceless man and possibly Jaqen H'gar, but can someone clue me in on that theory and any other non-preposterous/tinfoil theories?

I noticed that when Syrio first meets Arya, he repeatedly calls her, ""boy,"" despite Ned obviously hiring him to teach his ""daughter.""

Then, when Jaqen is in his cage, he tries to get Arya's attention by repeatedly calling out to her, ""boy, boy!""  

Things were chaotic during the time of Ned's execution.  I'd like to think that Syrio survived but was placed in the black cells for eventual execution, but then he killed another prisoner and took on his identity in order to escape via recruitment for the Night's Watch.  It would also make it a bit of a tidy explanation as to why the two rather-dangerous criminals (one of them a biter) locked up with him are scared of Jaqen -- they saw Syrio kill the old Jaqen and use some sort of magic to take on hiis identity.  Perhaps they fear that Jaqen could kill them next.

But today when I first opend AFFC I was very disappointed that it is apparently different from the previous books, and lacks some of fans' favorite POV-characters like Jon, Tyrion, mostly Arya and of course Dany. Instead it intruduces little beloved Cersei and Brienne...
So i wondered if I could just skip that book and read ADWD which takes place at the same time. Or maybe only read the chaptors of minor POV-characters and then rush to the next book. What do those who have already read all the books think about the idea?

In the episode prior to the Red Wedding (S03E08) towards the end when Jamie comes back to get Brienne, him and Roose Bolton are having a conversation before Jamie leaves on a horse. I'm not sure exactly how the conversation goes but at the end Roose tells Jamie he is going to The Twins and it's known that the Starks will be there too, then Jamie says ""Tell them the Lannister's send their regards.""

Petyr Baelish is like a selfish conspirator that seeks to rule the seven kingdoms. His ""Chaos is a ladder"" monologue and how he persuaded Lysa Arryn to kill John Arryn show that he is willing to start trouble to get where he wants to be.

In contrast, Varys is also an instigator of conspiracies but he does so in order to restore things away from chaos and into the old order. This is evident in the Epilogue of ADWD where he kills Kevan Lannister to facilitate the return of the Aegon Targaryen to the throne.

Also If I'm not mistaken, Arya has a chapter in AGOT where she is crawling in the Red Keep's spy holes and she happens to overhear that Ned Stark should be executed. She sees a person with a forked yellow beard in the shadows. Later in ADWD we find out that Varys and Illyrio Mopatis (the person whose physique fits Arya's description) had been plotting to return Aegon to Westeros. Varys may have the one that told Joffrey to kill Ned (Cersei had admitted that she did not know that this was to happen).

Anyhow, these are my thoughts. What do you guys think?",10,10,False,self,,,,,

Coldhands will meet Bran's party beyond the wall, or not be met at all, since he never rescued Sam and Gillie before they met Bran at the Nightfort.
2. New circumstances in which Barristan exposes Jorah's past betrayal, since in the books Daeny didn't know who Barristan was by this point and he did upon revealing his name.
3.  In the show, Jaime and Brienne returned to King's Landing before the royal wedding, so that whole sequence has been shuffled around.
4.  In the books Tywin never proposed to wed Loras to Cersei, and Loras was in the Kingsguard when Jaime returned.  Maybe Loras will not join the Kingsguard in the show at all?
5. Shae's character is way more developed in the show, and she seems to genuinely love Tyrion in the show... will they construct new events in the show to make the book's upcoming turns seem more sensible?  (I think yes.  I think the show will show Cersei work Shae over and break her.)
6. In the show, Yara (Asha in the books) sets out to rescue Theon.  This is a major break from the book and makes me wonder how she will make it to the Kingsmoot, or whether the whole Greyjoy family story will be rearranged.

Anything else I missed?

I can't do it. I don't think I'll be able to continue if I read book one. Does this format follow? Was the TV show a word for word recreation of the first book? If so, where/when/what should I start reading to avoid losing my interest or getting distracted by the replay of everything I've seen?

I was told, by a friend, to consider picking up book two and starting there. She said it was still pretty close to the show, but there were subtle changes that I'd pick up on. Figured I'd fish for other opinions before picking up another book.

I thought nothing of it at the time but as time went by I realised I wanted to see if he was just a craven after all. So I start the quiz off with an easy question and asked him ""Who is Daenerys Targaryen?"". Easy enough right? As I studied him for a few seconds he began to give me a confused look which I thought was him trying to access that stupid brain of his and answer the question. I was wrong, he not so promptly said to me ""There is no such character"". I was stunned, my vision started to fade and the sound of his voice slowly decreased to a mumble as I exited reality to try and find an answer to this now titled ""Cravens"" stupidity.

Let's say that R+L is in fact true. A lot of people believe Jon to be the fruit of this union. Here's my theory. Jon was not the only child born of this union. He is, in fact, a twin. 

One twin born with the features of a Stark (Ice) and one born with the distinct features of a Targaryen (Fire). 

Jon was easy to hide away, Ned, who loved his sister more than his honor, took Jon and claimed him as his own bastard. However a child resembling Rhaegar would stand out in Winterfell and would win him no favors with Robert.

Thus I believe that Rhaegar gave the second twin to his trusted friend Jon Connington to raise. 

I propose that Gregor Clegane did, in fact, dash little Aegon's head in. However this was Aegon, the child of Rhaegar and Elia. 

To give the bastard Aegon a clean claim on the Iron Throne the story was concocted about Varys finding a commoner to take the place of the doomed child. 

Per the wiki Jon was born 283 AL and Aegon (Griff) was born 282 AL, close enough to be a lie to make Griff seem like Elia's Aegon.

This also leave us with 3 blooded Targaryens running around in our world. The 3 headed dragon, if you will. ",9,0,False,self,,,,,

Which characters do you think are ""safe"" from death, at least for the next few seasons? (Let's say season 5, which is probably around the end of what's been published/the fifth book.)

For me, I have to go with Jon Snow, Arya, Tyrion, and Dany. I just can't see these characters that have huge storylines and tons of airtime centered on them being killed off. When Ned was killed, it at least opened the door for other characters to take the spotlight, but I'm not sure that can happen with these characters. Though I'm sure I'm in for quite the surprise.

Everyone else, they're all fair game as far as I'm concerned. Feel free to mention which characters you think are sure to get the ax in the next few seasons as well.

Bare with me for this is my first post, and my first post shall contain a huge spoiler. If you've gotten this far and haven't read through Book 3 then please stop now.

Okay, for whomever is left and is interested, here is what I have been mulling over in my head. I recently thought out a script for a scene in the up-and-coming season 4, and I thought I would share it with you all to get your thoughts. It specifically has to do with the ending in Book 3 regarding Lady Stoneheart. 

[Scene - Outside, Overcast Fall day where a field meets a changing tree line/ N.Ireland Set] 

Slow establishing shots of horses legs, some knights at attention

*Music of King In The North subtly starts to play* 

Tight shot of noose falling into frame over a branch on a tree

Rope is then dropped around a hooded mans neck, then we are shown a shot of Thoros of Myr letting the audience know it is the BWB

*Music Picks Up, Hood is removed*

Merret Frey is revealed to the audience, and he frantically begins to plead his case. Claiming he had nothing but a small part in the Red Wedding.

BWB (Thoros?) Proceeds to claim that there is a witness, Merrett denies it.

*Music Reaches its Crescendo*

Slow Tilt-Up shot reveals a hooded woman in gray as she puts her hands to her Hood. Shot back to Merrett for dramatization, and back to Gray Woman revealing she is Lady Stoneheart with a large gash on her neck.

*Music continuing as the knights finish up the noose*

Merrett is in shock and begins to mutter, Shot back to Thoros looking at Lady Stoneheart, She knods in approval to hang him. Merrett drops with a low shot showing his twitching feet. 

Final shot is a Long slow tight zoom into Lady Stonehearts gray, cold face eventually it gets so tight the struggling and shaking body of Merrett Frey is in the reflection of her gray eyes.

Episode 4...The last ten minutes this episode proved that one shows fourth episode is another shows season finale. It was one fiery hell of a capper to an hour largely about
secret dealings, betrayals, and some big slices of humble pie served to Lannisters. 

""Dracays""

More information inside,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1z2582/all_books_im_looking_into_designing_a_wine_from/,MadHatterHugo,1393475656,"I'll apologise now for potential grammar and spelling mistakes.

* *potential apologies* * 

Hey there guys! I'm currently studying and have been given a project to design a brand of wine for one of my projects. We have quite a lot of creative freedom at my university so I've decided to design a wine from the GOT universe primarily because I'm a big fan of the books and series and secondly because personally I don't find wine very interesting, so it seems appropriate to bring it into a spectrum that I'm passionate about. 

As you'll all surely be aware of, alcohol plays a rather symbolic role in George's universe and comes in a wide range of forms. From Myrish Fire Wine to the esteemed Arbor Gold, wine is used to pledge allegiances, make threats and is utilised as a tool to establish wealth and geographical location. 

With this project I have the potential to design an existing wine from the GOT universe or implement my own into the current or future plot. I have a couple ideas and would really enjoy hearing what other people think and would like to see in terms of anything from potential wine theories and backstories, characters involved, labeling to bottle shapes, wine ingredients and flavour! Is it poisonous? Will it be used to kill a main character? Anything you might be interested in adding, I'd be happy to hear. I have a couple of notions about what I might do -one that is a little far fetched and involving Brynden Tully- and I'd be love to open those up to discussion too if this gets any intention. 

If there's any interest I could post the final outcomes of my work and list you guys in my research and tell you guys how it all goes, so long as I'm brave enough to post my final product haha. 

Cheers guys!  ",7,8,False,self,,,,,

So I've just finished reading *A Song of Ice and Fire* (that was a great four months) but I'm just after some clarification from those who have also finished the books.

When [ADWD](#b ""Varys kills Kevan Lannister, he claims it is because Kevan has undone what Cersei has planned for Westeros and the Seven Kingdoms."")

Can you clarify [ADWD](#b ""of what exactly Cersei is doing that Varys approves? I *think* it may be the whole Lannister v Tyrell thing,"") but I'm not sure.

I hope I haven't just confused myself. :P

Also, [ADWD](#b ""I'm so glad those white ravens finally arrived!"")

Thanks!",16,8,False,self,,,,,
