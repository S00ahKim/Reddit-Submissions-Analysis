9,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2014-7-1,2014,7,1,10,29iw44,self.gameofthrones,[Spoilers S04] My suggestion for GoT fans while they wait for next season: watch some Shakespeare. It may satisfy your addiction a bit.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/29iw44/spoilers_s04_my_suggestion_for_got_fans_while/,[deleted],1404177559,"This post was originally going to be a reply to a long thread in this sub about how much fans of GoT also like Breaking Bad, but I decided to make a separate post because I felt like this could be a long, interesting discussion. So, here is my advice to people going through Game of Thrones withdrawal: if you're into tragic dramas heavy on dialogue and violence, Shakespeare may be the next author you want to read/watch.

I know what most of you are probably thinking; Shakespeare is girly poetry, it's boring, it's old, etc. If you've only read Shakespeare and haven't seen his better works performed, you're really missing out! You may have seen one of his comedies or know the story of Romeo and Juliet, but there is a very dark side to Shakespeare they don't teach in high school. Many of his plays are just a game of thrones... they include tons of wars, murders, political scheming, family members killing each other, the most gruesome deaths imaginable, and of course plenty of revenge and despair. If you're able to see a show performed, it transforms the experience because the actors can communicate with emotion and movement what you may not completely comprehend in the text. Shakespeare was obviously a genius and almost every line has many meanings; it can be studied endlessly, but his plays was meant to be *seen*, not read.

Hamlet is my personal favorite and one of the more relevant plots to GoT. I suggest the movie version with Kenneth Branaugh because he is The Man and I wish they'd cast him in GoT. He would have been perfect as Littlefinger or Stannis. [This soliloquy in particular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=easWqy08wr8) could have been read by Robb Stark gathering an army to revenge his father and would have made perfect sense.

&gt;How all occasions do inform against me,

&gt;And spur my dull revenge!

&gt;How stand I then,	 

&gt;That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,

&gt;Excitements of my reason and my blood,	 

&gt;And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see	 

&gt;The imminent death of twenty thousand men,

&gt;That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,	 

&gt;Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot

&gt;Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,

&gt;Which is not tomb enough and continent	 

&gt;To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,

* The team members must be house family members

* They can also be the house guards that are frequently mentioned in the books/show (Ex: The Hound - Lannister, Areoh Hotah - Martell, Jorah Mormont - Targeryen, etc.)

* Only can a guard be used if there are not enough family members known in the books/show to create a team of their own house. (Ex: cannot make a team of Clegane, cannot use Theon Greyjoy for Stark because can make full Greyjoy team)

* The characters do not have to currently be alive but they had to have been alive in the show/book at one point. (Ex: you cannot choose Rhaegar Targeryen, can use Robert Baratheon)

* No animals allowed

* Obviously it will be difficult to field a full team of 11 so I am thinking teams of 6-8 would be better but if you can field 11 good characters then bonus points for you.

Obviously some of the potential house team members are up for debate, just try to use your best judgement.

My top two choices are:

1. Targeryen - Dany, Grey Worm, Jorah Mormont, Barristan Selmy, Missandei, Daario Naharis, Strong Belwas, Viserys Targaryen (unfortunately), Khal Drogo?

2. Martell - Doran Martell (coach), Oberyn Martell, Areoh Hotah, Trystane Martell, The Sand Snakes (potentially all 8 of them), Arys Oakheart

And the one thing I keep thinking is how awesome would it be if the cast from the show voiced their parts from the books. Having just one reader changes voice for each character is kind of disorientating. Now I know that they are very busy actors but it would still be awesome. So this my question.

For those who read the books how many lines does each character have? in a rough estimation? Would be logistically possible to have the voice actors read their parts if you broke down all their lines. I mean you could have them bang through 1000 lines in a few days.

As I listened to it I fall more in love with the idea of making it an audio story with different voice actors and background sound effects. I bet some point in the future once the story is done someone will undertake this epic job. Hopefully we live to hear it ;)

So a few days ago I came to this sub hoping to get some answers to a few questions I had about GOT. Not only was this sub EXTREMELY helpful and spoiler-free, but were very inviting. I figured since you all were interested in my opinions on the series as a new blood (and since I'm addicted to this show like its a drug), I'd post an update every few episodes just to ask some questions and voice some opinions. I figured I'd call it ""Your New Blood Update"".

JUST FINISHED: S1E4

New Questions:

1) Who all are on the King's council at this point and what are their jobs? [S1E4](#s ""Like, for example, Ned Stark is the Hand of the King"")

2) [S1E4](#s ""Why does the one member of the council like Caetlyn Stark?"")

3) [S1E4](#s ""What was with the 3 eyed crow/raven in Bran's dream?"")

New Opinions: 

I've gotta say, this show just keeps getting better. 

Arya Stark is an awesome little badass. She's become the daughter I've always wanted... despite the lack of filter and sharp edge.

Her older sister Sansa to me is an extremely sad character.... [S1E4](#s ""She really does love that little cunt Joffery, I think, but she's stuck between a rock and a hard place..."")

[S1E4](#s ""I am SOOO MAD that my favourite drinking buddy Tyrion is getting framed for Bran's attempted murder!!! &gt;:Z SOOOO PISSED!!"")

[S1E4](#s ""Jamie is a pitiable character to me. He is an amazing warrior, at least if his stories are true, and he's stuck standing guard while the guy who's married to his sister fucks whores... No wonder he has a relationship with his sister... No one else will!! ...."")

Well, that's YNBU r/GOT!! See you after S1E6!",7,4,False,self,,,,,

JUST FINISHED: S1E6 (Sorry about the headline... S1E5-6, not 6-7)

As someone who can see both sides of the argument, I can understand why Jaime is pissed that Lady Stark took Tyrion. However.... I think that murdering Ned's guards was a HUGE step in the wrong direction.... that only creates enemies... Very, very powerful enemies...

The Eyire is.... well... eerie.... House Arryn is in total ruin (AND WHO THE FUCK BREASTFEEDS A 5 YEAR OLD BOY!?!?!?). Tyrion BETTER NOT DIE OR I'M RIOTING. This whole buisness of him trying to kill Bran is WRONG.... and it's not just because Jamie and Cersei admit to doing in in an earlier episode... Tyrion is like a perfect drinking buddy... He would never have the heart to kill anyone... And at the same time he's clever enough to get himself out of trouble... Sounds like a great friend to have!! 

Tyrion's little stunt of the trial by combat is interesting... and even MORE interesting because he names the REAL attempted murderer as his ""champion"". The genius of Tyrion at work AGAIN!!

""A Lannister always repays his debts."" After Tyrion's Champion killed that knight (I did feel bad...) I was really wondering if Tyrion would pay the jailer. It just made him even cooler when he actually did!! Speaking of the Champion... who WAS he exactly? Character name I mean. I don't think it's mentioned.

No Jon though.... for the most part... Just him and Fat Sam, as I'm now calling him. Hopefully I get more of my favourite bastard in later episodes!!

Ned is wounded... Painfully. And it is that scene in particular that proves how AWESOME another character is: Jamie Lannister. Yes, he orders Ned Stark's guard dead... Which made me very very angry at him... But that duel with Ned was extremely honourable. After one of his guards stabbed Ned in the leg Jamie WENT AFTER THE GUARD. That tells me that underneath the ""stereotypical antagonist"" exterior lies an honourable man just trying to keep himself and his sister safe. 

That scene with Robb, Bran, and Theon where those bandits attack Bran... Why the hell is Robb so mad at Theon!? He saved their lives!! I get that the poor guy is a Greyjoy but that doesn't mean his opinion is any less valuable!! :/ I can see a bad relationship forming here and it's making me antsy... 

That 3-eyed bird came back AGAIN. Still no clue what it means, and it's really creepy.

That Mountain dude is a MONSTER. He reminds me of that guy from the first Sherlock Holmes movie with Robert Downy Jr... The giant guy who spoke French? 

Baelish is now my best friend and worst enemy AT THE SAME TIME. He's a great character with almost no motive other than to mess with the minds of others. I have a feeling it was his subtle ""convincing"" that finally pushed Interim King Ned to essentially DECLARE FUCKING WAR ON THE LANNISTERS!! WHAT KIND OF MANIAC WOULD DO THAT!?!? I UNDERSTAND HE'S UNDER DURESS BUT FUCKING STILL THAT'S JUST STUPID.

Sansa and Joffery are, in fact, made for each other. The way she treated her nanny (I think that's who she was?) was awful. She's becoming a cunt just like Joffery.

Viserys Targaryen. I don't know where to begin. I hated him, and hated him and hated him. Then I realized something. He's had his home taken away from him, and would do anything to get an army to take it back. I'm not saying he made the right choice, it's just that it's a bit understandable. Now his WHOLE PLAN has totally backfired, and Kal Drogo will only listen to his little Khalesa and not him. No wonder he shows up wasted to the baby shower! .... He finally got his crown though.... Just not in the way I- nor he- expected. RIP Viserys.

And.... OH MY GOD... THANKS TO JON ARRYN AND A LINEAGE BOOK READ ALOUD BY LORD EDDARD STARK, I HAVE LEARNED THAT JOFFERY IS NOT ONLY A CUNT, BUT A CUNT SANDWICH... BECAUSE HE'S INBRED (Da dum tiss. Thank you! Tip your waitresses!). I actually started laughing when the dramatic music started playing... and Sansa's little forshadowing ""He's nothing like that drunk old king!"" HE LITERALLY ISN'T ANYTHING LIKE HIM. HOLY SHIT THIS SHOW IS AMAZING!!!

Someone the other day posted the Targaryen family tree, I noticed that King Robert is a second cousin to Daenerys.  I apparently missed that detail when I read the books.  I knew he had a connection to the Targaryen line as that was his justification for taking the throne, just didn't realize it was that close.

So my question is, does this relationship (or a similar one) exist in the show?   IIRC the show-runners eliminated the generation of Targaryens between Maester Ameon and the Mad King, and it looks like that's where Robert's family branches off.",19,8,False,self,,,,,

I am not a book reader so I obviously can't have a position on this but I'd love to hear your thoughts over these categories:


Dialogue 

Plot

Character Development

Detail

Action

Visual (comlare sets and props to detail about scenes in the books)

Personally, I've always been a fan of television. Like movies we actually have acting, acting especially if it's good; in Game of Thrones it's great, can propel a character into depths no words can. Human emotions can never be expressed as vividly by words than by a human displaying emotions. Also, sets, props, costumes. You can visualize it all in great detail with great writing but it's not the same as actually seeing it. Television as a medium takes it a step further than movies by having seasonal arcs. Much like the novels they are based on, each season has a few big, exciting stories that unfold, resolve and lead to new stories in the last couple of episodes. From my personal experience I have never seen a movie or book build and deliver as well as a tv show. Juet my two cents. I have read some quotes from the novels and maybe it's just because they're out of context but the writing doesn't seem stellar, good but not great. Game of Thrones on the other hand is a 10/10 IMO.",33,3,False,self,,,,,

I'd love for anybody to record themselves saying these names!

This was originally posted in the book subreddit, so a few names might be unfamiliar to people who only watch the show.

Here is the list, for anybody who would like to try their hand at the pronunciation challenge:

Arya Stark -- Catelyn Tully -- Sansa Stark -- Hoster Tully

When rescued, he had the whole family exterminated. Little baby Dontos was spared because the man who led the rescue mission begged it of the King as a favor. That man was Barristan Selmy.

In S01E10 during the ""King in the North!"" scene, you briefly see an older grizzled woman as part of Robb's council. That woman is Maege Mormont. Jorah's aunt, and NW Commander Jeor Mormont's sister, who has been ruling Bear Island.

Sam's father, the cruel Randyll Tarly - Is Mace Tyrell's right hand man and is considered one of the best battlefield commanders in the realm. In fact, during Robert's Rebellion, it was Tarly's vanguard that dealt Robert his only defeat of the war. In season 1 when Robert, Barristan and Jaime are exchanging ""your first kill"" stories, note that Robert's was ""some stupid Tarly boy.""

Illyrio Mopatis (the man who was housing Daenerys and her brother in Episode 1) - In the pilot episode, you can see some personal guards hanging around Illyrio (especially at the wedding). They are wearing small helmets with a spike sticking straight up, and a small cloth to cover their waist. Those are Unsullied, and that is much closer to how they were described in the books. I'm glad the show changed their look since than. Dany's Unsullied look bad-ass.

Also in the pilot, when Robert tells Ned ""it's been 9 years!"", it's because the last time they saw each other was when they had to crush the Greyjoy Rebellion. That is also how Theon became Ned's ward/hostage.

Arya named her direwolf Nymeria after a famous warrior princess from the Eastern continent. She invaded Dorne (which at the time was several kingdoms), Married a Martell, and together they conquered all of Dorne. According to the stories, she landed with 10,000 ships.

Thoros of Myr and Robert used to be drinking buddies.

Beric Dondarrion (the leader of Brotherhood Without Banners) - I bet you don't remember seeing him in Season 1, do you? When Ned was sitting the Iron Throne, and the complaints were coming in about The Mountain raping and pillaging his way across the Riverlands, Ned decided to put an end to it, and assembled a party to ""go forth and bring justice to the false knight Gregor Clegaine"". As the leader of this party Ned named Ser Beric Dondarrion (which you can see in the show, but a different actor), and Thoros as second-in-command (which was not shown). Later (offscreen) the party was ambushed and decimated by Gregor and his men... In the mean time Robert died, Ned died, and what was left of this party, including a freshly-revived-after-his-first-death Beric became the Brotherhood Without Banners.

I could go on, but it's lunch time :)

#Welcome to the first /r/GameofThrones Fan Creation Competition!  
This will be an ongoing competition with several rounds this summer.  The thread is [All Spoilers] because all GoT/ASOIAF events and characters are open for reference and use in this competition, so beware if you have not read the books!  *This thread should really be [All Spoilers/Theory], but please use the green speculation tags where appropriate and make note of where they might apply for your entries.*  Hopefully this competition will add a little spice to the subreddit during the off-season (:

**How its going to work:**  

*  Each round will have a broad theme that allows for a wide variety of art to be created.  The theme of Round 1 is **Home**.  The winner of the previous round will decide the theme of the next round.

*  Each round will be one week, with ~6 days for creation and 1 day for voting.  We are starting a little early with round 1  from the time of posting you will have until **Thursday July 10th 11:59PM EDT** to submit art, and then a survey will be open the entirety of **Friday July 11th** for voters to vote for their favourite piece.  You will find the voting link at the top of this post when voting opens.

*  Art will be submitted as a top level comment in the round thread (don't post your entry in response to someone elses or it may be missed).

*  The winner of the ~~kingsmoot~~ round will be announced and contacted at ~11:59PM on Friday night, and then the next round will begin as soon as the winner tells me the theme and will end on Thursday night at 11:59PM EDT with Friday for voting.

**Rules:**

*  All forms of art are welcome, from paintings to clay to wood carvings to songs to poetry to monologues and anything you can think of.

* You can submit multiple entries (but you might be splitting your own vote by doing so, Asha/Victarion style!)  The goal of this competition is to fuel the creative fires in this subreddit, and the more art that is created, the better!

*  **YOU must have created it.**  No posting someone elses art you found on Tumblr or dA as your own.  I will know, and there will be blood (and youll be blacklisted from the competition going forward [and banned from the subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/29rbck/all_spoilers_fan_creation_competition_all_art_is/cinvp6d)).

*  If you choose to do a graphic or video edit of existing content (e.g. you mix together clips from the episodes to someone elses song, or you edit a still of Robb or a stock photo to have a wolfs head), **make sure you clearly give credit to all parties either inside of your content or in your comment.**  Please dont use other peoples drawings or paintings in any graphic edits you do.

*  Try and spend SOME time on your entries.  You dont have to be an ~incredible artist~, but you shouldnt just run a pic through a Photoshop filter and call it done.  

*  **Art should be new for the competition** (i.e. you cant have posted it in this subreddit before).  I am not a greenseer and therefore have no way of telling if youve created it before or during the round, so it will have to be on faith.

*  Dont post your creation as its own thread in this subreddit until AFTER the round is over.  That way all pieces have the same opportunity to be seen and voted for.

*  Be polite and kind to your fellow artists.  All skill levels are welcome, and I will have no insults under my roof.  If you dont like something, dont vote for it.  Simple as that.

*  I withhold the right to not accept an entry to the competition if it breaks one of the above rules/guidelines, but I will hopefully not have to do so. (:

**Additional notes:**

*  If there is desire for longer rounds, we can consider that for future rounds.  One week was chosen to allow for a lot of different themes.

*  The winners prize is to select the next theme and the pride and fame of sitting upon the Iron Easel for a week.  I will have to approve the selected theme - it needs to be broad enough to allow people to interpret it in different ways, not something so specific as Ned Stark being beheaded, but I will consider allowing individual characters as a theme.  Houses are valid themes, as would be something like the Red Wedding, and of course, single words like this weeks Home.

* Things will probably be slow for the first round or two until people learn about the competition and know to expect it, so what better lists to enter for hedge knights such as we?

NOW, GO FORTH AND CREATE!

* Shae &amp; Tyrion love each other, or so we're led to believe. She talks about running away with him to Essos, even if this means giving up his wealth &amp; power as a lannister
* Vaerys offers her diamonds to leave, but she insists that Tyrion has to be the one to order her away. Surely that means money has little to no influence in her decisions?
* She is clearly upset by Tyrion's marriage to Sansa; however this is where I think the story falls short, Tyrion shows no interest in Sansa (Doesn't sleep with her on the wedding night) &amp; repeats over and over that he is marrying her out of duty not love. She may not believe that, but it's fairly consistent with his attitude &amp; Tywin's actions, isn't it?
* The scene in which he calls her a whore &amp; tells her to leave seems like a pretty obvious ""I'm doing this for your safety"" play. He's not saying it with any cold conviction, in fact he seems really reluctant to even say the words. Seems like a huge leap for her to turn the ship around, stay in King's landing &amp; actively seek out Tywin so she can testify against Tyrion.
* If she didn't actively seek Tywin out, &amp; Tywin found her &amp; forced her to testify; then why sleep with him &amp; try to kill Tyrion? Is that the same woman who said that they would fight everyone to be together?

None of the options seem convincing to me; that she was just a woman scorned? That she never loved Tyrion? That she always loved him but then simply reverted to being a whore after the testimony? I think it's a little naive for her to believe Tyrion's outburst so wholeheartedly when it came from nowhere.

Edit: The Shae-Tyrion relationship is a lot like Ygritte-Jon; If Ygritte had shot Jon full of arrows the minute that she saw him in battle. I mean, Ygritte had far more right to be angry yet still hesitated where Shae seemingly didn't.",36,56,False,self,,,,,

Because I know the show will once again pull off an amazing new cast out of nowhere. Some of their choices were so damn good: bronn, the hound, arya, oberyn.. 

So let's hear about your dream casting that will never happen (for the best). Here's mine

Euron: Willem Dafoe (looking emaciated)

Victarion: Punisher era Dolph Lundgren 

The Reader: Gary Oldman (Have you? the Reader asked, so softly)

Prince Doran: a younger Omar Shariff

Kindly Old Man: Malcolm Mcdowell

Jon Connington: Ian McShane

Nimble Dick: Jackie Earl Haley

Darkstar: Crispin Glover or Tim Roth

Randyll Tarly: Mark Strong

Aurane Waters: Tom Hiddleston

Septon Meribald: Brian Cox 

Bloodraven: Max Von Sydow

Arys Oakheart: Dominic West

Balon Swann: Tom Hardy

and finally as Howland Reed/High Sparrow?: Jeremy Irons - Can you imagine that voice telling the story of the TOJ?

Still reading ASOS, so I've no clue what comes next. 

First off, the crown itself. Now, I know that if both Tommen and Myrcella were to be removed from the equation, then Stannis couldn't possibly become king, since he's in open rebellion against the crown (though even if neither of the Baratheon brothers rebelled, I doubt that the Lannisters would've let Stannis or Renly become king in any case). So who would become king in this scenario? 

Secondly, the Lannisters themselves. With Tywin gone, I would assume that lordship of their house passes to Cersei. I've seen disputes to that, with people saying that Kevan would take over, but I'd like to know for certain. And if Cersei becomes Lady of House Lannister, would she also take Tywin's titles of Warden and Lord Paramount of the West, or would she give these lesser titles to Kevan (or someone more amenable for her) given that she'd be Queen of the Seven Kingdoms in all but name?",1,2,False,self,,,,,

That was what princesses were for, she had been taught . . . though, admittedly, her uncle Oberyn had taken a different view of matters.  **""If you would wed, wed,"" the Red Viper had told his own daughters.  ""If not, take your pleasure where you find it.  There's little enough of it in this world.  Choose well, though.  If you saddle yourself with a fool or a brute, don't look to me to rid you of him.  I gave you the tools to do that for yourself.""**  

Oberyn was such a badass.  I miss him so much.  I hope this makes it onto the show; it really says a lot about how he views women and how he raised his children. ",11,20,False,self,,,,,

-Who is Alleras?  Have we met him already in one of the Dorne chapters?  Should I have recognized him when he appeared, besides from the events of the prologue?  And while we're on the subject . . . 

-The prologue.  Where does it occur chronologically?  I'd assumed that Pate died at the end of it, but he appears again at the end of the book, in Sam's chapter.  Does the prologue take place after the events in Sam's final chapter, or before it?   

-Am I supposed to know who the alchemist (the man who makes the deal with Pate in the beginning) is at this point, or has that not been revealed as of the end of book four? 

-This last question probably can't be answered without spoiling something for me at this point, but I'm going to ask it anyway, and if it *is* discussed later, please tag it appropriately.  In one of Brienne's chapters, when she meets Gendry, there's a boy named Pate staying with them and brotherhood without banners.  Is he the same Pate as the one in the prologue and ending, or are they just different characters with the same name?

First some back story.

[Jon Snow theory](#g ""I am sure some of you have seen this speculation that Jon Snow could be the son of Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen, not Ned Stark and a mystery woman. Now that that is out of the way, lets look at Melisandre's ability to tell that Gendry was Robert Baratheon's bastard. 
Now Im not sure how she was able to tell that Gendry was King Robert's son and also has Kings blood in him. Im just going to assume that the Lord of Light (one true god) told her or whatever. With this ability to detect who has kings blood (which I am also assuming is Targaryen blood). Could she have the sense that Jon Snow has kings blood in him? And further solidify this theory that Jon Snow is the child of Lyanna and Rhaegar? 
Could that be why that scene was so prominent? It just seemed like they made that scene for us to say ""well why did they make that scene"". 
At first I thought well maybe Melisandre is Jon's mother. But that wouldn't make sense since she came from the far east on the other continent (cant remember the name of the continent"")

Yesterday was the first day I have ever seen Game of Thrones, many people recommended me to watch it but I thought it was a Syfy medieval type show.. I was wrong. The first episode blew my mind and out of a 1-100, I easily gave it a 100. I was hooked on it and continued to watch the whole season. I just finished the first season not that long ago and I have to say I love it and dislike it on some parts. The show is greatly put together, the actors are perfect for each role and they can make you love them or hate them in one moment and in a split second quickly change it. The reason I dislike it a bit is because once you love a character and feel like they are going to do something great, they die.. I almost quit watching the show on episode 9 when Eddard Stark was beheaded, I was quiet and in shock for a good 5 minutes before I quietly said ""what... the... fuck.."". I have to say a saw many things coming in the show, and others I didn't. I knew that Daenerys wasn't going to burn when she stepped in the fire built for Drogo and the witch, I also saw the dragons coming from the egg too. I'm still very fuzzy on some of the parts on season 1 because it is difficult to understand what some people are saying in some scenes, and usually they are major plot things. I really wish the little kid who is the king should be killed and his mother, I've never watched any show and hated a persons characters so badly as I do with this show, they really know how to make someone piss you off lol. I know the mother is going to die soon, (eddard's wife) usually they kill of the parents very early in a show so I'll try to brace myself for that. On a scale from 1 - 100 my final score for this first season would have to be, 100,000 :) This is my new favorite show, I never thought I would love this show as much as I do and I'm kind of mad that I didn't watch it sooner. 

I will post a new topic every season and let everyone know how I feel about each season. I may also post questions here to you all when I'm not sure what's happening on some episodes and please try to answer them for me :)

Also, please don't say any spoilers in the comments, I really want to be shocked on what happens in the series.",3,5,False,self,,,,,

&gt; Can I dwell on what I scarce remember? I held a castle on the Marches once, and there was a woman I was pledged to marry, but I could not find that castle today, nor tell you the color of that woman's hair. Who knighted me, old friend? What were my favorite foods? It all fades. Sometimes I think I was born on the bloody grass in that grove of ash, with the taste of fire in my mouth and a hole in my chest. Are you my mother, Thoros?
&gt; 
&gt; -Beric Dondarrion

I love the actor for Beric and his scenes in the show are fantastic. I read this quote with his voice in mind and it is perfect. I would love it if the last two sentences were said with little emotion. They seem like they are sad but he is basically dying inside. It is great character building for Beric as he is becoming a hollow shell of what he was and I wish they had emphasized this more in the show. With the rumors that LSH won't appear in the show some people have theorized that her role may be taken by Beric as he is revived more and more so they may have purposely minimized this effect to leave him somewhere to go in later seasons. Eventually he may turn into what LSH was, a single minded embodiment of vengeance/justice. Personally I would rather they just include LSH.

I really just wanted to share this quote again but I would love to hear what quotes from the books you wish had been (or will be) included in the show? 

Is it because its badass, adds great world/character building, or simply the actor is so fantastic that the thought of them uttering those words sends chills down your spine.

The deal we are presented with when it first comes up is ""life"" and ""only death can pay for life"", the maegi kills Drogo's horse and bathes him in the blood and she says no living soul must enter the tent. So that would have resulted in the *technically* alive khal who is a vegetable, right?

Then Ser Jorah ends up bringing her to the maegi for the birth, enters the tent and he was also ""touched"" by the dancing shadows of death, he is very ""grey"" - and of course Raegho Jr. turns out to be a still born lizard filled with deathworms. Dany was affected too.

When confronted, the maegi reveals the deal-with-the-devil style trick of having used the unspecific description ""life"" AND she says ""That was a lie you told yourself. You knew the price"" concerning Dany's still-born baby, as if that was also part of the maegi's plan and deal, when Dany says ""I thought you meant the horse"". And Drogo will come back when ""...your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child.""


So, did Drogo's wound fester because of the burning, stinging treatment Mirri Maz Duur put on it, or because he ripped it off and replaced it with mud? Was she tricking them from the beginning or was he always beyond help? At first it was just a ""scratch"".

Did Mirri know her bloodmagic would kill Dany's child even if Dany had NOT entered the tent? Or was that a ""happy coincidence"" for Mirri that Ser Jorah brought Dany in because she would not have gotten help from the khalasaar?

Was the baby always a lizard? Is that why the Targaryens have always wed brother to sister, because other partners would not yield a healthy offspring? Or is that just something that's wrong with Dany? Or a result of her being carried into the tent and exposed to the bloodmagic? Is her womb unable to bear a living child because of the tent or has it always been like that?",8,5,False,default,,,,,

Sorry I haven't kept you up to date in awhile. I've been camping up where the wifi fears to tread.... Fun fact though: one of the people at the campsite had a white husky named Ghost. I got a good laugh out of that.

Anyway... JUST FINISHED: Season 1 FINALE!!

Joffery is officially the cuntiest cunt ever to cunt. ""I have heard the Lady Sansa's words. BUT FUCK IT KILL NED STARK ANYWAY!!!"" THAT LITERALLY CAN ONLY MAKE THINGS WORSE WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU DO THAT!?!?!? I made the mistake of shouting that outloud in the campsite and the echo could be heard across the mountains.... It was necessary and worth it...

Arya is an amazing little scamp. She's suffered through so very very much. From losing her father, to becoming a boy while travelling up to the wall. Poor Arya just can't win....

Sansa went from aggravating to pitiable. Now she's a prisoner where she felt most comfortable. I can't even remotely imagine how this is gonna play out in season 2.

Robb. Officially grown up. High king of Winterfell. KING IN THE NORTH! LONG BE HIS REIGN! PROVEN IN COMBAT!! FORCED TO MARRY a girl to get ^over ^a ^^river.... Poor... Poor... Guy... I hope his quest for vengeance is successful but doesn't go to his head....

Caetlyn is now the queen mother of Winterfell. Sort of lost. Sort of broken... And threw her son into a forced marriage to try and win a war.... :/

Tywin Lannister... First thing's first, the opening scene where us the audience meets Tywin and he's skinning a buck... That's some really fucking clever symbolism there. House Lannister is going to skin House Baratheon... o.O But Tywin is a hardcore old man. I have a feeling I need to dislike him... But he hasn't done anything that I feel is worthy of hatred... If anything he's being sensible!! He just wants his blood (because Joffery is ALL his blood) on the Iron Throne. I still hope he loses the war.

Jaime... The badass imprisoned... Tricked at Riverrun by the ""boy"" Robb Stark. And I don't know who I think is more worthy of the term ""badass"" between Robb and Jaime... I have a feeling Jamie is gonna get excecuted as recompense for Ned... That'd make me break down...

Cersei- Fuck the bitch. I just don't have anything nice to say... so someone can try and make me like her, but I just can't.

Tyrion and Bronn. Very clever duo, they play well off each other. Tyrion the brains and Bronn the.... brawn... And now my drinking buddy is Hand of the King!! A perfect place for a clever wit like Tyrion!! Hopefully he can slap Joffery over and over in season 2 like he did early in season 1!! 

Daenerys Targaryen is the deadliest, fire-proof, dragon-owning, queen. That FUCKING WITCH THAT KILLED KAL DROGO (And oh my gods I'm defending Kal Drogo I NEVER thought I'd do that....) DESERVED WHAT SHE GOT AND I HOPE HELL LIKES HER. The 7 Kingdoms are so fucked up I hope the Khaalesi grooms her dragons and new clan for war and re-conquers the lot of them!!

And now the best-worst for last.... My favourite bastard. John Snow. I can totally understand his feelings to run to Robb. Totally screwed by the master sargeant by being thrown into the Stewards. His dad killed by a cunt. He halfbrother off to war. I would break the vow too. But then the head steward was talking to him about how similar they were... And I was like ""What the fuck do you know you blind old man!?"" AND AS IT TURNS OUT, THE OLD MAN'S HAIR ISN'T JUST WHITE BECAUSE HE'S OLD, IT'S WHITE BECAUSE HE'S A TARGARYEN. GO FUCKING FIGURE!!!! HE KNOWS EXACTLY HOW JON FEELS. I'm happy Jon came back... Those poor guys at the Night's Watch need their master swordsman Jon to protect against gods know what are beyond the wall...

Now I need my second dose of drama.... time to start watching Season 2...

That's YNBU r/GOT!! Thanks for listening/reading! I'll see you all after S2E2!!",11,4,False,self,,,,,

Hope someone could fill it in for me, or if it just hasn't been mentioned yet, this might be purely speculation.


S03E03 Lady Olenna and Varys discuss Sansa and how Littlefinger is not to acquire her, so they plan for her to marry Loras Tyrell.

S03E05 Littlefinger finds out Sansa is to be wed to Loras. 

??? (Come back to later).

S04E02 At the Purple Wedding, Joffrey dies and Sansa escapes to a ship with Littlefinger. We also know that the Tyrells, and specifically Lady Olenna was part of the Purple Wedding murder along side Littlefinger.


So the ??? in the timeline is where I'm a little confused. Did the Tyrells / Lady Olenna switch sides from helping Varys to Littlefinger? What changed in the circumstances?

* Tyrion is a jester. It made sense - he was a dwarf, had a sarcastic sense of humor and said things other people were afraid to say.

* Tywin is a butler. I saw the scene where he says 'the king is tired' and Tyrion notices that he sent the king to his room without dinner. I assumed he must be to Joffrey what Alfred was to Batman.

* Theon is a Stark. Not really funny, but in the first scenes it seemed like they're all family. When Jon said about 5 wolves for five Stark children, it made sense since Rickon didn't appear yet.",136,62,False,self,,,,,

The wedding started and all was joyous. She kept saying how cute Robb and Talisa were and then she ""awwwh'd"" after Talisa said they'd name their child Eddard. ""I like those two, they're so cute,"" she said. I stifled my giggles, patiently awaiting her inevitable heartbreak. The bride and groom of the wedding were carried off to go fuck romantically to the sounds of murder. Then the doors were closed behind them and Lady Stark started acting strange. ""Why is she so worried?"" ""Oh, probably just hoping the bride and groom wear protection."" Then, the wedding band started playing the Lannister's song. ""Mrs. Stark looks sad, is that her and her dead husband's wedding song or something?"" A couple minutes pass and then innocent little Talisa is brutally stabbed, repeatedly. I guess Eddard isn't a lucky name...heh, heh. My girlfriend just squeezes my hand and her jaw slowly drops. The wedding goes on for a a bit longer as everyone is killed.

Can ""Game of Thrones"" help you fall asleep? Tonight it will, as I analyze ""Breaker of Chains"", season 4/ episode 3, using progressive boredom to lull you off to dreamland. Game of Drones is a GoT podcast that's part bedtime story and part high school class you can't stay awake for. Don't watch ""Game of Thrones"", don't worry this will put you to sleep anyway. ""Breaker of Chains"" is packed with great humor so hopefully you have it saved on your DVR or can watch again on HBO Go.",0,8,False,self,,,,,

I don't think there is a lot of evidence to it but I can't get it out of my head.

I think the white walkers are actually all Stark ancestors - lead by the Night's King who I believe is Brandon the Builder... (Winter is Coming, The Winds of Winter).

I think they have had to go into hiding for 1000s of years until man forgot about the power of dragon glass following the Night's King defeat.

I think they will likely use the horn to free Ice Dragons suspended in the wall (winds of winter), and have a quick stop over in the Winterfell crypts to raise a few kin. I also think the original reason for the wall was not to protect he south from the north, but actually to protect the north form the south.

This leaves the remainder of the plot to evolve into some sort of three way free for all. The Starks/white walkers/ice dragons vs Daenerys and fire dragons vs Jon Snow the half cast backed by TLOL

Anyway, this isn't really about that. This is more about Jon. 

D&amp;D didn't want Season 4 to end with the big reveal of a dead character being alive... because *that is how Season 5 will end*

D&amp;D don't like to repeat themselves the way GRRM sometimes does. Blackwater was a huge battle that ended with an army marching in out of nowhere and saving the day. Castle Black could have done the exact same thing, but chose to save Stannis' arrival for the next episode.

Season 1 and 3 we see Ned and Robb rise to power, behead someone, make some mistakes, trust the wrong people, and ultimately die. In Jon's remaining arc we see him rise to power, behead someone, make some mistakes, trust the wrong people, and ultimately die. Would fans stand for this? Not only another Stark getting the chop, but in the same formula we've seen before? 

We know that the power of the Red God can raise the dead. In the show, Melisandre interacts with Thoros and realizes his power. Could she harness it for herself? I say, sure, probably.

And if Jon dies and is brought back, wouldn't it have an even greater effect if it was a finale like nothing we've seen before? And something even book readers wouldn't know?

Anyway, that's my prediction. It's going to be a long 7 months. ",1,0,False,self,,,,,

So I accidentally binge watched the first 4 episodes of the second season. This show is my heroin I swear....

Anyway... JUST FINISHED: S2E4

Fuck the Greyjoys. All of them. I heard about their house sigil and thought ""These guys sound like sailors! They must be cool!!"" Nah. They're ""noble pirates""! FUCK THAT. Pirate =/= noble, no matter how far your house goes back. Theon was a pitiable character and instead of helping out his best friend fight his war, he totally betrays him to join up with his father that DOESN'T EVEN RESPECT HIM. Blood is blood I know but WHY!!!? Do the Greyjoys SERIOUSLY think that they can take the entirety of the North with a Naval armada!? Crippled BRAN would be their captain and they'd STILL win!

I have another favourite character now. Davos Seaworth. I know above I said that pirates and noblemen can't be compared, but Davos is like a druggie in rehab. He's another one of those characters that I'd love to have a drink with, just to hear the stories. A new badass to the foray is Stanis Baratheon. The true king by blood, and he deserves it!! He's the only king that commands authority by just being himself! The only thing that frightens me about the elder Baratheon is that fucking (literally) religious zealot woman he keeps on his person!!! AND THEN AT THE END OF THE FIFTH EPISODE POOR DAVOS HAS TO WATCH WHILE SHE PUSHES OUT A FUCKING DAEMON BABY WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT THING!?!?!!?!?!?!?!?

The younger Baratheon has no claim to the throne at all other than ""Well, everyone else is doing it!!"" Stupid. Not only is it stupid, he'll never have an heir... You need to be with a woman to have kids, and he doesn't roll that way. And I have a feeling he won't be a threat to the throne for very long. Either he'll join up with Stanis or he'll be destroyed by him.

Joffery... You know what guys? I give up. Every single time I talk about the ""King"" I use the word cunt. Finally, the only usable quote from the series to describe Joffery, and naturally it comes from Bronn (The new captain of the King's Guard thanks to my buddy Tyrion!! Haha!!) ""There's no cure for being a cunt."" And unfortunately, Tyrion's attempted cure of sex (best drinking buddy EVER) only helped reinforce my belief of Joffery's total narcissism. He laughed as he watched a whore beat another to death... WHO THE FUCK DOES THAT!? PLEEEEEEEASE GRRM KILL THIS BASTARD!!!! &gt;:Z

Tyrion is a genius. An absolute genius. He realized that the Small Council is what undoes the hand. So his little lies to each of the other members showed him who the queen's informant was. Fucking brilliant. Tyrion only gets better!!

Sansa is a prisoner still, but the way she acts it's like she has Stockholm Syndrome or something...

Cersei.... She thinks she's in control... But she can't control her son, or the council, OR herself. Go figure.

Robb IS a badass. Sneak attacks so glorious they're blown out of proportions by the Lannisters. Combat on the field so amazing he's feared. LONG LIVE THE KING IN THE NORTH!!

Jamie... Please be free Jamie.... #FreeJamie

Dani has found her city!! Karth... Or is it Quarth? I don't know. Either way, the Carthage-esque city is way to sketchy for me... Dani's dragons better do some serious conquering when they grow up! The Targaryen tribe need to get out of there soon!!

And while all of this is happening, my favourite bastard is beyond the wall... entertaining some sick, twisted asshole who fucks his daughters...

And there's still those blue-eyed devils who attacked the wall in S1 out there....

Well that's YNBU r/GOT!! I'll see you after my next binge watching session... I may be one of you veterans by the end of the month!!!",6,2,False,self,,,,,

I'm up to date with the show and just started book one. I'm also pretty new to Reddit and this subreddit is one of my favorites. Now to my question...

In short, Jaime Lannister is by far my favorite character. I could tell even from the beginning that underneath the bad guy tendencies he was displaying there was something more there. This notion was pretty much cemented during the bathtub scene in season three with Brienne when he explained the true backstory to his 'Kingslayer' title he has been given. The whole realm knows him for the literal backstabbing of the Mad King, yet we find out in season three the truth behind that day of reckoning. I'm wondering that besides Brienne, who else has he told that story to? Does Cersei know? Does even Tywin know that he owes his life to his son? Are the Lannister's under the impression that Jaime killed the Mad King just for the hell of it? And if not then what reason? I feel like I'm missing something that happened on that crazy day.


EDIT: Thank you all of the awesome informative responses! It seems as though some comments are conflicting with each other. Some say most everyone knows the truth, some say only Brienne knows. I'm only on book one but maybe there is more to be explained? The plot thickens.",36,12,False,self,,,,,

Reading through ASOIAF for the first time and this part absolutely made me jump, the hair on my neck stand up, and my heart start racing. Maybe it's because I already have a fear of hearing noises like this in the dark but wow! The whole next couple paragraphs I was just mentally repeating ""shitshitshitshitshitshitshitshit"" until they found out who it was.

This is what i think: The Mad King Raped Joanna and made the royal executioner (Ser Illyn Payne) watch the whole thing. As mad as Aerys were, he did not think he would keep the secret. So he sliced his tongue of, as then he may never speak again.

STARKS:

Arya- (Heartfelt Award) My little girl was already grown. She has a wit like Tyrion and the heart of Robb. She's escaped off into the wilderness of the Riverlands, and I'd bet a good deal on her survival, along with that Baratheon bastard she's running with, you know? The armourer? (The fat kid is probably dead already)

Sansa- Poor girl.... She's finally had her period, now the Great Cunt of Westeros can have his way with her.... poor, poor, poor Sansa.... The Hound gives her a way out, and I THINK she took it... I think... She's be damn stupid if she didn't!!

Caetlyn- .... Over the past nearly two seasons, I really liked Cate Stark. She was bold in a very interesting way, and an extremely likable character. Now, she's made a stupid stupid mistake.... Why the hell would she release Jamie Lannister, and WHY WOULD SHE SEND BRIANNE WITH HIM!?!? It's all extremely confusing. Hopefully she had a DAMN GOOD REASON.

Robb- (the Badass Award) Robb Stark, King in the North, has far too much for any man to deal with. His home under siege, and a war to fight. I can totally understand why he broke off an engagement he never wanted. Stress relief I suppose.

Bran/Hodor- Hodor? Hodor hodor. Anyway, Bran is on the run, and alive, thankfully. Hopefully he'll get back to Winterfell soon enough.

Jon Snow- He knows nothing. (I beg forgiveness from the mods, it's the first time I've said it, and the first time I've seen the scene with that quote) My favourite little bastard has screwed himself, and not screwed the hot wildling who *WAS* his prisoner. I still hope he survives.... He IS my favourite character after all...







LANNISTERS: 

Tyrion- (Best Friend Award) Yes, my little drinking buddy has devised the greatest plans ever. He successfully neutered the Baratheon fleet with a single arrow. He is the greatest tactitian of all time... HE BETTER NOT BE DEAD. GRRM, HE BETTER NOT BE.

Jaime- The former recipient of my BA award, the coolest knight in the 7 Kingdoms was tied to a post and needed to resort to killing a former squire to escape... Not the best way to get new fans...

Cersei- CRAZY BITCH.

Tywin- (Gained the most Favour)This is where Tyrion gets his wits from. The man's a genius. Absolute genius. Now if only he could've figured out that ARYA STARK was his cup bearer.... And that killing the entire guard staff of Harrenhal wasn't the best idea... Still, the tactical victory at King's Landing just made him the best general ever. SONGS WILL BE SUNG OF THE KIN'S AWESOME GRANDPA!!

Joffery- (Cunt of the Year) The award is a formality, even if he dies he'll keep it forever. I also have an exact quote from him: ""My mommy wants me back? Ummm O-o-o-ok! I'll leave these people who are fighting for me and my throne to hide away in my room!!"" My exact quote during that scene: ""FUCK YOU YOU CUNTBAG.""






GREYJOYS:

Theon- (Lost Most Favour) ..... Just.... Just fuck everything about Theon.... EVERYTHING. Killing that awesome Stark knight, the ravens... I hope Robb cleaves the head from his shoulders. Fuck him. Thank the gods those burned bodies weren't poor Bran... How the fuck does he think he can hold THE CAPITAL OF THE NORTH!?!?!? With 20 men!!!?!?!? You can burn Theon Greyjoy







BARATHEONS:

Stannis- He's gotten much more tyrannical, but I guess all men with a chance for power get like that. I can't exactly blame him, and if it means Joffery will die, I'd much preferred if HE'D won the siege of King's Landing.

Davos- Poor guy. He's lost his son in a horrific fire... and he's lost the battle. I really like Davos. For some reason I tend to like the Hand of the King.... Whoever it is (or in Davos' case, could be)









TARGARYEN:

Dani- Poor girl... JUST GIVE HER BACK HER DRAGONS!!!!!!!!!

Jorah- I figured I'd throw him in here. I still can't judge him properly. Does he want to get with Dani? Or just advise her? What's his deal....





THE BATTLE:

That was an amazing and EXTREMELY gorey fight, but it has been one of the best scenes so far. I'm hoping for more insanity as the seasons go on!!






Well, that's YNBU r/GOT!! See you after the FINALE!!!


If there are any other characters or moment that you're curious of my NB opinion on, just comment!!

[Theory Part 1](#g ""By having Dany marry Robb, Robert would be seen as giving at least *some* level of clemency to the Tagaryeans and their supporters; not much, but still enough to get the message across that they're not seen as bad people. That, of course, could backfire spectacularly because Littlefinger, but at least the king's seen as making an effort to repair some of the damage he's done."")

[Theory Part 2](#g ""Also, Robert basically makes sure that the Stark line stays secure. That's a bit out there, yeah, but if anything happens to Eddard and/or Robb and there's no other Stark that can be easily contacted, there would be a succession crisis in the North and Robert would **have** to get involved to settle things. By marrying Dany to Robb, he's making sure that doesn't happen, or that if it *does* happen, that it's at least mitigated for a time until the new Stark heir is born."")

[Theory Part 3](#g ""Finally, if Dany and Robb marry, the Iron Throne would have some eyes on the Tagaryeans. If anything, it's at least an early warning system if the Tagaryeans decide to pull a fast one for the throne. That way, Robert has some time to prepare and potentially nip the plan in the bud when and if it does happen."")

Yes. A full hour after my latest update, I HAVE ANOTHER TO UNLEASH!!! And since it's just one episode, I won't focus on characters, I'll focus more on scenes or locations.

King's Landing-

Tyrion's alive, thank the 7. But he was attacked by a Kingsguard member UNDER ORDERS FROM CERSEI TO KILL HIM. FUCK HER. I don't even like Elizabeth Swan now. Goddamn bitch. Sansa is no longer betrothed to the Greatest Cunt in all of Westeros, but she's still his slave. Hopefully Littlefinger can get her out of there!! Renly's wife is finally getting what she wants!! Or so she thinks... I don't think Joffery will fuck her either. He'll just beat her until she dies...

Dragonstone-

Stannis is now seeing things in fire. Go figure. I've totally given up on him now. I really really thought he'd kill the red woman and END THAT SHIT. But no, she convinces him to look into a fire that I CAN'T SEE and suddenly he's back on the monotheistic bitch train...

Stark Camp-

WOOO!!! GO ROBB GO!! TRUE LOVE CONQUERS ALL!! Except the Lannisters.... ^And ^the ^Baratheons.... ^^And ^^the ^Tulleys...


Wilderness-

Brianne is a BOSS!! ... Yes she killed Starks to save Jamie... but still... 

Winterfell-

.... Theon didn't get what he deserved. He deserved death. Now the Maester is dead, and Bran and his little brother are on the run while the city burns. ""There must always be a Stark in Winterfell."" Not anymore it looks like....

Qarth-

FUCK YEAH!!! GO DANI GO!!! The sketchy warlock man is DEAD!! And how his he dead you ask? DANI'S DRAGONS!!! ""*Draconis*"" BEST SCENE IN AWHILE!!!! And not only is that creepy guy dead, but the ""king"" is now suffocating in his (FUCKING EMPTY!!!!) vault!!! Dani has her money, and her dragons, and a weak claim to the throne... I REALLY HOPE SHE GETS IT!!

Beyond the Wall....

OH.

MY.

GODS....

WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT THERE'D BE AN ENTIRE FUCKING WHITEWALKERS ARMY READY TO POUNCE!?!?!? I don't think they killed Sam... But with the way it faded out like that... I think he's as good as dead...


Well r/GOT.... That's YNBU... I'll report back after a few episodes of season 3... And I have no idea what is about to happen...

Thank you all for listening.

Yours is also appreciated if you feel the need.

As Ive watched through GoT, Ive started to notice trends in the downfall of major characters. Being the TV obsessor I am, I decided to write some things down and came up with the idea that someone (whether it was the show creators or GRRM) decided to get all Gilligans Island on us and base some of the major (and sure I guess not so major) characters on the Seven Deadly Sins. Now I know its a trope a lot of people rely on in writing, but I just thought Id share.

PRIDE - This one seems like it should be the Lannisters at first (sorryone more time. How often do you pay your debts?), but lets be real - its the Starks. Sure, theyre the closest this show has to good guys (I meanI GUESS) but that doesnt mean they dont have a weakness. Like tattle telling on the Queen Regent for instance. Or saying LOL JK Filch! Or holding a grudge against a guy for just doing his job, even after he saved your life MULTIPLE TIMES! Dick move Arya.

GREED - If the Lannisters werent going to be pride, they were clearly going to be greed (but theres a quick aside on this at the end). Hell, their family song is about how they killed a bunch of people for being ALMOST as rich as they are.

WRATH - If you get all Colonel Sanders on people via dragon, you got some anger in your blood. This one is for the Targaryans. Its not just Dani either. Her ancestors are always said to have been even more brutal. Also thats likeall thats ever said of them.

LUST - Where my Baratheons at!? I know gluttony might make more sense here, but thats only if we were talking about Robert. Think about it. Big Bob cant finish a single story without being like Oh and you know the ladies was all up on dis too. Then theres Stannis, Lord of the Most Boring Storyline. Half of his existence is just to bang the Red Woman (Melissa? Malificent?) and have a whole gaggle of shadowy rugrats. Also, my man Renly who was gettin it ON. THE. REG. from Ser Loras. Lets not forget about Gendry, who was a bastard of Robert. His whole storyline revolved around Aryas Mulan-ism, and trying to also have sex with Macaroni (seriously who cares about that character), before having leeches thrown on him. Talk about blue balls, amirite?

ENVY - This one goes out to the crusty Ironborn, the Greyjoys. Super weird name by the way. I get the grey part but theres no smiling in the Iron Islands. They get envy because all they ever talk about is how everyone else has everything. Starks have Theon. Lannisters have the crown. The Boltons have Theons favorite toy. Ugh. At least they do something about it, unlike the people who get Sloth later on. Oh and speaking of Theons favorite toy

GLUTTONY - Now, you have to think of gluttony as excess, as its meant to be about. Not just eating a lot. Both Roose and Ramsay go a little overboard on their violence, but what do expect from a house whose sigil is literally a dude that just got skinned?

SLOTH - The Arryns take this one for the simple reason that they dont do shit. Even when theres a trial, theyre like How about we just ask the 9 year old from Get Him to the Greek that I still breast feed what we should do? All they do is hang out in their castle and go crazy. There was a point in Season 4 when I was like Oh fuck yeah! Lady Arryn is about to do some shit! Shes probably gonna kill Littlefinger, torture Sansa, and then-oh, nope she got pushed out of the Moon Door Shit man, even Jon Arryn didnt do anything but die even before the show started.

As mentioned earlier, I had another pseudo-theory specific to the Lannisters

Greed - Tywin

Lust - Tyrion (At least early on)

Envy - Cersei (We see those side eyes to Margaery)

Wrath - Joffrey (I know hes a Baratheon by name but cmonhomeboy is all Lannister)

Pride - Jaime (Again, earlier on)

Sloth - Tommen (God will you DO SOMETHING!? Your brother was killing prostitutes with crossbows by the time he was wearing the crown this long. DAMN!)

Gluttony - Shit man, I dont know. Orson Lannister, the Lord of the Beetles. Hows that?

One year, 4 seasons. 

However as I've started reading AGOT, I believe it's a bit different.

At some point when Lord Commander Mormont is conversing with Tyrion Lannister they mention Summer and Winter. Apparently there have been 9 years of Summer and the world is poised to have a 10th year of Summer. 

However Summer is at an end. And Winter is Coming. After a long summer, a long winter is due, so they expect this winter to be really really long...say 9-10 years? 

My questions : 

**How does that work?** First of all, it's now Summer and yet the North is filled with snow. So when Winter comes, the North will actually be buried under snow right?? Being in the North and all.

**Secondly how much does Winter impact?** I presume temperatures drop, cold weather, snow, hail and rain. But who is affected and who isn't? Is all of Westeros covered in Snow? Or places far south like Highgarden and Dorne retain their sunny climate(like Australia for Christmas!!!) What about Essos?

**Thirdly**...well I'd just like to know more about the seasons and the weather. Maybe in later books they talk about instances of Winter or Summer and the impact it has on the World.

Thank you all! :)",3,0,False,self,,,,,

Also jon and book Ygritte relationship is really touching. In the show I wasn't sure if it was real, but in the books you can tell it most definitely was. He really did like her. 

Ramsey playing reek to infiltrate theon at winterfell. That sneaky bastard. 

Arya and her brotherhood adventures sounds like it would have made great tv but I see why they cut most of it. 

A part I did like that they changed was Tywin at harrenhal instead of Bolton. Bolton was boring and he didn't care for Arya. Arya and Tywin in the show were just awesome scenes. Everyone of them. But I would have loved to see some weasel soup.

Let me start out by saying I'm sorry for posting this here, but if I google a name to learn more I get spoilers straight away. (Season 1 spoilers in the next sentence) For example, I googled Ned stark and a suggestion came up saying *ned stark death*, so I knew he was gonna die and also when I went on his wiki it says main character in season 1, which heavily implies that he dies since he isn't in the next seasons, so it was no shock when he did.

I understand the Stark house and who the main characters are.

I understand the Lannisters and most of the main characters.

I know the targyans and how they were in power until the Baratheons took over and slaughtered all of them, besides Danerys and her brother. I know that their family was inbred and that was how they kept the dragon line pure, so Danerys is the last chance of a dragon mother.

I don't understand the family where greyjoy (the one who was helping the Starks) has now re-joined. But, I know that he is no longer with the Starks because he burnt the letter he was going to send to Robb stark.

I don't know Qarth (this place has just been introduced on the episode I'm on), some slight background information would be really appreciated.

Also, can someone explain the Baratheon house a bit more. I know that Stannis and the other one are fighting for the iron throne and they are not joining up with each other. They both have strong claims to the throne through blood, but I need to know more about each separate armies. I don't even know the names and who they are, but I can't google them to check just in case of spoilers.

Lastly, can someone explain the fire godess on one of the Baratheon sides. She just gave birth to some dark creature and I don't want to jump to conclusions until I know more about her.

If you could give me as much information as you think someone on S2E4 should know I'd be grateful. Thanks!  ",46,12,False,self,,,,,

:,(

JUST FINISHED: S3E9. *The Rains of Castamere*

Here I thought binge-watching would be FUN. I was gonna surprise you all after watching all 10 episodes in one day. Nine is more than enough. I'm so emotionally beat, I need a break...

STARKS:

OR MAYBE MORE ACCURATELY, WHAT'S FUCKING LEFT OF THEM.

Ned. Dead.

Cate. Dead.

Robb. Dead

Robb's AWESOME wife. Dead.

WALDER FREY CAN SUCK THEON GREYJOY'S DISMEMBERED MEMBER. AND GRRM IS A HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HUMAN BEING. ALL OF THIS BECAUSE ROBB BROKE AN OATH HE DIDN'T FUCKING TAKE!!!! I screamed in my own house, and my mum and dad came upstairs in a panic wondering what I was doing and if I was ok. All in all, I'm really not. 3. THREE of my favourite characters in this series are now dead. I hope Dany takes the throne and BURNS the Lannisters... At least Tywin... The smartest asshole in all of Westeros. The War for the North is over....

Sansa- WELL HERE'S THE NEXT ONE WHO IS ALIVE. And WHY is she alive? She fits into Tywin's little plan. Tyrion's new bride is (who Tywin assumes to be) the sole heir of the North. Tyrion just has to ""plant his seed"".

Arya- Now here's a predicament. Bran crippled, Sansa nearly a Lannister, Ricton way too young. The girl who was never destined to rule looks pretty damn destined to rule. I'd follow the little sassy girl into combat. She's the last hope for the Starks in my opinion. 

Bran/Bran's new buddy- Well I know what the Raven is for... sort of. Bran can see into animals... and apparently Hodor (HODOR!) is an animal... The way he reacted to thunder certainly proved that. But that's not the best talent ever... Out of the original 6 dire wolves, I'm pretty sure only 4 are left... 2 are with Bran and the other two are MIA...

Jon Snow- This entire season I've been hoping that Jon would do the right thing. He has sex with (an admittedly pretty attractive) wildling and joined them... But when it came to his honour and roots, Jon knew what to do... He ran. Why join an enemy when you can run? I thought his decision to join the wildlings was OK actually. The Watch weren't doing anything to help the situation, the wildlings were his best resort. But when it came to BEING a wildling, I knew Jon wouldn't fit in. I'm glad he didn't.

GREYJOY

Theon- I don't like what the Kastarks are doing to him, but he does deserve what he's getting in my opinion. All that shit he let happen to Winterfell just to get back with his deadbeat daddy. No sorry. I'll wince at the pain, but I have no remorse really.

**LANNISTERS**

The Hound- Yes, I'm throwing him in here. While our first meeting with him he seemed like a lapdog, he's got quite the motive and personality. I'm pretty happy with the character he's turned into... He's like Bronn without the humour... Or Arya as a grown man... :/

Tyrion- Poor, poor man. He's lost the most... except for those who lost their lives... He's lost his life in a quite different way: ""At least you're not a prisoner... But you *are* my wife... I guess that's a different prison!"" 

Twyin- GRRRRRRRRRR!!!! BRILLIANT GENIUS ASSHOLE!!!!!! I can understand why he did it... But I don't like it... AT ALL... Every single action he takes is with purpose... It's extremely methodical.

Cersei- What's her fucking deal?? Did she REALLY think that being queen-regent would give her absolute power!? Delusional bitch!!

Joffery- At first I thought he had settled down... By physically settling down with Margery Tyrell... Then I remembered a fantastic quote... ""There's no cure for being a cunt"". Fuck him too.

Jaime- (Badass Award) Poor guy... Lost his hand. Can never fight again, and he's STILL getting picked on. One of only two Lannisters I still respect... All the things he's done for Brianne... 

BARATHEON

Stannis- No hope for someone who blindly follows orders, especially if they are a claimant to the throne.

Davos- The Onion Knight released from prison, learned to read, only to watch a bastard of Robert get sucked dry by leaches... poor poor Davos...

The Red Woman- I'd say fuck her, but that seems pretty dangerous. The witch can drowned in darkness, since she likes fire so much.

TARGARYEN

Dany- I LOVE YOU DANY!!!! She's the queen Westeros deserves, but not the queen they want... I don't care. Freeing slaves? Burning slave owners? Seducing mercenaries? She is one AWESOME character!! And for easily being the best character of the season, I'm changing flairs in her honour. LONG LIVE DAENERYS TARGARYEN!! MOTHER OF DRAGONS, FREER OF SLAVES, AND THE TRUE LORD OF WESTEROS!!!!

Jorah- Still not getting the best vibe from him... He looked jealous when that merc lieutenant was talking to Dany... Does he want to get with her? Or just advise her....?

Grey Worm- Badass in his own right. Just adding for the sake of adding!!

Well r/GOT, thats YNBU. And my keyboard is soaked with emotional tears.... *Winter is Coming*... More like **was** coming...

See you all after I muster up the energy to watch the Finale.",10,5,False,self,,,,,

Lyanna Stark is his mother, I don't doubt that. The identity of the father; it could be either Robert Baratheon or Rhaegar Targaryen. 

I choose the RB+L theory, for two reasons: first, GRRM has made a point of stating that his characters beget children coloring similar to their own. But Jon doesn't match anyone. His lineage can't be proved or disproved by his coloring, but he doesn't have Stark or Targaryen coloring. Just a thought.

Secondly, is the fortune told by Maggy the Frog. When asked how many children Cersei and Robert will have, Maggy says she will have 3, and he 16. Varys admits to knowing of 8 of R's bastards, the POVers mention 5, and another 2 are mentioned in passing. That is only 15. 

We know that Robert loved Lyanna, despite his whoring. 
Even if Jon isn't the last bastard...who is it? It could always be someone of no importance...but why would GRRM, the man who writes so intricately and includes little clues that lead to every piece of plot, tell us that there are 16 bastards and then only identify 15 of them? Why would he introduce characters who are only around for a single chapter if  any other quickly forgotten character could suffice? He mentions 15 bastards, specifically. The lack of information on the 16th bastard becomes significant when you consider that GRRM has told us about all the others, even if it was just to mention that a woman in a brothel has Robert's coloring and was born to a whore after the Battle of the Bells.

Ned was accused of treason and beheaded. Sansa was constantly tormented and humiliated by Joff due to her father's and Robb's actions although she was innocent. In the books, Sansa is upset that even the common people of King's Landing hate her and tried to kill her.

In comparison, the Tyrell's aided and abetted Renly in his treason and claim for the throne. They married their daughter to Renly. The Tyrell's and Renly's forces had been marching towards King's Landing until they got distracted by Stannis, etc.

I would like to share with you some theories/scenarios/small facts about the end of a song of ice and fire, I look forward to hear yours so don't hesitate to share yours and enrich the discussion.

1. The destruction of the Iron Throne:
I have the feeling that we have greatly undermined the Iron Throne and the magical characteristics it could possess. The mad king use to bleed by cutting himself on it, what if the throne was conscious of who was sitting on it or more rationally what if the throne was part of the prophecy and needed to be destroy to end the cycle of a song and ice and fire. 

2. Dragonstone is the key
We already know that dragonglass is one of the only way to kill white walkers, I am certain (like many of us) that more dragonglass is hidden at Dragonstone and that

3. Ashai and blood-magic
I find strange that people/magic from Asshai is so central to the story (Red god, Melissandre, Dragons etc) but that we haven't seen the city yet nor do we know who is the king/head of state their. I am sure that the people of Asshai have a card to play for the control of Westeros + Essos.

4. Dragons, moar dragons:
I hope we will be able to see more dragons? Sea dragons, Ice dragons etc. ",6,2,False,self,,,,,

I'm still pissed off about that damn episode yesterday. But I found the energy to watch the Finale.

It's good to know Jamie's back. Not just because I like they guy, but because it fucks with Twyin's plan!!

Sam and Gillie. Ugh. It's an aggravating storyline to me. Sam finally shows her to the Maester and he's accepting. Great. What's MORE important is that they sent those ravens to every corner of Westeros! 

Stannis is still being a following asshole. People have said that I'll like Stannis eventually... WHEN IS EVENTUALLY!?!? Davos is only trying to help him and he nearly gets killed. Go figure. I hope both he and Robert's bastard make it out safely. 

Bran and his buddies are headed over the wall to look for a three eyed bird that may or may not exist. They're boned.

Tyrion and Sansa are married... The not-so-happy couple :p

THIS JUST IN!!! JOFFERY BARATHEON: STILL A FUCKING CUNT!!

Theon is getting tortured by Ramsey Snow... A bastard of Lord Bolton... ANOTHER traitor. And way to send his dick off to his daddy!! But Theon's daddy is too deadbeat to do anything. So his older sister is the only one who is willing to help. Very nice considering Theon fingered her when they first met.....

""A Toast to the young wolf!!"" ""He stayed young!"" ASSHOLES!!!!! :'(

Dany has worked so hard. And this season she's liberated 2 entire cities... LET'S GET HER WESTEROS!!!!!!!

Ok r/GOT, that's YNBU.... Off to Season 4!!

When it was Joffrey being way, way less cruel, it was depicted as very bad by almost all the character in the show. Yet nobody say a word about House Bolton.

What bug me the most is that he was Ned Stark banner man. Ned Stark the Honor hero has an evily cruel family as his banner men, known for flaying their enemy alive? The same guy who wanted to kill Jorah Mormont for selling slave? It just dont seem logical to me.

Jon Snow is patrolling the wall with Ghost on a fairly quiet night, no wind, Sam isn't anywhere to be seen and the land beyond the wall is quiet, it almost feels suspicious. He turns around and in the distance of the wall, he sees a strange outline of something he's never seen there before. He walks up to it and slowly realizes it's a statue. He keeps getting closer and closer and he realizes that its hands are covering the face. He wonders who put this here and Ghost has been freaking out about it ever since he noticed it. His threatening growls at it confuse Jon. ""It's only a statue."" He said.

He turns around and returns to his post looking at the location again, the statue has moved closer to him, its hands are covering its chin and it is looking straight at him. Ghost runs up to it and tries to bite it. But it is only stone. When Jon returns to the side of the statue, he puts his hand on its face and tries to turn it, nothing happens, and he is wondering if he is needing sleep, but he takes his sword and tries stabbing the statue, nothing. Returning to his post, he feels a whoosh and the statue is even closer right now, reaching out for him with a menacing face. Ghost is growling angrily at the statue and starts clawing it, that leaves some scratches, but it doesn't seem to do much. 

Jon tells Ghost to quiet, it's only a dream he says and turns around with ghost. That is a mistake and he feels a rush of wind and he is suddenly in a snowy area and it doesn't take long for him to realize he's beyond the wall. Unfortunately for him, he was spotted by three wildmen, but rather than attacking him immediately, they run up and ask ""Was there a statue around you?"" he replies yes and they all look at each other and nod their head. ""Mance told us about this, you need to come with us."" they say. Jon refuses because that means he is probably going to be a prisoner. Rather than waste important time, they knock him out and bring him to Mance.

Mance realizes that the statues are getting bolder and he has a group take Jon and teach him how to kill the statues. ""When no one can see it, it moves and that's how you kill it. We call them The Statues of Deception. We're not sure where they come from, or what they are doing. But give me a White Walker any day."" Once they reach a group of the Statues. ""Are you ready, Bastard?"" Jon at this point has realized it's not a dream and he answers No, ""No one is when they first face these, MEN, BEGIN OUR ATTACK!"" Everyone except Jon give the statue some Braveheart style taunts who just looks at everyone's rump in confusion, they all stop and turn back around, the statue looks angry. ""That pisses them off, they make mistakes, just like everyone else."" They start moving around in a circle and Jon is trying not to laugh as he watches them go about their ""attack"". 

After three rotations, they stop and thrust their swords, A clean ""TTTHK"" can be heard and the swords are inside the statue with a gray cement looking liquid coming out of them, and a strange portal opens up and a few men come out of it. ""Hand them a weapon of any kind, they'll be needed at The Wall."" One of the statues hand is nearly touching Jon's face. ""Works every time!"" The leader states as they take their swords out and kick the statues down. ""They go to scout the wall area and it looks like the Statues are invading. ""Go get Mance's army, we need to do something about this!"" But that was needless to say. Mance and his army were already there. And another scout says the Statues are getting closer to the wall. ""Bastard, my guard, and Corporal, With me! the rest of you, watch the statues."" Mance brings his small group to the wall and get the guard's attention. ""I have information regarding these statues you want to hear! And I have a prisoner of your wall."" The gate opens and they quickly get in ""CLOSE IT DAMN IT!"" Mance shouts as it closes slowly. The Statues are looking angry. 

A younger looking Jeor Mormont looks at the group and at Jon Snow. ""Who is this? He has not taken the Black Oath yet! Speak quickly Mance, or I'll have you executed right now."" Mance explains to him that Jon is a future member of The Wall and Ned Stark's Bastard. ""That bastard is only a year old. Raider, do you take me for a fool?"" Jeor asks as though he thought his intelligence was being insulted. ""Which is why I said future member! Those things grab you and take you back to the past."" Mance argues back. But before anyone can say another word. ""LORD COMMANDER!"" comes down from high atop the wall then a quick light emerges and dissipates. ""What is it, Corporal."" Jeor demands. But the reply comes from behind Mance. ""You need to look at the Statues, they're up to something."" Corporal comes from the back and Jeor notices that the man who just spoke looks exactly like the man up there and chooses to accept what's going on. ""How do we kill them?"" He asks and Mance brings himself, Jeor, and Jon up to the top to deal with the Statue there. Once everyone in the Wall is taught the strange way of killing the Statues, everyone except the gate keeper enters the field of Statues  and join with Mance's army. As the Battle beings, more and more portals open up as the Statues die and their victims pop out return to the safety of the wall. It wasn't a long time before Jon's Statue was killed and he is taken back to his time. 

""The Battle went well."" Jeor tells him, ""We put the Statues into a fire and burnt their bodies. Corporal died a few years ago in his sleep. and Mance went back to his ""kingdom"" 

Deep in Mance's kingdom, there lies a single captive Statue who's bonds are enchanted to prevent it from moving and  is left to blind guards with direwolves. Their orders are to kill the beast if the wolves growl at them.

In season two, the Hound saves Sansa Stark's life when the Kings Landing was in peril (when the King got a cow-pie thrown in his face). After the Hound saves Sansa, Tyrion says ""Good job Hound"" and he replies with ""I didn't do it for you"".

Later in the series, he goes on to adventure with Arya Stark. 

Does the Hound have some form of an allegiance to the Starks..? Or is there just a soft spot in him for the Stark girls?

I'd like to think the first but most likely the answer is the latter. Thanks for any clarification.

But seeing the other side of the argument... Why didn't anyone help him? I mean Jaime and Cercei didn't help either, they just cried over him. The Tullys didn't help, even Tywin just sat there. But after all the shit he did to Tyrion I can understand why he just sat there and watched him choke. 

Joffery with his last breath determined that Tyrion did it... I really really hope he doesn't die.... A cunt is dead... Let's not kill a good character too...

House Bolton actually isn't as bad as I thought. At least Lord Bolton is pretty cool. He's a younger Tywin Lannister. His bastard Ramsey is a twisted son of a bitch.... Theon should've cut his throat when he had a chance...

Arya and her Hound are carving their way through the Riverlands. And the little girl has her sword back!!

The Red Woman is out killing more Baratheons. I think she's trying to kill every Baratheon... Stannis, his daughter, and Gendry are the only 3 left... and his daughter may be next... :/

Bran is headed outside the wall... and apparently he knows where he's going... They're gonna get lost or killed by wildlings... I can feel it...

Jon Snow is being a boss like usual, he got to talk down to the quartermaster... FINALLY!! And the Targaryen Maester is taking his side. That blind guy is just getting cooler and cooler!!

I'm currently reading ADWD myself, so I'm not 100% up to date with everything. Also, I don't know if maybe some of you have already posted similar speculations, I'm not all that active in here.

So, about Lady Stoneheart.
Many of us, myself included, expected her to be the cliffhanger for season 4. Then Michelle Fairley gave reason to believe that she might not appear at all. I still think she could be our Episode 9 WTF-moment of the next season. There aren't that many moments like in the previous books/seasons in AFFC for this, and actually, I think it makes sense in terms of dramaturgy. Lady Stoneheart really doesn't do all that much in the books and doesn't appear again until the end of AFFC. On second thoughts, introducing her equally early in the show killing Freys only to hold her back until the end of the next season could confuse some people. So I think episode 9 could end with the reveal of Lady Stoneheart which would put her interactions with Brienne and the hanging of the latter in episode 10 for a dramatic and shocking ending of the season. 

I have also recently read (sorry, I lost the source but I'm sure it was somewhere in this subreddit) that Jaqen is about to show up again, even though he apparently doesn't in the books. I think he could replace the kindly man from the books or at least would be the same person with a different face. He could act as Arya's trusted person or mentor in Braavos and the audience would have a beloved face back. That thought in addition to the news that Thomas Wlaschiha is about to show up again makes sense to me.

Does any of this make sense to you? :D Would you be happy with an outcome like this for the next season?",22,5,False,default,,,,,

After completing season 4, I was itching for content so I decided it was time I picked up the books.
I just finished A Game Of Thrones and have started A Clash Of Kings.

I've found that a benefit of watching the show first is that I have a understanding of the greater details and have faces to put to names, allowing me to better appreciate and understand the minor details and to easier visualize a scene as I read. 
I often have aha! moments when I suddenly understand the reasoning behind a characters later actions or when I come across foreshadowing for later events. 

Of course, knowing major plot details ahead of the time takes away some of the thrill, and I can only read while cringing waiting for a horrible event to occur. 
Though reading events that were not portrayed in the show sweetly scratches my itch for content.
I also find it interesting as I notice differences in how things are played out in the show and the books.

For those of you who've read the books first, does it take away from your show watching experience?
I've often come across character descriptions (such as Jorah Mormont) whose depictions on the show are totally different than in the books. 
Did these types of things bother you as you watched the show?
Does it bother you when the show adds dialogue and events that did not occur in the books?

For those of you who've watched the show first, like myself, do you have similar feelings?

Any discussion is welcome and appreciated!

According to [Game of Thrones Wiki](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Bastardy#Terminology):

&gt; Bastard surnames are dependent on the region a child was born in, i.e. where the mother is from, not where the father is from. For example, a noble lord from the Stormlands could father one bastard child in the Vale, and another in the Riverlands, but neither would use the surname ""Storm"": the first bastard would use the surname ""Stone"", and the second would use the surname ""Rivers."" It is extremely unusual for a bastard to know who his nobleman father is, but not his mother.

An exception to this rule Obara Sand (Areo Hotah was the first to refer to her that way in ADWD, the second page of his chapter), the oldest of the Sand Snakes, whose mother is an 'Oldtown whore' but has the the Sand surname. There is also Sansa's false identity, Alayne Stone. Her mother is supposed to be from Braavos, but she still has the Stone surname, of the Vale. Another bastard from the books is Mya Stone, and she does have the surname Stone, because her mother is from the Vale but her father is from the Stormlands/King's Landing.

She had been imprisoned there for a while under Twin Lannister, keeping her identity a secret since the Lannisters are obviously enemies and all that. However, in the books Roose Bolton takes over Harrenhall after Tywin leaves while Arya is still imprisoned there. I was wondering why she didn't think to tell Roose Bolton who she was, especially since she became his serving girl and had quite a bit of time with him.

Obviously, Bolton proves himself quite untrustworthy later on, but Arya doesn't know that at the time. All she knows is that he's a north-man fighting for her brother. From her perspective it would seem reasonable to assume she could reveal her identity to him and expect him to have her taken back to her family. Instead, Arya keep her identity a secret and the book (as far as I could tell) didn't really give a good explanation for why she doesn't trust him. 

The best I could find after some digging was some ancient bad blood between the Starks and the Boltons, going back to when the North was an independent kingdom. But that wouldn't seem as relevant at the time, I would think, and Arya doesn't even mention it. Did anyone pick up on a reason for her mistrust of him that I missed? Did she just get a bad feeling about this dude?",13,9,False,self,,,,,

I think that this may suggest 2 things: 1) both horns will be cut from the show, and 2) Victarion will be cut from the show.

This can be explained in several ways.  The horn that Jon &amp; co. found in season 2 is theorized to be the true Horn of Winter, but in the case that this theory is true in the books, it could easily be disregaded in the show if D&amp;D decide to cut the horns since no attention was directed at that horn in the show.  Also, the absence of Euron's horn would line up with the theory that Victarion will be cut from the show, since that horn was integral to Victarion's journey.

First thought is the episode where Lady Tyrrell and Margaret question Sansa to know more about Joffrey and how crule he is she remarks how much she loves lemon cakes. The other I recall is when she goes with Petyr Baelish to the Vale and Lysa offers Sansa lemon cakes before accusing her of having relations with Pyter. 

Those are just the few that come to mind, please tell me of any I may be missing, I just think it's so funny.",13,8,False,self,,,,,

Incompetent kings that really don't give a crap about kingdoms, advisers that what seems their life is dedicated to plotting and nothing more, and all people instead of making communities that prosper, work against each other because of beefs that usually are created of superstitions and extreme greed. I think if not trade they would all kill each other, because there would be no reason to work together.

I like series, but really, is it worth in this world to be as greed and lustful as most people seem to be? What can you acquire with all that wealth and power all man are fighting for? Whores and gold?; Because as far as I can see you don't have many comforts or technology that is worth all this violence. The further in the show, the more it shows that almost everyone is creating drama and conflict just because they have nothing else to do, or because they hold grudges couple hundred year old.

Everyone fights for Iron Throne, but really what is the benefit of it? Plotting for the rest of your life as a ruler to not be killed by everyone surrounded by you?

Here's the story she was referring to, as was told in A Clash Of Kings by Tormund to Jon shortly after meeting him in Mance's camp. This is why I love Tormund (and his member  O.o ) so much.

____________________________________________________________________


Are all crows so curious? asked Tormund. Well, heres a tale for you. It were another winter, colder even than the one I spent inside that giant, and snowing day and night, snowflakes as big as your head, not these little things. It snowed so hard the whole village was half buried. I was in me Ruddy Hall, with only a cask o mead to keep me company and nothing to do but drink it. The more I drank the more I got to thinking about this woman lived close by, a fine strong woman with the biggest pair of teats you ever saw. She had a temper on her, that one, but oh, she could be warm too, and in the deep of winter a man needs his warmth.

The more I drank the more I thought about her, and the more I thought the harder me member got, till I couldnt suffer it no more. Fool that I was, I bundled meself up in furs from head to heels, wrapped a winding wool around me face, and set off to find her. The snow was coming down so hard I got turned around once or twice, and the wind blew right through me and froze me bones, but finally I come on her, all bundled up like I was.

The woman had a terrible temper, and she put up quite the fight when I laid hands on her. It was all I could do to carry her home and get her out o them furs, but when I did, oh, she was hotter even than I remembered, and we had a fine old time, and then I went to sleep. Next morning when I woke the snow had stopped and the sun was shining, but I was in no fit state to enjoy it. All ripped and torn I was, and half me member bit right off, and there on me floor was a she-bears pelt. And soon enough the free folk were telling tales o this bald bear seen in the woods, with the queerest pair o cubs behind her. Har! He slapped a meaty thigh. Would that I could find her again. She was fine to lay with, that bear. Never was a woman gave me such a fight, nor such strong sons neither.

As stated in the title, alcohol was involved so I make some sweeping proclamations in the conversation that I don't actually hold to. For example, I don't really think the Greyjoy storyline is a narrative mistake. I do however, dislike them as characters and am mystified by Victarion's popularity. Here it is:

Me 6/5, 7:14pm
Ok if we're airing our grievances with GRRM here's my opinion: The Greyjoys are a fucking mistake. Narratively, their role is fine until AFFC, after that, I feel like he wasted hundreds of pages on completely worthless characters. Lets talk about them in ascending order: Theon: Interesting due more to circumstances than personality Asha: Actually I like her. Aeron: Humorless religious zealot whose God has shown no real power or influence. I hope he drowns in a puddle.

Me 6/5, 7:18pm
Victarion: Meathead with no moral compass. He will burn innocent ppl alive to gain magic powers so he can have revenge on his older brother. Why does he want revenge? BC his brother fucked his wife. What was Victarions response? Think mean thoughts about his brother and MURDER HIS WIFE. I don't care if it's the ""Ironborn Culture"" Victarion is a cunty cunt cunt who just happens to swing an axe well.

Me 6/5, 7:19pm
Euron: One eyed and sexy, but a complete sociopath with no redeeming qualities as of yet. He may play an important role and he's colorful, but all of his actions so far suggest he's an evil shit Balon: Has all of Tywin Lannister's emotional deafness but none of his intelligence. I'm glad he's dead. Falling off a bridge was too good for him Plus I fucking despise the Ironborn culture. ""But they're like Vikings!"" Fuck that. If you make a religion out of raping and pillaging (like the Vikings or the Ironborn) you're a simple-minded cunt. Fuck the iron born, fuck the Vikings, fuck the mongols, fuck the oakland raiders.

Him 6/5, 7:40pm
Wait wait ok I read all this. I'm on my phone so I'll give a real respond later. But you're wrong about victarion if only for that bad motherfucking boat fight Yes You are

Me 6/5, 7:41pm
So he's a good fighter. HE BURNED A BUNCH OF GIRLS ALIVE because he thought it would give him magic powers. He's a fuckhead. What's worse: He's a dumb fuckhead.

Me 6/5, 7:44pm
At least when Stannis does shitty stuff, he believes he's doing it for the greater good. Victarion does shitty stuff for personal glorification. Talking up that boat fight is like saying: ""Yeah, it was shitty that Michael Vick did that whole dog-fighting thing, but he's such a tremendous athlete I can't help but like him.""

Him 6/5, 7:52pm
What greater good is stannis working for? Eh? Eh? Something other than personal gain? Eh?

Me 6/5, 7:55pm
Stannis believes he's Azor Ahai and that he will save the world from the long night (in which the White Walkers will overrun the world) He may be wrong but he is convinced. He even talks about how he doesn't want to be king. He just IS the King due to birth order

Me 6/5, 8:07pm
The show has kind of dropped the ball in Stannis. He seems power hungry. The books make it clear that he's driven by a sense of duty, not desire. He believes he's saving the world. Euron and Victarion Greyjoy have no such defense. Aeron might but he's religious to he point of stupidity.

Me 6/5, 8:27pm
How's that for ""Eh?""

Him 6/5, 11:02pm
Your argument for Stannis' actions sounds like Hitler. And I'm not defending the ironborn they're an interesting side group. They were important in the sense that they destroyed winterfell and had everyone believing that Bran was dead victarion shits excellence and you'll not change my mind some people have to be burned alive and so what, the all gracious khaleesi crusified like 3000 people without trial stannis is cookin bitches left and right for a religion he doesn't even believe in beer spelling crucified well he kinda does nvm you cant tell me what to think https://i.imgur.com/rlnmXJX.gif

Me 6/5, 11:08pm
You pulled the Hitler card. Lazy.
I never defended the actions of Danerys, so that is immaterial.

Me 6/5, 11:11pm
Stannis (in the books) never burned anyone for their religious allegiance. In fact, he told Melisandre to go fuck herself when she suggested it. Also, when she wanted to burn Edric Storm, he told her that if it didn't work he'd kill her because he was so against killing his nephew

Me 6/5, 11:14pm
And while I defend Stannis, I recognize that he's a douchebag. But he's a douchebag I can respect. Victarion may be metal as fuck. But he suuuuuuuucks. Seriously, fuck Victarion. I can't wait for Drogon to eat him and then burp his corpse onto Euron and kill him, thereby ending the greyjoy line.
Because the Greyjoys contribute nothing good to the world. Theyre just a nuisance. They lack the morality of the Starks, the intelligence of the Lannisters, the sexiness of the Martells, and the bad-assness of the baratheons. In short: They suck ass and take valuable page time away from better characters. I can't believe you were bitching about Oberyn being gone and then enjoying a tool like Victarion.

Me 6/5, 11:34pm
Oh and while we're at it: ""all gracious khaleesi crusified like 3000 people without trial."" I agree, bad thing to do. But your comparison is flawed. Her reason: These social eletes crucified innocent children who they regarded as property. They did so without discrimination, only the requirement that they were slaves and therefore objects rather than people. I don't argue that applying that same logic was intelligent or right or good, but it was justice on some level. Victarion burning those girls was not. They did nothing to deserve that. He did it because he was led to believe it would give him power. Dany did what she did (however foolishly) for justice against those who had tortured innocents. Vicatarion did what he did to get back at his big brother who.......oh he fucked his wife. Then it was VICTARION who murdered her. Metal as.......nothing. Victarion can win sea battles. He's still a pussy and I can't wait to see him die

I think I may have made an assumption that, when I see the reactions of other show-only fans, may not have been intended. In ep.4x10, Jaime helps Tyrion escape and guides him out of the Red Keep in a way that just so happens to reveal the Shae-Tywin betrayal. Then there's that particularly accessible crossbow, which even Tyrion could easily reach.

I came to the conclusion that Jaime intended Tyrion to find out about Shae, with the ultimate goal of having Tyrion kill Tywin. Given the 'I DON'T CARE' scene between Jaime and Cersei earlier in the episode, I figured it was the two of them working together to remove both their controlling father and meddling brother from King's Landing. From what I understand of the book's description of the scene, the box Tyrion uses to reach the crossbow seems conspicuously placed there, by an unknown party.

So, is that what the show was trying to imply? I guess it could have been another mastermind behind the coincidences, but given how total Cersei's control will be at the start of season 5, and how disastrous that will be for almost every other established character, I can't really entertain any other options.",23,4,False,self,,,,,

What strikes me as outstanding about it most of all is that even in the settings where a person, the sort of person like Littlefinger who you expect would be taking on these mannerisms in order to re-enforce a certain image on himself in the eyes of the powerful folk he wants to manipulate, even in the settings where this sort of person would let their guard down and show their true selves... He doesn't. That stance, those postures, the way his hands are never relaxed... Are these things that get mentioned often when the character is described in the books?

I was beyond ill-prepared for what followed. That had to be the most brutal thing I had ever seen in my life. I sat there, in shock for what felt like hours.

before you read this, you should probably know that it's mailnly going to involve allot of phycology, so you can skip straight to the second chapter of the blog or whatever you want to call it if you already know froyds theory about children's labido. the first is just a brief explenation of the oedipus complex.

the oedipus complex- only read if you don't fully know what it is
--------------------------------------------------------------
unlike what many people before froyd thought about chilldren and how they're all innocent and shit, froyd's work showed that children much like adults had sexual lust. now this might be offending to some people but you, your sister your mother and everyone else, wanted to fuck your parent of the opposite sex. yes it sounds gross but it's true, sexual desires are a part of the id(not gonna get in to what that is) that exist all your life. a child's sexual desires are very delicate and sophisticated and that's why something as small as hearing adults having sex or an explenation about sex can fuck up a child and cause trauma and fetishes and shit. basically, in a nutshell, what froyd said was that boys fall in love with the mother, want to kill the father and fuck the mother, then feel guilty for wanting to do so because they also love the father, then feel guilty about wanting to fuck the mother and suppressed everything that happened (at around the age of 6) that's why you don't remember any of it. 


the actuall interesting shit about game of thrones
------------------------------------------------
so, this is not a explenation about ALL of the storylines, only the one with terion. 
let me start by saying George R.R. martin does not kill people for fun, all deaths are fundemental for the plot. so at first I thought that he did the whole dramatic ""killing everyone"" exit for terion to make him more of a wanted criminal as he leaves the castle, but then I thought a bit more. 


let me start by tellin you what I want to prove to you, and then explain why; what I want to prove is that shae (or however you spell that shit) is a representation of terion's mother, now before you go around saying I'm looking for a deep meaning where there is none look at what happened.

terion killed his mother, and a child has some stages of understanding death.


childeren up untill the age of three or two will think of death as some kind of kind of place from which you can return and shit, this links directly to what happens to both shae and his mother.
he ""sends shae away"". as he thought he did his mother before understanding what death really is. 
he often asks questions about her regards, as he asked about his mother when he was young, thinking she will one day return.

there's allot of other stages that children go through when it comes to understanding death but that's not relevant.

terion sleeps with her- directly goes to the oedipus complex and how children want to sleep with their mother and kill their father.

terion kills her - this is a obvyous one. at a sertain age he understood what he has actually done to his mother.

terion kills his father- also obyous one. oedipus and shit.

SO! this leaves the interesting part to speculation! 
why did george make terion's childhood repeat itselfe? 
I personally think he did it tot illustrate how his mother is what really made his father kill him, like when she is on the stand as the finall witness, the finall thing that makes his father want to kill him. 
but there might be someother reasons or shit.



The End.

In no order, she let the Kingslayer go in hopes to getting her daughters back when they had no clue of Arya basically giving away the north's biggest piece. She in all honesty was the one who started the war by taking Tyrion Lannister in what basically was a heat of the moment choice then by ned taking the blame for it there became a bigger target on his back then there already was. Then losing tryion was costly because when they didnt have tryion there was nothing stopping Ned's ending, I know that choice ultimately fell on Joffery cause orginally they were just gonna send him to Castle Black.

He also needed a king he could manipulate easily and Joff was beginning to show he was REALLY not that king. Plus I am sure a man who would take his father's job into his own hands and wipe out an entire house (Reyne) purely to keep his own family strong and in power, would balk at the chance for the head of his dynasty to be an absolute monsterous and abhorrent wastrel that cannot keep his own city in coin and food. Long story short, Joff was everything Tywin was not except maybe cruel although Tywin was probably more harsh than cruel. So Tywin offed him and used it as a chance to validly remove Tyrion from his lineage by having him sent to The Wall (because I do not think Tywin would have actually killed Tyrion unless his hand was forced) and install Jaime as his heir whilst also putting a play-king on the Iron Throne that could be casually manipulated into any image Tywin wanted. Olenna on the other hand just wanted Joff gone because he was evil and marrying her granddaughter. It also explains Tywin's almost, dissapointment, at Tyrion's request for trial by combat because it threw all of his own plans out of the window. Thoughts?",15,0,False,self,,,,,

Many characters, from various walks of life (though admittedly largely noble) and many different cultures and places. But what I realized last night is how little the economic-socio-political background has been discussed. 


As far as I can remember, the word 'tax' is not mentioned at all in the show or in any of the first few books (as far as I've gotten). Nor is serf. Slavery is discussed at various points, but that seems to be the extent of it. Much is implied, such as the apparently feudal structure of Westeros, but there's a lot left to the imagination.


Did GRRM do this intentionally so as to not constrain himself to any one political/economic/etc. system? Did he not think of it? Or did he just not think it was interesting enough to include? For a series in which politics and money play such important roles, one would think it'd be important to know where the money comes from and how the basic social and political system is laid out.",11,0,False,self,,,,,

Your blood will spill and your skull will crack
From the front, as a king never slays from the back
I am King Robert Baratheon
I will crush your city like a bull in heat
and lay the broken pieces at your feet
You will all name me your king
or my great warhammer will sing
A song of blood, death, and fires
The streets will run red with the blood of the liars
I am King Robert Baratheon
Once the wolf and the stag made their laws
But are now both caught in the lions jaws
I sit in the castle of a traitor
and the mead pushes the thought back till later
the crown is heavy and heavier, the cost
seven kingdoms cant ease the love I lost
I am King Robert Baratheon
my name would have made you shiver in fear
yet here I lay, feeling it all disappear
My brothers fight and my friend lies slain
the blood I spilt had all been in vain
the throne I took ruined in hurry
I weep, for ours was the fury.",0,1,False,default,,,,,

They would rather have sent him to The Wall, so as not to provoke The North even further. However what would prevent Ned in returning to Winterfell instead of going to Castle Black. Here he could call his banners, and join up with Stannis in an attempt to crown Stannis. Ned has his obsession with honor, but if Joffrey sentences him to take the black, would he really have to do it seeing as Joffrey is not his rightful liege in any way? So instead of allowing Ned to start a rebellion Joffrey has his head chopped off, which also prevents Ned from telling the truth about Joffreys heritage (I know Joffrey didn't know either). This seems to me as the smartest thing to do.
 There is probably a flaw in my thought-process from last night, but I want you guys' opinion on this!

I have started to make a Text Based GoT RPG, and was wondering if anyone here would be interested in it? Or if there was already one going. Mine would be set in sort of an alternate world to the current stories of the show and book series, with the same houses but different characters, created by members and moderated by me. Unfortunately I can only have 14 different houses. Major events in the world would run on a ""roll of the dice"" kind of system, in that people can sign up their characters for these 'events' and an outcome for said characters and event are decided by admins, moderators or by a randomiser. At least one of the outcomes, in true GoT style, would be a gruesome gory death. 

Anyway, would anyone be interested in helping out with this or perhaps joining the site if I get it going? 

Thanks

Nevertheless, please help!



**Jon Snow:**

Did he died?

Seriously though, was he killed or is it simply up to speculation if he is alive/dead? 


**Stannis the Mannis + Mance:**


Is there a confirmation that what the Boltons wrote in the letter (They are dead etc etc) is true or is it up to speculation if they are alive/dead?


**Rhaegal/Viserion:**

Did they stay in the city or not? I recall that one of them nested ontop a pyramid and that they are *eating* the beasts in the fighting pits, but do they actually live in the city (as in sleep etc etc)


**Semi off-topic White Walkers + Wights:**

What happened to the white walker army Sam saw at the end of season 2 (?), are we to assume they are slowly descending upon the wall? Is that scene even in the books?


Thanks in advance!

|Discuss your reactions to the episodes with perspective from the whole show. Talk about details you missed the when you first watched the show. Point out foreshadowing details that you noticed. Discuss an actor who is totally nailing their part (or not). In general, what did you think about the episodes and where the story is going? Book vs. Show comparisons are welcome, but you need to use spoiler tags for any book differences that do not appear in the show.|

* **This thread is scoped for SEASON 4 SPOILERS** - Turn away now if you have not seen all of the episodes! Open discussion of all aired TV events up to and including episode 4.10 is ok without tags.

And then they kill that Crastor guy, and some fookin legend takes over .. And after that I'm still really lost. Why do Jon and the wildlings climb the wall? Who is the guy in Crastor's Keep now?

* Back to the Circular room with Daenerys' dragons in tow.

The snowed over throne room is clear foreshadowing of the coming winter, but what could the warlocks of Qarth know? Their magic is enhanced by Dany's dragons, are their powers enhanced by the return of the White Walkers as well? Can they sense what is stirring in the North? They also see the Wall. 

Another thing, their illusion of Drogo acts surprisingly like Drogo. We all know that it isnt real, and the fake Drogo spends no time trying to fake Dany into thinking that it is, but how did they make such a lifelike impression?

However, what is clear is that the manpower he's devoting to the North is insignificant in the bigger spectrum of ruling the throne.  Who is going to attest to his claim of being the only King who even responded to the call? The Night's Watch? It is clear that the entirety of Westeros does not care for them as much as they do playing a game of thrones. They have not seen the white walkers and even if there was regard for them being real, they are too focused on internal bickering to even care about a ""victory for the realm.""  

My best bet is that even though Stannis is in close proximity to the rest of the North and may be able to impress their lords if and only if he can drive out the Flayed Men, he is fighting a war with two sides encroaching against his men ultimately leading to severe casualties on his side, ultimately leading to his defeat as the prospect of following a reduced and shriveled army. He will die or be betrayed by Melisandre and her prophecy as soon as both find a more suitable host in John Snow as GRRM isn't in the business of making prophecies come true in a predictable fashion. He's basically fighting for a fairytale claim and has become more delusional than his former self who was more realistic and pragmatic.  

Drogon has only landed Dany near the Khals intending for them to rape Dany or punish her for locking up his brothers, using them as torturers for his revenge.  We assume too much about the morality of Dragons, creatures that for their time on Essos, were allowed to roam free, be as vicious as they wanted to, and all because Dany allowed it.  Taking away that freedom would in turn make them hold her in contempt especially with Drogon who has outwitted her and his kin by simply roaming Essos.  Even if he saw her defend his brother, again, dragons are in a unique position where GRRM gives them ambiguous intelligence and awareness which ultimately makes their morality perhaps more alien to our own. There is always a possibility he weighs his mother's want to imprison him/his brothers as a crime that cannot be washed away. 
So ends Daenerys.  

Young Griff has the best chance at the throne at this position.  The confusion/internal strife of the other lords, a huge claim being a Targaryen regardless of whether this will be proven false (how would it anyhow), Stormland keeps, Stormland people who may sway to his cause simply because of his birth, and most of all, Cersei has severely undermined the Lannister's superiority and reputation making their hold on other kingdoms less dominating.  From a strategic standpoint, Young Griff may win it all. 

Cleganebowl may happen, but it depends how much of the infection has whittled out of Sandor's bloodwork.  If I had to bet on a winner, I would choose Gregor aka Robert Strong as the clear winner as his zombified state seems to not have any effect on his physical prowess from before while Sandor doesn't have the luxury of Lannister healthcare as he was cared for by Monks. He will die a different man though.  I believe it might be a heartwarming finale to his arc as he dies a changed man, deciding his death rather than having this one option stripped from him due to sickness.  

Tyrion might be able to govern Westeros from afar in Essos as his genius affords him a unique advantage.  If he can hold off the slavers against Barristan Selmy, he may be able to control politics world-wide as he is vastly superior in political intrigue than Jorah, Selmy, or Dany.  His shadow would rule not only the seven kingdoms, but the East as well given it's from the sidelines.  If you look at Dany's trusted court, not one of them has his skill for politics making that seat open for him when he arrives with his mercenaries. 

If the Drogon theory is true, Jorah will have the saddest tale of all. He will probably search for Daenerys in horselord territory like a Hollow from Dark Souls.  Either he finds out what the Khals have done or he is driven to madness with his singular goal at finding his love. 

And that is what I can gather so far. What do you think /r/?

Touched by the flame, SANDOR CLEGANE!

He's the weapon to step in to save all the lords

isn't a ser, 'cause only cunts name their swords!

He's no hound to impound, all his enemys downed

Only weakness is fire, no other was found.

[Sung:]

Sees a pretty little bird he! makes! it! sing!

when he steps in the ring he! makes! it! sing!

FUCK THE KINGSGUARD, FUCK THE CITY, FUCK! DA! KING!

[Boxing Announcer:] And in this corneeeeer

[MC Petyr:]

If bigger is better, he is the best,

Mountain first rides, and kills all the rest

Hear Elia going beggar, doesn't stop the Gregor!

There are no maybe's, not even for the babies;

Killing Vipers of Dorne just gives him the horn,

A spear in his chest nothing more than a thorn.

3) Jon/Ygritte/Wildlings/Mance Raider
4) Theon/Ramsay/Roose Bolton

7) Jaimee/Brienne

The idea is that we analyze/criticize a whole season of a show each podcast, and work our way through the whole series. We work our way through a 3 show rotation (HIMYM, GoT, Sherlock) and try to figure out what the best episodes are.

This seems to be a pretty contentious issue in the GoT/ASOIAF community. I was introduced to ASOIAF by GoT, and for the first three seasons I watched before I read. For season 4, I decided to read first, so I've experienced both.


Reading definitely has some advantages, providing greater insight into the characters and the background of the world. BUT, I've found that I vastly prefer watching first. Several moments of the show left me with my jaw on the floor, absolutely shell shocked. A Storm of Swords (the only book I read before watching) definitely had some shocking moments, but I found that I wasn't affected nearly to the same extent by reading the events as I would have been by watching. And, when I later watched the events, they didn't have the same impact on me.

After season 4 concluded, I set out to reread the entire series and I started AFFC yesterday. 

I have to say, I'm literally power-reading at this point. It has me completely and utterly gripped, the first Arya chapter in particular had my jaw on the floor at how intriguing and descriptive it was. It also is readily apparent beginning in AFFC how much stronger GRRM's prose becomes. I find it much more fluid and eloquent, if at times throughout the first three books where it could almost be called ""choppy.""

I've heard people say it's because it leaves out a few of the best characters. And? 

Lets recount what it gives us:

- Awesome insight into Dorne and the Iron Islands: I find the culture shock / differing customs to be fascinating contrasted against what we know of the rest of Westeros to this point
- The Sand Snakes - nuff said
- The first taste of boss-man Snow (first Sam chapter is surreal with the confident and self-assured Jon Snow dialogue we get)
- Arya. Fucking Arya. &lt;3 
- Cersei POV aka ""bitchmode engaged"" Love it
- Brienne POV, she's nothing if not unique amongst all the characters in this story, and I find both her honor and integrity compelling

I remember enjoying the book. On the reread, I'm *loving* it. Perhaps as much as to call it my 2nd favorite in the series, behind only ASOS. I really don't get what people didn't like about it? Unless it was just misplaced anger at the delay between ASOS and AFFC + it not containing a few characters?",9,0,False,self,,,,,

This might sound a little soapboxy so I'm sorry if it comes off wrong.

I think I'm the only one but when I read the description of the Targs it didn't necessarily mean they all looked like the image of a Manga character.

[Google Search for Rhaegar](https://www.google.com/search?q=rhaegar+targaryen&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UIjOU_e9KYuWyATgv4CwDw&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=2144&amp;bih=1030&amp;dpr=0.9)

http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Rhaegar_Targaryen

http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Rhaegar_Targaryen

Most artist depiction makes Rhaegar look like a vampire. By this point the Targs have been Westerosi for hundreds of years. For other characters Beards and Burliness are assumed. For Rhaegar artists always make him effeminate.

Beautiful for a man doesn't mean he necessarily has Feminine features.

He was a man well trained, heavily armed and incredibly skilled but he's always depicted as slender, dainty or in his traditional ""Castlevania Dracula"" look people always give him.

He was greatly respected in Westeros by many of the mightiest houses and individuals with strong wills.

Everyone makes his armor look awesome, as it should. But to me Rhaegar would be reeking Westeros. Yes still Targ-ish but nobody ever represents him as manly as he would have needed to have been for these great lords and throngs of people to revere him.

Even in artist depictions of the battle of the Trident it looks like Rhaegar took the time out of his day to get a nice close shave before Robert met him in the river. It really doesn't make a lot of sense to me.

His dad also had a pretty epic beard according to lots of artists.

http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130416022023/gameofthrones/images/c/c0/Kingslayer.png 


I really just want to see a few good images of Rhaegar where he doesn't look completely out of place.

I could be missing a few major points to his character, but I'm almost finished with ADWD and nothing I've read coupled with anything I've seen on the show has led to anything other than Rhaegar was incredibly handsome, very skilled, beloved by many etc etc etc. Nothing says ""Oh BTW he looks like he jumped out of a Japanese comic book""

3256,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2014-7-23,2014,7,23,5,2bfcm6,self.gameofthrones,[Spoilers All] Just now finished ADWD. I am just trying to make sure I'm totally understanding what is happening by the end of ADWD. A bunch of questions.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/2bfcm6/spoilers_all_just_now_finished_adwd_i_am_just/,[deleted],1406059418,"If you don't want spoilers, you've come to the wrong place.

OK.  Here goes.  I've officially read the books but I have a really spotty memory of a few key points and need a little clarification.


* **THE NORTH** - Theon makes it to Stannis' camp and meets up with his sister.  Later Stannis' army may be broken and defeated (but unconfirmed).  Jon gets a pissed off letter from Ramsay and Jon rallies the troops to march on Winterfel against Ramsay.  Jon is betrayed and attacked by brothers and presumed tragically wounded or dead.  Do we still not know why he was attacked for sure?  Do we know who organized the betrayal?  It obviously brought to fruition one of M's visions and I assume she will have something to do with Jon probably not being dead in TWOW.  Is Hardhome being left for dead?  With Jon (Seemingly) out of the picture, wouldn't the wildlings overrun the watch?

* **KINGS LANDING** - Is it clear at what point Cercei's downfall happened?  From what I recall it pretty much jumps from her pulling the strings to her imprisoned.  Was how the house of cards fell detailed?  It obviously wasn't Varys' doing.  Varys' appears to be working for Cercei by the end, but he's doing everything ""For the Realm"".  How does his helping Cercei and his apparent loyalty to Aegon mesh?  Wouldn't that be a direct contradiction?  The appearance of ""the Children"" in the rookery with V also sent me through a bit of a loop.  Varys is working WITH the children and Cercei to put Aegon on the throne?  Who's skull was sent to Dorin Martell?  They said it was the mountain but Ser Robert Strong seems to be The Mountain Reborn.  You would think if there was another gigantic knight in Westeros, he would have been mentioned before Cercei's walk.  My head hurts.  

* **THE LANNISTERS** Where the fuck are Jamie and Brienne going?  I assume they would have been going to the Aerie, but if Sandor has her would this all be a trap by Littlefinger?  What is the time passage from the point of the Hound left for dead to the Brienne/Jamie encounter?  Where are the Second Sons headed with Tyrion and Jorah?  I hope GRRM keeps making new Lannisters to Kill.  With Mace consolidating his power in Kings Landing and Kevin gone what is to stop the Tyrells from usurping the throne and forgiving Marg of all of her accusations?  Why If Varys is working for Cercei why would he allow Lannister power to be shaken so badly?

* **Starks**  Do we know whats happening with Rickon?  Is Bran just kind of doomed to stare out of trees for the rest of his life?  Arya is coming along nicely (the one fucking storyline I was right about the whole time minus the being a cunt to the hound and leaving him for dead bit).  Was Sansa completely kept out of this book?  I don't recall reading anything about her.  

* **Dany** Barriston the Badass helped stage a coup.  Frog is dead.  The council is getting ready to attack the besiegers.  Dany flew off on Drogon.  The other Dragons are free but still remain relatively close to the city and nobody knows WTF to do about them.  Dany is on the edge of death but seems to be bonding with Drogon.  Who exactly did she run into again?  My brain is pulled in too many places to make sense of everything yet.

* **Cat** - Other than being assholes in Winterfel the Freys storyline hasnt progressed much farther than the red wedding except popping up here and there as a kind of show of the power of the Twins.  I was expecting a little bit of exposition regarding Lady Stoneheart or Dondarrion but I was disappointed.  To our knowledge is anything else going on with them?


What other glaring plot points do I seem to be missing?

**TL;DR:  I just finished the books and I'm a little confused.  Help!**



Thanks in advance to anyone who humors me

So far, I have read through ASOS and then read all three Dunk and Egg Novellas.  However, I was told NOT to read Princess &amp; the Queen and Rogue Prince until after AFFC and ADWD, so I started reading AFFC/ADWD (boiled leather) after finishing the Dunk and Egg series.

I am only about 10-15 chapters in to AFFC/ADWD, but have been quite pleased with the way in which the Dunk and Egg novellas both supplemented my knowledge of Targaryen history and influenced my interpretation of numerous AFFC/ADWD scenes.  That, plus the fact that I am dreading reaching the end of what George has written so far in the main ASOIAF story, has me wanting to read Princess &amp; the Queen and Rogue Prince before continuing with AFFC/ADWD.

Is there any reason why I should NOT read Princess &amp; the Queen and Rogue Prince before continuing with AFFC/ADWD?  

Again, I was told not to, but the reasoning was largely rooted in a preference for reading in the published order as well as the argument that Targaryen history, as presented in AFFC/ADWD, is meant to be overwhelming and confusing.  

I find neither argument particularly compelling in the face of the fact that I really desire to read them first, but if Princess &amp; the Queen and Rogue Prince were to contain spoilers or something of the like, I certainly would not want to read them before AFFC/ADWD, so that's why I am asking here!",4,4,False,self,,,,,

[This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/2bgu8z/first_time_through_a_car_wash/cj5ekpv) got me thinking that maybe there is a factor or exponent that could be calculated from the gaps between the release years of all the books.  I thought it would be a neat exercise to figure it out while procrastinating at work, and decided to share it with anyone else on /r/gameofthrones who also wants to delay fulfilment of their responsibilities.

After playing around in Excel for a couple minutes, I came up with a factor of 1.45.

The release years are as follows:

* Book 1: 1996

* B2: 1998 (2 years)

* B3: 2000 (2 years)

* B4: 2005 (5 years)

* B5: 2011 (6 years)

For Book 3: If we take the first gap, 2 years, then multiply it by 1.45, we get 2.9 years. 1998 + 2.9 = 2001.  OK, so a year off.  But the rest line up perfectly (using the previous *calculated* gap, not the actual gap).

* Book 4: 2001 + (2.9*1.45) = 2001 + 4.2 = 2005

* Book 5: 2005 + (4.2*1.45) = 2005 + 6.1 = 2011.  Perfect!

Now for future releases:

* Book 6: 2011 + (6.1*1.45) = 2011 + 8.8 = 2020

* Book 7: 2020 + (8.8*1.45) = 2020 + 12.8 = 2033

**TL;DR** According to my modern jackass calculations, TWOW will be released in 2020, and ADOS in 2033.

I've decided how I'm going to make the quiz. Basically, the responses to each question will add points into certain traits. Once the quiz has been completed, the points are added for each of the respective traits and the individual is matched with the house closest to his results. What results is a great flexibility around the amount of houses that can be added, which is more...democratic. This means that each house needs to have ""preset"" values. For instance, the Starks will be high on family and loyalty (100), whereas the Lannisters would be high on family (100) but low on loyalty (0). Make sense? The only potential problem with this is that if certain houses are too similar, they'll overlap, but such can be avoided through other means.

What do I need from you? Suggestions on input values for certain traits (0, 25, 50, 75, 100) &amp; suggestions for other traits to add. However, I must add that I intend on keep the number of traits relatively short. Perhaps around 4 of 5.

Im from a magical place called [Yorkshire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire), which i believe GRRM based winterfell on. Here goes: pretty much all of the
actors that play people from winterfell are from Yorkshire or at least affecting a Yorkshire accent. The north of England
was [instrumental in the industrial revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_England#History), and in a similar way the north of westeros
seems to have this industrial heritage too (huge wall, central heated castles, biggest bridge etc). In the north of England, traditionally 
the two main houses/counties ([York/yorkshire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_York) and [lancaster/lancashire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lancaster) didnt get on (see '[war of the roses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wars_of_the_Roses)'. On one side, Lancashire (in which lies a town called [Bolton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolton),
as in roose) and yorkshire -in which is a river and region called the [humber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humber), which when pronounced in a yorkshire 
accent, (where H's do not exist), becomes 'umber (you may find it interesting to know that in yorkshire the letter H is
so completely non existent that words that start with a H and are proceeded by a vowel get the 'an' prefix, eg a horse becomes
an orse, a house an ouse, an arry potter book and so on).      That being said, we are all northerners at the end of the day and will usually side with another northerner
against people from the south(who stereotypically see northerners as poor and barbaric, both IRL and westeros) . Go a couple of hundred miles north of Yorkshire and you will find evidence of a [wall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian's_Wall), commissioned by Roman emperor Hadrian,
as the Romans decided everything north of that wall was too cold/crazy/fucked up (see Scotland ;) to be allowed inside Roman conquered Britian (ok, it was only 20 feet high, not 700
feet, but you have to allow for creative licence here)      
      
The rest of them:

The Iron born? big angry sea fairing raiders, whose favourite pass times include pillaging, rapine, sailing long boats and worshipping blood thirsty gods? im sure in another 1000 or so years the iron islands would have cornered 
the westeros market for trendy yet affordable flat pack furniture and safe cars. Pretty sure they are Scandinavian.      
       
The Cranog men? well cranog is a gaelic word for an artificially made island house thing. Do we know any semi mysterious,
wrathul gaelic speakers, known for using guerilla tactics in wars? perhaps in a country known for its bogs?(there is even a house peat in the crannog).I bet you they like stout.And music with fiddles.

Moving down to the Riverlands now, a forested area where people seem to be awfully fond of cloaks and bows. (ok this one is a little tenuous), well just down from Yorkshire lies [Nottingham](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham),
a place most people not from the UK will know for Sherwood forest and Robin hood - who was also a tad fond of cloaks and bows. Two rivers (the [Derwent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Derwent,_Derbyshire) and [Trent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Trent) ) meet there, not 3....[theres a castle by a river there as well](http://www.webbaviation.co.uk/gallery/d/41535-1/NewarkCastle-eb18884.jpg), even if its not quite built over the river.... yea this one was a bit tenuous....       
        
The Lannisters are a mish mash of several historical houses. The house of LANcaster was one of the combatants in the war of the roses, their colour was red with gold lions - although theirs changed to a red rose, (the gold lions on red background was the arms of the Plantagenet house, the 'father' house of York and lancaster, but we will come back to them) although i must add house lancaster is in the north of England,
 theres also a good sprinkling of [Borgia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Borgia) in there (poisoning, plotting, rumours of incest) and [De' Medici](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Medici) (being crazy rich and using that wealth to influence politics)       
       
Suggestions for the vale would be welcome, ive puzzled over this one. Ok there's no sheep, singing or rugby in the vale, but maybe Wales? [Isolated valleys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Wales_Valleys), [mountainous](http://www.visitwales.com/explore/mountains/ranges), full of [big fuck off castles?](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=castles+of+wales&amp;safe=off&amp;espv=2&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XunQU6S2EuHy7AbhxYHoCA&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAg&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=664) ...it rhymes with Wales?       
         

I think the reach is at least partially influenced by France(or the parts of England most heavily influenced by France). Known for its wine, slightly effeminate men, beautiful women, verdant farmland, over the top tourneys and foppish knights.      
      
moving further south you have the capitol, Which is difficult one, part London, anhk morpork, Vatican city and Rome. London was known historically for open sewage, sprawling Dickensian poverty, cut throats and thieves(not much change there then hehehe) which brings us to Gin alley - London was/is big on gin, to the point where Gin consumption became an epidemic that [parliament brought in laws to try limit its consumption](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gin_Craze) - prompting an artist to [make this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/GinLane.jpg/640px-GinLane.jpg) - a picture called 'Gin Lane'. And of course as you all know the royal palace is in London too.  Comparing London to Kings landing doesn't do Kings landing quite enough justice  Carl - fucking legend- tanner having a northern accent, and ser davos seaworth and his geordie-esque thing hes got going on doesnt quite add up
and Kings landing has a Mediterranean feel to it, is home to the seat of the church, and full of liars, poisoners(see the lanni- i mean Borgias), and political intrigue, hence Rome-esque too.      
         
At the very bottom of England lies a county called Cornwall ([a peninsula that looks like this if you spin it round](http://i.imgur.com/SJIzR7v.png) ), the people there are referred to as Cornish, 
But unfortunately thats just about where the similarities end between Cornwall and Dorne. There is more than a dash of Moorish spain in there Dorne, and Spain did try [to invade down there with a giant fleet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Armada) - perhaps Dorne is based on Cornwall as it would have been if this invasion was successful? Who knows.

Which leaves us with the Targaryens. The house that started it all? that came in, took everyones stuff, kings with titles as long as your arm, ruled for a really really long time, whose offshoot houses had all kinds of crazy wars with each other? Whose rule shaped the nation that way it is today? 
Their Sigil was not a 3 headed dragon [but 3 lions](http://theenglandstore.com/images/categories/Three_Lions.jpg)  (that [England still wear](http://wallmobi.net/uploads/pictures/sport/3962-england-3-lions.jpg) on national sports uniforms to this day) and those bad mother fuckers were called the [Plantagenets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Plantagenet).       
        
TL:DR things in Westeros are a little bit kinda like things in Britian.

At this point, I'm fairly certain we all know House Stark's words are *Winter is Coming*. And, as far as I'm aware, the old Kings in the North, those who reigned before the first Aegon, were called the Kings of Winter. My theory follows: what if the 'winter' in the Starks' words isn't only the true winter, the season of snows and bone-freezing temperatures, but the *kings* of winter? That the saying could have been used as a promise to their enemies that the kings and their armies were out for blood? This practice could have been abandoned when the last northern king knelt to Aegon, only to be replaced with *The North Remembers* after the butchery that was the Red Wedding. Seeing as how the phrase has been thrown about by Wyman Manderly and Lady Dustin to Davos and a group of Freys, respectively, just to name two obvious cases, I feels this makes sense; *Winter is Coming* was once a threat, *The North Remembers* is it's spiritual successor, and it captures the overall mindset of the hatred, betrayal, and loss felt by any and all loyal northmen. If I'm not mistaken, The Winds of Winter is just a less direct allusion to a Stark resurgence than A Time for Wolves. The winds felt by the Boltons and the Freys will be bitterly cold, and sharp; there's a very good chance they'll be made of Stark steel, winds pledged to another King in the North.",17,15,False,self,,,,,

Dany is caring and would make a great queen.  She would take care of her kingdom like a mother cares for her children.  But she is also young and stupid at times.

Stannis is, at times, the most king-like person in the books.  When he saves the wall, he exemplifies what a king should be.  But, in my opinion, he may be too just.  Sometimes it is wise to pardon a crime if it means making important allies, but I don't think Stannis would ever do this.  He would make a great judge, but a king needs to be more.

So if you had to choose between Stannis or Daenerys, who would you choose and why?",86,10,False,self,,,,,

* ~~Joffrey Baratheon~~




* Cersei Lannister




* Walder Frey




* Meryn Trant




* ~~Tywin Lannister~~




* Melisandre




* Beric Dondarrion




* Thoros of Myr




* Ilyn Payne




* Gregor Clegane (Not dead, but it looks likely)




* Sandor Clegane (Not clear if dead, but likely)




* ~~The Tickler~~




* ~~Polliver~~

And i'm amazed and love how in the books explains all details 
for example when jon snow saves Jeor Mormont and burns out the entire cabin
and through the whole journey how his arm is healing and the inconvenients that it comes with it

another better example is when ned is in the black cells at king's landing, in the series when it comes the time when he's being judged he looks exactly as he was before being imprisoned,but in the books, is so detailed as he losses weight he doesn't even know if it has happened a day or a week, the circunstances that he is in, it's just more logical and realistic, but again, i know that can't be or is too hard to be made in TV

Another example is Daenerys, before starting reading the books i didn't really knew if she was aware that Jorah was crazy about her, but in the books she even thinks how it would be to ''please him'' ''he doesn't love me as a knight loves his queen, he loves me as a man loves a woman'' and for me that's a huge difference, and another thing is that her way to think is not like a westerossi, she thinks more like a Dothraki, well yeah she is practiclly a dothraki and she has never been in westeros, but i considered her like westerossi

But the lords and ladies are to busy playing the game of thrones to worry about their impending doom, seems crazy right? But the same thing is happening right now, or at least something very similar. Now I know some of you will roll your eyes and down vote  but that's the problem, no one is doing anything about climate change.

Meanwhile things like violence on the Gaza strip and a missing plane get 24/7 coverage. Despite the Earth slowly dying around us because of us.

Trant dislikes Tyrion very much, it might aswell be hatred. But despite this, during Tyrion's trial, he does his testimony without lying about a thing. 

I think that Meryn Trant has a sense of honor and every bad thing he has done(beaten Sansa for instance) has been on direct order from the king.

I'm sorry if this post is a bit rambling, and there's some speculation and assumptions here.

If I remember correctly:

Loras is the one who convinced Renly that he should attempt to take the Iron Throne. He says that despite being fourth in line (after Joffrey, Tommen, and Stannis), Renly would be a good King because he's kind and just. Loras tells Renly that the Tyrell family would fund him (which would have happened anyway, right? Because Renly was married to Margery?).

Here's what I've been wondering: What would have happened had Loras not put this idea in Renly's head? I've been thinking that once the War of Five Kings started, Renly would have fought alongside his brother Stannis. Stannis would have granted Renly his seat on the Small Council and named him as his heir (until a son comes to age).

Stannis's army would have then been bolstered by both his brother's men and House Tyrell. Am I correct in saying that even after Tyrion's brilliant use of wildfire, Stannis would have won had it not been for the arrival of Tywin Lannister and House Tyrell's soldiers?

It's soooo different from the series to the books
I know they can't make it just as it's in the books because of budget and those kind of stuff
but wow, some of them are quite different

For example the eyrie:
In the books there is 2 ways to get to the top, the first one by going on a big basket full with vegetables and fruits 

and the second is hiking to the top mounted in goats, and there we meet Mya stone, the guide, and there are 3 towers that i don't remember the names right now but by the way it's described it's a pain in the ass and super risky to try to go to the top
And in the sheries from one cut to another they already are in the eyrie....... what? how?

''Qarth is the greatest city that ever was or ever will be ... Saathos the Wise after gazing upon Qarth for the first time, because he knew that all he saw thereafter should look squalid and ugly by comparison'' exaggerating of course, but still...

In the books Qarth has an outside door and wall of 10 32ft, a central one of 39ft, and an insid of 45ft, Doors of Jade,Bronze, Iron with beautiful drawings of the wild, big wars and men and women giving pleasure to themselves, with beautiful fountains made in the form of dragons and manticores, archs in the for of sankes made of obsidian, jade, lapiz azuli

and the people is tall and very white, wearing jewelry of many kinds, ann wear colorful and extravagants clothes
it kinda made me think of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon for some reason

This scene of course would be Maggy's Prophecy. So would it be too far fetched to say that Aimee may reappear as a younger Cersei, I mean who better to play her than her own daughter(well past daughter) I mean she would only be in one episode, but it would be really cool to see her in it since she was cheated out of her original role.",9,4,False,self,,,,,

No, it's not a chapter of endless action and intrigue, but it's very intimate and charming as well as sad and reflective. We say goodbye to Aemon Targaryen, who was easily one of the best supporting characters in the story. He was our link to an age of Westeros that is long gone, and both his wisdom and somber reflections of his past were always compelling to read. 
Sam eulogizing him was perfect along with his final words, wishing he could have reached out to Daenerys, the last remaining of his destroyed family.

And then, while drinking rum to the memory of Maester Aemon, Sam and Gilly finally get together. Rather, she takes charge and teaches Sam the love of a woman's touch for the first time. I find the prose here extremely compelling. The next day as he tumbles with his thoughts and frets over his broken vows, only to be confronted later by the southron captain's daughter who basically says, ""Either jump in the water and swim to shore or go back and be with Gilly"" because, ""she's no fool, she knows she can't have you forever, but she's lost everything and you're all she has now."" And then Sam goes to her at once and tells her, ""of all the noble girls and princesses in their castles, all I want is you."" 

Damn you, GRRM. The feels. It's not some edge of your seat PLOT TWIST!! type of chapter, but it's as intimate and emotional a chapter as I've read in the series and it's impossible not to absolutely adore Sam while reading it. In a story so filled with shit, shitty people, and shittier situations, I found this chapter as sweet as honeywine.",1,8,False,self,,,,,

Apart from the whole publishing time thing, it was lacking in action and most people's favorite characters weren't there. But I really liked this book. First of all, it gave some pretty interesting insight into Dorne and what was going on there. It was much more political than action, and I enjoyed that change. It also gave some insight into how paranoid Cersei actually is and she finally got what she deserved. The Kraken chapters were probably the least interesting, but Asha is a pretty entertaining character. Kevan rejecting Cersei and letting her know he knew made me like his character instantly. And probably my favorite part of the whole book is the reveal at the end of Arianne's last chapter. The way Doran just played the badass old man was so great. I loved seeing so many of the different perspectives, and it was really interesting and healed a bit of my heartbreak for Oberyn. I haven't read ADwD yet, so I can't say it's my favorite of the series, but I'll start soon.",14,37,False,self,,,,,

It's always bugged me how Tyrion managed to survive being attacked by a King's Guard while unarmed and off-guard. There's really no reason anyone who knows how to use a sword shouldn't be able to pull that off, right?

Then I realized, when Arya saves Jaqen H'ghar and the two others from the fire, Jaqen said she ""stole 3 deaths from the Red God"" and thus had her name 3 lives to give back in exchange. Since we can safely assume Tywin's bannermen (the men who started the fire) do no worship the Red God, this means *any* death's by fire could be seen as offerings to/for the Red God.

Back to Tyrion and his unlikely survival, what did he do just minutes before surviving a slash to the face? He lit half of Blackwater Bay on fire, along with half of Stannis' fleet/men. That's a mighty big offering to Red God.

Whatever, people have been praying to the Mother for protection since season 1 and it's done two things, jack and shit, and jack left town. 

Except we know the Red God actually exists and will answer prayers since that Red Priest was able to revive that one-eyed knight after The Mountain/Hound/Lannisters killed him. 

An offering to the Red God of that size could also even explain Tyrion's managing to survive the whole thing with Joffery and the trial by combat. 

Could also explain Bron not only surviving the battle but also how he is now a rich/married/soon to be richer man. 

What do you guys think? Am I crazy or onto something? Or both?",22,6,False,self,,,,,

He seems to not appreciate that Tywin genuinely respects Tyrion, (though not the whoring). 

For example:

 - He made Tyrion hand of the king. 
 - He accepted Tyrion's help in the form of the mountain people.
 - In S03E10 there's that conversation where they agree that Joffrey isn't the most powerful man in Westeros. 
 - He _hasn't_ simply killed Tyrion, he easily could have.
 - He's happy for Tyrion to be an educated Lannister of social standing.
 - Re: the conversation about Casterly Rock, he's willing to give Tyrion some land and a wife. 

IMO Tywin genuinely respects Tyrion, though resents him for killing his wife, and is otherwise often embarressed by him. But Tyrion seems to not see this, and has a victim complex about him. ",12,0,False,self,,,,,

And with season 5 looking the way it does now, there are some definite and assumed changes coming for the Dornish.

* Change 1: Tyene is no longer the daughter of a Septa, but a dagger wielding daughter of Ellaria. The infiltration of the Faith seems to be cut.

* Change 2: Trystane is the heir to Dorne and betrothed to Myrcella. However, Tyrion says in season 2 that he plans to wed Myrcella to the Martells' [""youngest son"".](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4bOa_WD0nE) Are D&amp;D retconning this line and making Trystane the only child? With the removal of Quentyn, Doran's plot to ally with Daenerys. 

* Change 3: With Trystane being heir, Arianne is seemingly cut as well. Someone else might take up the queenmaking, either the Sandsnakes or Trystane. But with no highborn girl in Doran's pocket, his plan to ally with Aegon is gone as well.

With three plots gone, Doran doesn't appear to be the mastermind he is supposed to be. Maybe they'll focus on crowning Myrcella. Maybe they'll focus on Nym on the small council. Maybe they'll invent something. All I'm saying is that Arianne and Quentyn should be included to properly establish the Dornish threat.

As someone new to GoT, here are some thoughts about the series overall.",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/2bx679/all_spoilers_just_finished_the_show_as_someone/,ye_olde_jetsetter,1406525818,"When I browse this subreddit, I look for threads for fans new and old to come and have a wide discussion. In the interest of fostering such discussion, here's a random list of a bunch of thoughts/observations/questions I had about the series. I invite people to agree, disagree, tell me how things are better in the books (just got them in the mail next week, starting soon!) etc, etc. 

- When I first started watching, I thought Cersei was really beautiful. As the seasons went on, she became harsher and harsher for me to look at. This, of course, due to the things she does and says, I'm sure. By the time I got through the end of s4, I had a hard time looking at her. Really great characterization there. 

- In contrast, sorta, in season 1 I found Sansa to be one of my least favorite characters, but as soon as she became a prisoner in King's Landing, she became about a thousand times more interesting. Her unique position and unfortunate circumstances make for really engaging content. 

- Littlefinger's accent became really hard for me to take seriously in seasons three and four. I've read the explanations as for why he loses the more ""proper"" speech, though. You know, I shouldn't say hard to take seriously -- more like, it served to highlight what a creep he was coming off as. 

- Podri[c]k, Bronn, Brienne, Sam, and the Onion Knight are personally my favorite characters. 

- Shae is the worst. Literally the worst. _Get some sense into your head, woman!_ 

- This may be a case where the books handle it better, but for me as a viewer, it was really hard to watch Robb casually ignore his betrothal to one of Walder Frey's daughters. The whole Red Wedding thing, I had pretty much zero pity for anyone. I'm sure Walder might have ended up betraying Robb anyways, but _seriously_, was this random girl you met on the battlefield really worth breaking your oath to one of your father's bannermen? 

- Tywin pretty much stole every scene he was in -- at least, for me. Maybe I just like his voice. Related: One of my favorite scenes in the entire series was when Arya was serving Tywin, and Littlefinger walks in, and Arya has to go about her duties, even though she is practically paralyzed with fear. 

- The relationships between Tyrion/Sansa, and the Hound/Arya are so meaty and delicious. Imagine the four of them on a double-date to Medieval Times. 

- Stannis' daughter is the most precious thing in the entire world.  

- Up until about season 3, I thought Riverrun and Harrenhal were the same place. I also have no idea where the Dreadfort is. These are things that can be rectified just by looking at a map, but yeah, geographically, I'm still pretty lost. 

- I think the Eyrie looks the coolest out of all of the locations shown. The idea of a Moon Door is pretty cool. 

- Melisandre makes me really upset for some reason, and I don't know why. 

I submitted to this subforum with a question I had earlier, and you guys were really helpful! So here are some more I have. PS - Do you guys have a weekly questions thread for newbies like me? That would be really helpful. 

- Are Ramsay Snow and Jon Snow related? 
- Did the Starks rule Winterfell during the reign of the Targaryens? When was the ""Warden of the North"" put in place? 
- How is Daenerys related to the Mad King? 
- Where do the cities in Essos get their money? It seems like every single town is just absolutely swimming with wealth.

I guess that's it for right now. I'm excited to be caught up on the show, and able to participate in more discussions around here. Can't wait to start the books! Thanks for reading. ",42,19,False,self,,,,,

I know there's really nobody left to look for the would-be killer and it's kind of pointed to that Joffrey was the one who hired the assassin IIRC but was that it?  That whole storyline that drove the kidnapping of Tyrion and assisted in the advancement of a bunch of plot points was just wrapped up in the ""Oh yeah I guess that's what happened"" so the storyline would die with Joffrey?

I probably missed something but it was like the driving force of the beginning of AGOT and it just kind of unceremoniously fell out of the plot.  For TV viewers it was never reconciled.   I know it's not a huge deal because I mean, at that point nobody who cared (except for Tyrion) was still alive, but I figure it was just a way for GRRM to wrap it up with a bow. 

I was pretty disappointed in the way it just stopped.  But I guess I'm nitpicking. ",20,14,False,self,,,,,

Since I already watched the show, I know that Reek is Theon after being tortured, but I was just reading about Theon a few chapters earlier, and he is still talking to his Lord Father...

As a show watcher, it gave me the feel that Theon becomes Reek much later. So is there a bit of discrepancy on the timeline, or am I just dreaming?",9,3,False,self,,,,,

The heads of the House of Douglas held the titles of the Earl of Douglas (Black Douglas) and later the Earl of Angus (Red Douglas). One notable event was the influence of the Red Wedding. *The Black Dinner of was when, in 1440, the young William Douglas, 6th Earl of Douglas and his brother were invited to dine with the ten year-old King James II of Scotland. The occasion was organised by the Lord Chancellor, Sir William Crichton. A black bull's head, the symbol of death, was brought in.After the dinner the Douglas chiefs were dragged out to Castle Hill, given a mock trial and beheaded. The Clan Douglas then laid siege to Edinburgh Castle. Perceiving the danger, Crichton surrendered the castle to the king and was rewarded with the title Lord Crichton.


* **Clan Mackay**: motto - *With A Strong Hand* - An ancient and once-powerful Scottish clan from the far North of the Scottish Highlands, Clan Mackay supported Robert the Bruce during the Wars of Scottish Independence in the 14th century, and at one stage held 11 castles in the Highlands. Throughout the 14th and 16th century Clan Mackay and Clan Sutherland were embroiled in a rivalry for control of the North. 


* **Clan Sutherland**: motto - *Without Fear* - As mentioned before, Clan Sutherland were an ancient and influential clan from the Scottish Highlands, and old enemies with Clan Mackay. A feud with the Mackays came to a head when Nicholas Sutherland of Duffus, head of one of the junior branches, murdered the chief of the Clan Mackay and his heir at Dingwall Castle, where they had met in an attempt to patch up the feud. A retaliatory raid by the Mackays on Dornoch took place, where the cathedral was set on fire and many Sutherland men were hanged in the town square. William, 5th Earl of Sutherland was killed by the Mackays in 1370 in feud which lasted for the next four centuries.

* **Clan Stewart**: motto - *Courage Grows Strong At The Wound* - An influential clan in the Scottish Lowlands, and at one time a Royal House. During the Wars of Scottish Independence, James Stewart, 5th High Steward of Scotland swore fealty to Edward I of England. However he later supported William Wallace and also king Robert the Bruce in the struggle for Scottish independence. When Robert's son, David II of Scotland died, he was succeeded by Walter Stewart's son, Robert II of Scotland. King Robert II had many sons, the eldest, John, succeeded to the throne of Scotland as Robert III of Scotland. The royal line of male Stewarts was uninterrupted until the reign of Mary Queen of Scots.


* **Other Houses With Dope Mottos**

Clan Gunn; 'Either Peace or War'

Clan Donald; 'By Sea and Land'

Clan Munro; 'Dread God'

Clan Agnew; 'By Wisdom, Not Force'

Clan Armstrong; 'We Remain Unvanquished'

Clan Graham; 'Do Not Forget'

Clan MacAuley; 'Danger Is Sweet'

Clan MacDougal; 'To Conquer or Die'

Clan Mckenzie; 'I Shine Not Burn'

Clan Stuart of Bute; 'The Lion's Anger Is Noble'

and perhaps the best/worst motto - Clan McGilvarry; 'TOUCH NOT THIS CAT'

Are we going to leave these storylines for a season, and focus on the Wall, Aria, Cersie and Tyrion?

I just really hope he puts out a sixth book, so they at least have some slack to play with. They are getting dangerously close to end of books with those storylines.

* **Loyalty** - Houses marked as loyal follow through with their commitments and tend to have a degree of duty and honor.

* **Aspirations** - Houses marked as aspirational are involved in the political sphere; they're ambitious, flashy, and typically wealthy.

* **Family** - Houses marked as familial tend to put needs of the House and members of their house before the individual.",15,58,False,self,,,,,

That being said, there were two that stood out to me. The last question asked was the audience member asking (without giving away any details) why the Tysha confession from Jaime was cut. D&amp;D talked at length about how hard the decision to condense the conversation and how certain things work for TV and blah blah blah, but they never gave any details about Tysha during this exchange.

Now, earlier in the panel, an audience member started to ask D&amp;D about Stoneheart being cut, and it was the same deal. The audience member was very cryptic and non-specific about it, to the point where no one but book readers would know what he was talking about. Before he even finished his thought, David (I think, camera was on the audience member) very quickly said, ""We can't talk about that,"" and the kid was quickly rushed aside without another word.

I know people are all skeptical about Stoneheart being on the show, but I really believe it is still happening. No one involved with the show has said ""Stoneheart isn't happening."" We have a ""She's dead,"" from Michelle (which is a cryptic response considering her character) a ""It was never going to happen this Season,"" from Alex Graves (who admits in the same interview that D&amp;D don't tell him things far in advance) and we got absolute silence from D&amp;D. Why can't someone just come forward and say ""Stoneheart is cut and won't be in the show."" ?

I'll tell you why. Because she is NOT cut and will be in Season 5.

Anyone ever noticed how Jaqen H'gar just hides in plain sight after killing ""The Tickler"" and everyone doesn't seem to suspect him at all ? I think it's mainly because he's eating that apple. I mean, this video doesn't really show it , but there's a clear noise of a body hitting the ground just before a woman screams, so there would be safe bet to assume that someone pushed him from some high place.Why nobody suspects him ? Is eating something such a good disguise ? 

I once read an interesting article that I can't quite remember on how people see you while eating something and it claimed it makes you look a little more friendly and confident in a social environment, like ""I don't have anything to hide, I belong here"". It's like just this subtle thing does a lot more than it seems.

I'd love to hear more about this stuff but I can't seem to find anything. What do you guys think ?",16,2,False,self,,,,,

4207,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2014-7-30,2014,7,30,0,2c1w78,self.gameofthrones,[AFFC/Season 5] Regarding an arc that will change due to a cut character,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/2c1w78/affcseason_5_regarding_an_arc_that_will_change/,tansypool,1406649587,"I do acknowledge that this is a bit tinfoily.

With Myrcella's recasting, there has been some questioning as to why. Aimee Richardson seemed perfectly good at acting when she appeared in the show, as well as willing to come back, and she clearly loves her character. The new actress is slightly younger than her, so the recasting isn't because of an age issue, as it was with Tommen. It isn't unusual for the show but it is still kind of odd. (Of course, it could just be that they decided after two seasons to start fresh. Not the point here.)

As far as press releases have indicated, Arianne has been cut from the show, as Trystane is listed as the Martell heir. This will have major implications on the Queenmaker plot, as it was Arianne's idea. It will quite possibly occur in an entirely different manner.

I think that they may have cast Nell Tiger Free as Rosamund Lannister - a Lannister of Lannisport who is disguised as Myrcella when Myrcella is taken to Arianne. However, in the show, Rosamund may be planted as a fake Myrcella from the start. They are a similar height and have a similar appearance from afar, though Rosamund's hair is straight while Myrcella's is curly, so it is not unreasonable to assume that switching them early on would mean that nobody is alerted.

The announcement of Nell Tiger Free as Myrcella may be designed to play into this. Most people wouldn't have been surprised at the announcement, given the time that has passed. This will keep the audience in the dark alongside what will likely be the majority of Dornish characters. The arc will likely take up multiple episodes, so it won't be as if they're introducing an actress as a lead who then appears for thirty seconds.

This would mean that other Martells would be involved in the Queenmaker plot - for example, it could be changed to a plan of Trystane's. It may also have implications on Jaime's alleged trip south next season.

(One other instance of new cast members being falsely announced was Iwan Rheon - his character was only announced as ""Boy"", to conceal that he was in fact Ramsay Snow. It isn't unheard of.)

**TL;DR: they're lying about who Nell Tiger Free has been cast as so that they can keep viewers in the dark with the Queenmaker plot.**

For me, AGOT was the first ever English novel that I've read and it took me a month to read through it (probably 50 hours overall). After that I used the audiobook + E-Book to read through ACOK (Also took a month because I got very bored at some parts and I didn't read for a while). I don't think I would've been able to make it through ACOK if it weren't for the audiobooks because at certain parts it got really boring! [ACOK](#b ""I'm looking at you, Catelyn!"").

So lately, I've been thinking about what songs work for which character and I've decided to ask you guys what song comes to mind when you see a certain character on the show. Likewise, what songs make you think of certain characters from the show/books?

For example, for the first question, every time Arya trains with her sword in the show, I half expect [Irene Cara's ""What a Feeling""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Rvs6mNoMcs) to start playing montage music.

Likewise, for the second question, I always can't help but think of Joffrey and Cersei whenever I hear [Muse's ""Take a Bow""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zy0IOZNq9Cs)

To make this even more fun, answers using characters from the books (but are cut/aren't yet in the show) are also allowed.

So what musical links do you make with the characters of the Game of Thrones universe? ",21,7,False,self,,,,,

It sent chills up and down my spine. I mean look at Dany's eyes - she needs a new set of panties after this speech.

It pains me to think of what might have been had Drogo lived. I know a lot of people dismiss his potential, citing his barbaric tactics and general technological shortcomings when facing off against modern armies, but *nobody* had the passion and loyalty of his men like Drogo. That guy could inspire me to get out of bed before 10 AM on weekends.

You will not find Drogo crying about how he is the rightful king or about how everyone should bend the knee. Drogo cares only about victory and keeping his ponytail clean.

I think Robert was the only person who saw the real threat the Dothraki can pose; sure, they might not be able to take your castle, but they will ravage your countryside and win the people over one way or another while you hide behind your walls.

Many of us remember book readers struggling to contain their excitement about a ""big reveal"" that would *certainly* happen at the end of the season 4... There were a lot of heated arguments and efforts made against spoiling it for the show watchers. But, perhaps ironically, when the reveal didn't happen, it ended up being the future book readers, not the show watchers, who were spoiled.

It bothers me that the ""big reveal"" *book spoiler* has become such an acceptable topic on all sorts of media -- social and news.

It certainly drives home the point that the show and the books are different animals now. Even if someone watched the show and later decided to read the books, the ""big reveal"" would be just as effective to them as it would be to someone coming in completely fresh. IMO, that's a reveal worth protecting.

As the paths of the books and show continue to diverge, there will most likely be new opportunities for this exact type of book spoiler to happen again... Let's learn from this. I hope current fans can show restraint and respect for the future fans who want enjoy either or both forms of Westeros.

TLDR; Protect the show from future watchers, but also protect the books from future readers.",16,11,False,self,,,,,

My choices would probably be - 

* **The Mad King** - Anthony Hopkins; could be wishful thinking but I reckon that would be cool. They'd probably have the budget for a big name actor. If not, Stellan Skarsgaard would be great.

* **Rhaegar** - [Alexander Skarsgaard](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002907/). 

* **Rickard Stark** - [Peter Mullan](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0611932/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1)

So after watching the show I convinced myself to buy the books and so far, I absolutely love them. They add an entirely new factor to the whole game of thrones universe. However, as I was reading I cam across something pretty odd. During the second day of the Hand's tournament, Littlefinger and Renly are placing bets on the Jaime V Hound. When the Hound wins, Renly (who bet on him) says ""A pity the imp isn't here or else I would have on twice as much"". This obviously contradicts Littlefingers story of how Tyrion won the knife off of him when Tyrion bet against Jaime, because it shows that Tyrion did in fact bet for Jaime. Shouldn't Ned have noticed this and put two and two together that it wasn't Tyrion that plotted against Bran? I stopped reading after that to post this so maybe I just haven't read far enough. If thats the case I'll shut up and continue reading. ",59,70,False,self,,,,,

Here's a shot of the scene for reference:

http://i.imgur.com/BTzjdpx.jpg

From watching the scene we can assume that the lighting on Margaery is from the candle she walked in with. The lighting of Tommen is assumed to be natural lighting from the window, the brightest source of which would be a full moon on a cloudless evening. A bit of searching found that a candle emits approximately 1 candela intensity of light, which at 1 foot is roughly 10 lux. According to the wiki on [Lux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lux) a full moon emits around 0.271.0 lux. 

The candle light should be emiting 10-30x the amount of light as the moon, yet the actors appear to be lit evenly. If anything it looks as if Tommen is actually in stronger light. In reality the light from the candle should be drowning out the moonlight, and Tommen should also be lit mostly by the candle. 

Okay, I know I'm being really nit-picky, but regardless it's always bothered me. ",5,0,False,self,,,,,

What I mean by that is, the show has no main character, just individual character arcs that follow a plot. A bit like Lost was, but it goes beyond that. There are no safe characters. For me at least, there's a suspense that my favorite character will die every time I watch a new episode.

Everyone has faults and weaknesses, good and evil, etc. I think this makes it easier for people to pick favorite characters, and it can make for really cool conversations. Your absolute favorite character can die so horribly in any episode. It's such a fun show to talk with other people about.
