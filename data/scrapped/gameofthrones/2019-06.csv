My original goal was to fix a number of unignorable problems in the final 4 episodes. The first 5 points listed below were what I set out to fix in my initial rework. Points 6-12 are unexpected outcomes from tying up the plot holes I was forced to deal with as the story's structure reshaped.

1. The White Walkers are a greater threat
2. Bran puts his powers to use
3. Dany earns her madness
4. The Night King's motives are clearer
5. More of the world is used to give a wider scope and heighten the stakes
6. Cersei does more, and furthers character development
7. The aftermath of Danys campaign is sufficiently explored
8. Plenty of callbacks to the series
9. More satisfying character arc conclusions
10. The stakes are generally higher, making the bitter end more bitter, but the sweet sweeter
11. Tyrion is smart again when it counts 
12. Jon is a little more proactive

My desire was to change as little as possible whilst keeping the general structure of the season intact, including the characters who are killed, and where the living ones end up. I used the visuals of the show as a reference while writing this. With all that said, I hope you enjoy the read.

I Think we can all agree that most of the events that occured during S8 could have been very well accepted by the watchers and coherent with the story, the thing the story needed was more seasons (which they have been asked for, lol) to end those huge characters arcs.

&amp;#x200B;

HOWEVER, i kinda believes it could have been saved after S8E6.

Basically, if the second half of S8E6 would have been only Bran's actions during the whole season, like showing him playing a Chess Game by manipulating characters, getting the information early and warging into animals. If we were to be shown only Bran's action during the season while getting mindfucked because we'd realize he did this, that and that to lead to those consequences, I think it would've been pretty neat. I also strongly believes Game Of Thrones still could be kinda saved if they made like an hour long episode now and released it like in 6 months.

&amp;#x200B;

Hot take so dont think I believe my statement is true. Just wanna see what y'all think. Also, non-native english speaker here so if you wanna correct me on some mistakes, go ahead. :)",13,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

When season 8 ended, I was, like many of you, disappointed and sad. At first, I kinda just accepted what it was instead of thinking what could have been. This season had so much potential and I kinda feel like betrayed in a way? Idk lol maybe thats a bit intense but for real. In no way, shape or form do I believe the writers deserve all the hate theyre receiving. I just think that they shouldve taken the fans into consideration. I feel like they rushed it so that a lot of plots/dialogues wouldnt go over peoples heads. They anticipated that GOT season 8 was going to be the most viewed show and wanted everyone to enjoy it without feeling a sense of confusion. All that said tho was that we were essentially fed a bunch of bull for 6-7 seasons. Its crazy because I loved season 7 too but now that I think about it, what a complete waste of a season. We gotta convince Cersei of what now for what? So we can see her get 10 seconds of screenplay in season 8? Like duuuuude. Okay Im annoying myself now. Just needed to share my own thoughts on the matter. I still love the show and will continue to binge watch episodes until I die or become broke and my hbo subscription gets canceled ",2,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

In it we are putting in one song for each character. The songs in some way must exemplify or relate to thea specific character. 

The songs don't have to be dead on serious, they can be humorous or ironic (as you'll see in my short list below I have some that only fit in a humorous way).

Ideally I would like a song for every character (Robin Arryn to Gilly to Sir Davos).

Right now I have the following.

Daenerys - Killer Queen by Queen
Bran - Comfortably Numb by Pink Floyd (for humor)
Little Finger - Tip Toe Through the Tulips by Tony Tim
Night King - Behind Blue Eyes by The Who
Arya - I Am No One by Gemini Killer

Answer: First, some context. I read a few replies here and they get most of it right, but they don't tell the full story. This is an attempt to tell it all and tell it true.

**2010~ish**: /r/gameofthrones is created. This was created as the original community for fans of George RR Martin's ""A Song of Ice and Fire / Game of Thrones"" book series. Since HBO was beginning the TV series, they also allowed discussion related to the TV series.

However, because the books are **way** ahead of the TV series (the first book was released in 1996), the mods needed a way to split up the conversation in a non-spoiler way. Season 1 covered book 1, and season 2 covered book 2. However, some fans wanted (especially around 2011, when the 5th book, A Dance with Dragons, released) to chat about the new content in the book.

**2010-ish**: /r/asoiaf is created. The general discussion here is primarily aimed at the book version of Game of Thrones. This gives the book readers a safe space to discuss the latest and greatest without worrying about spoilers or whatever else.

**2010 - 2015**: the mods of /r/GameOfThrones get more strict about spoilers. The TV series turns into a hit, and more and more people watch it every year. Containing spoilers becomes very difficult, so they impose a significant number of rules that make it hard to actually talk about any Game of Thrones related topics.

This frustrates a few users. So they break away and form /r/freefolk.

**2015**: /r/freefolk is created. The goal of this sub is simple: talk about Game of Thrones. The mods only exist to enforce Reddit's site-wide rules. If people post content that others' don't like, they are reminded that the downvote button exists. Spoilers are completely fine in that subreddit.

The mods of /r/freefolk forbid any mods of /r/gameofthrones to also be mods at their newly established haven. There's some drama, I'll spare you the details.

Now on to the charity.

**March 21, 2019** - two months before the final season airs. [The New Yorker publishes an article](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/personal-history/emilia-clarke-a-battle-for-my-life-brain-aneurysm-surgery-game-of-thrones) about how Emilia Clarke (one of the lead actors in the TV series) suffered two aneurysms while filming the first two seasons. She announces a new charity called SameYou:

&gt; Beyond my work as an actor, Ive decided to throw myself into a charity Ive helped develop in conjunction with partners in the U.K. and the U.S. It is called SameYou, and it aims to provide treatment for people recovering from brain injuries and stroke.

Which is a wonderful thing. 

**May 2019** Fast forward 2 months to the end of Season 8.

Season 8 left a lot to be desired. Many subscribers at /r/freefolk felt very bad about it. For about a week after the season finale, it was filled with memes after memes about how disappointed people were with the final TV series. And this bot called BOBBY B yelling at everyone.

But one brilliant redditor cut through the rabble. She (?) recognized that the actors in the show really did a great job, and thought they ought to get some recognition for their efforts. Emilia's story was very moving, so they centered [the post](https://old.reddit.com/r/freefolk/comments/brj5vq/can_we_collectively_do_something_nice_for_emilia/) around that. They encouraged fellow subscribers to donate to *SameYou*.

It went viral. Over $45,000 was raised in 5 days. /r/freefolk couldn't be happier.

But then, they asked ""hey, can we get folks from /r/gameofthrones in on this?"" After all, that's one of the main advantages of social networks: to engage with people with similar interests as you.

So people tried cross posting the original /r/freefolk post to /r/gameofthrones. Except, due to the history, the mods at GOT quickly took down any links to the fundraiser simply because it came from /r/freefolk.

This caused a lot of strife between the two communities. Some users started brigading the GOT subreddit, which lead to a [rarely seen mod post](https://old.reddit.com/r/freefolk/comments/buzm92/announcement_do_not_brigade_rgameofthrones/) telling people to abide by Reddit's rules.

The mods of both communities chat and agree that this is something that ought to be shared. So the mods of /r/gameofthrones sticky the fundraiser post to their subreddit.

That's where things stand now. I'm sure it'll change in a day or so.",0,1,False,self,,,,,

Here's the moment that I wish to change: When Jon is hiding behind a wall, he sees Arya slashing through the dead. He realises that Viserion must be distracted in order to let Arya reach Godswood, where Night King is standing in front of Bran with Theon ready to charge towards the Night King. Jon thinks this is the moment he was resurrected from the dead, to let Arya pass by so that she can save the world, so he steps out of that wall, but suddenly he feels a rush of energy through his body, he feels that Longclaw is getting hot and when he looks at his sword, the blade is on fire. He realises that Lord of Light will help him fight against the Dead Viserion. He stands firm, he puts up his sword and as Viserion blows his ice breath Jon cuts through these flames of ice with the help of his Longclaw. The eyes of the bear on the Longclaw are glowing yellow and so are Jon's. Arya is joined with Podrick and Gendry and as they enter the Godswood, here starts the epic sword fight between the White Walkers and the Living. Arya, Podrick,and Gendry kill the White Walkers and since killing of White Walkers will lead to wights dying, the other warriors like Jaime, Brienne, and Tormund join them as well. And when all the White Walkers are Dead, Night King turns towards the Three Eyed Raven. Theon charges towards the Night King after Bran forgives him by saying,""You are a good man, Theon."" and is defeated in an honourable way. Our band charges towards towards the Night King, led by Arya. The Night King raises his hands and the dead are brought back to life, Theon as well. Meanwhile, Jon is struggling through Viserion's ice breath and trying to look for a way so he could plunge his sword in it. Our band charges towards the Night King before he kills Bran, everyone else gives cover to Arya and we see Arya jumping out of thin air to kill the Night King from the back and the Night King turns around and holds Arya's neck, on the other side, Jon finally manages to climb on the angry Viserion and holds his sword and is ready to kill it. Jon plunges the sword in Viserion, slashing through his neck, he climbs down. Jon sees the mighty dragon fall down and as he looks around, he is being attacked by the rest of dead. Arya manages to get out of Night King's hold and our last hope against the Dead decides that she would not die without killing the NK. They both enter into an epic sword fight, while the rest of the White Walker Killers band is fighting through the dead. Arya loses her sword and when the Night King is about to slash Arya's head off Jon prepares himself, holds on tighter to the Longclaw but the wights suddenly fall down like corpses, meaning, Arya killed the fucking Night King by putting the Valyrian Steel dagger in his heart.",2,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Here's the moment that I wish to change: When Jon is hiding behind a wall, he sees Arya slashing through the dead. He realises that Viserion must be distracted in order to let Arya reach Godswood, where Night King is standing in front of Bran with Theon ready to charge towards the Night King. Jon thinks this is the moment he was resurrected from the dead, to let Arya pass by so that she can save the world, so he steps out of that wall, but suddenly he feels a rush of energy through his body, he feels that Longclaw is getting hot and when he looks at his sword, the blade is on fire. He realises that Lord of Light will help him fight against the Dead Viserion. He stands firm, he puts up his sword and as Viserion blows his ice breath Jon cuts through these flames of ice with the help of his Longclaw. The eyes of the bear on the Longclaw are glowing yellow and so are Jon's. Arya is joined with Podrick and Gendry and as they enter the Godswood, here starts the epic sword fight between the White Walkers and the Living. Arya, Podrick,and Gendry kill the White Walkers and since killing of White Walkers will lead to wights dying, the other warriors like Jaime, Brienne, and Tormund join them as well. And when all the White Walkers are Dead, Night King turns towards the Three Eyed Raven. Theon charges towards the Night King after Bran forgives him by saying,""You are a good man, Theon."" and is defeated in an honourable way. Our band charges towards towards the Night King, led by Arya. The Night King raises his hands and the dead are brought back to life, Theon as well. Meanwhile, Jon is struggling through Viserion's ice breath and trying to look for a way so he could plunge his sword in it. Our band charges towards the Night King before he kills Bran, everyone else gives cover to Arya and we see Arya jumping out of thin air to kill the Night King from the back and the Night King turns around and holds Arya's neck, on the other side, Jon finally manages to climb on the angry Viserion and holds his sword and is ready to kill it. Jon plunges the sword in Viserion, slashing through his neck, he climbs down. Jon sees the mighty dragon fall down and as he looks around, he is being attacked by the rest of dead. Arya manages to get out of Night King's hold and our last hope against the Dead decides that she would not die without killing the NK. They both enter into an epic sword fight, while the rest of the White Walker Killers band is fighting through the dead. Arya loses her sword and when the Night King is about to slash Arya's head off Jon prepares himself, holds on tighter to the Longclaw but the wights suddenly fall down like corpses, meaning, Arya killed the fucking Night King by putting the Valyrian Steel dagger in his heart.",13,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

The songs don't have to be dead on serious, they can be humorous or ironic (as you'll see in my short list below I have some that only fit in a humorous way).

Ideally I would like a song for every character (Robin Arryn to Gilly to Sir Davos).


Right now I have the following:

Daenerys - Killer Queen by Queen

Bran - Comfortably Numb by Pink Floyd (for humor)

Little Finger - Tip Toe Through the Tulips by Tiny Tim

Night King - Behind Blue Eyes by The Who

Arya - I Am No One by Gemini Killer

Cersi - You Should See Me in a Crown by Billie Eilish

I'd already got the spoilers because a) I accidentally saw some and b) I lost interest in caring about not seeing them with how disappointed I was by season 8. 

But I have to say, putting aside the fact that the plot was so rushed and frankly because of that was a bit ridiculous, I actually enjoyed the first half of The Bells and also the finale. But in both it became ridiculous at around the half way point - in The Bells when Drogon/Dany just burnt all the innocent people and in the finale when the council took place. Before these two points in the episode I was enjoying it, ok the plot was ridiculously rushed and so it was highly unsatisfying in that regard, but it was a decent watch, with Sandor vs Gregor, and with Jon killing Dany, etc. But then the ridiculousness of the whole thing became too much and no amount of good acting or fight scenes could mask it.

Like many of you I'm sure, and as many of you have probably said, I think if only they'd executed the plot over two seasons, or at least a full season, it could have been so so much better. 

Look at the Sopranos (in my view a far superior TV show, obviously completely different genre, but executed properly pretty much all the way through) - they took 20 episodes in the last season to wrap things up properly. GoT could have done that, if the writers could be bothered...

I've always preferred the books to the show, although previously it was a much closer thing (seasons 1-5, until they overtook the books). I always worried about the show outpacing the books, and I think I was right to worry - and pacing was just the issue. Season 8 was paced so poorly it just ruined it. And if the books finish in a somewhat similar vein plotwise to the show (I can't see George rushing and ruining things so much, but who knows...), then I fear the show has sullied the books for me now...

Thanks a lot D&amp;D... You did a great job for a long time but then ruined it at the end!

Anyway, just wanted to get that off my chest!

TLDR: actually enjoyed the first half of the last two episodes, but then halfway through they just got ridiculous. The rushing of the season made it so poor and I fear that may tarnish the ending of the books for me",10,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

It's the Jon and Dany theme, ""Truth"", with vocals. The last season doesn't feature the track at all, and it's not a bonus/extra track (like the new version of Rains of Castamere).

In the album the music is listed between the Episode 5 and 6 tracks.

""We could live here for 1000 years"" was a Jon's quote, 8x1, at the waterfalls with Dany.

Can you explain this? Is it supposed to be a deleted scene? The track is too good. Or maybe could we expect an extended version of the season, in the Blu Ray?

I picked up on GOT in very early May and  binge watched the 73 episodes, completing the last episode on the  Tuesday after the finale. Watching the show in this manner is an  incredibly empty  and isolated experience. There is no doubt GOT is a  very good show, even taking into account the Season Eight issues, but  having now watched the show and having now found these online communities, it is evident that the speculating, anticipating, reviewing  and waiting with fellow fans along the way made the show extra special.

So  after the fact, is it possible for a person to watch the show in an  environment where this experience can be if not duplicated (that would  be impossible) but at least approximated? I cannot do that - I binge watched it not knowing how it would be in the end - but could a person  or a group of friends accomplish this if they were thoughtful about it?  Would a GOT second chance sub-Reddit or Facebook group work? Does HBO  intend to re-run the show at some point, giving people who missed on the  first viewing a chance to watch in something approaching real time? I  don't mean over an 8-year period, but something less isolating than four  weeks.

Many people in this sub and  others point out how they wish they could watch the show again for the  first time. But isn't what you really mean that you wish you could have  the entire GOT experience again for the first time? It seems to me there  is a big difference between the two.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

I'm posting about it now because I spoke to someone yesterday who had a similar thing happen and decided something had to be done about it.  

So I wasn't able to watch the episode S8E3 the night it aired.  I had to watch it the following day, and because I knew that people would be talking about it, I studiously avoided most forums, any entertainment websites, and immediately averted my eyes at any sign of a GoT article.  I did reasonable due diligence to avoid spoilers.

Somehow I ended up at a website that had a Daily Mail (yea, I know) article on it entitled, literally ""Arya Puts An End To The Night King."" I  had no time to avoid the headline.  Imagine for a second how much less you'd enjoy that episode knowing that going into it.  Probably the best moment in GoT ruined for me. 

Now here's the thing:  Who benefits from that fucking headline? Those who've seen the episode already know it, and those who don't watch the show don't care.  That leaves people like me:.  Those who haven't seen the episode, do care, and don't want to fucking know it.  

Can you imagine if a movie review title spoiled the Sixth Sense or Endgame?  People would be out for blood.  

I read that only 30% of TV show watchers actually watch an episode at airtime.  The majority stream or DVR it.  So these days, TV shows are akin to movies.  Journalists should show the same respect for TV viewers that they do for movie-goers.  

I'm not saying people shouldn't talk or write about a show afterwards, but there is no good reason to put a spoiler in a headline in a mass media news article.  There's always a risk of having something inadvertently spoiled (overhearing a conversation, etc.), and most journalists adhere to a policy of discretion, but it's time the rest learned it too.  

So you journalists out there - treat TV shows like you do your sources: Don't reveal them.",11,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

And they discover Tormund Giantsbane is with them and he reveals hes heard the White Walkers are real.

&gt; The true creator of the White Walkers is realized when Brans visions are revealed to Jon Snow. Bran sees an ancient hand holding a torch. Jon Snow orders the Hand, Littlefinger, to cast the torch into the lake of fire and bring Bran back into the real world.

The steady, rhythmic beating of his own wings was Drogon's only company. The sea passed steadily beneath him, and he then flew over lands he had explored years before, lands he had helped his mother conquer. Far beneath him, he could see people look up in fright at the sight of him, many running and screaming. They mattered little to him, his destination was his only objective.

In his claw, he cradled his mother's body. Sorrow reverberated through him for the many losses he had suffered; his mother, his brothers, even the physical loss of the only other human he knew to be of the dragon. Though he felt utterly alone, he knew the only path forward was the one he was taking.

Eventually, he came to lands that spoke to him in his bones, in his blood. Though he knew not the name of the land, only that he required the help of a human, one who had helped his mother, years before. He saw his destination from the air; a massive, sprawling temple below him, with fires lit throughout. Drogon began his descent.

Though he was accustomed to humans being terrified of his presence, the ones here did not react with fear, only admiration and respect. They bowed before him as he landed near the temple, careful of his mother's corpse in his claw, which he gently laid in front of him. Drogon spread his wings and roared, pain and sorrow apparent in the depths of his bellow.

From the firey depths of the temple, a red priestess appeared, head bowed, garbed entirely in deep crimson robes. As she approached Drogon, he stepped back from his mother's body. He knew this was the person he had been seeking, though he didn't know why.

The priestess approached his mother, knelt, and began speaking, quickly but quietly, over and over, in an ancient tongue. Seconds turned into minutes, turned into hours. Drogon waited, watching intently. Around him, other humans from the temple were kneeling with their heads bowed, also chanting in the old tongue.

Abruptly, the priestess stopped, her hand resting over his mother's chest. The steady, rhythmic chanting of the other priests and priestesses also ceased, in unison. The congregation all stood, heads bowed, facing his mother. Drogon's deep, orange-yellow eyes were fixated on her corpse. He felt something within him stir, something that had been dormant since he had left the smoldering remains of the iron chair behind him.

Daenerys gasped loudly, her eyes unfocused. She took several ragged breaths before her hand clutched her chest, where the knife that Jon Snow had plunged into her heart still remained. Her expression shifted, eyes focusing. She sat up, all fire and fury, and, gasping, pulled the knife from her chest.

Drogon stood and let out an earth-shattering roar, triumphant, exuberant. He moved towards his mother. The priests and priestesses remained silent, heads bowed, unmoving. Daenerys stood, shakily, clutching the knife in her hand. Drogon extended his claw towards her, bracing her body against him on her unsteady legs. He nuzzled her affectionately, and she leaned into him.

Suddenly, a murder of crows flew out of the trees near Drogon. Though he was unsure why, he felt an uneasiness about their presence, they seemed wrong to be in this land. Daenerys saw them as well; her eyes narrowed, and she uttered quietly but furiously, ""dracarys."" Drogon roared, wings spread, and from deep within his mouth spewed a raging fire. The crows were alight, and fell from the sky, their charred remains incinerated in an instant.

A world away, Bran gasped, his eyes unrolling and focusing acutely in the present. ""Did you find him?"" Tyrion asked anxiously. ""Even worse,"" Bran responded. ""I found her. And she's alive.""",10,13,False,spoiler,,,,,

It could still work. But: I would change just a few things that only would entail re-shooting two scenes:
1. In the scene where Daenerys is flying Drogon over King's Landings, I would CGI at least one spear flying through the air. With the idea being that this is what causes her to burn the whole city down. It would still convey the overreaction theme that D&amp;D were getting at and, arguably, be within Daenerys' character (she previously demanded that people kneel before if you recall and this is what she did; her problem is that she sees things in either black and white; this is the reason why she is not fit to rule). 
2. I would remove the stupid line about ""they don't get to choose"" and I would replace it with ""if they kneel"". I think ""they don't get to choose"" is a stupid line because even in democracies you don't get to choose everything I'm sorry (example: a majority could vote for slavery, and rightfully, people don't get to choose these things; I'm sorry but it reflects a simplistic understanding of how democracies work and it was line of dialogue that irked me).  
3. I would have Jon Snow die when killing Daenerys (example: some of her entourage notices that Jon has killed Daenerys and they corner and murder him; then you can have Drogon either kill them or scare them, whatever works, and burn the iron throne; Drogon grabs both of their bodies and the last shot of this scene is of the iron throne burning). 
4. The scene with the council. Instead of having Tyrion give that ""stories"" speech which didn't really work [imo], he would explain that essentially the reason why Bran would make a good king is that men have tried to lead and they have failed. With Bran you've got someone that can see the past and the future, that does not want, and can potentially rule for thousands of year, if not forever. Therefore, he would bring peace to the land. And you can still have Sansa also ruling over Winterfell. That's fine. Also, CGI Gendry in Sansa's ship scene in the background, and have the last shot be with Bran sitting in a new kind of throne or something.

If they use these ideas, I won't sue.",6,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Tyrion to Jon when he was imprisoned by Dany : I just realized Im talking to the only person who knows where Im going. Is there anything after death? 

I know its not impossible to be brought back - Beric kept coming back and most people knew of this. But it would have still been nice to see how people learned about Jon being killed by those who were suppose to be loyal to him and then brought back by Melisandre. I remember when he was resurrected and reunited with Sansa in the next episode where she told him they had to go fight for their home.

Ive made friends because of GOT. It was my life.

Then season 8 dropped. 

The first two episodes, I thought were fine. I felt like they were slightly underwhelming especially considering season 8 unfortunately only consisted of 6 episodes. But it wouldnt matter, as episode 3 would make up for it. 

Episode 3 aired. I watched it.

EPISODE 3 WAS A DISASTER. It made me depressed. Then ep4, launched, I got more depressed. The same for ep5. I was already plain broken, but deep down there still was some hope. A small light desperately wanting to come up to reveal itself for episode 6. 

Episode 6 aired. I sat down and started watching. With every minute my anxiety and feelings of hopelessness increased. Then, when Jon killed Daenerys I felt a hard cold blow struck right through my heart. It was over. I am over. I currently am still trying to recover but I just cant.

In Season 8 episode 2 (no spoiler), Sansa asked ""who else did you trust?"" and Daenerys  said ""A man who was taller"" or something like that. What if it was reversed ?

Sansa: Who did else did you trust besides her

Jon Snow: A women with bigger breasts 


Now, am I being too sensitive? I took their jokes more as social commentary more than the time period. Back then, dwarves were undesired, women were silenced more, slavery did exist, rape and murder were more rampant, etc. But for some reason I took the short men jokes more as a reflection of our society now as opposed retaining the GOT universe.",6,0,False,self,,,,,

What were his ultimate goals and his motives?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bvqnzp/spoilers_why_did_littlefinger_take_each_action/,breggen,1559429406,"Yes, his famous line is Chaos is a ladder so its possible that he did some things just in order to promote chaos and seize any opportunities that arose from that however I think many of his actions had specific results  in mind. 


1: He killed John Aryn in collusion with Lysa Aryn and made the Starks think it was the Lannisters doing:

Was he trying to start a war between the starks and Lannisters?

Did he know that Cerseis childrens were born of incest?  

Did he know that John Aryn knew when he killed him?

2: He seduced Lysa Aryn:

Was this just in order to kill John Aryn?

Was it to kill John Aryn and to also eventually become the deaf to leader of the eyrie?


2.5 (inserted later): He returned Ned Starks remains to Caitlyn Stark in order to win her bait and have an audience with her. 

What action was he hoping to convince Caitlyn Stark to take?

3: He offered to help Ned Stark take over the capital:

Was he sincere in that offer?

If Ned had accepted his offer why would have been the likely outcome?

Did he know beforehand that Ned would not accept the offer?

4: He probably informed Jamie Lannister that Ned Stark was about to leave the city, purposefully delayed his leaving the city, and told Jamie Lannister that he Ned could be found at one of his brothers. 
This was all after Caitlyn Stark had taken Tyrion hostage. 

Was he hoping Jamie would kill or imprison Ned? If so did he have a preference?

5: He betrayed Ned Stark but telling him that the gold cloaks would support him when they did not. 

Was this to try and start a war? Get rid of Ned? Both?
Was this simply to stay on the winning side because he determined that Ned was going to lose?

6: He conspired in killing Joffre and help Sansa Stark escape. 

Was his killing of Joffre  payback for the Lannisters having killed Caitlyn?

Did he care about Caitlyn at all at this point or only his own ambitions?

Was this primarily so he could control Sansa and through her potentially control the north?

Was this primarily so he could eventually use Sansa to incite conflict between the Boltons and the Lannisters?

He married Sansa to Ramsay Bolton and he informed Cersei about the wedding while pretending that he had no part in it. 
In return for this information he asked that he be appointed warden of the north after counseling g Cersei that she let the Boltons and Stannis fight each other and then fight the winner of that conflict. 

Was his profession of allegiance of the north under the leadership of the Boltons and the Eyrie/veil under his leadership always just a  ruse?

Was marrying Sansa to Ramsay just a way of bringing the Boltons and the Lannisters into conflict and getting himself appointed warden of the north?

If Stannis has won did he really expect Sanaa to survive and for Stannis to then appoint her warden of the north as he told Sansa?

7: He helped Sansa and John defeat the Boltons using his influence with the eyrie/veil. 

What was he hoping for after this?

To become partners with Sansa and rule the north with her?

8: What was his ultimate goal? To sit on the iron throne?  To be romantic partners with Caitlyn? To be romantic partners with Sansa?  What was most important to him?

Jorah and Barristan try to prevent her from doing it, and she turns and says sth like ""if you question my decision before strangers ever again, you'll be advising someone else"". It's the same episode when she tells Missandei ""yes, all men must die, but we are not men"", one of the better lines on the show! The former scene is probably one of my favourite Dany scenes on the show. And then in ep4, that epic scene where she adresses the Unsullied in Valyrian to the astonishment of everyone, Jorah and Barristan included. Epic, powerful, intelligent, wow!

And then, how come she is so self-confident here, so determined, so clever, thinking in advance, and not letting even her closest advisors prevent her from doing sth she is certain of, and, yet, in all of season 7 and season 8 she is persuaded by people who had far less influence over her not to attack KL when she thought it right, persuade her to do bizzare things such as taking a wight and bringing it before Cersei, negotiating with Cersei, etc. It is so obvious that it was only for storytelling, since they had an end they had to come to (provided by Martin) and, yet, no good story in between. They butchered Daenerys' character really, no matter which way it was heading (still, to me, her burning of KL and everyone there still makes no sense and is so out of her character in the show, as she was always trying to protect the weak and innocent; she might have become an apsolutist ruler, yet what we saw of her character in the show could not explain her decision).

It wasn't perfect, but it was still a satisfying ending of the series for me. However, there is one change I would make that I think would help a lot in regards to Jaime's journey south and ultimate death.  Here is how I would alter Jaime's plot in the final episodes.  


Jaime gets caught and imprisoned in Dany's camp outside of King's Landing because they think he's going back to join Cersei.  Tyrion goes to his tent (just to talk, not to free him) and the conversation gets heated. During the argument Jaime finally admits that he came south to **kill** Cersei, not join her.  He gives a little speech similar to the scene where he tells Brienne the reasons behind why he killed the mad king.  This keeps Jaime consistent with his desire to protect the innocents of King's Landing (same as when he tells Brienne).  With this newfound knowledge/perspective, Tyrion decides to free Jaime so that he can go kill Cersei (or force her into surrender). 

&amp;#x200B;

Remove the plot of Davos leaving a boat on the shore for Jaime and Cersei to escape.   


Later on, Dany is burning the city.  Jaime meets Cersei in the map courtyard while the Red Keep is beginning to fall apart. She is panicking just like how she does in the real show, asking not to die, etc.   Jaime's angry at first, but then he begins to soften, pitying Cersei.  There's a big dramatic moment where he must decide whether or not to kill his sister. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau could sell this with just his facial expressions I'm sure.  While the building starts collapsing around them, he ultimately decides not to kill her. Dropping his dagger, he comforts Cersei in their final moments, before they're both crushed beneath the falling stones.    


Ending his story this way allows Jaime to continue his forward character development (by moving past Cersei emotionally), while not regressing to just ""go back to her"".  It also mirrors Jon's decision in the final episode to kill Dany.  Both men in very similar situations, but Jaime chooses love over duty, while Jon chooses duty over love.",6,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

And sure that is true, but I think it does depend on how you look at that scene. I think you could say that that scene is still about her.

You could argue that Brienne is the most honourable character on the show, even above Eddard (she never lied to her family, or her King/person she pledged herself too) and Jon (she never broke a vow or killed the person she was pledged too). I could be wrong with that so please, correct me if I am.

So, when you get to that scene and she sees Jaimes name, should Brienne, (possibly) the most honourable character the show has, right at the last throw aside her honour and never fill out the book, just to spite him? I think it would undermine her character so much.

She chose to do the right thing, something Jaime failed to do time and time again and eventually it killed him. It highlights her honour, how she will be a better person and knight than he was.

I just dont look at that scene as her honouring a man the betrayed her in the end, I look at it as her staying true to her values, her honour and duty, not to a man, but as a captain and a knight of the Seven (now six) Kingdoms. 

I understand people will think different and have different opinions and of course you should, but thats just the way Ive always saw that scene.",10,14,False,spoiler,,,,,

There's obviously still a debate around the narrative satisfaction of Arya defeating the Night King, and the overall use of Bran during the entire War against the dead, but if Bran was going to battle the Night King, how would he do it?

The most obvious point is that Bran's warning abilities into the past have physical and tangible consequences, that was the entire purpose of Hodor's character. He can affect the physical realm and the 'here and now' through warging into the past. Maybe that's why he wanted to be positioned in the Godswood, next to the Weirwood tree, a source of power and influence for his warging abilities.  
What if his plan was the lure the Nightking to him, as in the show, but then touch him and Warg with the Weirwood tree, pulling the NK with him, similar to how characters would pull Freddy Krueger into the Physical realm.  
Once in this realm, Bran could go back to the NK's creation or do some other 3ER shenanigans and end the NK in a way that was more thematic and drew upon the ancient rivalry.

But hey, I don't have 2 Emmy Awards for outstanding writing in a drama series, so just the musings of a MUG.

* What will Bronn's House Words be?

KURTZ: In a war there are many moments for compassion and tender action. There are many moments for ruthless action, for what is often called ruthless, what may in many and many circumstances be the only clarity; seeing clearly what there is to be done and doing it directly, quickly, aware...looking at it.

So as I know we already know that the world is round and that theres 4 known continents 
-Westeros 
-Essos
-Ulthos
- sothoryos

We dont know much about sothoryos or ulthos or very far north (Westeros) And very far south (Essos)

So my theory is that Essos and Westeros by a massive land bridge at the top of the lands of always winter and Far East 

In the east near  Yi Ti theres a place called the the five forts that was used to keep the demons out similar to the wall 
Idea is that the white walkers originally went east first then south

\[SPOILERS\]   


""What unites people?"" he asks the group of Westeros representatives gathered to decide his fate. ""Armies? Gold? Flags? Stories. There's nothing in the world more powerful than a good story. Nothing can stop it. No enemy can defeat it.""   


Stories, myths and legends are more powerful than armies and gold. This dialogue seems to have been taken straight from the book 'Sapiens' by Yuval Noah Harari. In this brilliant book, the author says that one of the essential aspects of the evolution of humans as social beings are stories and myths that bind us. Some tales are , while some myths are imaginative. Yet, they manage to keep us together.   


Hence stories are myths are important. But just like the bedtime stories our granny's used to tells, stories can be both positive or healing or scary. One such legend was the legend of the Targayrens. Tyrion essential got the concept right, but he chose the wrong leader for the and the wrong story to potentially unite the people. The story of Jon Snow or Aegon Targyren was much more powerful and much more uniting than the story of 'Bran the Broken'.   


There is a popular saying in the North of Westeros- ""There must always be a Stark in Winterfell"". In the same lines, ""There must always be a Targaryen at Kings Landing"". I will dissect the reasons why Jon Snow, aka Aegon, is a much more rational choice as the ruler of Westeros with compelling arguments   


***1. The Story of Aegon the Conqueror***   


Aegon the conqueror along with his two sisters and three Dragons reigned upon the Westeros with full might and within a short period of time managed to conquer the entire continent. This event is so important that the dates in Westeros even today are mentioned as before or after Aegon's conquest (AC). 

The real history has also shown that a powerful ruler was often needed to unite the people. India, for example, was a subcontinent of disjointed kingdoms before Ashoka the great, and later the Moghals and the British managed to unite it. If it weren't for these powerful rulers, India would be a bouquet of fragmented nations constantly at war with each other.   
Mind you, Aegon was no saint. Though a mighty warrior and a reasonable ruler, he was someone whom people feared. Very few dared to cross Aegon or his sisters.   
One particular ruler Harren the Black refused to bend to Aegon. Aegon warned him, but yet Harren decided to give a fight. Aegon flew his Dragon over the walls of Harrenhall and burned the place to the ground. 'Burn them all'.   


Let us step back and look at this particular event with parallels from the current era of Westeros. When Dany was faced with a similar situation, she did a same thing. When Cersei refused to bend to Dany, she took her Dragon and burned the Kings Landing to the ground.   
The difference, however, was that Dany did this even though the bells were ringing and she had already won the battle. She had no reasons to burn the city down after they had already surrendered.   
While we can always debate what is right and wrong, one thing is sure that what Dany did had parallels to what Aegon did to Harrenhall. Both of them used their might to burn innocent people just because their ruler did not bend to their conquest.The story they wanted to develop was the story of 'fear'. This event is so well ingrained in the minds of the other Lords of Westeros that no one later challenged the might of the Targaryens.   


Historically, a few Lords and some bastards (like Blackfyres)did attempt to mess with the legitimate Targeyrens, but overall right from the time of Aegon till the time of Aerys, it was always a Targaryen which ruled Westeros.   


The Targaryen always had a better story than any other rulers of Westeros. For one, it was always believed that only a Targeryn could ride and control a Dragon (This was probably true). The fact that the Targeyans had Dragons by their side made them all-powerful form a military point of view. However, after the after many Dragons were killed in the Dance of the Dragons, the Dragons started to disappear. Once the Targeyans were devoid of their Dragons, their myth and legendary status began to fade. Now they needed to prove that they were much more than merely glorified Dragon riders. As history has shown that the general public likes status quo and in most stable nations, coups are rebellions are infrequent. This is what worked in favour of the later day Targeyans. This was all true, until the Aerys become mad and started killing people for now reason. This is when the rebellion started leading to unsettling a Targeyans for the first time since Aegon's conquest.   


***2. The Duality of power.***   


If you see the history of Westeros, it was always a dual power structure. On top of the food chain, you had a king who was the final authority in all matters of the state. However, the king was supported by a 'Hand of the king'. This is like the President and Prime minister situation in many countries around the world. A similar model is followed in modern times in constitutional monarchies. The king, though powerful, left most the day to day matters of the state in the hands of his Hand! Historically Westeros was blessed with some very able 'Hands' who were not only efficient in their work but also managed to balance the power of the king.   


Hence, Westeros was not always 'ruled' by a king. Most of the ruling was performed by the Hand. Therefore it makes little difference to who sits on the throne for the common man. The problems of the common man were mainly dealt by the Hand and his council of advisors.The King (or Queen) however provided an umbrella of stability and authority for the Hand to function. In the absence of this protective cover, the Hand had little or no jurisdiction.   
In the present state too, as shown in the last few scenes, it is practically Tyrion who rules Westeros and not Bran. Bran is busy chasing Dragons. This is exactly how things have been in most of the Westeros history. In the recent past, for example, Robert Baratheon was busy hunting and drinking, while a very able Hand of the King, Jon Arryn and for brief period Ned Stark effectively ruled Westeros. However, Robert provided an umbrella of authority and fear, which prevented other smaller states from rebelling against the Kings Landing. Robert could do this because Robert was a warrior in his past life and earned the respect of the people by killing another mighty warrior, Rhaegar Targaryen.   


***3. Why Jon is a better choice as king than Bran.*** 

  
There are several reasons why Jon would be a much better choice as ruler of Westeros than Bran.   


a) Jon is a Targaryen.   


Jon is a Targaryen who has in the past rode a Dragon. This gives him powerful cult status. If for some reasons we could find more dragon egg's the myth of Targeyans become stronger. If people had forgotten the power of the Targeyans, Dany had recently given them a refresher course. Hence even without a Dragon, Jon would still be feared by anyone who tries to rebel against him by the mere fact that he is a Targaryen.   


b) Jon is a proven warrior.   


Jon is a proven warrior and military commander. He has proven his worth in many battles. A warrior on the throne would always be more likely to hold his post compared to someone who has little or no military experience or expertise.   


c) Jon has 'earned' his respect.   


Jon Snow has earned respect. He is respected by everyone including the wildlings on the North of the wall. Everybody (except Grayworm) loves Jon Snow. On the other hand, very few people even know Bran let alone respect him. Also, Jon apart from being a Targaryen, is also a half Stark who is raised by Ned Stark. Jon is respected in Winterfell, and infant probably has a legendary status in Winterfell.   
d) Have Jon on the throne in name and let Tyrion rule.   
All we wanted was to have Jon Snow on the Throne and have let Tyrion rule as a Hand of the king. Jon needed to be a King just in name. He could very well roam about with his wildling friends and let Tyrion do his job. In fact, it seems Bran is probably doing the same. If you wanted someone to hand his or her name or story to the throne, why not have the account and title of 'Aegon Targeyan the 6th of his name' instead of 'Bran the Broken' the first of his name?   
***Would Grayworm and the Unsullied agree?***   


While we discuss the merits of having Jon Snow as the king and Tyrion as the Hand, both Jon and Tyrion were held captive by the Unsullied at the time of the discussion. Though this fact cannot be ignored, it is of little or no consequence. Though the Unsullied and the Dothraki were holding the Kings Landing, the combined armies of the all the seven kingdoms would very well have reigned upon these inconsequential warriors and defeated them for good. In fact having Jon Snow and Tyrion as prisoners was nothing but a joke !   


***A Final word***   


If stories are important, then there is no doubt that Jon Snow has a better story than Bran. If the name is important that again, there is little doubt that Jon Snow had a more powerful name and lineage than any living person in Westeros. If military might is important, there was no more exceptional warrior in Westeros than Jon Snow.   
Long live Jon Snow, aka Aegon VI Targaryen as the King of Westeros.

But Jons ending is a real head scratcher. 

Where exactly is Jon going? Why are certain points of that ending contradicting each other? If he was going to live with the free folk and leave Westeros permanently, why did they make it a point to show he changed out of his stark clothes into the Nights Watch uniform? Why not go with Stark clothes or wildlings gear? He is Lord commander and there is no one in the NW there apart from him. So no one to enforce the rules. In the montage we see him filling a pouch but its not a bag. Back in Season 6 when he was leaving the NW, they showed him handing the NW cape to Edd and filling a bag. Here he is filling a pouch and he still has his cape. 

Now there is no behind the scenes by D&amp;D to confirm this but the alternate ending of game of thrones actually had Jorah coming out with him and Tormund. Now I think Jorah wouldnt go to stay with the wildlings so does this imply Jon is still in the NW and has to come back to Castle Black again? And if that is the case why did they show hat dramatic glance back and smile as the door closes? Sophie says in an interview he is at castle black so it seems even the cast is confused. 

Why not make it simple, show him move out in wildlings clothes or stark clothes and set it in stone?
If he respects the institution its his personal choice to live with the wildlings so why would he go wearing that uniform?

And if he does go to live with the wildlings. What is his purpose in life? All the other characters have a purpose. Mance was only King beyond the wall so as to unite wildlings and get past castle black as winter was coming. Now they are welcome in the North anyway so whats the point?

My name is Ira, I'm from Russia. My English level is not very high. I hope you enjoy my alternative ending to the Game of Thrones. 
 
Remember the beginning of the last series: the ruined King's Landing, the dead Cersei and Jamie, the execution of Lannister warriors. It all remains. Next, Daenerys summons to itself all the representatives of the houses (which we saw at the end of the last series). And orders the unsullied to kill those who ""betrayed""her. Heads fly from Sansa and Tyrion's shoulders. In addition, maybe Arya will be secretly killed. So that the audience really hated Danny. John, distraught with grief over the loss of his sisters, tries to attack Daenerys, but the Gray Worm is faster. So for a couple of minutes we lose our favorite characters, sit in shock, hate Daenerys and Directors of the series. Meanwhile, Daenerys announces that the war is not over, we need to clean up the whole world. On the back proudly shouts the dragon. And now the most interesting &gt; 
 
Seeing all this fucked up Sam comes up to Brandon and says ""You gotta fix this! Go back in time and warn them."" Brandon answers that he can't, he just looks and doesn't affect anything. But Sam says, ""You told me that your father heard you in the past, and that Hodor became Hodor because of you. There's a chance. We have nothing to lose."" (Actually the dialogue should be longer, but I won't wright it) And Brandon, rolling his eyes, begins the journey through history. We see different moments from the past (a little nostalgia) where he tries to shout to the heroes, but nobody hears him. Their thoughts are occupied with war and other problems. 
 
Then Brandon goes back in time even further, to Aerys Targaryen (Daenerys's father). He tries to convince him that far to the North the threat, ice walkers, which need to burn. But king hears only ""need to burn"" and go the sum on the subject. We see how the Mad king was mad. And Brandon moves on. Is happening as-would rewind ago. The sun rises in the West and sets in the East. Brandon understands that he has only one thing - he must prevent the creation of the King of the Night. We see a scene with the children of the forest, where Brandon tries to shout to them, but all in vain. And at the last moment he takes the place of that unfortunate man and takes the ice into his heart. Brandon becomes king of the Night. 
 
He doesn't know what to do, he thinks to kill himself, but the children of the forest explained to him that you cannot change history. And Brandon understands that without the King of the Night, John will not be resurrected by the Lord of Light. And he and Daenerys would never meet. So then we go through the story and moving on to the third series last season where the King of the Night standing over a Brandon. Ie, he looks at himself. Here arrives Arya, but the King of the Night knows what will happen next, because he already saw it when he was Brandon. We see again this epic moment, but with one change - the King of the Night intercepts the knife and throws Arya. And he turns to Brandon and... touches him. And Brandon from the King of the Night gets the memories of how mad Daenerys, all burned, etc. Arya jumps a second time, kills the night King. Brandon tells John everything he saw. John decides not to tell anyone he's Targaryen. 
 
Next, we see an ambush on the Dragon stone. Greyjoy gives orders to the soldiers. Everyone looks around, there is an ominous silence. Suddenly there is a cry of a dragon - Daenerys flies on a Dragon. All weapons are pointed in her direction. The second before the shot. But then back to the fleet flies John around on a dragon and burns all. Two dragons flying nearby, playing music, Ira crying with happiness  The result: the dragon is alive, Missandei not captured, Daenerys and Grey Worm don't go crazy. Then quickly negotiations with Cersei, King's Landing surrenders without a fight. Tyrion helps the siblings to run. John understands that love is stronger than education and marries Daenerys. After the coronation, Denny tells John that she is pregnant and does not understand how it can be that the curse has fallen. And we remember how during Brandon's journey the sun rose in the West and set in the East.

Some pre-existing footage reworked, reordered or re-dubbed as follows:

* 

PREVIOUSLY, IN GAME OF THRONES:

Atop the city walls, Missandei still alive nearby, Cersei CLAIMS: ""You're only a child, riding a monster!""

* 

EPISODE: THE BELLS

A sea of CLOUDS. Surfacing, Drogon ROARS. Her arms outstretched, Dany YELLS. Grief? Joy?

They DIVE down.

* 

Varys: ""It's been 2 weeks. Where are they? What are they doing?""

Tyrion (worried): ""She's done it before. Open air is good for the dragon. Don't worry.""

Varys: ""People talk. Cersei could attack us with the Iron Fleet, the Golden Company, or who knows."" He brandishes a bunch of his handwritten LETTERS. ""Time to consider the alternatives, Lord Tyrion!""

Tyrion (firm): ""She'll be back. Keep your birds quiet, Varys.""

Varys: ""Well, in that case, who's gonna take Missandei's place as the Queen's closest friend and confidante?""

Tyrion, upset/anguished, has no answer.

Outside, Drogon BELLOWS!

* 

When the Imp arrives at the top of the tallest tower, the dragon looks GREAT.

Dwarfed under a wing, her clothing half-TORN, her skin SUNNY, her smile HEARTWARMING, Daenerys.

Tyrion asks ""A long Vacation, my Queen!? Found the Edge of the World!?""

She answers ""It's farther than you think! We needed to be alone.""

He wonders ""And now?""

She beams ""Not alone.""

* 

BLACKWATER BAY. DAWN. CLOUDY.

Drogon and Dany DEEPDIVE upon the Iron Fleet!

When several BOLTS are about to hit 'em, they strenuously EVADE!

MIXED with their images:

ANOTHER dragon (smaller, different color, scales, tail, horns) flies LOW over the waves, almost in range of the ships!

A Scorpion points at it, shoots! It EVADES!

Yet another DRAGON, attacking from a blind spot, TORCHES the machine, operators, and ship!

About 10 more DRAGONS (some bigger/older than Drogon, with more battle SCARS) INBOUND from several directions at once!

The Scorpions TURN to point / shoot at 'em!

The dragons EVADE / FIRE back!

3-4 are hit / killed by Scorpion bolts. The rest BURN the Fleet down, turn to follow Drogon and Daenerys towards the City beyond.

* 

Jon (worried): ""And she won't tell where she found 'em, or how she controls 'em?""

Tyrion: ""Not to me. Next time you get her alone, don't forget to ask.""

* 

KING'S LANDING.

Drogon and Dany attack!

MIXED with their images:

Several dragons DEEPDIVE to the city center, then spread outwards, attacking the wall defenders from behind!

Others FLY into danger only to swiftly EVADE bolts!

A big abundantly-scarred one CLIMBS the wall to surprise its defenders from below.

Many defenders FLEE their posts!

The Scorpions atop the City walls KILL half the dragons before being burned down.

* 

The City perimeter ablaze or in ruins, Dany and Drogon LAND on a tower. Drogon SHRIEKS!

The remaining 4-5 'recruit' dragons ANSWER, then LAND on walls and towers too.

Terrified people and soldiers point at 'em, stare, FLEE from 'em.

The City BELLS begin to TOLL.

Drogon GROWLS. Dany CALMS him.

* 

The other dragons grow AGITATED as the bells keep TOLLING.

As Daenerys looks on, ALARMED, they start flying again!

A 'recruit' dragon TORCHES a church!

Dany SCREAMS! Drogon takes to the air, towards the Red Keep.

The other dragons don't follow! They're too intent in destroying the bell towers, burning the surroundings too!

Dany and Drogon harass 'em, trying to force 'em to concentrate on the Red Keep, with only partial success.

The big dragon helps Drogon DESTROY the Keep's towers.

But the others SPREAD thru the City, FIRING at soldiers and civilians indiscriminately!

Drogon and Dany ATTACK 'em! They put up token fights, then FLEE.

The big one FACES OFF Drogon. Both ROAR and threaten while buildings BURN/crumble around. Finally, it FLEES too.

Daenerys, aghast, watches the City's CARNAGE.

Grim-faced, she commands Drogon to finish destroying the Red Keep.

651,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2019-6-2,2019,6,2,19,bvw4el,self.gameofthrones,"[Spoilers] Binged the show in a week and a half, some thoughts",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bvw4el/spoilers_binged_the_show_in_a_week_and_a_half/,dnjksandkj,1559472096,"Important disclaimer, I already watched the first 3 seasons as they came out, then decided to stop and wait for the whole thing to be available, and in the meantime I picked up a LOT of spoilers (mostly I just knew the fate of almost all the characters in the show, but I didn't know when a particular death or event would happen or how.) I feel like knowing these things impacted my experience of the later seasons positively.

First of all, I think the whole show is enjoyable from beginning to (almost) end and worth watching. I think there's a clear change for the worse in the quality of writing starting with season 5, and there's another dip on top of that with season 7, as the show stopped favoring interesting dialogues and started focusing more on the story and on big spectacles. It's unfortunate, but I didn't mind that personally.

Regarding season 8, I would both agree and disagree with people who hated it.

I think the quality of the writing, which everyone hates, actually rebounded to former glory (in part). Having watched the whole show in such a small time frame makes everything a little blurry, but I clearly remember the first few seasons being extremely quotable (about once or twice per episode there would be a line that gave me a rush.) With season 5 and 6 these great quotes happened much more rarely, like once every four or five episodes, and I don't really remember much of interest from season 7 off the top of my head, but the first three episodes of season 8 hit me like a truck. It felt like prime Game of Thrones.

I think the first three episodes were handled perfectly (except The Long Night in terms of cinematography which was fairly stupid; specifically, I mean the choice of putting everyone in a 1v50 and then making them all survive when they could have just as easily filmed it so that every character had an escape route that would make it at least somewhat plausible for them to survive any of the scenes they were in, but they didn't do that, so what can you do.) The fourth episode is still pretty good, I thought the aftermath of the battle was very pleasant to watch, although I disliked most of what came afterwards (Sansa scheming, the fact they cut her and Arya's reaction to Jon's news about his identity, etc.) I do agree with people who hated the last season when it comes to the last two episodes though, where both the writing and the events that happened left me quite perplexed. Visually speaking 'The Bells' is one of the best episodes in the series, but I think that they didn't have anywhere near enough time to develop that arc, and so they should have written a different ending for Dany that would diverge from the books (this is coming from someone who disliked her character from the very start back in season 1; I didn't mind that she didn't win, but nuking a city just cause of this 'Targaryen madness' as they call it wasn't a good idea and felt almost non-canon in a way.)

Regarding common complaints I see online about the season:

-Leaving just one episode for the Night King's defeat certainly isn't ideal, but I didn't mind it. If you choose to do a 6-episode season then it makes sense to do it that way, and in terms of story it also makes sense to have the dead lose there. There's enough of the dead to make defending Winterfell impossible but it's still a possibility to get to the Night King before he wipes everyone out, and we're at the point where, considering how the army of the dead works, they would gain too many men from killing everyone in Winterfell, meaning that it truly is a last stand. If the dead win, they get two more dragons and almost double their army, making it so that Westeros would have to fall without a doubt. It makes no sense to have the main characters lose at Winterfell and then win elsewhere, and there isn't enough space in the season to let that storyline breathe the way it should, so I feel like the disappointment that came with the episode was a bit disingenuous. People should have expected a one-off, and as one-offs go, this is one of the better ones in my book. I also agree with the director that it wasn't too dark, it's only dark if you watch it in low definition, but as someone who watched it the way it should be, I had no issues whatsoever.

-Arya killing the Night King instead of Jon. This complaint I just don't agree with at all. First of all, even though there's a lot of things that don't make too much sense in the later seasons, that doesn't mean that we can just add another one to the pile because it's 'supposed to be him'. That battle is the most excruciating one yet, and by far the most confusing, what are the chances it's Jon the one that gets to inflict the final blow? Literally anyone could have done it and it would have been fine from a storytelling point of view. Everyone is chipping in and giving their life for that battle. Jon's role, the way I see it, was to bring everyone together and to win Dany's favor so that they would stand a chance against the Night King, which he fulfilled. More importantly, it would have made Arya's little adventure in Bravos meaningless (aside from character development). Everyone's character development plays a role in the story if you think about it: Bran journeys North of the Wall to become the next Three-Eyed Raven, which is supposed to chronicle the history of civilization and makes him the best candidate for leading Westeros into a new era, Sansa suffering as much as she did enabled her to retake the North, Jon's experience North of the Wall also led to the recapture of Winterfell which was essential in order to defeat the Night King, and then there's Arya, whose arc would have had no relevance to the story if her skill, developed thanks to the training she had in Bravos as well as on the way there, wasn't used to kill the Night King. She's the only one who was trained not to be noticed, and I can personally get behind the idea that the best way of killing the Night King is through surprise, more than sheer skill with a blade. The way she kills him, with a trick, makes more sense to me than regular combat. Of course they could have written an epic fight between the Night King and Jon or any knight, but I think that calling Arya jumping out of the shadows 'random' or 'not thought out' is doing the episode a disservice.

-Bran being useless as a character. I'm not the right person to defend this since he's one of my favorite characters, so here's why he wasn't useless: he creeped the fuck out of everyone in the funniest, most exciting way, thus adding value to the show every time he opened his mouth. Him regurgitating stuff that other people had said back to them was either hilarious or epic ('chaos is a ladder', chilling a character who had never lost an argument prior to that moment in the series, letting us see him taken aback for the first time; what he said to Theon during The Long Night; the way he referred to Jaime when waiting for him, etc.); on a more serious note, while it was Dany's arc to break the cycle in Westeros, I feel like he's the perfect person to take on that job. Since he isn't Bran anymore, and since he doesn't feel neither fear nor anger, he truly is a one of a kind, never before seen kind of a ruler. Also being able to, at times, see glimpses of the future must help a lot. It makes sense to me that he would be the King, since before him every one of the kings or queens had severe, human flaws (the Mad King was, well, mad, Robert Baratheon was no king and was only interested in earthly pleasures, Joffrey was a fucking psychopath, Tommen was too naive and good-natured, and Cersei was a vain, self-centered ruler who, as others in the series put it, was nowhere near as intelligent as she believed herself to be.) Bran is completely different in that regard.

-Jaime going back to Cersei makes perfect sense if you binge the show. I'm not going to tell you that him staying at Winterfell with Brienne wouldn't have made sense either, they could have gone either way, but to me it makes more sense seeing him go back to her. Ever since the start if you analyze his character, you can tell that he's never evil, but rather does evil things, and the things he does he only does for her, so essentially he can't break free of her (as he once put it early in the show, 'we don't get to choose who we love'.) He left her because he felt he had to, but couldn't leave her to die alone when he knew they would lose the war and she would die. A bitter ending for a rather bitter story, I personally prefer it to the happy ending with Brienne although, considering the end of season 6 and his reaction to it upon coming back to King's Landing, that wouldn't have been out of character either. Both routes were set up, nothing wrong with going down either of them.

I do agree with complaints for anything that came after episode 4 though. Dany going mad just because she is a Targaryen makes no sense and I feel like that's more obvious if you picture Jon going on just such a frenzy. Instead of her going insane due to her bloodline, she should have just torn down the Red Keep, hence killing quite a few people who were hiding there. It would have made more sense because up until that point she had never really lost anything. Some people rebelled here and there but it was fairly simple to fix that issue, but in Westeros the situation was different. Her dragons, the one thing that makes her holier-than-thou attitude understandable, were dying one after the other. If she lost her last dragon she pretty much would have become just another player in the game of thrones, so now things are for the first time getting serious for her. The more she waits, the more of a risk that her final dragon will be killed, and having Tyrion mess all her strategies and her losing Missandei, it would have made sense that she would be scared and enraged to the point of doing something like that, but destroying the whole city was just stupid in my opinion, and even worse was her justifying it afterwards instead of getting ahold of herself and understanding the terrible mistake she had made, almost as if she wasn't herself for a (rather long) moment. They could still have made her go mini-mad and it would have made perfect sense, but they went down the wrong path in a way that, to me, makes the rest of the show unwatchable.

The way they handled Varys also feels very disrespectful to the audience. I didn't mind personally because they used him so little ever since him and Tyrion got separated in season 5, so I wasn't quite as attached to the character as I was earlier in the series, but it certainly does feel like a bit of a joke, that this master of conspiracy would make such odd blunders.

Also this isn't relevant to discussing the show but I still want to talk favorites. I actually rated every single episode as I watched them; my favorite one was The Watchers on the Wall, followed by Battle of the Bastards and in terms of seasons, I would rate them (going from best to worst) -&gt;6, 1, 4, 8 (if you stop at 8x03), 3, 2, 5, 7, 8 (if you stop at the end).

I think it really helps to enjoy the show if you can keep in mind that as the show went on, priorities shifted from writing (1-4) to story (6), to fan-service and spectacle (7-8). Yes, it could have been the best show ever made, no, it ended up not being that, yes, it could still have been 10 times better, no, it ended up being this instead, but if you want to enjoy it I think you'll find there is a lot to appreciate still.

Occasionally, he has served evil kings (ex. Joffrey) and has remained passive during injustices (ex. he did not release Ned Stark even though he knew he'd be executed).

Why? Because he knew that given the circumstances, if he chose to intervene things would eventually become worse. In essence, Varys knows that in order for Good to realistically triumph, you may have tolerate Evil for a period until the time is ripe to act. He knows that acting prematurely and upon impulse is doomed to fail and can have dire consequences. This is something most Starks failed to realise.

If you think about it, this is also applicable in real life. Given the circumstances and your power, you may have to play along in order to eventually achieve what's best for everyone. What is better? To react against an injustice when you know you don't have the power to make any difference or stay low and keep secretly working towards what's best?",24,22,False,self,,,,,

Skip to 10:52. 

I was watching Emergency Awesomes video and in the analysis about the alternate ending, he says the writers confirmed a couple of things about Jon. They say he is ranging the far North for the rest of his life. He isnt staying with the wildlings. He intends to take his vows seriously and not marry or have any children. :(

I am not finding any document about the writers confirming this so is it true? If this is the case, will he atleast visit Winterfell every now and then to see Sansa as it seems he wont start a family with any wildling woman as he intends to take his vows seriously or will he isolate himself in the far reaches of the North?

Daenerys goes insane at the end and destroys Kings Landing and specifically targets civilians,burning them,street by street.This literally makes her the worst person in recorded Westerosi history,no one has ever killed as many civilians as Daenerys did in a single day.So,whats the message here?The apple doesnt fall far from the tree comes to mind here because her father intended on doing the same thing,except she actually did it.So whats the point of her doing all the great things she did in previous seasons,just so she can be reduced to genetics.Im having trouble finding what the moral of her story is.Ambition is bad?Bullshit,ambition is great and this type of message is so cliche and trite that it just doesnt fit with GRRMs thing of subverting cliche fantasy tropes and adding in a sense of realism.

Even though the episodes before disappointed me, I praised the finale as ""near perfect."" It was rushed, yes, but the pitfalls of it were due to the episodes leading up to it, not the episode itself. From a conclusion standpoint, I liked the ending and thought the finale was amazing.

Two weeks later, I changed my opinion (slightly). I now have issues with the finale as well (that time jump was just too convenient and robbed us of the aftermath of Dany's death). I still am modestly satisfied but acknowledge lots of flaws and ways it could have been improved.

Meanwhile, my disappointment with the speedy resolution of the White Walkers has actually *grown* during the past couple of weeks. I struggle to identify their ""narrative purpose"", and I can't help but grow more disappointed that we didn't see them in actual combat.

Call it the ""Acceptance"" stage if you will, but I have come around to admitting that the final season disappointed me - while also acknowledging that the ending was ""good enough"" to preserve the series as a whole for me. The ending was fitting but rushed, but I think in context, the place it ended is fitting for the series as a whole. The ending makes sense, I just wished it were fleshed out. But it could be worse - it could have been so out of left field that it failed to be logical.

Overall, I think I'm able to look at this season much more objectively two weeks out. There were a lot of great *moments* (I thought the Long Night was a phenomenal episode and visually stunning, but lacked a lot of the critical moments I was hoping for, not to mention too abrupt a conclusion - same for The Bells). The final Throne Room scene was beautiful but also lacked emotional depth. The score was fantastic and the acting was incredible. It was just too damn rushed. I'm convinced that if they had done 10 episodes it would have been near perfect.",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I haven't read the books yet. I am planning to. Of course, when you're late to the party, you're undoubtedly gonna get spoiled. Still, I enjoyed every twist and turn, even the ones I did know about already.

Anyways. We finished Season 7 Thursday, and we were waiting to start ""the dreaded Season 8."" Yesterday (Saturday), we finished it in one go. It is undoubtedly one of the, if not the best show I have ever watched. Absolutely beautiful. The ending wasn't perfect by any means, but it deserves so much more credit than it's given. I am not completely sure why it is so negatively viewed, but here's my take on it:

If you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention. I absolutely hate what happened, but I understand it had to happen. I wish everyone could ride off happily into the sunset, but that's just the happy thinking of a naive, young boy. This is the Game of Thrones. You win, or you die.

Now, for the obligatory ""how it should have ended"" and a few cons:  
The seasons should have been 10 episodes. Especially the last one. It felt much too packed. A lot more time should have been dedicated to the downfall of Daenerys. A lot more time should have been dedicated to many characters.

The Battle of Winterfell should have ended much more dramatically. So much buildup, Ramin setting us up for some huge shit to go down, and- He's just dead. The Big Baddie, dead just like that. Should've had a bad-ass fight.

A tad less time should've been spent on the destruction of King's Landing. By the end, it seemed drawn out. That time could have been devoted to more of explaining why she snapped.

The first half of the last episode was fucking breathtaking. I couldn't believe it. It was horrifying. Terrifyingly beautiful, heartbreaking, and amazingly executed. But then, we have a jarring transition to... Bran. The most exciting character. (Sarcasm). That should have been a separate episode. An episode should have ended with Daenerys's death. Another episode should have focused on rebuilding, writing, and the future. Not a rushed half-hour attempt at a conclusion. Also, I think Jon should have died. He's been through so much crap, it felt like he wanted to die. I don't even know what the hell he's going to do in the North.

&amp;#x200B;

Other than that, I would change nothing more, lest I stray from what the story is supposed to be. With that being said, let me end on a high note. Here are some of the best parts of GoT.

\-PHENOMENAL acting. Absolutely insane.

\-ASTOUNDING music. Ramin is up there with the likes of Hans Zimmer.

\-BREATHTAKING views. I don't know enough about the CGI, filming, etc, but it is a BEAUTIFUL looking show.

\-MAGNIFICENT story. Even if it wasn't put together as well as some would have liked, it's a damn good story. It makes sense.

&amp;#x200B;

I say again: It is the best show I've ever watched. I'm not gonna let a SLIGHTLY less than average season ruin it for me.

Thoughts?

Two weeks later, I changed my opinion (slightly). I now have issues with the finale as well (that time jump was just too convenient and robbed us of the aftermath of Dany's death). I still am modestly satisfied but acknowledge lots of flaws and ways it could have been improved.

Meanwhile, my disappointment with the speedy resolution of the White Walkers has actually *grown* during the past couple of weeks. I struggle to identify their ""narrative purpose"", and I can't help but grow more disappointed that we didn't see them in actual combat.

Call it the ""Acceptance"" stage if you will, but I have come around to admitting that the final season disappointed me - while also acknowledging that the ending was ""good enough"" to preserve the series as a whole for me. The ending was fitting but rushed, but I think in context, the place it ended is fitting for the series as a whole. The ending makes sense, I just wished it were fleshed out. But it could be worse - it could have been so out of left field that it failed to be logical.

Overall, I think I'm able to look at this season much more objectively two weeks out. There were a lot of great *moments* (I thought the Long Night was a phenomenal episode and visually stunning, but lacked a lot of the critical moments I was hoping for, not to mention too abrupt a conclusion - same for The Bells). The final Throne Room scene was beautiful but also lacked emotional depth. The score was fantastic and the acting was incredible. It was just too damn rushed. I'm convinced that if they had done 10 episodes it would have been near perfect.",40,12,False,spoiler,,,,,

I bought an HBO subscription a month before the final episode aired, and basically binge watched the entire series for the month. Ended up watching the final episode a day after it came out.

The biggest thing that confuses/bothers me about the show is how rushed and sloppy the whole last season (and parts of season 7) felt. Now, I didnt watch this show for years, and I never followed GOT-related news, so Im wondering if there might be some explanation regarding the sudden drop in quality?

I always thought Game of Thrones was a well-paced, intelligent TV show, and to see such a huge shift was, well, jarring. Even for a newbie to the show like me. Does anyone know anything about this?

Her ""love"" for Jon also appeared to be conditional on him swearing fanatical loyalty and not challenging her. She wanted his armies as well. Also she seemed to really enjoy the fact that the unsullied were brainwashed devotees. Did she care about ending slavery more than attaining that army of fanatics? Did she care about the Dothraki people more than having their forces? 

Was Dany ultimately a narcissistic dictator who viewed others as tools on her path to power but had just a sidenote of humanity? She was shown to be genuinely distraught over Jorah's death after all.

It's super obvious in the books. It's a lot more subtle in the show because, given that it's not a book, it does not go deep into her actual thought process. Nonetheless, even in the show, the writing was on the wall. 

People thought Dany was a ""good guy"" because she supported slave revolts and liberated cities. *Supporting slave revolts does not make you a good person. Being a liberator does not make you a good person.*

People were blinded by Dany because she's charismatic and Emilia Clarke is pretty, plus dragons. People overlooked her true nature. 

The nature of Dany's madness is her megalomania. She's a hardcore narcissist who relentlessly seeks power and is ruthless in her pursuit of it. She also has a benevolent and caring side to her. She is charismatic and likable, and it's easy to support her cause.

Most fantasy characters are influenced by archetypes. Usually in Disney fantasies like Star Wars and Marvel, or Tolkien sort of Lord of the Rings type fantasies, the people who burn down cities are beings of pure evil and sadism. 

GRRM hates fantasy archetypes and he has always been influenced more by historical figures rather than fantasy archetypes.

How did Jon get his hands on hair Gel in Prison? Ok that was a cheap one. 
2. How did Dany not get slightly suspicious that Jon may try to kill her in her 'Mad Queen' state? I mean he is the main threat to her throne after all.
3. The Night king was built up as an almost God like threat for 7 seasons ..... ANNNNNND hes gone..... took 1 hour to kill him. I mean it was harder to kill Ramsey ! Cmon ! 
4. Hold on.... Why is Jon going to do in the Knights watch now? Wasn't the whole point of the Knights watch to defend from the the threat of White Walkers..  who are now all dead.
5. And why did Jon need to listen to Grey Worm who's heading away anyway?... Arent Bran and Sansa now in charge...? He also happens to be the actual heir to the throne.
6. Also on the topic of Bran, why was everyone so happy to vote him in as King, to most people he's just a crazy kid who has weird visions..... In fact some of them had never even met him before.
7. Why should they even believe in Bran, when Sansa (his own sister) clearly didn't and forced independence. 
8. I mean, Yara would definitely be the sort of person who would have wanted independence. 
9. Back to Jon, why did no-one mention he was Aegon Targaran once during his 'trial'? I mean what was the actual point of anyone finding out about that?

10.Also why didnt Drogon kill Jon for killing Dany? 
11. On the topic of dragons. How did Rheagel not see Eurons ships at all before he was shot dead . I mean there was a lot of ships FGS!!
12. Why did nobody mention the fallen Starks once all season? Ned did not die for this!
13. Bronn as Master of coin? Excuse me? Expect a hit on the Westeros economy..
14. Back to Bran, he was unable to be Lord of Winterfell a few seasons back because he was 'no longer bran' . soooo who's that on the throne? Three Eyed Raven? Who knows...
15. Im sure all the Dothraki died at the start of 'The battle of Winterfell', So why are they showing up all over the final seasons. Did they forget they died? Did you die though?!!!!!
16. They didn't actually tell us what happened with Drogon. WHERE DID HE GO ?
17. Going back to the Night King, WTF did he even want ? Particularly with Bran ? Guess we will never ever know.
18. How were the Unsullied supposed to start their own house. None of them can have kids right? 
19. How was it even possible for Dany to get so bloodthirsty in less than an episode. 
20. We will never find out what Arya finds West of Westeros.

I love him because he is a complicated character with a simple motivation. Everything he does is to renew his lost love with Catelyn. Hed burn down the entire kingdom just to be with her. He proves this beyond any doubt in the very first season. 

Eventually that love turns to Sansa, but I wont spoil why this happens for those who dont know (you all obviously do anyway). 

He is a devious schemer who makes big moves and risky decisions in order to feel love again. Hes a tragic character who never got over a broken heart. I feel bad for him but hes also a pretty bad dude. 

Hes smart but delusional in his quest for Catelyn/Sansas love. Hes cunning but foolish to think hell succeed. He also gets close to powerful people but remains distant enough as to not catch too much attention. He is a fantastically flawed character and I love him.",6,10,False,self,,,,,

If you disagree, I would love to hear your side of things and any refutes you have to my points.

&amp;#x200B;

Since this is dealing with Jaime's final days though, I feel it's important to go in a semi sequential order with the three main complaints I've heard about this.  


1) Why Jaime leaves Cersei only to return immediately  
2) Why he sleeps with Brienne only to leave  
3) Why he says he never cared about the innocent  


A lot of people have trouble with the fact Jaime leaves Cersei to fight the army of the dead, only to immediately return. Why would he betray his sister, and change his mind a couple episodes later? Well, let's look at Jaime's characterization and what he cares for.  


Jaime loves Cersei, no one can deny that. The books are even careful to show Jaime is practically addicted to his love for her, and even while she's pissed at him and he's upset with her he can't go a chapter without thinking about how great it would be if they could get married, abandon the Iron Throne, and have a nice life of growing old in Casterly Rock. It's this love for Cersei that originally made him join the Kingsguard, made him try killing a child, and made him keep going after he lost his sword hand (his way of life). Cersei is for all intensive purposes the reason Jaime lives. And, while yes, you can bring up how badly she treats and manipulates him all day: he doesn't care. To him Cersei is the love of his life, and nothing can change that.   


So why did Jaime leave his sister to stop the army of the dead, only to immediately return? For the same real reason that he killed the Mad King Aerys without regret: it saved the lives of hundreds. Jaime knew the army of the dead would kill everyone if it wasn't stopped, and his sister was being an idiot and not helping stop it. He knew that, so he went up north to help fight it, even knowing he might die or be executed. Jaime knew killing Aerys might be the same for him. Even if when he killed Aerys he wasn't executed for breaking his oath, he knew his name would be smeared for life, and that he'd be vilified for what he did. But that didn't matter, so long as Jaime saved the innocent.   


He is a wannabe knight in shining armor, and for all intensive purposes is. He vies for the hand of the princess he loves, he protects the innocent at all costs, and fights evil of the world. The only problem is he lets all of that corrupt him in his life. For him going up north and fighting the army of the dead was just another thing he needed to do to help the world, even if his sister hated him for leaving. And from his point of view, going up north and fighting the army of the dead was him protecting the woman he loved from a creeping threat. Not a betrayal of her in its entirety.   


So why does he sleep with Brienne then, betraying his single target love toward Cersei? and why does he leave immediately after then? Because he'd been given a new chance. A new chance to have a life of his own, with a woman who loves him in a healthy relationship way. A chance to find a new path and have a new life, down the redemption path many thought he was going down.  


And then he realizes he can't do it.  


He will always be the Kingslayer to them, he will always be the one who was in love with his sister, the mad queen. He will always be the oath breaker who crippled Bran and caused pain and suffering for hundreds because of his secrets. Even if Brienne could forgive him, the world never will. And what would he be doing as he sets back and lives this life? watching his sister, the true love of his life, get captured and probably given a slow and painful public death for what she's done. He knows Dany is going to make sure Cersei has the worst death possible, and he'd be living trying to forget that.  


And just look at how Sansa stares at Jaime when she talks about wishing to be there when Cersei is executed: it's spite, hatred. No matter what Jaime does, he knows that's what he'll get for his life. He'd have nothing but regrets and pain for having failed his sister, with no honor left or chance to regain it.  


So, that night he attempts to drown the pain of what he's feeling. He tries pushing back those feelings, and has a last night with Brienne to see if afterwords he's sure of himself. After all, a night with Cersei had made him sure he wanted to remain in Kingslanding as a Kingsguard for life, and be with her forever. And what does he feel afterword?  


Regret.  


You can see on his face he regrets everything he's done, and that he's even contemplating leaving Cersei to die. So he runs off in the night. Whether he loved Brienne or not is up for debate, but overall he definitely had more love for Cersei. Because he runs off to be with her, the woman he loves, in the possible last days of his life.

&amp;#x200B;

Then why does Jaime say he doesn't care about the innocents to Tyrion? Because he's pissed off at Tyrion.  


Jaime left Cersei to fight the army of the dead, and does so. But Tyrion left and joined the person who's main goal in life is to bring down Cersei and execute her. In that moment, Dany is a day at most from killing Cersei, and Tyrion is absolutely not caring about the fact Cersei may die. Instead he's citing Jaime's love, and Jaime's wish to protect the innocents. 

&amp;#x200B;

This mirrors a scene from the books, where Tyrion gets mad at Jaime when he finds out that his first wife wasn't a prostitute, and that Tywin had forced him to lie to Tyrion. In that scene, Tyrion falsely claims that he in fact did kill Joffrey and didn't regret it at all, even though for all purposes Tyrion loved Joffrey as a nephew. He wanted to guide Joffrey to be the best king he could, gave him expensive books on ruling, and always offered fair advice when he wasn't pissed about a recent event.

&amp;#x200B;

Here Jaime is mad at Tyrion for the seeming betrayal against their sister, and so he does what he feels would hurt Tyrion most: appear like a monster. Jaime knows he was everything his brother ever wanted to be, and he's trying to hurt Tyrion by acting like it was all some act or false stance. And Tyrion doesn't fall for it. He pulls on the one cord he knows will always get Jaime's heart: telling him to go live a life with Cersei where they'll be happy together.  


And Jaime goes off to be with Cersei again, determined to be with the woman he loves the rest of their lives. When they're trapped, he doesn't get angry, cry out in anguish, cry, anything. He holds her close, and spends his last moments comforting her and making sure that she dies knowing he was there for her, and she will not be alone in life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Jaime loved Cersei, and makes sure she knows it. Because no matter what he did in life, how he acted, how he was, it all traced back to her.  I can see why many feel that Jaime going back to Cersei is a betrayal of his character, but in my honest opinion it is the consequence of his character.",35,6,False,spoiler,,,,,

Sure, maybe the ending (and appointed king) was not what most people wanted but what a journey we all just went on. Millions of us, all gathered weekly for eight long years to pay respects to a well written story line, with characters we fell in love with and the artistry that brought it all together. I mean, how cool is that?

The background actors, the builders, the stunt people, the makeup artists, the costume designers, the snow artists, the people that literally organized shelter and living spaces for everyone. I obviously cant name everyone in a single post but you get the idea. 

Complaining because the most obvious choice of king didnt happen should not completely discount all the work that went into this show. Also, I love a good twist. It makes things more appealing in my opinion. I for one really enjoyed the journey all the way.

Hello! My name is Mako, and Im a literate/semi-literate/advanced literate roleplayer. Ive been roleplaying for over 4 years and Im currently looking for an MxM Game of Thrones roleplay. We can do OCxOC or CanonxOC, but I will be playing an OC for that option. I am 18+.



When it comes to roleplay:  I can do all types of literacy. One-liners are a strict no, novella is possible but rare due to the longer response times and effort it takes to write them.  Short and long term roleplays are accepted.  Mature themes are a must, things like heavy gore can be cut off though.  Im very versatile, I will allow anything in roleplay, especially if its realistic to the Game of Thrones universe.



What's required to be a rp partner?: - At least semi-literate to literate. - Willing to collaborate on plots/ideas. - Do not spam me if I stop doing rapid replies. - LGBTQ+ characters must be okay with you; I will be roleplaying a transgender ftm character for my main. - You're okay with me roleplaying as my transgender ftm OC.

Recently I was rewatching some scenes from earlier seasons, and I was struck by how it just feels like a totally different show. The writing, the characters, the storyline, everything just had a totally different tone to it early on. If you put an episode from season 3 side by side with an episode from season 8, theres basically no connection whatsoever between them in terms of either plot or character behavior.

None of the characters in season 8 feel like the characters weve been following, and none of the events occurring feel like they actually should have happened. Theres not enough dialogue, and when there is its terrible. Characters never talk to each other about anything thats happened, even insanely huge things like Arya killing the Night King. The whole season plays out like poorly written fan fiction, and thats kind of how I see it.

Season 8 is fan fiction, its just that the fans are D&amp;D. But this isnt the same show that we were watching before, and these arent the same characters, and this story isnt connected, because the show ended a season or two ago and a couple of inept showrunners decided to finish it themselves. 

So Ill have no problem rewatching Game of Thrones, because this season is so far removed from what the actual show was that its essentially nothing more than big budget fan fiction.",26,10,False,spoiler,,,,,

But after the sack of Highgarden and the death of Olenna in 7x03 did the large Tyrell army suddenly just disappear?

From my understanding, the reason the Tyrells lost Highgarden so quickly (or even at all) was because they were not prepared and their larger army was off somewhere else, with only a relatively small garrison left to defend the castle.

I know that the 100k army Renly mentioned was from ALL of the reach, but the purely Tyrell Fleet &amp; Army that we see when Olenna gives her support to Daenerys was, although nowhere near 100k strong, still very big so where did it go?

Did they just fall in line with Randall and stuff (even though the offending chunk of the lannister army got roasted in 7x04)? I would have assumed they'd fought to get revenge on Cersei or atleast take highgarden back (or maybe continued on with Dany)? But I guess not.

Also kinda unrelated but did it surprise anyone that the lords of the reach would Oppose the Tyrells so easily? I mean yes she rebelled against the queen but Cersei killed her whole family, surely the Tyrells liege lords would seek vengeance for that, kinda like the northerners when the starks rebelled after ned got beheaded?

This is going to be embarrassing if we know what happened to them and i just forgot but LMAO i don't recall anything so what do you guys think",10,6,False,spoiler,,,,,

All Im giving you is a slightly different interpretation of what I think the character was meant to represent, and what conclusion you walk away with is up to you. Whether you were satisfied (like me) or enraged at how the Night King came and went, were probably equally justified to believe what we believe. And as for me...

# I believe the Night King is a Lovecraftian monster

&amp;#x200B;

You might not be familiar with good ol Howard Phillips Lovecraft, but youve probably at least heard of his most famous creation - **Cthulhu**. Anyway, HP Lovecraft is considered by many to be the father of modern science fiction, fantasy and horror, and youd be hard-pressed to find modern horror writers that dont hold this scrawny, weird 20th century New England gentleman in high regard. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/pckmkfo115231.jpg

&amp;#x200B;

George RR Martin is himself a huge Lovecraft fan; A Song of Ice and Fire abounds in nods and references to his works, and its clear that the show runners are fans as well.  Especially if youre into horror, chances are that Lovecrafts shadow looms ominously over your favorite books, movies or games. **So what made this guy so special?**  


Well, before his time, horror in particular was relegated mostly to gothic cliches ranging from vampires to ghosts and werewolves, and followed the romantic formula of the good guys who finally defeat the monster or vanquish the evil, maybe saving a damsel in distress in the process, the end. 

What Lovecraft did to shake things up and establish a new way of writing horror fiction was to de-emphasize the human element, **focus on world-building and creating an entire eldritch mythology** complete with a pantheon of frightful gods, and **almost completely obliterate happy endings** (sound familiar?).

Heres a quote from George himself:

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/br1q9p6515231.jpg

&amp;#x200B;

Well come back to how Lovecrafts fingerprints are all over ASOIAF, but for now whats most relevant to the Night King is the fact that Lovecrafts monsters are **truly alien**. And when I say alien, I dont mean the short gray bug-eyed type; I mean alien in the sense that they are beings that we cannot fathom. Their intellect, their interests, **their entire essence is beyond human comprehension,** to the point that most of the times we humans dont even register on their radars. Why do that? Well, it all comes down to this:

# The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown. - H.P. Lovecraft

&amp;#x200B;

Take this quote and apply it mentally to the books, movies, games etc. that scared you most; youll probably find that a lot of them obey this rule: the less we know about a threat, the more it frightens us. Thats probably Lovecrafts most important effect on modern horror: what you dont know or see, what is just hinted at and glimpsed, is scarier.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, this is easier to pull off in some mediums than in others. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Books:** Lovecraft used it to great effect by being vague with the descriptions of his abominations, and leaving most to the readers imagination. Thats a smart way to go about it, since the more imaginative the mind reading his works is, the more effective the writing becomes.
* **Movies:**  It gets a bit harder to pull off in this medium, but the limited length helps - notice that a horror movie is at its most tense before, not after we can finally see the monster in its entirety. 
* **Long-form TV:**  Id argue that this is a concept thats the hardest to pull off in long-form TV, especially in shows like Game of Thrones where character presence is so important, and not showing one of your main villains can get really frustrating, really fast (remember Losts smoke monster, and the underwhelming payoff?). I dont think they could have pulled off *not* showing the Night King in order to retain his Lovecraftian aura of mystery. So they had to change register.

&amp;#x200B;

**Thats why the Night King doesnt speak.**

**Thats why we know so little of the Night Kings past.**

**Thats why we know virtually nothing about his motivations.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/alm8j02a15231.jpg

&amp;#x200B;

If you're curious to find out more about Lovecraft, here's a great documentary, aptly entitled exactly that: [**Fear of the Unknown.**](https://youtu.be/jg9VCf5einY)

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, back to the Night King - what is so effective about this character is that he just ***is***, and he just implacably marches on the humans, destroying everything in sight. Imagine an alien race we know nothing about that descends on Earth one day and just starts eradicating us - no mercy, no communication, no way to reason with them. Terrifying thought, right? 

&amp;#x200B;

**Thats what the big blue bad represents - our fear of the unknown**. It permeates so efficiently because it resonates with our most ancestral fears. Evolution built this susceptibility to fear of the unknown into us, and it helped us stay safe from things lurking around in the dark since back in prehistoric times. Appealing to your most basic, instinctual fears is never not efficient, because, for ages, **the unknowns been a heartless bitch.** 

Lovecraftian abominations are mostly beyond mere existence; they are alternatively presented as incredibly powerful extraterrestrials or literal gods (which begs the question whether the two are all that different after all). Either way, **the Night King is beyond human**, we cant expect to understand his motivation, and the lives of the people of Westeros mean absolutely nothing to him. 

The crazed, unintelligent evil cultist as a trope also permeated pop culture mostly through HPLs writings; his evil gods are always called upon by idiotic followers that are unwavering in their devotion, even though their reward is usually either death or insanity. What a nice parallel to the hordes of brainless undead zombies unquestioningly following the Night King and his generals!

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, and **the Night King is also death personified.** This isnt really a controversial opinion, since they all but say it outright in the show. The books are called A Song of Ice and Fire - its a pretty obvious allegory, with fire representing warmth and life, and ice - the coldness and inevitability of death. 

So, Lovecraftian monster and death itself. There are a couple of problems with that, though: heroes almost never defeat the monsters in Lovecrafts works - at most, they temporarily banish them, or just delay the inevitable; as for death Well, death is death. But this is where the fun part comes in.

# Death may die

&amp;#x200B;

The Big Bad Blues shocking demise makes a lot of sense if you look at it through the lens of GRRMs ambivalent takes on the writers he himself looks up to - like Tolkien and, of course, Lovecraft.  HPLs influence is a bit more subtle and more tongue-in-cheek. Lets take a look at how it manifests.

Heres something the Greyjoys love to shout when making fiery speeches right before getting knocked the fuck out: 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing gif sq2kadfe15231...*

&amp;#x200B;

...the words of the Drowned God.

And heres a quote from The Call of Cthulhu:

# That is not dead which can eternal lie. 

#  And with strange aeons even death may die.

&amp;#x200B;

Its not hard to see that one is a clear paraphrase of the other. Whats funny here is that, even though the quotes seem to contradict each other, GRMM *heavily* nods at the Drowned God being in fact **Cthulhu** (or **Dagon**, some say). What do we know about Cthulhu? Not much, but definitely this:

# In his house at Rlyeh Dead Cthulhu waits dreaming.  

&amp;#x200B;

So hes dead, but not really. Anyway, Lovecraftian lore is chock full of instances of mortals misinterpreting the intentions of the gods, and suffering for it (and boy, did the Grejoys suffer). 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, back to the even death may die quote - there are a couple of ways you can interpret Lovecrafts words. His intended meaning is along the lines of certain creatures can lie in wait for so friggin long that even Death eventually says whelp, fuck it, Im out of here, hence eternal life (or un-death, something like that). 

But what the writers love to do in Game of Thrones is take tropes that are representative of  authors they genuinely admire, like Tolkien and Lovecraft, and only partially use them as they are, **twisting them into new meanings that sometimes even parody the original intent.** And in this case, its a completely reversed interpretation of the phrase **even death may die. They interpret it literally. The Night King is Death. Death may die; ergo, the Night King may die.** And die he did.

&amp;#x200B;

# Thats GRRM saying Howard, I love you and your cosmic abominations and Ill wear your influence on my sleeve, but this is my house - no ones safe here, buddy.

&amp;#x200B;

This partial, cheeky subversion of classic fantasy and horror tropes also applies to the not-quite-alien origin of the Night King. Frankly, I was initially a little disappointed that they showed us how he was created - it took his aura of mystery down a few pegs for me; but the moment Bluey met his swift end has sort of helped me understand how the character came full circle, and revealed that in GoT / ASOIAF even godlike Lovecraftian abominations have some kind of flaw that eventually spells their doom. 

In this case, **the Night Kings Achilles heel was his human origin**. And if you have even just a little human in you, and youre a Game of Thrones character chances are you wont make it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/p76oqv9n15231.jpg

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of people were up in arms about the fact that it was Arya, not Jon, to strike down good ol blue eyes. Im sure that had Jon been the one it would have resulted in  millions of screams of Thats what Im Tolkien about!...However, I wouldve definitely grrmbled.

Game of Thrones is not about epic Boris Vallejo-style confrontations between the manly antagonist and the pasty villain. I sort of understand that people were expecting that because of the glances Jon and the Night King had been exchanging, but that was never going to happen. I think the show was right to give it to Arya. Why is that?

Because, again, going back to the two quotes (**What is dead may never die!** and **even death may die**), if we consider the fact that Arya is a servant of the Many-Faced God (**There is only one god, and his name is Death!)**, and the Night King is Death personified 

Oh god. Look, I know it got really convoluted, but it boils down to this: 

# Who else to kill Death but Death itself?

&amp;#x200B;

This isnt Tolkien, where the envoy of the Red God smites darkness and then rules the land for generations to come; its **one aspect of Death killing another**.  Even Death may die. Its goddamned awesome and hilarious at the same time.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I realize this entire analysis only makes sense if youre into Lovecraft, and **you definitely** **shouldnt need to know or care about these things in order to enjoy the show**. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think its pretty obvious that Im a big fan (Im even [making a game inspired by his works](https://store.steampowered.com/app/914020/Gibbous___A_Cthulhu_Adventure/)), and of course you dont have to be one yourself to enjoy or understand Game of Thrones.  However, good ol Howie Lovecraft got to be so influential *precisely* because he was the first to truly tap into that fear of the unknown I was mentioning above, and **that stuff works** regardless of whether youre aware of the concept or not **because its ingrained in all of us**. Thats why the Night King is terrifying, and thats why that smirk he gave to Daenerys was the most communication we ever got out of him, the smug bastard. 

# Alright, but why do it?

&amp;#x200B;

Im sure a lot of people were left dumbfounded by the fact that the biggest bad of them all, the threat that all human forces should have banded together against, got swiftly removed from the equation half-way into the season. But look back at the show overall: **where does evil really come from in Westeros?**

I could go into a whole diatribe, but [**Martin straight up tells it in this conversation with Stephen King**](https://youtu.be/v_PBqSPNTfg). The whole thing is totally worth watching, but to sum up: theyre discussing Lovecraft, and how in his work **evil is externalized** \- its always something alien, something outside of us that is wreaking havoc; Cthulhu and his ilk are defined precisely by the fact that they are anything but human, whereas Martin loves to create universes where morality is grey, and

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing gif sfaian4s15231...*

&amp;#x200B;

Those words right there - thats what this show has been all about, and thats why it makes sense that the big bad externalized evil - the Night King - was not so much a fakeout, but a way of reinforcing the idea that **the evil that originates in humans can be just as scary, if not scarier than the unknown and alien.**  Keeping the Night King as the big bad wouldnt have ruined the show, for sure, but it would have Tolkienized it too much, in detriment of the constant setup of **humans are the real evil**.   
I wont go too much into episode five, but that was just more confirmation that this is the idea that the show is driving home, and Emilia Clarkes amazing performance in that turning point moment when she decides to burn the whole thing to the ground was a stunning visual representation of exactly that - **evil decisively winning the battle** within her heart. 

Ultimately, its a little sad that the Night King is pretty much a glorified plot device. He is basically there to reinforce the idea that humans are the real origin of true evil , but hes still a superbly executed (and cool as hell, pardon the pun) nod to Lovecraft, and a pretty damn expressive and memorable character for a dude who just marches around, throws a javelin, rides a dragon, smirks, and dies. 

&amp;#x200B;

**And all this for GRRM and the showrunners  to remind us what a bunch of assholes the human race really is**. Not that we didnt know it, but Game of Thrones said it in a particularly beautiful, gory, and bittersweet way, and I hope many more shows take notice. 

&amp;#x200B;

Campy - yeah but still entertaining and it was interesting to see how it went. 

I will not defend the parts that are undefendable (things being rushed, the council meeting electing the King and the lack of any relevant White Walker information) but overall I see why people are saying it gets harshly criticized for things the other seasons had as well.

So:

1. Cutting away from interesting things: This happened in older seasons as well. Robb Stark fights entirely of screen his battles and the black fish dies of screen. Just as two examples. We also never find out what Joffrey felt when he was sent to bed without supper by Tywin. ;) 
2. Illogical fight scenes: Well for most of the earlier seasons we didnt get a lot of battles and honestly GoT did not have a single ""realistic"" battle. As an example Lady Stark and Tyrion getting ambushed. All battles and fights were interesting but none realistic. Maybe the problem of later episodes was the budget which enabled battles to go longer and show more.
3. Plots going nowhere: This is GOT, 50% of all plots ended nowhere or abruptly. This was also one of the interesting things of the series. Sure, the WW plot was a bit too important for it to abruptly end and some plots just fizzled out instead of being dramatically ended (red wedding...) but still.
4. Plots ending unsatisfying: Yeah I hated mr. snow's ending as well but then again so did I hate Stannis ending, ser barristans ending and Roose Boltons ending. A lot of plots ended strangely and felt rushed.
5. Plot man power: Everyone always just as strong as needed. This was really a tough thing in season 7 and 8 but this also happened before. Everyone always had exactly the man power they needed for the plot. How did the Lannisters always recover from their many setbacks and losses? How did Stannis manage to hire new guys after Blackwater, how did Roose and then Ramsay Bolton suddenly have enough men to rival even the strongest armies in Westeros, how did the Freys ever acquire any kind of big army? And the wildlings must have all been killed three times per person.

This is just a interesting thought I had

P.s. please forgive my grammar and spelling mistakes 

So my theory starts in the cave in season 5. While bran is warging through history he ends up with the army of the dead and sees the night king. He ends up getting touched and is given his mark, which bran says he can now track him with it. We also learn from the three eyed raven that the night king and the whites can now enter the cave and attack them. I believe this ""mark"" was actually the NKs attempt to transform bran into a white. But due to brans strong humanmanty and his love for his family and friends cromprimesed the transformation due to the fact that it was done through the tree and not face to face. I believe this is so because we can see the OG three eyed raven cares and feels for people much the contrast of bran in latter seasons. We can see this almost immediately as he willing corrupts hodor leaving him to die as he no longer cares for people as the white part of him hates humans or how he just dismisses Mira with out really thanking her. 

The second part of this theory we can see in seasons 8 as bran just sits around winter not telling anyone anything or doing anything this is due to the war between the human and white part of him fight to either help and save everyone or let them all die. He choses to be put in the gods wood to wait for the NK becaue it will either lead to his death or him getting to live on. 

Now I know what your thinking ""why would the NK want kill him if hes half white?"". This I believe is because the NK's original plan to get beyond the wall was to use a warg but there were no wargs north of the wall beside the wildlings and they would fight to much and die before he could change them. Also none crasters sons had the ability so he was going to attack the TER (three eyed raven) and change him but bran appeared in his vision. So he attempted to change him but his powers weakened due to OG TER was still in the tree and they were not face to face. So at the battle of winterfell the NK had to kill bran he was the the only thing that mattered as he wanted to finish the transformation but saw that the human side of bran was to powerful so he decided kill him. With bran dead and the TER gone he could easily kill the world. 

With the night king dead and bran the only remaining white left in the world we see a shift in brna. This can explain why he would shift from his stance on ""I no longer want anything"" to ""Why do you think I came all this way"". This comes from the white part of him won the battle and bran no longer exist in spirit seeing the NK dead and all the magic of the whites and TER transferred to him he is an unstoppable force. As the most powerful enitiy in the world bran can no use his powers more subtly, combining the telepanty of the NK and his warging. With brans strong memories and knowledge of the seven kingdoms thanks to master luin he does a small warg into all the major players of war right up to this point gathering the information of everything even going to cersi and uron in kings landing. With information he begins to plant seeds of doubt in jon tryion and verays along with seeds of mistrust in dany. This leads to the march down to kings landing giving no one anytime to rest up or recuperate leading to all off them having their guards down and allowing bran influence them. Down in KL (kings landing) bran tells cersi to send uron to dragon stone as he knows dany is on her way there along putting the peasants in the red keep as Dany plans to burn it all. 

At dragon stone dany arrives with her fleet and is attacked by euron. We later in episode 5 that the iron men chat shoot for shit but dragon stone they nail regal like 14 times. This is because bran full on warged into the iron and used his prior knowledge of archery to kill the dragon and to grab missandei (since she was one of like 100 people on the ships so there is no way euron would know to grab her). This then would cause the future events to play as they did leading to sacking of KL by the north men. With the seeds of doubt in jon and anger in dany to events played out exactly as bran knew they would. Finally before the meeting while tryion was in a cell he began to drop small messages into his mind about bran and his ""story"" about how hes the best choice. And at the council bran warged in everybody if not fully than just enough to convince yara and the dornish. Arya and Sansa were the only ones not influenced But due to the magic of both the KN and TER bran will most likely out live everyone if not forever. So in the end the night king won just not the original.",4,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

997,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2019-6-3,2019,6,3,23,bwb5cz,self.gameofthrones,[Spoilers] Interesting thought about Game of Thrones Season 8,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bwb5cz/spoilers_interesting_thought_about_game_of/,imamuffin18,1559571415,"My friend and I recently finished binge watching the final season of GoT. The season left us with asking many questions. One of them was ""Why did Drogon melt the Iron Throne?"" Granted, the scene was super badass and I enjoyed the symbolism showing how insignificant human power and rule is compared to the might of just a single dragon.
So, why did Drogon melt the throne? Why didn't he kill Jon Snow instead (or whatever his real name is)?

Throughout the show's history in the seasons it is clear that Daenerys believes that taking the throne was her destiny and that she alone was capable of making the world a better place. She knew she could only do this with the might of her dragons so in the earlier seasons when they were small or still unborn, in a sense, she cared more about them rather than her taking the throne.
In a certain perspective, this is also a mirror of Cersei Lannister. She starts the show doing things to preserve her family and family name. Joffery dies (which we all loved), Marcella dies, and Tommen dies. As a result she took the throne. Maybe she always wanted the throne but in the earlier seasons she wanted her children to live and thrive. This wanted deteriorated more and more after the death of child. By the time Tommen died, all she wanted was the throne so she could take revenge on the rest of the world.
Daenerys was the same way when she invaded Westeros. Then Visereon got killed by the night king and she died a little inside. The Rhegal died and she died a little more, just like Cersei.
Both characters, Cersei and Daenerys, throughout the show focus on their children, and their goals shift and get more focused on either taking the Iron Throne or holding it rather than preserving themselves or their family.
In a sense, Daenerys became her father, someone she did not want to become in the earlier seasons. King's Landing had surrendered, the bells were rung and the siege could've ended. But instead, she chose to 'Burn them all.' This makes John's story mirror Jaime Lannister's story as the Kingslayer. Both were honorable men who killed their ruler because they thought it was the right thing to do. The only difference is that Jaime killed the king before he could kill everyone and Jon killed the Queen after she already burned everyone in King's Landing.
As the audience who sees everything like the Three Eyed Raven, we can see this but other characters may not because they're limited to just their own perspective.
My friend and I came up with the theory that both Jon Snow and Drogon both may have realized this intention shift in Daenerys. He killed Daenerys not because he wanted Tyrion Lannister to live but rather her mind was tainted and corrupted by the power of the Iron Throne. It was that corruption and tainted power that made Daenerys kill everyone in King's Landing. Not for the sake of revenge, but for the sake of power. Daenerys herself even said something along the lines of ""She [Cersei] used their innocence against me as a shield. So I took that away."" She planned on liberating the people of Westeros from ""the wheel."" But if she killed everyone, both the guilty and the innocent, then how many other people would she kill with Drogon and her armies?

That was why Drogon melted the throne. Yes John Snow may have actually been the one to kill Daenerys but it was the throne that tainted her mind. That could possibly imply that Drogon knew that she needed to die eventually. Drogon melting the throne not only serves as a metaphor for man's insignificant power compared to or without dragons, but also to put an end to a monarchy and absolute power. John Snow knew that he could not take the throne safely from her and he cannot make her, not want the throne. To save everyone else in Westeros he had to kill her, because she was corrupt with the throne's power. Drogon, while angry that John killed her, realized this too and was more angry at the throne hense why he melted the ultimate symbol of power into a pile of melted slag.

Unfortunately, the council later in the episode chose a mini-democracy and elected to give absolute power to one individual making the smelting of the throne semi-pointless, but they did end the monarchy ... for now.

What do you guys think? Is that why Drogon melted the throne or is there some other reason?",6,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

Long ago, before he had become a man, his people fought against stormwrecked savages from a nearby island, hoping to steal supplies they had so carelessly lost to the Grandfather of Winds. The fools came with blugeons and spears, resting their narrow vessels on the shore opposite the one his people had built their homes, in an attempt to strike with surprise under the cover of darkness. 

But unlike them, Hactal's people were not foolish. 

They had set watchers amongst the brush and trees, for after the clouds stir violently in the sky and the waves crash hard on the shore do canoeing marauders arrive on one's shores, refilling their lost stocks of supplies from the bounty of other's. A lesson they had learned well from the Brother of War.

In short order his people defeated them and gathered the bandits that remained breathing, positioning them on the southwest shore, facing the isle they had began their doomed journey from. Once their feet and hands had been bound tightly to a post, the women of Hactal's tribe brought out large dried leaves with sticks and placed them around the panicked party. Then the men Hactal grew to admire forced opened the mouths of the interlopers with calloused hands and wooden planks, feeding them a viscous purple-black liquid that heightened one's sense of touch and caused them see spirits of sea and tree who taunted their helplessness. When the men's heads shook from side to side, and up to down, and back again, and toward again, and their eyes turned deep, his people lit the fires and let the others on their far shores hear the warning.

This night was the same. Two pale things had come to their shores and two pale things now burned upon them.

At times like these Hactal would take a deep sigh relief knowing that he had made his people safe, but he could not. Instead the three friends who turned to greet his glare as he emerged from the dark of the foliage found themselves grasping at their throats and bleeding quietly in the sand.

They died thinking themselves cursed as Hactal removed his face from his head, revealing what must have been the Mother of Death and from whose mouth spit words of venom they did not understand;

I already made him a Hose Sigil, but I am having a lot of trouble finding a place that will put it on a banner. Any time I search for something like this, it takes me to websites for creating your own advertisement banners (something that a small business would put outside their shop). I can't find any place that will make a GoT style banner for me, and I definitely do not have the skills to make one myself.

Does anyone know a company or service that could do this for me? I would also like to get some flags made, if possible. But the Banner is a higher priority right now.

&amp;#x200B;

It has always struck me that Faceless Man isn't a job you just quit to go freelance. Throughout the later seasons, especially after the Freys, I was expecting somebody from the House of Black and White to come after her. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think the white horse was symbolic of a major transition in her personality: she rode into King's Landing on a black horse bent on revenge and possibly self-destruction, She leaves on a white horse horrified by the carnage. Perhaps she does not intend to kill anymore. (Can't help thinking if she was still willing to kill Grey Worm would've been dead soon after John's imprisonment.)  


So perhaps the House of Black &amp; White ordered her to return or face having their assassins after her forever. She is through killing. But where could she ever go to escape their reach? West of Westoros.",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Taking into account the already set style of narration in season 8 ... And taking into account the acting changes due to some changes in situations and scenes ...

Minor changes in series 4 and 5:

Conversation of Varys and Tyrion, where Varys proves that John is the best king, took place. But Varis is still not executed. When Tyrion speaks with Deineris, he does not tell her that she was betrayed. He tells her that with Varys he knows who John Snow is.

Tyrion: Your Majesty, we know by Varis about John Snow ...

Daeneris: Yes, I know. He betrayed me.

Tyrion: No! Your Majesty, he only told his sister, and she told me.

Daeneris: Yes, he said that he did not want the crown. I asked him anyway not to tell anyone this, said what it would lead to. He told his sister anyway, she told you, and you told Varis before telling me. You all betrayed! By the way, why did Sansa tell you all this?

Tyrion: Because she trusts me, one of the few. I am your Hand, and Varis is the master of the whispers. We must know. We now need to think about attacking the Royal Harbor. Troops fully arrived.

At the beginning of the 5th series, the scene of Deanerys and John remains unchanged.

In the scene, in the throne room of the Dragonstone, where Tyrion tells the plan for an attack on Royal Harbor, Varis is not executed.

Similarly, Deineris tells Tirion about Jaime captured.

He tells both (and Varis and Tirion) that if they fail him again, this will be the last time.

All other scenes 4 and 5 of the series are similar to those shown.

   
 

6 series:

The scenes with Jaime and Cersei are similar.

With possible abbreviations, without precise details, the course of events is as follows:

John, Tyrion, Varis and Davos are walking along the ruined Royal Harbor.

Varys (to John): You still don't want the crown? Don't you think people will be better for people? Perhaps now that I have sent letters to all the Lords of Westeros with information about your origin, will you change your mind? Moreover, the queen can guess about everything.

John: What? What for? Although ... It's my fault. I told Sanz. Now everyone knows. We all betrayed her. We are all largely to blame for everything that happened.

John and Davos are leaving ...

Walking through the city, they meet Arya.

John (extremely surprised and frightened): Arya? How did you get here?

Arya: I came to kill Cersei, but your queen overtook me.

John: Go to the army over the gate, then I will find you.

They diverge.

Again show Tyrion and Varys.

Varys: We need help solving the problem.

Tyrion (looking at Varys' face): John will never agree to this and will not agree.

Varys: He does not need.

Tyrion: What are you counting on? If the queen will not, and John will choose the king, he will guess about the traitors. And then what?

Varys: With the help of my little birds I hired a faceless person to do the work. And if John guesses, I dont care. The higher the risk, the higher the reward. I will say that one did everything. I do not serve kings and queens, I serve people.

Again show John and Davos.

They meet the Gray Worm and the Immaculate, Punishing Lannisters. John is trying to stop them. He says that you need to talk to the queen.

Show Tirion, already walking alone in the city. Further, all the scenes with finding the dam, under which Jaime and Cersei are similar.

The scene with the appeal of Deaneris to the army is similar. John, Davos, Gray Worm, Tyrion, Varis come.

After the speech, Deaneris also tells Tirion that he let go of his brother, that this is a betrayal. Tyrion likewise refuses to be a hand. The queen orders his arrest and then leaves.

John: I'll go talk to Deyneris.

Davos: Now, maybe she will only accept you.

John leaves.

Varys pointedly looks into the trail of outgoing John.

The scene in which Deineris walks through the throne room and wants to touch the Iron Throne ...

Instead of John (as it was taken down) Missandea enters the throne room.

Missandea: Your Majesty, you have been with this for so long.

Deaneris: Missandea? How? You got killed!

Missandea (coming closer and taking out the knife): Yes, I am not her.

Deaneris: What does this mean? What are you doing?

Missandea (having already taken out the knife): I am nobody. God of death needs you to die. I do his will.

At this time, John, both lost and surprised, enters the throne room.

John: Missandea? How are you? ... Everyone saw your head cut off on the wall. What are you doing with a knife here?

John puts his hand on the sword's hand.

Missayedeya: I'm not her. (Starts to run to John) And I'm here to kill your queen.

John: What? ...

John has time to pull the sword. The fight begins. Everyone in the process strikes. Everything happens very quickly. Ultimately, Missandea (faceless) has time to strike in the abdomen. John falls.

Shocked, Deneris looks at everything from the Iron Throne.

Missandea (heading towards Deineris): After all, no one will be? No one will come to you now.

At that moment, Arya enters the throne room. Seeing John lying, she runs over to him.

Arya: John, John, you're badly hurt.

John: Arya, why didn't you leave? I told you to leave the gate.

Arya: I heard Tyrion and Varys talk about the murder of the queen. Varis hired the faceless and said that he was already somewhere here and could at any moment solve their question. After your queen's speech, you went to her. So I went after you.

Missandea: You will not save him, as well as yourself.

Arya quickly manages to get a needle. The fight begins. Everything happens very quickly again. Arya can hurt badly and cut the throat of Missandea.

Bloody Arya and Daineris run up to John.

John: Dany, I'm sorry. I did not want to ... We are all involved in everything that happened. You began to defend the North, lost two dragons, Jorah, Missandea. I didn't have to tell Sanz and Arieh (John looks at her). Then Tyrion and Varis betrayed you, they wanted me to be a king who I didnt want to be. We left you alone. You will always be my queen. We all did a lot, sometimes terrible. You have passed a lot, please do not forget about why you were followed, be the best ruler for the sake of ... (He speaks of his last strength and gradually calms down ...)

Show crying Deineris and Arya.

Arya: You burned the city, and John said you are his queen, that we are all to blame. He you ...

Daenerys (interrupting): Who was that? Miss Cersei killed.

Arya walks over to Missandee and takes off her mask.

Arya: It was faceless. I studied with them in Braavos. He was hired by Tyrion with Varys. Varys sent letters to all the leaders of Westeros about the origin of John. But it does not matter, they need ...

Deaneris: No! If the lords know, then they should know that too. Tyrion with Varys will get theirs.

Arya: If John didnt go to you, I wouldnt be here. And you already too.

Show Dragon's lair, all the lords who arrived.

Immaculate lead arrested Tyrion and Varys.

Also comes the Gray Worm and sits down on one of the places along with the lords.

The lords stare at each other.

Sanz: Where is the queen? We have a lot of questions? How did John die? And why are they arrested?

Gray Worm: She will be soon.

Daenerys arrives at Drogon and sits next to the Gray Worm.

Sansa: We've been waiting for you.

Deaneris: Sorry.

Sanz: Everyone cares what happened to the rightful heir.

Deineris: First Tyrion and Varis.

Sansa: It's not all ...

Daeneris (interrupting): Tyrion, would you like to say something? Or maybe you, Varis? (Does not receive a response). Yes! I burned the city. Cersei wanted to take advantage of my weakness, blocking her shield. I stopped the war with her and lost the dragons, Jorahs best friend, defending the North (looking at Sansu). I lost the Missandea.

Tyrion: Queen, this is no reason to burn the city!

Deinris: And I'm no longer going to lose anyone from my people! She could also blow up the whole city and Missandea said so. Now, because of your betrayal and conspiracy, I lost John, he was killed by the one you sent to kill me.

Sansa: (Looking at Deineris). Why should we believe you? Maybe you ordered to kill him, as a more legitimate heir?

Arya (for a while thinks about what to do and what to say): At first I didnt want to talk, but this is true. He died defending her like a queen. I heard the conversation of Tyrion and Varys. I was there when the faceless killed John. He said that everyone did different things, sometimes terrible, that she passed a lot, lost almost all of them, defended the North, that she didnt have to tell anyone about herself that we were also to blame for what happened, as well as those who had betrayed Varis with Tyrion. He asked her to be the best queen.

Sanz looks at Arya, changes her expression.

Varys: It's me! I told you that I did not serve kings and queens.

Tyrion: Varis, don't ...

Deneris: It doesn't matter anymore ... Varys, what did I promise you if you betray me?

Varys: Burn alive.

Deaneris: No one will object? Sansa?

Sanz: No (looking at Varys' face).

Tyrion: Your Majesty, although I am no longer your right hand, but ...

Deinris: First Varis!

With his gaze, Deaneris orders the immaculate lead Varis to the dragon, gets up and turns in his direction.

Deaneris: Varys, I sentence you to death. Drakaris.

Daenerys (sits back): Now you, Tirion. You always wanted me to chain my enemies and traitors. For you, I will make an exception. Take him away (ordering impeccable).

Show how they lead away Tirion. There is a quiet pause between everyone.

Arya: Everyone here because they knew who John was. He will not return. He died defending Queen Deineris. Perhaps she should be the one she was to him for us? If she is, of course, the one John was talking about. And if everyone present does not mind.

Daneris: What is in my power.

All the lords take turns: Don't mind, yes, I'm for, etc.

Yara: Ironborn have long sworn allegiance to Queen Deineris.

Sansa (silent for a while): It will be so.

They show a room (in which, in the first version, Tyrion holds a small council meeting at the end). It contains Deineris and the Gray Worm.

Deineris: Collect people and ships, send to Meerin. Bring Daario. I will need it.

Gray Worm: Yes, Queen.

Show Sansu and Arya walking down the street.

Arya: Now you are the keeper of the North. As a child, you always wanted to be a queen.

Sanz: What will happen to you now?

Arya: I will not return to the North. Sail to the West. I myself always wanted to know what was there. Moreover, the crown needs to know what is beyond the known borders of the maps.

Show the port of Royal Harbor. There are many ships in it. Some of the flawless ones are going to sail East for the Daario. Arya with part of the northerners is going to sail to the West.

They show Deaneris looking from the not destroyed part of the Red Castle at the floating ships.",2,1,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a bullet point version of how things go down from there:

&amp;#x200B;

* Bran *(North of the Wall)* The season begins with Bran and Meera still trying to elude the AotD with the Wall in sight. It's reiterated that the NK killed the TER because Bran's mark broke the protective magic.  
* Arya *(in the Riverlands)* kills the Freys (same as in the show).  
* Olenna *(in Highgarden)* mobilizes the Tyrell &amp; Tarly armies before Dany's arrival.  
* Littlefinger *(in Winterfell)* finds out about the Frey's demise, and ever ambitious, reaches out to Cersei, who's desperate for allies. As a token of good faith, Littlefinger tells Cersei that Olenna killed Joffrey. Cersei gives LF a task. LF tells Olenna that the Lannisters will be in Storm's End to meet Dany's army. LF also tells Olenna that Olivyr was one of Vary's spies. (Remember that Olenna was at the trial where Olivyr testified against Loras and Margarey.)  
* Olenna *(in Highgarden)*, acting on LF's intel,  sends her armies to Storm's End and also tells Randall Tarly that Varys is a spy for Cersei.   
* Cersei *(in KL)*, sends Jamie and the Lannister army to Highgarden instead of Storm's End (the show did the same thing as a nod to Jamie's capture at Whispering Wood.)  The Tarlys defeat a decoy army, while Highgarden is looted and Olenna arrested.  
* Bran *(North of the Wall)* has a vision to learn more about the protective magic. He learns that the Wall uses the same protective magic and that's why the NK can't pass it. While Bran has this vision, Meera and him are attacked by Wights. Just when it looks like they are doomed, Tormund and co. rescue them. Bran awakens from his vision, at Castle Black. Since Bran passed the unknowingly pass through The Wall, it's no longer protected by magic.  
* Dany &amp; co. arrive at Dragonstone. She is greeted by Melisandre who offers her services and council. Melisandre tells her about the great war to come. Randal Tarly then arrives with word of the battle and that Olenna is now a hostage in KL. Tarly accuses Varys of being Cersei's spy. Dany is livid and orders Varys to be executed. Tyrion objects but Melisandre intervenes and backs up Dany. Varys is executed. Game set match, Littlefinger.  
* Arya *(Riverlands)* hears about King Snow and heads to Winterfell. She runs into the Hound and co. also making their way up North.  
* Dany sends Ellaria and the Sand Snakes to Dorne to mobilize the Dornish army. Like in the show, they are intercepted by Euron, and are taken to KL as prisoners.  
* Bran *(Castle Black*) sends word to Jon &amp; Sansa in WF, that the NK is on his way and that the Wall is no longer protected. They mobilize forces to protect the Wall.  
* Cersei *(KL)* tells the Reach and Dorne to stand down or Olenna and Ellaria and co. will be executed.   
* Dany *(Dragonstone)* is rattled as she's now lost the Iron Island fleet, Olenna, Yara, and Ellaria. Now she's on the brink of losing Highgarden and Dorne because of Cersei's offer. Debate ensues on what Dany should do.  
* Cersei's offer was simply to buy time. She kills Olenna and Ellaria anyway, using the same poisons used to kill her children. She then evacuates to Braavos, escorted by some of the Ironborn, with Jamie, the Mountain and the Tyrell gold. Qyburn is tasked with the defense of the city. Before she leaves, she sends Bronn to go find and kill Littlefinger (regardless of his help, he's still a traitor for helping Sansa) and she sends Euron and the rest of the Ironborn to take back the Riverlands.  
* *(Oldtown)* Sam cures Jorah. The Citadel ignores Bran's warning, Sam then heads to Winterfell but first sends word to Jon about Dragonstone. Jorah sets out to unite with Dany.  
* **The Sacking of KL**. After intense debate, Dany ignores Tyrion once again and decides to listen to Melisandre (who's beginning to gain more and more influence on Dany). She decides to ignore the offer and burns the Red Keep to the ground. Qyburn surrenders the city, tells her that Cersei is dead and that KL is now hers. Dany sits on the Iron Throne. She sends the Unsullied to Casterly Rock and sends the Dothraki to retake Highgarden. Randal Tarly is enraged. First Dany kills Olenna (not true) and then she's sending the Dothraki savages to take back Highgarden. His insolence is met with dragonfire after Dany once again ignores Tyrion and listens to Melisandre.   
* **The Battle of the Wall**. This battle will be a larger scale battle than Season 4's battle between the NW and Wildlings. The NK and his army attack Eastwatch. At first the NW, Wildlings and Northern reinforcements are holding strong. Than the NK sends wight birds to attack the top of the wall. Bran (from Castle Black) wargs into birds of his own and they have a warg off. The NK using dozens of undead beasts of burden and giants to break through the Wall. Tormund and Edd are killed. Jon retreats to Winterfell. Since we're not going by Season 7 pacing, it will take the NK some time to march on WF.  
* *(Winterfell)* is prepping for war. Jon Snow summons all able-bodied North men to WF. He sends women, children, and the elderly to Bear Island under House Mormont's protection. Sansa will evacuate to the Eyrie with LF  along with Brienne. Arya, the Hound and co. arrive in WF. Arya unites with Jon, he tells her that he doesn't trust LF and to keep an eye on Sansa. He tells the Hound and co. to protect Bran. He decides to head south to ask Dany for help.   
* **The Battle of Casterly Rock**. Grey Worm, Viserion and the Unsullied attack the stronghold. It's a relatively short battle as the Unsullied use Tyrion's plan and Viserion does the rest.   
* Sam arrives in Winterfell. Him and Bran discover the truth about Jon.  
* *(KL)* Tyrion is distraught. Dany's increasingly becoming mad while he thinks Cersei and Jamie are dead. As he contemplates leaving Dany he's greeted by Jorah. Jorah and him vow to right Dany.   
* Jon &amp; Davos arrive at KL. They see a city besieged in fear. Tyrion has been maligned but he's still loyal to Dany, he advises Jon to bend the knee. Jon asks Dany for aid and permission to mine Dragonstone. She asks Jon to bend the knee. Jon refuses but Melissandre convinces Dany to help regardless.  
* **Bronn impregnates the bitch**. Littlefinger feels safe in the Eyrie. He has Sansa and it looks like he'll soon have the Riverlands. Out of nowhere, he's killed by Bronn. Sansa discovers his body at the feet of Bronn and is terrified. Bronn then states that Cersei paid him a lot to kill LF, she'll probably pay more for Sansa. Arya comes out of nowhere and she stabs Bronn, leaving him to die off screen. With Sansa feeling vulnerable in the Eyrie (knowing that Cersei can even get to her there) she follows Arya to Braavos.  
* *(Last Hearth)* the NK and the AotD kill all the Umbers.  
* *(Kings Road)* Jon and Dany head North with Jorah, the Dothraki and much to Davos' chagrin, Melisandre. Davos decides to go ahead of the group taking Jon's men and the dragonstone to WF. Tyrion &amp; Missendei are tasked with running KL. On the road, Jon &amp; Dany fall in love.   
* *(The Dreadfort)* the NK and the AotD arrives.  
* *(Harranhal)* The Trident is the rendezvous point for Dany and co. to meet the Unsullied. Dany basks in the awe of Harranhal, and its destruction by dragonfire. At this point, Jon hears about Last Hearth and decides he can't wait for the Unsullied. Dany promises to meet him at WF and she sends Jorah to accompany him.  
* *(Braavos)* Cersei finds out that Dany is heading North. With her debts paid off she buys the Golden Company and their elephants, as well as ships. She tells Jamie to take the GC and retake KL while she enjoys being a guest of the Iron Bank, in exile.  
* *(Riverrun)* On the road to the Trident, the Unsullied are ambushed by the Ironborn. Viserion is taken down by a scorpion. The Unsullied regroup and rout the Ironborn.   
* *(The Trident)* Dany meets Greyworm and the Unsullied. She is downtrodden at the news of Viserion.  She takes Drogon &amp; Rhaegal and heads West.
* *(Braavos)* Arya &amp; Sansa are safe at the House &amp; of Black and White. Arya wanders through Braavos and sees Lannister troops. She follows them and sees Cersei.    
* *(KL)* KL is blindsided as the GC easily retakes KL from a provisional force. Missendei is executed but Tyrion manages to escape and hops on a ship heading east.  
* *(Pike)* Euron and the surviving forces escape back to Pike. Upon arrival they see Dany approaching. Pike is absolutely incinerated.   
* *(The Trident)* Dany returns, feeling avenged  but still distraught and angry. She then finds out about KL's sacking. Melissandre looks defeated but tells Dany the true war is to the north. Dany questions Melisandre's loyalty. Melisandre says her loyalty is to the Lord of Light. Dany sends her to meet him by dragonfire and marches south.   
* **The Battle of Winterfell** \- Bran gets Nymeria and a large wolfpack to help defend WF, and periodically wargs into Ghost and other animals, but Jon and the North are completely overwhelmed. After a valiant effort and after killing several WWs, Jon is slain by the NK. Jon dies not knowing his true parentage. Everyone at WF joins the AotD. 
* *(Braavos)* Bronn approaches Cersei and tells her Littlefinger is dead. She's smugly satisfied. She then has a knife pushed into her heart. Bronn takes off his face to reveal that its Arya. Sansa hears about the North and is determined to return. Arya and Brienne promise to escort her to Bear Island to be with her people.  
* *(Mereen)* Tyrion arrives in the city to seek safety and protection.  
* *(Kings Landing)* Dany levels the city and burns it to the ground, Jamie and the GC included. As she relishes her crown, her breath becomes visible. The AotD arrives. 
* **Epilogue:**  
* Decades later. A wight dragon is flying over an overcast sea and is suddenly shot down by an emerging ship. The ship has a sigil of a lion on a pyramid. It's the ship of Tyrion Lannister, 3rd of his name, Prince of Mereen. A red priestess stands at his side. He leads an armada larger than any ever seen. They are the newly-created, army of the Lord of the Light. The soldiers have dragonstone spears and red shields and are ready to retake Westeros for the living.

TL;DR: The Night King wins because Dany chose the throne. It took the loss of an entire continent for people to realize what's actually important. Jon dies a tragic figure, betrayed by his allies and never finding out about his parents. Arya avenges the Starks and kills Cersei. Cleganebowl doesn't happen because the Mountain is a tragic figure and his revenge will forever elude him. Tyrion stops following trying to find the right ruler and finally becomes one.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

* Dany storms the city, just as she actually did in the episode, taking out all the scorpions and the Golden Company in basically 5 minutes flat all by her damn self. (I mean, that alone should earn her a bit of street cred.)
* Next, instead of torching every freaking thing and every freaking one, she sets her eyes on the Red Keep and takes a direct flight, no layovers, to go pay a visit to Cersei. (I know that part is not an original wish/concept. Bear with me.)
* She starts burning and breaking parts of the Keep, but soon it becomes obvious she's not actually trying to *kill* Cersei at all. She's trying to make her escape impossible. She wants her **captured**. Bonus points if Cersei shits her pants.
* Since Dany is coming for Cersei, and the Keep is still getting wrecked, we could still have potentially had Clegane Bowl, so that's good.
* Dany + Drogon corner Cersei. She's captured. Dany's pretty smug about it, but we're totally fine with it.
* Flash to a short time later, Dany does her badass walk towards the top of the stairs (we still get the iconic shot of Drogon's wings behind her). Up there, she has Cersei. **IN CHAINS.** (karma's a bitch)
* Olenna is still alive. (YASSSS) And at some point during S8, Dany had removed the title of hand from Tyrion, and had given Olenna the position. 
* Olenna walks up to Dany's side, as they're about to serve up some serious revenge to CL...and that dish gonna be served **piping hot**. 
* Dany says some cool shit. She has a speech for Cersei. She has a separate speech for the ppl she just conquered (where she def points out ""look what I can do. imma make cersei an example. don't be like cersei. mkay?""), and a few separate words for her devout and loyal followers. (where she's all ""started from the bottom now we're here..."")
* Before Dany seals Cersei's fate, Olenna asks if she can have a few words. *Oh yeah.*
* Olenna says some remarkably savage things to Cersei, and tells her she killed her psychopathic golden boy. (Think about it. Since Jamie never poisoned her and they never had that conversation, this would have beent he first time we would have heard her Joffrey confession. **Minds would have been blown** in that moment, expectations subverted.)
* Cersei is simultaneously bubbling over with rage + weeping/trembling at the words Olenna is saying. 
* Just wanna mention here, that means we would have gotten a chance to see Dany and Cersei interact, you know Olenna would have had some baddass + soul crushing lines, and Lena would have been able to actually show off her incredible acting chops. *That woulda been nice.*
* Dany has everyone step aside, clear a path, and we see her and Cersei standing opposite of each other, this time with Cersei being the one sporting chains and some serious rage face.
* And you guessed it, just like Mysunday requested, we get our Dracarys moment. 
* Whole crowd was there to witness it. People have seen all they need to fear Dany.
* Olenna eventually convinces Dany to allow the North to Brexit. Arranges a deal where she'll allow it, as long as Jon Snow surrenders his claim to the throne, and vows to go north of the wall and help the Wildlings reclaim the land. (Hit the road Jack, don't come back)
* Maybe Tyrion becomes the hand of the Queen of the North, since he and Sansa have a sweet relationship.
* More stuff, I haven't thought of yet, this is just off the top of my head.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhow, I'm not a proponent of having a neat, tidy happy ending for the series, so I'd need to think about this more and how I'd like to add more conflict, but dude. I'd have loved some of this to have happened.",0,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Let's begin from the height of the show, the finale of season 6, with Dany's armada en route to Westeros.

Here's a bullet point version of how things go down from there:

* Bran *(North of the Wall)* The season begins with Bran and Meera still trying to elude the AotD with the Wall in sight. It's reiterated that the NK killed the TER because Bran's mark broke the protective magic.
* Arya *(in the Riverlands)* kills the Freys (same as in the show).
* Olenna *(in Highgarden)* mobilizes the Tyrell &amp; Tarly armies before Dany's arrival.
* Littlefinger *(in Winterfell)* finds out about the Frey's demise, and ever ambitious, reaches out to Cersei, who's desperate for allies. As a token of good faith, Littlefinger tells Cersei that Olenna killed Joffrey. Cersei gives LF a task. LF tells Olenna that the Lannisters will be in Storm's End to meet Dany's army. LF also tells Olenna that Olivyr was one of Vary's spies. (Remember that Olenna was at the trial where Olivyr testified against Loras and Margarey.)
* Olenna *(in Highgarden)*, acting on LF's intel, sends her armies to Storm's End and also tells Randall Tarly that Varys is a spy for Cersei.
* Cersei *(in KL)*, sends Jamie and the Lannister army to Highgarden instead of Storm's End (the show did the same thing as a nod to Jamie's capture at Whispering Wood.) The Tarlys defeat a decoy army, while Highgarden is looted and Olenna arrested.
* Bran *(North of the Wall)* has a vision to learn more about the protective magic. He learns that the Wall uses the same protective magic and that's why the NK can't pass it. While Bran has this vision, Meera and him are attacked by Wights. Just when it looks like they are doomed, Tormund and co. rescue them. Bran awakens from his vision, at Castle Black. Since Bran passed the unknowingly pass through The Wall, it's no longer protected by magic.
* Dany &amp; co. arrive at Dragonstone. She is greeted by Melisandre who offers her services and council. Melisandre tells her about the great war to come. Randal Tarly then arrives with word of the battle and that Olenna is now a hostage in KL. Tarly accuses Varys of being Cersei's spy. Dany is livid and orders Varys to be executed. Tyrion objects but Melisandre intervenes and backs up Dany. Varys is executed. Game set match, Littlefinger.
* Arya *(Riverlands)* hears about King Snow and heads to Winterfell. She runs into the Hound and co. also making their way up North.
* Dany sends Ellaria and the Sand Snakes to Dorne to mobilize the Dornish army. Like in the show, they are intercepted by Euron, and are taken to KL as prisoners.
* Bran *(Castle Black*) sends word to Jon &amp; Sansa in WF, that the NK is on his way and that the Wall is no longer protected. They mobilize forces to protect the Wall.
* Cersei *(KL)* tells the Reach and Dorne to stand down or Olenna and Ellaria and co. will be executed.
* Dany *(Dragonstone)* is rattled as she's now lost the Iron Island fleet, Olenna, Yara, and Ellaria. Now she's on the brink of losing Highgarden and Dorne because of Cersei's offer. Debate ensues on what Dany should do.
* Cersei's offer was simply to buy time. She kills Olenna and Ellaria anyway, using the same poisons used to kill her children. She then evacuates to Braavos, escorted by some of the Ironborn, with Jamie, the Mountain and the Tyrell gold. Qyburn is tasked with the defense of the city. Before she leaves, she sends Bronn to go find and kill Littlefinger (regardless of his help, he's still a traitor for helping Sansa) and she sends Euron and the rest of the Ironborn to take back the Riverlands.
* *(Oldtown)* Sam cures Jorah. The Citadel ignores Bran's warning, Sam then heads to Winterfell but first sends word to Jon about Dragonstone. Jorah sets out to unite with Dany.
* **The Sacking of KL**. After intense debate, Dany ignores Tyrion once again and decides to listen to Melisandre (who's beginning to gain more and more influence on Dany). She decides to ignore the offer and burns the Red Keep to the ground. Qyburn surrenders the city, tells her that Cersei is dead and that KL is now hers. Dany sits on the Iron Throne. She sends the Unsullied to Casterly Rock and sends the Dothraki to retake Highgarden. Randal Tarly is enraged. First Dany kills Olenna (not true) and then she's sending the Dothraki savages to take back Highgarden. His insolence is met with dragonfire after Dany once again ignores Tyrion and listens to Melisandre.
* **The Battle of the Wall**. This battle will be a larger scale battle than Season 4's battle between the NW and Wildlings. The NK and his army attack Eastwatch. At first the NW, Wildlings and Northern reinforcements are holding strong. Than the NK sends wight birds to attack the top of the wall. Bran (from Castle Black) wargs into birds of his own and they have a warg off. The NK using dozens of undead beasts of burden and giants to break through the Wall. Tormund and Edd are killed. Jon retreats to Winterfell. Since we're not going by Season 7 pacing, it will take the NK some time to march on WF.
* *(Winterfell)* is prepping for war. Jon Snow summons all able-bodied North men to WF. He sends women, children, and the elderly to Bear Island under House Mormont's protection. Sansa will evacuate to the Eyrie with LF along with Brienne. Arya, the Hound and co. arrive in WF. Arya unites with Jon, he tells her that he doesn't trust LF and to keep an eye on Sansa. He tells the Hound and co. to protect Bran. He decides to head south to ask Dany for help.
* **The Battle of Casterly Rock**. Grey Worm, Viserion and the Unsullied attack the stronghold. It's a relatively short battle as the Unsullied use Tyrion's plan and Viserion does the rest.
* Sam arrives in Winterfell. Him and Bran discover the truth about Jon.
* *(KL)* Tyrion is distraught. Dany's increasingly becoming mad while he thinks Cersei and Jamie are dead. As he contemplates leaving Dany he's greeted by Jorah. Jorah and him vow to right Dany.
* Jon &amp; Davos arrive at KL. They see a city besieged in fear. Tyrion has been maligned but he's still loyal to Dany, he advises Jon to bend the knee. Jon asks Dany for aid and permission to mine Dragonstone. She asks Jon to bend the knee. Jon refuses but Melissandre convinces Dany to help regardless.
* **Bronn impregnates the bitch**. Littlefinger feels safe in the Eyrie. He has Sansa and it looks like he'll soon have the Riverlands. Out of nowhere, he's killed by Bronn. Sansa discovers his body at the feet of Bronn and is terrified. Bronn then states that Cersei paid him a lot to kill LF, she'll probably pay more for Sansa. Arya comes out of nowhere and she stabs Bronn, leaving him to die off screen. With Sansa feeling vulnerable in the Eyrie (knowing that Cersei can even get to her there) she follows Arya to Braavos.
* *(Last Hearth)* the NK and the AotD kill all the Umbers.
* *(Kings Road)* Jon and Dany head North with Jorah, the Dothraki and much to Davos' chagrin, Melisandre. Davos decides to go ahead of the group taking Jon's men and the dragonstone to WF. Tyrion &amp; Missendei are tasked with running KL. On the road, Jon &amp; Dany fall in love.
* *(The Dreadfort)* the NK and the AotD arrives.

At this point, Jon hears about Last Hearth and decides he can't wait for the Unsullied. Dany promises to meet him at WF and she sends Jorah to accompany him.
* *(Braavos)* Cersei finds out that Dany is heading North. With her debts paid off she buys the Golden Company and their elephants, as well as ships. She tells Jamie to take the GC and retake KL while she enjoys being a guest of the Iron Bank, in exile.
* *(Riverrun)* On the road to the Trident, the Unsullied are ambushed by the Ironborn. Viserion is taken down by a scorpion. The Unsullied regroup and rout the Ironborn.
* *(The Trident)* Dany meets Greyworm and the Unsullied. She is downtrodden at the news of Viserion. She takes Drogon &amp; Rhaegal and heads West.
* *(Braavos)* Arya &amp; Sansa are safe at the House &amp; of Black and White. Arya wanders through Braavos and sees Lannister troops. She follows them and sees Cersei.
* *(KL)* KL is blindsided as the GC easily retakes KL from a provisional force. Missendei is executed but Tyrion manages to escape and hops on a ship heading east.
* *(Pike)* Euron and the surviving forces escape back to Pike. Upon arrival they see Dany approaching. Pike is absolutely incinerated.

* *(Mereen)* Tyrion arrives in the city to seek safety and protection.
* *(Kings Landing)* Dany levels the city and burns it to the ground, Jamie and the GC included. As she relishes her crown, her breath becomes visible. The AotD arrives.
* **Epilogue:**
* Decades later. A wight dragon is flying over an overcast sea and is suddenly shot down by an emerging ship. The ship has a sigil of a lion on a pyramid.

Now personally, I don't even think she went mad so much as she just got tired of listening to boring incompetent people and finally decided to listen to old badass Lady Tyrell and Daario and finally just decided to become the ""dragon"" ""conquerer"" she was meant to be. (Was it not foreshadowed in Season 1 that someone was the dragon and it clearly wasn't Viserys?)

Aside from battles, slavers, and her destruction of Kings Landing, how are the handful of people she killed a foreshadowing that she was going to lose it? And I don't consider liberating slaves and crucifying the Masters to be proof.

Why is it somehow completely different when the other characters in this show kill someone? I mean Ned Stark and Robert started a fake war ""that was a lie"" and killed lots of people. Ned beheads the poor kid who comes to warn them about the army of the dead, Jon hangs everyone who murdered him, Sansa feeds her ex husband to his dogs and lets Jon go into battle with Ramsay without mentioning there is backup available, Stannis burns his daughter alive, Arya just kills pretty much whoever she wants, etc etc and yet none of these characters are considered mad or really have their actions questioned. But for some reason every decision Dany makes allegedly proves she's a narcissistic, power hungry, psycho who was just waiting to snap. 

Call me crazy but it seems like she's just acting like everyone else in Westeros. But that's just my opinion.",0,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

However there is a huge problem with the books, which I think is the main reason why GRRM can't finish the series. 

There's just way too much shit going on, there are too many POV characters, and the overall plot is way too broad. If the story would have actually remained focused he could have finished the series by now. Instead he tried to do too much and now he's in way too deep. As a result the overall story is meandering, there is a ton of filler, and he has way too many loose ends that he's struggling to tie up. 

Some of the POV characters just suck too. Bran is the worst. Every time I get to a Bran chapter I just get annoyed. Even Arya chapters are a drag, and her entire story is pretty much just an unnecessary side tangent. Brienne chapters are excruciatingly dull, and pretty much all the new PoV characters in Feast for Crows are a total drag. 

At the end of the day, the story is about the War of 5 Kings, and the Wars of Ice and Fire (i.e. Jon Snow and Daenerys storylines). He should have minimized these books to really focus in the heart of the narrative. Instead he expanded the scope of the series way too extensively. 

GRRM really should have minimized his books to only the essential chapters, while focusing on the main characters who were introduced in book 1. 

Bran and Arya should not have PoV chapters, aside from maybe the first book. Honestly both of these characters should have just died in A Game of Thrones.",44,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

And Dannys like, True dat, but how? And Jon says, Well, you leave the army here and Ill lead a controlled retreat, like give up the whole North and just burn everything so there are no more dang dead rising up to meet us. It will be terrible and Ill be constantly fighting, everybodys going to bitch, itll be super heroic. 

So Dannys like, Well, yeah, but what do I do?

And Jon winks and says, Snoogums, you take Jaime and Tyrion on a Dragon and fly down to Kings landing and convince Cersei to lead the army up here and just kill her if she wont. 

Danny says, But Tyrion cant fly a dragon.

Au contraire, turns out hes a Targaryen, that bald guy said so.

Aw snap! says Danny.

Yeah, if you can get Tyron and Jaime to convince Cersei itll be a lot smoother, but if not, just fry the byatch.

Check!

So Danny and the two dragons head to Kings landing while Jon starts convincing people to burn everything, their farms, their castles, everything and retreat. There are all kinds of bad ass battles where Jon Snow fights people like the reanimated body of Ned Stark...in fact, he has to fight everyone who died in the previous episodes...because you have to make good use of a character that can raise the dead.

Meanwhile, Danny, Tyrion and Jamie get to Kings landing and give Cersei the ultimatum. At first shes like, No, then shes like, give me a day to think about it. Danny agrees because Tyrion gets all puppy dog eyed. Cut back to more awesome Jon Snow battles to emphasize how irritating it is that Cersei is making them wait.

So, the next day, Dannys lost her patience and shes just about to go all mad queen, when Cersei emerges and agrees to march north with her brothers. The whole fan base flips out, thats out of character they scream, itll be hilarious.

Okay, but get this...

So, the Lanister army marches north and meets up with Jon Snow just when hes about to die. A glorious battle ensues, Jon kills the night king, a bunch of people die in the battle, but not Cersei. Cersei lives, this is important and everyones going to be really mad because everyone wants to see Cersei dead.

After the battle, Jaime goes to Cersei and starts talking with her about how much he loves her and how theyre the only thing that matters and that he cant believe they made it through, and hes going to go on and on when all of a sudden Cersei stabs him in the stomach. And as Jaime stares her in the eyes in disbelief, Cersei pulls off her face to reveal Arya stark.

You killed Cersei? Jaime says. 

No, Arya says, shes alive, I just took her face.

See? Because Arya knew they needed the Lannister army and she knew itd be a lot easier to get them to go along if she led them as Cersei!

So then, the writers tie up all the loose ends, somebodys named king, maybe Jon kills Danny, I dont care. The scene I want is the last one of the film, and its a flashback. The flashback scene shows Arya sneaking into the palace before the final battle and cutting off Cerseis face. Then she stands there smiling as the horrendous bloody mass that used to be Cersei screams in torment as she lives on in the dungeons below Kings landing.",6,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

1168,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2019-6-4,2019,6,4,9,bwi411,self.gameofthrones,"[Spoilers] Daenerys and The Targaryen ""Madness""",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bwi411/spoilers_daenerys_and_the_targaryen_madness/,santas_little_halper,1559607361,"After finishing the series, one of the topics I have been pondering is the change in Daenerys's mental state and the concept of ""madness"" in the world of GoT. I've seen a lot of posts here debating her motivations, whether or not she was actually ""mad"", and how much agency she had when she committed her worst crimes. I'd like to discuss it a bit and see what others have to say. Also, nothing in this write-up is meant to diagnose or treat mental illnesses in real life, and I recognize that GRRM isn't an expert on mental illness either; these are fictional characters with (semi)-fictional problems.  


For some background, I work in behavioral health and love history, and there are quite a few examples in history of monarchs who struggled with their mental health. Over time, mental illness has been described in many different ways and definitions have changed. In Daenerys's universe, we have the concept of ""madness."" According to Barristan Selmy, Jaeharys II stated that ""Madness and greatness are two sides of the same coin"" and that every time a Targaryen is born, the coin is flipped.   


The best example of this madness we have in the show are the actions of Aerys II, whose paranoia and increasingly bizarre behavior completely destabilizes the kingdoms and leads to Robert's Rebellion. Aerys slowly becomes more and more suspicious of those around him, including his own son, and eventually murders members of the Stark family. He evens holds his son's family as hostages and prevents them from getting to safety, and meets his end after ranting about dragonfire and threatening to burn everyone and everything.  


So what happened?  When analyzing mental illness, it's important to get a thorough history of when it started and in what context. We can very roughly look at it in terms of more organic mental illnesses (like schizophrenia/bipolar) or more contextual (conduct disorder in a child who was abused). These are by no means exclusive and heavily overlap in real life.

&amp;#x200B;

Aerys came from a family with a purported history of mental illness, had a relatively uneventful childhood, and began to decline in early adulthood after acts of defiance from unruly subjects. He didn't have a history of extreme behavioral issues as a child, like the character Joffrey did. All of this evidence points towards a psychotic spectrum disorder, most likely schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is: genetic/heritable, typically has onset in early adulthood, and manifests with delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized behavior or speech. Aerys checks these boxes, and the kingdom suffered for it.

&amp;#x200B;

Aerys's children seem to be variable in terms of their mental health, much like the coin analogy would predict. Rhaegar did not show any evidence of psychosis. Viserys had clear behavioral problems, but in a very different way from his father. He had a completely fractured childhood (homelessness, fear, etc) and was more prone to rage and frustration when he didn't get his way instead of bizarre delusions. This points more towards a looming personality disorder than psychosis, but we didn't see enough of him to be sure. That brings us to Daenerys.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite having the same difficult childhood as her brother, Daenerys does not share his impulsiveness or insecurity. For the earlier part of the series, she is cool, calculating, and idealistic. As she gains power, we see more violent actions on her part (like the crucifixions) but nothing that would be completely out of character for a ruler in this universe. She is driven and wants to help those that she rules. However, in the final season we see a distinct shift. Daenerys slowly becomes more and more paranoid that those around her will attempt to usurp her, which in some cases was warranted. This paranoia begins to spread to her closest advisors, which tragically creates a self-fulfilling prophecy in which one actually does turn on her. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, the moment that Daenerys starts to manifest the latent mental illness her father suffered from is when Missandei is executed. This event causes significant psychiatric trauma; after all, Missandei was one of the few people Daenerys didn't suspect of treachery. Days later, Tyrion visits her quarters to find her disheveled and disorganized; she appears to be sleep-deprived, isn't tending to personal hygiene, and her plans have become more focused on destruction. This leads to her seemingly sudden decision to destroy King's Landing and compromise all of the ""liberating"" she had done overseas. Her delusions of paranoia, bizarre behavior, young age, and family history all point to an episode of psychosis.

&amp;#x200B;

Interestingly, the next time we see Daenerys, her demeanor has completely changed. She gives a rousing speech to her remaining Unsullied and Dothraki supporters, appearing energetic and chipper. When Jon visits her before the Iron Throne, she explains her grand plans to liberate the world and be the ultimate decider of what is good and evil, all with a smile on her face. This distinct shift appears to be an episode of mania; her behavior is no longer disorganized, she is not disheveled, but now has energy, a very bright appearance, and speaks with grandiosity and purpose. While the quick change may appear jarring, it is consistent with a sudden mood episode. The connection between Daenerys's suspected mania and psychosis is difficult to ascertain; if they are one in the same, she would fit a bipolar disorder with psychotic features picture; if they are distinct, which seems more likely, schizoaffective, bipolar type. Both are related via genetics to schizophrenia, and both can be devastating to someone with power.

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion, from what I have seen, the Targaryen ""madness"" does seem consistent with modern definitions of mental illness, at least within Daenerys's immediate family. Her father Aerys had paranoid delusions and disorganized behavior suggestive of schizophrenia, whereas her brother Viserys displayed evidence of a looming personality disorder, like antisocial or borderline. Daenerys herself seems to have suffered from a psychotic episode followed by lingering mania, which is seen in schizoaffective disorder, and has the appropriate family history and age of onset.

(SPOILERS) This post will contain (SPOILERS) for the entirety of the show. You were warned! (SPOILERS)

Have the spoiler folk left yet?

I have a theory about the Maggie the Frog prophecy regarding Cersei. The book and the show differ a bit, but there was a specific part that struck me. The majority of this will be focusing on the SHOW, so if there is contradicting info in the books I apologize, but a bit of book bits and pieces will also be popping up, especially for clarity sake for those who know both.

This bit in particular (using the book quote): ""I will be queen, though?"" asked the younger her.  
""Aye."" Malice gleamed in Maggys yellow eyes. ""Queen you shall be . . . until there comes another, younger and more beautiful, to cast you down and take all that you hold dear.""

We know that most of the prophecies in the show are either complete B.S. or that they shouldnt be trusted (sometimes both!). Therefore, Maggie's prediction should have been taken with a grain of salt, to say the least.

In the book, after Cersei's prophecy, her friend requests one too, and after asking if she will marry Jaime (Cersei's ""we were born together, we belong together"" BFFF \[you can guess what the last F stands for\]), she is told that she will die today. Cersei fulfills this prophecy by pushing her friend down a well.

This is the moment that the prophecy begins. Cersei ensuring that her friend would never be a threat between her and Jaime, and so that the secrets she learned stay secret.

With so many of Maggies details coming true, it seems at the very least her prophecy was as accurate as any prophecy in Westeros, and in fact a bit too accurate with no twists or turns, so it seems.

However, what if I told you that we knew and were told who the ""younger and more beautiful \[woman\], to cast you down and take all that you hold dear"" was by time we got to Maggies prophecy, and in fact since very early on?

I know what many of you are thinking, but give me a chance to change your mind.

We know from the other details that Maggies prophecy is spot on, so the ""younger ... beautiful"" woman should be true as well, following the logic that the rest of the extremely detailed information was accurate, the whole thing should be.

In the show, Maggie says: ""Oh yes, you will be queen... for a time. Then comes another, younger*...* more beautiful*...* to cast you down and take all that you hold dear.""  
In the book, Maggie says: ""Aye."" Malice gleamed in Maggys yellow eyes. ""Queen you shall be . . . until there comes another, younger and more beautiful, to cast you down and take all that you hold dear.""

Both bits are glossed over in the show and book so Cersei can ask about if she will have kids, of which we're informed, including the death of her three with the golden shrouds, etc. It seems like the other parts of the prophecy are more important, her marrying the king and her children dying, but the middle part is the key.

In the end, the person who has always been key in Cersei's future undoing was...........

Cersei herself!

Either accidentally, or through her own actions, Cersei became her own prophecy.

In the book, as stated above, its suggested she killed her friend who went with her, shoving her down a well to die that day, just as Maggie had said. Perhaps if Cersei avoided her most Cersei of instincts and didnt kill her friend, she could have avoided the prophecy, but here is where it started.

In the show, we are not told of the fate of Cersei's friend, only the flashback.

Cersei was a direct influence in the deaths of all of her children.

We are also told over and over how one of Cersei's most redeeming qualities was her extreme love of her children.

Joffrey: She refused to act like a mother and a queen and give her favored son the proper discipline she should because she adored Joffrey from childhood. She often holds her tongue (very much not in check with Cersei's character) with him and later tells a story about how parents always say they dont have a favorite but reveals that they always do and that Joffrey was hers and she would spend hours just staring at him. Couple that with the gorgeous Margaery Tyrell showing up and seeming for all the world to be what would fulfill the prophecy. He was an unruly brat who was thrust into power with no one to check his worst impulses as a teenager which got him killed.

Marcella: Marcella was kind of always in the background. Cersei loved all of her children but she gave Marcella the least attention. When she was shipped off to Dorne, even though she threw a fit of rage, she didnt use her considerable power to stop the arrangement. Had Marcella stayed in Kings Landing, she would not have been poisoned by Ellaria Sand. She was a neglected young girl used as a political pawn which ended up getting him killed.

Tommen: Oh poor Tommen. The boy with two faces and lives. After losing her first two children as the prophecy stated, Cersei was extremely overprotective of him as he was not only her last child but now the king as well. Her little Tommen also had Margaery once again try to take one of her sons, of whom she was extremely protective of. When Cersei blew the Sept of Baylor, torching Tommens tasty treat, along side a few other people, her took his flying leap.

While it may seem at first glance like Maggie was pretty spot on, theres a glaring omission. Margaery had nothing to do with Marcella at all, nor with Jaime. We were told specifically that she would be cast down and loose all she holds dear by one younger and more beautiful. Margaery also did not cast Cersei down, it was the other way around. If anything, Margaery helped raise Cersei up to Queen!

Here is how Cersei was her own worse enemy.

Immediately after the Maggie the Frog incident, Cersei likely killed her friend by pushing her down a well, beginning the prophecy in earnest. Had she not taken this step, perhaps everything would have turned out differently, but she had.

From here on out I'll just be discussing the show as we know its totality.

As listed above, her direct actions led to the death of each of her children. It is suggested that Cersei grew tired of Robert and had him drugged (or at least VERY drunk) during his hunt and hopefully get wounded, which Robert was, fatally. In turn, this put Joffrey in the position of power with no true father figure or anyone who could or would stand up to him. She made more of a stink being told that she would have to marry Loras Tyrell than when Marcella was shipped off to Dorne. Once it came to Tommen, she feared for the prophecy, her last child, and probably most importantly at this point, for herself and being ""cast down"".

What Cersei did not realize was that so many of her cruel actions was what eventually made the prophecy come true.

The Cersei of youth, the younger and more beautiful version of herself, is who took all she holds dear from herself and cast her down, both metaphorically and literally. She held her children and Jaime more than anything else in the world and yet she got each of these killed.

Even in the flashback, she is referred to as the ""YOUNGER"" her. (""I will be queen, though?"" asked the ***younger*** her.  
"")

**Cersei is the younger, more beautiful one to cast herself down.**

Roberts death, at the hands of Cersei through the wine/drugs kickstarted her prophecy in the show. It was like a domino effect. Had she not done what she did, Joffrey would not have been a boy-king, Tyrion would not have been in a position to play his game and have to follow through with the one fake secret that leaked (shipping Marcella to Dorne), and had Robert AND Joffrey not died so quickly, Tommen too would not have been yet another unprepared boy-king with a huge case of the puppy love/raging hormones. Every single death of her children was a direct result of her own actions.

When she was cast down, it was after she had thought she lost everything and she fled from her royal apartment overlooking the city, she fled from the throne room and the Iron Throne, she fled lower into Kings Landing and thats where she finally came upon Jaime, and as promised they came into this world together and left this world together.

\----------

Finally, for the book people (based on the shows ending): **The Valonqar Prophecy** \- ""...and when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life out of you.

As Cersei stumbles about at the ground level of the castle, she seems to be holding back tears, until she sets her eyes on Jaime, where she finally bursts out crying. Jaime wraps his arms high around her. Jaime continues to hold her before they have a little afternoon chat real quick, before descending even further into the castle, being cast down into the depths of Kings Landing. The once mighty high queen in her high apartment, sitting in her high throne above the lords and ladies of Westeros, now cast down below the castle.

Cersei begins to freak out, realizing her death is likely at hand and begins having a panic attack, and literally choking on her tears. Jaime grabs her by the neck and pulls her close before shouting ""LOOK AT ME!"" They exchange pleasantries as a lil dust is knocked loose here n there. As the final bricks fall, Jaime is towering over Cersei, his hand wrapped around her neck.  
It is not inconceivable that Jaime would have used his body to protect Cersei and their child, shielding the falling rubble with his own body as his arm was around her neck, thus even though she may have survived, the combination of dirt and dust as well as his arm around her neck could have likely filled the Valonqar choking the life from her.  
When Tyrion removes the rubble, we indeed find Jaime on top of Cersei (though no hand on her neck), and for someone who just had a castle fall on top of her, she looks REMARKABLY unscathed. Additionally, the wrapping of the hands around the throat and choking the life out of her seem connected but may not be. Jaime did wrap his hands around her neck/throat but perhaps when he tried to protect her, she was safe under Jaimes corpse, but his and the bricks weight was too great and the life was choked out of her.

Some may ask why she was so much ""higher"" than Jaime in the rubble then... dont worry I got you.  
After Jaime sacrificed his body to save Cersei, she was choking, trapped under the rubble and her dead brother. She knew she had to get free, so she used the last of her strength to try to climb out from the rocky tomb she found herself in.... but alas, her strength only was able to get her a few feet before she could no longer move and succumbed to her fate.",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

At first I was just an observer, I saw Dany riding on Drogon, but here Drogon was really huge, it wasn't just that he piggyback carried her like in show, rather, she somehow stood on his neck, while holding on to the back of the top of his head.

&amp;#x200B;

For whatever reason there was Viserys too, but on ground; I don't believe he said anything, but there was some negative air about him in regard to Dany, similar to those times after she married Drogo, and started to become more and more important to Dothraki, while her brother didn't seem to matter at all compared to her, which made him furious, and jealous.

That's how Viserys felt.

&amp;#x200B;

Riding on Drogon, Dany reached something which seemed like an incredibly big mountain, or a castle, while Varys looked like he can't go with her, because he simply doesn't deserve it, not because of morals, but there was simply some kind of force of nature that made him decide to stay aside, that this whole moment is bigger than him.

&amp;#x200B;

It wasn't said this huge castle, or whatever was a Red Keep, nor that what Dany (or me, if you wish) was trying to reach was the Iron Throne, but it definitely felt like it is as important as the goal, or purpose in one's life.

&amp;#x200B;

Drogon couldn't fly on the summit of it, so instead he bited on to something as high as he could, and made himself a ladder for Dany, although she still had to climb a bit herself, including moving to the side by hanging on a rail.

&amp;#x200B;

The whole moment of her reaching the summit felt so important, and sacred in a way, like this is the most important this in life, and in a way combined with feeling similar to those in movies, or series, or games, where a character is opening door without seeing through, or seeing the light on the end of dark tunnel, usually prior to reaching their goal, or people they were after for a long time.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, being on top, she had something to see, there were all important people in her life who apparently died on her quest to reach whatever she was after, although I only remember Drogo, and Tyrion (yeah, him too).

&amp;#x200B;

They were all sitting around a big table...

&amp;#x200B;

I can't remember what exactly had been said, but I think Dany asked about something, probably the whole purpose of her journey, and that Tyrion answered her ""If you don't know it yourself, how is anyone else supposed to know it?""

&amp;#x200B;

Now, this where it kind of turns into odd, and bizzare, but then again, that is exactly how dreams are...

&amp;#x200B;

Few moments later, it is revealed that the whole thing started with Al Bundy, and his wife Peggy from Married... with Children, having some kind of a conflict, or disagreement, and then they did something with what looked like wird little items, and then suddenly world turned into the one of Westeros.

&amp;#x200B;

For me it's the how. I can see Daenerys turn mad with absolute power, maybe give in to a strand of mental illness in her lineage. Then losing the respect and support of her council, and as she starts to set the world on fire, those like Varys realize it's up to them to protect the people.

&amp;#x200B;

So the problem is not the ending. It's how they got there.

&amp;#x200B;

**When did she turn raging mad?** She had been held back for weeks from taking Kings Landing, delaying the war to the profit of her enemy that got stronger, built more alliances and developed a weapon to fight her dragons with the extra time afforded. 

**Daenerys is a Dothraki**, and she brought her Dothrakis with her. Who expected her to be a nun? Given the current state of affairs, the betrayal of her own people, the loss of those she cared about due to the way the war had turned out. It made perfect sense for her to want to send a message to Westeros in the style of her Dothraki and Targaryen roots. You mess with the dragons you'll be burned to ashes. It's a perfectly reasonable medieval message and more than warranted given the multiple opportunities she afforded Kings Landing to change their fate.

**Others in her era do it all the time.** Cercei would not have wasted a moment to use the dragons - she used wildfire on her own civilians inside her own city. No Baratheon or any other kind would have held back a weapon like the dragons. They would have attacked Kings Landing immediately and that's exactly what Daenerys should have done too. She would still have had 3 dragons and probably would have had to do less killing to send the appropriate message of fear.

**After she's won she has to address her troops.** 2 armies that traveled with her for years, for this glorious moment to take back her throne. They have given plenty and suffered extreme losses in the 2 recent battles. She needs to speak to them as a commander and give them a sense of direction for their future. Saying that they will continue on to great honorable glory is the correct speech in that situation.

**So where's the madness?** How is any of this out of step with the medieval stuff happening left and right in Westeros? She's sent messages of fear before, it's her style. She's a Targaryen that uses dragons to burn stuff down. She's a Dothraki that takes and pillages. But to her advisors that have seen it all before, all of the sudden she's the mad queen and must be ended.

**And who wields the blade?** The most likely person to understand and forgive her. The one that gives her a chance to explain herself. And she says all the right things. A ruler can't rule if not respected, and the people of Westeros have proven hard-headed and two-faced so she must impose order. He asks what's to hold her from future excess, she lovingly says it can be you, come rule with me and together we can make sure we always do the right thing. He listens to what she has to say and he thinks: wow! this mad bitch! Love her or not, such an unreasonable person cannot be allowed to stand. Because we had justice, fairness, peace and kindness in this kingdom before this monster arrived, and we will go right back to being fair and compassionate with each other as soon as she dies.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't dislike the ending. I disliked the nonsense and the loss of a journey to get there. Nobody thought this through enough to tell a compelling story.

Follow along with this amazing and groundbreaking logic.

Fact: Prophecies are very important words.

THEREFORE: Prophecies are wind.



Fact: ""Passing wind"" is a euphemism for farting.

Fact: Farting expels hot air.

Facts: Being ""full of hot air"" means you keep saying words, but they're meaningless and stupid.

THEREFORE: All of the prophecies, like Azor Ahai or Quaith's words, are meaningless and stupid.

Constant exposure to hard water tends to stain blonde hair to a bronze/rust colored shade. Back when they were in Casterly Rock and Kings Landing, the Lannister brothers lived the high life with access to proper water reserves from rain/rivers. When they set out their adventures they had to make do with whatever quality of water(ground water?) they had access to which over time resulted in their blonde hair turning brown. Solved!

From the realisation that the titular ""Knight"" is Brienne (my all time favorite character) to the Jenny of Oldstones montage, this episode is packed with instant classic scenes. 

Theon and Sansa heartwarming (and heartbreaking) reunion.

Brienne vouching for Jaimie.

The iconic fireplace scenes.

The looming dread of the next ep. Watching this for the first time not knowing who would make it to ep 4 was such a thrill

Jon reunitingwith edd and tormund.

Briennes Knighting. 

Tyrion and Jaimie together again.

Sam giving Jorah Heartsbane.

The one gripe i had initially was Aryas sex scene mainly because it felt jarring and i didn't like seeing arya in a sexual situation. But on a rewatch it makes so much more sense and is done quite tastefully. Gendry and her have a pure relationship and it feels accurate to what they would have done before a huge battle.

The episode feels satisfying and intimate. You are sitting right next to these characters you've grown to love while the fire crackles and Pod sings Jenny of Oldstones. It all feels earned and they hit every emotional beat. It was an hour of spending time with characters reminiscing before the end in the audience's most nostalgic setting, Winterfell.

A lot of traveling and events have been going on since she conceived in s7e3, shouldnt she be close to giving birth? At the very least she should be 4 months along when she died, but she hardly had a belly. On some shots it looks like she have a small bump but on others she looks almost completely flat. I know not all women show much and that her dress might hide some of it, also back in s1 Dany didnt show (even with bare belly) until the episode she gave birth, but still? 
I guess it doesnt matter since theyre dead, but I found it weirdly annoying not getting a obvious sign and since it was literally her whole plot point this season, why not go all in and show her with a bigger belly? Was it so they could add her tricking Euron into thinking it was his?
I didnt know if to believe her to begin with, but I always leaned towards that she actually was pregnant.

And judging from her last scene, about how she wanted her baby to live: I would say she defiently was pregnant. It was the first thing that came to her mind when she knew she was doomed and she seemed genuine. Also; if many months had passed; Tyrion and Jaime who knew about her pregnancy would surely notice her lack of big belly, theyve seen her pregnant before. They didnt question it at all. We also didnt get any hints that it was a lie (or menopause, or illness or that she lost the baby or whatever) at all, so I take it that she was preggers but just not showing much (or more fast travel)?",9,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

back to my point. these people are always going into battle with each other, they're probably really tired. it seems pretty silly because if they used all the time and energy they spent fighting, they could all just build their own got damn thrones

Yara's fleet is destroyed and she is captured, removing her from the conflict. The Night King acquires a dragon given him and his army an easy way past the wall, there is a deadly battle at Winterfell resulting in a 50% loss of life including Jorah, Theon, and Beric. Meanwhile, Qyburn has time to manufacture ballistas that take out another dragon, and Euron is able to ferry the Golden Company to KL. Missandei is also captured and killed.

All of this was  because Tyrion was worried about Dany killing innocent people in KL when she went to take the Iron Throne. But the end result was exactly what Tyrion feared, on a scale of the entire city being burned!

What Tyrion could have advised instead was for Dany to fly her three full grown dragons after initially landing on Dragon Stone, parking them right outside the Red Keep. Then give Cersei a choice. She could go back to Casterly Rock and become the Warden of the West, provided that she and the Lannister army bent the knee to Danyereus. Or the Red Keep could be burned down right then. Some other people would die, but Dany had no motivation to go Mad Queen at that point on the rest of the city. And Cersei had no defense against dragons yet. 

Euron would have just sailed his fleet off to some other land, or gotten himself burnt trying to bang Dany. As for the NK, once Dany had the throne, then she could help the North  defend the wall, since the NK wouldn't have an easy way through. And Dany would have command of every remaining army in Westeros.

While watching 'the bells' all I could think was that Daenerys was worse than Cersie and how much I hated her by the end.  Even though Daenery knew Cersie surrendered she still went on a murdering rampage. I was glad Jon killed her but was annoyed he was so upset about it and Tyrion still had any postive feels towards her.  To me she just felt like another tyrant ruler in the making.

And even though I just whined about Daenery being a murder I admit that I loved the way Cersie destroyed the Sept of Baelor. That was an incredible scene",21,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Taking into account the already set style of narration in season 8 ... And taking into account the acting changes due to some changes in situations and scenes ...

Minor changes in series 4 and 5:

Conversation of Varys and Tyrion, where Varys proves that John is the best king, took place. But Varis is still not executed. When Tyrion speaks with Deineris, he does not tell her that she was betrayed. He tells her that with Varys he knows who John Snow is.

Tyrion: Your Majesty, we know by Varis about John Snow ...

Daeneris: Yes, I know. He betrayed me.

Tyrion: No! Your Majesty, he only told his sister, and she told me.

Daeneris: Yes, he said that he did not want the crown. I asked him anyway not to tell anyone this, said what it would lead to. He told his sister anyway, she told you, and you told Varis before telling me. You all betrayed! By the way, why did Sansa tell you all this?

Tyrion: Because she trusts me, one of the few. I am your Hand, and Varis is the master of the whispers. We must know. We now need to think about attacking the Royal Harbor. Troops fully arrived.

At the beginning of the 5th series, the scene of Deanerys and John remains unchanged.

In the scene, in the throne room of the Dragonstone, where Tyrion tells the plan for an attack on Royal Harbor, Varis is not executed.

Similarly, Deineris tells Tirion about Jaime captured.

He tells both (and Varis and Tirion) that if they fail him again, this will be the last time.

All other scenes 4 and 5 of the series are similar to those shown.

   
 

6 series:

The scenes with Jaime and Cersei are similar.

With possible abbreviations, without precise details, the course of events is as follows:

John, Tyrion, Varis and Davos are walking along the ruined Royal Harbor.

Varys (to John): You still don't want the crown? Don't you think people will be better for people? Perhaps now that I have sent letters to all the Lords of Westeros with information about your origin, will you change your mind? Moreover, the queen can guess about everything.

John: What? What for? Although ... It's my fault. I told Sanz. Now everyone knows. We all betrayed her. We are all largely to blame for everything that happened.

John and Davos are leaving ...

Walking through the city, they meet Arya.

John (extremely surprised and frightened): Arya? How did you get here?

Arya: I came to kill Cersei, but your queen overtook me.

John: Go to the army over the gate, then I will find you.

They diverge.

Again show Tyrion and Varys.

Varys: We need help solving the problem.

Tyrion (looking at Varys' face): John will never agree to this and will not agree.

Varys: He does not need.

Tyrion: What are you counting on? If the queen will not, and John will choose the king, he will guess about the traitors. And then what?

Varys: With the help of my little birds I hired a faceless person to do the work. And if John guesses, I dont care. The higher the risk, the higher the reward. I will say that one did everything. I do not serve kings and queens, I serve people.

Again show John and Davos.

They meet the Gray Worm and the Immaculate, Punishing Lannisters. John is trying to stop them. He says that you need to talk to the queen.

Show Tirion, already walking alone in the city. Further, all the scenes with finding the dam, under which Jaime and Cersei are similar.

The scene with the appeal of Deaneris to the army is similar. John, Davos, Gray Worm, Tyrion, Varis come.

After the speech, Deaneris also tells Tirion that he let go of his brother, that this is a betrayal. Tyrion likewise refuses to be a hand. The queen orders his arrest and then leaves.

John: I'll go talk to Deyneris.

Davos: Now, maybe she will only accept you.

John leaves.

Varys pointedly looks into the trail of outgoing John.

The scene in which Deineris walks through the throne room and wants to touch the Iron Throne ...

Instead of John (as it was taken down) Missandea enters the throne room.

Missandea: Your Majesty, you have been with this for so long.

Deaneris: Missandea? How? You got killed!

Missandea (coming closer and taking out the knife): Yes, I am not her.

Deaneris: What does this mean? What are you doing?

Missandea (having already taken out the knife): I am nobody. God of death needs you to die. I do his will.

At this time, John, both lost and surprised, enters the throne room.

John: Missandea? How are you? ... Everyone saw your head cut off on the wall. What are you doing with a knife here?

John puts his hand on the sword's hand.

Missayedeya: I'm not her. (Starts to run to John) And I'm here to kill your queen.

John: What? ...

John has time to pull the sword. The fight begins. Everyone in the process strikes. Everything happens very quickly. Ultimately, Missandea (faceless) has time to strike in the abdomen. John falls.

Shocked, Deneris looks at everything from the Iron Throne.

Missandea (heading towards Deineris): After all, no one will be? No one will come to you now.

At that moment, Arya enters the throne room. Seeing John lying, she runs over to him.

Arya: John, John, you're badly hurt.

John: Arya, why didn't you leave? I told you to leave the gate.

Arya: I heard Tyrion and Varys talk about the murder of the queen. Varis hired the faceless and said that he was already somewhere here and could at any moment solve their question. After your queen's speech, you went to her. So I went after you.

Missandea: You will not save him, as well as yourself.

Arya quickly manages to get a needle. The fight begins. Everything happens very quickly again. Arya can hurt badly and cut the throat of Missandea.

Bloody Arya and Daineris run up to John.

John: Dany, I'm sorry. I did not want to ... We are all involved in everything that happened. You began to defend the North, lost two dragons, Jorah, Missandea. I didn't have to tell Sanz and Arieh (John looks at her). Then Tyrion and Varis betrayed you, they wanted me to be a king who I didnt want to be. We left you alone. You will always be my queen. We all did a lot, sometimes terrible. You have passed a lot, please do not forget about why you were followed, be the best ruler for the sake of ... (He speaks of his last strength and gradually calms down ...)

Show crying Deineris and Arya.

Arya: You burned the city, and John said you are his queen, that we are all to blame. He you ...

Daenerys (interrupting): Who was that? Miss Cersei killed.

Arya walks over to Missandee and takes off her mask.

Arya: It was faceless. I studied with them in Braavos. He was hired by Tyrion with Varys. Varys sent letters to all the leaders of Westeros about the origin of John. But it does not matter, they need ...

Deaneris: No! If the lords know, then they should know that too. Tyrion with Varys will get theirs.

Arya: If John didnt go to you, I wouldnt be here. And you already too.

Show Dragon's lair, all the lords who arrived.

Immaculate lead arrested Tyrion and Varys.

Also comes the Gray Worm and sits down on one of the places along with the lords.

The lords stare at each other.

Sanz: Where is the queen? We have a lot of questions? How did John die? And why are they arrested?

Gray Worm: She will be soon.

Daenerys arrives at Drogon and sits next to the Gray Worm.

Sansa: We've been waiting for you.

Deaneris: Sorry.

Sanz: Everyone cares what happened to the rightful heir.

Deineris: First Tyrion and Varis.

Sansa: It's not all ...

Daeneris (interrupting): Tyrion, would you like to say something? Or maybe you, Varis? (Does not receive a response). Yes! I burned the city. Cersei wanted to take advantage of my weakness, blocking her shield. I stopped the war with her and lost the dragons, Jorahs best friend, defending the North (looking at Sansu). I lost the Missandea.

Tyrion: Queen, this is no reason to burn the city!

Deinris: And I'm no longer going to lose anyone from my people! She could also blow up the whole city and Missandea said so. Now, because of your betrayal and conspiracy, I lost John, he was killed by the one you sent to kill me.

Sansa: (Looking at Deineris). Why should we believe you? Maybe you ordered to kill him, as a more legitimate heir?

Arya (for a while thinks about what to do and what to say): At first I didnt want to talk, but this is true. He died defending her like a queen. I heard the conversation of Tyrion and Varys. I was there when the faceless killed John. He said that everyone did different things, sometimes terrible, that she passed a lot, lost almost all of them, defended the North, that she didnt have to tell anyone about herself that we were also to blame for what happened, as well as those who had betrayed Varis with Tyrion. He asked her to be the best queen.

Sanz looks at Arya, changes her expression.

Varys: It's me! I told you that I did not serve kings and queens.

Tyrion: Varis, don't ...

Deneris: It doesn't matter anymore ... Varys, what did I promise you if you betray me?

Varys: Burn alive.

Deaneris: No one will object? Sansa?

Sanz: No (looking at Varys' face).

Tyrion: Your Majesty, although I am no longer your right hand, but ...

Deinris: First Varis!

With his gaze, Deaneris orders the immaculate lead Varis to the dragon, gets up and turns in his direction.

Deaneris: Varys, I sentence you to death. Drakaris.

Daenerys (sits back): Now you, Tirion. You always wanted me to chain my enemies and traitors. For you, I will make an exception. Take him away (ordering impeccable).

Show how they lead away Tirion. There is a quiet pause between everyone.

Arya: Everyone here because they knew who John was. He will not return. He died defending Queen Deineris. Perhaps she should be the one she was to him for us? If she is, of course, the one John was talking about. And if everyone present does not mind.

Daneris: What is in my power.

All the lords take turns: Don't mind, yes, I'm for, etc.

Yara: Ironborn have long sworn allegiance to Queen Deineris.

Sansa (silent for a while): It will be so.

They show a room (in which, in the first version, Tyrion holds a small council meeting at the end). It contains Deineris and the Gray Worm.

Deineris: Collect people and ships, send to Meerin. Bring Daario. I will need it.

Gray Worm: Yes, Queen.

Show Sansu and Arya walking down the street.

Arya: Now you are the keeper of the North. As a child, you always wanted to be a queen.

Sanz: What will happen to you now?

Arya: I will not return to the North. Sail to the West. I myself always wanted to know what was there. Moreover, the crown needs to know what is beyond the known borders of the maps.

Show the port of Royal Harbor. There are many ships in it. Some of the flawless ones are going to sail East for the Daario. Arya with part of the northerners is going to sail to the West.

They show Deaneris looking from the not destroyed part of the Red Castle at the floating ships.",1,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Today I was listening to it for the first time after the finale and I was quite shocked by the possible meaning of the lyrics of the last song: Pray - Matt Bellamy
The lyrics are:

""Zhys oso jehikagon eksiot epi

We will pray
Pray with me
We can bring her back
Pray, remember me, oh, ooh

Zhys perzys stepagon eksio o jorepi
Se morghltas ls qltsos sikagon
Hen sndrorro, os, hen perzys, hen uqr, perzys
Hen sndrorro, os, hen uqr, perzys, hen morghot, glaeson

We will pray
Pray with, with me
We can bring her back
Pray, pray
Pray with me, oh, ooh

Hen uqr perzys, hen sndrorro, os
Morghot, glaeson, morghost glaeson, 'ost glaeson
Please, please""

The undefined part is in Valyrian languague and corresponds to the Melisandre's voice reciting the formula to resurrect Jon Snow.
However the interesting part is on the other part of the lyrics, especially in the line ""We can bring HER back"".

I imagine we're all thinking the same thing right now.

1492,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2019-6-5,2019,6,5,6,bwuf08,self.gameofthrones,[Spoilers] Dany's womb and its impact,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bwuf08/spoilers_danys_womb_and_its_impact/,kalvinc2113,1559684068,"As we all know there were many allusions to Dany's womb and its viability throughout seasons 6 and 7, and most of that seems to have been a dropped plot thread. I want to extrapolate on why Dany should have actually been pregnant and how it could've affected other characters around her. 

First, obviously, it would have made it more pressing for Dany to stake her claim in order to ensure her legacy lives on through her child. It could also make her turn (which was earned but poorly pulled off) more impactful, because in her mind she's doing everything to make the world a better place for her child. In her mind, shes right because shes doing everything for the childs future not the future of Westeros, but if no one knows about the baby, she would appear crazy to them.

Let's imagine, too, that she tells Jon and no one else because I think the impact on Jon is far greater than it is on Dany. Let's assume she tells him in the crypts right before he reveals his parentage. Isn't that a better scene and makes both of them rethink their relationship? Dany now has reason to distrust Jon more because he can push his claim through this child as well. Jon realizes he's *technically* fathered a bastard, which is something he swore he would never do and he has to live with the fallout from that. With this child, he would not want it to be considered a bastard so this would force him to rush into a marriage with Dany and give him more of a reason to constantly remind everyone that ""she is our queen"". He knows that dany being queen is the best way for his child to survive.

Now let's look at it for when Jon kills Dany: think how more impactful the Varys line about the gods flipping a coin every time a targaryen is born would be if it was ringing through Jon's head after his conversation with Tyrion. He cant disown the baby (bastard thing) but also doesn't want to take the chance that this coin lands on the wrong side, especially after seeing what dany just did. Then he has the same conversation with Dany in the throne room but its framed as ""look at what we did for our child"", rather than ""we're not going to give people a choice of what to do with their lives."" She can talk about how they'll tell stories of their great conquest to the child and he/she will grow up to be a great ruler like she is now. And this is what pushes Jon over the edge, he is disgusted by what Dany did to KL and would never want his child to grow up to do similar things or even learn that this type of thing is acceptable or worse encouraged. Jon only has one choice, put an end to it. Put an end to Dany, the child, his bastard, everything. This would also make Jon's remaining life ""bittersweet"" knowing that he saved the 7 kingdoms but also being the only person who knows the true cost of that.",7,7,False,spoiler,,,,,

His father, [Rhaegar Targaryen](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Rhaegar_Targaryen) had two children in his previews marriage and his first born was named Aegon in honor of his grandfather [Aegon The 5th](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Aegon_V_Targaryen).

This [Aegon](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Aegon_Targaryen_(son_of_Rhaegar_and_Elia)) was assassinated while still being a baby by [Robert Baratheon](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Robert_Baratheon) a year before Jon Snow was born making him technically the 6th and Jon Snow the 7th Aegon by default.

Regardless of the annulation of his mother's marriage from the Targaryen family or being murdered before reaching the throne to take the title he is still the 6th Targaryen named Aegon making Snow the 7th.

There were [many other Aegon](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aegon) in that family but it seems that if they weren't under the lineage of Throne right they weren't counted. But given that baby Aegon was the Prince's first born he had a clear right to the Iron Throne and should be taking in account for the order of royal Aegons regardless of his short life.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I missing something?

**Lineage of the Royal Aegons:**

* [Aegon I](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Aegon_I_Targaryen) (Aegon the Conqueror, son of Lord Aerion Targaryen, 27 BC)
* [Aegon II](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Aegon_II_Targaryen) (Aegon the Usurper, son of King Viserys I Targaryen, 107 AC)
* [Aegon III](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Aegon_III_Targaryen) (No nickname, son of Prince Daemon Targaryen, 120AC)
* [Aegon IV](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Aegon_IV_Targaryen) (Aegon the Unworthy, son of King Viserys II Targaryen, 135 AC)
* [Aegon V](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Aegon_V_Targaryen) (Aegon the Unlikely, son of King Maekar I Targaryen, 174 AC)
* [Aegon VI](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Aegon_Targaryen_(son_of_Rhaegar_and_Elia)) (No nickname, son of Rhaegar Targaryan, 281 AC)
* [Aegon VII aka Jon Snow](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Jon_Snow) (King Of The North, son of Prince Rhaegar Targaryan, 283 AC)

Both were 'the rightful heirs' and were motivated by it, and considered the Iron Throne to be their right and duty. 

Both were linked to the element of fire, Stannis through Melisandre and her religion and Dany through her dragons. They both burned their enemies.

Both helped Jon against the enemy to the north. Stannis helped against the freefolk and Daenerys against the Dead. Also they were both very influential figures for Jon.

Both had their closest advisors betray them in favor of Jon Snow (Melisandre and Tyrion/Varys).

And they both held Dragonstone as their base of operations. 

They both lost their parents, and two brothers. They were directly involved in the death of the younger ones. (Renly killed by Melisandre, Viserys killed by Drogo while Dany watched)

Dany brought foreign forces of Dothraki and the Unsullied, and Stannis brought a foreign religion. These things made them look like outsiders to their enemies.

I think this is not a coincidence, and Stannis' fate was a warning of what will happen to Daenerys, and that being a rightful heir is not enough to be a good king",145,389,False,spoiler,,,,,

Tywin, Joffrey, Bobby B, Ned Stark, Littlefinger, Varys, Catelyn, Robb, Walder Frey, etc. all made decisions that significantly affected the direction of the story, and they were all significant players in the civil wars of Westeros.

On top of that, there were many other issues. The show just became sloppy when GRRM source material ran out. There are way too many things that don't add up, too many logical inconsistencies and plot holes. Additionally the pacing and dialogue had some major issues. 

With that said, there were some moments of great cinematography and soundtrack in the final two episodes of season 8. 

Also, Daenerys razing King's Landing was an amazing idea in theory, they just didn't execute it properly. It would have made so much more sense if King's Landing didn't surrender, and the Lannister armies were actually putting up a fight. 

The scene with Dany in the burnt down throne room as she finally reaches the Iron Throne is one of my favorite scenes in the series, I love the music and the visuals. I just wish they had done a better job leading up to this scene so people could appreciate it more.",96,32,False,spoiler,,,,,

It would be a lot easier if white walkers were our greatest challenge.

Jon Snow is struggling to convince people in the South that white walkers are real.

Hold the door was as if time was an illusion, the future the past and the present were one. Everything was there at one moment, everything was ONE. 

Going through all kinds of fan theories and alt-shift x videos, it just baffled my tiny mind, everything was sooo deep, like there was something, something big, and i just have a glimpse of it rn, and the big's about to come. 

The faceless men, the fist of the first men, legend of you know who, the three eyed raven, the night, the game of thrones, So much to digest, to fantasize about, to think about, to feel, 

And then they did shit, i dont even wanna acknowledge it, they had Jon stab Dany, et cetera , and suddenly all of it vanished, the feeling, the deeper connection to something, something idk, the feeling of being ONE. I am not complaining, just trying to share my experience,

As its shown on T.V, the foot soldiers all appear privy to the plan; they act it out with ease and little hesitation. Outside the castle, its quite clear that the soldiers were acting on the Rains of Castamere signal like a well-oiled machine. This seems to show without a doubt that this wasnt an operation kept secret only to the officers; every Frey soldier knew the plan.

That being said, doesnt this seem almost impossible to pull off successfully? The four thousand Frey levies are largely farm boys and other peasantry; sure, some are hardened killersbut most arent. Out of several thousand men, it only takes a handful to have their conscience get the better of them and rat our Lord Walders plan to one of the Stark captains or nobility. Even if not a single Frey farm boy levy snitched, the majority of soldiers would be noticeably on edge or nervous before carrying out the operation.

Heck, Olenna probably had Tyrell Household guards that could have done the same. Armored, trained, Kingsguard knights could have easily slaughtered priests in robes wielding clubs. Even some basic armored Tyrell household guards that were with Olenna could have easily destroyed the Faith Militiant. Yet Margaery allowed herself to be arrested and didnt order the guards to protect her??? Olenna didnt attempt to have her own guards defend Margaery?? Tonmen let his Queen be arrested by a bald guy in rags without ordering the Kingsguard?? Like what...

And in the next Ep (ep7) Cersei is arrested by the High Sparrow. How does that happen??? She could have easily ordered her Kingsguard knights to kill Septa Unella and again, cut off the High Sparrows head... In fact, when the Tyrell army storms Kings Landing a few eps ahead, why didnt they just attack the Sept of Baelor and slaughter absolutely everyone? It seems they all had a lot of leeway with the bald guy in rags calling himself a Sparrow and all his club-wielding supporters in the area of you know, just killing all of them...

So it just seems weird to me that all these times members of the Royal Family are arrested by a weird cult faction, no one thinks to just kill all the Sparrows... The fact that Cersei had to resort to clandestinely blowing up the Great Sept without thinking to just massacre them all is absurd...

Everyone is perfectly entitled to have their own views, this is just my way of justifying why I believe season 8 was actually ok. Season 8 still has many flaws but was overall decent imo. 

One of the biggest complaints about the final season was the way the white walkers were dealt with. First off, the fact that we barely learned anything about their motives. Maybe that was the point. They really were just monsters that wanted to destroy humans which is why they werent the final villains and were just a very important side plot to set up the final showdown for the iron throne. Also, many were upset about the white walkers themselves not fighting but all the wights would die if the white walker created them died especially with the night king. So if anything, it is the most logical that they would try to stay away from the fight themselves. This also brings up an issue as to why the night king would put himself at risk and take so long to attempt to kill bran which I do agree with. The white walker conclusion may not have been as fulfilling as people hoped but it does make the most sense given the nature of the white walkers. 

The other major issue I am hearing about is Danys sudden turn to madness. I couldnt disagree more. Ever since her dragons were born she has had crazy tendencies that were only stopped because of those she trusted who helped talk her down. The show has emphasized this many times. Its also not like it all happened super quickly. The time between the 3rd, 4th, and 5th episodes were longer than we were shown and during that time Dany just continued to lose more and more close to her and eventually became too much for her to bear. As soon as Jorah died, I knew she was going to do something bad in the near future. I dont really know what people wanted and think would be better. Dany already seemed to be close to the edge at the beginning of the season but that was pushed to the side because of the more immediate threat of the white walkers. 

Finally, another apparently huge issue is the disservice to many characters. I already discussed Dany so I wont go into more detail about her. 
Jon: many people are upset that he just kept saying the same things and didnt do anything major during the white walker army. Other than Arya, he probably contributed the most with Rhaegal. Just because he didnt fight a white walker which would have been illogical like stated before, does not mean he didnt help a lot. Also, his lame dialogue was not because his character was bad but because in the second half all people really cared about him was that he was the true heir and all they said was shit about if he trusts dany or that he should be king. What else should he have responded with? His ending was one of the most satisfying in the show and he ended up where he always belonged.

Jaime: his arc was as tragic as it was beautiful. A man seeks redeemption for his sins and thinks he finally finds a happy life but realizes that he can never forgive himself for his actions and resigns to go die with the only person he ever truly loved. He is simply acting as a human who tries to escape an addiction but in the end is sucked back in which leads to his death. 

Tyrion: Everyone said Tyrion became dumb in the last couple seasons but many things Tyrion suggested to do Dany refused to listen which in turn is what caused problems, the bells at kings landing just the biggest of them. Also, a lot of things that went wrong were because Cersei outmanuvered him, displaying both of their power dynamic and struggles. He also himself acknowledges how he used to be wiser at one point. 

Bran: manipulated the entire story so that he could become king. Probably the only logical choice in the end.

Overall, there were many problems with season 8, just as plot inconsistencies, or things that were rushed that shouldnt have been but they were generally minor aspects and the major aspects of the story were done effectively in a way that were certainly unexpected but still satisfying.",40,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Not only was his reign largely peaceful and prosperous, but he actually ensured that the Lannisters would be significantly weakened after his death by driving both the Crown and Castley Rock to the brink of bankruptcy. 

&amp;#x200B;

This meant that the Tywin was forced to make allegences with other powerful families, was unable to buy sellswords and had to keep the smallfolk on side. 

&amp;#x200B;

Had Tywin been in possession of his fortune, the Starks would not have been the only ones for whom the Reigns of Castlemere was played; he'd have destroyed his opponents quickly and thoroughly. Moreover, Tywin's weakened position also meant that he had to bring in Tyrion because, as he could not rely on brute force, brains were needed and Tywin couldn't be everywhere at once. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tyrion and the Tyrells were a powerful moderating force, who were able to limit the cruelty and stupidity of Jaime, Cersei and Joffery. Even though they ultimately failed, due to Cersei's viciousness, they forced Cersei to show her true colours, which left her vulnerable (as neither nobility nor smallfolk trusted her) and ultimately cost her Jaime and Tommen.

&amp;#x200B;

So, although Robert may have been a drunken glutton, his spendthrift ways made things a lot more difficult for Tywin and forced Cersei to show her true colours. We can't even say it was inadvertant because I expect Robert enjoyed spending Tywin's cash and wasted as much of it as possible as a 'f u'.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. Bonus fact; During the Dance of the Dragons, the Lannisters defeated the Rhaena Targaryen by taking the Crown's gold. It was rather poetic that the Crown firmly placed the Lannisters on the road to defeat by pulling the same trick on them.",39,53,False,spoiler,,,,,

I relate to Jon. I'm not much of a riddle person myself. But I do like to think things through. It's an interesting thought to approach greatest and madness this way, it's a great way to ignite a fire in your brain. But it's also a trap, because if you stay there, you are depriving your self from so much more. 

What happened to Dany those few seconds on that dragon as she's sitting there, looking at the Red Keep, hearing the bell ringing? Why was I holding my breath? Was I waiting for her coin to fall? Did she just go mad? 

It's tempting to seek easy answers to difficult questions. But to me, the ""Mad Queen"" theory was never enough. It's a disgraceful oversimplification to an incredibly complex and wonderful character. And I'm not buying it that the only exception to blame here is the genes. 

To me her coin has landed a long time ago. And if I was to put it in a riddle myself, I'd say it hit the ground on the side and it never stopped spinning. And it was never about greatest or madness. It was about two souls living in one body, trying to make peace. 

The one side is Dany, the girl with the gentle heart, who can be ruthless when she needs to, but is also thoughtful, compassionate and just. I love Dany, but this is not a post about her. Not because she's not just as important, but because she's easier to understand. 

On the other side her entire story was that she believed it was her destiny to rule and her duty to build a better world. Not only because of her name, but because she was special, above all others, almost a godlike figure. And that's totally understandable. This is the girl who stepped into the fire with 3 stone eggs and came out unburnt with three dragons. Just take a moment and really think K about that. How could she not believe in that? It was totally justified to believe she is someone special who came into this world to achieve something no one else could. That's what kept her going. Faith. Not in any gods, not in myths, in herself. In Daenerys Targaryen.

It is also understandable she believed she knew what is good and right and others don't get to choose. As Tyrion asked Jon, if you believed that, if you truly believed all that about yourself, would you let anything stand between you and paradise? The answer is simple. Daenerys was giving the answer from season 1. She was willing to burn cities to the ground, she was taking oaths to burn her enemie's stone houses, if that's what was needed to be done in order to fulfill her destiny. And that was always her first impulse, she always had to be persuaded against it. Until she lost everything but a dragon.

People say she had already won in Kings Landing. She won absolutely nothing. Nobody will support her, nobody loves her, she's not a messiah in westeros, people don't get on their knees worshiping her like a goddess, they don't hold her up in the air. If she stops there, it's over. They will follow Jon. She has to go on. It has to be fear. It's all she's got left. She explained how she views the situation, how this is her mercy to future generations. And she will do it, as she always said she would.

People say she killed innocents for no purpose, which is simply not true. We shouldn't ignore what the character is saying. We should listen to her and pay attention. There is a purpose. She explained it.

Tyrion is talking to her about innocents.""In Meereen, the slaves turned on the masters and liberated the city themselves the moment I arrived"", she answers. She is accusing them for not standing up to Cersei.

Tyrion says they are afraid, they are hostages.""They are. In a tyrant's grip. Whose fault is that? Mine?"", she answers. She is holding them accountable. The slaves were hostages too. They rebelled. The people of Kings Landing don't. She's telling you, It's not her fault. If they don't care about their lives enough to rebel, why would she?

Tyrion tries to make her change her mind talking about how thousands of children will die if the city burns. Again, she does not care. She says if Cersei thinks this as her weakness, she is wrong. She will show mercy, not to them, but to the future generations who will never again be held hostage by a tyrant. Because they will fear Daenerys more than any tyrant.

That's the fear she's talking about. That's how she is going to liberate people of other cities. And she is willing to do what it takes to achieve this. Shes not gonna let this stand in her way. Her goal is greater than this. It's worth it. She doesn't caree if Tyrion, or Jon or anyone else thinks it's wrong. She's is telling us, they don't get to choose. It's her purpose, her destiny. She won't be judged by lesser men. They don't know. It's not easy to see a world that doesn't already exist. They can't see it. She can.

The people of Kings Landing are not innocents to her, they are cowards, a weapon used against her. And the ones who are innocent, like children, it's out of her hands, it's not her fault, it won't stop her, she won't hide behind small mercies, it's all for the greater good. She doesn't want to do it, look at her on the dragon hearing the bells, she's not mad, she realizes what she has to do and she's terrified of it. Of course she is. This not the Night King. This is Dany. She had other choices before. She doesn't anymore. Her only choice is to be what all this time she was trying to suppress. A Dragon.

There is a reason and purpose behind all this. There is no need to justify anything, that's impossible, that's not what I'm arguing here. I'm arguing the character's motives. Having a complete understanding of the character is all that matters to me.

Rushed and not developed to full extent? Sure. But saying it's out of nowhere and doesn't make any sense? I'm sorry, I beg to differ. 

Thank you for reading.",41,29,False,spoiler,,,,,

The directors chose to omit the green eyes part from the series and fans(including myself) are longing to know the answer. Here is my interesting take on the subject.

Arya travels west of Westeros and lands in England, where she hears of a Harry Potter, First of his name, Slayer of Dark Lord, First Order of Merlin, Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards , Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, Owner of the Deathly Hallows, bearer of his Mothers eyes.

Harry potter, owner of the deathly hallows, gets possessed by his fame and power (unlike Dumbledore predicted) and becomes Lord of Light for the purpose of greater good. He conducts the whole Song of Ice and Fire and when Arya comes to know of this, she gets infuriated and she shuts them green eyes.",15,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

1993,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2019-6-7,2019,6,7,1,bxir03,self.gameofthrones,[SPOILERS] The Great Council of 305 AC,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bxir03/spoilers_the_great_council_of_305_ac/,MaegorBrightflame,1559838622,"* These are my own musings, headcannons, and objections to the attendants to the Great Council of 305 AC. I linked some images of the more obscure characters.
* **Lord** [Hoster Tully](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/a/a3/Hoster_Tully.png/revision/latest?cb=20140615193244) is the real winner in all this. Though he is dead and gone, five of his descendants are seated on this Great Council, one of which is selected as the new king of six of the seven kingdoms. The seventh kingdom (the North) is now ruled by his granddaughter Queen Sansa Stark.
   * Sansa Stark, the Lady of Winterfell, is able to annex the entire North from the rest of realm and establish a new self-ruling monarchial government. Some fans have suggested that the council is stacked with Northmen by her own design; possibly to speak on Jon Snows behalf specifically. Fortunately, when Tyrion suggests that they select a new king, the council remains composed of those who would vote in her favor, allowing her to press her claim for independence.
   * **Arya Stark** has no reason to be here. She is a great hero to be sure and is noble born, but she holds no lands or titles.
   * **Brandon Stark** is arguably the Lord of Winterfell by all traditional laws of the realm. However, he has abdicated on several occasions, claiming that he is no longer Brandon Stark. He may be on the council nominally. Perhaps some lords still see him as the proper overlord of the North.
   * **Lord** [Edmure Tully](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/1/12/EdmureInfobox.PNG/revision/latest?cb=20190520033037) (presumed Lord Paramount of the Trident now that he is free again and that the Freys are all dead) was last seen handing over Riverrun to Ser Jaime Lannister and the Lannister forces. As a prisoner of war, he was likely held hostage in the Westerlands (his book counterpart is on the road and is meant to be held hostage at Casterly Rock). Though a large portion of the Western army was destroyed in dragon fire, Edmure remains a valuable hostage to whomever holds him. Perhaps he was freed to leverage a peaceful resolution for the other Western lords who wished to end the bloody wars.
   * [Robin Arryn](https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/files/styles/1200x680/public/2019/05/robin-arryn.jpg), Lord of the Eyrie, Warden of the East and Defender of the Vale, is the likeliest attendant for the council. He is clearly the undisputed holder of his titles, lands and station.
* Other notables:
   * Queen [Yara Greyjoy](https://www.hbo.com/content/dam/hbodata/series/game-of-thrones/character/s5/yara-greyjoy-1920.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1200.675.jpeg) liberated the Iron Islands from her uncles forces with no help from any other great house, was allowed to succeed and form her own queendom by Queen Daenerys Targaryen, but for some reason is eager to rejoin the realm and supports Brandon Starks claimok.
   * Lord Gendry Baratheons presence at this council is understandable if we accept that he had little issue pressing his claim on the Stormlands which was awarded to him by a Queen that was not recognized by the entirety of the realm and has recently died.
   * **Grey Worm**, as the Master of War to Queen Daenerys Targaryen, holds a great deal of power going into this council. Though he is a foreigner and holds no lands, he has an important title and is likely ruling Kingslanding and the greater Crownlands as a military state.
   * [Yohn Royce](http://i.imgur.com/v8azNoE.jpg), Lord of Runestone, is not the greatest lord in the mix, but he is a lord and past Great Councils were attended by lords great and small alike. Also, since Lord Petyr Baelishs death, Royce is likely acting as Regent and Defender of the Vale to Lord Robin Arryn.
* Some headscratchers:
   * **Tyrion Lannister** is a prisoner in attendance who is meant to provide some sort of testimony in regards to Daeneryss death and Jon Snows fate. He holds no lands or titles (he resigned as Hand of the Queen). Some fans think that he is the de facto overlord of the Westerlands because all other Lannisters are dead, but, simply stated, he has no way to press this claim and has not been in contact with anyone in the West that could rally support. In my opinion, he is not meant to be the Westerland representative; hes a prisoner.
   * **Samwell Tarly** is a brother of the now aimless and crippled Nights Watch and a maester in training. He is a known oathbreaker and renouncer of his Tarly lands and titles. Some fans have claimed that with the Reach is disarray, the Tyrells and Tarlys suffering heavy losses, Samwell is the acting representative. However, I find it more likely that he was invited out of courtesy due to his labors and his integral research in recent years. If a Tarly representative was needed, Samwells sister, Talla, is the rightful ruler of Hornhill now that Dickon and Randyll are dead.
   * Ser **Brienne of Tarth** holds no lands or lofty titles. She may in fact be the heir to her father Lord Selwyn of Tarth of Evanfall Hall, but she does not seem to be interested returning to her fathers hall. As far as we know, she is the sworn shield of Lady Sansa Stark and that is all. So why is she here?
   * Ser **Davos Seaworth** is the former Hand of the now dead King Stannis Baratheon, a seasoned battle commander, and holder of no lands (in the books, he has a small holding where is wife and several children still live) or lofty titles. He was born and bred in Fleabottom; his father was a crabber; and, as young man, he was a smuggler. Why is he here?
* Randos:
   * The new [Prince of Dorne](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/a/ae/Index.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/321?cb=20190520061131) is present. He was mentioned as gaining control over Dorne in a previous episode with no further explanation. We know that he is a Martell because of the Sun motif on his clothing. Some people have suggested that he is a younger brother of Doran and Oberyn, but I personally dont like when the show makes up characters. There is a Martell cousin in the books named **Manfrey Martell** who is an essential member of Dorans household and is a likely candidate for me.
   * Lord [Une](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/7/70/Lord_Une.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20190520210826) of the Stormlands, as he is named by the actor that portrayed him, is not a character in the books. He is dressed in some pretty generic costuming, that skews more towards the North, or even the Vale, than of the Stormlands. He is seated next to Gendry, so Im inclined to believe the actors claims. If I had to guess what house he belongs to, I would say **Estermont**, which is Gendrys only remaining noble kin in the Stormlands.
   * [Lord someone](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/c/cc/806_Vale_Lord.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20190520210046): he is clearly a large man with seemingly northern stylings. His coat looks similar to what Lord [Wyman Manderly](http://assets2.ignimgs.com/2016/06/27/manderlyjpg-19aba41280wjpg-4854ed_1280w.jpg) was wearing in season six. Some fans assume that he is in fact a **Manderly of White Harbor**, which works just fine for me. He is seated next to two Vale lords which in terms of geographical proximity they could have sailed into Kingslanding together. The problem with him being a Manderly is that in season six Lord Wyman Manderly made an appearance, portrayed by a different actor. Perhaps this is a recast or a different Manderly or someone else entirely.
   * [Lord someone else](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/4a/806_Riverlands_Lord.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20190520205944): Many fans believe this is Lord [Howland Reed](https://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Howland-reed-ned-stark-1312019.jpg) of Greywater Watch based mostly on wishful thinking and the cloth draped around his neck. In the Tower of Joy flashback, Howland wore something similar but not the same. In the flashback, it looks textured and scaly like other crannogmen clothes. I do not think Howland is at the council. More likely, based on his armors similarities to the Cleganes and Podrick Paynes, I think he is from the Westerlands and the sole representative from the West. My headcannon is that he was holding Lord Edmure Tully hostage for his Lannister overlords, and when the Lannisters got wiped out he became the de facto voice of the West. If I had to guess what house hes from I would say **Marbrand**; theyre important in the books and close to the Lannisters...or he could also be another river lord, I guess.
   * [Lord this guy](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/2/20/806_Northern_Lord.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20190520205902): This guy is clearly a northerner. His clothes and armaments resemble those worn by Stark noble men. If I had to guess, I would say he is a **Cerwyn**. The Cerwyns are the closest geographically to the Starks which would account for their similar stylings. Also, they are mentioned by the Boltons in a previous season so we know that they exist in the show.",49,18,False,spoiler,,,,,

HOW DO THEY STOP THE ZOMBIE DRAGON?

DO JON AND DANY HAVE AN INBRED 12 TOED BABY?

DOES JON EVER GET A FLAME SWORD? THAT WOULD BE COOL

DOES OTHER BRAN EVER GET HIS CASTLE AND 72 VIRGINS?

DOES JAIME GROW A NEW HAND?

DOES CERSEI EVER GET THE SALT OUT OF HER CUNT?

DOES TYRION GROW TALLER? 

HOW THE FUCK DO THEY STOP THE ARMY OF DEAD MOTHERFUCKERS? FUCK

EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE FUCKED CURRENTLY AS OF S7 E6. 

I'm going to let the show answer all of these for me. Hopefully it isn't shit. Like I said, I'm not very picky. If I make a post hating on it, then you know it's terrible steaming horse shit. There aren't many things I hate enough to post about it. Besides Cersei herself.",28,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

I hope everyone is doing great and searching for a new TV show to watch after GoT.

This post may be irrelevant to the series, but at the same time it touches something important in the world of Westeros.

Game of Thrones combined the best things that I could ask for and they are the medieval era, ancient nobles houses, wars and fantasy creatures. When I speak about the houses and family names, I can still see till this very day that this subject is very sensitive and something important to others.

For example, in the Arab world, some families keep trace of their root and a family tree of their house. They hold the family name and it is something very sacred to them, so the people can recognize you and know from where you came from. It even helps much when it comes to marriage. Families origins belong to a tribe and that tribe have a past conflict with another tribe, therefore a marriage is something impossible between them. It is something very important to keep trace of your family members and have a family tree in your grand house like your grandfather's. With time, people will know who you are and they will respect you, because your family holds an old heritage and possibly many great foundations that your ancestors were able to accomplish. These things help to build your family reputation and in so gain the respect you want in your country. Some families have a very ancient root back to the foundation of the country and therefore they could marry royalties, because they helped built their country. I am not sure about the sigil thing like GoT, because in the Arab world I don't see logos that represent this family other than the family name itself.

I think this is a really vast subject and I only spoke about the Arabs. You should know that not all Arab countries do this. Some people don't even know from where they came from and don't even have a family name. They just marry whoever they want and that's it. No family trace nor a family tree. Some of those people have bad origins that they tend to hide from it.

The point is, how many of you still follow this ancient way and have a famous family name in your country that people could know immediately when hearing your full name? Do you believe that descent is something crucial and you would not want to marry or let your family marry family without knowing their descent? Do you have a huge family tree you would like to share with us or perhaps a old heritage?

I know this maybe a sensitive subject to some of you, but I want to know which countries still do this in our current time?",16,0,False,self,,,,,

I mean this man came back from the dead and living people have no idea whatever the hell he had to encounter. By then he grew so tired and depressed from people's bullshits that the first mentionable thing he does after his resurrection is quitting nights watch whereas the watch was his family. He grew grumpier  the show progressed. You can blame this as just poor writing but i think facing death had a vital role in his behavior. I think the writers could have explored some particular notion of his experiences gradually. But as they didnt, when Tyrion asks Jon how its like to die in s08e06, it feels so out of place. Even if Jon really experienced some mysterious things, exposing them at such an eleventh hour would totally ruin the mood so the writers couldnt even do that then even if they wanted to.

Since last wednesday HBO uk have been posting all kinds of strange Game of Thrones related stuff on Twitter, seemingly random, but always with a strange nod. Implying the Night King is not dead for one. Below are most of the social media posts on GOT over the last weeks. I first believed there was more to come, then it didnt happen the week after and I thought I was wrong, afterwards I didnt want to get my hopes up again, but saw more clues. Now I just can't unsee all the now very real clues anymore. Its real, its going to happen. Here's why


Twitter:
- GIF of Dany, caption about being a proud Dany fan
- GIF of Arya killing NK, 'In Arya we trust', june 5th
- GIF of Dany &amp; Cercei, 'Lets discuss shame levels', june 4th
- GIF of Yara &amp; Theon, caption 'The family that headbutt each other then help eachother up stays together', june 3rd
- Retweeted (BY HBO!) In response to someone tweeting 'What can I watch hoe Game of Thrones is done': 'Big little lies *grin*, june 2nd.
- GIF of Dany and Cercei, caption 'me vs my insomnia', june 1st
- GIF of Bran and the NK, caption 'He came he saw, he ermm', may 31st 
-Even before this they have replied to Game of Thrones tweets and its ending with 'Big Little Lies' Its a Big Little lie that its done. But this is not all

Instagram:
The GOT Instagram page hasnt posted about the finale until one and a half week later, which is already odd. You would expect them to post finale related things, interviews now that its done, reactions to the finale, anything, but they didnt. Then a couple days later they posted another 3 and then another 3. Now, when you look at the page, it shows Bran in the middle of everything related to episode 6, all photos edited with a blurry white smoky filter and this is the clue. It looks like Bran is the mastermind behind it all.

Then comes the HBO Instagram page posting a short video with things to watch in june, starting with GOT the last watch shots with the words: One last watch, but more drama. This may seem like just a way to promote the documentary, but why, at this point, would they promote the documentary and not the series? Because there is ONE LAST WATCH. With more drama.

Aside from all this: all the actors are being secretive. None of them have really spoken out, and this is why. There are interviews, but only really short ones with very specific questions, and most of them are released through the official channels. Let me tell you this. When a show like this ends, all the actors get offers to appear on ALL the big talkshows like Ellen, Late Late Show, so on. None of them have done this. The only one that seems to have some more freedom presswise is Sophie, and thats because she has Dark Phoenix presswork to do. 

The producers also havent given any interviews. This is also not-done in the world of television. It is announced however that D&amp;D will be celebrated at the Emmys and will get an Founders Emmy Awards. Releasing the last episodes this month (deadline june 30) will make them the absolute number 1 candidate for almost every Emmy, the award show they have missed out on in previous years due to when the seasons aired. 

You will probably think: why do it this way? Why a secret episode?

Well.. basically every theory for the ending was out there. YouTube, Reddit, every possible ending was discussed. With this ending all the theorizing died out.

It made us angry, it made us look at the whole story and realise the plotholes in the given ending. It made me rewatch some things to get the story clear. It made me all the more sure this is not the end yet. By doing it this way people will actually be surprised. 

*************

What I think will happen: Dany is brought back to life nu Kinvara in Volantis. Arya finds out about the 3ER, who he is, what he can do (and what he could have done to save millions or lives), and what he has done to manipulate all major events throughout the story. 

I feel like we havent had a true Ice and Fire scene yet, except for a very badly lit not so Long Night. And that long winter was seemingly gone in a week or so. I don't think the WW's are truely gone, and Jon wil found out more about them beyond the wall. There were white walker babies that we have never seen again after all.

It seemed pretty warm in KL at the Last War, when winter has already came. Yet 2 weeks later (after Bran arrives) when when Jon stabs Dany, it is full on snowing and a tiny snowflake lands on her cheek and melts. It seems odd. Of makes me wonder if the *final* ending will actually be Bran = Night King, after Arya stabs him.

Anyhow, I don't know the contents of what is going to happen, but I am pretty sure out One Last Watch is coming. Hopefully this sunday.

Nothing wrapped up as neatly as we anticipated, but for a show that made its name upending television tropes and keeping viewers off balance, there was something extremely poetic about the series ending with Jon growing into the roles of the three characters that had the most influence in shaping the man he became. He maintained his honor and ethics like Ned, regardless of his true parentage, reassumed his role as the key protector of the realm, following in the footsteps laid by Lord Mormont before him, and by slaying Daenerys, freed the people of the 7 (now 6) kingdoms from another potential tyrannous reign in way that would make Mance Rayder smile from the other side. Despite being the easy choice for King in most eyes, the character is subjected to a fate equivalent to Master Aemons, except in this case, Jon is able to see both death and life in its most vibrant forms, experience the burden of kingship first hand, but is ultimately condemned to a future where he is unable to speak of it to anyone beyond the wall, completing his character arc with the same renown he possessed as the bastard boy we met in Winterfell. 

Not for nothing, its worth mentioning that Jon ended up being both more honorable and battle tested than Ned, but will share in none of the accolades befitting a man of his experience and essentially end the Targereyan lineage with his dying breath.",2,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

So completely rushed and so many nonsensical moments. As a very big fan, it was really sad to witness. The worst thing about the final season however, is not that it was bad in itself, but that it retroactively makes the WHOLE show worse. Before season 8 came out, I was planning on rewatching the entire series from start to finish this summer vacation, but now I just.. don't have the desire to do so anymore. Season 8 makes so, so many plotlines entirely useless.

* The White walkers. This plotline is definitely the one that suffered the most. Introduced in the prologue to the entire show, and always hyped up to be THE supernatural main threat, they were just laughably easy defeated. How can you still be invested in this plotline, when you know the white walkers will all die without bringing about the mythical 'Long Night', without even properly getting into Westeros?
* Jon's Targaryen heritage.. I'm not saying he should have ended up as the King in the end, but him being a Targaryen should have had SOME impact, aside from turning Daenerys mad. How can you still get goosebumps during the 'cut from Baby Jon to grown up Jon' in the 'Winds of Winter', knowing his Targaryen heritage and general arc will lead to nothing? Or his epic stare-down with the Night King in Hardome, which also lead to absolutely nothing..
* The endings for Jaime, Daenerys, Bran, etc.. will also lessen the impact of their storylines. Is Jaime's redemption storyline going to be as good during a rewatch, knowing he will just end up with Cersei in the end and die with her? Is watching Daenerys trying to be a good ruler in Mereen for 3 seasons going to be interesting again, knowing she will die as a cartoon villain after destroying King's Landing? And what even is the point of Bran's storyline, if you know he will end up doing literally nothing (and being proclaimed King doesn't really count, because that has never even once been foreshadowed).

&amp;#x200B;

There are many more examples, but these are to my mind the biggest ones. And I'm really not bashing on the show, I love this series so much. But I can't shake the feeling that season 8 retroactively ruined a lot of the show.. I will certainly rewatch it again sometime in the future, but I fear it will never be the same again, and not in a good way..",250,524,False,spoiler,,,,,

In this episode, Dwight is able to solve the murder mystery by employing a unique tactic. Heres the quote from the episode:

I know she didn't do it. It's never the person you most suspect. It's also never the person you least suspect, since anyone with half a brain would suspect them the most. Therefore I know the killer to be Phyllis, AKA Beatrix Bourbon, the person I most medium suspect.

How does this effect Game of Thrones? Well, who is the person we most medium suspect to be on the Iron Throne? My bet is on Daenerys Targaryen. In the beginning of the season the person I most suspected would be Jon Snow. Hes noble and doesnt want to be a king. Varys even said the perfect person to rule is someone who doesnt want to. 

The person who I least suspected was Cersei. Theres no way anyone would ever stop fighting until she was dethroned. The game would never end. 

But now Dany has shown her true colors. And though it would be great for our boy Jon to take charge and become the ruler of the 7 kingdoms, he is too much of Ned Starks son. He will probably try to take the throne and fail. I believe that the final episode will end with Jon being executed by beheading just as Ned was before him. Dany will finally sit upon the iron throne, but she will not be happy. In fact no one in the kingdom will be happy. As is said in War Games/Tron Legacy the only way to win is not to play",2,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Meera was screaming hold the door. Not bran. 

I dont get it. I just dont. Bran went back and watched many others- no one else has a seizure. Why hodor?  He was holding the door in the future, on his own will- why should that have affected him in the past?

So as I know we already know that the world is round and that theres 4 known continents 
-Westeros 
-Essos
-Ulthos
- sothoryos

We dont know much about sothoryos or ulthos or very far north (Westeros) And very far south (Essos)

So my theory is that Essos and Westeros by a massive land bridge at the top of the lands of always winter and Far East 

In the east near  Yi Ti theres a place called the the five forts that was used to keep the demons out similar to the wall 
Idea is that the white walkers originally went east first then south

This was my first time ever even seeing it.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bxq3f9/spoilers_finished_the_entire_show_from_start_to/,drunksouls69,1559879510,"Well, my new list of favorite shows(excluding anime) now goes like this:

Vikings
Game of Thrones.
Breaking Bad.
Weeds.
Dexter.

So, as you can see, I really fuckin liked it. It was orgasmic. I nutted a total of 87 times during my binge watch.

I can see why people fanboi'd over it for so long. It really is great. It has flaws, but it's still the second best show ever made in my book. Speaking of books, I will be reading ASOIAF. Are the books good ? How different are they?

Anyway, this show did an amazing job at making me love characters and then ripping them away abruptly (rip robb and big papa ned). And it also made me hate several characters that just wouldn't fucking die (yeah Cersei you fucking dusty bitch). I do think it's amazing that this show could make me hate characters as much as I hated Cersei. She was on my hit list ever since she had that doggo killed.

Season 7 and 8 were NOT BAD AT ALL besides the last 3 episodes feeling like a different show in truth. The last 3 of season 8 are literally my only gripes. They just didn't feel like the same show.  The ending however, it was cute, but also not satisfying at all. John should have either died, or had a fairy tale ending (becomes king ect). It is poetic how he got sent back to the wall, but what is there to fight beyond the wall now ? I wonder how long he will even be necessary there as well as the Night's Watch itself.  John deserved to be a martyr, or to be a hero. The nights watch thing just isn't satisfying and it's utterly pointless.

Why did Bran the Broken become king ? Throughout the entire show he barely got any screen time and his character arc was really shit and I never knew why he was doing what he was doing.  All I got from the show is that he can see all events from any time. I don't know why he went north and did all that dumb shit. Then at the end it's like ""surprise the rightful King has to go defend a wall that doesn't need defending and this cripple kid is the king now. Oh yeah and here's a big bag of dicks for you to munch on. Thanks for watching."" Tyrion and all the rest had good endings though. I'm sure they'll make a better kingdom.

Honestly, I wanted Dani to die. I knew that bitch was crazy since season 2. She was so entitled and thought she owned every one and every thing. She had an attitude like "" I am the rightful queen of your ballsack and all the ballsacks of the 7 kingdoms. Submit to me."" When she burned the entire city that was when I really knew she had to go. She can't be going into Hitler mode like that. Most people were blinded by her looks and wanted her to be queen, but I knew better. She was just another crazy white girl. And I'm a way bigger fan of Dornish women anyway.

The whole battle with the dead seemed really rushed, but it was still fantastic. It felt hopeless, like there was no way they could win. I had it spoiled for me, I knew they won, but during the battle I could not find any conceivable way the living could win. They did a good job. That shit was gritty. Like a battle should be.

I was very pleased when Ramsay Bolton and Cersei died. I hated those two the most. Cersei got it too easy though. Her death was much too quick. 

Sandor Clegane was one of my favorites. He was a big tough cunt. But he was a big tough cunt with a heart deep down. 

Lady brienne was cool as fuck too. Most shows don't aknowlege the fact that sometimes women are born very big and strong like men. It's rare but it does happen. I thought the whole concept of her was cool. She was probably one of the best fighters in the show.

Jon Snow is one of my favorite characters in any media. He had such honor it's almost unheard of. It's an unrealistic amount of morality, but I liked that. He knew how to sell it and own it. I wanted to see so much more for him in the end, but nope. The writers gave me a bag of dicks instead. 

I loved Tyrion and Bron. They were very high up on my loved characters list. Especially Bron. That dude was funny as fuck. Bron was a greasy bastard but I couldn't help it I loved him. Tyrion was hilarious and turned out to be a really good person. I wouldn't have guessed that in the beginning. They both got good endings so I'm satisfied with them.

I want to see the story continued but instead of westeros, it takes place on the other side of the world that we haven't seen. Over in eastern Essos. Or maybe that continent Ulthos. So much mystery with those areas.

Overall, this show was amazing and I want more. They need to spend another decade on another show in this universe so I can binge watch it 10 years from now.",16,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Before the end of season 6 she  hasn't exactly been trying to take the iron throne for herself.  Later on she does get revenge on those who killed her children but that only occurs because of her war with Dany and not really through her own planning. Furthermore, it is only revealed later on after she is queen that she is pregnant, so that isn't the reason she takes the iron throne. 

I think one of the main reasons this sort of ending for Cersei would work is due to the fact that she mentions earlier in the story that her children are the only reason she doesn't kill herself (I think she says this to Ned maybe).  I also think it would have made the scene even more epic if she was in the sept. We could have had the High Sparrow look at her and realise she's crazy just before the sept explodes.

The show had become mainly just spectacle, something to talk about at the office, which is probably why episodes 1 and 2 were rated well enough. From the perspective of a casual viewer, there wasn't really anything wrong.

But episode 3 came along and suddenly *everyone* had a united complaint. It was the biggest episode of the series thus far, and no one could see a damn thing. They were confused, because characters that looked like they were surely dead were fine the next scene. Worse yet, it kept happening.

Suddenly people have something to talk about that they can all agree on. And it's something negative. The poor lighting of episode 3 and confusing did-they/didn't-they death scenes was a gateway to further complaints. It was so bad that it made the news, Saturday Night Live even parodied it. Their complaints were shut down by people working on the show, telling them that it was probably their fault for not setting their TVs up right. If they googled or youtubed to find out information on what happened in episode 3, they were subjected to people ripping apart the plot and laying all it's flaws bare. For the casual viewer it became more fun to make jokes about the show than to discuss the spectacle of it in that one episode.

David and Dan revealed on the season 4 DVD commentary that they stopped having as many King's Landing garden scenes when South Park parodied all the scenes set in it. They seemed to be sensitive to the public mocking their writing.

Maybe if the viewers hadn't handwaved so many of the problems of earlier seasons they might have been forced to actually try, they seemed to think that people would eat no matter what they were served by the end.",44,10,False,spoiler,,,,,

If they had Cersei hold Meissande hostage at the Red Keep while Dany was burning down the scorpions on the castle walls. After Dany takes the entire city with zero casualties,  we hear the bells ring and the people accept defeat. But Dany sees Cersei in her tower and although Cersei agrees to the surrender, she also commands The Mountain to bring Meissande up next to her in the window for Dany to see her order the Mountain to cut Meissande's head off. Cersei does this as a final blow to Dany because she feels that even if she loses her life and the kingdom, she can at least stick it to Dany real good one last time. Little would she know, THAT would be the reason Dany flips. Since the showrunners wanted the season to end in 6 episodes, this woulda been sufficient enough to plausibly trigger ""the madness"" with everything else considered. Cersei takes the last of Dany's true friends right in front of her, and so Dany takes the only thing left that gave Cersei a feeling of power; the city she ruled over (even if it means fucking her own reign over). Like we'd literally see it as an impulse decision. Maybe even have the scene where Jon confronts her show that Dany herself was kinda shocked by what she did, but that she didn't think she'd have it in her to do it again because in that instance she was pushed by Cersei. 

&amp;#x200B;

By doing this, Jon's choice becomes more than just ""do I kill my queen or not?"" It becomes ""my queen fucked up in a BIG way, but she's aware of it and apparently there's a chance it'll never happen again... but do I potentially risk more atrocities against innocent lives for this one person that I love?"" But duty is the death of love, and he remains the shield that guards the realms of men. I feel this would add more weight to Jon killing Dany.

It then does nothing for the rest of the season, which was a mistake imo.   


So events in the season play out the same, up until Arya and Jon meet in Kings Landing. Arya tells Jon, he has to kill Daenerys. Arya then gives Jon Catspaw. Arya knows Daenerys no longer trusts Jon and would definitely not let him come near him without armour on and without Jon's weapons removed. So Jon arrives at the red keep, gives up his weapons to Grey Worm, but Keeps Catspaw. He has it hidden under the coat Sansa made him. The scene with Dany plays out the same, Jon stabs her then Drogon flies in before Jon can retrive the dagger. Drogon flies off with Dany and Grey-Worm and his troops burst into the room and capture Jon. They aren't sure Jon killed Daenerys but Grey-Worm is positive it was him. So Jon gets thrown in the black cells anyway.   


The episode plays out normally until the very end. As Jon rides into the forest the camera pans over mountains, rivers, lakes until it reaches a place hundreds of miles North.

She lacked many important principles of leadership, but I will go over three.    


\----

Firstly - A Great Leader Serves Their People  
She didn't do this.    
She ""tried to"", but for the most part leaned more towards her ego and pride than the people she was claiming to help.   
Effective leaders will focus on the goals of their subjects- and show them how those goals line up with their own goals.   
This creates a win-win situation.   
This dynamic should occur first with the tier of company directly under you.   
Then spread to the tier directly under that tier.   
And so on and so forth until the entire army is aligned with the leader's goals.  

  
\----

Secondly - A Great Leader Embraces The Wisdom of Experts  
It's important to surround yourself with subjects smarter than you.   
And not just that- but actually listen to them!  
When Danny listens to her council, she excels.    
When she ignores them, her influence suffers greatly.   
Ignoring your council also defeats the point of even having the council!  

  
\----

Thirdly - A Great Leader Genuinely Embraces Their Subjects For Who They Are  
An important part of leading is connecting with your subjects.   
Building that rapport with your subjects.   
Trust is established by embracing who your subjects are... what they represent.    
A stark example of Danny not doing this is when she's talking to Sansa.    
Sansa brings up her concerns about not wanting to be ruled by a single entity.    
How easy would it have been to say something like ""you know what?  Let me rule  
the 7 Kingdoms for one day, then you can rule the North.""    


That way, Danny knocks her goal off the bucket list, and Sansa gets to do what she wants.    
It's win-win.  I loved that Bran just let Sansa rule the North.  I was like - ""EXACTLY!""

But as I thought about it it makes perfectly sense.

During most of Westeros' history - even during most of the time we are shown in the series/books - there was no proof of  existence of any WW and I think it is fair to say, that even for most of the people in Westeros the WW where some creatures from the legendary ages and so they were only ""some kind of real"". I mean I always get the feeling that people do believe that the stories from that time are fact, but almost as it happened in another world or something. Nobody would REALLY believe that WW are real, unless they see them with their own eyes.

So, the Night's Watch always has been this institution, which is 'somehow' rooted in the legendary ages but most of all in Westeros' society, carried on by tradition to 'defend' the northern border (only border on land) of the Seven Kingdoms. But they never really had to protect anyone from the WW and as we have learned don't even have the power to do so. Their real purpose always has been to represent the territorial right of the North. 

Also the fact that criminals can get condemned to some kind off meaningful work at the Wall is also a nice side-effect for a society in which not every capital crime leads to death as punished, but which couldn't or wouldn't come up with the costs of lifelong imprisonment.

So all in all in a way the role of the Night's Watch as in institution in the society of Westeros hadn't really changed after all.",18,6,False,spoiler,,,,,

Like, what's the preferred ending you imagined?

A few weeks before it ended I had an idea for how I'd like to see it wrap up, so now I wonder if anybody else had ideas of their own, whether it contains twists and shock kills or not.

&amp;#x200B;

I won't try to reconcile the idea I had with all the other loose ends or anything, so pretend all of that work has already been done. But the ending I imagine would be somewhat of a happy ending fake out where it seems things are going to work out for the better. The final scenes would have a ""new beginning"" feel to it, that new exciting things are about to start. Maybe there'd be a feel-good shot of a dragon flying over the water in classical good ending fashion before the final scene, which will contain a simple fake-out. In this ending, Daenary's has the throne and have just had a bit of a meeting with her top men and her hand Tyrion. The meeting concludes and they are all leaving but Tyrion stays by the throne for a bit. So the fake-out is that you're lead to believe that ""the wheel"" is starting all over again as Tyrion looks to the throne and reaches out to touch the arm rest of the throne in a power hungry fashion. And that's where normally it would end, but instead Tyrion hears a ruckus. We see brief shots of Daenarys being stabbed to death by some knights in another corridor. A bunch of men with crossbows step into frame all at once, aiming straight for Tyrion. And the last shot of the entire series is a close up of Tyrions face with the last sound you hear is Tyrion inhaling sharply which then immediately cuts out to black and silence. And then the credits pop up, still no music for a good half minute or so.

In my opinion that's an ending that would do the better aspects of the shows justice and it'd be very reflective of the kind of ride the show has been. I imagine of course the whole season having been a bit different to build up towards these specifics so it's not so out of place.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone have any other cool twists and turns sort of endings in mind?",10,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

And at first you kind of think its a typical trope of someone putting telling someone something important off only to die before they had the chance or to just avoid having the talk at all but I believe Ned fully intended to tell Jon everything when they next met and it wasnt because they were short on time at the moment.

If Ned lives the next time he sees Jon, Jon will have taken the black. And by then it wont matter that hes a Targaryen(surely it was known to some that Maester Aemon was) so he will be free to tell Jon who he really is without it risking throwing the realm into civil war and making things super awkward between him and Robert.

It seems to even be foreshadowed in the books. 

[Bran foreshadowing](https://imgur.com/a/TDxqasN)


People even seem to think he's evil? That's crazy. I didn't interpret it that way at ALL. Emotionless doesn't mean evil.

Here's my thoughts on him and why he is just a normal guy who can see all of time and not some evil plotter.

He knows everything. He says the things that get him to where he needs to go, cause he knows saying those things will get him exactly what he wants. He knew everything that would happen before it does. He knew this would be the outcome and that it was the way to get him to the throne. He knows that him being on the throne will be good for all the land, because he can see the future, so he continuously can do the right thing over and over again. Something no king has ever done before. 

If you knew everything do you still think you'd be the same you?

He is the least biased and most impartial king to ever sit on the throne. That's fact in my mind. 

And lastly I don't disagree with other complaints about Dany and everything in the last season, I've just always thought Bran would be king so that part just fit perfectly for me I guess. The rest of this season has been quite a bummer for me too. I'm hopeful for the last books.",19,6,False,spoiler,,,,,

Hey all! Here's the update to previous post I had made at the beginning of the series, where I asked people where they thought people of the Great Houses would end up. Here's the final tally of the Great Lords and Ladies of Westeros.

Legend: **^(P)** = pregnant, **\*** = assumed infertile,  ~~strikethrough~~: deceased at the end of the series

*Starks*: All three remaining Starks survived, although it was confirmed by Sansa in episode 6 that Bran is unable to have children due to his paralysis. However, because of Tyrion's new plan for the line of succession, Bran won't need an heir to take his place. Sansa was crowned Queen in the North and the North is now an independent kingdom. Because she is a monarch in her own right, her name will pass onto any children she might have, instead of that of her husband. Arya is still a noble lady, and if she chooses to marry and have kids, it is likely that she will still have to take her husband's name, as will her children. **House Stark: Extant**

*Lannister*: Cersei and Jaime died together in episode five, along with their unborn child. Tyrion is the only surviving Lannister of Casterly Rock, and is by default the Lord of the Westerlands and most likely Warden of the West as well. Any children he has will carry the Lannister name. **House Lannister: Extant**

*Targaryen*: Daenerys died in episode 6, by Jon's hand. As punishment, Jon is sent to the Wall to rejoin the Night's Watch. Men of the Night's swear a vow of chastity, and are forbidden to have children. However, it is unclear if Jon's trek north of the wall is to escort the wildings or to join them. It is possible for Jon to still have children, but it is unlikely that they would be given Targaryen surnames whether or not they were born Free Folk or Westerosi. Surnames are not commonly born north of the wall, and Jon will most likely not use the Targaryen name at all. If they are born in Westeros, any kids of Jon will be considered bastards since he can not legally marry. **House Targaryen: Extinct (by default)**

*Baratheon*: Gendry, the only surviving person with Baratheon blood and bastard son of King Robert, was legitimized in episode 6 by Daenerys as a reward for fighting in the Battle of Winterfell. He is now Lord of the Stormlands and of Storm's End. Although Daenerys was killed in episode 6, Gendry's legitimation still stands as he is present in the meeting of the Dragonpit at the end of the episode where the lords and ladies had convened. Any children he has through a marriage will carry the Baratheon name. **House Baratheon: Extant**

*Greyjoy*: Theon died in episode 3, protecting Bran from the Night King. He would not have been able to have children due to Ramsay's torture, but he was still a major part of House Greyjoy. Euron died in episode 5. It is unclear if the promise that Daenerys made to Yara in season 6 still stands, which would mean that Yara is Queen of the Iron Islands and can therefore pass on the Greyjoy name to her children as a queen in her own right. **House Greyjoy: Extant (conditionally)**

*Tully*: Edmure Tully is shown to be alive and freed in episode 6, and is Lord of the Riverlands after his father's death in season 3. His son by his wife Roslin Tully (nee Frey) is heir to Riverrun, and is most likely alive since no other information is given of him. **House Tully: Extant**

*Arryn*: Robin is alive in episode 6, and is Lord of the Vale, and most likely Warden of the East. It is unclear if Yohn Royce is acting as regent until Robin comes of age, or if he is old enough to rule on his own. Either way, he able to pass on the Arryn name to any future children. **House Arryn: Extant**

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for such a long post! But here is the fate of the Great Houses that were in power at the beginning of the series. Houses Martell and Tully are definitely gone, and the Targaryens most likely end with Jon.

Watching seasons 3 and 4 while having Dany and Jons relationship fresh in my mind is really eye opening. 

Jon and Ygrittes onscreen chemistry blows Jon and Danys out of the water. An obvious reason for this is they were falling in love off screen in real life. 

Its not even that Jon and Dany have bad chemistry overall, It just seems so absolutely one sided. I think Emilia Clarke totally killed It. It is evident on screen that she is infatuated with Jon. Yet Jons return affections seems so forced and awkward. 

For example when Ygritte is dying in Jons arms he puts his face to hers and cradles her in agony. When Dany was dead in Jons arms although he was distraught there was no actual physical affection he showed towards her. 

I wonder if It was because he struggled playing a role in which he was falling in love with another character, which he had only done one other time and ended up having a genuine connection with that person. 

Its honestly such a shame because I think It would have improved the season if this was nailed better. This whole series was built up for these two characters to come together and their whole love story side of It just wasnt very believable or genuine. The season being rushed prob has a lot to do with it and the fact that Jon barley has any lines this season, but damn in retrospect their whole love story really wasnt portrayed well on screen at all.",35,25,False,spoiler,,,,,

But what about Jon Snow? He wound up where he began. Jon makes his own callback to Maester Aemons [**Season 5, Episode 7** ](http://gameofthrones.com/game-of-thrones/season-5/episode-7)comment Love is the death of duty  a fitting one given Aemon was also a Targaryen who had no interest in the throne. But what about his sentence to return to the Nights Watch? It may have seemed like a slap in the face for a man who was once a king (and arguably the rightful heir to the Iron Throne), but actually [**Season 8, Episode 4**](http://gameofthrones.com/game-of-thrones/season-8/episode-4) hinted at what was to come. As Jon bids farewell to his closest friends, he asks Tormund to bring Ghost beyond the Wall with him:

***Jon Snow:*** *Hell be happier up there.*

***Tormund:*** *So would you.*

***Jon Snow:*** *I wish I was going with you.*

***Tormund:*** *Youve got the North in you. The real North.*

**The scene is simple enough not to immediately remember while watching the final episode, but it bears repeating once youve seen Jon riding into the forest among the wildlings  where he always belonged.**

The last line is confirmation. So can we finally come to a consensus on this? He is no longer with the NW. He is with the wildlings. Why hasnt this article got any attention?",43,7,False,spoiler,,,,,

Learning of his fathers death, the adolescent, dashing and charismatic and descended from the old kings of the North, vows to avenge him. He is supported in this war by his mother, who has spirited away her two younger sons to safety. Against them is the queen, passionate, proud, and strong-willed and with more of the masculine virtues of the time than most men. She too is battling for the inheritance of her young son, not yet fully grown but already a sadist who takes delight in watching executions.

Sound familiar? It may read like the plot of *Game of Thrones*. Yet that was also the story of the bloodiest battle in British history, fought at the culmination of the War of the Roses. George RR Martins bestselling novels are rife with allusions, inspirations, and flat-out copies of real-life people, events, and places of medieval and Tudor England and Europe. The Red Wedding? Based on actual events in Scottish history. The poisoning of Joffrey Baratheon? Eerily similar to the death of William the Conquerors grandson. The Dothraki? Also known as Huns, Magyars, Turks, and Mongols.

Join Ed West, author of Skyhorses A Very, Very Short History of England series, as he explores all of Martins influences, from religion to war to powerful women. Instead of despairing while waiting for Season 8 of *Game of Thrones*, discover the real history behind the phenomenon and see for yourself that truth is stranger than fiction.

It is simple logic.

Instead, Danny would have suggested to attack King's Landing and finish off Cersei first, so she can take the Throne and force the Lannister army and all its ally armies to join her ONE big army to fight the dead and defend the Realm that she now RULES.

And so they decide to do.

Before the battle of King's Landing, Cersei sends an assassin to kill Danny. This assassin could have as well been Jaime, fill the blanks as you would. Anyways, the assassin fails to kill Danny but kills Missandei instead, infuriating Danny!

When Danny burns all the defenses of King's Landing with her dragon(s), and when the Lannister army surrenders, she is content for a second that she has finally won. But then she looks at the Red Keep, and remembers all the evil the Lannisters did to her family, and she decides to finish her off with a big BOOM! Danny, surely wouldn't kill the innocents in the street of King's Landing because those are her people now. But whoever is hiding between the walls of the Red Keep she decides that they are the enemy, the traitors!

Danny attacks the Red Keep and burns all who are in and around it. Jon and the rest are all frightened and broken by the brutality of Danny, but at least they understand why she is doing it.

Danny destroys the Red Keep entirely, breaking the wheel in some sense...

Triumphant, Danny makes a speech to gather all armies to go and face the Night King, the last threat of the Realm. All men must serve the ultimate queen.

On the way to Winterfell, many of the advisors of Danny are now afraid of her power and of her supremacy. Tyrion is surely broken by the loss of his siblings. Jon, being an honorable man, still cannot accept the fact of her killing the civilians between the walls of the Red Keep, and Jorah now sees that Danny is becoming more and more of a vicious person, with every day passed by.

Sansa welcomes the queen but defies her on several matters. Danny orders to imprison Sansa for her insolence until the fight with the dead is over, angering both Arya and Jon, but the queen must be obeyed.

The Night King arrives with his army to the doorsteps of Winterfell.

The fight begins. The Dothraki have no reason to attack blindly to their demise, so they hang back, waiting for the dead to push, so they may flank them from the sides as the dead push the fortified Unsullied. Fire traps go off everywhere as the living emphasize on using fire against the dead on every occasion. Still, the dead keep on advancing. The Unsullied defend bravely, but they start to lose formations. The Dothraki starts flanking the dead from the left and right, making powerful advances for a while, but then giant wights kill couple of top Dothraki officers in the most gory ways, spreading fear and doubt in the rest.

When both the Unsullied and the Dothraki become victims of the army of the dead, Danny attacks with her dragon. The rest of the armies push alongside the Unsullied and the Dothraki, balancing the fight for once. This is when the Night King attacks with his dragon, and engages in a fight with Danny and her dragon. Jon flies with his dragon to help Danny.

After some exciting aerial fights, the Night King and Jon have their dragons kill each other and they are both on the ground now. Danny's dragon is injured but still OK. Jon attacks the Night King. After a short skirmish, the Night King injures Jon badly. The Night King's skills are unmatched. Jorah attacks the Night King, but sadly, Jorah gets killed by the Night King as he stares with a smile at Danny.

Angered by another close person's death, Danny unleashes the fire of the dragon on the Night King, but she sees that the Night King has survived it!

Out of nowhere, Arya jumps from the back of the Night King, trying to stab him with her dagger. But the Night King catches her and throw her away in an instant. The dagger falls near the Night King.

After four attempts on the Night King, it becomes obvious to our heroes that the Night King is unstoppable. But a stubborn Danny unleashes the fire of Drogon on the Night King one more time. As she stares into the fire, she sees that the Night King, while engulfed by the fire, is immobilized. The Night King gets somehow frozen by the dragon fire.

Danny realizes at the moment what to do. She jumps down from the back of Drogon, gets closer to the Night King, picks up Arya's dagger, gets into the fire, and slowly approaches the Night King who looks straight into her eyes, as she looks into his. Everything gets slowed down. Danny and the Night King are engulfed in Drogon's fire. Danny raises the dagger, looks at the Night King. He looks at her, it feels like he is wanting it now to be all over. She stabs him in the heart slowly as he explodes into nothing.

Drogon stops breathing fire. All the dead fall to the ground. The battle is over.

In the aftermath party, Danny gives another speech. She reminds them of who she is and what she did. She freed slaves and killed their masters, she broke the wheel in many occasions and in many different cities. She freed King's Landing from the tyrant the Cersei was and at the top of all, she single handedly killed the Night King, the biggest evil facing the realm. No one else could do it, it had to be her.

Danny is now consumed by her own victories and who can blame her? She really was the Princess that was promised. She fulfilled the prophecy.

But men are wicked and her arrogance doesn't make it easier on them to let their wickedness go away.

With many plots going on to overthrow her in the background, Danny decides that Sansa must die as a punishment for her disobedience. Sansa finds herself in a similar situation as her father.

After losing all her close advisors, the only one that Danny trusts is Jon now, especially after finding out that he is Targaryen, and not a Stark. She tells Jon of her decision to kill Sansa. With all that was happening, all the plots and discussions with Tyrion and the rest, Jon decides that truly Danny has become an unstoppable and merciless queen, much more powerful than any other tyrant that have ever lived. While her intentions were mostly good, but such power should not be in the hands of one person.

Jon stabs his queen in the most shameful act of betrayal he could ever imagine he could do. He killed the person who saved them all.

Jon flees to the North, crazed by his betrayal. Only Ghost would accompany him where he goes.

As for the rest, meh, just fill the blanks :D",1,1,False,self,,,,,

Bran the Broken. 

In the ending of the series, Bran becomes King and implies he knew this would happen. Which means he either saw it in the future, or he is more manipulative than we thought.

Throughout the series, Bran has caused the death of many characters because he was crippled and needed someone to save him.

What if it is more than we previously anticipated.


I have actually seen a few theories about Bran and Daeneryss destruction of Kings landing.
One thing I noticed, is that while she was destroying kings landing 
##Her perspective is not explored

Bran controlling her or Drogon. Sounds extreme but maybe his goal was to become King, which is why he sent away Jon to the Nights watch and, if some theories are to be believed, controlled Drogon and/or Daenerys during her final moments, leading to the elimination of his two biggest threats to the throne. As for Sansa, he allowed the North to become an independent  nation. Not because they asked, but because they would rebel again once he became ruler.

Now his biggest threats are dead or exiled, with the exception of maybe Tyrion, who wouldnt really be a threat because everyone hated him.

As for motive, or what he has to gain from being king, I dont know maybe hes the actual night king or an embodiment of the writers? That part is hazy. Any ideas would be appreciated.

Anyway thats my interesting, albeit crazy, theory about why Bran is the cause for the largely negatively received ending of Game Of Thrones.",6,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

But go back to Mereen.  What was the reason she learned.  If she was gonna rule by conquest and fear she will need to set an extremely nasty tone.  And what's better than a giant human BBQ!

My take is that Arya just wanted to showed Sansa that she had the power to take her out if she wanted but was choosing not to do so, and also by handing her the knife at the end, demonstrating that she trusted Sansa not to hurt her either.

But it seemed like a very weird way of going about it...maybe Arya was also still testing her?

Wanted to hear what different takes people might have had, as was reading something earlier about Arya using the conversation to give Sansa ""coded messages"" and ""clues"" but I don't see much of that.",12,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

3. Danys mad queen storyline: I understood Dany going mad , she just lost her best friends and targa trans have a tendency to go mad, she was being betrayed, she no she couldnt win the war peacefully.
4. Tyrion is being dumb: Even smart people make mistakes, flawed characters are better than perfect ones.
5. Dany forgot the iron fleet: She didnt forget she was caught of guard, and the reason they couldnt shoot driving is because he was going full speed.

I was just thinking about the inconsistencies with Daenarys' character and the way she all of the sudden went crazy, and how I think they could have most likely set it up better.

So in Season 5 Episode 3, Tyrion and Varys are both in Braavos, where they witness a priestess for the Lord of light. Instead of brushing this off and Tyrion making his remark, I believe this priestess should have forseen a prophecy for Tyrion. (Keep in mind this is at the point of the story in which both varys and Tyrion are looking for a proper and rightful queen/king.) She walks up to him and tells him to follow her. She guides him to a flame and tells him to look in and asks what he sees. He says that he sees himself at the ruins of a massive city. He then states that this was done by the lover of a close friend of his. At the time, Tyrion would suspect this to be his sister, as she is the queen of the seven kingdoms. He believes she would be crazy enough to destroy all of Kings Landing if need be. This is coupled with the fact that one of his only close friends is Jaime, who loves a family member (Cersei). 

Now comes the real thing he saw in the fire. He stands at the streets of Kings Landing, completely in ruins. This has been done by Daenarys', who is the lover of Tyrion's now close friend, Jon Snow, or Aegon Targaryen, who is the used-to-be lover of Daenarys' Targaryen, his aunt. 

Idk, share your thoughts if interested, I just think it provides actual foreshadowing as to what is to come, instead of making a random jump like we got.",4,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Dora Stark: A Defense of the Finale

&amp;#x200B;

	Although some have criticized the final episode of Game of Thrones, asking why is Arya now Dora the Explorer? I believe the writers over at HBO were right to end the series with the young assassin turning her sights west-er than west.  In this brief text I shall put forth several reasons concerning how I think this was the proper choice for her character based on what fans have seen on the show and at times based on details from the Song of Ice and Fire book series. 

	For starters, much of  Aryas formative years have been spent traveling to some of the most impressive cities in the known world. First she travels south to Kings Landing a city literally built on Aegons command with the purpose of being the most impressive settlement in Westeros. While the show never specifically showed Arya spending a moment to bask in the beauty of The Great Sept of Baelor or Maegors Holdfast, such impressive structures would certainly emblazon themselves upon the memory of the young Stark as great marvels of construction, especially in a world with significantly less advanced building techniques than ours (excluding whatever power enabled medieval folks to raise the wall though that essentially took centuries so my point stands). In season 5, when Arya arrives in Braavos, we see both her in awe of the great titan guarding the harbors of the city, and directly afterwards, we see Arya smiling as she observes this new foreign culture of fish markets and bazaars. Furthermore, she lives in both of these internationally minded cities for a large portion of her formative years (approximately three seasons). Moreover, a huge amount of her assassin training was simply based on absorbing information, more specifically, absorbing information from sailors, pirates, bravos, and world travelers. This was primarily to keep herself informed on the events of the world and to learn of the citys goings on for possible assassinations, but when Jaqen asks what three things she learned each day, in the books at least, I seem to recall her describing the tales of sailors who boasted about the wondrous things they had witnessed around the world. Spending the two years of her life (from 14-16) in Braavos, Arya wouldve been in the perfect position to develop wanderlust. Of course we dont see her discuss or act on such feelings until the final events of the show because, she not only had to conceal her desire to travel from those who housed her in Braavos, she also felt extremely dedicated to taking revenge against those who had wronged her family. This passion of hers obviously took up the most of her concern but I reckon any child who grows up abroad during adolescence gains some sense of international curiosity along with a heaping helping of respect for the vastness of the world (to be fair this point is largely based on personal experience and not empirical data). Once her wish to avenge her fallen friends and family members is fulfilled, what other motivators does Arya have?

	I posit that Arya has always been portrayed as curious. First off, she displays an unwillingness to suppress her interests from the second scene of the show. As soon as we see this little medieval noble girl shooting an arrow Princess-Merida-style, we know that shes not someone to adhere to social conventions. She follows her interests wherever they lead, even when her parents, sister, and septa wish her to be more ladylike. I reckon the notion to pursue typically male interests like fighting and archery, in a society where women were told such activities were not to be of interest to them, demonstrates on some level a natural curiosity to not only question the status quo, but to try and stray from it as well. Later, in the 8th seasons seasons most uncomfortable sex scene, we hear Arya utter a very important line: I want to know what its like, before they (all expect to) die. Although, she often takes steps that seem to indicate little regard for her own life, (like running into the collapsing Red Keep or idk  straight up saying shes not planning to come back from Kings Landing) this line straight up shows us that she definitely cares about experiencing life to the fullest and enjoying herself before she dies. If this position doesnt sound to you like someone with wanderlust, I understand, but I would argue that this supports the notion that Aryas primary mechanism of deciding what to do is hedonistic in origin. Her main drive throughout the show, revenge, is completely rooted in following ones own desires, even their gravest, most primal drives. Her revenge is never portrayed to be based on duty such as Robbs, but entirely based in her gut reaction to the deaths of her family members. When you take a closer look at Aryas m.o. its kind of entirely based on doing whatever she wants. She doesnt operate based on duty to family, or faith, or any (assassins) creed. She is always just doing what she wants (much like the honey badger). When someone asks her to do something she doesnt want to, she says no thats not me. Who is this she then as which Arya sees herself? Well that brings me to my next point. 	

Arya is a badass and knows it. Shes not a lady, shes the new Nymeria! Fuck it, Nymerias the old her! And no i dont mean her wolf, Nymeria, I mean the princess, Nymeria of the Rhoyne, bringer of the Rhoynar people to Dorne.  Quick Fake-History Lesson: Way over in Essos, the Easterners version of the Mississippi is the expansive river, the Rhoyne. This river stretches all the way from Volantis to Norvos and is a huge vessel for trade. When the Valyrian Freehold conquorered the Rhoyne, reenacted Exodus: Gods and Kings (2014) Nymeria led her people to the promised land Moses style, while being a badass who leads troops in battle and kills suckers. In this series, however, the promised land is played by Dorne, . So later when Arya gets a dire wolf pup, she names it after the legendary queen which she read about during her youth. When Roose Bolton takes over Harrenhal, in the books, she says her name is Nymeria, or Nan for short. She also chooses Nymeria for the name of the boat she rode to Braavos when she and the kindly man discuss her false past. Arya is shown to idolize the famous Rhoynar princess and 100% has thought about herself as this generations Nymeria. Is it a coincidence that Aryas idol also decided to sail west of her home continent? Maybe yes, maybe no, but I doubt the similarity wouldve escaped Arya when she was brainstorming what to do with her life after killing the Night King. It was established as soon as she named  Needle that Arya, along with most if not all of George R. R. Martins characters, has a keen sense of poetic justice. (I would argue she demonstrates this again when she kills all the Freys in the same hall they killed her brother and mother, but that also may have just been the easiest way to kill all of them and getting away with it \\\_()\_/ )

	So while I begin to wrap up this long winded defense, I would like to take a moment to examine Aryas possible thought process during the end of season 8. Keeping in mind that all her motivation has been concerned with has been revenge, she is in an interesting position when it comes to what to do when she has no more revenge to take. Everyone who has wronged her is pretty dead by the end of season 8. Arya saves the world by killing the Night King, Dany finishes off the jerk Lannisters, and Arya already killed the Freys a hot minute ago. So there go all her past motivators. So what does she do now? Well Gendry is pretty much down for whatevs but Arya doesnt wanna be a lady. She may have killed Dany for being a lil too trigger-happy with her dragon-fire, but Jon beats her to it. I feel like it would be hard to not have PTSD after the battle of Winterfell so returning home doesnt seem like a great option (plus who wants to live in the cold North after experiencing the Southern warmth?). So now if Im Arya Im thinking what should I, a legendary badass, do what would Nymeria do? Nymeria was concerned with her peoples well being but Aryas people are well ruled now by the rest of her friends, family, and allies, so she doesnt have a huge obligation to hang around and help especially when she doesnt want to be a ruler. IMO she for sure considered going for a tour of the world as many nobles have done before, as Ive established I think it would be hard not for her to get a little wanderlust. But Aryas not one to leisurely go traipsing around the civilized world on vacation. Arya is a badass lady of action, and I suspect she agreed when the Hound told her that killing an enemy was the sweetest thing there is. Arya is certainly looking for new enemies. 

	Now she is a Stark which means her actions will be heavily influential if she were to go picking fights in the Free cities or other known international players. Even if she were to go pick fights in Essos, yeah she would most probably keep her identity hidden but theres always the slim chance something  goes wrong and she is found out. What could that mean for global politics if she kills an evil ruler in Volantis when she observes their disgusting use of slaves? A member of the Westerosi kingdoms ruling family killing those of another sovereign nation could potentially start a war. As impulsive as Arya is, she wouldnt put the lives of the small folk or especially the lives of those she loves in danger. She just saved everyones ass, shes not about to throw them back into danger. So what options does she have left. Operation West-er Than West is essentially the option that holds the most excitement, possibility of battle, and potential to satisfy her curiosity. Like she says, its where all the maps end. Who better to explore the New World  than the slayer of the Night King? Im sure many folks will say why not go to Sothoryos if she wants excitement, adventure, and all that?"" Well this is when I think her idolization of Nymeria comes into play. Yes, she couldve gone to explore Sothoryos, but like I said, I think she sees herself more as a Nymreia boating to the west kind of gal rather than a Jaeneria Baelarys the dragon rider flying South to Sothroyos kind of princess. That's the final deciding factor that pushes her sights west instead of south. Anyways, thats my whole thought process lemme know what you think!",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Dora Stark: A Defense of the Finale

&amp;#x200B;

Although some have criticized the final episode of Game of Thrones, asking why is Arya now Dora the Explorer? I believe the writers over at HBO were right to end the series with the young assassin turning her sights west-er than west. In this brief text I shall put forth several reasons concerning how I think this was the proper choice for her character based on what fans have seen on the show and at times based on details from the Song of Ice and Fire book series. 

For starters, much of Aryas formative years have been spent traveling to some of the most impressive cities in the known world. First she travels south to Kings Landing a city literally built on Aegons command with the purpose of being the most impressive settlement in Westeros. While the show never specifically showed Arya spending a moment to bask in the beauty of The Great Sept of Baelor or Maegors Holdfast, such impressive structures would certainly emblazon themselves upon the memory of the young Stark as great marvels of construction, especially in a world with significantly less advanced building techniques than ours (excluding whatever power enabled medieval folks to raise the wall though that essentially took centuries so my point stands). In season 5, when Arya arrives in Braavos, we see both her in awe of the great titan guarding the harbors of the city, and directly afterwards, we see Arya smiling as she observes this new foreign culture of fish markets and bazaars. Furthermore, she lives in both of these internationally minded cities for a large portion of her formative years (approximately three seasons). Moreover, a huge amount of her assassin training was simply based on absorbing information, more specifically, absorbing information from sailors, pirates, bravos, and world travelers. This was primarily to keep herself informed on the events of the world and to learn of the citys goings on for possible assassinations, but when Jaqen asks what three things she learned each day, in the books at least, I seem to recall her describing the tales of sailors who boasted about the wondrous things they had witnessed around the world. Spending the two years of her life (from 14-16) in Braavos, Arya wouldve been in the perfect position to develop wanderlust. Of course we dont see her discuss or act on such feelings until the final events of the show because, she not only had to conceal her desire to travel from those who housed her in Braavos, she also felt extremely dedicated to taking revenge against those who had wronged her family. This passion of hers obviously took up the most of her concern but I reckon any child who grows up abroad during adolescence gains some sense of international curiosity along with a heaping helping of respect for the vastness of the world (to be fair this point is largely based on personal experience and not empirical data). Once her wish to avenge her fallen friends and family members is fulfilled, what other motivators does Arya have?

I posit that Arya has always been portrayed as curious. First off, she displays an unwillingness to suppress her interests from the second scene of the show. As soon as we see this little medieval noble girl shooting an arrow Princess-Merida-style, we know that shes not someone to adhere to social conventions. She follows her interests wherever they lead, even when her parents, sister, and septa wish her to be more ladylike. I reckon the notion to pursue typically male interests like fighting and archery, in a society where women were told such activities were not to be of interest to them, demonstrates on some level a natural curiosity to not only question the status quo, but to try and stray from it as well. Later, in the 8th seasons seasons most uncomfortable sex scene, we hear Arya utter a very important line: I want to know what its like, before they (all expect to) die. Although, she often takes steps that seem to indicate little regard for her own life, (like running into the collapsing Red Keep or idk straight up saying shes not planning to come back from Kings Landing) this line straight up shows us that she definitely cares about experiencing life to the fullest and enjoying herself before she dies. If this position doesnt sound to you like someone with wanderlust, I understand, but I would argue that this supports the notion that Aryas primary mechanism of deciding what to do is hedonistic in origin. Her main drive throughout the show, revenge, is completely rooted in following ones own desires, even their gravest, most primal drives. Her revenge is never portrayed to be based on duty such as Robbs, but entirely based in her gut reaction to the deaths of her family members. When you take a closer look at Aryas m.o. its kind of entirely based on doing whatever she wants. She doesnt operate based on duty to family, or faith, or any (assassins) creed. She is always just doing what she wants (much like the honey badger). When someone asks her to do something she doesnt want to, she says no thats not me. Who is this she then as which Arya sees herself? Well that brings me to my next point.  Arya is a badass and knows it. Shes not a lady, shes the new Nymeria! Fuck it, Nymerias the old her! And no i dont mean her wolf, Nymeria, I mean the princess, Nymeria of the Rhoyne, bringer of the Rhoynar people to Dorne. Quick Fake-History Lesson: Way over in Essos, the Easterners version of the Mississippi is the expansive river, the Rhoyne. This river stretches all the way from Volantis to Norvos and is a huge vessel for trade. When the Valyrian Freehold conquorered the Rhoyne, reenacted Exodus: Gods and Kings (2014) Nymeria led her people to the promised land Moses style, while being a badass who leads troops in battle and kills suckers. In this series, however, the promised land is played by Dorne, . So later when Arya gets a dire wolf pup, she names it after the legendary queen which she read about during her youth. When Roose Bolton takes over Harrenhal, in the books, she says her name is Nymeria, or Nan for short. She also chooses Nymeria for the name of the boat she rode to Braavos when she and the kindly man discuss her false past. Arya is shown to idolize the famous Rhoynar princess and 100% has thought about herself as this generations Nymeria. Is it a coincidence that Aryas idol also decided to sail west of her home continent? Maybe yes, maybe no, but I doubt the similarity wouldve escaped Arya when she was brainstorming what to do with her life after killing the Night King. It was established as soon as she named Needle that Arya, along with most if not all of George R. R. Martins characters, has a keen sense of poetic justice. (I would argue she demonstrates this again when she kills all the Freys in the same hall they killed her brother and mother, but that also may have just been the easiest way to kill all of them and getting away with it \\\_()\_/ )

So while I begin to wrap up this long winded defense, I would like to take a moment to examine Aryas possible thought process during the end of season 8. Keeping in mind that all her motivation has been concerned with has been revenge, she is in an interesting position when it comes to what to do when she has no more revenge to take. Everyone who has wronged her is pretty dead by the end of season 8. Arya saves the world by killing the Night King, Dany finishes off the jerk Lannisters, and Arya already killed the Freys a hot minute ago. So there go all her past motivators. So what does she do now? Well Gendry is pretty much down for whatevs but Arya doesnt wanna be a lady. She may have killed Dany for being a lil too trigger-happy with her dragon-fire, but Jon beats her to it. I feel like it would be hard to not have PTSD after the battle of Winterfell so returning home doesnt seem like a great option (plus who wants to live in the cold North after experiencing the Southern warmth?). So now if Im Arya Im thinking what should I, a legendary badass, do what would Nymeria do? Nymeria was concerned with her peoples well being but Aryas people are well ruled now by the rest of her friends, family, and allies, so she doesnt have a huge obligation to hang around and help especially when she doesnt want to be a ruler. IMO she for sure considered going for a tour of the world as many nobles have done before, as Ive established I think it would be hard not for her to get a little wanderlust. But Aryas not one to leisurely go traipsing around the civilized world on vacation. Arya is a badass lady of action, and I suspect she agreed when the Hound told her that killing an enemy was the sweetest thing there is. Arya is certainly looking for new enemies. 

Now she is a Stark which means her actions will be heavily influential if she were to go picking fights in the Free cities or other known international players. Even if she were to go pick fights in Essos, yeah she would most probably keep her identity hidden but theres always the slim chance something goes wrong and she is found out. What could that mean for global politics if she kills an evil ruler in Volantis when she observes their disgusting use of slaves? A member of the Westerosi kingdoms ruling family killing those of another sovereign nation could potentially start a war. As impulsive as Arya is, she wouldnt put the lives of the small folk or especially the lives of those she loves in danger. She just saved everyones ass, shes not about to throw them back into danger. So what options does she have left. Operation West-er Than West is essentially the option that holds the most excitement, possibility of battle, and potential to satisfy her curiosity. Like she says, its where all the maps end. Who better to explore the New World than the slayer of the Night King? Im sure many folks will say why not go to Sothoryos if she wants excitement, adventure, and all that?"" Well this is when I think her idolization of Nymeria comes into play. Yes, she couldve gone to explore Sothoryos, but like I said, I think she sees herself more as a Nymreia boating to the west kind of gal rather than a Jaeneria Baelarys the dragon rider flying South to Sothroyos kind of princess. That's the final deciding factor that pushes her sights west instead of south. Anyways, thats my whole thought process lemme know what you think!",5,4,False,spoiler,,,,,
2658,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2019-6-9,2019,6,9,17,byictr,self.gameofthrones,An alternate ENDING the GOT fans would have enjoyed!,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/byictr/an_alternate_ending_the_got_fans_would_have/,robencom,1560070792,"Back in season 7, when they decided to capture a white walker and take it back to Cersei so she joins the fight against the dead, Danny should have said that Cersei would never join them, because by doing so she is making it sure that she will lose the throne for Danny as soon as the dead are defeated. It is simple logic.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead, Danny would have suggested to attack King's Landing and finish off Cersei first, so she can take the Throne and force the Lannister army and all its ally armies to join her ONE big army to fight the dead and defend the Realm that she now RULES.

&amp;#x200B;

And so they decide to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Before the battle of King's Landing, Cersei sends an assassin to kill Danny. This assassin could have as well been Jaime, fill the blanks as you would. Anyways, the assassin fails to kill Danny but kills Missandei instead, infuriating Danny!

&amp;#x200B;

When Danny burns all the defenses of King's Landing with her dragon(s), and when the Lannister army surrenders, she is content for a second that she has finally won. But then she looks at the Red Keep, and remembers all the evil the Lannisters did to her family, and she decides to finish her off with a big BOOM! Danny, surely wouldn't kill the innocents in the street of King's Landing because those are her people now. But whoever is hiding between the walls of the Red Keep she decides that they are the enemy, the traitors!

&amp;#x200B;

Danny attacks the Red Keep and burns all who are in and around it. Jon and the rest are all frightened and broken by the brutality of Danny, but at least they understand why she is doing it.

&amp;#x200B;

Danny destroys the Red Keep entirely, breaking the wheel in some sense...

&amp;#x200B;

Triumphant, Danny makes a speech to gather all armies to go and face the Night King, the last threat of the Realm. All men must serve the ultimate queen.

&amp;#x200B;

On the way to Winterfell, many of the advisors of Danny are now afraid of her power and of her supremacy. Tyrion is surely broken by the loss of his siblings. Jon, being an honorable man, still cannot accept the fact of her killing the civilians between the walls of the Red Keep, and Jorah now sees that Danny is becoming more and more of a vicious person, with every day passed by.

&amp;#x200B;

Sansa welcomes the queen but defies her on several matters. Danny orders to imprison Sansa for her insolence until the fight with the dead is over, angering both Arya and Jon, but the queen must be obeyed.

&amp;#x200B;

The Night King arrives with his army to the doorsteps of Winterfell.

&amp;#x200B;

The fight begins. The Dothraki have no reason to attack blindly to their demise, so they hang back, waiting for the dead to push, so they may flank them from the sides as the dead push the fortified Unsullied. Fire traps go off everywhere as the living emphasize on using fire against the dead on every occasion. Still, the dead keep on advancing. The Unsullied defend bravely, but they start to lose formations. The Dothraki starts flanking the dead from the left and right, making powerful advances for a while, but then giant wights kill couple of top Dothraki officers in the most gory ways, spreading fear and doubt in the rest.

&amp;#x200B;

When both the Unsullied and the Dothraki become victims of the army of the dead, Danny attacks with her dragon. The rest of the armies push alongside the Unsullied and the Dothraki, balancing the fight for once. This is when the Night King attacks with his dragon, and engages in a fight with Danny and her dragon. Jon flies with his dragon to help Danny.

&amp;#x200B;

After some exciting aerial fights, the Night King and Jon have their dragons kill each other and they are both on the ground now. Danny's dragon is injured but still OK. Jon attacks the Night King. After a short skirmish, the Night King injures Jon badly. The Night King's skills are unmatched. Jorah attacks the Night King, but sadly, Jorah gets killed by the Night King as he stares with a smile at Danny.

&amp;#x200B;

Angered by another close person's death, Danny unleashes the fire of the dragon on the Night King, but she sees that the Night King has survived it!

&amp;#x200B;

Out of nowhere, Arya jumps from the back of the Night King, trying to stab him with her dagger. But the Night King catches her and throw her away in an instant. The dagger falls near the Night King.

&amp;#x200B;

After four attempts on the Night King, it becomes obvious to our heroes that the Night King is unstoppable. But a stubborn Danny unleashes the fire of Drogon on the Night King one more time. As she stares into the fire, she sees that the Night King, while engulfed by the fire, is immobilized. The Night King gets somehow frozen by the dragon fire.

&amp;#x200B;

Danny realizes at the moment what to do. She jumps down from the back of Drogon, gets closer to the Night King, picks up Arya's dagger, gets into the fire, and slowly approaches the Night King who looks straight into her eyes, as she looks into his. Everything gets slowed down. Danny and the Night King are engulfed in Drogon's fire. Danny raises the dagger, looks at the Night King. He looks at her, it feels like he is wanting it now to be all over. She stabs him in the heart slowly as he explodes into nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

Drogon stops breathing fire. All the dead fall to the ground. The battle is over.

&amp;#x200B;

In the aftermath party, Danny gives another speech. She reminds them of who she is and what she did. She freed slaves and killed their masters, she broke the wheel in many occasions and in many different cities. She freed King's Landing from the tyrant the Cersei was and at the top of all, she single handedly killed the Night King, the biggest evil facing the realm. No one else could do it, it had to be her.

&amp;#x200B;

Danny is now consumed by her own victories and who can blame her? She really was the Princess that was promised. She fulfilled the prophecy.

&amp;#x200B;

But men are wicked and her arrogance doesn't make it easier on them to let their wickedness go away.

&amp;#x200B;

With many plots going on to overthrow her in the background, Danny decides that Sansa must die as a punishment for her disobedience. Sansa finds herself in a similar situation as her father.

&amp;#x200B;

After losing all her close advisors, the only one that Danny trusts is Jon now, especially after finding out that he is Targaryen, and not a Stark. She tells Jon of her decision to kill Sansa. With all that was happening, all the plots and discussions with Tyrion and the rest, Jon decides that truly Danny has become an unstoppable and merciless queen, much more powerful than any other tyrant that have ever lived. While her intentions were mostly good, but such power should not be in the hands of one person.

&amp;#x200B;

Jon stabs his queen in the most shameful act of betrayal he could ever imagine he could do. He killed the person who saved them all.

&amp;#x200B;

Jon flees to the North, crazed by his betrayal. Only Ghost would accompany him where he goes.

&amp;#x200B;

As for the rest, meh, just fill the blanks :D",1,1,False,self,,,,,

1. Daenerys killed by Jon Snow to forge lightbringer 

2. Daenerys killed by the NK fuelling Jon Snows rage making him kill the NK

Going into season 8 I believed that GoT hadnt shown enough of mad Daenerys to go through with that storyline and have her killed that way and lets face it Daenerys isnt gonna he killed by Garry the Lannister soldier in charge of a scorpion in KL. I believe that after episode 3 Daenerys had to live because there was no way to kill her that would make sense and Daenerys living would make sense. 

But hey thats just my opinion as a Daenerys fan
Daenerys should have lived and ruled Westeros forever idk if its by fear.",13,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Compare this to the one time Melisandre brought Jon back. She was probably the greatest red priestess of all time, but at that time she was badly wavering in her faith, thanks to Stanniss pathetic unceremonious downfall. What did Davos tell her? Fuck faith, fuck the Gods, fuck all of them - Ive seen YOU perform miracles and I believe in YOU.

So Melisandre performed all the sacred rites, washed Jons body, cut his hair and arranged it, did everything perfectly... and it apparently didnt work. Everyone left the room dejected. With Beric it happened immediately, and he still had the friggen gash in his armor for crying out loud!

After Jons resurrection, what were his thoughts? *I shouldnt be alive, I shouldnt be here, its not right*. One of the mutineers even told Jon as such. Beric never had thoughts as despair-ridden as those - he understood he was certainly brought back for some purpose, even if he didnt understand it. 

Bottom line: I think the reason why Jon was resurrected may have been because Melisandre is just THAT good of a red priestess, and because the Lord of Light saw her trying and said ah what the hell shes earned it. Ill only need to resurrect Jon once anyway. Im not even so sure the Lord of Light had much of a hand in it, beyond a simple okaying nod. 

No matter what dangerous situations Jon was in from then on or whether or not it ultimately yielded fruit (Battle of the Bastards, Wight Hunt), he kept fighting, no matter the odds because he was the shield that guarded the realms of men, and he was going to curse and scream and fight until his heart was done pumping.

There WAS no apparent meaning to Jons resurrection. If there was meaning at all, it was always ambiguous - a mystery. The fact that he was here to fight Death, the final enemy that always wins, was enough.

This line of thought also makes Melisandres character more meaningful, rather than a simple plot device to act as the Lord of Lights conduit because Jon needed to kill the Night King or something. There was some truth in prophecies, as we saw with Jon killing Dany and all the parallels with that and Azor Ahai - but the point the show was trying to make for so long was that prophecies were dangerous things. 

Melisandre was so sure for so long that Stannis was the Prince Who Was Promised, and we all know how that turned out. It could even be argued that Melisandre insinuating to Dany that she may have been the Prince (or Princess) Who Was Promised did yet more to make Dany believe in her own destiny and savior complex - though who could blame her, after she stepped into a funeral pyre and inexplicably emerged with three newly-hatched extinct dragons. But thats a post for another time.",27,9,False,spoiler,,,,,

Say what you will but I will always love this show.



That being said I felt they made a major tactical error by choosing (the decision was made a couple years ago apparently) for Arya to kill the Night King.

By my title you know where Im going, but allow me to explain why.

Theon is one of the last people in the show the viewers and book readers alike would have expected...and more importantly it would be fitting and surprising just like the Hodor reveal.

Early is the show we are informed that Theon was raised at Winterfell when his father proclaimed himself King in a rebellion that failed and lost his son as punishment to the starks. In a way, Theon was a prince who was promised.

Theon story arc is about someone caught between 2 worlds; struggling to find himself and his purpose in life. Early in season 1 we see Theon save Bran from invaders from the north while stating it was the only thing to do so I did it

Through all his transgressions, insecurities, torture, PTSD, and bravery, Theon returns to the home that he always had in his heart and fought for his family. 

It would have been epic if during the Battle in the Gods wood Theon suffered a mortal injury but through all his torture, inner fortitude and the memory of this sisters last words to him what is dead may never die Theon rises one last time with tears and strength in his eyes pulls one last shaft and his aim finds purchase striking the Nights King in the back, piercing his flesh and bringing him down and ending this Long Night. Only after the battle someone realizes the Fletching from the arrow is the same Fletching Theon uses but they are confused because the wound Theon suffered should have killed him almost instantly.

I'm pretty late on this train, but I'm finally watching Game of Thrones, and I'm finished with season 4. Really enjoying it at the moment, even though most of the major plot points were spoiled for me (including the ending). I would just like to ramble off some thoughts in the hopes someone would listen. It's mostly gonna be what I consider controversial since I don't think I can add more to obvious things (like Tyrion being a favourite).

&amp;#x200B;

First things first, I always kinda wanted Stannis to win. If it wasn't for the whole Blood magic thing he had going on, I would have full on rooted for him. He doesn't strike me as the most kind or empathetic character but he is two things I things that I think would make him a good leader. He is competent and just.

&amp;#x200B;

If he had just ditched Melisandre and made amends with Renly, I could see Rob joining them and Kings Landing having a relatively happy ending. His inability to negotiate with Renly probably highlighted his greatest flaws though, and those flaws are probably why he didn't succeed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing. Reading through episode threads, I see a lot of hate for Theon, but I could never get on that train. He did some horrible things at Winterfell, but he hated every minute of it, and the reasons he did it was very understandable. Not that it excuses him (he killed and burned 2 innocent boys after all), but he is far from a monster. He also pays one of the heaviest prices of anybody after that.

&amp;#x200B;

I also find that the Daenerys has some very high highs, but a lot of boring sections as well. I feel similarly about the wall, but thats probably influenced by me knowing the ending (and how little it seems to matter at the end of the day).

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, Oberyn's death. I feel like it was way too graphic. There is a place for shock value but I think that was way over the top. It made me feel a bit disgusted actually and not in a good way. I even knew he was gonna die. I honestly regret watching the end of that episode.

Game of thrones alone tends to help HBO across the line to have more nominations (and most importantly wins) compared to other networks; especially during the Emmys. So once they saw the end product of the show, why wouldnt they delay it and ask for D&amp;D to rework it?

Like I understand that D&amp;D may have grown bored and wanted to pursue other pastures (namely Star Wars) - but why would HBO shoot themselves in the foot like this?

Did they grow complacent when s7 won best drama despite majority of critics and fans considering it weaker compared to other seasons?

- why did Daenerys agree for Jaime to stay in Winterfell? Based on Briennes word only? What about the fact that he killed her father when he was sworn to protect him? I thought Jaime would tell her about the wild fire, but nope.
- why was Arya in Kings Landing? Only to tell Jon that Danys a killer? Is that it?
- whats the point of the Euron vs Jaime fight? You dont need Jaime to be injured to have him die in the crypts.
- what was the point of Cleganebowl? what did it serve?
- whats the deal with the horse that Arya saw in KL? I see a connection with the character of the peasant girl who had a toy wooden horse with her; is that it?
- whats the point of building your character for 6+ seasons if you then want to destroy it the very last two episodes of the last season (and maybe one scene in season 7)? I mean I guess I kinda see what they were going for here, but why would they throw away her whole build-up only at the very end? I was never a fan of Daenerys, but they did her so dirty.

&amp;#x200B;

**Thinkers and how they see the world**

&amp;#x200B;

*The Republic* (Plato) 

Plato spoke of an ideal ruler for his world: the philosopher king. A king able to tell right from wrong, able of a reason out of the commoner's grasp. (He also spoke of ""beauty"", but it's not as much linked to GoT). This king, beholding all powers in his state, can bend the laws in order for Justice to be enacted (because some laws are unfair and the King can bend it to fit the ideal of Justice) . 

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, Plato was an idealist. No one has such reason, no one can uphold Justice in such a way and not be unfair at some point.

&amp;#x200B;

*Machiavelli's Prince*

The book Machiavelli wrote was a textbook guide on how to gain power and keep it. Better to be feared and parcimonous than generous and loved, for example (hello Dany!). A prince has to be cunning and lie in order to gain and keep power. Keep good appearances (appear trustworthy), but keep a dagger hidden behind your back and strike the moment your opponent has dropped his guard. 

&amp;#x200B;

Machiavelli mostly meant for a ruler to hold his power through vigilance (don't ever drop your guard) and not owing too much to others, because everyone looking for power is looking for the same flaws in their enemies. 

&amp;#x200B;

**How does it fit GoT?** 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Snow**

Snow is unable to lie, therefore his strategy can't fit Machiavellism on many aspects. He knows what is good and wrong, he is able to make calls on being forgiving to people *related* to betrayers (Justice), but he can't ever lie to Cersei, even when it would have been profitable. 

&amp;#x200B;

Snow is a great fighter, a good leader, but also managed to get himself killed, meaning he managed to get himself hated enough to be stabbed. He is able to wage war better than others, but doesn't fit the ruler's chair. Just like many other leaders real countries (like Churchill and De Gaulle), there are war chiefs and there are rulers. Churchill was a great Prime Minister and got sacked the moment the war was over. Snow is a bit of the same. He can lead an army, but I don't believe he is able to be a ruler like some expected him to be at the end. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's more of a scenario's issue than a personality one. The show was centered on Snow and it did feel like a badly written thing when he didn't take the throne, but I don't see him on the Throne and never saw him there either. He might be one of the heirs to the throne, he was never seen as a ruler except in tense moments like beyond the wall and when the dead came. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Danaerys**

Was she insane from the get go? Was she not? It's not that important. Dany has had a development as a ruthless ruler. when she bought an army of  slaves, she will burn the owner and not pay him. She frees people, but... At the same time, the moment she leaves a freed city, the city is in turmoil with the masters trying to gain power back .

&amp;#x200B;

Many moves preceding Tyrion and Varys' arrival are reckless. She grows her army by being feared by enemies, she is loved by her people, but she lacks lasting networks of allies. Out of the many places she visited and met with rulers, few have kept their rulers' heads on their shoulders, which is dangerous. 

&amp;#x200B;

Having someone in your debt can be much more rewarding than taking over, which she has repeatedly done. The only ""transaction"" before the dead breached the wall was with the Greyjoys (Theon and Yara) who tried to negociate their independance against their support. Even then, she doesn't completely agree or disagree to their negociation. Neither the Dothraki or the unsullied have been negociated over. They found themselves in her grasp because she became the prophetic mother of dragons and freed the slave army. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not having allies (or indebted people) in your pocket makes for an empire, for which you need a structure (which she lacked) to rule. Having trusted lords and kings in the empire is crucial. She lacked allies in her endeavors and became more and more hated (combined with fear) as she commited genocide. Being hated and dropping her guard with Snow. An arrogant move.

&amp;#x200B;

* **The council** 

Tyrion and Varys (and littlefinger to an extent, but I'll come back to him) are excellent strategists. If anything, they fit exactly the role Machiavelli had himself. They advise, they are resourceful and brillant, **but** they are not able to take power. Just like Machiavelli, they thrive in the shadows and know they aren't able to sit in the throne as the ones holding the title. 

&amp;#x200B;

They wouldn't like it, but they also wouldn't be able to rule. They lack some... Character trait. They are the cunning shadows. They won't hold the sword, they won't wage the war, but will often find the way to interfere in the strategy for good or bad. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Littlefinger

Littlefinger also fits the ""Machiavelli"" part, but tries to benefit from it like a King would benefit from the cunningness. He is a person belonging to the shadow that tried to get some exposure in the sun. He might have started the GoT wars for the iron throne, but it brought him to his end. He paid in full for his actions as he tried to get Sansa for himself and thought himself smarter than any other. Had he been successful, he'd have gotten (at least) the North, which would be an immense gain for a smaller lord, but... He was like Icarus. Power was too hot for him and he burned.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Brandon Stark, The broken**

While we don't see Bran rule anyone for the longest part of the show, Bran has the *potential* to fit all. 

&amp;#x200B;

We don't see him lie throughout his development as the three eyed raven, but he is able to know all and knowing all means he can predict any move done against him, which prevents assassination and makes him able to build Westeros and know what the people think of him, what his enemies will think of him, etc. You see the picture, he can be all-knowing which makes him not stronger, but able to prevent any type of cunning attack done against him or his people. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, his development as the three eyed raven makes him wiser than any other ruler in Westeros. He knows history more than anyone and is able to know the situation of anyone at a moment's notice. That, combined with advice from people like Tyrion and Brienne, makes him able to hold a Justice different than one held by law. He doesn't need a trial to find one guilty, just his powers. 

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, he is the one most capable of reason, I believe. His capability of knowing all makes him wiser than anyone. Without even needing historians, he knows which mistakes have been done and what to do to prevent them. That means he can prevent any attack on his rule (breaking Machiavellic schemes on himself) and holds the biggest knowledge anyone has ever gotten, making him the wisest person alive, despite his age. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, even if the show made him a cripple that didn't seem to do a lot, he does fit best the theories surrounding power and who can hold it. From what I can tell, the one thing that is lacking to Bran is that his screentime didn't fit the growth necessary for him to suddenly become king. That was lacking. He should have been more involved with what happened, but the writers didn't do that and it's a shame.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: reflecting on how the show ended and how, even if it's badly written, the ending fit some theoretical schemes political nerds like me enjoy.

&amp;#x200B;

What happened to Arya in KL? She told Jon he needed to kill Dany, then he went off to chat to Tyrion, then on to the throne room, as we know. Everyone seems to be questioning how/why Jon got captured by Grey Worm, and delving into the odd motivations of those characters. But I want to know what Arya did at that point. It just seems so bizarre to me that the bad-ass face-swapping ninja warrior just let them capture her brother and decided to let him stay there as a prisoner. Did she swing home to pick up Sansa and negotiate Jon out, rather than sneaking him out? Did she just chill in KL, waiting for everyone else to come and deal with the situation?  'Cause that doesn't seem particularly Arya to me.

Also, what went on with Davos? He was on his way to the Red Keep with Jon to talk to the queen. Clearly he let Jon go on ahead because the shot looked much more dramatic with just Kit walking up the stairs. But at what point did he (and the other Northern men who were there) just decide to sneak out? Was it during the speech, when they all realised she was a nutter, despite having no idea what she was saying? Was it after the death of the queen? And, if so, how did they manage to get out of the city despite the hordes of Dothraki and Unsullied who would have been trying to avenge their queen?

Why/how Jon became a prisoner is such a discussed topic that I think it distracted everyone from asking how any of the other characters happened to depart KL safely in the wake of Dany's death.",37,21,False,spoiler,,,,,

* **Cersei** - is your stereotypical manipulative, vindictive, ""bitch"". But she has a saving grace - she is *fierce* and unsubmissive. She prefers violence and domination to submission(pun not intended). Illustrated by the whole high sparrow/septa Unella resolution.

* **Jaime** - this is a stereotypical noble/gentleman who keeps his vows and stays true to his heart, even if that means fucking over everybody else and fucking his own sister. The man loved her. Died with his love.

* **Tyrion** - is a deluded alcoholic who thinks too highly of himself. He is also a bit of a narcissist with machiavellian tendencies. Not even half as good as his dad.

* **Varys** - ruthless, professional careerist.

* **Arya** - man in a skirt.

* **Jon Snow** - a honest idiot, usually prey for manipulative and abusive characters, ends up advancing other's causes. Wasted really.

* **Tormund** - alpha male, whatever that means.

* **Sansa** - selfish, treacherous, submissive, manipulative &amp; envious ""bitch"", will backstab anyone - even her closest family members. Will not fight for her dignity.

* **Ned Stark** - an idiot who had no backbone to say ""NO"".

* **Clegane** - a lost, soulsearching principled, nobleman.

* **Olenna** - embodiment of a spectacular mix - funny, smart &amp; witty, strategic, bold, cunning, direct, strong willed. A sensational woman.

* **Ramsay Bolton** - this fellow is just evil. And he is good at what he does.

* **Theon Greyjoy** - lacks principles, submissive psychopath. The worst kind.

* **Daenerys** - a girl that wanted to fly, but ugly men cut her wings.

Here are mine:

1: S3E5 - *Kissed by Fire*

Easily my favorite episode of the show, from my favorite season. Contains the best trial by combat scene; The Hound &amp; Beric, the best romance scene; Jon &amp; Ygritte in the cave, the best of Jamie; bath scene, a really heartfelt moment between Shireen &amp; the imprisoned Davos, and finally the execution of Karstark by Robb. The episode draws so many parallells to its title as well.

2: S6E10 - *Winds of Winter*

Speaks for itself really. As a book reader, you can still appreciate the amazing cinematography that is the first 25 minutes of this episode. The rest of the episode is filled with satisfying scenes, and ends with Dany FINALLY sailing to Westeros. The perfect ending for the show.

3: S4E9 - T*he Watchers on the Wall*

Miles better than Battle of the Bastards and Battle for Winterfell. Most underrated episode in the show.

4: S4E7 - *Mockingbird*

Near perfect episode. Contains the best dialogue in the whole show between Tyrion and Oberyn, and continues the momentum of the second half of season *4.*

5: S4E6 - *The Laws of Gods and Men*

The start of the adrenaline rush that is the later half of season 4. Peak Tyrion, the final minutes depicts what could've been if the show included the Tysha reveal for Tyrion's character in latter seasons.

6: S2E9 - *Blackwater*

The climax of the darkest season. Peak show-Cersei, peak show-Stannis, peak HotK Tyrion, introduction to a KL with Tywin &amp; Tyrells.

7: S3E7 - *The Rains of Castamere*

Slightly overrated but no one can deny the impact it had on the show's popularity, the culture of show reactions and the tv-landscape as a whole. One of the only great episodes of the show I have a hard time rewatching, and for good reasons.

8: S4E8 - *The Mountain and the Viper*

The Red Wedding of Season 4.

*9: S3E7 - The Bear and the Maiden Fair*

Along with The Watchers on the Wall, one of the most underrated episodes of the show.

10: S1E6 - *Golden Crown*

My favorite episode of the first season, and the episode that got me hooked on this show so many years ago.",10,7,False,spoiler,,,,,

I actually think Joffrey would be the best king in terms of eliminating the sparrows and preventing their power, he would have done whatever was necessary to stop them. 

What about Robert? He would have been somewhat more reversed than Joffrey, but I don't think he would have put up with it for too long either.

Jon is an interesting prospect, on one hand he might have been too decent to do what must be done, and allow himself to be too weak. But he was a good leader, and not at all a coward. But I wonder what he would have done.",23,11,False,spoiler,,,,,

So I'm rewatching GoT and I'm just about finish Season 6 again.

I just watched Episode 10 and now I'm honestly wondering what Daario is up to now after the big battle with the night king and the following happenings in Kings Landing. How long would it take him to find out? I feel like he would not take Danys Death well :/ tbh he's probably planning his revenge with grey worm.
I just felt like there was no closure for his character. Another lose end that i feel like it should have been tied.

Daeny's dragons however put their some of their ships to the torch. So I cannot help wonder why it is that the yunkish fleet wasn't equipped with scorpions to deal with the threat of dragons. Or why they never used scorpions on any other platform. Surely it must have occcured to the ghiscari generals that ships are particularly vulnerable to fire breathing dragons(the kind Daeny has)

I mean, the ghiscari must have heard how flying creatures can be felled with arrows. Dany's dragons are vulnerable to scorpion bolts as they can be killed with relative ease i.e Euron killing Rhaegal with a bolt fired from a scorpion on a ship from behind a promontory.

Logically, shouldn't the ghiscari, of all the peoples of Essos, have had the knowledge needed for the effective development and deployment of anti-dragon scorpions?

I find it in every field of human experience but its latest form was the whole GOT S8 reception by the audience.

I, for one, loved the season and the ending. Not saying its flawless (it isnt), not saying its not rushed (it is, to a degree), and I totally respect any kind of contrary opinion about it.

What really bothers me is the whole narrative of I have to convince people its shit, they must see the truth!

Its not science, its not something you measure with numbers... its love-it vs. hate-it, including all the grey areas in between. Its entertainment, its art. People are entitled to have different opinions about it. Only because its not experimental jazz it doesnt mean its bad (also the other way around).

Yet all I see in this sub and on social media in general, are sarcastic, passive/aggressive posts about how much it sucked. Its like everyone pulling other peoples sleeves to try and convince them that its wrong they liked it.

Why tho?

From a sheer opinion standpoint no one should force their view to other people.  
And this should work both ways (of course).

But... (be careful now, its gonna sound very hippy)

Why try to convince other people into something negative? If there has to be a common ground, why not make it a positive one?

Lets have a positive stance and maybe lets try to understand why it was done that way instead of seething with rage with why it wasnt done the other way!

I just dont get why people do that. Does it feel good? Please explain! I want to understand why its done this way, I dont want to complain why its not done the other way.

TL;DR Enjoy things ffs and let other people do that as well, or explain why dont you. Cheers!",22,0,False,self,,,,,

From bits and pieces such as ""The Seed is Strong"" of the first book, to little chapters such as Tyrion's chapter with Janos Slynt, I've been picking up really hard on some of these hints that I know for a fact I wouldn't have figured out beforehand.

This all being said, I've just really been hit across the head with another great bit of Foreshadowing, and it's present in the very first Season/Book.

Jon Snow has been lovingly referred to as ""Lord Snow"" by various brothers of the Night's Watch, a name originally meant to demean Jon Snow for being the Bastard Born raised by Ned Stark. Foreshadowing seems more than evident to this nickname, because this title actually takes on an entirely new meaning after he's named Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.

I thought the final season was largely a disappointment. It felt more like an outline than a fully fleshed out story. But there was one scene in the last episode that could have remained the same even if the show was properly completed with 9 or 10 seasons. I would love to hear from other GOT fans what they thought of this scene. I found the concept of taking oaths and breaking oaths to be a central theme of the show. Short excerpt below:

""Oaths can sound simple and clean in principle, but they often get messy when applied to the real world. Learning when to uphold an oath and when to break one became a theme for Jon Snow. His long character arc over the series captured his growing wisdom in this area. His first influence was of course Ned Stark, and Ned probably imparted the deepest and wisest sense of duty and honor into Jon. But Maester Aemon was also crucial to Jons growth as a character. [This dialogue between Jon and Maester Aemon](https://youtu.be/i6IUvY2eJzY), one which is called back to in the very last episode, is particularly important. It beautifully captures the complication of oaths, honor, duty, and love. For me it serves as an underlying theme of the entire series. It occurs in the 9th episode of season 1 as Jon considers leaving the Nights Watch to avenge his fathers death and join his families fight against the Lannisters.""",8,9,False,spoiler,,,,,

If you defend Daenerys, Greyworm, or their actions, well time for Mr Vonnegut to lecture you in morality. 

This is short writing by Kurt Vonnegut, titles Wailing Shall Be in All Streets, in his book, Armageddon in Retrospect. I changed a couple of nouns from the passage to relate it to the series. But the passage itself is about the uncalled for, unnecessary, inhuman bombing of Dresden, Germany in 1945. 

The death of Kings Landing was a bitter tragedy, needlessly and willfully executed. The killing of children can never be justified. 
The facile reply to the great groans such as mine is the most hateful of the cliches, fortunes of war, and They asked for it. All they understand is force. Who asked for it? 
Believe me, it is not easy to rationalize the stamping out of vineyards where the grapes of wrath are stored when gathering up babies in bushel baskets or helping a man dig where he thinks his wife may be buried. Certainly enemy military and industrial institutions should have been blow flat, and woe unto those foolish enough to seek shelter near them. But the spirit of revenge, the approbation of all destruction and killing, has earned us a name for obscene brutality, and cost the World the possibility of Westeros becoming a peaceful and intellectually fruitful nation in anything but the most remote future.
Kings Landing, built in the art spirit, symbol of an admirable heritage, so anti-Cersei, plowed under and salt strewn in the furrows. 
But I stand convinced that the brand of justice in which we dealt, wholesale bombings of civilian populations, was blasphemous. That the enemy did it first has nothing to do with the moral problem. 
What I saw of our air war, as the conflict neared an end, had the earmarks of being an irrational war for wars sake.

While the blackfire rebellions / dance of the dragons would probably be good picks, seeing dragons, war and political intruige again is just not great, and westeros is much more than that.

That's why I suggest a Lomas Longstrider spinoff, travelling the world as he goes east, finding and fighting trouble where it comes. It would be hugely different to the existing series, as it's all about the world of thrones, not the war. We'd also move from many protagonists to one which is a nice change. There could be some neat tie ins to the history of thrones, or if they wanted to change the lore we could use the show to subtlety explore the reign of King bran. 

It's basically Marco Polo meets GoT, which sounds pretty perfect to me. I know there's a lot of mystery in not knowing these places, but it seems a waste to not use them and explore all the cultures Planetos has to offer.

There is a precedent in the books for a Great Council to gather to select a new king when the line of succession is unclear. But, as there have been very few and those are limited to the heirs of House Targaryen, I think a better system to look at would be the kingsmoot, a tradition of the ironborn, which you may remember from Season 6. The kingsmoot is an ancient tradition of the ironborn, stretching back to the days of the First Men, before the arrival of the Andals in Westeros.

The problem with the kingsmoot is it didn't last. The books state that a king known as Urron ""Redhand"" Greyiron made the throne hereditary about a thousand years before the arrival of the Andals. Now, for those of you who don't know, and I don't blame you at all for not knowing about them, the Greyirons were one of the Houses of ironborn who completely dominated the Iron Islands during the era of the kingsmoot. They're said to have had twice as many high kings as any other Houses. And eventually, they took complete control over the Islands by suspending the quasi-democratic tradition of the kingsmoot.

So, what I'm getting at is pretty simple: the Great Houses of Westeros are nowhere near equal, and therefore even if they have the same amount of votes per House, the more wealthy and powerful Houses will control the votes of the less powerful Houses. Eventually, some House, be it the Lannisters or the Baratheons or the Arryns or the Tullies or whatever Houses at this point controls Dorne or the Reach, will end up dominating the others. And when one House realizes that they're by far the most powerful, they'll just say ""why should I bother with this democracy thing if I'll just get elected anyway?"" And the throne, be it iron or gold or any other metal, will become hereditary again.",1,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

""The White Walkers are an allegory for climate change and the show's refusal/inability to take that fact to it's logical conclusion is why so many people felt let down by the conclusion of the show.""

I truly believe if the show had fully leaned in to this metaphor and taken it to it's logical conclusion, the story would have written itself (for the most part), and become a scary representation of what could happen to us if we don't do anything to fight back against real world climate change.

Endless articles have been written about this. In 2013 George R.R. Martin said if he had wanted to write an allegory for climate change, he would have written an allegory for climate change. But in a 2018 interview, he basically agreed that his story is a perfect metaphor for climate change (I have the link if you want). So I really, really don't want to get into an argument about whether it is. For me it is, for you it doesn't have to be, but this is one of the many 'points' to art: if you want it to be there and there's enough evidence to back up your feelings/theory, then it's there. If you don't want it to be there, then it's not there and that's fine. 

Either way, leaning into this metaphor is where the story becomes interesting because there are so many ways it could play out. And they can all relate back to the world we live in now. If you're optimistic about our future, maybe people will create an invention that works against climate change, I.E., the characters in the show discover or create some sort of magic or tool that is very effective against the White Walkers, but the WW still take over a great deal of the world and leave it uninhabitable. If you're less optimistic, maybe a majority of the world becomes uninhabitable and then people fight over what little resources/land is left, I.E., that literally could just happen in the show. I'm more privy to the latter because then the wheel is finally broken but instead of living in the idealized world where the wheel is broken, we are forced back into our animal need for survival in an even more chaotic world, fighting over what's left, killing ourselves and not really learning from our experiences all because we didn't act when we had the chance. 

These possible futures could play out in the show and I think they'd be immensely more interesting than what we received. And it would also be far more satisfying because we would get to see a metaphorical representation of what we all may potentially experience. And then the White Walkers would rise to their true potential as a world ending catastrophe, instead of just a monster you lose 'half' your soldiers to defeat. It could be scary and even depressing, but we would all be relating to the show in a visceral way. Whether you don't believe climate change will affect us or you do, there would be a deep emotional reaction the the events in the show because it ties in so intimately to our actual lived experience in the current world.

The White Walkers were always the most important part of the show, we literally begin with them and spend so much time worrying about them. The human power struggles were always a distraction because WE are too distracted by our power struggles and fear of death to mobilize against one of the very things that could actually destroy us, and that we are at least partially responsible for. And the way the show handled the White Walkers was not indicative of this. The show's answer to an unstoppable force is basically, find the source and kill it. Which sort of works because if we go to the source, we could definitely help curb climate change, but there's never going to be one thing we can succeed at and then totally stop global warming. And maybe we actually won't stop it and that's the future I truly fear, but ironically it's the future I wanted to see play out in the show.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

For me it is, for you it doesn't have to be, but this is one of the many 'points' to art: if you want it to be there and there's enough evidence to back up your feelings/theory, then it's there. If you don't want it to be there, then it's not there and that's fine.

Either way, leaning into this metaphor is where the story becomes interesting because there are so many ways it could play out. And they can all relate back to the world we live in now. If you're optimistic about our future, maybe people will create an invention that works against climate change, I.E., the characters in the show discover or create some sort of magic or tool that is very effective against the White Walkers, but the WW still take over a great deal of the world and leave it uninhabitable before this happens. If you're less optimistic, maybe a majority of the world becomes uninhabitable and then people fight over what little resources/land is left, I.E., that literally could just happen in the show. I'm more privy to the latter because then the wheel is finally broken but instead of living in the idealized world where the wheel is broken, we are forced back into our animal need for survival in an even more chaotic world, fighting over what's left, killing ourselves and not really learning from our experiences all because we didn't act when we had the chance.

These possible futures could play out in the show and I think they'd be immensely more interesting than what we received. And it would also be far more satisfying because we would get to see a metaphorical representation of what we all may potentially experience. And then the White Walkers would rise to their true potential as a world ending catastrophe, instead of just a monster you lose 'half' your soldiers to defeat. It could be scary and even depressing, but we would all be relating to the show in a visceral way. Whether you don't believe climate change will affect us or you do, there would be a deep emotional reaction to the events in the show because it ties in so intimately to our actual lived experience in the current world.

The White Walkers were always the most important part of the show, we literally begin with them and spend so much time worrying about them. The human power struggles were always a distraction because WE are too distracted by our power struggles and fear of death to mobilize against one of the very things that could actually destroy us, and that we are at least partially responsible for. And the way the show handled the White Walkers was not indicative of this. The show's answer to an unstoppable force is basically, find the source and kill it. Which sort of works because if we go to the source, we could definitely help curb climate change, but there's never going to be one singular thing we can do to totally stop global warming. And maybe we actually won't stop it. That's the future I truly fear, but ironically it's the future I wanted to see play out in the show.",14,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

As a reward for participating, our friendly neighborhood admins will be giving out some trophies that will display on your profile pages.

# TROPHIES

[**Not Forgotten** ](https://i.imgur.com/2IInre4.png)

 Anyone who took part in the Throne Pool will be receiving this trophy on their user profile. Your character may not have won, but everyone should have something to remember it by.

[**No Throne, No Problems**](https://i.imgur.com/vCRtfnT.png)

Anyone who picked r/nobodywinsthethrone will receive this trophy, given that there was, in fact, no Iron Throne by the end of the series.

[**King of the Ashes**](https://i.imgur.com/HXNU7Py.png)

Anyone who picked r/branwinsthethrone will receive this trophy. Bran may not be atop the Iron Throne, but he does reign over the ashes, and the rest of the ~~seven~~ six kingdoms.

[**Queen in da Norf**](https://i.imgur.com/W2LPBNo.png)

Anyone who picked r/sansawinsthethrone will receive this trophy. She didn't win THE throne, but she did win an important one, so Team Sansa is getting a trophy too.

Now that it's all done, I'd like to re watch in the same manner. In shows like this, where you have this incredible depth to the characters, a handful of them, and such an inter-winding plot-line...I'd like to go back and watch them individually. 

Is this something we can ask for from HBO with final DVDs or future streams (gut feeling: absolutely fucking not), or is there a way someone can go through all the seasons and do start and end times for character scenes? 

For me as I re-watch, I want to watch Danny, John, Arya, Sansa, Bran.. Others Im sure would like to watch other characters. I'll be honest, as these seasons progressed, I always re-watched as either Danny or Jon.... So. Obviously I'm not happy with the ending.

But what really happens to Daario Naharis? He was left behind by Daenerys to look after Mereen until she returns. He loved her no less than Jorah who died protecting her. No sign of him in the last episodes which really bothers me because he would do anything for her and definitely seek to get her justice.

One thing that has always stuck out to me is that House Baratheon doesn't have a distinct theme like many of the other houses. All over YouTube, you'll see people labeling songs like ""The King's Arrival,"" ""You Win Or You Die,"" ""The Throne Is Mine,"" and ""You'll Be Queen One Day"" as ""the Baratheon theme,"" but it's clear at this point that those songs are rather just part of the Iron Throne/Royalty theme. ""King's Arrival"" plays when Jon and Dany come to Winterfell, and the other tunes are often associated with Joffrey/Tommen (at their weddings for example) and they aren't true Baratheon's.

After rewatching some Season 2 clips, one thing I noticed was that the Stannis theme is played a few times during scenes with Renly Baratheon - and in one such scene, Stannis isn't even present.

(1) Brienne vs. Ser Loras: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArHAQzH10GU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArHAQzH10GU)

Notice the background music starting at 3:00. That three-note tune that we typically associate with Stannis (when he leaves Castle Black for example - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ebyb43-Yi8s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ebyb43-Yi8s) at 4:18) plays when Renly declares he will take Kings Landing. And then a little later, when Brienne starts talking we can hear the ""Warrior of Light"" song faintly in the background, which is also part of the Stannis theme.

(2) Stannis and Renly Negotiations: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-JG\_-GUiMU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-JG_-GUiMU)

This is perhaps the greatest indication that the real House Baratheon theme may just be the one we associate with Stannis. This is the only scene with theme music where we just see real Baratheon's, and the music that plays is again from the ""Warrior of Light"" song with that unmistakable four-note tune. And while the music is playing, a good amount of screen time is fixed on Renly's Stormlands soldiers.

Now obviously I doubt the writers and music producers ever made a conscientious decision to say that ""this is the theme for House Baratheon"" but I just find it interesting that Renly and Stannis actually shared the same theme.",2,13,False,spoiler,,,,,

The moment when Samwell Turly ""invented"" **democracy**, he wanted to give the power of ruling over the people - to the people. Democracy is one of the best accomplishments of humanity, democracy is. When Sam first suggested it, I loved it - it showed that the people of Westeros do want to evolve from wars and blood shedding into a prospering realm. After the idea was butchered by the honourable lords and ladies with chuckles and laughing, I was disappointed. But I was comforted with Tyrion Lannister's suggestion. His suggestion was to let the rich and powerful people of the realm voting rights and control, and letting only those people the right to **choose** the king/queen. Such thing is in fact, **oligarchy**. I like to call oligarchy ""democracys little and less pretty sister"". It really is, and many times in history, countries that were using oligarchy as a ruling system were to at some point move to democracy. And thous I see this as a complete win to the realm, a real change towards power to the people.

Choosing Bran to rule was a good choice, he'll make a good king. And I hope they'll eventually will realise the important roll of democracy in the world.

She already knows that there was something wrong with the dragons, and it sends a message, breaches the Targaryen and Northern alliance and keeps her promise, even if it's not very efficient (it's all about the message). It pushes Daenerys to mistrust John, maintains the Lannister motto and shows that she's learned the strategies of her father, chipping away alliances. Even if she didn't know that the dragon was with the white walkers, it is a very damaging weapon if they made some adjustments. It would be impossible for the northerners to take the Scorpions for a siege, and they have their own weapons for that anyway, but would have to reorganize because the people of the North wouldn't fear dragons so much by then, and might try to reinstate a King in the North",11,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Just like Robert Lyanna and Rhaegar. I think the books will go past Brand rule and we will see how all of this plays out. I believe D&amp;D just thought it would be better to shop and Dannys death. This is why I think GRRM wanted way more seasons also. There are just way too similarities between each other their journeys. Both fell in love with commoners, were outcasts, warriors, both stabbed. In season 8 the way Jon touches her and she looks at him is just really weird to me especially in the last episode when he sees her in KL. They were channeling the same hair style too. George always said he didnt like how lord of the rings ending with just the king getting married. He said he wanted to see his rule and what happens after. I think the last book will more or less have what happens with all of the characters ultimately. Plus if Arya and Jon has a baby it could end up sitting on the throne for the end.

Make it seem like John is very loyal to her. John finds out he is a Targaryen but still continues his relationship with Daenerys. Still leaving her in the dark. This information is seriously affecting him as his nature slowly begins to become more violent. A gradual change but still noticeable. Daenerys notices this and acknolages this but he brushes it off. Daenerys still keeping a close eye on the situation. Meanwhile Cersei is getting ready to have her child. Cersei reinstates trial by combat. The North prepares for the ice zombies.

Later (Episodes 4,5,6, 7?), this is the part where the Night King reaches Winterfell. The Night King is defeated in a similar fashion as to the actual episode. Bran is killed. John's actions begin to get progressively more violent. During the post-massacre feast, John announces his true parentage to everyone, leaving Daenerys in shock and many of the northerners very happy. Daenerys and John get in a huge fight, that ends in the death of Daenerys. Daenerys is burned alive by John. Those still loyal to Daenerys demand a trial for murder in kings landing. Meanwhile, Cersei has just given birth to her last child, but is well enough to attend the trial.

In episode 8, Johns trial takes place, he chooses trial by combat with his champion being the Hound. Cersei's champion being the Mountain. The battle takes place. The Hound wins. John is set free and demands his throne. He becomes the king of Westeros. Cersei remains in the castle.

In episode 9, John becomes the Mad Targaryen. The snows are still coming, and Melisandre recommends her home remedy of burning children at stake. To prove his loyalty Jaime is the one sent to retrieve Cersei's child as Cersei has been isolating herself in her chambers. It is dark when Jaime comes so when Cersei sees someone taking her child she immediately goes and fatally stabs them only to realize it is Jaime.

In episode 10, the child is retrieved and Cersei watches her last child being burned alive. Cersei, wanting nothing but vengeance, poisons John Snow. Everyone wonders who it is until Cersei confesses and with nothing to live for, throws herself from the same window Tommen did. (The **have** to put ""Light of the Seven"" in the background of this and at the part where the tuba comes in is where Cersei kills herself) Sansa takes her claim to the throne but everyone is unsure, as winter has come and no one is prepared.",8,0,False,self,,,,,

My natural response was that I hope someone stabs him and steals the throne. 

Which led me to think about how ridiculously hard It would be for someone to murder him.

Firstly, the plot would have to be carried out by someone who has extreme knowledge of brans powers. 

They would have to act as a lone wolf, never speaking about their plot. Every action they took to put the plot in place would have to have a legitimate secondary purpose and motive in order to deceive Bran while he creepily watches them.

This person would have to live a complete lie of a life for god knows how long, never once showing any emotion or breaking character, EVER, not even to themselves. They would have to stay ""in character"" when completely alone 24/7.

Could possibly drive a person mad..Tyrion is prob the only person who could pull It off.

There is so very much to be impressed by, and binge watching it at a rate of about 6 episodes a day was a whirlwind. 

First of all, Im a movie person. The cinematic ambition always enthralls me, and this show is pure cinema.  The scale, cinematography, locations, sets, costumes, visual effects, sound, music, and of course the acting were all on a very high level I honestly didnt expect and dont believe Ive ever seen from a tv series. I was blown away, and increasingly so as the series progressed through its seasons.  The combined effect of all of it was to produce a completely immersive experience that kept me entranced until the final fade-out of the ending episode. 

I laughed, I cried, I ached, I felt joy, I was spellbound, I was repulsed, and, in the end, I was happy and I was angry. 

One of the earliest lessons of the series, after just the first season, is that justice cannot be expected.  Indeed, if there is any deeper message to the stories, it seems to me that it is that justice is not what we think it is, and what may seem just or unjust in the present can be the opposite in the long term. Impulse must be tempered by insight. Fairness must be forged by failure. Judgment must be delivered gently.  If everyone were beheaded the moment they committed their worst act, out nations would be buried in heads. 

I have a lot of questions.  Theres a lot that was hard to piece together in my viewing.  Im thinking about reading the books, now. So removed was I from this entire phenomenon that I didnt even know the series was based on books. I am sure many of my questions will be answered by reading them. And then I will probably want to watch the series again. 

Thats all for now. I just wanted to say hi, and express my gratitude for being able to experience the world of this story.  If you reading this played any part in making it, I thank you with all my heart.",36,49,False,spoiler,,,,,

I'm unsure why but this episode was a better series finale than the Iron Throne. The music was outstanding, winter had arrived, the pay off of 6 seasons worth of stories, Dany finally heading to Westeros. Obviously theres alot of story left to tell but the tone of the episode felt very ""final"".

The Childrens attempt at harnessing Ice magic failed. They lost control and brought the Long Night. Learning from their mistakes the 3ER was created. The 3ER is an agent of the Children to infiltrate and divide the realms of men and to ultimately rule over Westeros (if you cant beat them, be them, right?). He has been the master puppeteer shifting the course of history with his greenseer abilities. The 3ER is responsible for the cataclysmic events that have unfolded in Westeros.

Using his greenseer abilities the 3ER was able to locate the house that was most spiritually weak in The Valyrian Freehold - the Targaryens. They arent this mighty Valyrian superpower we are lead to believe - they are extremely susceptible to the powers of the 3ER who is able to manipulate them through dreams and visions as we have seen throughout Targaryen history. The 3ER warned Daenys the dreamer Targaryen about the Doom a decade prior which led to the migration of Targaryens over to Dragonstone. They were the only house to survive the Doom of Valyria which was orchestrated by the Children.

The Children have used magic to decimate entire land masses in the wars against the First Men. To prevent the migration of the First Men the Children of the Forest destroyed the lands bridging Westeros and and Essos called the Arm of Dorne. They did the same in the Neck which is why there are so many rivers obstructing the landmass. They used this same magic to initiate the the Doom.

Following the doom the 3ER used fire magic to initiate a line of communication with followers to spread influence and consolidate power in Essos which lead to the founding of the religion of Rhllor. It is the only religion in ASOIF lore where the God actively displays their powers and this is because the 3ER is actively influencing and manipulating followers for personal gain - the 3ER is the physical embodiment of the Lord of Light. The magic used in the Rhllor religion is very similar to the dark magic used by the Children involving sacrifice and foresight which was used against the First Men.

The Targaryens would be used to consolidate power over Westeros and keep men in conflict for the next few centuries. The madness that we see in the Targaryen lineage is a result of this manipulation which was non existent back when they resided in Valyria. It only begun occurring when they reached Westeros. It is not a result of incest as they brought these traditions with them from Valyria. The 3ER is the god that decides where the coin lands. They would be used as pawns to defeat the White walkers and dwindle the population of men in Westeros with the endgame of putting the the 3ER on the throne as an agent of The Children.

The 3ER intentionally allowed Bran to be marked by the Nights King to nullify the magic of the wall and allow for the NK to meet his demise at Winterfell. Its no coincidence the Night King began moving south as soon as Bran/3ER did. Bran gave Arya the catspaw dagger to kill the NK.
Bran lied about the Night Kings motives. It was purely a quest for vengeance and anyone who stood between the Nights Kings desire for revenge would be destroyed. After defeating Bran the white walkers would retreat back North. The Night King would have actually saved humanity from the 3ER and would have prevented the destruction of Kings Landing (thenightkingdidnothingwrong). The symbols we see throughout the show were actually the WW attempting to communicate and warn humanity of the dark magic used by the Children. These symbols can be found and were carved by Children in the caves of Dragonstone to represent their power. 

The 3ER was the one who brought back Beric (to save Arya) and Jon (to kill Dany) as fire wights (GRRM Martin used this term to describe Jon and Beric). Again, supported by Brans ominous farewell to Jon at the end of the series You were exactly where you were supposed to be.- as if he were playing a game of chess. 

The 3ER was responsible for Danys descent into madness. He was the one who insisted on revealing Jons parentage right before the long night. He influenced her dreams and sowed dissent in her council to evoke paranoia. It was the 3ER who spoke to Varys in the flames which inspired his betrayal. The 3ER created the Mad Queen - to burn them all as his final play to become the king of Westeros. The 3ER will be king for the rest of eternity switching hosts to consolidate his power till the end of days.",29,23,False,spoiler,,,,,

***NIGHT KING***  
Three eyed raven had the king of children of the forest. an ancient member of stark family trying to control over all north and land of always winter. that time king in the north are jorahathon stark. wildings had destroyed, butchered and slaughtered. rest of the wildings are accept jorahathon stark as a king. when the most of the north conquered jorahathon moved his eyes to the land of always winter. lands of always winter are the area of westeros which always have winter and too much cold that normal people can't live there, can't reach there because only cold blooded people are capable live there, the people no one knows how they look, what they eat, what power they have, no body knows. some people and armies had try to go there but nobody returns. no one knows what happens to them, is they alive or die? no body knows. many people think ghost live there, many thinks gods live there. no body have map of that part of westeros. that time seven kingdom does not exist. only three kings rules over there with each others help and without war and bloody history. jorahathon stark conquered too much land and became more powerful king the north ever have and the westeros too. but when someone have too much power then the possibility of conquering everything has boosted. but jorahthon stark not interested in ruling westrous he is more concerned about conquering land of always winter and all north. so he decided to go and conquer land of always winter. he had gathered many strongest knights in the north with the help of other kings. he sent that force in the lands of always winters and nobody returns. all the westeros laughing at him. after too much embarrassment he take an oath to conquer that part for the westeros. now this is the true purpose of his life. he decide to gather hundreds of witches in westeros but witches had banned in this continent. but he is determined about his oath. he traveled all westeros to convince that this is for the westeros. after two years they decide to give him a permission to bring witches in westeros with only term that he need to send them back when the work done. he agree on it. people had heard some witches can see future, past and everything. but all people believes one thing that all witches always have negative powers. asos always defame about the witches part in their kingdom's. but jorahathon stark wanted to bring them anyway and anyhow. and he succeed. hundreds of witches gathers in north. some of them capable of seeing sight. perhaps they have an extraordinary powers that they never wanted to rule. they always wanted to serve their purpose and power. but some of them pretty dangerous. jorathon stark gives 1 month to all witches to bring all the useful information about the lands of always winter. but witches always works threw the memory. they can't see that part of westeros because nobody alive to tell and see as a memory. so witch comes with the idea of entering that part with one person has a strongest bloodline. jorahathon stark choose his brother for this task. his brother name is brandon stark. he always follow his brother and king order. but he had love with a one beautiful targaryen girl. her name was katlyn targaryen. who is daugher of house targeryen. he told her about this all the thing. she never try to persuade him not to go. she love him so much. he asked her why you are not trying to stop me. she said ""because love is death of duty"".  
all witches gathers, big fire set up and the brandon ready to be a cold blooded person. they tell him once your blood changes you cannot be brought back. he is ready to do his duty. all witches started rituals of fire and blood and they succeed. brandon converted into the cold blooded person. he meet his love last time. he slept with her one last time. he was happy and sad. brandon stark ready to leave with all of army. stark army  start ranging towards lands of always winter. thousand and thousands of troops gathers outside the hunted forest and set to Enter.  
children of the forest are only few hundreds but they have magical powers. their king which three eyed raven are capable of seeing sight of the future. he saw the cold blooded army killing many children of the forest. he told them we will be destroyed in some days. cold blooded peoples will come and destroy us. they asked him what you saw. he said i will be king forever but not yours. i will be theirs. every each of you will be dead  and only i left. only three eyed raven. forever.   
children of the forest ask him that ""is future cannot be change ?"". he said future can but sight can't. every each of you will die, i will be king of their, this is the future. as a three eyed raven i can't change it. i cannot able to harm anybody. i am the memory. but remember there is only two ways in life one is good and other is bad. choose wisely. i never tell the future to anyone but as a king of children of the forest, i told you. children of the forest shattered. a leader of children of the forest told everyone that ""We are the good people. always be. we never try to cross the boundary. we never harm anyone until they cross our boundary. we don't want their land. we have powers but we always control it. now the boundary are crossed. they have make a cold blooded person with their power. now it's our time to utilize our power to make themselves destroy themselves"". Three eyed raven ask ""how can you do it ?"". leader tell everyone about what three eyed raven saw in the future. leader said ""we trust our king. now and always. as he said every each one of us will die. we know his sights never be false. his information never be wrong. and he don't want anything from anyone. but he is the memory"". ""as we know he can transfer his soul into another living body if he wanted to. and he said he will rule them. but what about the children of the forest. we will completely extinct from the world. but we will live in his memory"". ""we have the dangerous powers but now we know we will extinct because of the their people. but we will not the only species which will extinct, they will too. they will too be. we will create a dead that will destroy the memory."" leader said ""our king, we always respect you. but you never help us to grow in the world. that's the reason we will extinct"". ""we know if we trying to kill you now. you just moved to another body. you are the memory. memory needs body. what if we will destroyed every body on this land. when every humans of this land will die then where will you go ?"". Three eye raven told with smile. ""you don't know the future"". leader replayed ""you too"". ""you are our king, a very clever king, a honest king. you killed us without your hand. we will did the same."". everyone start shouting ""our new king"".   
stark forces entered in the land of always winter with brandon stark.   
pet stark's direwolfs with them. moving forward day by day. after 10 days of marching they halt somewhere for 1 week to prepare war practices in very cold. at very start of evening all children of the forest attack on their troops with fireballs and their magical powers. thousands of stark army had been killed. every wolf had been died. some of the army troops running from the land of always winter. but the big thing is brandon stark had been captured.  
leader of children of the forest tied brandon stark to weirwood tree same tree where three eyed raven had sits. they had many discussion going on. leader of children of the forest told to three eyed raven ""we captured our death"". three eyed raven said ""yes you are"". leader laughs and tell ""i think you sight was wrong. they can't even scratch one of us"". three eyed raven listen silently and walks away in the weirwood cave without replying. some of children of the forest confused about his silence. one children of the forest told to leader ""some of troops safely go back in south. now they know us. they have memory. they know our strengths. and the main thing they have many witches. now king of the north will comes with more power, knowledge and many witches. also remember three eyed raven never gives wrong information. he seen future that cold blooded people will kill us. they will come surely.""  leader tell ""you are right? we need to make an weapon. before we die, we will make one new specie. more dangerous, more powerful"". they prepare rituals and bring dead bodies of stark army. they made nature's Sigil with bodies nearby weirwood tree. all children of the forest gathers most their power in one magical dagger. leader of children of the forest inserted that dagger into brandon stark heart and he had been converted into dead. brandon stark are dead. his eyes goes blue like ice. they created a dead that cannot be burned with ice or fire. he have tremendous powers. he can able to warg in multiple dead people. he can able to convert fire into ice and make them white walkers. because of warewood tree born, he can see sight. after being born he wrag into dead stark army and started killing children of the forest. children of the forest can't able to compete that much power.  only few children of the forest able to going inside the wierwood cave. white walkers and night king unable to entering that cave because weirwood tree have magical power. dead never touch weirwood tree. in that cave leader of children of the forest ask to three eyed raven ""you never had said we will make pit for us"". he replied ""i told you, choose wisely"".   
after 3 Months jorahathon stark comes with 100 thousand troops, witches and strong weapons. they cross hunted forest and start marching in the land of always winter. they are entering in that area day by day without halt. they start thinking that brandon stark might killed every one of children of the forest. after marching 1 moths they explore too much in the land of always winter. they watch many mountains. many beautiful things and they are had been use to live in that cold weather. they start encountering giants, big wolf and many more weird things. one day they halt in open ground. that night was very cold. winds emerged. night king army siege them.

People always thinks why valyria has that much volcanoes. why that was most active area in both continents. valyria is just like land of always winter. hot place where no one can go. even birds didn't fly on valyria.  katlyn targaryen becomes very lonely in volcanostone. she is broken from inside. she decide to explore the world rest of her life. she went to asos in land of long summer. she boughs three asteroids stones from there. asteroids stone are look like bird eggs with different patterns and colors. asos people thinks that eggs are comes here from moon when the part of mood collapse on earth. they believes some dangerous animals lives on moon, when the moon fallen some of theirs eggs come here but in that blast they can't survive and converted into stones. asteroids stones are not much costly. one ship can fine for that stones. katlyn targaryen heard news about jorahathon stark. that time she had been pregnant and about to gave birth to a child. She was very empty inside. she already knows brandon will not survive on that battle. she started spending most of the time  with those eggs. she feels bit of heat from those eggs. she always treat them like eggs not stones. melisandre a witch come there and tell her brandon stark wanted to born again through your child. katlyn doesn't believe in her. she made angry on her. but melisandre come again and again. finally she persuade her to listen. she tell her ""lord of light wanted your child for the good of world"". katlyn ask ""who is lord of light ?"". melisandre replied ""only true god of the world"". she tells her ""brandon stark leaves you for his duty now it's you to do"". katlyn ask curiously ""how can you bring him back threw my child"". she replied ""only death can  pay for life."" she tell her ""lord of light wanted you to sacrifice your child"". catlyn ask with fear ""what you mean ?"". melisandre replied ""you have to go in vylaria and give your life to lord of light"". she tell her ""you need to give your life to bring back brandon stark"".  katlyn tell her ""i am about to give birth to a child, you need to wait till then"". melisandre replied her ""we don't have too much time. dark energy's from land of always winter knows you are going to give birth to brandon stark. they will try to kill your child."" katlyn ask ""how can i sacrifice my life ?"". she replied with low voice ""i will burn you alive."" katlyn replied her with anger  ""it seems you are one of the ghosts from lands of always winter"".  melisandre replied ""love is death of duty, don't worry lord of light protect your child ?"". after so much brainwashing katlyn ready for ritual.   
they leave for vylaria. she keeps eggs with her. vylaria had been very hot that time. but melisandre control heat with her magical powers. melisandre can easily play with fire. after she saw melisandre's magical powers, she becomes more confident on her. melisandre setup wood stage for her on volcano. night has emerged. she tied her on the stage. katlyn keep asteroid eggs with her. melisandre start ritual. she keeps chants again and again in vylarian language. suddenly katlyn filled with fear. she start crying and begging her to not do so. but melisandre show no mercy. she said  ""The Night is dark and full of terrors"" and keeps chants anyhow. winds start flowing rapidly. sea waves starts hitting on land and start melting stones. the smell of burning water and stone spread in the atmosphere. melisandre eyes filled with full of tears and suddenly stage sparks fire. katlyn start feeling burn rapidly. she start crying and screeching. her body start burning. after couple of seconds screeching stop and voice of crying baby started. melisandre could see the skeleton of katlyn in the fire. she pick the baby from fire and gone away somewhere.   
In the morning Vylaria start cool down rapidly. whole world could see small red comet flying in the sky. no one can had able alive in vylaira before. but now three living things has started crawling on surface in vaylaria. suddenly one weird screech came behind the stone and count start increasing. peoples were right about the little part of moon fall on earth. Now People got another reason not to go in vylaria. The Era of DRAGONS BEGINS.

But I gotta rant. I had Jenny's Song stuck in my head as I got to work this morning. I pulled up the youtube video of Podrick singing it and I just got all the feels, good and bad. 

Ive read countless entries on this sub and others. The general consensus is that the writing was terrible. Throughout the last season I gave the producers the benefit of the doubt. How can we judge an unfinished story? Almost a month on from the final episode and honestly, they really done this show dirty. And it breaks my heart. Im fine with how it ended. Bran on the throne, Jon up north. Dany dead. It makes sense and I accept that ending to an extent.

What truly breaks my heart is partly what theyre leaving on the table and mostly how this last season has really just failed to live up to expectations, and I mean **reasonable** expectations. Like so many of you redditors out there, I spent YEARS with this show, I've rewatched the first six/seven seasons like 10 times. I got countless people into the show. I used Game of Thrones as a pick up line when I first met my now fiance. When the show was in the off season, I theorized. I spent hours with friends discussing what could happen, the politics, the characters, all of it. Too much time by the standards of a sane person. For all of this commitment, this fanfare, what did I get? What did ***we*** get?  Such disappointment that I did not reasonably expect, even when things were starting to go down hill. I really believed the showrunners in their promos before the season, at the end of the first couple episodes about how they were trying to give the show a great send off, comparable to the ending of Breaking Bad. I believed it, and I was heartbroken for it. Just listening to Jenny's Song now and I feel like I'm Jenny, that we are collectively Jenny. Dancing with the ghosts of the characters we loved, gone seasons ago, or this last season, spinning away all our sorrow and pain that is these last few seasons.

Every time I think of how this series ended, I think of this [meme](https://i.imgflip.com/2qf1c4.png) that circulated around a bit. They've taken an amazing show that the showrunners themselves are hugely responsible for, and massacred it. I can only look back on this show now and be met with frustration and sadness, thoughts of what could have been, how it was just pissed away to get the show done with. I am puzzled at the decision making. How did they not sanction a Jon/Grey Worm fight, or more Arya fighting, which we seriously only got like 5 minutes of her actually fighting bad guys THE ENTIRE SERIES.  I rooted for Jon. He was the fucking man in earlier seasons. The way he accepted certain death in the battle of the bastards was a straight power move. But they reduced him this season to nothing more than Danys bitch for 5.3 episodes. And thats infuriating. There were so many seasons that logically should have been included that just werent and its head scratching. The show runners kept repeating in interviews they had enough material for a 70 hour movie, but honestly that's a blatant lie. They had enough material for ***at least*** 20 more hours.

Its just a shame that this wonderful series was so mishandled in the end. I have a feeling the showrunners got distracted by Star Wars and put their own interests (and that franchise timeline) ahead of the GOT material and its fans. The show will still go down as a modern masterpiece. And there are parts of the final two seasons that are truly wonderful. I personally loved the episode of the burning of Kings landing. But in the end, the legacy will be one of missed opportunities. Of what could have been. Of what should have been. Of how not to finish a series. And in the end, for the years to come, we will be left with the characters we loved and lost, letting the greatness of the first few seasons spin us with the thoughts of the sorrow and pain left from the last two seasons, imaging what could have been.  

Sorry for the rant.",12,13,False,spoiler,,,,,

Here are a few reasons I think you still need at least some level of support a the wall-

White Walkers Return - if Im a commoner in the north do I feel 100% confident the WW threat is gone forever? As viewers we understand thematically the conflict is over and everybody is safe, hurray. But if you live in Westeros do you trust some kid with visions that the zombies who almost wiped out human life are gone forever? Has anybody ranged far enough north of the wall to confirm none of the White Walkers are left where the NK was camping? They didnt do anything for thousands of years before attacking, whos to say theres nobody left to rebuild and do the same in the future.

Wildings - Great were all friends now! Well the wildlings were raiding northern houses for generations and generations. Whats to stop them picking that back up again when  our buddies Tormund and Jon die off. Feels a little optimistic that the North would never have skirmishes with the Freefolk if the Nights Watch were to disband.

Wasnt it mostly a Penal Colony in recent years anyway? Okay, so lets say Bran sees a million years into the future and the White Walkers and Wildlings never attack the North again. Thats great! Wasnt the Nights Watch mostly used to exile bastards and criminals anyway? Those certainly wont be leaving Westeros anytime soon.

TLDR: Nights Watch would still need to exist after the events of the show because the threats of the White Walkers and Wildlings might not be gone for good, and it was mostly a penal colony anyway.",25,13,False,spoiler,,,,,

3738,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2019-6-15,2019,6,15,4,c0nykf,self.gameofthrones,[NO SPOILERS] Alternate GOT season 8 ending. A dream ending probably.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/c0nykf/no_spoilers_alternate_got_season_8_ending_a_dream/,dwadewilsonp,1560539208,"How I think Game of Thrones should have ended.

Rather than Daenerys just snapping and attacking the city, Cersei should have set a trap. After the bells rang, thinking this might end in a peaceful resolution, arrows start flying at Drogon and Daenerys, as Cersei has hid scorpions on rooftops scattered throughout the city. An arrow misses her, another grazes Drogon, seeing her last dragon nearly taken out enrages her and she starts attacking the rooftops on Kings Landing as arrows fly at from all directions (Not necessarily targeting civilians, but not taking care as to avoid them). This would give her rampage more motivation, as she embraces her inner dragon, however is somewhat able to justify her actions in her mind.

And its Nymeria that shows up for Arya, instead of a white horse (whether shes real, or just an illusion is open for interpretaton). Rather than being killed, Cersei gets captured by the Unsullied, Jaime dies defending her, while trying to get her out of the castle. 

The next episode, Tyrion is saddened and horrified at the sight of Kings Landing. He finds Daenerys in the throne room, he confronts her about the slaughter, she justifies her actions although is slightly saddened it came to this. She is more so in awe of the Iron Throne. She forgives Tyrion of his treason, and he reluctantly accepts her justification, knowing she now has his sister in her custody. 

Daenerys plans to make an example out of Cersei and invites all the Nobles of Westeros to take part in her trial and execution. During the trial, Tyrion begs Daenerys to allow her to have the baby before her execution, she refuses. In private, Tyrion presses the matter, stating that his sister is evil, but her unborn child is innocent. Daenerys explains, how after her fathers murder she survived and came back to reclaim her fathers throne with blood and fire, and she will not allow another lion into this world to take back its mothers throne. 

Tyrion, now completely losing faith in Daenerys tries to resign, however she refuses. This being the first time shes willing to kill an innocent for her own personal gain, and is in a sense enslaving Tyrion. Tyrion goes to see Cersei, she gets her Emmy winning monologue in, then breaks down and starts to cry about the prospects of a public execution. Tyrion, in a mercy killing, strangles Cersei.

Daenerys, enraged, imprisons Tyrion and sentences him to death, in his sisters place, as a message to anyone refuses to bend the knee and help build her vision of a better world. Daenerys makes her victory speech, in front all of Westeros how she is the last Dragon, and how she will liberate the world, and how all of her enemies will die screaming. Tyrion convinces Jon that shes a threat to his family.

Daenerys, has now crowned herself as Queen, is sitting in the iron throne. Jon speaks with her, Daenerys and Jon talk about their childhoods, dreams, journeys, we begin to remember why we fell in love with Daenerys and how her heart is not completely gone, but has been corrupted by the vision of the world she wants to build.  He kills her, same thing Drogon comes in and is pissed, the loud sounds alert the Unsullied and Northern men, including Grey Worm, who all witness as Drogon melts the Irone Throne and carries her body away. Grey Worm tries to kill Jon, the Northern Men and Unsullied fight in the throne room, leading to a stale mate. 

Jon is brought before the Lords and Ladies of Westeros. Daeneryss followers are on the brink of declaring war on Jons supporters. He agrees to die to keep the peace. He awaits his execution, when Arya, using her faceless man techniques, sneaks in and helps smuggle Jon across the wall. The Unsullied and Dothraki want to search every inch of the country to find him, however Ser Davos convinces Grey Worm there time would be better spent living out the legacy Daenerys started of freeing slaves. After speaking with Davos, Grey Worm lets Tyrion free, as a mercy, he goes on to say that Tyrion is the worst man hes ever known, followed by I make joke.

Bran is offered King, but turns it down, and reminds them of a history before they bowed to the dragons. The Lords and Ladies decide, rather than select a King or Queen, to all break off and go independent, as they were before the Targaryen conquest. Sansa, still becomes Queen of the North, with Brienne serving as her Captain of the Queens Guard, and Tyrion as her hand and consort. Arya, still goes off to find whats west of formerly Westeros. Jon joins Ghost and the wildlings and is happy. 

As Arya lands on the uncharted lands, she finds a beautiful paradise. Drogon, with young dragons fly overhead. She continues to explore when she comes across a slaughtered village with the bodies arranged in symbolic spirals.

1. Direct combat between Night king and Jon Snow 
2. More about the struggle between Jon Dnow and Daenerys. Otherwise it feels like Jon did nothing.
3. After last war, a deeper discussion in the council would have given better explanation for lots of things. Eg: why Jon was not made king. He was not discussed, or even appeared, at the council. Everything happened off screen.  He was a war hero. He saved everybody. He was a good man and the true heir. But he wasn't even acknowledged. Directly Tyrion tells him in jail that he is being sent to Night's Watch as a compromise. 
4. Why do we see only Tyrion talking at the council? Nobody else speaks at all.
4. Speaking of Night's Watch, what is it now? What is its role? 
6. One scene of Bran warging and seeing drogon in some forest, living on his own, the last of his kind would have been good.
6. Something about how Essos is faring since Daenerys left and died. What happens with Daario Naharis? 
7. More about Sansa as queen and Arya becoming a wanderer.
8. How was Bran's small council chosen? Why is Bronn included? 
9. Last but, for me, the most important, more on the tragic love story of Rheager Targaryen and Lyanna Stark. How they met, why they married in secret. Why the lie about her being raped, which started the whole rebellion. Who created this lie and why? That Rhaegar and Lyanna actually loved each other was shown only in a small flashback scene.

Eight seasons in less than a month. That was my goal, and at the time of writing this review, I accomplished that goal about ten minutes ago. So what can be said about Game of Thrones that hasnt been said before? Im sure that much of what I have to say has been said before, but alas, I will continue with my review. 

Ill be honest when I say that I never planned on watching Game of Thrones. Sure what I had heard sounded interesting enough, but not interesting enough to make me sit down and watch the show. Then the last two episodes of the series hit, and the collective buzz from the internet as well as some friends convinced me that there was something to this show, and so, I sat and watched. 

The shows strongest point lied with its characters. Characters with separate agendas, all writing one soliloquy of chaos. That was what I loved the most. The characters. Many characters I loved and many I loved to hate, and I did not feel that there was a character that should have gotten a different ending. I suppose that would be because my favorite characters were left on the board at the end of the series. Jon, Tyrion, Arya, I felt that they got the ending that suited them best and the same goes for the characters that I was not rooting for. Jamie, Cersei, Daenerys, and many others got the ending that suited them. I suppose the exception to this would be Ned Stark, who deserved a better fate. 

At the moment, Im faced with an unfamiliar problem. I cant find anything glaringly bad about the show. Sure it could be a drag at some points, but I felt that was all in service to the overall story. I know that many people agree that the show started to go downhill after season four, but I found the show to be overall consistent with its storytelling. Sure the battles got bigger, the locations more extravagant, but the storytelling always felt the same. I wouldnt say that it was a bad thing. Overall I would say that while the show met my expectations, it never exceeded them. What was good was good and what was just okay was just okay. It was still an overall interesting story with some good moments. 

Ultimately I would describe Game of Thrones as big. Its world building and many characters make it big. There is a lot more I could say, and I may write up other posts talking about what I thought about certain characters. For the moment Ill end things with my rating for the show.  7/10.",16,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

It was the first stark reunion we saw and It was between the two Starks that had the weakest relationship of the siblings. Especially in the books, where Sansa was actually cruel towards Jon. 

The amount of love and emotion in the scene is a true testament to the extreme trauma these two have experience.  Sansa has just escaped the worst abuse she has encountered and Jon was literally just been murdered by his own men.

So picture this, pretty much the same thing happens all throughout the episode, everybody gathers at kings landing to pay tribute to their new queen (the show has had a fair few biblical references already, so this theory adds a few more), this is similar to the wise men coming to see jesus, but not a baby, just a queen instead of a king, similar but not that much. 

Then with every single person of importance all in kings landing at the same time all bending the knee to mother of dragons breaker of chains blah blah, remember the cats of wildfire that were slowly sorta blowing up, like not too much but noticeably in episode 5? Imagine if that every single drop of it that the mad king placed, to literally nuke the city as Jamie tells Brienne in the bath scene, well imagine if all of dannys destruction sets it all off and causes a chain reaction and literally nukes the city killing everyone. This means the mad kings plan comes full circle. This would also leave Jon and Dany alive as both arent susceptible to fire, or at least I assume Jon isnt but this is never confirmed in the show. They rise up as adam and eve of this new world and after all this time dany gets her crown and throne, but no people go lead or be queen for, which is sorta what she wanted, but backwards. She wanted people to love her not Jon, but if there are no people then nobody will contest her right to the throne and everyone (Jon) will love her. 

Then maybe at the end show a wildling running away from a white walker (s1 e1) and just leave it as exactly that kind of cliffhanger?

So, i know this was like, two seasons past, but the Battle of Meereen in the show was nothing like i expected it to be.

While i was (and still am) waiting for 'The Winds of Winter', i looked for various theories on both 'A Song of Ice and Fire' and 'Game of Thrones'. In that search, i found a site (blog?) with different analyses on different topics, all centered around the world of ASoIaF. One of these essay series is centered around the plotline in Meereen, from the arrival of the different major and minor characters in Meereen itself, to the tensions and arising between the three factions inside and outside of Meereen (those three being Daenerys's faction, the Sons of the Harpy, and the Yunkish opposition). The essay series, which the author BryndenBFish titled 'The Dragon Dawn', analyzed the the plotline preceeding the battle, as well as the most likely events that would transpire in the actual battle itself.

The essay has 6 parts, the first of which is linked below, to anyone considering reading it: [https://warsandpoliticsoficeandfire.wordpress.com/2014/02/21/a-dragon-dawn-a-complete-analysis-of-the-upcoming-battle-of-fire-part-1-the-gathering-storm/](https://warsandpoliticsoficeandfire.wordpress.com/2014/02/21/a-dragon-dawn-a-complete-analysis-of-the-upcoming-battle-of-fire-part-1-the-gathering-storm/) 

To those wanting an overview of the battle, this is how the three factions look like at the end of ADwD (credits again to the author, BryndenBFish):

**Targaryen Loyalists**

1. *Factions Aligned with Daenerys*

* Meereen (More on the houses of Meereen[here](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Meereen#Slaving_Families_of_Meereen))
* The Unsullied
* The Stormcrows
* The Free Brothers
* The Mothers Men
* Stalwart Shields

1. *Commanders*

* Queen Daenerys Targaryen (Nominal, currently in the Dothraki Sea)
* Ser Barristan Selmy
* Grey Worm
* The Widower and Jokin (Co-Commanders of the Stormcrows after Daario becomes Yunkais hostage)
* The Red Lamb, Larraq and Tumco Lho (Trained as knights by Barristan Selmy  will likely lead Meereens contingent in the battle to come)
* Skahaz mo Kandaq (will lead Meereens internal defense when Barristan goes out to fight)
* Symon Stripeback (Commander of the Free Brothers)
* Marselen (Commander of the Mothers Men)

1. *Personnel*

* 10,000 Unsullied
* 400 Stormcrows
* 1000 Meereenese trained by Barristan (estimate  probably wildly overstated)
* Unknown Numbers for the Free Brothers, Mothers Men and Stalwart Shields. Id estimate that they might have something like 1500 swords combined.

1. *POVs present in Meereen*

* Barristan Selmy
* Daenerys Targaryen (nominal)

**The Slaver Confederation**

1. *Factions Aligned with Yunkai*

* Yunkai
* Astapor
* Volantis
* Qarth
* New Ghis
* The Company of the Cat
* The Windblown
* The Long Lances

1. *Commanders*

* Bloodbeard
* Brown Ben Plumm[Spoilers TWOW Tyrion II](http://www.reddit.com/s)
* The Tattered Prince (Commander of Windblown)[Spoilers TWOW Barristan I](http://www.reddit.com/s)
* Gylo Rhegan (Commander of the Long Lances)
* Yunkish Great Masters

1. *Personnel*

* 3000 Company of the Cat sellswords
* 2000 Windblown
* 18000 soldiers from New Ghis (Estimate based on Roman idea of a legion consisting of about 4500 soldiers. New Ghis deploys 4 legions to Meereen)
* 800 Long Lances
* Unknown Number of Volantene slaves rowing galleys

1. *POVs present in the Slaver Army*

* Tyrion Lannister

**The Ironborn**

1. *Houses Aligned with the Ironborn*

* House Greyjoy
* Various[other Ironborn houses](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Iron_Islands#References_and_Sources)

1. *Commanders*

* Victarion Greyjoy
* Captains of the Iron Fleet

1. *Personnel*

* 50-60 ships (90 ships set sail from the Shield Islands, half are lost at sea, Victarion seizes other ships on the way to Slavers Bay)
* 3600-4000 Iron Island Raiders aboard the ships (Estimate taken from historical fact that 1 Viking longship held between 80 and 90 raiders. 45 ships remain to Victarion after the voyage to Slavers Bay.

1. *POVs present in the Iron Fleet*

* Victarion Greyjoy

**Wildcards**

* Rhaegal and Viserion and their impact on the battle.
* The Volantene Fleet has not arrived in Slavers Bay. They will be a significant wildcard one way or another.

So yes, the depiction of the Battle of Meereen in the series is nothing compared to the depth and the complexity of its upcoming counterpart in the books (if the books would ever be finished, that is).",1,1,False,self,,,,,

-Actual military tactics are used, better placement of the Unsullied, to hold the front line, as the vanguard, not to mention the catapults are in the far back, and fired more than once.
-A secondary fire trench or moat is created for if (when) the undead break through the primary one, this allows more time to fall back if the first is breached. There will also be a tertiary one around the great hall in case all troops must fall back to allow as much time as possible.
-Now the question is how will everyone escape once falling back to the great hall, this is simple. Remember back to season two when Maester Luwin tells Theon there are old escape routes? Well guess what, one of them is located in the great hall, but where does that tunnel lead? It leads to a nearby river that ultimately leads to White Harbor, where there are... you guessed it SHIPS. The undead have been shown to not cross water.
-After both of the remaining fire trenches are broken the undead follow the survivors trying to escape. The armies end up taking a huge hit, but are still at roughly forty percent, which actually shows a very significant loss of life. But where do these ships take our survivors. The ships set sail for the Iron Islands, which Yara took so they have a place to fall back.
-Also think about it history has a way of repeating itself if you forget it... What are House Greyjoy's words? ""What Is Dead May Never Die"" because.. you guessed it this happened before. Or better yet what if Bran influenced that as well? What if he went into the past like he did with Hodor and Created the words, as a sign of what to do... also what if the long night was just bran spreading stories of that night?
-Anyway not wanting to lose the entirety of the people to the undead, and still wanting the throne, the survivors now head to Kings Landing. Here they will set up a final defense for the living, and to once and for all eradicate the scourge of the undead.
-Cersei doesn't believe the undead army is actually coming and turns them away... Because of this Daenerys, isn't going to allow countless people to be killed just because Cersei will not see reason... Daenerys gives Cersei a final choice to surrender or die. Cersei doesn't surrender, so Daenerys flies Drogon to the Iron Keep and burns it down with Cersei still inside. This causes most of Kings Landing to burn as well because of a wildfire chain reaction. Knowing the undead army is still traveling South they get the remaining people in Kings Landing to the back of the city in a more secure area.
-Here is where more military tactics are put to good use. knowing what worked to keep the undead at bay in Winterfell, the defense of Kings Landing is set up. After the Battle of Winterfell it is known that fighting the undead head on is a BAD IDEA. A plan is put into place for some instances of Guerrilla Warfare. The reasoning: who needs to fight honorably against the undead.
-When the undead army arrives, even with the planning, and the fact that Kings Landing is on a peninsula, thus easier to defend, there is not much success being had. This is due to the fact that the armies too such a hit, not to mention Rhaegal still has not healed from the severe wounds from the Battle of Winterfell. Viserion is wreaking havoc on Kings Landing at the command of the Night King, who is of course commanding this while riding him.
-Meanwhile Daenerys isn't taking the unintentional killing of hundreds of thousands at Kings Landing very well at all... and Drogon is beside her not helping the fight. Jon knows they need Drogon to fight Viserion and the Night King or everyone will die. Jon pleads with Danerys to fly Drogon and fight, but she is too distraught, that at her hands countless people had died. Jon knows that there is no hope of talking reason to Daenerys. At this point all she is saying is ""I burned them all"" over and over, and she cannot be reached with reason. Jon knows what must be done, but is reluctant to do so, because she is the woman he loves. Jon embraces Daenerys, and she continues to only utter the same phrase ""I burned them all"" He pulls out his dagger, and says ""You will always be my Queen."" Jon then stabs Daenerys in the heart, and even while dying she just keeps repeating that she burned them all over and over, until the light finally leaves her eyes. Drogon walks to Daenerys and nuzzles his mother one last time. Afterward Drogon roars in anguish, and spews fire into the sky mourning her. Drogon knows what Jon did, but also realizes it was a kindness because his mother is no longer in pain. Jon now communicates to Drogon that they must destroy the Night King. Drogon solemnly bows his head to allow Jon to join him in what is sure to be his final battle, an attempt to defeat the true enemy of Death. At the moment when hope is all but lost it cuts to a sky battle between Drogon and Viserion, Jon, and the Night King. Tere are multiple flybys by both Drogon and Viserion of breath attacks, and each one trying to at the time of passing claw the other out of the air. One of the flybys the claws interlock and all four start plummeting to the ground. Drogon and Viserion are biting at each other during this free fall, trying to get the advantage on the other. As this is happening Jon and the Night King are clashing blades. Everything hangs in the balance with the free fall that is taking place. An opportunity presents itself to Jon as he Counter Ripostes the Night King's last thrust. Jon stabs the Night king int he heart, which happens to be where the Night King was stabbed , and turned into what he is. After the final thrust from Jon Viserion shatters in Drogon's talons, thus allowing Drogon to pull up mere meters from the ground. All of the wights in the area are lifeless, and the remaining White Walkers are all shattered. The Night King continues to free fall towards the ground. Upon impact with the earth the Night King also shatters. The long night was finally over.",14,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

OR DO YOU HATE IT? Dont you want to know why some people love it? Lets play a game! 

Well its not really a game but you DO get to choose how you want to respond to this post in one of two ways: 

1. youre going to ASK OP why they liked S8 
I am not here to defend a season that yall think is trash. I will not try to convince you why youre wrong to hate it, Ill just answer as simply as I can why I loved that scene, that actor, that writing etc. You ask and I will answer. Not here to convince you. I wont argue with you. Ill be polite and not make you mad!

**Note: you dont have to reserve your questions to me, you can ask any superfan in the thread as well but I cant promise they wont try to argue with you lol. 

OR

2.  ANSWER by telling us what you liked about S8? How bout that finale? Why did you love Bran taking the throne? Did you love the new small council? Did you love Dany even though she was evil and burned everyone? Did you like it when Arya decided to....go...nowhere? Do you love how Sansa is Queen of the North? Do you love how Snowbane lives beyond the wall?
Not even just finale stuff, why did you love THE WHOLE SEASON?! Did you like when Arya killed the NK? Etc etc Just tell us what you loved about any of season 8. 

**note: Someone in the thread may ask you questions directly, or you can add your answers after my responses when people ask me questions. But mostly I dont want you to have wait for a question just to post . I just want you to post comments regardless. So tell us why you loved this season! 



For those who hate S8 you will...

ASK! Ask me, a Superfan, why I love S8GOT. You can ask me why I like a certain character, why I like some of the most hated scenes, and hated character development, or you can ask me about the finale, ANYTHING you wanna ask me. 

-or-

For those who love S8 you will...

ANSWER! Answer by telling us why you love the season that most people hate. Tell me all the things you loved about S8 and the finale. Could be a simple line, or why you like how things turned out in the finale. Or you could focus on characters, the screenwriting, the cinematography, sound design, Hell you can talk about wardrobe design if you want. Talk about how much you loved Sansas new wig. I dont care how small I want to hear your love for the shows final season! 
**You dont have to love everything about it. but Im mostly looking for fans who liked the whole season 8 and the finale.

What they were was essentially feature films with massive amount of logistics- each episode was more similar to a movie than a TV show in terms of production. I'm sure they also had a corporate team with no idea of production breathing down their throats, do this, do that, make Bronn a lord, whatever. I feel like they were rushed- we saw how good the show was at first, then it turned into massive workload. Seven hour long episodes in a year with a ton of special effects is an insane schedule. 

Even if the writing sucked, everything else was awesome and I think the last two seasons still deserve praise for things like costume, cinematography and music. 

Idk. It just makes me sad people were like ""it all sucked"" when really it still had a lot going for it. I wasn't happy with the script either, but the fact they did so much in so little time is still praiseworthy.",67,35,False,spoiler,,,,,

(Note: this includes only Ned, Catelyn, Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran, and Rickon  excluding Jon)

-Littlefinger becomes the overarching villain of the story. He is the one who destroys their family and it is only when the three surviving Starks come together again that they are able to defeat him.

-The White Walkers are only introduced in season 6, making Bran's storyline feel like it's actually building up to something huge, since he is our conduit into the Long Night, instead of Jon. Also, the late game appearance of the White Walkers makes it far less anti-climactic for them to lose in one battle and be killed by Arya.

-Jon is to the story what Bard is to the Hobbit. He's absent for most of the story, but is an archetypal hero figure that appears in the third act to help out the main characters. Also, his lineage isn't built up, so there's less disappointment when it goes nowhere.

-Dany is far more untrustworthy when she appears in the final act. The Starks have finally taken back their independence and now they must bow to a foreigner because she has dragons.",249,7353,False,spoiler,,,,,

I thought her storyline was going no where and was simply in the show because she was a popular character that GRRM couldn't kill unless he wanted a divorce. But after season 8, I must say that I really loved how they wrapped her story and how everything make sense.

In my opinion, Arya's storyline was about Death and Life. At a really young age, she witnessed terrible things. She saw her father loosing his head, she saw the red wedding. So, she chose a path of violence, of vengeance, of Death. She joined a cult of assassin with no emotion who serve the God of Death because that's what she was pursuing. But then, she turned her back on them and returned home. She turned her back on Death. When she plunged her dagger in The Night King, she defeated Death. That was a massive step in the path of Life, but not the last. The last step came in Kings Landing. Arya had to go there, she needed that conversation with The Hound. She needed to abandon her path of vengeance, and she did. She chose Life, for good. That's why she decided to help the citizens escaping Kings Landing. She abandonned Death entirely and decided to fight for Life. That concluded her storyline. She defeated Death, she abadonned her search for vengeance. She's now a strong woman capable of fighting for the right reasons. I think season 8 wrapped her storyline perfectly.

Now, I know what's coming in the comments. I know they decided that Arya would kill The Night King around S6-7, so that wasn't planned from the beginning. But I still think they took the right decision. As I said before, killing The Night King was a really important step in Arya's storyline. It make perfect sense that she would kill Death after spending 6 seasons wrongfully pursuiting it.

But also, it makes perfect sense if we add the Lord of Light in the conversation. The Lord of Light was fighting against Death, and who represented the Lord of Light ? Melisandre. The scene she had with Arya in S3 makes perfect sense knowing that Arya would kill The Night King (even if it wasn't determined at that point, I know, I know). Also, three men were helped by the Lord of Light in the story. Beric (resurrected 6 times), The Hound (won his trial against Beric/LoL and maybe resurrected) and Jon (resurrected once). Three men that had significant impact on Arya's story. Beric &amp; The Hound saved Arya at Winterfell and Jon is the reason she was at Winterfell for the fight, we all know that.

But also, Beric spent some times with Arya in S3. What were they talking about ? Death. It's also because of him and the BWB that Arya was taken by The Hound, instead of rejoining her family and get murdered. The Hound also spent a lot of times with Arya. He fought for her. He protected her. He showed her how to survive alone. But he also showed her that mercy is a thing. One thing that helped her leaving the path of Death. (Her mercy for Lady Crane) Jon gave Needle to Arya, which basically pushes her to start training and become a good fighter. Needle is also what stopped Arya from going forward in the path of Death. She was supposed to become No One, forget her identity, but she wasn't able to throw away Needle. Needle is what kept her in the right path. It's what reminded her of her home and who she is.

So, I know that Arya killing The Night King wasn't something they always knew would happen, but I think it was the right decision. They managed to surprise us while not throwing away the narrative of the past seasons. Even better, everything lines up almost perfectly within Arya's storyline. Almost everyone who had an impact on her story were related to the Night King and Death. It wasn't simply a shocking moment just for the sake of shocking the viewers. It was something that needed to happen for the sake of Arya's storyline and something that totally makes sense in the story.

Sorry for the wall of text, just wanted to share my opinion on this. I'm seeing a lot of people asking what was the point of Arya becoming a faceless man. In my opinion, it wasn't to learn a cool ability. It had nothing to do with the ability of changing faces. It was her going down a path of vengeance, of Death. She used her ability once to avenge her family, but then she left that path, so it makes sense to not see Arya use that ability anymore.

TL;DR: Season 8 made Arya's storyline a lot more interesting and wrapped it up perfectly. Killing the Night King was also needed for her storyline.",9,12,False,spoiler,,,,,

## What is the best parts of Season 8?



I just finished watching the final season of Game of Thrones... And I don't like it. With all the plot lines that went nowhere, the rushed pacing, and the fact that what I considered for a very long time the greatest TV show ever went out on a whimper to be one of the most frustrating things to happen in TV history

But with that being said, I still have a few moments from the season I actually loved. Here is a list of them...

Good Things

The first 2 episodes

Episode 3 (Minus the ending)

The performances (Especial Emilia Clarke's Emmy worthy turn as Daenerys)

The Effects

The Music

The Cinematography

The (few) genuinely emotional moments

3985,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2019-6-16,2019,6,16,10,c14egc,self.gameofthrones,[No Spoilers] What is the Best Part of Season 8?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/c14egc/no_spoilers_what_is_the_best_part_of_season_8/,Vwgames49,1560646836," I just finished watching the final season of Game of Thrones... And I did not like it. 

&amp;#x200B;

With all the plot lines that went nowhere, the rushed pacing, and the fact that what I consider the greatest TV show ever went out on a whimper to be one of the most frustrating things to happen in TV history

&amp;#x200B;

But with that being said, I still have a few moments from the season I actually loved. Here is a list of them...

&amp;#x200B;

Good Things

&amp;#x200B;

The first 2 episodes

Episode 3 (Minus the ending)

The performances (Especial Emilia Clarke's Emmy worthy turn as Daenerys)

The Effects

The Music

The Cinematography (and a ton of AMAZING shots)

The (few) genuinely emotional moments

The Action and Battles

I think the Raptors had a really awesome championship run, especially their path to the Finals as it had so many ups and down. (Im reposting this as I messed up because I use old reddit and I didnt realize that the format looked awful on the re-design and I changed some things around) 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Orlando Magic\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

The Raptors had a very tough first round matchup in the East by going up against the Magic. The Magic were coming into the series as one of the hottest teams in the league and were great defensively. In game 1, the Raptors struggled and ended up losing on a buzzer beater to \[ex-Raptor D.J. Augustin\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v\_favmZdarA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_favmZdarA)). This was just the start of adversity for the Raptors as it was a surprise for them to drop game 1. However, I feel that this was the best thing that could happen to the Raptors because it was the gut punch that woke the team up. The Raptors were able to take care of business and ended up winning 4 straight against the Magic. This was tied for the least amount of games to win a post season series in franchise history.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Philadelphia 76ers\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

The Raptors again had the toughest second round matchup in the East by going up against the Sixers. This was a rematch of a series that took place 18 years ago where Vince Carter missed a \[game winning shot\] ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPNzd\_2ifKE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPNzd_2ifKE)) that could have taken the Raptors to the ECF. In game 1, the Raps pretty much had control of the game largely in part because \[Kawhi and Pascal combined for 74 points\]([https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bi6e9v/pascal\_siakam\_and\_kawhi\_leonard\_outscored\_the/](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bi6e9v/pascal_siakam_and_kawhi_leonard_outscored_the/)), outscoring the 76ers starters 74-71. In game 2, Brett Brown made some great adjustments. He put Embiid on Pascal and had Simmons as Kawhis primary defender. Pascal did not have a very good game going 9-25 and Jimmy Butler had 30 points, which was a massive difference from the 10 points he scored in the first game. The Raptors had a poor shooting night going 10-37 from 3 and lost the game. Game 3 was an interesting game. The Sixers were playing well in the first half and Simmons \[elbows Lowry in the balls\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KepdO3XSMMM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KepdO3XSMMM)) which somehow went uncalled. After that, it felt like the Sixers had control of the game. Pascal was frustrated and tried to \[trip Embiid\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXZgrC3o10U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXZgrC3o10U)). The 76ers continued to make the lead even bigger and Embiid was \[celebrating and having a lot of fun\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftUvdQflGoE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftUvdQflGoE)). The Raps ended up losing by 21 going down 2-1, where Chris Broussard called the \[Raptors and Canada soft\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEtehKfrNI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEtehKfrNI)). Game 4 was a very close, grind out game that Kawhi completely took over. He made this \[insane 3 over Embiid\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3avcd1jaunU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3avcd1jaunU)) which put the Raps up by 4 and was basically the dagger. Kawhi finished with 39 points on 13/20 shooting with 14 rebounds. In game 5, all of the Raptors stepped up with 6 Raps in double figures and they blew out the Sixers by 36 points. It seemed like the Raps were going to win the series with all this momentum. However in game 6, the Raptors didnt play with the same intensity and the Sixers were able to take the game with ease. The game wasnt as close as the score suggested. Game 7 was a back and forth game until the very end. It ended with an epic \[Kawhi Leonard 4 bounce game winner\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChT3ewZXTfM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChT3ewZXTfM)). This was one of the greatest moments in Raptors history and was just the start of the history being made. Kawhi had a ridiculous series against the Sixers with averages of 34.7/9.9/4.0 on an efficient .540/.309/87.1. Kawhi probably had one of the greatest series and carry jobs. I believe that this series really wore down Kawhi because you could noticeably see him limping more in the following series.   
   
 

\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Milwaukee Bucks\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

The Raptors were then going up against the Bucks who had the best record in the league with almost a week of rest and were \[favoured in this series\]([https://www.espn.com/nba/story/\_/id/26740169/2019-nba-playoffs-experts-predictions-warriors-blazers-bucks-raptors-series](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/26740169/2019-nba-playoffs-experts-predictions-warriors-blazers-bucks-raptors-series)). In game 1 through the first 3 quarters, the Raptors were in control of the game. However, the Raps had a really bad 4th quarter getting outscored 32-17, and lost the game where the Bucks shot 11/44 from 3. Unfortunately, the Raps wasted an incredible Lowry performance where he went for 30 points on 10/15 shooting with 7 3s. In game 2, the Bucks cruised through the game going on to win by 22 points. The Raps were down 0-2 which led to a lot of skepticism, such as \[the Raptors dont have enough firepower to beat the Bucks\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EL-KQIxfXs4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EL-KQIxfXs4)). In the post game when asked about where the Raps go from here, Kawhi says \[Im going to Toronto for game 3\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dh2UdgxNoU0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dh2UdgxNoU0)). The thing I didnt understand about this negativity was that the Bucks were able to protect homecourt and won both games as the home team, like they are supposed to do. Game 3 was a close game to the very end. Lowry fouled out in the 4th with around 6 minutes left and it was up to a struggling FVV to take over for him. Pascal was fouled with the Raps up 2 and \[misses both free throws\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9uaY1w0uFE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9uaY1w0uFE)). Middelton ends up making a layup and the game goes to OT. This game ends up going to 2OT where Pascal gets some redemption and makes 2 free throws which iced the game. Pascal \[apologized to Leonard after the game\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8s3kzR29N60](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8s3kzR29N60)) as Kawhi played an hour of basketball. Game 4 the Raps got contribution from their bench which would be a trend for the rest of the playoffs. The Raptors bench outscored the Bucks 48-23 and the Raptors won by 18. In game 5, the Raptors were down 14 early, but were able to make a comeback. Kawhi had 14 points in the 4th and FVV recovered from his horrendous Magic and Sixers series in which he finished with 21 points and 7 3s. It became a series as the road team got their first win and this was the first time the bucks lost 3 games in a row this season. This is when Kawhi had responded to the question of how do you beat the Bucks 4 times in a row? with \[I dont know, I havent done it yet\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTFswSUQkTo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTFswSUQkTo)). In game 6, the Bucks had a good control of the game as they were up by 15 near the end of the 3rd. However, this did not stop the Raptors and they made a push to come back in the game. The Raps went on a 39-18 run in the final 14 minutes. Kawhi had this \[monster dunk on Giannis\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYqJhoJaM4Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYqJhoJaM4Q)) that was reminiscent of this \[DeMar dunk\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdNY0x5vkFk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdNY0x5vkFk)). The Bucks were a good team but unfortunately Budenholzer did not make any major adjustments when the Raps utilized a 3-2 zone. This ultimately costed them the series and Gianniss production was worse in this series than the last 2. The Raptors advanced to the NBA Finals for the first time in franchise history.   

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Golden State Warriors\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

The Raptors then went up against the back-to-back champion Warriors. The Warriors had over a week of rest as they were able to sweep the Blazers, coming back from 3 straight 17 point leads. Like the Bucks, the Warriors were the favourites, but this time even \[heavier favourites\]([https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-finals-predictions-for-warriors-vs-raptors-toronto-proves-experts-wrong-by-besting-golden-state-for-the-title/](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-finals-predictions-for-warriors-vs-raptors-toronto-proves-experts-wrong-by-besting-golden-state-for-the-title/)). The return of Kevin Durant was a mystery. In game 1, the Raptors had control throughout the game. Marc Gasol probably had his best game as a Raptor, finishing with 20 points and Pascal had a playoff career high of 32 points. Game 2 was close at the half. Unfortunately, the inevitable 3rd quarter Warriors arrived and outscored the Raps 34-21.  In the 4th Klay gets his \[hamstring injured\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lg0L3NoShmU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lg0L3NoShmU)) and was out for the rest of the game. This led to the Raptors playing a \[box and 1 defense\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbBrYfmYZmE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbBrYfmYZmE)) and the game was close. However, this led to an Andre Igoudala \[dagger 3\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9a5WibTZi8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9a5WibTZi8)) and the Warriors get the win. This led to some Klay \[trash talk\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvtO-ysC2fk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvtO-ysC2fk)). As well, Kevon Looney gets \[bulldozed by Kawhi\]( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdsoLheuiA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdsoLheuiA)) and he is able to play through that excruciating pain for the rest of the series. In game 3, the Warriors were shorthanded as Klay didnt play because the Warriors wanted to take precautions with his injury. The Raptors had control of this game throughout, although Steph had a playoff career high 47 points. Kyle Lowry also handled being \[shoved\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DG1c9-pr\_3U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DG1c9-pr_3U)) by a Warriors part-owner very well. In game 4, Klay returned and the game was close at halftime. The Raps were able to outscore the Warriors 37-21 in the 3rd quarter and were able to win the game. FVV took this \[brutal elbow\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXd8uKc3\_gw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXd8uKc3_gw)) to the face in the 4th. Kawhi had a Finals career high of 36 points and Serge Ibaka chipped in with 20 points. This time the Warriors were on the other end of 3-1 lead. With all the mysteries surrounding KDs impending return, he was back for game 5. Kevin Durant looked like his old self returning from injury, scoring a quick 11 points on 3/5 shooting and the Warriors looked like the team we thought at the beginning of the year was unbeatable. But he was playing heavy minutes at the start and unfortunately he ended up \[rupturing his Achilles\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBDikME-bf0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBDikME-bf0)). It was not a good look for Raptors fans as they were cheering, for instance the \[home crowd\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqsNTRzqCSQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqsNTRzqCSQ)) and \[Jurassic Park\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP3-XJzUWwc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP3-XJzUWwc)). The game was close until the very end and the Raps were actually were up 6 with 2 and a half minutes in the game. Unfortunately Nick Nurse called a momentum stopping timeout that led to a 9-2 run for the Warriors to end the game.  The Raptors had a chance to win the game, but Draymond had an incredible \[game saving block\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kDfonLPeo0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kDfonLPeo0)) on Lowrys corner 3. In game 6, it was close throughout. Kyle Lowry started off hot with 11 points and vintage Game 6 Klay showed up again. Lowry had 21 points at the half and Klay had 18. It was a back and forth again and Klay was on fire still as he had 10 points in the 3rd. Unfortunately, he then \[tears his ACL\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF\_zSEbNL0c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF_zSEbNL0c)) but is able to heroically come back and sink \[both free throws\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqeH7D5V3A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqeH7D5V3A)). Klay was having an insane game with 30 points on 8/12 shooting and 10/10 from the line. The game continued to be back and fourth and Fred VanVleet continued to be deadly with 12 4th quarter points. With the Raptors up 1 with around 11 seconds left, Danny Green gets a \[crucial turnover\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er1X1veuV0Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er1X1veuV0Q)). The Warriors get the ball back and Draymond makes a great saving pass to Steph who misses the \[game winning 3\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMDwvWUNTU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMDwvWUNTU)). Following the miss, Draymond Green does a \[Chris Webber\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4USsy7RWN8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4USsy7RWN8)) and gets a technical which seals the game. The Raptors win the Championship for the first time in franchise history and Kawhi wins \[Finals MVP\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-Ra2AJNrPQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-Ra2AJNrPQ)). Kawhi had an incredible post season with averages of 30.5/9.1/3.9 on .490/.379/.884 shooting. He finished 3rd all time in points in a single post season with 732.

\*\*Conclusion\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

This was an incredible run the Raps made to get their first championship. It all began when Masai fired Casey and traded DeMar for Kawhi. There were so many uncertainties with this and we didnt even know if Kawhi would commit and play in Toronto. Masai gambled again and traded for Marc Gasol by giving up depth and fan favourites JV, Delon and CJ. I think it is unfair that people are making the Raps championship seem lesser than it is because the Warriors were injured. They had the toughest road to get to the Finals and injuries are a part of the game. A championship is a championship.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

**Orlando Magic**

The Raptors had a very tough first round matchup in the East by going up against the Magic.  The Magic were coming into the series as one of the hottest teams in the league and were great defensively.  In game 1, the Raptors struggled and ended up losing on a buzzer beater to [ex-Raptor D.J. Augustin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_favmZdarA).  This was just the start of adversity for the Raptors as it was a surprise for them to drop game 1.  However, I feel that this was the best thing that could happen to the Raptors because it was the gut punch that woke the team up.  The Raptors were able to take care of business and ended up winning 4 straight against the Magic.  This was tied for the least amount of games to win a post season series in franchise history.

**Philadelphia 76ers**

The Raptors again had the toughest second round matchup in the East by going up against the Sixers.  This was a rematch of a series that took place 18 years ago where Vince Carter missed a [game winning shot] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPNzd_2ifKE) that could have taken the Raptors to the ECF.  In game 1, the Raps pretty much had control of the game largely in part because [Kawhi and Pascal combined for 74 points](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bi6e9v/pascal_siakam_and_kawhi_leonard_outscored_the/), outscoring the 76ers starters 74-71.   In game 2, Brett Brown made some great adjustments. He put Embiid on Pascal and had Simmons as Kawhis primary defender. Pascal did not have a very good game going 9-25 and Jimmy Butler had 30 points, which was a massive difference from the 10 points he scored in the first game.  The Raptors had a poor shooting night going 10-37 from 3 and lost the game.  Game 3 was an interesting game.  The Sixers were playing well in the first half and Simmons [elbows Lowry in the balls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KepdO3XSMMM) which somehow went uncalled.  After that, it felt like the Sixers had control of the game.  Pascal was frustrated and tried to [trip Embiid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXZgrC3o10U).  The 76ers continued to make the lead even bigger and Embiid was [celebrating and having a lot of fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftUvdQflGoE).  The Raps ended up losing by 21 going down 2-1, where Chris Broussard called the [Raptors and Canada soft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEtehKfrNI). Game 4 was a very close, grind out game that Kawhi completely took over.  He made this [insane 3 over Embiid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3avcd1jaunU) which put the Raps up by 4 and was basically the dagger.   Kawhi finished with 39 points on 13/20 shooting with 14 rebounds.  In game 5, all of the Raptors stepped up with 6 Raps in double figures and they blew out the Sixers by 36 points.  It seemed like the Raps were going to win the series with all this momentum.  However in game 6, the Raptors didnt play with the same intensity and the Sixers were able to take the game with ease.  The game wasnt as close as the score suggested.  Game 7 was a back and forth game until the very end.  It ended with an epic [Kawhi Leonard 4 bounce game winner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChT3ewZXTfM).  This was one of the greatest moments in Raptors history and was just the start of the history being made.  Kawhi had a ridiculous series against the Sixers with averages of 34.7/9.9/4.0 on an efficient .540/.309/87.1.  Kawhi probably had one of the greatest series and carry jobs.  I believe that this series really wore down Kawhi because you could noticeably see him limping more in the following series.

**Milwaukee Bucks**

The Raptors were then going up against the Bucks who had the best record in the league with almost a  week of rest and were [favoured in this series](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/26740169/2019-nba-playoffs-experts-predictions-warriors-blazers-bucks-raptors-series).  In game 1 through the first 3 quarters, the Raptors were in control of the game.  However, the Raps had a really bad 4th quarter getting outscored 32-17, and lost the game where the Bucks shot 11/44 from 3.  Unfortunately, the Raps wasted an incredible Lowry performance where he went for 30 points on 10/15 shooting with 7 3s.  In game 2, the Bucks cruised through the game going on to win by 22 points.  The Raps were down 0-2 which led to a lot of skepticism, such as [the Raptors dont have enough firepower to beat the Bucks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EL-KQIxfXs4).  In the post game when asked about where the Raps go from here, Kawhi says [Im going to Toronto for game 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dh2UdgxNoU0).  The thing I didnt understand about this negativity was that the Bucks were able to protect homecourt and won both games as the home team, like they are supposed to do.  Game 3 was a close game to the very end. Lowry fouled out in the 4th with around 6 minutes left and it was up to a struggling FVV to take over for him. Pascal was fouled with the Raps up 2 and [misses both free throws](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9uaY1w0uFE). Middelton ends up making a layup and the game goes to OT.  This game ends up going to 2OT where Pascal gets some redemption and makes 2 free throws which iced the game.  Pascal [apologized to Leonard after the game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8s3kzR29N60) as Kawhi played an hour of basketball.  Game 4 the Raps got contribution from their bench which would be a trend for the rest of the playoffs.  The Raptors bench outscored the Bucks 48-23 and the Raptors won by 18.  In game 5, the Raptors were down 14 early, but were able to make a comeback.  Kawhi had 14 points in the 4th and FVV recovered from his horrendous Magic and Sixers series in which he finished with 21 points and 7 3s.  It became a series as the road team got their first win and this was the first time the bucks lost 3 games in a row this season.  This is when Kawhi had responded to the question of how do you beat the Bucks 4 times in a row? with [I dont know, I havent done it yet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTFswSUQkTo).  In game 6, the Bucks had a good control of the game as they were up by 15 near the end of the 3rd.  However, this did not stop the Raptors and they made a push to come back in the game. The Raps went on a 39-18 run in the final 14 minutes.  Kawhi had this [monster dunk on Giannis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYqJhoJaM4Q) that was reminiscent of this [DeMar dunk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdNY0x5vkFk).  The Bucks were a good team but unfortunately Budenholzer did not make any major adjustments when the Raps utilized a 3-2 zone. This ultimately costed them the series and Gianniss production was worse in this series than the last 2.  The Raptors advanced to the NBA Finals for the first time in franchise history.

**Golden State Warriors**

The Raptors then went up against the back-to-back champion Warriors.  The Warriors had over a week of rest as they were able to sweep the Blazers, coming back from 3 straight 17 point leads.  Like the Bucks, the Warriors were the favourites, but this time even [heavier favourites](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-finals-predictions-for-warriors-vs-raptors-toronto-proves-experts-wrong-by-besting-golden-state-for-the-title/).  The return of Kevin Durant was a mystery.  In game 1, the Raptors had control throughout the game.  Marc Gasol probably had his best game as a Raptor, finishing with 20 points and Pascal had a playoff career high of 32 points.  Game 2 was close at the half.  Unfortunately, the inevitable 3rd quarter Warriors arrived and outscored the Raps 34-21.   In the 4th Klay gets his [hamstring injured](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lg0L3NoShmU) and was out for the rest of the game.  This led to the Raptors playing a [box and 1 defense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbBrYfmYZmE) and the game was close.  However, this led to an Andre Igoudala [dagger 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9a5WibTZi8) and the Warriors get the win.  This led to some Klay [trash talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvtO-ysC2fk).  As well, Kevon Looney gets [bulldozed by Kawhi]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdsoLheuiA) and he is able to play through that excruciating pain for the rest of the series.  In game 3, the Warriors were shorthanded as Klay didnt play because the Warriors wanted to take precautions with his injury.  The Raptors had control of this game throughout, although Steph had a playoff career high 47 points.  Kyle Lowry also handled being [shoved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DG1c9-pr_3U) by a Warriors part-owner very well. In game 4, Klay returned and the game was close at halftime.  The Raps were able to outscore the Warriors 37-21 in the 3rd quarter and were able to win the game.  FVV took this [brutal elbow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXd8uKc3_gw) to the face in the 4th. Kawhi had a Finals career high of 36 points and Serge Ibaka chipped in with 20 points.  This time the Warriors were on the other end of 3-1 lead.  With all the mysteries surrounding KDs impending return, he was back for game 5.  Kevin Durant looked like his old self returning from injury, scoring a quick 11 points on 3/5 shooting and the Warriors looked like the team we thought at the beginning of the year was unbeatable.  But he was playing heavy minutes at the start and unfortunately he ended up  [rupturing his Achilles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBDikME-bf0).  It was not a good look for Raptors fans as they were cheering, for instance the [home crowd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqsNTRzqCSQ) and [Jurassic Park](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP3-XJzUWwc). The game was close until the very end and the Raps were actually were up 6 with 2 and a half minutes in the game.  Unfortunately Nick Nurse called a momentum stopping timeout that led to a 9-2 run for the Warriors to end the game.

Kyle Lowry started off hot with 11 points and vintage Game 6 Klay showed up again.  Lowry had 21 points at the half and Klay had 18.  It was a back and forth again and Klay was on fire still as he had 10 points in the 3rd.  Unfortunately, he then [tears his ACL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF_zSEbNL0c) but is able to heroically come back and sink [both free throws](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqeH7D5V3A).  Klay was having an insane game with 30 points on 8/12 shooting and 10/10 from the line.  The game continued to be back and fourth and Fred VanVleet continued to be deadly with 12 4th quarter points.  With the Raptors up 1 with around 11 seconds left, Danny Green gets a [crucial turnover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er1X1veuV0Q).  The Warriors get the ball back and Draymond makes a great saving pass to Steph who misses the [game winning 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMDwvWUNTU). Following the miss, Draymond Green does a [Chris Webber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4USsy7RWN8) and gets a technical which seals the game.  The Raptors win the Championship for the first time in franchise history and Kawhi wins [Finals MVP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-Ra2AJNrPQ).  Kawhi had an incredible post season with averages of 30.5/9.1/3.9 on .490/.379/.884 shooting. He finished 3rd all time in points in a single post season with 732.  

***

**Conclusion**

This was an incredible run the Raps made to get their first championship.  It all began when Masai fired Casey and traded DeMar for Kawhi.  There were so many uncertainties with this and we didnt even know if Kawhi would commit and play in Toronto.  Masai gambled again and traded for Marc Gasol by giving up depth and fan favourites JV, Delon and CJ.  I think it is unfair that people are making the Raps championship seem lesser than it is because the Warriors were injured.  They had the toughest road to get to the Finals and injuries are a part of the game.  A championship is a championship.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

And wow, I was not expecting that. Id been hearing how disappointing and anti-climactic the last season was, but I really didnt see it like that, and I really think it did the show justice. 
For a start, I thought The Long Night was fantastic. They really built them up from the get go of the episode, and there was a real feel of menace and fear to them, how they just totally swarmed The Dothraki and Winterfell with ease. And then of course The Night Kings demise. I was really expecting Jon to kill him but it was a nice surprise that Arya landed the fatal blow. 
Then there was The Bells. I honestly dont know how this episode got slated in reviews. It was perfect, but there were twobmoments in particular that hit me the hardest. First was Cersei and Jaimes death. I hate the fact theyre incest but I was so rooting for them, and Ive always loved Cerseis character, as her motives all come from hatred of everyone second guessing her and love for her children. Seeing her break down while Jaime comforted her as the roof collapsed around them, utterly heartbreaking. And then of course Dany finally snapping. Id be lying if I said I didnt see this coming. Shed lost so much over the course of two seasons, and seeing her finally lose her mind was saddening in its own right, but more on that later. 
Finally, there was the finale. Not going to lie, my favourite scene was when Tyrien found Jaime and Cerseis corpses. Thats one of the only times Ive actually shed tears at a show. Tyrien sacrifices so much over the show to do the right thing, and when he finally thinks hes found a good and just ruler, she demolishes a city and kills thousands of innocents along with Tyriens only remaining family. Peter Dinklage gave an astounding performance as per usual. I believe that the ending of the show was a bit meh. Not bad by any standard, but not what I was hoping for. But what I really want to talk about is Danys story arc coming to a close. Jesus H Christ. She went from a  girl abused by her brother to a woman determined to save normal civilians, and then to a warlord intent on taking over the world and destroying anyone who got in her way, because she believes its her destiny. What I find fascinating is the fact that she actually believes everything she does is good. Shes been ruthless before, and believes its necessary, not particularly good. But now she believes shes Gods gift to Westeros, and that she can only do good. If she believes its good, then must be good. 
When Jon finally kills her it did make me so very sad, knowing this character had such a fall from grace. Weve followed her story throughout the eight seasons, weve been rooting for her the whole way through, and now she has to die the villain of the story. Beautifully written story in my opinion. 
So there you go. Sorry it was so long but Christ when I started I couldnt stop. Thank you for reading my opinion, and feel free to disagree with me :)",18,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

From this subreddit and freefolk. 

I enjoyed season 8.  I thought it was a great conclusion. 

Honestly there are only a couple things that bugged me.  My biggest concern was that Grey Worm never got any punishment for all the war crimes he and the rest of the Unsullied committed.  

I was expecting Jon vs. Ice Dragon... and then I was expecting Jon vs. Fire Dragon.. so that was a little upsetting. 

Its kind of lame that Drogon just flew away but I do think it makes sense.  Jon is a Targaryen so I dont think Drogon would have attacked him. 

I knew Dani was going to burn everyone I just really wish she didnt.  My ideal ending would have been Jon and Dani ruling together.

I am a disappointed fan and I thought Dany was set to be the mad queen as early as season 1, as early as the first novel in the series. I was not even any particular admirer of the character because of several characteristics she exhibited - her obsession with iron throne, her belief in prophecies, her god complex and messianic disposition, cruelty and indifference, her nominal values ( freeing slaves), she merely conquered but hardly ruled to name a few.

Game of thrones started sliding since season 6 when the witty dialogues started drying up, the most smart people started dumbing down (Tyrion and Little Finger) but we loved the stark reunion, revenge on Ramsey, Cersei's trial and the emotional season finale... there still was a lot of emotion in the story. Season 7 started showing real poor decline in dialogue quality, the most hyped relationship Dany+Jon was emotionless - it was neither given time nor fitting dialogues, everyone said they were a great couple so we had to believe they were great. The plot-holes started showing up, time was not matching, news and information was spreading in Westeros at internet speed, Little-Finger's demise in Winterfell was one of the most poorly constructed stories where nothing was convincing, it was not a conspiracy strong enough for Game of Thrones standard. Season 8 was a continuation of that.

Every character arc faltered, everyone was out of character, the dialogues were mid school skit level, poor callbacks for the sake of tasteless humor, plotholes in military and political strategies and logistics ( GOT was always good at it), R+L=J purposeless impact-less and emotionless, Sansa's catfight with Dany unconvincing and immature, rushed consummations, Sansa is smart because people are saying so... Tyrion is smart because people are saying so... Jon had no reaction NONE to the life changing news about his parentage, Jaime's regression unexplained, Bronn useless, Cersei's pregnancy useless, Bran's powers useless and the last episode was a massacre.",8,18,False,spoiler,,,,,

However in 315, King Brandon dissolved his small council, claiming that The Three-Eyed Raven has no need for servants. Brandons former hand, Lord Tyrion Lannister holds a meeting with the other former members of the small council, explaining that he will ask all the people present at the Conference of Nobles to return to Kings Landing for another election. Grand Maester Samwell interrupts Tyrion, claiming that king Bran will surely know of Tyrions actions and that any plan is impossible. The small council agrees to lock Brandon inside his chambers, prohibiting him from intervening. 
	The newly named Noble Council decides that the best strategy to prohibit Brandon from becoming a totalitarian leader is to dispose of him and elect a new king. They elect Jon Targaryen and King Brandon starves to death in his chambers. However, as Jon is north of the Wall, Queen Sansa prohibits any southern lords from traveling into Northern territory due to the death of her brother. Therefore, lord Tyrion, along with Grand Maester Samwell and Lord Davos Seaworthy travel west out of Lannisport, following the path described by Arya Stark when she returned 3 years prior with her knowledge of new lands. Tyrion Davos, and Samwell eventually land on the frozen shore having avoided northern intelligence and locate Jon. However, Jon refuses, and after attempting to convince him for several months in the hospitality of Tormund Giantsbane, they return empty-handed to Kings Landing. 
	The Noble Council decides that the kingdom must be ruled by a collective until a next king is chosen. Although they agree that Westeros will be ruled by the Noble Council, the majority of the members of the council, now also consisting of the former small council, agree to each send a representative from their lands in their stead. The representative council ruled for two years until the noble council met once again to decide on another ruler. The north, having just faced an especially harsh winter, was still hostile towards the six kingdoms due to the death of king Brandon, but could not act on their animosity as the winter had destroyed almost all harvests and stockpiles were depleted. The Noble Council decided to elect Sansa as their queen under the circumstances that the representative council would continue to meet and limit the absolute powers of the queen. 
	Queen Sansa agreed out of desperation, merging the two kingdoms, but many northern peoples were angered and fought southern forces at the battle of the Twins. The exhausted northern forces were swiftly defeated, and the representative council chose to abolish all vassalage north of the neck and replace it with a government run by the council. Queen Sansa was outraged, and the two sides compromised by returning Vassalage to Winterfell, and giving the government officials in the North limited terms in office, as opposed to lifetime posts. 
 	Over the next few decades, Westeros entered another period of peace, ushered in by the Queen and the Council limiting each other. However, in 347, the former lords revolted against the councils northern government. The northern rebels claimed that being ruled by southerners was worse than being part of the seven kingdoms. They blamed Queen Sansa who was visiting Winterfell at the time, and stormed the castle, executing her. The death of Queen Sansa led to an emergency meeting of the Noble Council, as Sansas refusal to get married led to a lack of obvious heirs. They chose Samwell Craster-Tarly, a lesser lord but son of Grand Maester Samwell and a good ruler. 		When King Samwell rose to the throne, he quickly quelled the northern rebellion and reinstated the original government. However, in 349, the remainder of the former northern nobility revolted again. Also the second rebellion was also extinguished, King Samwell and the representative council realized that the best way to pacify the northerners was for them to elect their own governors and regional councils. In 350 A.C, the Northern Representative Government act was passed, bringing in a new age of Westerosi politics. Although only a small minority of men could vote, people all over the kingdom began hearing of the new, successful style of ruling in the north.
	 Peasants all over the kingdom began to revolt, and although all the revolts were crushed, lords all over the kingdom began to lose their regard by their smallfolk and  vassal lords. In a few years, King Samwell and the representative council abolished many lordships all over the seven kingdoms, creating a divide in the Noble Council. Although only having met a handful of times, the Noble Council was the true backing of the representative council, and as many members of the Noble Council were no longer lords, new rebellions started to form. In the War of the Council, high lords fought against their vassals, and the six high houses of Lannister, Tully, Arryn, Martell, Tarly, and Connington ended up losing. 
	After the War of the council ended in 355 A.C, the representative council created new local governments all over the kingdom, mainly backed by the former lesser lords. Many high ranking lords and their families from before the war were executed, including those of the adopted family of King Samwell, who was outraged. King Samwell, now essentially powerless without house Tarly, was turned into little more than a figurehead. Over the next centuries, the electorate became larger and larger, and in 643 A.C., the masses chose to discontinue the monarchy, ending the countries long reign of house Craster-Tarly.

However in 315, King Brandon dissolved his small council, claiming that The Three-Eyed Raven has no need for servants. Brandons former hand, Lord Tyrion Lannister holds a meeting with the other former members of the small council, explaining that he will ask all the people present at the Conference of Nobles to return to Kings Landing for another election. Grand Maester Samwell interrupts Tyrion, claiming that king Bran will surely know of Tyrions actions and that any plan is impossible. The small council agrees to lock Brandon inside his chambers, prohibiting him from intervening. 
	The newly named Noble Council decides that the best strategy to prohibit Brandon from becoming a totalitarian leader is to dispose of him and elect a new king. They elect Jon Targaryen and King Brandon starves to death in his chambers. However, as Jon is north of the Wall, Queen Sansa prohibits any southern lords from traveling into Northern territory due to the death of her brother. Therefore, lord Tyrion, along with Grand Maester Samwell and Lord Davos Seaworthy travel west out of Lannisport, following the path described by Arya Stark when she returned 3 years prior with her knowledge of new lands. Tyrion Davos, and Samwell eventually land on the frozen shore having avoided northern intelligence and locate Jon. However, Jon refuses, and after attempting to convince him for several months in the hospitality of Tormund Giantsbane, they return empty-handed to Kings Landing. 
	The Noble Council decides that the kingdom must be ruled by a collective until a next king is chosen. Although they agree that Westeros will be ruled by the Noble Council, the majority of the members of the council, now also consisting of the former small council, agree to each send a representative from their lands in their stead. The representative council ruled for two years until the noble council met once again to decide on another ruler. The north, having just faced an especially harsh winter, was still hostile towards the six kingdoms due to the death of king Brandon, but could not act on their animosity as the winter had destroyed almost all harvests and stockpiles were depleted. The Noble Council decided to elect Sansa as their queen under the circumstances that the representative council would continue to meet and limit the absolute powers of the queen. 
	Queen Sansa agreed out of desperation, merging the two kingdoms, but many northern peoples were angered and fought southern forces at the battle of the Twins. The exhausted northern forces were swiftly defeated, and the representative council chose to abolish all vassalage north of the neck and replace it with a government run by the council. Queen Sansa was outraged, and the two sides compromised by returning Vassalage to Winterfell, and giving the government officials in the North limited terms in office, as opposed to lifetime posts. 
 	Over the next few decades, Westeros entered another period of peace, ushered in by the Queen and the Council limiting each other. However, in 347, the former lords revolted against the councils northern government. The northern rebels claimed that being ruled by southerners was worse than being part of the seven kingdoms. They blamed Queen Sansa who was visiting Winterfell at the time, and stormed the castle, executing her. The death of Queen Sansa led to an emergency meeting of the Noble Council, as Sansas refusal to get married led to a lack of obvious heirs. They chose Samwell Craster-Tarly, a lesser lord but son of Grand Maester Samwell and a good ruler. 		When King Samwell rose to the throne, he quickly quelled the northern rebellion and reinstated the original government. However, in 349, the remainder of the former northern nobility revolted again. Also the second rebellion was also extinguished, King Samwell and the representative council realized that the best way to pacify the northerners was for them to elect their own governors and regional councils. In 350 A.C, the Northern Representative Government act was passed, bringing in a new age of Westerosi politics. Although only a small minority of men could vote, people all over the kingdom began hearing of the new, successful style of ruling in the north.
	 Peasants all over the kingdom began to revolt, and although all the revolts were crushed, lords all over the kingdom began to lose their regard by their smallfolk and  vassal lords. In a few years, King Samwell and the representative council abolished many lordships all over the seven kingdoms, creating a divide in the Noble Council. Although only having met a handful of times, the Noble Council was the true backing of the representative council, and as many members of the Noble Council were no longer lords, new rebellions started to form. In the War of the Council, high lords fought against their vassals, and the six high houses of Lannister, Tully, Arryn, Martell, Tarly, and Connington ended up losing. 
	After the War of the council ended in 355 A.C, the representative council created new local governments all over the kingdom, mainly backed by the former lesser lords. Many high ranking lords and their families from before the war were executed, including those of the adopted family of King Samwell, who was outraged. King Samwell, now essentially powerless without house Tarly, was turned into little more than a figurehead. Over the next centuries, the electorate became larger and larger, and in 643 A.C., the masses chose to discontinue the monarchy, ending the countries long reign of house Craster-Tarly. The representative council soon came to be a parliament elected by all the people of Westeros, and the former nobility also created the chamber of nobles to maintain their fading grip on power in the nation.

It's mentioned a couple of times in the books, book 4 I believe.  That is considered to be the best battleplan in Westerosi.  It's more of a they have no clue how to beat the undead, so they just go with the best battleplan that they know of.  They really did believe that there was no way they can beat the undead.  I think the cavalry charge was altered to make it look better cinematically.  And it does look pretty damn cool.  

  There is a lot, A LOT, going on in episode 3.  It really is difficult to watch more than 15 minutes at a time, without getting lost.  Can you tell me who saved who in that episode?  Can you tell me who was defending the walls of Winterfell as the undead horde climbed the walls?  It's actually pretty cool to think about who wound up on the walls of Winterfell.  I'll give you a hint, there weren't any Starks there. 

  Jon Snow is a badass.  Watch closely what he does during the battle.  I think Tormund says it best, ""He keeps fighting.  He keeps fighting.  Only a madman or a King would do that.""  I think people are getting a little hung up that he didn't didn't fight the Night King one-on-one, but that'd be the stereotypical result.  He did one v. one the Night King on a frickin' dragon.  

  The Night King almost won.  There was nothing standing between the Night King and Bran.  That would have meant the end for everyone.  The Night King was a symbol of total destruction.  It came that close to it.  Arya is ""OP.""  She was trained by the best swordsman to ever live, in addition to the faceless men.  She really is the correct choice to kill the Night King.  I think we can ignore that she appears to fly out of nowhere.  Another cinematic decision.

  Episode 5:  People have been complaining that Daenerys went mad without reason.  That's the thing about going mad, it doesn't really need a reason.  I'll go a step further and say she might not have even been mad.  All of Tyrion's advice had been causing her to fail.  In her head, she was likely thinking that since Tyrion told her to stop when the bell rung, she shouldn't do that.  She also probably thought that since she wasn't loved, she must be feared.  She's the Heart-Broken Queen.  Also, that is how her ancestors won Westeros, by burning cities to the ground.  Were they considered 'mad'?

  Episode 6:  I thought this episode was great, right until Jon stabbed Dany.  After that it got a bit surreal.  On my first viewing, at almost looked like satire of Game of Thrones.  On a second view, it does make sense that things would turn out that way after Jon killed Dany.  Yes, the dialogue wasn't that good, but can you blame D&amp;D if they didn't have the source material to go off of?  They aren't as good of writers as GRRM, but they sure made that last season look beautiful, terrifyingly beautiful.  Should Jon have stabbed Dany?  I say no, but Westeros did end up in mostly good hands in that ending.  

   Let's analyze who is at the small council meeting.  Tyrion's there.  He's smart, he has experience leading, He's a Lannister, but he's not like his brother or sister.  Then you have Davos.  I can't think of a better master of ships.  Then there's Brienne, a knight who beat the Hound in single combat.  An honorable lady.  There's Samwell Tarly, who rivals Tyrion of intelligence.  So it ends up with 3 honorable people on the council, 1 neutral, and 1 not-so-honorable person.  Now Bronn is quick to give money for food.  That's a good sign.  I think he has shown throughout the show, that he's not necessarily dishonorable.  That small council is efficient, and has someone who won't agree with everything that's said.  It's good for leaders to have people who put up disagreements.  Tyrion says, ""I brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a bar.""  Everyone else at the table says, ""Who let this Jackass in here?""

Not enough deaths, illogical scenes, etc.... Well hopefully I can give my remake to yall...

Just so you know I am a huge fan of GoT and ASOIAF, but I am by no means a filmmaker or director. I also am not suggesting an actual remake to the show, but I am just giving hypothetical scenarios to the scene. 

For starters, the scene that was the most odd to me in the Battle of Winterfell (Ill just call it BoW from now on) was the fact that on the outskirts of Winterfell, Jon just sat there as the Night King raised up his army once again. If we consider the sheer hatred and annoyance Jon had against the NK for so long, it would only be logical for him to make a mad dash at the NK so he couldnt raise his army up in time. Then, an epic sword fight would ensue between Jon and the NK (remember, the last proper sword fight against a WW was a long time ago). Eventually, after a few cuts and slashes by the NK, Jon finally disarms the NK. As he is making the final slash to kill the NK once and for all, we see the NK flick his wrist upwards and suddenly multiple dead wights shield the NK from Jons sword. (That needs some more work, sorry about that. But I hope yall get the point). From then on, Jon can be slashing through the Wights and dead people as the NK picks up his sword and heads towards the tree to meet Bran. 

The next thing I would change is Aryas assassination against the NK. Its pretty simple and its also a pretty common revision, but I would like it if we saw one of the wight generals step forward and get closer and closer towards the NK. As we see the general stepping (ideally the camera can focus on his footsteps) the camera pans upward to see that Arya is taking her Wight face off. Then, the generals realize whats happening and race after her. The NK hears this and turns around, choking Arya. Then the epic dagger switch that we all know and love occurs. 

Thats all Ive got for now, but if anyone has any other hypothetical scenarios I would love to hear it.",1,8,False,spoiler,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

I personally really liked the book version of her and found the show's version incredibly obnoxious, despite the fact that Rose Leslie is an amazing actor. In the books, she appeared to be much more fleshed out: having moments of genuine vulnerability and lamenting the slow death of the giant race, and concerned for the fate of her people. In the show everything she did or said appeared to be completely dependent on how she felt about Jon, to the point where she was willing to go with him when he returned to the Night's Watch. Moreover, in the fourth season her only character motivation was ""woman scorned"", to the point where she even had to make a little speech to the Wildlings about the consequences of one of them killing Jon before she had a chance to murder and/or castrate him.

&amp;#x200B;

Show Ygritte, in my opinion, is a solid representation of the big problems the show had all the way until the end with the writers' version of strong female protagonists: constantly belittling and emasculating men who arguably don't deserve to be belittled or emasculated, while the men never stand up for themselves.",13,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

This particular word, though, can be interpreted in many different ways.

The Lords of Westeros probably haven't forgotten that their families were Kings of their specific regions for thousands of years before the Targaryens came. And even if they have been shunted to the title of ""Lord"" from ""King"", it has been only for three hundred years.

They bent the knee to Aegon and his dragons. And even after Aegon was dead, they remained under the Targaryen rule because of fear of the dragons and the Iron Throne.

Even after the dragons went extinct, it was the fear of the Iron Throne that kept them under the rule. After the Targaryens were gone, it was still the fear of the Iron Throne that kept the Seven Kingdoms united. Also, the fact that Robert Baratheon was the son of Aerys Targaryen's cousin helped the succession.

After the finale however, I don't understand *why* the Lords of Westeros elect a new King to rule over the Seven (now Six) Kingdoms? After all, there is no Iron Throne, there is no Red Keep, King's Landing is in ruins, and the King they elected doesn't even belong to the line of the Targaryens.

And especially since the North becomes an independent Kingdom, I just don't see how long the remaining Kingdoms will stay under the Crown. I think electing Bran was a horrible decision, which will lead to many bloody wars in the future.",5,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

Because I will admit, I hate that Jaime was there and simply didnt leave her, and that Arya didnt at least attempt to harm her, but now that I think about it, the more I think the prophecy was fulfilled. 

In the books, Cerseis prophecy is that she will have three children and her husband will be the king and he shall have 17. Granted show maggy says 20 but it couldve been rounding. Anyway, these three children will rule as kings and queens (makes more sense in the books) and she will outlive them. And she shall be queen until a younger and more beautiful queen comes to take all she holds dear and cast her down. And once her tears consume her, the Valonqar shall wrap his hands around your pale white throat and choke the life from you. 

Now, the reason I find it poetic is for a few reasons:

1. Valonqar. In the book, Cerseis hatred of Tyrion is magnified not only because Tyrion killed their mom to live but because she asks a Septa what the word means and is told it means little brother. Only the problem is, as maester aemon explains, there isnt a gender system in Valyrian, as Valyrian is the language of the dragons and dragons are gender fluid magical beings. But the common tongue is male dominant, so little sibling becomes little brother. 

And Dany is the littlest child of Aerys. And a further reason why Aerys went mad was because after Rhaegar, he and his wife had a string of miscarriages and stillbirths, or children who didnt live more than a few months. So he locked Rhaella away and decreed two septas would share her bed each night. In addition, he tortured a wet nurse who he thought poisoned one of his children and murdered her family. And when Viserys was born after he made a pilgrimage, he had all the gifts the lords sent burned, never let Rhaella be alone with him, and made the royal taster drink from the wet nurses nipples. Sorry I know this is off topic but nice fact. 

2. Maggy made a mistake, as did the septa. Like I said, Valyrian is a gender fluid language, so my mother and father would become my parents.  With both, its a second language, so errors are bound to happen. 

3. Cersei was choked. Not in the literal but more metaphorical sense. After all, even if she somehow survived the initial cave in, she wouldve certainly suffocated to death. 

In addition, I should mention that in the books at least, prophecies and futures arent stated outright because thats not how powers work. With jojen, he isnt just told in his sleep Theon Greyjoy wants to kill yall and hes gonna do it once AGT finishes but has to interpret it. Meanwhile, Melisandre sucks not because shes a fraud but because she gets visions in the flames and has to figure them out: she might get a woman who looks like Arya but if shes never met Arya how can she truly know? 

Even jojen states that he simply dreams of symbolic events.

For example: I dreamed of the man who came today, the one they call Reek. You and your brother lay dead at his feet, and he was skinning off your faces with a long red blade. Though we as readers know that hes dreaming of Theon burning the bodies of those farm boys. Obviously he might not. 

Which brings me to my last point. 

4. Maggy wasnt lying and that was exactly what she saw. Which makes the whole circumstance ten times more tragic as she didnt simply know everything. Like I said, prophecies in GOT arent matter of fact knowledge. its like being given a painting of a few differently covered lines and being told to analyze how it symbolizes corporate greed. Maggy probably didnt see Dany having a temper tantrum but rather just saw an older version of Cersei crying somewhere while hands came out from the darkness and choked her. 

So this is why I find it poetic. Thoughts?",12,0,False,spoiler,,,,,
4214,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2019-6-17,2019,6,17,14,c1jtjd,self.gameofthrones,[Spoilers] Miguel Sapochnik Interview with a Ton of Info,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/c1jtjd/spoilers_miguel_sapochnik_interview_with_a_ton_of/,MasterWinston,1560749704,"Miguel Sapochnik (Hardhome, Bob, Long Night, The Bells director) recently did a 2 hour interview about the battles in the final season and I ton of stuff and I was wondering if anyone who listened to the whole interview could provide a summary.

I've heard summaries of portions of it but not the whole thing. Here's what I've heard:

* He was ""visually policed"" on Hardhome. D&amp;D prefer a more classical shooting style. An example of this was (in the Gift) shooting Cersei and Tommen through prison bars which D&amp;D said was too self-conscious and a cut with Maester Aemon after his death.
* He says action scenes today are ""too designed."" He wants to immerse the actors.
* A lot of Hardhome was VFX. And their set was nothing like what was described in the script. Part of his success came in working with the extras.
* After the success of Hardhome, he was given more freedom in the future.
* 17 minute non battle opening for the Long Night: wanted to hold off the battle as long as possible due to battle fatigue and it becoming a remix of every battle they've done.
* He wanted to kill everyone in the Long Night but he wasn't allowed to. They were saving stuff for the Bells, kinda.
* He wanted Jorah to die in the beginning of the Long Night. He wanted the horse charge to be ruthless so people would know all bets were off.
* It doesn't matter how many people you kill. It doesn't matter if you've tuned out. He tried to focus on the characters.
* The sequence was originally much bigger then they filmed and contained a ton of awesome stuff that people would've loved: The specific example he gives is 50 direwolves (he probably means Nymeria's wolfpack). He says that does not make a good story.
* Hodor wight was supposed to happen.
* He crafted a complete story for every character in the Long Night and there is like 20 extra minutes of footage. He gave the actors a story, even if a lot of that ended up off screen so it wouldn't just be choreography.
* There was initially a ""very long"" fight sequence with the Night King but when discussing why it was cut he said at the end of this long battle do I really care wether the Night King can do some ""fancy staff moves"" or engage Bran in character (the Theon, Bran, NK standoff).
* Speaking of Bran, apparently he was warging into animals around the battlefield to help them out.

Interesting interview on Gold Derby You Tube channel

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\-LOVED filming the knighting scene and thought it was very important for her character / the show / women and talks about it extensively (approx half of the interview) - this is part of a series of interviews with Emmy Award contenders and i'd suspect it would be the episode she's submitting so this makes sense.

\-Was happy with her ending, final line etc explains why (I actually really like her explanation)

\-Talks about how much she loves her character and how much everyone else loves their characters and then later about doing work on stuff that ""isn't on the page"" re women's stories (it would be cool if the interviewer expanded more on this as it's really interesting)

\-Said it would have broken her heart if Brienne had died

\-Talks about comforting Conleth in the Last Watch

\-Is diplomatic about the ending (starts about 13:50) - she is well known for having ""predicted"" Bran prior to the scripts coming out so she said she liked it but says she knew it was unconventional and it wouldn't please everyone.  
\-Discusses working with Nikolaj Coster Waldau

During the course of the series plenty of people get beheaded, but out of all of them three stick out; Theons beheading of Ser Rodrick, Robs beheading of Rickard Carstark, and lastly Jon's beheading of Janos Slynt. I think that all three of these moments where purposefully connected to create a season wide piece of storytelling.

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout these scenes there are multiple connections between them but easily one of the strongest in the fact that Jon, Rob, and Theon are the only three boys raised to adulthood by Ned Stark and so all three of them are imbued with his teachings and morals and these scene show them using these morals in there own ways. This also goes on to show how each scene with each of it's characters is almost a metaphor for the characters as they enact these morals, such as Rob being shown to be to much like his father by doing what he thinks is right over what would be strategically beneficial to his war which ultimately leads to it being a mistake which becomes part of his undoing similarly to his own fathers downfall. It's the same with Jon as he enacts justice over Janos Slynt for his betrayal of Ned Stark without even knowing it while still adhering to the morals through beheading him for disobeying an order or how Theon is forced to make a hard line choice between Stark and Greyjoy bringing back up his identity crisis while also displaying his warped version of these morals as he follows the demand of his peers instead of the Stark teachings what he thinks is right.

&amp;#x200B;

This bring to possibly my favorite connection between all three of them which is the music, GoT uses musical storytelling a lot and so where ever its present there's almost always a weight to it. In all three of the beheadings scenes have the same piece of music run through them; singling them out and connecting them. The piece of music used is Pay The Iron Price which is primarily Theons/The Greyjoy theme but used here for its meaning 'to pay the iron price' such as Ser Rodrick, Rickard Carstark, and Janos Slynt do yet again connecting the scenes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now its entirely possible that this could all just be some big coincidence and they just happen'd to use the same music because its a the meaning of the song fit and so did the music, and the three stark raised men just happen'd to all have a beheading scene but the links between them and the nods to each of them I can't help but feel like they where purposefully put connected as three examples for each of the characters and their moral relation to the man who raised them. And even if its not they are still three great and often forgotten scenes with a fantastic piece of music behind them but I do believe that they where meant to be connected together

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;rd The three beheading scenes between Jon, Rob, and Theon are all purposefully connected to make a season wide piece of storytelling on how they where influenced by Ned and how they interpreted and prioritized his morals.",17,26,False,spoiler,,,,,

Just another pointless and disappointing thing, because:  
  
1. The ending was leaked before it was aired anyway, if multiple endings were true, HBO and the actors just wasted their time and budget.  
  
2. Now the show is completely over, no indication of these kind of scenes could be released. No one even mentioned them, I guess everyone, include HBO, *kinda forgot* about it again?

I have a theory, and it, unlike many others, has a solid foundation from the facts that were in the series. Sorry for my english, i'm doing my best. I will try to put together a theory like a puzzle. 

&amp;#x200B;

What do we know about wargs? They know how to move to other bodies after death. This was shown in 3x09. There was a scene when the varg was killed by John Snow, and at the time of his death he moved into the crow's body and tried to scratch Johns eyes. Also wargs can see the future. We were shown this repeatedly throughout in the series. Remember when Ricon and Bran saw a father in a dream and he stood in a crypt? Or when we were shown a flying dragon over the King's Landing. Also Bran dreamed that Winterfell flooded the sea. It was not long before Greyjoy captured Winterfell. There were many such scenes. Enumerate them all does not make sense, most importantly the facts.

&amp;#x200B;

The Old Crow is the Targaryen bastard. He has white hair and wears night watch clothes. Most likely he was sent to the wall in the past, as was Aemon. We do not know the reason. But we have a connection between the Night King and the Old Crow  signs. We will see the first such sign when the Night Watch reaches the fist of the first people. The Night King dismembered horses and made from their pieces a strange symbol resembling a circle. Then we see this sign around the tree. The place where Night King was created. The place where Old Crow sits is in the center of the tree. And now look at the Targaryen's coat of arms... It looks suspiciously like this symbol.

&amp;#x200B;

And now the theory itself. 6 season 5 series. The theory begins here. Old Crow and Bran are in the past. At the moment when the old crow kills the Night King, he moves into Brans body, and Bran takes Hodors body and accidentally fits into the timeline, getting into the past and leaving the message Hodor. After this scene Bran remains a vegetable to the final. This explains the change in character. In the 7x04 there is a dialogue between Bran and Mira. Bran tells her that he is no longer Bran, but Mira answers that Bran died in that cave. And his phrase in the last episode of season 8, why do you think I did all this way?, acquires a new meaning.

&amp;#x200B;

The old Crow wanted to return his throne, the throne of his ancestors. He has been waiting for a powerful warg for centuries. He was well prepared and set up all the events in order to eventually take his throne by inheritance. He successfully implemented his plan and sat on the throne. Well, more precisely, he became the ruler of 6 kingdoms.

&amp;#x200B;

I think that the above theory has the right to life. And it seems to me that even George Martin himself did not see this option to complete his story. This theory fully explains all the events starting from season 1 and covers a whole thousand holes in the entire series. Starting from having a crow on the poster of the first season, ending with strange signs similar to the Targaryen's coat of arms and that's why the Night King hunted for this ""Crow.""

The most interesting is that you do not need to change anything for this ending. It is enough to add a minute flashback after Tirion offers Bran to become king. To show the past of the old crow and how he arranged all the events that led him to this moment. (Your joke about re-filming the final season starts here.)",6,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

I have not read one word of Martins books, I have only watched the shows. I listen to podcasts and watch YouTube videos in which Ive obtained knowledge that are not in the show and are strictly book gathered. 

We are at a crossroad. 

The slaying of the NK was anti-climatic, yes, I will agree. The character arcs of multiple key pieces in this game were brought to an abrupt end, with minimal cinematic visual, I will agree. 

The rushed components of Dany going mad, Varys looking like a fool (which according to book readers is an abomination), the easy death of Rhaegal, etc etc I can FULLY understand that being highly annoying, distasteful, and downright disrespectful to those of you who have read the books. 

HOWEVER

I have been speechless all season. The death of NK was completely left field and I found myself absolutely excited for Arya. I was able to watch the battle of winterfell and see everything, it was at NIGHT they dont have street lights in winterfell btw. Last night was an amazing episode, the genocide put forth by Dany had me utterly speechless and I have never felt more in tune with two characters than I did with Jon (Aegon) hehe, and Tyrion. 

Seeing dany lay ruin to that city against what they believed left me absolutely stunned, and simply terrified of Dany and what she may do. However, shes BEEN ruthless, executing character after character for her path to the throne. 

The acting by Peter and Kit was amazing, their facial expressions of what have we done was infectious, made me feel like I was 9 again and my mom caught my brother and I stealing gum, and we had a MASTER PLAN for that task for weeks. 

You guys are unbelievably overly critical of two men (D&amp;D) who had a road map, a blue print, a COMPLETE guide for 5 seasons. They are doing a really good job in my opinion to finish a SCIENCE FICTION TV series. 

If you have invested unparalleled amounts of time, dissecting GRRMs books, understanding history, creating theories, then yes, YES, you will be sadly mistaken with what D&amp;D are doing to finish this series. Last week all I see is GRRM says the dragons are damn near invincible, nothing can pierce their scales, etc to my surprise I read oh now drogon is invincible and Euron can hit a shot on him WHAT DO YALL WANT FROM THEM? 

The gray area, and middle ground to this sub is non-existent, and I think its time we create it. 

Look Im sorry for the readers who adored Martins work, and if you invested that much time into this story, well quite simply, you probably shouldve waited until the books were finished to watch the show. 

Ive really enjoyed this show, from S1E1 until last night, and I dont expect the finale to upset me. Its been a great ride thus far, and it is on my Mount Rushmore of television seriess. 

Im prepared for the downvotes, bring them to me. I just hope I open some eyes, that hey, guess what? A lot of us have not read the books, we dont know the valonqar prophecy (theory) that didnt affect us watching last night. Jamie and Cersis death was beautiful, (I dont condone incest) they loved each other and died in each others arms, after we witnessed two brothers who had undying hatred toward one another..die in each others arms. Beautiful. Can not wait until next Sunday. 

Thank you all for your time, and lets remember, there are +2M fans in this sub, you guys gotta understand that a lot of us have not read the books and truly do not care about your fan theories, and book references. Its a great show, lets accept it for what it is.",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Earlier  seasons of the show spent a lot of screen time depicting the depth of  the friendship and bond between Sansa and Shae. Shae is the only true  friend Sansa is portrayed to have in the whole show, which is especially  significant since she doesnt open herself up to close relationships  easily. (Brienne isnt shown to have a personal relationship with Sansa  aside from loyalty and duty.) However, after Sansa leaves Kings  Landing, their friendship is never relevant again. Sansa is shown to be  influenced by other characters such as Baelish and Cersei, but never  Shae. Tyrions character is shown to be affected by Shae long after she  dies, but Sansa isnt. Sansa is never seen reminiscing about Shae. Its  like their friendship never happened. When Tyrion meets Sansa again, he  doesnt even mention Shae even though he knows how deep the bond between  the two women is. Neither is Shae ever shown to wonder about Sansas  well being and whereabouts after Sansa leaves.

This  seems like one of those troupes where friendship between female  characters is often portrayed as having little significance and depth,  if existent at all. I dont mean to force feminist ideals onto shows,  but the ultimate irrelevance of Shae to Sansas character development  seems like a pretty big plot hole since their friendship had a lot of  screen time early on. Shae isnt just a background character in Sansas  story. This is a girl who would 100% put her own life on the line for  Sansa, despite Sansa marrying her love, and Sansas only true friend in  Kings Landing. Shaes character has depth and the audience is very  emotionally involved with her arc, so it feels off that she gets the  Dario Naharis treatment (what happened to my man Dario?). It wouldve  been nice to see the show give at least a little nod to their friendship  at some point.",6,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Pretty much from Aryas return to Winterfell and on, their presence just didnt seem to have sensical purpose. It just felt weird and their actions annoying/petty/vapid. I think there may have been some plot holes going on with that. Arya in particular annoyed me. I cant tell if it was how her character was written or if it was the actress. 

I found most uncomfortable the notion of Jon submitting to Dany. As it would make no sense because the Jon that Dany loved was a Jon that was fighting for the North. Not a Jon who would submit. So it makes most logical sense to me that Jon stabbed her. I think it was actually rewarding it ended that way. 

I would have preferred Jon ruled the 7 kingdoms.

The name Bran the Broken is just really cringey to me.  That felt so corny and vapid. I was like wtffffff.

 Bran for some reason really did have an annoying presense and I dont know why. The way he bothered me did not seem intentional. I think that maybe there was an issue with his acting or just the writing of the character.

I did not like that Breanne and Jamie had sex. It just seemed stupid and unnecessary. Not even an interesting addition to story. Just like oh yeah dont forget to make sure every female on set is sexualized 

 In the ending seasons in particular I felt this awkwardness with characters we knew were brought together for the first time (or for the first time since season 1). There was no getting to no eachother phase and there just seemed a lack of chemistry in an awkward way.

 Cersei needed to die harder.

### Game of Thronesa Real TV Phenomenon

The TV shows and series could create real euphoria among the population. Since the oldest times there were shows that captured our attention in a more special way than others could.

No matter if we are talking about Since Fiction series, comedy series or drama, each of them has its own fans. I am sure than many of us rushed home to watch the next episode of our favorite TV show.

Some of them have their own fan clubs and they become an inspiration for theme parties and gatherings. It is like an addiction somehow.

One of the most popular TV series these days it seems to be Game of Thrones. How it became so popular? Did HBO owners ever believed in its great success?

These are just two questions to which I will try to give an answer in the following rows of this article. If you are interested on this topic you should continue your reading session.

### How did Game of Thronesstart?

Everything [started in 2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones_%28season_1%29) and it was an average show with an average number of viewers. It received good reviews from film critics but it was far from being what it is today.

We can say that it won its fans in time. The main budget used was far from being a big one.

At that time no one believed that it will soon become a TV phenomenon and that will win a [best drama Emmy](https://www.dw.com/en/emmy-awards-2018-game-of-thrones-takes-home-top-drama-prize/a-45533265) prize. As I already said it was seen as an average story.

### Game of Thrones evolution

You may wonder, however, how everything changed. It seems that people today are drawn to such types of movies. The stories that reveal a bit of our history raised people interest.

The head and sword films where men defeated their enemies by swards and territories were conquered through endless wars capture the viewer attention. The imaginary characters such as wizards, giant birds, dragons, witches are also a very important part of these fiction TV series.

People imagination is awakening thanks to these characters. The importance and the great influence women had regarding the mens world and how manipulative they could become is another important aspect brought to life in these movies.

One thing that really attracts men viewers is also the beauty of these women and their femininity mixed with a high level of intelligence. These TV stories have the perfect blend between roughness, tenderness, beauty, blood and fiction.

You might say that these things were also used in the past but the technology used in movies so the special effects will appear closer to reality and the high budgets used to create the perfect atmosphere had a great role in winning the viewers attention.

This is what the directors of Game of Thrones did in time. All you have to do is watch the first episode of the TV series and you will notice the difference between what it used to be and what it is today.

### How audience helped in development

Another secret used by the creators of this TV show was to listen to its audience. Even if you might not have similar ideas with them the viewers are the ones who will keep the show alive.

This means that you should adapt to their desires and surprise them all the time. This is exactly what they did. This is not a story where the main character always survives.

What stroked me when I first watched it was that fact that you fall in love with a character and it suddenly dies. You first feel that you have no reason to watch it anymore but you fall in love with another character.

Quite soon, the new character dies as well. The element of surprise is always present. In fact I believe that this is the first show where anyone could die and could be brought back to life when you dont expect it.

After this description you could believe that it is too much violence in it. I will not disagree with this, but it is blended with so many other things such as eroticism, adventure, since fiction and many other things as well that will keep you in front of your TV or laptop for hours.

The [HBO channel](https://www.hbo.com/) has many other shows produced by them, but this one overcame everyone expectations regarding audience. Due to this aspect, the imagination of the directors was exploited at very high levels in order to preserve the standards and even increase them.

The actors grew along with their characters (if they were not suddenly killed). Some of them were affected in their real lives due to the roles that they played in the movie.

They were hated or loved for real because such TV phenomenon could create real passions among its viewers and sometimes they could not make the difference between what it is real and what is not.

### Conclusion

Even if you might think that people might get tired with it, it seems that they are more than interested about it today than they were at the beginning. Besides that, people who might never watched it (if there are any), once they start doing it they become instant fans.

We know that many TV shows had certain popularity that faded in time, such as Friends, Greys anatomy, Dr. House, Seinfeld and I could go on forever. None of them reached this level.

When it is going to end? I believe that the Game of Thrones fans dont even think about this aspect. They hope that the directors source of ideas will never stop.

Feeling entitled to make your own decisions creates a sense of empowerment. Empowerment is the process that creates power in the individuals over their own lives, society and in their communities. Empowerment includes raising the status of women through education and raising awareness etc.

  
Game of Thrones, a global phenomenon worldwide, out of its many lessons, gave a tenor on women empowerment in its elusive way. 

  
For those of you who have read my previous article, the following are the two events that had a significant impact on the survival of House Stark, showed us when difficulty reaches its extent women can go toe to toe with men. One Event was the red wedding and the other one was the battle for Winterfell.

  
Three main Houses, the Lanisters, the Freys, and the Boltans conspired to destroy a single house, only because it was becoming too powerful under a Lannister hegemony. They knew they cant defeat them in a battle so they conspired to decimate it at a wedding.

  
The second event exhibits vengeance taken by Jon Snow for his Family from the Boltans, who betrayed the Starks. He not only avenged his family but also took back control in the north.

  
Arya, the youngest girl of the Stark family vanquished House Frey all at once by herself. She waited a long time to avenge her mothers murder and when it came, she was enough for all of them.

  
For those of you whove watched the series, relive these events as they were the most conspicuous and quite breathtaking at the same time.  

  
The firstborn of Eddard Stark, the eldest of them all was horribly killed at his cousins wedding. He was killed along with his wife and mother. The couple just learned about they were expecting their first child, right before the event and were celebrating along, until tragedy ripped them apart.

  
After seeing her children being slaughtered, she gathered her strength and stood on her feet. For indeed the pain she was confronting now, was nothing as compared to the pain she felt at the time of her life when she was honored with her first ever child and braced it graciously for nine straight months. To see him in this vulnerable condition, among the ruthless murderers she could not bear, something happened. Against all her odds, she managed to walk to the Lord with an arrow struck on her back and one on her leg. Time stood still as the house witnessed with all their conscience, a mother pleading for the life of her child. She had nothing for the exchange of her son's life, except the honor the Starks had for generations.

  
She reminded them who she was, the wife of an honored man of the honored house to which they all had sworn allegiance. She even swore she'll forget the matter as if it never happened, just to let her legacy live, just let her son go. But the Lord said, why would he do that, what benefit will he get, if he spared her sons life? For indeed he was promised gold by the lanisters. The Earth shattered after seeing what its inhabitants did to a Mother of five. The mother saw her firstborn stabbed to death in front of her, those eyes which glowed with full joys of spring when they first saw her own flesh and blood, were just left Hopeless. She accepted her fate and they slit her throat to death.

  
All the main lords of House Starks and those who pledged their loyalty to them, served them well indeed, till the end and died, except for the Boltans as they were the only ones who betrayed them. It took three houses to destroy one audacious house for indeed, they were far too be brave to be destroyed all for once. In order to destroy such a dauntless house, one must have to plant the seed of betrayal and thats exactly what the Lanisters did and used the Boltans, as their bait, whom the Young Lord, Robb Stark trusted blindly, and that's how this great house was pulled apart from their roots.

  
Catelyn Stark, indeed played a strong role of a mother, reminding all of us again that God gave mothers a status not just like that, He had a reason, a purpose that is the reason why He chose them after Himself.

  
The Lanisters, the Freys, and the treacherous Boltans played their game indeed and thought they played it well but who knew, the very same house will turn their worst nightmares into reality, especially as the Boltans and the Freys had no idea, what was coming for them. For indeed when a wolf comes with vengeance, all the animals, not even the Lion is able to stand its ground.

  
The battle for Winterfell was the consequence of the death of Eddard Starks fourth son who was held captive by the Boltans and was murdered in front of them. The Battle was heavily outnumbered for the Starks, as they had lost their Majority before in red wedding, were breathing their last verge of existence when more armed forces joined them and defeated the Boltans.

  
Sansa, the elder of the two sisters made a pact with the knights of Vale, another ally of House Stark, just days before her Valiant Bastard Brother officially declared the war against the Boltans, despite having fewer men, as many of the noble the household whove pledged themselves for centuries forcibly abandoned their perpetual pledge as theyve just witnessed the brutal massacre of the same honored house their ancestors pledged themselves and stood beside this audacious house, for centuries. The Knights of Vale, the only house that responded to Sansas call and succored to House Stark.  As much as Jon played a major role in destroying the Boltans, Sansa played hers assuring the house extinction from its history.

  
Arya the assassin took the House Frey all by herself. She first murdered the two sons of their lord and carved them into a pie. Then she disguised herself as a slave and offered it to the Lord who ate them without knowing what was in it. She then killed him just like the way her mother was decimated, he was slit throat to death.

  
Master of disguise, she now came in as their lord, wearing his filthy face mask as she knew what this thing meant for her, and had to be done. She called a meeting, in which all the members of the house were invited. After boasting their morale for bravely murdering an unarmed house, she won their trust first and then called for a toast. For indeed this toast they all cheered for, was in fact, an announcement for their death. She melded the strongest poison she could possibly find, in their wine. While all the house cheered for the death of House Stark, she also cheered but for House Frey, for she knew there annihilation was just around the corner, seconds later the house breathed their last, as the poison was quite strong to be melded in a drink. It took three houses to destroy one but when a girl, a teenager took her familys revenge, all that rage, that helplessness she endured all those years was indeed jolted down in her and she waited. For she knew her time will come and when it did she maneuvered it beautifully with her grace. She vanquished the house completely from its existence as if it was never there. It was truly a shame for them all. A girl vanquished the whole house and tore it down completely, whereas three families couldnt even manage to eradicate a single house. For truly these families deserved honor for destroying a great house and an honored shame is all they could get.  
Indeed, when the deep roots of honor and loyalty are planted, strength instinctively finds it's way within.

  
The history witnessed two Stark girls, after losing everything they had, wiped out two great houses from their roots, only with their honor and dignity. Reminding all of those who once thought this great house was destroyed, it stands here with all of its prestige and honor. The North Remembers House Stark. Indeed, when a Wolf is invoked to its core, it becomes more ferocious than the Lion.

  
No matter how contentious this series was, but the show conveyed some serious message on the importance of women.  
Apart from real-life examples we see in our lives, this series subtly showed the young generation the potential of a woman, its status and strength through a fiction.

  
Two girls orphaned in their teenage, ripped apart from their family, left alone over a barrel on the society, managed to vanquish two great houses, the Boltans, and the Freys is indeed a prodigy in itself.

  
Without women, the whole human species would cease to exist. She is a daughter, a sister, a friend, a colleague, enters in the life of a man as a wife and helps him to continue his lineage, becomes a mother and then a grandmother providing her wisdom to the family. So as far as the status of men is concerned, women should be given the same importance as they are no indifferent to them.

  
If you want something ask men but if you want things to be done ask a woman.

  
A woman is a blessing for Men. Respect them.

I listened to Power is Power originally then started rotating the album regularly. One thing that sticks out to me is the foreshadowing and spoilers thrown in lyrically, and Im confused about the production process. 

For instance, with the aforementioned track, an original listen might allude to Jon Snows death. But after the end of the series, its a loose narration of the final episode. Thing is, the song came out around the time of episode 2. 

Based on home closely production was holding the plot and ending, and everyone was sworn to secrecy, how were so many artists involved with the lyrics and implications therein? And typically, with a project like this, how does it work?

Were lyrics written beforehand then disseminated to the artists who worked in the songs, and then were they forced to sign NDAs? So, in theory, did The Weeknd know the end of the series before we did? Did they have a hand in the writing?

Just very interesting given the concept all together and Im interested in knowing more about it.",2,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

GoT is a vicious world where alliances blow around like the wind.  Does anyone speak the words of loyalty ""for a thousand years"" with a straight face?  Is this public mythology?  Comic exaggeration?  Where is the credibility that anything *ever* lasted a thousand years, let alone house loyalty?

(which it definitely was not througholy enjoyed, if at all really) than it would be to just pay the $15 for ""H.B.O Now"" 
    Having shitty writing, all season (its the most popular show in a long while... OH! how i miss you breaking bad!) with ABSOLUTELY flawed and utterly confusing character completing story arcs! It forces those who are indebted to the story or more or less the characters, to find a better ending. With that better ending still to be written it all but surely makes his book a must seller, a must read to get the awful taste that was the writing of season 8 outta our mouths and outta our memories replacing it with jucyy apples and grapes fed to us like the book purchasing fans we are instead of bruised worm filled lazy television  watchers we have been the last 8+ years of our easy and at times lazideisical lives...

Northern westeros is based on Scotland/ maybe a little Viking inspiration.

Western Essos is based on eastern / southern Europe I believe. 

Middle Essos is based on the middle East (near the bone mountains that divide the continent ).

Sothoros is definitely based on Africa.

Ulthos is based on.... Well , I don't know, but I would really like to know, because on maps it's covered in black just like the shadow lands.

So what is far eastern Essos past the bone mountains?

Well, we have the great empire of the dawn(Yi Ti) which is obviously based on ancient China and southeast Asia.

We have a nation of nomadic people who ride zebras and have pointed heads. These people rape and pillage and kill people. They remind me of the mongol horde, kinda like the dathraki but weirder.

There's a place that's like oceana, it's a thousand islands where a race of highly aggressive green people reside.

But most interesting of all, is the shadow lands, and asshai. I am beyond interested in this place. It would be so cool to see it and know more about it. Shadowbinders, necromancers, evil fockers, it sounds so amazing.

So, on this side of Essos , they had their own version of the long night. They said that a blood stone emporer killed his sister and triggered their own version of the long night that lasted a generation, just like westeros in the age of heroes. It is said that demons came from the Grey waste, a frozen desert north of The empire of the dawn. They constructed 5 forts to hold off demons that came from the waste(speculation).  They also have their own version of Azur Ahai, the hero who saved them all.

On top of that, there are many creepy things going on this side of the world that are inspired by HP Lovecraft. C'thulu and shit. It sounds so great.

I WOULD LOVE TO SEE A SPIN OFF ON THIS SIDE OF THE WORLD.

The maps don't even cover all of Essos. There's so much more to be seen. Maybe we could find out what's on Ulthos and Sothoros too.

I love the world Lore in this series.

I would also love a show centered in this universe, but on the more Asian styled side of the world. It would be great.

Please please please. This side of the world sounds so much more magical and creepy.",6,15,False,spoiler,,,,,

Perspective in this case meaning just who is in the limelight, what is their thought process. Even as it applies to characters of dubious morality.

I have two examples: the Dothraki and the Wildlings. In a more simplistic (not that thats inherently bad) fantasy, they would be unquestioningly they bad guys, the faceless horde of savages that needs to be destroyed. Not in Thrones though, we spend a huge amount of time with both groups to learn about them and how they see the world. I, for one, didnt even realize that the Wildlings were dangerous until they attacked that farm and the Dothraki were always were lovably quirky. In fact I would say the greatest trick ASOIAF ever played on the fans was distracting us from just how bad the Dothraki were in season 1 up until Mirri Maz Duur laid out what they did to her and her village.

Im not going to talk about The Bells, but Ive always seen Daenerys plotline as a villain origin story, but you could easily be forgiven for thinking shes the hero because she freed slaves, she inspires people, shes a noble and beautiful queen that takes hits and keeps on coming. Then you go back and think from the perspective of others. During seasons 3 and 4 The Dragon Queen flexed her children like crazy and threatened to obliterate anyone who opposed her. She declared war on several cities just for practice, she crucified hundreds of nobles, many of whom deserved it but still, and she destroyed the economy of Slavers Bay by not creating an actual alternative to the slave trade. That's not even the worst of it. Hell in the books apparently, some of the Smallfolk still preferred The Mad King because he wouldn't have tolerated Gregor Clegane running wild in the Riverlands like other ""more sensible"" kings.

So yeah, masterful writing on that count. Do you agree, disagree or favor something else?",12,11,False,spoiler,,,,,

This might be a stretch but he realized after the episode the long night  that the unsullied/Dothraki/Targaryens had access to cloning magic. This is shown as the unsullied are slaughtered to a few dozen and the Dothraki all dead that they respawn a few weeks later. That is why we dont see Sir Davos in the epilogue as the unsullied kidnapped him as to not reveal their secrets. They also had access to the /kill magic as they killed all the Dothraki. That is why they could not let him win. Sansa Stark was apart of this scheme, as evidence aSoIaF RPG labels her a schemer. She knew about what happed and kept it on the down low to remove the only sane person in kings Landing so she could one day conquer the entirety of Westeros. That is why Tyrion makes him masters of ships so he can be kidnapped on a routine inspection of the unsullied goodbye ship. Because Tyrion wants to destroy everything his father stood for including all of Westeros. Sansa also made a power play by denouncing her brother Jon as the lord as he was exiled from the 6 kingdoms though he can still go to the north. Sansa stole his reign. This was all a power play to destroy any love for G.R.R. Martins GoT by D. and D.B. to get star wars to ruin it further with their shit writing, and terrible adaptations. Sir Davos knew all of this was going to happen so in an attempt to fix the world he questioned the unsullied. In his failure the series is forever ruined.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

All the God's have influence over the happening of earth, and the events of game of thrones are just another one of their battles.
The magic granted to humans by the God's are just them setting up the pieces for the coming battles and like pieces of a board game they eventually face eachother head to head.

Targaryens poses fire magic from the Gods and it's so strong their silver hair and purple eyes are a dominant feature that withstands most intermingling with non-targs. Baratheons being of the storm lands seem to be an exception, probably because of the magic of the drowned God who is in close proximity by the stormy sea.
 The lord of light set things up so that his champion, Jon, could eventually go head to head with the lord of darkness' champion the Night King who possesses Ice magic.

In an earlier battle the lord of light/the old god's granted the starks with warging and greenseeing powers which also come to play and also chose Azor Ahai as their champion.

And thats about as much as I've come up with.

To be honest, it took 3 seasons for me to get into it, but I was hooked. I thought season 7 was bad, but season 8 is the worst crap I've ever seen. 

The first episode was good. The foundations were laid. Then, it went to shit. 

How were there millions of dead people? Was the show creators serious about this? Did every person that's ever died join the Night King? Was Ned Stark one of them?

What was the point of Bran being the 3-eye'd raven? I loved Bran's story. They put life and death importance to it. It was more important than Bran's own life as well as others who died for the cause. It can even be argued that Rickon and Osha died for the cause. I swear when Bran closed his eyes during the zombie battle I thought he was the one that was controlling the dead and having them fall into the fire(trench) killing them. But, the 3-eye'd raven was nothing. It was nothing. 

Why did Arya kill the Night King? At the very least it should have been the girl that Bran dissed who helped him. 

Dany's best friend Missandei dying was stupid. The way she was captured, the way Dany's dragon got killed, the way everyone knew everything, the way everyone teleported from place to place. Jon Snow was on his way there, but him and his people must of stopped at a brothel for a month.

I admit, I really liked the episode were Dany destroyed Kings Landing. I thought it was good, but I have a few questions: They made this whole thing since season 7 about not attacking or burning the city because innocent people will die. Apparently no one knew where the red keep was located. So when they did attack,  they destroyed Euron's ships, the golden company and the rest of the solders surrendered. So they rang the bell. Without burning the city. Why the fuck didn't they just do this from the beginning? Also, the Dothraki were killed with only maybe a dozen of them left. More than half the unsullied were killed. Did Dany become the Night Queen and bring them back from the dead?  

What's the deal with that white horse Arya found? 

How is Dany the mad queen? She blindly agreed to help against the Night King, she agreed to meet and try to get Cersei to help, without Dany the Night King would have won, she listened to her advisers while her dragons, allies, and friends were getting killed. Then her advisers plotted against her. Which they ultimately killed her. She was always a loving, good queen. Which is why her army and friends loved her. How is she bad again? I guess for destroying the city and people, but I guess with everything she's been through I can understand why. 

Ok, for the sake of argument, let's say Dany was really evil and became the mad queen. Then how is Cersei evil? All Cersei ever did was protect her children and family. She treated people like crap for sure, but that just makes her a bitch. So Cersei was the good one who tried to kill the evil mad queen? 

What happened to the Dothraki? They have their own rules. They don't follow the politics. So why the hell didn't they kill Jon and Tyrion? Why didn't the Unsullied? 

Why the fuck was Tyrion, a prisoner, someone who betrayed the queen, allowed to grab a microphone and speak for two hours electing Bran ""the broken"" king? Why did everyone listen? Why the fuck did he become hand? How the fuck did he become Dany's hand? Why is this guy still alive? 

Those people were the most powerful? Sam? Maybe Robyn was with the Knights of the Vale, but I'm pretty sure the Unsullied could have took all those jokers sitting down out. Especially if the Dothraki were still around. How wasn't there a war? Where is the justice for Dany's death? SHE WAS THE QUEEN!

What's west of Westeros? There's a west? You mean there were only kings and queens of the east? So no one was really king or queen of westeros? Were the people of the west watching this show on TV like the rest of us? 

Why was Jon Snow resurrected? Who is the lord of light and what was that purpose? Jon went back to the wall/Knights watch that doesn't exist anymore or have a purpose? How was that punishment? Then, he became a wildling? How was Tryion becoming hand ""making up for his mistakes"" punishment? I can talk about a million other things, but I'll end my rant. 

Truly, I do not give a shit who lives, or dies, or becomes king or queen. I truly don't. Just give me a good show that makes sense! One thing I'm happy about is Sansa. She was done right. Well, it sucked ass the way it all happened, but I am satisfied with her story.",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I still had a showerthought about a different twist in season 8, it might have been said before though. 

We learn preferably already in season 6, but its fine only in season 8, that The Night King has really powerful warging abilities, just like Bran. They could have some warging battles maybe somewhere (I dont exaclty know how that would work though). 

Than in the long night episode, everything is the same as it is now (maybe with some updated battle tactics) but when The night king reaches Bran, he touches him and wargs into Bran. Arya than kills the body of the night king, everyone is happy and Bran still looks like normal, he doesnt show much emotion anyway. 

Sometimes we would see Bran struggling in his mind to get him out, but the night king has full control over his body. Now the night king would use being inside Bran to a whole lot evil. In the end Bran wins his body back, but is already sentenced to death/rotting away in his cell for the actions the night king has done. Tragic but truthful.

Then second round Arya and Rob each get movies while the series covers the second book while Sequels are made for the other main characters.  
Maybe far down the line Jaqen Hghar gets a movie showing the back story to whatever sneaky shit hes up to in the books.  They could fix the Dornish and High Garden plots and portray the battle of slavers bay accurately. 

LOTR series has been adapted many of times into cartoons, movies and video games so could ASOIAF.  Also it would probably make a boat load of cash.

I followed GOT until Stannis burned his daughter at the stake. I was pregnant and I swore the show off. It literally almost made me physically ill. 

However, after all this time I heard a bit about the end of the show and revisited it. Watching from the start (Binge style) and just fast forwarding through those few instances that really bothered me. 

So I just got to the part where Cersei tells everyone she will send her army with no assurances and no faith of being treated kindly for it.

I know it isn't *actually* selfless at all. Don't get me wrong but it's about the closest thing I think he character is capable of. 

I've no idea really why but for some reason it was very emotional for me. I actually teared up at this hard cold, wounded woman doing the right thing.... Regardless of her reasons.

Everyone knows how poorly it was handled, but part of me wonders if somewhere in this mess of a character arc there's a seed of something GRRM intended for her from the start that D&amp;D botched. It's recently come out that King Bran was an idea GRRM gave to D&amp;D ahead of time, along with ""Hodor = Hold the door"". If this is the case for Bran, could Dany's fall from grace be something else GRRM prompted for D&amp;D?

First of all we have to look at who Dany is. My knowledge of her right now is based only on what I've seen in the show and what I've read in the first book, so there may be some things I'm missing. But my impression is that Daenerys Targaryen is a girl who, after enduring prolonged abuse and objectification in unfamiliar countries amidst hostile people, developed a strong sense of justice for the innocent and a refusal to negotiate with those who subjugate and oppress the less fortunate.

No matter how you cut it, justice for the innocent isn't an ideology that allows for the massacre of one million people after an unconditional surrender. However, I think it's an ideology that may still allow for a fall from grace. In S5, we see how Dany's justice isn't quite as effective once she starts to experience the gray morals of a world she'd seen as black and white. 

Without getting too political, I think it can be said that those who have genuinely good intentions can still do harm to others. A black and white view of the world leads to generalizations, which in turn lead to misunderstandings and divisions, which in turn creates conflicts that could be avoided through a less binary view of morality and the world. With Danaerys set up to inherit a great amount of power and influence, this ideology could over time lead to tyranny despite her good intentions.

In the end, I think that Dany's fall from grace won't come from unchecked slaughter, but from her refusal to bend her view of justice in the face of a world more ambiguous than she believed it to be. I think in *The Winds of Winter* and *A Dream of Spring*, the story of Daenerys Targaryen will end as a cautionary tale of the good that justice can do in a cruel world while also warning against letting justice create tyrants.",95,10,False,spoiler,,,,,

figures are From [https://www.goldderby.com/odds/combined-odds/emmy-awards-nominations-2019/](https://www.goldderby.com/odds/combined-odds/emmy-awards-nominations-2019/)

Some points: 

Best Drama - Still odds on favourite to win, largely as a lot of shows have sat out this year. Trailed by Killing Eve, Better Call Saul, This is Us, Ozark, Succession, Homecoming, Pose, Bodyguard, and The Good Fight.

Best Actor Drama - Only Kit Harington (Jon) nominated. Odds are 10/1. Bob Odenkirk (Better Call Saul), Jason Bateman (Ozark) and our former King of The North Robb Stark aka Richard Madden (Bodyguard) are at the top of the pool

Best Actress - Only Emilia Clarke (Dany) nominated. Sandra Oh from Killing Eve is odds on favourite to win however she does have Jodie Comer from the same show in this category which may not help. 

Best Supporting Actor - Peter Dinklage (Tyrion) is a huge odds on favourite to win - almost all pundits expect that he is going to win this award. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jaime) is third favourite, expected to get nominated. He was nominated for season 7 but lost to Dinklage. Alfie Allen (Theon) was a previously unknown nomination so odds may increase but is still at more than 100/1, as is Pilou Asbaek (Euron) and Richard Dormer (Beric) (also both newly advised nominations in the last week or so)

Best Supporting Actress - Massively tight category not considered to have substantial competition outside of GoT. We are expected to have multiple nominations, up to four of six. Lena Headey (Cersei) and Maisie Williams (Arya) are tied with Julia Garner (Ozark) for best odds. Sophie Turner (Sansa) is also in the top 10 as is Gwendoline Christie (Brienne) who is a late nomination whose odds are going up. This is a category that does not favour young actresses historically which will hinder Maisie and Sophie as will as Garner from Ozark. Maisie has been nominated previously however Sophie has not been nominated in eight seasons. Lena has been nominated multiple times but has never won. I believe this is the first time Gwendoline has been put on the ballot/been in the race.

And I gotta say the beginning was basically identically to the series (to its credit) so I was a bit unmotivated to keep going for the first book as I expected it to be the exact same as the show.
I just finished Bran's chapter that starts at page 237, in which Tyrion and the Nights Watch arrive at Winterfell.

The chapter doesnt really divert much as the show except for the ending, when Robb carries Bran to his bed and they share a moment in the darkness, exchaning few words but establishing them as real people. Real children, scared children. But even though they're both scared they have each other to rely on.

And this scene alone made me feel way more for Robb and Bran than I ever did during the entire show. I already dread the Red Wedding again. But now I wanna read more, be more invested and feel with these characters.",4,30,False,spoiler,,,,,

I was super motivated, especially because I know that after Season 7 or something, the Series diverged from the Books, and since there are two new ones on the horizon, I would get tons of new content.

The issue is that, I started Book 1 a few days back and I can't keep my head off the TV Show. Let's be honest, it's kinda annoying reading about the presentation of  a character and already knowing much of their main plot.

Of course this is not avoidable right, I can't just forget the plot, but I would like at least to picture the characters in my own head, as I do with other books that I read, but I just picture the actors who played that role!!

If there's anyone that went through the same situation as me, can I do anything to make my experience more pleasant? I've thought about doodling myself or finding some software that builds a character based on description to have those images on my head instead of the TV Show ones...

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance for any replies!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I'm reading the Books after the TV Show and trying to find a solution to ""forget"" the show's plot and the actors who played the characters so I can picture them on my own head.",31,3,False,self,,,,,

Battle Royale. Air out all of your grievances once and for all and let your allegiances be known. If you think everything was perfect, that's fine. If you think that Dany should have fucked Drogon and the resulting half-human half-dragon abomination should have sat on the Iron Throne, that's great! Let's just get it all out of the way so we can go back to our lives or, god forbid, back to enjoying the book series and universe that was originally the focus of this show. I'll start.  


On Dany's arc: It was fine  


On Jon Snow: why the fuck in any of the infinite parallel universes would Jon and Grey Worm not fucking fight??? Grey Worm was literally executing innocent Lannister soldiers not 30 minutes earlier and he's just going to arrest Jon and let him chill while everyone else decides what to do next? So unbelievably stupid and it robbed us of an epic fight scene just so that Grey Worm can sail to Naath and die of butterfly swine flu, fucking tragic. Also why does Naath have two A's in it? Seems pretty greedy.  


On Euron ""Bob Lee Swagger"" Greyjoy: I mean what is there to say about that man other than he could really shoot a scorpion bolt 3 times and no more than 3 times. Also why they adapted him including the tongueless crew and didn't at all get into his mystical torture-magic fuckery and horn that controls dragons, I don't know, but yay we got to see the bastardized version of him die to the man who cuckolded him incestually   


On King Bran: did he warg into that horse to bring to Arya? What was he doing during the entire battle for Winterfell? Is he even Bran at all or is he just an amalgamation of the dead children of the forest manifested into an omnipotent weirwood crow shakra king? I personally like the uncertainty and especially enjoy how much it pissed people off.

  
On Tyrion: let's just all agree that the plan to go north and capture a wight was fucking stupid   


On Cersei: Instead of just executing Missandei, she should have put a dozen scorpion bolts in Drogon right then and there and bing bang boom, war is over  


On the Night King: Should have walked faster  


On Young Griff: guess he forgot to exist  


So that's it, I don't want to fight about any of this anymore. But in order for their to be peace in this realm, first there must be great conflict. Tell me I'm wrong; tell me you thought Euron was the best character on television since Rust Cohle. Tell me you think that the writers were blackout on Xanax and Malibu spiced rum, but most of all let's just get this all out on the table once and for all so we can stop the snide back and forth bullshit where we all act like we could have written a blockbuster series better ourselves when I know that I, personally, am barely capable of writing my name on the bottom of my bar tab.",3,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

The Nightking had a few White walker with him. A few of the major character fight against them. Briene, Barric, Jamie, Sandor etc. Aryas fight is very detailed.
We see how the white walkers get defeated and how the whites fall before they can kill characters of. All of the White Walkers are gone and the Nightking approaches Bran alone. The dragon shoots fire on Jon, the stone melts in a few seconds. Jon then is revelaed to be imune to fire like Dany. Jon decapitates the dragon because of his very thin skin (he is a still a zombie). Jon then aproaches the Nightking. The fight starts during a snowstorm and Jons sword ignite in flames. The Nightking is a strong fighter but Jon can keep up with him. Jon and the Nightking stab each other into their hearts. The Nightking would burn and then fall apart into pieces. Jon would freeze to death. A song of ice and fire.",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

4827,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2019-6-21,2019,6,21,7,c32a01,self.gameofthrones,[SPOILERS] How GoT should have ended,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/c32a01/spoilers_how_got_should_have_ended/,fan9275,1561068108," *Sharing an alternate ending I wrote for GoT. Note that some of these ideas are my own and some I heard from friends, who may have found them online. I don't claim to take original credit for any of the ideas here, please feel free to give credit where credit is due!*

**How Game of Thrones should have ended**

*This storyline commences at the beginning of Season 7 Episode 5*.

Jon Snow, at Dragonstone, begs Daenerys to pause her war against the Lannisters to help the north fight the White Walkers. No one proposes capturing a wight and bringing it back as proof, an obvious suicide mission. Instead, Jon asks Daenerys to fly north with her dragons to the Wall, to see the threat for herself. If Jon is lying, she can return her focus to King's Landing with only a few days lost. If he is right, she will get the opportunity to measure the threat with her own eyes. Daeneryss advisors argue over whether this is a good idea.

As they consider this option, Daenerys repositions her troops from Dragonstone to strengthen their position against Cersei. While sailing in transit, her navy is again caught off-guard in a devastating ambush. Euron Greyjoy kills Viserion with a scorpion, destroys dozens of ships, and captures Missandei. Yara Greyjoy barely escapes and flees back to the Iron Islands. Daenerys retreats with the rest of her forces.

Enraged, Daenerys shuts down any talk of traveling north and turns her full focus to Kings Landing. She issues Cersei an ultimatum: release Missandei and relinquish the throne or see the Red Keep burn to the ground. Tyrion pleads with her to reconsider, and Daenerys threatens to depose him as Hand of the Queen if he does not get on board. Varys, concerned, quietly helps Jon Snow flee back to the north while Daenerys is distracted. Daenerys has decided she cannot help the northerners until Cersei is gone, and Varys fears Daenerys will keep Jon Snow captive until Jon bends the knee, preventing him from leading the fight against the dead. ""Gather what troops you can, find your strongest defensive position, and guard the north,"" Varys advises Jon. ""Every house in Westeros depends on you now, though none of them will help you.""

Jon flees north. Daenerys, furious to find that Jon has left without her knowledge, begins mistrusting Varys, although he and Tyrion manage to convince her to allow the continued mining and shipment of dragonglass northward. In the meantime, Daenerys meets Cersei at the walls of King's Landing. As in season 8, Cersei executes Missandei in front of Daenerys. Daenerys's makes up her mind: it is time for war.

The night before the attack on King's Landing, Tyrion manages to contact Jaime, who is in Kings Landing with Cersei. Tyrion begs him to convince Cersei to surrender and ring the bells of King's Landing as soon as they see the fight is lost. The attack on King's Landing proceeds similar to the events of Season 8 Episode 5, with a few differences. First, Daenerys manages to protect her two surviving dragons from the scorpions (which she now knows to be a threat) through a tactical maneuver. She realizes the Lannisters expect an attack from outside the walls of the city and have aimed the scorpions outward. To surprise them, she flies over the scorpions above the clouds, safely out of view, and descends from the sky at the *center* of the city. Sending one dragon to the walls and another to the bay, she attacks the scorpions from behind, destroying them before they can be turned around.

As in Season 8, she burns a hole clear through King's Landing's walls, allowing the Dothraki and Unsullied to charge in. After pitched street battles, the bells are rung. Daenerys, still enraged, chooses to fly straight to the Red Keep and burns it down, crushing and burning the hundreds of human shields hiding there along with Jaime and Cersei. Along the way, Daenerys also torches hundreds of surrendered, unarmed Lannister soldiers on the streets. She doesn't attack civilians indiscriminately as in Season 8, but the devastation is terrible nonetheless.

Once in charge of King's Landing, Daenerys begins to purge the city of Lannister loyalists, executing dozens who served Cersei whose pledges of surrender and allegiance she does not trust.

In the meantime, the dead have reached the Wall. Jon leads a defense of Castle Black, where northern troops have assembled hundreds of barrels of hot oil to stop the dead. The Night King sends tens of thousands of dead to climb up the wall, rows and rows of them, one after another. They overwhelm the living, tossing live soldiers off the top of the wall, forcing Jon and the northerners to retreat. Once the dead reach the top, they pause in a moment of unnerving stillness. Slowly, silently, they lean over the top of the wall and fall downwards, landing in Castle Black by the hundreds with sickening crunches. The falling corpses crescendo into a thunder and then suddenly stop, followed by another moment of perfect silence. The Night King lifts his hands and the dead rise again within Castle Black. They methodically open the gate of the Wall from the inside. A hundred thousand wights march through the gate and head southward towards Winterfell.

Jon knows that King's Landing is at war and is uncertain what has happened there. He concludes the northerners cannot hope to save the north nor Winterfell, and so leads a full retreat of the living to the Twins, abandoning his home. The Riverlands, he decides, represents their best hope to stop the Night King. It offers a natural fortress, a moat, and a chokepoint through which the dead can hopefully be stalled until help arrives. He sends urgent ravens to King's Landing and Dragonstone pleading for help.

At the Twins, the living prepare for their battle with the dead. Jon destroys the bridge, which will force the dead to cross through water. Bran and Sam tell Jon he is Aegon Targaryen, and word of this revelation begins to spread. As Jon grapples with this news and thinks through his battle preparations, he asks Bran for guidance, hoping to get wisdom from the Three Eyed Raven.

In response, Bran tells him the story of how the Night King was born. ""The Children of the Forest faced an existential threat,"" Bran explains. ""And they defended themselves with an apocalyptic weapon. Soon, we, too, will face the same question. What are we prepared to sacrifice to win this war?"" Jon begs for clearer guidance, but Bran responds cryptically: ""I must go now. The Night King will come for me. Protect me, at all costs, until the very end.""

The dead arrive, and an epic battle ensues similar to Season 8 Episode 3. The northerners, the Knights of the Vale, and the freefolk valiantly hold the dead off with flaming trenches (courtesy of Melisandre of course), dragonglass arrows, and heavy ballista. But the dead pile on top of one another to cross the moats of water and fire and soon overwhelm the living. Brienne of Tarth, leading the vanguard, is buried under a wave of undead within moments and torn apart. Tormund and Gendry are also killed in the fighting. Beric Dondarrion and the Hound give their lives to save Arya. Arya, in turn, saves Jon, so that he can find Bran and lead the retreat. Arya chases after them, but the earth beneath her feet crumbles under the weight of the dead, sending her falling into the river. The dead being to enclose on the fleeing survivors when at the last moment jets of flame from Daenerys's dragons streak overhead, cleaving a safe path for those still alive to retreat. Arya and many others are left for dead.

The northerners flee to King's Landing as the dragons slow the advance of the army of the dead. Unsullied and Dothraki dig a series of flaming trenches along the route to Kings Landing to give the living time to prepare new defenses.

In King's Landing, Daenerys locks up Jon, Sansa, and the northern lords, demanding that they bend the knee to her. She has learned who Jon is and decides she must force them to bow now, before the dead arrive, while there still exists an existential threat to unify all of Westeros behind her banner.

Sansa begs Jon not to give in, reasoning that Daenerys will need the northerners to defeat the dead and will eventually relent. Jon agonizes over whether to bend the knee as Varys begins scheming to overthrow Daenerys in favor of Jon. Daenerys discovers this and burns Varys alive. Tyrion, disillusioned, throws away his Hand of the Queen medallion. Daenerys, with anger and sadness, considers whether to execute Tyrion as well. Fearing further loss of life and time as the dead march southward, Jon thinks back to Bran's words and decides to bend the knee on the condition that Daenerys spare Tyrion and cease her executions of Lannisters who have surrendered. She agrees, and the northerners bitterly follow Jon's lead.

While this is happening, we intersperse with shots of Bran wharging back in time. We see how King Aerys Targaryen first took the throne as a strong, wise king. These shots are interspersed with flashbacks of Daeneryss journey to the iron throne, setting up a parallel between the rise  and, perhaps, fall  of both rulers, father and daughter.

Finally, the dead close in on King's Landing. The city is greatly weakened from Daenerys's attack, with no Red Keep and a gaping hole burned in its outer walls. Neither are there any ships left, as all have been burned by dragonfire. There will be no retreat.

A final epic battle with the dead ensues. The Dothraki are sent outside the city to flank the lines of the dead on horseback and whittle away at their numbers via dragonglass arrows. They are accompanied by a portion of the Unsullied forces who take up positions outside of the city to funnel the dead to strategic chokepoints. Jon and Daenerys plan to buy enough time for them to assassinate the Night King, who has adopted a defensive position behind his army, with the surviving two dragons. They scorch their way through the undead and reach the Night King, and for a moment it appears they are poised to kill him with dragonfire. But suddenly, one after the other, Drogon and Rhaegal are hit by ice spears flung by White Walkers. Jon and Daenerys fall with the dragons to their deaths.

The dead cleave their way through to King's Landing. They pour through the hole in the outer wall and make their way through the city towards the ashes of the Red Keep, slaughtering soldiers and civilians along the way. Grey Worm and the remaining survivors make their last stand at city center, when the Night King arrives. Raising his hands, he brings the recently slaughtered residents of Kings Landing back to life. They begin their inexorable march towards the last of the survivors.

Cut to shots of Tyrion, Sansa, Grey Worm, Jorah, Bronn, and other main characters' faces as they realize: this is the end.

We cut to Bran who is sitting in one of the few remaining rooms of the Red Keep, his eyes closed. The *Light of the Seven*musical theme, from season 6 episode 10, begins playing in the background. We cut back and forth between Brans visions of King Aerys and the frenzied last stand the living are now taking against the dead. In current day King's Landing, soldiers frantically shout ""Burn them! Burn them all!"" as they shoot flaming arrows and toss torches at buildings in a desperate attempt to stop the dead. Hodor-style, these shots merge with Bran's visions of King Aerys, who begins shuddering. Shouts of ""Burn them! Burn them all!"" ring in the background as we see Brans meddling transform a once stoic Aerys into the mad king. We montage through his crazed reign, watching him torch Ned Stark's father and brother alive, watching him laugh as his enemies writhe in wildfire, watching him command his pyromancer to burn down Kings Landing.

Cut to Tyrion, who is watching from behind the fighting as the dead push into the final lines of Unsullied. His face darkens with a new resolve and he begins running.

Cut back and forth between the Mad King yelling ""Burn them all!"" and Tyrion running into the dungeons and sewers beneath King's landing. Suddenly, a moment of clarity and stillness appears in Brans visions. A single moment snaps to life: the Mad King commanding his pyromancers to fill every corner of King's Landings sewers with jars of wildfire. ""Stock it under Flea Bottom, under the Sept of Baelor, under the streets, under the walls, under the Red Keep,"" he commands wildly. We see the pyromancers carefully placing endless jars of wildfire throughout the underground. Cut back to the dead, present-day, who are nearly atop Grey Worm's last line of soldiers. Sansa and the last line of unarmed survivors behind the Unsullied tremble in fear and close their eyes, preparing to die.

Final cut to Tyrion, who is now holding a torch underground. He has spilled out jars and jars of wildfire before him. Closing his eyes, he drops the torch.

We see a stunning, birds-eye shot of King's Landing filled with undead in concentric circles around a final circle of Unsullied defending the last of the living at city center. After a moment of silence, we see green fire explode through the streets of the city, tearing the entire capital apart in a roaring blaze of light. Everyone within the city walls is killed, including the Night King. The tens of thousands of dead still outside the city collapse as the Night King's magic dissipates.

As the dust settles and the wildfire slowly dies down, survivors eventually make their way to the ashes of Kings Landing. The Iron Throne is no more. Virtually all the great houses are gone. But survivors across Westeros who escaped the Night King's path trickle in to see what is left of their kingdom. Lords, soldiers, and other survivors from Dorne, the Vale, the Iron Islands, Highgarden, and elsewhere arrive. The surviving Dothraki and Unsullied who fought outside the city return as well. Daario Naharis arrives from Meereen with the Second Sons, having heard that Daeneryss forces were under siege. He is devastated to learn of her death. An emissary from the Iron Bank, with the Golden Company in tow, arrives, planning to place the surviving lords of Westeros under Braavos's vassalage to force them to repay Cersei's debt. All parties begin to argue over who should rule Westeros. New battle lines are drawn.

As tensions reach a boiling point, a figure suddenly emerges from the falling ash in the distance. The lords look up and find, to their shock, a bloody but determined Daenerys marching towards them. Daario Naharis, the Dothraki, the Unsullied, and Yara Greyjoy immediately unite behind her command and present a unified front against the other lords. With steel in her voice, Daenerys commands them to bend the knee, and one after another they obey. She turns to the outnumbered emissary from the Iron Bank and tells him he will forgive all debts and cease to finance the wars of other nations forevermore, or she will flatten Braavos. Terrified, he agrees and flees with the Golden Company.

The survivors slowly begin to rebuild as a fierce Daenerys consolidates her power. Finally, she calls a council of the surviving lords and ladies of Westeros.

""When I came to Westeros, I swore that I would break the wheel in which powerful families crush those beneath them in their constant struggle for power,"" she says. ""I intend to keep that promise. You have all pledged to follow me as your queen. But who will you follow when I am gone? Who will your children follow? My descendants will not be bound to rule with my sense of justice, just as I am not bound by my father's madness. Together, are we not simply recreating the insanity of the wheel?""

""In all of my travels,"" she continues, ""I have come across only one city that has progressed beyond the savagery of the wheel, where the many are not preyed upon by the few. It is a city that has flourished, that has accumulated vast riches, without relying on slavery or serfdom for its keep. Its name is Qarth. The merchant council that ruled Qarth showed me only cruelty and deceit. But their job was not to show mercy to foreigners. Their duty was to serve the residents of their city. And they did so well.""

""As long as one house rules the Seven Kingdoms, the wheel persists,"" she says. ""And so, from today onwards, I abdicate and abolish the throne. There will be no more Kings or Queens in Westeros. Instead, the lords and ladies here today will rule together as a council. Each year a different lord will serve as lead council member and steward of the Seven Kingdoms. Daario, you will lead the council in its first year, and your task will be to establish by consensus a set of rules through which the council will govern itself.""

""The Unsullied,"" she continues, turning to their commander, ""will remain the protectors of the realm. They will hold loyalty not to any lord or house, but to the rules governing this council. They will ensure no house takes control over the others, and that the council never abrogates its duty to rule on behalf of all the people of Westeros. As free men, any of the Unsullied may choose to leave and pursue their own lives across Westeros. But you will also allow young men and women across the kingdom to join your forces if they prove strong of mind, body, and character.""

The lords and ladies sit in stunned silence. Finally Daario says, ""My queen, what of you? Will you not lead the council?""

Daenerys smiles. ""I have done my part here. I will leave this place and find another people, in another corner of the world, in need of liberation."" She leaves the chamber as the assembled nobles grapple with the news.

Daario chases after her to her chambers. ""My queen!"" He says. ""I don't understand. You have spent your entire life fighting for the iron throne. This kingdom needs you. How can you leave now?""

She shakes her head. ""I'm not the same woman I once was,"" she tells him. ""Give up, Daario. Enough. Stay here and bring a new dream to life.""

Daario shakes his head. ""What happened to you since Meereen?"" He asks. ""Who have you become?""

With a glimmer in her eye, turning back one last time as she opens the backdoor out of her chambers onto the ramparts outside, she responds: ""No one.""

The *Many Faced God* musical theme comes on as Daenerys closes the door behind her and leaves a stunned Daario behind. Smiling, she lifts a hand under her chin and pulls back her face to reveal: Arya Stark.

We see Arya walk to the docks of King's Landing and embark on a ship for a new adventure.

So I started thinking of how I would've made Season 8 and thought I would see what other people thought. Again, I know this won't change anything about Season 8 and I'm not one of the people who are hating on D&amp;D and want to ""remake season 8"" but I just wanted to share what I thought was a good way to end one of my favorite TV shows of all time, so here we go:

&amp;#x200B;

Episodes 801 and 802 stay the same. I really liked these episodes and thought they did a good job of re-orienting the audience with the world after almost 2 years and they did a great job setting up the Battle of Winterfell. I just wouldn't have Jon ride on a dragon in the first episode.

803 and The Battle of Winterfell are where I think everyone started to have problems. I for one actually liked the action I would have just made it more clear that the Dothraki and Unsullied weren't completely decimated to make the sheer numbers of them in the final episode less jarring. I would also have Jon on the battlefield with his men instead of just riding around on a dragon that can burn the Army of the Dead on its own. All the deaths would stay, especially Jorah and Theon's, but Jaime (in Brienne's arms), Greyworm, Sam, and Varys would die as well. That would have tied up some storylines and given the battle some more weight and consequence. I would also have Bran warg into Rhaegal to save Jon when he is overrun by Wights and then Jon rides Rhaegal to save Bran. Arya is also on her way to help Bran so Jon and Arya fight the Night King together. I wouldn't mind if Arya got the final blow as long as Jon helped in some way because his story has been all about the White Walkers.

&amp;#x200B;

I would make sure that the beginning of 804 clearly shows that Dany is starting to slip. She is jealous of Jon's popularity and knows he is the true heir to the throne and has lost everyone but Missandei and Tyrion. Everyone was suspicious after Jon rode the dragon, but Jon tells Arya and Sansa the truth about his Targaryen heritage and Sansa tells Tyrion, just like in the real episode. Arya also reveals she has taken Jaime's face. Bronn shows up and agrees to help fight Cersei in exchange for the Twins because the Freys are gone. Everyone marches South and there is a standoff with the Golden Company and Euron with the Iron Fleet equipped with the Scorpions.

&amp;#x200B;

805 starts with the battle outside of King's Landing. Drogon and Rhaegal are taking out the Scorpions and the Iron Fleet with ease, but the weakened army is at a stalemate with the Golden Company and can't get to Cersei because of the civilians, so Arya sneaks in with the Hound. She uses Jaime's face to get close to Cersei and kill her. The Mountain tries to kill Arya but the Hound steps in to save her and fight his brother while Arya goes to ring the bell to single the defeat of Cersei. But before she can make it, Euron lands a 1 in 100 Scorpion shot on Rhaegal, killing him. Dany kills Euron and the rest of the Iron Fleet and the remaining Golden Company and Lannister soldiers surrender. But it's too late and Daenerys has snapped and burns King's Landing down. The Hound kills the Mountain by plunging them both into the fire and Arya, content with having completed her list, accepts her fate and dies when the Red Keep collapses.

&amp;#x200B;

806 plays out the same at the beginning with Dany promising to take over the world and Tyrion throwing his Hand of the Queen pin away, landing him imprisoned. Tyrion convinces Jon to kill Dany and the scene between Jon and Dany plays out the same way as well. Jon stabs the woman he loves through the heart (and has more reason to because of Arya) completing the Azor Ahai prophecy by saving the world, not from the White Walkers, but from Dany.  Drogon finds Dany dead and does indeed try to burn Jon, but because he is a Targaryen he is unhurt by the flames, though Longclaw is lit on fire, like in the prophecy, but melts. Seeing that Jon is unharmed, Drogon takes Dany's body and flies East like in the episode. The scene with the Lords of Westeros plays out the same, but without Greyworm there, Tyrion states that Jon should be king because he is the true heir to the throne and has proven himself a worthy king. The council agrees and they name Jon king, but that is the last thing he wants... so he abdicates the throne to Sansa Stark. Sansa names Tyrion, Bran, and Brienne to her small council appointing them to Hand of the Queen, Master of Whispers, and Commander of the Queen's Guard respectively. Jon goes North of the wall and lives with Ghost, Tormund, and the wildlings in a self-imposed exile in the place that is truly his home.

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, if you read this all I thank you and ask you to leave any feedback or thoughts you have. I want to stress again that I know I'm no professional screenwriter, I know that this won't change anything, and I don't hate D&amp;D and want to ""remake season 8"" but I just wanted to put my ideas out there and see what people thought. Thanks again.",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Name of the ancestral sword ""Ice"" probably refers to actual Ice sword of Others.

Explains why Stark family has affinity to magic and resistance to being ""wighted"" (like Benjen Stark).

Explains why Starks referred as ice-blooded.

I know that there is loud dissatisfaction. I disliked the direction they were taking things in seasons 6 and 7, as I began to sense Hollywood Values seeping into the storytelling and character designs. My questions (please no spoilers):

\-is the outcry a result of an ambiguous ending?

\-does season 8 re-contextualize any of the characters in a deleterious way?

\-does season 8 continue channeling the 201X American political ideology that crept into 6 and 7?

\-does it turn into a postmodern deconstruction of the franchise?

\-did they fail to elegantly wrap up all of the storylines in the final few episodes?

Reason for question:

I do not want my positive feelings for the franchise damaged and I would be satisfied with head canon branching from season 7, thus I'm willing to steer clear of season 8. 6 and 7 damaged characters I enjoyed in the books and took things in what I felt were silly and clumsy directions. Because it is difficult, bordering on impossible, to separate show from book I'd choose to avoid it if the outcry is in part due to certain factors.

Arya's fate / role with the Faceless Men,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/c3cpkj/theory_brainstorming_aryas_fate_role_with_the/,cheekyleaf,1561134111,"I'm genuinely interested on any thoughts you guys have on this theory I've been wrestling with latelyregarding Arya's fate intertwined with the whole faceless men storyline.   
   The show left so many crucial plot points unresolved or open-ended... ~~one of the~~ **~~countless~~** ~~issues with season 8~~... So I've been racking my brain &amp; diving into countless fan theories in an attempt to create the pieces needed to fill these huge gaps in the grand puzzle that is the plot of Game of Thrones.  
**Soooooo without further ado, for the sake of creative debate, here's the theory:**   
Let's say that Arya was relentlessly recruited by the faceless men because they knew with their collective hive-minds that she'd be the one to eventually kill the Night King and end the long night. 

They went to great lengths to manipulate her slowly, first through Syrio Forel, then obviously through Jaqen H'gharwho in this case *is* Syrio Forel, who escaped Meryn Trant off-screen, and then changed faces to escape the Red Keep and eventually work his way back to crossing paths with Arya again on the way to Harrenhal.  
(Obviously keeping to the show's storyline with Jaqen H'ghar, not the like in the books where he's known as the Alchemist &amp; all that.) 

So... Okay. Right. This ALMOST makes sense, because it explains why they just allowed her to leave the house of Black &amp; White without sending more assassins after her and all that jazz.  
HOWEVER, thatcollective hive-mind thing all the true faceless men have is supposedly subservient to the Many Faced God/God of Death. They gave up their dreams, desires, identities, &amp; ultimately their *souls* to become no one... only an instrument for their God.  
That being said, isnt the Night King &amp; his army supposed to be the EMBODIMENT of death? So therefore wouldnt the faceless men see the Night King almost as a Jesus Christ-like figure???? Why would they be on a mission to manipulate a girl since childhood into killing the most powerfulliving manifestation of their God?*There is only one god, and his name is Death.*   
Also Jaqen made a point to instill in Arya how important it is to *""not steal from the Many Faced God""* or else *""a debt would have to be paid""*.  So wouldn't destroying the Night King &amp; the army of the dead be like the ultimate form of stealing from the God of Death? Or did she need to do this so Dany could then take on the ""role"" or ""mission"" of the Night King and become the  one who ""repays"" the God of Death by taking the lives of the hundreds of thousands in King's Landing???  


As you can see I'm ending up with more questions than answers, but I must admit it's fun to ponder and try to connect the dots from the show's perspective, in order to try and scratch that psychological itch I have to answer the questions D&amp;D never bothered to touch base on.   
Pleaseeee feel free to offer any thoughts/insights/critiques you may have on this topic! I'm genuinely excited to continue brainstorming on this. :D",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Ive made a few comments recently pointing out many of the mistakes the show runners made during the series including the Kingslayer flashback from Brans vision in which several things appear to be wrong. Them being that...

- Jaimie has his short hair like he does during the present instead of long hair

- Jaimie stabs the Mad King from the front instead of the back like he says he did

- *Jaimie is wearing golden Kingsguard armor instead of the silver Targaryen Kingsguard armor we see that the KG wore at the time during the Tower of Joy flashbacks*

I want to focus on the last of these because after just reading the second Jaimie chapter in ASOS it appears that this might have actually been an intentional decision to (kind of) reference the books. In the books the Kingsguard during both Aerys, Robert and Jorfferys reign wear white armor and when Jaimie reflects about when he kills the mad king he notes that he was not wearing his Kingsguard armor when he entered the throne room, but instead his golden armor, and is annoyed that no one ever points that out, however he was still wearing his KG cloak and reflects that he should have taken it off.

It doesnt quite translate to the show however because instead of the golden armor being a personal armor of Jaimie it is instead the same armor that becomes the standard for all of the KG during Roberts reign so instead of looking like an intentional choice in the show it just looks like they put him in a uniform that didnt exist yet. Its still kind of soppy, but not quite as sloppy as I originally thought. I get what they might have been going for (if they were in fact actually trying to reference this part of the books and it wasnt a full-on continuity mistake) but without context or the same armor uniforms from book to show, it still ends up making little sense and a non-reader who picked up on this would have every reason to believe it made zero sense.

Maybe Jaimies personal armor became the new standard for everyone during Roberts reign? A way to symbolize the alliance of Lannister and Baratheon? But Jaimie wasnt even Lord Commander then and he was being pardoned...I feel like you dont make your protectors dress like a guy you just had to pardon. Maybe Robert just preferred the way it looked to the less flashy armor of Areyss reign. We know Robert liked to spend cash on frivolous stuff like that.",13,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

I agree with everyone that the writing was rushed and that they just coped out at the very end. However what pissed me off the most was how after they killed Daenerys that was just it. The whole show they talked about how her and Khal Drogo were going to meet in death. Even when she went to that house in the beginning (I cant remember the name) and she saw him and the baby in the tent he said that he wasnt going to go forward without her. 

Had they done a five minute fucking scene of her finding him in death with her baby in the tent before they went on I would have felt better about her ultimate demise. They alluded so much to this and the fact that her great ending was being killed and the dragon mourning her and carrying her off killed me. The great Mother of Dragons died...and that was it. Like really?!? Thats all youre going to show?? I dont feel like they properly ended her. They could have brought the thing full circle with her and him at the end. Out of all the things that disappointed me at the terrible ending of this great show this is what got me the most. 

They just dropped that part of the story why the hell did they talk about it so much if thats all they were going to do?

I think Sansa begins to play Littlefingers game when Dany mentions Jon. She wants to know Danys motives so she assumes the worst (the worst being Dany is manipulating Jon and that is why Sansa says men do stupid things for women) and it works. 

Dany responds with My whole life I have known one goal: the iron throne(which I think that statement in and of itself is a red flag to Sansa because she has known other people with the same motivations). Dany says her sole purpose was the iron throne and that her sole reason for being there was her love for Jon, trying to manipulate Sansa to think shes being honest. Sansa sees through Dany, that Dany is trying to manipulate her which confirms Sansas suspicions. Dany is speaking some truth that she does love Jon and that is part of the reason why shes there but it is not the sole reason but Dany is acting like it is to trick Sansa. That yes Dany is there because she loves Jon but shes there to gain the North on her side by bending the North to her will, either by manipulation or by force. Its why shes trying to manipulate Sansa, to get Sansa to bend to her will but Sansa doesnt fall for it. Dany shows to Sansa that she isnt there to ally with the North, shes there to control it. This is when Sansa sees Danys motives. Sansa realizes that Dany isnt actually there to improve their relationship or make real allies with the North, shes there to manipulate Sansa and get the North under her wing. Dany isnt there to make peace with Sansa, shes there to control Sansa, to control the North. 

Sansa knows it and after she learns Danys true motives, she plays along with Dany.  She makes Dany think that Dany has successfully manipulated her. She does what Margaery does and chuckles and warms up to Dany by admitting a fault that she shouldve said thank you when Dany arrived to draw Dany in, and at the moment Dany thinks she has Sansa within her grasps, the moment that Dany thinks she has Sansa on her side, Sansa drops the bomb about the Norths independence like Olenna or Cersei would and Dany loses control and her true colors just bleed out as clear as day. 

When this occurs Sansa really gets Danys motivations out in the open for her to see. Dany realizes that Sansa has caught her and thats why she pulls her hand away. It effectively shows that Dany is just another tyrant who wont accept less power for peace and Dany knows that Sansa exposed her. That Dany could really care less about what the North wants and shes all about what she wants. Dany is just all about Dany. Dany is just more of the same. Her only goal is power. All Dany wants is power. That Dany is just more of the same. Such an awesome scene between two powerful characters trying to up each other in the game but unfortunately Dany doesnt have the experience like Sansa and she doesnt know how the game is played. Sansa makes Dany look like a fool. Sansa knows Dany for who she is now and Dany is only further away from where she was before.",119,13,False,spoiler,,,,,

However, I didn't know how I want to present it - writing an entire script didn't seem like something I was willing to put my energy into. Luckily, I recently watched the new video from *Patrick H. Willems* [Rewriting The Matrix Sequels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqhhy0yGAX4) and realized this is the way I'm going to do it, only in written form instead of a video. I will write small sequences that will give you general idea what the story is. You do need to have seen the season since I'm going to reference events there.

***Before I start, let's establish some rules:***

1. I'm acting as if season 7 is out and season 8 script is ready and I was brought as a consultant on said script. So, even though there are many things I'd love to change in previous seasons - I can't. My only focus is season 8.
2. I cannot change the outcome. The result should be the same as in the original script. Same characters should die. Same characters should survive. However, I'm free to play with the characters, events and lore as I please to achieve my narrative.
3. Books - I will integrate ideas from the books into the story, changing it to fit the narrative I'm going for.
4. Battles - I'm not going to dwell too deep into battle tactics. I'll just write what basic changes from the original episode are there.
5. Episodes - I'm not going to present it in an episodic structure. I will lay out the whole story for the season in several parts. It's up to you to decide how this story is divided into episodes. My version will most likely need more than 6 episodes to be told.

Ready?! OK, let's begin:

&amp;#x200B;

* Episode 1 remains the same, with a major change: Cersei does not agree for Euron to sleep with her. She commands Euron to prepare his fleet to kill the dragons, in case those survive the fight against the undead. Euron says he has other plans for the dragons: he reveals that during his time in exile he came upon an ancient manuscript talking about ancient Valyrians who were using a special horn to tame the dragons. He claims he sailed to the ruins of old Valyria and found said horn.
* Episode 2 also quite the same, with few additions: (1) Davos receives a letter telling him his wife is very sick, but he cannot go be with her. He then proceeds to lament his son, taking a relief that Mathos died before some evil could revive him as a brainless wight while he, Davos, will probaly roam the world forever as an undead.  (2) After Jaime knights Brienne - he is about to slap her with his golden arm, but then realizes it's not a good idea and slaps her with his other arm.
* When Bran is asked what the Night King wants, he reveals that the Night King did turn one woman he loved into a white walker. She became a pale beauty. And as she was powerful, so was she ruthless. She was the one who started using her powers to do unimaginable dark things, including reanimating dead bodies. Her actions caused the long winter. He never turned any other woman into a white walker. But she was taken from him. And the wall of ice was built to separate them. ""He wants his ***Queen***"" Bran says. When Sam asks where she is, Bran answers ""She is in Winterfell... beneath the crypt, protected by a powerful spell. And the Starks of Winterfell are guarding her"". ""There must always be a Stark in Winterfell"" Jon says the famous line. Bran reveals the Night King also knows her location by showing his mark and saying they're connected. Tyrion then says: ""Good. We will release her and give her to him. And there'll be no need for fighting"". Bran, however, tells him that the Night King will then come to kill him because he, Bran, is the keeper of memory and the Night King wants to wipe out all memory from the world. Theon assigns himself as Bran's defender and the decision is made to sneak Bran out of Winterfell through The Wolfswood to the sea and take him to The Iron Islands. Bran says the Night King will know, but Jon agrees with the plan, saying it's the best plan they've got.
* **The Battle of Winterfell -** Obviously, a better tactic: The Dothraki don't charge into the night, unable to see the enemy.  [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA5mJRFaI8c) shows a good tactic option that should work well with my narrative.
* Common sense: Tyrion, Sansa and others are not hiding in the crypts. Some might end up there when escaping wights, but not hiding there in the first place.
* Beric Dondarrion dosen't die during the battle. He has another purpose.
* Ghost gets injured during the battle. Nymeria comes along with the pack, circling injured Ghost and guarding him against the wights.
* The Night King realizes where Bran is and sends his generals after him.
* The white walkers cut off Theon and his men in the Wolfswood and there they make their last stand, being killed by the white walkers before The Night King even arrives there.
* Jon on Rhaegal tries to prevent the Night King from getting to Bran. The aerial battle they were having in the episode is now above the Wolfswood.
* Arya rides Nymeria into the Wolfswood.
* ***Jon fights the Night King!*** The Night King disarms Jon and pierces him with his sword. However, his sword melts when it comes in contact with Jon's blood. He then proceeds to hold Jon by the throat and turns him into a White Walker - His eyes turn blue. His hair turns white.
* Arya on top of Nymeria rides through the white walkers, killing few of them using her 2-sided dragonglass spear, then jumps upon The Night King and pierces him with the spear, but nothing happens - The Night King doesn't die. He kills Arya using her own spear. Then throws the spear into Bran, but Bran's chair is empty...
* Bran, meanwhile, wargs into Nymeria, picks his own body with Nymeria's teeth and runs away.
* Melissandre sacrifices herself to allow the ones who remain alive to retreat. Daenerys assists from the air.
* The Night King arrives at Winterfell on undead Vyserion. He goes into the crypt....

He's one fucking direwolf.

Imagine if they had hundreds of them in their ranks. Or maybe they had certain military units who were direwolf trainers who led them into battle.

It's pretty clear that direwolfs are well over intelligent enough to know who is the enemy and who is the master. 

The Starks could have easily domesticated mass amounts of direwolfs. If they did this, it would probably have similar levels of lethality to the Targaryen dragons. 

Sure, direwolfs can't burn down cities. But mass units of direwolfs could decimate enemy military ranks before the main armies even engaged.

Some people think that direwolfs are nearly extinct. While this is true south of the wall, I've learned from the wiki that they exist in great number beyond the wall. 

It would be no trouble for Northerners to venture beyond the wall and acquire direwolfs over time until they had bread generations of direwolfs obedient to the Stark men and the other lords of the North.

This would have been especially helpful to the Northerners because their kingdom has a very low population, which probably contributes to the reason why Robb Stark could only amass 20000 men.

Direwolfs would be the key to their power.  Especially since wargs come from the first men blood in the North aswell.

I don't know why this isn't a thing. It would have made the North 10000000x more cool than they already are. Their blood is just as magical as Valerian blood, their power should be coupled with their beasts.",12,10,False,spoiler,,,,,

Jon opened his eyes. 

It was morning; the cold had woken him, the cold and his dreams. He hated dreaming, his dreams were always the same. He dreamt of fire, of ash, of lost love. He felt cold even though the fire was still crackling in his chimney. As he rose slowly from the bed; he felt something moving next to his bed on the cold floor. Ghost. The snowy white giant direwolf opened one of his red eyes and closed it again as he saw Jon moving from the bed to the privy.

Its no use looking at me that way, Tormund is coming soon and ye better help me this time. We cant lose to him again said Jon.

Ever since he had been exiled back North, to the real North, Tormund and him had an annual hunting competition. The hunts champion would be whoever could catch the biggest animal and bring it back to the Free Folk for a feast. The people called it: the Hunt of the Dragonrider and the Giantsbane. Tormund had won every year since Jons exile began seven years ago. This would be the seventh. Two years ago, Jon thought he would win, when Ghost helped him catch the biggest Stag he had ever seen. Tormund caught a grey bear twelve feet tall. Jon lost.

Seven years has it been that long already? Perhaps time should be measured by events and not by years Jon thought He smiled sadly as he remembered moments gone by. He thought of his sisters Sansa and Arya. He thought of Bran, the cripple boy who became King. Mostly he thought of her, he always thought of her. Daenerys.

Jon finished relieving himself, and put on his clothes and wolf-coat. He heard a knock on the door.

That will be the Giantsbane said Jon to Ghost, as he opened the door.

The giant ginger smiled at the sight of a half awoken Jon. 

Are ye ready to lose again little Crow? said Tormund.

This is the seventh year of the hunt. Seven is a lucky number, like the gods. Mayhaps the gods will smile on me this time said Jon.

Youre in the North, the old gods rule here my little Crow. Lets get started Dragonrider, I am already hungry said Tormund smiling at his old friend.

Jon picked up his Valyrian sword, Longclaw, his bow and arrows, a leather pouch with dry meat for him and Ghost to share, and some water.  Jon waited at the door as his direwolf slowly got off the floor and came to him. Once outside Tormund smiled and wished his friend good luck.

I will see you at sunset Dragonrider said Tormund amusedly. 

Same to you Tormund of Tarth said Jon smiling back at his friend

Aaaahhhh good memories said Tormund smiling to himself as he walked away from them.

The village was deserted, everybody still asleep as the sun slowly emerged from its daily slumber. Jon and Ghost started walking west towards the nearby forest. Jon had decided to walk around the edge of the forest, on the north side, to spot any animal tracks before deciding to venture into the forest to chase whatever animal might be there. It was a beautiful day Jon thought. The sky was cloudless. Only the vanishing red light from the rising sun disturbed the blueness of the sky. If he looked south he could see the Wall in the horizon. After all these years, the sight of it still took Jons breath away. There she was: bright, crying as the first rays of dawn hit her glasslike surface in the summer sun. Eternal.

After an hour or so of walking, they reached the edge of the forest.

All right Ghost; lets see what we can find. Use that nose of yours said Jon. The giant direwolf stared at Jon with its big ruby eyes before it started trotting at a slow pace while sniffing the ground in front of him for any animal scents.

Jon was walking briskly behind his direwolf, with his bow and arrow at the ready. The forest to their left looked dark and uninviting, with no signs of animal tracks. They followed the edge of the forest, but ahead of them three hundred yards away, a massive boulder blocked the path. They would either have to go south into the forest or they would have to walk around it on the north side. As they approached the massive rock, Ghost stopped.

What is it Ghost? Did you catch a scent? Jon quietly asked his wolf.

Ghost lowered its massive body, its left ear pointing backwards, the hair on its back bristled as the wolf started walking slowly towards the rock. Jon followed, bow and arrow ready. They slowly followed the circumference of the rock as they moved northwards around it and away from the forest.  

Jon was about twenty yards away from the edge of the boulder; he would be able to peak on the other side. Ghost started snarling its teeth as Jon reached the edge of the boulder with his bow ready.

Ill shoot it and you hold it down. Then Ill come running behind you to end it with Longclaw he whispered to his direwolf.

Jon quickly moved to the other side of the boulder ready to strikeand he froze.

There in front of him, on the other side of the boulder at the edge of the forest resting on the ground was something he hadnt seen in seven years, and something he thought he would never see again in his life.

A Dragon.

The beast rested on the ground, its black scales as dark as night, massive in its length. Its long neck bent over its right wing, as if distracted by something on the other side. From where he stood Jon could only see the Dragons left profile. Its left wing was half raised, while its long tail rested on the ground by the trees.

Jon could not see the dragons face, but he knew who it was. Here at the end of the world, rested the dragon that burnt the Gold Road, the one who brought fire to the Long Night, the dragon that fought its brother in the clouds above Winterfell, the one that had rescued Jon beyond the Wall, the bane of Kings Landing, the one who melted the Iron Throne; and took its dead Mother away in the darkness across the Narrow Sea. The only living dragon left in the world.

Drogon.

Jon stood there watching the magnificent beast, as Ghost remained slightly behind him by the boulder. He lowered his bow and arrow, as he took half a step towards Drogon. His black leather boot was loud in the flat rocky path, and the dragon turned its massive neck around until he found the source of the noise. Jon. 

Drogon stared at Jon, with its mouth and nostrils slightly opened. The dragons head was no more than fifty yards away.

Jon stared back at the dragon silently, unsure of what to do. From the corner of his eye, he thought he saw something moving behind the dragons left wing. He slowly turned his gaze from the dragons eyes to its wing. There, stepping from behind the wing appeared a vision of his past, the reason his heart felt empty and his guilt never-ending. 

Daenerys Targaryen.

Jons bow and arrow made a loud noise on the rock as they fell from his hand. He stood there stony and silent, as the statues of the old Kings of Winter in the crypts of Winterfell. He thought it must be a dream, a cruel one. 

Dany? he muttered silently.

Daenerys smiled softly as she pet Drogons wing and started walking towards Jon. She looked as radiant as ever, as if time had stopped by. Her long silver blonde hair moved freely down to her waist. She had a small braid dangling from her forehead to her neck. Her indigo eyes shone as bright as the ice of the Wall in the morning sun. She wore the same white and grey sheep coat that she used to wear when visiting the North.

She stopped three steps away from Jon, as she stared at him with soft eyes and smiled sadly at him. Jon felt those three steps were a greater chasm than crossing the Narrow Sea. He felt his knees buckle under the weight of his aching heart.

Da..Danyhow? Jon asked sheepishly

The Lord of Light, she said simply. Drogon took me East. The followers of RHllor brought me back, just like you. Now we both have scars in our hearts.

DanyIm sorryI Jon said. He could not say anything else. The words escaped him as they left his mouth. Jons eyes reflected the pain and sorrow in his heart, as the tears started forming and gently streaming down his face.

Daenerys took the final steps between them and stood there looking at his old lovers eyes, as she softly touched his face and wiped the tears away. Jon saw that she was smiling at him as her own tears streamed down her fair cheeks. For the first time in seven years he felt hope, the hope that only love can bring to a mans heart. 

Jon gently grabbed her hands and stared into her eyes, terrified that this moment would disappear and he would only have a vague memory of it. Terrified it would disappear, like a dream that is forgotten when the body is suddenly awoken.

Where have you been all this time? Jon said softly.

Volantis. That is where I was given the kiss of life. I stayed there for some time, and then went back to the Great Grass Sea said Daenerys.

DanyIm sorry said Jon. He wanted to say so much more to her, but the words betrayed him.

I know you are. I had many enemies in my first life, but I did not think I would die at the hands of the noblest man I knew. The man I loved she said with some pain in her voice.

At first, I wanted to come back with Fire and Blood once again. However, having life again changed mewith time, I understood your choice she said.

I should have tried to convince you some other wayI Jon said. 

Daenerys gently squeezed his hands. You were right, and so was Varys. I lost my way on my path to the Iron Throne. I became what I always struggled to keep at bay. I became my fathers daughter Daenerys said regretfully.

Life was given back to me, and I hadother things to mindso I went back to the Dothraki Sea, away from the world she said with a smile on her face.

Even with his eyes full of tears as he stared at Daenerys, Jon caught a slight movement from the corner of his eyes. He saw as Drogons gargantuan head turned around to its right, as something appeared from behind its right wing. It was the most beautiful sight that Jon had ever seen in his life. 

A little girl.

The little girl could not have been older than six years old, Jon thought. She started walking slowly towards Daenerys and Jon. She had fair skin and her eyes were a brighter shade of indigo than Daenerys. She had two silver hair braids on each side of her face down to her neck. Targaryen hair Jon thought. 

As she approached them, he noticed that her hair in the middle was not silver, but black and wavy. His heart started racing, as if it was trying to tell him something about this most beautiful of creatures.

The little girl wore a sheep coat, half black and half red with a grey silver band across the middle. This is what Jon thought Daenerys must have looked like when she was that age, except for the patch of black hair. Jon had no doubt this girl was Daenerys Targaryens daughter. He noticed that she was holding a wooden figurine, a toy of some sort. It was a wooden dragon, painted sky blue except for its dark green tail. She stopped about five yards from them.

Daenerys let go of Jons hands and approached her daughter. She grabbed her hand and brought her closer to Jon, no more than one foot away.

This is your father my love. He was a King, and his name is Aegon Targaryen, the sixth of his name Daenerys said looking at his daughter.

Daenerys looked happily at Jon and said: this is your daughter. Her name is Lyanna Targaryen

Jons legs gave out and he fell on his knees in front of his daughter. Ghost approached Jon as it saw him falling on his knees.

Jon looked at Lyanna with all the love a man can have for his child, and with all the pain that his heart had carried for seven long years.

How?...Dany, how?... Jons words were barely audible.

Only death can pay for life. My life allowed her to live Daenerys said sweetly as a tear slowly fell down her face.

Jon hugged and kissed his daughter with tears in his eyes and joy in his heart. He held her with more love than he had ever given to anyone, more than Arya, more than Daenerys, more than Ghost. He did not know how long that moment lasted, in that instant he felt immortal. 

At last he let go of Lyanna.

Lyanna thats a beautiful name said Jon smiling at his daughter.

Mother named me after my grandmother. She said she had great beauty and was very brave the girl said with conviction.

She was just like you said Jon approvingly

Ghost got closer to the little girl, who seemed a bit scared of the giant direwolf. Ghost then smelled the patch of black hair and started licking her ear. Lyanna giggled as she started petting the wolfs only ear.

Whats his name? Lyanna asked curiously

His name is Ghost. Ive had him since he was a pup. I think he likes you Jon said. Jon gently grabbed Lyannas wooden dragon and started examining it.

I like your toy dragon, does he have a name? he asked 

He protects the smaller dragons, so I named him Jorax after Mothers bravest Knight said Lyanna as Daenerys smiled at her daughter and Jon.

A sad smile crossed Jons mouth, as he remembered House Mormont. Your mother is right, he was brave, gallant and honorable. What every Knight should be. He saved our lives Jon said.

Jon then pulled some of the dry meat from his leather pouch and offered it to Lyanna so she could feed Ghost.

Lyanna started feeding Ghost and playfully petting the direwolf. Drogon sneered and turned its head away from the little girl and her new friend.

Jon stood once again and saw that Daenerys was beaming at him. The dawn had given way to the sun, the sky was blue and cloudless, and the Wall shined as bright as ever in the horizon. Jon thought this was the most perfect moment of his life. He grabbed Danys face and kissed her. He did not know how long he kissed her.

Mother, father, theyve found us. They did follow us said Lyanna with excitement.

Jons soldier instincts made him turn around quickly looking for an enemy. It was then when Drogon got up from his rest, raised his head to the sky and roared louder than Jon had ever heard or remembered.

Jons hand went for Longclaw as he scanned the surrounding area. Before he could unsheathe his sword, Daenerys hand calmly grabbed him by the wrist. She quietly pointed up, to the morning sky.

Jon raised his head and saw what Lyanna had seen. Approaching the clearing were they stood, Jon saw one more magnificent sight in this most humbling of days.

Dragons.

He counted six dragons led by a sky blue one with a dark green tail. They were all of various sizes, all smaller than Drogon. The dragons started landing in the clearing next to Drogon.

They made it mother, theyre here said Lyanna with the innocence and wonder than only a child has.

Daenerys smiled at her daughter and looking at Jon said they are here, just like us. Home

I've started rewatching the series from the start and after 3 seasons shes just kinda got on my nerves. Every scene I see with her face in it she is doing that typical generic fantasy glare just off the camera at someone who is a bad person that she doesnt like all with really epig fantasy music telling me that she is really mighty and heroic and stuff. 

And she snarks and sneers at everything everyone says and doesnt take shit from no one and is so cool and objective and awesome and it honestly feels cheap as shit and splits the show into two parts: one where everyone is human, (sort of) has gimmicks, qualities and flaws, and then theres across the pond where Daenerys is so awesomely awesome, I feel like there is an oversaturation of fantasy tropes with her that spoils the gritty, almost realistic boredom of a medieval society with conflicting politics and ideology and tension.

Daenerys just goes from one city to the other - one minor setback, and then comes out on top with some super extreme payoff that relies on the incompetency of everyone else (who is a bad guy). She just hops from city to city freeing slaves (basically single handedly) because she is really moral and stuff and she is supposed to gain the viewers approval. 

We occasionally see Barristan or Jorah bicker about something random (because they dont actually seem to do anything important, its all Daenerys pretty much) or we just see Jorahs sad face when she does something epig and unorthodox or something.

It was fun to watch that fat merchant guy roast her over her shite diplomacy because she was still a rookie at the queen gig but since then she has been so epicly epic and all the people she doesnt like have been so stupidly stupid that its just not fun to watch at all. Id rather she just took that Yunkai guys offer and sailed off to Westeros to actually get shit started instead of this endless starvation of fun and stagnation of intrigue.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

So where did this go? Well, D&amp;D is known for their subtle story telling, such as the cock jokes in season 8 meaning that Tyrion hasn't used his cock in this season and lost all intellect, subtle. Well with that we know that Dany isn't going to be declared pregnant, but will be shown in a indirect way.

Dany's child, never shown, plays an important role in the final episode of Game of Thrones. Starks are connected to warging and Targs are connected to dragons, so what would a Stargaryen be connected to? Warging into dragons. Just after Dany's death, we see Drogon approach Jon and it seems that he is about to get roasted, but last second he turns away and melts the iron throne. I believe this is caused by Dany and Jon's child warging into Drogon and deciding that they didn't want their daddy burnt so instead to destroy the thing that killed Dany, the throne. Now I know what you're thinking, a fetus couldn't possibly understand the metaphor for power that caused their moms death. And you'd be right, they instead think that the thing with swords sticking out of it stabbed their mom.

After burning the iron throne, the child still in the womb wants to be born. So without a second to say goodbye to their dad, they fly away and the baby is delivered. What comes next is up to you, but I think that D&amp;D have a good chance of making a fantastic sequel. Thanks for reading my shitpost.",13,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

So now that Game of Thrones has ended and weve all had time to let the disappointment of the final season sink in I wanted to have a go at writing how I think the ending should have gone.

First of all I want to say that I think HBO did an incredible job at bringing the books to life on screen. The first 4 seasons of the show are the best television Ive ever seen. Season 5 was still solid, but from season 6 onwards when they had well and truly past the books the quality really started to decrease. 

As soon as HBO lost the quality writing of George Martin the plot became scattered and rushed. Complex grey area characters who had previously been written so well became one dimensional and bland. Think of characters like Littlefinger and Varys; two of the biggest players in the game in the early seasons who were cunning and smart and always 2 steps ahead of everyone else, only to become near irrelevant and get killed off more for the shock value than to add to the plot. 

Character development and friendships that were formed during long difficult journeys became non-existent as characters seemed to jump long distances between episodes or even scenes. Think of the journeys and friendships shared by Tyrion and Bronn, Jaime and Brienne or Arya and the Hound to name a few. Just imagine if these characters had simply appeared in a new place every time they had to be in an important scene; wed have lost so many quality moments that made the show so special and interesting. This is exactly what happens in the later seasons. Characters move magically across the country seemingly instantly and with it we lose the opportunity to see them grow and change. 

Perhaps the greatest thing the early seasons did was keep viewers on the edge of our seats because no character seemed safe. It was the first show ever to show that actions do have consequences and the good or main character is in as much danger as anyone else. Complex, grey area characters were put into difficult situations and werent given plot armour to escape every time. Think of Ned Starks beheading, the red wedding, Oberyn vs the Mountain and Jon Snows death. Shocking, gut wrenching scenes that were hard to believe (if you hadnt read the books already). 

But come to the later seasons and watch as all of the main characters now wear plot armour so strong they can constantly be put into impossible to escape situations and be fine. Jon and Dany in particular face so many instances where they would logically be killed, only for the scene to cut away and for them to be fine when it comes back or for some ridiculous rubbish to come and save them at the very last second. All intensity is lost and the plot becomes second fiddle to huge budget CGI cinema photography (which was incredible, granted. But it doesnt compensate for poor storytelling). 

Ideally, the quality of writing from the earlier seasons remains and season 6, 7 and 8 retain 10 episodes each. Here are the major things I would have done:

Lets bring it back to when Jon is named the King in the North. After being resurrected from the dead he gives justice to those who betrayed him, is freed from his duty in the Nights Watch and retakes Winterfell. His story has so much potential at this point and I feel like this is a good place to start. In this version however, Jon is a changed man since being resurrected. He learns from his mistakes that got him murdered in the first place. He recognises that like Ned Stark before him, being too honourable was not the way to survive in this world.

From here I still have him going to Dragonstone to meet Dany. He needs the dragonglass and he is willing to take a risk because of the greater threat of the White walkers which is central to his story. Just like the show, Dany demands Jon bend the knee and Jon refuses, reasoning that they need each other and he will not betray his people.  This time however, he does not give in and bend the knee randomly after Dany has agreed to help fight the White walkers. He is grateful for her help and is willing to support her claim for the Iron throne while keeping the North an independent kingdom if they are to defeat the WW. There is also no forced romance between them which in my opinion was not convincing at all. 

Dany and her army return with Jon and the dragonglass to Winterfell to prepare for the WW. The entire plot of capturing a white to take to Kings landing never happens as it was a ridiculous waste of time which really didnt add anything to plot.

Some tension between the Northerners and Dany and her army can be some filler, but ultimately they get along well enough to face the army of the dead. Only this time they use a bit of logic and dont go sending out most of their soldiers into certain death. Instead they completely surround the castle walls with fire and have all of the soldiers behind the walls ready to defend it (the way castles are supposed to be defended). 

This episode can once again be an epic battle (but not so damn dark) in which the living manage to hold their own for a time but are eventually overpowered by the sheer weight of numbers in the army of the dead. 

Jon decides to stay near Bran to protect him which seems more true to his character than letting a few iron born guard his brother. Dany does her best to battle the Wights on Drogon with Rhaegal unmanned, and has an epic battle with the Night king riding undead Viserion. Just when it seems that the 2 living dragons have the upper hand, the Night king summons a storm and ruins their vision, attacks and mortally injures Drogon who goes tumbling towards the ground with Dany on his back. Rhaegal flies down to check his mother, leaving the Night king free to fly into the castle towards Bran. At this point the other main White walkers have entered Winterfell and have Bran, Jon and their support army surrounded. The Night king dismounts Viserion, draws his blade and walks towards Bran. Jon draws Longclaw and has a one on one sword fight with the Night king (it always felt like there was something personal between them since the battle of Hardhome). We have the epic fight weve always wanted to see and Jon manages to hold his own but is clearly no match for the Night king who seems to be toying with him. Jon manages to lead him away from Bran as they fight, giving Theon the opportunity to move Bran back into safety. 

We then cut to Dany, who survived the fall and is mourning the death of her favourite Dragon while Rhaegal stands beside them both, upset and protective of his mother. It is here that we see Rhaegals eyes roll into the back of his head before taking to the skies towards the battle again. We cut back to Bran who is clearly in his warging state, at long last controlling a dragon and fulfilling the foreshadowing from when he first met the Three Eyed Raven; You will never walk again, but you will fly.

Controlling Rhaegal, Bran launches fire across huge sections of wights, giving much needed relief to those still fighting within the castle walls. He flies in to try and help Jon, but is unable to fire towards the Night King without also getting Jon. This continues for a bit, going back and forth between this battle where Jon is starting to struggle to survive more and more and scenes with other main characters struggling to stop the seemingly never ending attack from the wights. 

Dany enters the scene with some other big characters, they are able to see the battle with the Night king and Jon from a distance but are still too overwhelmed by wights to get close enough to help.

In desperation, Jon yells just do it meaning he is willing to sacrifice himself in order to kill the Night king. When it seems there is no other option, Bran breathes an enormous stream of flame over both the Night king and Jon Snow. We lose sight of both of them for a moment as the thick fire covers them both. When the fire disappears we are left with a slowly fading smog of smoke. We see the Night king alive and unharmed first, a look of shock on his face. We see Dany, Sam, Arya, Tyrion etc with the same look of pure shock before it returns to Jon Snow rising from the smoke, a flame covered sword in hand and eyes as red as fire. Azor Ahai reborn, wielding Lightbringer. He launches to his feet and attacks the Night king who is caught completely off guard. He manages to bring his ice blade up just in time to defend himself only for it to shatter to pieces upon impact. The flaming sword pierces the Night king through the heart, shattering him and his entire army to pieces. 

While this is certainly more predictable than Arya being the one to kill the Night King, it does make a lot more sense. Jons whole story has been about stopping the WW, not Aryas. He was resurrected by the red lady on behalf of the Lord of Light for a purpose, which is ultimately not fulfilled or satisfying in the official version of the show. The Azor Ahai prophecy is also one of the biggest let downs in the show and I think this version manages to give it some justice. 

We then spend some time at Winterfell dealing with the aftermath. It is during this time that Jon Snow can be revealed to be Aegon Targerian; which leads to a huge divide between him and Dany and their armies. Dany demands that he keep his promise to help her win the Iron Throne from Cersei since she helped to defeat the white walkers. The northern lords and armies argue that Jon has the better claim, and if anything it should be Dany helping Jon to take the throne. 

Jon however, insists that he doesnt want the throne (just the once though, not every damn episode). He says that he has no problem with Dany pursuing the throne for herself, but he was done fighting and would not travel with her. Jons battle has always been about protecting the Kingdom from the big threat of the undead, he has never wanted power or responsibility yet time and time again he is given it. He was murdered for doing what had to be done only to be brought back to life, and he was willing to sacrifice himself again to defeat the Night king. Now that the threat is over Jon makes the decision himself to abandon his rights as King and join the Wildlings in returning North beyond the wall. He is a free man who can start a family and enjoy a life without the responsibilities he has had to carry for so long. 

He insists that Bran take his place as king in the north, as the last living true born son to Eddard Stark. Bran gives his classic cant be this speech because Im the three eyed raven, but says he will support Sansa in her role as Queen of the North. 

Dany, feeling betrayed and angry leaves Winterfell with the remaining Dothraki and unsullied. She feels that Jon has betrayed her by not helping her take the throne after she sacrificed so much to help his cause. She is jealous of the way the Northerners admire him and support his claim over her own. She is amazed that he too was immune to fire and of course a Targaryian with a better claim than she has. She does not trust him, despite him saying that he has no interest in the throne and that he is going north to be a free man. She is paranoid that there is such a large threat to her out there and demands his execution. Jorah refuses and tries to convince Dany that Jon is not a threat, he is a good man who saved the realm. Tyrion concurs, strongly advising Dany not to do this. If not for Jon, then at least to keep piece with the Northerners. Dany, unwilling to listen to reason gets Grey worm to double back to Winterfell and kill Jon in his sleep. 

Tyrion; outraged at Danys lack of humanity or reason, abandons her along the journey. 

Jon spends his final night in Winterfell before departing north the next morning. Ghost sleeps on the floor beside him. Grey Worm enters the room quietly but still manages to awaken Ghost. In a fast sequence of events, Ghost growls and leaps towards Grey Worm, only for Grey Worms spear to meet him in the air and pierce him straight through his torso, coming out on the other side of him and turning him into a skewer. Jon wakes up suddenly, alarmed over the commotion. Grey Worm throws his spear with Ghost crying out in pain aside, grabs a knife from beside his waist and cuts Jon Snows throat open in one swift motion. Our favourite direwolf and one of the true heroes of the show bleed out together, innocent and unarmed thanks to Danys insane quest for power. The scene cuts away with Arya staring at Jons door from the outside, Grey Worm still inside. 

Dany arrives at Kings landing for the first time. Her army is far too small to be able to compete with Cerseis which includes the Golden Company (who can actually be given more backstory and made to look fierce and awesome like in the books). If it was left to combat alone, Cersei would be assured victory. However, Dany still has Rhaegal, which realistically gives her a massive advantage. 

Cersei knows she is unlikely to be able to defeat a dragon, unless she is lucky enough for one of the scorpions to hit it. But she is a smarter player than that and will not risk losing on that chance alone. Cerseis whole story is about doing anything to stay in power. She has been the only one to play the game without caring about the lives of anybody else (besides her children, who are now all dead and Jaime who she doesnt love the same way anymore). Cersei is smart and cunning, and she knows that her best chance of defeating Dany is to create a trap. 

Cersei and Qyburn plan to allow Dany and her army easy access into the gates of Kinglanding. Most of Cerseis forces, including the scorpions are surrounding the Red Keep, making Dany hesitant to bring Rhaegal too close. They put minimal forces at the entrance and weaken the gates just enough for Danys army to make it through. By having more numbers of her army in some places and less in others, Dany and her army are unknowingly following a path chosen by Cersei and Qyburn, following a maze like mice. 

Meanwhile, Jaime has found his way back to Cersei at the top of the red keep, watching the battle unfold. He tries to get her to leave with him, down the secret passage ways in the Red Keep to a boat waiting for them to escape. Though he doesnt have the same feelings for her he once had, he ultimately wants to keep her safe and avoid as much damage happening to Kings landing as possible. 

Of course, Cersei refuses. She would rather die fighting than give up what she has had to work so hard to gain. But she seems confident. Jaime tries to convince her that there is no stopping the dragon. Cersei smirks and says well see about that. Jaime seems confused, and notices that Qyburn has a smirk on his face as well. Jaime asks them both what they have planned; they are both reluctant to answer him but he eventually deduces what it is. Cersei is well known for this move after all. 

She confirms his suspicions. They have planted large amounts of wildfire throughout the city, particularly in the area theyre leading Dany and her army into. Jaime is mortified at the idea; there are still thousands of common people in the city. Many innocent lives would be taken in the explosion. Cersei argues that Danys dragon and her armies will kill just as many if they are left to do so; and that sacrifices have to be made in order to protect many people in the long run. 

Dany and Cersei are similar in a lot of ways. They both consider the other one to be a crazy tyrant who in no good for the realm. Though Dany has been known to show kindness and compassion for others, she ultimately only does what is beneficial for her and will also do anything to win the iron throne. 

Qyburn says that now is the time to give the signal if they wish to be successful. Jaime begs Cersei one last time not to do it. She looks him dead in the eyes with a cold hard face and whispers burn them all. 

Jaime pulls his sword out, ready to do anything to protect the city. The whole scene mirrors that of the Mad King during Roberts rebellion. Jaime was forced to kill his king, forever tainting his honour and changing his own belief in whether or not he is a good man. Now he is forced to kill his Queen, his sister and the only person he has ever truly loved. Killing Cersei completes his character arc, from the man who tried to kill an innocent child in the first episode to a man willing to sacrifice everything to do what he thinks is right. 

In true Game of Thrones fashion, our joy turns to ashes in our mouth as the Mountain blocks Jaimes sword with his own, knocking it out of his weak left hand. Cersei and Qyburn swiftly leave the room while the Mountain kills Jaime. A single tear falls down Cerseis otherwise emotionless face as she walks away. 

We then get more scenes of the battle happening in the streets. We see the pure chaos of battle and the brutality of people being killed, something that GoT has always been good at showing. We see the destruction of the city and the fear of the common people who are suffering for the wars of other people. Dany is on Rhaegal, flying overhead not too high, doing her best to only kill those in Cerseis army; though that is becoming more and more difficult as the fight goes on and the armies become mixed together and move further into the city and amongst the common people. 

Dany and Rhaegal rise high into the sky as the view of the battle pans out, giving the viewer a great shot of the density of the fight and how it is primarily located within one area of the city. We see small amounts of green explosions from multiple areas, quickly moving inwards, followed by a sudden enormous explosion of wildfire, far bigger than when the sept was blown up in similar fashion. Tens of thousands of people are obliterated instantly, including almost all of Danys army and the Golden Company, a lot of the Lannister army and of course countless innocent people. 

The distraction from Jaime was enough to delay and signal and allow Dany and Rhaegal to reach a safe height. Dany looks down in horror, unable to comprehend what has just happened. Cersei looks out from the Red Keep, drinking her wine with Qyburn beside her. They were supposed to get Dany and Rhaegal in the explosion too. Qyburn suggests that they retreat to safety. 

Dany, having now lost all of her army decides theres only one option left. She flies directly at the Red Keep, full of anger and willing to risk it all in one final attempt to kill Cersei and take the throne. The scorpions fire arrows at her, but Rhaegal is quick and nimble and evades them all. He launches fire at the scorpions, destroying them and killing the men arming them. He then turns his attention to the Red keep itself, launching wave after wave of powerful fire, causing huge amounts of damage. The structure of the building begins to fail and the roof of the iron throne room collapses. Dany sees the iron throne in the corner of her eye and flies down towards it. Rhaegal lands in the middle of the throne room and lets off a mighty scream. Dany dismounts and Rhaegal takes off to the skies again, breathing fire voluptuously. 

Dany walks towards the throne while ash floats through the air, pauses next to the throne, reaches out with her right hand and touches it, just as she does in the house of the undying. Before she gets to sit down on it though, we hear Khaleesi in a thick foreign. Dany turns around, shocked to see Grey Worm approaching her, spear in hand. 

Gray Worm is all Dany can muster while she finds her thoughts. How did you get here? The city

Quick as a snake, quiet as a shadow replies Grey Worm, who continues to approach her. This only makes Dany more confused, but she chooses to ignore it. 

Jon Snow? she asks.

Dead. Replies Grey Worm simply. Dany nods in approval and turns to look once more at the iron throne. So here we are continues Grey Worm after everything, you have won your throne. 

Yes. replies Dany coldly, but what did it cost me? She turns to look at him again. Grey Worm steps forward and thrusts his spear through Danys torso, instantly bringing her to her knees. She looks up at him, overcome with pain and confusion, coughing up blood. Grey Worm brings a hand to his face and pulls it off like a mask to reveal Arya Stark, cold and emotionless. 

The North Remembers says Arya as she pulls out a blade and slices Danys throat open in one swift motion. 

Arya avenges Jon (and Ghost), the person in her family that she always had a special connection with. She has mastered her training and truly become a faceless person. 

Dany leaves this world and goes to be with her dead husband and unborn child in the afterlife, as foreshadowed in the house of the undying. 

We can then cut to 2 future scenes. In the North, Sansa sits at the head of the table of a small council meeting featuring Bran, Tyrion, Brienne, Samwell and Varys. 

Sansa has faced one of the most difficult journeys and has managed to come out of it all on top. She has been used and manipulated by some horrible people but along the way has learnt to play the game as well as anyone. Queen in the North is a fitting end for her story, surrounded by people she knows and trusts. 

I think it is safe to assume no one really saw Bran becoming king, and to be honest it was a massive let down considering how the throne has been the central part of the entire series. Maybe in theory it could work with better writing and more time dedicated to that story, but for me Brans story  like Jons, has been about protecting the realm from the White Walkers. His moment of triumph was warging into a dragon and helping to defeat the Night king. I would like to include some more clarity about his abilities as the three eyed raven and the history between him and the Night king, as that was all left pretty ambiguous. I think it is fitting that he does not take on the power as King in the North but is instead a trusted advisor to Sansa.

Tyrion I think finally finds what he thought he had found in Dany, a queen that he believes in. I feel like Tyrion has always had a soft spot for the Starks and for the North and will fit in well advising Sansa. The fact that he is still Cerseis enemy after all this time seems fitting. 

Brienne stays true to her oath made to Catelyn stark. She will protect Sansa and offer her council where necessary. I did love Jaime knighting her and would love to have that included somewhere still, though I didnt like the romance that followed as I always saw their relationship as platonic and respectful. 

Samwell seems destined to be a maester or even grandmaester eventually, but that was extremely unrealistic how he was able to become one instantly in the show. It takes many years of training and studying to become qualified, and Im sure he is happy to take his time, reading many books and raising baby Sam with Gilly. 

Varys was without doubt one of the best characters on the show and deserved better than the ending he got. He obviously cant go back to Cersei after all he has done but I like the idea of him still conspiring and manipulating people from the shadows. Supporting Sansa at this stage makes the most sense for him. 

During this small council meeting someone can mention Arya going West on a ship. I think this was a satisfying ending for her character but her scene killing Dany is a better final screen moment to give to one of the most mysterious and bad-ass characters. 

In Kings Landing, Cersei sits at the head of the table of the table of a small council meeting featuring Qyburn, Littlefinger, the Mountain and Bronn. 

When you play the game of thrones you win, or you die, there is no middle ground.  Cersei to Ned stark in season one. Throughout the show, Cersei is the only person who has truly understood the game and played it as ruthlessly as possible. She has not been weakened as others have by honour, love or duty. She deserves to sit the iron throne because she is willing to pay the price for it that nobody else has. Cersei has lost her children, who she loved more than anything in the world. Her father, who she respected and learned from. And her brother Jaime, who she came into the world with and loved like a woman loves her husband. She has been consumed by her quest for power and now that she has it she is destined to live a bitter life of loneliness, repairing the city and realm she has destroyed. 

She surrounds herself not so much with people that she trusts but with people who fear her and use her power to their own advantage. Qyburn is an extremely interesting character, intelligent and level headed with no ethics and a huge amount of curiosity. 

I was a bit torn on what to do with the Mountain as Cleganebowl was actually done really well and gave the Hound the ending he deserved. But I also really like the idea of Cersei constantly being followed by this mute zombie thing that shows no emotion or human characteristics  perfectly personifying her darkest side. He is also a constant reminder of Jaime, and the lengths she was willing to go for her own selfishness. 

Bronn became a bit of a fan favourite thanks to his witty one liners and the interesting storylines he shared with Tyrion and Jaime. But ultimately I see Bronn as someone who only cares about himself. He is a talented fighter with questionable ethics who will do just about anything for money, it seems fitting that he serve Cersei who is able to provide just this. 

I dont think Cersei ever found out that Littlefinger was involved in killing Joffrey, so it seems plausible that he could wiggle his way back into power here.  That whole storyline with him trying to divide Sansa and Arya was some of the worst writing the show has ever had. They killed him off purely for the twist which in my opinion was both cringe-worthy and disrespectful to one of the best characters in the show. While Varys schemes in the north, Littlefinger schemes in the south. 

In real life however there is no ending to things. The show may stop but the game will always continue. I think this ending better represents the harsh reality of life that Game of Thrones was once so good at portraying while delivering more satisfying conclusions to the biggest characters and storylines.

Arya fled north from Harrenhal, and there was a scene in the crossroad's inn, we are not told where the brotherhood's cave is, but we know they are ""a day ride"" from Riverrun.

When Melisandre takes in a boat Gendry, we see the red fort in the background, and she tells him he is Robert's bastard, later they arrive at Dragonstone.

After looking in the map, it makes no sense to me, going to King's Landing will require them to go south and then sail north to Dragonstone.
two solutions may please me, but they seem to dumb:
a. Melisandre wanted to tell Gendry he has king's blood next to King's Landing.
b. Sailing to Dragonstone from wherever the brotherhood was is risky, but it must be the sail that is risky, because going to King's Landing on foot, surrounded by Lannisters, is quite dumb.",3,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

So what this means is that each character needed their own screentime before, so we would spend each episode jumping around from character storyline to character storyline, with each storyline progressing only a bit per episode. But with seasons 7/8, theres more group scenes which develop all the characters storylines at the same time, which means we move along with all the characters more efficiently. Were not getting any less scenes with each character, were just getting all the characters at the same time, so it takes less screentime to stay updated with them all. We dont have to do 4 different scenes to keep up with Jon, Arya, Bran and Sansa, because we have all 4 in the same scene now. Season 8 may have the fewest episodes, but I think if you measured it out, it actually probably has the most screentime for Jon, Dany, Arya, Sansa, and MAYBE Bran, of any season.

For example, if Dany going mad had happened in like season 5 or 6... it wouldnt have been given any more scenes... it would be the same number of scenes and same amount of screentime for Dany... it just would have been more broken up across more episodes, and thus it would give us more weeks in between scenes to experience it... whereas in season 8, theres no need to jump around so much, so we can pack those scenes into one episode. Same amount of time with Dany, but were not spending time in between each of her scenes to check in with Maergery and Littlefinger and Theon and Arya in Braavos and Jon at Hardhome, etc... because most of them are dead and Jon and Arya are a part of Danys storyline now, so we check in with them all concurrently.

Personally, I kind of prefer it that way in many ways. Sure, you lose a bit of the intimacy with each individual character since they are usually in groups instead of on their own, but we get more of an ensemble feel with seasons 7 and 8, because all the characters are actually interacting with each other, and were focusing more on the larger story that plays between all of them. And it may feel like youre getting less because its going by faster, but each episode feels more like a full movie, covering a more complete piece of storytelling than the previous seasons episodes did. I remember in seasons 1-6, each episode would often feel like it was just a tiny bite from each storyline, and it would often feel a bit too broken up. I would love an episode like Blackwater, where it stayed focused on one storyline (or two or three storylines converging) and more storytelling got completed in an episode to make it feel more complete as a piece. It feels faster, but its no less time spent with the characters. Its just being shown more efficiently.",6,0,False,self,,,,,

I am so angry with how flat on it's face it fell at the end. In retrospect they should have merged season 7 with the first portion of 8 then stretched the last bit of 8 into its own full season. But that is not the road they went down. So the question remains, can you save game of thrones by just rewriting the last 6 episodes? I think its possible, and not only possible I want to do it with only 4.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 I felt episode 8.1 did a great job setting up the season, 8.2 was the high mark of the season so we are going to leave that untouched. If you could tack the good bits of 8.1 to the beginning of 8.2 and leave all the good of 8.2 that would be ideal and give you another episode to play with, but we aren't going that route.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\- First the Battle will play out in much the same way it did. Poor tactics and all. I can get past all that stupidity. Maybe make it look like more than 13 people make it out of this. (Ideally i think you have the Living do surprisingly well against the dead until the WW join the fight. Cause wouldn't that be cool WW actually fighting? It would also make Arya's jump off screen make more sense, less witnesses and all that jazz). But this post is going to be long enough without breaking down the whole damn battle.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Subverted Expectation's (hopefully properly) follow so be warned:

&amp;#x200B;

\- The NK kills Theon and begins his slow march towards Bran. We see the cool montage as our heroes make their last stands. Most of them play out the same way except more living folks (IE dothraki and Unsullied) to use later in the season so suddenly having what seems like a fully restocked army at KL isn't as jarring.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Splice these next scenes into the montage as you see fit. Once again im hitting the main points of what im changing for the sake of keeping this shortish.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Jon is huddled down behind the rock  hiding from Viserion, when he sees Arya. He nods to her and to the door leading to the God's Wood. She Nods back and Jon begins to pump himself up to stand and face his likely doom.

&amp;#x200B;

\-As Jon gets the dragon's attention we see Arya dart off towards the door, however she goes down one of the side doors instead of the main door. (maybe an ominous drumbeat here or something). As Arya enters the alcove she skids to a halt and the camera zooms out and we see a part of a white walker come into frame.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Viserion gets Ready to kill Jon but just as he is getting ready to something slams into the dragon. Then many more. The sound of caws can be heard as more and more black shapes slam into the dragon its body falling apart under the onslaught. Jon turns to see it is a huge flock of ravens (with milk white eyes if you are quick to spot it)

&amp;#x200B;

\- The shot cuts back to the NK who is almost to Bran, A single loud ravens caw breaks to music that had been welling. The NK turns his head back to see Jon standing in the Doorway Longclaw in hand. The NK Signals for his retinue of WW to part allowing him to take on Jon himself.

&amp;#x200B;

\-They Charge one another and an epic sword fight begins. Jon fights skillfully landing many blows that the NK seems to shrug off. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-Eventually Jon is exhausted and the NK slaps Longclaw away throwing Jon to the ground.

&amp;#x200B;

\- The Night King proceeds to beat Jon to the verge of unconsciousness and draws an ice dagger.

&amp;#x200B;

\-As he pulls the dagger, he is stopped from delivering a killing blow by some invisible force. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-The camera begins focus in on the weirdwood above his shoulder and zooms in. We see brann his hand touching the weirdwood, warg eyes, a frehsly carved symbol dripping with blood red sap a white walker symbol.

&amp;#x200B;

\- All of the WW are frozen in place. The NK with great effort begins to surge forward. Its clear the force he is battling is strong but he is a creature of sheer will. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-He becomes singularly focused on Bran. The camera will flash between him and brann, focusing only on their faces as he approaches.

\- As he approaches Bran's eyes go from milk white to blue. When the NK is almost to Bran the camera moves to Bran's face his eyes a deep dark pupiless blue .

&amp;#x200B;

\- Suddenly We here a sword cutting through flesh, we see bran gasp, his eyes quickly returning to their natural color but devoid of life. The camera pans down to a Valerian steel dagger plunged through his chest, as the camera pans back up it zooms out we Arya  over Bran's shoulder eyes locked on the NK, her eyes are losing the worg as the camera reaches them, shes starts to shudder as she realizes what has happened. We hear ice begin to crack. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Que disintegrating dead montage.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Add a scene  around when Danny is cradling jorah, of arya cradling brann, and jon holding arya.

&amp;#x200B;

Behind the episode. 

&amp;#x200B;

   My logic behind this is simple. It gives Brann something to do. It lets Arya fill her roll without having to be a literal flying plot device. I toyed around with having Arya take the face of the white walker, and stabbing the NK but it didnt feel right, and then you would have to address how the power of the faceless men applies to WW's.  Jon gets to fight the NK and is inadvertently responsible for ending the long night.

&amp;#x200B;

   I read the whole Jon Distracting the Dragon theory a while back, and I really liked It. I feel this scene shows the relationship between Jon and Arya. Jon knows he cannot reach the NK with the dragon in his way. He understands on some level what Arya has become. Arya on the other hand is driven, in this moment she is noone, she will accept her brother's sacrifice so she can get the job done. I made her run to the side because she is an assassin she is not going to charge in at the NK. She stumbles upon a white walker that she deals with off screen to give time for a fight betwen Jon and NK. 

&amp;#x200B;

Brandon's whole TER arc culminating in becoming king is dumb, pointless fantasy dribble. The fact that the Stark children for the most part get happy endings is once again dumb. Bran using his powers' and sacrificing himself ( a throw back to how he wanted to be an honourable knight) because of it is a rewarding end to the character. Using Arya as a weapon, allows for some more development of Arya. She will be a bit traumatized which i will delve into in my next post.

&amp;#x200B;

I really liked writing this out, and wanted to thank you for making it this far. I know the grammar is bad, and the spelling I am sure is even worse. Maybe next time i will just make a Youtube video instead lol.

(Theory),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/c49e02/spoilers_the_end_of_s08e03_might_have_been/,AmElros,1561315410,"Sorry if that passage was already given, but I stumbled on that passage while rereading the books.

A Storm of Sword, Arya Chapter, Page 593:

The Brotherhood Without banner is on top of High Heart and Thoros, Lem and Beric are sitting with the Dwarf Witch and she says this:

""I dreamt a wolf howling in the rain, but no one heard his grief,"" the dwarf woman was saying. ""I dreamt such a clangor I thought my head might burst, drums and horns and pipes and screams, but the saddest sound was the little bells. I dreamt of a maid at a *feast with purple serpents in her hair, venom dripping from their fangs. And later I dreamt that maid again, slaying a savage giant in a castle built of snow"" She turned her head sharply and smiled through the gloom, right at Arya. ""You cannot hide from me, child. Come closer, now""*

And after that the dwarf women panic saying that Arya smell of death.

Now my theory is that the first part, the battle with the sad little bells, could be the burning of Kings Landing (it make sense in my head anyway) and the Maid would be Arya. The venom from her purple hair is used to kill Frey during is feast and the Savage Giant could be the Night King, the castle of snow Being Winterfell.

Suddenly the Night King appears in a random location of your choosing on modern day Earth, he has his dragon but whether or not he has his White Walkers or wights or spiders is up to you. This scenario theorises how the Night King would fair in the real world, would he succeed and wipe us out, or would he be completely annihilated?

&amp;#x200B;

Let's set some rules for this fight.

1. Game of Thrones and A Song of Ice And Fire do not exist in this timeline, and nothing is written to replace it, the world would be entirely unprepared for the concept of the Night King and White Walkers with the only undead in media being generic zombies.
2. Other than that one difference this timeline is **exactly** the same as this timeline, there are no real life fairy tales or mythological creatures or magic.
3. The Night King appears suddenly out of no where, he has no myths or legends about him, he simply appears overnight in a random location of your choosing with the goal of the extinction of humanity.
4. The Night King and Wights have the same abilities and stats as they do in the show and books, it doesn't matter if that power or stat is impossible or unlikely in the real world, they still have it.
5. The Night King still has a zombie dragon, however whether or not he still has his entire army of the dead is up to you.
6. The Night King can still only be killed by obsidian or Valyrian steel, no exceptions.
7. Season 8 will mostly be ignored for this scenario.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that we've got the rules set let's first look at what the Night King has going for him;

* A couple of more thousand years worth of dead bodies.
* Wights with guns.
* Wights don't die from bullets as easily as humans do.
* A modern day military would be stricken with confidence that shooting something would work, and considering he would be in the real world this means the militaries of the world would be ignorant of and even at first at least scoff at the idea of the Night King being a supernatural non-natural threat... what's a good word for a threat that is fictional but then is suddenly not fictional?
* The Night King would be unhindered by CGI budgets, he would have a properly sized army that would indeed have animals in it, whether or not he has the giant spiders however is another thing up to you.
* Regular bullets, just like swords, simply shatter on contact with a White Walker.
* As said in rules the rules about Valyrian steel, dragon glass and fire still apply, however as Valyrian steel is a completely fictitious metal humanity in this scenario doesn't have access to it, and obsidian is a material that is not only surprisingly fragile in real life, but also isn't really a material one would think would do anything against the army of the dead, as such it is highly unlikely it would be utilised by the military, and of course fire doesn't affect the actual White Walkers.
* While the Night King cannot turn machinery into wights, as the wights have been seen using weapons and even chains to pull up a dead dragon from a frozen lake it is not hard to assume the wights could hijack these vehicles and use them.
* The armies, politicians and governments of today are fickle, cowardly and petty, and even though it is without question that many would join to fight the army of the dead, it is also likely we'd have multiple Cersei's.

&amp;#x200B;

But here's the things we have going for us, and is going against him;

* While the militaries of the world would indeed be unprepared and perhaps too confident and cocky at the start it is still the highly adaptive, resourceful, strategic and powerful military of today, the militaries will not have an intelligence decrease in this scenario.
* We have better technology and therefore better and more plentiful resources, we have huge maze like cities and better higher more sturdy walls.
* The Westeros armies only had men on horsebacks and a pair of dragons, we have armadas of bomber planes, ballistic missiles, tanks and other armoured vehicles to bulldozer over wights, flamethrowers, napalm, and of course potential experimental weaponry we'd develop in reaction to the armies of the dead, while we may not have dragons, we have something arguably even more powerful.
* The Night King also cannot kill and resurrect machinery, but if like said above he hijacks it, we could still potentially make use of self-destruction to stop that happening.
* And like said previously it isn't impossible that the Night King would try to hijack our war vehicles, but whether or not the Night King would be able to multitask controlling a large amount of wights using technology far more complicated than a horse is up for debate, there's also the question of if the Night King could even figure out how to drive these very complicated vehicles that take years of training to drive.
* Every single army in the world can join in on this, whereas in GoT only a handful of Westeros armies with two of Daenarys' armies were able to join the fight.
* We can mass burn our dead.
* No matter where the Night King is, if all the armies of the world come together to stop this apocalyptic threat he would be flanked and rammed up the ass by different armies.

Acolyte of Citedial. 

I read youre latest volumes, in the series of Ice and Fire. It was interesting. Its amusing to see history distorting itself. No one means to lie... but the truth is never what gets told. 

I felt compelled to write this. Just one record of the truth. Partially for my sanity, and partially to see if anyone ever finds it. Ever reads it. Ever believes. 

While your volume seven and eight and rife with inaccuracies, I wish to focus on one for now; he one you call the Mad Queen. The beautiful Daenerys Targaryen.

Was she mad?  
It may be justifiable to call her that.   
But she wasnt rash. Or impulsive. Or cruel.   
Not by intention. Although some may justifiably perceive that way. 

She simply saw a horrible truth, and did what she thought was right. But lets start at the beginning. 

...

Daenerys was a young girl.
And knew little of ways of war. 
But **no one** knew when it came to Obsidian.

Its almost like its named to be insidious.  

Dragon glass was how she knew it.
And what could be frightening about dragon glass to the Dragon Queen?
All she could notice was beautiful it was. 
The way it grabbed the light. 
The way that if you stared at it long enough, it seemed to melting.   


*Glass cant move* she mused to herself, as she sat within her cave, deep below earth. 
She was home, finally. And she powerful, finally. And she was ready to do what she needed to do, *finally*. 
What was there to fear? Really.  

And so that dainty young girl ran delicate fingers across the glass; just to feel that it solid. 


She was annoyed when she pricked herself. When a shard of glass found her way between her nail and skin. A thin piece had lodged itself deep inside her. 

It didnt bleed, but it hurt. It was an irritating pain. Pulsing.  She tried to forget it, she tried to get on with duties, but the pain that wouldnt go away. 

Im sure you are familiar with Greyscale. The stone illness that slowly consumes a man, and turns him into little more than an animated rock. Well dragon glass has a similar effect, it turns you into the animated, walking, sometimes even living dead. You stop growing, you stop consuming resources, and eventually you start to die. 

Its a rare illness. But even rarer is the blood of the dragon. Fire made flesh can fight the cold grasp of death. And thats what happened. The illness ravaged her, but couldn't consume her fully. She stopped growing, but never decayed. She died, but still lived. And something the living will never know, is how much things change when youre dead.

Her perspective grew, and the world around her shrank.   
Time began to dilate; she could watch a single snowflake drop for hours.   
And she began to hear the spirits.    
The voices of the dead. All of the dead. Including the self-crowned king of the dead, known only now as the The Night King. 

He whispered to her. He gently guided her to cruel unyielding truths. Everything she ever worked for was in vain. Every dream, was a pipe dream. The truth started soft but grew. It rang in her mind like deafened bell, reverberating off her skull, being driven by the glass in her finger. 

*Everyone was a slave.   
Everyone would always be a slave.     
Your life was decided by when and where you were born,    
More than decision you could ever make,  
And nothing,  
Nothing she could do would change that.* 

She listened.   
To the land.   
To people.   
She felt **all** the suffering of the living.   
The hunger, the grief.   
Everyone was trapped.   

At least while they were living.

...

And you see dear Sam, this is why The Queen of Ice and Fire did what she did. She wished to free people, to truly free them. And it worked. They still hail her the breaker of chains. Families live in peace and freedom. 

I dont expect you to understand Sam. You are of the living, you could never quite grasp it. But please keep this letter. Its important the living world at least have one true recollection of her. Even if its not read for a thousand thousand years.

Maybe the difference is that I didn't have to wait 9 years for the finish.  Or maybe it's because I didn't read the books and many who did had real problems.  

Bran - good choice for king; he's literally seen it all and will be a benevolent monarch; he is the exact opposite of Jofffrey or King Robert plus there is now a Stark running the north in Winterfell, the 6 kingdoms and beyond the wall. Looks like they are set up for Stark-peace for a long while.

Dany - nothing about her turn to the dark side was surprising; many times throughout the series her first impulse was to burn it all down. In the end when she was alone she was true to her nature.  She flew too close to the sun and got burned - ironic. 

Jon Snow - coin flipped opposite of Dany.  He consistently did the right thing in his eyes including shiving Dany. Retiring beyond the wall was a good ending for him and what he deserved. 

Tyrion - he faded out as the seasons went by; probably most disappointed in his character arc over time.  He lost his joi de vivre and got boring - too many lectures. 

Davos - was actually surprised he made it to the end; to me was the most likable character and I was glad to see he survived. 

Arya - I liked that she developed a will to live past just revenge killing. It was a surprise ending for her and welcome.",48,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

**Previously;**

I previously posted here about my relationship with my aunt Dana - short version: I found out that my gf Dana is my aunt and I am actually the owner of the company Dana has been wanting her whole life. My sisters Samantha and Anna have been bitching against Dana from the start (Samantha even wanted to not feed Dana's pets) and my brother Bo is always stoned and thinks that he is a raven. I signed over my claim to parts of the company to Dana and then everyone was pissed and on top of that we had to deal with the creditors (strange ones, blue-eyes, white skins, seems to multiply almost like zombies).

&amp;#x200B;

**Update on the situation:**

So, the creditors arrived and attacked the firewalls of our company. We were not the best tacticians, I have to admit, we basically sent out the entire cavalry to get killed. I am not really sure what the plan was or who even came up with said plan. Someone screwed up. Wasn't me, and I don't think that it was James or Tyrs - they are all good tacticians and have seen battle, like I have. Someone screwed up, but I am really not sure who. Only that it wasn't me, cos that plan was stupid.

Anyways, we defeated our main creditor by luring him to Bo, who was sitting around, stoned as always \*yes, that part did not make sense to me as well, I just rolled with it, as did everyone else, but for some reason our main creditor wanted my stoned brother\* and then Anna worked out some anger management issues and subverted the expectation everyone had that either Dana or I would take down our biggest creditor. Yay. It really felt anticlimatic. It felt like Dana and I had been built up to be that next big thing, but then squirrel-Anna could take our main creditor down. Yay. I mean, I even had a stare-down duel with him once and Dana had some beautiful exotic pets who could breathe fire and everyone was like really, really exited ... anyway...

Anticlimatic, right? Anyway, we still had to deal with the competitor sitting at the helm of Dana's father's old company. Let's call her Cerna. So, we had James and Tyrs, her brothers, although they have not been really helpful. James apparently has been fucking her, but he has also been fucking my sister's bodyguard Brienna, so who really knows these days and Tyrs is still dealing from a head wound and insists that ""she is not a monster, she is a mother."" All evidence to the contrary. Tyrs is not as smart as he once was. Apparently he suffers from ""adaption problem"", whatever that means.

BTW, I am not shaming Tyrs! I also had some health problems - I suffered from a speech impediment and could only say ""my Queen"" and ""I don't want it."" with hilarious results. Not.

Anyways, Dana was pissed that I could challenge her claim to being CO, and Tyrs and Vars and Samantha and Bo and ... everyone actually, were really not helping. Samantha was antagonizing her, but that's her default modus now. Vars and Tyrs kept insisting that ""I would be a good CO of the company"".... and then Dana found out and had her pet barbecue Vars. Don't blame her! She was already going through a lot at that time: the second of her three pets had been shot down by our competitor (the pet had eye vision problems and could not see a very large fleet below him, I always told them that they should take him to the optician!), her best friend had been killed by Cerna, and Vars speaking against her after she had been listening to everything he said - well - I mean - I don't know. I still had speech impediment problems then, and she was ""maaah queeen."" I hope that you understand.

Ok, then, finally the big battle. Dana easily defeats everyone with her remaining last pet, which kinda had me wondering why she did not do this in the beginning ... anyways, she then started killing everyone, because she heard bells? (don't ask me, I am still not quite sure what happened) and Cerna and James died together as they kissed each other under the only part in the cellar of the castle that was destroyed. I mean, I know that james has not the brightest, but really if they had just moved two feet ---Then Dana was the CO of the Company and I killed her. I mean, I had to - it was in the script! And her pet melted the symbol of our company and then took off with her. I am actually not entirely sure what happened, I am still behind on the plot development. I only hope that no one is disappointed. I can't emphasize this enough.

After Dana's death, there was a discussion who would take over the company. Nobody thought of me , even though I had the best claim, and Grewm, one of Dana's managers, was raising a fuss about me having murdered her. He still commands an army (kinda strange, the number of men in that army kept fluctuating, but we all thought it best just to roll with it and not make a fuss, because it seemed awfully convenient).

Then, Samantha and Bo arrived; a council was convened and all said that Bo had the best story line and that he should be CO of the company. Everyone agreed, I was sentenced to Exile (What The Fuck?) in the non-company lands (North) to appease Grewm. My sister Samantha declared that she would have one part of the company and become independent. (Later, some other managers from The Maritime and Desert Section asked me if that had been an option,cos if so, they would like to change their votes and also become independent. At this point, I must admit I was pretty pissed and told them to f\*ck off and took the first ship out. I saw Grewm leaving on another ship, so I am not even sure what the exile thing was about .... The entire thing is fucked up and Bo can deal with it.)

**Now:**

When I came to the North, the first thing that happened was that my pet Ghost, my good old doggo, bit me, when he saw me, and my old friend Torsten - upon learning that James had died - relocated back to HQ and Bo, muttering something about ""fat chance"" and ""try my luck"". No idea why. But he seemed in an awful hurry and was whistling the entire time.

**Finally:**

I am not sure why I post here, but I would just like to get it of my chest - the company is now in the hands of my stoned brother Bo, Ghost is ignoring me (seemed to be pissed at me), my sister is apparently on a one-woman rampage in her own company, everybody seems to have won and I have frost bite on my butt.

I think I just need a hug - it just feels like my entire life has been building towards some glorious goal (hell, I was even raised from the dead) and now I am sitting here alone with only a pissed off pet to keep me company.

Anyone understand my pain?",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

She was already going through a lot at that time: the second of her three pets had been shot down by our competitor (the pet had eye vision problems and could not see a very large fleet below him, I always told them that they should take him to the optician!), her best friend had been killed by Cerna, and Vars speaking against her after she had been listening to everything he said - well - I mean - I don't know. I still had speech impediment problems then, and she was ""maaah queeen."" I hope that you understand.

Ok, then, finally the big battle. Dana easily defeats everyone with her remaining last pet, which kinda had me wondering why she did not do this in the beginning ... anyways, she then started killing everyone, because she heard bells? (don't ask me, I am still not quite sure what happened) and Cerna and James died together as they kissed each other under the only part in the cellar of the castle that was destroyed. I mean, I know that james has not the brightest, but really if they had just moved two feet ---Then Dana was the CO of the Company and I killed her. I mean, I had to - it was in the script! And her pet melted the symbol of our company and then took off with her. I am actually not entirely sure what happened, I am still behind on the plot development. I only hope that no one is disappointed. I can't emphasize this enough.

After Dana's death, there was a discussion who would take over the company. Nobody thought of me , even though I had the best claim, and Grewm, one of Dana's managers, was raising a fuss about me having murdered her. He still commands an army (kinda strange, the number of men in that army kept fluctuating, but we all thought it best just to roll with it and not make a fuss, because it seemed awfully convenient).

Then, Samantha and Bo arrived; a council was convened and all said that Bo had the best story line and that he should be CO of the company. Everyone agreed, I was sentenced to Exile (What The Fuck?) in the non-company lands (North) to appease Grewm. My sister Samantha declared that she would have one part of the company and become independent. (Later, some other managers from The Maritime and Desert Section asked me if that had been an option,cos if so, they would like to change their votes and also become independent. At this point, I must admit I was pretty pissed and told them to f\*ck off and took the first ship out. I saw Grewm leaving on another ship, so I am not even sure what the exile thing was about .... The entire thing is fucked up and Bo can deal with it.)

**Now:**

When I came to the North, the first thing that happened was that my pet Ghost, my good old doggo, bit me, when he saw me, and my old friend Torsten - upon learning that James had died - relocated back to HQ and Bo, muttering something about ""fat chance"" and ""try my luck"". No idea why. But he seemed in an awful hurry and was whistling the entire time.

**Finally:**

I am not sure why I post here, but I would just like to get it of my chest - the company is now in the hands of my stoned brother Bo, Ghost is ignoring me (seemed to be pissed at me), my sister is apparently on a one-woman rampage in her own company, everybody seems to have won and I have frost bite on my butt.

I think I just need a hug - it just feels like my entire life has been building towards some glorious goal (hell, I was even raised from the dead) and now I am sitting here alone with only a pissed off pet to keep me company.

Anyone understand my pain?",1,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

I think GRRM is a great writer since he wrote such true, and complex characters that resonate with people. Id love to know how it applies to you as a person since I feel that GRRM was really writing about our modern society but just based it in fantasy and medieval times.

&amp;#x200B;

For me, I used to think I was John Snow and Jamie Lannister but as I learned and read more I was really Jamie Lannister(with some Jon Snow thrown in there). I was a guy that was shunned early in life (5-7th grade) since I moved to a real trash, white trash, racist, evil school, and I became friends with Whoever would have me and I ended up with degenerates, or was considered a bad kid due to the crowd I ran with. This went on  into middle school, even though everyone hated my group of friends (Stoners, bad kids, degenerates, etc..) I didnt care since they were loyal to me (or so I thought). So I got a bad reputation when I didnt even do drugs, I just rolled with them.

&amp;#x200B;

Then high school, I became a popular guy, talented at sports, etc but people would claim or see me as a good guy but, I was always seen as scum for being friends with those people from before. Ive had people throughout my life give tales of me, my ways, my honor etc and those that knew me would be shocked since they saw how noble and good I was (sort of like Jamie Lannister). Though I did something wrong, I always tried to do what was right while keeping my loyalties. As I grew older into college and beyond, Ive dealt with that. People talking bad of me, thinking I was arrogant or cocky (Some of that was in there), but I ultimately good, so when things did go awry, people would and have stood up for me and my character like Brienne and Tyrion did for Jamie. So I relate to him the most.

&amp;#x200B;

Im a bit Jon Snow, but mainly the part about Getting along with everyone. I can befriend anyone. Regardless of race, religion, creed, country I make it a point to be friendly, and help if I can, and keep my word. Thats how I'd like them.

&amp;#x200B;

So which characters do you think you are? Which characters encompass your personality or do you see yourself as, and why? ( I think its just an interesting and fun question, and Id love to know. As my friends and I always have these fun talks about this when it comes to this story.)",31,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Here are my main questions/comments about the state of Westeros following the series finale:,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/c54sm5/spoilers_i_never_liked_game_of_thronesbutbeing_a/,kevjmatt,1561449256,"1. Question: &gt;!Whos the warden of the Westerlands!&lt; now?? Weve got &gt;!Bronne in the Reach (which I have mixed feelings about but good enough), the most wholesome Baratheon in history at Storms End, the lovable idiot brother of Cat in the Riverlands, #1 sister Yara in the Iron islands, a random back-up Martell cousin in Dorne, the spoiled kid in the vale (surprised the show never wrote its way to a replacement), the Queen in the North (Hell yeah), and Bran in Kings landing...so is anyone doing anything anymore in the Westerlands or are all the minor lords still celebrating the end of the Lannisters?  I like to think they gave it to Tyrion, and he just kept the Lannister name and symbol but just turned the image around for the better.  He could definitely father children, and I honestly think it would be cool to have a house in the future known for such a large number of them being dwarves (and yes, children of parents with achondroplasia have close to a 50/50 chance,1/4 if one parent, of being born with it as well), showing their lineage to such an awesome guy and the  savior to their house.  Also as a great generations-lasting middle finger to Tywin and Cersei.  Either that or I considered Podrick with house Payne but he seems happy enough in the kingsguard. !&lt;

2.  Comment:  &gt;!Despite so many people being disappointed with the ending (and I have my issues with it) Im overall pretty happy with it.  Mainly the lord-elected system for king.  I like the house lines lasting within the lordships, but I also think its a good idea to have a central government keeping among the different kingdoms (except for the north, the Starks are cool) but one that doesnt inherit it, so there wont be any disputes over birth right.  Im obviously not vouching for that kind of monarchical/aristocratic/etc in real life *beats chest in American* but it works for that world, or at least at that worlds place in time...also house sigils and thrones are really cool (thats what kept drawing me back to this show in the first place).  And yes...Bran has zero personality left which makes him hard to follow him as a character anymore, but kind of like what Tyrion said, thats kind of a good thing, also someone who knows all of the 100% truthful history and bits of the present?? Sounds like quite the problem solver.  Also hes a Stark, and, like I said, Starks are pretty awesome.  I will say I am disappointed with Jons (Im not calling him Aegon...) ending, it is a little touching and poetic for him to be back at the wall...but I just feel like he belongs doing so much more.  I love that Sansa is Queen in the North, but maybe Bran could change the law and Jon could be like a part-time/on and off nights watch guy? Maybe do some traveling with Arya? I also love that they have her sailing west, and I hope theres some future content maybe about whatever she finds (we all know she has to find something...) and like an update on Westeros as well (dont shoot, I havent read the books, and Im sure theyre great but I dont really plan to).!&lt;

3.  Minor/not very plot-important Question: &gt;!Where the hell is Meera Reed? She just kind of dipped after dropping Bran off at Winterfell.  Shed probably die (not enough main character plot armor) and Im glad she didnt, but Im surprised she and her fathers house didnt (well maybe some did that werent shown) help defend Winterfell against the white walkers.!&lt;

4. Another minor question: &gt;!What are they going to do with Dragonstone?  It would kind of such to let such an awesome castle go to waste.  To be honest with Kings Landing so heavily destroyed I thought that would be come the new seat of power.  I guess they could just give it to some trusted lord in the crownlands, I just cant think of anyone.!&lt;

5. MAJOR/very important Comment: &gt;!Hot pie should have been made head chef/cook of the red keep, or given a minor lordship, or a little gold... something!  He was an ass in the beginning but then ended up being an awesome guy who makes large, medieval-versioned animal crackers for his friends when he sees them off.  And he played a huge role inWinterhells fate, he told Arya that Jon defeated the Boltons...without that she mightve never made it up there in time for the Great War...and who wouldve been there to kill the damn night king?!  The realms of men might just owe Hot Pie as much as they do Arya, or I maybe someone else wouldve told her soon after, but still, he was a loyal friend with valuable culinary skills.  Not a lot of those around in Westeros.!&lt;

Alright I thought I was going to have more questions but I answered most of them myself in the meantime.  And most of this is just for discussion and hearing other fan theories, Im sure most of it is just unwritten so there are no answers for it.  But the Westerlands thing is really killing me, once I latch onto a story I get kind of finicky.",29,6,False,spoiler,,,,,

To make an omelet you need to break a few eggs. But I could no longer do it when she continued burning down Kings Landing. I could not understand how the character I had loved could be capable of sustained cruelty. Momentary cruelty yes, but this was too much, I thought. But then I tried to really understand the character and put myself on her dragons, so to speak. Here is my best try:

The shame of her being the daughter of a madman and being exiled away from her home is too painful for her to feel. She, understandably, could not accept the shame that she was inherently broken. This makes her vulnerable to creating an ideal false self: a queen destined to free the people and stop the wheel of power that crushes all the poor people underneath as it rolls. She has a grand, noble purpose and the god-like power of destiny on her side. She believed that false self so much so that she walked into a fire. Who does that? She was lucky, but she only found out because she's goddamn mental. Can you imagine Jon Sno walking into a fire? He'd be peeing himself. And then Daenerys decides to ride a dragon. Again, who does that? Hasn't she heard you can raise a wolf puppy but when they grow up they gonna maul you? What do you think it's like for fucking dragons? She's always been mental, but she has also always been lucky. She reminds the people of her greatness and virtue, but she's really reminding Herself. She is a Targaryen after all, and that comes with connotations of insanity. That shame needs to be pushed down whenever it flares up.

Betrayal makes that shame flare up because why would anyone betray the breaker of chains, the legendary mother of dragons destined to sit on the iron throne? Only if they don't believe her story, which means they must have a reason for not believing her story, which means she starts to doubt herself too. If others don't believe her story, should she? That brings her back to that unbearable feeling that she is inherently broken. The shame must be pushed back down. The false self becomes her identity, and she must protect that persona because only empty despair and pain lay on the other side. Who is she if she is not the mother of dragons sitting upon the iron throne? When we invest ourselves in a false self, we do so at the expense of developing our true selves. When the false self finally crumbles, only an empty scaffolding remains.

Daenerys fell when the 3-eyed raven spilled the beans about Jon Sno being a Targaryen, which we assume is true. This was the moment Tyrion Lannister and Varys realize there is another option for the throne. Up to now, there was only one option, so why waste time scrutinizing it? But now they must compare, and that saying about the mental state of a Targerian being a coin toss at birth comes into play. Being betrayed by Varys means he saw through her false self and into the inherently broken Daenerys she is so desperately scared of feeling. If he saw through her, she might also catch a painful glimpse. It's hard to deny a truth everyone around you accepts. She had to prevent that, so she displaces her shame onto Varys. Varys now personifies her true self and he must disappear never to be seen again, not even his corpse. But others had seen Varys, especially Tyrion. Despite giving Tyrion his last chance, she no longer trusts him, but she denies that she has once again been betrayed; Tyrion has probably just lost his edge. However, by freeing his brother, Tyrion gives the mercy that Daenerys couldn't. That means she is the callous one in comparison. It also means he fears her because he did not try to convince her to free him. That is too close to what people thought of Daenerys' father. What is a mad king if not a callous person people fear? Tyrion has also seen through Daenerys' false self, but he cannot accept this because it goes against his own pride of being intelligent. It also means more war. He denies this until it becomes too hard to deny. Daenerys and Tyrion no longer trust each other, but neither can accept that truth.

Tyrion told her the city bells will ring when it surrenders. Daenerys now has a choice: believe Tyrion, which means Tyrion was right to free his brother and fear her as a callous woman; or label Tyrion a betrayer, in which case this means the bell-ringing is a ruse and she must attack, justifying such an atrocity by claiming Cersei used her people as a shield. Believing Tyrion means feeling once more that unbearable pain that she is defective, a pain she all too recently felt due to Varys' betrayal. Not believing Tyrion means accepting he betrayed her, which then brings the feeling of unbearable pain she so desperately wants to avoid. She had to make a choice when bells tolled for her, but there was no way out; that unbearable shame was coming and she had to defend herself from herself. She chose to mistrust Tyrion so the resulting anger and hatred could keep her false self together. Think about it, anger is often one of the first stages of grief people go through because it helps us keep it together as some sort of psychic glue when the truth is too hard to bear. We can't break down into desperation when we are angry and full of hatred. Daenerys wants to break the wheel once and for all and justifies her wrath to herself by claiming Cersei used her people as a shield. She believes that end justifies the means of burning the city to the ground and the anger and hatred launch her to action. But when she starts and hears the children screaming and fleeing it's harder to deny that she is mad. The shame keeps pushing through stronger and stronger, the cracks in her false self keep spreading and she gets angrier and more full of hatred to keep her false self together. She is not thinking about the people because she is too focused on the battle going on inside her head. 

Eventually, there is nobody left to kill and nothing left to destroy. The vicious circle stops and she can calm down. She cannot look at the damage she has caused because that is like looking into her true self. It is too painful and there is no nothing left to hate and be angry at. But at least it's in the past; now the true reign of peace can start. War is war, she used them as a shield, they left me no choice, it had to be done, etc. She chooses to narrowly focus on the symbol of her false self: the iron throne. So narrowly that she seems to not notice the destroyed building where it stands.

Jon Sno was the only person to truly love her without idolizing her. When Jon Sno kills her, she suddenly realizes who she thought believed her false self enough to love her now sees her true self clearly. When he stabs her, her false self crumbles. She may be able to trick herself into believing that her mind is not broken, but she can't deny a body broken by a dagger. What is left behind is the scaffolding of her true self. Her expression as she dies is one of empty desperation, a person who died without ever truly living. Jon Sno sees this emptiness. He is not sure if he did the right thing because he only met the true Daenerys once the dagger went in, and all he saw was that empty fragile scaffolding. So little was there that it was hard to tell when she was gone, almost needing the blood coming out of her mouth and nose to confirm she was no longer there.

Drogon sees her mother dead, but he is no closer to meeting her real self than when she was alive. Now there is no hope of ever doing so. It was not Jon Sno who killed her, it was the delusion of grandeur; the idealized false self Daenerys desperately created to escape the pain of feeling she was inherently broken. The throne had to go not because the dragon was somehow wise about the history of men fighting senseless wars for momentary power upon that throne, but because it represented Daenerys' false self, with her true self symbolized by her broken body. Or maybe the dragon was like ""If she can't have it, nobody can"". I can't really get into the mind of a dragon to be totally honest.

Daenerys never sat on the iron throne because deep inside she knew she was not who she said she was. Not really. She touched the symbol of what she thought she was, but she could not get in touch with what she really was: broken.",17,10,False,spoiler,,,,,

Acolyte of Citedial.

I read youre latest volumes, in the series of Ice and Fire. It was interesting. Its amusing to see history distorting itself. No one means to lie... but the truth is never what gets told.

I felt compelled to write this. Just one record of the truth. Partially for my sanity, and partially to see if anyone ever finds it. Ever reads it. Ever believes.

While your volume seven and eight and rife with inaccuracies, I wish to focus on one for now; he one you call the Mad Queen. The beautiful Daenerys Targaryen.

Was she mad?  
It may be justifiable to call her that.  
But she wasnt rash. Or impulsive. Or cruel.  
Not by intention. Although some may justifiably perceive that way.  

She simply saw a horrible truth, and did what she thought was right. But lets start at the beginning.

...

Daenerys was a young girl. And knew little of ways of war. But no one knew when it came to Obsidian.

Its almost like its named to be insidious.

Dragon glass was how she knew it. And what could be frightening about dragon glass to the Dragon Queen? All she could notice was beautiful it was. The way it grabbed the light. The way that if you stared at it long enough, it seemed to melting.

Glass cant move she mused to herself, as she sat within her cave, deep below earth. She was home, finally. And she powerful, finally. And she was ready to do what she needed to do, finally. What was there to fear? Really.

And so that dainty young girl ran delicate fingers across the glass; just to feel that it solid.

She was annoyed when she pricked herself. When a shard of glass found her way between her nail and skin. A thin piece had lodged itself deep inside her.

It didnt bleed, but it hurt. It was an irritating pain. Pulsing. She tried to forget it, she tried to get on with duties, but the pain that wouldnt go away.

Im sure you are familiar with Greyscale. The stone illness that slowly consumes a man, and turns him into little more than an animated rock. Well dragon glass has a similar effect, it turns you into the animated, walking, sometimes even living dead. You stop growing, you stop consuming resources, and eventually you start to die.

Its a rare illness. But even rarer is the blood of the dragon. Fire made flesh can fight the cold grasp of death. And thats what happened. The illness ravaged her, but couldn't consume her fully. She stopped growing, but never decayed. She died, but still lived. And something the living will never know, is how much things change when youre dead.

Her perspective grew, and the world around her shrank.
Time began to dilate; she could watch a single snowflake drop for hours.
And she began to hear the spirits.
The voices of the dead. All of the dead. Including the self-crowned king of the dead, known only now as the The Night King.

He whispered to her. He gently guided her to cruel unyielding truths. Everything she ever worked for was in vain. Every dream, was a pipe dream. The truth started soft but grew. It rang in her mind like deafened bell, reverberating off her skull, being driven by the glass in her finger.

Everyone was a slave.  
Everyone would always be a slave.  
Your life was decided by when and where you were born,  
More than decision you could ever make,  
And nothing,  
Nothing she could do would change that.  

She listened.  
To the land.  
To people.  
She felt all the suffering of the living.  
The hunger, the grief.  
Everyone was trapped.  

At least while they were living.

...

And you see dear Sam, this is why The Queen of Ice and Fire did what she did. She wished to free people, to truly free them. And it worked. They still hail her the breaker of chains. Families live in peace and freedom.

I dont expect you to understand Sam. You are of the living, you could never quite grasp it. But please keep this letter. Its important the living world at least have one true recollection of her. Even if its not read for a thousand thousand years.

Im rewatching from season 6 onward, and I noticed in season 7, episode 3 (around the 33 minute mark) when Cersei is talking to the guy from the Iron Bank, she says, I decapitated the Dornish snake. She mentions this as drawing first blood in the war with Daenerys. 

To the best of my knowledge, she didnt decapitate any of the Sand Snakes (Ellarias daughters), and even if she did, she wouldnt use the pronoun the to talk about only one of them. Oberyn has been dead for awhile, so it couldnt be him. This leaves only Ellaria (unless Im missing something). Does this mean that after she left her to watch her daughter die, she decided to cut her head off and they left that out? 

Or do you think shes being figurative? It just seems to me that any decapitation on this show has always been pretty literal.

Most of us loved ""Jenny of Oldstones,"" whether the Pod version or the F+TM version. When I originally watched this episode, having no idea where the story was going, I suspected--probably along with a lot of you--that because of the abdication associated with Jenny of Oldstones, Dany and Jon would forsake the throne together to be with one another, leaving someone else to rule. Obviously, things didn't go that direction.

My question is: was the song's melody only used twice: the first time when Pod sang it, and then during the credits with Florence singing it? 

I ask because it seems like, regardless of my own interpretation of it being wrong, it still should hold some king of significance/meaning for the story and--if it does--it might resurface again. But on all my listens of the soundtrack and rewatches, I don't recall ever hearing it again. I thought I had it in the throne room scene in episode six, but alas--I think it might've just been ""Truth."" This seems like a missed opportunity if they dropped it after season two. It's a gorgeous melody. 

Feel free to weigh in with interpretations of the song as well if you have them.",7,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

But what the hell does merging the Faith and Crown actually mean? Does that mean the Faith now can issue edicts and decrees with equal authority as the King? Does it mean the faith now has veto power over the King's orders and/or has to approve them? Does it mean that the Faith has massive influence in the King's orders themselves?

Everything goes the same (except Rhegal is not inexplicably sniped from impossible angles out of the blue) until the battle at Kings Landing. The battle begins much the same way, except to make it feel a bit more tense and not one sided this is when Rhegal gets taken down. 

While Danny takes out the ballistas Jamie manages to make his way into the keep with Cersei. Prior to this she was seen whispering with Qyburn about some plan. After Jamie arrives they cut back to the battle. 

Dannys army storms the city and easily defeats Cerseis forces. However, this time instead of inexplicably leveling the whole city when the bells ring Dany flies over to the keep to kill Cersei herself. At the same time Arya and the hound arrive at the keep to find the Mountain guarding the door to Cerseis chamber. The Hound battles him allowing Arya to get past. She walks in just as Danny arrives. They give each other a quick what are you doing here?! glance before turning their attention to Cersei who is sitting with her back to them. As Danny begins ranting Cersei remains silent with her back to them. Arya gets the feeling something is off and quickly rushes over to Cersei and turns her around. Both Arya and Danny a frozen in shock when they realize the women is not Cersei, but the Shame Nun, who Cersei had practically turned into her own personal Reek. As the realization of what had just happened sets in a rumbling is heard getting louder, and louder until it erupts into a bang as green flames engulf the entire city. 

The camera cuts to Cersei and a horrified Jamie on a boat making their way out to sea. Jamie, horrified at what he had just seen draws his sword and appears to be about to kill Cersei, but cant bring himself to do it. 

The camera cuts back to an injured Dany kneeling in the rubble next to whatever is left of the iron throne.

Jon opened his eyes. 

It was morning; the cold had woken him, the cold and his dreams. He hated dreaming, his dreams were always the same. He dreamt of fire, of ash, of lost love. He felt cold even though the fire was still crackling in his chimney. As he rose slowly from the bed; he felt something moving next to his bed on the cold floor. Ghost. The snowy white giant direwolf opened one of his red eyes and closed it again as he saw Jon moving from the bed to the privy.

Its no use looking at me that way, Tormund is coming soon and ye better help me this time. We cant lose to him again said Jon.

Ever since he had been exiled back North, to the real North, Tormund and him had an annual hunting competition. The hunts champion would be whoever could catch the biggest animal and bring it back to the Free Folk for a feast. The people called it: the Hunt of the Dragonrider and the Giantsbane. Tormund had won every year since Jons exile began seven years ago. This would be the seventh. Two years ago, Jon thought he would win, when Ghost helped him catch the biggest Stag he had ever seen. Tormund caught a grey bear twelve feet tall. Jon lost.

Seven years has it been that long already? Perhaps time should be measured by events and not by years Jon thought He smiled sadly as he remembered moments gone by. He thought of his sisters Sansa and Arya. He thought of Bran, the cripple boy who became King. Mostly he thought of her, he always thought of her. Daenerys.

Jon finished relieving himself, and put on his clothes and wolf-coat. He heard a knock on the door.

That will be the Giantsbane said Jon to Ghost, as he opened the door.

The giant ginger smiled at the sight of a half awoken Jon. 

Are ye ready to lose again little Crow? said Tormund.

This is the seventh year of the hunt. Seven is a lucky number, like the gods. Mayhaps the gods will smile on me this time said Jon.

Youre in the North, the old gods rule here my little Crow. Lets get started Dragonrider, I am already hungry said Tormund smiling at his old friend.

Jon picked up his Valyrian sword, Longclaw, his bow and arrows, a leather pouch with dry meat for him and Ghost to share, and some water.  Jon waited at the door as his direwolf slowly got off the floor and came to him. Once outside Tormund smiled and wished his friend good luck.

I will see you at sunset Dragonrider said Tormund amusedly. 

Same to you Tormund of Tarth said Jon smiling back at his friend

Aaaahhhh good memories said Tormund smiling to himself as he walked away from them.

The village was deserted, everybody still asleep as the sun slowly emerged from its daily slumber. Jon and Ghost started walking west towards the nearby forest. Jon had decided to walk around the edge of the forest, on the north side, to spot any animal tracks before deciding to venture into the forest to chase whatever animal might be there. It was a beautiful day Jon thought. The sky was cloudless. Only the vanishing red light from the rising sun disturbed the blueness of the sky. If he looked south he could see the Wall in the horizon. After all these years, the sight of it still took Jons breath away. There she was: bright, crying as the first rays of dawn hit her glasslike surface in the summer sun. Eternal.

After an hour or so of walking, they reached the edge of the forest.

All right Ghost; lets see what we can find. Use that nose of yours said Jon. The giant direwolf stared at Jon with its big ruby eyes before it started trotting at a slow pace while sniffing the ground in front of him for any animal scents.

Jon was walking briskly behind his direwolf, with his bow and arrow at the ready. The forest to their left looked dark and uninviting, with no signs of animal tracks. They followed the edge of the forest, but ahead of them three hundred yards away, a massive boulder blocked the path. They would either have to go south into the forest or they would have to walk around it on the north side. As they approached the massive rock, Ghost stopped.

What is it Ghost? Did you catch a scent? Jon quietly asked his wolf.

Ghost lowered its massive body, its left ear pointing backwards, the hair on its back bristled as the wolf started walking slowly towards the rock. Jon followed, bow and arrow ready. They slowly followed the circumference of the rock as they moved northwards around it and away from the forest.  

Jon was about twenty yards away from the edge of the boulder; he would be able to peak on the other side. Ghost started snarling its teeth as Jon reached the edge of the boulder with his bow ready.

Ill shoot it and you hold it down. Then Ill come running behind you to end it with Longclaw he whispered to his direwolf.

Jon quickly moved to the other side of the boulder ready to strikeand he froze.

There in front of him, on the other side of the boulder at the edge of the forest resting on the ground was something he hadnt seen in seven years, and something he thought he would never see again in his life.

A Dragon.

The beast rested on the ground, its black scales as dark as night, massive in its length. Its long neck bent over its right wing, as if distracted by something on the other side. From where he stood Jon could only see the Dragons left profile. Its left wing was half raised, while its long tail rested on the ground by the trees.

Jon could not see the dragons face, but he knew who it was. Here at the end of the world, rested the dragon that burnt the Gold Road, the one who brought fire to the Long Night, the dragon that fought its brother in the clouds above Winterfell, the one that had rescued Jon beyond the Wall, the bane of Kings Landing, the one who melted the Iron Throne; and took its dead Mother away in the darkness across the Narrow Sea. The only living dragon left in the world.

Drogon.

Jon stood there watching the magnificent beast, as Ghost remained slightly behind him by the boulder. He lowered his bow and arrow, as he took half a step towards Drogon. His black leather boot was loud in the flat rocky path, and the dragon turned its massive neck around until he found the source of the noise. Jon. 

Drogon stared at Jon, with its mouth and nostrils slightly opened. The dragons head was no more than fifty yards away.

Jon stared back at the dragon silently, unsure of what to do. From the corner of his eye, he thought he saw something moving behind the dragons left wing. He slowly turned his gaze from the dragons eyes to its wing. There, stepping from behind the wing appeared a vision of his past, the reason his heart felt empty and his guilt never-ending. 

Daenerys Targaryen.

Jons bow and arrow made a loud noise on the rock as they fell from his hand. He stood there stony and silent, as the statues of the old Kings of Winter in the crypts of Winterfell. He thought it must be a dream, a cruel one. 

Dany? he muttered silently.

Daenerys smiled softly as she pet Drogons wing and started walking towards Jon. She looked as radiant as ever, as if time had stopped by. Her long silver blonde hair moved freely down to her waist. She had a small braid dangling from her forehead to her neck. Her indigo eyes shone as bright as the ice of the Wall in the morning sun. She wore the same white and grey sheep coat that she used to wear when visiting the North.

She stopped three steps away from Jon, as she stared at him with soft eyes and smiled sadly at him. Jon felt those three steps were a greater chasm than crossing the Narrow Sea. He felt his knees buckle under the weight of his aching heart.

Da..Danyhow? Jon asked sheepishly

The Lord of Light, she said simply. Drogon took me East. The followers of RHllor brought me back, just like you. Now we both have scars in our hearts.

DanyIm sorryI Jon said. He could not say anything else. The words escaped him as they left his mouth. Jons eyes reflected the pain and sorrow in his heart, as the tears started forming and gently streaming down his face.

Daenerys took the final steps between them and stood there looking at his old lovers eyes, as she softly touched his face and wiped the tears away. Jon saw that she was smiling at him as her own tears streamed down her fair cheeks. For the first time in seven years he felt hope, the hope that only love can bring to a mans heart. 

Jon gently grabbed her hands and stared into her eyes, terrified that this moment would disappear and he would only have a vague memory of it. Terrified it would disappear, like a dream that is forgotten when the body is suddenly awoken.

Where have you been all this time? Jon said softly.

Volantis. That is where I was given the kiss of life. I stayed there for some time, and then went back to the Great Grass Sea said Daenerys.

DanyIm sorry said Jon. He wanted to say so much more to her, but the words betrayed him.

I know you are. I had many enemies in my first life, but I did not think I would die at the hands of the noblest man I knew. The man I loved she said with some pain in her voice.

At first, I wanted to come back with Fire and Blood once again. However, having life again changed mewith time, I understood your choice she said.

I should have tried to convince you some other wayI Jon said. 

Daenerys gently squeezed his hands. You were right, and so was Varys. I lost my way on my path to the Iron Throne. I became what I always struggled to keep at bay. I became my fathers daughter Daenerys said regretfully.

Life was given back to me, and I hadother things to mindso I went back to the Dothraki Sea, away from the world she said with a smile on her face.

Even with his eyes full of tears as he stared at Daenerys, Jon caught a slight movement from the corner of his eyes. He saw as Drogons gargantuan head turned around to its right, as something appeared from behind its right wing. It was the most beautiful sight that Jon had ever seen in his life. 

A little girl.

The little girl could not have been older than six years old, Jon thought. She started walking slowly towards Daenerys and Jon. She had fair skin and her eyes were a brighter shade of indigo than Daenerys. She had two silver hair braids on each side of her face down to her neck. Targaryen hair Jon thought. 

As she approached them, he noticed that her hair in the middle was not silver, but black and wavy. His heart started racing, as if it was trying to tell him something about this most beautiful of creatures.

The little girl wore a sheep coat, half black and half red with a grey silver band across the middle. This is what Jon thought Daenerys must have looked like when she was that age, except for the patch of black hair. Jon had no doubt this girl was Daenerys Targaryens daughter. He noticed that she was holding a wooden figurine, a toy of some sort. It was a wooden dragon, painted sky blue except for its dark green tail. She stopped about five yards from them.

Daenerys let go of Jons hands and approached her daughter. She grabbed her hand and brought her closer to Jon, no more than one foot away.

This is your father my love. He was a King, and his name is Aegon Targaryen, the sixth of his name Daenerys said looking at his daughter.

Daenerys looked happily at Jon and said: this is your daughter. Her name is Lyanna Targaryen

Jons legs gave out and he fell on his knees in front of his daughter. Ghost approached Jon as it saw him falling on his knees.

Jon looked at Lyanna with all the love a man can have for his child, and with all the pain that his heart had carried for seven long years.

How?...Dany, how?... Jons words were barely audible.

Only death can pay for life. My life allowed her to live Daenerys said sweetly as a tear slowly fell down her face.

Jon hugged and kissed his daughter with tears in his eyes and joy in his heart. He held her with more love than he had ever given to anyone, more than Arya, more than Daenerys, more than Ghost. He did not know how long that moment lasted, in that instant he felt immortal. 

At last he let go of Lyanna.

Lyanna thats a beautiful name said Jon smiling at his daughter.

Mother named me after my grandmother. She said she had great beauty and was very brave the girl said with conviction.

She was just like you said Jon approvingly

Ghost got closer to the little girl, who seemed a bit scared of the giant direwolf. Ghost then smelled the patch of black hair and started licking her ear. Lyanna giggled as she started petting the wolfs only ear.

Whats his name? Lyanna asked curiously

His name is Ghost. Ive had him since he was a pup. I think he likes you Jon said. Jon gently grabbed Lyannas wooden dragon and started examining it.

I like your toy dragon, does he have a name? he asked 

He protects the smaller dragons, so I named him Jorax after Mothers bravest Knight said Lyanna as Daenerys smiled at her daughter and Jon.

A sad smile crossed Jons mouth, as he remembered House Mormont. Your mother is right, he was brave, gallant and honorable. What every Knight should be. He saved our lives Jon said.

Jon then pulled some of the dry meat from his leather pouch and offered it to Lyanna so she could feed Ghost.

Lyanna started feeding Ghost and playfully petting the direwolf. Drogon sneered and turned its head away from the little girl and her new friend.

Jon stood once again and saw that Daenerys was beaming at him. The dawn had given way to the sun, the sky was blue and cloudless, and the Wall shined as bright as ever in the horizon. Jon thought this was the most perfect moment of his life. He grabbed Danys face and kissed her. He did not know how long he kissed her.

Mother, father, theyve found us. They did follow us said Lyanna with excitement.

Jons soldier instincts made him turn around quickly looking for an enemy. It was then when Drogon got up from his rest, raised his head to the sky and roared louder than Jon had ever heard or remembered.

Jons hand went for Longclaw as he scanned the surrounding area. Before he could unsheathe his sword, Daenerys hand calmly grabbed him by the wrist. She quietly pointed up, to the morning sky.

Jon raised his head and saw what Lyanna had seen. Approaching the clearing were they stood, Jon saw one more magnificent sight in this most humbling of days.

Dragons.

Epilogue

Jon opened his eyes. 

It was morning; the cold had woken him, the cold and his dreams. He hated dreaming, his dreams were always the same. He dreamt of fire, of ash, of lost love. He felt cold even though the fire was still crackling in his chimney. As he rose slowly from the bed; he felt something moving next to his bed on the cold floor. Ghost. The snowy white giant direwolf opened one of his red eyes and closed it again as he saw Jon moving from the bed to the privy.

Its no use looking at me that way, Tormund is coming soon and ye better help me this time. We cant lose to him again said Jon.

Ever since he had been exiled back North, to the real North, Tormund and him had an annual hunting competition. The hunts champion would be whoever could catch the biggest animal and bring it back to the Free Folk for a feast. The people called it: the Hunt of the Dragonrider and the Giantsbane. Tormund had won every year since Jons exile began seven years ago. This would be the seventh. Two years ago, Jon thought he would win, when Ghost helped him catch the biggest Stag he had ever seen. Tormund caught a grey bear twelve feet tall. Jon lost.

Seven years has it been that long already? Perhaps time should be measured by events and not by years Jon thought He smiled sadly as he remembered moments gone by. He thought of his sisters Sansa and Arya. He thought of Bran, the cripple boy who became King. Mostly he thought of her, he always thought of her. Daenerys.

Jon finished relieving himself, and put on his clothes and wolf-coat. He heard a knock on the door.

That will be the Giantsbane said Jon to Ghost, as he opened the door.

The giant ginger smiled at the sight of a half awoken Jon. 

Are ye ready to lose again little Crow? said Tormund.

This is the seventh year of the hunt. Seven is a lucky number, like the gods. Mayhaps the gods will smile on me this time said Jon.

Youre in the North, the old gods rule here my little Crow. Lets get started Dragonrider, I am already hungry said Tormund smiling at his old friend.

Jon picked up his Valyrian sword, Longclaw, his bow and arrows, a leather pouch with dry meat for him and Ghost to share, and some water.  Jon waited at the door as his direwolf slowly got off the floor and came to him. Once outside Tormund smiled and wished his friend good luck.

I will see you at sunset Dragonrider said Tormund amusedly. 

Same to you Tormund of Tarth said Jon smiling back at his friend

Aaaahhhh good memories said Tormund smiling to himself as he walked away from them.

The village was deserted, everybody still asleep as the sun slowly emerged from its daily slumber. Jon and Ghost started walking west towards the nearby forest. Jon had decided to walk around the edge of the forest, on the north side, to spot any animal tracks before deciding to venture into the forest to chase whatever animal might be there. It was a beautiful day Jon thought. The sky was cloudless. Only the vanishing red light from the rising sun disturbed the blueness of the sky. If he looked south he could see the Wall in the horizon. After all these years, the sight of it still took Jons breath away. There she was: bright, crying as the first rays of dawn hit her glasslike surface in the summer sun. Eternal.

After an hour or so of walking, they reached the edge of the forest.

All right Ghost; lets see what we can find. Use that nose of yours said Jon. The giant direwolf stared at Jon with its big ruby eyes before it started trotting at a slow pace while sniffing the ground in front of him for any animal scents.

Jon was walking briskly behind his direwolf, with his bow and arrow at the ready. The forest to their left looked dark and uninviting, with no signs of animal tracks. They followed the edge of the forest, but ahead of them three hundred yards away, a massive boulder blocked the path. They would either have to go south into the forest or they would have to walk around it on the north side. As they approached the massive rock, Ghost stopped.

What is it Ghost? Did you catch a scent? Jon quietly asked his wolf.

Ghost lowered its massive body, its left ear pointing backwards, the hair on its back bristled as the wolf started walking slowly towards the rock. Jon followed, bow and arrow ready. They slowly followed the circumference of the rock as they moved northwards around it and away from the forest.  

Jon was about twenty yards away from the edge of the boulder; he would be able to peak on the other side. Ghost started snarling its teeth as Jon reached the edge of the boulder with his bow ready.

Ill shoot it and you hold it down. Then Ill come running behind you to end it with Longclaw he whispered to his direwolf.

Jon quickly moved to the other side of the boulder ready to strikeand he froze.

There in front of him, on the other side of the boulder at the edge of the forest resting on the ground was something he hadnt seen in seven years, and something he thought he would never see again in his life.

A Dragon.

The beast rested on the ground, its black scales as dark as night, massive in its length. Its long neck bent over its right wing, as if distracted by something on the other side. From where he stood Jon could only see the Dragons left profile. Its left wing was half raised, while its long tail rested on the ground by the trees.

Jon could not see the dragons face, but he knew who it was. Here at the end of the world, rested the dragon that burnt the Gold Road, the one who brought fire to the Long Night, the dragon that fought its brother in the clouds above Winterfell, the one that had rescued Jon beyond the Wall, the bane of Kings Landing, the one who melted the Iron Throne; and took its dead Mother away in the darkness across the Narrow Sea. The only living dragon left in the world.

Drogon.

Jon stood there watching the magnificent beast, as Ghost remained slightly behind him by the boulder. He lowered his bow and arrow, as he took half a step towards Drogon. His black leather boot was loud in the flat rocky path, and the dragon turned its massive neck around until he found the source of the noise. Jon. 

Drogon stared at Jon, with its mouth and nostrils slightly opened. The dragons head was no more than fifty yards away.

Jon stared back at the dragon silently, unsure of what to do. From the corner of his eye, he thought he saw something moving behind the dragons left wing. He slowly turned his gaze from the dragons eyes to its wing. There, stepping from behind the wing appeared a vision of his past, the reason his heart felt empty and his guilt never-ending. 

Daenerys Targaryen.

Jons bow and arrow made a loud noise on the rock as they fell from his hand. He stood there stony and silent, as the statues of the old Kings of Winter in the crypts of Winterfell. He thought it must be a dream, a cruel one. 

Dany? he muttered silently.

Daenerys smiled softly as she pet Drogons wing and started walking towards Jon. She looked as radiant as ever, as if time had stopped by. Her long silver blonde hair moved freely down to her waist. She had a small braid dangling from her forehead to her neck. Her indigo eyes shone as bright as the ice of the Wall in the morning sun. She wore the same white and grey sheep coat that she used to wear when visiting the North.

She stopped three steps away from Jon, as she stared at him with soft eyes and smiled sadly at him. Jon felt those three steps were a greater chasm than crossing the Narrow Sea. He felt his knees buckle under the weight of his aching heart.

Da..Danyhow? Jon asked sheepishly

The Lord of Light, she said simply. Drogon took me East. The followers of RHllor brought me back, just like you. Now we both have scars in our hearts.

DanyIm sorryI Jon said. He could not say anything else. The words escaped him as they left his mouth. Jons eyes reflected the pain and sorrow in his heart, as the tears started forming and gently streaming down his face.

Daenerys took the final steps between them and stood there looking at his old lovers eyes, as she softly touched his face and wiped the tears away. Jon saw that she was smiling at him as her own tears streamed down her fair cheeks. For the first time in seven years he felt hope, the hope that only love can bring to a mans heart. 

Jon gently grabbed her hands and stared into her eyes, terrified that this moment would disappear and he would only have a vague memory of it. Terrified it would disappear, like a dream that is forgotten when the body is suddenly awoken.

Where have you been all this time? Jon said softly.

Volantis. That is where I was given the kiss of life. I stayed there for some time, and then went back to the Great Grass Sea said Daenerys.

DanyIm sorry said Jon. He wanted to say so much more to her, but the words betrayed him.

I know you are. I had many enemies in my first life, but I did not think I would die at the hands of the noblest man I knew. The man I loved she said with some pain in her voice.

At first, I wanted to come back with Fire and Blood once again. However, having life again changed mewith time, I understood your choice she said.

I should have tried to convince you some other wayI Jon said. 

Daenerys gently squeezed his hands. You were right, and so was Varys. I lost my way on my path to the Iron Throne. I became what I always struggled to keep at bay. I became my fathers daughter Daenerys said regretfully.

Life was given back to me, and I hadother things to mindso I went back to the Dothraki Sea, away from the world she said with a smile on her face.

Even with his eyes full of tears as he stared at Daenerys, Jon caught a slight movement from the corner of his eyes. He saw as Drogons gargantuan head turned around to its right, as something appeared from behind its right wing. It was the most beautiful sight that Jon had ever seen in his life. 

A little girl.

The little girl could not have been older than six years old, Jon thought. She started walking slowly towards Daenerys and Jon. She had fair skin and her eyes were a brighter shade of indigo than Daenerys. She had two silver hair braids on each side of her face down to her neck. Targaryen hair Jon thought. 

As she approached them, he noticed that her hair in the middle was not silver, but black and wavy. His heart started racing, as if it was trying to tell him something about this most beautiful of creatures.

The little girl wore a sheep coat, half black and half red with a grey silver band across the middle. This is what Jon thought Daenerys must have looked like when she was that age, except for the patch of black hair. Jon had no doubt this girl was Daenerys Targaryens daughter. He noticed that she was holding a wooden figurine, a toy of some sort. It was a wooden dragon, painted sky blue except for its dark green tail. She stopped about five yards from them.

Daenerys let go of Jons hands and approached her daughter. She grabbed her hand and brought her closer to Jon, no more than one foot away.

This is your father my love. He was a King, and his name is Aegon Targaryen, the sixth of his name Daenerys said looking at his daughter.

Daenerys looked happily at Jon and said: this is your daughter. Her name is Lyanna Targaryen

Jons legs gave out and he fell on his knees in front of his daughter. Ghost approached Jon as it saw him falling on his knees.

Jon looked at Lyanna with all the love a man can have for his child, and with all the pain that his heart had carried for seven long years.

How?...Dany, how?... Jons words were barely audible.

Only death can pay for life. My life allowed her to live Daenerys said sweetly as a tear slowly fell down her face.

Jon hugged and kissed his daughter with tears in his eyes and joy in his heart. He held her with more love than he had ever given to anyone, more than Arya, more than Daenerys, more than Ghost. He did not know how long that moment lasted, in that instant he felt immortal. 

At last he let go of Lyanna.

Lyanna thats a beautiful name said Jon smiling at his daughter.

Mother named me after my grandmother. She said she had great beauty and was very brave the girl said with conviction.

She was just like you said Jon approvingly

Ghost got closer to the little girl, who seemed a bit scared of the giant direwolf. Ghost then smelled the patch of black hair and started licking her ear. Lyanna giggled as she started petting the wolfs only ear.

Whats his name? Lyanna asked curiously

His name is Ghost. Ive had him since he was a pup. I think he likes you Jon said. Jon gently grabbed Lyannas wooden dragon and started examining it.

I like your toy dragon, does he have a name? he asked 

He protects the smaller dragons, so I named him Jorax after Mothers bravest Knight said Lyanna as Daenerys smiled at her daughter and Jon.

A sad smile crossed Jons mouth, as he remembered House Mormont. Your mother is right, he was brave, gallant and honorable. What every Knight should be. He saved our lives Jon said.

Jon then pulled some of the dry meat from his leather pouch and offered it to Lyanna so she could feed Ghost.

Lyanna started feeding Ghost and playfully petting the direwolf. Drogon sneered and turned its head away from the little girl and her new friend.

Jon stood once again and saw that Daenerys was beaming at him. The dawn had given way to the sun, the sky was blue and cloudless, and the Wall shined as bright as ever in the horizon. Jon thought this was the most perfect moment of his life. He grabbed Danys face and kissed her. He did not know how long he kissed her.

Mother, father, theyve found us. They did follow us said Lyanna with excitement.

Jons soldier instincts made him turn around quickly looking for an enemy. It was then when Drogon got up from his rest, raised his head to the sky and roared louder than Jon had ever heard or remembered.

Jons hand went for Longclaw as he scanned the surrounding area. Before he could unsheathe his sword, Daenerys hand calmly grabbed him by the wrist. She quietly pointed up, to the morning sky.

Jon raised his head and saw what Lyanna had seen. Approaching the clearing were they stood, Jon saw one more magnificent sight in this most humbling of days.

Dragons.

He counted six dragons led by a sky blue one with a dark green tail. They were all of various sizes, all smaller than Drogon. The dragons started landing in the clearing next to Drogon.

They made it mother, theyre here said Lyanna with the innocence and wonder than only a child has.

Daenerys smiled at her daughter and looking at Jon said they are here, just like us. Home

Yes, Brienne is from the stormlands and she was taught she was an ugly thing by her septa (and in the book she looks like a man and isnt just tall and buff) but at the same time her father taught her swordplay as you shouldnt tussle with boys but Ill be sure youre doing it right. Meanwhile, the north is more liberal towards women in combat: in the book all the mormont girls are warriors, with Dacey Mormont being Robb Starks bodyguard. And because the north is cold and unforgiving, many women are ruling over lands, like Lady Hornwood. If Brienne was born in the north, yeah shed be made fun of for looking like a man but be applauded for being a warrior. 

This also goes hand in hand with the books since it deconstructs the tomboy doesnt want to have tea parties and wear makeup trope: yeah it sucked for Arya to be a lady but at the same time she had three square meals and a roof over her head whereas now shes a 9 year old girl losing her sanity, murdering people, and running for her life. She even thinks that if she had to go back to lady lessons she would take it. And as a lady the only things she was good at were math and horseback riding, which she eclipsed Sansa in. 

So sorry about that but my question is:

How would Aryas upbringing changed if Catelyn wasnt a Tully but rather perhaps (Im just randomly giving house names) a Bolton or a Manderly? Would Catelyn have still been a lady, considering we have people like Lady Dustin? Would she have been more accepting of Arya but still taught her a compromise? 

I am curious because in the books, Ned doesnt think Arya liking swords is anything more than a kiddy phase, like karate: you saw a commercial about it and three months later youre bored. Granted, Lyanna was an athletic, beautiful tomboy who loved all kinds of martial prowesses. So would Ned become like Catelyn and try to make Arya something she isnt? Or would he take more of an interest in Sansa who has no interest in doing stupid things like learning how to start a campfire or shoot a bow? 

Would Sansa have been the Arya Horseface in this scenario and hated living in the North a heck of a lot more and not just in a teen sense? After all, how does being good at knitting compare to knocking a boys teeth out? Yeah shes a beauty but still, shes no Arya.

If I had a silver coin for ever time ive heard character arc or development Id have so much silver that the coins would be slipping from from my fingers and rolling onto the floor.

Whatre these fans even on about? some of these assumptions on character development, actions and story seem to reflect some kind of misunderstanding about human behavior. Like for example: the amount of people absolutely floored by Jamies comment that he doesnt care about people. Jamies a complicated character; do people legitimately not understand how hes a bit of both, how he might feel at that moment he doesnt care or how 70/80% of the time theirs a disconnect between what we say and how we really are and feel? Like this idea that he would say he doesnt care but in reality he does, but also part of him doesnt. This contradiction for me, is very human, and realistic and decent writing, but for fans, characters are robots with clear non-contradicting views and that whole scene just doesnt compute?  ive never In my entire life met a person who was reasonable, logical or always said what they meant and felt.  How is this expected at all??  Everyone ive ever gotten to know well has been pretty crazy,  deeply flawed and full of illogical contradiction,  myself included.

There seems to be this general idea of writing as a clear cut arc of improvement and logical progression. That aint good writing at all, some of the greatest pieces of writing, like Anna Karanina and In Search of Lost Time literally reject the idea of characters growing better altogether and they most definitely reject the idea of characters acting logically or reasonably.

Its like a friggin amateur screenwriting workshop over here.",4,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

But by season 6, it feels like the only wildlings left are the regular human looking ones (save for Wun Wun).

One of them reminded me about Khal braids. They put *bells* in their braids and only cut off their braids and their bells when they are defeated. So the ringing bells, to Dany's subconscious, might've signaled victory rather than surrender. Surely a victorious Khal would slaughter the defeated Khal if they refused to cut off their braid and bells? And maybe his entire Khalasar, too, to serve as an example? 

&amp;#x200B;

At least, that's my headcanon from now on. Sure, Tyrion was all about bells meaning surrender, but a tiger doesn't become a kitten when you tell me it's a kitten. Or, y'know, a big hairy spider. My lizard brain doesn't give a fuck and still goes ""Hans, pas der Flammenwerfer.""

&amp;#x200B;

I know what D&amp;D says, and what Dany herself says (""She used their innocence against me,"" ... I might've found myself nodding along. Remove the leverage to take back your agency, and all that. Yeah. I know. Don't worry, I like playing around in the sandbox of my mind and my mind only, not in the real world.) 

&amp;#x200B;

Note that I'm a cynical nihilist who does not subscribe to the theory of free will. I firmly believe in the theory/philosophy that our brains make the decision, and all thoughts that come after are simply conscious justifications to ourselves. The choice is already made. or: ""Many scientists say that the American physiologist Benjamin Libet demonstrated in the 1980s that [we have no free will](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/06/theres-no-such-thing-as-free-will/480750/). It was already known that electrical activity builds up in a persons brain before she, for example, moves her hand; Libet showed that this buildup occurs before the person consciously makes a decision to move. The conscious experience of deciding to act, which we usually associate with free will, appears to be an add-on, a post hoc reconstruction of events that occurs after the brain has already set the act in motion.""

&amp;#x200B;

^(The article cracks me up. ""Smilansky advocates a view he calls illusionismthe belief that free will is indeed an illusion, but one that society must defend. The idea of determinism, and the facts supporting it, must be kept confined within the ivory tower. Only the initiated, behind those walls, should dare to, as he put it to me, look the dark truth in the face. Smilansky says he realizes that there is something drastic, even terrible, about this ideabut if the choice is between the true and the good, then for the sake of society, the true must go,"" they write in) **^(an article I found in three seconds flat)** ^(when Google Searching ""Free will does not exist.""

**Most people wonder why Dany burned everything on site instead of only the Redkeep. And to be fair that's probably the first thought that came to everyone's mind when she looked at the Redkeep with all that hate, most people thought the Redkeep is gone, instead she burned everything.**

**A lot of people see it as a plot hole or that it hasn't been built up to enough but I have to respectfully disagree, and here's why.**

**Dany always felt like Westeros was her home and its people are her people. But she NEVER felt at home in Westeros except for when she first landed on Dragonstone. Every experience she had since landing has not made it easier for her. Those who declared for her didn't agree with her and then fell very quickly. Even after saving Winterfel and the world she felt like she was admired the least, or at least still looked at as a stranger. But worst of all, she lost more trusted and loved advisors and friends in Westeros than she had in her entire life across the narrow sea. And that's both in the past and the present. The scene between Grey Worm and Messandei where they felt like strangers and they will never be treated as one of them, Dany might not have said it exactly - as being loved is different than being seen as a foreigner - but she's been feeling the same way for a while. Starting with Randall Tarly then Sansa Stark and then basically in every gathering that happened in Winterfel.**

**The one person left to her from Westeros was Jon and then the news about his birth tainted it and him refusing to keep it from his family and then the secret getting out ruined it furthermore. But what truly devastated her was his repeated rejection. He was the last thing left to her from all of Westeros especially with Tyrion failing her repeatedly. But even then destroying Kingslanding wasn't as probable to happen if it weren't for Messandei's murder, because to her it was the last straw that filled her heart with hate towards all of Westeros. What happened next only sealed The fate of the Kingslanders even more. With the secret out and Varys betraying her and conspiring to kill her and being told by Tyrion and then Jon rejecting her again and that's a very important point. When she tried sleeping with him again even after telling him that she doesn't feel loved in Westeros, it was as if she was saying I would settle for your love instead of theirs. But he rejected her again, and that I think was as bad to her as losing Messandei. He's the first she truly loved since Drogo and she has never experienced rejection before, which can't be disregarded not only because it's happening to a strong woman and a queen but also because it's piling on the both open and hidden rejection of all of Westeros sealing its fate.**

**Some might say that all of this was too subtle, but you forget that the show always liked a little bit of surprise in big events so it was actually the right amount of subtlety.**

**And for all of that it can be said - or that's at least my humble opinion - that if either G.R.R Martin or David Benioff and D.B. Wiess have opted for a happy ending I imagine the best one was that after a few confrontaions and situations between Dany and varios westerosy Lords followed by conversations with Tyrion, Varys, Grey Worm, Messandie and Jon snow that Dany would've accepted that she belonged with the people she freed and lived more amongst. And after she and Jon conquered Kingslanding together and putting him on the Iron Throne as Agon Targaryen starting a new historic era in which targaryens ruled all the known world on both sides of the Narrow Sea. but for that to be even slightly possible at least one of Jora Mormont or Messandie had to survive.**

**The only things that disappointed me in the final season are three small issues.**

**First: Not seeing an introduction from Jon between Dany and Ghost. I know it might seem like nothing but it was something I was actually waiting for and I don't think I was alone in this. How he would react to her? would his treatment to her give him a small clue that she's related to him? how he fares when getting close to the dragon? I get they wanted the focus in graphics on more significant events but the way I see it is when you are finishing something that big and postponed for more than a year in airing then you should go all out in everything big or small.**

**Second: we should've seen at least two or three scenes between Dany and Arya other than nothing at all. I know they are two characters that had nothing connecting them throughout the show or the series, but any conversation between those two would've been something to witness, especially if one of those was a daring confrontation after the burning of Kingslanding.**

**Third: ( and a lot more disappointing ) Dany's death scene. It was handled a little poorly. The conversation was short, Jon should have argued more that that. And I don't know why but Dany not saying anything before dying didn't sit well with me.

I been digging her ever since she came to Winterfell in Season 5 and shes just been getting better each season. I was on the Sansa hate-train for a long time like everyone else but shes been getting smarter over the years from all of her terrible experiences. And now shes progressed up to the point where shes tough enough to pressure Dany about the North; but shes also forgiving enough to accept Theon back at Winterfell. And shes smart enough to listen to Briennes council about Jaime. Sophie Turner has done a great job playing Sansa and shes one of those characters that really grew into their role. I really hope she survives next episode!!

However, I fear that if they do not take proactive measures, there is no way any even-slightly-provocative questions will be answered or even asked.

This is D&amp;D were talking about. These guys do not handle critisicim well and you can be sure they will do all they can to avoid it. As far as I know they havent done a single interview since they started getting shit for Season 8. When the Jaimie-Cersei rape controversy came about they refused to aknowledge the uproar until they were surprised a year later at a Q&amp;A by a female fan, and forced to give a cringeworthy awkward response that completely contradicted what others had said about the scene (they acted like they made it a rape on purpose, when the director and actors have made it clear it was an editing/filming error and the scene was supposed to be portrayed as consensual).

These guys are going to screen questions. I dont know how Comic Con works. I dont know if theyve done it in the past. But they will do it this year. Trust me. So if you get screened before you ask your question, make sure you have a fake overly positive question that appeals to their ego ready to go so theyre more likely to pick you, and then when they do, give em the real thing.",30,2,False,self,,,,,

She never really turned as much as she grew into it. It's who she was. And by season 2, she had evolved to be a person capable of genocide, exemplified by her consideration of doing it, which no sane or truly moral person would ever threaten, let alone consider.

&amp;#x200B;

From that point, she continually battled between doing good things and terrible things in Slavers Bay, Asatapor,  Yunkai and Meereen, also including the Dothraki capital. We just didn't pay much attention to the terrible things because:

A) They were terrible and cruel things done to terrible and cruel people. Who cares, right? The Dexter phenomenon.

B) They were done to red shirts, or characters we cared nothing about, had little to no attachment to or were antagonists or barriers in the way of Dany's goals. We all wanted to see her go to Westeros and take the throne. 

C) We liked Dany, faults and all. We wanted her to succeed. We paid little attention to the terrible things she was doing because of our bias for her and instead often cheered as she smiled while roasting people alive and demanding to hear their suffering and deathly screams and so on ... Hmmm, I think that says a lot about our own morality too, quite frankly.

And I think it's no coincidence that the people who generally did not like Dany, or at least not very much, seemed to have been far more accepting  of her actions in Season 8 Episode 5. Some of these people had even been calling her arc for many years in advance.

&amp;#x200B;

It's only when she comes to Westeros and begins interacting with characters and people we do care about that we start to really question her sanity and specifically by this I mean the general audience at large. 

Then consider that by this time, it's season 7, the show is literally almost over, thus giving the surface impression of a rapid arc that was not developed properly. In actuality, it had been building since season 1, but primarily season 2. 

It's really only on revisiting the series or on reflection of Dany's entire arc that we can begin to appreciate how fleshed out of a hero and villain she really is from the very beginning and as a consequence, begin to have a lot more appreciation for Season 8 Episode 5 and at least the first half of Season 8 Episode 6.",54,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

I know some things in the TV show are different from the books, so I initially wanted to read them starting from the first one. But, at about 1/3 of *A Game of Thrones* I found myself a bit bored since the story lines are essentially the same with just minor differences (I do appreciate the added plot and character details, but Id like to focus more on major differences).

So thats why Im asking which book starts to have significant differences from the show that I should start reading from. (If you cant pinpoint one exact book, Im also willing to read only chapters of a couple characters from the first books if you think its essential to understand those characters.)",8,0,False,self,,,,,

From my perspective, Im having a hard time seeing how Dany got from a place of mercy and being the breaker of chains to becoming delusional about the truth of who she had become. It just seemed like such a far jump from the depth and sincerity she had to the blinded-by-power tyrant she had become. 

Although I like the idea of Bran becoming an elected King, and the North remaining free, what about Jon? He is the only one who always did what was right, much like Ned Stark, yet GOT continues to send the message that doing whats right only leads to punishment. 

I also dont see how the Unsullied became blind killers as well  especially of innocent women and children. Someone else, loyal to Dany, and other than Jon, could have stood up to her and tried to show her that what she was doing was wrong.  Remind her of things she had said I the past, and of what her father had done.

Anyway, I guess I may be alone here, but its just not sitting right with me  especially Jon.",72,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

But I know a lot of the artwork that people make and then post on here say no spoilers but its artwork of characters, either two or more characters together or just a certain character that someone drew. Most of the post that say no spoilers that actually have spoilers (that I can think of right now) are the artwork post. A lot them arent spoilers but only for people that have seen most/all of the show. Theres so many that show things/ people that happen later on in the show and would spoil things for people that are just now starting out the show. I mean when I started watching it, around season 3-4 I found out about this sub and started looking at it occasionally. And I started watching the show about 2 weeks before the 8th season started. I caught up to the actual show super fast. I started watching the live episodes on episode 3, so if I started 2 weeks before (which was actually closer to a week before), but my point is that when I started looking at this sub there were a lot of post that said no spoilers they arent hidden/ blurred out like the ones that say spoilers, that actually spoiled things for me. Its like the rule was you only had to put spoilers if it was a major spoiler or if it was obviously a spoiler. Many of them spoiled things for me, like I said before a lot of the artwork were the main things that spoiled things for me. I saw some guy the other day post that he was just starting the series and it made me think about how it he were to look through the sub, theres a high chance that things would get spoiled even if he didnt look at any of the [SPOILERS] post, like I did. I did end up looking at some of them just from my own curiosity but if they spoiled something for me, I was okay with it because I knew I was doing it to myself but the ones that said no spoilers and then ended up having a spoiler were the ones that really upset me. Basically if your post says/shows anything that happens in the show it should say [SPOILERS], because a lot of what people doing consider spoilers are spoilers. Does anyone else agree with what I mean? 

TDRL; a lot of the post (mostly artwork) that have the [NO SPOILERS] brackets should have the [SPOILERS] brackets because they end up containing info/pictures of things that happen in the show. A lot of them are things that I guess some people dont consider spoilers but actually do spoil somethings even if they are small they still spoil some of the story.

I want to talk about Drogon and his role up until then. He went from beloved child, very quickly to protector, and vanquisher of evil doers..and then he burned a child to death in Season 4 Episode 10's The Children..and subsequently disappeared (appearing briefly over the ruins of Valyria, mid-season, to a wide eyed Tyrion, and brokenhearted Jorah) until Season 5 Episode 9's appropriately named Dance of Dragons. There we see our future Mad Queen mount our favorite dragon, for the first time. 

Why did he disappear? He was gone before Rhaegal and Viserion were chained in the tombs beneath Mereen, so that wasn't a factor. I have an explanation..guilt. He felt bad. He knew what he had done was wrong. Think about it. He had only killed murderers, tormentors, in defense of his mother. He had never harmed a child. 

Now..fast forward to the events of The Bells..what was asked of him. If this dragon was capable of enough guilt at killing one little girl..imagine the torment at citywide annihilation. I believe that was first conveyed at his initial sighting of Jon coming to the ruins of the Red Keep. Drogon had always conveyed dominance towards Jon. Not this time. That is also why I believe that he allowed Jon to live, following the death of his mother. He knew the act was justified.

I want to talk about Drogon and his role up until then. He went from beloved child, very quickly to protector, and vanquisher of evil doers..and then he burned a child to death in Season 4 Episode 10's The Children..and subsequently disappeared (appearing briefly over the ruins of Valyria, mid-season, to a wide eyed Tyrion, and brokenhearted Jorah) until Season 5 Episode 9's appropriately named Dance of Dragons. There we see our future Mad Queen mount our favorite dragon, for the first time. 

Why did he disappear? He was gone before Rhaegal and Viserion were chained in the tombs beneath Mereen, so that wasn't a factor. I have an explanation..guilt. He felt bad. He knew what he had done was wrong. Think about it. He had only killed murderers, tormentors, in defense of his mother. He had never harmed a child. 

Now..fast forward to the events of The Bells..what was asked of him. If this dragon was capable of enough guilt at killing one little girl..imagine the torment at citywide annihilation. I believe that was first conveyed at his initial sighting of Jon coming to the ruins of the Red Keep. Drogon had always conveyed dominance towards Jon. Not this time. That is also why I believe that he allowed Jon to live, following the death of his mother. He knew the act was justified. The Iron Throne truly was what killed her..and her child knew that better than anyone.

TL;DR Drogon felt guilty about burning KL, and, while devastated at the loss, allowed Jon to kill Daenarys, because he knew she had it coming.",12,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

Ramsay then let his men send letters to the other houses that Roose was poisoned by his enemies. After Ramsay was killed in the BotB I think no person that is still alive knows that in fact he wasn't poisoned  but killed by his own son. I then thought that there have to be other very important cases where we as the viewers know what happened but that are forgotten in the show world because there is no one still alive who was there which makes it quite interesting or sad, depends on the case. The one thing that came to my mind was Joffrey being poisoned by Olenna Tyrell. There were probably some people within House Tyrell who know but it got erased in S7 and the only one Olenna told it was Jamie (who then told it Cersei) but they aren't alive anymore. I don't think the Lannisters would spread this because Cersei wanted everyone to believe that Tyrion killed him. Also, you could add Cleganebowl as Arya probably knew it was gonna happen but doesn't know how it ended.
