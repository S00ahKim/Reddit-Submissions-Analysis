What Material Is Valerian Steel Made Out Of?

Im in season 5 right now on Game Of Thrones when this question came to mind during a particular episode. Now Ive never read the books so I dont know if theres an answer to this question? And someone told me it isnt truly known...

My thought process behind it is that Valerian Steel has some type of material in it with a very high specific heat. So since a white walker can shatter most objects instantly because they are probably so cold, if something had a high specific heat, then it would be able to absorb the temperature, and resist chattering. (And for Physics people, I understand theres no cold, just a transfer of heat) but would that be why his sword doesnt shatter?

And then maybe Dragons Glass still has magma on the inside of the obsidian, and it will never cool down. So like an extreme hot and extreme cold side where nothing happens to the insulator, so the obsidian doesnt shard...

So is the answer simply a high specific heat material?

_______________________________________________
And please just be nice in the comments, I dont need anyone telling me my theory is stupid, you can give me your theories and Im glad to listen to why you think mine is false, but please dont cause a scene...

The Rebels marched on proud

To hunt the Mighty Dragons.

The Snakes in the Sands rattled,

The Lions could only hide,

The Young Wolf howled viciously,

For a father and son had died.

And in a tower of sinful bliss,

The Queen of Blue Roses

held the Dragon captive,

With her youthful, fiery kiss.

Finally, The Crown Prince emerged,

But the Trident turned a bloody red,

When the Demon's hammer fell,

And, Alas, the Last Dragon was dead.

The Mighty Dragon had fallen,

The War over, The Rebels had won,

The Stag held the Dragon's crown,

And the Wolf held the Dragon's son.*

Can they resurrect their slain soldiers? Or once you are reanimated and killed are you done? Because if they are done than in actuality every soldier just needs to kill enough to offset his eventual turning; so if the WW army is around 150k (just to put a number out there) then the 80k live men would have to kill around 2 or 3 wights apiece to neutralize the original army. If around half of the living army was killed then that number rises to around 5 or 6.

We haven't seen actual strategy from the WW yet, right? They usually just rely on their ice weapons and horde-like forces to overwhelm their enemies. The smaller their army grows, the less able they are to do this. So I really I don't think it is all that crazy to think that an army of 80k could hold off the wights. We've seen how effective strategy can be during TWOTFK at Whispering Wood and Riverrun, so I don't think we just throw out that aspect of war.

Of course there is still that small issue of the WW themselves, and the recently revived Viseryon, but with heroes like Jon, Arya, Jaime, and Bronn, coupled with the aid of two dragons on the living side, I don't think the living are actually overwhelmingly underdogs.

This argument is only valid if the WW can't revive their slain wights, so this might just be a null point. I just thought I'd voice my thoughts.",14,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

Drogo is a khal or warlord of the Dothraki, the famed nomadic horse-lords of the eastern continent beyond the Narrow Sea,and he married denaerys then he got wounded. We remember all of us that denaerys brought a witch whoose name is ""Mirri Maz Duur"" To revive Khal Drogo so after he was alive but stills unconscious we remember when denaerys asked the witch when will he be conscious and wake up the witcher said ""When the sun rises in the west, sets in the east, when the seas go dry and the mountains blow in the wind like leaves"" To explain this and what did the witch mean with saying this, When the sun rises in the west, sets in the east, as we remember the dothraki couldn't leave esos at all, now they have reached it (travalled from the east to the west"" that's the meaning of that quote but the second part I think that the dragon who got possessed by the white walkers is about to do that thing (drying the seas etc..) so I think that khal drogo is coming back at season 8.

Across five books and seven seasons, Jon's been built up as a shining example of the ""Heroic Bastard"" archetype. So to suddenly reveal he isn't a bastard after all undoes much of his identity and character development. He gradually came to accept his status as a bastard and dedicated himself to showing Westeros - a society with a strong stigma against bastards - that bastards can be good and honorable people. Removing his bastard status feels and contrived and even somewhat insulting against real-life people who are born out of wedlock and looked down on for it. ",13,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Plus there are more important things to focus on right now. If they both somehow survive, and there's an epilogue, Id like to see them together though.

It would be so much more interesting if everyone did end up being involved in the Great War in some way (Cersei included even though it's not by choice). I feel like people are only focused on the idea (the characters as well) that the North will be their primary target before moving on to other locations in Westeros. 

I think the Night King will only send enough wights to take on the forces that are gathering together at Winterfell to distract them, while he himself along with Viserion and the rest of his soldiers will head to a location that has a very big population (King's Landing). I guess I'm just eager to see elephants as wights since Cersei is having Euron bring the Golden Company to the city, but coincidentally she's only brought the Night King more soldiers for his army.

All this just seems more interesting to me, then Cersei being the 'final' boss. It just makes it feel as if this 7 season build up of the WW threat would be wasted if they were already dealt with in the first half of the last season rather than being a dangerous conflict for all the living characters in the entire season.",15,18,False,spoiler,,,,,

When the seas go dry and the mountains blow in the wind like leaves. When your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child. Then he will return, and not before. This is the prophecy of Mirri Maz Duur and what has lead me to believe that Khal Drogo could return in the final season. Now before I begin the show has past the books and I will be mainly using evidence from the show so this will be a show only discussion.

Okay so first when the sun rises in the west and sets in the east I think actually means the SON sets in the west and rises in the east. Sun=Son the Son is Jon Snow, When the seas go dry could refer to Euron and the Ironborn, And the Mountains blow in the wind like leaves could refer to the mountain beyond the wall or the eastwatch falling (which can also refer to the seas going dry) or maybe something later in the Story like Cleganebowl (Get Hyped). Baring a living child refers to Dany most likely being pregnant with Jon's child which would finally lead to Khal Drogo's return.

Now this is where things get interesting because I think when Khal Drogo returns (which I can imagine being him stepping out of a hearthfire in Dragonstone or maybe stepping out of a Pyre similar to how his body left the world) I don't think it will all be happy and stuff. I believe if he does return he will be pissed that Dany had hooked up with Jon and had a child with him and will probably become a villain. Perhaps try to kill Jon and Dany due to Dany ""Betraying him"" for Hooking up with Jon maybe he will side with Cersei and will marry Cersei (let's hope if that is the case she can calm him just as Dany did).

Or maybe he will be Azor Ahai even though I don't believe that. But personally this is just a tinfoil theory I have and I don't think it will actually happen but it is fun to theorize.",18,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

I get the fact that she still believes her truce with Cersei is still going on, and also that she has seen the possibility Night Kings army, or maybe even her love for Jon. But those still dont seem like enough of motivation for her.

So I kinda just want to know what happened before season 1 other than Robert's Rebellion. I have watched a few of the actor narrated animated videos but i'm not a big fan of those. So if you want, you can answer all of them or just one. Thanks.

-What was before Aegon's Conquest in Westeros? (Government, people, houses etc) 

-Stuff about the fighting between The First Men, The Children of The Forrest, and The Andals. What came first, why were they fighting, how was it resolved or was it even really resolved?

-What was Valyria all about and why is it the way it is? 

-When did magic disappear in Westeros. Meaning when did all the dragons, giants, children of the Forrest, and other magical being die off or disappear in mainland Westeros. (Up north is kinda different since nobody really travels up there and makes it back down living) 

-What was the main religions in Westeros prior to Aegon and during the Targaryen dynasty?

-Did previous religions have things like faith militants or armies? 

-Wildling wars with the Nights Watch. I think Jon told Ygritte there have been like 7 or 9. When did they happen and to what scale. (Like the season 4 war was maybe 100 Nights Watch against 100,000 Wildlings)

-Geographical Things like how the Children formed the Neck and other areas.

-Why/How/When were White Walkers created? (Do we even know?) Also how big was their army against Azor Ahai a couple thousand years ago during the long night?

-How was the Nights Watch formed? 

-How was the Wall created?

-How is Essos governed, or is it even governed at all?

Well for one I think there will be a big battle between Jon and Dany's forces and the NK's forces before they can reach KL but it will be brutal and I think it will result in the deaths of Bronn, Ghost (Sacrificing himself to save Jon), Tormund (if he lives to this point), Grey Worm and most of the Unsullied, Yohn Royce, and most of the Northern lords. I also think both sides will have heavy casualties and Jon and Dany forces will fall back.

I also think back at WF anyone who can't fight will be evacuated too one of two places The Vale and the Riverlands. Sansa, Sam, Gilly, Missendei, Meera (if she is even in S8 and those rumors are not true), Brienne (to protect Sansa), Pod, Lyanna Mormont, and Bran stay at WF helping evacuate or (in Bran's case) warging into one of Dany Dragons. However I think the WW's will reach WF but Jaime, Beric, Arya, and Gendry will make it back there too get them out but Brienne will stay to hold off the last Wagon (which contains all the characters I just mentioned or maybe Tyrion comes in on Rhaegal to get them out) and Brienne will hold off the WW's and Wights breaking down the gates as they escape on the Wagon to the Riverlands.

It is also possible one of the Stark girls could stay but I think all three starks will live.",5,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

-The witch she visited said she'd only have three children (Joffrey, Tommen, Myrcella), so I feel it is likely she dies, or is humanized (A LITTLE BIT, SOMEHOW) and her child dies.

2: Jon Snow is not the heir to the iron throne

-Rheagar died before Jon was born, so the the heir would become Vicerys, and then Dany after he died.

3: Tyrion could definitely be the reborn ""Azor Ahai"" 

-based on the fact that he (as did Azor Ahai) already killed his lover Shae, and ""awakened the dragons"" when he approached and touched them in their chains, after this they were magically tamed.

4: If instead Jamie were the reborn prince (likely, since it is very realistic he could kill Cersei)

-the"" awakening dragons from stone"" doesn't entirely fit, but I read an *unconfirmed* post claiming there is a painting or drawing of Azor Ahai with his sword in his left hand while all the others in the depiction were right-handed (someone please find this to confirm).",14,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Hey!

I just rescued a 10 year old Russian Blue and the shelter didn't have a name for him. He's kind of timid and only likes certain people, but once he warms up to you he's a real lover. He also loves to hide in secluded, small, dark places. I was thinking of naming him after one of the Targaryens, but I'm not sure.

Anyone have any suggestions?

Should I tell you what the voice said? Should I tell you the name of the one who spoke?""* - Kinvara to Varys, S6 E5 

Heading into the final six episodes where presumably most foreshadowing has already been laid out in the previous 77, is it possible that this conversation holds a deeper importance to Varys' role in the Great War? I know, it's a stretch but seriously, what did that voice say and why was it worth mentioning? Just to freak Varys out a bit? Kinvara does mention 'there's still so much' Varys doesn't know - and it seems Melisandre is in the loop as well. 

*""I have to die in this strange country, just like you.""* - Melisandre to Varys, S7 E3

My guess is Varys' death will be important to the plot, maybe somehow linked to the Lord of Light as a payoff to that repeatedly mentioned story of how he was cut. A lot of secondary characters are going to die next season but the writers decided to explicitly foreshadow Varys' out of all others.  *tinfoil hat off*

This possibility banished later on, but I still think it would've been a great reveal. In the show, Cersei states she and Robert did have a son, who died. Not Jaime's but actually Robert's. He either died before birth or soon after. I think this whole thing is never mentioned in the books (not that I remember).

Fans theorized maybe Varys took him away and faked his death, to have a heir to the throne in his pocket just in case he ever needed one. Or maybe Cersei tried getting rid of him as he reminded her of Robert and she didn't want him, maybe she only wanted to have kids with Jaime (she's always felt quite proud about those kids being her brother's).

Imagine this: if this had turned out to be true, and Gendry and Cersei had eventually been told about the truth, everything would change. Cersei would have a non-bastard son to take care of and even love if she wanted to. Stannis would no longer have a claim on the throne, as Robert's real son sat on it. He would probably even serve Gendry; after all, he'd be a Baratheon and the Heir to the Iron Throne. I think Stannis would be satisfied with seeing a true Baratheon wearing the crown.

And this is the biggest deal: Jon Snow and Gendry would probably become enemies. When Jon finds out he's Rhaegar's son he COULD claim the throne, although I don't think he would. Jon does, however, support Daenerys, who people think is the heir after her family's death, which would technically make Jon and Daenerys rivals to Gendry. Gendry's father overthrew the Targaryens and now our main characters are supporting a Targaryen who claims the throne on the basis that she's a Targaryen. And Cersei would be on Gendry's side here. And Stannis.

I would have LOVED to see Gendry, Cersei and Stannis against Daenerys, Jon and the rest. The conflict would be much more heartbreaking, and even would make more sense.",17,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

Brings me to my next question isn't valerian steel able to kill them as well? I remember john taking one out with his longclaw, why didn't he tell the lannisters during their finale meeting that val steel  can kill them? He demonstrated dragonglass and fire but not that steel. 

So if someone could explain, can anything kill the undead but only those 3 things can kill white walkers?  And one more thing, how many white walkers are there?

The board consists of hexes which show where the resource came from (ex: wool comes from a field of sheep, lumber comes from forest, etc.) so for my game I was thinking the hexes could be different locations in the show, such as Braavos for gold, and Dorne for wine, etc. but those are the only two good ""resources"" I have come up with so far that have a particular location tied to them. I also wanted to incorporate ravens and horses as possible resources but I don't know what the hexes would be for those. CAN ANYONE THINK OF ANY OTHER RESOURCES I COULD USE FROM THE SHOW I'D LOVE YOU FOREVER. My other idea would be to make the hexes different houses (Lannister, Stark, etc) but then I also run into trouble of thinking of specific resources... THANK YOU FOR ANY HELP : D",7,6,False,self,,,,,

I'm posting this again because someone had let me know the original link was broken told me I should repost.

I just wanted to thank you all! A while ago I had posted a picture of a shirt I made to wear to a finale party. It blew up, you guys loved it and asked me to buy a whole bunch!

With the money from the shirts you bought I was able to buy some of my own equipment and put together the start to a small side business. 

This is the shirt, [White Walker Track](https://www.instagram.com/p/BYURObeDOiQ/)

SO, now that I'm trying to put together a small business, I'm looking for real content for instagram etc of people in shirts I've made.

I was hoping some of you may want to send pictures showing off your shirts that I could post. I would tag you and give you a 50% off coupon for a future shirt purchase if you see anything you like. I'm hoping to make some more Game of Thrones ones and try to put out a shirt per episode for the last season.

THANK YOU AGAIN!!

The common theory is that it's dany, Jon, and Tyrion or Jamie or Arya or whoever the fuck else making up the third head.... 

But hold on a minute. 

None of those people are dragon riders. 

**Dany rides the dragon named for the man she loved.** 

**Jon will likely ride the dragon named for the brother she admired.**

**And The Night King rides the dragon named for the brother who betrayed her.**

The three heads of the dragon are Jon, Dany, and the Night King. 

What this could mean is that the Night King, in his human life, may have been a distant relation to the Targaryens, or was perhaps a Targaryen himself. 

Dragonriding is a thing that historically only Targaryens could do. That cannot be a coincidence then - the guy who is the Night King just happens to know how to ride a dragon? Just because he can control it doesn't mean he can ride it. That shit ain't easy. 

So that's my theory. ",29,25,False,spoiler,,,,,

_______________________________________________________________


*Jaime walks through the gardens with the baby in his arms, who silently wakes as they approach a wall facing the sea.*

Did you have a nice dream? You must dream of wonderful days beautiful moments so do I. I often dream of you. Yes, I see you every day, hold you in my arms and yet  maybe its because you remind me that what I dreamed of before is behind gone, and it feels like years have passed. It feels like that more and more.

One day Ill have to tell you many stories. Where the scar on your uncles face came from, where to my hand went, about Brienne about your mother. I dont know if I want to talk about your siblings much. I dont want you to be just a little as sad as I am whenever I think of them. Maybe some stories about people being brave, or strong, of great adventures and battles and how thankfull I am that no one has come here yet to ask me to endure all these things again.

So many people fought for so many things even for that our family can live here once again, and in peace. Maybe youll have to fight as well when youre older, probably many times  life doesnt know that one needs rest, thats what I learned. But when it comes to that remember not to let them convince you what is worth fighting for. You got to convince yourself.

*Jaime stands by the wall and stares out at the sea. Brienne walks over from another part of the gardens and stands beside him. She smiles and puts a hand on his shoulder. He takes it and kisses it gently. They smile and stand in silence.*",10,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

It's agonizingly slow at times, but Season 6 and particularly 7 accelerated that pace to the point that its created some missteps.  My biggest complaint is after 6 Seasons of watching Daenerys Targaryen build her army,  Season 7 should have been her time to shine.   My biggest complaint is that her storyline converged with Jon Snows and they forced a romance between the two.   She should have taken the Iron Throne from Cercei *AND THEN* united with Jon Snow and fought off the army of the dead in Season 8 with him.   The romance is fan servicey but doesn't work.  Jon's characterization is not a guy who knocks on the door wanting sex, and she is not the type to fall in love.   The end game should have been the two of them *finally* crossing paths and becoming good friends/allies, but they put all of their eggs into one basket with Season 7 and are rushing to the finish line now.

Ive heard that the show doesnt follow the book perfectly, but has the same general direction. Each time a finish a book Ive watched the shows season recap, and so far have enjoyed it, and have avoided spoilers. 

Can someone please layout where the books and show meet chronologically?

For example... (this may be wrong, just giving an example of what Im looking for)

Season 1 covers all of book 1
Season 2 covers all book 2, and some of book 3

Why this is significant to Jon and Daenerys relationship
Randyll and Dickon Tarly are the father and brother of Jons best friend Samwell Tarly. In season 6 episode 6 we see Sam interact with abusive, berating Randyll Tarly which some might argue that it would not effect Jon and Danys relationship because Sam must be ok with his father being burned alive because he was abusive towards him and will just give Daenerys a pass for burning him for not bending the knee which is simply not logical, as it was his father and his sibling. Jon has always been protective of Samwell since his joining in the nights watch and would be horrified by the pain that Daenerys has caused him over the loss of his family members, as Jon has known Samwell for years and Daenerys only days.

I haven't heard anyone talk about this fact and would like to hear other opinions on it because it seems like it would significantly effect their relationship as a whole in a bad way. Looking to hear others opinions on it.",54,7,False,spoiler,,,,,

For this theory to work 2 unconfirmed things would have to be true:
1) Varys is a blackfyre supporter
2) He knew abour R+L=J

My theory is that Varys hid jaqen h'ghar in the black cells to get him to the wall, and have him assasinate Jon Snow

Varys support Dany and her brother to get a second mad king on the show and than have the realm be rescued by Aegon (who I think is a Blackfyre in some way).
A plan which would probably fail if the true heir would still be alive (namely Jon Snow).

The only other people who knew about Jons parents are Ned Stark and Howland Reed. Varys certainly knew about Cerceis and Jaimes relationship and that non of the kids was from Robert.

When Jon Arry died and Robert chose Ned as his new Hand Jon started to get dangerous. Varys mentioned not meeting many truly honourable man to Ned, so I think it to be likely that Vary was afraid of Ned. Afraid that he would reveal the true heir to the Iron Throne. Knowing that Jon became a member of the NS and knowing that Ned would certainly allow men to join the NS Varys placed jaqen h'ghar in the black cells.

But PotatoSenp4i why would Jon than still be alive?
Well after Neds death there was no real danger coming from Jon anymore. Nobody knew who his parents were so why kill him?

Anyway that would be my theory. I would be happy if you guys shared your thoughts :)",17,15,False,spoiler,,,,,

The Wall is destroyed, and the army of dead marches toward the Westeros. My version of the season 7 ends same, while differing how the story reached its conclusion.

I think earlier episodes of Season 7 were great and the season peaked at the spectacular Episode 4, so differences are mainly on Episode 5-7.

- **Make it 10 episodes instead of 7.**

My fix requires 10 episodes. You will know why.

- **Jon should be questioned.**

It's a little fix but I think in Episode 1, the northern bannermen need to at least question him with *""oh, wait. Didn't you basically desert the fucking Night's Watch?""*

It's okay for them to ended up selecting Jon as the King of the North, but there must be more disagreements and conflicts surrounding it, so when Jon leaves the North, it creates more unsettling tension whether they will overthrow him or not.

Now, onto the bigger fixes.

- **Euron Greyjoy's attack on the Yara's navy**

I thought the series portrayed Euron as just Ramsay clone instead of showing his capability as a tactician and a stragedist of navy. I would like to emphasize those sides with some small changes.

Euron sends a few attack ships to Yara, attacking her Iron Fleet. Yara, due to her inexperience as a navy commander, makes a mistake by engaging them. Iron Fleet chases after the ships. However, Euron IS *experienced.* He planned and led the Lannisport attack during Greyjoy's Rebellion which was Westeros equivalent of the Pearl Harbor attack.

Yara chases the ships without knowing they were going into the deep strait with full of heavy currents which made her ships uncontrollable. It was a dark night, so Yara was unaware of the environment. And she was just on her mission of sailing to the Dorne. Euron was fully aware of geography and carefully planned the attack.

This is the real navy battle tactic exercised by Yi-Soon Shin in the Battle of Myeongnyang, luring and trapping the enemy vassals into the strait and bombarding them from far away, and Euron does exactly that (with catapults obviously instead of cannons) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTan6eDphCk

Yara and Sand Snakes abandon their burning ships and escape with the small boats, but Euron's giant galley Silence approaches and crushes their tiny boats.

On the Yara's small boats, the close combat breaks out. Now, HERE, you can show that *mad man Euron scene* (although him wearing proper armor and holding a shield would be appreciated) https://www.dailydot.com/wp-content/uploads/2fa/a6/47a50180251fe35f.gif

The rest is same as the show. Most Sand Snakes are dead, Euron captures Yara alive, and Reek jumps into water.

I think is much better than just *""the battle happens and all of Iron Fleet is destroyed""* The most important thing is that the show should devote *one ENTIRE episode depicting this battle*, not just plucking it at the end of Episode 2.

As a consequence of losing Yara and Sand Snakes, both Dorne and Iron Islands cut the affiliation with Daenerys. This becomes important later.

- **Sands should not die.**

When I watched the scene where Cersei poisons Tyene, I thought it was weird and unfitting to Cersei's character that she would just 'kill' them. I mean yes, Ellaria watching her daughter dying is a bit sad but in comparison to what she did to the ""Shame"" nun, it was too clean.

In my version, they don't die. However, instead of poisoned to death, Tyene meets the same fate as the nun: *The Mountain beating and raping her in front of Ellaria's eyes.* Everyday. They are fed with small amount of food and water, involving feces and urine. This continues for months.

Sickening, yes, but that's what Cersei would actually do. Just killing the women who killed her daughter easily is not Cersei.

- **'Let's capture a wight and show it to Cersei to convince her to join us!' NO.**

Ditch that whole garbage plot. That's dumb. The most stupidest thing Game of Thrones has done, even more so than the whole goddamn Dorne plot of Season 5. Bronn should not miraculously save Jamie. 

First, Jamie would have drowned. He was fully wearing with heavy steel gears and armors. Second, Game of Thrones is about consequences. It was a huge cop out to end the cliffhanger with *""oh, Bronn saved him. Everything is fine, guys.""*

Third, even if Bronn pulled him out, how the hell Dorakis not immediately got them? Tyrion saw him, Daenerys saw him *CHARGING her full speed*, and falling into water. Even if Dany did not recognize him as Jamie, the fact that him nearly killing her alone would have enough to make her say *""hey, get that fucker.""*

My solution is the logical one: make Dorakis capture Jamie and Bronn after the Loot Train attack of Episode 4. In the beginning of Episode 5, as soon as Bronn pulling Jamie from the water, Dorakis surround them. 

Tyrion reunites his brother tied and caged. You can do that brother and brother dialogue scene without that ridiculous setting of Tyrion infiltrating the heavily fortified castle and meeting Jamie alone. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLBXlix1e64

At first, Dorakis tried to execute Bronn because he is worthless, but Tyrion orders them to stop. Tyrion advises Daenerys to use him as a negotiation card against Cersei. Trading Jamie with Sands and Yara, so they can restore Targaryen-Greyjoy(Iron Islands)-Martell(Dorne) alliance again. 

In this process, Tyrion becomes important again! Acting as a diplomat, playing a political tug of war and re-bridging three factions. Tyrion and Cersei both agree to make a truce because Tyrion needs to rebuild the alliance, and Cersei needs to rebuild her army she lost in the Loot Train attack and carefully rethink her strategy with Jamie.

They exchange hostages. Jamie returned safely, but Tyene's and Ellaria's conditions are less than spectacular. Tyene lost her visions (The Mountain gauged her eyes out if want something gory), and is unable to walk again. Ellaria lost her mind, and suffers aphasia due to the extreme case of post-traumatic stress disorder.

Now, you will probably wonder, *how does Jon go to the North then?*

- **Siege of the Wall**

The Night's King's army of dead finally reaches the Wall. Tens of thousands of White Walkers surround Night's Watch, readying for the attack. 

Bran in Winterfell, sees this from the vision and informs Sansa to send a message to Jon which makes him beg Dany to go with him to the north. Dany rejects, because she doesn't believe White Walkers at this point. Jon leaves Dragonstone with Reek, Gendry and other characters. Dany ignores them at first like a true Tsundere she is, but feels guilty for not helping them.

Jon arrives Eastwatch and gathers Brotherhood Without Banners, Beric Dondarrion, Hound, Tormund for the battle. They agree to help Jon because they know if the Wall falls, the Westeros falls, so their motivation makes more sense this time.

The grand siege battle that decorates the finale of this season starts. The entire North vs White Walkers. Sansa, Arya, Bran, Jon, everyone is here. Littlefinger plays a politic game. They all play their own set roles in the battle.

I haven't fully figured out how should they attack the Wall, whether climbing up the Wall, or using the siege equipment they crafted from the wildling remains. (we already saw them using the equipment such as chains)

Benjen comes back and dies. Night's Watch is completely obliterated. They are coming over the Wall. Jon made other Starks to retreat to Winterfell, Jon stays to fight. He is about to die. At that lowest point, *DANY* comes with her three dragons to aid the North. 

Like the show, her children roasts the fuck out of Walkers. The Night's King exploits this mess as an opportunity, and throws the spear at one of the dragon like the show. I would like to fix it to The Night's King throwing the spear at Drogon who Daenerys rides on instead of Viserion, but since I don't know how that will play out in Season 8, I will leave it untouched.

She loses Viserion, and carries Jon to NOT the boat, but *Winterfell.* Here, the northerners including Starks see dragons for the first time. We see Sansa and Arya interacting with Daenerys. 

The rest is pretty much same as the show, Jon and Dany fall in love (although I don't think he should pledge his loyalty at this point), they have sex. The Night's King resurrects Viserion.

If *Littlefinger has to die* for the sake of Season 8, then make Daenerys ultimately execute him for a treason of helping Lannisters through the help of Sansa's testimony, backstabbing Littlefinger.

That's about it. Any feedback?",13,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

Otherwise, if they do refer to it as English, they must recognise that England is in fact a country in the GOT universe?
Then this must mean that the GOT universe all takes place on earth? 

This is all based on the fact they call it English. If of course they give ""English"" another name, then j guess this post has been pretty pointless.

I have been reading a lot about zombies in my monster studies class. I'll keep this as short as possible, but if you want to read this in depth, check out this amazing article (https://www.thing.net/~rdom/ucsd/Zombies/ZombieManifesto.pdf) 

&amp;nbsp;

To give some quick background on the zombie &gt; The zombie comes from Haiti during the coming of global capitalism in the form of slave labor. The zombie reflects Haitians fear of becoming enslaved without agency, becoming brainless, by a master outside their control (which they rightly fear &gt; European powers were horrific to them).

&amp;nbsp;

The article above argues that the zombie in its modern adaptation is also a monster of capitalism. First, the zombie is scary because it reveals the threat of losing our consciousness and becoming a part of the monstrous horde (89). Second, the zombie is a stand in for our current moment, and specifically for America in a global economy, where we feed off the products of the rest of the planet, and, alienated from our humanity, stumble forward, groping for immortality as we decompose, (93). We fear the zombie because we fear losing our sense of Self, and we especially fear the zombie because we are always at risk of becoming one (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnZGdC-vTCo to find out how much of a zombie you really are!)

&amp;nbsp;

The interesting thing to me about GoT is that is it repaints 16th and 17th century Europe, a time where kingdoms vie for power, where foreign religions threaten security, where global trade is beginning to take effect, and where a particular religion seeks to take control of a whole region (sound familiar?). It is Europe at the cusp of modernization. It is Europe at the dawn of Capitalism.

&amp;nbsp;

I like to think of Wights as the coming of this peculiar form of zombifying capitalism (think: Winter is coming ... Capitalism is coming!)  Of course, they have no economy of their own -- but the Night King seems like the capitalist and the Wights his enslaved workers. The Wights are zombies that are to be feared of ... but I wonder ... these Wights have no House, no Name, no Titles, no Kin. The Wights aren't playing the game of thrones, and they aren't dying at the hand of the game's inevitable swords and daggers. Certainly, the most horrific acts committed in GoT have been committed by humans. I wonder who is scarier: my own King . or the Night King? Ramsey Bolton or the Dragon Wight? Who has it better: the brainless Wights or the pawns who fear death, torture, and rape in the larger chess game for the Iron Throne?

&amp;nbsp;

My question to you all: 

1. Who are you more afraid of: mankind or the Dead?

2. Would you rather be a brainless member of the Wight army? Or would you rather live in the shit-filled, gory world of Westeros as a free folk, where you can die any second as a miserable pawn in a game of kings and lords and handsome princes?

3. Do you think capitalism has a place in all this?

4. What do you think the Night King wants?

5. Do you think you are a zombie?

Two queens who are at odds for the throne. 

Some of his best scenes are when he has one on one conversations and drinks with them, and while we understand the main theme of his dynamic with each of them (where Cersei despises him and holds him responsible for anything bad that happens to her, while Daenerys respects, values and deeply cares about him to the point where she is overprotective of him), we are also given a look on how layered his relationship with each of them is.

The way I see it is that Cersei can connect with him in a way she can't with others sometimes, she has some form of respect for him where they have battle of wits and they just know each other better than anyone else. Their conversation in the S3 finale is one of my favourite Tyrion/Cersei scenes.

With Daenerys, they kind of have this marriage of two minds where they both want to make the world a better place but they sometimes have disagreements but are trying to understand each other even if they don't agree 100%. Their first meeting where they speak alone was a massive highlight of ""Hardhome"", their chemistry really met my expectations. Also their conversation in ""Beyond the Wall"" is one of the most underrated scenes of Season 7 IMO.

It really is a very interesting parallel on how he relates to both his sister by blood (Cersei) and his sister figure (Daenerys). They are all just very well written/well acted scenes, and Peter Dinklage's chemistry with both Lena Headey and Emilia Clarke is top notch.",9,26,False,spoiler,,,,,

I mean lets face it, it is part of the shows identity and we all love it! After all, all men must die right?

I am very interested in knowing what scenes have been the most shocking to you and really stood out?

Here are my 3 most shocking scenes.



3) The scarification of Shireen
During the different discussions taking place between Stannis and Melisandre about this being a possibility, I really did not think that they would have actually gone through with it. I told myself ""surely not will they portray a graphical representation of child being burned alive"". Especially when that child is extremely nice and sweet! Wrong! They did actually go through with it and i felt so bad that i then thought scenes like that should be illegal in TV!



2) The Red Wedding
So i am expecting this to crop up for a lot of you here, i mean that in a good way, or a bad way, to be honest i am not really sure how to put that one. For me this was the first true big shocker. It really did catch me out and i did not see any of it coming one bit. It all unfolded so quickly and before i knew it the episode was over. My girlfriend said to me that she didn't think she could go on watching the show and all i remember doing is needing to go out for a cigarrette, and i did. That whole part is a complete shock but what really got me was the beautiful and optimistic conversation that Rob and Talisa shared right before one of the most graphically disturbing scenes i have ever seen - the death of Talisa.



1) Sansas wedding night
If you are wondering why this one takes the prize over the most horrific set of events that is The Red Wedding, or any other scenes and situations that have upset you in a similar way. Sansas wedding night hit me a from more of an emotional and mental angle. I mean so far we had already witnessed plenty of rape during this show and despite all of being so dark, Sansa getting raped for the first time on her wedding night made me feel sick. I had survived little girls getting burnt and women being stabbed and having their throats slit but there was something about this scene that truly disgusted me. We watch her and root for her as she goes through so much shit and abuse through out the show and i think this is what had done it for me. Again, she was sweet and innocent and completely vulnerable, but always managed to survive and hold it together. Once more this tragedy caught me out right until the moment was pretty much happening. Despite them just having a wedding, my mind just wasn't travelling that far into the story or thinking about the fact that Ramsey is going to want to get his pecker wet! I honestly even thought (and was literally begging) that Theon was actually going to step in at the last minute and prevent Sansa from going through with it. It's just the way you see Ramsey bend her down and forcefully rip open her clothes and basically tells her she is going to take it right before the episode cuts and the camera focuses on pussy-boy Theon Greyjoy. It is almost as if George R R Martin is doing this on purpose!


So there you are, my 3 most shocking scenes!

He swung the sword that took Ned's head. Ilyn Payne, though he only did this upon being ordered by *KING* Joffrey. So, Ilyn Payne is on a death list for simply being the poor shlub commanded to do a job.

On the other hand.... in season 7, Arya killed Littlefinger during his ""trial"" for treason and murder. Sansa, the Lady of Winterfell, passed sentence for him to be killed. Arya cut his throat. Afterward, Sansa and Arya stand on the walls of the castle to discuss Baelish's execution. Sansa says to Arya, ""*You* did it."" Arya replies, ""I was just the executioner. *YOU* passed the sentence.""

Arya separated herself as the instrument of the will of ruling lord. She takes no responsibilty for killing Littlefinger. No different than Ilyn Payne doing the same thing to Ned Stark after being commanded by the king. But, as far as we know Ilyn Payne is still on her kill list. Arya seems to be acting a bit hypocritically.

**EDIT:** If Arya encounters Ilyn Payne in season 8, would she release him from her Death List? Does she now understand that Ilyn Payne played no reasonably controllable role in the death of her father?",28,14,False,spoiler,,,,,

I'm a lore guy when it comes to the shows and games I watch so I geek out of like things like this. What peeked my interest specifically though was how after she question which was the faceless god(Arya named and pointed out a couple statues of gods in the room) Jaqen replied to her ""There is only one god. A girl knows his name. And all men know his gift.."" First watch through I was already overwhelmed with everything so I didnt even think anything of it but now it strikes me as odd. Especially since we're all the way in season 7 and we've had glimpse and hear say of SEVERAL gods. For the only justifiable/real gods in GoT are the many-faced god and the red god (lord of light.) The reason being obv theres something there with the many faced god allowing you to ya know rip different faces on and off. Amd as far as the lord of light goes idk if what Melisandre did to Baratheon with the whole vagina shadow ghost hitman spirit was actually the red gods doing or something else at play but beyond that theres jon snow being revived, the gnarly guy who was chopped in half by the hound etc.. but the loop this all together I'm curious to what Jaqen meant!

The Stark and Targaryen families throughout history seem really stacked in terms of magical ability. 
Feel free to correct me on this but from what I can tell:

Starks
- Warging - common throughout Stark history &amp; GRRM confirmed all Stark children have this ability
- Greensight - Bran

Targaryens 
- Unburnt
- Ability to ride/control dragons 
- Greensight - Brynden Rivers, bastard of Aegon IV Targaryen, former 3-eyed raven
- Prophecy - Daenys the dreamer foretold Doom of Valyria

Reading about other houses, I haven't come across anything that stands out in terms of magical ability. Of course I realize that there are many instances of others using magic in GOT but when it comes to the great houses most of it seems to go to Starks and Targaryens. I have no special theories about this - just something I noticed in my re-watching.  

Anyways, feel free to quote Bobby B now.",38,18,False,spoiler,,,,,

Was just thinking about how many main characters other than our man Jaime are also killers of kings, some indirectly and others actively.

Cersei: yes it was the boar that killed Robert, but really it was Cersei (also, indirectly Tommen)

Jon: put an arrow through the King beyond the wall

Brienne: sword through Stannis's heart

Olenna: poison in Joff's cup

Euron: pushed Balon off the bridge

Roosey B: put the dagger in Robb's heart (even though the Freys get the credit)

-edit-

As people have pointed out the list also contains

Dany: locked Xaro in his vault

Melisandre &amp; Stannis himself: Renly by spooky voodoo

Didn't realize just how long the list is. Didn't realize just how many Kings have died. ",16,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

First of all the video above is really interesting. It explains how Rhaegar predicted all the events and he knew from the Ghost of Highheart that he had one of the three biggest roles to play.

When he met Daenerys in her visions, while being together with Lyana and baby Jon (Aegon) and told her that ""there must be another"", he meant Daenerys. Rhaegar, Aegon and Daenerys are the three heads, the heroes of the story. I think the vision was not a literal event in the past but a dream/interpretation of what could have been.

There are just too many parallels between Jon and Dany, if you try to trace all the events from Season 1/Book 1 you start to pin point that every event happening to either Jon or Dany is a parellel event between the two.

Therefore I believe that since they are tied together in destiny they will either both die or both live. It doesn't make sense for only one to survive/die. Both have been built to become great so it's silly to just die if another lives.

What do you guys think ?

If my recollection is correct, Jorah Mormont was sentenced to death by Ned Stark ""Warden of the North"". Which means that all of his bannermen (Lyanna Mormont Especially) are honor-bound to carry out that punishment.   

Makes you wonder what the fate of Jorah Mormont will be. I can certainly imagine Jon Snow (after having fought alongside him) pardoning him for his past crimes. Never-the-less I doubt that the old types would take kindly to that. Since the shows start I feel special attention has been given to Jorah, on multiple occasions he has escaped death, mostly by chance. (A great feat in GOT for a character that doesn't have plot armor *cough* Jon Snow *cough*) On top of that he is the closest character to Daenerys, saved her life on multiple occasions and is primarily responsible for her being where she is at this point in the show.

I have a hard time believing Jorah would be used as cannon fodder to further the plot. That being said what do those here think season 8 will hold for the ""Disgraced Knight""?

Edit: I understand he was given a Royal Pardon but that was under strenuous circumstances and is probably too much of a reminder to Jorah of his betrayal, I doubt he still has it. Even if he kept it, I wonder what weight the name Robert Baratheon carries now that he is dead. Didn't do much for Neddard Stark... ",16,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

Her family dead before her eyes, She got separated from a friend (Gendry) and maybe soon to be beyond friends (Cough Gendrya Cough), Almost joined a death cult, had several near death experiences, and pretty much when from a little girl to a skilled assassin. However her fate is sort of a enigma as it is hard to tell how her story is going to end as it could end in many different ways.

You can argue that for all the characters but there are so many roads her story could end on it makes her fate an enigma. But I have some ideas so let's get too them:

1. She dies- Okay so this is a theory that I had for awhile and that is Arya dies paralleling the death of Lyanna. But where as Lyanna died giving birth to Jon Arya would die saving Jon in a similar bed of blood, Which in my opinion would make her end a bittersweet one and if there is another Stark death before the series ends I think Arya will be the one who bites the dust. If they did it right it could be the second saddest death on the show (I will never forget about Hodor).

2. She leaves her family forever- Now Yes Arya may end up leaving her home and family forever there are two ways to look at this. One she could go and return to the Faceless men and become fully No One but I don't think that will happen to be honest. The second way to look at it is that she leaves to lands more west which has been forshadowed before. Maybe she will be the discoverer of the WOIAF Equivalent of The America now that would be very interesting.

3. Queen of the Seven Kingdoms- Now I made a post awhile back theorizing that Arya would become queen of the Seven Kingdoms which I will leave a link to at the end of this post and I still think it is possible. GRRM is known for giving roles to people you would not think would have that role and not a lot of people think Arya will be queen at the end and that is why I think it is possible she could be.

Okay now here is the link: https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/606kxe/everything_proving_that_arya_could_be_queen_of/

4. With Gendry- Okay so I am 50/50 on Gendry and Arya hooking up do I think it will happen? Like I said I am 50/50 on weather or not it will but let's say it does it could make sense (maybe she and Gendry are lord and Lady of the Stormlands or King and Queen of the Seven Kingdoms or maybe they go off doing there own thing not worrying about Kings and Queens) For one it fulfills Robert's wish, It was forshadowed in S3, Gendry is near WF now, and if they ended it in a way where not all loose ends are tied up in a bow (as in she still has to try and learn to live a normal life) then this could work.",24,7,False,spoiler,,,,,

I just got to the chapter when Arya and the Brotherhood without banners meet the ghost of high heart. I decided to look up a little bit more into this. And I saw something interesting... 

The ghost of high heart prophesied that the price who was promised would be born from the line of Prince Aerys (The Mad King) and Princess Rhaella.

Now this could mean a direct link and confirm that Dany is the princess that is promised. 

But, it is also possible that it is Jon because he technical still is under that lineage.

The only big thing know is that some family gets entirely wiped out in season 3. It's so much fun to watch someone who has been completely unspoiled to experience GoT for the first time. To see him completely shocked that Joeffery was Cersei and Jaime's kid was hilarious. He called Sean Bean dying during the first credits though which was a disappointment but funny he figured it out that fast.

Here are some of his predictions for season 2:

The big bad is the White Walkers because that's all anyone can talk about at the Nights Watch, he also said he's interested in that plotline because he thinks that is the one that is gonna matter. It's funny how close he is with this one.

Ayra and Jon will be the last Starks alive, even though Jon isn't technically a Stark. I about died at that one, he doesn't even realize how close he is to the truth.

The characters that are going to die in season 2 are Robb, Rickon, Bran and Jaime

Watching GoT with someone completely new to the series really refreshes the whole series for me and reminds me how clueless I was when I was first watching it.",10,46,False,spoiler,,,,,

The way the story weaves everything together means you can make an argument for almost anyone being integral. But, I'm looking for characters that fit three criteria:

1. They are still alive (or at the very least, undead)
2. They are not already thought of as a pivotal character (i.e. don't say Arya)
3. You can imagine a path to them making a difference in a way that is not already part of their role (i.e. it can't be a respected warrior killing someone in a battle)

Some examples from the past:
- Dontos Hollard: drunkard who was key in Joffrey's assassination.
- Strong Belwas: eating poisoned locusts intended for Daenerys (Note: he is part of her protection but this seems entirely accidental).
- Lancel Lannister: another pawn used to assassinate a king, setting in motion the War of the Five Kings.
- Podrick Payne: saving Tyrion at the Battle of the Blackwater by killing a member of the Kingsguard was pretty unexpected at the time.
- Hodor: we're not talking about it.

These things are pretty much impossible to predict but would love to hear some theories.

You wouldn't like it if someone did that to you. Be a good community member, and respect others wishes. Thank you)

Okay, so I just started Game of Thrones. I recently finished The Last Kingdom (a BBC historical medieval drama), and thought to start this show since it is somewhat similar. I loved the first episode. Sean Bean - who voiced Martin Septim in Oblivion - has an outstanding performance! Ned Stark is my favorite character by far. He reminds me of a Norse warlord. Definitely going to grow on me as the series goes on.

Is there anything that I should know of? I will not be reading the books until I am done with the series. I'd like to know a bit about Ned and his family, the Starks. I have a feeling that I will eventually become a huge fan, this show is like a ten star movie from what I've seen in episode 1. It's in my tastes, being a medieval fantasy fan! 

Thank you all, GOT fans!!",41,14,False,self,,,,,

Falsely it talks about the men at the wall, but the pledge is actually about the Night King itself. 

&gt;""Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come"" 

The Night King is not supposed to be the Enemy of men, but the Shield of men, he is basically breaking his Ethernal oath, by attacking men and entering their realm.

Personally my theory is that the ""Night's Watch"" is the job of the Night King. There must always be a Night king. The one who kills him have to take his place, and serve his duty. Just like the Captain of the flying Dutchman. This ship / realm always need a Captain / King.

The Nights King is the watcher of the darkness and the night. ",14,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

When Samwell goes beyond the wall as part of the Knights Watch there is a scene wherehe is huddled up behind a rock as the NK and WW are approaching. The NK stops next to him, stares him down, and then does nothing to him at all.

We all think it will be Jon or Dany or Jaime or Jorah but I believe it will be none other then our favorite creepy, Green seeing, and not able to use his legs Stark Bran Stark. I believe at the end of the books and show he will be the one who takes down the NK and defeats the WW's. So what evidence do I have for this:

Evidence:

- A lot of people believe that it will be Jon, Dany, or Both who save the day but I believe that is the point. To make us believe they will be the heroes and in reality it will be someone else in this case Bran.

- There is obviously a connection between Bran and the NK. For one Bran saw his origins (or what we are led to believe is his origins) back in S6, Then he was touched by the NK which allowed the NK to find him, Bran can see his armies approaching, and the NK can sense when he is warging into something as seen in S7.

- Jojen was very determined to bring Bran to the three eyed Raven and for a good reason. But what was that reason maybe he knew that Bran was the key to defeating the NK and needed to bring him there so he could be ready.

- Bran I think is obviously very important to the story as he has been given a lot of screentime, He is the very first character to be introduced after the Prologue in the book and the show, and in the show if the showrunners did not know he was that important they would've killed him off in S6.

- Now in Lord of the Rings (the film by the way) after the prologue we are immediately introduced to Frodo and depending on how you look on it Frodo was the main character of the Lord of the Rings. In Game of Thrones after the Prologue Bran is introduced and with this parallel into consideration Bran may be the main hero of our story.

- Now you are probably ""But Darryl Bran was acting creepy last season"" Well this creates another parallel to Frodo as Frodo started acting very creepy when he had the One Ring with him.

- Also it would fit the Bittersweet ending if the hero was someone who became this person who does not seem to have emotion (granted I think Bran still does but you get the point).

- Bran also ironically enough fits part of the AA/The PTWP prophecy. Bran Was reborn admits Salt and Smoke when he emerged from the crypts after WF was attack all those years ago The Salt being salty tears and the Smoke from the chaos, He was under the Red Comet and woke up not too long before it appeared (in S2 by the way if you are curious) making the Red Comet the bleeding Star, If Bran Wargs a Dragon he would in a metaphorical sense have the blood of the Dragon, That Dragon would be his Lightbringer (either that or a Weirwood at the God's Eye), Meera is his Nissa Nissa, and Awakening Dragons for stone could be when he reveals to Jon his true parentage.

- Three Eyed Raven if Bran got touched and knew he was more important then just being a Greenseer and the next three Eyed Raven he would want him to trained/learn as much as possible before the NK could reach the Three Eyed Raven's tree.

- I feel it be fitting that while Bran never became a knight like he dreamed but he ended up not only becoming something more powerful but also became a hero.

Now even if this ends up not being true you have to admit I think that Bran will have a important rule to play in the endgame of the story ",9,8,False,spoiler,,,,,

but i want to watch them by the order they meant in the Blu-Ray, so the timeline is correct (if there is any). 

so, here in the **[wikia](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Histories_%26_Lore)** there is a listing of all episodes of that animated series.

Aelia Galla Placidia was the grand daughter of the Emperor Valentinian the Great on her mother's side and the daughter of the Emperor Theodosius the Great and half-sister to the Emperors Arcadius and Honorius. She was born in 388AD and was in Rome when King Alaric of the Visigoths showed up and began besieging it. Through means and reasons unknown, Placidia ended up captured by said barbarian horde before they ended up famously sacking Rome in 410AD. She was carted around with them for a while until Alaric died and Ataulf became king. Ataulf was trying to find a place for the Visigoths in the Roman empire and after killing off the right people to win the Emperor Honorius' favor, married her in a lavish ceremony. So, woman of imperial blood married to a barbarian king, sound familiar?

But it gets better. Not for Ataulf sadly. Galla Placidia only had one child with Ataulf, a baby named Theodosius, which Ataulf certainly hoped would cement his people's bloodline in the Imperial court. This child would not live past it's first year and die tragically when Placidia was 27. That same year, Ataulf would be assassinated in the bath by a rival tribe member leaving a power vaccuum. First born son and husband die tragically before their time? Check.

The Visigoths were momentarily ruled by the assassin's brother, Sigeric. I say momentarily because he's only recorded as ruling for approximately a week. Sigeric apparently treated Placidia terribly because of her ties to the old king and reportedly made her walk 12 miles on foot while chained up to his horse, along with several other slaves. Being chained up and treated like dirt by the same people who she had once been the queen of? Check.

Sigeric was murdered and replaced by Wallia who quickly surrendered himself to Constantius III, the effective ruler behind the throne of Honorius. Placidia was returned to the royal court in exchange for rights to settle in Roman territory and food. Placidia was then married off to Constantius III, apparently at the request of Honorius, but she apparently hated the idea of marrying him. 

She didn't hold much sway, being a woman in these times, and suffered through the marriage. She had two kids with him, one of whom would end up being the Emperor one day. Valentinius. Through various political machinations I won't get into because this post is already really long, Constantius III was named Augustus of the Western Empire and she gained the title of Augusta at the age of 33. Following the suit of Ataulf sadly, Constantinius would die in less than a year. After some weird incestuous bout with her brother, the emperor Honorius (even more familiar considering how Viserys treated her), she packed up and left to Constantinople. 

A lot of complicated things happen up to this point, but I'll cut to the chase and say that eventually Placidia found herself as the Queen Regent for Emperor Valentinian III while he was underage. This set her as the acting ruler of the Western Roman Empire for 12 whole years which she apparently maneuvered deftly and wisely. So, going from a captured bride who was sold off for grain to one of the most powerful and influential figures in the western world? Pretty familiar.

So there all that is. Obviously, I have no direct quote from George R. R. Martin saying ""this was an inspiration,"" but there's enough correlations between their stories that makes it kinda hard to believe that he didn't at least read up on her before writing the books. I really like finding these inspirations in history and there are already so many I've found listening to the History of Rome. I might write something up for the other ones I've found if I have the time. ",2,18,False,spoiler,,,,,

&gt; Additionally, since Wagner is currently in the midst of shooting the final season of Game of Thrones, he spoke a bit about **reuniting with Battle of the Bastards and The Winds of Winter director Miguel Sapochnik to shoot episodes 3 and 5 of the final season**.

Its a very exciting season. Im shooting again with Miguel, so were back together as a team and weve got a couple of very exciting episodes ahead of us. But I cant, unfortunately, tell you anything about it.

&gt; **Can you say which episodes youre shooting?**

&gt; **WAGNER: Were shooting Episode 3 and Episode 5**.

&gt; Nice. Well I very much look forwards to seeing that. Im sure nerves are high on the final season.

What I actually think will happen: I predict a Lord of the Rings type of ending, with the good guy (Jon) winning but the effects still lingering on giving a bittersweet feeling.

Jamie:"" First, I killed the pyromancer,and then when the king turned to flee I drove my sword into his back.""Burn them all"", he kept saying.""Burn them all."" I DONT THINK HE EXSPECTED TO DIE. HE MEANT TO BURN WITH THE REST OF US AND RISE AGAIN REBORN AS A DRAGON AND TURN HIS ENEMIES TO ASH. I slit his throat to make sure that didn`t happen.""

So the theory is that this exactly will happen after she has died and been burned. She already has shown that she is a ""real"" dragon unlike other characters who have claimed this for themselves e.g. Rhaegar ""the last dragon"", Aerys the Mad King and viserys -&gt; but unfortunately ""he was no dragon. fire cannot kill a dragon"" :) . But it could give Rebirth to a dragon, just like the burning stake for Khal Drogo gave life to Daenerys dragons. And after her cremation Daenerys will turn into a ""REAL"" dragon and fight the last battle against the white walkers, maybe killing Viserion and the Night King and maybe die again...",7,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

I think after he let his queen; Dany down with his mistakes, after noticing that he is already being replaced by Jon as the person she listens to the most and with failing to win over Cersei's support in the Great War. I think he is going to be very unsure himself again bringing him back to how he was in the beginning of Season 5.

I just can't help but feel bad for him throughout the entire time I was watching Season 7, he wanted to win the war against his family with minimal amount of violence as possible where they'd be forced to surrender. But when none of that works, it only starts to divide him away from both sides more and more. I can only imagine the emotional roller coaster he must be on.

I really would like to think that the writers did all of this with them knowing what they have planned for him, one where it doesn't involve him leaving Dany's side for his sister's (which seems very illogical and OOC IMO) and involves him redeeming himself for his failures coming out of it in a way that really benefits him and Dany. 

I think while S7 focused a lot on how much Dany can trust him and where his loyalties lay, I think his story in S8  will focus on his redemption and how much he really means to Dany.",12,6,False,spoiler,,,,,

Yes I believe he will have two wives just as Aegon the Conqueror had his sister wives Rhaeneys and Visenya. Now the first one is of course Daenerys who I think is the Rhaeneys of this for one her name sounds like Rhaeneys (Daenerys Rhaeneys) so I think Jon will marry Daenerys and she will be pregnant with his child.

But who is the Visenya....Well I believe it will be Sansa, Why well for one Sansa name sounds like Visenya (Sansa VisenyA), Also let's think about how the last few seasons have gone between her and Jon, For one in the original outline Arya and Jon were to fall in love and Sansa and Jon's reunion felt more like a couple reuniting rather then siblings, Also when they are near the fire place the lightings says it all as it is lite like a romantic scene sort of, Also I want to bring up a interesting parallel.

Jon when to Dragonstone to meet with Dany who he would later fall in love with, Dragonstone has Dragon in it's names and Dragons in the story represent Fire, When Jon reunited with Sansa in last year's season they were at the Wall which guards against the WW's, The WW's represent Ice in the story. Jon meets Dany in Dragonstone (fire) and Jon and Sansa reunite at the Wall (Ice). Also there is a very great post that my friend DarrylthedudeWayne made awhile back I will leave a link to it here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/61b97a/everything_my_theory_on_sansa/

In that he mentions that Jon got the Pink Letter from Ramsey he at first does not want to go but is convinced by Sansa, Maybe Jon did not do it just for family love but may have saw something in Sansa he has not seen before. Also fair to mention when Jon and Sansa argued in this season it sounded like couples arguing in my opinion and also the show has made visual parallels between them and Ned and Cat, Speaking of Which all the way back in the first book of the series (and also the first season) Ned tells Sansa when they return to WF (if they return) He will pair her up with someone more fitting Honorable, Gentle, Strong. Jon is Honorable, Gentle, and Strong depending on how you look at it.

Now before I continue I just want to say I don't think Arya will be Jon's Visenya for a lot of reasons but mainly because 1. Arya is way too young and Jon I don't think would be comfortable marrying someone who is like a kid 2. Arya and Jon have seen each other as Brother and Sister as Jon was her fav sibling but Jon and Sansa have never been that close meaning they probably never saw each other as real siblings 3. If Arya is too end up with anyone in the story it would most likely be Gendry and 4. In the first season the line that Ned said to Arya you will marry a King and rule his castle was change too you will marry a High Lord and rule his castle meaning if Jon is king at the end he is not the High Lord but Gendry would be a High Lord if he is legitimized.

But the fact that the original outline had a Stark on Snow/Targaryen romance could mean that GRRM and maybe D&amp;D will retool that into a romance between Jon and Sansa. Finally if Jon marries Dany and Sansa he have control over the north and also all of Dany's allies. Now for Dany there has been forshadowing that Dany would marry Jon I will not get into all of it but I will mainly focus on the forshadowing in the show and the books from the House of the Undying. When Dany goes into there she has visions one of them being a WF Blue Rose on a thing of Ice this could mean the son of Lyanna is at the wall, Also in the show Dany has a vision beyond the wall where she enters a tent where she meets Drogo could this symbolize her love (NOT Drogo but Jon) beyond the wall as Jon was beyond the wall at this point in the story.

Finally for both of these Jon's true Targaryen name is Aegon. So if my theory is true next season Jon may marry Dany at a Weirwood in the White Harbor (if they are that madly in love) and she will be pregnant with his child, and later he will marry Sansa maybe Sansa will also be pregnant with his child, and like Aegon had his sister wives Jon will have his aunt and cousin wives. However it will not last long as Dany will either die in childbirth or not die in childbirth but will be sacrifice to forge lightbringer, Jon and Sansa would be king and queen of the Seven Kingdoms with Jon and Dany's child being heir to the throne and Jon and Sansa's children being Heir to WF.",32,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Jon is the only one to still have his direwolf by his side, which should be important. Ghost is a character, as far as I'm concerned, and he is more than just Jon's pet. He is far less expendable than the writers and directors treated him.

The writers and directors of the show have said it would have been too expensive and difficult to put Ghost in, but that is total bs. Arya's direwolf, Nymeria, makes an appearance in S7 and looks pretty realistic as far as I'm concerned. So the 'creating a realistic giant wolf with visual effects is too hard' excuse seems like a cop out to me.

As far as budget goes, I think there was plenty of room for Ghost after some adjustments. I could've done without the polar bear scene. Some might disagree with me on that point, but if given the choice - Ghost or the polar bear - I'd pick Ghost without hesitation.

I'm hoping to see more of Ghost in S8. With the scale of GoT's final season, I think it is very likely that we do.",9,14,False,spoiler,,,,,

However, despite how great those are, I think the one that I like most was the drastic switch of Olenna's ensembles from seasons 3x3-6x7 to 6x10-7x3.

We were accustomed to her wearing the greens, yellows/golds, blues, and a number of assorted colors that correlate with House Tyrell/The South. Yet once the main branch of her family gets burned alive in the Sept of Baelor does her attire take a turn for almost an entirety of blacks. It's very clear it's meant to emphasize her being in mourning, and it lasts from the moment she hears the news up until her own death, but I also enjoy the thought that it's very much a liking to a withered rose.

I enjoy the series's use of the color black for empowerment and dominance, especially for the likes of Dany and even Cersei, but I also enjoy the mourning/tragedy aspect it holds true with Olenna. I'll always feel upset about the missed opportunity that D&amp;D had with her discovering what happened to her family, but the wardrobe alone (along with the wonderful Dame Diana Rigg's acting) provides more than enough emotion to make up for it.",3,25,False,spoiler,,,,,

See Edit 2 below for dramatic conclusion.  Hint: I was right!  And I was wrong.  Which one more so, though?  Wrong, I was more wrong 

- - -


So I mentioned this a long time ago and everyone sneered at me for failing to understand the concept of accents.  But after another rewatch, I'm beyond convinced that I wasn't crazy.

We all know there are characters in GOT known as maesters; they're the castles' resident bookkeepers, scientists, healers, confidants, usually all-around good bros (except Pycelle).

So for the entirety of the first season and most of the second, everyone on the show pronounces it ""MYE-ster"", to rhyme with ""scheister"" and ""mice fur"". 
But somewhere before season 3 they start pronouncing it the way they have since: ""MAY-ster"", which rhymes with ""baster"" and ""face fur"". 

So my question is: did anyone else notice this?  Will someone please confirm I'm not losing my mind?  Or will you disagree again, and call me ridiculous names like ""obsessive"" and ""weird"" and ""who gives a shit dude""?

Thanks.  Please help.  

Edit: I'm going to open up the damned .srt files, ctrl-f 'maester', check em in video, and post the results.  I realize this maester up some negative feelings but I need to know the truth that killed Jon Arryn

- - -

Edit 2: Well folks.   As u/aardvarkyardwork has said, both pronunciations did happen, but I was wrong, there was no split point where they corrected pronunciation, with 100% version A before, and B after.  I just went through Season 1 checking maesters, and the final count stood at 17 mentions, with 12 being Mayster, 5 Myster.  Only one was tricky, with Bran jumping over the word quickly, but I had to give it to Mayster anyway.  

So there you have it.  I now can say with confidence that 1. I know the uncomfortable feeling of being proven wrong about something after being absolutely sure of it before, and 2. I just wasted probably 20 minutes of my life proving to eight strangers online how much of a fool I am.  With that said, it's not a total washout... more than a third of the maesters actually were the wrong pronunciation.  So there's that. 

Time to go commit seppuku, I'm a man of my word.  You think my life is some precious thing to me?!  I'm not gonna kill myself.  Not because of this, at least. ",20,6,False,self,,,,,

The mad king had always had infatuation over her and maybe its possible that he took her, either with force or not, and that resulted in Tyrion. Making Tyrion a Targaryen and half-brother to Daenerys and uncle to Jon. Some clues were hinted such as Tywin saying before he was killed by Tyrion You are no son of mine because he really wasnt his son and the dragons allowing him to touch them and free them in Ep 6.02. Theres a lot of evidence that goes against this too, like why doesnt Bran know and if he was a Targaryen why didnt Tywin kill him as a baby. Just curious to see your thoughts :)",28,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

*The first time it shows up is when Robert wants to kill the rest of the Targaryens -
 
1 [Robert and Ned](http://78.media.tumblr.com/0084d64485e62eaed21a50cd24e10973/tumblr_inline_oxyb8kW02y1uko8lz_500.png)

Its almost as if Jon is in background behind Ned and Ned is in front, protecting Jon from Robert.

The second time it shows up is when Varys and Littlefinger are talking about power and ruling -

2 [Varys and Littlefinger] (http://78.media.tumblr.com/3af889d6f2eda5001cb5b15cc2ee67dc/tumblr_inline_oxyb8lFSWH1uko8lz_500.png)

This symbolises that Jon is the rightful heir to the iron throne and he should be the one wielding power.

The third time it shows is when Dany is in her house of undying visions -

3 [Dany in the throne room] (http://78.media.tumblr.com/7ce8801089ebeb711ba57d83d8b5789d/tumblr_inline_oxyb8l9P2s1uko8lz_500.png)

The blue winter rose is shown in the throne room as well as *snow* (Or ash from burning the red keep being burnt I don't know) covering the floor. This once again shows that Jon is the rightful king.

Lastly we have Sansa being cloaked...

4 [Sansa in the throne room] (http://78.media.tumblr.com/5aff3c17be444210b053d3ab144ad102/tumblr_inline_oxyb8lnloZ1uko8lz_500.png)

Cloaking symbolises marriage and in Westeros its a common marriage tradition. We see Sansa being cloaked with the blue winter rose (Jon) right behind her. 

The book version is Sansa getting covered with a white (colour of snow) cloak stained by fire and blood, words of house Targaryen...

We clearly see Jaime open up the wagon full of gold and give Bronn his cut. Directly afterwards, the Lannister force is set upon by Dany and her forces which resulted in a complete defeat. Later, we can see the Dothraki sifting through the spoils and the entire Lannister force being forced to bend the knee. It would seem unlikely that a single wagon could have slipped out of the massacre unnoticed, making it's way all the way back to King's Landing without a guard.

In the same episode, we see Cersei talking with the Iron Bank rep and she is assuring him that the debt is being paid in full with interest and the gold is on it's way (in the wagon). The Iron Bank rep says multiple times that she will have the backing of the bank ONCE the debt is payed and not before.

At the end of S7, Cersei says that she wants to let the Northern forces fight the Walkers alone and then mop up whats left. Jaime protests her and asks how she intends to do this. She says she has the Iron Bank at her back and intends to buy the Golden Sun mercenaries to fight for her and bolster her forces. Jaime flees in horror to join the Northern Forces.

How exactly does she intend to pay for the mercs if she never received the gold, thus never receiving the backing of the Iron Bank? If the gold did arrive, how the hell did it manage to escape the ambush of the Lannister forces by Dany's forces?

Is this a major plot hole or did I miss something?

Cersei is about 10 years older than Tyrion and even if she believed that as a 10 year-old, I doubt someone with her upbringing would continue to believe that a newborn was responsible for a death during childbirth as she got older. There has to be another reason, *I think*.

In the books... I don't think Stannis and Mel were bumping uglies. I think Stannis' motivations on the surface were to save the realm, follow the laws and act justly. And below the surface I believe he wanted power.

I'm up to S2E2. I'm in no way complaining about the show or the book, I just like comparing and contrasting things. 

In the books I find Samwell to be a kinder character, while in the show he seems to be more motivated by sex. In the show he's constantly talking about how he misses women and wants to have sex and on and on. But in the books, while he does touch on these subjects it's not a major motivating factor for him. I think it changes the tone of his character a lot. 

Like, in the books, when he gets to Craster's keep and he helps out Gilly, I very much feel that he helped out Golly because he's a kind person and felt sympathy for her and her situation. In the show it feels like he helps Gilly because he wants to get laid. 

He does more or less all the same stuff, so far, it just seems like his motivations are different.",9,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Last season, Jaime Lannister finally makes the decision to dump Cersei and join forces with Team Targaryen. Who knows how he will be received by the mother of dragons, but I have a theory. 

We saw glimpses of Danaerys' evil side last season (burning her opponents alive and what not) that resembled her father, the mad king's, disposition. 

My theory is that Jaime ultimately gets accepted into the Targaryen camp, after a hefty amount of persuasion by his brother. However, at some point he can't help but notice the similarities between his new queen and her father, the late Mad King Aerys. Eventually, her quest for glory and desire to cleanse Westeros with fire becomes too much for the kigslayer to bear, and to the horror of many GoT fans, he slays the queen, ending years of buildup and preparation. I think it is a perfect end to her story and a nice full circle for Jaime's character loop as well. Thoughts?",33,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

The Histories and Lore special features are totally worth the price of the Blu-rays on their own, even if you already have GoT on another format. Theyre some of the best special features Ive ever seen on anything.

But Im often disappointed with the things that are left out, and with only one more batch of Histories and Lore yet to come, it will be the last chance for some of my favorite topics to be covered. If theyre not on season 8, theyre never happening.

So personally, I really want to see The Long Night covered, and I suspect it will be this time since clearly the White Walkers are going to be a bigger part of season 8 than ever before.

I also really would like to see the Blackfyre Rebellion covered, in fact a different segment for all five of them would be ideal. This one seems unlikely to happen though, the Blackfyre rebellions have barely been mentioned in the show and I really doubt that theyll all of a sudden be a big enough part of the show to warrant five segments of Histories and Lore. However, the Golden Company was mentioned at the end of season 7 and they may end up being a major part of the final season. Since the Golden Company was founded by Aegor Rivers, a.k.a. Bittersteel, who played such a large part in all five Blackfyre Rebellions, maybe theres hope.

So does anyone have a topic theyd like to see covered in the last Histories and Lore?",5,5,False,self,,,,,

Jorah's arc.  

At this point Jorah has nowhere really to go as a character.  The disgraced knight looks set to redeem himself and regain his honour at some point in Season 8 by dying nobly in Dany's service or defence during the Great War, and that's all well and good, but it is... expected.  It also kind of makes his contraction of Greyscale, his miraculous recovery, and Sam's rediscovery of a practical cure feel sort of pointless.  He'll most likely die along with many others in the final good fight, and the fact that he had the disease won't ultimately mean anything at all to the larger story.

But it could've been different.  Imagine if, as in the show, the Fellowship goes beyond the wall, and they fight a Wight-Bear (if the writer's insist), and Thoros is mortally injured.  Jorah is the one to save him while the Hound is paralyzed by his fear of fire.  Jorah himself is also badly injured in this battle, or perhaps in the later confrontation with the White Walker scouting party (this would help to remind viewers that the White Walkers are a serious threat one-on-one, even to major characters like Jorah, since we have now seen Jon killing two of them with relative ease - actually having an easier time of it than he did with Karl Tanner, the legend of Gin Alley.  They need to be re-established as highly dangerous foes at this point).  

So, by the time the Fellowship are trapped on the rock in the middle of the frozen lake, both Jorah and Thoros are dying side by side.  And they do both die, as comrades in arms.

So the army of the dead are on pause surrounding the lake.  The Night King is looking on and considering his next move.  He remembers (duh!) that he can raise dead people to fight for him, even at a distance.  Since his main force is prevented from attacking the Fellowship across the broken ice, he instead uses his powers to raise Thoros and Jorah.  The Fellowship have a hard time (both physically and emotionally) killing the risen Thoros - it would probably work best if Beric delivers the re-killing blow to his old friend.  But to everyone's surprise Jorah is not resurrected.  His body remains inert.

This doesn't mean much to the Fellowship at the time because they don't know Jorah has suffered from Greyscale in the recent past.  In re-telling the tale to Dany and co later, they mention this strange detail, and although Dany knows Jorah had the disease the significance of it doesn't strike her either.

It's not until some later point, when Sam is informed of this anomaly, that he realizes what is up - having Greyscale somehow prevents Wightdom.  It is like an innoculation against being added to the army of the dead.  And if the fighting population of Westeros can somehow be exposed to a mild form of Greyscale that is then cured the Night King will be deprived of new recruits on his march south.  A mass immunisation programme is needed!  

Sam would have to figure out how this would all work.  He certainly wouldn't be performing thousands of operations like the one he did on Jorah.  Most of the theorizing and innoculation would happen of off-screen, since it may not be the most rivetting watch - but in effect Sam would be the inventor of vaccinations in Westeros, making him a highly significant figure in the realm's entire history.  Jorah would also be owed the gratitude of future generations, and Sam would write in high praise of his memory, so that Jorah would not be remembered as a slaver and traitor but as the man of high integrity he actually was despite his mistakes.  History would commemorate Jorah as a reverse version of Typhoid Mary.  His name would be immortal.

I think this storyline would fit with the themes of wild magic slowly giving way to the ""rational"" science and scholarship of the Citadel, the old world of dragons and Walkers giving birth (albeit 
with very violent pangs) to a gentler age of medical men like Qyburn and scholars like Sam.  

I would also like to see the Stone Men, who have been exiled and despised like lepers, being reintegrated into society and playing some part in the salvation of the world through their ready supply of infected blood / cursed touch.

I know this is long, and some of it might sound stupid - who really wants to see a blood donation drive in the ruins of Old Valyria? - but I think it could work in parallell with the Jon / Dany military campaign against the Night King, and would salvage the Greyscale storyline from being just an entertaining timefiller, making it an integral part of the overall plot.

What do you think?

1694,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2017-12-23,2017,12,23,8,7ll3iq,self.gameofthrones,[EVERYTHING] My Arya Theory updated,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/7ll3iq/everything_my_arya_theory_updated/,darrylthedudeWayne,1513985120,"Okay so this is sort of a update of a old post I made awhile back were I proved that Arya could be Queen in the end. I'll leave a link too it here https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/606kxe/everything_proving_that_arya_could_be_queen_of/

So this is an update version of that and also a continuation of the theory, So yeah the theory is that at the end of the story out of all the people to be ruler of the Seven Kingdoms, Arya Stark a little girl and second daughter will be queen of the Seven Kingdoms. Since then Season 7 has passed and I have found more evidence for this so let's get started. This the updated version of my theory that Arya will be queen of the Seven Kingdoms at the end. With Evidence:

- Okay so one of the pieces of evidence I mentioned in the previous post is that Arya would actually have a background in politics and ruling as she most likely learn some of that in WF as a young child. She also may have overheard and learned some things when at Harrenhal under the company of Tywin. Well there is another piece I forgot to mention and that is that she also could've learned some stuff from the faceless men as well, Remember one of the things the Faceless men teach is learning how too lie and also to learn when someone is lying, and in fact the FM's have ties to the Braavos politics so she may have learned some of that as well. Also in the books she is being send into the city to learn new things, Perhaps this could help her become a leader. Yes she does not stay to long in the show though she could've easily picked up on stuff like this via the montage in S6. Another thing I mentioned is that her being queen would parallel the queen of Dorne Nymeria. But it would also parallel with Alysanne Targaryen and also Visenya Targaryen.

- Now you are probably thinking ""Darryl did you even see S7 Arya is not fit to rule, She is a Psychopath/Maniac now you tried to threaten her sister and wanted the heads of Robett and Yohn Royce cut off"" But when you rewatch the season and that storyline I think there is a good amount of evidence to suggest she was only playing the game of faces to get Sansa into not trusting LF. First she knew that Sansa obviously did not want Ned to be killed as she was there when she witnessed Ned's beheading as well and saw Sansa pleading for him to live after that Brat Joffrey ordered for his head, She also most likely lied about not serving the enemy as we know that she served under Tywin, Finally there is the scene where Sansa finds the bag of faces she gives Arya Catspaw at the end of it. First of all Arya was acting completely off in this scene and I think there was a reason she was playing the game of faces with her right when she confronted her about the letter (or after seeing Sansa's meeting with Glover and Yohn Royce depending on how you look at it), That is why she was acting like that to push her/Manipulate her into not trusting LF and also too see if she can really trust her, And when she gave her catspaw that was her saying ""I'm on your side still. Don't trust Littlefinger"". Finally the biggest piece of evidence for this is that after the death of LF she asks Sansa ""Are you alright"". Another big reason I think this though is that Arya was not acting like that when she returned, Yes there was the scene between them about Glover and Yohn Royce but that was before she found the letter and I think she was only doing that out of her love for Jon. But when she found the letter and started confronting her is when she started acting off....Maybe that was because she was playing the Game of faces to try and manipulate/Push Sansa into not trusting LF.

- Also you have too remember she has been through a lot. She was striped from her family, When to Harrenhal and witness Death, Torture, and in the books rape, She was at the twins right at the red wedding, Joined a literal death cult, Had a near death experience, and killed a lot of people.

- In the first book Catelyn stats that she got ""A Father too queens. I never asked for this cup to pass to me"" Why would Queens be Plural? Perhaps forshadowing of sorts.

- Also after Arya kills all the Freys look at how the camera presents her when she takes off Walder's face. You swear she was some sort of ruler or a Queen.

- In childhood Arya was interested in ruling a holdfast or become a member of the Small Council. Another thing to keep in mind is that she looked up to Visenya Targaryen.

- Arya has always seem to try to model herself after Ned. Hell in S7 she even dresses like Ned. She may not be a political type but in history most good rulers and monrachs have been not in the political field but were good, Disciplined, good to there people, and make sure they have advisors they can trust. As for her not wanting to be a lady. Well being a lady and a female-monarch is totally different. Plus look at Daenerys she is a queen and yet while she does not fight with a sword she still is not a typical lady as she had started to go into battle on her own with her Dragons (NOT saying Arya will have Dragons just using Dany as a example).

- Usually GRRM likes to go for the unexpected and Arya being queen would fit that. Arya never wanted to be a ruler or a queen as that was not her, But that is a Plus for her being queen as GRRM may want the new king or queen to be someone who does not want it and never thought he/she would have it and Arya is the perfect Dark horse for this.

- As for the show well people will say ""Pfft that's the books Darryl D&amp;D would never do something like that"" Well they have said the ending will be the same (or atleast similar) to the Books ending so if George's intention is too make Arya queen D&amp;D may do the same.

- Also yes she is alittle violent though a good hand can help balance her. Arya would as queen also be able to detect when people are lying too her and also see through people.

- Okay so there are two ways this could go down either she is queen alone or she is queen with a king. I believe that if she has a king then Gendry could be this king and that Arya and Gendry will marry at the end and be King and Queen. So let's look at what evidence there is that Arya and Gendry will hook up at the end, So first fair to mention that Gendry was raised into life as a lowborn. Arya while high born has associated herself with lowborns as well (this would also be important to rule as they would know the struggle Lowborns go through). Another thing is that in season 3 Arya tells Gendry ""I will be your family"" With Gendry replying ""You will not be my family you will be my Lady"" there is other stuff but this post is long enough so be sure to check my friend Jack's post on this for more info https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/76mku5/everything_gendrys_role_next_season/

- Finally when Ned and Arya talk in the books Ned stats ""You will marry a king and rule his castle, and your sons will be knights and princes and lords and, yes, perhaps even a High Septon. This references her being queen but also in the show it is changed too ""You will marry a high lord and rule his castle"" I believe the show line could either imply that gendry will just be a High lord of Stormlands (and yes I think he will be legitimized) and Arya the queen will marry him and rule his castle along side her own or it could mean nothing. But If Gendry is king as well then Arya would be marrying him and ruling his castle along side him. As for the high lord thing well High Lord's can be consider kings as well.

Now I don't know if Arya will be queen or not but if she does become queen I think it would be a very good and unexpected twist.",18,11,False,spoiler,,,,,

(Hope I did this right Im unfamiliar with posting on Reddit lmao)


Ive been binge watching the entire show for the first time and the show has been awesome so far. I think everything was great (except maybe the 2nd half of Shaes storyline but Im starting to understand the reasoning behind it now)

Throughout season 4 and the beginning of season 5, it looked like Sansa was finally becoming a player of the game and she was learning from Littlefinger. I know Ramsay Bolton is already a bad sign for Sansa, but I was under the impression she was going to take Winterfell from him eventually with her newfound confidence.

But then she goes right back to being a victim like shes always been for the entirety of the show. Why? Is there a payoff to this?

Another thing that irks me is that when making Theon watch, I feel like theyre making this story about him. So was all that development of Sansa unimportant? Or am I missing something?

Im not outraged at the fact she was assaulted, Im mad because now she appears to be scared and timid again when she was finally becoming confident and stronger",13,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Like, something with a hand on fire will be ""The End"", meaning the End of the war with the White Walkers.

A hand on fire could mean two things in my opinion: Something with Jaime and the wildfire. There's a strange and important connection between Jaime and Bran and the wildfire and the White Walkers.

The other one is potentially a ""hand"" burning, and by ""hand"" this could be Tyrion burning towards the end. But this is much more tinfoil. I definitely think it relates to Jaime more.

My phone is not cooperating. Now....I'm not a fan of bringing characters back for the sake of shock value; however, if it benefits the narrative, I'm all for it. Having said that, I'm not necessarily in favor of resurrecting him...it's just that...I feel his story hasn't truly come to a close. Now I know that he will be mentioned in Season 8 due to the fact that he was so instrumental in the chaos that is the ""game of thrones"", but it goes beyond that.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I'm convinced that we will see Littlefinger walking upright once more (and not in the form of Arya wearing his face). One option: he is reanimated as a wight once The Night King lays siege to Winterfell. Option 2: Melisandre needs him alive in order to help R'hllor see things through. Option 3 (which stands at a 0% chance of occurring ): They borrow elements from one of the characters in the books and apply it to a different character on the show. That character? Lady Stoneheart. I'm not saying that he'd end up leading The Brothers Without Banners or anything. I'd just love to see Littlefinger 2.0. He'd be unstoppable and a small part of me could truly see it working if done correctly.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Now I know that they don't have enough time to introduce a Petyr Stoneheart storyline, but it's Christmas goddammit and a boy can dream. Regardless of this ill-conceived idea, I'm still excited to see Arya get that new ""Chaos is a ladder"" DLC and rock the shit out of her new Petyr Baelish skin.",10,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

1. They probably know Sam and Jon are close friends.

2. There was probably a maester  at the ToJ, since Ned called for one and it would make sense for Rhaegar to have arranged one to be there to deliver his child, which means they know Jon's true parentage and claim.

So they put those pieces together and they give Sam the high septons diary which chronicles the event, whilst frustrating him into leaving the citadel with a bumbling old bunch of beaurocrats act. They also give him access to the area of the library with WW information because he would be unlikely to leave without something to help Jon.

The motivation is what has already been revealed about their quest to rid the world of magics and the reference to them eliminating the dragons that once were. The warlocks of Qarth said Dany's dragons brought magic back into the world, so it would make sense that the citadel would want to do what they did before and eliminate the dragons. It would be reasonable of them to assume that if Jon knows about his claim it might cause a conflict between himself and Dany that will at least weaken her position.",3,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

It has been recently accepted that since Jon Snow is a legitimate son to Rhaegar, that it is Jon who is the rightful heir to the Targaryen throne, and not Dany. I don't think so. This is why....

1. Aerys II (aka the Mad King) was on the throne with an heir in place.

2. Aerys' heir was Rhaegar.

3. Had Rhaegar outlived Aerys, Rhaegar would have been the king and his heirs (Jon Snow) would have been in line for the crown. 

4. *BUT*... Rhaegar died at the Battle of the Trident, slain by Robert Baratheon.

5. Because Aerys was killed by Jaime Lannister *AFTER* Rhaegar's death in battle, the line of succession would have gone to Aerys' oldest living child, which at the time would have been Viserys.

6. When Viserys got his golden crown, this would have passed down to Daenerys.

I think a reasonable argument can be made toward Dany being the rightful Targaryen heir to the Iron Throne.

The most trouble i've found is with season 4, in my opinion by far the best season. It has so many good episodes i'm unable to say which one is the best.

Especially the episodes, 2, 8, 9 and 10 are hard to put in order.

Right now I would say my list is like this:

1. E10: The Children

2. E2: The Lion and the Rose

3. E9: The Watchers on the Wall

4. E8: The Mountain and the Viper

5. E1: Two Swords

6. E6: The Laws of Gods and Men

7. E7: Mockingbird

8. E5: First of his Name

9. E4: Oathkeeper

10. E3: Breaker of Chains

The thing is, how much do you want to judge an episode by one scene? Tyrions trial and Oberyn vs Mountain are the absolute highlights, though I rate the episodes 2 and 10 higher overall.

Lots of rambling I see now :D

I know that today Cersei is a monster, but when I compare the two women's mothering skills, I see a different picture.  As scary as King Joffrey was, I can think of times Cersei stood up to him--and whenever Tywin disciplined King Joffrey, Cersei sided with her father.  On the hand, Catelyn never contradicted her kids on anything.  She tells Bran not to climb in that rapid, ineffectual speech of hers, and Bran promptly ignores her.  When Talisa comes into the picture, Catelyn does not tell Robb to man up and keep his promise to the Freys as Ned would have done.  The saddest part, however, was to watch the way Arya and Sansa behaved in Kings Landing.  Ned was entering a dangerous territory when he accepted a position as Hand of the King.  One would have expected Catelyn to demand that the girls to be on their behavior, knowing as she knew that the previous Hand had been murdered.  Needless to say, the girls were completely oblivious and wrapped up in themselves: Arya only thought of swordsmanship while Sansa obsessed over her blond prince.",5,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

I then noticed that same mustache guy suddenly being in the Night's Watch in S4 and no idea why or how. I've now reached the point where he got killed by Hodor, and I'm still trying to figure out exactly why he was at the Night's Watch in the first place, and what his goal was.

So bear with me and hear it out:

The greatest question in Game of Thrones is simple: What is the meaning of the White Walkers? Many people dont think twice about their meaning, they have accepted that the WW only service the storyline as simple, mindless, absolute evil beings. Yet this is not consistent with GRRMs writing style. Most things in this story (everything of importance) have a deeper meaning: every character, every name, even minor details can have hidden truths behind them. These deeper meanings are revealed as twists in the story line, and these reveals are part of the reason GOT is so popular. There are countless examples:

The names of the Dragons and the significance of their riders is one of my favorites: Drogon (rode by Dany, named after the man who spurred her real character arc). Rhaegal (presumably will be ridden by Jon, named after his father). Viserion (is killed and betrays her for the NK, named after her brother, Viserys, who also betrayed her). GRRM couldve named them anything but he gave them deeper meanings that included incredible foreshadowing. The same is true for Hodor, he couldve been named anything, but GRRM used his name as a mechanism to advance the plot. Hell, he couldve actually made Jon Ned Starks bastard and the plot couldve advanced the exact same way up to this point. But the point is, this is how GRRM writes. Every major plot twist in this story reveals that it is more complicated than we can imagine, Martin has woven these stories incredibly deep and thought of every aspect, and each of these twists are carefully, perfectly foreshadowed so that everything comes together once its revealed, making perfect sense. Which is why the many question marks surrounding the Night Kings actions and intentions lead me to the following conclusion

My theory is that the NK is not an absolutely evil being, his goal is not to destroy life, his goal is to unite the people of Westeros, whenever they are most divided, by being a common enemy. My theory is not only foreshadowed, but it functions perfectly when thinking about the purpose of the story:

First we must look at why they were created: To protect (The children of the forest) against mankind. We all know they went on to turn on the COTF, and this ended up uniting the COTF and the First Men against the WW. But looking at this from a wide narrative perspective, did they actually fail their duty? Had they done what the COTF wanted, no outcome would have been favorable: Either 1) the First Men defeat the WW and then view the COTF in a much more intensely negative light. Or 2) the WW and Children prevail and take over Westeros, and face threats from foreign invaders for the rest of time until one finally conquers them. Instead, the WW chose to fight both the First men AND the COTF, forcing them to make peace and unite against a common enemy. So in the end, the NK didnt protect the COTF from mankind, he protected ALL sentient beings from themselves by ending their trivial bullshit wars and creating one that wasnt just a simple struggle for power.

This is exactly what hes doing now. Westeros has become a mess again. Greedy lords fighting for power at the expense of their people and even themselves in some instances (RIP Olenna). Simply put, everything that the NK has done in the books and the show can be rationalized by this theory: Every action the NK takes will help the seven kingdoms unite themselves against him. Most of his questionable actions fit perfectly with this theory:

Why didnt he have his wights chase Bran (a great threat to him) and Meera after Hodor died? He needs Bran as the TER so he can spread the word of the dead coming and so he can assist Jon in the Great War.

Why did the WW spare Sam in S2? The NK knew Sam would go on to discover the significance of Dragon Glass, as well as play a vital role in revealing Jons true identity.

Why didnt he kill Drogon, even though he was significantly closer to him and he is a much stronger dragon? He needed a dragon to break down the wall, but if he had killed Drogon, he wouldve also probably ended up crushing any chance of the living stopping him, considering everyone who will presumably unite the Seven Kingdoms (other than Tyrion) needed Drogon to escape the battle.

The reason he can see these things is because I assume hes a greenseer (how else can he touch Bran in Brans vision?).

From a narrative perspective, this theory works perfect. Before I thought of this theory, I was extremely conflicted. By the end of season 7 we dont know who the true antagonist is. Is it the NK or is it Cersei? I believe there is a single answer to that question, and I believe its Cersei. She has one of the highest airtimes in the show so we have been able to observe why and how she develops into the monster she is today. We know and understand her better than the NK, and at this point I believe she has, and will continue to, become the embodiment of absolute evil, and the downfall of humanity. She doesnt represent a supernatural evil, or magical threat to humanity like the NK. She represents a very real tangible evil and greed that we have seen throughout real-life history and still see today. This evil, evil and greed among the human race is actually the biggest threat to humanity. Cersei is the antagonist, she embodies The Game of Thrones, or The Wheel Dany references, she perpetuates the suffering of the common people in an effort to keep herself and her family in power. The NK being the main antagonist as a totally evil being would be too simple, and wouldnt work as a metaphor for the story (we know GRRM uses his stories as real-life metaphors, and his stories definitely arent simple). Anyways, at this point in the story Jon and Dany are heading North to fight the NK, indicating Cersei will probably die last assuming both of them do die.

Lastly: this theory has been foreshadowed. Old Nan says that Brans favorite story was always the Story about Bran the Builder, the man who united the living against the dead and through this created peace, and also happened to found the greatest house in the North, House Stark. But the real foresight has been hiding in plain sight since the first scene of the story: the mysterious symbols of the dead. We know the spiral is an ancient COTF symbol they used for rituals. So why would the dead continue to create this symbol? Maybe to show that in the big picture they actually have been doing the COTFs bidding the whole time: protecting the living against the living themselves. But heres the kicker: what is the meaning of the phi symbol the WWs like to leave around (the circle with the line through it, seen in the opening scene in episode one, and also seen in the caves under Dragonstone)? The symbol phi is an ancient symbol for the golden ratio, it represents universal harmony, creativity, and balance. So if the NK was a purely evil being who wants to destroy all life and completely disrupt universal harmony, why would GRRM associate him so closely with this symbol? Because he doesnt want to destroy the living, because he isnt an absolute evil. He wants to scare the living hell out of everyone in Westeros and remind them that the trivial political conflicts they engage in everyday are worthless and costly in the grand scheme of things, and he wants to demonstrate to them the power of a united people. Not only would this be a jaw dropping, perception changing, plot twist. The likes of which we would have never seen, not even in this show. But this would also be a beautifully fitting metaphor that happens to be extremely relevant to our world today. Theres a good chance Im wrong, but I would be disappointed if the meaning of the NK was as simple as most people think. Yet, knowing George RR Martins style and love for using his works as real-life metaphors, I wouldnt be surprised if Im close to the mark.

TL/DR: To me it's pretty clear that at this point, the NK is no longer the main antagonist in the story, it's definitely Cersei. This means the NK must have some other meaning. I believe he is not an absolute evil being like most accept he is, but in fact the whole purpose of his life is to help unite the people of Westeros whenever the Game of Thrones becomes too costly (The Long Night, and now). Read above for more detailed examples of foreshadowing and narrative functions that better support my claim.",26,44,False,spoiler,,,,,

My phone makes it difficult to make new paragraphs more often than not. Now, I was just watching season 6 again and can't help but to be drawn to one scene in particular: the creation of The Night King.

   Bran watched as the Children of the Forest pierce a piece of dragon glass into the heart of a man. A part of me feels as though Bran will draw inspiration from this and come to the realization that, in order to defeat TNK, one must repeat this process with The Children of the Forest....especially if they want to have any chance of coming out victorious. If this dumb theory is correct, it could explain why The Night King seems to have it out for Jon Snow (if he is indeed destined to undergo this ritual). It could, however, be Dany. 

   If it is Dany, it would fit quite nicely into her aspirations of becoming queen and her affinity for granting freedom to those who are enslaved. She ultimately replaces the Night King and, as the ""breaker of chains"", allows for the wight walkers to move onto the peaceful afterlife that has eluded them. Now, I don't think that this will happen. I just think that it could happen. ",12,12,False,spoiler,,,,,

&amp;nbsp;

I have a theory about Game of Thrones that has not been well received in the past, but I keep coming back to it for some reason. I want to share it one last time, because on the off chance there turns out to be truth to it, the internet remembers, right? 

&amp;nbsp;

The easiest way I can explain this theory is to use the guide of the spiral symbol that plays such an important role in the series. In other words, Ill start from the outside (current situation in Westeros) and gradually work my way into the heart of the theory as clearly and concisely as possible. 

&amp;nbsp;

### Westeros is fucked.

&amp;nbsp;

### Westeros is fucked because of the return of magic.

* In case you didn't know, an army of the dead is coming to kill everyone. 

&amp;nbsp;

### At the same time, the return of magic has directly benefited Bran, Daenerys, and Jon. 

* Bran becoming the three-eyed raven and having the ability to warg.

* Daenerys awakening the dragons from stone and being impervious to fire.

* Jon returning from the dead and being able to fight the White Walkers.

&amp;nbsp;

### The return of magic can be traced back to Stannis Baratheon.

* Melisandre first predicted that after a long summer, ""the cold breath of winter shall freeze the seas and the dead shall rise in the North."" She and Stannis worked together to bring black magic back in order to help Stannis' cause. Ever since Stannis' death, Melisandre has talked about how what she did was a terrible mistake, suggesting that she feels partially responsible for Westeros being, again, fucked. 

* Remember this? My enemies have made my kingdom bleed. I will not forget that. I will not forgive that. I will punish them with any arms at my disposal. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; You think some fire god commanded all of that? It was Stannis! Only Stannis. 

&amp;nbsp;

### Because of his connection to the return of magic and the return of magic being terrible for everyone except for these select few characters, I think Stannis is linked to Bran, Daenerys, and Jon.

* In support of this, the red comet, which is associated with the return of magic, only appears in conjunction with their storylines during the episode where we see Stannis for the first time (first Bran at the Godswood, then Daenerys at the Red Waste, then Jon Beyond the Wall, then, finally, Stannis at Dragonstone). 

* The link is strongest between Stannis and Jon when they're together at Castle Black (also seen in details as tiny as the way both characters say the word ""battle""), but it's also suggested in Daenerys' ability to take Dragonstone (and her mastery of the word ""fewer""), as well as Bran's apparent connection to the White Walkers and mysterious significance in the overarching conflict (making Bran's horrifying discovery of the Army of the Dead that much more powerful in retrospect). 

&amp;nbsp;

### Bran, Daenerys, and Jon can also be linked to Cersei  through Tyrion, the Gift. 

* Tyrion visited Bran at Winterfell after his fall and reported back to Cersei about it after. 

* Tyrion advises Daenerys, and helped bring her home safely.  

* Tyrion oversaw Jon's journey to Castle Black and reported back to Cersei about it after, and has been advising Jon since Season 1. 

&amp;nbsp;

### Stannis and Cersei both have emotionally revealing scenes where they talk about a parents love for their children and their lack of choice when its between their children and everyone else, which sound like responses to Maester Aemons love versus duty question. They chose love over duty. 

* Maester Aemon: If the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other, what would he do? ... Love is the death of duty.""

* Stannis conversation with Shireen: ...if a man knows what he is and remains true to himself, the choice is no choice at all.

* Cerseis conversation with Sansa: ...love no one but your children. On that front a mother has no choice.

&amp;nbsp;

### Therefore, I believe that Stannis and Cersei are the parents of Bran, Daenerys, and Jon, and that theyre the reasons why a) Westeros is fucked and b) those three are still alive.

* GRRM has warned fans repeatedly that he strives to tell stories with morally grey characters/situations, and that good and evil are two sides of the same coin. The ""song of ice and fire"" encapsulates this idea of our least favorite characters being on the same side as our favorites, as well as this idea of both the horrors and wonders of magic. 

* We've been shown time and again that there's always more to the story than it seems. We still have an entire season to go, and a lot of questions need to be answered, which is why I believe there's room for this theory to come to light in the final season.

&amp;nbsp;

### If this theory holds true, then Westeros only chance is if Bran, Daenerys, and Jon choose duty over love, potentially sacrificing themselves in the process. This has been foreshadowed in the scenes where Bran, Daenerys, and Jon each venture beyond the Wall to unknown futures. 

* Bran going North of the Wall to find the Three-Eyed Raven 

* Daenerys going North of the Wall in her vision at the House of the Undying 

* Jon going North of the Wall after the Battle at Castle Black

&amp;nbsp;
	
**And that, folks, is how you break the wheel.** 

&amp;nbsp;

You probably don't believe this theory. I don't even want to believe it. Come the dawn, we shall see.

&amp;nbsp;

*In order to keep this post short, I had to omit a great deal of evidence that supports this theory by casting doubt on the generally accepted notions of the story. If you have any questions (like why I believe Cersei would lie to Jaime, or why Bran/Daenerys/Jon would have false identities), just ask.* ",80,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Like are people really needing to be spoon feed are they that...Like What!? However I do like the idea of Bran being responsible for his creation. So maybe instead of Warging into the NK and becoming the NK he instead he goes back in time and speaks/whispers into one of the first men to get him to warn the children (similar to how he calls out to his father in the tower of Joy), and this First man ends up being captured and has Dragonglass pierced into his heart by the children and Bran realises this first man he tried to convince to save the world is the NK.

And that Bran is responsible for his creation, He is the one who caused his creation, he is the one who ultimately led to the NK's creation. So I believe it will go full circle and I picture it is that right after the First man gets turned into the NK he realises he caused his creation and in a full circle the NK arrives at the WF tree and NK kills his unknowing metaphorical creator Bran.",3,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Don't get me wrong, she's by far one of my most favorite characters. But the fact that she's been so strong and invulnerable in the show --at least before her dragon died-- has become obsolete, possibly even boring. We need a twist to make the show more exciting and realistic like it used to be.

Dany's greatest wish, the one she's endured all her troubles for, is the crown of the seven kingdoms. I strongly believe she should not get her wish, she should instead have to sacrifice herself in order to save another character or just to defeat an enemy of the realm.

I want her to die realizing that her greatness doesn't stem from an iron throne or a Targaryen heritage, but from the principles she upholds. A sacrifice of her greatest desire in favor of her most noble beliefs. That's what makes a true hero. That's what Azor Ahai is all about.

We've seen a glimpse of this when she risked herself and went to the north with her dragons to save Jon and company from the Night King. And with her dragon dead, I think she's starting to realize that she'll have to sacrifice way more to get what she wants. Except, is her desire a crown or the salvation of humanity?

I want it to be the latter, and if it's that really the case, I think she should be put in a position where she has to choose either her life or the accomplishment of her goal. Because that will cement her as the true hero of the show, even more so than Jon who is the embodiment of a hero. Why? Because she'll be giving up something she has always desired for the benefit of others, while Jon never really had something other than honor and his father's approval to aspire for, and he doesn't have to give up these two things to become a hero.

Well, that's what I think. What do you guys think about this ?",62,14,False,spoiler,,,,,

Peter Jackson's team made Tolkien's Smaug (aka Smaug the Golden, the Last of the Great Dragons) much bigger than the original book version. Here's a drawing by Tolkien himself depicting the dragon:

http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Smaug

And here's a approximation of the film version:

http://www.theonering.net/torwp/2013/05/11/71530-analysis-just-how-big-is-jacksons-smaug/

Which turned out to be really accurate:

http://dragons.wikia.com/wiki/File:Smaug-the-hobbit-dragon.png.jpg

But Balerion... George Martin's Black Dread was even more of a giant flying mass:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q7_37YcvKs

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcyN_tH25R4

Book Smaug: about 25 meters (80 feet) long. Film Smaug about 60 meters (200 feet). And Balerion, judging by books and show... 80 meters (260 feet) long. TV Balerion is smaller than books Balerion, but not too much smaller.

No wonder Aegon conquered kingdom after kingdom. With such a flying beast under his command he could have taken any realm he wanted.

Next step for the authors would be to make the dragons almost the size of Godzilla. It almost feels like a competition to see who's dragon is biggest. ",16,43,False,spoiler,,,,,

North: Ruled by King in the North Jon Snow, pledged to Daenerys (So is he back to Lord Paramount and Warden of the North??)  

Riverlands: I think technically Baelish was the last official LP of the Riverlands being granted Harrenhal.. or were the Freys also granted Harrenhal and LP of Riverlands? I forget. I'm guessing Edmure Tully would technically be in charge now? Though still a hostage.  

Iron Islands: Salt King Euron Greyjoy.. or is he a LP again since he's ""under"" Cersei?  

Westerlands: Uh.. Cersei probably is taking control by force. Not sure who the next technically living heir *should* be though. Tyrion? He said he's not sure he's a lord anymore though since he killed his father. Other than him IDK?


Vale: Robin Arryn, not sure who his ward will be though. ~~Waymar~~ Yohn Royce?  

Iron Throne/Crownlands: Cersei obviously.  

Reach: Supposedly all Tyrells are gone, obviously not the case in the books but regardless. Tarlys were I believe made LP of Reach and Wardens of the south.. but they're gone. So one could argue Samwell Tarly is? But technically not as well since he swore the night's watch vow. I'm guessing it would fall the to Hightowers next, assuming no other Tarly familys like was the case with Tyrells.  

Dorne: I mean the Sand Snakes never would have been in charge anyway, Arianne would be ruler, but not in the show. So I think they will just ignore it because I don't even know who else could be ruler in the show at this point.  

edit: Derp forgot one of the reasons I made this post;  

Stormlands: ??? in the future maybe Jon and Dany legitimize Gendry and make him lord of storm's end, but who is at this point in the show? Selwyn Tarth is the only named lord I can think of in the show. Maybe Davos somehow via Stannis?

It shows how he whined from my least favorite character and Basically in my eyes the R-rated version of Prince Charming from Shrek to one of my most Favorite characters and very interesting and complex one at that, But what will his ending be well I believe his end will be with Cersei and I believe he will either die at the hands of Cersei before he kills her....Or (and this is a counter theory too that) maybe something else.

Now At first if AA was not Jon or Dany I thought it be someone like the Hound or Davos or Arya but after thinking about it I think it makes sense that Jaime is Azor Ahai, Of course I think that Jaime will indeed kill Cersei but I think it will be to forge Lightbringer but I am getting to ahead of myself let's get to the evidence:

- Jaime if the theory of him being Areys son is true then he has the blood of the Dragon.

- I think Widow's wail is his Lightbringer

- the Bleeding star could be the Sept being destroyed by wildfire as the Star of the faith is red, or maybe it was the red comet.

- Awaking Dragons out of stone could be awakening the Dragon within him when he finds out his possible true lineage.

- Cersei is his Nissa Nissa.

- Now what is interesting is that Jaime's arc fits his arc, First the water is his time with Brienne in the Riverlands is the water but that could not take him away from Cersei, The AA tried tempering a Lion Cersei a lion destroying the Sept made him go closer to leaving her but not enough, then finally he finally leaves after she lied, and I think he will kill her fulfilling the Nissa Nissa prophecy. However it could actually go like The Water is taking the Riverrun back for House Lannister (however in the books the water could be him killing Lady Stoneheart), The Lion is Tyrion, and Nissa Nissa is Cersei (or maybe Cersei is both the Lion and Nissa Nissa or maybe Cersei is the Lion and Brienne is Nissa Nissa).

- One cool thing Alt Shift X mentions is that maybe after Jaime kills Cersei the wildfire goes off and Jaime comes out unburnt being reborn admits salt and smoke (though I think the salt and smoke is him admitting why he killed Areys in the bath Salt) and the steam being smoke (well Smoke).

Now Also he was the Kingslayer so he could be the queenslayer and the Night Kingslayer. Now do I believe this will happen, Well maybe but I don't think this will happen as I think his story will end with Cersei with him killing Jaime and the wildfire going off and dying in it (or maybe like I predicted there will be a twist where Jaime dies at the hands of Cersei which I will make a separate post on soon).

Many criticize Renly Baratheon for taking a claim to the throne but often dont consider what would have happened if he was successful. The two major talking points Ill be talking about are why Renly becoming king would have been the best scenario and why he would was the best candidate out of the 3 kings who wanted the Iron Throne.

***Why Renly becoming king would have been the best case scenario for Westeros***

To start out, lets look at the scenario that did happen with Renly having died by Stannis shadow child. Robb Stark was unsuccessful and died in the Red Wedding, Stannis failed to take Kings Landing and died at The Battle of Winterfell, and the Lannisters won The War of The Five Kings with Joffrey sitting on the Iron Throne with Margaery Tyrell at his side. The war went on for years, thousands died, the Stark family was devastated, Westeros is destroyed, the legitimate Baratheon bloodline was gone, and the Lannisters had power over Westeros.

Renly died with 4/5 of his army aligning themselves with the Lannisters after his death, Stannis states Renlys bannermen except for the Tyrells sided with him. According to the wikis, 20,000 of Stanniss army was from Renly, and Renly stated to Caitlyn that he had 100,000 men at his command, making the Tyrell contribution to his army 80,000.

Many people say Renly should have supported Stannis claim and gotten the Tyrells to join Stannis, but miss the point or motivation behind the Tyrells backing Renly then backing the Lannisters after Renlys death. The answer is simple: they wanted power through Margaery becoming queen. If you look at the bathtub/shaving scene with Loras and Renly then the attempted sex scene with Margaery and Renly, its quite clear they were trying to gain power through him making a claim on the Iron Throne, even before Joffrey and Tommen were known bastards.

So quite predictably, the Tyrells sided with the Lannisters after Renlys death since they wouldnt be able to marry Margaery to Stannis, but Stannis didnt have the people knowledge to guess why the Tyrells sided with Renly. Since the Tyrells sided with the Lannisters after Renlys death, Stannis failed to take Kings Landing, Robb Stark failed at creating an independent North, and Joffrey sat on the Iron Throne when all was set and done.

But what if Stannis hadnt killed Renly? What if Renly had crushed Stannis army the next morning then took Kings Landing? If that had happened, he would have had 100,000 or so men at his command to take Kings Landing, more than 4 times the army Stannis used, and about 3.6 times the Lannister army and Kings Landing garrisoned soldiers combined. Lannister reinforcements wouldnt have been able to reach them in time with the overwhelmingly more soldiers Renly had, and even if they had, Renly likely would have still won due to sheer numbers.

So Renly takes Kings Landing, Joffreys head is on a spike, and Renly sits on the Iron Throne, what now? With the Lannister army either devastated or away from Kings Landing, Renly would be able to help Robb defeat them, and create a pseudo independent North and the war would come to a close. The Stark family is alive and strong with a pseudo independent North and no Red Wedding, the war ended in one year instead of five, Westeros isnt a ruin, the legitimate Baratheon bloodline is alive and strong, the Lannisters are dead, and Westeros has a king they love.

Its clear that Renly becoming king would have been the best scenario for Westeros, yet Stannis dragged out the war for much longer than it needed to with catastrophic results by killing Renly.

**TL;DR:** Renly dying resulted in the Stark family failing and dying in the Red Wedding, Stannis failing to take King's Landing, Lannisters having power, Westeros being a ruin, and the war going on for 5 years. Renly not dying would have resulted in the Stark family being successful with no Red Wedding, a successful siege of King's Landing, Lannister family being dead, Westeros being mostly in one piece, and the war ending within a year.

***Why Renly would have made a better king than Stannis or Joffrey***

*-People loved Renly far more than Joffrey or Stannis.*

People loved Renly, thats why everyone went to him instead of Stannis while Stannis was only able to muster up 5K men to fight for his cause. Stannis is an incredibly unlikeable person and not one whos able to inspire love or loyalty as many characters have stated in the show. If we look at the books, Stannis is so unlikeable that even his brother in law sided with Renly.

Joffrey was hated by his people as well, there were riots while he was king and when someone threw a mudpie at him, he ordered his guards to start killing people. He bullies his people with his sadistic ways and make them fear him instead of love him. If we value what the people want and what would be best for them in any way, its clear Renly would have been best fit for the job.

*-Renly was a far better diplomat than Stannis or Joffrey.*

The biggest example of the diplomatic difference between Renly and Stannis is the handling of Robb Stark wanting to be the King of The North. Neither wanted to lose half of their kingdom when they became king, so what do each of them do? Renly offers Caitlyn a pseudo King of The North title to Robb, as long as Robb swears an oath of fealty to him, citing how Baratheons and Starks have had a long and prosperous history working together. Pretty good, right? It leaves everyone happy and does bring up a good point of them working together in the past being massively successful for Westeros.

How does Stannis reply to Robb Stark wanting an independent North? In the scene with Renly, Stannis, and Caitlyn, Stannis complains about Caitlyn being next to Renly then stating to her about Robb Stark: The Iron Throne is mine, by right. Anyone who denies that is my foe. He doesnt ask if Robb is actually interested in the Iron Throne or just an independent North like Renly, doesnt offer a possible solution or compromise that would make everyone happy like Renly, instead he gets upset at Caitlyn and digs his feet into the ground even deeper, blinded by what he thinks is his by right.

Is that the kind of king who would be best for dealing with situations and conflicts that come up between his seven kingdoms? No. The best king would be the one who comes up with a compromise and solution that everyone is be happy with, such as Renly did with Robb Stark.

Joffrey doesnt handle people well, that goes without saying, from starting riots due to killing people, to holding Sansa at crossbow point because hes bored, to being an overall cruel king. Any diplomacy done is either fucked up by him, or completely manipulated by Tywin Lannister who only has his legacys best interests at heart instead of everyones.

*-Renly is the most progressive of the three kings who wanted the Iron Throne.*

Renly does what is just and fair, without caring if its socially correct or the norm, which is why he made Brienne part of the Kingsguard as she had wished. Stannis is incredibly socially conservative, banning brothels in Dragonstone and is a religious fanatic, burning people alive to gain favors with the Gods. In the scene with Joffrey and Margaery, Margaery talks about Renly wanting anal sex and Joffrey acts disgusted and claims he has been thinking about outlawing it, despite it not hurting anyone.

From these few examples, its clear that Renly is the only one of the three that looks to whats right, not the way things are supposed to be or what they feel grossed out by.

*-Renly is the only one of the three who hasnt done cruel things.*

The worst thing Renly had done was claim hed be the best king against an illegitimate bastard and a brother no one wanted to be king. Whats the worst thing Stannis had done? Burned his nonbeliever brother in law alive, used blood magic to kill his brother, nearly choked Melisandre to death because he was frustrated, tried to kill his nephew as a sacrifice until Davos was able to convince him otherwise, burned his daughter Shireen alive in front of his army, and led to his wife hanging herself.

A king who resorts to burning loved ones alive for good luck from the Gods has no business or suitability being king. Hes a stubborn fanatic whose blinded by his religion and what he thinks he deserves, without any regard for those itll harm or whats the best scenario for people.

Theres a laundry list of cruel things Joffrey has done, but off the top of my head: abused and killed prostitutes, held Sansa at crossbow point because he was bored, had someones tongue cut out or his hands cut off because he didnt like the song, nearly force drank someone to death, and abused Sansa.

***TL;DR: Renly becoming king would have been the best case scenario for the Starks, Westeros, and everyone except for Stannis and the Lannisters. Renly was the most loved, the best diplomat, and the most progressive of the three who wanted the Iron Throne, and isnt cruel like Stannis and Joffrey were.***",133,408,False,spoiler,,,,,

Sorry for any formatting issues.

   There has been a great deal of time dedicated to Daenery's altruistic ideals surrounding free-will and slavery. This pertaining to a great number of things: her dragons, the Slaver's Bay region, the Unsullied, Dothraki, Missandei, and even herself (a slave in a sense to both her brother and Drogo).

   Ever since Bran saw the creation of the Night King at the hands of the Children of the Forest (through the insertion of dragon glass into his chest), I've believed that Dany would undergo this same ritual in order to face and ultimately defeat The Night King. I also believe that Jon will be the one to help her do so (but that feeds into my Lightbringer theory).

   Once ""Queen"" (but not in the sense that she ever expected) she will truly live up to her title as ""breaker of chains"" and free the biggest group of slaves yet: the wight walkers. Allowing for them to move on to the afterlife.

   Additionally, I'm doing another rewatch of the series and can't help but to think about her vision. She walks into the throne room as ash or snow falls down around her. She approaches the throne and, just as she's about to touch it, walks away from it. Suddenly, she is now walking beyond the wall. While I initially thought that I was way off with this theory, I'm beginning to think that it might not that far from the truth. Then again, I'm usually wrong about this kind of thing.

I can accept the mission beyond the wall to catch a wight, the accelerated travel for the sake of moving the story along, Sansa vs. Arya, I can even accept Dany's ridiculous strategy to take the throne, but to me, Littlefinger's behavior and death was unforgivable. 


Of course in the books, LF is not seen as much. I mean to say that he isn't always in everyone's face, running his mouth all the time. We hear more about his schemes and only see how they influence everyone else. This makes him far more sinister and mysterious. 


Even in the show, he was never as ""hand's on"" until season 7. He sends letters, pays spy's, spreads rumors. He nearly destroyed most of Westeros by getting someone else (Lysa Arryn) to write a letter to her sister. And tricking someone (Dantos) to give someone else (Sansa) a gift.


The show represented him really well enough, until season 7. Baelish starts season 7 as one of the most powerful people in Westeros. He has Sweet Robin wrapped around his little finger (sorry, I couldn't resist) and is practically king of the Vale, Owns Herranhal, the country is in total Choas, many great houses are going extinct or at war, Dany just arrived with Dragons, Cercei is in open war with house Tyrell, Eeuron Greyjoy is causing much Choas as across the country, Freys are all dead, Dorne is ruined, and the best part is that not a single person is thinking about him. Why would he do anything but go back to the safety of the Vale and wait it out? 


With all that said, I could have forgiven it all with a better ending to his story. (All except his ""GOAL"" of siting the iron throne with Sansa. He is smart enough to know that would never happen. No one respects or fears him and he has no powerful house name and loyal bannermen)


**Here it is.**


All the Sansa vs. Arya stuff can still happen, but when Sansa calls out LF and accuses him of several crimes, he goes through his list of tactics to get out of the situation and then says he wants a trial by combat. We would have seen him several times with a Bronn type character (maybe someone from the north that we've seen before) and LF would stand tall and confident and name that person as his champion and then the person would reveal that Sansa sent him to be LF's muscle. The fighter would then refuse and Sansa would tell LF that she accepts his trial by combat and her Champion is the North. Arya would step in front of him and smile and we would cut to Lf being pushed outside the gates of Winterfell with blood dripping from his mouth. Sansa would tell him that his tounge is his greatest weapon and if he can survive the North without it, he deserves to live. This would show Sansa outsmarting LF and finishing her character arc and story.



The world GRRM created is so vast and most of the Characters will not have clean resolutions to their story's. Even in the show there are dozens of characters that we've met that didn't have clean resolutions. This type of ending would have left his story open ended and the fans could speculate and debate for years. This leaves the character's story feeling open ended in a satisfying way. Of course LF would find a way to survive or No way he could survive the north without talking.


Would love to hear your opinions. Would this ending have made up for the LF story and death in season 7 or did you like it the way it happened?

As such, in S8 at some point, I believe Cersei will send a contingent of the Lannister Army or the Golden Company to assist Jaime as she can't imagine losing him as well, which will allow the rest of the army of the ""living"" (Jon, Danaerys, Tryion) to escape alive in the event they are overwhelmed, OR, will help them at a crucial moment to push the NK back.

Anyways it would be cool to see a movie about the Wights/ Walkers/ Children of the Forest and First men.

I mean a prequel about the COTF and their lives up until the First Men arrived, and a bit more depth into the creation of the WW. 

If the battles and stuff were epic enough (I don't recall all the details) it sounds like it would make a brilliant movie.

Maybe it could end with how the.... Wall was built and how the WW leader guy ended up hiding/ building his armies.

In the spirit of theorising I was wondering what if the Ruby Melisandre wears is actually one of the rubies from Rhaegars armour that went flying off during his fight with Robert.

I'll interject here to say if all these things already have solid explanations I don't know about yet then ignore my ramblings!! 

But Quaithe (sp?) tells Daenarys that she must go to Asshai to discover the 'truth'. What if there are actually Targaryans hidden in broad daylight. Maybe they managed to get the rubies and use them to conceal their aging like Melisandre and so Daenarys needs to go there to learn some kind of truth about her family or something...

I'll be honest my theorising on this kind of started and finished with Melisandre is Targaryan, the rubies are Rhaegars.

Any thoughts around this? Maybe you can tell me home I'm wrong or maybe play with the idea and let me know what you think a potential story could be from it?

I know some people hate all the theorising but I just love the show and I love that no matter what ends up happening, I'll never get it right but it is fun to speculate!!",2,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

Aegon's Conquest. Possibly the most brutal human conquest campaign seen in the continent. Killed many thousands and wiped out several noble houses.
