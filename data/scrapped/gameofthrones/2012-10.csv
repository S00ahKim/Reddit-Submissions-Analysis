Seriously.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/10rivy/a_question_of_about_a_passage_i_read_in_a_clash/,MississippiQueen,1349105726,"I know I'd be better off posting in /r/asoiaf, but this is my first read through the books and didn't want to be accidentally spoiled more than I have been. 

Basically this is what I'm curious about. I accidentally found a theory that Rhaegar and Lyanna are the parents of Jon Snow, and I thought that was pretty awesome. 

But I just got to the part in ACOK where Dany is walking in the House of the Undying, and looking into the doors. She comes across one and the following is a direct quote:

""Viserys, was her first thought the next time she paused, but a second glance told her otherwise. The man had her brother's hair, but he was taller, and his eyes were a dark indigo rather than lilac. ""Aegon,"" he said to the woman nursing a newborn babe in a great wooden bed. ""What better name for a king?""

""Will you make a song for him?"" the woman asked.

""He has a song,"" the man replied. ""He is the prince that was promised, and his is the song of ice and fire.""

Basically what I'm wondering is this; did anyone else think that the room she looked in contained Rhaegar, Lyanna, and a newborn Jon Snow? Is it possible that they were secretly married and that Jon Snow isn't a bastard? Or something? Did Lyanna love Rhaegar? Or is this a vision of people completely unrelated? Or was he talking to Elia about Aegon? I got confused at this part just because ""a song of ice and fire"" was mentioned, as was Aegon. Help me out, yo.

 I don't really want spoilers (by all means post them, but tag them) or anything, but can someone tell me if I'm reading too far into things? :P ",32,13,False,self,,,,,

Here's my question. She tells the kindly man that the singer Dareon is dead, but so far at least, it hasn't really showed whether she's lying about that or not. If she is, where did she get the boots? It's very possible that I missed something, but this confused the hell out of me. She also says that Arya Stark of Winterfell killed him, so does that mean that she killed him? I'm also wondering if (assuming it was something in the warm milk that she drank that caused her to go blind) she knew about the milk and that it would do something to her.

I've enjoyed reading about the various religions in A Song of Ice and fire, particularly the religions that have a significant presence or role in Westeros. 

The Seven and Old Gods seem like they get along pretty well. Nearly all courts in Westeros have a Godswood with a Weirwood tree, even if they're held by worshippers of the Seven. The North is pretty much the last stronghold of the Old Gods, yet it is mentioned that the Arryn's attempted to plant a weirwood at the Eryie. Granted, many of these Godswoods could be left over relics from when all of Westeros believed in the Old Gods before the Andals, but typically in our society when one religion moves in it invariably over time destroys references to the former.

They seem to exist peacefully with little if any animosity between the two religions. Both seem pretty tame as well. 

I see the Old Gods are more of a Native American style of pantheon, where everything is very focused on nature. The Seven seem to be in the stages of evolving from a polytheistic system (The Smith, The Mother, The Father, etc.) into a monotheistic religion (some say The Seven are just different faces of the same god) somewhat like Christianity. 

An analog might be the movement of Christianity throughout the Americas by Europeans, where Europeans are the Andals. 

The Lord of Light seems to be more of more of an analog to the meaner, more burn-you-at-the-stake version of Christianity from the middle ages. I wouldn't be surprised if The Lord of Light shares the same root religion that spawned the Seven, considering both have monotheism at their core and come from Essos. 

The Drowned God seems out of place to me. That religion seems very aggressive. I don't see it's believers attempting to wage holy wars, but baptizing your followers by literally drowning them and sacrificing your captured enemies by drowning them (without the CPR) seems pretty hardcore. The Iron Isles are part of Westeros, so I'm guessing The Drowned God somehow at some point branched off of the Seven or the Old Gods, but I can't really see how. Maybe he was at one point the general ""sea god"" that eventually morphed into it's own religion?",39,14,False,self,,,,,

Arya is doing her little cupbearing thing in Harrenhal for the Lannister Bannermen who run the place.  Tywin kinda comes and goes as the rest are left there to hold the 'city' if you could call it that.  At one point, a bunch of Bannermen (I forget which ones.. the Bloody Mummers maybe?) bring with them a bunch of northern men and put them in the prison.  Arya uses her third name on Jaqen and forces him to help Arya release the prisoners.

The prisoners are northmen - Robb's Bannermen.. so they are loyal to Stark, no?  Why doesn't Arya tell them who she is?  And, even if she didn't trust them, it's essentially because of her that the North now holds Harrenhal and they weren't tortured and killed by Lannisters... and yet they still treat her like a lowly cupbearer.

I'm not understanding that.

Also, why wouldn't Sansa leave with the Hound?  That's her chance to get the hell out of King's Landing.. he said he's going North.. he offered to take her with him... and yet she stays?  It can't be for Ser Dontos.. she finds him kind of repulsive and he's taking way too long.  I know she's afraid of Clegane, but he saved her from the citizens who were trying to hurt her, he's obviously strong enough to protect her, and she even sat there and waited for him to kiss her... so... why not go with him??",15,10,False,default,,,,,

The last 40-50% has made this one of the best fiction books that I have ever read.  Metrik messaged me to try to spoil everything about The Red Wedding and Joffrey's wedding, but I replied saying that I had already ""spoiled"" that for myself so the trolling was fruitless.  However, despite that I was unprepared for when and where.  Especially for the Red Wedding, the ""knowing"" made it worse.  I kept thinking that maybe, somehow it wouldn't happen in my copy XD.

On the other hand, there was so much that still surprised me **SPOILERS**

Also, I was completely surprised by the fight between Brienne and the bear, the transformation/growth of Jaime, the maiming of Jaime, the betrayal of Shae--that hurt, the realization about Tyrion's first wife, Arya and The Hound--I love Arya!, Jon Snow's increasing importance, and the battle between the Mountain that Rides and the Red Viper--the Viper's emotions were palpable. I can't praise this book enough.  If the third season is half as good, I'll absolutely buy the DVD set.
One question though: Tywin never intended to send Tyrion to the wall, correct?  The initial offer was to evoke a plea of guilty and behead him with minimal costs.  The second offer was just an attempt at self-preservation.  Is that the general consensus?"")",22,6,False,self,,,,,

First, when there is a bad character, that character is really bad. Comparing it to LOTR, you know that Sauron, Saruman are the bad guys, and Gollum is the only ""bad guy"" that you end up slightly feeling sorry for. However, Game of Thrones seems to have changed this.

I have a seriously irrational hatred for Joffrey, Cersei, Jamie, Littlefinger, and a couple others. I mean, they are written to be evil, and are seriously succeeding at that. I already heard the spoiler about Ned's fate, and that just makes me hate Joffrey even more. Does this hate ever go away?

Another thing I love is the strong female characters. Arya, Cersei, Catelyn, and Daenerys play huge roles, and they aren't the typical females of modern fiction, let alone their era. Even as a male, it makes the stories a lot more enjoyable to watch, knowing that they are more realistic.

Another note about the sex and gore in the movies. I understand that some of it is needed, such as the sex scenes with Daenerys showing her character development. I suppose the fight scenes with Robb and Tyrione also were enhanced by the violence there. However, it does seem a lot overdone. In the 6th episode, the scene where Littlefinger showing the prostitutes how to have sex seemed quite unnecessary and overly obscene. Furthermore, sometimes the blood gushing out of people's necks and heads is borderline comical.

Well, rant over, and hopefully I'll get to catch up to the rest of season 2 soon.

Does anyone with any crafting experience have any ideas on how to go about creating a replica? Would papier-mch and wireframe work? If I am able to pull it off, I will post pictures.

--------------

UPDATE: Thanks for all of the input everyone! I decided to go with wire mesh (hardware cloth) for the main band and aluminum foil for the antlers. Once the construction is complete, I'll use paper mache to build up the exterior. After that, I'll sand it, carve the grooves into it and then spray paint it gold.

Here's the current progress! http://imgur.com/hdlsg

Feedback welcome! I'll post the finished result as soon as it's done.

We have two theories, firstly:

Jon Snow is half Targaryen, Ned's sister Lyanna was raped by Rhagaer Targaryen. There is such a possibility that Jon Snow is half Targaryen and that Lyanna gave birth to Jon and Ned took him under as his bastard.

Second Theory: 

Jon Snow is the lord of light reincarnated. When Jon kills the whight to save Mormont, Longclaw was not burnt in the ashes of the tower. Jon Snow may have unintentionally brought Lightbringer back. What if Stannis isn't the Lord of Light reincarnated? Long Claw is Vaylrian Steel which fulfils the requirements of the prophecy to bring Lightbringer back. It could very well be that Jon Snow is Azor Ahai reborn and Stannis is not. Futhermore, why would Melisandre have such interest in him? In one section of the books he dreams he is somewhere cold with a red hot sword in his hand. And if truly Jon Snow is dead Melisandre can kill ghost to bring him back alive as all the Starks are bound to their Dire-wolves lives and a part of them lives inside.

[ASOS](/b ""Joffrey's death will be delicious"")

[ASOS](/b ""The scene I'm most looking forward to in ASOS is definitely Lysa's trip through the Moon Door"")

[AFFC](/b ""Petyr talks about Alayne's marriage"")

[AFFC](/b ""The Princess in the Tower. This is one of those scenes they'll either royally fuck up or make it into a perfect scene (like the Petyr/Varys dialogue in S1)"")

[AFFC](/b ""Cersei's emprisionment"")

[AFFC](/b ""I love you, I love you, I love you? NOPE, throw it in the fire"")

[AFFC](/b ""I'm Pate. Like the pig boy. A huge problem with this scene and also the prologue is how they'll portray how Jaqen was the alchemist and how he stole Pate's face."")

Even Ned himself doesn't say anything bad about him.

I don't know if this is addressed later in the series (if it is, I'd obviously prefer not to be spoiled), but I had a thought and figured I would post here to see what people have to say.

Basically I'm thinking that the crannogman in the story is Howland Reed, Meera and Jojen's father, and the she-wolf is Lyanna (named the queen of love and beauty, ""but that's a sadder story""). Then, presumably, her younger brother in the story is Ned. I'm guessing that the Knight of the Laughing Tree was not actually the crannogman, but Ned, which would explain why Jojen kept asking Bran if his father ever told him this story, and would also give a good explanation for Howland saving his life later on.

Now I'm getting the DTs after finishing season 2 and the thought of having to wait until March again is agonising so I'm contemplating picking the books up again.

There's a lot of mystery about her background that's not really there in the book, as if she's a lot more than she seems. I never really thought she truly loved Tyrion in the book, but in the show that final scene after the battle when he's in bed made me think she did, plus there was her relationship with Sansa, I mean she was willing to defend her during the battle scenes and was fairly accepting of the fact she could be killed soon. In the show she has this air of intelligence, danger, honour(for a whore) and cunning about her, in the book I never thought she was anything but a whore who hung around with Tyrion for his money.

Basically what I'm trying to say is, they way she has been portrayed in the show makes it pretty difficult for me to buy her upcoming betrayal, I even wonder if they'll go a different route with her completely, maybe have her die by someone else's hand in defense of Tyrion or not even kill her at all and have her journey across the sea with Tyrion(highly unlikely I know).

Anyone else got thought on this?

Obviously, a lot of people on this subreddit are going to be dressing up as characters from Game of Thrones, including myself. I'm currently working on a Khal Drogo costume, which consists of:

-Home-sewn pants (I cut the seams, pockets, and zipper off of a shitty second-hand pair of pants and re-laced them using a knife and some rough twine. Bought some extra fabric to sew onto the pant legs to make sure the final product is wide enough to wear.)

-Leather girdle (leather is expensive, so I bought a thin sheet of pleather and cut the segments of the girdle out in cardboard, which I will later wrap in the pleather and string together. I also bought some suede lace to help secure it.)

-Loin Cloth (going back to the store soon to buy some fake fur, will figure out how to fasten it to my waist later)

-Gauntlets (cheap leather or suede, dark brown, wrapped in suede lace)

-Wig (going to dye it dark brown and have a friend braid it. Also need to find gold ornaments to run through the braids.)

-Daggers (will make some later out of pine wood, if I have time.)

-Arakh (same as daggers; this part is the lowest priority part of the costume.)

-Beard (been growing mine out for three weeks; nearly at respectable length and scruffiness. Hopefully it'll be sufficiently Drogo-like by Halloween.)

No pics yet, but will post along with the hundreds of others likely to show up on Halloween. [The goal is to look like this] (http://zombat.roosteredge.com/2011/drogo/Khal_drogo3.jpeg) and not [this.](http://cdn.uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/cosplay-gameofthrones-khal-drogo-costume.jpg)

However, as a recent post mentioned, GRRM often describes Melisandre as wearing a ruby at her throat herself. Could it be a glimmer? And if yes, what does the Red Woman want to hide? While Tyrion is at the Temple of R'hllor in Volantis, he learns that the Red Priests buy slave children, and raise them as priests/warriors/whores. Is it possible that Mel was a slave of the Red Priests, but somehow learned their powers, and used them to mask her lowly beginnings? 

N.B. The chapter I'm referring to is Tyrion, page 415 (In the UK ADWD Part 1 Dreams and Dust): ""Flames had been tattooed across his cheeks and chin and shaven head to make a bright red mask....

I will fully agree that this scene had the potential for some incredibly bad ass television. I will also agree that without the scene, those viewers who have not read the books miss out on a lot of important back story. Also, just reading the masterfully written scene, it's impossible not to visualize it in your head.

However, I appreciate the fact that the television adaptation has avoided all flashbacks, especially when the books are so heavy on them. While flashbacks make excellent storytelling in the novels, it would ultimately become ponderous in the show. I also believe if you're going to allow one flashback, you would then need to allow many until we're looking at a show that resembles Lost, where half the narrative is told outside the main timeline. Given the complexity of this story, I feel like that would just get cumbersome with Game of Thrones.

That said, it's a crime that they didn't include a detailed telling of that scene in the DVD ""history and lore"" bonus material.

TL;DR: It's a shame that the Tower of Joy scene was cut from the show, but it was a necessary evil.",26,15,False,self,,,,,

Dany's conquer of Astapor


Arstan Whitebeard revealing his true identity.


Jon killing the wildlings and escaping to Castle Black


The Mountain killing Oberyn Martell in their fight 

Arya stabbing The Tickler to death



Stannis and his men coming to the aid of the Night's Watch


Tyrion shooting Tywin in the dick with a crossbow 


The fight between the Hound and Beric Dondarrion, and Beric coming back and the end


And of course: Zombie Catelyn

They don't like her, which is fine you don't have to like everyone, and they hate her character, which I don't think is fine. I feel that Sansa is unfairly judged by the viewer/reader because we have the bias of knowledge that she doesn't have. And because she starts out the series as an (11 in the books/14? in the show) year old girl. Now, her age really matters. People have criticized her for going to Cercei in season 1 and telling her Ned's plans. They have also just judged her for thinking everything is just like the stories of heroes that she loves. We judged her too soon because she had no idea about why things were happening the way they were, nor what would be the result of them. Some people may argue that because Arya is even younger, that Sansa's actions are therefore inexcusable. Remember that in this world, Arya is extremely atypical for a lord's daughter while Sansa fits the bill much more. Sansa is a normal lord's daughter so she acted the way most others would in her *exact* position. Well then everything turns to shit and she learns the consequences of her actions. Throughout season 2 and what will be seasons 3 and 4, she has gone is going to go through so much horrible stuff that, not only has she been punished enough for her mistakes, but she has learned and grown. When I reread AGOT after having finished the others, Sansa struck me as the most different from when I last ""saw"" her. She does make some rash decisions in ASOS but that is really just her being so desperate to escape the living her she is stuck in. She doesn't always have the most interesting chapters, but this intense hatred for her that I have seen just seems ridiculous and unfair.",47,19,False,self,,,,,

Hopefully it will happen.""

Well, it can happen!

Most agents obviously are aware of the show, but not necessarilly the different characters. By actually sending an email to them with some encouraging words and a list of characters the certain person would be great for, there's a bigger chance they will submit their client for those roles (or even the show itself!).

I've been contacting many agents myself and most of them reply with ""Thank you! We will consider these characters for X when the auditions start."" Most recently I contacted [Graham McTavish](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0574615/)' agent and he replied back and even asked me if I could write down some character McTavish would fit!

You're not bothering the agents, you're helping them.

Here's the best way to do it:

1. Go to [Spotlight](/www.spotlight.com) and search for the actor (UK based agents only. Use Google for other countries.)
2. Spotlight will show a contact email for the agency, but usually not the specific agent. Enter the agency site try to find the correct contact info (if not then just use the agency info email).
3. Send the agent an email and explain why you would like to see X in the show. A list of characters and a description of each of them is a big plus.

I understand how mad the Mad King was, but I still don't think that justifies offing his entire family, putting your own ass on the throne and calling yourself the new king.

Sansa is very often referred to as 'Little Dove'.

Bran starts dreaming about the 3-eyed Raven.

Jon is being referred to more and more as Crow...

and, in the chapter I'm up to in SoS, Arya referred to herself as Squab.

I haven't noticed any bird-like connections to Robb or Rickon yet... but I was laying awake last night racking my brain trying to think of any other characters referred to as birds, and I just can't think of any.  I wonder if there's any significance between the character and the type of bird they're connected to.

We then see that Mormont gets the letter pardoning him, figures out what it means, and arrives just in time to prevent what otherwise would have been a successful assassination. Presumably Varys either sent the order himself or at least was in a position to stop it, but did not.  I am assuming this is how it happened in the AGoT book, but don't recall. Now, in ADoD, we discover that Varys has been part of a long-running plot to restore the Targaryens to the Iron Throne. The question - what, exactly, was Varys' plan regarding this assassination of Daenerys? Relying on Mormont to react the way he did and avert the assassination seems like an awfully big leap of faith - even if Varys knew for a fact that he'd switched sides. So... what happened? Did Varys just figure that there was no way to avoid killing Dany, under the circumstances? Or is there something I am missing?"")",12,4,False,self,,,,,

(reasons against and for in post),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/11hxtb/do_think_hbo_will_continue_or_cancel_game_of/,ML_Notley,1350276499,"Ive recently had this discussion with friends and though this subreddit would like to put in their thoughts. I have heard that Season 4 is being planned already (interview saying they wanted to shoot season 3 and 4 back to back, but it wasnt possible).

Heres a general list of the reasons for both yes and no.

**YES:**

	Popularity: This show has reached a massive amount of viewers, both statistical (HBO subscribers) and not (piratebay, etc.) Its become a cultural phenomenon. To cancel would be a very serious decision that could cost HBO a lot of potential money from lost viewers. Ive talked to some people who have subscribed to HBO just to get Game of Thrones.

	Need to finish: This series will already have a determined conclusion. HBO wont be able to mash it down into one final season like they did with Rome. At this phase in the story, it will be completely impossible.

**NO:**

	Cost: This is the big speaker here. Money talks. Each episode costs around $6 million each, and sometimes more (pilot episode, battle episodes). This is a lot of money of per season, and costs were the main reason why big budget series like Rome are cancelled.

	Adaption difficulties: *A Feast for Crows* and *A Dance with Dragons* will be intertwined, as there will be no reason to leave popular characters out for a season (One of the reasons why *Feast* was derided upon on release). The problem is these books have a massive number of POVs (18 in *Dance*). While many are not important and add filler/world building, many are, and will contend for screen time with the major characters. Other characters would need to have sections stretched out for screen time (Arya Stark has only 5 chapters total in the two books). Creating the timeline will also be tough (it was hard enough for GRRM).

	The arrival times of the next books: Im no GRRuMbler (look it up). I think GRRM should take the time he needs to get a good book done. He has given a release year of 2014 for Winds of Winter, and he said he is going to try to hold to it, but things change. The show may get held up as Martin writes.

My decision: I think they will continue the series. The reasons not to are pretty significant, but I think at this phase in the series, HBO should continue, and see the situation after season 4. Again, like the story, events are always in motion.

I look forward to hearing what you have to say.

EDIT: Thanks for the feedback. Does anyone have statistics on how well the show is doing (viewers, profits, etc)?

I ask because I'm currently participating in the Doctor Who gift exchange and think a Game of Thrones directed one would be awesome!! 

With the Doctor Who exchange you put specifically which series you watched (old or new), your favorite Doctor, favorite companion (sidekick), and favorite villain.  Then you were aloud to fill up a text box with specifics.  

For ASOIAF we could follow the same guidelines, whether you watch the tv show, read the books, or both.  The house you like best, favorite character, etc. Then in specifics each individual could list where they are in the book series or television show so no spoiler gifts are sent! That space would also be used to say if there was a type of gift you would prefer (posters, video, etc.)

I think this would be a cool idea! Especially during the off season, it would give everyone something to look forward to!  

Again, if this has been brought up before please fill me in on what was said. Otherwise, I hope people might get on board with this and make it happen!! 

**tl;dr**: I think we should organize an ASOIAF gift exchange through Reddit Gifts! It could be something fun during the off season and give people something to look forward to relating to the show! ",38,64,False,self,,,,,

Then he would have known that Ned's bastard was in truth Rhaegar's.

So the last thing we read about Jon on the wall is that [ADWD](/b ""he is being betrayed by his black brothers. He's stabbed 3+ times, then the chapter ends. Now this is either a gruesome end to one of the favorite POV characters, or it's a major cliffhanger if he survives. Since TWOW is so far away, is there any leaked information about Jon's story arc, either from GRRM or elsewhere? I know he's not one of the confirmed POVs in book 6, but it would seem a cruel and somewhat pointless way to end Jon Snow's life.

Bran noted that he was fighting him less and less each time he slipped into him. So now Bran is occupying both bodies (something I think he is capable of seeing as how BR told Bran that he had the ability to be much more powerful than him). He didn't mean to push him out of his own mind, but he over used him. Now he has to pretend Hodor is still himself, or else everyone will find out what he did to him. No one must ever know.

So both TV series watchers and books series readers must be familiar with Jaqen H'ghar and Syrio Forell from AGOT and ACOK. [AFFC](/b ""not to mention what might be a second glimpse of Jaqen in AFFC when Pate meets up with an Alchemist who looks exactly like Jaqen after he changed face"")

So anyway when Ned was captured and the Lannisters sent the red cloaks to go for Arya and Syrio defended her, Ser Meryn said ""kill the Braavosi"", but neither in the books nor in the TV series appears Syrio's actual death -whereas GRRM never had problems displaying every other death in the series. 

Later, in ACOK, Arya meets Jaqen H 'ghar, who was recruited for the Night's Watch by Yoren, who picked him from the dungeons.

So here's my theory: what if Syrio was a Faceless Man in the past, but he eventually abandoned the House of White and Black. And that after he defended Arya Ser Meryn didn't kill him, but they locked him in the dungeons of the Red Keep -I wouldn't know to tell you why, maybe they thought he'd knew where Arya would go, in case Ned was unwilling to give his daughter's whereabouts, but I'll let you make your own speculations- and then, when Yoren came to recruit men for the Night's Watch, he saw a chance to escape and changed his face, thus becoming Jaqen H 'ghar. That would also explain why Jaqen recognized Arya at Harrenhal.

After his last chapter telling Sansa about his plans to marry him off to Harry the Heir, I got a little confused about his role. The entire series his character has been very selfish and only does things in interest of himself. Is there something I missed here? How does setting him up Sansa's marriage benefit him? If this is one of those things that will be explained in ADWD, I understand. I just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing anything.

Okay. Briennes dead?! Why? After her huge journey and reading so many chapters about her, it feels like her whole story was pointless. What did she accomplish throughout her journey? I enjoyed her character, but now it seems like her story added nothing to the whole picture. Why put so much effort into making her a character where I read her perspective every few chapters when the only useful thing she accomplished was taking Jamie to King's Landing? 

Last thing. At Sam's last chapter, the young blonde boy named Pate, or ""pig boy."" Who is he? I recognize the name, but I cant figure out who he is and where he came from.

Thanks for the help",28,0,False,self,,,,,

How come Bran, Rickon, Osha and Hodor didn't end up getting in contacting the army of Northerners that surrounded Winterfell? I mean, I assume that while Theon was in charge they and to keep hiding so that's understandable, but it just seems to me that the Northerners took Theon and scrammed oddly quickly! Wouldn't they have done a search of Winterfell after they got Theon and the Ironborn left to check for survivors? And since Pycell was still (somewhat) alive when that happened, wouldn't they have found him and he could've told them that the boys were still alive? I was quite sure when the Ironborn turned on Theon that the boys would be brought to Robb and Cat and was surprised when it turned out the way it did.

First off there's Aegon, I'm extremely curious about this character, and about what Varys and Illiryo plan to do with him. Sure, until now, they plan to crown him, but then again, almost all of their plans have gone asthray. So can we be sure that he'll be one of Dany's husbands? It wouldn't be the first time GRRM makes a giant twist in the plot line.

Then there's Brienne, last time we heard from her, Jaime met up with her and asked her if she had found Sansa. To that Brienne answered yes, but that they had to hurry, otherwise, The Hound will kill her. But in AFFC, Brienne discovered that The Hound was dead, and the man wearing his helmet was Biter. She also discovered that Arya had been in Saltspans. And she also met with the Brotherhood without banners, where she was commanded to kill Jaime by Lady Stoneheart. So what's the truth? Could she had gotten more information about Arya's whereabouts from the Brotherhood? Is Arya the girl she means in the answer to Jaime? Could she have discovered Sansa's whereabouts along with an attack toward the Erye? Or could our noble Brienne had gone to the Dark Side and is all a scheme to kill Jaime?

Other characters that weren't in ADWD but I'm curious about are the maesters of the Citadel. In the prologue, Pate meets with an alchemist that looks exactly like Jaqen H 'ghar after he changed his face, and later when Sam arrived, he met with a boy who claimed to be Pate. I know I'm not the first person to think that Jaqen took Pate's face after killing him. So do you think that Jaqen has a totally creepy and jaqen-ish plan? If so, could it be that it involves Dany as he seemed willing to help Sam with Maester Aemon's requests?And could it involve Arya too? Does he still plans to meet with her again? Does that mean that Arya and Dany are going to meet too? If so, how do you think will be their relationship?

I'm sorry if this was discussed before, maybe I didn't found it, but really, a person gets tired of searching and this seemed an easier way to get answers.",7,6,False,self,,,,,

A few theories I have read have been very interesting and I cannot wait to see how things play out. As it *currently* stands there will only be two more books titled ""The Winds of Winter"" and ""A Dream of Spring"". However, R.R.Martin was originally going to title the final book ""A Time For Wolves"". This, on a symbolic level that has been a constant theme throughout the series, suggests that the Starks, who are commonly or at least initially viewed as the protagonist family, will receive some kind of redemption for all the misfortune that has befallen on their house. I assume this is further supported by the fact that R.R.Martin changed the title so he does not give that away (or he could have completely changed the plot which would not surprise us). Anyways, I think it is safe to assume that on some level at least a few of our favourite characters have to start crossing paths for some grand finale. A Song of Ice and Fire suggests the whole battle between dragons and others, The Red God vs The Great Other, or a combination of Starks and Targs teaming up. Daenerys and her dragons are the most obvious choice to represent the 'Fire' part of the song but her prophecy involves two other people to join her. One popular theory is that Tyrion may be another of the heads (whether or not you want to believe he is actually targaryen is up to you, i do not).

I believe however that at least one of the heads will be Bran. He is already passed the wall where the battle with the others may be held, and the Three Eyed Crow (the last greenseer able to look into the future) states that he will never walk again, but he will *fly*. The Children of the Forest have battled the Others for eons so could the three-eyed-crow have been trying to get Bran to the north because he has seen Daenerys and her Dragons coming and needs Bran to help fight the war? Bran is working to improve his warging abilities and it is widely believed that he may become one of the most powerful warg alive. Dragons are extremely powerful magical creatures. Warging a Dragon would be unlike ANYTHING that ANY warg would ever dream of. There are also theories as to why there was no battle in the north during Aegon's conquest having something to do with the Targaryens actually fearing the Starks and their history of warging. Anyways, R.R.Martin does not work on a single level so I feel safe to assume A Song of Ice and Fire has more than one meaning. Bran teaming up with Daenerys would represent Fire and Ice working together, as well as Dragons (Fire) battling the others (Ice) for the fate of the world. I am not too sure who the other head might be, but Bran warging into a Dragon just feels  like it fits too well and would be SO BAD ASS. 

**TL;DR** Bran will be one of Daenerys' Three heads by warging a dragon, who do you think the other head will be? (or if you do not think it will be Bran, who are the other two?)",59,12,False,self,,,,,

___

* **do you know if Arstan Whitebeard and Strong Belwas will be in season 3?** Yes to the first, no to the second.""

* **why didnt they stick to the book in season 2 ?** Various reasons. Some story-related, some time and budget related.

* **Will they stick to the book in season 3?** It will prob be more of the same. Maybe a little closer since they have more time.

* **do you except [sic] them to do the whole arstan whitebeard plot?** I don't think so. I think he will just reveal himself right away.

A follow up to this one: **But doesnt Arstan revealing himself early mean the betrayal of a certain character also gets revealed much earlier than it should** They may have to rewrite the scenario around that betrayal and when/how it is revealed.

* **do you know if Talisa will be present at RW - will they change how it is in the books or leave her out of it?** She'll be there.

* **Is there going to be more Sam? I want more Sam.** We should get a decent amount of Sam this season.

* **What's the word on Roose Bolton this year? He taking Harrenhal/attending a wedding still?** Thinking no to the 1st, yes to 2nd

* **will we watch the RW in season 3 ?** Yes. It will be in episode nine of season three.

* **Prologue chapter in?** No. It is likely cut, given the way S2 ended.

* **Will Beric Dondarrion resurrect Catelyn this season or next?** Too spoilery to retweet, but I think we will see it this season. I think it will be the final scene of season three.

* **any idea who is playing Strong Belwas?** Nobody. He hasn't been cast. There's a chance he may show up in a later season.

* **what CGI scenes should we be looking forward to in season 3?**  Don't want to spoil things too much... I'll just say ""Dracarys""

* **Do you think the #9 episode will hit the ratings negatively in a big way?** Don't think so. Will likely equal even more buzz.

* **Have the sand snakes been cast yet?** No, not yet. Probably won't see them until season four or five.

* **Do you think Roose Bolton will play as big a part in everything as he does in the books?** Maybe not as big, but he'll be around

* **Will Ep.10 be an 'introductory' chapter for S3, as happened in S1 and S2, or can we expect major cliffhangers?** The former.

* **Do you think we'll get more Jaime this season?  S2 was sadly lacking.** Yes, we should get a lot more Jaime this season.

* **Will most of the Wildling characters (Styr, Jarl, Varamyr) be cut from the show?** Cut or combined into Orell.

* **Are we going to see the bastard torturing Reek?** There will be some torture scenes, yes.

* **How soon into S3 will the painful Jaime scene happen?** Not sure exactly. Guessing ep 5 or 6?

* **Do you think we will see the Bloody Mummers/Vargo?** Sort of. The Vargo character has been changed and renamed to 'Locke'

* **Do you think they'll change up Ramsay Bolton at all?** We'll see lots of new scenes.The character will remain the same tho.

* **Do you think they'll show Jon's story past The Red Wedding?** Possibly. They have some flexibility there. 

* **will we be seeing Jon and Ygritte together?** Yes.

* **Will we get to see the Dreadfort?** Seems likely. They have to hold ""Reek"" somewhere.

* **Will we see the Clegane/Dondarrion trial by combat?** Almost certainly. It is too epic a scene not to show it.

* **will Jamie be getting ""something golden"" in this season?** His receiving ""something golden"" will probably happen in S4.

* **Do you think they will move any of the Iron Island parts to season 3 or 4 or will we have to wait until season 5 or 6 for more?** I think we'll see some Iron Islands stuff in S4. They can't keep Yara on the sidelines for too long.

* **Will we get all of Arya and the Hound's road trip, including the fight at Hollow Hill?** Don't know if we will get all of their trip, but the major stuff, like the fight and arrival at the Twins are in.

* **Will there be more or less battle scenes in season 3 than in the other 2?** Less. There'll be no shortage of action tho.

* **Di you think they are really going to show the wolf king after ep 9? It's only ever indirectly recounted in the book, save from hotu** Based on reports from the set, it sounds like they will show it directly.

* **Do you expect the Queenscrown stuff to be included, with the 2 story arcs (almost) crossing?** Yes.

* **What do we expect Ep 10 to be? Another Wedding?** Some people are predicting that, but I don't think it will happen this season.

* **Will Beric Dondarrion be a major character?** Define ""major"". He will definitely be in S3, prob appearing in 2 or 3 eps

* **I know that Anguy was cast. What about others like Lem Lemoncloak or Tom Sevenstring?** No. They'll be featured extras, at best.

* **Do you think we will see this time the whole Riverrun fortress/castle?** Yes.

* **YO @WiCnet when're we gonna get some Martells up in this shit? #WaterGardensWhaWha** Season four. 

* **Will we get to learn any High Valyrian this season? Valar Morghulis, just so.** Yes, @dedalvs is creating Valyrian for S3.

* **which storyline will catch up with grrm first, and when?** I'm guessing Bran's. By the end of S4, potentially.

* **Any idea where Jojen and Meera meet Bran? Location wise I mean.** Doubt it will be a specific location. Just somewhere on the road north.

* **When do you think HBO will release clips, trailers, etc.?** First teaser should air prior to the Boardwalk Empire finale.

* **How do you think they will handle Hoster? Already dead?** Yeah, probably.

* **How much of Theon will we see this season? Any word on a storyline?** Apparently he will be in 6 eps. Not sure what they will have him doing all that time.

* **Is Jon's story most likely to end with him returning to the wall? And/or being confronted by Alliser/Janos?** Returning to the Wall for sure. Don't know how much more they will show this season."")",131,151,False,self,,,,,

I just finished the chapter where [ASOS](/b ""Jaime and Brienne get taken by the Bloody Mummers.  I don't know if they rape Brienne or not; that's not really the point"").  It's not that rape occurs often in the books, but it's the constant *threat* of rape, for any female character who's ever in danger.

I've been wondering exactly what bothers me about it, and really I think it comes down to lack of creativity.  Can't the author think of some other danger for these women to be in?  Can't he create some other obstacle for women to overcome?  I mean honestly, [ASOS](/b ""if the Bloody Mummers are that savage, why is rape never a threat for Jaime?"")  Anytime women are outnumbered by men, or off on their own, or in a dangerous situation, my first thought is, ""okay, who's going to get raped?""  It just gets a little ... predictable after a while.  Not to mention what it says about women.   It's left me wondering if a woman's going to get raped by a dragon in the next book.

I get it.  Rape is a real threat that women face.  But as others have pointed out, this is a *fantasy* series.  Dragons aren't real.  Be a little more creative with the threats.  You don't have to eliminate rape, but does it have to be the go-to danger confronting women in this series?  I'm starting to think that with a few exceptions, women in this story are just walking vaginas, to be filled either forcibly or ""consensually"" when their fathers decide who's going to fill them.",6,0,False,self,,,,,

Now for my reasoning

[ASOS](/b ""This idea came to me after reading the story that Meera tells Bran about the tournament at Harrenhal and how Meera was so surprised that Ned had never told Bran that story. It's odd that even though Ned and Howland were so close that he almost never spoke of him, unless he doesn't want he his kids near Howland because he knows something (that John is Lyanna's bastard since he was the only person aside from Ned to survive the tower of Joy). Also Ned never talks about John's mother why? 1.because he promised and he would rather people think that he forsaken his marriage vows then break a promise to his dead sister. 2. Because of Robert, Robert hated all the Targaryens wanted them all dead even though they were no threat to him, think what he would have done if he had known that Rhaegar had had a son with Lyanna. Also Think about the Ned's character when given the choice to tell Robert the truth about ""his"" children and Cersei he chooses to tell Cersei instead to protect the children even though this is extremely dangerous."")",2,0,False,default,,,,,

Jaime was supposed to be his shield, without a personal opinion, and he abandoned that task already when he went to kill Lord Rossart, who was carrying the message to the spoiler above.

I'm assuming that means he's going to be in every episode, making the Red Wedding the final episode. If this is true, then Arya getting hit by the axe, would be a huge cliffhanger for the end of the season, but unrealistic for keeping viewers around for Season 4. My theory is that they should have that happen close to the end, but do another scene in the North or King's Landing, and then have the following/closing scene be this:

 Arya's wolf dream where she is Nymeria and pulls Catelyn out of the water. After she pulls her out and recognizes her, she turns around and starts growling but stops and begrudingly walks away., the camera stays on Cat's dead body, before slowly panning up to show Beric and Thoros standing over her and then cut to Greg Spence. Since Nymeria is actually Arya, who has met Beric and Thoros she is willing to leave the body to them. Show watchers will know that Thoros has revived Beric several times, and the ending would hint at the revival of Cat but will save her actual appearance for the end of Season 4. Also, an Arya wolf dream would hint that she is still alive but leave many watchers questioning until the next season. Just my thoughts and I wanted to share!",41,8,False,self,,,,,

If you weren't aware already, some fantastic fans have created a mod for Crusader Kings II based on A Game of Thrones (and subsequent books). The main game was recently updated and the mod is currently unusable with the most updated patch, but they're nearly finished with their updates to the mod and it's supposed to be released ""soon"".

It seems that they've added a new scenario, Aegon's War of Conquest, where you play as Aegon I (complete with Dragons!) and unite the 7 kingdoms under your rule.

You can find more information on this update (and the mod itself) [here](http://citadel.prophpbb.com/topic1626.html)

I know I included scope in the title, but if you don't want to be spoiled for Season 3, don't read this post)

So I was re-watching Season 2 recently and I noticed something interesting about some of the scenes featuring Talisa and Robb.  I know that sounds impossible, but bear with me.  I've grabbed three clips from youtube featuring the couple.  Notice what all three clips have in common:

[Clip #1] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP_M3FcWESM)
[Clip #2] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dXRoeCdTxs)
[Clip #3] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDmOO0Hy5c0)

The common element: Roose Bolton.  It's funny how they managed to sneak him into the mix in many of the more romantic scenes between Robb and Talisa.  These scenes provide a nice visual connection for the two main reasons for Robb's downfall: his breaking of the  Frey marriage contract and the betrayal by the Boltons.  Foreshadowing is one of GRRM's favorite literary techniques.  Good job, D&amp;D, for keeping the spirit of the books by using subtle visual cues to hint at what is to come in the series.

Obviously to write something like this GRRM can't just start typing away, winging it as he goes.  Any links to discussions on how he's put this together?  Does he draw up charts with timelines and links of people to each other? Did he have the whole overall outline completed prior to starting the first book including how it's going to end?  IMO he must have had the overall structure conceptualized at the start, at least at some level, otherwise how can he foreshadow, e.g. [ALL](/b ""Jon Snow parents"")?

In addition, this led to me rewatching several Talisa scenes from season two and wondering what they'll do about the later intrigue surrounding Jeyne Westerling without the character replacing her being a noble from a Westerosi house.

The idea that ""Talisa"" is in fact an alias for a character introduced in the books is not exactly new.  For a large part of season 2, there were many people speculating that Talisa was, in fact, Jeyne Westerling in disguise, which seems to have proven to not be true.

So what evidence is there that Talisa really is Nymeria?

Nymeria Sand is one of Oberyn Martell's bastard daughters, one noted for her beauty and skill with a dagger.  With the exception of lacking a widow's peak on her forehead, the actress chosen to play Talisa fits Nymeria's physical description rather well: she has straight black hair, high cheekbones, dark eyes, and a slender build.  Nymeria is also said to be good with blades, which could be equally useful in a medical setting as in one of combat.

One very big detail worth noting, however, is that Nymeria's mother...is a noblewoman of Old Volantis.  The same city Talisa claims to be from.  Maegyr is also the name of Malaquo Maegyr, one of the rulers of Volantis.

**tl;dr:**  **I think Talisa Maegyr may actually be Nymeria Sand.**",10,0,True,nsfw,,,,,

Well. I did. I started reading the books and Holy Crap. After commenting and hating on Jeoff for being a general douche-cock, I fell in love with House Bolton. Roose and Ramsay both. And now with my christmas bonus, I'm going to show these northern lords my love.

I went online to find a picture of the sigil to start working with and now I see that the show version of GoT has the skinned man crucified upside down as opposed to the book version just having a skinless man.

GOT is no exception so I've gathered a group of interesting names that could hint to further development...

Sandor - Defender of Mankind (hungarian name)
Arya - Noble/great/truthful (Indian name)
Sansa - charm/praise
Brandon - um...""hill covered with broom""/""from the beacon hill""
Tyrion - kind of complicated but it boils down to ""Land of Eoghan"", Eoghan meaning (in celtic) born of the yew and (in ancient greek) well born, noble (interesting, since he considers himself a bastard in his father's eyes)
Robbert - ""bright with glory""
Jamie - ""supplanter"" (to undermine, replace)

and i'll stop there...for now.

She believes that Ser Jorah was her betrayal for love, but I think she is mistaken. I think she is going to be betrayed by Barristan Selmy for love, but it takes a lot of speculation to get there. The following consists of a lot of speculation spanning events over all five books.

I have never been comfortable with the ""death"" of Ashara Dayne and with the legitimacy of Aegon Targaryen. We know that Ashara Dayne was a handmaid to Elia Martell and frequently at court with her. We know that Brendan Stark danced with Ashara and that he was quite the ladies man. We know that she was dishonored at Harrenhall and turned to a Stark for comfort. We know that Selmy deeply cared for Ashara and views it as the greatest tragedy of his life that he could not help her. We know that Aerys attended the Harrenhall tourney at the suggestion by Varys that Rhaegar was organizing all the great lords to oppose his father. We know that Elia and Ashara both gave birth at roughly the same time. We know that Elia was very weak and got worse with each child birth. We know that Aerys had Brendan Stark arrested and killed him and his father. We know that Ashara Dayne was a very beautiful woman. We know that Septa Lemore is a very attractive older woman who has stretch marks from child birth.

I think Aerys was the man who impregnated Ashara. It is implied that Selmy knows ""the man"" that dishonored Ashara, but as Aerys' Kingsguard, he was powerless to defend her honor. I think Ashara turned to Brendan Stark for help, which made the already paranoid Aerys even more skeptical. I think Varys encouraged Aerys paranoia to further destabilize the realm. I think that Elia had a stillbirth and Ashara gave birth to a healthy son. I think they switched the children and were the only two people in the world that know the switch was made. I think that Ashara Dayne and Aerys are the parents of ""Aegon.""

Where this obviously gets juicy is when Barristan Selmy comes into contact with Septa Lemore. Selmy, realizing the woman he has pined for is alive, will be exceedingly anxious to atone for ""the greatest regret of his life."" Barristan the Bold is going to betray Daenerys for love, for his love of Ashara Dayne.",0,1,False,default,,,,,

She constantly struggles with trust issues with everyone except Barristan Selmy. She believes that Ser Jorah was her betrayal for love, but I think she is mistaken. I think she is going to be betrayed by Barristan Selmy for love, but it takes a lot of connecting the dots and assumptions to get there. First, lets review what we think we know thus far.

I have never been comfortable with the ""death"" of Ashara Dayne and with the legitimacy of Aegon Targaryen. We know that Ashara Dayne was a handmaid to Elia Martell at court with her. We know that she was dishonored at Harrenhal and turned to a Stark for comfort. We know that Selmy deeply cared for Ashara and views it as the greatest failure of his life that he could not help her. We know that Aerys attended the Harrenhal tourney at the suggestion by Varys that Rhaegar was organizing all the great lords to oppose his father (ADWD, Selmy). We know that Elia and Ashara both gave birth at roughly the same time. We know that the accepted thought was that Ashara had a stillbirth (ADWD, Selmy). We know that Elia was very weak and got worse with each child birth. (ADWD, Jon Connington) We know that Ashara Dayne was a very beautiful woman. We know that Septa Lemore is a very attractive older woman who has stretch marks from child birth (ADWD, Tyrion).

I think Aerys raped and impregnated Ashara. As Aerys' Kingsguard, he was sworn to protect and keep the Kings secrets. It is implied that Selmy knows ""the man"" that dishonored Ashara, but seems hesitant to say the name of who it was, even to himself. I think Ashara turned to Ned Stark for help. I think Ned was willing to marry Ashara and claim the child as his own to protect her honor. However, once Brandon was dead, Ned had to marry Catelyn instead. I think that Elia had a stillbirth and Ashara gave birth to a healthy son. Seeing no good path for Asharas son and Elia being unable to have additional children of her own, I think they switched the children and only the two of them and know that the switch was made. 

Varys might know of the switch, but I dont think Varys would want to replace Aerys with a bastard of Aerys, so I think this is one of the few secrets in the world that he doesnt know. I think prior to Elia and her children being slaughtered by the Mountain, Varys switched out Aegon and sent him away with Ashara. In order to maintain the legitimacy of Aegon, Ashara had to disappear and become the Septa that is instructing Aegon. The point can be raised that purple eyes are a very distinctive feature and Tyrion should have noticed that if Septa Lemore is Ashara. When we are introduced to characters, we are generally given a description of their features, including eye and hair color. However, Tyrion never comments on her eyes, perhaps never noticing them. He notes that Like everyone else aboard the Shy Maid, she had her secrets. She was welcome to them. I do not want to know her, I only want to fuck her. (ADWD, Tyrion)

Where this obviously gets juicy is when Barristan Selmy comes into contact with Septa Lemore. Selmy, realizing the woman he has pined for is alive, will be exceedingly anxious to atone for ""the greatest regret of his life."" Since Aegon and Dany will eventually come into conflict over their claims as rightful ruler of Westeros, Selmy will be forced with a choice of which Targaryen to help. When the queen [Dany] looked at him, he felt as if he were looking at Asharas daughter. (ADWD, Selmy) What will Selmy do when he comes in contact with Ashara and her actual child? I think Barristan the Bold is going to betray Daenerys for love, for his love of Ashara Dayne. Thoughts?

TL; DR: Barristan will betray Dany to help Aegon, the illegitimate rape baby of Aerys and Ashara

Specifically, it was when Jon recalled advice that his father gave him--you can love your men, but you can't be their friend.  And then I wept.  I think part of it was because he was such a good man, the fate was beneath him.  He should have died leading his men in battle or of old age with his Lady, children, and grandchildren around him.  Not at the command of some little punk.  I also cried because, of all the characters, I identify most with him.  I'm not crafty like Littlefinger, clever like Tyrion, nor a superb fighter like Jaime.  What I am is honest and strive to do the right thing all the time.  Doesn't always work out, but I try.  I also put more faith in others and trust them to value honor as much as I do--another terrible mistake often times.

Im more than 1/4 through AFFC and not even a single Daenerys, Tyrion or Jon chapter (granted Jon was featured in Samwell's chapter). 

Now it's not that I'm impatient or I feel their stories are more important (I actually like the story unfolding in Dorne and the Iron Islands). I'm just wondering if the emphasis on the characters mentioned so far (Cersei, Jaime, Brienne, Sansa, Arya, Samwell + new narratives from Asha, Damphair, Doran's Captain of Guards).

That just seems like too many story lines already without any mention of the other 3 (4 if you include Davos). 

Should I just shut up and keep reading or will the emphasis on other characters be pushed forward to ADWD which I'm definitely cool with knowing. 

Just no ADWD spoilers. I'm 250 pages into AFFC and so far the best dialogue was Kevan Lannister owning Cersei like 3 times when she asks him to be Hand to Tommen.",13,3,False,self,,,,,
