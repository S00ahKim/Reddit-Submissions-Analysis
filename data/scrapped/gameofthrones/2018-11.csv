Hi,

So I am re-watching the show, super great! Anyway, I am currently watching Season 5 Episode 5.

Stannis Baratheon and Sam Tarly are talking and Sam reveals he used Dragonglass to kill the White Walker. Stannis replies saying something like 'yea we have a bunch of it at Dragonstone'

Why does it take 2 Seasons and Sam going to Citadel to be a Maester. He already knows it kills them, and he now knows where to get it. Does he need some sort of Validation that dragonglass kills them? He stabbed one in the shoulder and he froze solid and shattered. What more does he need? Am I missing some crucial detail here?",5,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

**""Season 8 opens at Winterfell with an episode that contains plenty of callbacks to the shows pilot. Instead of King Roberts procession arriving, its Daenerys and her army. What follows is a thrilling and tense intermingling of characters  some of whom have never previously met, many who have messy histories  as they all prepare to face the inevitable invasion of the Army of the Dead.""**  
  
Jon + Arya reunion confirmed?  
  

  
**""I dont know anything about the final seasons storyline. I look around at a meticulously constructed set that Ive never seen on the show before. Several actors are performing, and Im stunned: There are characters in the finale that I did not expect. I gradually begin to piece together what has happened in Westeros over the previous five episodes and try not to look like Im freaking out""**  
  
What characters in alive in the finale would **really** me that kind of surprise?  
  
**""How these fan favorites get along drives much of the drama this season (okay, heres one specific tease from the premiere  Sansa isnt thrilled that Jon bent the knee to his fancy new Targaryen girlfriend, at least not at first).""**  
  
Sansa vs Dany, can't wait!  
  
**The drama builds to a confrontation with the Army of the Dead thats expected to be the most sustained action sequence ever made for television or film. One episode  the same that Benioff and Weiss were concerned about pulling off so many years ago  is wall-to-wall action, courtesy of Battle of the Bastards director Miguel Sapochnik.**  
  
wall-to-wall action and Miguel? Perfect!  
  
**Last April a crew member revealed that Game of Thrones had wrapped 55 night shoots while filming a battle. Media outlets around the world ran stories saying the final seasons battle took twice as long as the 25-day shoot for season 6s climactic Battle of the Bastards. This wildly understated what really happened. The 55 nights were only for the battles outdoor scenes at the Winterfell set. Filming then moved into the studio, where Sapochnik continued shooting the same battle for weeks after that.**  
  
Holy shit! That would be epic!

Now keep in mind, Im still reading the books  but most of the this is coming from stuff Ive picked up watching the Youtubers. 

So please hang in there.

What if the children of the forest have been manipulating the situation the entire time? Not because they as a species have tried to correct a terrible mistake in creating the white walkers but instead just needed to wait long enough until the realm of men was weak enough to strike? Being that leaf and the other children of the forest that we have seen are all the very same as the ones we saw in the flashbacks thousands of years prior, wouldnt they be the direct families of the ones slaughtered by man in the first place? And this show is all about family and going through whatever means necessary to protect, preserve, and avenge if necessary. 

Now in the books they say the children can live on through the weirwood trees. Is is possible they have been manipulating the visions or power that greenseers have by manipulating the weirwood trees? Now as far as the night king goes, he has a lot of potential backstory and much of which is believed to be about his loss of a loved one. Now is it possible that he was lured by the children of the forest vicariously through this love of his so that they could capture a man of particular bloodlines so that they might use their magic to create a monster who would be able to use military tactic like man, against them? A sort of fight fire with fire. 

The men rise up and oppose the night king during the long night and the children of the forest help the men after the he is defeated. This is not because they regret what they have done. They actually need more time to allow the night king to replenish his armies. To do this, they put a wall between the men and his army so that they can be building the white walker army without them finding out. They attack the wildlings left beyond the wall at a rate where they can keep getting additions but not wiping out their resource. The children of the forest have blood raven, and with this they are able to keep a watchful eye on the outside world and over men however not influence it.  Now whos to say they havent been luring bran to the cave so that they might get a more powerful 3 eyed raven who might be able to reach man better than blood raven? A sharper tool kind of thing? All in the name of wiping out man for what they did to their families? These arent the distant relatives of those slaughtered, they are the direct families. 

I was feeling very tinfoily, when I first thought this but then I remembered what this show is all about and what people will do to protect, preserve and avenge if necessary. It seems that they created the ultimate threat, and they lost, why would their motivation change after all that time. Why stay with the 3 eyed raven and watch over? Not over regret in my opinion. The night king didnt seem to be destroying weirwood trees. There are multiple up beyond the wall. Winter is not an issue for them as they live in a land of always winter. And why is all of a sudden all the magic from the children of the forest failing now? I believe that it is because they want to strike. Idk tell me what you think, whether its full of holes or whether you think Im crazy enough to be onto something?

I just imagine that it would've made Stannis look like a joke if Tyrion Lannister, the ""Imp"", the lowest of the Lannisters was credited for destroying his entire fleet and defending the city.

Would it not make the Lannisters gain even more fear if the lowest of them could destroy an entire fleet with a single command?

I'm going to assume the answer is the question I wrote in the first line. Tywin probably didn't care enough about Tyrion to put thought into it. But surely Tywin, as great as a man as he was, would've thought of something like that, right?",10,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Also Sansa is meant to have become a great player of the Game, Robb is a brilliant commander, Ned has the full allegiance of his country, and Rickon can run in straight lines pretty well. However, Bran Arya and Sansa wouldnt have developed their talents if they stayed together.

The Lannisters ostensibly hold all the wealth of Westeros (though we know thats a lie), have the brains and brawn. Also Tywin and Tyrion presumably would have held Joff in check

I actually want to say the Baratheons though. They own the line of succession, and Stannis owns the knowledge and truth of the Lannisters' lies. With Renly as the charismatic face, Stannis the steely eyed realist Hand, Robert the fearsome commander, and he support of the Reach, no chance the Lannisters keep the throne for long if at all

My dark horse would be the Tyrells. Margaery can seduce her way to the throne in any environment, Olenna is Olenna, and Loras is a great warrior. They also effectively control Westeros through food stores, and inspire the love of the common people",7,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

In the books, we have Young Griff... the child that was taken from his mother Elia Martell's breast and whisked away into exile right before she was murdered by Ser Gregor Clegane during the sack of King's Landing. Fast forward to the current book timeline, and we are left with the notion that Griff is really Aegon Targaryen.

This is a red haring. This is (PROBABLY) a Blackfyre plot. This is Varys' ultimate demise IN THE BOOKS. (Why Dany will burn him alive IN THE BOOKS).

Now, we still want our secret Targaryen(s). Jon Snow is a shoe in, but who else might you ask? Well I have your answer!

JAIME AND CERSI TARGARYEN


Just flip the Joanna Lannister script on it's axis: Joanna had bastard Targs in Jaime and Cersi with Mad King Aerys. I draw this conclusion using the foreshadowing from a scene in Season 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFk2t3E2aWE#t=4m15s

""Every time a new Targaryen is born"", King Jaehaerys said, ""the gods toss the coin in the air and the world holds its breath to see how it will land""

Cersi has ""Mad Queen"" vibes all throughout season 7 because she has been acting like a Targaryen this whole time. Her biggest give away is her obsession with Wildfire. In contrast, the coin flipped the right way for Jaime Targaryen.

So now let's make some baby Targs! Enter Joffrey and Tommen... more golden heads!!! The show tries so hard to get the viewer to chalk this up to incest. Well, who else believed in incest to keep the blood lines pure... hmmmmm.... Obviously, we see how the coin flip went for these two Targaryen offspring!


That's where I'm at! Would love to hear your thoughts and rebuttals! CHEERS TO SEASON 8!! WINTER IS HERE!!!!

Very luckily the children of the forest come to save him from fully turning.

The main questions this raises for me:

1. Why did they stab *Benjen* with dragonglass? And left him to become a walker. Why no one else?

2. Instead of making the deal with Craster, why didn't they just go around stabbing men with daggers instead of killing them? + using the babies to create new walkers.
 

3. Why did they kill Waymar Royce in the prologue rather than stab him with dragonglass to transform him into a walk?

4. Why were the Children of the forest watching Benjen intently enough to save him? Why didn't they let him become a walker?

5. Is there something special about the Starks that make them able to successfully transform from human to White Walker?

6. On the show we also see the children transform a man into a white walker, the same way Benjen's ritual was performed.

7. Do you believe this is blatant foreshadowing of another Stark, or persons with Stark blood becoming a White Walker through this transformation process?

8. If the answer to 7 is yes, do you also believe the man the children of the forest plunged the dragon dagger into was a Stark or an Ancestor of House Stark?",2,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

He is very emotional because Cercei will directly be responsible for Arya's death which The hound will witness. Oh and By the way. Littlefinger is a warlock and that was a duplicate that died. He already married sansa and that was the marriage that bran was talking about how beautiful she was in her dress.

I really hope this final season is amazing and I know it will be intense. Its crazy how its ending in a couple months.. I wonder how Ill feel after its over. I said a couple months back that what to do after the show is over is to remember it and cherish it and re watch is every couple years.

&amp;#x200B;

So I was talking with my roommate whom just finished season 7, and we were going over some theories about the visions Bran and Danny have. And right after that we converted to the entire Hodor-fuckup by Bran. Then it struck me. 

Recall the vision of Bran about the Mad King (this one: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qsQUroPq3g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qsQUroPq3g) )

It is widely accepted this vision is in reversed chronological order. So the true order of events is reversed from the vision. In the vision they scream ""Burn them all"" twice. The first time you see it it is the Mad King himself on the iron throne, it is very clear to hear. The second time however, it is less clear. The voice is also different and there is a popular theory that that voice is that of the three eyed raven (Brandon Rivers). But then i went back, and listened very carefully, what if the second time you hear them scream they don't actually say ""burn them all"" but they shout ""burn the wall""?

It is often said the Mad King went mad because of the voices in his head. What if that was actually the three eyed raven having the same kind of fuckup with the Mad King as Bran had with Hodor?

I'm not enough in the material to oversee all the implications this might have. Or some very clear point why this cannot be the case. But google gave me 0 results on this theory, so I figured to just throw it out there. What do you guys think?",1,1,True,nsfw,,,,,

Recall the vision of Bran about the Mad King (this one: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qsQUroPq3g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qsQUroPq3g) )

It is widely accepted this vision is in reversed chronological order. So the true order of events is reversed from the vision. In the vision they scream ""Burn them all"" twice. The first time you see it it is the Mad King himself on the iron throne, it is very clear to hear. The second time however, it is less clear. The voice is also different and there is a popular theory that that voice is that of the three eyed raven (Brandon Rivers). But then i went back, and listened very carefully, what if the second time you hear them scream they don't actually say ""burn them all"" but they shout ""burn the wall""?

It is often said the Mad King went mad because of the voices in his head. What if that was actually the three eyed raven having the same kind of fuckup with the Mad King as Bran had with Hodor?

I'm not enough in the material to oversee all the implications this might have. Or some very clear point why this cannot be the case. But google gave me 0 results on this theory, so I figured to just throw it out there. What do you guys think?",32,1,True,nsfw,,,,,

Thanks.

What if... 

Waymar Royce was right.  What if it was some other wildlings that dismembered the small group Will found in the Haunted Forest? What if it wasnt the White Walkers?

In particular, I offer into evidence the Thenns. They are believed to be the most culturally and socially advanced with laws, titles, and knowledge of metallurgy.  They have bronze axes able to cut apart their foes. We know they are cannibals and  dismember their victims to eat them.  They speak the Old Tongue and are supposed to be the most closely related to the First Men from which they are descended. 

We have never seen the WW dismember any people.  It would defeat the point of being able to resurrect them if you shred them to pieces.  I also dont think they have any need to make symbols out of body parts.  On the flip side I could definitely see a group like the Thenns (or other freefolk) being superstitious enough to arrange strange symbols with their victims as a sort of religious sacrifice to the Old Gods (which may include the WW).

If you watch the sequence with the idea that someone else killed those wildlings and that the symbol sort of calls the WW there it makes more sense. They arrange the dismembered parts as a sort of calling card and impaled a young girl to a tree as tribute.  Assuming that the WW will arrive and accept the dead girl that they can resurrect.  

Unfortunately, Waymar and Gerad transverse the hallowed ground of the symbol on the ground because it is covered in snow and they cannot see it.  I believe this is the reason they are beheaded and Will isnt.  Will did not violate the sacred symbol.  They have no ready or desire to kill him. They raise the dead girl and go about their business.

The WW do not attack first if you look at it from this angle.  They only take out the two men who violated the sacred symbol created by whomever really did kill the WW.  Like enforcing a law against desecration.  Very similar to the way capital punishment is enforced by Ned and on Ned. 

Need more proof?

Think of all the WW appearances in the show...

2) at Crasters the WW take the baby and and cradle him all the way home and the NK turns the baby. But they treat the baby gently and like a special sacred gift.  The WW dont try to hurt Jon or Craster or his wives.  They only come for the sons.

3) at the FOTFM we see the AOTD for the first time. The WW are marching their army and we know the NW are camped at the Fist.  It appears that the WW are advancing to attack the NW. But that may be a false assumption.  Sam hide next to a boulder and sees a WW fairly close up.  They dont kill him though.  Maybe they dont see him or maybe they just dont care.

They dont wipe out the NW, but they do kill the majority I believe.   Why dont they kill them all?  They are certainly capable of it. I have 3 possible answers:
- The WW only fight the NW because the NW attacks first and the AOTD is just trying to rally to some point beyond the Fist and they kill as many as they have to until the NW retreats and the AOTD can progress in their way.

Or 
- We later discover a symbolic spiral of dead horses when Jon and Mance and their group come across the vacated NW camp at the Fist.  Perhaps this spiral is old and sacred.  Perhaps it was already there, buried in snow.  When the NW arrives and desecrates this symbol on land that is possibly sacred to the WW... they show up to enforce the law.

Or 
- perhaps the horses are new but the FOTFM is sacred ground already to the WW and they show up to punish those who would desecrate this sacred location. 

Point of this is that if the WW were there just to kill everyone and build their army then they were certainly capable of that and would have if that had been their intention.

4) Next we see one come to take Gillys baby.  As the WW approaches to take the baby he doesnt try to kill Sam.  He just pushes Sam out of the way.  He wouldnt kill Sam or Gilly.  The WW is only coming to claim the baby that was promised.  Sam desiring to protect Gilly and her baby stabs the WW in the back with Dragonglass and he shatters.

5) This is where the trouble starts. Hardhome.
The next time we see the WW they are now dressed in armor ready for war.  Crasters last son was denied them (pact broken!) The NK has come out of his Ice palace to lead his troops and they send their dead to attack Hardhome.  

I think they attack HH because they know Jon and the NW are there.  They are officially an army now and at war.  I believe that is due to their access to heirs being cut off.

6) After this the WW are in battle gear always.  They grow their AOTD and wait at the Mountain shaped like an arrowhead for Jon Snow and the events that will bring a dragon right to the Night King.  He let them escape.  Its a tactic straight out of Star Wars Episode IV!  A bit of a battle as a distraction and then let them go.  He was able to snag his dragon and that was the goal.



So here it is: the WW only rallied for attack once their line of heirs was severed.  Before that they were just out doing their thing: Collecting tributes, punishing anyone who desecrates their sacred symbols &amp; sites, picking up the babies who keep their culture from dying out, etc.  Before being stabbed in the back by Sam the WW were typically running around barefoot in loincloths like Icy Tarzans.  Afterwards we only see them dressed in battle gear. Boots and all!  

The only exception would be the WW that collected Crasters last son after the mutiny. He was dressed in some gear but was not wearing boots or full gear.  I think they began wearing protective clothing out  and about only after Sam stabbed and killed the one to save Gillys baby.  I also think they created the army of the dead as a retaliatory act for losing their access to progeny.

Now they seek to either make a new pact to avoid extinction or they must find some new way forward. Via Night Queen? Via new magic? Idk.  There are options to be explored there. But I feel like the NK has a new plan.  He has an opportunity to do something that will make history.  I just dont think his plan is to kill all the humans. Thats lame. The Night King has a purpose. He has a plan and he is working it carefully.  

He needs to get south of the Wall. He needs a dragon. Its all part of his plan.  All we have to do is figure out what that is.

Bran will be the only one who can communicate with the NK. That is the reason the NK grabbed Bran in one of Brans visions.  Jon will be in charge of carrying out the terms of the pact for a resolution.  (Jon is always in charge of uniting enemies, he will do it again to get people to stop trying to kill the NK.) Sadly Im sure there will be a tragic mistake that will unravel any progress made by Bran and Jon and then the will come a bittersweet resolution involving self-sacrifice and sorrow.  


This was horribly long. My apologies for that, but I wanted to give a synopsis of my full POV regarding the nature of the WW and the incidents they are blamed for.  I do not think they are violent, barbaric butchers. They can and do create viscous wild monsters with the wights. But, the WW themselves are not like the weights they create.

What are your thoughts for and against?

Surely I am not the only one who thinks the WW didnt start this fight.

I have made my first part of my extended GOT theory. This is what I have so far:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Episode 1: 

**Intro**

It is night. Some guards are walking on the walls of Last Hearth. It is silent, until they hear a strange noise. The noise gets louder and louder, the White Walkers are attacking Last Hearth. The undead Viserion breaches the walls and Last Hearth stands no chance. The castle is turned into a ruin, without bodies. 

**Winterfell**

Jon Snow and Daenerys finally arrive in Winterfell. Jon reunites with Sansa.

Sansa informs everyone the wall is breached. Jon is devastated with this news. How? And where? 

Eastwatch, Sansa answers. Nobody knows how. 

The Hound: Son of a bitch...

Jon: Send ravens to all the northern towns, we have to make sure the Night King cant expand his army. We have to act real quick. Sansa, call all the northern lords to come to Winterfell with all their soldiers, women, children and food. We must defend Winterfell. 

Jon walks through the streets with a concerned face. That is when he meets Arya. Bran is waiting for you Jon. He has something important to say. And.. hes changed, Jon.

Jon walks to the Godswood and meets Bran. Bran, the last time I saw you, you couldnt see me. We never had the chance to say goodbye. I know Bran says. The last time I saw you, you were fighting beyond the wall. Jon, you would have been dead if I hadnt found Benjen. Jon is confused. Benjen? How did you know he was there? He saved my life once beyond the wall, Bran said. You have seen him. I have too. We have to stop him. But there is something else I want to tell you.

Daenerys and Tyrion enter the Godswood. Tyrion asks or Jon comes to the Great Hall. 

Bran: Its almost a coincidence to see you three standing there. Three Targaryens whose mothers died in childbirth. Jon doesnt understand this. My mother? - Yes, your mother, Jon. Lyanna Stark. There is a reason Ned never told about her. She married Rhaegar Targaryen in secret and she died, giving birth to you in Dorne. Daenerys: The rebellion is based on a lie. she concluded. Jon refuses to accept all this. Bran: I believe what I see. I saw you fighting at the Wall against Wildlings. I saw you fighting at Hardhome and saving thousands of Wildlings. I saw you, when you were murdered for it by your own people. I saw you, coming back to life. I saw you fighting against Ramsay Bolton and taking back our home. I saw you, declared King in the North. I saw you beyond the Wall, surrounded by wights. Do you ever wondered how Daenerys could arrive on time? When the raven left Eastwatch, my raven already landed in Dragonstone. And I saw Viserion dying and brought back to life by the Night King. He destroyed the Wall and Last Hearth with it. Daenerys looks devastated when she hears this. 

**Kings Landing**

Cersei is walking on the walls with Cyburn. We see how there are several dragon ballistas installed on the towers. Cersei: The dragons wont survive the ballistas. Every fleet who tries to attack us, will burn. With the Golden Company, we will win every attack on the walls. And if wights try to invade my Kingdom, they can burn in Hell. We hear some blasts from a horn, coming from the Blackwater Bay. It is Euron Greyjoy with the Golden Company. Cersei meets with Harry Strickland, the leader of the Golden Company. Strickland: We fought for Rhaegar Targaryen once. He was a honorable man. But for his sister, we wont make a difference. We will serve you, Cersei Lannister. 

Euron has a chat with Cersei. I heard your brother is gone. Euron said. I dont need him anymore Cersei replies.

&amp;#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The next scene is meant for Jaime Lannister. But I have trouble to come up with a good theory. Something with the Freys and/or the Tully's (With Edmure Tully) could be an idea, but it doesn't feel a nice storyline in my opinion. If Jaime gets their army and arrives at Winterfell.. Yeah.. I dunno, it is far from special. Suggestions? They are welcome! 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, if anyone has a good Melisandre theory, I would gladly hear it! ",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I think that it has to do with her offering a soothing sort of populism.  She is giving people ""stuff"" by ending slavery and promising bread and circuses.  Of course, the cost is an absolute dictatorship in return and a very incompetent one at that.  So the former slaves (or peasants in the case of Westeros) get to see their former masters burn but they experience hardships otherwise.  But that tangible benefit - seeing their masters burn- is worth selling themselves into another form of slavery.  Humans, unfortunately, think about the short-term, not the long-term.

I personally think that this is a deliberate omission, because even though they need Cersei's help, they don't want her to have a stockpile of Valyrian Steel weapons for when the war with the wights ends and the war for the Iron Throne truly begins. My guess would be Valyrian Steel is particularly effective against dragons.

1. Showing visions of the past/present/future.
2. Resurrecting the dead.

We know that the Night King also possesses that second power, but we also have reason to believe that he is also capable of the first. When the Three-Eyed-Raven is teaching Bran how to use his abilities, he is taking him through visions of the past. While doing so, they are only detectable by each other - the only two people in the area with Greensight. However there is a third that has been shown to be more than competent at detecting them in that state and that person is the Night King. It stands to reason that what makes him more capable of detecting the use of Greensight is the same thing that made them able to detect each other: he is a Green Seer too. With that in mind, showing visions of the past/present/future is also one of his abilities.

&amp;#x200B;

My theory is that the Night King is just doing what Bran has shown us he is capable of doing while using his Greensight: using his other abilities to effect the environment while Green-seeing. Bran used his Warging ability on Hodor while amidst a vision of Hodor's past, and the Night King used his resurrection ability on Jon Snow while amidst a vision of Melisandre's present (or perhaps ven her past - the Night King could be doing all of this long after he has won the war). All of R'hllor's feats are just the Night King using his own abilities from the shadows via Green Sight.",12,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Mainly the Tower of Joy flashbacks.

S06E03-Oathbreaker

During the beginning of the flashback, when Ned Stark and company arrive at the tower and are met by Ser Arthur Dayne and Ser Gerold Hightower. Dayne says to Ned, before putting on his helm to prepare for battle, **""I wish you good fortune in the wars to come""** Before they engage in combat and the flashback ends just as Ned is ascending the stairs of the Tower.

S06E10-The Winds of Winter

As we all know the season 6 finale featured the rest of the Tower of Joy flashback concluded and finally confirming the long speculated R+L=J theory. What I had always wondered about that scene was why Bran just happened to go and view that EXACT memory when he connects to the weirwood tree. Baring in mind there is endless memory's and events he could have seen, the obvious answer being that it was a part of the stories narrative and had to show that flashback in order to progress the episode to Jon's King in the North scene.

However, what I noticed this time was Benjen, aside from the fact that he literally drops Bran at the bottom of the weirwood before leaving Bran and Meera at the wall. The last thing he says to them is, **""I wish you both good fortune""** with a long stare. 

This made me think that the Three Eyed Raven had either told Benjen about the events at the Tower of Joy (although there are theories Benjen knew and even aided Lyanna/Rhaegar in the whole ""kidnapping"") or he had shown him the flashback physically, similarly to how he did with Bran. If this is the case, the Three Eyed Raven may also have told Benjen that he cut the vision off with Bran, just before he could see inside the tower. 

The fact that the last words he spoke to Bran was, ""I wish you good fortune"" could have been Benjen's way of triggering that memory with Bran, so that as he touches the weirwood tree, he is subconsciously thinking about his father and the Tower of Joy and thats why the flash back in S06E10 happens to be the second half of the Tower of Joy.

Then again, could be a coincidence. ",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Before Dany leaves Dragon Stone Tyrion brings up her line of succession.

I am convinced that Dany will perish in the upcoming season. I believe that this brief and almost forgettable argument between her and Tyrion is yet another example of the show foreshadowing distant events in the future. There is no way that such a serious topic that was brushed off and never touched on again is not relevant to the story.

George R.R. Martin once said in an interview he didn't even know for sure whether the gods in game of thrones were real. He is also very clear he likes to keep the fantasy as 'magic free' as possible, that is, use as little types of magic and magical entities as possible. He could be throwing us off with that comment, but I have a theory that I believe will make a writer genuinely say they don't know. 

So we know that Bran have certain powers as he is the three eyed raven. He can alternative the past (talking to his father) although the 'ink is dry' so game of thrones uses closed loop time travel (the best kind of time travel, thank you George!). And see everything that happend everywhere at any time past, present and future. We can easily say Bran has much much bigger powers than other magicians like the Warlocks from Qarth or Melisandre.

Now we also know that the night king and Bran have some kind of connection. As he could detect and touch Bran as he was spied upon, and could find either Brans true location or end some protection curse by set touch. There are already theories that the powers of the night king mirror those of the three eyed raven. So besides raising wights, he is also able to see visions and interact with the past. 

Then we have this theory that the Night King is actually the 13th Lord Commander. His name may no longer be spoken. And he is written out of the history of Winterfell. 

Now lets take a look at the faith or R'hllor:

&gt;The religion is based on a dualistic, manichean view of the world: R'hllor, the god of light, heat, and life, and R'hllor's antithesis the [Great Other](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Great_Other), the god of ice and death.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;Rhllor is also called the Lord of Light, the Heart of Fire, the God of Flame and Shadow. His nemesis, the Great Other, whose name may not be spoken, is known as the Lord of Darkness, the Soul of Ice, the God of Night and Terror.

Does the Great Other's description sounds familiar? The Soul of Ice, God of Night and Terror both very suitable names the Night King. They also have in common that their names could not be spoken.

 **So I start to wonder; what if the Night King is the Great Other?** This would imply that the Three Eyed Raven (and in effect Bran) is R'hllor. But how does that work? How are Gods among man? The answer is: they aren't. Gods as in the religion are tales, told time and time again from person to person. Real people become legends, and magical events become God like. Let's remember Westeros is a land where people are raised from the dead, and some dude build an island wide 700 feet tall wall of ice. 

In GOT, magic is subtle but real. Some are stronger than others. But maybe the Gods are not real, there are just two dudes fighting over control over the earth. The stronger growing Night King (in tales became the Great Other) and the Three Eyed Raven (in tales became R'hllor)

And how about the powers of R'hllor and all the magic he does? I think, just like in real life, people are just wrong about religion **a lot**. The God of Light doesn't raise people from the dead, Thoros and Melisandre do. It's a type of magic some 'normal' people posses in GOT. But maybe it's random, or not very reliable, and it is contributed wrongly towards some God. A God that, over the years, grew bigger and more influential in the tales, but in reality, it's all just people.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. Martin said about the Night King the following:

&gt; As for the Night's King (the form I prefer), in the books he is a legendary figure, akin to Lann the Clever and Brandon the Builder, and no more likely to have survived to the present day than they have.

The Three Eyed Raven is passing his powers on every time they die, maybe the Night's King does so too. So the original Night's King was the first one created by the Children of the Forest. Then he passed his role on and on for generations. And one time it was passed on to the 13th lord commander, and thats just the only time we know about on the southern side of the wall. Therefore, the 13th lord commander become the nights king at some point, but died and is succeeded years ago.

And when Theon forced Bran and Rickon to flee the magic was broken and thats why the White Walkers were able to head South. Then, when the Night King marked Bran during his time travel and he returned to the present day and back to Winterfell it allowed the White Walkers to head South.

Gf mentioned this theory and I havent been able to stop thinking about it. The general consensus seems to be that there is no way he would do this, but I disagree and here is why.

The biggest key to making my theory plausible is Littlefinger and his mantra, Chaos is a ladder.

A big reason against Tywins involvement is the chaos the realm experienced that followed Jefferys death. However, the chaos that followed in the wake of jofferys death was only because Tywin had died shortly after. If Tywin never dies, the Purple Wedding is a success. 

Here is where Littlefinger plays an important and crucial role. He acts as the intermediary between Tywin and Olenna. But, it would be foolish to believe that LittleFinger doesnt take advantage of such a plot. He poisons Tywin after the wedding, not Varus as many speculate, thereby causing chaos aka his ladder to the top. However, chaos is unfortunately, chaotic, and he couldnt control the ripples chaos caused. 

I am only going of the show, but there are several scenes which hint at Tywins involvement. Olenna speaking with Cersei at the hand of the Table after Loras was thrown into the sparrows cell. She mentions their alliance continuing and she talks about Tywin.

I didnt trust your father. I particularly didnt like him. But I respected him and he was no fool.  He understood we must work with our rivals rather than destroy them. 

Work with them how? Certainly Tywin knows Olenna would never let Margery marry that psychopath. He knows he needs the Tyrells food and money. He understands he must work with them, by killing Jeffery, getting Margery with Tommen, who he can control, maybe Tyrion gets blamed and absolves him of that monstrosity. 

There is a couple other scenes that stuck out to me during the rewatch with this theory  but I cant remember at this moment. I hope this made some sense.",22,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Its also believed that the Night King was the 13th Lord Commander of the Nights Watch, who was also a Stark. 

Besides that what if the magic involved at the end of the Long Night made it so that Winterfell and the other Starks were able push the White Walkers back north. What if part of this magic has to do with why a Stark MUST ALWAYS be in Winterfell. Maybe thats why the magic that pushed the White Walkers north keeps them North. And when Theon forced Bran and Rickon to flee the magic was broken and thats why the White Walkers were able to head South. Then, when the Night King marked Bran during his time travel and he returned to the present day and back to Winterfell it allowed the White Walkers to head South. 

The Starks used magic to keep the Night King at bay and then they broke that magic now hes able to resurface! What if the new Long Night is not the only reason the Night King has returned? What if the Starks inadvertently caused this all...",14,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

The Mother: Love and Protection, prayed to for mercy, gives the gift of life, also describes Daenerys very well almost too well. She is also *the mother* of dragons. And when she freed the slaves they all referred to her as Mother. 

The Warrior: Symbol of strength in battle, preyed to before battle, symbol of courage. While it doesnt exactly fit as well as Id like it to, Sandor fits this category pretty well, and has been a prevalent character, not to mention its been hinted at that he could beat his brother, The Mountain. 

The Smith: Depicted with his hammer, mends broken things,  without a doubt Gendry. 

The Maiden: Beautiful, innocent looking young woman,  Sansa Stark. Innocent, beautiful, yet powerful. 

The Crone: Old wise woman, whose statue is shown leading with her lamp in her right hand. Thats right you guessed it, Melisandre.

The Stranger: The outcast, The wanderer, the symbol for death. Neither male or female, yet both at the same time. This fits Arya, and her new found talents thanks to her time spent in bravos.

What if the first long night never happened? What if there was no last hero, Nissa Nissa, and a lot of the history is wrong? GRRM alludes to this, and it's alluded in the series. I mean everything is wishy-washy and it's hard to make an accurate theory because of it.

Bare with me now. The type of time travel bran does would work with this. What is Bran off screen has been going back in time and making sure these stories of the last long night were written just so they know how to defete them in today's time? Just like people think he whispered in the Mad kings ear burn them all, just so the wild fire can he stashed. Most of the stories ended up getting mixed up. 

He could have made sure the dragon glass was at dragonstone. How else would the Targaryan's know to so that. The long Night was way before them supposedly. 

It just doesn't make much sense that they weren'the taken care of correctly the last log night. So this to me would actually be a nice suprise. So in reality nothing has happend yet and Jon and Danny have the roles as the Prince who was promised and Nissa Nissa. 

Help me with with this. I'm sure there are other points I can include but I'm in a hurry.

While it doesnt exactly fit as well as Id like it to, Sandor fits this category pretty well, and has been a prevalent character, with an increased character development, not to mention its been hinted at that he could beat his brother, The Mountain, in single combat. 

The Smith: Depicted with his hammer, mends broken things. Cmon, Gendry. 

The Maiden: Beautiful, innocent looking young woman,  Sansa Stark. Innocent, beautiful, yet powerful.

The Crone: Old wise woman, whose statue is shown leading with her lamp in her right hand. Thats right you guessed it, Melisandre.

The Stranger: The outcast, The wanderer, the symbol for death. Neither male or female, yet both at the same time. This fits Arya, and her new found talents thanks to her time spent in bravos.

Let me know what you think.

Like they could have had her infiltrate the castle and find a way to get a knights face or like a maid and find out ways to get revenge on Cersei and the Mountain (who I know will face of the Hound in season 8 which is fine by me) but honestly anything was better than wasting her and Little Finger and even Sansa for an entire season.

I think Jon will wind up on the Iron Throne (details as to how I theorize that'll happen are in my linked post), and then spend his life re-unifying and rebuilding the Seven Kingdoms and their infrastructure, as well as improving relations with foreigners (the Free Folk, of course, but likely also with Easterners). However, I think he'll also end up adopting Daenerys' dream of ""breaking the wheel."" Regardless of how she'd have done it, or how she planned to do it, I think he'll agree with her (or reach the conclusion on his own) that ""the wheel needs to be broken."" It's unclear how she thought that could be accomplished, but I think he'll find that that metaphor manifests in the idea that ultimately the monarchy has done more harm than good for Westeros, and that there's a better alternative. Having been formed in large part during his time in the Night's Watch, where people earn their keep, and having seen the merits of that system, and lived its benefits, I think Jon will ultimately decide that the rest of Westeros needs to follow suit and adopt a similar, or the same system.

I don't know the exact details of how he'd envision it, or what precisely it would look like, but the point is it would be more democratic, and people (likely a selected delegation) would at least elect their ruler (who would replace the position of King of Westeros), if not elect Lords or others as well (although I feel it far less likely that he'd also insist all regional Lordships become an elected position as well as the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms).

To avoid any competition and minimize rogue elements during and after the transition of power from the monarchy to the new system after his death, he'll choose never to wed or sire an heir. I think he may not even reach that conclusion on his own at first, but someone will bring the idea to his attention and he'll ultimately decide that they're right and agree that it's the best thing to do. It feels like Tyrion could be the perfect character to be spilling that truth and wisdom. Maybe after Daenerys alienates him more (as per my theory from last year), he'll eventually throw his support behind Jon, and at some point they'll have that conversation where Jon in the end sees that if he truly wants to shift the realm into the better system he envisions, he can't marry or have children because it would potentially jeopardize that vision.

By making that choice, and living out his life by that decision, he'll ultimately have diverted from the example both of his fathers set for him. He'll have made the opposite choice as each of them, ultimately setting him apart, and cementing the decision he has struggled with for his whole character arc. Maester Aemon said it best in the very beginning, to Jon himself no less -- that there comes a time in every man's life when he must choose between love and duty. Since that point, a major component of Jon's whole arc throughout the story has been his struggle with making that choice and its consequences.

First, he chose duty, and ultimately didn't abandon his brothers in Black to go fight alongside Robb in the War of the Five Kings. Then, he chose love, and betrayed his oath to be with Ygritte, with whom he fell deeply in love. Afterwards, however, when it came down to the battle between the Wildlings (love) and the Night's Watch (duty), Jon chose duty, and led his brothers bravely against Mance Rayder's assault on Castle Black, even though it cost Ygritte her life. He remained faithful to his choice for duty to his brothers when he was voted Lord Commander, even though he didn't want it, and made every decision he made based on what he thought was best for his brothers in arms. Then, some who disagreed with his decisions betrayed him, and he became disillusioned with duty, opening himself up to choosing love again by the end of Season 7 when he falls for Daenerys.

This long struggle has mirrored some of the defining moments of both Ned and Rhaegar's own lives, of Jon's two fathers, both of whom he resembles somewhat.

At the end of Robert's Rebellion, Ned was presented with his incarnation of the love vs. duty choice when Lyanna shared her secret with him, and in that defining moment he chose love. Between his duty to his King to root out all the Targaryen clan, and love for his family -- for his sister -- and her dying wish for him to protect her son, Ned chose love over duty.

Similarly, at the beginning of Robert's Rebellion, Rhaegar was presented with a choice between love and duty. He was married with two children by his wife, and therefore duty-bound to faithfulness with her, but he loved another woman and wanted to be with her more than his wife. Caught between love and duty, Rhaegar also chose love, making what he believed were the best decisions for that love of his -- secretly annulling his marriage to his first wife, Elia, and marrying Lyanna, with whom he had that love.

When Jon makes the decision never to marry or have children to prevent his vision for a better Westeros for its citizens from being jeopardized, he will be choosing duty over love. He will be King by then, and as King he will acknowledge that his #1 duty is to his people. He's also human, will have deeply loved twice by then, and will undoubtedly desire that connection with someone. Both times he will have loved (presumably, although we haven't seen much of his &amp; Daenerys' love yet) will have been passionate, and will have been a love that he thrived in. However, with his first duty being to his people, he'll ultimately choose them over himself. Duty over love.

Plus, he may even be subconsciously influenced in that direction by each of his fathers' lives. Ned ultimately suffered in his marriage with Cat, as did his &amp; their reputation, for his choosing love over duty. That followed him everywhere for the rest of his life. He also put Cat through a great deal of suffering. All of that because he chose love over duty. Rhaegar not only lost his life because he chose love over duty, he sent the entire realm into turmoil during a long, bloody, brutal war, that destroyed not only his legacy but literally the entire 300 years' worth of Targaryen Kings' legac(ies).

Given, Jon's also suffered each time that he chose duty over love, but he may not equate that suffering of his own with the damage Rhaegar &amp; Ned caused by choosing love over duty.

In any case though, the point is that: What will wind up setting Jon apart from both of his fathers, Ned &amp; Rhaegar, will be that he chose duty over love.

(On top of everything, this feels pretty bittersweet, and could be a component of the ""bittersweet"" ending that GRRM famously teased [alongside with other components from my first theory, perhaps?].)

TL;DR: At the end of GoT, Jon will be King. Having been crowned, he'll decide that it'll be best for the citizens of Westeros for him to ""break the wheel"" by setting up a more democratic system like the one he was exposed to in the Night's Watch for his succession after he dies. After sharing this vision with his advisors at some point, it's likely someone (Tyrion perhaps) will bring to his attention the ugly truth that he knows deep inside but hadn't fully acknowledged: That if he wants to set up a democratic system for the succession of the ruler of the Seven Kingdoms after he dies, it's best for him to never marry or sire an heir to prevent any competition with the new system after his death. He will realize that they're right, agree, and honor that choice at the end of the story. By doing that, his entire character arc during Game of Thrones that has mirrored both of his father's (Ned &amp; Rhaegar's) life stories &amp; defining moments, centered around the idea that a man has to choose between love and duty, will have built up to the moment when he ultimately chooses differently from both of his fathers. They both chose love over duty (Ned when he kept his promise to Lyanna to protect Jon thereby defying his duty to his friend and King, and Rhaegar when he married Lyanna out of love thereby defying his duty to the wife he already had &amp; their children), but Jon ultimately chooses duty over love, separating him from them, defining his character, and satisfyingly wrapping up his entire character arc &amp; story where he struggled so much with this choice.",2,1,False,self,,,,,

561,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-11-9,2018,11,9,5,9vdqxg,self.gameofthrones,GOT ruined Loras Tyrell,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/9vdqxg/got_ruined_loras_tyrell/,FierceDeity88,1541709808,"I'm sure more people than not are disappointed with the seventh season for many reasons, though I'm just as sure those same people were disappointed with some of the ""creative choices"" D&amp;D were making long before then, but rather than discuss all of the things wrong with the show and question whether it can be salvaged, I wanted to get people's opinion on Loras Tyrell, especially those people that have also read the books.

&amp;#x200B;

In the books, Loras Tyrell is mostly similar to his on-screen adaptation...at least on the surface. He's an incredible fighter, beloved by the commoners and nobility alike, and it was more implied rather than explicitly stated that he was homosexual and was in a relationship with Renly Baratheon. Unlike in the show (spoilers for those who haven't read the books), he is not relegated to a side character with barely a few lines per season after his sister Margaery is introduced. He has an arc: going from arrogant and headstrong to more level-headed and rational once he joins the Kingsguard (spoilers for book readers). It is heavily implied that he genuinely loved Renly and joined the Kingsguard because he had consigned himself to a life of duty, knowing he would never love anyone near as much. He adopts a elder-brother role to Tommen and even willingly sacrifices himself to save his father's people because of Cersei's incompetence, and is celebrated as a hero...though whether he's still alive is in question. Bottom line: he is deeply respected by those who either loved or feared him, and most people either suspected or knew he was gay, even Jaime, but did not fault or shame him for it...or even care.

&amp;#x200B;

In the show and after the second season, Loras's sole defining role is that he's gay. Despite the fact that he helped save King's Landing from Stannis, he is constantly shamed/belittled - either to his face or behind his back - by almost every major character on the show. And that's pretty much it. Even Tyrion and Jaime and even his grandmother Olenna casually mock him. On the sole crime of being gay, he is imprisoned, stripped of his inheritance, publicly mutilated, then incinerated along with nearly his entire family. And that's his story. Indeed, it could be argued that Loras's homosexuality was an extension of D&amp;D's inexplicable desire to have House Tyrell constantly bullied, mocked, and forced to suffer continuous slights for FOUR SEASONS, only to be casually defeated offscreen because apparently House Tyrell was ""never really good at fighting"". On that note, I had hoped Olenna would get some sweet, delicious revenge. Instead I had to watch her reveal information to Jaime that did absolutely nothing to advance the plot and watch her drink poison...and for some reason people said she went out with a bang and photoshopped sunglasses over her eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm honestly not sure whether Loras's portrayal was a product of how HBO shows generally portray members of the LGBTQ community (i.e, terribly and/or as stereotypes, or not at all, except for in Looking), or just a solid example of D&amp;D taking a plot from the books and inexplicably making it terrible, but as a gay man, I was offended by how they trashed his character.

Neds expression turns from happy to worried and then there are voices of sorts and then the sound of metal piercing flesh as Syrio stabs Arya in the stomach as Ned looks on.

Weird.

Second, I don't know why I put a spoiler warning. 

First, let's recap where each major player is. Jon/Dany &amp; Company enroute to Winterfell. Sansa, Bran, Arya &amp; Nothern/Vale army @ Winterfell. Night's King &amp; Army moving south from Eastwatch by the Sea. Cersei and portion of Lannister forces in King's Landing. Jaime headed North. Iron Fleet headed to Essos to retrieve Golden Company. 

No doubt there will be a battle at Winterfell. It will be built up as THE big event. Its epic everyone with Valyrion steel will be slaying white walkers left and right. Dead Giants and all. Jon and Company win but the Night's King was absent from the battle. Which allowed Dany to use her dragons to smoke the wights. Aftermath Sam/Bran reveals Jon's parentage. Howland Reed confirms it. There will be debates about their next move and determining where the Night's king is. Sam at some point gives the Hound Heartsbane probably prior to the battle. 

The Night's King flies south to the riverlands raise all the dead from the War of the Five Kings and marches them to Kings Landing. 

Jaime participates in the battle of Winterfell and informs Jon &amp; Company of Cerseis betrayal. Bran sees where the Night's King is and they all realize he's going to be heading to Kings Landing. Jaime and the Hound leave together to go to Kings Landing to warn them/help prepare their defenses. Jon &amp; Company will march south. 

Jaime and the Hound arrive in King's Landing while just prior to the Night's King attack. Jaime and the Hound got to the Red Keep to rescue Cersei. 

Because of Winter snows marching south is too slow to arrive in time to help. In a desperate attempt Dany and Jon mount up and fly south. 

Jaime &amp; the Hound get to the throne room to find Cersei on the Iron Throne with only the Mountain.  Cersei orderz the Mountain to kill them and Jaime says a clever line about bringing his own Clegane. Clegane bowl ensues. Jaime pleads with Cersei to come away with him and live. Cersei refuses. Jaime realizes Cersei loves power more than him and says ""Im already a kingslayer why not a Quernslayer"" Jaime drives his sword into Cersei. 

Take a moment to soak in the metaphors happening here. The Night's King raised all the dead from the War of the Five Kings all of whom Cersei played a major role in the events that lead to their deaths. And Jaime kills Cersei by plunging his sword into her. Sword = Penis. Jaimr is the most tragic character in GoT. 

Hound wins. Jaime stares at what he did. Jaime tells the Hound to get out of here. Hound leaves. Jaime goes to the remaining wildfire caches and ignites them. Sacrificing himself and denying the Night's King his million new soldiers. Point of order the city walls are breached because of  dragon wight. 

Jon &amp; Dany arrive as city blows up. They enter a threeway dragon battle above the burning city. I don't know how it will happen but either Dany or Jon will die. Probably Jon because Dany is preggo. 
Jon kills the Night's King in an epic dual. Both their dragons are down Jon and the Night's King have an epic dual. Dany flies in at the end but unable to smoke him. Night's King stabs Jon Jon swings longclaw smashing him into a thousans pieces. Dany &amp; Jon share one last moment together.

603,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-11-10,2018,11,10,0,9vl5q6,self.gameofthrones,[SPOILERS] Was Margaery Tyrell named after Margery Jourdemayne?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/9vl5q6/spoilers_was_margaery_tyrell_named_after_margery/,TheFriendlyGrimm,1541775960,"Margery (or Margaery) is a fairly uncommon first name.

In history, one of the most famous Margerys was Margery Jourdemayne or ""the Witch of Eye""; (Eye being a small, pretty town in Suffolk, UK)

Margery Jourdemayne (in a nutshell) was a young woman from a farming region whose skills brought her fame, fortune and to the court of Henry VI in London, where she was a medical advisor to Eleanor, Duchess of Gloucester.

Unfortunately, due to court rivalries, Margery was falsely accused, tried by the church and burnt to death.

If we replace ""Suffolk""; with ""Highgarden"", the ""Court of Henry VI in London"" with ""the Court of King Joffery in Kings Landing"", the ""church"" with the ""Sept""; and leave ""court rivalries"", ""unjustly accused"" and ""burnt to death""; just the way they are, Margery Jourdemayne's life echoes Margaery Tyrells. Sure, Margery Jourdemayne was the daughter of a cowherd rather than the daughter of a lord, her skills were in botany, pharmacy and medicine rather than politics and she was an advisor to a royal duchess rather than the queen but, nevertheless,  Margery Jourdemayne's journey stopped at many of the same points as Margaery Tyrells and ended at the same destination.

\_\_\_  Historical Context \_\_\_

If you want to know a bit more about the accusations against Margery Jourdemayne, it's important to realise that up until a few centuries ago the most common name for a female scientist was a witch!

For most of western history, the great majority of women were illiterate, uneducated and, if they did attempt to enter the male domains of politics, acedemia, pharmacy or medicine, they risked being accused of witchcraft and burnt; see Joan of Arc, who lead an army, and Anne Askew, theologian.

Margery Jourdemayne, like Joan and Anne, also stepped out of the domestic sphere through her largely self-taught skills in what we would now call botany, research, pharmacy and medicine, specialising in helping women to become pregnant. She also, like many scientists of her time, was interested in astrology and alchemy (remember, Newton himself was heavily into the occultist as well as being a physicist).

Whilst these skills were not inappropriate for the wife of a cowherd (no such thing as the NHS in the 15th century), Margery's skill and knowledge in obstetrics were such that they gained the notice of the aristocracy (remember, in the 15th century an infertile woman was a woman destined for the nunnery, desertion or an ""accident"", however highly born she might have been). Her reputation grew and she entered royal circles, becoming an advisor and doctor to Eleanor, Duchess of Gloucester (see Eleanor Cobham).

However, powerful, intelligent, independent minded woman have always inspired a fair amount of jealousy, spite and hatred and there are always people- especially amongst the male population- who cannot bear to see a proud, beautiful woman go unhumbled. Duchess Eleanor was accused of witchcraft and her advisors- including Margery- were convicted on trumped up charges and burnt.

If you've been moved by this story, please consider proposing Margery Jourdemayne for the 50 note; the Bank of England wants people to submit the names of (dead) scientists for their new 50 note. Medieval society didn't allow Margery to become a doctor and the court of Henry VI destroyed her reputation as a scientist by calling her a witch. Her achievements were not recorded but she did achieve this; of all the nameless Medieval woman who contributed so much to their world, we know Margery's name and we know that she was a brilliant scientist because, whilst the church could try to obfuscate her skill, they couldn't conceal that she had gone from being the wife of a cowherd to the advisor of a royal duchess (suggesting amazing skills as you don't ascend the ranks without being really, really great at your job), nor could they supress her defence- that she was helping Eleanor to become pregnant through her skills in obstetrics.

In the books, Loras Tyrell is mostly similar to his on-screen adaptation...at least on the surface. He's an incredible fighter, beloved by the commoners and nobility alike, and it was more implied rather than explicitly stated that he was homosexual and was in a relationship with Renly Baratheon. Unlike in the show (spoilers for those who haven't read the books), he is not relegated to a side character with barely a few lines per season after his sister Margaery is introduced. He has an arc: going from arrogant and headstrong to more level-headed and rational once he joins the Kingsguard (spoilers for book readers). It is heavily implied that he genuinely loved Renly and joined the Kingsguard because he had consigned himself to a life of duty, knowing he would never love anyone near as much. He adopts a elder-brother role to Tommen and even willingly sacrifices himself to save his father's people because of Cersei's incompetence, and is celebrated as a hero...though whether he's still alive is in question. Bottom line: he is deeply respected by those who either loved or feared him, and most people either suspected or knew he was gay, even Jaime, but did not fault or shame him for it...or even care.

In the show and after the second season, Loras's sole defining role is that he's gay. Despite the fact that he helped save King's Landing from Stannis, he is constantly shamed/belittled - either to his face or behind his back - by almost every major character on the show. And that's pretty much it. Even Tyrion and Jaime and even his grandmother Olenna casually mock him. On the sole crime of being gay, he is imprisoned, stripped of his inheritance, publicly mutilated, then incinerated along with nearly his entire family. And that's his story. Indeed, it could be argued that Loras's homosexuality was an extension of D&amp;D's inexplicable desire to have House Tyrell constantly bullied, mocked, and forced to suffer continuous slights for FOUR SEASONS, only to be casually defeated offscreen because apparently House Tyrell was ""never really good at fighting"". On that note, I had hoped Olenna would get some sweet, delicious revenge. Instead I had to watch her reveal information to Jaime that did absolutely nothing to advance the plot and watch her drink poison...and for some reason people said she went out with a bang and photoshopped sunglasses over her eyes.

I'm honestly not sure whether Loras's portrayal was a product of how HBO shows generally portray members of the LGBTQ community (i.e, terribly and/or as stereotypes, or not at all, except for in Looking), or just a solid example of D&amp;D taking a plot from the books and inexplicably making it terrible, but as a gay man, I was offended by how they trashed his character.

First things first. I am currently busy reading through ASOIAF for the first time. Then I would like to add some context. When I read through one of the Jon Snow chapters I noticed something peculiar. Someone of the Night\`s Watch (I don\`t know who and I\`m to lazy to check.) said the cold smells like nothing. Jon then remembers the night Othor (turned wight) attempted to kill Jeor Mormont, and then says that the cold smells like death.

Then the famous ""Azor Ahai"" prophecy. For those who do not know this prophecy states the following: 

&gt;""*There will come a day after a long summer when the stars bleed and* *the cold breath of darkness falls heavy on the world*\*. In this dread hour a warrior shall draw from the fire a burning sword. And that sword shall be\* *Lightbringer*\*, the Red Sword of Heroes, and he who clasps it shall be Azor Ahai come again, and the darkness shall flee before him.""

The original Azor Ahai thrusted Lightbringer into his lover\`s chest to temper the blade, this has led to fans theorizing that Jamie/Jon will do the same thing with Cersei/Daenerys respectively. I am not here to make theories on that, but here is the possible connection I spotted. Remember Jon said that the cold which is related to ice smells like death, and when you replace the word ice with death in the words ""A Song Of Ice and Fire"" you get ""A Song Of Death and Fire"".

This is basically a summary of the Azor Ahai prophecy. Someone dies and a fiery sword to save humanity is drawn out. I am aware the title ""A Song Of Ice And Fire"" probably refers to Jon and Daenerys\` child, or simply Jon snow himself. This connection is probably only a coincidence, and I am over thinking things, but nevertheless I thought it was pretty cool and wanted to share it.",10,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Basically, my friend has an audition coming up for an ""Untitled HBO series"" that's looking to shoot in early 2019, it's cast by the same person casting The Long Night, and they're wanting someone who can do a Northern (UK) accent. It's not confirmed to be the prequel but, I mean, it seems too coincidental for it not to be, you know? His agent also think this is probably the case. 

Anyway, he hasn't really been given any info and they've not provided a script, they've only said that they're looking for ""a mixed race actor with a playing age of 17-20"". If it helps the role is going to be a series regular one.

Is there anyway to narrow it down toward maybe even a specific group of people within the universe? 

The kid's a great actor/overall amazing human but he's been pretty down on his luck recently so, because of everything he's done for me, I really want to help him out here. Plus, I mean, more leaks the further he gets, I guess.

It is known that the old Valyrians were very close with magic, and were from lands of the long summer, and they were aware of the land of always winter. 


If they knew the threat or the power of the north, why didn't they try to harvest the powers, since they had already somewhat ""harnessed"" the magical powers of the south (Shadowlands, asshai, sorcerers, warlocks, the ""magic gold"" that empowered the old valyrian noble houses, doom of valyria, prophecies, red priest's)?

Drogon for instance is named after Khal Drogo who as well as being the largest of the three (Drogo was a big man) he is also the dragon Danny uses most often to destroy her enemies and in her conquest for the 7 kingdoms as Khal Drogo promised her the 7 kingdoms before he died. Visorion (named after Vinerys Targaryen) is turned against his mother by the night kings magic corrupting his mind after being brought back to life, this is similar to the fact that Vinerys went mad because of his incest genes, causing him to be abusive and cruel against her. And as for Rhaegel (who is named after Rhaegar Targaryen) I believe he will link to Rhaegar like the others link to theirs as I predict that Jon will end up riding Rhaegel as he is the son of Rhaegar and would also make Jon have both a dire wolf (ghost) and a dragon linking him both to the Targaryens and Starks.",9,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Now how would it happen idk. In my opinion it probably be when NK is closer to KL, maybe when/if J&amp;D take KL they imprison Cersei instead of killing her right away, with Qyburn pretending to change sides.

Then while no one's looking Qyburn and Mountain take Cersei to the NK and the NK has Cersei be turned into the Night Queen via putting a piece of Dragonglass into her chest. The reason I think this could be true is that a part of the Valonqar prophecy is that he would put her hands around her pale white throat (and YES I AM AWARE that the Valonqar prophecy was NOT in the show but I think it still applies in my opinion), and also Qyburn seems very interesting into that Wight last season.",6,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

So a couple episodes before Jon Snow gets murdered by Olly, Sam and Olly have a conversation. The conversation did not really seem important because Sam was just saying that Jon Snow is bringing the wildlings into castle black and that Jon is making the right decision even though its tradition that the nights watch and the free folk are sworn enemies. But then Olly takes this advice as if he has to make the right decision in killing Jon Snow. Did Sam actually motivate Olly and convince him to kill Jon Snow?

The first is the torturer who's been hard at work in Harrenhal. Then, a messenger who is about to spill the beans to Tywin.  Then, to fuck with him, she gives Jaqen his own name.  She says she will unname him if he helps her and her friends escape, which he then does.

So I cant get past Jon snows hair colour in the show ( not sure if its accurate to the books) but its not only stark brown its Baratheon black and Baratheon beard aswell .. 

Everyone keeps saying his parents have finally been revealed but in truth we actually only know that he is son of lyanna and that she married rhaegar and that rhaegar has his marriage annulled ...

 At the tourney of harrenhall lyanna was betrothed to Robert Baratheon but as we know rhaegar rode past his wife and gave the flowers to lyanna , this would have enraged Robert.... 

Theres  a passage that describes everyone of note at the tourney and only Robert is mentioned drinking wine , I know nearly all would have been drinking it is Westeros after all , but why only mention it with Robert ?? I think to remind or emphasise that hes often drunk and rowdy and we know he likes his women and had many bastards ( possibly forcing himself on women while drunk) 

I think that lyanna may have told Robert shes in love with rhaegar and was leaving and Robert raped her thus meaning that the baby she had (jon snow) is a Baratheon ...

I think that lyanna and rhaegar eloped and when rhaegar found out that Robert raped lyanna, this is when he returned to 

I know many people dont think the timeline doesnt add up but its very vague and I think it is possible Ive read different stuff theorising on the timelines as I note below 

Things that dont add up: 



: why were rhaegar and lyanna in dorne??( when rhaegar betrayed/embarrassed elia the Cornish princess?)
This has been asked a lot , Ive read different theories , it is possible that the Martels were happy for them to be there as they believed in the azor prophecy 3rd head and all that ??  But they were angry enough to hold back raising there banners for the targs against Robert ?? So maybe not .. 

: Ive read other theories that propose that theres about 3-4 months from the tourney of harrenhal and the abduction/eloping  if lyanna was raped by Robert at the tourney       (I think Ive read that rhaegar and a few of his men took of looking for the mystery knight so not sure how long that was ? leaving lyanna vulnerable to Robert who she was betrothed to).. this fits in with a good timeline of finding out shes pregnant !  Baby bump etc ... 

:They take off to dorne with rhaegar thinking its his baby , with 2 knights of the kingsguard and four others ???? Why so many men if its not an abduction They were just eloping?? 
-

Their are obviously many things we havent been told by GRRM either deliberately or its just in the next book but I really find it strange that jon snow has such dark hair and beard from all the research Ive done of Targaryens there a very few who dont have silver hair true its when they are Targaryen and another family but I think always when the Targaryen is the father the child has silver/white hair, I mean look at the description/pictures/actors of the mad king his sons rhaegar and Viserys and then to get Jon so different I dont buy it !!!

I've honestly not seen much discussion on this game, which surprises me. I know it's not exactly canon, but I find it really compelling. Particularly its end. Because some stuff has been really surprising me:

* &gt;!The name of the 13th Lord Commander, often called the Night's King, is Orgo Magnar (""Lord Orgo"" in Old Tongue)!&lt;
* &gt;!Nine ravens being given to Lord Magnar by the Children of the Forest, because ""they will show your kind how to restore the balance."" The Lord Commander comes back to Castle Black with these gifts, and the game later makes note that ""their descendants spread throughout Westeros.""!&lt;
* &gt;!It's important to note that there are nine character slots in the game. Eight of these are playable characters: Daenarys, Jon, Cersei, Sansa, Jaime, Tyrion, Gendry, and Arya. The ninth is a raven. From what I got, the game seems to allude that there are nine ""Princes/Princesses that were Promised."" Maybe. My conclusion is probably wrong. Really wrong.!&lt;

Hey guys! We all know how deep the characters are in the books and in the show and as a psych major, analyzing them is very interesting. So that's what I did in a video I'll link below. I know there are some inconsistencies regarding Arya's character in season 7 especially. She overcame wanting to be no one, started regaining her identity as a stark again and all of sudden she wanted to kill Sansa? That made no sense and wasn't at all in line with her character, but I do talk about both Sansa and Arya's developments over all the seasons so there are spoilers if you haven't watched 1-7.

I also describe what political metaphors they are and how that describes the modern political climate. 

What do you think?

You have to remember, in the books Joffrey is a very beautiful young man, he looks like a young version of Jaime. He is the heir of the Iron Throne, the future King and he is incredible beautiful. How can Sansa not fall in love with him?  

In the beginning, Joffrey is always polite and sweet in front of Sansa, he makes sure to keep his evil behavior under traps so Sansa has no motive to think badly about him. Eventually Joffrey does start to show his true self but at that point Sansa is already in love with him, so, she closes her eyes, pretend to not see it and makes excuses for his behavior. Until the very end, when Joffrey cuts down Eddar Stark head and shows his true self for Sansa, breaking her heart in a million of pieces. Thats what its going to happen with Daenerys in season 8. She will finally show to the audience her true self, breaking their hearts in a million of pieces.

The very first scene with Daenerys in season 1 its in the balcony of her room in Pentos its almost angelical. She looks so beautiful and ethereal. This could never be final monster of the story right?   In season 1 Daenerys was very sweet and endearing, its impossible to not fall in love with the little princess forced into marriage to a savage by her evil brother. She is kind, fragile and sweet, so sweet.

Then in the following seasons and books she starts to show us a more ruthless and cruel side, but we are already in love with her, so we just close our eyes and try to justify all of her actions and terrible behavior. Daenerys is obsessed with the Iron Throne, in fact she will spend years walkig around Essos, invading cities and starting wars in order to have armies to invade Westeros, but when asked about her actions, she always comes up with generous answers. Oh, she is sacking Astapor to save the Unsulied from the evil masters, oh she wants Meereen to revenge the crucified children, oh she took the Dotrahki from their homes because she will lead them better than their own khals. 

She keeps showing us, how destructive and ruthless she is, but we keep believing she is doing all this for the good of her people, its not just for the Throne, right, right???? And she is always cruel, very cruel to her enemies, they always die in some sort of terrible way, she does this because she wants to avenge those they hurt, she doesnt do that because she enjoys it, right, right????

In season 2, we had a scene where one of the characters for the first time, actually called Daenerys on her false excuses. [In the scene under we have Xaro Xhoan Daxos make fun of Daenerys excuse that she wants the Iron Throne for her khalasar.](https://youtu.be/qgB5QBfX0zE?t=24)

Later, she changes her excuse and now says that she wants the Iron Throne so that she can break the wheel, keep in mind she never really explained how this will happen or  even what she means with breaking the wheel. In the end, those are just silly excuses. Daenerys wants the Iron Throne because she wants to be queen, thats it, thats the reason, but she cant admit it because it will make her the villain of her own story. Invading countries, waging war, killing millions of people just for power is terrible,  so she makes up those silly little lies, but in the end they are all lies.  And thats exactly what we will found out in season 8. 


Daenerys its going to shock us in season 8, she is going to be cruel, selfish and terrible. She will break the audience heart and show us how silly we were for falling in love with a monster. Thats why they used that line in the episode 6:

&gt;Jon Snow: They will all come to see you for what you are.

.

Thats what its going to happens in season 8, we will finally see it Daenerys for what she really is. She is going to be cruel, violent and destructive and do whatever it takes to get the Iron Throne. Daenerys is not her father, she is her brother Viserys. Even her clothing started to reflect more and more her similarities with her older brother. 

&gt;I think its quite interesting that we finally see [Dany] embracing her brothers ambition. What does that say? Youre seeing the beginning of something. Were not at the end yet and I think its very important at this moment that we start seeing who she is. [Michelle Clapton on Daenerys wardobre for season 7.]( https://www.thisisinsider.com/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-interview-2017-6)


&gt;Remember when Sansa Stark fell madly in love with a monster and trusted a beautiful queen blindly when she was warned against it?

You are all Sansas, you just dont know yet.

I doubt bran will ever marry and have kids because 
His injury might not allow it.
He's basically the 3ER now so doubt it.
He has no woman.

Arya and Sansa are Women and would have to take the husbands last name. They might be able to use theirs idk.
But I don't think Sansa's story is pointing at her ever marrying again and having any children.

I think Arya could marry Gendry but if you remember her injury, she basically got stabbed on the side you carry a child so I'm not sure she could even have children.

Jon is a Targaryan.


Unless Jon gets the Throne by right that he's a Targaryan but chooses to remain Stark. That would mean any child he has will be stark. 
Or honestly if Danny dies he might Marry Sansa just for duty sake.

 Direwolf names and death closely parallel their owners own fate so I think Sansa is destined to die. 

She will either die at the hands of the others, and if the NK is a stark then the ideology Ned had that it should be someone from the North slay the wolf will come into play. Ned, a stark killed lady, and the NK, a stark will kill Sansa. (Assuming he's a stsrk which I think is likely).

Or you have this idea which is also plausible, that Sansa will betray everyone just like she did when she lied for Joffery about the wolf attack. Leading to her eventual execution by a stark or person from the north in a bitter sweet moment. ""The man who passes the sentence must swing the sword"".

Or you have Sansa will put her own life on the line either in battle, or scheming to help her family unlike she did with the Joffery wolf atrack, and she is killed for it. 

Either way you look at it Sansa is doomed I think. There is really nothing else left for her. If Winterfell burns or is completely taken over by whights then she has no purpose for the story. I think her dying a hero would be poetic.",12,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I for one fall in-between the two, as I love the interactions between many of the characters who are meeting for the first time, as well as watching in awe at some of the amazing action this episode contains. However, what disappoints me about this episode is some of the glaring plot holes and bad writing not normally familiar with Game of Thrones. So this post is going to highlight some of these issues in writing and how they could have been improved/avoided, as well as talking about improvements to the episode as a whole. 

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. This post will not cover the Winterfell story line with Arya and Sansa, which in my opinion just wasn't great.

&amp;#x200B;

1) Jaime Lannister should have been part of the suicide squad.

After Bronn miraculously saved Jaime's life from Drogon's fire, he fell into the lake to drown - his armour pulling him to the floor of the lake. Somehow, Bronn managed to single-handily (pun intended) drag Jaime to dry land unseen, away from all the Dothraki that had just surrounded them. What would have made more sense would have been if Jaime was captured by Daenerys and held as a high-level prisoner, as she could use him to try and take King's Landing peacefully from Cersei. Hell, Jamie could even have been directly used to tell Cersei about the armistice Daenerys had proposed. However, once the plan to go north of the wall and capture a wight had been agreed, sending Jaime along with the crew would have made perfect sense. If he died during the mission Daenerys wouldn't really care - he was the person who murdered her father and in effect put the killer blow into the Targaryen reign of the Seven Kingdoms. Plus he wouldn't be able to escape anywhere, as the land beyond the wall is open and freezing, so if Jaime was to run away he would more than likely get lost and freeze to death. But, the main reason to take him would be that if the mission was to fail and they couldn't catch a wight, then Jaime, the only person who Cersei trusts, would be able to tell her what he saw. Also, this would lead to some pretty cool interactions between Jaime and Daenerys after the battle back at the wall. Jaime would see Daenerys risk her life for everyone and see her distraught after losing one of her dragons, and see that she's not this foreign monster that burned hundreds of his men alive because she's supposedly 'evil' and 'just like her father'. And Daenerys would see Jaime trying to console her and see he's not the dishonourable Kingslayer she first thought. This would also further influence Jaime's decision to leave Cersei for Winterfell in the season finale.

&amp;#x200B;

2) At least one more person should have died.

While this is only a small point (we did lose Thoros, Viserion and Benjen after all), I'm of the belief that at least one more person should have bit the bullet in this episode. The three characters that died in this episode weren't really 'big' characters so to say, so the emotional impact didn't really hit viewers that hard. While I don't believe a massive character like Jon or Daenerys should have died, I do believe a character of somewhat importance should have gone in order to really get viewers upset, angry and riled up for the war against the walkers in the final season. My choice for this would have been Jorah Mormont. He could have died a noble death protecting Daenerys from the dead, and it would have brought honour back to his family and house, dying beyond the wall like his father did before him.

&amp;#x200B;

3) Gendry isn't Mo Farah.

Gendry being the one to run back to the wall didn't make sense to me. Not only is he not familiar with his surroundings - he is not equipped for them. He was the only one that hadn't seen snow before for crying out loud! What should have happened is the idea should have been suggested, but then the wights would come and surround them on the island before anyone had chance to run off. This would leave a sense of fear and hopelessness in our heroes as they would be in essence waiting for their impending doom. This leads nicely into my next point...

&amp;#x200B;

4) Bran is supposed to be the most important person in stopping the White Walkers - let him show people why!

I was seriously disappointed with Bran in Season 7. He literally did nothing but screw Littlefinger over (even though he had zero evidence, so not sure why people would take a child's word as truth) and creeped his sister out. This episode should have shown us why Bran is the strongest character in Game of Thrones. After the squad is trapped on the island, it should have panned out to a group of ravens overlooking in the sky - being controlled by Bran. Now this is where my plot falls a little into the trope of 'writing for tv', but it would be a lot cooler and makes a lot more sense than a raven flying all the way to Dragonstone for Daenerys to fly all the way back to a location she isn't even sure of. Now, Bran would take over the role of a character from the books called Quaithe (she appeared in Season 2 for a couple of episodes) and appear to Daenerys as a 'vision', warning Daenerys of the fate of Jon and the others if she does not ride out to help them, (and yes I know Quaithe more than likely used a Glass Candle to communicate with Daenerys in the books, but they don't exist in the show and I'm sure we can bend the rules a little bit for the Three-Eyed Raven's powers). Daenerys will ask Bran how she is to find them, with Bran responding, ""I'll show you"", before Viserion lets fly and heads off north towards the wall. Bran is now in control of the dragon and will use him to lead Daenerys to Jon (yes I know the Three-Eyed Raven is being made incredibly powerful here, but it's about time Bran showcased some of his powers).

&amp;#x200B;

5) The Night King's mark on Bran links everything.

Remember that mark the Night King left on Bran in season 6, that allowed him to enter the Three Eyed Raven's cave - seems to have been forgotten about huh? Well this little forgotten detail is the thing for me that could solve the most annoying plot hole in this episode - why the wights just waited around doing nothing. I know the show basically stated it was because the lake wasn't frozen over so they couldn't reach them, and only after they realised it had re-froze over did they start to attack them, but this seems stupid to me. The wights managed to swim when they attached the chain onto a dead Viserion, and earlier in the episode two wights that had fallen into the lake re-emerged to try and pull Tormund into the lake with them. No, the reason why the Night King and the wights should have held off their attack was due to his mark that was left on Bran. This mark basically has made a connection between Bran and the Night King (totally not ripping off Harry Potter here), allowing the Night King to see everything Bran has seen - sort of making him like a White Walker Three-Eyed Raven. This would suggest why the Night King hated the Three-Eyed Raven so much and wanted to get to him and kill him like he did - so he could see 'everything' like Bran now does. In being able to see everything like Bran does the Night King could have seen that Daenerys has three dragons and that he needed one to be able to bring down the wall. So, he could have seen Bran contact Daenerys and know all he had to do was wait for her arrival. He would know when she was about to arrive through the eyes of Bran and would know when to precisely start attacking Jon and his men to make the perfect scenario to try and kill one of the dragons. The season finale could even have touched more on this, allowing Bran and the Night King to communicate with each other, and letting Bran know the Night King can see through him, and that Bran might be able to do the same, making Bran massively important in the final season.

&amp;#x200B;

6) Bran's fall as Viserion

As Bran, warged as Viserion, and Daenerys arrive at the lake the same scenario would more or less go down. However, when the Night King kills Viserion, Bran would still be warged into the dragon. The pain of feeling death and the fall controlling the dragon would mimic his own fall all the way back in Season 1. This pain and re-living this memory could perhaps trigger Bran to not only be the Three-Eyed Raven, but also knock Bran back to being more like his normal self. While he could still in essence see 'everything', this memory would help push the memories of his life as Bran to the forefront of his mind, allowing him to still be himself whilst also being the Three-Eyed Raven.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR - Bran should have been at the forefront of this episode, being the one to warn Daenerys and warg into Viserion to show her the way. The Night King, using his mark he left on Bran, can see everything Bran does, so knew where Daenerys was and when to attack Jon and the others to best be able to kill a dragon. The death of Viserion, warged by Bran, would have helped Bran re-live the memory of his fall and make himself back to the old Bran whilst still being the Three-Eyed Raven. Jaime should have been with the group and Jorah should have died.",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I for one fall in-between the two, as I love the interactions between many of the characters who are meeting for the first time, as well as watching in awe at some of the amazing action this episode contains. However, what disappoints me about this episode is some of the glaring plot holes and bad writing not normally familiar with Game of Thrones. So this post is going to highlight some of these issues in writing and how they could have been improved/avoided, as well as talking about improvements to the episode as a whole.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. This post will not cover the Winterfell story line with Arya and Sansa, which in my opinion just wasn't great.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Jaime Lannister should have been part of the suicide squad.**

After Bronn miraculously saved Jaime's life from Drogon's fire, he fell into the lake to drown - his armour pulling him to the floor of the lake. Somehow, Bronn managed to single-handily (pun intended) drag Jaime to dry land unseen, away from all the Dothraki that had just surrounded them. What would have made more sense would have been if Jaime was captured by Daenerys and held as a high-level prisoner, as she could use him to try and take King's Landing peacefully from Cersei. Hell, Jamie could even have been directly used to tell Cersei about the armistice Daenerys had proposed. However, once the plan to go north of the wall and capture a wight had been agreed, sending Jaime along with the crew would have made perfect sense. If he died during the mission Daenerys wouldn't really care - he was the person who murdered her father and in effect put the killer blow into the Targaryen reign of the Seven Kingdoms. Plus he wouldn't be able to escape anywhere, as the land beyond the wall is open and freezing, so if Jaime was to run away he would more than likely get lost and freeze to death. But, the main reason to take him would be that if the mission was to fail and they couldn't catch a wight, then Jaime, the only person who Cersei trusts, would be able to tell her what he saw. Also, this would lead to some pretty cool interactions between Jaime and Daenerys after the battle back at the wall. Jaime would see Daenerys risk her life for everyone and see her distraught after losing one of her dragons, and see that she's not this foreign monster that burned hundreds of his men alive because she's supposedly 'evil' and 'just like her father'. And Daenerys would see Jaime trying to console her and see he's not the dishonourable Kingslayer she first thought. This would also further influence Jaime's decision to leave Cersei for Winterfell in the season finale.

&amp;#x200B;

2. **At least one more person should have died.**

While this is only a small point (we did lose Thoros, Viserion and Benjen after all), I'm of the belief that at least one more person should have bit the bullet in this episode. The three characters that died in this episode weren't really 'big' characters so to say, so the emotional impact didn't really hit viewers that hard. While I don't believe a massive character like Jon or Daenerys should have died, I do believe a character of somewhat importance should have gone in order to really get viewers upset, angry and riled up for the war against the walkers in the final season. My choice for this would have been Jorah Mormont. He could have died a noble death protecting Daenerys from the dead, and it would have brought honour back to his family and house, dying beyond the wall like his father did before him.

&amp;#x200B;

3. **Gendry isn't Mo Farah.**

Gendry being the one to run back to the wall didn't make sense to me. Not only is he not familiar with his surroundings - he is not equipped for them. He was the only one that hadn't seen snow before for crying out loud! What should have happened is the idea should have been suggested, but then the wights would come and surround them on the island before anyone had chance to run off. This would leave a sense of fear and hopelessness in our heroes as they would be in essence waiting for their impending doom. This leads nicely into my next point...

&amp;#x200B;

4. **Bran is supposed to be the most important person in stopping the White Walkers - let him show people why!**

I was seriously disappointed with Bran in Season 7. He literally did nothing but screw Littlefinger over (even though he had zero evidence, so not sure why people would take a child's word as truth) and creeped his sister out. This episode should have shown us why Bran is the strongest character in Game of Thrones. After the squad is trapped on the island, it should have panned out to a group of ravens overlooking in the sky - being controlled by Bran. Now this is where my plot falls a little into the trope of 'writing for tv', but it would be a lot cooler and makes a lot more sense than a raven flying all the way to Dragonstone for Daenerys to fly all the way back to a location she isn't even sure of. Now, Bran would take over the role of a character from the books called Quaithe (she appeared in Season 2 for a couple of episodes) and appear to Daenerys as a 'vision', warning Daenerys of the fate of Jon and the others if she does not ride out to help them, (and yes I know Quaithe more than likely used a Glass Candle to communicate with Daenerys in the books, but they don't exist in the show and I'm sure we can bend the rules a little bit for the Three-Eyed Raven's powers). Daenerys will ask Bran how she is to find them, with Bran responding, ""I'll show you"", before Viserion lets fly and heads off north towards the wall. Bran is now in control of the dragon and will use him to lead Daenerys to Jon (yes I know the Three-Eyed Raven is being made incredibly powerful here, but it's about time Bran showcased some of his powers).

&amp;#x200B;

5. **The Night King's mark on Bran links everything.**

Remember that mark the Night King left on Bran in season 6, that allowed him to enter the Three Eyed Raven's cave - seems to have been forgotten about huh? Well this little forgotten detail is the thing for me that could solve the most annoying plot hole in this episode - why the wights just waited around doing nothing. I know the show basically stated it was because the lake wasn't frozen over so they couldn't reach them, and only after they realised it had re-froze over did they start to attack them, but this seems stupid to me. The wights managed to swim when they attached the chain onto a dead Viserion, and earlier in the episode two wights that had fallen into the lake re-emerged to try and pull Tormund into the lake with them. No, the reason why the Night King and the wights should have held off their attack was due to his mark that was left on Bran.

Rewatching the series and I'm trying to piece together House Dayne. We know they're important because they've been mentioned a lot for seemingly no reason. We are all pretty sure Dawn will play a role in the end, but who will wield it?
We know very little about Ashara Dayne. She was at the tourney of Harrenhal in 281 where she danced with a few guys and Sir Barristan believes she was dishonored. 283 she allegedly jumps to her death. People speculate she could have had a baby, we know its not Jon Snow. 

Here's what I think:
Brandon Stark knocked her up at the tourney of Harrenhal. (Stay with me) I examined the guys Ashara spoke with during the tourney. Although they did not dance, Brandon was the one who got her to dance with Ned, so there was contact. What we know about him: He was known to have taken Barbery Dustin's maidenhead. He did not want to marry Catlin Tully. He was fiery, not so like his brother. I think he fits the bill for ""dishonoring"" Ashara.
Then Rhaegar runs off with Lyanna, he goes to Kings Landing where the mad king murders him and his father. 282

Ashara ""jumps to her death"" shortly thereafter in 283.

I believe she did have a baby. Another one who we wonder how he fits into this story (This is where it falls apart, stay with me) Podrick Payne. Now, he is supposedly Sansa's age more than Jon's, but he's a bit of a mystery and we've been lied to before. And everything we know about him is from him, there's no ties, nobody to confirm or deny. And the only person I've found with an uncertain year of birth. Described as a stumble tongue but no fool. In season 5 he tells Brienne he was squiring for sir Lorimer who stole a ham and they were about to be hanged but Tywin spared Pod upon hearing he was a Payne. What if it was Dayne? The only other Payne has no tongue so he's not telling. 
Skilled enough in swordsmanship to save Tyrion on the Blackwater and Brienne when she was attacked on the road looking for Sansa. And in my opinion, one of the only characters with the potential of being seen as worthy enough to be the Sword of the Morning. He has yet to be knighted, but when he is, he will rise to Dawn.

Tin foil? Or plausible?

Im trying to put together a list of plot threads that Id like answered in Season 8, its based on prophecies that have yet to be answered in the show, narrative arcs that have yet to be addressed and some major theories that have some logical integrity. Note this isnt about the primary plot so theres nothing about the Night kings motives, various babies or who will end up on the Iron Throne, just background stuff that hasnt been fully explained or addressed. If you guys have good suggestions Ill add them.

Prophecies:

\- Is anyone Azor Ahai?

\- Is anyone The Prince that was Promised?

\- Will these end up being the same person?

\- Do Quaithes ramblings mean anything?

\- Will Cersai be killed by the Valonqar and who will it be?

Narrative Set-ups:

\- What will happen Jon's heritage is revealed?

\- Will Arya complete her list?

\- Will it be revealed what the voice in the flames said to Varys?

\- Will Sam find a use for Heartsbane?

\- Will the fact that Melisandre is an old hag be addressed?

\- Will Jons death an resurrection be addressed?

Major Theories:

\- Will Tyrion be a secret Lannister?

\- Will Bran be the mastermind behind the entire plot?",19,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I know there have been theories going around that Mance Rayder is Rhaegar and probably countless others. But what about if he's a faceless assassin--Jaqen H'ghar? Or just still alive-- under the radar?? (radar/Rhaegar...lol)

\--It's been shown in the show that rubies can change your appearance drastically with Melisandre

\--Rhaegar's ""rubies"" were mentioned in the show in season 1 by Arya, when she wanted to go look for them with the bucher's boy on the trident

\--H'ghar/Rhaegar...worth noting at least

\--When Arya named him as one of her 3 names, he acted afraid-- a trait I do not associate with that character. Why? I don't know how this relates but it seems suspicious.

\--In the books I don't think his body was ever found (not sure about the tv show)

\--He was known to have all of a sudden become a knight when he was always a gentle guy who liked to sing and read, after reading about a prophecy he had to fulfill (mentioned by Barriston in one of the seasons)- could this have to do with the lord of light, tying him to Melisandre somehow (who can bring people back to life)

\--It been said a few times that there will be a huge twist at the end. The actor who plays Jaime has even said some of it he didn't understand but ""all of the pieces came together"". That could mean a lot of different things. But the whole show has been talking about prophecy and Rhaegar. Why would they keep mentioning this character, who has never even been alive in the show or book?

\--It would make sense for it to be Jaqun, since he always seemed to be around for Arya, who has been said to look and act like Lyanna.

There are other reasons that could back this up.

No one is expecting this. I think that's the reason why I like it so much.

The implication is that magicians can just 'do' magic whilst the priests perform godly miracles. The reason this interests me because it questions whether gods are actual corporeal beings in the GoT universe or whether they're abstract concepts that people attirbute miracles to (think of how an athiest considers religion in our world).

Conceptually it's a very weird idea that some magic is divine whilst some is not, it makes more sense that it's either all divine or none of it is. If this idea is correct then either all magicians get their power from the gods or priest's magic isn't divine, it's just normal magic dressed up as something fancy.

Consider that we've seen three different ways to raise the dead in the show, Red Priest's divine power, the Night king's magic (which could come from the great other but has never been explained) and Qyburn's 'science'. Are all three doing the work of the gods or are all three doing something else that each character interprets according to their own beliefs? 

Next consider the changing of your appearance, the Faceless men can do this, as can Melisandre. This is, essentially, the same trick but accomplished different ways with the power attributed to a god (the lord of light and the many faced god). Is this divine power from two different gods or is it a magic trick which has been attributed to a god as an explanation of how it works?

Finaly we have Stannis' magic king's blood. What made his blood magic? Was it magic before Robert's rebellion or before Robert died? if not then is a godly being sitting somewhere making decisions about who is the rightful King (shouldn't it be Jon who has the magic King's blood in that case?). Wouldn't it make more sense if melisandre was just doing magic that she attributed as devine according to her own personal beliefs?

What I'm getting at is i don't think magic is divine and that the gods in GoT are just abstract concepts that people use to expain that which they don't understand, i.e. there are no gods in GoT, just religion. if this is the case then there is no Lord of Light, there is no Great Other or Seven or old gods or any of the others that have been mentioned, it's just in this world magic exists.

This has huge implications for the show, there is no great war between the light and dark, it's just two opposed groups in conflict with logical motivation on both sides.

What do you guys think, do gods exist in GoT?

""i think lyanna is gonna take jon snow as her bride""

*Cersei's first thought after taking out the Sept is to go torment Unella and not check on her son whose wife was just erased.  I imagine after her scene of watching the aftermath of the Sept, that she grabbed her wine and took off sprinting towards the dungeon and yelling at people to get out of her way.  She could have probably prevented Tommen from killing himself but Cersei gonna Cersei.

*Joffrey after being asked by Sansa if he will slay Stannis himself.  Joffrey's reply ""If Stannis is fool enough to come near me"" gets me because he says it with so much insecurity.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm warning you, for those who haven't seen season 7, there will be spoilers so **stop reading now if you don't wanna be spoiled!**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So, I was just rewatching season 7 and I realized that during the first episode, Cersei tells Jaime that Tyrion is now on Dany's side and that he is Hand of the Queen. That's cool but I don't get how she learned that? How can Cersei know that?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, when Tyrion is explaining to Dany and co. how they will attack Westeros, he tells everybody that the Unsullied will attack Casterly Rock. He says something along these lines: ""Cersei believes that my sole purpose is to destroy my family. They will be waiting for us. They will be ready"". So, he's basically saying that he knows Cersei is aware that he is now working with Daenerys.

&amp;#x200B;

How the hell can he know Cersei is aware that he is with Daenerys and therefore, that he will try to take Casterly Rock? 

&amp;#x200B;

Does somebody have some kind of logic explaination for that? I feel like this plot hole is worst than the WW chains...

1. Tyrions beast mode: in the battle of Green Fork and at the Blackwater, Tyrion goes Marshawn Lynch in the books and GRRM talks about him forgetting himself in the moment of bloodlust. In the books, he doesnt even make it into battle at Green Fork and then at Blackwater he kills a couple people because he sneaks up on them, but it ends pretty quickly. 

2. Renlys portrayal: in the books, everyone (Ned specifically) looks at Renly and sees a young Robert (huge, strong, powerful). The show doesnt really portray him as being strong and also shows him hating the sight of blood and hunting. Neither of those were the case in the show.

I gradually begin to piece together  what has happened in Westeros over the previous five episodes and try  not to look like Im freaking out.   - James Hibberd Entertainment Weekly!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this hasn't been already talked about, but this quote stuck out the most for me in the Entertainment Weekly piece. I thought it might be fun to speculate on which characters in the finale he might be talking about. Who might show up that we might not expect? I think of characters that are still alive, or at least have the slight possibility of aliveness, and yet who haven't been around in a while, or their story is presumed over. 

There are a few characters who I consider less surprising but more acceptable:

1.  Jaqen H'ghar  
2. Daario Naharis 
3. Edmure Tully 

Another few characters that would be more surprising, but in turn, much bigger longshots:

1. Syrio Forel (possibly Jaqen)
2. Ellaria Sand (since we presume she's dead by now or shackled.. but we aren't ENTIRELY sure she's gone)
3. Khal Drogo (prophecies....)

And now for a completely bonkers, wtf, stab in the dark couple of predictions:

1. Rhaegar Targaryen (AGAIN possibly Jaqen?) 
2. Stannis. (for the record, i'm not a ""Stannis is still alive"" conspiracy gal, totally not, but we are throwing around the craziest possible people here)

1245,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-11-17,2018,11,17,6,9xqhhj,self.gameofthrones,[SPOILERS] Is incest really a sin in Game of Thrones?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/9xqhhj/spoilers_is_incest_really_a_sin_in_game_of_thrones/,kman273,1542404214,"So just to start off, I want to make this very clear: this post is about how the story of Game of Thrones, both in the books and in the show, have portrayed incest as a sin in the eyes of the GoT gods, whomever they are. And then in s7 Jon fucks Dany, neither knowing what they have just done. I realize this is very late, but it has been nagging me ever since that episode premiered. 

From what I understood so far through the show and through the books (mostly through with Clash of Kings), incest is a sin in the GoT universe and those who commit incest will not only be cursed, but so will the rest of family. That's why the Targaryean family fell apart and their kingdom collapsed. Sure it took hundreds of years, but then you throw in how fucked Cersei and Jaime are mentally (Cersei wanting to be a man so she can be respected by her father and gain the power she wants + the prophecy thing; Jaime's issues with fulfilling his father's dream of Jaime ruling + the whole Kingslayer thing). Both of them are deeply troubled despite seemingly having the perfect life. Their relationship started when they were kids as Jaime recalls (it was somewhere in the books), possibly even before Cersei receives the prophecy. These are two clear cut examples of how incest would eventually come back to haunt these people.

Now, i get that the whole thing that Jon and Dany don't know what they are committing. But then how are they (meaning the writers) going to address that when it comes to these two finding out they committed incest? Unless they somehow show that it negatively effects them/their ""family"" (maybe they both die in s8?), it essentially negates the previous notion that incest is a sin in GoT universe. I mean, how else can one interpret the 2 characters whom ""the gods"" seem to have the strongest influence/connection to (bringing back Jon from the dead and giving Dany 3 dragons from dead dragon eggs), finding their true love through incest? Wouldn't that mean that these exact gods that cursed the Targaryeans and the Lannisters are all of a sudden now completely fine, in fact *encouraging*, incest? ",27,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

And being that Viseryon (sp?) has died in a sense, leaving Rhaegon (Rhaegar) and Drogon (suggested to be Dany's ""main"" dragon) still living, may foreshadow their survival.

But on rewatching s6 and s7, I just can't see it. At first, sure it might work, but it doesn't make sense to me for the waif to try and take over not just Arya's life, but her revenge plots as well. Would the waif really give a crap about going to kill Walder Frey and Cersei? You'd think she'd go straight to Winterfell if she really wanted to become Arya (for whatever reason she'd even want that) to take back her life, but she really hesitates when deciding whether to go to King's Landing or Winterfell.

And how would she have known about Hot Pie, since Arya goes to visit him after leaving Braavos? I doubt Arya ever talked about him to anyone. It's a fun theory, but just doesn't add up.

Also, who's face was that on the wall if not the waif's? It sure looked like her and unless the waif had a twin and killed her for her face, it just doesn't make sense.

Am I missing something that makes this more likely that it seems? I haven't reread the books in a while so maybe there's more background that would back up this theory there, but from the show's perspective, I can't make it work.",23,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Now the iron bank is something that's been talked about in Game of Thrones for a long time, but we specifically saw it come up in the first season with one of Ned's first scenes with the small Council. So it's important and I also think it's important to note that you have Bravos, and that's the city where the Iron bank is located as well as the Faceless Men. Now here's where it gets interesting.

Specifically, Syrio is the first sword of bravos, but why is he in King's Landing and why is he just a dancing master being an important man in Bravos? Well I think that Syrio is actually a faceless man and he is in King's Landing to Spy, kill, just get close to the small Council, or king and queen because of all if the debt the crown owes. The best way to do this and what he did was to disguise himself. So he became a dancing master because the Hand of the king needed one to train his daughter. Well in him hiring Syrio forel give Syrio that chance to be in the castle close to the king and queen.

Now Syrio's plan was cut short when all the drama happened with Neds betrayal, and he is forced to fight some of the kingsguard. Well it is supposed he is killed off screen by MT, but we actually never see this. Also he didn't kill any people of the kingsguard because he had a wooden sword, so there's really no reason to kill him so I think that MT just took him prisoner.

So basically I think that Syrio is Jaqen h'ghar. When see jaqen h'ghar for the first time he has his face covered possibly because he's either still Syrio or he just made his transition to jaqen and he's got his face covered to hide it from the audience. I think at this point he is already plotting to escape and get back to Bravos when he recognizes Arya and from that point on the rest is history.

Now here's where everything comes into play. When Arya goes to Bravos Jaquen knows about her list. What's interesting is when they were in harrenhal he told Arya that she can give him three names and he will kill them. Well he's not allowed to take people because the faceless God didn't command it so why does he do this? I think it's only hinting at the parallels between Arya's list and The Faceless Men having lists in a similar way. I think it's interesting to note that the waif is asking her who's on her list and she specifically says are you sure that's all the people you want to kill because she potentially knows Cersei is on that list.

I think the faceless men let Arya go because Cersei is on her list of names and she is now Queen and since the debt is owed by the crown to the iron bank, they know that she's going to go kill Cersei which is what they want. Remeber that's what they want Jaqen was in KL in the first place. I think that he's sending our in his place this time to do it, and it's perfect for her story arc of getting the names crossed off her list.

The Faceless Men knew MT was going to be in Bravos, they wanted her to see he was there. When she did kill him and she mentioned that he killed her friend Syrio, she shoved something in his mouth so he couldn't talk. I thonk this is because if he did he might have told that he actually didn't kill him. The writers did this on purpose just like everything else. 

Cersei's conversation with the man from the iron bank was a little sketchy so I don't think everything's going to go in her favor in season 8. I don't think she paid back the iron bank, and I think she took that money and bought the gold company instead. Or she did pay the debt back, and then borrowed more from the iron bank to buy the gold company, and she's tells them that when she wins the war she will pay it back but we know that she's probably going to lose and they know it too. However you want to look at it they want her gone.

So I think in the end Arya will mark the last time off her list and kill Cersei. Possibly even using Jamie's face to fulfill the profecy. It also makes sense of why George RR Martin thought of the faceless men in the first place just for this purpose.

A Lannister Always Pays his debts is their famous quote but I think in the end that will backfire. The Faceless Men, the iron bank, Arya's list Jaqen, and Syrio, and her finishing her training, Cersie being killed will all be tied together quite nicely. 

There is so much more I can say to tired all of this in further detail, but I'm tired now. Hope it made sense.

This is just MY personal opinion on how it will end, if you dont agree with what I say that is fine but I just wanted to let you know that so hopefully you wont be too hard on me 2. I have been starting to rewatch the series and picking up some of the forshadowing I missed from all the seasons, so dont expect anything crazy (unless that crazy thing was forshadowed), and finally 3. I will be doing a short summary of what I think will happen in S8, not a full prediction though I tried that in the past with no good results, so it will just be a short summary nothing more and nothing less. This is about the endgame. Okay so lets get into our short summary on my Predictions for season 8 (and yes its an outline so I dont get in trouble):

-	So anyways Tormund and Beric ride off to WF after informing Edd of what just happened as Castle Black gets attacked (as well as Bear Island (via Ice Dragon), Karhold, and the Last hearth not long after), J&amp;D and co. arrive at WF and Northerners are not happy to see Jon after bending the knee including Sansa and Arya (Sansa for obvious reasons and Arya because he gave up the title of king and is trusting the Lannisters), Not long after Jaime with Bronn, Edmure, and Tully/Frey Bannermen arrive at WF and Jon confronts Arya about the bag of faces where Arya explains her time with the FM and also how she was just testing Sansa/Pushing her into not trusting LF. 
-	Cersei has a miscarriage and Theon goes after Euron after learning of his lie via a dying Damphair, Jon learns the truth and later the first battle against the dead occurs with Euron and the GC surprise attacking WF and taking one of the main characters hostage, Theon sneaks onto the ship and saves Yara and they come in at the last minute to help evacuate everyone when the dead arrive at WF (oh and Jon loses Longclaw), Mel reveals herself and sacrifices herself doing something epic to hold off the dead and Jaime dies saving Arya and Bran.
-	at Riverrun Tyrion creates a plan for Arya, Gendry, Theon, Sandor, Brienne, and Varys to sneak into KL and save the main character and kill Cersei, Arya kills Cersei, Theon dies killing Euron, Harry Strickland and the GC changes sides, Sandor wins CLEGANEBOWL with help from Arya but he dies not long after from bloodlose, and Qyburn pretends to change sides. Bran reveals the NK backstory and why the WWs returned (which is due to a resurgence in magic, Jons birth, and being threatened by the Red God). Jon accepts who he is, is given Heartsbane, and Dany shortly before the battle survives childbirth to twins.

Okay now I got that short summary out of the way lets get into my predictions on how I think the series will end:

The final battle I believe will be at KL with Dance of the Dragons 2.0 with J&amp;D fighting the NK in the skies above and on the ground all there armies fighting the dead and the White Walkers while Arya and Gendry evacuates the citizens of KL and any who cant fight (but Ill be focusing on Jon, Dany, and the NK) NK and Viserion will kill Dany and Drogon and Jon and Rhaegal will continue to fight NK and Viserion but Rhaegal will die finally destroying the undead Viserion as the two crash land near either the Gods Eye or the Dragonspit, Jon will fight the NK with Heartsbane, with Bran having a battle of the minds with the NK. After Arya evacuates everybody she will go to Bran and Bran will reveal that he has to die in order for the NK to be weakened, Arya at first does not want to but Bran tells her it must be done for the greater good and she puts Catspaw through Brans heart killing him.

The NK is weakened and Jon disarms him and with help from Sam removes the Dragonglass from his chest, making him die a mortal man as all the Wights collapse and the WWs turn back to human form (oh and wildfire was set off in areas of KL killing off both Wights and some of the living (including some main characters)). The Iron Throne is melted down and the kingdoms are dividing into there own independent kingdoms again with an implication of a Proto-Democratic Government/Republic in the future for some of them. Sam and Gilly get the Reach, A likeable Sand Snake is given Dorne, new houses receive Iron Islands and Stormlands, Tyrion is given the Westerlands and opens a vineyard with Jorah, Edmure gets back the Riverlands, Robin keeps the Vale, and either Sansa gets the North with Arya and Gendry sailing West of Westeros or (if Sansa dies) Arya is given The North and marries Gendry (with Gendry taking the Stark name), the now human WWs return beyond the former wall, ICE is reforged, and is given the Crownlands with Davos as his hand (raising his twin children on his own). Finally Sam writes the Song of Ice and Fire..Oh and Qyburn has fled Westeros and is never heard from again, he is presumed dead.",13,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

------

The  Hound  unlatches  his  cart  from  the  donkey,  and  turns  to his  Lannister  guard.

HOUND

Anyone  touches  it,  Ill  kill  you first.

Sometimes,  being  a  Lannister  guard  is  just  no  fun  at  all.

-------

Without  hesitation,  Cersei  heads  toward  her  seat,  veering toward  Jons  side  of  the  Dragonpit. Jon  watches  her,  trying  not  to  look  out  of  his  element. Jaime  passes  right  by  Brienne.  His  expression  asks  her  what the  hell  shes  doing  here,  but  unfortunately  this  is  a question  her  expression  is  incapable  of  answering. 

-------

Jaime  is  still  looking  at  Brienne. Cersei  notices  Jaime  looking  at  Brienne. Brienne  looks  away,  too  late. Cersei  looks  to  Jaime,  who  is  saved  from  having  to  explain this  by  a  familiar  cry  that  comes  from  above,  and  the  sound of  beating  wings.

-------

EURON 

Theon, I  have  your  sister.  If  you dont  submit  to  me  here  and  now, Ill  kill  her.

Tyrion  looks  to  Jaime:  who  the  fuck  is  this  guy?  Jaime's expression  tells  him  that  Jaime  is  not  a  fan. 

------

CERSEI

 My  armies  will  not  stand  down.  I will  not  pull  them  back  to  the capital. (beat) I  will  march  them  north,  to  fight alongside  you  in  the  Great  War. The  darkness  is  coming  for  us  all. We  will  face  it  together. 
 
This  is  the  last  thing  anyone  expected  to  hear.  Dany  and  Jon both  look  at  Tyrion. Tyrion  meets  their  gaze  with  a  subtle  expression:  Tyrion Lannister,  motherfuckers.

------

She  weighs  her  choice,  then  says  to  Jorah 

DANY 

Ive  not  come  to  conquer  the  North. Im  coming  to  save  the  North.

She  turns  to  Jon. 

DANY 

We  sail  together.

Jon  doesnt  quite  smile  because  smiling  would  seem inappropriate.  But  still,  that  almost  looks  like  a  smile. 

Jorah  nods  in  deference.  But  hes  not  smiling  at  all.  Fucking punkass  little  shitburger  stole  my  khaleesi!

-----

THEON 

Shes  our  queen-- 

HARRAG 

Shes  your  sister.  And  you  left  her to  die.

The  men  nod.  Little  shit  abandoned  his  own  sister. 

------

Harrag  spits  in  his  face,  a  great  gob  of  slimy,  Ironborn spittle. 

-----

Clutching  Theons  face  in  his  big,  dirty  hands,  Harrag  slams his  knee  into  Theons  groin. But  Theon  has  no  balls. Just  the  slightest  possible  smile  from  Theon,  as  he  receives his  first  ever  benefit  from  castration. He  slams  his  forehead  into  Harrags  nose,  the  single  greatest headbutt  in  the  history  of  filmed  headbutts.   

-----

Sansa  stands  alone,  staring  across  the  snow-shrouded  moors. She  wears  a  hood  to  protect  her  from  the  wind  and  the  snow, making  her  look  like  the  French  Lieutenants  Woman,  a reference  Sophie  Turner  will  just  have  to  Google. We  dont  have  access  to  her  interior  monologue,  but  were looking  at  Dark  Sansa  here,  that  much  is  clear.   


-----
SANSA 

You  had  Aunt  Lysa  send  a  letter  to our  parents,  telling  them  it  was the  Lannisters  who  murdered  Jon Arryn.  When  really  it  was  you. 

Littlefinger  is  one  of  the  coolest  cucumbers  in  the  garden, but  even  he  starts  to  sweat  now.  His  prosecutor  is  armed  with information  she  cannot  possibly  know. 

-----

and this one is not funny at all:

EXT.  EASTWATCH,  NORTH  SIDE  OF  THE  WALL 

Emerging  from  the  frozen  coastal  forest,  the  ARMY  OF  THE  DEAD comes  in  force.  All  of  them,  100,000  strong,  with  hundreds  of WHITE  WALKER  officer  corps  on  their  dead  horses.

I didn't understand why at first, until I read the books. 

Aegon the Conqueror demonstrated on the field of fire that his purpose in battle was not to eliminate all enemies, but to make the commanders yield. He did this on the field of fire by burning the fields around the armies rather than obliterating the armies to make short work of the battle. 

Danaerys on the Field of Fire 2.0 (The Spoils of War) demonstrates that she did not understand Aegon's strategy on the field of fire. She burned everyone to death because they wore red cloaks.

Aegon the Conqueror managed to conquer the Seven kingdoms, but not Dorne. Dorne came in to the Seven kingdoms with the wedding of Danaerys I (I think.... right?!).

Danaerys Targaryen, instead of helping Jon Snow when he came to Dragonstone on her own invitation, refuses to give Jon Snow any aid until he bends his knee; even though The North is in clear and immediate danger. Danaerys doesn't seem to have any interest in listening to what Jon and Davos have to say. She doesn't seem very Diplomatic, does she?

Danaerys is basing her queenship on her father's name. Aerys the Mad King, could not defend the realm against rebels like other Targaryen Kings before him. Doesn't incapability kind of forfeit the Targaryens right to the Iron Throne?

That being said, Danaerys is not entitled to the help of the Seven Kingdoms like her ancestors were. She is not diplomatic like Aegon the Conqueror was, and she is entitled and arrogant.

Please be nice, I tried to compile my thoughts on why I don't like Danaerys instead of just saying she's not smart. ",6,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

While it is true that if the dead win the battle in the north they will consume Daenery's men into their army and become too powerful for anyone to stop, as Jaime warns, Cersei is counting on Daenerys winning instead, which seems more likely since she has two dragons.

And if the living win, their army will be depleted rather than stronger, unlike the white walkers, meaning Cersei and her golden company of 20k men and elephants (that she was considerate enough to furnish a ruse early on so she could have Euron ferry with his fleet while everyone thinks he ran) as well as her remaining Lannister soldiers will definitely outnumber them at this point, so that she can march and destroy them, as well as the dragons (if they're both even still alive at this point) using a quite plausible armada of ballistas ( we've seen just one to be able to seriously harm a dragon) , which I presume will have been mass produced by then.

Hence why she is deciding to not let Jaime take her army north and instead let the others fight, rather than just helping them and trusting that they won't kill her afterwards, which would be **foolish.**

And Jaime didn't take the Lannister soldiers, btw, or else we would have seen him leave King's Landing with a battalion at his back rather than alone. So, besides losing her lover, she's not in THAT much danger even still.

She is the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, after all, and heir to Casterly Rock. Lannister Soldiers = with Cersei. Not to mention the formidable Queen's Guard - they are underestimated nowadays, and I don't think anyone is aware of quite what they will do before someone can usurp a monarch who currently has ZERO chances of being assassinated from the inside thanks to the propaganda of Daenery's terrorism, practically affording Cersei the love of the people.

In conclusion, **she's pathing a logical route towards victory, and it's the same thing Tywin would have done.** People need to stop saying that Cersei is nothing like her father, because she is a highly calculative and rightfully dangerous villain. Quite frankly, the only way it goes wrong for her from here is bad luck. She's a strong, experienced ruler, and is not to be underestimated.

After all, what happened the last times she was underestimated?

And as for the notion that the Golden Company will betray her due to their lore in the books, for which their reasoning can narrowly be summed up to ""they will take the gold and switch sides to Daenerys because under the Targaryens they weren't exiled, and a Targaryen in power means their exile ends."" First of all, what if Daenerys loses? Which, according to the above, has a pretty good chance of happening, when if they stay by Cersei, she will, by logic most likely win.

I tried searching online for these ideas, but I didn't see them explicitly mentioned.

Regarding Howland Reed, I always thought it was interesting that he showed up to the Tournament at Harrenhal that was the moment that set this entire series into motion. Then I realized that it was no chance encounter. Howland had just been at the Isle of Faces and I believe that he was explicitly told to be at Harrenhal so that he could be there to be defended by Lyanna Stark. It was due to this encounter that Lyanna decided to enter the tournament as the Knight of the Laughing Tree, which led Raegar to search for that knight, instead finding Lyanna and either falling in love with her or seeing that she was the key to his plan to bring about Azor Ahai. I also believe that Bran intentionally was cold to Meera when she said she was going back Greywater Watch. He needed to ensure that she would return there and perhaps bring her father to Winterfell. I have a feeling that we will see Howland Reed in season 8. Also his presence at the Tower of Joy was surely predicted. He knew he would have to stab Sir Arthur Dayne in the back (neck technically) in order to make sure Ned could protect Jon Snow.

Now for Benjen Stark. This is a quick and easy one. I have seen some people think that Bran told Benjen where Jon would be when he almost drowned, but I think it was actually something Bloodraven had told him before he died. Part of being a greenseer is seeing visions, and Bloodraven would have known that Jon would be in the water at that moment. Rather than being an easy plot recovery for the writers it actually fits in tightly with the narrative that has built up over 7 seasons/5 books. Also, as a side note, I don't think Benjen is gone. We are going to see him south of the wall in Season 8 now that the wall has been destroyed at Eastwatch by the sea.

TLDR: Howland Reed was told to go the the Tournament at Harrenhal, Benjen saved Jon Snow because Bloodraven had told him where to be.",7,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

It's insane that we had a battle with so many beloved characters on both sides and didn't lose anyone important. 

Mostly, it would have been the best way for Bronn to go. Drawn back out of the comfortable life he earned, gambling once more to advance himself, snuffed out by chance. I wish he got to have his ""Mercutio"" moment-like ""a plague on both your houses"" but with a bunch of ""cunts"" peppered in there. 

What really bothered me was that they seemed to have saved him solely to use as a plot device to bring Tyrion and Jaime back together.

Weirwoods supposedly have the souls  of all the Children of the Forest and all those that are of The Old Gods. Lots of Magic. So could this be a way for at least the show to have a way of forging Lightbringer or its equivalent? 

Jon uses the mouth slot of a Werewood, sticks his Valyrian Sword into it and the blood sap of the tree coats sword and he flames it up and it bonds with sword. Only thing that can go thru Night King. Sounds a bit sexual but so did the original forging.

Now whether it is any Weirwood or maybe those at The Gods Eye that are under some magical protection, or maybe the actual tree that the Night King was tied to as he was turned. 
This is a theory of mine that sorta makes sense and a way for the show to go about it. The NightKings Kryptonite, what the Tree giveths it also can take a way.

I havent read Fire &amp; Blood. There are no intentional spoilers for Fire &amp; Blood. It is coming out on the 20th, hence the 20 questions I hope to find answers for in the book. 

Q01. What happened to Valyria? 

Judging by various hints and GRRM prior works, Id say: Nuclear explosion. Why is it relevant for the books? Look at the image that Sam and Ginny discuss in Sn 7. Notice how the mines at Dragonstone are presented as the main feature on that mini map. I suspect Valyrians used slaves to mine for some radioactive material. Dragonstone is probably built on something similar. References to heat in Dragonstone dungeons and dreams of awaking dragons from stone. I suspect the books end with Dany detonating the obsidian at DS. The resulting explosion and waves destroy Pentos in the East and half of Westeros. The resulting tsunami and earthquakes will reshape the world. Remember Eurons words on reshaping. Other references to waters covering the earth. Druids believed that the world would end with fire and water. I believe thats where GRRM is going: the world is half-destroyed by the waters coming from fire, the nuclear explosion on Dragonstone.

Q02. Why Dragonstone?

Were dragons raised on DS? Why did it have to be DS? Did they need the radioactive heat of DS mines/obsidian? Was there a hatchery? Where specifically did dragons live? Hatch? Castle or mines? Why Targaryens chose DS? 

Q03. Role of Valyrian steel. 

At [https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/9t2ekc/spoilers\_extended\_valyrian\_steel\_weapons\_as/](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/9t2ekc/spoilers_extended_valyrian_steel_weapons_as/) I suggest Valyrian steel having a mind of sort. Influencing mind, whispering into minds of weapon wielders. Or serving as some kind of memory. See the post for details. Fire &amp; Blood specific moments where it could manifest: strange behavior of Maegor when Blackfyre and later Dark Sister are taken away. It seems like he lost a guide. 

Q04. Targaryen triangle: genes, dragons, and Valyrian steel

Is there interaction between a mind of Targaryen and Valyrian steel? They mind-bend with dragons, of sort. Is there Valyrian steel  dragon interaction? Does Valyrian armor serve as some kind of military instructor, a library of older battles that Valyrian fought? Mind-bending with dragon: does Valyrian steel have anything to do with it? Remember there is something resembling Valyrian steel on Eurons supposed Dragon Binder horn. 

Q05. Targaryens Genetics

Not agreeing with all particular of Preston Jacobs videos, I would grant that largely the story of Targaryens is genetics. All mentions of, say, somebody was good at sword fighting and martial arts. It doesnt matter that much that it was particular sword fighting, what matters is that there are some traits that some Targaryens had and some didnt. See [https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/9wre7j/spoilers\_extended\_what\_are\_targaryens/](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/9wre7j/spoilers_extended_what_are_targaryens/) Some careful analysis of repeated traits might reveal some pattern. Preston is trying it for dragon hatching trait, but I dont agree with the conclusions. Applaud the attempt, though. See Q08 for mine. 

Q06. Targaryens, Super Humans, and Free Will

Will we see moments when Ts look like they are influenced, mind-controlling, not quite free in their decisions, etc.? Does Valyrian steel mind influence them? Does their genes, their blood, their unique hormones control them in a sense? I consider Targaryens as a race of super humans (Nietzsche Overman kind) produced, not intentionally, but through evolution of sort, to stamp outstanding generals, leaders, martial art champions, etc. The combination of genes that allowed the development, the process, it came, however, with unintended side effects. Such as sudden activation of genetic code that requires a Targaryen to seek a Targaryen to reproduce. And overall override of normal humanity. See what happens with Daenerys in the last chapter. 

Q07. Will we see moments when a Targaryen suddenly change his behavior, especially who he loves? Find another Targaryen to marry: is it a policy or something deeper, a genetic command most Targaryens cant refuse? Does it come suddenly? Does it come at a certain age, like puberty in humans? 

Q08. Significance of female Targaryens. Dragons dont have gender. Targaryens do. And under the influence of the Westerosi culture they adopted, their king takes the policy of son over daughter. Yet, as I argue in [https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/9wre7j/spoilers\_extended\_what\_are\_targaryens/](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/9wre7j/spoilers_extended_what_are_targaryens/) , possibly the secret genetic condition that Preston Jacobs was aiming to find is: being a Targaryen female born from a union of Targaryen sister and brother. Like Daenerys. There are so few female Targaryens. Is Fire &amp; Blood going to explore why? There are even fewer satisfying the condition above. Their succession rules favored men, but their entire survival, unknowingly to them perhaps, was dependent on having females with a particular gene combination. The tragedy of Dance of Dragons, its main sad outcome is the death of the last dragon mother (before Daenerys Stormborn comes). 

Q09. How does Aegon pray before the conquest? There was a mention of him praying on the night before. He was not particularly religious. Or was he? His visits to Oldtown and interactions with the Faith of Seven suggest he was into the Faith. Valyrians were not too much religious. Perhaps they considered themselves nearly gods. If Aegon was, what is the significance of it? 

Q10. Targaryens and Dorne. See my post earlier today, [https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/9ykkcx/spoilers\_extended\_end\_of\_rhaenys\_targaryen\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/9ykkcx/spoilers_extended_end_of_rhaenys_targaryen_and/) Was there a separate pact between Martells and Targaryens? Why did Ts not attack Sunspear? What was the nature of the threat in Dorias letter that made Aegon agree on peace terms? Why did he have to go to Dragonstone for the night? As I discuss in the post I suspect that either to meet Rhaenys or Martells were threatening eggs, the hatchery on Dragonstone. Most likely Rhaenys was dead from the fall, perhaps her body was returned to DS, but Martells had a credible threat against baby dragon with some Lys poison. See also Q02.

Q11. Targaryens and Martells specifically. They fought. At least Targaryens and Dorne did. Both sides commit atrocities against each other. People suspect Rhaenys was tortured in Ullers dungeons. And yet they are best friends? Such that Doran Martell is devoting his life to Fire and Blood? His son or daughter promised to a Targaryen. After what Rhaegar did to his wife - either unintentionally or, I suspect, fully expecting this outcome. 

Q12. The Iron Throne. Are there Valyrian swords in it? Even if not, the act of its creation, with dragon fire, after spilling rivers of blood  doesnt it turn it into a Valyrian steel of sort? As stated earlier, I suspect Valyrian steel has a mind, a conscience of sort. Similar to the Ring in TLotR. Does Iron Throne mind influence the rulers? Does it explain Maegor the Cruels death? Does it react somehow to Maegors blood? Is the Throne thirsty for blood? Remember for instance the quote about Dark Sister: 

&gt;Dark Sister was made for nobler tasks than slaughtering sheep. She has a thirst for blood. 

I suspect GRRM makes it more than just an expression. That Valyrian swords are capable of desires and inspirations, mostly of bloody type, and that they project those on their wielders, mind-influencing them. 

Q13. Dragons. I dont remember other dragons besides the three at the time of Aegons conquest. Where were the others? Unhatched yet? On Dragonstone? How did Targaryens choose which dragon is his or hers? Did, instead, dragons choose riders? 

Q14. Continuation of Q13 and Q03. Do Targaryens choose their swords or swords choose them? Consider that Visenya wanted Maegor to wield Dark Sister, but he took Blackfyre. What is the significance of this mismatch? Did Blackfyre mind-whisper him? Did it contribute to his madness when both swords were stolen from him? 

Q15. Travel to the North. One of Targaryens landed on top of the Wall. Like didnt cross the border. Is it significant? Does a Targaryen feel the spells under the Wall? Maester Aemon didnt, but a female Targaryen might, who knows. Would crossing the Wall be considered an invasion into the territory of Ice? Any particular reaction to Starks? Following my [https://fractal-affinity.com/got/c18/RhaegarKnew.html](https://fractal-affinity.com/got/c18/RhaegarKnew.html) speculations on Rhaegar, did he choose a Stark to neutralize Targaryen genes? How did he know Stark genes would do that? I suspect the answer to that comes from much later, Dunk and Egg stories, but still there is a chance something is hinted at in Fire &amp; Blood.

Q16. Battle Above the Gods Eye. What is the significance of that particular location? How were Aemonds bones found? I think it is described as a deep lake. How easy is it to find remains and the sword at its bottom? Finding a magical sword in a lake clearly has Arthurian legend connections. Was there any sort of woman involved, who might play the role of lady-of-the-lake? Any old gods links? 

Q17. Western part of Westeros. There are hints that dragons and dragonriders didnt like that part of Westeros. Why? Aegon, however, visited Oldtown several times. (Why?) Did he visit with his dragon? Are there any hints on some radioactive or otherwise special metal in mines around Lannisport? 

Q18. Will Martin risk bringing any hints of sci-fi into the book? For instance, nuclear explosion as the Doom of Valyria? Demons on old Valyrian Road as radiation mutants? Obsidian as some kind of radioactive material? Targaryen procreation policy as an accelerated method of evolution? Valyrian steel as a library of minds, a Matrix of sort? 

Q19. A rhetorical question: Will GRRM insist on the terrible two-truths-and-a-lie format for the second part of Fire and Blood? What I mean is the game that Windrunners sisters play in World of Warcraft: Ill tell you three things, two of them are true. The entire World of Ice and Fire is written in that manner: We know there are lies, but we dont know what they are. What is the point of adding a book of half-truths to the main series of books which is already ripe for speculations and uncountable theories? How would the information from TWoIaF or Fire &amp; Blood help us eliminate some of the theories if we cant trust them? In ASoIaF there are not 100% reliable Points of View, but the difference is: they are Points of View. Knowing *whose* Point-of-view that is, we can deduce psychologically or otherwise where they are not telling the whole truths. There is nothing like that in Fire &amp; Blood. It is a work by Archmaester Gyldayn. We dont know anything about him. I dont want to know anything about him. There is no way we can have a psychological portrait of him to decide where he might lie. **One of the best parts of Ice and Fire  characters!  is discarded completely in TWoIaF approach**, which presumes to relate history. But if you relate history, give us *sources*, actual information. 

Take my earlier post today about Rhaenys in Dorne. We read 

&gt;A few accounts claim the queen survived her dragons fall, only to die a slow death by torment in the dungeons of the Ullers.

Whose accounts?! Based on what sources?! How can we assess the accuracy of that statement if we dont know who makes it? In history of World War I, for instance, wouldnt it matter whose account we deal with: French or German? Armenian or Turkish? Serbian or Austrian? Speaking more of TWoIaF is bad for my blood pressure, so Id better stop. 

Q20. Fire &amp; Blood was announced and promoted as: 

\&gt; complete history of House Targaryen

As I argue at [https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/9xquwu/spoilers\_extended\_end\_of\_targaryens\_grrm\_said/](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/9xquwu/spoilers_extended_end_of_targaryens_grrm_said/) or see permanent version at [https://fractal-affinity.com/got/c18/EndOfTargaryens.html](https://fractal-affinity.com/got/c18/EndOfTargaryens.html) (to be created), *what was GRRM thinking?* I am convinced that there is no house of Targaryen after the end of Ice and Fire, or any other houses, except Starks, perhaps, for that matter. But for many, isnt it a huge spoiler to say that he is writing the *story of House Targaryen*? It means  thats it, when the books (the main series) are finished there is nothing to add to Targaryen story, because Targaryens are dead. (At least their female gene I speculate in Q08. Oh, and the dragons of course - dead.) Daenerys is the last Targaryen. Will there be hints of that in Fire &amp; Blood? ",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Hello guys, I have watched every episode and thoroughly enjoyed the series thus far, however it has been years since I've seen the early episodes and I would love to re-watch them. Not only has it been years but I'm also not the most focused viewer. Don't get me wrong, the show definitely wraps me up in all it's glory, but I'm just bad at noticing details sometimes. As a result I'm sure a lot of the story has gone over my head.

This is why I plan on watching YouTube recaps of every episode after I finish watching that episode. This way ill hopefully retain/pick up on more of the smaller details. Now the problem here is the popular YouTubers I see mentioned often didn't start until season 4 or 5 or something.

Background on my GOT knowledge: I've **only** watched the show. Listen to the Oysters, Clams, and Cockles podcast that goes over the show episode by episode. Things from the books do pop up every once in a while. I've always had a hard time reading a book after seeing the show/movie. One day I may try to read the book series.

Seeing as Fire and Blood is 300 years before Game of Thrones, I am excited to learn more about the Targaryens and their history. I am amazed with how many Goodreads and even Amazon reviews for the book are littered with people complaining that Winds of Winter isn't out yet. I understand the frustration, but why trash on a new book before it even comes out just because it isn't Winds of Winter?

Is anyone excited for this book?",12,1,False,self,,,,,

He was the one who sent Littlefinger to negotiate with Catelyn. And he totally played her too, even though Arya was nowhere to be found, he promised to release her daughters in exchange of releasing Jaime.

In season 4, he has a scene with Sansa, where he talks about how he admired Catelyn's love for her children and how she would do anything to protect them. So he knew Catelyn could agree to his terms even behind Robb's back and it worked out just as he planned. So he made sure that Robb was not gonna know about this too. Just direct face to face conversation between Littlefinger and Catelyn. And he was the one who sent Ned's remains to Catelyn so he could earn her trust. 

Littlefinger actually informed Tywin about this in Harrenhal, so Tywin totally knew that the plan worked but he never gave any credit to Tyrion. Now think about this, the whole Lannister army got their ass kicked by Robb over and over for months, finally they left Jaime there and left Riverlands altogether, and at the end, it was Tyrion's plan that saved Jaime's life.

Considering that Jaime is like Tywin's favorite person in the world, you would expect he will show at least a little bit of appreciation to Tyrion for this, but no credit, just like for his success at the Battle of Blackwater.

Tyrion's short term as the acting hand of the king was very successful in many ways; outing Pycelle, planting Lancel to spy on Cersei, getting rid of Janos Slynt, wildfyre trick, stopping Joffrey from hurting Sansa, putting an end to bad blood with the Martells and starting new diplomacy by sending Myrcella to Dorne, and probably other things.

okay so i've watched the show and rewatched it about a billion times but iv only recently started reading the books.

i'm currently on book 2 (A clash of kings) and have just finished daenerys' house of the undying chapter. Whilst reading I noticed that something was VERY different from the show - A vision where she sees Rhaegar and a woman ,who we now know is Lyanna Stark, with a newborn baby ( Aegon/Jon). ""The song of Ice and Fire""

BUT in the show - after Lyanna has given birth Raeghar is supposedly DEAD at the trident

??????

Now I know that the show differs from the books storyline wise However this is a pretty important Plot given its what really started Rob's Rebellion. Surely George R R Martin would tell the script writers? IDK but if Raeghar IS alive...

Is he jaqen h'ghar??? // syrio forel???

In the show and books Lyanna is Often compared to Arya , Looks AND personality wise. Is this why jaqen had such a close bond with Arya? I Cba going into the theory that jaqen is syrio because its a pretty common theory (which i would LOVE for to be true)

Ive been kicking around the idea in my head that the prince who was promised is going to be more than one person for a while now, but I just had a realization as to how it could be revealed in show and Id like to put it in writing in case Im correct. Id also like to hear what you all have to say about it, for good or ill.

So obviously JS is the prince who was promised as he was born under a bleeding star (dawn) amidst salt and smoke (I dont remember but someone can remind me or one could figure it out), and so on. 

And obviously Daenerys is the PWWP because she was born under a bleeding star (the comet) amongst salt and smoke (the funeral pyre), and so on. 

But I think there will be even more and heres how Id like it to be revealed:

Just before the battle for the dawn, when everyone is huddled in Winterfells great hall, Sam will bring up the PWWP and perhaps suggest that it might be Jon. There will be some laughter and rabble rabble and Bran will cut in saying that it is true: he is the PWWP. He was born in a tower in Dorne with a bloody Dawn at the foot of his bed, blah blah blah. Daeny will look annoyed and maybe someone says something and Bran cuts them off and says and you Daenerys, you are the PWWP. Born under a bleeding star, blah blah. And you Brienn of Tarth, born under blah blah. And you Jamie Lannister... and you Arya... and you Sam... you get the idea. 

Right now Im only naming people who hold Valerian steel, but it doesnt have to be that. The idea is if you answer the call, youre the prince who was promised. 

SUPER corny, I know. But if done right it could be a pretty cool moment. 

Anyway, thanks for listening (or sorry for making you waste your time reading this). ",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

[ Made in plasticine, they have an average height of 5 cm.](https://i.redd.it/wl576fxc3rz11.jpg)

Behind are the Daenerys markers of the seventh season (Stark, Tyrell, Arryn, Lannister, Targaryen, Martell, Unsullied, Dothraky and finally the Iron Fleet of Euron and Yara) with an average height of 8 cm.

In the middle are the Robb markers of the first, second and third season (Lannister, Frey, Bolton, Karstark, Tywin Lannister, Tyrell, Greyjoy and Stark) next to them are the Bolton markers of the fifth season (Greyjoy, Karstark, Bolton and Dragonstone Baratheon).

On the left are those seen in ""Histories &amp; Lore"", specifically ""The North"" and ""Northern alliegances to House Stark"" (Targaryen, Gardener, Bolton, Umber, Karstark, Lannister, Manderly, Mormont and Stark).

On the right are the Mannis markers of the second, third, fourth, fifth and seventh season (Dragonstone Baratheon, Bolton, Sellsword, ""generic fleets"", Lannister, and ""generic soldiers"")

Below are some that I saw in a promo of the seventh season (fleets and Lannister).

I publish them with two objectives:

First, I want to know if somebody know of other markers showned in the show (I know of two others, some rocks that Jon uses in the sixth season that I'm already doing, and some that Tywin Lannister had in the third season, but they are indistinguishable)

Second, I want to do something more with them than use them for decoration, I want to create a fan board game ... Soon I will publish the ideas I have.",10,1,False,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/ZFecq1jAE70SjbFw9ihTrN9NheuCWe2V8XhPPQEoM2s.jpg,,,,,

Its just a prediction so pls dont attack me.

I think Cersei will die first with a betrayal from Euron and the Golden Company for Dany, leaving the Iron Throne empty. 

Jon / Dany and their armies defeat the Night King and AOD together 

Then Jons true parentage will be revealed and everyone will believe and agree that he is the rightful king except Danaerys. 

Itll become Jon VS Danaerys #ForTheTrone 

The last surviving true heirs of the 7 kingdoms will unite to fight #ForTheThrone which to most of them means Jon. 

By heirs I mean 

North - Sansa Stark &gt; Jon
The Vale - Robin Arryn &gt; Jon
Riverlands - Edmure Tully &gt; Jon 
Iron Islands - Theon Greyjoy &gt; Jon
The Reach - Sam Tarly &gt; Jon
The Stormlands - Gendry &gt; Jon
The Rock - Jaime Lannister &gt; Jon 
(Note hems on his way to Winterfell and wielding half of Ned Starks sword - with Brienne ready to vouch for him anytime)

Dorne - Martells are extinct and Ellaria Sand I predict will die with Yara at Kings Landing upon Eurons attack

With the GC, Euron, Dothraki, Unsullied and a possible reappearance of Dario with another army, Dany might win.

Upon her victory, she finds herself alone at an already burned Kings Landing with nothing but the Iron Throne and a baby in her belly. Mood is similar to that of the ending in Breaking Bad *scene fades to black - *cue GoT theme song*  

Dont hate me, its just a prediction

Or I thought maybe all the sides will cancel each other at the end and there will be noone to rule, all dead, so the game ends for 'em(although this conflicts with the reveal of Sean Bean that only one Stark will remain at the end but very few people remaining in the whole World would mean the same as noone exists anymore, the throne would be less attractive when compared.).

With the Freys decapitated and the Riverlands still reeling from the War of the Five Kings, Daenerys could have easily come in and secured enough land and resources to supply her massive army. Moreover, she could have put her ""Mhysa"" persona to good use, delivering food and security to the common people and lords alike, and even won their love and loyalty further by reinstalling the Tullys as Lords Paramount of the Trident with Edmure. As an aside, the Blackfish should have escaped has he did in the books instead of died, joining up with Daenerys...maybe even Arya too. With the Tully's support, it would have been much easier to treat with the Starks (North) and the Arryns (Vale), who are related to the Tullys. We could have even seen what Daenerys meant by her plan to ""Break the Wheel"" in the way she earned the love and devotion of the Riverlands...a plan which, in tandem with her learning how to rule in Meereen, seems to have been completely forgotten. They could have even drawn parallels to when Aegon the Conqueror helped free the Riverlands from the control of the Ironborn 300 years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

With the Riverlands and the northern and eastern boundaries secure, and there being no danger of Euron using his fleet to destroy Daenerys's supporters and supplies so completely, she could have marched with the lords and common folk south and west to defeat what was left of the Lannisters. Moreover, Daenerys and Tyrion should have used the Destruction of the Sept of Baelor, which was obviously Cersei's doing that led to the deaths of other lords (namely Kevan Lannister and Mace Tyrell, who are supposedly well liked), to their advantage, winning the remnants of the Faith and other gods-fearing peoples to their cause, accusing her of desecrating the Faith and proof of her guilt of incest and regicide.",11,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I've often wondered if the NK has powers similar to the 3ER/Bran. He was able to grab and see Bran when Bran was essentially have a vision. 

Do you think it's possible the NK laid down breadcrumbs for our heroes to follow? I was wondering if it's possible the NK was sabotaging the visions of others by taking over their ""visions"". Could he had shown The Hound that mountain and set up the idea of it being where they needed to go in order to trap them?

How did he know Daenarys had dragons unless he had managed to see it somehow? Surely the NK must be able to warg or something in order to know something like that?

That entire sequence in S07 felt like a set up by the NK/WWs. Like they were all lured into a trap because the NK could have never gotten through the wall so easily without a dragon.

The DOOM ofVALARYIA

&amp;#x200B;

GEOGRAPHY

The doom of Valyria,

But before we get into the doom, lets get into the valyria

This is Westeros, this is the wall , or at least what used to be a wall and this is kings landing, with the iron throne. Westeros is a continent , but not the only continent , its west hence Westeros and to the east is Essos.

And at the bottom of Essos, is Valyria, or now the Doom of Valyria, but before the Doom , Valyria was the the greatest city In the world

&amp;#x200B;

BACKSTORY

With tall towers, Sphinxes as decorations and dragons flying around Valyria is the picture of perfection but it wasnt always so,

The valyrians were once simple farmers, but that changes when you discover dragons. The valerians discovered the dragons amongst the 14 volcanoes, known as the 14 flames in the area

Trained dragons = Victory, always

They won countless battles with their dragons, expanding their rule over Essos. Constantly taking slaves back to work in the 14 flames to mine.

They became by far the most advanced civilization, working stone like mud because of dragon fire, while also possessing vast knownledge of magic, advanced technology, and even creating advanced weaponry, Valyrian swords.

The people were noted for their famous Purple eyes, silver hair, and a belief that they are descended from dragons,

Things were going pretty well, before the doom happened.

&amp;#x200B;

DOOM

The String of volcanoes known as the 14 fires erupted, the fires sent high into the sky, so hot the dragons couldnt survive, this led to earthquakes splitting the earth,

in mere hours, all of the great families, knowledge, magic and history was lost

Well, except the Targaryians,.

The targs were considered among the lesser of the 40 dragon riding households, but they did have an advantage,

Dany the dreamer, had a vision of Valyria falling, so 12 years prior the Targs left for dragon stone. And once again, dragons = victory proved to be true.

But back to The doom.

&amp;#x200B;

Cause

The cause of the DOOM is unknown, but theories exist

1. Natural, A simple natural catastophy, with 14 volcanoes erupting at once
2. Gods punishing the valerians for their greed and digging to deep
3. Magic spells maintained by mages for thousands of years failing
4. Assisanition of mages,

(I won't include the Lannister gold part, even though it is relevant)

&amp;#x200B;

Aftermath

All of the magic, and smithing was lost, and people now believe that the land is over run with demons,

people go and never return, any sailor who glimpses the mountains wont survive.

The 14 flames might have kickstarted the empire, then lead to its riches, but in a single day it ruined it as well",4,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

.

&gt;When he was done, more than three-quarters of his page still remained to be filled between the gold lion on the crimson shield on top and the blank white shield at the bottom. Ser Gerold Hightower had begun his history, and Ser Barristan Selmy had continued it, but the rest Jaime Lannister would need to write for himself. 

&gt;**He could write whatever he chose, henceforth.**

&gt;**Whatever he chose**

.


Do you know whos is the next chapter???? 

&gt;**JON X**


Thats his choice, thats the momment of Jaime turning around his legacy. He will choose Jon Snow and fight by his side in the final battle for the Throne.

____________________________________________

**A SECOND DANCE OF DRAGONS**

We will have a second Dance of Dragons in season 8 and Jaime will be on Jons side while Tyrion will be on Daenerys side. The show is very economic about their scenes and what events they foreshadow, so the fact that they made sure to write a momment where Sheeren tells Stannis about the Dance of Dragons, it means that this is an event important for the future.


**SEASON 5 EPISODE 9 A DANCE OF DRAGON**

&gt;STANNIS: No. What are you reading?

&gt;SHIREEN: The Dance of Dragons.

&gt;STANNIS: Whats it about?

&gt;SHIREEN: Its the story of the fight between Rhaenyra Targaryen and her half-brother Aegon for control of the Seven Kingdoms. Both of them thought they belonged on the Iron Throne. When people started for declaring for one of them or the other, their fight divided the kingdom in two. Brothers fought brothers. Dragons fought dragons. By the time it was over, thousands were dead. **And it was a disaster for the Targaryens as well. They never truly recovered.**

______________________________________________________

Westeros will be united against the common enemy, which is Daenerys, not the NK and the army of the dead.

&gt;Sellswords have their uses, Ser Jorah admitted, but you will not win your fathers throne with sweepings from the Free Cities. **Nothing knits a broken realm together so quick as an invading army on its soil.**

Would not it have been better to have the surprise during season 8?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/a054hb/spoilers_why_does_the_show_insist_so_much_on/,mimi0108,1543115902,"I have always found Game of Thrones subtle enough for some things. There were innuendos, clues, but, in spite of everything, many things were unpredictable.

Now, in season 7, I find too obvious the insistence on Daenerys' infertility and on whom she will choose as a successor. The fact that Daenerys gets pregnant with Jon in season 8 is no longer a surprise but seems obvious for many people.

So, I wonder: did D &amp; D do that because they forgot all subtlety? Did they deliberately want to suppress the big twist that the revelation of this would have provoked? Do they do this on purpose to deceive us and there will be no baby or the child will not survive?

I find that very disturbing. The last season needs turnarounds and suprises. Daenerys's pregnancy would have been one of them if D&amp;D had not insisted so much on the fact that she thought she could not have one.

I have more and more the impression that they joked at us. Especially since the show has shown us that children born of incest (Joffrey, Viserys...) were likely to go crazy growing up. It would be huge to finish with a child like this.

A child that we will not know if he will be normal or crazy until 15 years at least.

Moreover, I feel that the author condemns incest in his story. Finishing with such a child would not necessarily be a good message. All the children of Cersei &amp; Jaime are dead, 2 out of 3 children of the mad king and his wife are dead. As for Gilly &amp; his son, maybe they will die in season 8. And even if it is not the case, the incest concerns them less because they are victims. It is not an wrong incestuous relationship when one of the partners is not consenting.

Do not hesitate to tell me what you think of all this insistence on Daenerys, I would like to know the opinion of other people.",12,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

But the theory of Littlefinger still being alive.....I think he is and isn't.....
In the show I think he is dead but in the books I assume he uses a faceless man to die in his place (they worship death after all.....and I see them as a kind of ""hive mind"" not going into that now tho)

But in the show there are several things shown in a single camera (meaning it must have meaning or they would cut it) view.....one being Littlefinger paying/giving a random person a ""coin"" and one being the lady that walks in the background of the Sparring while Littlefinger looks on as the oath to Lady Stark is mentioned.....

I see both of these things as being 4th walls to book readers....the random coin from Littlefinger being a 4th that in the books a faceless man WILL be killed in Littlefingers place (GRRM gave the plot to the series creators) and the lady walking past just being a tip to Lady Starks throat slitted alter ego.....who is not in the series.....especially in the case of the coin thing why would that scene be left in otherwise?......unless it serves another puropse but in a show where every scene counts .....

In the show I would say Littlefinger is gone......6 episodes? ......there is not enough time to bring him back to any ends....but in the books.....endless time for such a major figure we are not in his mind properly yet......

Maybe its a tip to that......

Anyway I am tired.....need sleep.....and mutton I am not a good hunter

If she knew he knew that Joffrey wasn't the legitimate heir, how could she let Ned go back North and potentially go back on his word that he wouldn't say anything? At this point Stannis is building his army at Dragonstone on the basis of what Ned has claimed, so allowing another person claiming Joffrey isn't the heir to live could only hurt her cause

Some things I could think of were that Cersei might trust Ned's honor that he wouldn't lie, but would he then idly stand by as someone besides the one true heir sit on the throne once he's back north? Would Arya and Sansa be hostages still or would they go back North with Ned? Or be used as pieces to trade for Jaime (who was captured at this point)? And say they do end up safe in the North, who's to say that wouldn't be the point where Ned flips?

I just feel like with him alive, Cersei would have to live with the fear of Ned potentially flipping and only bolstering the cause against Joffrey. So Joffrey executing Ned might have actually done more to squash the claim against him",14,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

Before reading please understand that there will be spoilers for season 7. 

&amp;#x200B;

Watching the season 7 finale, I realised that the producers have probably made a mistake about Littlefinger if we go back to what happened in season 1 regarding Bran's assassination attempt.

&amp;#x200B;

In season 7's finale, when Sansa, Arya and Bran accuse Baelish of many charges, they state that he lied about the dagger belonging to Tyrion when in fact it belonged to him. This is meant for us to finally understand that it was in fact Littlefinger who hired the assassin and that it was he who tried to have Bran killed. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, being in King's landing back then, there is no way that Littlefinger could have been aware about Bran being in coma and there is no way he could have hired an assassin to kill him if he was not aware of anything.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that, in the books, it's in fact Joffrey who hired the assassin, but clearly, the path they chose for the TV show does not work.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I missing something? Does anybody have a logical explanation for this? It seems to me that D&amp;D didn't pay attention to the fact that Baelish trying to have Bran killed was just impossible. It bugs me, because it is part of what started all the drama at the beginning of the series...",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

One of my main problems with game of thrones right now is that we have a clear bad team (In this situation we have two, Cersi and knight king) and the clear good team. This is lame.. this isn't what I watched game of thrones for. So I thought of a way of making it less ""good vs evil"". 

The major thing I would change is Cersi blowing up Margery. Instead Cersi is out played by Margery and ends up being the one that dies. Margery now basically rules the kingdom (Tommen is there but we know he would just do whatever Margery tells him to do. 

Now instead of Cersi VS Dany , we have Margery VS Dany. This kinda creates a awkward moment, instead of rooting for the good side, we kinda feel for both sides. Obviously Margery isn't necessarily good, but she isn't really a bad..? I wouldn't know who to root for, I love both the characters, and thats exactly what game of thrones is. Not good vs bad, but just characters fighting for a throne. 


One a side note, I woulda also loved Sansa playing for the throne, but thats probably to far out there. 

Thoughts?

The first mention of the comment is right after Ned dies which is also going on at the same time as dany losing her child.  I am not sure what it all means but Luwin was giving an extensive history of westeros in the same chapter.  He goes on to say that the child of the forest (cof) fought the first men for 4000 years before peace was made.  Then, the andels came and fought the first men and the cof.  Luwin said the cof felt they were losing and retreated to the north.  Peace was finally made at the gods eye (where is this?).  A small island where every tree has a face and there is a green man order to protect it.  Luwin also said the andels conquered six of the seven kingsdoms and only the north men remained ""first men"" 

Maybe the treaty said no more andels killing first men or cof and no more magic use.   So maybe... just maybe dany used magic to bring dragons back and Geoffrey (an andel) kill Ned (a northman) and that triggered the comet.  Maybe the treaty said if it was broken a red comet would fly in the sky so everyone would know it was war again.  The night(s) king saw this and started preparing to move south.  I am just thinking out loud.

I watched the show first and thought she was cunning. Used her sexuality on many, including her brother. Used her wits on many, including her other brother at times. Used humility, maternal instincts, everything at her disposal to move into a position of power even when the Game threw her curveballs like the deaths of her kids.

In the books...  I am halfway through A Feast For Crows... and she is nothing short of a deaf idiot who listens to noone and rules with broad strokes, a raging thirst for wine and contempt for others that blinds her to her own stupidity.

God I hate her, but actually have some respect for ShowCersei. ShowCersei is frustrating as she always opts for a fight when peace would suit all sides better. But at least she fights and seems capable of a victory in the long run. BookCersei is just stupid.",55,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

So I started rewatching GoT and in season 4 episode 5 Bran, Jojen and Meera are talking about the visions of the weirwood tree. Week during it Jojen says this isnt the end, not for you, not yet, to which Meera asks  how will we know the end?. Then afterwards Jojen looks down at his right hand which is on fire and says  Youll know.

So Im sure we all know that originally after Azor Ahai plunges his sword into Nissa Nissa, his sword bursts into flames. After seeing that I immediately though of Jaime Lannister. Obviously Hes lost his right hand and at the end of season 7 he leaves Cersei after that whole drama. So my thought is that he will end up killing Cersei at some point, to which his right hand will burst into flames. My guess is he will regain the use of that hand through whatever magic powers have Azor Ahai his power. He already has a valerian sword which has proven useful against WWs. But when his right hand was still attached he was know as one of the greatest swordsman in the 7 kingdoms. 

So Im just thinking that Jaime becomes the new Azor Ahai after he kills his one true love in Cersei and regains the use of that hand and then defeats the Night King.

Like I said Im not sure if this has already been posted or not I just wanted to get it out there and see what people think.

Longtime lurker, first time poster. 

## TL;DR: 

* The 13th Lord Commander married a White Walker woman in order to uphold a peace treaty between the humans (represented by the Starks) and the Others
* The treaty requires that humans stay below the Wall and that every few generations a Stark man will lead the Nights Watch, marry an Other, and give his children to the Walkers
* Humans broke that treaty
* Jon and Dany will be the ones to renew the treaty, making them both the Prince/Princess that was promised. Dany would be turned into a Walker and Jon would resume his post at the Wall. They would both be a combination of ice/fire, living/dead, and the balance would be restored

# Three Point Hypothesis:

1. The Others were involved in the creation of the Wall back at the end of the first Long Night
2. The Wall was part of a treaty between the living and the dead; this treaty was particularly focused on the Starks and the White Walkers. The answers about this past treaty are hidden in the crypts of Winterfell.
3. It will fall to Jon and Daenerys to re-broker this treaty to end the Long Night.

# Hypothesis 1: The Others helped to build the Wall along with Bran the Builder

* The Wall is the largest structure in Westeros- widely accepted to be about 700ft tall. The Children of the Forest werent ice creatures; they were more green-seers with some magic over animals and possibly plants. 
* The CotF seem to be loosely based on an amalgamation of fairy stories from European cultures:
   * The Fae used flint and stone weapons
   * Small in stature
   * Iron repelled the fair folk- this is why horseshoes used to be nailed over doorways. The fae couldnt pass iron
   * Often shown as in-tune with nature, living in barrows and trees
   * Scottish folklore divided fairies into good and bad categories: Seelie and Unseelie, respectively
      * Seelie fairies are associated with light 
      * Unseelie are linked to darkness
   * In that particular mythology, fairies are associated with border regions and border seasons, such as
      * The changing of earth seasons
      * The transition from day to night
      * Births and deaths- twilight of life
   * If we accept the CotF are based on the European fae, it is highly unlikely that they have ice powers
* Giants-
   * Accepted to be \~14 feet tall
   * That means they could *maybe* reach something 20 feet off the ground 
   * Leaves another 680 feet of space 
* Timeline
   * There is no way that fairies, some half-frozen men, and a few 14ft tall giants built the wall in the span of one humans lifetime. Its too huge!
   * Solution: the Others helped build the wall. They can control ice \[GRRM, Interview with the Dragon\], and if there was a treaty, it could have been to their benefit to help out Bran the Builder &amp; Co. 

## Hypothesis 2: The Starks (current Kings of Winter) and the Others brokered a treaty that ultimately ended the Long Night. 

* Craster
   * Leaves his sons for the gods
   * Is a godly man and doesnt fear
   * The Walkers take the babies and turn them. In exchange they leave Craster alone
* This is all predicated on the assumption that White Walkers are sentient, with their own language and goals. (This is hinted at in the books; they speak and show expressions.)
* The Others assisted in building the Wall. (See above.) Why would they do this?
   * Not for fun
   * The most logical explanation is as a boundary to demark mine and yours
   * Keep people out of the Winterlands; keep wights away from people
* A treaty makes sense from an authorial standpoint: GRRM was a conscientious objector the Vietnam War, and his [views bled over](https://youtu.be/tBuct2RZpqc).
   * D&amp;D said in the season 3 bonus features that their show isnt just good v. evil
   * In the Rolling Stone interview GRRM [pokes fun](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/george-r-r-martin-the-rolling-stone-interview-242487/) at the ending of The Lord of the Rings, asking about Aragorns tax policy, etc. It would make sense for ASOIAF to NOT end with a giant battle solving everything.
* This White Walker invasion will likely also end with some form of diplomatic resolution

*Before we continue, Id like to refresh us all on some pertinent bits of text:* 

&gt;...It is the Nightfort, and this is the end of the world.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;The Nightfort had featured in some of Old Nans scariest stories. It was here that the Nights King had reigned before his name had been wiped from the memory of man.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;There were worse things than rats down in the darkness beneath the Nightfort.   
&gt;  
&gt;This seems an old place, Jojen said as they walked down a gallery where the sunlight fell in dusty shafts through empty windows.  
&gt;  
&gt;Twice as old as Castle Black, Bran said, remembering. It was the first Castle on the Wall, and the largest. But it has also been the first abandoned, all the way back in the time of the Old King. Even then it had been three-quarters empty and too costly to maintain.   
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;No, \[Meera\] agreed. Are you sure this is the place you saw in your dream? Maybe we have the wrong castle.  
&gt;  
&gt;No. This is the castle. There is a gate here.  
&gt;  
&gt;Yes, thought Bran, but its blocked by stone and ice.  
&gt;  
&gt;As the sun began to set the shadows of the towers lengthened and the winds blew harder, sending gusts of dry dead leaves rattling through the yards. The gathering gloom put Bran in the mind of another of Old Nans stories, the tale of the Nights Kind. He has been the thirteenth man to lead the Nights Watch, she said; a warrior who knew no fear. And that was the fault in him, she would add, For all men must know fear.   
&gt;  
&gt;A woman was his downfall; a woman glimpsed from atop the Wall, with skin as white as the moon and eyes like blue stars. Fearing nothing, he chased her and caught her and loved her, though her skin was cold as ice, and when he gave his seed to her he gave his soul as well.   
&gt;  
&gt;He brought her back to the Nightfort and proclaimed her a queen and himself her king, and with strange sorceries he bound his Sworn Brothers to his will. For thirteen years they had ruled, the Nights King and his corpse queen, till finally the Stark of Winterfell and Joramun of the wildlings had joined to free the Watch from bondage. After his fall, when it was found he had been sacrificing to the Others, all records of the Nights King had been destroyed, his very name forbidden.   
&gt;  
&gt;Some say he was a Bolton, Old Nan would always end. Some say a Magnar out of Skagos, some say Umber, Flint, or Norrey. Some would have you think he was a Woodsfoot, from them who ruled Bear Island before the ironmen came. He never was. He was a Stark, the brother of the man who brought him down. She always pinched Bran on the nose then, and he would never forget it. He was a Stark of Winterfell, and who can say? Mayhaps his name was Brandon. Mayhaps he slept in this very bed in this very room.  
&gt;  
&gt;No, Bran thought, but he walked in this castle, where well sleep tonight. He did not like that notion very much at all. Nights King was only a man by light of day, Old Nan would always say, but the night was his to rule. And its getting dark.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;How did you get through the Wall? Jojen demanded as Sam struggled to his feet. Does the well lead to an underground river, is that where you came from? Youre not even wet  
&gt;  
&gt;Theres a gate, said fat Sam. A hidden gate, as old as the Wall itself. The Black Gate, he called it.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Reeds exchanged a look. Well find this gate at the bottom of the well? asked Jojen.  
&gt;  
&gt;Sam shook his head. You wont. I have to take you.  
&gt;  
&gt;Why? Meera demanded. If theres a gate  
&gt;  
&gt;You wont find it. If you did it wouldnt open. Not for you. Its the Black Gate. Sam plucked at the faded black wool do this sleeve. Only a man of the Nights Watch can open it, he said. A Sworn Brother who has said his words.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;A turn or two later and Sam stopped suddenly. He was a quarter of the way around the well from Bran and Hodor and six feet further down, yet Bran could barely see him. He could see the door, though. The Black Gate, Sam had called it, but it wasnt black at all.  
&gt;  
&gt;It was white weirwood, and there was a face on it.   
&gt;  
&gt;A glow came from the wood, like milk and moonlight, so faint it scarcely seemed to touch anything beyond the door itself, not even Sam standing right before it. The face was old and pale, wrinkled and shrunken. It looks dead. Its mouth was closed, and its eyes; its cheeks and chin sagging. If a man could live for a thousand years and never die but just grow older, his face might come to look like that.   
&gt;  
&gt;The door opened its eyes.   
&gt;  
&gt;They were white too, and blind. Who are you? the door asked, and the well whispered, Who, who who..  
&gt;  
&gt;I am the sword in the darkness, Samwell Tarly said. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers. I am the shield that guards the realms of men.  
&gt;  
&gt;Then pass, the door said. Its lips opened, wide and wider and wider still, until nothing at all remained but a great gaping mouth in a ring of wrinkles.   
&gt;  
&gt;\-Bran IV, ASOS Ch 56

&amp;#x200B;

* The Nights King was the thirteenth Lord Commander, and Lord Commanders serve for life (usually). If we assume that they serve for about one generation, thats an average of 25.5 years. 13 \* 25.5 = 331ish years. That is a LONG TIME. If an original treaty had been established, it could have been forgotten by this point.
* What if the Lady White Walker wasnt chased down by the NK? What if when he went down to fight her (or whatever), she explained the situation to him about the treaty?
* Victors write the histories, yes?
   * So if the Night Kings Stark brother removed the NK, then he would be the one to record the history, or at least give it his perspective. It would have been less shameful for the Nights Queen to use sorcery to control everyone that for them to have willingly upheld a treaty that no one remembers. The Stark king had a reason let ""everyone was ensorcelled"" go down in history
* Sacrifices-
   * Weve established that Craster traded his children for immunity from the White Walkers. The Lord of Lights followers have committed human sacrifice, there is certainly precedent.
   * All the Walkers weve seen are dudes. Other than getting babies, how can they make more Others? (Also, to make this work in my own head Ive decided that frozen sperms dont work, but frozen ovaries can. Just go with it.)
   * Babies given to the Others were part of the cost of the treaty, which is why the Night Queen took the NKs soul when he have her his seed. He was essentially consenting to giving up his babies in that moment.
   * I think its important that Old Nan spends a whole paragraph of her story driving home the idea that the 13th Lord Commander was a Stark. Starks were Kings in the North when the wall was built, and they would likely have been the ones to parlay for a treaty. It would be easy for the Others to tell the Stark King that in order to keep the stakes high, it must be *his* descendants that are given over to the Walkers
      * This is why there must always be a Stark in Winterfell. The line has to continue so the treaty can continue, and so the Stark family can continue to uphold the promise they made to the Others in the treaty 
* The design of the Nightfort
   * If the Walkers helped to build the wall (which is the least tinfoily thing in this post) why would they build a tamper-proof door into it? Theyre trying to keep people out of their lands. Theyve also made a door only *Sworn Brothers* can cross, not Walkers, not wildlings. There was some planned interaction between the Others and the men of the Nights Watch. 

In summary: there was a treaty struck with the Others after the Battle for the Dawn Part I. The treaty was struck between the Starks (on behalf of humanity) and the White Walkers. It stated:

1. A Wall would be built dividing up Westeros into an area for the living, and an area for the frozen dead. Humans would stay in their bit, and the Others would do the same
2. A Stark would remain as ruler of the north (the people most likely to interact with the Others)
3. Every few generations a Stark would rule the Wall, couple with a Walker, and give the Night King new children, sealing the treaty in marriage

Things the current batch of humans have fucked up: all of the above.

## Hypothesis 3: It will fall to Jon and Daenerys to re-broker this treaty to end the Long Night

Heres some more pertinent text- Jon repeatedly dreams of Winterfells crypts: 

&gt;Somehow I know I have to go down there, but I don't want to. I'm afraid of what might be waiting for me. AGOT ch 26, Jon IV  
&gt;  
&gt;All my dreams are of the crypts, of the stone kings on their thrones. Sometimes I hear Robb's voice, and my father's, as if they were at a feast. But there's a wall between us, and I know that no place has been set for me. Jon, ASOS ch 75, Samwell IV

* I think its possible that Jons doom is in the crypt of Winterfell. Maybe the 13th Lord Commander is buried down there with a Black Book recording his actions and why he had to take a White Walker bride
* If a Stark killed his brother, the 13th Lord Commander, I doubt hed have just left his brother. Starks are honorable, and we already have evidence that Starks are willing to bury siblings in the crypts even if the siblings arent Winter Kings (e.g., Ned and Lyanna). 
* It could be that Jon has been dreaming of the crypts because it was always his destiny to find evidence of the original treaty and take up that burden.

What is that burden you ask?

Marrying a Night Queen. 

* Danys makeup changes pretty dramatically when she walks out of the throne room and though the wall during her [visions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gulVUWrADCM) in the House of the Undying. I know its really cold, but she loses all color, which could maybe be some foreshadowing
* In this scene (in the show) she starts out in the Throne Room of the Red Keep. Then she goes through the wall, then keeps walking north towards her heaven with Drogo. In her visions she doesnt return south. Could she die and remain beyond the wall?
* Anyone who says, I am the king is no true king
   * Virtually everyone who has said something along the lines of I am the rightful king/queen/regent is dead. Its unlikely that Dany will avoid this
   * All of the foreshadowing/prophecies suggest that Dany isnt going to rule, and a lot of the fandom think that shes going to die. If she died from falling off her dragon it would be stupid, and if theres a time jump that would allow her to be suddenly full-term with a baby would make NO SENSE and I would HATE THAT and it BETTER NOT BE THAT
   * So how would her death have meaning? 

If the Night King/Lord of the Others turned her into a White Walker, *especially* if shes already pregnant. This would parallel the story of the 13th Lord Commander, would re-seal the treaty with the Others, and it would restore the balance in the World of Ice and Fire. Dany would be fire and ice, Jon would be ice and fire. Shed be dead, hed be alive.

Balance. 

They would both the the Prince(ss) that was Promised, using both meanings of the word promised: The Prince that was Foretold, and the Prince that Was Promised in Marriage. How do Great Houses usually seal their alliances?

An arranged marriage. 

They would give the Night King children, they would see that no humans ventured beyond the wall, and they would ensure that this time *the north actually remembered.* 

That phrase probably started after the first treaty with the Others. There needed to be a Stark in Winterfell because it was a Stark that signed the treaty on behalf of the living. The north needed to remember, because if it did NOT the balance would be thrown off and the Others would come again. 

Unfortunately, it became a remember the Alamo situation. They remembered the phrase The North Remembers, but they lost all context for it. (Kind of like Neville and the remembrall.)

I wanted to try my hand at explaining them. 

The Valonqar - I have been seeing things everywhere about ""the valonqar will be brother will kill Cersei"" or that Cersei's path will have to follow things in line with the Valonqar prophecy. **The Valonqar Prophecy Does Not Exist on the TV Series.......yet**. The Valonqar does not have to be the way Cersei dies as of what we know now. However she may well do, but there is almost an insistence on here that Cersei must die by a brother or some sort. Well before I go on, let's think about it logically, if Cersei is killed by some random unknown persons brother then it's all a bit silly, I think the brother thing will be literal to Jamie or Tyrion and at a stretch the NK, for me it ends there. However the show has either decided to omit the Valonqar for one of three reasons: 

* They aren't using the Valonqar - in the books Cersei may never even make it to the Iron Throne, but in the show she did, either this is consistent with GRRM or the show decided to keep on Lena Heady who is excellent as Cersei and they may have decided that her death will not be at the hands of her brother. 

* They were planning the second half of the Valonqar prophecy as a flashback so that there is still an element of mystery as to who could kill her and throw off book fans. 

* They will have her die by Jamie or Tyrion and they just want it as a total surprise. 

So the Valonqar may happen but in our thinking around theories I think this sub should loosen up a little. Words are wind, prophecies are unreliable, it's a big part of the series. 

**Azor Ahai** 

AA will be reborn amidst salt and smoke and under a bleeding star. This is the only reference as to what AA will have to do to come back. There is no Nissa Nissa, there is no forging things in a lion and I think this is another thing people try so hard to fit on to theories like a sheet which is too small for a bed and there is no evidence that this will happen again. The death of Nissa Nissa only forms part of the myth of AA and it is the story of Lightbringer being forged, it had nothing to do with the man himself or any power he may have had. Lightbringer is forged already, it has to be found not reforged and that is only if the show want to include it in the final series. My 2 cents on it is that TPTWP, The Last Hero, AA are all the same person talked about in different cultures, like how the Messiah thing arises in real world religion. 

Dany not burning - this is specific to Dany ""The birth of Danys dragons was unique, magical, wonderous, a miracle. She is called The Unburnt because she walked into the flames and lived. But her brother sure as hell wasnt immune to that molten gold. - this is from GRRM. Jon can burn, Viserys can burn, Dany is not immune to fire she is shrouded in magic because of the birth of the dragons, hence ""unburnt"" being a title. 



If anyone knows anymore then go for it, just from the view on my high horse the more time goes on the lazier theories have become. Game of Thrones theories are a great thing, in a few months there will be no more need for show based theories, so as we try to guess what will happen we may as well work of the right info.

* The Wall tv and books spilt on this when the good queen tries to fly over the wall her dragon won't do it and no dragon at least in the books have been known to have gone over the wall pointing to cold hands words about the wall having spells around it. 
* Wild dragons can hatched on their own (Grey Ghost, Cannibal and Sheep Stealer) and never be tamed (Grey Ghost and Cannibal)
* wild dragons who have never been tamed as hatchlings can be tame (Sheep Stealer)

* What's happen to Cannibal and Sheep Stealer ?
* Why did only certain families in the freehold ever able to ride dragons ? 
* What happen to the other four dragons that house Targaryen brought over before the doom ?
* Why didn't dragons moved from Valyria on their own ?

And a really, really, REALLY shitty cash grab phone game. The whole party. I was hoping we could give out any information or speculation we have here.

I mean, with how successful the series is, I was expecting some game studio to have picked it up by now and make it open world RPG. Theres so much potential youre practically swimming in ideas to make the perfect GOT game. But nothing, not a word. Bethesda is trying to make Fallout 76 work (its too damn broke to begin with) and then theyll be busy with elders scrolls 6, project red got cyberpunk. I wonder who else could step up (.....EA....stay away. We do not need Microtransactiona in Game of thrones)

Is there a problem getting the rights to make it?

Is it too expensive to make? Too ambitious?

Does GRRM hate the idea of his series made into a video game?

Or does no game studio or company have an interest in it?

Anybody got something to share on the topic? Give us some hope.....or crush are dreams now by telling how the Phone game is the only GOT game we are going to play

A while back, we invited people to take part in a simple subreddit deadpool. Here, we've taken the first 1000 results. Why 1000? At a number after that, there were enough leaks/production spoilers to muddy the waters, so it seemed a safe, round choice.

We asked whether characters would end the season alive, dead or undead. Undead generally refers to characters who have been killed, but reanimated. If you thought a character would be turned into a wight and then be killed, you would answer ""dead"". If you thought a character would not be mentioned in any way, they are assumed to have ended the season alive (unless there's a mass extinction event).If there is a time jump for an epilogue (e.g. Jon dying of old age), it's being excluded.

You can still enter the deadpool [by clicking here](https://reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/927aid/contest_you_can_now_enter_our_simplified_s8/), and if you're the top scorer, you'll get a shout-out of some sort. But you won't be eligible for the overall prize.

**AND SO THE RESULTS**. We have very simple, excel-generated graphs too. If anyone would like to make an infographic and maybe get some karma by posting it, I'd be in ur debt.

Hes representing the crown, cersei and tommen. 

Book 4, Margaery gets arrested by the high sparrow for serial fornication and adultery and demands a trial by combat. Thing that sucks for her is, as a queen, she can only be represented by a member of the Kingsguard in any conflict, and Loras tyrell is near death. She wants to call for her brother Garth to represent her, but cersei will not let her. 

So is it a plot hole or am I looking too deep into it, because if that were the case, why didnt Tyrion or anybody point out that cersei cant call Gregor as her champion? Or was it just a rule cersei made up, because that was a huge plot point. ",25,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

There will be a complete reboot and anywhere there is a throne left standing, a new house will be established to sit on it.

I have GRRMs new book, Fire and Blood (obviously not TWOW) queued up to read but I have a boring book I dont like much to slog through first. Looking forward to Fire and Blood got me thinking, and something occurred to me. On the way to the ending of GoT is one of the outcomes going to be the extinction of **all** the major houses? Its looking like anyone who dared to play the game of thrones is going to see an end to their entire line.

**Already Extinct or Without a Male Heir:**
*	Tyrell  Rulers of The Reach, wiped out in Season 7.
*	Bolten  Held The North for a short time.wiped out around the time of battle for of the bastards
*	Baelish  not exactly major but made a play for the Vale. Eliminated in Season 7
*	Martell  Rulers of Dorne, wiped out by Ellaria Sand. Ellaria and her daughters dead or dying by the end of Season 7.
*	Baratheon  Rulers of The Stormlands, wiped out when the presumed Baratheon brothers died. Note Gendry being made legitimate would reverse this, but it is far from likely this will happen.
*	Reyne  honorable mention. They were gone before the series starts.
*	Blackfyre  honorable mention. They are gone and not long-shot player in series like they are in the books.
*	Tarly  Very short supremacy in The Reach, male heirs wiped out by Dany in Season 7. Sam has Nights Watch vows preventing him from inheriting or producing heirs.
*	Frey  Recognized as rulers of The Riverlands for a short time. Presumed all male heirs wiped out by Arya in Season 7.

**On the Bubble**
*	Stark  Rulers of The North. Bran-bot doesnt really seem like the marrying type, and Jon, even when its established he is legitimate, will not be a Stark. Not to mention Jon technically has Nights Watch vows, although he has been AWOL a long time now.
*	Lannister  Rulers of The Westerlands. Tyrion is technically the last hope but hes still viable. Jaime has Kings Guard vows and Cersei doesnt have a living husband to legitimize the child she may or may not be carrying. They are on their last legs, but still better off than the Starks.
*	Arryn  Rulers of The Vale. It all rests on Robin, which is to say this house is circling the drain.
*	Targaryen  Claimant to the Iron Throne. Once believe to be without male heirs, Jon, if he survives, would *technically* be their last hope, but as mentioned above he still has Nights Watch vows to contend with. Barring some intervention, which I admit seems possible, this house is extinct. 

**Endangered Species**
*	Greyjoy  Rulers of the Iron Islands. The house is in disarray, but there are a few (with help from the books) male Greyjoys floating around (pun intended). Eg. Euron, Victarion, and Aeron. Theon too, but hes a sausage short of full picnic. Euron is the only one from the series with the right stuff to continue the line, though. And hes not going to make it to the end.
*	Tully  Rulers of The Riverlands. Edmure is where, exactly? Hes likely alive somewhere and may even have a not-too-bad looking Frey wife to help him carry on his line. But I dont think it will happen. Flying under the radar will only work so long for Edmure.

My theory is that the ruling house, the 7 great houses of the 7 kingdoms, plus the Greyjoys, will all end in Season 8. Those on the bubble will not get the divine intervention they would need, and any heir will be from the matriarchal line. There will be some, I believe. Id bet heavily on little Targaryen daughter, for example. But based on the Westeros rules of succession all 9 of these houses will end.

But Stannis was buried in snow. The prophecy of azair is more of a story than a person. He only comes about when the prophecy has been done. Aka dany rises through smoke and dragins and somebody is reborn = Jon but the lord is never wrong = Melisandre is never wrong.

Azor Ahai will be born orrebornamid smoke and salt, as you may recall from this scene. He or she will wake dragons out of stone. Finally, the new Azor Ahai will reforge the great flaming swordLightbringer, which the original Azor Ahai made by plunging the blade into the heart of his beloved wife, Nissa Nissa. I genuinely believe that this prophecy TELLS THE STORY of dany birthing her dragons and Jon being reborn. This all happens in the time that Stannis lands on DRAGON Stone and  supposedly dies. Melisandre thinks that she got the wrong info from the lord of light whereas I believe she has been all along correct. She claims that when she asks the Lord who is the Prince that was promised he shows her nothing but snow. And the audience has misinterpreted this as Jon snow. But we know that this is false as he is not a snow. But snow is where we last saw Stannis. And finally the plunging of the blade through ""nissa nissa"" I believe this to be Melisandre as she has already let us know that she must die in westeros. We have been trick d into believing that prophecy is fire and ice aka Jon and dany when all along Stannis landed on dragon stone hence ""waking dragons"" and has been ""reborn"" brianne supposedly killing him.

When Margaery warns The High Sparrow about Cersei, The High Sparrow, as we all know, disregards Margaery and decides to keep the spectators, and the Tyrells (the ones present) in the Sept. Eventually the Sept blows up, and the Tyrells with it.  

How about this though...what if the Tyrell's escaped? What if, before the Sept blows up, the Tyrell's and the Faith escape, and are able to see the Sept crumble before their eyes, and figure it was Cersei who caused it?

Is there a problem getting the rights to make it?

Is it too expensive to make? Too ambitious?

Does GRRM hate the idea of his series made into a video game?

Or does no game studio or company have an interest in it?

To me, the books and the show (at least the earlier seasons) tried to subvert fantasy expectations but always had logic behind their plot twists. We were made to assume Ned Stark was going to be the main hero of this epic, yet he died due to his character flaws. Robb was suppose to pick up where his father left off, however, the same thing happened to him as well. So, by then, one might assume only the ""good"" guys die, only to have Tywin hit the bucket soon after. 

What I find interesting is that all their deaths have something to do with their character flaws. Ned's naivety towards Cersei or Tywin's mistreatment of Tyrion. To me their deaths felt earned, because in this world, not being strategic about every part of your life bites you in the rear.

So, when it comes to Jon Snow, at least during the second half of the show, it doesn't feel like they follow the same rules. Jon died due to his mistakes, however, post resurrection, all his character flaws don't backfire on him anymore. His propensity for being honest (to a fault) and his bravery (which I find to be a bit of a death wish) don't have many negative consequences. I find it a bit disheartening to see him survive a zombie armada with no repercussions when Khal Drogo died of an infected flesh wound.

My hope is that his plot armor and the idea that he is ""the chosen one"" are all a huge bait and switch, because subverting such traditional fantasy tropes is exactly why I fell in love with the show. What are everyone's thoughts on the matter?",18,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I could be wrong, because I'm not GRR Martin and feel free to tear this post apart, but here I go.
My theory centers around the question I posted above, who was the prince that was promised for? The book is told from the perspective of the living humans, so we assume the promised prince is for the humans. Given GRR Martins history of murdering humans and ripping our hearts out, I cannot help but feel that this is not going to be the case. (I swear I used to believe in happy endings until I read Game of Thrones)
The series is called ""the song of ice and fire"" which means the series centrals around our two main characters, Dany and Jon.
In the last episode of season 7, and yes this is a spoiler, we see them (finally) hook up. I believe, naturally and for the sake of time, this will result in Dany getting pregnant and have a baby. Their baby is the prince that was promised.
Dany wants the throne, Jon has bent the knee but I think when he finds out his true parentage, he will decide he will be a better ruler than Dany. This starts a war that ultimately destroys the realm (because all men must die). 
Jon and Dany destroy eachother but their baby is left in the care of Sam. In walks the night king (death) who takes the baby, bht then the baby converts all the wrights and night walkers back in to people. The baby of Jon and Dany is the prince that was promised, but it was not promised to save humans, but the dead. Because death always wins.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

2335,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-11-30,2018,11,30,6,a1lmrr,self.gameofthrones,[Spoiler] (Theory) The Seven Deadly Sins and the End of the Show,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/a1lmrr/spoiler_theory_the_seven_deadly_sins_and_the_end/,lobcity414,1543526933,"After rewatching most of the show and many analysis videos Ive come up with a two-pronged theory, one about how the families of Game of Thrones represent The Seven Deadly Sins and also about the White Walkers and how the show is going to end, but Ill get to that later.

Part of what makes GoT so entertaining is that there really are no good guys or bad guys in this show. Everybody is oftentimes a flawed selfish asshole in their own way. There are some biblical undertones to the story as well, which isnt surprising. George R.R. Martin has said he draws a lot of inspiration from Tolkien in fantasy and writing, and Tolkiens work in LOTR/The Hobbit had many biblical themes and undertones, &amp; A Song of Ice and Fire/Game of Thrones is no different. My theory on the TV show stems from this, I believe that each of the major houses in the show represents one of the Seven Deadly Sins, and on a greater scale shows just how corrupt people in this world have become, which plays into the end of the show.

&amp;#x200B;

**Greed: House Tyrell**. The Tyrells are a compelling family, especially because they seem to be the only matriarchal family in Westeros, and the alpha women of this family play the Game of Thrones with great cunning. However, their greatest flaw throughout the show is greed for power, and ultimately it led to their downfall. They showed a complete lack of loyalty to anybody in The War of Five Kings, siding first with Renly Baratheon, later switching sides to secure a partnership with the Lannisters in a military alliance, then through Margaery marrying Joffrey/Tommen before finally siding with Daenerys, partly for revenge but largely because they knew nothing would be gained by staying allied with the Lannisters. They switch sides consistently and manipulate people with ease, and they dont do it for an ideology, they do it purely for the sake of what they think will put them on the highest spot on the totem pole. Even their banner is [embroidered](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/House_Tyrell) with the color associated with Greed, an all green Sigil surrounding the rose. 

**Rage: House Baratheon**. The Baratheon [house motto](https://imgur.com/gallery/WNNVPvJ) is the first indication, Ours is the Fury that rage is what they represent. Robert Baratheon has the hottest temper of any character in the show, verbally lashing out at those around him or [slapping](https://imgur.com/gallery/hP0QL) Cersei when she pisses him off. His bastard son Gendry is shown to be hot-headed at times as [well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ym7mRYyuXs). Even their house animal: The Stag, though a majestic animal is known for having a [fiery temper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNGGbozilko) when threatened. The background color for the house sigil as well is an orangish/yellow hue, and orange is a color often associated with the deadly sin of rage. Symbolically as well this house encompasses rage in the sense that of all the deadly sins, rage in many ways most encompasses masculinity. Uncoincidentally this house lacks any female members besides the sickly child of Stannis.

**Envy: House Targaryen**. Envy by definition is a feeling of discontented or resentful longing aroused by someone else's possessions, qualities, or luck. Obviously, the longing thats aroused through the Targaryens is the Iron Throne, which is owned by the Baratheons/Lannisters who overthrew their father. The envy for the crown displayed by the family is shown first through Viserys, who seems to have dedicated his entire existence to trying to retake the throne even though Westeros is glad to see his families rule come to an end after his father. After Viserys is killed, the envy for the throne continues through Daenerys and the great lengths we see her go through to go retake a throne she doesnt have a claim to anymore. I can guarantee the envy she has for the throne will carry over into the final season and create some fatal conflict when its revealed Jon Snow is really a Targaryen, and the rightful heir to the throne over her if the Targaryens take it. For a symbolic connection, I looked at some historical depictions of the seven deadly sins being represented by animals, and one that commonly came up depicting envy is the snake. The only lizard depicting a deadly sin, and the only lizard on the [sigil](https://imgur.com/gallery/ZJzOP) of any house in Westeros.

**Gluttony: The Martells**. This one may be the biggest stretch for people to believe but I wholeheartedly believe theyre an embodiment of gluttony from what weve seen in the show. Their plotline after Oberyn's arc is often criticized as the worst in the show but their demeanor in many ways encompasses gluttony to me. Gluttony is all about overindulgence of some base instinct like eating, fighting or sex. [The first scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BS6PJKoJSl0) were shown of the Martell family, its Oberyn and Ellaria taking their pick from several prostitutes in Littlefingers whorehouse, drinking and getting down with some freaky group sex stuff before Oberyn goes and starts a fight with some Lannister soldiers. overindulgence of sex is commonplace with the Martells, they sleep around with anybody who catches their eye, they overindulge in violence whether it be Oberyn talking about taking part in the fighting pits for fun, the Sand Snake girls indulging in violence for revenge, and of course they love to overindulge in terrible [one-liners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sggmx8vysoc) as well.

**Sloth: House Frey**. Walder Frey without question is one of the most unlikable S.O.B.s in the series, but the arc of this house shows the underlying deadly sin this house encompasses, through their sheer incompetence and laziness, the premier signs of sloth. From the getgo theyre shown as an all-around uninspired and uninteresting house, relying on their lucky location at the twins for their power. The house as a whole is lazy and it shows in their conduct when doing anything at all on screen. Jaime [verbally berates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zi32sU4Kvtw) their lazy military conduct in season six episode seven. The obvious laziness of this house is part of the reason why its so easy to hate them (besides Walder being an old creepy pervert). Going back to the symbolism aspect, blue is considered the color of the Deadly Sin Sloth and at the base of the [Frey Sigil](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/House_Frey) blue water is shown, same as how at the base of their depiction in the show it is their lazy demeanor that makes them so despised, and represent sloth in such a manner.

**Pride: House Stark**. Its hard to throw any hate at the Stark family. They are after all the most beloved family in the show and the protagonist family, but if there was any deadly sin they would encompass its pride more than anything, primarily through two traits. The first is their incredible stubbornness. Its widely known theyre a stubborn family, our way is the old way Neds stubbornness kept him in a dungeon for weeks, Jons refuses to bend the knee to Daenerys at first and is called out for his pigheaded nature several times by other characters, their stubbornness is a pinnacle part of their conduct. Along with stubbornness, another trait commonly associated with Pride is disobedience, a trait seen through the Stark children. Whether its Robbs disobedience to promises he made to Walder Frey, Aryas disobedience after pledging herself to the faceless men, its these two staples for me that convince me theyre representative of pride. To add icing on the cake their [house sigil](https://imgur.com/gallery/ndjGn) is mostly grey, a color commonly associated with pride (but the internet is particularly split between that and purple as the color of pride).

**Lust: House Lannister**. At first glance this one may seem obvious through Tyrion and his man-whore tendencies, known for his many brothel visits early in the series. Their [banner](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Lannister) is embroidered in red as well, one of the colors commonly associated with lust (or blue depending on the part of the internet you ask). Looking at the personality traits of the members of the Lannister family, they encapsulate lust in many ways, with their incredibly selfish and inconsiderate behavior towards anybody outside of the family, two traits strongly associated with lust the deadly sin. Of course what lust is most associated with is extreme sexual desire, and this is demonstrated through the twincest relationship between Cersei and Jaime. We know incest is a fairly common thing in the Game of Thrones universe, but same as real life, it comes with bad side effects in the children the more closely related you are. Madness especially is a common side effect in children of incest in the show (The mad king had incest genes) and oh boy is Joffrey one [rotten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKQbW06x_Wk) little shit, likely as a result of his parents being near genetic clones of each other. Both Jaime and Cersei know what theyre doing and the dangers that come with it but they encompass lust, and as such their lust controls their arc and almost every bad thing thats happened to them in the show.

&amp;#x200B;

The seven deadly sins are covered but where does this all play into the end of the show? Well, this is where The White Walkers come in. The most powerful families in the world all encompass the deadliest sins imaginable according to many forms of classic literature. Analyzing more Biblical symbolism I think the White Walkers could best be described as the flood in the story of Noahs ark. If youre not familiar with it, the story in the Bible book of Genesis goes that God saw that human beings were far too corrupt and beyond saving, so he sent a flood to wipe out everything on earth (except of course for Noah, his family and the animals they brought with them on their big ass boat). Perhaps the White Walkers are building up their army now because they have a mission from higher powers to wipe out mankind.

This is where fellow fans go sour on me and say Im too cynical, but I believe that the White Walkers arent the overarching bad guys, theyre a force sent by the old gods in Westeros who see that people have become too corrupt and they need to start anew. Even GoT Showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss describe The Night King, saying that hes not really a force for good or evil, Hes just a force of destruction much like the biblical flood. This show is known more than any other for subverting expectations and what a subversion it would be if the beings we believed to be the bad guys through the show up to this point were actually sent on a mission by the old gods who dont like what men have become?

TL;DR: The families represent the seven deadly sins in Westeros and the White Walkers represent a destructive force from the gods like the flood in Noahs Ark because people in this world have become too corrupt.",0,1,True,nsfw,,,,,

2371,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-11-30,2018,11,30,19,a1rg1b,self.gameofthrones,[SPOILERS] I don't believe Sansa regressed in Season 5.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/a1rg1b/spoilers_i_dont_believe_sansa_regressed_in_season/,Laggol,1543575288,"I've been rewatching the show lately, and I have been looking at the rest of the community's opinions on events as I go along, because I didn't start watching the show until just before season 7, and have only recently started reading the books, so I've missed out on a lot of the opinions on events of both the show, and the books, but after finishing season 7, and seeing how people believe Sansa's character regressed in both seasons 5 and 7, I thought about it, and I honestly disagree, and I don't have anybody to talk to about it, so here we are.

Season 4, Episode 8 is often seen as the episode Sansa comes into her own, and becomes a player of the game. However, to me, Sansa, and the audience as well, have been mislead by Littlefinger into thinking Sansa has became a player. He has been grooming her for seasons at this point, and we know Littlefinger is a master manipulater. He's also incredibly selfish. I don't believe he did all this because he wanted Sansa as a protege or an ally. He had always seen Sansa as a pawn, and I still believe this was true up until the point Sansa finally turned on him.

Yes, it was a huge mistake on Littlefinger's part to send her to Ramsey, but it seems to me that he knew the risk, and believed that Sansa would always be his pawn, no matter what, and that was his true mistake. He likely had plans for ensuring Sansa lived while married to Ramsey, and was probably going to have Ramsey killed as soon as Sansa gave him a boy. But things backfired when Sansa not only escaped, but also realized she was just a pawn all along.

I believe Sansa was always a pawn to Littlefinger, up until the point she realized her true place in the game. She thought Littlefinger was her one true ally, and that he felt the same. But she realized during her time with Ramsey that was never the case. It never was expressly mentioned on screen, but I believe that as soon as Sansa escaped, she vowed to no longer become Littlefinger's pawn, because she realized he never truly cared about her as anything beyond a piece in his game. This was the actual moment she became a player of the game. In season 5, not 4.

In season 6, you can see Sansa use her status as Littlefinger's most valuable pawn to turn the tables. She manipulates Littlefinger for once, and he's so overconfident he can't realize it. She uses his power and influence to make herself a queen, all the while making Littlefinger think she's still her pawn. 

Now we get to season 7, where Littlefinger has started to notice Sansa's independence, and I believe he begins to fear she is no longer his pawn, which is why he tries to create the fued between Sansa and Arya. He wants to once again make Sansa believe he is her most loyal ally, while in truth, he has been manipulating her the whole time. 

Now, once again, in season 7, people complain about Sansa's supposed character regression, but I don't think that's the case. In my eyes, she hasn't been a player for long at the start of season 7, and managed to become incredibly powerful very quickly, making her become overconfident. Since she has flipped the tables, she can't see Littlefinger has caught on to her growth in power over him, much like Littlefinger didn't notice hers in season 6. This is what allows him to almost succeed in turning the stark girls against eachother. But he doesn't realize either a), that Sansa is smarter than he thought, or b), how powerful Bran is (if it is true that Bran was the one who revealed Littlefinger's hand in the fued).

In the season where Littlefinger is finally accused of all his crimes, Sansa says ""I'm a slow learner."" To me, this is the point where Sansa has truly figured out the game. She became a player when she learned to manipulate Littlefinger, and then she mastered it when she realized she can't become overconfident, or else she'll end up becoming a pawn again, as she had done to Littlefinger in season 6.

Now, all this doesn't mean that Sansa's arc was carried out geniusly in seasons 5 and 7. It's kind of the contrary. I believe that what I have said was how the writers viewed Sansa's arc across seasons 4-7, but they failed to do it properly. It feels rough, and like they actually didn't have a plan with what to do with her. They probably didn't to be honest. I'd bet they tried to figure it out as they went, and this is what we got. An odd, confusing character arc that felt like it had an unsatisfying culmination by the end of season 7.

But that's just my opinion. I wanna know what the rest of you thin(",8,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

1. Popular fan theory regarding Jaime and Cersei. More specifically that Cersei will be killed by Jaime. 
2. This being a final season, it will surely have lot of callbacks to earlier seasons. We already could notice this trend on season 7. 

So, how does Jaime's arc end, in regards to killing Cersei?

He kills Cersei by pushing her out of the window, the same window where Tommen jumped. 

I have a vision where Cersei's plans have backfired, King's Landing is being sacked and Cersei is contemplating suicide (akin to what happened during Blackwater). Jaime arrives to the scene first, worried about her. Cersei, having lost everything, tries to convince Jaime to jumping with her, as they are twins and lovers and meant to be always together, despite their arguments. Jaime thinks about it, suspense is built, but in the end, he will say something meaningful and shove Cersei out of the window (like what he did to Bran). Full circle.

A season or two focusing on Aegon, his conquest and reign, then Maegor stuff, Dance of the Dragons, Blackfyre Rebellions, Summerhall, and in the final season they could do Robert's Rebellion.

Back in season 1 Robert and the small council are discussing Daenerys rise to power in Essos and whether she should be assassinated, Ned Stark walks in, scolds the King and then resigns as Hand. At the time the scene seems to show Neds integrity, that he is prepared to stand up to and risk his friendship with the King over a point of honour and principle, that he refuses to resort to savagery, its a powerful scene.

Theres more to it though, Robert wants to kill Dany because she has a claim to the throne and, even though shes no threat now, she might become one, we didnt know it at the time but the exact same thing could be said about the boy Ned has been hiding for 15 years, Jon Snow. 

Understanding this throws that scene into a whole new light, yes Ned is principled but Roberts threats are landing very close to home, when Ned is defending Dany hes also defending the boy hes raised as his son, Neds still scared of what Robert would do if he ever found out the truth about Jon, thats what makes Ned so determined to stand up to the King.",34,1,False,spoiler,,,,,
