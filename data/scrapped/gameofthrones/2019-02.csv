Robert- What about Aerys Targaryen?  What did The Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back? Did he call you a traitor? Did he plead for a reprieve? 

Jamie- He said the same thing hed been saying for hours........burn them all..........




Another that pisses me off is the way Cregan Stark handled things after the dance of dragons. The only one that had the fire to stand up to him was Lady Baela. And the only reason he let The Sea Snake go was for a wife.... idk any thoughts?

  But when Lady Baela brandished a sword and declared that she would cut off the hand of ANY man who sought to harm the men who had saved her, The Wolf of Winterfell smiled for all to see, and allowed that if her ladyship was so fond of these dogs, he would permit her to keep them.

Robert Baratheon tries to assassinate Daenerys in season 1, but he fails and Joffrey attempts to kill Gendry (Robert's bastard son, who is currently missing in the series). 

Then there are various claims on who is based on Richard III - Ned Stark (don't think that makes much sense), Tyrion (only because he is deformed) and Stannis. I guess Stannis is closest, as he is in the royal line, kills his wife and daughter and is defeated in battle. Jon Snow was born in a tower and has a claim to the throne, but probably won't be defeated. 

There's also an interesting continuation of the Princes in the Tower with the trial of Perkin Warbeck - after Bosworth a pretender came forward and tried to claim he was Richard Duke of Shrewsbury (who had disappeared). He even had the backing of Richard's mother and was a thorn in the side of the new Tudor dynasty - the whole trial cost the crown a lot of money. Technically, Gendry is still a legitimate claimant, so his claim could come up in season 8 and people might call him a pretender. Although really, I think this sub plot might be somewhat subdued by Daenerys/Jon/Lannister/Undead war - also got a bit messed up by the whole Beyond the Wall mission... 

There's a new audio drama about Perkin Warbeck on History Hit TV with Iain Glen (non other than Sir Jorah!) - came out this week.

## Theories on survivors



My theory is that the less liked people in the beginning of the show will be the survivors.

Here are the people i believe will survive:

1.) john was a bastard

2.) tyrion was a dwarf

3.) aria was too ""guy like""

4.) Sam couldnt do anything

5.) The hound with his burns

People i believe will die:

sansa

cersie

Jamie

jorah

&amp;#x200B;

I also think Danny dies while giving birth to Jon's son, the same way that his own mother died

&amp;#x200B;

TL/DW: Baelish is working for someone in Braavos, is alive, and someone else took his place when he was executed.

&amp;#x200B;

So this got me thinking:  What if Baelish is an agent of the Iron Bank whose mission is to destabilize Westeros in order for the Iron Bank to take over?

&amp;#x200B;

I did some searching on here for theories like this, and all the threads I found were old such that they were posted before season 7.  So I thought it was time to resurrect this theory and flesh it out with more evidence from S7 - some of which is in that video.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my thoughts.

First, several years ago, I suspected that the Iron Bank was modeled on the Medici family and how they bankrolled/impacted Eurpoean history for quite some time, installing popes, queens, using the banking system to develop wealth and control/influence.  Similar to the Iron Bank.

More relevant to Baelish:

Thanks to him, the crown became quite indebted to the Iron Bank, then the IB started calling in its debts in Westeros - primarily in response to Cersei's decision to defer payments.  The IB bankrolls Stannis.  They then bankroll Cersei (after she repays them thanks to the defeat of the Tyrells) again.

Clearly they are more than willing to have people all across Westeros indebted to them.

Now Baelish comes in to play.  If he is an agent of the IB, what is his mission?

Simple:  Destabilize Westeros so that the IB can install their own government and start pulling the strings.  Baelish did rather well with this once he got Robert Baratheon in debt to the IB to the point that Tywin was noticeably disturbed by the amount of money owed.  Then Baelish started the War of the 5 Kings.  In the ensuing chaos what did he do?  Oh, he became Lord of Harrenhall, Lord Paramount of the Trident, and was positioning himself to seize control (or proxy control) of the North through Sansa.

He wasn't doing this for himself, he was doing it so that the majority of Westeros was under his - and thus the IB's control.

&amp;#x200B;

Further supporting this idea is the scene in the video above wherein a girl - who seems to be one of his ""little birds"" gives a coin to him and - if you believe the video - says, ""your time is up"" and then takes his face for her own and continues to work the situation in Winterfell.

Now, if you accept that the Baelish who is put on trial is this woman, then Baelish's performance during the ""trial"" makes a lot more sense.  I was always surprised at how impotent and desperate he was in that scene.  It seemed, to me, to be completely out of character for him to beg the way he did.  Not to mention that he was taken COMPLETELY by surprise.  He never struck me as a person who would let his emotions or his surprise show the way he did.

&amp;#x200B;

But if it wasn't him, if it was this Faceless Woman, then mayhaps it makes more sense.  She was shocked because she assumed, from her observations, that the riff between Arya and Sansa was coming to a head.  And she did the only thing she could think to do in that situation:  beg and plead for her life.  The true Baelish probably would have handled the situation a lot better, spoken more deftly, and maintained his cool much better.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm convinced he's still alive, and that the Faceless Woman is the one Arya executed.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR:

&amp;#x200B;

Baelish is an agent of the Iron Bank sent to Westeros to destabilize it so that the IB can seize control.

He was taking too long so the IB dispatched a Faceless Woman to take over.

She was caught by surprise and executed by Arya after Baelish left Winterfell.",32,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

 That's where Little Sam comes in. When we last left off, the white walkers broke the wall and began their march, but to where?

I noticed Jamie said something to the effect of he'd rather die than live a cripple (about Bran). Interesting considering his fate but then to Ned he also said regarding how his father died he couldn't think of a worse death than being burned alive. I can see him riding into the NK dragon and getting torched, there is also a ton of wildfire under the castle...

I mentioned this in a previous post but when Ned was caught off guard and Littlefinger put a dagger to his throat it reminded me of Littlefingers own demise. I wonder if Bran set this up on purpose for him to get his throat cut from behind. The Starks could have easily had his head lopped off or killed him many ways. But how Arya did it reminded me of when he came from behind and put his own dagger to Ned's throat. 

Ned watching Arya learn to fight with a sad look on his face because he knows how poorly it turned out for his sister...

Ned was kicked out as Hand for not wanting Dany harmed many claimed since Jon is a Targ BUT he also went far beyond by objecting to Renley's proposal of capturing Joffrey for fear he would be harmed and also warned Cersei earlier to leave for fear of what Robert would do to Cersei's kids. Beyond just Dany, Ned went out of his way to protect children (disgusted at the baker boys death by the hound) Ned basically died trying NOT to harm Joffrey. In the end he went with littlefinger over renley (wow such a bad choice) and tried to use the guard to take Joff but stressed he wanted no blood. My conclusion, Ned must have been REAL traumatized from when the Lannisters took Kings Landing...

Loaning money - in Kings Landing its a big deal that the Lannisters own essentially Robert because the kingdom owes them so much money...I feel like historically when royalty owed someone a lot it didn't go well for the people they owed. The Lannisters were dug in but it seems like Robert had options to get rid of his debt in more nefarious ways. Granted its a show and Robert was by all accounts an honorable (even if he had other faults) king but I feel like it would have occurred to someone to just kill all the Lannisters and you're free of the debt. No one on that side was devious or lacked ""honor"" enough. Although again historically you usually make up an excuse to knock off the people you owe money to in order to justify it...

Joffrey gets slapped a lot and it is comedy gold. 

Multiple viewings is really the way to go, having read a few of the books and watched the show its much more satisfying the second time...also binge watching helps. ",19,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

The video goes in depth about the prince that was promised and how it could be a play on words for the sacrificial male babies given to the Night King. The Night King has been searching/waiting for his replacement, and requires the blood of both a Stark and a Targaryen. The night king has the capabilities of seeing into the future and is coming for the future baby of Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen. Perhaps, the prince that was promised is the sacrifice Jon and Daenerys will have to make to protect their people...I don't want to give to much information out and not give credit to Talking Thrones, so go watch the video.

But something I have come to realize about Valyrian Steel is that it is actually dragon glass or some mix of dragon glass and steel. I was rewatching some of the episodes and came across an season 7 episode 1 (dragonglass) where Samwell is reading about the dragonglass. Well, I was a little curious so when Samwell reaches the page where a dagger is shown (one that looks like the dagger that was used to try and assassinate Bran) and paused. I began to read the page on my own, and it says that dragon fire was used to forge weapons out of the dragonglass. At the time I just assumed it was the dragonglass that we had already seen, but later when littlefinger gives the dagger to Bran, for some reason it hit me that Valyrian Steel, as we know, can kill White Walkers, that's when it clicked that what the dragons were forging wasn't the glass we had already seen, but it was valyrian steel. So what I expect is that soon we will see dragons forging valyrian steel once again, not a huge spoiler, but thought it was interesting, maybe it leads to something more? not sure.

For a series that has such high attention to detail, something I'm finding oddly jarring are the inconsistencies in actors' accents. Westeros is loosely based on Britain with northerners having northern accents (e.g. Sean Bean), southerners having southern ones (e.g. Charles Dance) and even more southern still having generic Hispanic ones (e.g. Pedro Pascal). 

This works for the overall immersion, so why do none of the Stark children have a northern accent? Why does Ser Alliser, from the Crownlands, have a northern accent, as does Samwell Tarly, another southerner? Why do people from Braavos have any and every accent? Ditto with North of the Wall - Tormund, Ygritte and Orell have completely different accents - none of them Scottish (even though Rose Leslie is Scottish), which would play into the idea that the Wall is a scaled up Hadrian's Wall - despite them all being from the same tribe (as far as I know).

This is when Aemon says his last words (in the show)  Egg, I dreamed that I was old. Im sitting at work, not working, but Im obsessing over this line. 

Is it possible that Aemon was actually experiencing a dragon dream? Targaryens are known for these prophetic dreams. Is it possible that young Aemon has a dream in which he saw himself as an old man but only understood it as a dream and not reality? Did we witness a situation similar to that of Hodor? 

Imagine this: HBO releases a miniseries in the appropriate timeline. Young and pre Maester vows Aemon wakes up and says Egg, I dreamed that I was old!

If we think of this with the Bran/Willis/Hodor connection it certainly seems so.  That being said, Im feeling extra tinfoily this morning. ",7,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Is it possible that the Prince/Princess that was promised is not a hero but rather a sacrifice? And they keep saying Prince which makes me think of someone who is not yet king or Queen (this would exclude Jon since he technically is the true heir, making him King) so the Prince/Princess that was promised is actually Dany. So in conclusion the Knight King is headed south because he was promised a Prince and has not yet received him/her so the truce between them and man has been broken and the only way to send them back is to sacrifice a Prince or Princess. Now this leads into Danys vision where she saw the Iron thrown destroyed, covered in snow, meaning the Knight King is in Kings landing towards the end. In her last visit she went beyond the wall and then saw her dead family. This translates to her going with the Knight King beyond the Wall and sacrificing herself. So she gives up the chance to sit on the Iron throne to give herself to the Knight King and Jon becomes King and she ends up being the Princess that was Promised.

While watching this episode again(rewatching the entire series for the millionth time, cuz why not?) I noticed that at the end, when the wildlings ft. Jon reach the top of the wall, it is at sunrise. However, since the wall faces North, shouldnt the sun be rising ON THE RIGHT SIDE? And not on their left as is shown in that scene?

Forgive me if this is a stupid question, but I really want to know what's wrong with my thinking process here(if anything's wrong that is)

Here's a picture of said scene;

Currently from what I've gathered is that he was once named Wylis, a normal boy who was working under House Stark. He had a seizure because Future Bran (considered future because he appears in the timeline of when Hodor was still Wylis) accidentally warged into him while exploring the past with the Three-Eyed Raven. During the seizure, Wylis can hear ""hold the door"" coming from Meera which was being transmitted by the Bran in present time to the Bran warging into Wylis in the past, so Future Bran (?) in Wylis's point of view. He repeats it until Hodor is the only thing that's left of his speech. After the seizure, I guess it left him mentally disabled so he can only say Hodor AND he is aware of how his death will occur in the future? 

Let's say Future Bran DIDN'T accidentally warg into Wylis in that moment the White Walkers and Wights stormed the cave. Would Hodor suddenly regain proper speech during that scene since he would never have that seizure from being warged into? If that's the case, then Hodor should have normal speech throughout the entire series IF future bran never warged into him when he was exploring the past with the Three-Eyed Raven.

Or am I misinterpreting what warging does?

Also, did Wylis SEE Future Bran in the moment that he was warged into?

Someone please ease my mind

However, the original prophecy from the wood witch spoke of only The Prince That Was Promised that would be born from the Aerys II-Rhaella line. Whether it refers to a man or a woman, it refers to only one person from that line. 

&amp;#x200B;

Rhaegar was so obsessed with the prophecy that he felt he needed to name his children Rhaenys, Aegon and Visenya. He felt Aegon alone wouldn't be able to fulfil the prophecy, that he needed two sisters to help him, like Aegon the Conqueror. Obviously, that didn't work out with Elia Martell giving birth to only Rhaenys and Aegon and so he went to Lyanna, hoping she would give birth to Visenya. That also didn't pan out. Instead, we got another Aegon, and Elia's children died. 

&amp;#x200B;

So now most people are speculating that the three heads are three of the following choices: Dany, Jon, Tyrion, Night King, Jaime, Bran. But Rhaegar never considered that the dragon's three heads refers to three random Targaryens, he just needed them to be siblings. So much so that he married Lyanna, triggering a war, to ensure there would be a Visenya. By Rhaegar's logic, the above choices wouldn't be good enough. Pick any trio and they wouldn't have a strong enough bond like the original Aegon, Visenya and Rhaenys. 

&amp;#x200B;

So which three characters, preferably siblings, preferably one boy with two sisters, do we know that fit Rhaegar's vision?   


Jon, Arya and Sansa. We know Jon is Aegon. The only ""sisters"" he has are Arya and Sansa. If we are to take Bran at his word that he's just the Three-Eyed Raven now, then that becomes even more poignant. I'm not saying Arya and Sansa are secret Targaryens or will ride dragons or will marry Jon. But the idea of 'the dragon must have three heads' is not unlike 'the lone wolf dies, but the pack survives'. The fact that Dany has/had three dragons is irrelevant; it's about unity, not actual dragons.  Jon might be the Prince That Was Promised, but he needs his sisters. Arya, like her idol Visenya, is a warrior who dabbles in dark arts and is skilled with a sword. Sansa, like Rhaenys, is more lady-like and understands diplomacy. When the truth about Jon is revealed, you can bet Sansa and Arya will stand beside Jon. The last teaser seemed to highlight the importance of this trio in the final season as well.  


And let's not forget when Tywin spoke to Arya about Aegon and his feats, Arya countered him, saying, ""Aegon and his sisters. It wasn't just Aegon riding his dragon. It was Rhaenys and Visenya too.""

&amp;#x200B;

Arya &amp; the Hound: be nice to see his response to the new assassin killer Arya not the child he last saw.

Brienne &amp; Jamie: want to see if a romance is finally realised. Also she has a good effect on him.

Brienne &amp; Jamie &amp; Tormund: just fot the laughs

Brienne &amp; Jamie &amp; Tormmund &amp; the Hound: that's got to be the funniest &amp; contradictory foursome of Westeros

Sam &amp; Jon &amp; Jorah: both Jon &amp; Jorah love Daenerys but owe their life to Sam. How will they deal with Daenerys's excution of Sam's family? What will be Sam's reaction to her?

Arya &amp; Jon: no need to explain sibling love (NOT the Lannister sort) 

Jon &amp; Bran: Jon's reaction to Bran as the three eyed raven &amp; learning the truth about his true parents

Bran &amp; Jamie: seeing Bran will bring some guilty feelings to this 'new' Jamie. Bran now as the three eyed raven will know everything. But won't care much now. It will be awkward meeting.

Lastly Daenerys &amp; Sansa: two powerful women who aspire to be great leaders. How will Sansa greet her? How will she react when she learns Jon has bent the knee to her?

Jaime was in the King's Guard at the time, so he is ruled out.

Did Cersei become Lady of Casterly Rock upon Tywin's death? If so, who ruled over the Rock while she was imprisoned by the High Sparrow? Did Kevan rule it in her stead?

Was Jaime named Lord of Casterly Rock ofscreen, as he is seen commanding the Lannister armies in season 7, after he was removed from the King's Guard?

""With Targaryens it's like flip of a coin"" - when Dany finds out about Jon's legitimacy she goes mad and tries or does kill Jon, like Targaryen level mad. The Northern Alliance falls dawn, Jamie dies in Brianna's arms, and Arya takes his face. By this time all survivors go south.   
Meanwhile in King's Landing....   
Qyburn proved he can manipulate life and death with The Mountain. With the help of remains of the dead soldier he produced some kind of way to mass kill the rest of the dead. Cersei is now happy to wait in King's city for the armies of the dead.   
Back to the heroes....   
Onion knight, Starks, Lilly and the rest are together, trying to come up with some plan. Dany is alone mad and confused with her 2 dragons (her armies are gone).  
Finally... (Lena Headey - ""the end is satisfactory"")  
Qyburn and Cersei succesfully defeat the white, they are called saviours of the world, everybody loves them, Melisandre comes back to call Qyburn the almighty Azor Ahai. Then Jamie is back, and kills Cersei and the red priesstes (arya meets melisandre, melisandre dies in westeros, Cersei dies by her brother's hand even tho it was Arya)

The Reeds are crannogmen, part-humans believed to be related to the Children, hence their small stature, timid nature, and strong connection to magic and the earth.  Howland Reed is one of two known people to have made it to the Isle of Faces, home of the largest amount of surviving Weirwood trees in the Seven Kingdoms, where the pact between the Children and the First Men occurred.  He spent years there on the island that is rumored to still be the home of remaining Children and the Green Men who protect the trees.

First thing Howland Reed did when he left the island was to go to the Tourney of Harrenhall.  There, he was bullied by three knights competing, and was saved by Lyanna Stark.  Through her, he became friends with the Stark brothers.  They offered Howland a chance to redeem himself against the three men, but Howland knew he was tiny and no fighter. The Knight of the Laughing Tree, a mysterious nameless Knight in mismatched armor with a painted-on Weirwood Tree, then entered the Tourney and beat the three men who had bullied Howland.  When the Knight of the Laughing Tree became infamous and promptly disappeared, King Aerys sent his son Rhaegar to find ""him"" and discover his true identity.

It's believed that Lyanna Stark was the one who disguised herself as the Knight of the Laughing Tree, and that this is how Rhaegar and Lyanna formed their first connection.  Howland seems to have been a vital character in the uniting of Ice and Fire.

Howland then later was amongst the men with Ned Stark at the Tower of Joy when he went to find Lyanna.  No fighter, Howland still went up against some of the most talented fighters in the Seven Kingdoms, and with Ned, was one of only two survivors.  Howland stabbed Ser Arthur Dayne in the back, saving Ned's life.  Howland, who is still alive, is the only person in Westeros who can be a first-hand witness that Jon is the true son of Lyanna and Rhaegar.  He kept it a secret for all of these years. He never even mentioned his heroism to his own children.

Years later, Howland sent his children Jojen and Meera to Bran.  He knows that Jojen sees visions in his dreams.  It's probably something unsurprising to him.  Howland's two children then became the ones responsible for getting Bran to the Three Eyed Raven.

And yet, Howland has been mysteriously absent from the present-day plotline, despite the fact that he is still alive and well and has been so vital in setting important events in motion.

Why has he been absent all this time??  We've seen him only twice in the show, in the TOJ scenes.  My guess is his mysterious absence is because he would be able to easily answer many of the questions we've had throughout the series.  If my memory is right, GRRM has said that some characters he had to wait off to introduce because they would be able to ruin all of the mysteries.

Meera left Bran last season to return home to her family.  We know GoT doesn't let main characters just leave to safety and never come back.  My guess is Meera will come back with her father Howland and he will end up being a very important resource and character in the last season.

So what do you think could happen if Howland Reed comes into the story in S8?  Possibilities I can think of are:
1. He confirms to Westeros that Jon is a Targaryen and is Lyanna and Rhaegar's son.
2. He has knowledge from his time on the Isle of Faces, and also possibly from visions, that is essential for defeating the White Walkers.
3. He is an invaluable embassador for recruiting any remaining Children and/or Green Men from the Isle of Faces to fight in the war for the living.
4.  He helps Bran get to the Isle of Faces.  Bran would be his strongest there, amongst the Weirwoods.

She will most likely be gearing up to defeat the rest of danys retreating forces. Cersei will have the Golden companies army and eurons. Which have no losses. Lannisters are on danys side. Which means the only army capable of taking cersei on would be the night kings army. They are 100k strong and only defeatable via fire and dragon glass, something cersei doesnt have. Another way cersei can get defeated would be via eurons death. If REE... Theon can kill him. Eurons army will most likely be led by theons sister. Meaning cersei will have only the Golden company at her disposal. But the Golden company does state that they favor statics not bets. Meaning they will most likely pull out of her power. Making cersei powerless. We havent seen the unsullied so that could potentially play a role but idk how I would fit them. John becoming the night king to defeat the true evil is bitter sweet imo.

Tyrells: ""Growing Strong"" suggests to me they are farmers: they seek to play the long game. Margery shows aptitude gaining the favor of the people.

Martells: I only watch TV and they seem like a rather pleasure seeking house.

Arryns: Not sure

Boltons: To strike fear? To gain the north? 

Targaryans: Aerys and Dany seem quite different. Also not sure if they really have a goal. Maybe rule through strength (dragons initially, then armies)

In the later seasons we have seen a more aggressive side of her so why should this change now.  


I believe she will refuse the advice of the other men at Winterfell and take both of her dragons to go and look for Viserion and ""end the battle before it begins"" with Daenerys gone this would also be the perfect chance for Bran to reveal to Jon his true heritage.   


After Daenerys sees yet another house burnt to a crisp she comes to the army of the dead and starts burning them. After a short while Daenerys sees the blue flames of Viserion hit Rhaegal, Rhaegal falls from the sky and lands on the ground, At this moment thousands of wrights jump on Rhaegal piercing the flesh of the beast. Daenerys realizing she has made a terrible decision quickly flys back to Winterfell .  


Back at Winterfell after the news has broken about Jons true hertiage and that Daenerys mistaken could have just lost them the war she starts to lose the support of some of her most loyal followers and perhaps even her army, Drogon now the last remaining dragon will no longer follow the orders of Daenerys who flies away just as soon as the Dead have reached the gates of Winterfell.  


As Daenerys is now a liability on the battlefield she is brought down to the crypts of Winterfell with a few other non essential personnel, Whilst all the fighting is happening on the outside Daenerys realizes that without the support of her followers and now that she is no longer the last living Targaryen she runs out of Winterfell through one of the hidden passages as she begins her search for Drogon, This will be the last time we see Daenerys for quite some time.

 

After the battle of Winterfell is over the remaining survivors look for Daenerys when they are unable to find her they believe that she was killed in the battle, they turn their attention to Jon as now he is the true heir to the iron throne, After a heated discussion Jon understands that its in his best interest to now pursue the iron throne as Jon now holds command of the remaining  survivors of the Unsullied, The Northern Army,  Wildlings and perhaps the Dorthraki, Perhaps Tyrion has convinced the Dorthraki and the Unsullied to avenge their queen by fighting for Jon remember they all believe she has died in the war.  


After the battle of Kings Landing with the Golden Company and Lannister soldiers vs Unsullied, North Army, Wildlings, Dorthraki and Cersei is killed Jon looks to resume his place on the Iron Throne as he goes to walk towards the Iron Throne, Daenerys comes flying through the throne room with Drogon, Daenerys goes on a rant about how she has been betrayed by everyone and after being away for so long she realizes that her father was right and she should ""Burn them All"" as she turns to Drogon she begins to scream the word Dracarys but before she could finish Jon drives his sword in the back of Daenerys killing her, Drogon turns around and burns Jon alive.   


Throne room now nearly burnt to a crisp both Daenerys and Jon dead at the bottom of the Iron Throne, A discussion is hold as the remaining survivors discuss who should sit on the Iron Throne, There are only 3 legitimate chances to sit on the throne, Sansa, Gendry and Tyrion. Sansa decides its best for her to honor her ancestors and return back to Winterfell where she will look to rebuild her families legacy, Which then leaves 2, Gendry decides that after he has witnessed what having power can do to you he declines the opportunity to sit on the throne which leaves Tyrion to become King Tyrion.  


You get your bittersweet ending with Tyrion on the throne and both Jon and Daenerys dead.",17,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Range. In our first test we've seen the scorption outrange a dragon by a small amount. How much air time did the bolt have? Maybe 1-2 seconds worth. That's a fair amount of advantage for this era.
2. Replaceability. Dragons are probably hard to replace, meaning you have to be more careful with them compared to replaceable armaments.
3. Vulnerability. The scorpion is quite destructable but point 2 somewhat mitigates this.   
I think people are not considering how significant downing a dragon is. It gets its overwhelming force through air superiority. If you down it you could retrench your men and focus on fights elsewhere, sending in people to finish the job on the dragon later.   
If a spear tip hurts it imagine a catapulted boulder. Probably kill it.  
Crippling wounds could probably be achieved. Consider how a bolt ripping a chunk of wing would do. A shot to the neck. To the gut. Poison and maybe ice may make even a flesh wound deadly.   
The greatest armor of all is plot armor and we saw the once invincible force get downed not once but twice in S7.  

4. Tactical changes. The dragon totally changes the battlefield. The scorpion's presence does so again in turn. Imagine if you were confronted by a group of very fast 6 year olds. With a napalm water pistol you could easily dispatch them, hell you could probably bite them to death. But now give them pebbles. A lucky pebble to the eye may totally neutralize you but it doesn't take that to put you on the defensive or get you to run. You don't want a storm of pebbles to the gut, the head, the knees, really anywhere. You no longer have free reign and may actually need reinforcements to deal with some of the army before you can get in close to torch them.
5. Scale. This is the game ender. As we all know, ships can be rebuilt and scaled up massively. In time the scale advantage of the scorpion makes dragons less of a threat until eventually they become an interesting ariel artillery piece, not enough to take a castle or even a battlefield alone.

I don't think it comes down to dragons anymore guys. I think that plot device has had its course and men will decide who is queen from here.",31,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

&gt;I have not worn a shoe in twenty years, he told Brienne. The first year, I had more blisters than I had toes, and my soles would bleed like pigs whenever I trod on a hard stone, but I prayed and the Cobbler Above turned my skin to leather.  
&gt;  
&gt;There is no cobbler above, Podrick protested.  
&gt;  
&gt;There is, lad . . . though you may call him by another name. Tell me, which of the seven gods do you love best?  
&gt;  
&gt;The Warrior, said Podrick without a moments hesitation.  
&gt;  
&gt;Brienne cleared her throat. At Evenfall my fathers septon always said that there was but one god.  
&gt;  
&gt;One god with seven aspects. Thats so, my lady, and you are right to point it out, but the mystery of the Seven Who Are One is not easy for simple folk to grasp, and I am nothing if not simple, so I speak of seven gods. Meribald turned back to Podrick. I have never known a boy who did not love the Warrior. I am old, though, and being old, I love the Smith. Without his labor, what would the Warrior defend? Every town has a smith, and every castle. They make the plows we need to plant our crops, the nails we use to build our ships, iron shoes to save the hooves of our faithful horses, the bright swords of our lords. No one could doubt the value of a smith, and so we name one of the Seven in his honor, but we might as easily have called him the Farmer or the Fisherman, the Carpenter or the Cobbler. What he works at makes no matter. What matters is, he works. The Father rules, the Warrior fights, the Smith labors, and together they perform all that is rightful for a man. Just as the Smith is one aspect of the godhead, the Cobbler is one aspect of the Smith. It was he who heard my prayer and healed my feet.

Now I was raised catholic, and in my country there's a catholic phenomena regarding the [Santo Nio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santo_Nio), or the child Jesus. A friend brought up in an evangelical congregation was baffled with the Catholic worship of the Santo Nio. They read up their ASOIAF and I was able to explain it in ASOIAF terms using the above chapter. So yeah, there's this trinity thing like the Seven in ASOIAF, and Jesus is part of that trinity like the Smith is of the Seven. And the Santo Nio is an aspect of Jesus (specifically him as an infant) in a similar way that Meribald's Cobbler Above is an aspect of divine work that the Smith represents. 

It's a bit a roundabout way of describing it, but it works. George is actually an okay Catholic theologian. ",7,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

There are a few key points to sum up the theory that Tyrion may very well be a Targaryen:

1. The hatred Tywin has towards him is unnaturally strong, stronger than you could expect towards his own child (even given his reasons). Perhaps his wife had Tyrion with another man (a Targaryen).
2. Tyrion's mother died during child birth, the same happened with Daenerys and Jon, both of which we know are Targaryens. A pattern developing here?
3. Tyrion was able to approach the dragons in the crypt and they were accepting of him just as they were to Jon on the cliff side. The only three characters we've ever seen this with are yet again Daenerys, Jon and Tyrion.
4. ""The dragon has three heads, three dragon riders, blah blah..."" Basically, it is believed that there must be one rider for each of the three dragons. There was always Daenerys, then eventually Jon, leaving a need for one more (seems they all need to be Targaryens).
5. Probably other big points I'm forgetting to mention.

Anyway, all of those points strongly suggested that Tyrion may be half Lannister half Targaryen (or some combination of the two). 

**BUT, after the loss of Viserion, there are now just 2 dragons remaining on the side of the living leaving no real need for a third rider; that or the Night King is now the third rider. Either way, should we see either of these possibilities as a sign that the show is telling us Tyrion is in fact just a Lannister and Tywin really does hate him that much even though they are blood related?**",92,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

He reanimated Jon Snow so that he would have to be rescued by Dany beyond the wall, giving the Night King a dragon which he could use to melt the wall. He may have reanimated Beric Dondarrion so that he could save Jon beyond the wall or do something in season 8.

The sorcerer that castrated Varys caused a blue flame which spoke, which could be why Varys is helping Dany as he knows the she can help defeat the Night King. This is only true if the Night King can control flames as the lord of light does. 

The Lady Mellisandre believes that Stannis is the Prince the was promised, Azor Ahai, due to her visions in the flames. This could all be to lead Stannis north of the wall where he rescues Jon Snow and results in an alliance with the Freefolk. After Stannis serves his purpose, he dies shortly after. We know that the lord of light must have had a purpose for Stannis as the Shadow was born by the Red Woman. If the shadow had not been born, Renly and Stannis would have fought and Stannis would have been killed as he had much fewer men.

The Red Priestesses that preach for Dany in Mereen and across slavers bay do so so that she will win the war against the slavers and the dragons will be free to go north of the wall to rescue Jon Snow. One of the conditions of surrender to the Slave Masters was that Dany's Dragons would be killed, which would mean the Night King could never get south of the wall.

I'm not suggesting that the Night King is R'hllor, just that all the actions attributed to the lord of light are actually done by the Night King.

People say it a overrrated series. Then they are fools im not kind of person who influenced with series for nothing. It a great show full of dept n mysteries n so much more.. maybe they are stupid enough that they can't dogust or collect puzzle pieces.

1st three seasons were great exploring characters n whole land etc
Then here comes 4th season which is one of best season till now
5th one is kinda boring feels like watching a filler(not relevant to original source) season. Still i watched 
6th one was litness overloadee i mean s06e09 full of battles n fights loved it s06e10's first 30mins of (high sparrow destruction) episode just a music n thing happening loved that part. Whole epsiode was greatness
Then season 7 i was so hyped when i started that season but i have to be honest it is not as good as it sounds still worthy one. Cant wait for season 8.

Most poeple liked this show cuz of dragons, wars n THAT. But i liked it cuz of its in dept world, n characters. Mysteries arround through out the show The childern, raven, direwolf, white walker n clan etc

Eddard Stark's discovery of the illegitimacy of Cersei's kids rests on his understanding of the genetics of hereditary traits and a book of the history of the Houses of Westeros that informs him that the Baratheons are always 'black of hair', while Joffrey has 'golden hair'.

Since black hair is dominant, and blond hair recessive, Joffrey cannot be Robert's kid. The fact that Eddard understands this instantly tells us that these things are known in the seven kingdoms, at least among somewhat educated nobles and burghers.

If that is true, than it should also be readily apparent that Bran is not the kid of Eddard and Catelyn, because they both have blue eyes, whereas he has brown eyes. Since blue eyes is a recessive trait, two blue-eyed people can never have a brown-eyed kid.

Same is probably true for Jon Snow and his alleged parents: his black hair says he cannot be (blond) Raeghar's and (dark blonde to brunette) Lyanna's son. ""But Lyanna's hair looks pretty dark in the birth scene in the tower, she might be black of hair, after all,"" you say? Unlikely, for she is Eddard's sister, he is blond, which means he likely doesn't have a black-haired parent, therefore neither does she. From what we've seen so far, it looks as though we're asked to believe Jon Targaeryen has darker hair than both his parents, which is...peculiar, to say the least.

I'd be more than willing to suspend disbelief for the sake of immersion, but since it (genetics, knowledge of heredity of traits) is such an explicit and important part of the story, this seeming lack of logical consistency bothers me.

I'm not a geneticist, maybe I got something wrong, maybe it isn't that important...what's your take?",16,1,False,self,,,,,

I would suggest to Robert making these vows mandatory.

We are shown war-ravaged country sides and the books detail the bloody impact the wars have on the common folk, after countless battles both on and off screen, Jaime has no problem mustering an army to sack Highgarden or lay siege to Riverrun. There are armies full of CGI soldiers that seem to grow in size as the story progresses (no doubt to make the battle grander and more epic).

As I read the books, I was struck by a feeling of hopelessness not unlike I felt when I get my first paycheck of the month and all the big bills come out before I pay for groceries or bar tabs. There's just not enough people to go around and the armies of Westeros are not just wasting time fighting each other but they're reducing their own power.

This has been something of a narrative Gordian Knot - you have to make the threat to the north more ominous as time goes by, but you also have to make the action South of the Wall more and more exciting. Thus, the threat north of the wall grows while the resiliency south of the wall should decline.

Which brings my to my concern...

The writers seem to have set up a Hive Queen Trope for S8 - you kill all the minions if you kill their leader. The un-stated (as of yet) implication seems to be that killing the Night King may end the entire threat in one stroke, or that the huge armies of wights can be ignored if you just focus on killing the white walkers. We've seen this solution so many times before - Star Trek, Stargate, Enders Game, Lord of the Rings, Edge of Tomorrow, to name a few - I feel like it'll be a huge narrative cop-out that basically nullifies the poor decisions to fight the wrong wars for the previous 7 seasons.

So what do you think? Is there *any chance* this isn't going to be the final strategy? If it is, am I the only one that will feel a bit... robbed of the payoff we've been building toward for 7 seasons?",34,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Cersei betraying Jon and Dany has to have some sort of consequence and the Night King is going to have to be defeated somehow.

Considering the forces of Jon/Dany are the only ones fighting the Night King, they are going to have to be the ones to defeat him. Therefore for Cersei's betrayal to have consequence, it has to leave the forces of Dany weak enough for Cersei to be the victor in the war for the crown.

However that cannot be the end of the story. Cersei's death has been prophecised, so it will come to pass (unless the life choked out of her is that of her unborn child). Jaime will kill Cersei as he did with the Mad King. He cannot abide by the atrocities she has committed in her lust for power and more importantly, he cannot abide by the atrocities she will commit in the future. Yet Jaime will not survive it this time. He has already suffered through the torment of being a Kingslayer and he will not do it again - especially when the Queen is also both his lover and family. Jaime will kill Cersei then take his own life.

That will leave the throne in the hands of Cersei's heir: Tyrion.",26,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

The only major television event between now and then is the Grammys and the Oscars. I would expect to see a trailer during at least one of those events. I wouldnt expect anything that would come close to spoiling story but it would be closer to a summer blockbuster trailer, lots of action and suspense.
The marketing budget was $20mil for this season. There will be large trailers during big television events to get people interested enough to subscribe to an hbo service and start watching.
The Grammys are Sunday, February 10th. Which is exactly 8 weeks before the new seasons release date.
I cant promise anything, but I can infer that we will have an actual trailer that night. The Grammys were also heavily promoted during the superbowl, and fans of the bud light commercial story line (thats a real thing) were introduced to GoT in spectacular fashion.

  Then we have the direwolf with each a pup for the stark children did he warg it down so they can find them. At first I thought it was fleeing the white walkers.

Dany - being influenced by the delusions of her megalomaniacal brother - insists on her birthright as a Targaryen, the crimes of her father that led to his ouster and killing notwithstanding. The Targaryens conquered the Seven Kingdoms with blood and fire, so they basically own them forever, or so her 'reasoning' goes. (She doesn't really give these matters much thought, being absolutely convinced of her divine prerogative proven by her inflammability)

The conflicting claim is held by Gendry, Robert's remaining heir. If his father's rebellion was justified, and we have no reason to assume otherwise, he is the rightful king. We already know his blood to be rather potent even in small doses, having killed three kings from a distance. We also know Gendry welded, rowed, and ran along for seven seasons without apparent use for anyone, a future on the throne would justify his odyssey. A Dany regency, on the other hand, would post-humously exculpate or at least make irrelevant the Mad King's crimes. 

It seems probable that Gendry will live (and perhaps marry one of the Stark girls) He's humble, strong, good-natured and hasn't wronged anyone.

Dany has said she cannot bear children, already lost one dragon, looks moribund, has a massive stream of insanity running in the family, and is in an incestuous relationship with her cousin, who is literally a Walking Dead.

This all doesn't bode too well for her...This being GoT, anything's possible, but my bet is on Gendry on the throne and a heroic death for Dany and Jon. ",56,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I imagine king's landing to suffer a really devastating attack, it could be a double-battle. The northern walk south to flee the WW but cersei refuses to open the gates of the city to them, so Daenerys and her forces sack the city, and at the same time time the night king arrives and attack them all. so the losses may be so considerable that even Daenerys loses interest in the iron throne.

after the war is over, a new ""democratic"" system comes into being, with a ""council"" instead of a ""king"": the members of that council may be several people representing several regions, like Sansa from the North, Samuel Tarly, Robbin Arryn from the vale,  Gendry from the stormlands...each one runs his own region independently, but they meet together in the capital to discuss the affairs that concern all westeros

in this way cersei dies as the first and last queen of Westeros ever, and the Wheel is broken.

Some can play the game and play it well. the court are puppets dancing on their strings. Tywin Lannister, Olenna Tyrell, Tyrion Lannister they all know the rules and how to win. And then there are Varys and Littlefinger who play a game unseen to all but whose subtle fluctuations shift and twist the fortunes of the Game and all it's players. They are the two most powerful men in Westeros, whose influence reaches unobserved from the sandy reaches of Dorne up through the Riverlands and the Neck and far into the North. The fate of Westeros is ultimately not decided by the Direwolf, the Lion, the Stag or even the Dragon.

Since this person didnt exist I couldnt find anything so I re-winded, turned on CC, and the lines read our man Jamie. Anyway I turned it off and decided a break was necessary.

I know that fire, Valerian steel, and dragon glass are some of the ways in which you can easily kill basic white walkers, but it seems that from the Hardhome episode, special white walkers like the Night King are resistant or even immune to fire. Potentially, Daenerys could have one of her dragons breathe a fuckton of fire on the Night King and it wouldn't even faze him.

So assuming those white walkers are immune to fire, then killing the Night King would probably entail combat that's up close and personal.

Why did they have that scene when Melisandre took off the necklace? What importance will that have in S8 if any.

What kind of magic is the magic in Asshai? It doesnt seem to be like dragon (fire) magic or white walker (ice) magic or children of the forest (forest???) magic.

I read the first book and after struggling through 50 pages of specific writing that GG Martin has, I got hooked. I love the first book, it is a great story although it has a sad ending. After beginning the second book, I got bored halfway, on Theon's betrayal quest and threw a towel. I am sorry ASOIF fans...

However, I recently started watching the show, I got through both season 1 and 2 fairly quickly and still enjoyed it because  I think story wise it was very well written and produced. I must note that season 1, particularly, blew me away of how close certain characters were portrayed. I got through season 3 and 4 last weekend and I think they were good, although I noticed a change in the tone of the show after the Red Wedding. 

Yesterday I started season 5, and honestly it becomes a little boring, I quickly googled events of the season as well as season 6 and to be honest. It seems that Season 5 is quite bad.

Also, I started to notice that somewhere after season 3, the show started slowly changing. It seems as if the show has main characters and an overarching plot that will finally bring all of them together somewhere in the future, however, for now, I am stuck on some kind of feeler episode/Season.

It seems that show became sort of Harry Potter on steroids, I have no longer the same feeling towards the characters. For example, although I have not seen the whole 7 Seasons I am certain that some characters will stay alive, just to the fact that I feel that the writers are protecting them. I also started to notice trend toward bromances and womances, which is pleasing but irritating, the whole beauty of the Season 1 and 2, was that no one knew who is a friend and who is the enemy, the reality of human nastiness was depicted more clearly, and even though I knew that Ned will be betrayed by Littlefinger I still felt pinch in the hart when it happened. After season 3, I started slowly noticing the trend where I was no longer worried about certain characters, like Arya. I was almost certain in some of her adventures, that she will be alive and well.

Also, the redemption arc of the Jamie, was cut short, which kind of sucked.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is, am I the only one that seems to feel this way towards the show?  ",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Dallas MegaGames will be putting on a production of [Aegon's Conquest](https://www.pcgamer.com/this-game-of-thrones-tabletop-game-is-so-big-it-needs-33-players/) in Plano, Texas on **Saturday, March 9th!**

&gt;*It is the Age of Conquest, three centuries before the events of Game of Thrones. Westeros stands as a fractured continent, with seven warring kingdoms jostling each other for power and dominance. A new power has invaded from Old Valyria, bringing with them fire and blood. The time is now ripe to establish yourselves as the strongest Kingdom of the realm and unite Westeros under your banner. Claim victory in this continent-spanning war and forge the Iron Throne!*

##What's this all about?
---
Aegons Conquest is a medieval fantasy themed tabletop megagame, meaning that it is an interactive experience where a large number of players work either together or against each other to affect the greater storyline. Aegons Conquest is a team-based competitive endeavor with tightly defined rules and player options. The game aligns its players into eight major factions of four players each with the ultimate goal to have the most points by the end. It encourages face-to-face diplomacy, tactical play, secret dealings, betrayal, and heartfelt roleplaying. The game is based on the history and deep lore as presented in the A Song of Ice &amp; Fire literary series, though knowledge of the source material is not needed to play or run this game.  


In practice, the game plays like a combination of **Diplomacy**, **Settlers of Catan** and **Risk**. Players are separated into teams of four, each with distinct roles, and vie against other teams for the Iron Throne. 


Full rules for the game, created by /u/DefDanger can be found [here!](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/248012/Aegons-Conquest-MegaGame) (for free!)

##How do I get involved?

Tickets are on sale now, via [eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/aegons-conquest-a-megagame-tickets-53027742405).

Feel free to read up on the rules before showing up, but if you don't have time for that, the game is easy to learn and we'll be going over it with everyone as we get started.

HOW THE CHILDREN AND FIRST MEN WON THE BATTLE OF THE DAWN

To help better understand this speculation, facts explicitly presented in the show and documented as fact in the GoT wiki are bolded.  The rest is my speculation.

Going back in time...

the first men arrive and have conflict with Children of The Forest because they showed no respect for weirwood trees, cutting them down which threatened to decimate this magic/religious resource.  Children were few in number and losing the battle so they took an extreme act and made the white walkers.  

This was complex magic - taking a first man and driving dragon glass into his heart, turning him into a white walker.  After that, any contact with a dragon glass dagger was deadly to a white walker.  The Children of the Forest had control of the white walkers because 1) they had the deadly dragon glass weapons (which the first men did not have) and 2) they had control of their numbers.  The way they maintained control of their numbers was by making it impossible for white walkers to make more white walkers.  White walkers could not create new white walkers because they couldnt touch dragon glass.

So, how did the Children of the Forest lose control of the white walkers?

With this novel, complex magic that created the white walkers, it unintentionally imbued the walkers with the ability to create wights from mens corpses.  These corpse soldiers were disposed of with regular weapons, but it was simple for the white walkers to raise legions of them. It gave the walkers a much greater power of destruction that caught the Children of the Forest off guard.

The white walkers were created to have animus against men, but why did the walkers turn on the children of the Forest?  

It seems the white walkers retained a small bit of humanity including the desire to reproduce towards preservation of their new species.  The children of the Forest intentionally made that impossible.

How could the first men and children of the Forest possibly fight and drive the white walkers and legions of wights to the far north?

The Children of the Forest worked a new magic.  They decided to fight legions of zombie-like animated corpses with their own undead army of men.  So, while dragon glass into the heart of a live man turns him into a white walker, dragon glass into the heart of a dead man raises him to be the undead.

This is revealed in the story of Benjen Stark.  He was discovered dead by the Children of the Forest, who stopped him from falling to the control of the White Walkers by shoving a piece of dragonglass into his chest making him one of the undead. 

These undead retain their wits and skills and are far more valuable than a wight.  They retain a great deal of their humanity but they are pale and cold.  

The undead quickly decimated the wight army and the children of the Forest appealed to the white walkers to parley.  The walkers had something they wanted that might allow for a cold peace to be established.  They wanted their species not to be a dead end.

Why are the white walkers called walkers?  

Most time we see them on horses as often as walking. By design, the walkers had an unyielding animus towards men.  A peace with them could only exist if they were separated from men.

After destroying the wight legions, the undead escorted the white walkers north, through hill and dale.  And it was a sight to see.  Did you see the white monsters walk through the town?  They will live in the north behind a Great Ice Wall! was the gossip of the age.

Then Bran the Builder, founder of House Stark, and probably the first of the Builders of the Night Watch, built the Ice Wall to keep them separated.

Now remember, this whole war began because, in some way, the first men did not reciprocate the civility and the initial peaceful tolerance of their migration into the land of the Children of the Forest or the Ice giants.  They were destructive of the weirwood.  This was sort of a violation of guest right.  

So, it is not surprising that the burden to meet the white walkers need for progeny fell on the first men.  We see the White Walk King turn one of Crasners male babies into a white walker with a touch to the cheek.  The children of the Forest did magic that allowed the white walker king, a Stark, to turn a his male, blood kin children into White Walkers.  The tribute was to be paid by whomever ruled the land.  It is unknown how many male babies per century are due the White Walkers. 

It was a pact that was kept secret due to the repugnance of giving human babies over to be turned into something cold and alien that almost killed all the first men.

The wall went up, a private magic door was made to be able to give the tribute of children through the wall in secret, to the walkers.

That worked until the 13th Lord Commander, the Nights King saw a beautiful undead woman on the other side of the wall and brought her into the Keep.

I suspect the great undead warriors were mostly left on the far side of the wall.  Humans NEVER treat war veterans with the respect they deserve.  But they, too, were creepy and alien.  So the undead that won the war for the first men were left north of the wall along with the white walkers and the wildings.

The explanation integrates ideas that peace between houses is firmly established by marriage between houses, the dangers and deaths in pregnancy, the established lore of how white walkers are created and the lore of both Azor Ahai and The Prince Who was Promised.

The toughest piece of the Azor Ahai story is that he drove his sword into the living heart of his wife Nissa Nissa, who appeared a willing victim, to transform it into Lightbringer.  

The legend states that Azor Ahai will strike his enemy with Lightbringer and destroy him as he bursts into flame.  At present, when white walkers are struck with either dragon glass or valerian steel, they shatter into fragments of ice and water.

How could a husband do this?  How could a wife allow it?

I have an explanation that makes sense of this very weird, strange story.

Jon Stark is Azor Ahai.  Dany is both Nissa Nissa AND The Prince Who Was Promised.

Dany is pregnant by Jon.  Let us assume there is some simple ceremony before the Great War truly begins.

We have seemed to assume that the great sword Lightbringer must me like the other great swords, made of Valerian steel.  As this story comes from the east, it is sort of natural they assume the sword was tempered as steel is tempered.

But what if the great sword Lightbringer is of Dragon Glass, made by the Children of the Forest and gifted or found by Jon Snow.

Dany leads in battle and is mortally wounded as the dragon she rides is brought down.  Two dead dragons.  She is brought to Jon.  They talk as she is dying.  She does not want to be reanimated and become his corpse bride.  She is morning that the children she carries will die with her.  

Knowing the tale of Azor Ahai, Dany pleads to Jon to plunge the newly found Dragon Glass Sword Lightbringer into her heart while she still lives.

He does.

As promised, it transforms Lightbringer into the promised Red Flaming Sword of lore.

It also transforms the pregnant Dany into the Night Queen, The Princess who was promised.  Satisfying the pact between the White Walkers and the First Men at the dawn of time.

Jon now has the only weapon that is capable of destroying the White Walker King.

The White Walker King battles Jon one-on-one.  John destroys him in a burst of flame. 

There is silence as both sides witness this extraordinary battle and result.

A newly transformed Dany emerges to join Jons side.  She is newly strange, and beautiful and visibly pregnant. Her eyes meet Jons, holding deep affection, and she touches her belly.

She screeches at the White Walkers.  They kneel and screech back in unison.  She screeches to the sky.  Her three dead dragons, fly above her.  She mounts the dead Drogon and flies north, the two other dragons follow.  The White Walkers.

Jon is the clear heir of the Throne of Swords.  Half Stark, Half Targaryen.  Westeros has a peace by blood and by marriage between Westeros and The Walkers.

The transformed Dany gives birth to twins.  They are new and strange but slightly different than the White Walkers.  They are brought before the White Walkers and raised to be presented to strange screeches of acclamation.

The son is named a screech that translates to Stallion.  The daughter is named a screech that translates to Mother. Twenty years later, all the Northmen gather at the ruins of the great ice wall.  The Walkers mass on the closest hill.

We watch Stallion marry Mother - a traditional brother sister Targaryen marriage.  

Both sides cheer and screech together with the greatest wishes of congratulations.  The couple fly off on one of the dragons.  It is clear the dark pact of child tribute from men to walkers is broken.  Stallion and Mother are the Adam and Eve of the Walkers and will give birth to the next generation.  The terms of the pact are no longer needed and a stable peace requiring no Walk is established between the kingdom of humans and walkers.

It is a satisfying bittersweet ending.  Jon and Dany, husband and wife, live and rule different worlds now.  Irreversibly alien to one another.  But there is peace and each reigns a kingdom, which was their destiny.

I don't like the fact that Jon is a Targaryen. I don't like that he is now the Rightful Heir to the Seven Kingdoms.

Mind you, I've nothing against Jon. In fact, I'm all for him. But I think that Daenerys should get the Iron Throne. The amount of dedication and effort she has been putting to win that throne cannot be ignored, simply because someone with a 'stronger claim' and a bit more royal blood came along. 

Dany is a natural leader. She has true regal bearing, a just mind and is capable of making tough decision to achieve her goals. She conquered Astapor, Yunkai, Meereen, won the loyalty of an Unsullied army. She demolished slavery in *Slaver's Bay -* a place that acquired its name for its infamous slave trade. She values duty over love - she left Daario behind in season 6 because she knew that he would compromise her ability to make diplomatic relations with Westerosi nobles through marriage. She is committed and does not falter while delivering justice, and she is *literally fireproof.* What more could you want?

I'm certain that Jon would make a great ruler too, but I want him to rule the north, not the Seven Kingdoms. Even though his father is a Targaryen, he is a man of ice, not fire. And he is a Stark through and through. Even if Ned's blood does not run through his veins, Jon was raised by him, which makes me see him as Ned's son rather than Rhaegar's. 

Perhaps I should reiterate what I said in the beginning. I cannot change the fact that Jon is a Targaryen by blood, but I would like to see him as a Stark by heart. I would have liked to see Ned Stark's bastard become Warden/King of the North and prove that blood need not be the only mark of legitimacy for a ruler, but even as a Targaryen, I would like to see him remember the North, choose it over the Iron Throne, because the North remembered him. Even as a bastard, it remembered him.

But the concept I loathe the most (I'm going to get downvoted into oblivion for saying this) is Jonaerys ruling Westeros together. I don't like the JonxDaenerys pairing one tiny bit. Not because of their blood relation, but because it feels extremely stilted and is a No. 1 cliche. Game of Thrones has been, for the most part, destroying cliches. To pair up the male lead and female lead is very disappointing and anticlimactic for me. ",62,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

[Spoilers],https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/anst8d/game_of_thrones_who_would_you_play_spoilers/,TheFriendlyGrimm,1549472556,"As a bit of fun before the start of Season Eight, I thought we could play the Game of Thrones:

How to play: 1. Choose a player 2. Choose a time 3. say what you would have done in their shoes. 

The rules are that a. you have to share their motivations, b. you can only know as much as it can be reasonably supposed they know and c. you have to stay as much in character as possible.

So, as an example:

Player: Littlefinger/ Petyr Baelish (dont hate me- he's just the most fun)

Time: Season one, just after the capture of Ned Start.

As Petyr I have two main motivating factors: my desire for Cat Stark and my desire for power.

Im in the Red Keep, Kings Landing. Im the Master of Coin and own several brothels in the city. 

Other Players:

Kings Landing: Ned Stark (in the dungeons), Joffrey (on the Iron Throne, aided and abetted by Cersei), Sansa  (under house arrest). I dont know where Arya is. 

Eyrie: Cat Stark, Lysa Arran, Tyrion.

Cannon: Little finger hangs around Kings Landing until Joffrey is poisoned, at which point he leaves for the Vale of Arran with Sansa. By that point, Cat has already joined forces with Robb and made her two fatal mistakes regarding the release of Jaime Lannister and her alliance with house Frey, which leads to her death.

What would I do instead: Littlefinger has interests in Kings Landing but we know that he ultimately abandons the money he as tied up in his brothels and other interests when he absconds with Sansa.

Step 1: Write to Cat Stark with news that I must tell her in person concerning Tyrion Lannister. Do not do anything until she hears from me.  Request a small ornament/hair clip of hers, for Sansa who is suffering and misses her mother (If Cersei/Joffery discover this, I will tell them that I am safeguarding Tyrion to protect the Lannister reputation).

Step 2: Speak with Joffery (separately): sending Ned Stark to the Nights Watch would be idiotic as, to get to the Wall, Ned would be passing through his own territory, the North, and his son, household guard and banner-men would rescue him as soon as he sets foot (if not earlier- the Tullys of the Riverlands would also raise the banners for their in-law). Ned would not keep to his vow once freed as a vow made under threat of death, to someone he has already committed treason against would not be kept for a second, even by a man who considers himself honourable. 

If Joffery raises the fact that he holds Sansa (and, for all Ned knows, Arya) Id play to his own selfishness/psychopathy: would he give up his freedom for a couple of girls? 

Furthermore, the Nights Watch, in itself, is the last place Id send a Stark because a. there is a long tradition of Starks commanding the Nights Watch, b. Mormont is old and will die soon and c. Neds younger brother, Benjen, is head of the Rangers and would help his older brother gain control. Under Stark, the Nights Watch would pose a threat to Joffrey.

If Joffery raises the Nights Watch tradition of independence and neutrality (unlikely, as he is not very bright) I would play to his own corruption; who is really neutral, who keeps their vows? The Nights Watch is a Stark ruse to provide them with an extra army against the wildlings but, if Ned is in control, why wouldnt he turn that army south? 

Summary: by all means tell Ned Stark that youll spare him- and his daughters- if he confesses to treason and recants his slanders against you but- between us- have Illyn Pain on hand to take off his head. Ned Stark cannot be allowed within 100 miles of the North. Dont tell your mother; women are weak and stupid and have soft hearts- this needs a Kings resolve, not a mothers mercy.

Step 3: Speak to Cersei: we had to keep Ned Stark alive, as he is a very useful hostage- his son is certainly going to rebel if Ned dies, whereas if Ned is under the axe Robb Stark will submit and bend the Knee. We cant risk the North and the Riverlands marching on Kings Landing, possibly accompanied by the Baratheon brothers; even when Kings Landing was guarded by dragons, it was invaded several times.

However, keeping a Stark in the dungeons is one thing, keeping three Starks, on the other hand, is an invitation for a rescue attempt. Besides, despite our claim that we have both of the girls, we actually only have Sansa and people will soon notice if Arya does not accompany her sister. So, the safest thing for Cersei to do would be to send Sansa somewhere secret, where she can be kept under lock and key. 

Joffery may, of course, be disappointed but, between us, isnt it better for the children to be parted? Joffrey needs to make alliances, in case the Starks do decide to make a fight of it, and Renly and Stannis are already raising their banners. An alliance with, say, the Tyrells or Dorne could come in very useful and, moreover, it would mean that Joffrey would not be marrying a traitors daughter because, really, what can an alliance with the Starks bring but more trouble?

So, Sansa should be sent away; Littlefinger has already shown his loyalty- didnt he just present Cersei with Ned Stark on a plate? Let Littlefinger take Sansa to an undisclosed location; Cersei can announce that the girls have been removed from the Red Keep once shes gone and, really, a hostage in an undisclosed location is just as effective- if not more so- as a hostage beside you. P.S. Cersei does, indeed, have the loyal Goldcloaks and the Kingsguard but, then again, so did the Kings and Queens who were forced out of kings Landing- and they had DRAGONS!

Not a word to Joffery; he is young and innocent and brave and would not see the danger in keeping his sweetheart close or the necessity of alliances- let more experienced and wiser heads prevail. 

Step 4: Send my spies around the gates to Kings Landing, keeping a lookout for Arya. If someone sees her, follow her until Cats ornament could be shown to her and a rescue arranged.

Step 5: LEAVE WITH Sansa, loading her onto a boat and arriving at a secret location (Littlefinger would have hide-outs). I would wait until I was sure that Cat had received the news of Neds beheading (doubly likely, now Joffery- the nasty little brute- had another reason to want to hurt Sansa- who had left him) and the news of Sansa and Arya being held hostage.

Once the news of Neds death/Sansas disappearance had hit, Id get on a ship to the Vale for Stage 2.

Stage 2

Step 1: I now have Sansa (and hopefully Arya) in front of Cat, who will be overcome with gratitude. I would then announce that Tyrion was not Brans murderer; he had been set up by Cersei. Id state that Cersei had arranged Brans murder because he had witnessed her incestuous affair with her brother, Jaime. 

Cersei had decided to frame Tyrion, in the hopes of spreading discord between her family and the Starks, as she wanted Ned to be sent back to the North in disgrace before he could discover her secret and told Robert. I would openly admit that I had been told, under pain of death, to tell Ned and Cat that the dagger was mine and had been won from me by Tyrion; I did not see- blind that I am- how Cersei would use this, I thought she was just trying to hide her monstrous crime by pinning it on Tyrion and I always intended to let the truth be known once I had Sansa and Ned safe. But events overtook me; I did not consider that Cersei would murder her husband, what thought had I that Cat and Tyrion would meet on the road? How could I have possibly have guessed that Ned would not continue to be the Hand, and thereby protected by King Robert and his Office?

However, now I am here, with Sansa- I could not save Ned, though I did explain the benefits of the Nights Watch to Cersei and Joffery and it was promised that Ned would be spared and sent to the Wall. 

I had hoped that Ned would consider that a vow made under duress to a usurper  was not a real vow and that he would return to the North to be rescued and return to Kings Landing with an Army as I had taken Sansa (and Arya- if I have her) to safety, so they could not be used.

This is a risk, Tyrion is very clever and I have admitted to being Cerseis catspaw against him. However, hopefully Cat will blurt out Oh, thats why you told me to spare him and Tyrions own hatred of Cersei would encourage him to think the worst of her.

Step 2: Once Lysa and I are alone, I will tell her my real plan: to use the Starks to wipe out the Lannisters- who are our greatest threat- and then get Stannis Baratheon on the throne; his daughter will marry Sweetrobin, putting him in line to the throne, and I will marry Lysa. If Lysa complains that Shireen is ugly, Id ask what woman could possibly compete with Robins beautiful mother in his eyes? Cue maternal jealousy- of course a plain, stupid wife is much to be preferred to a charming, pretty one (banking on the fact that Lysa doesnt want to come second to a prettier woman again!)

Step 3. Id tell Cat we neded to go back to Winterfell, to get Sansa to safety. Id ask Tyrion to accompany us- Cersei wants him dead and hes a clever and able man and Id value his advice.

At this point, I expect that the Stark storyline would play out very similarly, with some key features being different, notably:

1. Sansa, Cat and Tyrion would remain at Winterfell. Winterfell, however, would be well guarded: Littlefinger would not trust Theon at all- the boy is a Greyjoy and knows too much about the North for comfort.

Littlefinger would then head south for Robb. The alliance with the Freys would probably occur but, Id marry Robb to his Frey wife there and then; you cant trust a young man like Robb Stark to keep it in his pants and the boy is so honourable hed marry any wench he got preggers. Safer by far to have him married and thinking about the honour owed to his wife- then, at worst, hell just come back with a bastard in toe rather than an inconvenient marriage.

Id send Robbs new wife to Winterfell with a strong guard of Northmen and possibly also poison Walder Frey (the mans sons are younger, dumber and less malicious).

So, Id have Cat safe (and eternally grateful, ready to be my wife once she's had a chance to mourn), a hostage to keep Walder Frey (or sons) to their side of the bargain (theyd care about the potential heir, not the wife!) and an army of Northmen, Riverlanders and some knights of the Vale. Id offer Stannis terms but, of course, hed reject them. Itd be up to me then to decide whether or not to convince Robb to fight for the elder Baratheon but, really, with the Riverlands and the North as a kingdom (and nothing left for us in Kings Landing), I might suggest to Robb that we let the Baratheons wipe out the Lannisters for us and then forge a truce.

It is something I am writing because I felt it would be nice to share, maybe get some feedback. 

&amp;#x200B;

I first discovered Game of Thrones in 2011, when I caught a couple of colleagues exchanging unmarked CDs at work. Something about the way they exchanged the unmarked CDs and the genuine look of glee on the face of the receiver made me butt in.  Naturally, I assumed it was something NSFW, but when I confronted them they told me it was a new TV show that I wouldn't like as it had ""magic"" and ""zombies"" and other stuff they know I'm not into. I still wanted a copy, and they burned me a copy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I finished the first season in two nights. Wanting more, I read the 5 ASOIAF books in a span of 5 months. This kindled a love for Fantasy that I didn't know I had, and after learning that ASOIAF was going to need a few more years to proceed, I switch to LOTR, KingKiller, Fitz &amp; the Fool, and most recently, Cosmere. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's been 8 years since I first discovered the genre, thanks to Game of Thrones. My relationship with the Tv show isn't what it used to be. I am not all that excited about the final season, or to be more accurate, I'm not as excited as I know I would have been had I not discovered my love for reading.  I will always be grateful to Game of Thrones for leading me to this genre of literature. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sadly, I feel like I've reached a point where I don't care if GRRM writes the final novels. I'm not angry or upset at him, I just feel I've moved on. I will always be grateful to the show for introducing me to the books which in turn opened up a whole new world.

We start with the very first episode, ""Winter is Coming.:

* Game of Thrones wiki summary: [https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Winter\_Is\_Coming](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Winter_Is_Coming)
* Biggest moment: It's easy to pick the final moment, as Jaime pushes Bran out of the window, but I'm going to argue it was the discovery of the Direwolf puppies. I'd argue the Lannisters vs. Starks was going to happen no matter what once Ned agreed to become Hand of the King. But the Direwolves became such a big part of so many moments throughout the season. I can only hope we'll get more of them in the final season.
* Episode MVP: Jaime Lannister (the things he'll do for love...)
* Final thought: The episode was good, but not great. That's not unusual for a pilot... especially one that was recast and reshot. Notice Tyrion's blonde hair... which doesn't last long. But it gave us enough of this rich world to hook us... and had some great scenes with Sean Bean and Peter Dinklage, in particular.",20,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

How to play: 1. Choose a player 2. Choose a time 3. say what you would have done in their shoes.

The rules are that a. you have to share their motivations, b. you can only know as much as it can be reasonably supposed they know and c. you have to stay as much in character as possible.

So, as an example:

Player: Littlefinger/ Petyr Baelish (dont hate me- he's just the most fun)

Time: Season one, just after the capture of Ned Start.

As Petyr I have two main motivating factors: my desire for Cat Stark and my desire for power.

Im in the Red Keep, Kings Landing. Im the Master of Coin and own several brothels in the city.

Other Players:

Kings Landing: Ned Stark (in the dungeons), Joffrey (on the Iron Throne, aided and abetted by Cersei), Sansa (under house arrest). I dont know where Arya is.

Eyrie: Cat Stark, Lysa Arran, Tyrion.

Cannon: Little finger hangs around Kings Landing until Joffrey is poisoned, at which point he leaves for the Vale of Arran with Sansa. By that point, Cat has already joined forces with Robb and made her two fatal mistakes regarding the release of Jaime Lannister and her alliance with house Frey, which leads to her death.

What would I do instead: Littlefinger has interests in Kings Landing but we know that he ultimately abandons the money he as tied up in his brothels and other interests when he absconds with Sansa.

Step 1: Write to Cat Stark with news that I must tell her in person concerning Tyrion Lannister. Do not do anything until she hears from me. Request a small ornament/hair clip of hers, for Sansa who is suffering and misses her mother (If Cersei/Joffery discover this, I will tell them that I am safeguarding Tyrion to protect the Lannister reputation).

Step 2: Speak with Joffery (separately): sending Ned Stark to the Nights Watch would be idiotic as, to get to the Wall, Ned would be passing through his own territory, the North, and his son, household guard and banner-men would rescue him as soon as he sets foot (if not earlier- the Tullys of the Riverlands would also raise the banners for their in-law). Ned would not keep to his vow once freed as a vow made under threat of death, to someone he has already committed treason against would not be kept for a second, even by a man who considers himself honourable.

If Joffery raises the fact that he holds Sansa (and, for all Ned knows, Arya) Id play to his own selfishness/psychopathy: would he give up his freedom for a couple of girls?

Furthermore, the Nights Watch, in itself, is the last place Id send a Stark because a. there is a long tradition of Starks commanding the Nights Watch, b. Mormont is old and will die soon and c. Neds younger brother, Benjen, is head of the Rangers and would help his older brother gain control. Under Stark, the Nights Watch would pose a threat to Joffrey.

If Joffery raises the Nights Watch tradition of independence and neutrality (unlikely, as he is not very bright) I would play to his own corruption; who is really neutral, who keeps their vows? The Nights Watch is a Stark ruse to provide them with an extra army against the wildlings but, if Ned is in control, why wouldnt he turn that army south?

Summary: by all means tell Ned Stark that youll spare him- and his daughters- if he confesses to treason and recants his slanders against you but- between us- have Illyn Pain on hand to take off his head. Ned Stark cannot be allowed within 100 miles of the North. Dont tell your mother; women are weak and stupid and have soft hearts- this needs a Kings resolve, not a mothers mercy.

Step 3: Speak to Cersei: we had to keep Ned Stark alive, as he is a very useful hostage- his son is certainly going to rebel if Ned dies, whereas if Ned is under the axe Robb Stark will submit and bend the Knee. We cant risk the North and the Riverlands marching on Kings Landing, possibly accompanied by the Baratheon brothers; even when Kings Landing was guarded by dragons, it was invaded several times.

However, keeping a Stark in the dungeons is one thing, keeping three Starks, on the other hand, is an invitation for a rescue attempt. Besides, despite our claim that we have both of the girls, we actually only have Sansa and people will soon notice if Arya does not accompany her sister. So, the safest thing for Cersei to do would be to send Sansa somewhere secret, where she can be kept under lock and key.

Joffery may, of course, be disappointed but, between us, isnt it better for the children to be parted? Joffrey needs to make alliances, in case the Starks do decide to make a fight of it, and Renly and Stannis are already raising their banners. An alliance with, say, the Tyrells or Dorne could come in very useful and, moreover, it would mean that Joffrey would not be marrying a traitors daughter because, really, what can an alliance with the Starks bring but more trouble?

So, Sansa should be sent away; Littlefinger has already shown his loyalty- didnt he just present Cersei with Ned Stark on a plate? Let Littlefinger take Sansa to an undisclosed location; Cersei can announce that the girls have been removed from the Red Keep once shes gone and, really, a hostage in an undisclosed location is just as effective- if not more so- as a hostage beside you. P.S. Cersei does, indeed, have the loyal Goldcloaks and the Kingsguard but, then again, so did the Kings and Queens who were forced out of kings Landing- and they had Dragons!

Not a word to Joffery; he is young and innocent and brave and would not see the danger in keeping his sweetheart close or the necessity of alliances- let more experienced and wiser heads prevail.

Step 4: Send my spies around the gates to Kings Landing, keeping a lookout for Arya. If someone sees her, follow her until Cats ornament could be shown to her and a rescue arranged.

Step 5: LEAVE WITH Sansa, loading her onto a boat and arriving at a secret location (Littlefinger would have hide-outs). I would wait until I was sure that Cat had received the news of Neds beheading (doubly likely, now Joffery- the nasty little brute- had another reason to want to hurt Sansa- who had left him) and the news of Sansa and Arya being held hostage.

Once the news of Neds death/Sansas disappearance had hit, Id get on a ship to the Vale for Stage 2.

Stage 2

Step 1: I now have Sansa (and hopefully Arya) in front of Cat, who will be overcome with gratitude. I would then announce that Tyrion was not Brans murderer; he had been set up by Cersei. Id state that Cersei had arranged Brans murder because he had witnessed her incestuous affair with her brother, Jaime.

Cersei had decided to frame Tyrion, in the hopes of spreading discord between her family and the Starks, as she wanted Ned to be sent back to the North in disgrace before he could discover her secret and told Robert. I would openly admit that I had been told, under pain of death, to tell Ned and Cat that the dagger was mine and had been won from me by Tyrion; I did not see- blind that I am- how Cersei would use this, I thought she was just trying to hide her monstrous crime by pinning it on Tyrion and I always intended to let the truth be known once I had Sansa and Ned safe. But events overtook me; I did not consider that Cersei would murder her husband, what thought had I that Cat and Tyrion would meet on the road? How could I have possibly have guessed that Ned would not continue to be the Hand, and thereby protected by King Robert and his Office?

However, now I am here, with Sansa- I could not save Ned, though I did explain the benefits of the Nights Watch to Cersei and Joffery and it was promised that Ned would be spared and sent to the Wall.

I had hoped that Ned would consider that a vow made under duress to a usurper was not a real vow and that he would return to the North to be rescued and return to Kings Landing with an Army as I had taken Sansa (and Arya- if I have her) to safety, so they could not be used.

This is a risk, Tyrion is very clever and I have admitted to being Cerseis catspaw against him. However, hopefully Cat will blurt out Oh, thats why you told me to spare him and Tyrions own hatred of Cersei would encourage him to think the worst of her.

Step 2: Once Lysa and I are alone, I will tell her my real plan: to use the Starks to wipe out the Lannisters- who are our greatest threat- and then get Stannis Baratheon on the throne; his daughter will marry Sweetrobin, putting him in line to the throne, and I will marry Lysa. If Lysa complains that Shireen is ugly, Id ask what woman could possibly compete with Robins beautiful mother in his eyes? Cue maternal jealousy- of course a plain, stupid wife is much to be preferred to a charming, pretty one (banking on the fact that Lysa doesnt want to come second to a prettier woman again!)

Step 3. Id tell Cat we neded to go back to Winterfell, to get Sansa to safety. Id ask Tyrion to accompany us- Cersei wants him dead and hes a clever and able man and Id value his advice.

At this point, I expect that the Stark storyline would play out very similarly, with some key features being different, notably:

1. Sansa, Cat and Tyrion would remain at Winterfell. Winterfell, however, would be well guarded: Littlefinger would not trust Theon at all- the boy is a Greyjoy and knows too much about the North for comfort.

Littlefinger would then head south for Robb. The alliance with the Freys would probably occur but, Id marry Robb to his Frey wife there and then; you cant trust a young man like Robb Stark to keep it in his pants and the boy is so honourable hed marry any wench he got preggers. Safer by far to have him married and thinking about the honour owed to his wife- then, at worst, hell just come back with a bastard in toe rather than an inconvenient marriage.

Id send Robbs new wife to Winterfell with a strong guard of Northmen and possibly also poison Walder Frey (the mans sons are younger, dumber and less malicious).

So, Id have Cat safe (and eternally grateful, ready to be my wife once she's had a chance to mourn), a hostage to keep Walder Frey (or sons) to their side of the bargain (theyd care about the potential heir, not the wife!) and an army of Northmen, Riverlanders and some knights of the Vale. Id offer Stannis terms but, of course, hed reject them. Itd be up to me then to decide whether or not to convince Robb to fight for the elder Baratheon but, really, with the Riverlands and the North as a kingdom (and nothing left for us in Kings Landing), I might suggest to Robb that we let the Baratheons wipe out the Lannisters for us and then forge a truce (If Renly wins, offer Sansa in marriage, if Stannis wins, turn Robb into a widower and offer Stannis a deal- Robb marries Shireen and is named as Stannis heir.)",6,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

1. Night King shall receive a regular tribute of male infants with whom he shares the Stark blood, who will be be transformed by King into Walkers to maintain the Walkers so they do not go extinct.  
2. With each periodic return of the blood star, an additional tribute of a man in his prime, a direct descendant of the human ruling Kings line will be provided (The Prince Who Was Promised) to become the new Night King, replacing the aging King and assuming his powers.
3. In exchange, the White walkers will reside peacefully in the north without harassment from men.

The repugnance of the terms requiring human child tribute required the first men who made the pact to keep it secret from the people of Westeros.  

The letter the first Aegon received from Dorne was apprising him of his new responsibility to provide the Prince Who Was Promised,  as the Starks were no longer Kings of the North but merely lords under King Aegon.

The Mad King went mad because, his wife kept having miscarriages and Rhygars wife was unable to produce a suitable Prince.  Rhygars first wife was from Dorne, the only other independent state with its own Royalty, as Aegon failed to conquer them.  She was understanding about Rhygar and Lyanna because he was best able to provide The Prince Who Was Promised.

Ned died before telling Jon his parentage AND fate.  Consequently, the periodic red star came and went, and The Prince Who Was Promised was not delivered.

The first rune the Walkers left with body parts of wildings looks a great deal like a comment with a tail down the middle.  Trying to remind  the Northerners that the comment had come.

The second rune of a set of spirals of horse heads, was another reminder, the Pact was probably made by the main Weirwood tree that had a spiral of stones emerging from it.

Question:  so why didnt the Night King just capture Jon, as he probably knew it was him?  

Because The Prince Who Is Promised cannot be turned to a walker by the Old Night King, The Old Night King cant touch dragon glass.  The Prince Who Is Promised must be delivered already turned into a walker.  And maybe it was another of Targaryen blood who was selected.  That is why the Walkers did not slander some, like Samwell, outside the wall.

Is suspect the new night prince must slaughter the old king then assume his role.

And that makes sense. But what if it stands for something else. What if it stands for House Unity? Here's what I mean.

We know Daenerys is a Targaryen through and through. We now know that Jon Snow's mom was a Stark and his dad a Targaryen. But who could the third one be? Many have speculated that it's Tyrion. I think so as well. I was re-watching the Mhysa episode. The part when Tyrion asks his father when the last time was he didn't do something in his best interest. But rather something that was solely good for the family. Tywin responds by telling Tyrion he ""Let him live."" He goes on to say he wanted to take him out to the sea and let the waves wash Tyrion away. Instead he let him live. Then Tywin says a very odd sentence. ""I brought you us AS MY SON."" Isn't he supposed to BE his son? Then after a lengthy pause he says, ""Because you're a Lannister."" Well- it's not only Tywin that would make Tyrion a Lannister. Joanna, Tyrion's mom, was Tywin's first cousin. So if a Targaryen got Joanna pregnant, someone like the Mad King during Tywin's reign as the Hand of the King, it wouldn't change the fact that Tyrion would still be a Lannister. This would make him half Lannister and half Targaryen. So maybe the three headed dragon isn't about three Targaryens. Instead, it represents the merging of three powerful Houses. Coming together to fight a common enemy. Each one with the blood of Targaryen in them.

When he, Shae and Tyrion are in Tyrion's tent before one of the battles with Robb Stark's forces, Tyrion gets them to play a drinking question game. He would ask them questions and if the answer was yes, they had to drink. Tyrion asks Bronn if he's been north of the wallBronn kinda smirks and takes drink without saying anything.

You can now show your allegiance with a house flair next to your name  and while previously we only listed \~100, we now have all the ones we had before.

***CAN WE REQUEST A FLAIR?***

Yes, for now. On-season it might depend on whether the mods have time. We'd just ask that it follows a few specifications.

You can request any sigil we've already added plus:

* any character in that house from the ASOIAF universe (E.g. House Stark sigil + Brandon Stark)
* any house words (E.g. Sansa Stark sigil + Winter Is Coming)
* any character's nickname (E.g. Sand snakes sigil + Lady Nym)
* any unofficial house words (E.g. Lannister sigil + ""A Lannister Always Pays His Debts"")

To request a flair, tell us in this post, or message the mods.

\--------

***HOW DO WE CHOOSE A FLAIR?***

It depends which version of Reddit you are using.

**If you're on old Reddit**, first click ""edit"" next to your username on the sidebar, under the number of subscribers to the sub. [Here's a pic of where I mean](https://i.imgur.com/6tGZr70.png). A list of flairs will pop up, but the text isn't displaying just now. You can use control+f to find the one you want, though, or just hover over them - [here's an example](https://i.imgur.com/cCzVx1S.png). 

**If you're using the redesign,** on the top panel of the sidebar, just under ""Create Post"", you'll see ""Edit user flair"". Click that. [Here's a pic](https://i.imgur.com/ilcZVs1.png). If you can't see this anywhere, you may need to click ""Community Info"" to expand the sidebar, and this option will appear.

**If you're using the official mobile app,** click the three dots at the top right, and then ""Edit user flair"". [Here's a pic](https://i.imgur.com/bang12T.png) 

\--------

***HOW ARE THE FLAIRS ORDERED?***

The top 100 or so are ranked in order of popularity, and grouped by house, to an extent. E.g. All the Tyrell groups are together with the most popular Tyrell flair. After that, it's alphabetical, and then the ones most recently added.

PS. If you're on redesign and it says something about flairs not being available on this subreddit, try again later. Not sure what's causing that glitch, but that has worked for people.",26,1,False,self,,,,,

From cersei's perspective, her child is already the heir to the iron throne because she's the queen. so why would she agree with such a deal?, accepting such a deal is admiting that Daenerys can win and this is not how cersei works, ant that also means that Daenerys will have to wait at least until the child is born before she even thinks about taking the iron throne.

for me, it can be one of these two things (or both)

1- the so-called deal between Cersei and Tyrion is not really a long-term deal. my first guess is that tyrion simply offered to cersei to lie about helping daenerys and jon so that dany leaves the south and doesn't sack the city right away. in other words tyrion still wants daenerys to take the iron throne, but to protect his unborn nephew he helped cersei win some extra time, and the deal ends here.

2- maybe Tyrion told cersei to send her forces to attack winterfell and capture valuable hostage: the reason why I think this, is that cersei said that she will send  her armies to help, while daenerys only asked her to pull them back to the capital and stand down. Now even if cersei's armies are spotted marching north everyone will think they're coming to help (cersei didn't know that jaime would leave her by the time she pledged to help). so cersei sends her forces to winterfell, they capture sansa, jon or even daenerys and they go back to king's landing. 

ps: when cersei promised to help and said ***""with no promises or insurance from any of you"" ,*** she looked at Jon in the exact moment that she said ""insurances"". that may not mean anything and I may be over-interpreting it, but it may also mean that Jon is going to be ""the insurance"".

in this case, if jon is captured, tyrion will have touched two birds with only one stone, on one side he can make sure that his nephew is safe, on the other he will have daenerys ""freed"" from a dangerous distraction that (in his mind) is turning her away from the real reason why she's in westeros.

of course I could be wrong about some details of this or about everything, so I'd like to know what you all think about it",24,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

When  she killed Polliver, the facelessman theme music played because the  death was justified and the victim got what he deserved. It was a proper  faceless man kill.

But  when she kills the guy going for the bounty on the hound, he had not really done anything to her justifying murder, he lowered his sword, was  not threatening... just kinda dumb. That kill was murder, no music at all.

This means it should have consistently become colder his entire life.

**When Varys genitals burned in the blue flame, he heard a voice from the other side speaking in a language he did not understand.  But he remembered the words** and, I suspect, he now speaks the language and understands what was said.  

I believe that Varys is a Targaryen bastard born of a whore in his home on Lys.  It was said they had the best and the Mad King loved the ladies, right?  **He was sold to mummers. He was bought by the sorcerer for a high price** because the sorcerer needed Blood of the Kings line to summon the great other, recognized Varys has Targaryen blood.   My guess is that the sorcerer wanted to learn exactly who was THE PRINCE WHO WAS PROMISED or maybe the reborn Azor Ahai. 

I believe the voice responded,  a Targaryen bastard of the King.  Held by Mummers and neutered.

Holy Moly!  Varys thinks HES the Prince who was promised!

It was funny how **he challenged Kinnaris about the accuracy of her belief that Dany was the Prince Who Was Promised because, hey, Melisandre thought it was Stannis, but hes dead and out of the running.  Kinnaris said, sometimes the interpretation of the signs is wrong.**

**This is where she freaks him out offering to tell him who his voice was and what it said.  Varys, master spy was silent and shaken.**

**Kinnaris then says, dont worry, as long as you are loyal to our queen (Dany) , you have nothing to fear from me.**

Kinnaris KNEW Varys thought he was the Prince Who Was Promised!  But as long as Varys honored his pledge of loyalty to Dany, she doesnt care if Old crazy Varys thinks hes a frying pan or a horse shoe.

Varys found and kept the sorcerer who neutered him alive as witness to the prophecy.

But Varys is WRONG and the prophecy is still true!

Aerys II took Kings first privilege with Joanna Lannister.  Cersei and Jamie are bastard Targaryen Prince and Princess.

And how do you neuter a swordsman?  You cut off his sword hand!  **In the books, the character who did it at Boltons command was even said to be a mummer!**

BAM!

The prophecy Varys heard and thought was about himself is actually about Jamie Lannister!

I feel like there was more story to tell with this guy. He was a skilled warrior and had similar qualities to Ramsay (charismatic yet sadistic). 

  
Can you imagine if Locke had survived the encounter with Hodor, and was discarded by Roose for failing him?

If he stayed at the wall, I could see him being one of the traitors that kill Jon. Or he becomes one of Jon's closest allies and marches to Winterfell with him to get revenge on the Boltons.   


I know the show is packed enough, but I really like the character and was so let down by his death.

Today, it's the second episode, ""The Kingsroad"":

* Game of Thrones wiki summary: [https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/The\_Kingsroad](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/The_Kingsroad)
* Biggest moment: It's the conflict by the river where Arya embarrasses Joffrey. The fallout from this has spanned seasons. It drove a wedge even deeper between Arya and Sansa. It was the spark for Arya's deep hatred for Joffrey and The Hound (who killed her friend). And we lost our first Direwolf.
* Episode MVP: Jon Snow for providing Needle to Arya. He had no idea where that would lead.
* Final thought: It was a bit of a slower episode as we learned more about some side characters (like Jorah Mormont) and see the development of some important relationships (Dany and Drago, Joffrey and Sansa, Catelyn and Jon).",4,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Isn't having an Ice Dragon counterproductive to the White Walker's cause?

The White Walkers can only raise the dead, so their army kills the living. Makes sense so far. A dragon's main method of killing is with it's fire breath. White Walkers cannot raise ash to fight in their army, so the dragon would have to fight using physical methods.

The White Walkers' main objective is to kill the living. To do this, they need an army. If they just burnt their opposition, there would be no one to raise, while their opposition destroys the dead. Eventually, the White Walkers are not going to have an army left and there'll be nothing left to raise.

As I previously stated, the dragon can fight using physical methods such as biting. This will leave it vulnerable to attacks and also defeat the purpose of having a dragon.

All in all, it seems as though having an ice dragon is counterproductive. The only uses I see it having is to burn obstacles that the army cannot breach by any other means.",8,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I believe, and bear with me here, that Game of Thrones, all 7 seasons up to now, has been a long elaborate advertising campaign by Budweiser. Think about it. What better way to make devoted customers than to create an entire cult following? George RR Martin, HBO, all the actors, are simply PAWNS in the long game and Budweiser is pulling all the strings.

In season 8, Budweiser will finally reveal their hand, and Bud Knight will come back to lead the White Walkers (symbolism for how COLD their beer is) in their epic fight to take the throne, where the undead Bud Knight will finally take his true place as the ruler of Westeros.

Im trying to set up my own with the following scoring setup:

1.  Pick 10 characters that you think WILL die. 

2.  Based on episodes 1-6, you will receive a point value based on which episode they die in.  (Die in ep.3, you get 3 points,  etc. )

Strategy here is to pick 10 characters that definitely will die, but not low hanging cannon fodder that will get killed off in the early episodes...  you want to pick big name characters that will last to the final hoorah, but if they end up living, you get 0 points for them...

Dany may be worth more points than Ser Gregor,  but a guaranteed 3 might be better than a possible 0, if she wins and lives. 

Suggestions? Feedback?

I also plan to add in some bonus points for plot line guesses (who will be the last to sit on the throne,  will Jon ride a dragon, is Tyrion a Targaryian, etc)

So, I was doing some research on the Game Of Thrones universe and I found something very interesting that I didnt know before.

Among the many types of magic practiced in westeros or elsewhere, one particularly attracted my attention: necromancy. 

 Necromancy is the art or the ability to raise the dead as automatons, theyll have zero conscience, and are dedicated to serve a specific purpose. This is very similar to the mountain and the wights. This kind of seemingly forbidden magic is practiced in Qohor, Asshai and volantis...

I have not (yet) read the books, but apparently in clash of kings, Harrenhal's servants say that Qyburn practices it (readers please confirm). Also, I dont remember that such a thing was mentioned in the series, but I remember he was expulsed from the citadel because of his practices.

It also makes me think that if the Night King uses necromancy to raise the dead, then maybe (I said  just maybe)  he already had this ability before the children of the forest turned him, and that may also mean that the children of the forest didnt chose just some random guy but a specific one.",11,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

1). Cercei Outfit in Season 7 has incredibly strong resemblance to Night King Armor - Black and Grey, Sigil at throat, short sleeve black overjacket echos his shoulder armor.

2). Everybody already knows Jamies armor looks much more Northern with a noticeable absense of Lions on his shoulder armor...but

3). Has anyone else noticed an absense of a sigil?  I looked and looked and any time Cersei is wearing the crown she always has a Lion Sigil, either at her throat or on her decorative shoulder armor.  In season 8 photos, I share a pic of Cercei wearing the crown, but her outfit is absent any sign of her Lion Sigil.  At least it is not in the standard place of her throat or shoulder armor.

Its too small a bit of info to weave a theory around, except that Jamie fights for the North and possibly against Cercei, but I thought Id share the observation.

In addition to Jamies moniker of KINGSLAYER, of all my little theories, I think the one that completely explains Varys https://redd.it/ao1zjs leads to the conclusion Jamie is The Prince Who Was Promised.

Clearly, with the destruction of the Ice Wall, the old peace pact agreement at the end of the War For the Dawn is broken, and a new pact must be agreed to if men are victorious in the next war and all the White Walkers are not destroyed.

In order to battle and destroy the Knight King the Prince Who Was Promised must undergo the dragon glass dagger transformation ritual at the Weirwood tree with the stone spirals.  He then becomes the Night Prince, and must challenge and defeat the Old Night King with Lightbringer and replaces him.

Somewhere in the mix the Lannister castle is surrendered to Dany and Jon. Cersei is captured.

Jamie passes sentence and the man to pass the sentence must wield the blade.

Bran seeing visions.  Sees Azor Ahai driving his sword into Nissa Nissa.  And also tells of how the Prince Who was Promised must undergo the ritual he saw.

So, first Jamie is tied to the tree and a dragon glass dagger is thrust into his heart by the children of the Forest.  We watch the transformation.  He is untied and takes the sword Lightbringer and the pregnant Cersei is tied to the tree and the transformed Jamie drives Lightbringer into her chest.  But instead of dying, she, too transforms.

With the wight army defeated by the army consisting of undead like Benjen, the NEW Jamie and Cersei with entire antourage arrive at the ruins of the Ice Wall.

There waits the Old Night King and surrounded by walkers.

Prince Jamie and Night King battle.  Jamie slays Night King, walkers all bend the knee to Jamie their new king.

Sometime during the war, Jon Snow is killed, but he is made into one of the undead just like Benjen.

Jon Snow had already bent the knee to Dany.  It would be too weird for the situation to change and her then bend the knee to Jon.  Dany remains on the throne.

Jon becomes the first undead Lord Commander of the Watch.  Or Commander of the Undead Watch.  There are a lot of Undead soldiers.  Jon never returns south of the wall as the spell remains preventing the undead from entering Westeros proper.

Dany gives birth to boy girl twins, who will marry and continue the Targarian line.

Tyrion Lannister rises to head house Lannister.

At the very end we see  Ishtar King Jamie and Night Queen Cersei carryin* two babies, a boy and a girl, the progeny of the two and the beginning of a white walker race that does not require human baby tributes who will be the prince and princesses of their house.

The babies are swaddled in blankets bearing a new Sigil.  A Blue Lions Head.",5,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

It was written by the show creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, and directed by Tim Van Patten.[2]

Nearly all the action of the episode happens during travel: Eddard Stark and his daughters accompany the king's entourage to King's Landing to occupy the post of Hand of the King, Tyrion Lannister joins Jon in his travel to the Wall, and the newly wed Daenerys goes with her husband's khalasar to the city of Vaes Dothrak. Meanwhile, in Winterfell a grieving Catelyn Stark watches over her unconscious son Bran.

The title of the episode refers to the long road that snakes throughout Westeros, eventually ending at King's Landing.

Viewing figures were unchanged from the premiere, despite the second episode airing on Easter Sunday. Critical reception to the episode was favorable. Filming locations included several notable Northern Ireland locations, and the filming itself was complicated by the difficulty of integrating canine actors into several crucial scenes.

Both new outfits include a new aspect - red colour. She wore costumes with red during season 7, but this time there is red colour included even in the winter outfits, more importantly - the winter coat.

There were fan theories that the cream and gold colours which were part of Dany's winter coat in season 7 were meant to be ""a clever homage to her soon-to-be-lost dragon, Viserion."", as referred to in Vanity Fair's interview with Michele Clapton (costume designer).

She basically denied it, but I think that this theory might actually be true. Clapton has a very complex creative approach to her work on the series, and I think that she was just afraid that in her future work she would be limited by the confirmation of this theory, and couldn't keep creative continuity in her work. So she kept it a secret.

Now that we see the new photos with costumes including red, which is Drogon's colour (Rhaegal is green), it might be a reason to assume that Drogon will die in the final season.

What do you think about this? Let me know if I am just being paranoid, missed something, or if you find this theory plausible.

I've recently been wanting to rewatch all 7 seasons before April 14th. I've seen most of the seasons twice but am foggy on some of the details and visuals of the first couple seasons. At this same time I've gotten the urge to read the books after watching tons of fan fiction videos on YouTube, many of which use quotes and lore from the books. 

My question is do you think it would be weird to rewatch the shows at home to get ready for season 8 while at the same time reading the first book in my spare time away from home. I know I won't be able to watch all 7 seasons and read all the books before the premiere but id love to know some of these extra details. 

Also after season 8 ends, is there any worth in continuing to read all the books I haven't yet? Part of me just wants to return the books and maybe revisit them once the shows finished.

Any sort of answer is very appreciated!

Instead of making one of those giant posts filled with *too much* speculation and details I'll make this one short and brief and straight to the point without too much of the wild speculation and try to make it cohesive and plausible.

# FACTS:

\- George RR Martin has stated that his ASoIaF series is **heavily influenced** by Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings.

\- George RR Martin has stated that the series will **end bittersweet**, much like The Lord of the Rings (wounds are never fully healed; the world is not the same, it has to be rebuilt - Frodo has to leave, Sam and his friends are broken about it etc - and even before that, in the books, the Shire is heavily destroyed by Orcs and many dead). It's not a happy ending, but it's certainly not one of the worst. I think this series will end a little more somber, for better or for worse. But that would be speculation and not a fact (as of yet, hehe).

\- George RR Martin has stated that he **hates the typical hero/villain trope** where you could guess who would make it or not - and perhaps even what their backstory would be, and that he wanted his characters (especially the important ones) to have many layers added to them and function as complex characters and not (just) plot points to get character(s) from point a to point b. It had to make sense for the characters to do what they do, not the story.

&amp;#x200B;

# SPECULATION:

\- The Night King most definitely isn't a black/white character per say, because we haven't really had a character of importance be that yet on this show nor especially in the books. They have layers to them, and this mystical figure is certainly not an exception. He has a purpose, he has a goal - and that goal is most likely to be relieved of his cursed duties as a King of dead people, and his answer might be hidden in the mystical fortress known as Winterfell - or the Song of Ice and Fire Jon Snow/Stark-Targaryen. It could be more complex than this, but I think this would be the more obvious and understanble route for the character to go and to be. With this in mind, we move to the other point:

\- Jon Snow/Stark-Targaryen is literally Aragorn of this story, at least now. He is the heir to the Throne - he doesn't necessarily (have to) want it, but it is his. He is also a key puzzle piece to the Night King/Army of the Dead riddle. This is obvious, as his bloodline is the combination of the story's title combined with the Night King's almost respectful, calm and interested look every time he has seen Jon appear. It's a very telling sort of look looking back at it, because at Hardhome he has no way to know anything about Jon's importance - whether it be as a soldier, at the Night's Watch or certainly not as a King and a heir. But yet he does. He does know. Because he sees things, like Bran. He knows. He knows Jon is his key out of this place. Jon, Winterfell - and perhaps even Mrs. Targaryen, Dany, too. But Jon is a key piece. It is obvious. Every time he sees Jon he's looking forward to whenever his moment is to come. And he knows it is near.

\- King's Landing is literally Gondor of A Song of Ice and Fire/Game of Thrones. In The Lord of the Rings, the battle of Gondor was won by team effort - but most importantly the crucial puzzle-piece of the **Army of the Dead** (hmm) after a deal struck by Aragorn, heir to the throne of Gondor.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's combine all these three massive points with the potential outcome, looking at it from a Lord of the Rings-influenced standpoint (with liberties, of course).

1. Jon Snow (now known heir to the throne of the Seven Kingdoms/King's Landing) strikes a deal with the Night King to take his place as the new King of the Dead (or perhaps die and end the *curse* all together, seperately or together). This bargain, as Jon Snow's term, includes The Night King and his army helping overthrow and kill Queen Cersei and lay King's Landing low. This would paralell Aragorn's bargain with the Army of the Dead, and how they together crushed the forces of Mordor. Upon doing so, Jon will relieve him from his curse. The way to do this might be to become the new Night King, or perhaps even more complex by sacrificing Daenerys (with his Valyrian Steel Sword) to turn it into Lightbringer and then also Jon the Prince that was promised, the only weapon that can kill the Night King, and end his curse. Main idea, however, is that Jon will use the Night King and his army to end Cersei's reign.
2. It would, however, not be completely George RR Martin-style to make it too (emotionally) simple. Therefore, I can only imagine Jon taking over for the Night King as soon as the Battle of Winterfell is over/has come to a stop, and The Night King's motivations are made clear to Jon himself. Then, to make it emotional - the Night King would be relieved of his duties there and Jon now a walking dead - who day by day becomes a colder, more distant person - a shadow of himself, if you will - begging someone to kill him when the war is over (it takes fire to kill ice, you know - so Daenerys might be the *Princess that was promised* \- like season 7 teased, and end his suffering. Maybe doing so would even kill her herself).

&amp;#x200B;

\- And I would also like to add more potential outcomes (LOTR-influenced), as after the battle of Gondor the remaining army of Men had to walk to Mordor to give Frodo and Sam time to win/fight evil one last time. So the war wasn't won after this.

This is where I think the (now known) Littlefinger twist could play in as a parallel to this, where the Littlefinger killed in Winterfell was a Faceless man (like its kinda teased in a very short and special scene from season 7, youtube it if you will) and Petyr Baelish has been in the Vayle the entire time with Robyn Arryn as his puppet. This now very underutilized army will be the last test of freedom for all of mankind, but to our surprise Littlefinger will win and become King of the Ashes (King's Landing is by now pretty damn burnt up) - and the remaining Starks and allies and whatever houses are left will have to retreat back home. But the Seven Kingdoms are now longer under the ""One Throne"". They are all independent as they obviously choose not to see this new King as a true and just one for their world to be under; gearing up for a new war with the schemer himself. Gendry and Sansa will unite Baratheon and Stark, and now fight for the throne his father once had - just like in the past - in a future battle that we, as audience, will only have to imagine one day come, but not see unfold on screen as the world has to rebuild itself after having rid themselfs of one evil, now getting ready to fight another.

&amp;#x200B;

# OTHER PARALLELS:

\- Winterfell is kind of the Shire of our story, and the Scouring of the Shire (the end of ROTK book) will be the parallel of the Orcs attacking the Shire with the Army of the Dead/Whites attacking Winterfell.

I just now came to the scene where Tyrion and Cersei see Sansa and Loras talking and discuss Tywin's plans for marrying them off.

[spoiler for last season in this para]
&gt;!It is a really good scene that shows so much about these two characters, especially if you come in after having seen their showdown after Cersei sees the wight. In both scenes they start off fighting but eventually both actually feel empathy for each other and realize (although neither really acknowledges it) that they are on the same side in some ways.!&lt;

The season 3 scene starts off with their usual insult-banter thing (that in itself is among the best character frenemities in the show) but it goes through quite a few quick tone changes. Both are initially pissed at their father for ""shipping them to hell"" but both are utterly powerless to do anything, he's Tywin Lannister. They both know (and acknowledge through subtext) that Joffrey has too much power but is an idiot (trying to kill Tyrion publicly) who doesn't know how to play the game and will succumb to Margaery's wiles. They are again powerless to do anything about him. They both agree that once Tywin's goes, the Tyrells (through Margaery and Joffrey's kids) will probably control things and they are going to find themselves quite powerless. Then the conversation pivots to Jamie. Both care deeply for Jamie, are worried about him but don't know where he is. And once again they are powerless to do anything to help him.

We also see Tyrion realizing that he's fucked and being serious about it rather than make a joke. We also see a couple of glimpses of Cersei actually showing some niceness/humanity. First when she acknowledges that without Tyrion's help they would all be dead and Stannis would have won. Then when she asks, with a hint of pity in her voice, ""Who will tell her?"" referring to Sansa being told that she's going to be married to Tyrion.

Seeing how my perception of this scene would have been so different had I not known what comes in later seasons, I am wondering if I shouldn't reread the books. If the show which crams everything into a few seasons has such nice and subtle foreshadowing, what will GRRM be able to weave in hundreds of pages?",9,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

My question is, given his true love towards Catelyn, did he really want her son dead? The assassin could also kill Catelyn if Summer did not get involved. Or was he aware that Summer would show up and save the day?

Plus, he gave the fancy dagger to the assassin and later claimed than it was for Tyrion. If the assassin managed to kill Bran and run away, then nobody would have realized that the Valyrian steel dagger has been used, and the conflict and chaos that he was looking for would not be achieved. Or maybe he asked the assassin to leave the dagger there after killing Bran? Which is a very stupid idea and would cause more suspicions. So what was his agenda? Did he exactly predict that Catelyn will not leave the room and the assassin cannot kill Bran and he will be killed himself by Summer or what?",16,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Scenes with Joffery tend to be Sansa Fearful and scared. Other scenes she is sad because of the events that transpire. Sometimes just thinking about the next love of her life. Her responses also are pretty dull but I can't blame her, the struggles she experiences alone(even with ""friends"" at Kings Landing) affect her mental state deeply and she is only 14. But I do feel like out of all the Starks, she is the second most boring after Rickon Stark. I know enough about what happens later in the seasons that she improves as a character.

Daenerys has been one of the fan favorites for the new ruler of the 7 kingdoms, and it certainly seems like her arc is building towards that.  However, the only other time the 7 kingdoms were conquered was because the conqueror had 3 dragons.  Daenerys no longer has three dragons.  She has two.  I understand that it might be a bit of a stretch to say that her chances are totally shot because she lost one dragon, but viewing that 3 dragons remark in the context of her losing a dragon seems to indicate that they don't intend on her taking the throne.

There is of course less known theories and some unlikely ones too.

I am wondering, what theory to you think is going to happen, and how will the show build up to that theory with so little time left?
__________________
One theory that interests me is the Bran= Night King theory. 

In order for that to actually play out, the show would have to spend some time explaining how that happened, and there is enough show time left to be able to play that out in a efficient way. This theory does make sense to me, but feels kind of dull. How this would tie with Azor Ahai is interesting to think about though.
___________________
Ok next theory Im curious about, Who is The prince who was promised, (Azor Ahai)?

My first thought about this, is that maybe there is no Azor Ahai, perhaps the whole prophecy is a mistake. Or if there is an Azor Ahai, they might die and become irrelevant. The night king may simply win. But, lets consider that is not the situation and there is an Azor Ahai, who is it? 

Most people tend to think it is Jon Snow, some people think it is Daenarys or Jaime Lannister.  Regardless of who it is, how will this play out in the show. According to the prophecy, I believe Azor Ahai, must plunge a sword into the one they love. Jon Snows loves Daenarys and Daenarys love Jon Snow. Jaime Lannister however loves Cersei, and he is currently on his way north. In order for Jaime to be Azor Ahai, he would have to come back and kill Cersei, which seems unlikely to happen to me.

______________

Now I was wondering about these characters and how their story is going to tie into the end of the show.

Melisandre, I feel like she still has a role to play, she probably will have something to do with Azor Ahai, but the conversation between her and Varys makes me think she will have something to do with Varys story line too.

Varys is kind of a mysterious character, we know he was castrated when he was young, and the day that happened he had heard something from the flames. What he heard is unknown though. There is theory that Varys is a mermaid, but I really dont see how there will be enough time left in the show to play that out and still play out all the other key points left.

____________

Anyways, sorry if I got any information wrong, I was just thinking about some different theories and wanted to get some discussion about other possible theories or things I may not have even thought about.

1) The possible role of the Starks

2) The role of Daenerys 

3) Potential roles Sam and Melisandre might play 

4) Tyrion's impact on the show

5) How I think the show will end

Would love to get feedback and can't wait for April.

He's been called The Kingslayer from the very 1st season who slayed The Mad King as i get the GRRM he loves to do foreshadowing if he just a meme or history part GRRM surely killed him any time cuz he don't bother killing any main cast but Jamie survived till very end. He also leave Cersei as she become more n more mad. So this time Kingslayer will slay The Mad Queen!!! Now people will say he loves her more then anyone but people do change as we saw in season 6-7 his interest in her become more less also he somewhere in the heart starts to love Brienne of tarth.

It's really cool that we FINALLY have a clearer first look at S8 that is NOT short as hell (even if it is just images) and some of them look pretty cool, I am not going to talk about all of them since most of them are just images of the characters (even if they do show off there new attire) but there are three I do really want to talk about, but before I do I should probably give you my thoughts on the images that were released in general.
While i'm still alittle disappointed we didn't get a new trailer (and probably won't until late February or March at the latest) I will admit I am happy we FINALLY have some more from S8, and the images don't look that bad and some show off new attire from the characters. But like I said while I am satisfied I won't be talking about all of them, but I mainly want to talk about three in depth. the Jaime image, the Arya image, and the Jon and Dany image.

- Jon and Dany: i'll start with J&amp;D since that's one of the first one's on the official HBO website. Now for this image they are most looking in the North. the fact the area look more like Iceland then where they film the North scenes (which is Belfast) But I think it is the North, I don't really see any reason to go beyond the wall again especially if THIS image is from the first episode though I do have a tinfoil prediction that maybe this is after they arrived at WF and they've to the Ruins of Eastwatch to asses the damage, only problem with that is that in another image it shows them in the same location looking at each other with a happy expression so if this was the ruins of Eastwatch I don't think they'd be doing that. So it is probably either White Harbor after they land with J&amp;D looking out to the Northern EXT. or they have arrive at WF and they are looking out at WF from afar before the enter the place. But the reason I like this pic (and the second pic with J&amp;D in it) is because of the fact this not only debunks the stupid Political Jon Snow theory but also shows that Jon and Dany really do love one another, and I have a feeling this is going to be a romantic scene (like serious they mine aswell play Can you feel the love tonight over it). Though the reveal of Jon's parentage may put a jab into there love for one another, weather or not that means they will break up or not I am not sure but if they do i'd imagine they decide to become lovers not caring weather or not they are related. Either really love this and the other image of J&amp;D and I think it looks visually beautiful as well. Plus it reminds me of Toothless and the new Lightfury from httyd 3.

- Arya: This one interesting to me because NOT only does Arya still NOT show off any new attire (I mean it's possible that library add may have showed off a slightly different attire with a new more lady like haircut but that was still an add for something else so we'll have to wait and see) and also it's obvious she is looking at some on or something. But who or what is she looking at? More importantly what emotion is she even conveying? It's alittle hard to know since for one she has traits of a FM now and also has been through so much Trauma at a very young age (which is very ironic since the actress who plays her herself also went through Trauma but that's another discussion for another day) and also it's just an image and it's sometimes hard to make out an emotion with an image, especially with an character like Arya. But the things I've heard are that she is either happy, shocked, neutral, unimpressed, in wide eye amazement, or zero emotion due to her being a faceless man and no one (even though she said she was Arya Stark of Winterfell of S6 but fine whatever). It could really be anything but I got two ideas. the first one as that this is when J&amp;D arrive at WF and Arya sees either Sandor, Jon, Gendry, or one of Dany's dragons. I maybe thought she was looking at Dany disapprovingly (as I do think Arya will not be okay with Jon bending the knee) but Dany is not tall enough so i'd say either Sandor, Gendry, Jon, or one of the Dragons in the sky. But however my second idea is that this image is NOT from when J&amp;D arrive and is much later in the episode. I mainly think this because not only will there be scenes in Wintertown, and Arya may go there to help people get ready to go to WF for better safety, but also I think Arya's reunion with Jon needs to be separate from his arrival with Dany and his reunions with Bran and Sansa and everyone else. maybe this image is even from the same scene of another image that features only Jon, when Arya maybe arrives with people from Wintertown as well as Edd and members of the Night's Watch, Tormund and some surviving Wildlings from Eastwatch, and Beric. Either it'll interesting to see how Arya interacts with characters like Dany and Tyrion and how she will deal with having to fight along side people who wronged her and her house originally (Jaime, Beric, and possibly Theon). Also I kindof hope my second idea is right because this will give them a chance to not only parallel Jon and Sansa's reunion in S6 but also give the Arya and Jon reunion more emotional weight.

- Jaime: Saving the best for last is Jaime. And I mean it, as his image is probably my favorite image out of all of them. For one he has the beard back and while it's not the beard he had in Season 2 and 3 it still looks awesome on him, NCW knows how to wear the beard (Plus it kindof looks like he's posing for the intro of one of Favorite shows Smallville). Also I love his new attire not only because I looks badass on him but also it shows how much he's changed. He is wearing Northern armour now and on top of that it resembles Robb's armour, bringing his arc full circle and showing how much he has change. He's become more Humble, Wiser, Honourable even...to an extent, etc. That being said idk where this image is set, some are saying it's the Riverlands and maybe he just got random armour from a smith but I think it's most likely in the North as I don't think smiths in the Riverlands would just make armour like that (Northern based armour I mean), Plus the lighting in the image looks like it's in the north. Also judging by the image not only is this after Jon reluctantly accepts his help and also possibly his talk with Bran, but also he is smiling, could he be talking to Brienne and/or Bronn and/or Tyrion in this scene?",9,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

* Biggest moment: The introductions of Littlefinger and Varys. Particularly during the early seasons, scenes with these two were delicious... especially if they were scenes with just the two of them. It took them very little time to inject themselves into the main story. Littlefinger intercepting Catelyn, for example, is another moment that will reverberate for seasons to come.
* Episode MVP: Littlefinger. From a humble beginning, it's clear from our first introduction that he wields a unique power, one that can't be measured by armies.
* Final thought: It's a great episode if only for the introductions of Littlefinger, Varys, Ser Barristan and Syrio Forel. All fan favorites.",3,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I have seen many theories on who will sit on the throne at the end of season 8, but what if no one sits on the iron throne in the end? My theory for how season 8 will end is deeply rooted from the Andals and the prophecies/teachings of the Seven. Before I get into my theory the background of how the Andals originally came to Westeros must be stated. Many years before GOT takes place, the Valyrian army was sweeping west across Essos destroying everyone in their path. As the Valyrians marched closer to the narrow sea they took out the Ghiscari, this made the people that occupied the northwestern land of Essos, know as the Andalos very nervous. In the holy book of the Seven-Pointed Star it is said that the Seven crowned the Andal prophet Hugor of the Hill, and promised him and his descendants Great kingdoms in foreign lands. Combining the fact that the Valyrians were rapidly expanding their territory and the prophecy given to Hugor of the Hill, the Septons told the people that they must pack up and cross the narrow sea in search of new lands. Many people did not question this because of they deeply believed in the teachings of the Seven and knew they stood no chance against Valyria.

THEORY:
For the most part, any person living south of the Neck and north of Dorne is most likely of Andal descent and believes in the New Gods (The Seven-Pointed Star). Given that the Lannisters are 100% Andal, I foresee history repeating itself at the conclusion of the show. My theory is that the white walkers will continue to expand south (much how the valyrians expanded west), on their path they will sweep out whoever is left in the north (the Ghiscari) and eventually begin to travel south past the Neck. Cersei has already stated that she will deal with whatever is left of the Night King and his army. I believe that Cersei is so stubborn that she will in fact wait. Cersei and everyone else will realize they stand no chance against the Walkers once they cross the Neck and will look to travel elsewhere. Being that this section of the country believes in the Seven they will remember the prophecy given to Hugor on the Hill and leave Westeros in search of new prosperous lands. The world of GOT is known to have 4 continents: Westeros, Essos, Sothoryos, and Ulthos. Being that the latter two are very far and Essos is already occupied I believe that everyone will travel west of Westeros. The idea of going west of Westeros has already been introduced in season 6 episode 8 when Arya tells Lady Crane that she wants to go  west of Westeros. Essos is east, Westeros is west, but they is west of Westeros? Taking all of this into consideration I do not believe this theory is too far fetched. Has anyone else had this thought?

The theory videos have lots of material that I cannot pinpoint to where all the material is coming from.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*SMOKE\*\*

House Hightowers blazon is a burning tower on a smoke background.

This is the smoke.

The Hightowers influence comes at the beginning of Jaimes adulthood. Ser **Gerold Hightower**, was a [knight](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Knight) from [House Hightower](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Hightower) and the [Lord Commander](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lord_Commander_of_the_Kingsguard) of the [Kingsguard](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Kingsguard) for [Aerys II Targaryen](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aerys_II_Targaryen). Gerold fastened the white cloak of the Kingsguard about the shoulders of the newest member, Ser [Jaime Lannister](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jaime_Lannister). 

He was noted to be an incredibly honorable, loyal man, by all, including adversaries like Ned Stark. He took no pleasure in slaying this very admirable man.

Gerold was present when King [Aerys II Targaryen](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aerys_II_Targaryen) burned Lord [Rickard Stark](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Rickard_Stark) alive in the [Red Keep](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Red_Keep)'s throne room, and while [Brandon Stark](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Brandon_Stark) strangled himself to death trying to help Rickard.

After the two Starks died, Gerold took Ser [Jaime Lannister](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jaime_Lannister) aside and reminded him they were sworn to defend the king, not to judge him.

GEROLD WAS AN HONORABLE, LOYAL MAN  

who will turn a blind eye to serving an evil, mad king once he has sworn fealty.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*SALT\*\*

Euron Greyjoys blazon is an image of the Iron Islands Kraken-shaped Salt Throne. This is the salt.  

When Eurons brother Balon first declared himself [King of the Iron Islands](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/King_of_the_Iron_Islands), Euron directed the [Raid on Lannisport](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Raid_on_Lannisport) which burned [Tywin Lannister](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Tywin_Lannister)'s entire fleet at anchor. After murdering his brother Balon, he became the Salt King. Cersei names Euron ""Commander of the Lannister Fleet"" - although he primarily uses the Iron Fleet as his main ships - after he defeats the allies of Daenerys in Battle. He wants Cersei to gain power and satisfy his lust.

EURON GREYJOY IS A DESPICABLE, UNTRUSTWORTHY KINSLAYER 

who is, at present, the greatest, most reliable resource to his Sister, based on mutual enlightened (everyones eyes are open) self-interest

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*My speculation about the meaning of reborn between smoke and salt\*\*

As Jamies moral character is reborn, he reflects.

*And me, that boy I was ... when did he die, I wonder? When I donned the* [*white cloak*](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Kingsguard)*? When I opened* [*Aerys's*](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aerys_II_Targaryen) *throat? That boy had wanted to be Ser Arthur Dayne, but someplace along the way he had become the* [*Smiling Knight*](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Smiling_Knight) *instead.*

*He also has begun to admire Brienne of Tarth who only pledges her oath to worthy causes.*

*Finally, seeing and understanding the utter repugnance of Cerseis alliance with Greyjoy.... and his sisters treachery, he has an epiphany.*

*Honor and loyalty to an ignoble cause - is a moral failure.*

*A secure, beneficial arrangement with ignoble rogues - is a moral failure*

*Nobility lies in* 

*Pledging your loyalty to honorable men of good causes, like Brienne.*

*Understanding this he abandons the treacherous ignoble cause of Cersei,* *casts off the Lannister armor, dons the armor of the North and seeks to pledge himself to Jon Snow and his cause.*

*Reborn between smoke and fire - he is pure and driven to Snow (snort).*  ",10,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

What if the origin of the wall has been incorrect?

I was thinking about how old nan said all crows were liars... and while I feel too much discussion sometimes takes us down the rabbit hole, I started thinking about what the purpose of the wall itself was. Weve been led to believe that the wall was constructed to protect the realms of men. But why would this be? If men in the past were able to effectively fight the white walkers/others, then why would they need such an ungodly tall wall for protection? The tallest structure (other than the wall) in Westeros at the time of Aegons conquest was probably Harrenhall. The technological construction of this must have been immense.. and yet it pales in comparison to the wall. The same is true of Kings Landing after Aegon's passing. This really makes you wonder if the First Men/Westerosi ever had the technology or skill to build the wall. We as viewers accept the possibility that it was built with magic. But the westerosi dont have magic. So we think the children of the forest had something to do with this...

But what if it was a lie. If men/children in the age of heroes could effectively fight back the white walkers, and the wall is a defensive structure, it would make a lot more sense that it was put up by the white walkers. They work with magics more powerful than anything weve seen thus far, and they seem to love the ice. It also makes sense that they can take down the wall pretty easily too. They were able to get a dragon easily, almost as if it was planned. This only makes me wonder why they didnt reach for a dragon in Aegons time.

There's obviously a lot of plot holes that have been highlighted by others, but one I've not seen mentioned is this. 

Cersei's ""Walk of Shame"". She underwent that by admitting fornicating with her cousin Lancel Lannister. It was announced loudly and clearly by the High Sparrow to the masses gathered in the streets to witness it. Yet in later episodes, she's seen acting normally and conversing with her brother Jaime, plotting to get rid of the High Sparrow etc. So with the information about her dalliances with Lancel public knowledge, why does Jaime continue to support her and never once question why she was sleeping with their cousin while he was being held captive? It just doesn't make sense. 

In an earlier season episode, he's seen telling Catlyn Stark that he's only ever slept with Cersei, so in his ""own way, he's more honourable than poor dead Ned."" when discussing Ned's supposed bastard son Jon.

* Game of Thrones wiki summary: [https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Cripples,\_Bastards,\_and\_Broken\_Things](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Cripples,_Bastards,_and_Broken_Things)
* Biggest moment: There were a few notable moments in this episode, but none bigger than Catelyn having Tyrion arrested. She never could have known how bad the fallout would be. It was impulsive and stupid, but Catelyn often made mistakes when it came to her children. Even as she thought she was protecting them, she was bringing them more harm. It's like the mirror image of her and Cersei.
* Episode MVP: Daenerys. We get our first glimpse of Daenerys Stormborn, the Mother of Dragons. She strikes down the Mummer's dragon and comes to the realization that Viserys will never rule.

I did not like her at first but when season two started all I ever wanted for her was to be with her family once again. I needed to remind myself that she was just a little girl caught up in this stupid game of adults who manipulated her and used her to whatever they needed of her. This is me defending her honor in situations that people don't like her for:

* People say that Sansa cold have just told the king that Joffrey was a shit with the dog and stuff but really though she was in love? She is NOT the first person to do stupid stupid things just because of love (remember her aunt lynna? she started a freaking war because of LOVE, and the guy she ran with was married so uhhh, that's kind of stupid huh\_ . I even kind of wanted Ned to fight for Sansa and Lady in that moment but ""HONOR HONOR HONOR"" 
* Sansa was not the reason Ned died. Ned approached Cersei and right then and there Cersei already planned what could she have done to keep Ned's mouth shut also Littlefinger literally betrayed Ned with a knife to his throat and all went domino effect from that point and also it was shithead Jofferey's idea to cut his fucking neck. All Sansa ever wanted was to get her father back and she thought (keep in mind that she was a little girl, a sheltered one and doesn't know the ugly stuff in this world yet) was right for her and her dad.
* Sansa did not go with the Hound because as far as she knows, she is not sure if she's really safe with him. Given also the fact that he's rude and calls her ""LittleBird"". Really though, if some old dude calls me Littlebird and FORCES me to sing for ??some reason?? i wouldn't be trusting him too. Also if she did go, how sure are they that tywin lannister won't send hundreds of men after them. She also started to play the game, a little bit at this point.
* Why did she not go with Brianne. Simple. Brianne was a stranger, she was with Pod who was a squire of a Lannister and also Brianne was carrying a sword that screams LANNISTERRRR so why would she trust her that easily?
* Why did not tell Jon about Knights of the Vale. Well it was for the drama of the episode, it was D&amp;D who decided that and really tho Sansa told Jon to attack Winterfell when they had a larger force, at some point i think she was ready to tell her but still she could not trust Littlefinger.
* Why did she undermine Jon in the Great Hall? For me it wasnt undermining him, it was getting through his thick skull. Jon just proposed to see Daenerys who had dragons and was planning to conquer Westeros. Sansa and her family had a bad history with dragons and they couldn't be trusted, what was his assurance that Daenerys won't burn him too, or take him as a prisoner (WHICH BY THE WAY TOTALLY HAPPENED LMAO)
* When the walking-in-the-crypts teaser was released, she was ridiculed for not having a sword and not wielding one. Like really?? Is that so fucking bad? I can name characters who was still badass without having to weild a sword: Cersei, Margaery, Lady Olenna, Varys.

Summary : Cut Sansa some slack and stop hating her for reasons that was not in her fault. ",36,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Then later in S3 when Littlefinger is telling Varys that Ros was a bad investment, he says that he gave her to a friend who was so grateful for a fresh experience.

I think Daenerys will die, sacrificing herself to kill the Night King. She will die in Jon Snow's arms, with her two surviving dragons by her side. While she may not strike the killing blow, she will play an extremely important and pivotal role in stopping the army of the dead, which will result in her death.

Jon Snow, as a result, will ultimately come to terms with his identity as a Targaryen. Dany's dragons will go to him, and he will ascend to the Iron Throne. But instead of sitting down on it, he will fulfill Dany's wish of 'breaking the wheel', and he will have the dragons melt the Iron Throne, ending the conflict centered around it, and ending the game of thrones.


And now onto the other characters.


Cersei will go mad, like Aerys Targaryen before her. This will be caused by a series of awful defeats, as well as her pregnancy becoming a miscarriage (yes, I do think it's real). She will order Qyburn to destroy King's Landing with wildfire. Jamie, having been sent to King's Landing by Dany (or Jon) to try and negotiate some sort of piece, will attempt to convince Cersei not to burn down the city. This will ultimately fail, and he will be forced to kill both Qyburn and Cersei. Out of shame of having broken two oaths, and being named Queenslayer as well as Kingslayer, he will proceed to exile himself across the narrow sea, to Essos. 

I think Sansa Stark will live, and become Warden of the North. She will eventually marry someone she loves, and will be one of the few characters to really get a ""happy"" ending. 

Arya Stark will also live on, pledging herself to either Jon or Sansa. She will also play a role in the war against the Night King, and join the ranks of characters who have killed White Walkers, due to her ownership of a valyrian steel dagger. (Side note: I think every character who owns a valyrian steel weapon will kill a walker, with the exception of Sam.)

Speaking of Sam, I believe he will also get a ""happy"" ending, eventually becoming a grand maester at the citadel, and writing a complete history of Westeros following Roberts Rebellion, titled 'A Song of Ice and Fire'.

Tyrion Lannister will be asked by Jon to help him rule the seven kingdoms, but instead, he will decide to return to Essos and rule Meereen, keeping it entirely free of slaves as Dany wished. He will also play a role in the organizing the defense of Winterfell before that.

Bran Stark will also die, but not in the way one might think. He will risk it all to go further back in time then ever and dive further into the werewood net then he has before to discover to true origins and nature of the Night King, and the Three Eyed Raven, and will use this info to help the others finally stop the Night King. However, his mind will not survive, leaving him as just a shell with no mind. Arya will, with great regret, have put him down.

Jorah Mormont will die defending Dany, before she ultimately dies. This will completely redeem him in Dany's eyes. 

I also think Greyworm will die in a similar fashion, perhaps even alongside Jorah.

Missandei will live on, going on to serve Jon or Sansa. 

Tormund, after fighting the army of the dead (I believe he survived Eastwatch's destruction), will go on to lead a successful and peaceful wildling society south of the wall. 

Brianne will survive the battle of Winterfell, and happily serve and protect Sansa until her death.

Theon Greyjoy will die fighting Euron Greyjoy. He will defeat him though, leaving his sister to lead a reunified Iron Islands, and help Jon and Dany in the war against the Night King.

I guess in the start it's a bunch of new characters with their own stories, you don't catch it all, then later you are too caught up in the main storyline and your favorite character to catch the little- but apparently important details. But one of the most important details I've missed, and right in the very first episodes of the show is- Gendry might be having the highest claim to the Iron throne. Now I know, how could one of many Robert's bastards have more rights to the throne than Jon or Dany. Well, in the s01ep02, when Cersei comforts Catelyn while Bran is uncontious, she talks about her newborn son, a black haired beautiful boy that looks just like Robert, but then he was taken away from her. Right in the next episode, when Ned visits Gendry in the shop, Gendry says that all he remembers about his mother is that she had blonde hair and would sing to him. Ned makes a really weird face after that sentence, like he realised something. To start with the birth of Gendry, the reason why he could've been taken away is probably Jaime's jealousy, or Cersei (even tho she mentioned she really loved Rob in the beginning of their marriage) didn't want to raise  his child while having an affair with Jaime. Then, when he grew up a bit, suddenly a poor bastard child gets a job as an apprentice of the best blacksmith in the city? On behalf a mysterious man who arranged with the blacksmith to take Gendry as his apprentice? In one of the episodes Cersei also mentions never visiting their firstborn son in the crypt. Robert had many bastard kids, why is Gendry the only one that is being visited and ""looked after"" by Ned, Davos, and obviuosly others? Also, it might even be one of the main reasons Ned was executed. He was digging through the family tree, and imagine what would happen if it was found out the real heir to the throne is Gendry, not Joffrey? Cersei and Jaime would never let that happen. Now, in the s07ep05, when Gendry and Jon meet at Dragonstone, it looks just like the meeting of Rob and Ned back in s01ep01. They joke on each others looks and then laugh it off. To shorten the story, they will through fighting together in s08 become great friends, like their fathers were (or father and uncle to be precise lol). In the end, idk what exactly will happen to Dany, but I am most certain she will die, Jon would not be that interested in being a King who reigns from the South, he will support Gendry's claim to the throne, Gendry will become the King of Westeros, he will marry Arya and Jon will be warden of the North.

I posted a comment about this somewhere and thought it may be post worthy. 

A lot of Game of thrones is based on real history, specifically the War of the Roses comes to mind. The Yorks and the Lancasters (haha Lannister)  were descended from the same family and the war ended when Elizabeth of York and Henry Tudor (Henry VII) got married (who were third cousins).  It was very common during that time to inter-marry as a lot of leaders thought it would keep the peace and help maintain status. This thought process would continue for generations. 

It was rumored that before they got married, Elizabeths uncle Richard III wanted to marry her to secure his claim to the throne and keep Henry at bay. Bad example though, because its just a rumor.

If you look at how people married in that time and throughout history in Europe you will notice several royal inter-marriages up to present day similar to Jonerys.

Whether its right or wrong, the idea comes from our history which is rather fascinating. GRRM took a lot of time and care with the books and this small thing really shows that, IMO.

Here are several examples of incestuous couples from European history:

- From the Hapsburg family. Philip II married his niece Anna of Austria. Philip IV married his niece Marianna of Austria.

- Mary I (Henry VIII daughter, so granddaughter of Henry VII) and Phillip II were first cousins.

- Mary Queen of Scots married her first cousin Henry Stuart after Francis II died.

- Maria I of Portugal married her uncle who was crowned Peter III. Incest continued in their family after they had kids.

- Queen Victoria married her first cousin King Albert... this match was very popular at the time and shes known as one of the greatest monarchs in European history.

- Our current Queen Elizabeth II and Phillip are third cousins and second cousins once removed.

This doesnt take into account every single inter-marriage or any other civilizations outside of Europe. China has a history of incest to keep their long dynasties in tact. There was incest in Ancient Rome. And in Ancient Egypt, Cleopatra married her brothers and Ive heard of father/daughter marriages then as well.

For me the the real historical roots make it easier to get behind a cultural norm in a fictional story. Ultimately, I would be fine with a marriage alliance between Jon and Dany. ",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

A lot of Kings Landing in S6 is filler, moaning about the high sparrow. I felt it had lost its spark, so much of the scheming was gone. 

Meanwhile the hand of the king is Kevan Lannister, might as well be vacant. We get **nothing** from him and hes boring anyway. Jaime on the other hand, is interesting and seeing him navigate the role as hand would be really interesting. A soldier like ned but also an oathbreaker, a man without honour. Full circle thing too since it was suggested by Cersei. 

The biggest question is how this comes about. He was headed towards being a commander anyway, so I think this would be a good starting point in leaving the kings guard.

Also it reflects Roberts proposal to Ned. You have a daughter, I have a son. Lets unite our houses massively paraphrasing there lol. Some irony towards that scene.

Also they are two decent characters that would make a good couple in my opinion.

Bonus: mother of direwolves pups killed by a stag. Though Lannister's were credited with the Red Wedding, Cersei is Baratheon by marriage and it was King Robert's offer to Ned that set all of this in motion.



Broken down in chart form (nicely done by my pal, Kristi) :

Fate of the Direwolves = Fate of their Master/Mistress:

Category 1 (both dead)

Greywind / Robb - both beheaded

Shaggy Dog / Rickon - both killed by Ramsey and/or his Bannermen

Category 2 (direwolf is dead)

Lady / Sansa - killed by someone she trusted (Ned) ordered by a Lannister (Cersei)

theory: Sansa will be killed by someone she trusted at the order of a Lannister/enemy

Summer / Bran - killed by wights to save others

theory: Bran will be killed by wights to save others

Category 3 (both are alive)

Nymeria / Arya - separated from family in order to stay alive, found her own pack

Separated from her family but will find a new pack. The pack survives

Ghost / Jon - Looked different than family members, hidden but then was revealed.

A lot of Kings Landing in S6 is filler, moaning about the high sparrow. I felt it had lost its spark, so much of the scheming was gone. 

Meanwhile the hand of the king is Kevan Lannister, might as well be vacant. We get **nothing** from him and hes boring anyway. Jaime *on the other hand*, is interesting and seeing him navigate the role as hand would be really interesting. A soldier like ned but also an oathbreaker, a man without honour. Full circle thing too since it was suggested by Cersei. 

The biggest question is how this comes about. He was headed towards being a commander anyway, so I think this would be a good starting point in leaving the kings guard. 

My best idea would be that he tells Tommen of his true parentage like Myrcella. Tommen talks about wanting Margaery back, Jaime is named hand of the king and tries to gain his approval in getting Margaery back.

In a prior note (https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/anmpx8/spoilers_how_the_children_and_first_men_won_the/) 

I hypothesize that the War for the Dawn was won with the creation of an undead army of Benjens which had the added benefit of depriving the White Walkers of new Wights.  This form of necromancy was kept very confidential, given, at the end of the war, there were so many undead Benjens.  

Given the demonstrated power of the Children of the Forest magic, it is no surprise that the First Men began worshiping  the Childrens old gods instead of god of sea and god of sky.

It is hard to believe a man could fall in love with a White Walker but not so hard to believe he could fall in love with a quickly reanimated woman who was similar to the revived Benjen.  Growing comfortable with her reanimated nature, and finding Night Watch recruitment low, I suspect the Nights King decided that after a man from the Nights Watch died, he was to be reanimated and forced to continue to serve.  This is the bondage that is referred to in the story.

**We heard Jon Snow talk of whether or not he is released from his Night Watch vow after he was brought back from the dead by Melisandre.** So, it appears it could be considered a real question.

BUT the corpse bride drew attention as a novelty.  And, as her children seemed to just disappear, someone snooped and learned of the baby tribute to the White Walkers.  This horrified mortal men and history was written that it was the independent evil doing of the Nights King, so that the terms of the Peace Pact could remain a secret. 

The corpse queen story is the likely reason for the runes that prevent the undead from entering.  Her story is also probably the reason The Watch became a celibate organization.  

And **it seems all the obsidian daggers are buried outside the wall and rare elsewhere in Westeros.** The first men understood its purpose and value but did not want The making of undead Benjens unless time of war, and certainly not south of the wall.

**It is told that Brandon the breaker was the Lord of Winterfell when the Night's King ruled with his corpse queen at the Wall. He formed an alliance with Joramun, the King-Beyond-the-Wall, to end the thirteen-year long rule of the Night's King and free the Night's Watch from bondage. Thereafter he obliterated the Night's King's name from memory.**

What did Brandon break?  I think the fact of the White walker baby tribute made him stop transfer of tribute babies through the wall.  He broke the terms of the peace pact with the White Walkers (https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/anwu3n/spoilers_speculation_terms_of_manwalker_pact_made/) But some suitable tribute babies were still available on the other side of the wall.",7,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

With this child, Ned begins to better understand what ""The seed is strong"" means. It will be his downfall.
* Episode MVP: Varys. First it was his scene with Ned. Then it was his plotting in his dungeons. Finally, it was his awesome scene with Littlefinger.

But one thing doesn't make any sense to me:

In The Spoils of War, Dany's crew ambushes the Lannisters as they make their way back to King's Landing with the Tyrell Gold for the iron bank. This battle ends in a decisive Dany victory, with only Bronn and Jaime escaping by diving underwater, while the rest of the Lannister army is cornered and submits (apart from the Tarlys who are burned alive). 

Jaime and Bronn subsequently make it back to the city. At some point during Jaime's subsequent conversation with Cersei, she mentions that ""she has the iron bank"" to back her up. This is never revisited during the rest of the season so presumably stands as fact.

Did I miss something obvious? When Dany obliterated the Lannister convoy, surely she took their gold as well, leaving the Lannisters unable to pay their debts to the iron bank? At the end of The Spoils of War, I was assuming the fact that the Iron Bank had been promised an imminent payoff and would now not be receiving it as Dany had intercepted the gold in transit would become a major storyline, and that we'd finally see some of the iron bank's muscle being flexed - as we've been repeatedly warned that they ""always get their dues, one way or another"". Jaime and Bronn obviously arrived home from the battle entirely empty handed, so have they just not told Cersei that the Tyrell gold is gone, or did some of the convoy manage to break off with the gold prior to the Dothraki attack?",18,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Does it not seem far more likely that he took the head home after wrapping season 8 as a 'souvenir' from his time there, and used it without thinking for a prank - but accidentally gave away his character's fate?

1684,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2019-2-11,2019,2,11,4,ap74aq,self.gameofthrones,[SPOILERS] Crypts of Winterfell Season 8 Trailer,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/ap74aq/spoilers_crypts_of_winterfell_season_8_trailer/,TheFriendlyGrimm,1549825703,"Ive been watching the GoT Season 8 trailer and I think that, whilst this is definately a dream sequence- consider the unfinished quality and haziness- it is anchored in reality to the extent that it is intended to be a premonition; the Stark family must  face up to its true history in order to go onwards into the future. And 'true history' means much more than Jon's parentage and true name.

The choice of location, the crypts, makes it very clear that the past is still reaching out into the present; Ned and Catelyn are in early graves because Lyanna was also dead before her time, and the end of the trailer- which reveals statutes of Arya,  Sansa and Jon- makes it very clear that, unless these three people take the right path, they will be the next dominos in the line of fallen-too-young Starks.

But I am getting ahead of myself. First of all, the trailer features Sansa, Jon and Arya. Notably. Bran is missing. This, however, is not surprising; as the evolving three-eyed-raven, Bran has taken a very similar course to many a real-world younger son.  A brother who takes his vows to become a monk walks a different path from his uncloistered siblings; yes, he is still their brother but he is also brother to the whole world, yes he may still fight for them but his fight is going to be non-corporeal and metaphysical,  rather than a physical, earthly battle. And, just like a novice, Bran is no longer the same Bran who was a brother to Jon, Sansa and Arya; disassociated and unemotional, he is clearly well on his way to becoming the next three-eyed raven. 

So what does happen? The trailer starts with Jon Snow (or Aegon Targaryan) walking through the crypt, holding a torch (fire, the ancient defender of the Targaryans). He walks past Lyanna, his mother's, statue and there is an echo of Lyanna saying to Ned  You have to protect him. A feather- the one placed their by Robert Baratheon, falls from the statues hand and unto the floor.

Meaning: the rebellion was fought on a lie- Lyanna loved Rhaegar and willingly eloped with him.  The feather may symbolise that the lie is ended; Robert, the man who Lyanna feared would harm her son, is dead and Jon is King of the North on his own merit-  even though his parentage may cause a few raised eyebrows, it cannot take away the fact that he is a. still half Stark and b. someone who won the respect of his men based on sheer merit AND despite being known as a bastard. Now, of course, we know he is true-born,  which changes his status from 'last able-bodied son of Ned Stark AND a war hero' to 'Crown Prince, rightful heir of the Seven Kingdoms AND a Stark AND a war hero.' Not to mention, of course, that Lyanna would have been known to most of the older generation  of Northern Lords- she was a young lady with whom they would have danced and rode and generally hung out with socially- and they would remember her as not merely a pretty girl but as daring, bold and charismatic- all traits which Ned lacked- as well as being  brave and honourable (which Ned had in spades). Prejudice can cut both ways and, as the son of Lyanna and Rhaegar (who the Northern Lords would have known was highly intelligent) and with his father rehabilitated from cruel rapist to a man who wagered all  for the love of their Northern Rose and died with her name on his lips, Jon will go from 'he's done very well, blood will tell even in a bastard' to 'He's a true Stark and his noble- or should I say royal- blood shone through; I could see that he was meant  to be king, even as a lad'. This is likely to have far reaching effects (more below.)

The next scene in the trailer is Sansa walking through the crypt, passing her mother, Catelyn Starks statue. Catelyns voice says: What horrors have come to my family Its all because I couldnt love a motherless child. 

This quote is probably the most interesting part of the teaser as may be a wonderful little easter egg. Catelyn said this after Winterfell had fallen, when she thought Bran and Rickon dead; had she treated Jon like a son, he would have remained at Winterfell,  not left for the Nights Watch, meaning that instead of her little sons and an aged castillian, Winterfell would have had a young, intelligent and highly skilled general. With Jon at the helm, Theon may never have attempted to take the castle as his chances  of success would have greatly diminished. Moreover, with Jon at their side, Bran and Rickon had a fighting chance of escape, even if Theon was successful.

But why those word now, when Jon has her daughters and Winterfell under his care? When Sansa and Arya are both reconciled and Sansa actually significantly closer to Jon than she ever was before? The negative repercussions of Cat's treatment of Jon have  run their course.

Well, perhaps the negative consequences of Cat's prejudices have ended but there is still the fact that Jon and Sansa grew up being brother and sister in name only.

During her childhood Sansa was as lady-like and pretty as her mother; unlike tomboy Arya she did not spend her time with Jon and Rob, riding, practicing archery and enjoying the adventure playground which Winterfell was under Ned's care; Sansa sewed, sang,  danced and spent her time either with her other ladylike, pretty little friends or with her mother, learning how to run an estate. Therefore, as was usual in noble families, Sansa grew up knowing her brothers by sight but not spending any real quality time  with them after she left the nursery (which was particularly true of Jon, who we know Cat kept to the lower tables on formal occasions and it is reasonable to assume, based on the society, that Jon would either not have been invited to or,  at the very least,  not encouraged to participate in the type of social events where young ladies met young lords, due to both the prejudice in most noble households against baseborn children and the fear that he would 'taint' their maiden daughters reputation.)

Moreover, Sansa, who was more of a Tulley than a Stark and very close to her mother, also took on her mothers prejudices against Jon, who she called half brother from an early age and kept a dignified distance; he was, at best, not her brother in her  heart and, at worst, an unwelcome and embarrassing addition to her family, who- like her mother- she possibly wished had been raised separately from his highborn siblings and generally hushed up, like most noble bastards. 

That, however, was the view of Sansa the child, who saw anything which did not meet her standard of perfection distasteful. However, through bad luck, escabarated by her own wilfulness and  ignorance, which time after time, Sansa has learned that her prejudices  and assumptions were plain wrong; Joffrey was handsome and nobly born and he was an evil little bastard. Cersei was beautiful and nobly born and she was a sceming, manipulative ad ruthless bitch. Tyrion, an ugly dwarf, was a kind and considerate husband who  did not lay a finger on her, whilst Ramsey Bolton, although handsome, was a sadist who made her life completely and utterly miserable. And Jon Snow, her 'half-brother', the bastard son of her father and who knows who, was the one who saved her; despite her  coldness, her 'ladylike' scorn and distaste, Jon fought a war rather than hand her back to her husband and not only did he win, he personally beat Ramsey within an inch of his life before allowing her to kill him. (And that's not mentioning how 'Arya horseface'  turned out!)

The bastards or ugly = bad, Trueborn and beautiful = good worldview that Sansa had has shattered, as has her faith in her role models, Sansa has seen the death of her mother, whose prejudices, ignorance and activity helped to lead her and her son to their  deaths. She has seen Arya, whose resilience and non-conformity have just made her stronger, ditto Jon Snow. And Sansa has realised that, despite her attempts to play at the game of thrones, she is safer in the wolfpack than alone with someone like Littlefinger  at her side.

But one of the wolves is a dragon.

Now, Sansa could, theoretically, see Jons Targaryan parentage as a huge problem, especially if he decides to remain with Dany after his true history is known. Theoretically, Sansa could revert back to her earlier view; that Jon is an outsider, not truly  part of her family. She could even blame him for what has become of her family as he is the product of the union which sparked Robert's rebellion. 

However, Sansa has a huge debt of gratitude to Jon- he literally saved her life by refusing to hand her over to Ramsey and then fought  a war for her. Moreover, as much as Sansa might try to see herself as a cold and steely Commander but her choice of clothes and hairstyle suggests that she is still, deep down, someone who values beauty and romance. 

So, Jon is now both the dream of the pre-GoT Sansa- a young, handsome prince with a first class romantic origin story, and the ideal Lord for any sensible, experienced woman; Nothing could diminish the fact that Jon fought a war to protect her, beat her  ex-husband to a bloody pulp and then gave her the right to finish him off. When you have felt small and scared and weak, havng a man who cares about you for no other reason than that he is your brother not only save you but avenge you and then allow you to  take back your self respect and agency is something that will effect you on a deep level. Not since Ned has a man looked after Sansa in such a way, not since Ned has a man made her feel safe and allowed her to be herself, as a respected and influential lady  of the house Stark. And just as Drogo won Dany's love and respect through his raising her up from a slave bride to a queen, Jon has reinstated Sansa as Lady of Winterfell but, unlike Drogo, Jon hasnt wanted a wife or a son. 

Well, Sansa, as I stated earlier, is Jons liegewoman and one of his loyalist supporters but, in name only is she his sister; she grew up seeing Jon as an outsider, not a member of her family. At formal meals he did not sit at her table, in lessons, they  were separated and in their free time, Sansa sewed and drew and danced. In other words, there was a mental distance between them, where Sansa never considered Jon family and Jon knew himself to be an outsider, and a physical distance, as Sansas life was of a young Lady and Jons life was of a young lord- they were really almost as distant as Theon and Yara/Asha.

In other words, Sansa might call Jon her brother but he is no closer to her than a cousin and, in reality,. That is just what he is- her cousin.

And, whereas marry a half-brother is unthinkable, marrying a cousin is plain common sense in many noble families, especially where alliances do not need to be made (and which major house remains to make alliances with now- the Lannisters!) 

So, we have a Lady of Winterfell (who has always wanted a fairytale prince) and a King in the North (who is the fairytale prince and rightful heir to the seven kingdoms). Cat ensured that they did not see themselves as brother and sister; might the voiceover in the trailer hint that Cats discord, which helped to cause so much heartbreak, is eventually going to bind the family together.

Finally, there is Emilia Clarke's quote on Daenerys Targaryens final scene It fed me up... Knowing that is going to be a lasting flavor in someones mouth of what Daenerys is . . . If Jon steals her throne and Sansa steals her man, what will Dany do? ",8,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Their star-crossed romance is one of the easiest on the show to believe. They had such fantastic chemistry (probably why the actors later ended up married), and the only thing keeping them apart were a handful of words Jon said once. Tragic.

2. This hasnt always made me cry, but Im rewatching now for what has to be the fourth or fifth time (with the earlier seasons) and picking up on a lot of great acting, cinematography, screenwriting, and other bits that make this show great.

After hearing all the hype from people for years I finally decided to watch the show.
 The only reason I didnt watch it before was because... everyone was watching it. Yes thats weird I know but I always tend not to do what everyone else does. People said its the best tv show and I was like, noo it cant be that good. 

Fast forward until a month ago I was watching Vikings with my cousin whos also my best friend and he just said that Vikings was nothing compared to GoT and after I finished Vikings I had nothing else to watch so I thought I should give it a shot.
I started with season one of course and after I finished s1 I still couldnt understand why it was considered this good so I thought ok its just the build up, I must keep watching 
I watched s2 and s3 and I actually started liking it quite a bit but still not that much.
After I finished s4 and s5 I was blown away by the unexpected plot twists, which caught me completely off guard like Robbs death and Joffreys.
After s6 I was in love with the show after the battle of the bastards and also the original writing (dialogue) or seeing how everything came together and how everything was planned.
Today I finished s7 and omg Ive never loved a tv show or hell even a movie this much. I a non reader guy but Im considering getting the GoT books! 
TLDR: After many doubts about the show I watched it and now its my favorite TV Show (and movie) of all time!
Sorry for bad formatting Im on mobile and sorry for bad English. Wish I couldve expressed some thoughts better 
Cant wait for s8

It has been mentioned before in the books how the people of Winterfell when Ned returned thought the baby was Ashara's and Neds because they met at the tourney of Harrenhal when Rheagar crowned Lyanna the Queen of love and beauty and he danced with her where it is said that Ned and Ashara fell in love with each other at the tourney. What if Ned took the sword back to Starfall out of respect and honour for the Dayne house and had baby Jon with him and told Ashara of his true birth because he trusted her and loved her however Ned would have told her to keep the secret and lie before he returned to Winterfell.

Ashara committed suicide not long after the death of her brother (Arthur Dayne) and return of the sword. What if she committed suicide because she was heart broken at losing her brother, heart broken at losing Ned and felt she couldn't lie or keep the secret about Jon and therefore committed suicide. This would possibly explain the reason why Ned never told anyone else about Jons true birth because he was fearful others not only Jon would get hurt or die if he told them.

This seems feasible because it seems strange to me how Ned never told anyone not even Catelyn who he loved and Benjen who would have definitely kept the secret because Benjen would have loved Lyanna just as much as Ned did and both would definitely have kept the secret out of love for Ned and would have definitely caused less tension between Ned, Jon and Catelyn.",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Probably because it revolves around one of my two favorite characters (Jon and Arya), but this has to be my favorite episode by far aside from the first true encounter with the white walkers. 

Id like to call it the first true battle scene. Theres been sieges and slaughtering, but I consider this the first true battle. The pandemonium and chaotic moments after Rickons shocking moment were what do it for me. Film material Ill call it. I absolutely hate Ramsay obviously but his character is so shockingly sinister to have in this series I appreciate it. Its almost necessary I feel. 

The episode was greatly directed through and through. Moments where the camera couldnt focus and angles were smothered with bodies just made things all the more immersive. Im pissed about our giant wildling friend but I guess he couldnt be there forever. Now I just want to see what Ser Davos has in store for The Red Woman.

&amp;nbsp;

**JON SNOW AND SANSA STARK MARRIAGE**

&amp;nbsp;

Jon Snow and Sansa Stark will be the final King and Queen of the 7 Kingdoms. Their romance has been foreshadow pretty much since book 1 and season 1 and their marriage will bring peace and prosperity to Westeros. The wars of Ice and Fire will destroy the kingdom and they will be the ones rebuilding the realm to its former glory; Jon and Sansa storyline are in a perfect parallel and they have been groomed to be king and queen of Westeros for the whole storyline in the books. 

&amp;nbsp;
____________________________________________

&amp;nbsp;

**JON SNOW HAS ALWAYS LOVED SANSA STARK;**

&amp;nbsp;


Jon Snow has always been in love with his cousin Sansa Stark, which is why he decided to go to the wall after Ned Stark accepted Sansas engagement  to Joffrey Baratheon.  Jon was written as a mirror to Jaime Lannister and one of the reasons Jaime decided to join the kingsguard was because he could never marry his sister and lover Cersei. Once the secret of Lyanna and Rheagar is finally out, Jon and Sansa will be free to be together. Their love story is the main romance of the books. 

BTW, dont be surprised if they reveal the romance between Jon and Sansa in the end of the first episode of season 8. The episode will start mirroring the pilot episode, when King Robert arrived at Winterfell with his Lannister family and we all know the episode ended with the reveal of Cersei and Jaime incestual romance. 

&amp;nbsp;
___________________________________

&amp;nbsp;

**JON SNOW IS GOING TO BE A STARK;**

&amp;nbsp;

Jon Snow is going to take Sansa Stark name and pass the Stark name to all his children. He will be finally be a Stark and die as a true son by law of Eddard Stark, just like he always dreamed of in the books. This was foreshadowed in season 6 episode 5, when Sansa cloaked Jon Snow with a Stark Cloak.

&amp;nbsp;

__________________________________

&amp;nbsp;

**JON WILL FATHER A BASTARD**

&amp;nbsp;

Jon Snow will father a bastard. He will have trueborn sons with his wife Sansa Stark, but he will have a bastard girl with Daenerys. The books have foreshadowed this event to death. Jon and Sansa will pass this bastard girl as their own trueborn child and give her their Stark name. Sansa will raise this child as her own daughter and make her a Stark. Thats why the show wrote that scene with Catelyn Stark and Talissa on season 3 where Catelyn says that she failed to love and care for her husband bastard child, Sansa will do the opposite and love and care for Jons bastard daughter. 

Jon will do the inverse of his uncle Ned, who lied and raised his trueborn nephew as a bastard.  The story of Game of Thrones started with Ned Stark starting a war to prevent a bastard son of Cersei Lannister to sit in the Throne and it will end with a bastard daughter of Jon Snow as the heir of the Throne. History repeat itself and in the end, there wont be much difference between Starks and Lannister, they all lie to protect the ones they love. 

*The things we do for love* will still be the theme of the story in the end.

&amp;nbsp;

____________________________________

&amp;nbsp;

**THIS IS A STORY OF FATHERS DAUGHTERS.**

&amp;nbsp;


A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE its many tales in one; this is a tale of a Dragon prince madly in love with a Wolf girl; this is also a tale about home and families; about the things we do for love; its a story about tyranny and fear; its also a story about slow learners, who make several mistakes, but that eventually do learn, but ALSO, A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE, is a story about fathers daughters. 

And thats exactly what Arya, Sansa, Cersei, Daenerys, Brienne all are. These women are their fathers daughters. Thats why the show gave so much importance on those characters fathers and hardly touched the mothers relevance.

No one thought Sansa and Daenerys had much of their fathers in themselves, those two characters were always associated with their mothers, yet they will prove to all of us that they carry much of Eddar and Aerys inside of them, in the last part of this story. 

&amp;nbsp;
_______________________________________

&amp;nbsp;

**THE STARK SISTERS WILL GET EVERYTHING THEY EVER WANTED**

&amp;nbsp;


&gt;Arya:  We both wanted to be the other people when we were younger. **You wanted to be a queen and sit next to a handsome, young king on the Iron Throne. I wanted to be a knight, to pick up a sword like father and go off to battle.** Neither of us got to be that other person, did we? The world doesnt just let girls decide what they are going to be.

&gt;(SEASON 7 EPISODE 6)

&amp;nbsp;


**AND THEY ARE GOING TO BE QUEENS.**

Yes, we will have two queens. Game of Thrones started with two queens. Daenerys and Cersei; one a conqueror, the second a consort queen. Two women, whose obsession for the Iron Throne, left a trail of death and destruction on Essos and Westeros. So, we will finish this story with two queens, who will restore the Kingdom and improve the lives of their people. Sansa will be the consort queen of Jon Snow and Arya will be the warrior, the conquering queen that will lead the armies of North, Vale and Riverlands into war in season 8.

&amp;nbsp;

**SANSA STARK WILL BE THE QUEEN;**

&amp;nbsp;

Queen Sansa Stark will change the Law of Succession allowing girls to be heirs in front of their younger brothers. Sansa its the YMBQ of the prophecy and she will be the one casting Cersei Lannister down; Sansa will be very political active queen, changing laws and improving the lives of the people of Westeros and making important changes in the realm; She will be loved by her people and called THE QUEEN.

Sansa was always meant to be the final queen and the one who will rebuild the kingdom after the wars. Sansa entire storyline in the books was about observing the major players of the game make their moves and see the ramifications of those decisions. In Kings Landing, Sansa saw it first hand how ruling can affect the lives of the people in Westeros. She was able to see what to do, when in power, but also, what NOT to do as a king or queen. She learned a lot from Cersei, Margaery, Ollena, the Tyrells, The Lannisters, Littlefinger and will use this education for good use as a queen. 


All Sansas dreams will come true and she will be a living proof that life is a song. She will marry her brave and gentle hero; she will have children and rebuild her family and she will be a very beloved queen, admired for her beauty and kindness. 

&amp;nbsp;

**ARYA WILL BE THE QUEEN IN THE NORTH;**

&amp;nbsp;

Arys Stark will rule the North as a Regent Queen. Arya storyline in season 8 will be a copy of Papa Ned in the first Rebellion against the Mad King. She will call the banners and lead the North armies into battle in the final war of this story. George RRMartin himself said that she would conquer the world in the final part of this tale. 

&amp;nbsp;

**ARYA WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT IN THE FINAL SEASON !!!!!**

&amp;nbsp;


Arya is season 8 will be a huge warrior, with the help of Nymeria and their pack of wolves, she is going to lead their armies into battle, defeating Daenerys armies in combat (yes, the Dothraki bitches!!!!!!) They will probably meet in the Riverlands, where Rheagar and Robert had their first and final confrontation. She will be the one who will kill the mountain, avenging the people that he cruelly killed in the Riverlands and the Hound. Just like papa Ned became famous for killing Ser Arthur Dane, Arya will be legendary for killing the Mountain. 
They will write songs about her for years and years to come

&amp;nbsp;

___________________________________

&amp;nbsp;

**BRAN STARK WILL BE THE MAGICAL FORCE TO STOP THE ARMY OF THE DEAD**

&amp;nbsp;

I know the audience expects Daenerys and her dragons to be the magical force used to stop the Army of the Dead, but, dont be shocked if she decides to abandon the cause in the middle of the fight and leave the North before the big battle against the Night King. There is a lot of Stannis in Daenerys character arc on season 7 and in the end, Stannis left Jon and the Nights Watch on their own to fight the Night King on Hardhome, and went to march to Winterfell to fight the Boltons. Stannis could never let it go completely of the Iron Throne and I expect Dany to do the same. 

Its Bran Stark, who has been preparing himself to face this threat since the beginning of this story. Its Bran Stark who has been foreshadowed by the books and tv show to be the one who will matter the most in the end. Not the dragons. I suspect we will see the ghosts of the Kings of Winter, coming out from the crypts of Winterfell, to fight the final battle against the Army of the Dead.

&amp;nbsp;


&gt;Bran: What else have you seen it?
&gt;Jojen: The ONLY think that matters. **YOU**.

&gt;(Season 3 Episode 2)

&amp;nbsp;

Also, in the first Long Night, there was no Targaryens; The North was left to fight on its own with the help of the Children of the Forest and George likes to repeat his stories very closely to the original. Defeating the Army of the Dead wont be Bran only job in season 8, he has also been written as a foil to Daenerys, so I believe he will be involved on her final defeat. 

&amp;nbsp;

______________________________________

&amp;nbsp;

**DAENERYS WILL BE THE FINAL ANTAGONIST IN SEASON 8 AND WE WILL HAVE A SECOND DANCE OF DRAGONS BETWEEN JON AND DANY**

&amp;nbsp;


&gt;Jon Snow: They will see it you for **what you are**.

&gt;(SEASON 7 EPISODE 6)

&amp;nbsp;

In the beginning of this story we saw Sansa Stark falling madly in love with a beautiful prince, only to have her heart broken in a million of pieces in the end of season 1, when Joffrey shocked her by cutting her fathers head, finally showing how cruel and monstrous he really was. In the beginning of the series, we also had the audience falling madly in love with the beautiful Daenerys Targaryen, believing she was the hero of this story and just like Sansa, the audience will be shocked by Daenerys actions in season 8 and they will have their hearts completely broken in a million of pieces. Daenerys will finally show to the audience the monster that she really is. I expect to see a lot of shades of Joffrey on Daenerys in season 8. Remember, Joffrey believed his whole life he was the true heir of the Iron Throne, until a Stark man showed up in his life, telling him that this was a lie. This is exactely what is going to happen to Daenerys in season 8.

Remember when Sansa Stark fell madly in love with a monster and trusted a beautiful queen blindly when she was warned against it? You are all Sansas, you just dont know yet.

Daenerys could  never be the villain of her own story. Thats why it was always necessary for her to create a lie that painted her as the hero. She invaded Astapor to save the Unsulied from the evil wise masters; she conquered Meereen to pay back the slavers for crucifying the children slaves; she destroyed the sacred temple of Vaes Dothrak and killed all the Khalls, but she did for the Dothraki widows who didnt wish to stay in the  Dosh khaleen. Now in Westeros she had no more excuses, there is no slavery or evil masters torturing young boys in the 7 Kingdoms, so she was forced to create a new excuse to defend her invasion of Westeros. 


So, she told the audience that she wants to break the wheel of power that crushes the poor and the weak on Westeros. It makes no sense of course. She wants to break the wheel, by building a new wheel, this time, with only her family on top, crushing those under her. This is a phony ridiculous excuse and its supposed to be ridiculous. Its a silly lie, all Daenerys wants in the Iron Throne, but she cant admit it afraid it will make her look bad, so she created this silly little lie and the audience (just like Sansa fell into Cersei silly lies in season 1) fell right into. What Dany really wants is install an absolute monarchy, with only HER in power. 

Daenerys is a false prophet, who invented a sacred mission to convince her people and those who follow her of her good intentions, yet all her actions are motivated from the desire to take The Iron Throne, thats the one thing who truly matters for Daenerys and now in season 8, when her claim to the Throne will be contested by the bombastic news of Jon Snow stronger claim to the Throne. Thats whe she will finally show to the audience who she really is.


&amp;nbsp;


**WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE BLINDLY FOLLOW, GOD AND HEROS;**

&amp;nbsp;

By writing Daenerys Targaryen, George RRMartin wanted to show us how dictators and cult leaders are created. They started magical and inspiring, making beautiful speeches and promising great things, but in end, most of them are motivated by selfish desires and allow power to corrupt them. 
Daenerys story is also a warning about following leaders without questioning their motivations or decisions.  Daenerys is adored as a goddess by her followers and never has her decision questioned by them. Unlike Jon Snow who is always questioned by Sansa, The North Lords and the Wildlings about his decisions. The Dothraki and the Unsullied just blindly follow Daenerys around, like children following their mothers, never questioning her real motives, or even contemplating if the move to Westeros has actually any benefits for them. And as we are about to see in season 8, following leaders blindly can be a very dangerous thing because it can lead us to our graves. 
The audience, the Dothraki and the Unsullied never thought that their hero could just simply be  lying to themNo matter how much destruction and death she causes, her followers and advisers keep believing in her, defending her decisions, turning a blind eye to her questionable actions, finding excuses to her terrible acts. They know that she can be impulsive and dangerous but believe that in the end she is motivated by great ideals and will always listen to her advisers.. 

Daenerys first instinct is always destruction and violence, but most of the time, she is restrained by her advisers. **But the rope that holds her together is about to be ripped apart in season 8.**

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Daario Naharis: I pity the Lords of Westeros, they have no idea what is coming for them

&gt;(SEASON 6 EPISODE 10)

&amp;nbsp;

Daenerys was always meant to be the final antagonist of the story, her time in Essos was not about learning to be a good queen, she was learning to be a ruthless conqueror, which she learned very well. Dont be surprised if she marries Euron Greyjoy, they marriage has been foreshadowed on books and tv show. Daenerys its gonna shock the audience, she is going to behave in a way that will surprise a lot of people. 

Jon and Daenerys  relationship will mirror Rhaenyra and Aegon tragic battle for the Throne; This will be the final battle on episode 5, the fight for the Throne has always been the main focus of the story and this battle its what is going to put an end to this tale. Westeros will finally be united against the common enemy, which is Daenerys and her dragons. 

The Army of the Dead and the Night King were always a red herring, its was always Daenerys and her dragons the major threat for Westeros. I believe that more than half of the population of Westeros will perish during the final wars; many who survive the war will latter die during the winter without the food that was destroyed by Daenerys dragons in the Field of Fire 2.0; in her short period in  Westeros, Daenerys will cause a lot of deaths and destruction and she will be remembered as the Queen of Ashes. 

The stallion that mounts the world was never Rhaego. It was always going to be Daenerys. Essos will also be throw into chaos, without Daenerys dragons to impose order, the masters of Astapor, Meereen and the local cities will raise again and the region will probably be engulfed into a civil war. It will probably take centuries for the world to recover from Daenerys reign of terror. 


&amp;nbsp;

**WINTER WILL COME TO HOUSE TARGARYEN;**

&amp;nbsp;


Daenerys final battle on episode 5, will turn Kings Landing into ashes, but she wont be destroying just the capital of the realm, she will also put an end to House Targaryen. Their dynasty started with the destruction of Harrenhall and will end with the destruction of the capital that The Targaryens themselves build, closing a cycle of tyranny, fear and terror.  Daenerys will be the last dragon. 

&amp;nbsp;


**DRAGONSTONE WILL FAIL;**

&amp;nbsp;


I believe that Dragonstone will be destroyed in the end. The Castle in the remote island serves no purpose for  Westeros. It can not be used for grains production or animal livestock, the only use for Dragonstone in the past centuries was to be used as base for a foreign invasion, the castle will probably be destroyed in the end. Also important, Daenerys spent this entire story threatening to destroy others peoples houses and cities. To have her own ancestral House destroyed in the end would be very fitting to the story.

**WE WILL HAVE A SECOND REBELLION AND A SECOND DANCE OF THE DRAGONS**

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Don't fight in the North. Or the South. Fight every battle, everywhere, always, in your mind. Everyone is your enemy, everyone is your friend... every possible series of events is happening all at once. Live that way and nothing will surprise you, ..**everything that happens will be something that you have seen before.**
 
&gt;(Litllefinger SEASON 7 EPISODE 2)

&amp;nbsp;

Everything that happened in the past will happen again in season 8. Roberts Rebelion will happen again. Sansa will be kidnapped at some point, just like aunt Lyanna Stark; Arya will lead the North armies south to save her sister (just like Ned Stark did in Roberts Rebellion). The Riverlands, the North and the Vale will once again gather forces and go to war. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Stannis: What are you reading?

&gt;Shireen: **""The Dance of Dragons.""**

&gt;Stannis: What's it about? It's the story of the fight between Rhaenyra Targaryen and her half-brother Aegon for control over the Seven Kingdoms. Both of them thought they belonged on the Iron Throne. When people started declaring for one of them or the other, their fight divided the kingdoms in two. **Brothers fought brothers, dragons fought dragons.** By the time it was over, thousands were dead. **And it was a disaster for the Targaryens as well. They never truly recovered.**
 
&gt;(GAME OF THRONES SEASON 5 EPISODE 9)

&amp;nbsp;

We will have a second Dance of Dragons, with the kingdom divided between Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen. The Lannisters will be divided too by this war. Tyrion (the flop) will choose Daenerys side and Jaime will choose Jon Snow and the Starks. This will be the decision that will change Jaime Lannister legacy forever. 

Millions will die, but in the end Jon Snow and his armies will defeat Daenerys and her dragons. This war will not only destroy the realm but finally bring an end to the Targaryen dynasty. This battle will probably happens on episode 5.

**SANSAS PLANS TO CAST DOWN CERSEI**

&amp;nbsp;


Sansa will be kidnapped in season 8, probably by Cersei, but dont be surprised if this kidnapping has a twist. In season 1, in the scene where Cersei and the small council is forcing Sansa to write down a letter to Rob Stark demanding him to bend the knee to King Joffrey., we have Maester Pycelle warning Cersei that Sansa may be so sweet and innocent now, but once she is older, she may hatch some treasons!!!!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;she (Sansa) may be a sweet thing now Your Grace, **but in 10 YEARS, who knows what treasons she may hatch!!!!**
 
&gt;(SEASON 1 EPISODE 8)

&amp;nbsp;


Now, we know that Sansa did learn a lot from Cersei and maybe now she is finally ready to outsmart her former teacher This was the first foreshadowing of Sansas plans to cast down Cersei.

And in season 6, we have another foreshadowing of how Sansa will plot against Cersei in the end, When Arya is in Braavos, she watches a Bravossi Theather play telling the events that happened in Westeros. In that storyline, the actress that plays Sansa hires a faceless man to kill the actress who plays Cersei, Lady Crane. I believe this was another foreshadowing of the events that will happen in season 8. Its Sansa who is taking Cersei down. The little dove will prove to the queen that she learned all her lessons. But I believe Jon Snow will be the one killing Cersei.

&amp;nbsp;

**EPISODE 5 WILL BE THE DANCE OF DRAGONS;**

&amp;nbsp;


&gt;He was no dragon, Dany thought, curiously calm. **Fire cannot kill a dragon.**

&gt;(A Game of Thrones - Daenerys V)

&amp;nbsp;

Well I believe thats exactly whats its gonna happen. In order to defeat Daenerys you have to kill her last dragon, Drogon, which we know will be flying over Kings Landing in the end of this story. Thats how the wildfire comes in. I actually think Jon and the Lannisters may set a trap for Dany and use the wildfire to kill the dragon and Daenerys remain armies. Maybe Bran was behind King Aerys decision to cover KL with wildfire, already preparing to use against Daenerys in the finall battle for the Throne. if we rewatch season 5 episode 7 we had a little hint about this idea.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;DAARIO: On the day of the Great Games, gather all the great masters, and wise masters, and worthy masters you can find, and slaughter them all.

&gt;DAENERYS: I am a queen. Not a butcher.

&gt;DAARIO: All rulers are either butchers or meat.

&amp;nbsp;


Remember that Brans first chapter he is forced to watch his father doing the Kingss justice and Ned explains to him that the man who passes the sentence, must swing the sword. This is one of the most important themes in the story.

Also, in season 4 episode 2, we have Bran having a vision of the events that will happen for the first time. This is THE vision where he sees the dragon flying over KL. After the vision he tells Jojen and Meera: **I know where we have to go**. The show then cuts to a scene in Kings Landing.

So, I do believe Bran will be involved with the explosion of Kings Landing and using the wildfire as a last weapon to defeat Daenerys and her last dragon. Thats the only way Westeros will ever be free of the Targaryens.

BTW, gathering all your enemies in a closed space and destroying them with fire has been used by both mad queens, Cersei and Daenerys, so maybe now we will see the Starks using this idea to finally get rid of Daenerys, her armies and her dragon. 



&amp;nbsp;
_______________________________________

**THE FUTURE OF HOUSE LANNISTER**

&amp;nbsp;

No, House Lannister will not fall into nothing like the Targaryens. The House will be saved by Jaime Lannister, who will marry Brienne of Tarth and restore his family and legacy.

&amp;nbsp;


**JAIME LANNISTER ITS GOING TO BE THE FINAL HAND AND ITS GOING TO END THIS STORY AS A GREAT HERO;** 

Jaime Lannister will choose Jon Snow, this will be the turning point for Jaime and the choice that will change his legacy. There is some very good foreshadowing in the books that hint to us that Jaime will side with Jon Snow in the final battle and help him to defeat Daenerys and her dragons. 

I believe it will be Jaime who will kill Daenerys last dragon, Drogon, and becoming famous as a DRAGONSLAYER; Jaime Lannister will have a big role in the final part of this story, not only helping defeat the ARMY OF THE DEAD, but also defeating  Daenerys Targaryen and saving the Kingdom once again from a tyrannical Targaryen; only this time he will finally receive the thank you, from the people of Westeros; 

Jaime will be greeted as a hero and will end this story beloved and admired by the people. I believe at some point in season 8 Jaime will die and will be brought back to life, his character was written as a mirror to Jon Snow and Jon died on season 5, so this storyline may be possible. 

Jaime will be the Hand of the King for Jon Snow (there is a lot of foreshadowing for this, in both books and tv show) and he will be able to finish his history in the white book as a hero. He will go down in history as one of the greatest Hands in the history of the 7 kingdoms. Jaime will be the last Lannister left on Westeros. 


&amp;nbsp;


**TYRION WILL BE SENT INTO EXILE;**

&amp;nbsp;

Tyrion its one of the characters that will have a very tragic ending. He was the fool who brought Daenerys to Westeros believing he could control her, the same mistake his sister Cersei tried to do with Joffrey. He invited Jon Snow under false premises to Dragonstone without mentioning to Jon about Daenerys demands to bend the knee. 

He made a deal with Cersei that was never disclosed to the audience and I believe he may be behind Sansas kidnapping story in season 8. He keeps making one mistake after the other, always believing to be smarter than the people around him, always under estimating the players of the game. 

But I dont believe he will die. In the House videos released for season 8, they had the Lannisters brothers, Jaime and Tyrion, saying goodbye to each other and I believe we will see them say good bye one last time. I think Tyrion will be sent into exile to Essos, and banned from returning to Westeros.


&amp;nbsp;


**CERSEI WILL DIE;**

&amp;nbsp;

There has been a lot of foreshadowing about Cersei death and its one of the events many believe it happen for sure. The show made sure to write us a scene when her ending is predicted. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think youre safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth. And you will know the debt is paid.

&gt;(Tyrion - SEASON 2 EPISODE 8)

&amp;nbsp;


This episode was written by George RRMartin himself, so, I always assumed this was Cersei Lannister ending Then in season 7, we had Jon Snow threatening to kill Littlefinger is he ever touched Sansa. In that scene we have Jon Snow choking Baelish with his cold hands and I believe this scene could be a foreshadow of Jon finally killing Cersei, for trying to hurt Sansa in season 8. The prophecy says that Cersei will be killed by the little brother and Jon Snow fits that role as the younger son of Rheagar Targaryen.


&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**THEON WILL BE KING OF THE IRON ISLANDS;**

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;He lifted his head to look at her. ""Catelyn,"" he said. His voice was distant and formal. **""Where are the children?""**

&gt;A Game of Thrones - Catelyn I

&amp;nbsp;

I believe the children of Wintefell were always meant to be the heroes of this story. Thats why George made sure to have a Greyjoy, a Targaryen be raised close to the Stark children. Those children now are gonna be the rulers of Westeros and they will be the ones passing Ned Stark legacy forward, building a new and better world.


Thast why I believe Theon will kill Euron Greyjoy and be the king of the Iron Islands; Theon probably has a bastard child with the captains daughter he met in season 2 on his journey to Pike, he will recognize the child and raise them as his heir;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**A TIME FOR WOLVES;**

&amp;nbsp;


It will be a Time for Wolves; a new period for Westeros. Jon will rule surrounded by Starks, carrying the Stark name with Sansa and Bran by his side; The capital will probably be transferred to HighGarden, not only the castle it is still intact but its also located in the most fertile area of Westeros. It seems like a very interesting political decision. Again, I found a lot of foreshadowing for this in the books.

Jon Snow will rule over a graveyard, as he predicted in season 7. But the ending will be very sweet, with kids playing around in gardens and celebrating. We will see Jon, the Stark kids, Jaime and Brienne, Sam and Guilly, Theon.. ect all enjoying spring and celebrating their happy ending. 


&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


**THE VERY LAST SCENE OF THE STORY..**

&amp;nbsp;


Daniel Abraham is the man responsible for converting the Game of Thrones book into a comic, mentioned that there is a particular line of dialog in the game of thrones book, which is very important for the last scene of ""A Dream of Spring"". 

&gt;**Have you collaborated at all with George R.R. Martin in the process of adapting the novel to comics? If so, whats the creative process there?**


&gt;Daniel: ""Ive spoken to George a lot in the process.  The biggest issues we have are continuity questions.  There are things about this story that only he knows, and they arent all obvious.  **There was one scene I had to rework because theres a particular line of dialog**  and you wouldnt know it to look at  **thats important in the last scene of A Dream of Spring.**-  Daniel Abraham

&amp;nbsp;

On episode 1, when King Robert goes to visit Winterfell, he and Ned go down in the crypts to pay their respects to Lyanna Stark, the wolf girl he lost to Rheagar Targeryen. In that scene, the dialogue is different from what we have in the books.

&amp;nbsp;


&gt;ROBERT: Did you have to bury her in a place like this? She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her. 

&gt;NED: She was my sister. **This is where she belongs.**

&amp;nbsp;
 
In the books, this conversation is different:

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;""Ah, damn it, Ned, did you have to bury her in a place like this?"" His voice was hoarse with remembered grief. ""She deserved more than darkness ""

&gt;**""She was a Stark of Winterfell,**"" Ned said quietly. **""This is her place.""**

&gt;A Game of Thrones - Eddard I

&amp;nbsp;

I think this is the scene. I believe we will end this story with King Jon visiting his late wife Sansa Stark in the crypts of Winterfell and someone will ask him why did he buried her there, why not building a monument for her, so that she could be on display and thats how he will reply:

&gt;She was a Stark of Winterfell, this is where she belongs.

&amp;nbsp;

What made me believe this, were two momments of the story: 
First of all, Ladys death. After Sansa direwolf is killed on her way to the south, Ned Stark makes sure to send a group of men back to the North and Winterfell, so that she can be buried in Northerner soil. Lady represented a little bit of Sansa, who died on that day and I dont think it was a silly detail George rrmartin make sure that her direwolf body was buried on Winterfell, I think that this scene, was much more important than most people think about it.


&amp;nbsp;


&gt;When it was over, he said, Choose four men and have them take the body north. Bury her at Winterfell.

&gt;All that way? Jory said, astonished.All that way, Ned affirmed. The Lannister woman shall never have this skin.

&gt;A Game of Thrones - Eddard III

&amp;nbsp;

Another momment in the story was Ygritte death. In both books and show, Jon Snow takes her body and goes to bury her up North, where she belonged.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Tormund: Did you love her? She loved you. 

&gt;Jon: She told you? 

&gt;Tormund: No. All she ever talked about was killing you. Thats how I know. **She belongs in the North**. The real North. You understand me? 

&amp;nbsp;



Look at the excuse Tormund gives Jon to why Ygritte needs to be buried North of the Wall, its the same Ned Stark used to explain to King Robert why Lyanna had to be buried in the Crypts of Winterfell. **Because thats where she belongs.**

I also believe this ending could bring the story to a full circle, because there is also the theme of the audience never really thinking as Sansa as a TRUE STARK. There is still the notion that Sansa is not really a Stark like Jon or Arya. 

Sansa Starkiness was always a topic of contention among fans of the books and series. Many like to refer to Sansa as Lady Lannister or Lady Bolton, so to have Sansa finally resting in the Winterfell crypts, by the end of this story, as a Stark, would be a very satisfying ending. Her hair maybe red and some of her manners may be more southern like, but Sansa IS A STARK. 

And in fact, she is the Stark who took back the North and Winterfell, she is the Stark who made possible for the family to reunite and be safe; she is the Stark who stood by Jon side when he was made King in the North and supported his claim; she was the Stark who prepared the North for the wars and the winter and she will be the Stark who will rule the 7 Kingdoms together with her husband. 

&amp;nbsp;

Both Jon and Sansa are foreshadowed to live very long lives and I expect their ruling period to last decades. They will be the ones restoring and rebuilding the kingdom after the wars of Ice and Fire. But I do believe Jon will live longer based on a quote from the books. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Tyrion shared around his skin of wine until even Yoren grew mellow. **One by one the company drifted off to their shelters and to sleep, all but Jon Snow, who had drawn the nights first watch.** Tyrion was the last to retire, as always. As he stepped into the shelter his men had built for him, he paused and looked back at Jon Snow. The boy stood near the fire, his face still and hard, looking deep into the flames. Tyrion Lannister smiled sadly and went to bed. - 

&gt;AGOT Tyrion II

&amp;nbsp;

And because of this line, I believe Jon Snow ill be the last one to die, he will live a very long life and will be forced to see all the ones he loved pass away, one by one. 









&amp;nbsp;

Then later in the story, we have another Stark man, making sure to bury a Northerner where she belongs.. In season 5, we will have Jon Snow, going North of the wall to burn Ygrittes body, after her death in the Battle of the Wall. Because THATS WHERE SHE BELONGED. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Tormund: Did you love her? She loved you. 

&gt;Jon: She told you? 

&gt;Tormund: No. All she ever talked about was killing you. Thats how I know. **She belongs in the North. The real North. You understand me?** 

&amp;nbsp;

Look at the excuse Tormund gives Jon to why Ygritte needs to be buried North of the Wall, its the same Ned Stark used to explain to King Robert why Lyanna had to be buried in the Crypts of Winterfell. Because thats where she belongs.

&amp;nbsp;

I also believe this ending could bring the story to a full circle, because there is also the theme of the audience never really thinking as Sansa as a TRUE STARK. Sansa Starkiness was always a topic of contention among fans of the books and series. Many like to refer to Sansa as Lady Lannister or Lady Bolton, so to have Sansa finally resting in the Winterfell crypts, by the end of this story, as a Stark, would be a very satisfying ending. Her hair maybe red and some of her manners may be more southern like, but Sansa IS A STARK. 

&amp;nbsp;

And in fact, she is the Stark who took back the North and Winterfell, she is the Stark who made possible for the family to reunite and be safe; she is the Stark who stood by Jon side when he was made King in the North and supported his claim; she was the Stark who prepared the North for the wars and the winter and she will be the Stark who will rule the 7 Kingdoms together with her husband. She was always, a Stark of Winterfell. 

&amp;nbsp;

BTW - I do want to make sure to express in this post, that I believe this scene would be in a far far away future scene, Both Jon and Sansa are foreshadowed to have long lives  and I expect their ruling period to be veryyyy long. They will be the ones restoring and rebuilding the realm after the wars of Ice and Fire. But I do believe Jon will live longer based on a quote from the books. 

&amp;nbsp;


&gt;Tyrion shared around his skin of wine until even Yoren grew mellow. **One by one the company drifted off to their shelters and to sleep, all but Jon Snow, who had drawn the nights first watch.** Tyrion was the last to retire, as always. As he stepped into the shelter his men had built for him, he paused and looked back at Jon Snow. The boy stood near the fire, his face still and hard, looking deep into the flames. Tyrion Lannister smiled sadly and went to bed. 

A GAME OF THRONES - Tyrion II

&amp;nbsp;

So, this was always the book scene that made me believe Jon will be the last one to die.

**JON SNOW AND SANSA STARK MARRIAGE**

&amp;nbsp;

Jon Snow and Sansa Stark will be the final King and Queen of the 7 Kingdoms. Their romance has been foreshadow pretty much since book 1 and season 1 and their marriage will bring peace and prosperity to Westeros. The wars of Ice and Fire will destroy the kingdom and they will be the ones rebuilding the realm to its former glory; Jon and Sansa storyline are in a perfect parallel and they have been groomed to be king and queen of Westeros for the whole storyline in the books. 

&amp;nbsp;
____________________________________________

&amp;nbsp;

**JON SNOW HAS ALWAYS LOVED SANSA STARK;**

&amp;nbsp;


Jon Snow has always been in love with his cousin Sansa Stark, which is why he decided to go to the wall after Ned Stark accepted Sansas engagement  to Joffrey Baratheon.  Jon was written as a mirror to Jaime Lannister and one of the reasons Jaime decided to join the kingsguard was because he could never marry his sister and lover Cersei. Once the secret of Lyanna and Rheagar is finally out, Jon and Sansa will be free to be together. Their love story is the main romance of the books. 

BTW, dont be surprised if they reveal the romance between Jon and Sansa in the end of the first episode of season 8. The episode will start mirroring the pilot episode, when King Robert arrived at Winterfell with his Lannister family and we all know the episode ended with the reveal of Cersei and Jaime incestual romance. 

&amp;nbsp;
___________________________________

&amp;nbsp;

**JON SNOW IS GOING TO BE A STARK;**

&amp;nbsp;

Jon Snow is going to take Sansa Stark name and pass the Stark name to all his children. He will be finally be a Stark and die as a true son by law of Eddard Stark, just like he always dreamed of in the books. This was foreshadowed in season 6 episode 5, when Sansa cloaked Jon Snow with a Stark Cloak.

&amp;nbsp;

__________________________________

&amp;nbsp;

**JON WILL FATHER A BASTARD**

&amp;nbsp;

Jon Snow will father a bastard. He will have trueborn sons with his wife Sansa Stark, but he will have a bastard girl with Daenerys. The books have foreshadowed this event to death. Jon and Sansa will pass this bastard girl as their own trueborn child and give her their Stark name. Sansa will raise this child as her own daughter and make her a Stark. Thats why the show wrote that scene with Catelyn Stark and Talissa on season 3 where Catelyn says that she failed to love and care for her husband bastard child, Sansa will do the opposite and love and care for Jons bastard daughter. 

Jon will do the inverse of his uncle Ned, who lied and raised his trueborn nephew as a bastard.  The story of Game of Thrones started with Ned Stark starting a war to prevent a bastard son of Cersei Lannister to sit in the Throne and it will end with a bastard daughter of Jon Snow as the heir of the Throne. History repeat itself and in the end, there wont be much difference between Starks and Lannister, they all lie to protect the ones they love. 

*The things we do for love* will still be the theme of the story in the end.

&amp;nbsp;

____________________________________

&amp;nbsp;

**THIS IS A STORY OF FATHERS DAUGHTERS.**

&amp;nbsp;


A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE its many tales in one; this is a tale of a Dragon prince madly in love with a Wolf girl; this is also a tale about home and families; about the things we do for love; its a story about tyranny and fear; its also a story about slow learners, who make several mistakes, but that eventually do learn, but ALSO, A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE, is a story about fathers daughters. 

And thats exactly what Arya, Sansa, Cersei, Daenerys, Brienne all are. These women are their fathers daughters. Thats why the show gave so much importance on those characters fathers and hardly touched the mothers relevance.

No one thought Sansa and Daenerys had much of their fathers in themselves, those two characters were always associated with their mothers, yet they will prove to all of us that they carry much of Eddar and Aerys inside of them, in the last part of this story. 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**THE STARK SISTERS WILL GET EVERYTHING THEY EVER WANTED**

&amp;nbsp;


&gt;Arya:  We both wanted to be the other people when we were younger. **You wanted to be a queen and sit next to a handsome, young king on the Iron Throne. I wanted to be a knight, to pick up a sword like father and go off to battle.** Neither of us got to be that other person, did we? The world doesnt just let girls decide what they are going to be.

&gt;(SEASON 7 EPISODE 6)

&amp;nbsp;


**AND THEY ARE GOING TO BE QUEENS.**

Yes, we will have two queens. Game of Thrones started with two queens. Daenerys and Cersei; one a conqueror, the second a consort queen. Two women, whose obsession for the Iron Throne, left a trail of death and destruction on Essos and Westeros. So, we will finish this story with two queens, who will restore the Kingdom and improve the lives of their people. Sansa will be the consort queen of Jon Snow and Arya will be the warrior, the conquering queen that will lead the armies of North, Vale and Riverlands into war in season 8.

&amp;nbsp;

**SANSA STARK WILL BE THE QUEEN;**

&amp;nbsp;

Queen Sansa Stark will change the Law of Succession allowing girls to be heirs in front of their younger brothers. Sansa its the YMBQ of the prophecy and she will be the one casting Cersei Lannister down; Sansa will be very political active queen, changing laws and improving the lives of the people of Westeros and making important changes in the realm; She will be loved by her people and called THE QUEEN.

Sansa was always meant to be the final queen and the one who will rebuild the kingdom after the wars. Sansa entire storyline in the books was about observing the major players of the game make their moves and see the ramifications of those decisions. In Kings Landing, Sansa saw it first hand how ruling can affect the lives of the people in Westeros. She was able to see what to do, when in power, but also, what NOT to do as a king or queen. She learned a lot from Cersei, Margaery, Ollena, the Tyrells, The Lannisters, Littlefinger and will use this education for good use as a queen. 


All Sansas dreams will come true and she will be a living proof that life is a song. She will marry her brave and gentle hero; she will have children and rebuild her family and she will be a very beloved queen, admired for her beauty and kindness. 

&amp;nbsp;

**ARYA WILL BE THE QUEEN IN THE NORTH;**

&amp;nbsp;

Arys Stark will rule the North as a Regent Queen. Arya storyline in season 8 will be a copy of Papa Ned in the first Rebellion against the Mad King. She will call the banners and lead the North armies into battle in the final war of this story. George RRMartin himself said that she would conquer the world in the final part of this tale. 

&amp;nbsp;

**ARYA WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT IN THE FINAL SEASON !!!!!**

&amp;nbsp;


Arya is season 8 will be a huge warrior, with the help of Nymeria and their pack of wolves, she is going to lead their armies into battle, defeating Daenerys armies in combat (yes, the Dothraki bitches!!!!!!) They will probably meet in the Riverlands, where Rheagar and Robert had their first and final confrontation. She will be the one who will kill the mountain, avenging the people that he cruelly killed in the Riverlands and the Hound. Just like papa Ned became famous for killing Ser Arthur Dane, Arya will be legendary for killing the Mountain. 
They will write songs about her for years and years to come

&amp;nbsp;

___________________________________

&amp;nbsp;

**BRAN STARK WILL BE THE MAGICAL FORCE TO STOP THE ARMY OF THE DEAD**

&amp;nbsp;

I know the audience expects Daenerys and her dragons to be the magical force used to stop the Army of the Dead, but, dont be shocked if she decides to abandon the cause in the middle of the fight and leave the North before the big battle against the Night King. There is a lot of Stannis in Daenerys character arc on season 7 and in the end, Stannis left Jon and the Nights Watch on their own to fight the Night King on Hardhome, and went to march to Winterfell to fight the Boltons. Stannis could never let it go completely of the Iron Throne and I expect Dany to do the same. 

Its Bran Stark, who has been preparing himself to face this threat since the beginning of this story. Its Bran Stark who has been foreshadowed by the books and tv show to be the one who will matter the most in the end. Not the dragons. I suspect we will see the ghosts of the Kings of Winter, coming out from the crypts of Winterfell, to fight the final battle against the Army of the Dead.

&amp;nbsp;


&gt;Bran: What else have you seen it?
&gt;Jojen: The ONLY think that matters. **YOU**.

&gt;(Season 3 Episode 2)

&amp;nbsp;

Also, in the first Long Night, there was no Targaryens; The North was left to fight on its own with the help of the Children of the Forest and George likes to repeat his stories very closely to the original. Defeating the Army of the Dead wont be Bran only job in season 8, he has also been written as a foil to Daenerys, so I believe he will be involved on her final defeat. 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**DAENERYS WILL BE THE FINAL ANTAGONIST IN SEASON 8 AND WE WILL HAVE A SECOND DANCE OF DRAGONS BETWEEN JON AND DANY**

&amp;nbsp;


&gt;Jon Snow: They will see it you for **what you are**.

&gt;(SEASON 7 EPISODE 6)

&amp;nbsp;

In the beginning of this story we saw Sansa Stark falling madly in love with a beautiful prince, only to have her heart broken in a million of pieces in the end of season 1, when Joffrey shocked her by cutting her fathers head, finally showing how cruel and monstrous he really was. In the beginning of the series, we also had the audience falling madly in love with the beautiful Daenerys Targaryen, believing she was the hero of this story and just like Sansa, the audience will be shocked by Daenerys actions in season 8 and they will have their hearts completely broken in a million of pieces. Daenerys will finally show to the audience the monster that she really is. I expect to see a lot of shades of Joffrey on Daenerys in season 8. Remember, Joffrey believed his whole life he was the true heir of the Iron Throne, until a Stark man showed up in his life, telling him that this was a lie. This is exactely what is going to happen to Daenerys in season 8.

Remember when Sansa Stark fell madly in love with a monster and trusted a beautiful queen blindly when she was warned against it? You are all Sansas, you just dont know yet.

Daenerys could  never be the villain of her own story. Thats why it was always necessary for her to create a lie that painted her as the hero. She invaded Astapor to save the Unsulied from the evil wise masters; she conquered Meereen to pay back the slavers for crucifying the children slaves; she destroyed the sacred temple of Vaes Dothrak and killed all the Khalls, but she did for the Dothraki widows who didnt wish to stay in the  Dosh khaleen. Now in Westeros she had no more excuses, there is no slavery or evil masters torturing young boys in the 7 Kingdoms, so she was forced to create a new excuse to defend her invasion of Westeros. 


So, she told the audience that she wants to break the wheel of power that crushes the poor and the weak on Westeros. It makes no sense of course. She wants to break the wheel, by building a new wheel, this time, with only her family on top, crushing those under her. This is a phony ridiculous excuse and its supposed to be ridiculous. Its a silly lie, all Daenerys wants in the Iron Throne, but she cant admit it afraid it will make her look bad, so she created this silly little lie and the audience (just like Sansa fell into Cersei silly lies in season 1) fell right into. What Dany really wants is install an absolute monarchy, with only HER in power. 

Daenerys is a false prophet, who invented a sacred mission to convince her people and those who follow her of her good intentions, yet all her actions are motivated from the desire to take The Iron Throne, thats the one thing who truly matters for Daenerys and now in season 8, when her claim to the Throne will be contested by the bombastic news of Jon Snow stronger claim to the Throne. Thats whe she will finally show to the audience who she really is.


&amp;nbsp;


**WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE BLINDLY FOLLOW, GOD AND HEROS;**

&amp;nbsp;

By writing Daenerys Targaryen, George RRMartin wanted to show us how dictators and cult leaders are created. They started magical and inspiring, making beautiful speeches and promising great things, but in end, most of them are motivated by selfish desires and allow power to corrupt them. 
Daenerys story is also a warning about following leaders without questioning their motivations or decisions.  Daenerys is adored as a goddess by her followers and never has her decision questioned by them. Unlike Jon Snow who is always questioned by Sansa, The North Lords and the Wildlings about his decisions. The Dothraki and the Unsullied just blindly follow Daenerys around, like children following their mothers, never questioning her real motives, or even contemplating if the move to Westeros has actually any benefits for them. And as we are about to see in season 8, following leaders blindly can be a very dangerous thing because it can lead us to our graves. 
The audience, the Dothraki and the Unsullied never thought that their hero could just simply be  lying to themNo matter how much destruction and death she causes, her followers and advisers keep believing in her, defending her decisions, turning a blind eye to her questionable actions, finding excuses to her terrible acts. They know that she can be impulsive and dangerous but believe that in the end she is motivated by great ideals and will always listen to her advisers.. 

Daenerys first instinct is always destruction and violence, but most of the time, she is restrained by her advisers. **But the rope that holds her together is about to be ripped apart in season 8.**

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Daario Naharis: I pity the Lords of Westeros, they have no idea what is coming for them

&gt;(SEASON 6 EPISODE 10)

&amp;nbsp;

Daenerys was always meant to be the final antagonist of the story, her time in Essos was not about learning to be a good queen, she was learning to be a ruthless conqueror, which she learned very well. Dont be surprised if she marries Euron Greyjoy, they marriage has been foreshadowed on books and tv show. Daenerys its gonna shock the audience, she is going to behave in a way that will surprise a lot of people. 

Jon and Daenerys  relationship will mirror Rhaenyra and Aegon tragic battle for the Throne; This will be the final battle on episode 5, the fight for the Throne has always been the main focus of the story and this battle its what is going to put an end to this tale. Westeros will finally be united against the common enemy, which is Daenerys and her dragons. 

The Army of the Dead and the Night King were always a red herring, its was always Daenerys and her dragons the major threat for Westeros. I believe that more than half of the population of Westeros will perish during the final wars; many who survive the war will latter die during the winter without the food that was destroyed by Daenerys dragons in the Field of Fire 2.0; in her short period in  Westeros, Daenerys will cause a lot of deaths and destruction and she will be remembered as the Queen of Ashes. 

The stallion that mounts the world was never Rhaego. It was always going to be Daenerys. Essos will also be throw into chaos, without Daenerys dragons to impose order, the masters of Astapor, Meereen and the local cities will raise again and the region will probably be engulfed into a civil war. It will probably take centuries for the world to recover from Daenerys reign of terror. 


&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**WINTER WILL COME TO HOUSE TARGARYEN;**

&amp;nbsp;


Daenerys final battle on episode 5, will turn Kings Landing into ashes, but she wont be destroying just the capital of the realm, she will also put an end to House Targaryen. Their dynasty started with the destruction of Harrenhall and will end with the destruction of the capital that The Targaryens themselves build, closing a cycle of tyranny, fear and terror.  Daenerys will be the last dragon. 

&amp;nbsp;


**DRAGONSTONE WILL FAIL;**

&amp;nbsp;


I believe that Dragonstone will be destroyed in the end. The Castle in the remote island serves no purpose for  Westeros. It can not be used for grains production or animal livestock, the only use for Dragonstone in the past centuries was to be used as base for a foreign invasion, the castle will probably be destroyed in the end. Also important, Daenerys spent this entire story threatening to destroy others peoples houses and cities. To have her own ancestral House destroyed in the end would be very fitting to the story.

**WE WILL HAVE A SECOND REBELLION AND A SECOND DANCE OF THE DRAGONS**

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Don't fight in the North. Or the South. Fight every battle, everywhere, always, in your mind. Everyone is your enemy, everyone is your friend... every possible series of events is happening all at once. Live that way and nothing will surprise you, ..**everything that happens will be something that you have seen before.**
 
&gt;(Litllefinger SEASON 7 EPISODE 2)

&amp;nbsp;

Everything that happened in the past will happen again in season 8. Roberts Rebelion will happen again. Sansa will be kidnapped at some point, just like aunt Lyanna Stark; Arya will lead the North armies south to save her sister (just like Ned Stark did in Roberts Rebellion). The Riverlands, the North and the Vale will once again gather forces and go to war. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Stannis: What are you reading?

&gt;Shireen: **""The Dance of Dragons.""**

&gt;Stannis: What's it about? It's the story of the fight between Rhaenyra Targaryen and her half-brother Aegon for control over the Seven Kingdoms. Both of them thought they belonged on the Iron Throne. When people started declaring for one of them or the other, their fight divided the kingdoms in two. **Brothers fought brothers, dragons fought dragons.** By the time it was over, thousands were dead. **And it was a disaster for the Targaryens as well. They never truly recovered.**
 
&gt;(GAME OF THRONES SEASON 5 EPISODE 9)

&amp;nbsp;

We will have a second Dance of Dragons, with the kingdom divided between Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen. The Lannisters will be divided too by this war. Tyrion (the flop) will choose Daenerys side and Jaime will choose Jon Snow and the Starks. This will be the decision that will change Jaime Lannister legacy forever. 

Millions will die, but in the end Jon Snow and his armies will defeat Daenerys and her dragons. This war will not only destroy the realm but finally bring an end to the Targaryen dynasty. This battle will probably happens on episode 5.


&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


**SANSAS PLANS TO CAST DOWN CERSEI**

&amp;nbsp;


Sansa will be kidnapped in season 8, probably by Cersei, but dont be surprised if this kidnapping has a twist. In season 1, in the scene where Cersei and the small council is forcing Sansa to write down a letter to Rob Stark demanding him to bend the knee to King Joffrey., we have Maester Pycelle warning Cersei that Sansa may be so sweet and innocent now, but once she is older, she may hatch some treasons!!!!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;she (Sansa) may be a sweet thing now Your Grace, **but in 10 YEARS, who knows what treasons she may hatch!!!!**
 
&gt;(SEASON 1 EPISODE 8)

&amp;nbsp;


Now, we know that Sansa did learn a lot from Cersei and maybe now she is finally ready to outsmart her former teacher This was the first foreshadowing of Sansas plans to cast down Cersei.

And in season 6, we have another foreshadowing of how Sansa will plot against Cersei in the end, When Arya is in Braavos, she watches a Bravossi Theather play telling the events that happened in Westeros. In that storyline, the actress that plays Sansa hires a faceless man to kill the actress who plays Cersei, Lady Crane. I believe this was another foreshadowing of the events that will happen in season 8. Its Sansa who is taking Cersei down. The little dove will prove to the queen that she learned all her lessons. But I believe Jon Snow will be the one killing Cersei.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**EPISODE 5 WILL BE THE DANCE OF DRAGONS;**

&amp;nbsp;


&gt;He was no dragon, Dany thought, curiously calm. **Fire cannot kill a dragon.**

&gt;(A Game of Thrones - Daenerys V)

&amp;nbsp;

Well I believe thats exactly whats its gonna happen. In order to defeat Daenerys you have to kill her last dragon, Drogon, which we know will be flying over Kings Landing in the end of this story. Thats how the wildfire comes in. I actually think Jon and the Lannisters may set a trap for Dany and use the wildfire to kill the dragon and Daenerys remain armies. Maybe Bran was behind King Aerys decision to cover KL with wildfire, already preparing to use against Daenerys in the finall battle for the Throne. if we rewatch season 5 episode 7 we had a little hint about this idea.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;DAARIO: On the day of the Great Games, gather all the great masters, and wise masters, and worthy masters you can find, and slaughter them all.

&gt;DAENERYS: I am a queen. Not a butcher.

&gt;DAARIO: All rulers are either butchers or meat.

&amp;nbsp;


Remember that Brans first chapter he is forced to watch his father doing the Kingss justice and Ned explains to him that the man who passes the sentence, must swing the sword. This is one of the most important themes in the story.

Also, in season 4 episode 2, we have Bran having a vision of the events that will happen for the first time. This is THE vision where he sees the dragon flying over KL. After the vision he tells Jojen and Meera: **I know where we have to go**. The show then cuts to a scene in Kings Landing.

So, I do believe Bran will be involved with the explosion of Kings Landing and using the wildfire as a last weapon to defeat Daenerys and her last dragon. Thats the only way Westeros will ever be free of the Targaryens.

BTW, gathering all your enemies in a closed space and destroying them with fire has been used by both mad queens, Cersei and Daenerys, so maybe now we will see the Starks using this idea to finally get rid of Daenerys, her armies and her dragon. 



&amp;nbsp;
_______________________________________

**THE FUTURE OF HOUSE LANNISTER**

&amp;nbsp;

No, House Lannister will not fall into nothing like the Targaryens. The House will be saved by Jaime Lannister, who will marry Brienne of Tarth and restore his family and legacy.

&amp;nbsp;


**JAIME LANNISTER ITS GOING TO BE THE FINAL HAND AND ITS GOING TO END THIS STORY AS A GREAT HERO;** 

Jaime Lannister will choose Jon Snow, this will be the turning point for Jaime and the choice that will change his legacy. There is some very good foreshadowing in the books that hint to us that Jaime will side with Jon Snow in the final battle and help him to defeat Daenerys and her dragons. 

I believe it will be Jaime who will kill Daenerys last dragon, Drogon, and becoming famous as a DRAGONSLAYER; Jaime Lannister will have a big role in the final part of this story, not only helping defeat the ARMY OF THE DEAD, but also defeating  Daenerys Targaryen and saving the Kingdom once again from a tyrannical Targaryen; only this time he will finally receive the thank you, from the people of Westeros; 

Jaime will be greeted as a hero and will end this story beloved and admired by the people. I believe at some point in season 8 Jaime will die and will be brought back to life, his character was written as a mirror to Jon Snow and Jon died on season 5, so this storyline may be possible. 

Jaime will be the Hand of the King for Jon Snow (there is a lot of foreshadowing for this, in both books and tv show) and he will be able to finish his history in the white book as a hero. He will go down in history as one of the greatest Hands in the history of the 7 kingdoms. Jaime will be the last Lannister left on Westeros. 


&amp;nbsp;


**TYRION WILL BE SENT INTO EXILE;**

&amp;nbsp;

Tyrion its one of the characters that will have a very tragic ending. He was the fool who brought Daenerys to Westeros believing he could control her, the same mistake his sister Cersei tried to do with Joffrey. He invited Jon Snow under false premises to Dragonstone without mentioning to Jon about Daenerys demands to bend the knee. 

He made a deal with Cersei that was never disclosed to the audience and I believe he may be behind Sansas kidnapping story in season 8. He keeps making one mistake after the other, always believing to be smarter than the people around him, always under estimating the players of the game. 

But I dont believe he will die. In the House videos released for season 8, they had the Lannisters brothers, Jaime and Tyrion, saying goodbye to each other and I believe we will see them say good bye one last time. I think Tyrion will be sent into exile to Essos, and banned from returning to Westeros.


&amp;nbsp;


**CERSEI WILL DIE;**

&amp;nbsp;

There has been a lot of foreshadowing about Cersei death and its one of the events many believe it happen for sure. The show made sure to write us a scene when her ending is predicted. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think youre safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth. And you will know the debt is paid.

&gt;(Tyrion - SEASON 2 EPISODE 8)

&amp;nbsp;


This episode was written by George RRMartin himself, so, I always assumed this was Cersei Lannister ending Then in season 7, we had Jon Snow threatening to kill Littlefinger is he ever touched Sansa. In that scene we have Jon Snow choking Baelish with his cold hands and I believe this scene could be a foreshadow of Jon finally killing Cersei, for trying to hurt Sansa in season 8. The prophecy says that Cersei will be killed by the little brother and Jon Snow fits that role as the younger son of Rheagar Targaryen.


&amp;nbsp;

**THEON WILL BE KING OF THE IRON ISLANDS;**

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;He lifted his head to look at her. ""Catelyn,"" he said. His voice was distant and formal. **""Where are the children?""**

&gt;A Game of Thrones - Catelyn I

&amp;nbsp;

I believe the children of Wintefell were always meant to be the heroes of this story. Thats why George made sure to have a Greyjoy, a Targaryen be raised close to the Stark children. Those children now are gonna be the rulers of Westeros and they will be the ones passing Ned Stark legacy forward, building a new and better world.


Thast why I believe Theon will kill Euron Greyjoy and be the king of the Iron Islands; Theon probably has a bastard child with the captains daughter he met in season 2 on his journey to Pike, he will recognize the child and raise them as his heir;

&amp;nbsp;

**A TIME FOR WOLVES;**

&amp;nbsp;


It will be a Time for Wolves; a new period for Westeros. Jon will rule surrounded by Starks, carrying the Stark name with Sansa and Bran by his side; The capital will probably be transferred to HighGarden, not only the castle it is still intact but its also located in the most fertile area of Westeros. It seems like a very interesting political decision. Again, I found a lot of foreshadowing for this in the books.

Jon Snow will rule over a graveyard, as he predicted in season 7. But the ending will be very sweet, with kids playing around in gardens and celebrating. We will see Jon, the Stark kids, Jaime and Brienne, Sam and Guilly, Theon.. ect all enjoying spring and celebrating their happy ending. 


&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


**THE VERY LAST SCENE OF THE STORY..**

&amp;nbsp;


Daniel Abraham is the man responsible for converting the Game of Thrones book into a comic, mentioned that there is a particular line of dialog in the game of thrones book, which is very important for the last scene of ""A Dream of Spring"". 

&gt;**Have you collaborated at all with George R.R. Martin in the process of adapting the novel to comics? If so, whats the creative process there?**


&gt;Daniel: ""Ive spoken to George a lot in the process.  The biggest issues we have are continuity questions.  There are things about this story that only he knows, and they arent all obvious.  **There was one scene I had to rework because theres a particular line of dialog**  and you wouldnt know it to look at  **thats important in the last scene of A Dream of Spring.**-  Daniel Abraham

&amp;nbsp;

On episode 1, when King Robert goes to visit Winterfell, he and Ned go down in the crypts to pay their respects to Lyanna Stark, the wolf girl he lost to Rheagar Targeryen. In that scene, the dialogue is different from what we have in the books.

&amp;nbsp;


&gt;ROBERT: Did you have to bury her in a place like this? She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her. 

&gt;NED: She was my sister. **This is where she belongs.**

&amp;nbsp;
 
In the books, this conversation is different:

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;""Ah, damn it, Ned, did you have to bury her in a place like this?"" His voice was hoarse with remembered grief. ""She deserved more than darkness ""

&gt;**""She was a Stark of Winterfell,**"" Ned said quietly. **""This is her place.""**

&gt;A Game of Thrones - Eddard I

&amp;nbsp;

I think this is the scene. I believe we will end this story with King Jon visiting his late wife Sansa Stark in the crypts of Winterfell and someone will ask him why did he buried her there, why not building a monument for her, so that she could be on display and thats how he will reply:

&gt;She was a Stark of Winterfell, this is where she belongs.

&amp;nbsp;

What made me believe this, were two momments of the story: 
First of all, Ladys death. After Sansa direwolf is killed on her way to the south, Ned Stark makes sure to send a group of men back to the North and Winterfell, so that she can be buried in Northerner soil. Lady represented a little bit of Sansa, who died on that day and I dont think it was a silly detail George rrmartin make sure that her direwolf body was buried on Winterfell, I think that this scene, was much more important than most people think about it.


&amp;nbsp;


&gt;When it was over, he said, Choose four men and have them take the body north. Bury her at Winterfell.

&gt;All that way? Jory said, astonished.All that way, Ned affirmed. The Lannister woman shall never have this skin.

&gt;A Game of Thrones - Eddard III

&amp;nbsp;

Another momment in the story was Ygritte death. In both books and show, Jon Snow takes her body and goes to bury her up North, where she belonged.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Tormund: Did you love her? She loved you. 

&gt;Jon: She told you? 

&gt;Tormund: No. All she ever talked about was killing you. Thats how I know. **She belongs in the North**. The real North. You understand me? 

&amp;nbsp;



Look at the excuse Tormund gives Jon to why Ygritte needs to be buried North of the Wall, its the same Ned Stark used to explain to King Robert why Lyanna had to be buried in the Crypts of Winterfell. **Because thats where she belongs.**

I also believe this ending could bring the story to a full circle, because there is also the theme of the audience never really thinking as Sansa as a TRUE STARK. There is still the notion that Sansa is not really a Stark like Jon or Arya. 

Sansa Starkiness was always a topic of contention among fans of the books and series. Many like to refer to Sansa as Lady Lannister or Lady Bolton, so to have Sansa finally resting in the Winterfell crypts, by the end of this story, as a Stark, would be a very satisfying ending. Her hair maybe red and some of her manners may be more southern like, but Sansa IS A STARK. 

And in fact, she is the Stark who took back the North and Winterfell, she is the Stark who made possible for the family to reunite and be safe; she is the Stark who stood by Jon side when he was made King in the North and supported his claim; she was the Stark who prepared the North for the wars and the winter and she will be the Stark who will rule the 7 Kingdoms together with her husband. 

&amp;nbsp;

Both Jon and Sansa are foreshadowed to live very long lives and I expect their ruling period to last decades. They will be the ones restoring and rebuilding the kingdom after the wars of Ice and Fire. But I do believe Jon will live longer based on a quote from the books. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Tyrion shared around his skin of wine until even Yoren grew mellow. **One by one the company drifted off to their shelters and to sleep, all but Jon Snow, who had drawn the nights first watch.** Tyrion was the last to retire, as always. As he stepped into the shelter his men had built for him, he paused and looked back at Jon Snow. The boy stood near the fire, his face still and hard, looking deep into the flames. Tyrion Lannister smiled sadly and went to bed. - 

&gt;AGOT Tyrion II

&amp;nbsp;

And because of this line, I believe Jon Snow ill be the last one to die, he will live a very long life and will be forced to see all the ones he loved pass away, one by one. 









&amp;nbsp;

Hi everyone, I wrote this summary of Game of Thrones to help me keep track of whats going on/remember that x is mad at y for something that happened three seasons ago etc.  (Its confusing!!)  Its not a scene by scene recap, but just the essentials of the major plot points.  I havent read the books so this is only based on the show.  Things sometimes get a little out of order as I try to follow certain plot lines.  Im sure I misunderstood things and have stuff wrong, so please feel free to help me out and make corrections!  Spoilers, obviously.  

Lyanna Stark was supposed to marry Robert Baratheon, but a Targaryen kidnaps her.  Robert starts the war to get her back, and takes power.  Lyanna dies anyway.  Targaryen rapes Lyanna, resulting in Jon Snow Targaryen.  (Or so we believe!). Actually Lyanna willingly married Rhaegar.  

Robert Baratheon names Ned Hand of the King. The Starks go to King's Landing.  Robert dies.  Ned finds out Jamie and Cersei are incestuous and Joffrey isnt a rightful king.  Before the season starts Cersei poisoned the last hand of the king, Jon Arryn, probably because he figured out Cersei and Jaime were sleeping together.  (or were Little Finger and Lysa Arryn behind Jon Arryns death?)  Cersei has Ned killed, even though he admitted treason to protect the girls! wtf

Arya flees Kings Landing pretending to be a boy headed for the Nights watch.  She gets together with The Hound, who plans to return her to Robb.  When they finally get to the Red Wedding and everyone is killed, the Hound takes her Eyrie, but Aunt Lysa is already dead too.  They eventually run into Brienne and Podrick.  Brienne almost kills the Hound and Arya sets off on her own for Braavos.

Catelyn thinks Tyrion tried to kill Bran (cause his knife) so she sent him to her crazy sister Lysa, but Bronn saves him from the Moon door.

Robb becomes a pretty good military leader and the Northerners decide he should be king.  Robb captures Jaime, but Catelyn secretly sets him free in exchange for Arya and Sansa.  She sends Brienne with him.  Jaime and Brienne are captured by the Boltons, who cut off Jaimes hand.

Robb marries Talisa and impregnates her, breaking the contract to marry a Frey.  To make up for this, Catelyns brother is going to marry a Frey daughter.  But at the wedding Roose Bolton and Freys people kill the Starks and Tullys.  Red Wedding was actually Tywins plan (but I dont really know why).  

The Targaryens used to be in charge, but they were crazy (too much in breeding) and were overthrown when Jaime kills Mad King Aerys Targaryen.  Daenerys hatches some dragon eggs and starts amassing an army so she can reclaim  power. 

At the Stark/Lannister battle Tyrion meets Shae and brings her to Kings Landing disguised as Sansas handmaid, then tries to send her away for her own safety.

Stannis thinks he should be king because hes actually a Baratheon, unlike Joffrey or Tommen.  Melisandre thinks hes, like, God chosen to rule.  (someone reincarnated?)  Renly Baratheon also thinks he should be king.  Smoke Stannis kills Renly, Catelyn and Brienne flee.

Stannis attacks King's Landing and Tywin Lannister wins (allied with the Tyrells), so Joffrey stays on the throne.  Tyrion helps in defending Kings Landing, and Podrick saves Tyrions life.  (Cersei? tried to have him killed).   House Arryn and House Martell remain neutral.  

Theon Greyjoy was raised by the Starks because his father (Balon) rebelled against the throne, was defeated, and was allowed to keep ruling the Iron Islands if he gave Theon to the Starks as a hostage/ward).  He goes back to the Iron Islands and tries to get dads approval.  He takes over Winterfell and fake kills Bran and Rickon.  Hes captured and tortured by Ramsay Snow/Bolton.

Oberyn Martell comes as a guest for Joffrey's wedding, but really wants revenge because his sister Elia was killed.  (The Mountain raped and killed his sister and her children).

Margaery Tyrell marries Joffrey, and her grandmother, Olenna, (with Baelishs help) poisons him.  Purple wedding.  Tyrion is accused of killing Joffrey, and choses trial by combat.  Both the Mountain (kinda) and Oberyn Martell are killed.  Sansa is forced to marry Tyrion (keeping her as a good Stark hostage), who is a good guy about it, but escapes without him when it becomes clear that hes going to be executed. Baelish smuggles Sansa out because hes in love with Catelyn.   Baelish marries and kills Lysa Arryn, and takes control of the Vale.

Jaime and Varys help Tyrion escape.  On his way out of town Tyrion finds Shae sleeping with Tywin and kills them both.  

Melisandre gets Gendrys blood (aka King Roberts blood) via leeches and puts them in the fire to make a spell to kill Robb Stark, Balon and Joffrey.  Robb, Balon and Joffrey are shown to be false kings.  Ser Davos sets Gendry free so Stannis doesnt kill him.  Melisandre convinces Stannis to head to the wall to fight off white walkers.

Bran and co. head toward the wall looking for the three eyed raven and to meet up with Jon.  They split up- Osha and Rickon heading toward Greatjon Umber.  The rest keep looking for the crow beyond the wall.  Jojen gets killed, and the Children of the Forest save Bran, Meera and Hodor.  He sees the crow in a weirwod tree and is promised hell fly.

The Brothers encounter Crasters keep.  Craster is killed and Gilly goes to live with Sam.  Sam kills a white walker with dragonglass.  Crasters baby gets turned into a White Walker. 

Jon Snow goes off to kill some wildlings who are threatening the wall.  Hes captured, kills Qhorin halfhand pretending to be a defector, gains the trust of the wildlings, and bones Ygritte.  Jon abandons the wildlings (and Ygritte) and escapes to Castle Black.  The wildlings attack Castle Black, Ygritte is killed.  Jon goes to make a deal with Mance Rayder, but suddenly Stannis shows up!

Daenerys keeps building her army and council.  Mormont, Barristan Selmy and Daario help.  She captures Yunkai and Meereen and frees the slaves.  Drogon takes off, and the other two dragons are chained up because theyre burninating the peasants.  

The Kingdom, run by the Lannisters, is in major debt and the war has left commoners impoverished and disgruntled.  Margaery marries Tommen.  Cersei doesnt like Margary and uses the Faith Militant to get her brother arrested for gay sex.  Margaery is arrested for lying under oath and Cersei is arrested for adultery and murdering Robert Baratheon.

Tyrion and Varys head to Meereen to help put Khaleesi in charge of Westeros.  Mormont kidnaps Tyrion also going to Meereen to try to get back on Khaleesis good side.

The Boltons hold Winterfell.  Littlefinger arranges for Sansa to marry Ramsay.  Sansa is hoping Stanis will take back Winterfell and make her warden of the North. Ramsay beats Sansa and locks her up.  Stannis is getting ready to attack winterfell and Melisandre says she prophesied that he will win, but sacrifices his daughter to help ensure his victory.   Half of Stannis army desserts, and Melisandre flees to Castle Black.  Theon and Sansa eventually  escape during the battle between Stanis and the Boltons.  Brienne kills Stannis because he killed Renly.

Myrcella was betrothed to Trystane Martell to keep House Martell neutral, and Oberyn gets a seat at the small council.  Jamie and Bronn go to Dorne to rescue Myrcella.  Ellaria talks the Sand Snakes into avenging Oberyns death.  They fight and they all get locked up.  Doran Martell learns that Ellaria sent a threatening message to Cersei and allows Jaime to take Myrcella back, as long as Trystane can also go back to serve on the small council.  Ellaria poisons Myrcella as they leave.  Ellaria kills Doran, and the Sand Snakes kill Trystane.

Aryas training to be a faceless man.  She kills Trant (who liked sex with girls), but because that was not her life to take, she is struck blind, learns to live and fight blind, then gets her sight back.  She doesnt follow instructions to kill the actress and Jaqen orders her killed.

Tormund and Jon go North of the Wall to talk the wildlings into allying with the Nights Watch against the White Walkers in exchange for being allowed to settle south of the wall, but the White Walkers show up and everyone is zombied.  Some of the Nights Watch are mad because Jon invited the wildlings in, so they kill him.  The wildlings and other Nights Watch fight back and the mutineers surrender. Melisandre raises Jon from the dead, he hangs Alliser and the other mutineers, and gives command of Castle Black to Edd.

Daenerys tries to deal with the Sons of the Harpy and keep peace in Meereen.  She gets the leaders of the great families of Meereen together and feeds one to her dragons.  She marries Hizdahr and reopens the fighting pits.  Jorah and Tyrion are sold to a slave trader to be a fighter, and are taken to Meereen.  Daenerys hired Tyrion as an advisor.  In the middle of fighting in the Great Games, Jorah saves Daenerys from the Sons of the Harpy.  The sons of the Harpy attack, and Hizdahr is killed.  Drogon shows up, and Dany rides him out to the middle of nowhere.  Dany encounters some Dothraki , and burns some of their leaders.  Daario and Jorah are there too, and Dany sends Jorah off to cure his greyscale.  

Tyrion, Missandei and Grey Worm are ruling Meereen, with Varys spies to help.  They note that Daenerys is accumulating enemies and her ships were burned and they cant sail to Westeros.  Astapor and Yunkai have been retaken by the masters.  The slaves masters of Astapor, Yunkai and Volantis are financing the Sons of the Harpy.

Cersei atones for her sins and is allowed to return to the Red Keep.  The Mountain is Frankensteined.  Margary and Tommen form an alliance with the Faith Militant.  Tommen removes Jaime from Kingsguard and orders him to help Walder Frey retake Riverrun from the Blackfish.

Roose Bolton is mad that Ramsay lost Sansa, as she would have helped get Northern allegiance.  Ramsay kills his father, stepmother and new brother, which could have threatened his inheritance.  Sansa and Theon escape.  Smalljon Umber makes an alliance with Ramsay, fearing the Wildlings will head south.  Umber gives Ramsay Rickon and Osha.  Ramsay kills Osha.

Sansa meets up with Brienne, and they eventually get to Castle Black.  Baelish tells her Brynden Tully is getting an army together at Riverrun and offers to help take back the North, but Sansa declines his help.

Theon goes to the Iron Islands and advocates for his sister to rule.  The Northern armies are winning against the Greyjoys, but Balon wants to continue trying to invade the North.  His brother Euron throws Balon off a bridge.  Yara and Theon flee.

Bran is warging back in time.  During Roberts Rebellion Young Eddard and Howland Reed kill Dayne, who was guarding the Tower of Joy.  His presence in Winterfell causes Wylis/Hodors disability.  We learn the Children of the Forest created White Walkers to protect them from the first men.  The White Walkers attack the cave, kill Hodor and the 3 eyed raven and Bran and Meera wander out into the woods.  Benjen helps them, then drops them off near the wall.

The old Masters attack Meereen.  Dany and her new Dothraki army fight them, and she gains some more ships.  Yara and Theon show up and team up with Daenerys.  They head toward Kings Landing to finally take the throne.

Edmure surrenders Riverrun to the Freys/Lannisters, and the Tullys go to help fight for Winterfell.  Without Jon Snows knowledge, Sansa allies with Little finger and gets the Knights Vale.  Battle of the Bastards, Starks retake Winterfell and Ramsays dogs eat him.  Arya goes to Riverrun and kills Walder Frey and a couple other Freys.

Cersei (with Qyburns help) wildfires the Faith Militant, Margaery and Loras Tyrell, and a bunch of other people.  Tommen kills himself and Cersei takes the throne.  Olenna goes to Dorne and allies with Ellaria.  

Jon Snow finds out Melisandre was partly responsible for killing Shireen, and throws her out of Winterfell.  People declare Jon king of the North.  We find out Jon is Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryens son.  

Jon Snow unites the northern houses and wildlings to fight the white walkers.  Melisandre, House Tyrell and Martell ally with Daenerys in Dragonstone.  Euron attacks and kills Theon/Yara/Martels on the way to Dorne.  Theon jumps ship and survives.  Cersei kills Elaria.  The Lannisters invade Highgarden to get money to pay their debt to the bank of Braavos, and Jaime kills Olenna Tyrell.  Daenerys attacks Jamie/the Lannisters on the way back to Kings Landing.  

Sansa, Arya, and Bran all make it back to Winterfell.  Sansa rules in Jons absence.  They execute Littlefinger for killing Lysa.  

Jon and Davos  go to Dragonstone to get Daenerys to help fight white walkers.  Shes not on board, but lets him mine for Dragonglass. Jon and company go beyond the wall and capture a wight as proof of their existence.  Daenerys saves them, but a dragon is killed and White Walkered.  Jon surrenders to Daenerys and they  have hot, hot sex (and Danny gets knocked up??). Missandei gets some too.  

Cersei rules in Kings Landing.  Told Euron Greyjoy he would marry him after they defeat Daenerys.  Euron brings Ellaria Sand and her daughter Tyene, and Cersei poisons Tyene in revenge for Ellaria poisoning Myrcella.  Cersei and Jaime are having an Incest Baby!  

Tyrion tried to get a ceasefire between the Lannisters and Daenerys, and fight the Night King together.  Daenerys, Tyrion and Jon show Cersei the Wight.  Cersei is still planning to attack Daenerys and Jamie decides to leave Kings Landing and help Daenerys to help fight the Night King.  

Night King and Undead Dragon destroy part of the Wall, and a bunch of White Walkers head South.

I am trying to figure out the identity of the four loyal retainers that accompanied the children.  We have seen the Kingsguard in the role of accompanying Viserys and his pregnant mother.

Who are contenders in this list?  

1. Kingsguard members- because it was part of their job to keep the royal family safe and Darrys brother was one of the Kingsguard.
2. A Martell who might want to help overthrow the King responsible for the murder of Princess Elia Martell and her children?
3. Varys -because he must have been instrumental in relocating them to Braavos with his old old friend Iliryo Mopatis.  Varys and Mopatis were pickpockets together when young.

List gets shorter quickly.

The ONLY possible kingsguardsman is Ser Jaime Lannister.

Why?

This is the roster of the kings guard during Aerys II reign:

Gerold Hightower, Arthur Dayne and Oswell Whent -all died guarding Lyanna and baby.

Prince Lewyn Martell and Jonothor Darry were both killed at the battle of the Trident alongside Prince Rheagar.  Most likely with Rheagars forces from beginning of war.  

Ser Barristan Selmy, was seriously wounded but still alive after the Battle of the Trident, knowing Rheagar was dead could prompt the urgency put Dany and Viserys out of reach, but wasnt he taken prisoner?  Could he have been pardoned and run down to Dragonstone? 

Ser Gwayne Gaunt was killed during the Defiance of Duskendale, years before the Robert's Rebellion.

This just leaves 

Ser Jaime Lannister, who killed King Aerys II.  He was the first to learn it was Robert Baratheon to claim the throne because he sat on the throne waiting for the claimant to show up.  Someone SAW him slay the mad king, so he was quite safe as he made himself a hero of the rebellion.  The Kingsguard was responsible for the King AND his family.  While putting the mad dog king down, he may still have felt honor-bound to protect the Targaryen heirs.  He had the job of accompanying the queen and Viserys before, it was his first task as a member of the Kingsguard.

I think there is value in figuring out who was responsible for saving Dany and Viserys.  Bet it gets revealed.",6,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

1740,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2019-2-11,2019,2,11,9,apahw1,self.gameofthrones,(Spoilers) End Game for ASOIAF,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/apahw1/spoilers_end_game_for_asoiaf/,Braniscelticmerlin,1549845270," I write this theory to put to bed the missing links between the Night King, Bran Stark, Jon Snow and Baric Dondarion (based on the story telling stylisation of GRRM, the TV show easter eggs and my personal interpretations). In general, GRRM tends to base his story-telling through his adaptations about historical periods in English history (such as the war of the roses adapted into the war of the five kings), landmarks and place names (referencing Drogo Castle as Karl Drogo), maps and landscapes (including similarities between Westeros and the UK and Esos and the Mediterranean) and most importantly in relation to this theory, some well-known and less well-known English, Celtic and Welsh mythologies. The English and Welsh myths of Merlin and King Arthur as well as the Celtic myth of Bran and the Magical Cauldron are fundamental pieces to GRRMs current story-telling puzzle. 

As such, I propose, based on the evidences I will now share that ASOIAF will fortunately/unfortunately end as a looped continuum, in which Brans death inside a Werwood tree will link to all past events in ASOIAF as well as his connection to the Night King and Jon Snow. However, the inexperienced Bran Stark we see in the show will also end up causing, rather than preventing, wars and deceptions among men across the ages, as the information he channels to them (in the interest of peace) often leads to madness and obsession which suits the mythology and events played out throughout the overall story arc of ASOIAF.

To begin this journey, we need to understand how GRRM has adapted the story of Merlin and King Arthur, which fit perfectly into the character arcs of Bran Stark, Jon Snow and the Night King. Merlins origin story begins in Britain, as the Kings of England decree a bastard must be sacrificed to protect their fortress from invasion (Children of the forest sacrifice needed for the Night King to protect them against the invasion of the first men). During the search, the Kings advisors stumble across a group of children playing in the forest (cutting down the Werwood trees). One child, to later be identified as Merlin, was sat in isolation from the other children due to their distain towards his status as a bastard and knowledge that his mother was impregnated by a demon (The Night King; born a bastard between a man, possible Bran Stark, and a child of the forest). The discovery of Merlin parallels the inception of the Night King, who I believe was originally a child of the forest. To be clear, the vision that Bran saw of the creation of the Night King in the TV show reveals to us a few clues in addition to this (which I will explore later on), but essentially shows us that the Night King was created to protect the children from the actions of men.

As the young Merlin grew up, he was found to possess greensight, warging and the ability to reincarnate himself with each passing generation (Night King and Bran Stark). During his travels Merlin used his prophetic powers to instruct Englishmen to dig the earth at a specific point and release two jars each containing a dragon (Bran Stark influencing the past). A battle between these two dragons ensued in which the red dragon was depicted as settlers of England (the other god/children of the forest/white walkers) and the white dragon was depicted as the invaders (the red god/the first men). To unite and bring about peace from Merlins mistake he later predicted that a great leader by the name of King Arthur (Jon Snow; of ice and fire) would be born to unite the two warring tribes. Merlin also spent many years later wandering around the forests, using his magical horn to move stones and construct great monuments (Bran the builder/Winterfell). Until one day, Merlin was met with a besotted British King (Rhaegar Targereon) who asked the wizard to cast a spell to bed a married woman (Liana Stark). In return, Merlin asked that the child of this affair, King Arthur, (Jon Snow) be promised to him (Prince who was promised). In this story-line I believe that Lianna Starks famous words of Promise Me Ned refers to Ned Stark knowing but keeping quiet not only Jon Snows parents but also the riddle about the prince who was promised and what that promise would mean about uniting ice and fire; after all Ned did keep saying Winter is coming. The remainder of Merlins story in relation to King Arthur involves Arthur learning his parentage through the sword in the stone (Jon Snows true identity) and being betrayed by his wife Guinivere (stabbed in the back by the Nights Watch). 

As for Merlin, his story ends with the belief that he died trapped inside a tree (Bran Starks Death Prediction), before being lost to time as merely a name, a whisper and a legend (All the Bran Starks in ASOIAF). The death of Merlin plays a hugely significant part in how this story will end bitter-sweet to the conclusions drawn in by the viewer and why the arc must end in a loop for it to make sense. To begin with, it is clear there are two true gods in GOT, the great other (red dragon) and the lord of light (white dragon), with Bran the raven influencing each side. In the Celtic Myth of Bran and the Magical Cauldron, Bran is a spiritual figure that connects to the trees and animals. So much so, that even after his decapitation, his spirit lives on as whispers among nature. As such, I believe that the true purpose of the Night King is to murder Bran Stark through decapitation. However, the location of Brans death in the show plays an integral part in the conclusion to this story arc. If we revisit the Hold the Door episode inside the cave, the show runners leave numerous clues about the link between Bran Stark and the Night King. For example, both characters are wargs with greensight, (just like Merlin was revealed to have as a young boy) and appear to wear similar attire. More convincingly than that when Bran asks Leaf why she created the Night King her response was to protect us from YOU, from men. Emphasis on the word YOU in this scene, suggests that Bran may have been directly involved in the past as much as the present. Lastly, when Bran witnesses the Dragon Glass penetrate the chest of the unknown man against the Werwood tree, Bran flinches in the present. Based on these evidences, Merlins death and Brans death in the Celtic myth, I believe that Bran Stark will be decapitated by the Night King whilst being trapped inside a vision inside the same Werwood tree the Night King was created at. Once his death occurs, Bran will be lost to his vision with no other known choice known to himself other than to warg into the Night King as a pre-emptive way to prevent the events of the present. But, most likely, the magic of the Night King leads to a learned ability to remember Brans powers rather than a fusion of the two entirely. This would make sense for Brans dissemination into the natural world and also give the Night King a motive whilst also tying in to Merlins story perfectly. Ironically though, as a result of Brans physical separation from mind and body, past Bran and present Night King will never realise that these events are looped; as the ink is already dry.

Due to this interference by Bran, the Night King becomes a more powerful being, whilst Bran dissipates into a voice among the ravens and the trees. As noted by Jojen in the show when Bran tries to shoot an arrow through a raven in the woods, you cant kill him you know, hes you, In this sense, Bran is already watching himself in the present through his spirit in the past. To be clear however, Bran is NOT the lord of light or the Night King, but instead he is an influencer, trying to inform the living through the flames about ways in which to prepare for war against the Night King, prevent death and reunite peace. However, for every step Bran takes in the past, a consequence is played out which develops into other arcs told within the entire ASOIF lore. In the first instance, Bran the builder may have simply been someone warged by Bran or influenced by Bran to construct Winterfell and the Wall (just like Merlin). However, this magic was most likely rushed and led to divisions between white walkers, wildings and men trapped either side of the wall. Interestingly, GRRM does state that all men possess the ability to warg, but are not all awakened to using it. Thus, Brans decision to influence the living that listen through the flames is shown to lead to madness and obsessions and misinterpreted allegories. For example, the Mad King Aeryes looked into the flames as Bran tried to inform him about Jon Snow and instead misinterpreted the information as the famous quote burn them all. This quote could in fact be in reference to burn them all, burn all the (werwood) trees shouted by the first men as way of preventing the Night King from killing off all mankind. Secondly, the obsession of the red priests who gazed into the fire to sacrifice non-believers, could also be a simple misinterpretation of Bran warning the living about sacrifices which led to the Night King. 

Regarding the prophesies there are three that stand out, the prince who was promised (who is Jon Snow), Azor Ahai (Baric Dondarian; explained later) and the last hero (Bran Stark). Bran fits the character of the last hero as the legend states that the last hero lost seven friends whilst wandering in the woods before breaking his sword in order to overcome the Night King. In Brans story arc, he is shown travelling to the three eyed raven in the woods, during which he loses Catlyn Stark, Ned Stark, Rob Stark, Rickon Stark, Benjin Stark, Hodor and Jojon whilst the broken sword is actually referring to his broken spine. Even more so, present Bran being the last hero explains why old nan describes Brans birth as the end of the long summer, cannot distinguish between each of the Brans of the lore and to not trust crows (who whisper the words of past Bran). Finally, Bran being the end of the long summer makes a fitting tie in with the re-awakening of the Night King, who with the ability of greensight, would only awaken to build an army and hunt Bran down until the story ends, with Jon Snow uniting peace and/or begins once again in the past to this point.  

Regarding Jon Snow aka. King Arthur and Baric Dondarian, these two characters are the only individuals who have the ability to be resurrected by warging. Whilst Jons story arc is pretty straight forward, Baric Dondarians is still shrouded in mystery. I do believe that Baric is the original Azor Ahai, or lightbringer as the show has shown him welding the flaming sword and failing to die at every turn. However, the biggest clue to his historical past actually occurs during the TV shows episode in which both he and Jon are searching for a white. In this scene Baric is able to demonstrate to Jon that the Night King must be killed to end the war. In response, Jon states to Baric you dont understand. These comments confirm in my mind that Baric was the original lightbringer and has been alive since the age of the first men. Furthermore, for Jon to go from you know nothing Jon Snow to you dont understand suggests that his death and resurrection has more information yet to come about the otherside of this riddle.

Anyway, this is just a theory, im sure there are plenty of holes in it. So feel free to attack  ",0,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

It has occurred to me that the Night King knows that Jon is the prince that was promised. Why? Isn't it strange how seemingly every time Jon ventures north of the wall, he runs into the walkers? Other rangers seem to come and go as they please without running into them. The wildlings by and large are either ignored or not full out assaulted.

Secondly, there are already two major theories about who will kill Cersei, the first involving Tyrion and the second involving Jaime. While I do like these theories, Im having a hard time believing that theyre gonna happen. Why? Both characters are heading north right now to face the dead. Also, there are only 6 episodes left. I dont think that either of them will have the time to participate in the epic battles whilst still making it back in time to kill her. So, who will it be? 

My theory is that Petyr Little Finger Baelish will kill Cersei. Ive recently started rewatching the series and I came across the knowledge is power/power is power scene between Petyr and Cersei and I realized how much they dont like each other. Also, Petyr is repeatedly referred to as little brother in the series. Yea I know its by Catelyn and not Cersei, but maybe it doesnt matter. In Maggy the Frogs valonqar prophecy she told Cersei that the valonqar not your valonqar will kill you. We all know how ambitious Petyr is. And, if he isnt really dead, which I cant make myself believe he is, then what if he is making his way down south whilst everyone else is heading north to face the threat of the dead? He would surely have easier access to Cersei, and if he killed her, he could take the throne for himself.

There's one thing I have never been sure about: When Little Finger meets with Tywin while Arya is acting as his cup-bearer, Little Finger makes some very deliberate glances at Arya -- craning his head around to take a second look a couple of times. My question: is it ever resolved in later episodes (even in some deductive indirect way) whether he figured out who she was? I know it's never explicitly mentioned later, but I'm wondering if I missed any subtle plot twists or something that would indicate Little Finger figured out who she was... or not.

To me it seems like foreshadowing to what he'll do when he finds out he's both a Targaryen and a Stark.

Ive heard it referred to as Ice Jr but cant find a wiki on it, if it was like Ice (as it looks a lot like it, and I almost wonder if the creator(s) intended it to be Ice and hoping we wouldnt notice the size) and Valerian Steel as well, OR if its just some piece of steel/iron that has no name and value that people are playfully calling Ice Jr.

Watching Bran being pushed from the window, the killing of Jory and the Stark men, the way Cersei takes power, all the betrayals at court and the execution of Ned in particular still makes me so angry. The way the camera angle changes to Ned's view of the crowd then back to his face as Joffrey orders his execution is so well done, it made me feel so sad for him to give up his honour for nothing and the worry in his face for his family.

I was thinking about it last night and I really don't think justice was ever served for these crimes. Sure some of the antagonists have lost in the long run but almost no-one was ever held accountable for their crimes with the exception of Little Finger and even that wasn't as satisfying as I wished it had been for all the messing around between Sansa and Arya leading up to that moment.

GRRM said he loves gray characters, they feel like real human beings they come to life.

Black/White- Evil/Good characters are great for fantasy but they just dont make you feel with the character.

&amp;#x200B;

Best example of this is Jamie (for now) at the beggining he was a cunt we all hated, now he is a pretty chill guy.

&amp;#x200B;

My tought is; Cersei will redeem herself in some manner, will have a hearthwarming dialouge/monologue before she dies the same way her mother did on birth giving Jamie his last son she will name Tyrion/Tywin or something emotional like that.

&amp;#x200B;

The prophecy still stays true because she does get ""killed"" in a sence by her brother who made her the child

The other plain white character is Jon Snow, that wont win the Iron Throne, and will probably die maybe even in a meaningless manner just to make the ""being good does not make you invincible"" more obvious.

Im not going to pretend I have a lot of faith that this is going to be the ending we get, its just an idea that has come about by stitching various thoughts together and filling in the gaps in an attempt to make it logical. Ill start with the headline and then work my logic backwards to explain why I think this may happen:

My thinking is that Arya will Kill Jon Snow.

**How Aryas Story Ends.**

Aryss arc is fundamentally about her becoming a magic assassin, the payoff for that story is her using her skills to kill someone hugely important. The obvious candidates for that death are Cersei and the Night King (NK). I dont think it will be Cersai as, firstly, Im expecting Jaime to kill her, and secondly, I dont think Cersai needs to be killed by a magic assassin, shell be defeated more traditionally. The NK is a better candidate due to his magical nature and the size of the threat he represents, hes also likely an enemy of the Many Faced God (MFG, more on that later) but theres no personal pay off for Arya. The NK (currently) has no character and no connection to Arya, such a scene would be exciting but would lack the emotional weight Id expect GRRM to attach to the culmination of a major characters arc. If Arya is not to kill Cersai or the NK then we need to look further afield and I believe there are only two other characters that are significant enough to be the pay off for Aryas story, Jon and Dany. I subscribe to the idea that Dany could turn Mad Queen and may therefore need to be taken down but I cant stitch together a coherent narrative that would lead to Arya killing her, Jon on the other hand..

**The Many Faced Gods Champion**

Before I discuss Jon directly I need to talk about the MFG and the Faceless Men (FM), the MFG is essentially the God of Death and we know from Jaqen Hghar that the FM consider death an accounting exercise, that a stolen death needs to be repaid somewhere else (Arya saved three people so received three deaths as a reward). This suggests to me that the MFG would oppose resurrections as these would represent stolen deaths, if this is correct the MFG would oppose both the Night king (who resurrects wights) and the Lord of Light (LoL, who has resurrected Beric Dondarrion and Jon Snow). I also believe the MFG would have a problem with the Mountain, another character I believe Arya will kill which is why we saw her sparring with Brienne, we needed a scene to demonstrate that Arya is capable of fighting a fully armoured knight. What has the MFG got to do with Arya I hear you cry, she left the House of Black and White, shes not a Faceless man, read on.

I believe Arya is an unwitting pawn of the MFG, I believe she was scouted by Syrio Forel (who was a FM) in S1 and recruited by Jaqen Hghar (who may well have been the same FM as Syrio Forel) in S2, there is even a chance that Ser Meryn Trant is a FM (his face was acquired by Syrio Feral in S1 and he was used as a training tool by the FM in S5). The purpose of all this was to make Arya the MFGs champion in the final battle between the living and the dead. She believes she escaped the FM but I expect that she was released to complete a mission that she is yet to comprehend. 

**Why does the MFG want Jon Dead?**

If Im correct so far then Arya is a pawn of the MFG who wants her to kill someone specific, but why do I think that person will be Jon? I am 99% certain that Jon faces some severe consequences for his resurrection in S6, the question is predicting what those consequences could be. Jon is essentially a wight created by the LoL, the difference between  Jon and one of the NKs wights is Melisandres magic which we know can change appearances (thus tying in the S6 reveal that Melisandre is actually an old hag).  Jon was resurrected for a specific purpose, Beric Dondarrion says as much, we still dont know what that purpose is but it essentially makes Jon the pawn of the LoL and a key target if his great plan is to be stopped. Whilst we believe that plan is to defeat the NK the LoL is objectively a pretty awful god so I wouldnt rule out Arya and the MFG opposing the Lord of Light (Melisandre is already on her list).

**The Big Twist**

The problem with my theory is how this all plays out, how do we get from Arya loving Jon, the King of the North and the shows apparent protagonist and true heir to the Iron Throne, to Jon being someone Arya has to kill? I'm going to admit that I don't have an answer for this, we need a whole lot of plot to happen in S8 to get us from where we are now to this end point. If you forced me to speculate Id throw in the LoLs influence over Jon, the potentially undead baby that Jon and Dany may have together or Jons relationship with the NK (what happened at the Frozen lake after everyone else left?) as factors that lead to this event.

**The Emotional Pay Off**

This last section isnt about plot points but the emotional significance of my theory. Ever since Neds death Arya has longed to reunite with her family. Shes had a surrogate family (at times Gendry, Hotpie, the Hound and Jaqen) but shes always wanted to get back to the Starks. S7 was full of reunions for Arya, she met Nymeria (who rejected her), Sansa (who she struggles to relate to) and Bran (who isnt really Bran any more), but the big one is still to come, Jon. After her father Jon is the relative she was closest to, they bonded as outsiders to polite noble society and Jon gave Arya her most treasured possession, Needle. Jon is the best connection Arya has to her old life, being forced to kill him would sever all ties with it and may lead her to abandoning Winterfell altogether (many Arya theories suggest her fate lies away from Winterfell). Such an ending would be heartbreaking for Arya and would fit with the bittersweet conclusion weve been told to expect.     

**TLDR**

Arya has been selected and trained to be the champion of the MFG from the very beginning. She will represent the God of Death in S8 and will be forced to kill Jon (who is undead) when the true consequences of his death and resurrection by the LoL are revealed. ",21,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I believe that the North will prevail over the WWs and suffer heavy casualties.

Now we know both Daenerys and Jon are both Targaryen, but my theory only works on the concept that Tyrion is also Targaryen. If you havent heard the theory about Tyrion being Targaryen here it is in 3 short points. Its quoted in both the books and in the show that the mad king had taken liberties for himself even on the Lannisters wedding night, and its no secret that the mad king would sleep with other women than his wife. 2nd point when Tyrion met the dragons down in the dungeon, they went to burn him to a crisp but then chose not too as if they got his scent and realised he has Targaryen blood. Also he use to have dreams about having his own dragon as a child. 3rd point Tywin his fathers last words were you are no son of mine, so just going by these 3 things which have been mentioned in the show it can be plausible that Tyrion is in fact a bastard Targaryen. Right so now I will ask again what have these three main characters got in common? The thing I realised is that all three of there mothers died giving birth to them, so I asked myself why? This could be coincidental because there is plenty of birthing complications through the Game of thrones story. So I done a bit of digging with where the Targaryens come from, so In short they came over to kings landing from a distant land leaving behind 40 families like them selves being dragon riders. The Targaryens over here all bang on about there special dragon blood blah blah blah!. They tend to keep all there family line within there own, interbreeding. Now I know it has been said obviously Daenerys parents are both Targaryen but what if Daenerys is also a bastard?. We know its mentioned in the books that her mother Rhaella was not in love with her brother the Mad King. She did have a love when she was younger with a Sir Bonifer Hasty but that was short lived because he was not high enough to be married to such a princess. We also know through the books that the mad king was paranoid that his wife was sleeping with someone else because of the amount of birthing complications she was having between Rhaegar and Viserys. This is actually mentioned in the books and why he put her under constant surveillance was because she was having still borns and miscarriages. Why would he think that means she is sleeping with someone else? Strange right? So if it turns out that Danearys is in fact a bastard then my theory is this! Targaryens can only mate with there own kind otherwise there is birthing complications, which in a way makes sense with a few things. Firstly remember the Witch in the first season saying to Danearys she will not be able to bare anymore children, maybe she said this because she thought that Danearys was the last ever Targaryen meaning she will not be able to have a Targaryen mate. Also it kind of makes it ok in the viewers eyes for Jon and Danearys to actually get together even though we know they are related because thats the only way the Targaryen blood line can continue. It also fits in why all three of there mothers died giving birth to them. I know this theory does sound a bit mad, and it means that the Queen Rhaellor went behind the mad Kings back which sounds mental. What if though? Because the Sir Bonifer (Rhaellors love interest) according to the books turned to religion and did not find love anywhere else. How though would a man such as himself be able to get into the Red Keep undected by guards and sleep with the Queen whilst the Mad King was hosting daily barbercues? I mean that sounds mad right to get past guards with ease, surely they would recognise his face easily? Unless he was a man with no face!",11,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

I suspect that the Rat Chef Story was about the First Steward of the Nights Watch.  

A First Man joined the watch and rose to the level of Head Steward of the Watch. We learn that \*\*a King of from the South\*\*, an Andal, some even thought he was a Lannister, \*\*visited where he and his son had guest right while staying at the Wall.\*\*

The Andels brought the religion of the Seven. They just love talking ABOMINATION! The Religion of the Seven had a very strong proselytizing aspect and ultimately converted almost all but the North. Melisandre is also a big proselytizer, though people not of the faith can still serve Rhllor- by being used as burnt offerings.

I suspect that at one special dinner the Andel King and his son did the unwise thing of talking religion. They probably talked about all the ABOMINATIONS allowed under the Old Gods. ABOMINATION! Eating human flesh is not allowed during summer? The TRUE faith of the Seven prohibits EVER eating human flesh! Im sure they went on and on about the heathen Old Gods and there is only one true faith, the Faith of the Seven.

Gee, could that kind of talk really get up the nose of a First Steward and motivate him to \*\*serve the King his son in a pie\*\*? 

I suspect this might have made the First Steward rather popular among the Northmen of the Watch. That pompous Seven King got an appropriate comeuppance! Maybe even popular enough to be elected the 13th Lord Commander of the Watch?

Mirri saw Dany as a foreigner- not the one responsible for her peoples misery.. While \*\*Mirri scoffed at her kindness after being confronted about vegetable Drogon, but she had been honest that it might be kinder to let Drogon just die than do the magic.\*\* She could have just kept her mouth shut about the magic from the start but she was a bit beholden to Dany for trying to save the women from being prizes or sold as slaves.

\*\*As Drogon lay dying, Jorun wanted to flee to safety with Dany to the nearest port but Dany would have none of it because her son was destined to rule. Jorun explained the Dothraki are not like us, who follow blood lines, there will be a fight for new leadership. Mirri sends everyone from the tent and not renter because, death will dance here tonight. \*\* That is a huge DO NOT ENTER sign.

Jorun carries Dany into the tent as she goes into labor. Who was in the tent? Miri, a dying Drogon, a dead horse, Jorun and Dany. No one else. \*\*It appears Dany needed to be told what happened at the birth as she was not conscious for one reason or another.\*\*

I believe the baby was born alive and healthy. Jorun told Mirri to lie and say the baby was born dead and he promised to take the baby and Dany far away, never to return. She agreed to help these foreigners flee and Jorun stole away and hid the baby or immediately had it taken to safety and on to Varys- he was working for Varys and I am sure Varys gave him instructions on saving her and children at all costs.  

\*\*Mirri told Dany the story, the baby was a life for a life\*\*, a monster, part of the sacrifice, that just about dissolved when she touched it. Jorun anticipated that he could get Dany to leave quickly with him if she thought her baby was dead.  

\*\*When Dany created the funeral pyre for Drogon, Jorun thought she was going to throw herself on the pyre with Drogon\*\*. In many cultures widows often chose to die on their husbands funeral pyre. \*\*She did not carry a bundle with her dead baby with her into the flames. The overshot shows no bundle on Drogons chest as she lights the funeral pyre.\*\*

\*\*Jorun was quite surprised when she immersed from the flames with her three dragons.\*\* Not an anticipated outcome. And, I bet there was never a good moment for Jorun to let Dany know about the baby. The new situation probably completely drove any thoughts about the baby out of his mind.

I'll give my questions and then explain where I'm coming from.

1) Why did bran need to be in the past for this event?
2) How did bran stay in the past after being separated from the tree?

My understanding of the basics is this:
Past bran wargs into present hodor. This effects Wylis (i guess either because of Bran's lack of experience/precision in warging or because Bran, Wylis, and Hodor at that moment became one conscious). Whatever the nature of the connection was, Wylis could suddenly see bran and hear everything. I dont think Bran warged into present Hodor indirectly by first warging into Wylis b/c Wylis' eyes change substantially later; I've always thought Wylis was incidentally brought in. Then Wylis' brain essentially breaks b/c he was effected by warging and that is bad for human brains and also he was experiencing the death of his future self. 

So why did Bran need to be in the past at this moment? Or more specifically, why did Wylis need to be involved in this at that very moment? If Hodor was already Hodor in the present, why couldn't Bran just be awake and warg into Hodor? Was it just b/c TER needed to download weirwood.net into bran's brain for as long as possible? Or was this a harsh lesson by TER? 
Was it for dramatic effect to simply show us/bran how hodor came about. Or is there some reason Bran needed to be there and cause Hodor's existence at that very moment? Am i missing something?

2) How does Bran stay connected to the past after leaving the tree? Maybe i am wrong but i thought he needed the tree to get into the past and stay there? He continued in that state right up until benjen reacued him. How?

I dont think he is a Targaryen but I do think he has the blood of the dragon. So before I state my  theory on why I think he has dragon blood, let me remind you he got his man hood snipped and got burned in some blood magic ritual. In the show he claims to have heard his burning goods said something to him. His blood might be magic, and who has magic blood in GoT lore? Yep you know who. Well in Fire and Blood one of Jaehaerys daughters is freak lol she is basically a horny chick. And her father ends up finding this dishonorable and sends her out of kings landing to be a septa. She ends up not wanting to be one and leaves Westeros. She ends up being a prostitute in Lys and later having bastard boys out there. See where Im going with this? This is of course back in the day, maybe 200 years. Those bastards probably ended up having bastards of their own and so on. In the show and books, Varys is from Lys.

A Tale We Tell Ourselves Over and Over Until We Forget It Is a Lie,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/apo4ih/spoilers_what_does_it_mean_a_tale_we_tell/,ChayaFeige,1549937641,"At the beginning of every Game of Thrones Episode we are told:

IT IS A TALE WE TELL OURSELVES OVER AND OVER UNTIL WE FORGET IT IS A LIE.

I believe a big part of the GoT story is how oral traditions are important. Maybe they hold a seed of truth and we lose the seed after centuries of retellling, or it is a story that is made up to hide the truth, or it is a mix of separate stories that become blurred and merged over time. Or, maybe it is a lie we tell ourselves over and over because we prefer it over a more objectively true narrative.

There is an old Yiddish saying, The best lie is the Truth, meaning wrapping a lie in truth or wrapping the truth in a lie is very effective for the purpose of deceit.

**All Crows are Liars**

Nan says this to Bran as a crow lands on his window sill and crows. Clearly, its an old wise saying. I think it means that the Nights Watch (Called Crows) are liars, and given other stories, I think it is true. Here is why.

I believe the First Men made a very unseemly pact with the White Walkers at the end of the War for the Dawn. Part of the pact is the delivery of male baby tributes we see the Night King receive. This is kept secret from all be a few as its repugnance would be a constant destabilizing force in their society.  

Occasionally, the tribute is found out.  

It is hard to deny missing babies when found out. As the baby tribute is through or near the wall, It falls on the Lord Commander of the Watch to do his best to cover up the repugnant truth.  

So the tale, the BIG LIE, of the Nights King and his Corpse Queen was told over and over. His name was wiped so the lie does not stain the family of the Nights King. The key component of the lie was that all the evil was his decision to do. The Nights King was made into an enemy, an other, that the King of the North and King beyond the Wall destroyed. This allowed the King of the North to quietly restart meeting the bare bones terms of the pact.  

Next, we have the Tale of the Rat Chef. It explained the disappearance of a Kings son. It also explains the loss of babies as the Chef when turned to a rat, ate his young. I think the all white rats refers to all those black crows of the Nights Watch.  

**The Prince Who Was Promised**

I believe there are two distinct set of Prince stories. One is about a prince born amid smoke and salt, the other prince promised is a child of the current King that is promised as a tribute to the Night King. This second component of the pact is kept hidden as best as possible by those responsible for delivering the tribute.

I believe when Aegon I received the note from the Queen of Dorne, she was informing him of his tribute obligation. This is why he was upset and burned the note so no one else would know.

A surprise in the story will be there are two princes, not one, who were promised.

**Craster believes he is a Godly man**

How odd for him to say this, taking his daughters to wife and giving male children to the walkers. But he believes it because he is contributing to honoring the pact with the walkers. At one point, Craster notices how much Jon looks like his daughters. Craster is a Stark. His sons with his daughters are Stark. I think the regular annual tributes need to be Stark males.

**The North Remembers**

The irony of this expression is that just a few truly know what the North Remembers. The North Remembers the requirements of the pact with the Night King that keeps the peace. The saying has taken on another meaning to those unaware of its true origins.

**Lyanna**

Baratheon started a war over her. His love was forcibly stolen from him. He tells the story over and over. You can see Ned was tired of hearing the same old story from him. But No Stark ever varied from this story, they recited in it, like Sansa did in front of Lyannas statue. Baratheon believing this story allowed the Starks to remain close to Steven in his court. But I bet he saw the look of love in her eyes when Rheagar gave her the blue roses. I look she never gave him. The abduction and rape of Lyanna was a lie.",2,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Tyrion is my favorite character and one of the few good guys left.  That being said I think it could be possible that he has been betraying Dany with possibly the help of Varys.  Just think about it:

 

1. Varys arranged the alliance of the Tyrells and Martells. Apparently helpful, but both were opposing Cersei independently. The alliance just let Tyrion control them.

2. Tyrion ordered the Martells and Yaras fleet - and Euron knew just where to find them, as if he had information.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Tyrion sent the Unsullied to Casterly Rock - but the Lannister knew and left it to attack the Tyrells.

&amp;#x200B;

4. Olenna told Dany that Tyrion was a clever man - but she should stop trusting clever men. Foreshadowing.

&amp;#x200B;

5. Tyrion prevented Dany from destroying Cersei and her forces at Kings Landing. He protected Cersei.

&amp;#x200B;

6. Varys says he works for the realm - but believes an invasion by dragons and Dothraki would be good for Westeros? He should have worked to put Tommen, Marcela, Robb Stark, or ANY good Westerosi lord on the throne.

&amp;#x200B;

7. Anyone seriously believe Cersei could nearly order Jaimes death but spared Tyrion??

&amp;#x200B;

8. Cersei told Jaime, there is one other Lannister. She doesn't mean her unborn child, she means Tyrion.

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps i'm going a little crazy though. Someone in Dany's party will either die or betray her and a betrayal will be the biggest shock. I hope that doesn't happen but it isn't out of the realm of possibility.",23,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

We have been gradually exposed to the concept of white walkers, wights and that the dead can be turned into wights. Recently we got the proof when the Night King turned the dead into wights (battle of hardhome). The only way around this transformation is for the dead to be burned.

Now, the Starks are a northern house and know the stories of white walkers. Most of Westeros (including the Starks) thought of them as myths and fairytales. Hence the knowledge lost needed to be relearned regarding fire and dragonglass.

Question : Shouldn't the northerners have some kind of tradition to burn their dead and not bury them i.e. the crypts of winterfell ?

My Bad Theory : Night King has already crossed the Wall. He comes to winterfell and raises his hands. Voila, all the dead from the crypts of winterfell turned into wights. ",7,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

TLDR: is one paragraph all the way at the end. 
Disclaimers: Id say 80% of this is not mine, Im just trying to put some popular theories together with some of my own predictions. 


I believe that game of thrones will not introduce new magic into the equation for the climax of the story. This will seem anticlimactic and like an ex machina. Therefore, everything that has happened will be something that has happened, or that we have seen (in some way) before (LF speech). I do not think the Night King is the true villain (, I think the true villain has been seen though and is of course children of forest.

Men need a master stroke to win this war, or at least not lose. But it will only happen through a miracle and that is Bran.  1 in 1000 people have warging, 1 in 1,000,000 have greensight. For Bran to have both, its one in a billion. Since there was a small population of people back then relative to today, its possible that Bran is the first person in history to have both. Weirwoods have been mostly burned down by men, and were worshipped by children of the forest. They never die of old age and experience time differently than men. Bran can touch one and see into the past. Hypothetically, if someone can see, memorize, and analyze everything in the past, they can become a god with true prescience and see the future (because analysis of the past leads to analysis of the future). Bran will get close to this but he will never quite achieve god status. 

With only greensight, you cannot influence the past (atleast not much), but the warging element allows you to do things in the past. Bran has tried to change the past x amount of times (some of these attempts have been to save humanity when he becomes more powerful). We see this when Bran calls to his dad in tower of joy and Hodor. (speculating this next bit) Bran calls to his dad (in anguish) through the eyes of a raven before his dads execution (hence why Ned looks up). If Bran wants to save humanity, he will need to use this more productively. He warns the mad king about the white walkers like it is majorly speculated. He does this in hopes to unit men against them. I (and others) think Bran founded the lord of light religion. This religion is concerned with stopping the white walkers at any cost. He might, in someway be the Red God that twistedly whispers to people. There is a connection between the Red God burnings, and burning being able to kill the dead. Others have speculated that it could be similar to blood sacrifice. 



Bran climbing at the same time as Jaime sees him is not a coincidence. I think Bran was destined to get his powers regardless of whether he fell or not, but falling gave him less distractions and more time to grow in power. I think in one reality, Brad (this is Bran in this reality) was always walking and became a knight that met lots of Riverland girls (all of these distractions hindered his growth in power). Imagine for a second, in this reality, Brad has 30% of his power by the time humanity is on its last legs because of the white walker invasion. Brad is fishing in the past to find a moment where he can change everything, and he finds the perfect opportunity for a master stroke. Oh, almost forgot to mention, there is one person, and only one that does not exist in the Brad timeline and should not exist but does. You have probably heard of them. 


Brad knows that he had not spent half his life doing knight stuff, he would be more powerful and have a chance to stop the walkers. Bran climbs the tower to feed crows at the top. A massive pack of crows emerges at the top of the tower at the exact moment Cersei and Jaime are in it. Bran of course has to climb the tower to feed these crows (the crows were gathered there by Brad, this was how he changed things), and is pushed and cannot fight anymore. No more knightly distractions, Brad made sure of this by removing his ability to be a knight. Bran in one reality manipulated our Bran to climb the tower so that he would lose his legs so that his true potential and power could grow naturally, from a young age. This is the masterstroke that Bran/Brad plays, but still not the third twist. 

Even the red god and warnings of the great other are not enough to stop the walkers, but they do help. The only way to stop the white walkers is to cut the out root and stem, by flying way back in time to when they were created. Supposedly they were made under the tree by a obsidian being pushed into a guys chest by children of the forest. Bran will go back to this moment and try to stop it and deleting the walkers in every timeline, but he will fail, because he was tricked. 

If people burned down the trees that I prayed to (I dont actually do this lol), killed most of my race, and caused the survivors of my race to scatter and hide for 8,000is years, I would probably hold a grudge against these people. I refer to children of the forest. Bran has tried everything in his almost infinite power to stop the white walkers, but it all fails. When hope seems lost, he will remember that he witnessed the creation of the first white walker, and he will jump back to this point to try to stop them from existing in the first place. I think this vision was not a true representation, and a trap (I also dont understand why the children would reveal to bran that they made the walkers, but with this theory it would make sense). Here he is tricked by the children of the forest and trapped as their vessel (I think this is the third twist). I think the children are hold no mercy towards men, jojenpaste makes sense, and I think they held the three eyed raven hostage. This vessel is known 8000ish years later as the night king. His powers are very similar to Bran (his control is suspiciously similar to warging). I think theres a reason we never see male children of the forest, they might be some kind of sacrifice/whitewalkers (we never see female whitewalkers or male children) and (minor book spoiler) in the books we see them in the three eyed ravens Treefort in a section that was meant to be hidden. Very fishy. Similar to Willis becoming hodor, bran was always the night king because it was inevitable to happen.  

So why would Bran become the night king and kill humans? My main theory has been said this is more speculative territory. I think the worlds gift of death is a clever easter egg. I think The children will not let Bran die (this would become ultimate torture after 8000 years), and will only grant him this gift when he kills humanity. Maybe the human side of his mind dies at a natural age, but his greensight and warging powers remain intact and can be manipulated. I think the children of the forest are behind the white walkers because there is no other being or race that would have motivation to want the mass extinction of men. 

The mad king going mad was a failed attempt by Bran to unite man. I mentioned there was a character that exists in the Bran timeline, but not the Brad one, and this character of course is Jon Snow. Bran somehow manipulated the birth of Jon Snow because hes also very important against the white walkers. Jon Snows value lies not in his fighting, but in his ability to unite mankind. Bran tried everything to save mankind, but ended up creating the walkers and almost (or entirely) ending mankind. I dont think Jon will 1v1 the Night King and win and end all evil. I think bran will tell Jon something last second that he sees while digging in the past. I think burning of the gods eye for example might weaken the night king and make him semi mortal, and he will finally be put out of his misery and given the gift of death.

I think Jon will win, and rule, and unite mankind, but I do not think this will be the typically happy ending because, similar to Frodo, he will live the rest of his life in anguish for what he has seen and lost. Bran was as much as a hero as Jon, but Brans last thought before getting his brains scrambled like Hodor is that he ended humanity.  

Regardless of whether this has any truth or not, I hope you enjoyed the read. And even more so, I hope you love the final season, despite the blunders in s7, I still have a tremendous amount of confidence that they will deliver. We are in the golden age of TV :) 

TLDR: alternate bran tricks our bran to climb the tower so that he falls and is able to learn greensight instead of playing as a knight. In season 6, Bran does not see the children make the night king, he sees a FAKE. Bran is tricked to go back to stop the white walkers from ever coming into existence, but is tricked and becomes night king. I know people hate that theory but I explain in detail up there if you hate it.

Heres some food for thought. The Mad King has an affair and perhaps married  (may or may not be consensual) Joanna. She becomes pregnant with his child and the product is Tyrion. Tywin learns of this and kills Joanna to keep the secret. He may have also tried to kill Tyrion but was unsuccessful. This starts the Mad Kings spiral and the war. Tywin states prior that Tyrion was no son of his. Tywin has Cersei marry Robert in order to control the throne knowing he would kill Robert Baratheon and the Lannisters would take control of Kings Landing. If Tywin knew Tyrion was actually a Targaryen he would have kept the knowledge to himself as to not lose control of the throne. Tyrion is older than Daenerys so he would be next in line. I say this because in the episode where Bran is talking to Sam he said he was never a bastard and the rightful heir to the throne. They want you to believe its Jon by the words but the scene also keeps cutting to Tyrion as well. Tyrion was always able to get close to the dragons. Why? Because he is actually a Targaryen. Theres three Dragons and they represent Tyrion, Daenerys, and Jon much like the dire wolves represented house stark. Jon had a dire wolf because he was also of house stark.

with stranger components explained by separate, reddit post links.

Varys is honest when he says his interest is the good of the kingdom. He believes he is the Prince that was Promised. He is WRONG but I explain why he believes this incredibly unbelievable statement here [https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/ao1zjs/spoilers\_highly\_speculative\_what\_varys\_heard\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/ao1zjs/spoilers_highly_speculative_what_varys_heard_in/)

Varys was key in taking Viserys and Dany from Dragonstone to a hiding place in Essos. [https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/ap9xh9/spoilers\_trying\_to\_figure\_who\_were\_the\_four\_who/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/ap9xh9/spoilers_trying_to_figure_who_were_the_four_who/) He moves them to Pentos to the home of Illyrio Mopatis a childhood friend when they were both pickpockets. He masters truth, lie, rumors and fables of Westeros, becoming so knowledgeable that he gains a seat on every small council in Westeros from Ayris II and every ruler after.

He learns the title Prince Who Was Promised referred to two separate princes. There was the amid smoke and salt fable and a Prince of the Kingdom of Westeros due as tribute to the Knight King, a secret that until now known only to kings and the lord of the North. This is about the pact. [https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/anwu3n/spoilers\_speculation\_terms\_of\_manwalker\_pact\_made/. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/anwu3n/spoilers_speculation_terms_of_manwalker_pact_made/)

This contains some relevant stuff about why and what happens when we tell ourselves tales over and over, generation after generation. [https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/apo4ih/spoilers\_what\_does\_it\_mean\_a\_tale\_we\_tell/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/apo4ih/spoilers_what_does_it_mean_a_tale_we_tell/)

Here is why Jaime is the Promised Prince of the amid smoke and salt explained here [https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/aop1d5/spoilers\_how\_jamie\_lannister\_was\_reborn\_amid/. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/aop1d5/spoilers_how_jamie_lannister_was_reborn_amid/)There is additional info about why Jaime is The Prince Who Was Promised contained in the first link about Varys.

Varys arranged the marriage of Dany to a King (Khal) of the Dothraki, for its strategic advantage and the need for the production of a suitable Night King Prince tribute- he had learned this among many secrets. The production of a Prince tribute is for the good of the kingdom. Varys was responsible for the theft of Viserys riches because he thought Viserys would be a horrible King - petty, would seek incredible retribution. And pretty stupid, as he gets himself killed pretty darned quick. Viserys could have bought armies. With money, he would have thought of Dany as his sister queen. Without money, no army, she was the price for an army. Varys could carry out his plans marrying Dany off.  

Prior to Cersei owning the throne by marriage and right of conquest, I believe Varys had Rhaego safely stored (for the good o the kingdom) and Rhaego was the Prince tribute due the Night King... explained here [https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/apmt3g/spoilers\_speculation\_what\_happened\_in\_the\_tent/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/apmt3g/spoilers_speculation_what_happened_in_the_tent/) Baratheon had no legitimate offspring, so there was never an appropriate Prince tribute from his rule.

Now Cersei, Queen on the Iron Throne, The Prince tribute to the Night King falls on her, it is the child she is carrying. And the Lannisters always pay their debts. Explained here. [https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/aplauz/spoilers\_a\_lannister\_always\_pays\_his\_debts/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/aplauz/spoilers_a_lannister_always_pays_his_debts/)

People say, but Maggie said just three children. Yes. But it is told Maggie cursed Cersei because she threw a potion jar in Maggies face as she left. Maybe the curse was to have a 4th child whose fate is worse than death?

No, Jon Snow is not the Prince Who Was Promised either in Tribute or as the Hero who slays the other and pushes back the cold long dark winter. As he has bent the knee to Dany he is no longer King of the North but just Lord of the North. A Lord of the North Who is both Targaryen and Stark and no longer a bastard. A man who finally knows and owns his place in the world. He grows old in the North and has a place in the crypts of the Starks. The statue is him as an older man in the HBO trailer.

\*\*But Dany, what about Dany? And Tyrion? Sansa?\*\*

All Tyrion wanted was to be Lord of Casterly Rock, his father denied it to him. He finally receives it. He and Sansa consummate their marriage. Sansa has fallen in love with him as he has always acted with honor, chivalry, protected her as best he could and would not force himself on her, out of respect for her. He is a smart, interesting, wise and most of all, kind man. Boltons cruelty to her as his wife made her value kindness all the more. She had very handsome Littlefinger desire her, but who used her brutally when convenient.  

Her life experiences have brought her to understand how loveworthy Tyrion is. She becomes Lady Lannister, joining two houses that hated each other are now united with a love marriage.

But what about Dany?  

Who ends up on the Iron Throne? 

And the pregnant Cersei?

And what happens to Arya? 

I also feel I need to predict the events and outcomes that tie in to the heroic Prince Who Was Promised.

I am still working on those questions.  This is Part I, I hope to have a Part II answering them..",3,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Hear me out.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/appre1/spoilers_so_im_going_to_make_a_bold_claim_here/,Bellikron,1549948469,"The wording is very specific here.  I'm not saying he was a good king or a good person or even a strong king, but he was stronger than his brother.  

Firstly, he actually makes some decent points.  He says the kingdom should have a standing army and is worried about the threat from Daenerys.  His grandfather kind of overpowers him on the second front, but the fact that he was concerned shows that he's at least paying attention.  We don't get any of that from Tommen.  I'm pretty sure he doesn't even know what's going on outside of King's Landing.  

Furthermore, Tommen allows himself to be manipulated by everyone: his mother, his wife, the High Sparrow (more on him later).  Joffrey gets manipulated too, and is definitely out of his league, but he asserts his power and people fear him.  He commands things and the things happen, even if they're terrible things.

But the most important piece of evidence relates to the Sparrows storyline.  Through Cersei's and Margaery's manipulations, Tommen finds the people he cares about imprisoned by religious fanatics quickly rising to power in King's Landing.  Further manipulation gives the Sparrows control over him, and when his mother finally blows everything up, he kills himself.  All in all, he does nothing to make the situation better.  

Joffrey was a horrible person, but he would never have allowed any of that to happen.  Even assuming Cersei and Margaery still cause the rise of the High Sparrow, Joffrey would not have joined them, allowed them to reach the same level of power that they did under Tommen, or let them imprison his mother and his wife.  He may have started a war in King's Landing to do it, but he would have freed them, whereas Tommen shies away from the conflict.  In addition, Joffrey wouldn't have abandoned his people when they needed it most (granted, he would have remained alive for selfish reasons, but he still wouldn't have done it).  It was a cowardly act on Tommen's part that threw King's Landing under Cersei's reign.

Tommen is a much nicer person than his brother, but that does not make him a stronger king.",17,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Bran becoming supernaturally wise after paralysis

\^Same thing for Tyrion to a lesser extent

Stark morality exposing naivity.

Targaryn strength languishing over time between infighting, bastard lines and sickly dragons. Then flipped into strength again after the ""last"" of them is on the streets and on the run.

Cersei's strong love for her children exposing the damages of ""corrupt thoughts/actions""

Wall's supposed reputation for holding for 8,000 years

&amp;#x200B;

What else do you guys see emerging from this common pattern? 

I think we all have an idea that the Golden Company's motto of contracts or words being as good as gold, will probably have a spin.

Cersei has a final child on the way. I'm guessing it will not have a long and happy life since the mother never really reformed her ways.

Jon is still Starkly moral... and naive. 

Dany's apparent strength ""seems"" unstoppable now, and she already speaks as if she is queen.

\- in the books there is a significant difference between die Night King (The one we already know) and the Night\*\*s\*\* King (the 13th Lord Commander, who ruled the Wall and the Gift)

\- The undead Daenerys becomes is Nights Queen because the first Nights King was married to a cold woman with big blue Eyes = a White Walker

\- Jon is the connection between fire and Ice, just like a White Walker Daenerys is -&gt; Its their destiny to control the balance between the powers

Seven: Valonqar-Prophecy

\- in the books there is the Valonqar-Prophecy

\-&gt; The Valonqar will kill Cersei by wrapping **his** hands about her pale -&gt; Valonqar means younger brother in Valyrian, but this is a gender-neutral language

\- So at first this would fit for Tyrion AND Jamie (both are born before Cersei)

\-&gt; but Tyrion has no possibility to get near to Cersei anymore and Jamie still loves her too much to kill her

\- Valonqar also refers to a younger sister -&gt; Arya is the youngest Stark

\- Because of this, the Prophecy fits, if Cersei is killed by a younger sister, with the hand of her younger brother

\- Because of this, the Prophecy fits, if Cersei is killed by a younger sister, with the hand of her younger brother

Instead of making one of those giant posts filled with *too much* speculation and details I'll make this one short and brief and straight to the point without too much of the wild speculation and try to make it cohesive and plausible.

# FACTS:

\- George RR Martin has stated that his ASoIaF series is **heavily influenced** by Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings.

\- George RR Martin has stated that the series will **end bittersweet**, much like The Lord of the Rings (wounds are never fully healed; the world is not the same, it has to be rebuilt - Frodo has to leave, Sam and his friends are broken about it etc - and even before that, in the books, the Shire is heavily destroyed by Orcs and many dead). It's not a happy ending, but it's certainly not one of the worst. I think this series will end a little more somber, for better or for worse. But that would be speculation and not a fact (as of yet, hehe).

\- George RR Martin has stated that he **hates the typical hero/villain trope** where you could guess who would make it or not - and perhaps even what their backstory would be, and that he wanted his characters (especially the important ones) to have many layers added to them and function as complex characters and not (just) plot points to get character(s) from point a to point b. It had to make sense for the characters to do what they do, not the story.

&amp;#x200B;

# SPECULATION:

\- The Night King most definitely isn't a black/white character per say, because we haven't really had a character of importance be that yet on this show nor especially in the books. They have layers to them, and this mystical figure is certainly not an exception. He has a purpose, he has a goal - and that goal is most likely to be relieved of his cursed duties as a King of dead people, and his answer might be hidden in the mystical fortress known as Winterfell - or the Song of Ice and Fire Jon Snow/Stark-Targaryen. It could be more complex than this, but I think this would be the more obvious and understanble route for the character to go and to be. With this in mind, we move to the other point:

\- Jon Snow/Stark-Targaryen is literally Aragorn of this story, at least now. He is the heir to the Throne - he doesn't necessarily (have to) want it, but it is his. He is also a key puzzle piece to the Night King/Army of the Dead riddle. This is obvious, as his bloodline is the combination of the story's title combined with the Night King's almost respectful, calm and interested look every time he has seen Jon appear. It's a very telling sort of look looking back at it, because at Hardhome he has no way to know anything about Jon's importance - whether it be as a soldier, at the Night's Watch or certainly not as a King and a heir. But yet he does. He does know. Because he sees things, like Bran. He knows. He knows Jon is his key out of this place. Jon, Winterfell - and perhaps even Mrs. Targaryen, Dany, too. But Jon is a key piece. It is obvious. Every time he sees Jon he's looking forward to whenever his moment is to come. And he knows it is near.

\- King's Landing is literally Gondor of A Song of Ice and Fire/Game of Thrones. In The Lord of the Rings, the battle of Gondor was won by team effort - but most importantly the crucial puzzle-piece of the **Army of the Dead** (hmm) after a deal struck by Aragorn, heir to the throne of Gondor.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's combine all these three massive points with the potential outcome, looking at it from a Lord of the Rings-influenced standpoint (with liberties, of course).

1. Jon Snow (now known heir to the throne of the Seven Kingdoms/King's Landing) strikes a deal with the Night King to take his place as the new King of the Dead (or perhaps die and end the *curse* all together, seperately or together). This bargain, as Jon Snow's term, includes The Night King and his army helping overthrow and kill Queen Cersei and lay King's Landing low. This would paralell Aragorn's bargain with the Army of the Dead, and how they together crushed the forces of Mordor. Upon doing so, Jon will relieve him from his curse. The way to do this might be to become the new Night King, or perhaps even more complex by sacrificing Daenerys (with his Valyrian Steel Sword) to turn it into Lightbringer and then also Jon the Prince that was promised, the only weapon that can kill the Night King, and end his curse. Main idea, however, is that Jon will use the Night King and his army to end Cersei's reign.
2. It would, however, not be completely George RR Martin-style to make it too (emotionally) simple. Therefore, I can only imagine Jon taking over for the Night King as soon as the Battle of Winterfell is over/has come to a stop, and The Night King's motivations are made clear to Jon himself. Then, to make it emotional - the Night King would be relieved of his duties there and Jon now a walking dead - who day by day becomes a colder, more distant person - a shadow of himself, if you will - begging someone to kill him when the war is over (it takes fire to kill ice, you know - so Daenerys might be the *Princess that was promised* \- like season 7 teased, and end his suffering. Maybe doing so would even kill her herself).

&amp;#x200B;

\- And I would also like to add more potential outcomes (LOTR-influenced), as after the battle of Gondor the remaining army of Men had to walk to Mordor to give Frodo and Sam time to win/fight evil one last time. So the war wasn't won after this.

This is where I think the (now known) Littlefinger twist could play in as a parallel to this, where the Littlefinger killed in Winterfell was a Faceless man (like its kinda teased in a very short and special scene from season 7, youtube it if you will) and Petyr Baelish has been in the Vayle the entire time with Robyn Arryn as his puppet. This now very underutilized army will be the last test of freedom for all of mankind, but to our surprise Littlefinger will win and become King of the Ashes (King's Landing is by now pretty damn burnt up) - and the remaining Starks and allies and whatever houses are left will have to retreat back home. But the Seven Kingdoms are now longer under the ""One Throne"". They are all independent as they obviously choose not to see this new King as a true and just one for their world to be under; gearing up for a new war with the schemer himself. Gendry and Sansa will unite Baratheon and Stark, and now fight for the throne his father once had - just like in the past - in a future battle that we, as audience, will only have to imagine one day come, but not see unfold on screen as the world has to rebuild itself after having rid themselfs of one evil, now getting ready to fight another.

&amp;#x200B;

# OTHER PARALLELS:

\- Winterfell is kind of the Shire of our story, and the Scouring of the Shire (the end of ROTK book) will be the parallel of the Orcs attacking the Shire with the Army of the Dead/Whites attacking Winterfell.

Multiple viewings is a must..

A few things that were fun to me and stuck out:

S2

Theon - I am a lot less disgusted by him. He does despicable stuff that helped Rob's downfall and at the time I couldn't believe he was doing it (emotional aspect of watching it real time not knowing where it would lead), now I see how he was conflicted and weak and knowing where he ends up makes it tragic for him. He didn't really want to do these things he had intended to help Rob but had no idea what duty demanded and was easily manipulated, he was weak and stupid more than vicious and evil. He wasn't a ""player"" for sure like Bolton or Tywin or Cersei or even Joffrey...more a fool. 

When you look at the whole picture and him coming to Jon begging to be told what is right in S7, it makes a lot of sense. This was Theon's problem more than anything else, he just didn't understand what the correct thing to do is. 

His family was ""slaughtered"" by the ""Starks"" even if they didn't actually do it when the rebellion was crushed. He was led to believe 'you follow your lord and king and father no matter what'. He knew he was a hostage even if he was treated well and did care for his captors it always bothered him. He just didn't have any clue how his actions would affect others...failed to think it through...I think he thought he would take Winterfell and make his father proud without hurting anyone which is ridiculous. He certainly didn't storm in and rape/kill all the Starks/Northerners and get ""bloody revenge"" for when they attacked the Ironborn. Any violence was pushed by his men...who he listened too...like a fool. Tormund did way worse in his raids...and all is forgiven there...

Of particular note when he is told ""now you are truly lost"" at the execution and then it suddenly rains (remember Brans dream of the water engulfing Winterfell and Osha telling him they are inland?) and he is kind of being baptized but in a *bad* way. 

It is again the opposite of him in S7 when he drops down in the sand/beach water and finally understands duty. He is in total confusion right now. Seems like a huge point for Theon with the rain and no going back/he is clueless now. Every time Theon does something awful he has a pained look of regret like he knows he is messing up but he's on a rollercoaster he can't get off of, great stuff by the actor.

Theon's ""right hand man"" pushed him to invade Winterfell and then sold him out to Bolton. That guy was a bigger slimeball then I remember. First impressions do cause you to look at things differently. Its mainly his fault since Theon was a young leader looking for guidance and was sold out by his veteran right hand man and advisor. The guy tells him to invade Wnterfell and when it goes belly up he uses him as leverage to escape. 

Theon's speech - I feel like this scene will have a call back. I think at some point he will give another speech, maybe the best speech in the show, but it will be real and from the heart and not stupid bluster... we will see.  

Compare when Theon met the crew in this season when they treat him like dirt, when he meets the crew in S7. Good stuff.

*Question* - Ned is very against killing kids, I wonder how the slaughter of the Ironborn kids went down right in front of him when he worked so hard to keep Joffrey and Cersei's kids safe? Ned I imagine would have had a lot of say in what happened to that family...based on the kings description the kids were killed pretty brutally...although Ned saved one. I haven't read this far ahead to see if the books covered this...

Tywin...smartest man in Westeros has Arya under his nose for like half a season. Plus she obviously lets it slip she is highborn. He never catches on or even bothers to have her examined to see why she is lying or who she might be. 

Also, everyone knows Arya is gone (Tyrion even tells Cersei it will make her look bad and Cersei tells some guards to look) but no one really bothers looking for her that hard...the Lannisters let her slip right through their fingers...even the ""smartest"" one.They generally dismiss her of all importance and assume she is dead. Arya will be a huge problem for them based on this, we know she has the skills and she is coming for them but based on this set up... hard for her not to be the one to do in Cersei...


S3
Ok, so I ignored a LOT of Jojen stuff the first time through. He was this weird kid who showed up but honestly he is captain exposition and should be listened to. 

First thing he tells Bran, you can't kill the 3 eyed raven, it's you (hah kind of like Arya, that's not me). So it's about embracing who/what you are. 

Also, this goes along with a tin foil theory I have but we will see. Overall interesting how Jojen found them and was sent by his dad with his sister to essentially get Bran to the Three Eyed Raven so he could become the Three Eyed Raven. Two characters show up just as Bran is on the road to his brother and hand him his destiny after being told by...magical visions? A LOT of this going around in Westeros. Ask Stannis. 

Catelyn - ""everything that happened to her family happened because she couldn't love a motherless baby"" hmmm. This always seemed weird to me. 

*Question* You can blame losing Winterfell on Jon since he might have stopped Theon had she allowed him to stay but how can you blame Ned going south and getting killed by Joff on this? Anyone have an idea how she relates all her troubles to not loving Jon?

Mel to Arya, brown eyes, blue eyes, green eyes you'll shut forever. So far only Littlefinger is the significant character she has killed. His eyes are green grey, he count as one of them you think?
Sansa's eyes are blue
Cersei and Jaime green
Jon Snow - Brown
Not sure but that is still out there. No way to know which way Arya will swing, a lot of revenge and twists to be had plus magic and white walker possibilities and betrayal. 

Night King - the eyes of those he controls turn blue like him, the eyes of those Bran controls rolls over white like his...is the Night King magic just a kind of super warging? 

Osha - doesn't believe all these bad things happen to you because the gods have a plan for you and tells Bran thos. I think that is exactly why they are happening to Bran... I think Bran and his family are going to hell because there is a plan to beat the NK that revolves around all this turmoil.

Jojen - the nights watch and the kinds of westeros can't stop the NK. This implies Bran and only Bran to me can. Jojen didn't seek out Jon or Dany...

But then again Stannis is being told the same thing basically...by Mel.

Davos - really adamant blood magic is evil and it gets him in tons of trouble and even locked up/road to Burnsville. I think since he is a moral core and we keep seeing the crazy stuff Mel does...it is evil...especially since we see how it burns Stannis...but we will see...on to 4,5,6, after I am done I suspect I will have a much different view of the way this is going...

* Game of Thrones wiki summary: [https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/You\_Win\_or\_You\_Die](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/You_Win_or_You_Die)
* Biggest moment: The assassination attempt of Daenerys foiled by Jorah was massive as it pushed Khal Drago to agree to cross the narrow sea. But clearly the biggest moment is the Ned-Cersei face-off. Both their private meeting and the episode climax where Ned was arrested.
* Episode MVP: Cersei. ""When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die.""
* Final thought: It was hard not to feel the dread building throughout the episode. As Ned endeavored to honorably handle Robert's death and the subsequent transition, he allowed his enemies room to maneuver. Ned never had the skills necessary to rule in King's Landing.",4,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

It is a question of using a grid of interpretation highlighted by comparative mythologists which makes that the mythical and religious imagination of the former Indo-European was structured in three functions, and from it resulted a vision of the world and an organization of societies. All this may seem obscure and I have tried to make it readable for Game of thrones, because it works very well to explain the construction of the story of G. R. R. R. Martin.

In that way, we better understand the importance of the characters, and why some will decide the fate of the world and others are only there to fulfill certain tasks useful to the accomplishment of the story. One of the main questions raised by the series is that of the legitimacy and purpose of power, especially in the Lannister house (Tywin is a great theoretician of power in the series). This is where the articulation between the *game of trones* where the Lannister house excel, and the *song of ice and fire*, which is the story of the Stark and the Targaryen houses, lies.

It is not a ""theory"" (in the sense that i dont speculate on this or that character who hides his game but who is super powerful, or such and such who is not dead besides any evidence, etc.) or a script leak, I have not read these texts that are probably real leaks from production, so as not to spoil the pleasure of discovering the end. 

Nevertheless, this kind of analysis will perhaps ""disenchant"" your vision of the series if you don't want too many explanations. At the end of the post I propose an idea of a probable end, a speculation too vague to really despoil.

I will correct it the best i can with your inputs and feedback. Also notice that i tried to stay as closed as possible to the first idea, and avoid expanding on symbolism or mythological references.

It seems that when WW come they always bring freezing cold with them. That is one of the reasons why they wait for winter to march south, since that is the only way they can operate.

In the House of Black and White, Arya asks Jaqen, Which one is the faceless God, I see the stranger, I see the drowned God.

There is only one God, a girl knows his name. Replies Jaqen.

Setting aside the question, are any of characters are actually Death in disguise, what can we learn of the GoT God Death.

If we believe Jaqen, all the other many Gods that are worshipped, The Seven, The Old Gods, Rhllor, The Drowned God, are just different faces of the one God, Death. The faceless men even refer to their God as the Many Faced God.

1. **Death answers prayers.** Especially if the target deserves punishment. For example, Arya gets three from her prayer list quite easily. And Jaqen takes care of the man who did not pay off the sea captains widow. We can assume she prayed that the thieving insurance agent dropped dead.
2. **Death allows no unseemly contracts**, his faceless men will ask too high a price. Ask to kill an enemys child, part of the price might be to have one of your own children slain.
3. **Death plays favorites-** I believe **Arya** is a favorite because she prayed to him every night. **Varys** is a favorite- as a bleeding neutered child thrown into the street, he asked the sorcerer what he expected him to do. The sorcerer replied,  I expect you to die. Varys pledged to live to spite him. Death admires fighting spirit. Those that say, Not today. It may be that Death has favored **Beric Dondarrion** for his fighting spirit. Quote Beric, Death is the enemy. The first enemy and the last. The enemy always wins, and we still need to fight him."" Another that says to death, Not today.
4. **Death enjoys the company of his favorites.** Without making the case, I think Jaqen is death keeping company with Arya. Older Petyr Bailish is death keeping company with Varys, and, possibly, the Doubting Red Priest Thoros of Mrys might be death keeping company with Beric.
5. **Death does not see himself as an evil God**. He can be merciful end to suffering, the ""gift"" of death. It appears only prayers that have some justice to them, calling for death to strike to compensate a wrong or evil, are answered. Only respectable contracts are ever agreed to with the faceless men. Ultimately, all men die, so he is fair, in that respect. Valar Morgulis.
6. **Death has a sense of balance**. Arya saved three people that should have been taken by the Red God (fire), so Death is owed three lives. Exactly three lives, Jaqen is almost sort of forced to take more than three with Aryas clever trick of naming him.
7. **Death is fond of being in close proximity to gold**. The faceless men supposedly began in the gold mines of Valyria. Braavos is home to the Iron Bank. It costs rich men a fortune in gold to hire a faceless man to commit an assassination.
8. With little direct evidence, I suspect **Death is not a big fan of mortal magic.** The mining slaves of Valyria were protected from death in the fiery hot gold mines using magic. Death had to give these slaves the gift of death via assassination, because they did not die, as they should have, from the deadly mining conditions. He had those running the mines, probably responsible for the magic, given the gift as well. This destabilized all the mines and probably is the reason for the Doom of Valyria.
9. I suspect that **death is also not fond of those outside of his reach**. Specifically, I could understand it if death had a distaste for necromancy. As we know, what is dead may never die. This might include entities that were originally mortals like the deathless, Melisandre, Kinvara any raised from the dead. They are a weird affront to the expression  valar morgulus.

If this last point is true, what if Rhllor is actually more of a magic cult and not a religion like the other faiths? Maybe the great other is Death, but there is some deceit going on that the God of light and life and warmth is not an actual God but mortal magic, possibly necromancy. Is it possible Kinvara understands this but Melisandre doesnt?

What if the lord of light in Rhllor is just an excuse to practice necromancy by burning living humans before death is supposed to take them (which probably pisses death off), and absorb that excess life force, using it to maintain failing or dead bodies? I would figure that Death is not happy about this theft of life. Contradicts that balance idea. A gross distortion of the law of a life for a life.

It is interesting that Kinvara sees or wants to make a Dany their Rhllor queen. Dany, the unburnt. Dany who burned Mirri Maas Dur alive as part of the needed magic to hatch her dragons. But, Mirri took her child, so it was justice. Dany does not burn innocents the way the followers of Rhllor burn people.

I wonder if Danys powers with fire are very different from the role fire has in the power of the priestesses of Rhllor.

Is it possible Kinvara seek to camouflage a necromancy cult by hiding behind Danys power with fire? Is Kinvara just using Dany?

Dany, the unburnt. We dont see the priestesses of Rhllor walking into the flames with their sacrifices.

Politically, it is fantastic to have an ally like the faith of Rhllor and their priestesses to amass the power to take the Iron Throne. But does Dany really want a huge debt to these people if they are crucial in putting her, as their queen on the Iron Throne?

If Dany understood that pissing off Death with magic that intrudes on his territory, and this is the explanation for the Doom, would she really want these sort of magic users placing her on the throne?",20,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

First post here, let me know if its inappropriate in anyway.

I have a theory on where lightbringer is and how it might return.

So we all know that the Starks have a unique relationship with the wall and the first men etc. My theory is that the ancestral sword of the Starks, Ice might have been lightbringer but in a dormant state.

Now Ice was melted down and split in two by Tywin Lannister. Tywin, who was the head of the house that has a lion as its sigil. This is loosely reminiscent of the second tempering of Lightbringer where it was plunged into the heart of a lion.

So my theory is that Widows Wail and Oathkeeper will be reforged into one sword, that will have to be activated again through a Nissa Nissa substitute to recover Lightbringer.

My top candidate for this substitute is Daenerys. In my head that would also reference the whole Ice and Fire thing. Melisandre is also a candidate as there have been references to her heart and all that before I think.",15,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

And many thanks if you have a link to a good discussion of it!*

The TL;DR of the Bran = Night King theory is that Bran will somehow use his ability to warg into people of the past (a la Hodor).

Relevant to this theory, the 3ER says to Bran ""the past is already written"" and cannot be changed -- ""the ink is dry"".

Proponents of B=NK tend to fit this into the theory by saying that while Bran fucks with NK in the past somehow, he's either unsuccessful or realizes that the NK's actions must be allowed to proceed in order to bring the realm together against a common enemy, or something along those lines.

There's another relevant 3ER quote that isn't mentioned as much in B=NK discussions, something along the lines of ""it is beautiful beneath the sea, but if you stay too long you'll drown"", and (in the books I think?) it's mentioned that a warg whose consciousness stays in an animal for too long will lose all memory of their human self.

The last relevant bit is the human who is turned into a WW by the CoF in Bran's vision. This is assumed by most fans to be the NK, due to it being the NK's actor. Any maybe it is. Buuuutt...

Even if that guy is the NK, what if he was just a ""normal"" White Walker at first, without the OP NK powers and ability to create new WWs? What if it's not until Bran wargs into him (or any other WW, doesn't need to be Ritual Sacrifice Guy) that he realizes his crucial mistake -- that Bran's warging is what granted him his powers in the first place, because he _is_ Bran('s consciousness). By the time Bran realizes this it is too late, either because his body dies in the present or was dying at the time of (what would probably be a hail mary) warging.

And then he's trapped there in the ancient body of a WW, but now with the powers of the 3ER. And just like we've been warned about warging and greenseeing, he eventually forgets himself completely, and thus becomes the NK we see today, fulfilling various prophecies along the way and completing the closed time loop like we saw with Hodor.

This would be a good explanation of how the White Walkers got out of control of the CoF, and tie together various warnings about both warging and greenseeing re: forgetting your original human history and ""drowning"" if you stay too long. Seems like a more satisfying (and ""bittersweet"") version of the theory than Bran deciding that the ""Night King Had Some Good Ideas"".",6,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

1. He has always been on the side of the Targaryens. When he was supposed to kill Daenerys for King Robert, he was actually saving her and always keeping her one step ahead of her would-be killers. Since season 1 we see that his loyalties lie with the Targaryens and that he is secretly grooming Daenerys to become the queen she is meant to be. 

2. We do not know the color of his hair. We all assume he is just bald, but he may be shaving it to keep his silver hair under wraps. 

3. When Varys tells Tyrion the story of how he was cut, Varys says that a sorcerer threw his junk in the fire and talked to the the flame. Then he heard a voice answer back. According to Mellisandra, the red woman, the only way to communicate with Lord of light is by using Kings blood. Thats why she did the leech thing with Gendry. Therefore, the only way that the sorcerer was able to talk to the lord of light was because Varys penis had royal blood in it. 

4. Finally and probably the reason, least based in fact is I simply do not trust him. Anyone who says that all he does is for the good of the realm that many times is really just looking out for themselves. 

I think if all this ends up being true, then Varys has simply bided his time and groomed Daenerys to take over the realm. So that eventually once all the dirty work was done he can unveil his true identity as a Targaryens and take the iron thrown for himself. 

I dont know which long lost Targaryens Varys would secretly be, but I would love to hear if anyone else had any ideas. Thanks!",31,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

2113,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2019-2-13,2019,2,13,13,aq2jj8,self.gameofthrones,[Spoilers] The truth about Winterfell,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/aq2jj8/spoilers_the_truth_about_winterfell/,YanosAldrenn,1550031439,"After doing some research it appears that this theory is not new but I believe my interpretation of it is slightly different.

TLDR: The reason the white walkers are heading south of the wall is to prevent the eruption of a super volcano beneath Winterfell.

This has multiple implications for various characters but before I get into that Id like to try to explain why I believe there to be a volcano beneath Winterfell.

Winterfell has obvious geothermal activity as demonstrated by the hot springs located in the Godswood and the fact that the castle itself is warmed by this spring water coursing through its walls. What might not seem significant though is the description of the door to the crypts and the fact that Winterfell appears to have been built on ground that was not level.

They are accessed by a twisting stone stair and a huge ironwood door that lies at a slant to the floor.-description of the entrance to the crypt.

Maesters believe it was built in pieces over different eras, since the ancient Starks did not level the ground and plan it as a single structure.-description of the ground it was built upon.

These things may seem like tiny coincidences but could in fact be the result of the ground around Winterfell swelling due to magma deep below the surface which brings me to the reason the crypt is so deep and was built first.

I believe that at the lowest levels of the crypt there may be access to the volcano or at least whatever was done to it previously to prevent it from erupting. Waking dragons from stone appears to mean waking the dormant volcano beneath Winterfell which funny enough would change the name of Winterfell to Summerrose.

I believe the massive Weirwood that Winterfell was built around, serves a purpose in this regard as well. During a conversation with Thoros of Myr The Ghost Of High Heart tells Thoros that his fire magic will not work while on top of High Heart which is most likely because of the numerous Weirwood stumps planted on top of the hill. This indicates to me that Weirwood trees seem to dampen or nullify fire magic. Hence the ancient Heart Tree in Winterfell which is located above a massive volcanic caldera.

Who would try to detonate a volcano and why? Melisandre has been rumored to be around 400 years old. The doom of Valyria happened to occur 400 years in the past yet she still lives. Only death can pay for life. I believe the doom of Valyria was caused by the followers of Rhllor sacrificing an entire civilization to extend their lives and to attempt to destroy the world (that they happen to believe is hell).

This leads me to believe that the White Walkers are coming south to maintain the natural balance of Westeros and prevent Fire from consuming everything they were created to protect. If the followers of Rhllor and the fiery hand succeed then there will be a second Doom on Planetos but this time centered on Winterfell instead of Valyria.

Some side notes:

This means that Bran and the NK/WW are on the same side(the side of the old gods). Melisandre even states that Bran is her enemy. 
When she looks into the flames, she sees a wooden face, corpse white with a thousand red eyes, accompanied by a boy with a wolf's face. She assumes that they are servants of the Great Other.

Bran has been told that when the Night King comes that hell be ready. On multiple occasions. Ready for what? To vouch for the true purpose of the Night King or to take his place to control the White Walker army while it fulfills its intended purpose, preventing the destruction of Westeros.

This also leads me to believe the the legend of the last hero is actually the legend of the first enemy. In the vision where we witness a man being changed into the Night King I believe were seeing what ended the first invasion of White Walkers. The last hero went to find the children of the forest and when it was discovered that he was a powerful greenseer that could also control people (like Bran) they decided to use him to control the Walkers and have them retreat North again, which is why the last heros fate is uncertain.

This hasnt been told to Bran because he needs to see it for himself and dont forget what Old Nan says All crows are liars.

Hopefully this wasnt too dreadful to follow Im on mobile and have more to add to this theory if theres interest. Thanks for reading.",15,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

A lot of people find the Castles underwhelming in Westeros but I think the castles in GoT are fine in the sense of realism. Historically castles in Europe have been smaller and better fortified with the show following a format of a Stone Concentric Castle design (Concentric castles-Two or more walls Outer and Inner walls) with varying sizes and shapes with some exceptions such as Pyke. With the cost-effective walls protecting a town as we see in Kings Landing or the Free Cities. The size and grandness of the towns in Essos clearly show that nothing was limiting the design of any of the castles in Westeros. The Castles in GoT albeit realistic should have been depicted bigger in the show especially if the castles are listed as the Seats of Power for the houses.

I feel like the threat they have posed on the show is nearly non-existent and you never feel like the Ironborn are actually dangerous. 

The first raids from the Ironborn happen in the North with Theon taking Winterfell holding it until Ramsay comes and takes it back. With regards to both Book and Show, each depicts the Ironborn as cowards for an introduction even if they were outnumbered and surrounded. 

Then once Yara organizes a rescue party for Theon she takes the best Ironborn warriors and they are unable to rescue Theon but in that scene, a half-naked Ramsay manages to take out 1-2 of the best Ironborn warriors with dual axes alongside the other garrison troops killing some other Ironborn soldiers, so much for the best Ironborn soldiers right. 

Next, we see the second instance of the Ironborn being cowards surrendering yet again to Ramsay Bolton with the same scenario in the first with the same outcome.

Then fast forward to the Ironborn vs Ironborn naval battle which was epic and awesome just shows how easily they were defeated only by a larger force and surprise attack.

The threat of the Ironborn has never been present in the Show unlike the Wildlings or Dothraki two other barbaric warrior cultures who pose actual threats the Ironborn don't possess the same sense of dread.",8,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Brienne says in a very self deprecating/half apologizing manner, that she's sorry he got stuck as squire for someone awful. He returns ""I'm not. You're the best fighter I've ever known.

The first are the faceless men. We have seen them in action. They talk little. Taking a different face appears pretty limited in purpose to accomplishing an assassination and escape. Given the rather strict training we see Arya receive, it is hard to believe that there is some loose canon among faceless men, randomly taking center stage, in someone elses face. So, no, I dont think the older Petyr Baelish we see is actually a faceless man.

More important, at this point, are the second set of Chameleons, the Priestesses of Rhllor. It was a big reveal, seeing the aged hag, once the beautiful Melisandre after she removed the red stone choker from her throat. This huge transformation makes me suspect that their power to alter their appearance is beyond just looking youthful. It seems a small jump to think that the unique shape of the stone, when seen tiled on Quailthes mask, suggests Quaithe is also of Rhllor.

Given the appearance of Melisandre, I suspect that both Melisandre and Kinvara are actually no longer alive the way mortal men are alive. This reminds me of the Drowned God saying,  You cant kill what is already dead, which could explain why Melisandre didnt die after drinking the potion. She offers the explanation of Rhllors protection. I say, you cant kill what is already dead. Im not sure Melisandre knows shes actually dead. As an almost insane zealot, I dont think she would be a good candidate for espionage or sabotage.

So, Im just going to offer some observations about Kinvara that suggests how she uses her chameleon-like powers of her necklace to good advantage.

Firstly, Quaithe and Baelish spend a good deal of time cultivating paranoia in Dany and Sansa, respectively. It seems what they say to each is exactly formulated to force a level of overthinking the ideas they provide. Trust no one, assume each person has the worse intentions and go from there. Unhelpful words and thoughts that might seem like deep riddles or mental exercises to distract and generate paranoia. The sort of stuff enemies do in propaganda generated for the other side.  

While Kinvara and Melisandre wear red stones at their throat, and Quaithe, the mask, Baelish is always wearing a mockingbird pin. The family name of Mockingbirds means to mimic. Might this pin may play the role the red stones play for Melisandre and Kinvara as women?

But how do I know it is Kenvara using her chameleon-like skills to appear as Baelish and Quaithe.  Well, beyond a possible common reason for what they say to Sansa and Dany, the answer lies in what both Kenvara and Baelish taunt Varys about.  

In the preamble to Baelishs Chaos is a Ladder soliloquy, Baelish endlessly taunts Varys about his possible sexuality that could be catered to in his brothels. Then Baelish says something the effect, tell me, does someone somewhere keep your balls in a little box?  

Cut to when Tyrion and Varys visit the First Priestess of Rhllor, Kenvara, responding to Varys skepticism of her prophetic powers, pronounces that she knows he is a eunuch and knows who the voice he heard was and what it said. This clearly leaves Varys shaken. While the read or watcher of GoT knows Varys is a eunuch, it appears to be his most closely guarded secret. To date, the only other living person who knows, besides the sorcerer, is Tyrion, who is told as Varys opens and closes the crate containing the sorcerer.  

But Kinvara reassures Varys that he need not fear her so long as he is loyal to the Queen (Dany). This makes me suspect that the later Baelish is Kenvara sowing doubt and chaos in Sansas ear.

Ah, but Arya slits that pretenders throat, right? To this I again offer, You cant kill what is already dead.

If you buy this theory, the next question is why would Kenvara want to sew chaos in Danys and Sansas thinking while calling her the true queen, growing followers and supporting her politically, complementing military strength. I believe Kenvaras goal is less about putting Queen Dany on the Throne as having a nice steady flow of human fodder for the pyres she uses for blood sacrifices and the fields of burnt men Danys dragons easily generate.

In this prior post, I explain why I believe Rhllor may not actually be a religion, like other religions. [https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/apy861/spoilers\_only\_one\_god\_death\_what\_do\_we\_know\_about/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/apy861/spoilers_only_one_god_death_what_do_we_know_about/)

If you dont want all the details, it comes down to a dirty little secret that Kenvara doesnt believe there is a God of light and life and warmth, this God is a facade to hide the fact that Rhllor is a cult of blood magic.  ",7,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I doubt I will catch up to it in time since the only time I watch shows is when I'm eating so I tackle only half an episode during week days if I don't eat out.

First of, I need to comment on HBO and how it's the most expensive service at $15 compared to other services I used in the past like Netflix, Hulu, and Funimation Now. Is it because of its prestige and history? Value wise, I feel that Netflix offers the best even at $14(have to have my Ultra HD) because of the wealth of content it offers and its UI. Not to mention I have to wonder if Netflix copyrighted the ""skip intro"" feature or something because I haven't seen it in any other streaming service. Moreover I apparently can't link my HBO account with my Amazon Prime? So I guess that means I can cheat a little bit and get 14 days of free HBO as oppose to 7? Also don't like how HBO signed a contract with Samsung so there's no HBO Now app on my LG OLED.

\-------------------------

Alright now for the actual show, a lot of dismemberment and decapitation for the first half hour the a lot of (nicely sized.... exception of Emilia Clarke) boobs in the second half hour. However, the show actually has some substance instead of just being gore and tits. What the first episode succeeds the most is in world building. I'm intrigued by the three main families introduced with the Starks, Lannisters, and Targaryens. The opening also introduced some mythical creature known as White Walkers. While I don't remember all of the character names(and I fear a bit for spoilers if I Google), some of them certainly stick out and you're left wanting to know more. Despite the myriad characters(some I already know because of pop culture like the brooding Jon Snow and the ""where are my dragons"" Daenery), the plot at least is still simple enough to follow and isn't Kingdom Hearts levels of convolution.

Because I came into the show this late though, I am a bit more unfortunate in being privy to things due to GoT's becoming a part of pop culture. Boromir... or rather Ned Stark, I figure he's going to die soon because he's played by Sean Bean and I don't see him in any later season promotions. Not to mention the conspiracy with the Lannisters. I unfortunately already know about the incest(Daenerys's brother fondling her boobs aside) so that wasn't a complete shock at the end... but shoving a ten year out of the window was.

Also interesting to see how many of these actors have careers in film now. Peter Dinklage is in tons of movies these days... he also has a monopoly on the dwarf market. Meanwhile, Jason Momoa recently gained immense recognition as Aquaman. Kit Harrington and Emilia Clarke.... uh Kit has Call of Duty and Emilia Clarke has Terminator Genisys I guess.

* Game of Thrones wiki summary: [https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/The\_Pointy\_End](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/The_Pointy_End)
* Biggest moment: This was a jam packed episode, and it's hard to pick just one. I'm going with Jon saving the Lord Commander. It's truly the beginning of the Great War because the Night's Watch has clear evidence of the wights. And they know the only way to kill them is with fire. This action also serves to elevate Jon.
* Episode MVP: Syrio Forel. The First Sword of Braavos does not run.
* Final thought: So much happened in this episode! Tyrion acquires his own ""army."" Robb calls his banners and marches with a real army. Khal Drago suffers a wound that will eventually kill him. Arya gets her first kill. Ser Barristan is dismissed. And Ned and Varys have a great scene together where we learn Varys serves ""the realm... someone must."" So many storylines launched or extended.

So to my topic. At the end when Tyrion meets Varys- Varys see the blood on Tyrion's face and says ""What have you done"". Then he puts him in the crate and watches the crate makes its way on to the boat and then starts to walk back until he hears the bells going off and he knows what exactly what he did.

Varys pauses for a few seconds and emotionlessly turns around and we see him getting on the boat with Tyrion.


It was clear that Varys's original plan was not to go with Tyrion, but what we saw is what made him so good at what he does, and why he was able to climb the ladder so high. Tyrion drastically altered whatever Varys's plans were and in an instance he recalculated his moves altered his plan and got on the boat.

He may have been annoyed as he felt his original plan that was derailed by Tyrion, but I am sure he recognized the opportunities it could create for him. It also made me think about his line with Oberyn earlier in the season when he was asked why he had no desire for sexual pleasure. He said it left him open to pursue all opportunities. To me this was one of those instances, had he been in love with someone and emotionally tied to them it would have not been so simple to just decided whether or not his best move was to get on the boat. It would have clouded his calculus. ",26,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

There is also a prophecy in the Mistborn trilogy (author Brandon Sanderson), that a savior, named the Hero of Ages will save the world. The prophecy was written in a language that: ""had no gender for a particular third person singular pronoun"" -[https://coppermind.net/wiki/Terris\_Prophecies](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Terris_Prophecies). This shifted beliefs that the hero must be a male, to the possibility of a female hero. At the end of the trilogy, there was a huge twist, and a eunuch, a person who had been a side character the entire time, became the Hero of Ages.

&amp;#x200B;

The similarities between both prophecies lead me to believe that Azor Ahai will be a eunuch.  Of course, it would be a huge twist (which the directors seem to love), since everyone is expecting one of the major characters to fulfill the prophecy.  My top pick is Theon, especially considering the recent [character development](https://youtu.be/_bggB7gw7ck) he has gone through. Varys is also a candidate, as well as Grey Worm.

But because of three big reasons:

1. All the standing up for Jon that he did for Jon, going so far as to question her own sister (with the exception of stopping LF) all ended up being for NOTHING. I repeat it would be all for NOTHING.

2. When she finds out Jon is getting help from Cersei and the Lannisters, the very people who wronged her family she will not be happy at all. May even be alittle furious.

3. Arya may not be happy that Jon gave up something that was rightfully his....That being the title of King in the North.

It greatly diminishes the grand scope that is Westeros and the great game itself.  But I think one little time skip/plot hole was in episode 6 and it's the one with **Gendry running to the wall non-stop in one episode.** The solution: **Ghost should have gone with Jon and the crew north of the wall.**

There is no way in fucking hell that Gendry could have ran that far.  I know the joke is that he was rowing for a few seasons but this is just one big time skip I didn't like. Of course my assumption is that Ghost would have followed Jon to meet Dany and has been with him since.  Having Ghost, Jon and Dany could have connected over their large beasts/children or Ghost could have chilled on the ship and that would be that.  

Now beyond the wall.  With Ghosts' accompaniment, the survival and the fight scenes would be so much cooler.  I can imagine the fight with the bear wight go a little differently with Thoros still getting mauled but Ghost just going for the bears neck.  Ultimately the same outcome would occur with the bear getting impaled by the dragon glass.  When the crew is stuck on the island on the frozen lake could have shown the companionship between Jon and Ghost by having Jon snuggle up with Ghost for warmth .  But back up a little, this is the mean reason why Ghost needed to come:  **Gendry could have ridden Ghost to the wall.**

Now let me know if this is far fetched but we know that Ghost is big, like really big, and he is fast.  Gendry is clearly the smallest of the group and would have been the best choice to ride Ghost to the wall. It was even joked about earlier in the episode when Tormund and Sandor were teasing him. 

The end result would be the same with Gendry getting the message across to Dany and with Ghost being safe for any further inclusion in the next season.

The show is a Game of Thrones and the books are a Song of Ice and Fire and both are things that are ""played"". I began to focus on Jaqen and the faceless men and how he ""helped"" Arya acting as a guide. I began to separate characters into those that are ""guided"" and those that ""guide."" I also thought of other guides like Mel and how they effected the story. These ""guides"" weren't always benevolent but they moved the pieces where they needed to be to get their way which was usually death. Death of Lords to be more precise. 

Knowing how the faceless men work, why would an assassin of the god of death take such an interest in a little girl, train and task her despite disobedience and the fact she isn't a true believer and won't give up needle her sword or her name or her list? What is the real mission? It seems to me the force that is teaching Arya, that keeps it's own ""list"" of who needs to die just as Arya does and must share her list which is why it wants to help her. She goes off into the world as Arya Stark or as a Faceless man? In the game of faces who can tell? Is there even a difference with their kind of magic? I don't think he helped her because he ""liked"" her I think it was his mission...

**The Faceless Men are a fairly old organization, predating even the Doom of Valyria. Their founders were slaves who worked in the mines under the Fourteen Fires, the great volcanic mountain chain whose eruption destroyed the Valyrian Freehold four centuries ago.** 

One point I want to consider about the faceless men before considering who might have been/be one is that they were born of slaveholders and might have an animosity towards lords and masters not unlike the Unsullied and Dany's people. The goals of Dany (breaker of chains) and Jon (bastard but man of the people who saves wildlings) may very much align with theirs where as the goals of the major houses would not and their destruction might be what the god of death wants. I think it is possible one or more prior characters were faceless men...

The Faceless men pride themselves on telling stories, stories full of lies that others shouldn't be able to discern. So immediately one person jumped to mind, Littlefinger. He is the biggest liar on the show. Now keep in mind I'm not saying he is alive...maybe he never was in the first place but maybe he was an agent of the Many Faced God. He did do more damage to the lords than anyone else. 

Possibilities/other major characters controlled by magic:

**Littlefinger** - Responsible for deaths of - 

Jon Arryn - likely the brains of King Robert's operation. 

Framed Tyrion which led to war between Lannisters and Starks, led to Ned's death, Robb's Death and Catelyn's death. Elimination of House Stark. 

King Joffrey. 

Was working on double-crossing the Bolton's and working with Cersei (using the Vale to wipe out the Boltons) or possibly double-crossing Cersei and using the Vale and Boltons to wipe out the Lannisters. Typical Littlefinger.

Ramsay Bolton Warden of the North - helped wipe out the replacements to the Starks in the North by backing Jon Snow in the end.  Which is interesting because backing Cersei or Bolton would have been the stronger play. What are the odds Jon marches south to take kings landing? We know he's not sentimental, Sansa learned that from Ramsay...

He also acts as a guide and teacher to Sansa much as Jaqen trained Arya. He teaches her how to rule, who to trust and who not to. He does deliver her to Ramsay but we know despite the torture he wouldn't kill her, he needs her. He is emotionless in many cases, almost robotic, which also reminded me of Jaqen. I can hardly think of a time he seemed upset or angry, really angry not game of faces angry.

Motivation - Littlefinger has a giant chip on his shoulder, a hate of the highborn for how he had to build himself up but they had it so easy and seldom deserve it. The real Littlefinger might have died at some point but when a Faceless man takes on a role they learn to imitate perfectly and I think even become the person to a degree, that is why they need to be no one so they can be anyone. 

This aspect of Littlefinger would align with the Faceless men, I think they may have a reason to hate Lords and Masters. As Tyrion pointed out, there are no ""slaves"" in Westeros but there are plenty of rich Lords. When Littlefinger told Cersei at one point, ""I live to serve"", I did smile, all men must serve. If he was a Faceless man he played his game very well and eliminated many Lords. 

Last few moments:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lcx8gAM6wM

**Melissandre** - not a faceless man but a guide to Stannis and then Jon for a time who answers to the Lord of Light, uses blood magic. Responsible for the deaths of:

Renly (one of the five kings)

Stannis and his family (ultimately walked him into his doom)

Guide to Stannis and then when he is dead Jon Snow. 

**High Sparrow** - this is an interesting one. This character came out of nowhere, everyone hated him and then poof he was dead...but what purpose did he serve? what did he really do?

Well when Littlefinger left kings landing who took over for him in stirring the pot? High Sparrow, in fact when High Sparrow destroyed Littlefingers brothel he didn't seem angry at all. Granted he had moved on but Littlefinger didn't make one move to mess with the High Sparrow or seem angry or want revenge at the affront. To the contrary they actually worked together granted offscreen. We never see Littlefinger plot revenge or even upset over his brothel and we never see the High Sparrow go after him... 

Lady Olenna goes to Littlefinger for ""help"" with Margaery and to get leverage on Cersei he delivers his head boy Olyvar to the High Sparrow which lands Cersei in hot water. Littlefinger and High Sparrow both want to turn Kings Landing upside down, with the Little People on top. In Littlefingers case it may be with him alone on top but they both want to change the system so Lords don't rule and in their ""talks"" with other characters seem very much to be playing the game of faces. We never saw the two speak but that might be for a reason. Either way much like with Varys they seem to be two sides of the same currency. 

High Sparrow had two likely end games, Tommen and a converted Lady Marg under his control in charge OR as it went, Cersei literally blew the whole thing up and another King and Queen bite the dust, I think he wins in that case also. 

End result - King Tommen dead, Queen Margaery dead both might have stabilized Kings Landing without Cersei. Cersei, total nut in charge. The kingdom is down to only one person on the throne with no one waiting behind them.

**Jaqen/Arya** - She is just getting started but so far she has killed Walder Frey to start. Cersei is the big name on her list...

**Ellaria** - People will probably not be happy to even consider her a faceless man considering how this story went but she did a good job of stirring discontent in her kingdom once Oberyn was killed. She trained the Sand Snakes to be assassins and was skilled with poison. Her skill with poison and elimination of a king make it plausible for me. She also is willing to work with Dany. Responsible for the death of: 

King Doran

Princess Myrcella 

**Euron** - 
Weirdly returns from a long absence out of nowhere and begins to stir the pot and play sides against each other killing a king and taking over. We don't know what he is up to but he seems like pure chaos. Killed:

King Greyjoy

Bran's guides and teachers:

**Osha**
A character who infiltrates Winterfell initially an attacked of Bran and then proceeds to smuggle and protect Bran and later Rickon, dying in an attempt to kill Ramsay. She told a story about her past as well and the Walkers. But she is a character who showed up and protected the Stark kids when no one else was around to with little reason to do it. Other than they were ""kind to her""? They got real lucky to have someone willing to die for them just because they were somewhat kind to her. 

**Jojen**
Integral in getting Bran to the Three Eyed Raven he isn't a faceless man but he was sent by magic and does talk to a flaming hand that shows him the future possibly. 

**Three Eyed Raven** probably used Jojen to get Bran to him so he could pass his mantle on to him. How many of the other pieces was he moving?


Dany and Jon - 
Well with so many lords dead it has come down to just Cersei, Jaime, Tyrion Euron, Theon, Jon, Arya, Sansa and Dany now.

Jaime, Tyrion have joined Dany. Sansa and Arya have been shepherded to the North.  Its basically everyone vs Euron and Cersei in terms of the human side of the game of thrones.

Dany is the breaker of chains and so much of her story has been about battling slavery and considering the Faceless men came from that, its interesting. The LOL also now backs her. In addition she almost had Drogo as her consort...their child would have been a slave owner as the Dothraki were not changing their ways and a ""witch"" killed him and this allowed her to fully embrace the zero tolerance on slavery which she would have had to compromise with Drogo over. 

You can add Drogo to the list of lords killed by one of these characters like the ones above who despise their masters/lords. 

For Jon, he was killed due to his willingness to help the Wildlings, humans treated as badly as slaves and ""magic"" LOL or whatever force brought him back. 

It would seem the gods, destiny, Bran/Three Eyed Raven or maybe just pure luck cleared the path and eliminated almost all competition for them to rise up and really didn't like Lords. Only Cersei remains...and we know she will be cast down by someone younger, a ""witch"" (no coincidence) told her. ",8,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

That being said, the show does have it's flaws.  These flaws, in my mind, can be traced back to when the show out wrote the GRRM books.  Granted, GRRM has said that he has contributed certain major story points (such as ""Hold the Door"") but doesn't want to reveal everything to the show runners for the sake of not spoiling his books.  Out writing the books has come to be a blessing and a curse.  On one hand, we get to see a possible two differing outcomes, and on the other hand the TV show will never be written as well or as thoughtfully as it could have been had it been fully based on the genius writing mind that is GRRM.  

&amp;#x200B;

The show since then has taken the safe route.  They've done things that I don't believe GRRM would have ever written.  He has a tendency to not really care about characters finishing their arc and write based on what would actually happen.  An example of this would be Oberyn Martel who could have had the poetic kill of Ser Gregor, Rob taking revenge on the death of his father etc, we all know how those ended.  Especially in the 7th season, I've noticed OBVIOUS cop-outs taken by the writers just for the sake of fan service and not having the balls to kill off certain characters.  Now I need to state that I'm not rooting for the deaths of main characters just for shock value, but something needs to happen when it makes sense in my opinion.  The journey beyond the wall only killed random people from Beric's crew (excluding Thoros), Jaime and Bronn surviving the Dragon attacks, etc.  And frankly, I'm sick of the show writing themselves into holes, and then having to write themselves a deus ex machina to save the day.  

&amp;#x200B;

This is one of my main predictions/gripes: I never liked the way that Arya killed Walder and his sons.  It made sense for her to do it, but not in the way she did it.  The whole faceless mask thing is cheap in my opinion.  I predict that somewhere in the final season, this will be exploited at least once, or maybe even more.  For example, somebody is going to be in deep shit, like idk Bran being corned by Jaime and Cersei, and SIKE it was Arya in a Jaime mask the whole time! And she kills Cersei.  Not a perfect example but you get the idea. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does anybody else get mad about stuff like this? Or fear the show is going to turn into stuff like this for the sake of a happy ending for fan service? ",8,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

However more on the Tyrion is a targaryean front : I thought this to be debunked as Cersei witness his birth and killing their mother . However I picked up on something . 

 you killed my mother  Tyrion replied  she was my mother , too  this seems simple but Cersei already would know that obviously I am thinking because Tyrion shared a different father that it lapses Cerseis mind that he in fact still had the same mother .
Another part of that Cersei says and now  theyre gone . If its the same mom it would be now shes gone but I think because Cersei knows he is the product of king aerys rape of their mother and Tyrion killing Joanna Lannister when he was born that their mother was being counted as two . And not giving him the satisfaction of them sharing the same mother yet stating that even though they are one in the same  they are gone  

I believe mad king aerys raped Joanne Lannister and Tyrion is the product of that relationship

This one went something like this - Cersei puts wildfire underneath the dragon pit, and after the Battle of Winterfell where the Night King is killer by Bran essentially sacrificing himself, Jon and Dany fly the dragons to Kings Landing to fight Cersei. Somehow, Arya ends up killing Cersei and when the dragons get to the pit they blow fire that causes the wildfire beneath to erupt and the everyone there dies including Jon and Dany. But Dany delivers a baby before this - Jons baby. That baby lives and ends up being raised by Tyrion and Missandei who get married. Sansa married Gendry and is Lady of Winterfell.

Wow.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/aqalq7/spoilers_could_this_be_what_the_mockingbird/,ChayaFeige,1550087185,"Mockingbird Feather Trailer

After getting drunk and bedding Lysa thinking it was Cat, Petyr Baelish challenged Bran Stark to a duel over Cat, he lost but lived as Cat pleaded with Bran not to kill him. Littlefinger later learned it was Lysa, not Cat that crawled into his bed, then he was very unceremoniously sent on his way by the Tullys for insulting Cats honor, when he was well enough to travel.

The trailer shows a Mockingbird feather drop from the stone hand of Lyannas statue in the Stark Crypt. After landing on the floor it appears to become covered in snow.

Recall how, as he stands before the statue with Sansa and he listens to her recite the story of the abduction and rape of Lyanna by Rheagar. He casts a look at her, with a slightly knowing smirk. Everyone just thinks Littlefinger knows Lyanna went willingly. But, maybe the smirk means something else, even more!

Early in the series, Littlefinger told two of the prostitutes in his brothel the story of the duel and the scar he still has. Littlefinger then said something to the effect that hes learned. Hes not going to do things their way again. I wont fight them, Ill f-ck them!

After being fooled by Lysa, treated rudely and roughly by his betters for his presumption, with Bran Stark humiliating him, Brans future in-laws showEd him to the door, 

In the books, on his way home, he happened to lodge and witness Rheagar and Lyanna eloping.

Lyanna was Brans sister. Did Littlefinger find a way into her wedding bed, taking Kings first privilege with her by putting something in their wine?

While we see, through Brandons greensight, the wedding ceremony between Rheagar and Lyanna meaning  that her child was conceived after marriage, is it possible the Mockingbird secretly planted his seed?  

Is the big reveal that, no, Jon IS NOT the legitimate son of Rheagar Targaryien, but Littlefingers surprise revenge bastard? Well, at least, through Lyanna, Stark blood still runs through his veins. Its ok. Hes used to being a bastard. Jon Snow stays Jon Snow. ",13,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

The one character that I see many people putting in their top 5 lists (usually at #1) is Jon Snow, and I don't see it. Yeah, he's clearly the hero, but I really don't think it's deserved.

During my recent rewatch, I was just kind of bored whenever the show shifted to him. I wasn't exactly sure why, but I just wanted to get back to the other characters as soon as  he came on screen. I like Tyrion, the Hound, Sanza, Arya, Jaime and Cercei because they seem to grow and respond to conflict in dynamic ways. Sure, Jon is less naive and arrogant than when he left for the wall, but let's be real - he messed up very badly at the battle of the bastards and no one cares. That episode  encapsulates all the problems I have with him.

Every other Stark as stubborn as him has already died. The exceptions are Sanza and Arya - they have shown brilliant adaptability and are still around because of it, while Jon's stubbornness literally got him killed at castle black. He got resurrected and it's just a part of a pattern of unusual luck. (Remember when Halfhand spontaneously made Jon kill him, even though Jon had just supremely messed up by getting the entire party killed? I bought it, but yeah, that kind of luck) He should have died at the battle of the bastards when he charged in by himself. He even knew it as he saw the horses charging toward him, but he bravely drew his sword and prepared to die. He didn't die though. His men charged in and saved him. There is this amazing scene full of CG horses and men smashing into each other all around him, he almost gets killed multiple times in this sequence but manages to avoid even getting a scratch as he awkwardly stumbles through the chaos. He makes a classic blunder and leads his followers into an encirclement (aka you're screwed in military terms). If Sanza hadn't rescued him with an army she wrangled from Little Finger, he'd be buried under corpses in the mud, or flayed, or fed to dogs - but dead for sure.

Then, as if he learned absolutely nothing about the danger of charging in by yourself, he leaves his entire army without saying anything to Sanza and charges the gates of Winterfell in persute of Ramsay. The Giant, bless his heart, follows Jon and opens the gate for him, dying right after. Then Jon, like the stubborn, awkward hero he is, decides to charge Ramsay with only a shield. He's got allies all around him, but he's Jon, so again he charges Ramsay by himself. He does the classic manly hero finish - gets out his emotions by punching Ramsay in the face a lot. 

I think we all of breathed a sigh of relief knowing that Winterfell was back in Stark hands, because it seemed unlikely that Ramsay would be beat. *Could Jon actually die here?*  I thought during my first watch. But on a second rewatch, I was able to look past those emotions and see that this episode highlighted Jon's remarkably sluggish growth as a character: *of course he immediately stormed the gate by himself. Sanza saved him. Being stubborn and cocky has never not worked for him*. Insult to injury is that he actually never thanks Sanza for it - they just move on and he is king of the north. Compared to the friction around Jon's choices at castle black, it's remarkable how tone deaf the entire show is to Jon's terrible leadership that day. When he decides to leave and visit Dany shortly after, his bannerman aren't happy about it, but no one brings up anything substantial about his questionable judgement as a leader and he goes, again leaving it up to Sanza to hold the fort. If I were a wildling being promised a peaceful life from this guy, I'd look around at all my dead friends and leave. 

I for one, am not terribly excited about the rest of Jon's story because I think it will just be more of this undeserved super hero luck. things just working out for Jon Snow because he's Jon Snow. Ingrid's dead and she was the only one that knew he knew nothing.

Melisandre says in the books ""When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers, Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt.""

And the Prophecy: There will come a day after a long summer when the stars bleed andthe cold breath of darkness falls heavy on the world. In this dread hour a warrior shall draw from the fire a burning sword. And that sword shall beLightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes, and he who clasps it shall be Azor Ahai come again, and the darkness shall flee before him.

I think that this red star &amp; bleeding stars is a celestial phenomenon. We get references of a red comet in season 1. We see one the day before Daenyres emerges from the fire with her dragons &amp; also when the Starks at Winterfell learn of Ned's death. 

Perhaps another will appear in season 8 but this one would cover the sun &amp; bring darkness like an eclipse. 

After the darkness the Prophecy makes reference to a fire from which Azor Ahai will draw Lightbringer from. Perhaps a fire will be caused by a comet striking Westeros, which would make the fire perhaps supernatural that the WW fear or they light a bonfire to light the darkness in same fashion as the Red Priests do. 

Melisandre refers to smoke &amp; salt from which Azor Ahai will be born amidst. The smoke is likely from the fire mentioned. But salt could either be tears due to the death of a loved one or a simile for snow which would mean the North, likely Winterfell. 

In the Azor Ahai legend, Lightbringer was forged by plunging the blade through his wife's breast. So will a hero have to do the same, hence the salt of tears? Maybe Jon &amp; Daenyres? Jamie &amp; Cercei or even Brienne? It might not be lovers &amp; perhaps Arya &amp; Sansa or Bran or Jon &amp; Arya/Sansa.  ",6,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

After 3 scenes of torture which seemed to have no relevance on the story and made me feel pretty sick, I feel like this is just tasteless, sick and disgusting torture porn and it's honestly making me not want to watch the show anymore because it's so out of line with the quality of everything else. Yes, GOT is a vile and nasty show, but I don't feel like it's ever been tastelessly sick up to this point. The Red Wedding for example was shocking and horrible but actually had emotional impact and relevance whereas Theon's torture is just pointless and feels like cruelty for the sake of cruelty. It's not helped by the fact that the guy playing Ramsay Bolton is playing the role terribly (IMO). I'm basically just making this post to ask if this storyline improves at all? When should I stop skipping through the torture scenes? I have no desire to watch cruelty if it isn't relevant. Also, how much worse does the violence/cruelty get in the show overall?

Full interpretation of all components as pointing to Jaime Lannister

Red star bleeds and the darkness gathers.- the comet seen during A Clash of Kings and the the evidence winter is coming 

reborn amid smoke and salt, I think the moral rebirth started with the slaying of the mad king.

I explain here [https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/aop1d5/spoilers\_how\_jamie\_lannister\_was\_reborn\_amid/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/aop1d5/spoilers_how_jamie_lannister_was_reborn_amid/)

He or she will wake dragons out of stone. I believe this has been slightly garbled over time and originally read wakes the Dragons out of Dragon Stone.

Once the conflict began, Aerys II ordered the Queen and Viserys taken from the castle and brought to Dragonstone for safety. Jaime remained with the King. Once Jaime slayed the Mad dog which was witnessed, he waited until Baratheon arrived to claim the Throne.  

But Jaimes oath included protecting the royal family as well, so, even though he put the Mad Dog down, he left the Castle, riding for Dragonstone, to wake the Dragons (Queen and Prince) and, with Darry and three others, took them safely into exile, out of Baratheons reach.  

Here is where I explain why I believe Jaime is one of the four unnamed loyalists who assisted Darry.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/ap9xh9/spoilers\_trying\_to\_figure\_who\_were\_the\_four\_who/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/ap9xh9/spoilers_trying_to_figure_who_were_the_four_who/)

He will reforge the great flaming sword Lightbringer, which the original Hero made by plunging the blade into the heart of his beloved wife. 

Its safe to assume the new sword will require a similar sacrifice. Here, I believe he will take the two swords made from Starks sword Ice (Oathbreaker renamed Oathkeeper and Widows Wail) and forge them back into one. It is known that blood sacrifice is needed in forging Valerian steel blades.

Seems we might think Cersei is the prime candidate for wife as well as a widow and an oathbreaker.  

This scenario is also consistent with the valonquar prophesy.  

Further, the image of Jaime holding Cerseis heel as he followed her out of the womb, is reminiscent of the story of Achilles heel. And it does seem as weaknesses go, Jaime may well be her Achilles heel.

Sure I had to fast forward through the Theon torture seasons, but the show was amazing for 40 episodes.  The first 7 episodes of season 5 are a tough watch.  I do feel like once Hardhome starts, the show is back on track.  I also really like seasons 6 &amp; 7.

I also don't fully blame David &amp; Dan as they were given source material that was almost unfilmable. 

A few reasons why Season 5 suffered so badly compared to the rest of the series....

1) A lot of great characters from the first 4 seasons are missing.  Tywin (dead), Joffrey (dead), Bran (season off), and The Hound (season off) were noticablely missing and it hurt the quality of the show.

2) Too many story lines.  While the first 4 seasons flowed nicely, it felt like some characters had too much time off between scenes.

3) Barristan Selmy's death felt like a huge miscalculation.  It fell completely flat and didnt do the character justice.

4) Sansa's rape.  I will leave it at that. 

5) Shireen Baratheon burnt alive.  Just horrible and I felt sick watching it. 

6) The High Sparrow story line makes me think Cersei is one of the dumbest characters in all of television.  The walk of shame is also depressing to watch. 

I'm glad the show got back on track near the end of the season.  What did you think of season 5? Do you hate it as much as I do?",30,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

My girlfriend brought up a good question that I had never considered - is it possible that he had some sort of vision of the future and saw that the White Walkers were coming and that is what drove him mad? and as a result he was saying ""burn them all"" in regards to the White Walkers?

BLOOD MAGIC

Rhllor

I suspect Rhllor is actually more of a blood magic cult and not a religion like the other faiths. Maybe the great other is Death, but I believe there is some deceit going on that the God of light and life and warmth is not an actual God but mortal blood magic, possibly necromancy. I suspect Kinvara understands this but almost all other followers, like Melisandre, dont. The Night is dark and full of terror! Great recruitment propaganda.

What if the lord of light in Rhllor is just an excuse to practice necromancy by burning or otherwise sacrificing living humans before death is supposed to give them the gift. The priests can absorb and store that excess life force, using it to maintain failing or dead bodies, raise the dead and cast a glamour to make them appear young and beautiful.  

I would figure that Death is not happy about this theft of life based on a forensic psychological profile of the GoT God Death, here (chill, I am mocking my own effort, a bit). [https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/apy861/spoilers\_only\_one\_god\_death\_what\_do\_we\_know\_about/ ](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/apy861/spoilers_only_one_god_death_what_do_we_know_about/)It contradicts his sense of balance. It is a gross distortion of the law of a life for a life.  

When Jaqen tells Arya the story of the destruction of Valyria, it sounds as if the slaves being kept artificially alive in unbearable conditions in the mines, we find the origin of the Faceless Men, the source of the gift that relieved these slaves of their suffering. It appears so many in and running\* the system were given the gift that it might very well explain the Doom.

The Disappearance and Return of Dragons

I checked various timelines about when the last dragon died. There were plenty of eggs but none would hatch. Additionally Tyrion told us that the dragons born grew smaller and smaller. He attributed it to them being caged, as Dany had caged her own.  

The forty years before the last dragon of the Targaryen dynasty died could be described as the calm after the conquest and bloody civil war. It appears the first 20 of those 40 years, Westeros was decimated and slowly rebuilding after a long age of bloody war characterized by dragons burning and melting castles and roasting fields of soldiers where they stood. Then came 20 years of peace under one of the better rulers.  

I hypothesize that it takes a huge amount of blood sacrifice to hatch a dragons egg. None were hatching because the sacrificial fires of war had burned themselves out. Once there were no more dragons it became difficult if not impossible to create the kind of sacrifice a dragon can make of a field of 10,000 soldiers.

Now we come to Dany hatching her dragons. But, you say, the funeral pier contained only 3 people. Yes, but the prior week the Dothraki were committing wholesale slaughter and pillage for Dany, to buy her a fleet of ships. Jorun has to explain this to Dany as they walk through the devastation.

When Dany went into labor, Jorun carried her back into the tent where Mirri was doing her blood magic. Mirri said,  Death would be dancing in the tent tonight. It appears Dany was in some kind of an altered state as she did not even know she had miscarried the next day. I hypothesize that during this altered state she learned of the life energy that had been collected for her in the pillaging, and how to use it. She was a dragon and went unburnt as she poured all the life energy collected in her honor into the pyre. It was enough to hatch the eggs.

Dany does not yet understand what Kinvara understands 

It is very unclear if Dany actually understands the nature, magnitude or mechanics of the blood magic she did to hatch the eggs. Further, it appears as if it is a one-time event in her life. It does not appear she is going into the Dragon Egg hatching business.

But not that there are dragons again, very powerful magic can restart with the dragons ability to create the massive blood sacrifices of old.

The leaders of the Temple of Rhllor heard and could feel the return of massive sacrifices. Dany being their queen was predicated on her bring back dragons.

Politically, it is fantastic to have an ally like the faith of Rhllor and their priestesses to amass the power to take the Iron Throne. 

QUEEN AND PRINCES

Queen Dany

But does Dany really understand WHY she is their queen?

Kinvara is almost giddy with delight at the prospect of burning all the non-believers on a whole new continent as she speaks with Varys and Tyrion.

The White Walkers are responding to the reemergence of this blood magic on an massive scale with the rebirth of the dragons on the other side of the world.

Im still not sure what their waking means. Is it possible that there is symmetry between the amount of blood Fire magic and blood ice magic. 

Will Dany still WANT to be Queen when she learns of the blood magic?

I believe the answer is no. She wants to end slavery. I cant imagine her rationalizing innocent blood sacrifice.

She wants to BREAK the wheel, not sit at the top of it.

Will she wish to cede her claim to the throne to Jons claim? I think neither would like to claim the throne to continue the Targaryen dynasty in this circumstance.

But somehow the blood fire magic Dany has woken in the world needs to be quelled, balanced with the blood ice magic.

How this will end?

I believe Varys and Jaime and Jon will be able to keep Dany from falling under the control of Kenvara.

TWO PRINCES

I have said before, there are not one but two Princes Who Were Promised.

The first is Jaime fulfilling the amid smoke and salt prophecy. The second Prince is Jon. He is a part of the human tribute owed the walkers in the peace pact of the war of the dawn. This is a hypothesis, we have not yet learned of this prince with the exception that Rhaegar was damn sure he needed to produce one. I further hypothesize he is needed to replace the aging Night King. .Here, we have the marriage of ice and fire, returning things to balance.  

Vague further thoughts...

But maybe the wheel completely breaks. Maybe Dany steps in as the Promised Prince of the Walkers, and leaves Jon Lord of the North. She did feel it was her destiny to be queen, right?

In the end we find Jaime on the Throne. Tyrion, Lord of Casterly Rock, happily married to Sansa, and maybe Dany gives birth to an unusual baby that ends the need for baby tributes?  Arya? AWOL.",2,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Maybe Jorah knows a faster way to Mereen.., sure... but as much time, events, and accomplishments as Tyrion was able to do in his time there? From slave to councilor? Varys had plenty of time, and yet shows up just as Daenerys disappears... and right before she comes back? He disappears.

I actually like the character, but the level of annoyance to watch that? I wish Daenerys wouldve fed him to the dragons after all, that was no coincidence and I have three dragon eggs to sell to anyone who thinks it was.

While rewatching I was wondering what is house tully's plan ?

Context:

House Tully joins the Starks rebellion against the crownd. It makes sense because of Catelyn and the fact that Tywin had started harrassing them.

But then comes the war of the five Kings:
- Robb declares himself King in the North.
- Renly might be comprehensive.
- Stannis and Jeoffrey both consider any rebellion as treason.

So what is the plan for house Tully ? Specially after Renly dies ? If they actually win, what happens to them ?
- Otpion 1: They join the North Kingdom. 
   =&gt; While the North is easy to defend (at least against land attacks). The geography of the riverlands will make it extremely complicated for them ... They basically are in the middle of everybody.
-Option 2: They rejoin the ""Southern kingdom"" after the war.
   =&gt; After joining a separatist force ... The negotiations will be awkward and probably at their disadvantage. Specially with Stannis and is inflexibility (ie: Davos).
- Option 3: They proclame their independence. 
  =&gt; Would work if everybody did the same (back to before Aegon time). But if they were to stand against an alliance, they wouldn't stand a chance. 
- Option 4: They take the Throne for themselves and keep the South while leaving the North to Robb. 
  =&gt; Probably the only option that will make sense. But, I never heard of such ambition.


So it seems that Robb proclaiming himself King in the North puts house Tully in an awkward position. Is this ever covered in the books or show ?

While rewatching I was wondering what is house tully's plan ?

Context:

House Tully joins the Starks rebellion against the crownd. It makes sense because of Catelyn and the fact that Tywin had started harrassing them.

But then comes the war of the five Kings:
- Robb declares himself King in the North.
- Renly might be comprehensive.
- Stannis and Jeoffrey both consider any rebellion as treason.

So what is the plan for house Tully ? Specially when Renly dies ? If they actually win, what happens to them ?
- Otpion 1: They join the North Kingdom. 
   =&gt; While the North is easy to defend (at least against land attacks). The geography of the riverlands will make it extremely complicated for them ... They basically are in the middle of everybody.
-Option 2: They rejoin the ""Southern kingdom"" after the war.
   =&gt; After joining a separatist force ... The negotiations will be awkward and probably at their disadvantage. Specially with Stannis and is inflexibility (ie: Davos).
- Option 3: They proclame their independence as well. 
  =&gt; Would work if everybody did the same (back to before Aegon time). But if they were to stand against an alliance, they wouldn't have a chance. 
- Option 4: They take the Throne for themselves and keep the South while leaving the North to Robb. 
  =&gt; Probably the only option that will make sense. But, I never heard of such ambition.


So it seems that Robb proclaiming himself King in the North puts house Tully in an awkward position. Is this ever covered in the books or show ?

My thoughts

1. You could say it wasn't Dany's decision. Sure, but as a sibling wouldn't you at least protest? You don't know what kind of impact that could have made. IMO it was a moral failing for her to not speak out when Drogo looked her way
2. Him threatening her/her unborn child with a sword was shocking and wrong. Not worthy of death from her perspective though. Unless he was a serious threat which he was not. Remember, this was the man who cared for her as a baby when they were on the streets with nothing. You can't expect him to be a perfect gentlemen.
3. The holy violation aspect: Do you believe Sharia law's harsh sentences are just in this world? If not, what elevates Dothraki law in your eyes

I interpret Dany's inaction as a cruel act and possibly a power grab if she had been wishing for it for a while. Maybe I'm way off base though. What are your thoughts?",22,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

* Biggest moment: There is no other answer.

It's the moment Game of Thrones show-watchers first realized no one was safe. No one. Sean Bean was the biggest star in the show (at the time). No one really believed he was going to die (unless you read the books).
* Episode MVP: Joffrey. His decision dominates this episode, this season and is the biggest moment until we get to the Red Wedding.
* Final thought: While the final scene owns this episode, there are other important moments. One that leads to the greatest WTF moment in GoT history: Robb's promise to marry a Frey.

Both are very knowledgable in both show and book notes.

They broke down the odds of Who Will Sit the Iron Throne (according to Vegas):

*  Bran is the leader right now at +150

* Jon at 2/1

* Dany at 3/1

* Sansa at 7/1

*NK at 7/1

*Tyrion at 8/1

*Arya at 16/1

*Cersei at 16/1

*Jaime at 16/1

*Gendry 16/1

*Sam 25/1

Pretty interesting they have Bran right now as the leader, but maybe because people are banking on the Bran=NK theory?

Probably most safe bet is Jon or Dany, but the long shot I like is actually Arya....heres why (i have no real evidence just my thought):

Jaime will vanquish quite early on, in turn, Arya will sacrifice his face to The Faceless God, thus making his identity usable to TFM.  She will use that face, to infiltrate Kings Landing, and assassinate Cersei, fulfilling the Valonqar prophecy and completing her List, and killing the Mad Queen.  She will sit the Iron Throne, just as Jaime did when Ned found him after he killed The Mad King.",35,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Naturally, this entire post contains spoilers, since some people's Pokmon elemental typings are based on things only revealed in later seasons. If you guys like this analysis, I can do summaries of each season in separate posts (trust me, I have it all worked out). So without further ado, let's introduce the major players of the Game of Thrones!

&amp;#x200B;

**Eddard, Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran, Rickon Stark: Ice**

The Starks are Ice type, no brainer here. Sansa, Arya, and Bran each gain an additional type further down the line, but starting in season one, it's just Ice for now.

&amp;#x200B;

**Catelyn Stark: Ice**

Despite being a Tully, Catelyn has been Lady Stark for so long that she actually has traits of the Starks more than the Tullys. Otherwise, she'd be Water type.

&amp;#x200B;

**Jon Snow: Ice/Dragon**

Born and bred as a Stark, Jon is Ice type like his ""half-siblings."" However, due to his true parentage, he's also Dragon type. Too bad he doesn't learn any Dragon-type moves until much later!

&amp;#x200B;

**Viserys, Daenerys Targaryen: Dragon**

Another no brainer, the descendants of dragon riders are Dragon type. And Daenerys's ability is probably Flash Fire since she's fireproof.

&amp;#x200B;

**Jaime Lannister: Fighting**

The Lannisters are where things get dicey, since they're so much more different from each other than families like the Starks. Being one of the best swordsmen in the Seven Kingdoms, Jaime cleanly lands in the Fighting type.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cersei Lannister: Dark**

I think this doesn't need explanation, right? I'm too lazy to do an entire writeup if it does.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tyrion Lannister: Psychic**

And to round out the typing trifecta, the man with the mind uses his imp powers to play the game of thrones like a fiddle. For a time, anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tywin Lannister: Ground/Fighting**

Having a huge, well-trained and -provisioned army (as well as owning lots of gold mines) gives Tywin his Ground type, with a secondary Fighting type. I would've considered giving him Psychic type, but that's not how things worked out in the show.

&amp;#x200B;

**Robert Baratheon: Fighting**

Gods, he was strong then. But Robert stopped leveling up a long time ago, and can't keep up with current goings-on.

&amp;#x200B;

**Stannis Baratheon: Steel/Fire**

Honestly, Stannis's typing lends itself more to his iron will than any other attribute. However, his secondary Fire type is completely dependent on Melissandre. More on that in any follow-up post.

&amp;#x200B;

**Renly Baratheon: Normal**

Boy, what a regular dude Renly is. Not his homosexuality (which is taboo even in Westeros, eh?), but the fact that he doesn't really do anything. At least nothing important enough to make me feel his typing needs to be anything special.

&amp;#x200B;

**Joffrey Baratheon: Fairy**

Fitting that an insult referring to men who are pussies could describe Joff's type. You're welcome to guess why more specifically I chose Fairy though!

&amp;#x200B;

**Varys: Ghost**

The guy who's always lurking in the shadows. The guy who's immune to the actions of both Normal and Fighting types. The guy who always has something wise to say to Tyrion. Yeah, I think Ghost fits just fine.

&amp;#x200B;

**Petyr Baelish: Poison**

Slimy, sneaky, conniving Littlefinger. This guy learned the move Toxic and has used it as many times as he could. Varys would've sprayed this guy in the face with Antidote if he had any.

&amp;#x200B;

**Olenna, Margaery Tyrell: Grass**

Honestly, this is just to fit the motif. But I suppose Grass types are all about storing power, with moves like Leech Seed, Giga Drain, and Solar Beam. Growing strong, but getting Fire Blasted before you can make your power move.

&amp;#x200B;

**Mace, Loras Tyrell: Normal/Grass**

Compared to the matriarchs of their family, these dudes are boring, borderline useless characters that get knocked over like chess pawns. Very watered down.

&amp;#x200B;

**Roose, Ramsay Bolton: Steel**

The Bolton's words are ""Our blades are sharp."" Need I say more? Fine, fine. Nerves of steel, cold as steel, and as double-edged as the daggers they plunge in their enemies' hearts.

&amp;#x200B;

**Walder Frey: Rock**

He's got two big stone towers, and the Water-type Tullys have owned his ass his whole life. And he and the Boltons are strong against Ice type. Hm

&amp;#x200B;

**The Greyjoys: Water**

Please don't make me explain this one.

&amp;#x200B;

**Oberyn Martell: Flying**

I'm not the only one who saw how he moved with that spear, right? What a breezy mofo. And he would've totally slaughtered Tywin, given the chance (looking at that Ground immunity).

&amp;#x200B;

**The Sands: Rock/Ground**

One of the most boring type combinations in all the Pokmon games. And guess who has double disadvantage when fighting Greyjoys?

&amp;#x200B;

Am I missing something from the books that *needs* to happen to him or that *needs* to do in order for the end game to be a fuller, more complete finish than it would be if they were to have just tied up his/their archs in season 6 or whenever?

I have my own theories on where things might go for them, and I do feel like it'd be interesting to see those theories come in to play, but they still just don't convince me that they're worth spending our very last 6 episodes on. So, what are some of yall's theories on how spending some of the little time we have left on Theon and Yara is going to be detrimental to the end game and actually worth our while more so than some other arch's that need to be completed in order for our end game to be fully finished?",18,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

She was buddying up to the sparrow, and brought Tommen into the faith, and I don't believe for a second it was sincere. She was a true player in the game of thrones, and she was definitely playing at something.  
She learns that Olenna may be in danger and she gives her a drawing of a rose, prompting her to leave the city.  
Then she died before she could really make her move.  
I assume her plan was to win over the High Sparrow, join forces with him, and use him and his followers to defeat Cersei?    
And if so, was she really willing to allow her brother to repent and renounce his titles, effectively ending the possibility of a Tyrell heir, and letting the family die out? Or do you think she had a plan to beat the Sparrow? Or is there something else I'm missing entirely?

In preparation for season 8 my wife and I are watching the entire series and just finished season 5. I decided to watch season 5 with 1 caveat. We were going to skip all Arya in Bravost scenes. 

It helped soooo soooo much. Her scenes are too long and drag out and are not particularly interesting to watch. I already know that what she can do (from my 1st watch) so seeing it again adds little. 

On my 3rd watch season is no longer the huge dip it felt like before. It just moves along better.

So basically the Arya in Bravost stuff is absolutely nessessarary in the big picture, but my skipping the scenes in repeat viewings it raise my opinion of season 5 immensely. ",24,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Each day, we'll take a look at an episode of Game of Thrones leading up to the launch of the premiere. It's a chance to talk about your favorite moments and lines... or complain about something you didn't like.

Today, it's ""Fire and Blood"":

* Game of Thrones wiki summary: [https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Fire\_and\_Blood](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Fire_and_Blood)
* Biggest moment: The final episode of season 1 wasn't likely to top Ned losing his head. How could it? But the major moment we did get may end up being more significant. Dragons have returned. I'm not sure what Dany expected to happen, when she built Drogo's funeral pyre and joined him in it, but it couldn't have worked out better for her. And it's the spark that launched the most formidable threat the Iron Throne.
* Episode MVP: Daenerys. There's not other choice. Most of the episode was moving pieces for next season. But Dany emerged as the Unburnt and the Mother of Dragons. Her list of titles would only continue to grow.
* Final thought: The rest of the episode was a downer compared to Episode 9, but we'd come to learn that is the way Game of Thrones seasons will work.",6,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

You shall hear no Lions roar.

No Roses shall bloom from the meadows.

When winter wreaks havoc on the land,
You can bet therell be no Snakes in the sand.

When winter brings to life all it finds grim,
The Krakens will freeze where they swim.

When winter sets and the land begins to shiver,
The Flayed Man will start to rot and wither.

When winter fights to the last sliver,
No more Trouts shall swim in the river.

When winter ravages and all despair,
No Falcons shall fly high in the air.

It's just such a good burn that I kind of passed over the first time.

Arya recognizes this and chooses to roast him over it, countering his observation about her character with her own.

*And then* it's made better because Tywin *recognizes it* as an insult. With any other servant it would just be some inane question from some uneducated peon, asking a question for the sake of it.

You have to think like GRRM. Hes a pacifist. The story is not going to end with the genocide of an entire species (the white walkers). It is going to end with Jon (and danaerys) doing what they always do; bringing different groups of people together, uniting them for the common good, seeing past the differences. It has been a pattern since the beginning of the show (im a book reader too). there is going to be a pact made between the WW and the ppl of Westeros, brokered by John. There was a pact made 8000 years ago, between the two groups before, and thats why the WW have left the ppl alone, until now something has changed we dont know what. 
The prophecy of Azor Ahai:  for John to fulfill the prophecy, which GRRM always says the religions and prophecies arent literal. They have been changed and misinterpreted by the believers over time. Some things have been taken literal when they are actually a metaphor. John and Dany will make a pact to marry (or sacrifice herself) Dany to a WW. There will be a sword plunged into her heart (Valyrian or dragon glass) and she will turn into a WW, forging light bringer which is actually a metaphor for peace. There will be much grief over this decision but there is no other way. 
This doesnt cover the entire end, what happens to ppl like bran the hound and Beric, ppl who have been hinted to have huge roles in the end of the Great War. I have theories on this as well. Its just that so many theories I have heard are so far fetched, too complicated, they dont take into account certain things - like the little finger will sit on the iron throne , if anything, the night king will sit on the throne.

1. Roberts first kill in the field using a hammer. Gendrys weapon of choice is a hammer.

2. Tyrion loves his family. He states this constantly in jest and in truth. He says as much to Cersei in their private meeting despite having murdered Tywin. I believe his loyalty to his own family may be his undoing. 

3. Arya in the dungeons at Kings Landing listening to Varys and Ilyrio plotting but getting the message wrong. Arya now is definitely a finder and keeper of information and notices everything after her FM training.

4. The Winterfell crypts and Stark devotion to the remains of their dead from Roberts anger at Lyannas body lying there in the cold, Brans first vision as the 3ER leads him to the crypts. It where Sansa and Arya finally reunite after leaving as children. Clearly the crypts/dead Starks are key to  finish of the fight with the WW. 

5. Jaimes mockery of the Nights Watch and teasing Jon Snow at Winterfell. Jaime leaving his sister behind and marching North to fight the WW beside Jon Snow is something Im really looking forward too.

Id love to hear what people think of this question, and the reasons theyd bring back certain characters. 

Rules:

1) They must have appeared in the TV Show and died, not simply been mentioned. 

2) They will return and act within their characters pre-death personality/motives/etc. 

You can argue that death and the emptiness of it (speaking from Jons experience) may have changed them and their perspective drastically, but I think its easier and more fun to think about their pre-death character within the context of the current S8 storyline.

Ill go first:

Tywin Lannister. I truly think he would side with Jaime in his attempt to get Cersei to contribute to the battle against the NK. Tywin is ruthless and fiercely protective of his family and legacy, but hes not an idiot and certainly not as paranoid as Cersei has become. Jaimes plea to Cersei in S7 is that at the end of the war, someone will win. If its the living, theyll remember that the Lannisters did nothing to help. That will certainly tarnish a legacy, and helping save the realm is a way to save face for the family. Adding Tywin to what will be a very tense situation at Winterfell would be interesting to watch, and his experience as a battle commander would be increasingly helpful. Also, it would add a crazy wrinkle if he actually sided with Cersei, making her even more of a threat.

I also loved the scene where Jamie releases Tyrion, and Tyrion makes Jamie think that he has actually killed Joffrey. Rob Stark's death was very sad, but Ygritte's was worse in my opinion.

For me the two arcs I would've liked to have seen are one from the books and the other I came up with myself.

The first one is obviously keeping Sansa in the Vale, we did not need her becoming a victim of abuse again. Especially since we already have had a lot of questionable decisions and dark moments in S5 already let Sansa have her plot line in the books, and if they needed her in the North by S6 then just have stay in the Vale then when S6 comes around she can manipulate LF and Yohn Royce into travelling North to see if rumors of Jon's death are true and also to take back WF from the Bolton's. As for the stuff with Ramsey in WF...Um...Either just cut out that plotline entirely and only have one or two scenes of Ramsey, Reek, and the others there at the time if you REALLY need them or...Just have it be like in the books where Jeyne Poole gets married off. I was very tempted by the way to say Young Griff but thinking about it, I think more that they should've let Sansa have her book arc...Even though I do think Sansa may have a similar situation on her hands in the books (just with that Harry Hardling guy instead of Ramsey).

As for the arc that I wanted to see that was not from the books and one I came up with myself. Well I thought it be interesting if it was maybe revealed in S7 or something that there is one more Bolton left in the form of a bastard child Ramsey or Roose had with someone random woman, and one of the other Northern houses were raising the child so that the Flayed Man can rise again. However this child would not have the same violent aspects of his family and is an actual good guy (maybe Arya even ends up ironically even falling for him). Though it's probably for the best they didn't do this one since first of all they didn't foreshadow that (like if it was the case then you'd thing Ramsey or Roose would allude to something like this) and also idk how they can make a member of that house likeable after what the other ones did.

Well that is just what I would've liked to have seen.",7,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

And we get a small sense of her power when she shows immunity to the poison. The role she plays will change the fortunes of some of the biggest characters in the show.

* Final thought: This is my favorite title of any episode of the entire season (and has become a go-to Fantasy Football team name).

1. Ancient Valyria was an an ancient city which had a powerful military, advanced architecture and mined rare materials such as valryian steel. Atlantis was also has a powerful military, built great architecture and mined precious and unique metals and ores.
2. Ancient Valyria conquered many lands and had colonised multiple cities which together became known as the ""Valyrian Freehold"". Atlantis had also colonised many parts of the world including parts of Europe, North Africa and even Egypt was once a colony of Atlantis.
3. They where both destroyed by a great cataclysm, Valyria was destroyed by its fire and Atlantis was destroyed by water and earthquakes and sunk into the depths of the ocean, both catastrophes were speculated to be a result of the moral degeneration of the two cities.
4. The survivors of Valyria attempted to migrate to one of their colonies ""Volantis"" after the cataclysm had destroyed their city, they attempted to re-start their once great city in Volantis but failed. Many believe that the Atlanteans migrated to one of their colonies which was Egypt and and attempted to re-build there once great city there but failed. (*ref. Edgar Cayce, Manly P.

1. Who are the white walkers? Specifically I mean are they all Craster's babies? Or can the Night King make anyone into a white walker? And this has me thinking, if he can make any adults into the white walker, then who are they? This is more of a speculative question I'm aware, but it's got me wondering if any significant people from the history of Westeros might be amongst the white walkers. People whose last known whereabouts was going north of the wall.

2. So question 2, I believe only the Night King can make white walkers? How does he do it? I assume it's like with the babies where he just pokes 'em in the face and job done you're a white walker now... kinda' makes me wonder why there aren't more white walkers. He's always flanked by three or four. Why does his squad never include more?

3. Talking about Craster's babies, you'd figure that while he has thousands of wights, he may have 20 to 50, to 100 white walkers.. considering how many of Craster's babies were sacrificed. I'm curious how it works when a baby becomes a white walker though, you know when we saw it's face going blue well does it then morph into a white walker there and then? Only we didn't see that, or does the Night King literally have baby white walkers and he has to wait for them to grow up? ..seems like a ridiculous concept. I'd find the morphing instantly.. or rapidly at least, more believable.

4. Can females not be made into white walkers? Why?

5. Are the white walkers aware of their previous human existence? Are the white walkers actually very much aware of being trapped in an undead state and maybe trying to set themselves free? (By dying) ..sounds kinda' convoluted though, if they're trying to make all of Westeros dead so that it somehow reverses what was done to them and allows them to die...

6. Oh yeah what's the obsession with the God's eye? And that spiral pattern in the cave paintings and how the stones were laid out by the tree where the Night King was made, and the way they laid out the corpses in episode 1:1 in the same pattern, what is that all about? That pattern is significant to them. Why? How significant is the God's Eye? Is it the source of their power? ..or something like that.

I'm aware most or all of these questions are speculative, but I'm interested if anyone knows something I don't or has ideas.",12,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

While I was rewatching this episode I noticed something that is actually super obvious:
Beric has this shiny sword that can be ignited by him so it turns into a flaming sword.. that wouldve been pretty useful for not freezing to death, don't you agree?
Did he not do it just so the Hound doesn't have to look away?

1. Ancient Valyria was an an ancient city which had a powerful military, advanced architecture and mined rare materials such as valryian steel. Atlantis was also has a powerful military, built great architecture and mined precious and unique metals and ores.
2. Ancient Valyria conquered many lands and had colonised multiple cities which together became known as the ""Valyrian Freehold"". Atlantis had also colonised many parts of the world including parts of Europe, North Africa and even Egypt was once a colony of Atlantis.
3. They where both destroyed by a great cataclysm, Valyria was destroyed by its fire and Atlantis was destroyed by water and earthquakes and sunk into the depths of the ocean, both catastrophes were speculated to be a result of the moral degeneration of the two cities.
4. The survivors of Valyria attempted to migrate to one of their colonies ""Volantis"" after the cataclysm had destroyed their city, they attempted to re-start their once great city in Volantis but failed. Many believe that the Atlanteans migrated to one of their colonies which was Egypt and and attempted to re-build there once great city there but failed. (*ref. Edgar Cayce, Manly P. Hall, Graham Hancock*)
5. The natives of Valyria were said to have fair/white skin, blonde hair and purple eyes.

Their magicians could raise great walls of water to protect their cities from fire dragons of the Valerians. The Rhoynar immigrated to Westeros in 100,000 ships. Mostly women and children, fleeing the Valerians. They knew how to work iron, which was superior to the bronze weapons of the first men. Their first king, the grey king, from who all iron born houses are descended despised the Weirwood trees that drank human blood. He had them all cut down to build ships. Great wood for that as it does not rot. He killed the great Nagga and made a crown from her teeth. Married a mermaid so all his children were comfortable on land and sea. Most of this is not in GoT, but clearly we have water people in the Ironborn. Im going to try to restrict my thoughts to GoT in the text below.

My last post I explained why I thought the God Rhllor was just a fiction to hide blood and fire necromancy conducted by humans, fueled by human burnt sacrifices.

This post I was to talk about how worship of the Drowned God, an evolved form of water God, may provide some surprising answers.

Ice is just frozen water, right? Gee, a Great Wall of water raised up to protect against fire dragons - if it is cold enough, could it be ice? And that crown on the Night Kings Head sure looks like a bunch of upward pointing fangs. And he is blue, the color of water, not white, like the white Walkers.

The Rhoynar came after the war between the CoF and first men. Clearly the ironborn, value Iron, talk about the Iron price, which means taking things using iron weapons. They do sacrifice by drowning or hanging (like Yara), they dont shed blood of sacrifices. They dont burn them like Rhllor, or slaughter them to feed the blood to the weirtrees like the CoF.

So, sequence of events- war between CoF and First Men, creation of Night King, peace pact. Then Night King turns against both CoF - another war, Night King and Walkers on far side of ice wall another peace pact.

Why did Night King turn against CoF?  

We know CoF worshiped all nature Gods. Could they have appealed to a God of Ice and Snow in combination with the powers of the Weirwood to make the Night King? He does seem quite at home in the cold. They said it was strange magic even for the CoF.

Could the Night King have turned against the CoF when true water worshippers arrived? The Rhoynar, as represented as the Ironborn in the show? Their worship would be well received by a creation of the god of ice and snow. They are reavers, trying to take whatever they can paying the iron price. Would their water worship turn the enemies (targets) of the iron born into enemies of the Night King, causing the war for the Dawn?

Maybe someone else noticed this as well, but not in any recent post Ive seen. Maybe there isnt a completely perfectly tight relationship, but I thought it would be interesting to share.

In Norse mythology, Loki, was a bastard born of Odins Affair with a comely giant. Loki was made a sworn brother of the Asir (Norse Gods) But was always odd man out. He was married to an Asir, Sygen, with whom he had a son Nari but he had three bastards with a giantess like his mother. These three children were, Ferrir Wolf (giant powerful wolf), Jrmungandr- a massive sea serpent and Hel a female of human appearance except that half her body was of dead putrefying flesh.

In Norse myth, When Oden found these shildren he chained the Wolf, and a God lost his hand, having it bit off by the Wolf, in the chaining. Oden sent Hel to rule over Helheim, the land of the dead and he sank Jrmungandr to the bottom of the ocean.

Clearly, the Starks might be special if their relation to wolves is more than an affinity.

We saw Melisandre without her beauty glamour, an over aged woman kept alive by the magic that allows her to birth shadows. Could it be that the first Priestess of Rhllor is even stranger? An outright combination of living and dead? The embodiment of Hel?

What is the motivation for Rhllor to help fight the Night King? Has Hel taken a holiday, and hates the cold lifeless placed she had ruled?

In the books, The Grey King, the First king of the Iron born from who all Ironborn houses are descended, killed the great Nagga, in this context I would take to be a water dragon, and took his fangs and made them into a crown. Clearly, the description of the Naga matches Jrmungandr. The kings castle was built from Naggas bones which turned to stone and was heated by Naggas heart, which was extinguished after the kings death. As an aside, the Grey King worshipped the Drowned God. I find it interesting the Night King is blue, like water- though his followers are white, and, it appears his head has a crown that could easily be made of fangs.

Finally, there is a sacred tree, in Norse myth.

In Norse myth, Yggdrasil is the world tree connecting up everything from the depths of the earth to up in the sky. It connects the nine worlds, Niflheim, Muspelheim, Asgard, Midgard, Jotunheim, Vanaheim, Alfheim, Svartalfheim, Helheim- the Gods, man, sky beings, white elves, black elves, giants, and helheim, the realm of the dead which is freezing cold land where no fire can live.

But after Stannis weird ghost child kills his brother we never see him again? Its like he never had a child at all but everyone continues to talk about it like he has an heir to his throne. 

At the same time Brienne of Tarth is positive the demon shadow looked exactly like Stannis. So what makes this his child and not just a temporary incarnation of his own desire to kill his brother and take the throne? 

Bonus: The child also looked suspiciously sinister and so does Lady Melisandre. Varys also tells a story about how he was castrated by a warlock to please The Lord of Light...  
We see Daenerys with her dragons and the brotherhood with flaming swords and imagine the lord of light is good, but it seems like The Lord of Light has done just as much damage if not more than the Night King. 

The final season will almost certainly involve a battle between the The Lord of Light and the Night King but they both seem equally terrible. I will also add the fact that the Night King seems to be saving children while The Lord of Light burns them at the stake... ",33,6,False,spoiler,,,,,

Cersei is the queen and is sitting in the iron throne now.   All of her children are dead.  
So who is her heir ? 
Either Tyrion or Jamie. 
Im not sure is Jamie is still a king guard, but we have the vibe that Cersei and Jamie will die together, so he will probably be out of the picture. 
So after his twins brother and sister are dead , as their heir , Tyrion becomes the rightful king of.... well Im not sure on which kingdom Cersei rules right now , beside the Riverland maybe , and king landing itself.  Not that any one is going to crown him either , being in dragon stone , hand of the queen to Dany. 
But if the event brings him to King Landing , at the time of his siblings death , and he does not share a blame for a change , he might be crown if he manages to  befriend with Qyburn or some other high lord 

Well , as fellow king , he can yield his crown to Jon or Dany but he might want to use this opportunity , or more likely Jon and or Dany will not survive the battle with the others.  ",20,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

* Game of Thrones wiki summary: [https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/The\_Night\_Lands](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/The_Night_Lands)
* Biggest moment: Jon witnesses the White Walkers turn Craster's son into one of them. Jon's belief in the threat the White Walkers present is essential to the rest of the series.
* Episode MVP: Yara Greyjoy. Our introduction to Theon's sister is rather unusual, but it sure is memorable.
* Final thought: Unfortunately, some episodes of Game of Thrones serve primarily to move pieces on the chess board. This is one of those episodes. While it continued to add depth to some of the characters (and gave us our first look at the Iron Islands), it didn't feel like a lot of items of consequence happened.",5,8,False,spoiler,,,,,

David and Dan fucking showed all of us in Season 7 that they came from Dragonstone. AKA Stannis' home for the past I don't know fucking YEARS he was stuck there ruminating over how he didn't get NO RESPECT AT ALL.

Stephen Dillane fathered Voldemort. He's not fucking around. He's out for revenge, motherfuckers. I know it. Liam and Carice know it. You've always known it.

I have better things to do than to waste my time walking you through the fucking TOMES of evidence. But it's all there. GRRM told you motherfuckers from the get-go that the devil's in the details. What, you think that whole bit with Syrio and the tabby cat in the books was just for shits and giggles? FUCKING SHUT UP AND LISTEN TO YOUR ELDERS.

So I came up with a channel which uploaded a interview/review of all the season game of thrones had so far, which features G RR Martin himself and some other cast members explaining all the important scenes from season 1 onwards. The video is just 1 hour long but I loved watching it so thought it might make others happy too. So below is the link to that video and I hope you enjoy the video as much as I did

I cannot decipher where his story will end, but I am slowly convincing myself that ""A Song of Fire and Ice"" is a song about Brandon himself, similar to other folk songs common in Westeros. Songs tend to be a recurring theme in this story.

My theory is based on the three-eyed raven assuring Bran that he will never walk, but he will fly. Walking is common locomotion for humans, but flying as common locomotion?!? Was the three-eyed raven referring to movement between places in time, or something else?

During a re-watch, it occurred to me that Bran may move beyond shifting to birds and actually shift into a dragon, which would add another mind-blowing facet to this story.

A showdown between dragons is almost inevitable. I wonder if Bran is the deciding factor.

I may be way off base here, but I'm curious what fans think.

Jojen Reed to Bran- ""If you stay trapped in Summer for too long, you'll forget what it was like to be human.""

Meera Reed- ""You'd forget us, Bran. You'd forget your mother and father. You'd forget your brothers and sisters. You'd forget Winterfell. You'd forget you and if we lose you, we lose everything.""

 Probably means nothing and I'm reading too much into it but do you think it's possible that Bran Stark is a critical player and that he may have to choose his family over being the 3 Eyed Raven?

Does Meera really not play any other role in this story?

Sorry if this has been mentioned before but that whole Bran and Howland Reed's kids going north of the wall story arc still bothers me.

The episode moves much too quickly for my tastes - Gendry runs all the way from the deep north back to Eastwatch, sends a raven to Dragonstone to alert Daenerys, Daenerys flies off beyond the wall (an area she has no knowledge of whatsoever), and then finds the suicide squad and rescues them, all in seemingly a matter of a couple of days. Not to mention, while Gendry is going back towards Eastwatch, the rest of the suicide squad nonsensically put themselves in even more danger by going further into the north where all of the wights are.

So how about instead of the suicide squad trekking beyond the wall on foot, what if Daenerys went with Jon and flew all of them beyond the wall with Viserion? Events would still play out very similarly to the actual episode, but there would be less leaps of logic to deal with. Here's how my version of events would play out:

* Daenerys convinces Jon to let her come with them. Everyone councils her against this. Jon fears for her safety and doesn't want her to come, but she convinces him to let her come because \[1\] it'll be the safest and quickest way to capture a wight and \[2\] Viserion and Jorah should keep her well protected. Daenerys was willing to come to Jon's aid with all three of her dragons when he needed rescuing, so it wouldn't be that much more of a leap to have her be willing to come with him to start with
* They fly to Eastwatch where they meet up with Tormund and the Brotherhood (Daenerys being there could allow for some pretty interesting interactions with the rest of the suicide squad). They all fly beyond the wall
* They set up camp beyond the wall. The suicide squad goes on their hunt to find a wight to capture. Daenerys stays behind with Viserion and Jorah
* The suicide squad captures the wight and goes back to Daenerys. The wights find them and start pursuing and the Night King kills Viserion with his spear. Now trapped with no escape, they all flee to the middle of the frozen lake. The wights sink in the ice, leaving them both trapped and safe for the time being
* The other two dragons sense Viserion's death and that Daenerys is in mortal danger. They make a beeline straight to the frozen lake. Drogon immediately came when Daenerys was in danger in the fighting pits, so Drogon and Rhaegal immediately knowing where she is wouldn't be that outrageous
* A day or so passes. The Hound is a dumb cunt and throws a rock at one of the wights that misses, hitting the now solidly frozen ice and alerting all of the wights that the path to attack is clear
* The frozen lake battle proceeds. The wights come from all sides and push them to the brink of being overrun. Daenerys gets mobbed by the wights and screams out for help. That's when Drogon and Rhaegal come and burn all the surrounding wights around them, saving their mother. Jon carries a wounded Daenerys back to the dragons and (since Jon is in fact a Targaryen), flies Rhaegal and gets all of them back to safety. Jon finally bends the knee to Daenerys back at the wall 

To me, this would make the episode more believable. It definitely would be farfetched for Daenerys to come with Jon beyond the wall, but it could be justified by her wanting definitive proof of the army of the dead's existence and, since she's developed significant feelings for Jon, just wanting to protect him. It would also significantly change how the episode would transpire to the viewer. Having Viserion killed in the middle would be a huge oh shit moment and leave the viewer wondering how all of them will escape. Plus, having Daenerys' life be in significant jeopardy would significantly escalate the stakes of the episode and make the dragon's entrance even more epic.",5,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

With the grand finale that is season eight on the not-so-distant horizon, we wanted to kick off our weekly series of pre-season discussion posts. **First up: Character journeys.**

**Remember when the Stark kids** [**looked like this?**](https://i.imgur.com/iUmSf0J.jpg)

That was a long time ago in TV years, and with seven seasons behind us, this is an open discussion on how characters have developed on the show over that time - and where you think they'll end up.

**So, a few possible questions to answer:**

* Which characters have changed the most?
* Whose character journey has been your favourite? Which others do you love?
* Characters like Jaime have come a long way - but what will his ending in S8 be like? What are your predictions for other characters?

And, of course, you can discuss anything else relating to character/journeys arcs!

All three of Danys, Jons and Tyrions mothers have died during childbirth.

All three of them have also been able to interact with dragons (obviously Dany the most). Tyrion when he unchained Viserion and Rhaegal in Meereen and Jon when he interacted with Drogon in Dragonstone. 

Now Im not suggesting 100% that Tyrion is a Targaryen as well; he may just be the third dragon or third protagonist or whatever. HOWEVER I do feel like I need to mention that dwarfism or achondroplasia is associated with older paternal age (if the mad king was in fact Tyrions father and raped his mother Joanna Lannister as it is hinted at in the books). This could explain a lot of the Tywin comments and resentment towards Tyrion besides the fact that Tyrion is a dwarf.

Tyrion is talking to Bronn about having to marry Sansa and Bronn suggests that Tyrion wants to bed her. Tyrion says,  I dont pay you to put evil notions in my head.

Bronn stands up and crosses the room to a pitcher with wine. He reaches for it and pours a glass.  While crossing the room he says, Evil notions come free.

Cut to next scene: Tywin entering the Throne room to talk to Joffrey.  It a tense scene where you can see Tywin losing his patience with his King.

I laughed out loud. It was hilarious that I never noticed this editing before: evil notions-wine-Tywin-Joffrey...

Good times.

Im not actually suggesting this is proof that Tywin was part of the plot or aware of the plot.  But, I thought it was a delightful coincidence,

(More on this later) First we'll need to discuss why this will occur and who would want such a thing to happen.

With the ongoing disputes about who should be rightfully sitting on the throne and who will get vengeance on who, I feel like the focus is being shifted away from the true matter at hand. Melisandre is correct in saying the War For Dawn is about to take place. Although I'm not sure that the human race of Westeros would want ""Dawn"" to occur if they knew what it meant.

**The Lord Of Light \[Fire\]**

The Priests of R'hllor are intolerant of Other religions and have gone as far as burning the idols of other religions numerous times. Melisandre has had Stannis burn his statues of the Seven on Dragonstone and other followers attempted to burn The Black Goat of Qohor. When Stannis offered to legitimize Jon Snow Melisandre made sure to add the stipulation that he needed to burn the Weirwood tree in Winterfell in order to become a Stark (Too bad he's a Targaryen). This religion comes from Asshai a place that has dubious descriptions so why would anyone believe that these people have good intentions. I believe that these zealots are just as, if not more dangerous than the White Walkers. It just so happens that this religion has a standing slave army of 1000 fire worshipers known as The Fiery Hand and Melisandre has left to Volantis to most likely recruit these soldiers to fight in the War For Dawn. When Jojen is asked about how it will all end he see's [this](https://imgur.com/gallery/D93uIpv) in his vision. This is either an extremely on the nose reference to the end occurring when the fiery hand arrives. Most likely due to the eruption of God's Eye as a result of the forces of fire defeating the WW's. Fun fact, Melisandre has been said to be 400 years old (in the show at least), old enough to have been alive during the Doom of Valyria. ""Only Death Can Pay For Life""- Mirri Maz Duur

**The Azor Ahai Prophecy**

It's my belief that this is not a prophecy of salvation but instead it's a prophecy of Doom and rather than focusing the prophecy on people lets try places, namely Volcanoes. There's only one confirmed Volcano on/near Westeros though (Dragonmont, this one relates to the Prince Prophecy not Azor Ahai).

1) *He labored for thirty days and thirty nights until it was done. However, when he went to temper it in* ***water****, the sword broke.* The Water in my opinion is Hardhome. It is never stated that Hardhome is a Volcano but in the books Hardhome was the site of a disaster 600 years ago that seems suspiciously reminiscent of a volcanic eruption.  

""*The homes of the inhabitants of Hardhome were said to have burned with flames so high and hot that the watchers on the Wall far to the south thought* ***that the sun was rising from the north****. Afterwards, ashes rained down on the Haunted Forest and the Shivering Sea alike for* ***almost half a year****.""* 

It's never confirmed in the books or show that this was a volcanic eruption but even if it was, why the secrecy and mysticism? In [this](https://youtu.be/irde_d34aiY?t=335) behind the scenes video Producer Chris Newman states that ""Hardhome was an austere, volcanic, black beach."" This confirms to me that this was a volcanic event and was the reason the White Walkers came to Hardhome (I'll explain why soon).

&amp;#x200B;

2)  *The second time he took fifty days and fifty nights to make the sword, even better than the first. To temper it this time, he captured a* ***lion*** *and drove the sword into its* ***heart****, but once more the steel shattered.* This made me think of Casterly Rock here's why.

 ""*According to a lost scroll, Valyrian sorcerers believed their downfall would come from the Rock's gold*."" Strange that the Valyrian's would have any prophecies about Casterly Rock but perhaps the disappearance of the entire house of Casterly can be explained by  them having dug too deep. There is also mention of a strange cleft in Casterly Rock that was used by Lann the clever to deceive them out of their seat. 

&amp;#x200B;

3)   *During his third try to forge a sword to battle the darkness with, called Nissa Nissa to him after working on his sword for a hundred days and nights. To finish his sword, he drove it through Nissa Nissa's breast. Her blood, soul, strength, and courage went into the steel of the sword, creating Lightbringer Following this sacrifice, Lightbringer was as warm as Nissa Nissa had been in life. Nissa Nissa's cry of anguish and ecstasy left a crack across the face of the moon.* 

This one was the most difficult to ascribe to a location and I'll admit this is a very large leap but I'm basing this portion of the theory on the work of another redditor.  [u/TheWaker](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheWaker) created a detailed post that claimed that Nissa Nissa meant ""The beginning and The End"" Or Alpha and Omega. So my next leap was that this translated to The God's Eye. Conveniently the God's Eye looks eerily similar to a [Crater Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono_Lake) and it is covered with numerous Weirwoods that have faces carved into them. It's said that Greenmen have lived there since the Pact. So not only is the Isle of Faces guarded but it was also monitored heavily through all the Weirwoods. Why all of this security unless there was something of significance there?

&amp;#x200B;

How does something like this even fulfill the prophecy you ask? I believe these volcanic eruptions caused by the followers of R'hllor triggering an eruption with dragons and fire magic will cause a massive fissure to form across the continent of Westeros. This fissure will be the red fiery sword called ""Lightbringer"" that will pierce the God's Eye and cause the Doom of Man. As mentioned above the cry of anguish and ecstacy from the God's Eye will leave a crack in the face of the moon. 

In the words of Mirri Maz Duur and Daenerys:  ""*When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east,"" said Mirri Maz Duur, ""When the seas go dry and the mountains blow in the wind like leaves. When your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child. Then he will return, and not before.*"" 

The explosion will be so bright the sun will rise in the west. The seas will go dry due to the seismic activity. Mountains will crumble and explode. Daenerys will survive beyond the wall and give birth to her and Jon's child; Drogo. The red keep will be destroyed along with King's Landing.

Daenerys and her dragons will have broken the Wheel...completely along with everything else.

&amp;#x200B;

The White Walkers/Night King are coming south to prevent these eruptions. The went to Hardhome to secure one volcano. They literally decrease the ambient temperature whenever they go.

The island in the middle of a lake that Jon and the suicide squad got stuck on was also a [volcano](https://imgur.com/gallery/2bBA2) and the cracks formed in the ice by dragons breath are foreshadowing the fissures that will be created across Westeros when the crucial volcanoes erupt and create lightbringer.

&amp;#x200B;

The Night King's [Sigil](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/69/cf/44/69cf44bae34aed5016dae48bd5caa843--night-king-king-pin.jpg) is a cone shaped volcano about to erupt. The magma chamber is expanding hence the curved line in the middle of it.

 Also, where craster's baby is taken to be turned into a white walker is a blown out frozen volcano.

&amp;#x200B;

There's more parts to this theory but probably the craziest is this...

When Robb interrupts old Nan while she's telling Bran about the Long Night in season one. He sends her away and then tells Bran ""*One time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant named 'Macumber'.*"" 

The blue eyed Giant is The God's Eye. Once it erupts the sky will no longer be blue and nor will the god's eye be blue. Old Nan was right and Robb did't believe her. Oberyn Martell says the same story as well to Tywin.

&amp;#x200B;

The [Pane Glass](https://zombiesruineverything.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/littlev6.jpg) windows in the throne room with Varys and Littlefinger that depict a blue circle inside a seven pointed star also represent the God's Eye in the middle of the 7 kingdoms. White Glass above it, green and orange below it representing the ice and fire fighting over the god's eye. In the visions of Dany and I think Bran too these windows are blown out.

&amp;#x200B;

A volcano is beneath Winterfell you can tell because the ground isn't level, the door to the crypt is awkwardly slanted and the hot springs. The Crypts are cold because they were built with ice magic by Bran the Builder like the wall was, in order to keep the Volcano beneath Winterfell tame.

&amp;#x200B;

Probably crazy ramblings. I don't know. I just gave all of this some thought and needed to put it somewhere. Maybe one or two people will agree. I got tired by the end of this post hence the jumbled mess it became. Cheers if you made it this far. Some of the locations for the Azor Ahai prophecy i'm not 100% certain of but I think regardless that's what it's alluding to. The show really pulls you in close with making you like or hate characters so much so that you forget the settings and surroundings so when this happen's it's going to come out of left field for most.

So this is a theory I had, based on turm0il26's theory about Bran being the Night King. If you want to read up on that theory before delving into this one its right here: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/gottheories/comments/6hq2ws/the_identity_of_the_night_king_based_on_tv/

Without going over the whole theory, it pretty much addresses that Bran is very possibly the Night King, getting stuck back in time after multiple attempts to stop the white walkers from ever being created, creating them in the process. If you can't or won't believe this then the rest of this is pointless for you. With that said, the biggest challenge for me was finding a motivation for the NK to kill everybody and why he won't stop until he does. I was kind of thinking he might be stuck in a 'limbo' or the halfway point between life and death, unable to die and yet not really living. The only way for him to die is to kill Bran Stark, or himself. I've considered a lot of possibilities and it seems like this might be the most convincing of theories. If he had let Jon Snow kill him at Hardhome or the lake (not sure what reddit users have been referring to this scene as), then Bran's inability to control his powers yet might have still created him again as he wargs into the past. The only real way to kill the NK is to kill bran as a young boy, stopping the loop and guaranteeing the NK is never created. When the NK finds Bran beyond the wall in the Three Eyed Raven's cave, he could have ended everyone's misery right there. 

In conclusion, Hodor shouldn't have held the door, and Jamie should have found a taller building to push Bran off of.

&amp;#x200B;

Six months ago I posted a theory about Dany and Jon having a white walker baby.

[My theory, from six months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/97ooeq/spoilers_original_theory_about_how_it_all_ends/)

 While the community at large has not accepted this, I am growing more certain that I have been the one to correctly guess the ending of the series!

&amp;#x200B;

Well, today I received some pretty solid validation (from a Talking Thrones video that came out two weeks ago).

&amp;#x200B;

The [Talking Thrones White Walker Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEud33zwWCA) lays even more supporting evidence to my theory, but proposes that Dany and Jon will have a healthy son, ""The Prince Who Was Promised"" and that that name is actually a play on words and the baby is ""promised"" as a sacrifice to the Night's King to fulfill their oath/pact and keep them at bay.

  
That theory has a lot of merit. I love the play on words idea. 

&amp;#x200B;

The two problems I see with it, that I address in my theory are:  


1.) It does not address the prophecy that states very clearly that ""Dany can not bear a **living** child"". The **living** clause is perfect George R.R. Martin trickery at work, and seems to have been mostly disregarded by theorists. I think its the key.

&amp;#x200B;

2.) I'm fully sold on the well-known ""Rhaegar was the Prince Who Was Promised, Jon is Lightbringer"" theory. (Not my own). If this theory is true it nullifies the strongest point of the Talking Thrones video.

[Jon is Lightbringer Theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/6ti602/spoilers_main_legit_azor_ahai_theory_that_makes/)

* Episode MVP: Tyrion. This was the only other big moment, as Tyrion lays out three ""marriages"" for Myrcella in an effort to discover who is spying on him for Cersei. The answer is Pycelle. We get a nice taste of just how clever Tyrion can be in this episode.

It's made of Valyrian steel and, according to Ser Rodrik, has a dragonbone hilt. Also, we see this dagger in Sam's reading material, lumped into a book on the uses of dragonglass.

To kill wights you usually need Valyrian steel, dragon glass or Fire !

Do you think the latter would work for a dragon which are usually quite immune to fire ? If not they will need to build dragon glass Balista arrows (and Balistas) to hope to take it down ? 
This brings more questions. 
- Is dragon glass strong enough to Pierce through Dragon skin?
- If it is, we have seen WW and W being killed by one single stroke of dragon glass. Does that mean that a single good shot could take the ice dragon down ?

Obviously the last option is to kill the NK, but it would be hard enough without the dragon in the way. So I guess at some point they'll need to take it down.

A couple weeks ago I started rewatching (alright alright, I'll admit it was binging) the series from the start, to get ready and refresh my memory of the past events in the series, before Season 8 shows up.

As everyone knows, the animation that accompanies the opening credits of the show change every now and then, according to what happens in the series and where the events of that episode are about to take place. As the opening credits for season 7 episode 1 started to roll, I saw the Baratheon sigil (the stag) was on top of the main gear of the Red Keep. I don't understand why it's still there, seen as \[HERE COMES THE SPOILER, BEWARE\] Tommen died in the final episode of Season 6, resulting in Cersei becoming the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. Seen as Cersei is from House Lannister, shouldn't there be a lion on top of the main gear of the Red Keep in the animation? Or is it still a stag because she was married to Robert Baratheon? I'd like to talk about this with you guys and hear your thoughts and opinions.",6,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

Both claim the throne is their birthright, they both have a tendency to burn people alive, and most significantly: they both are the only ones that answered the call to help Jon protect the realm from threats of the north. Stannis came to Jon's aid in saving the realm from the Wildlings, whereas Dany has done the same in the war against the Others. It stands to reason that the parallels will continue, and Dany is not long for this world, in much the same way that Stannis was. After Stannis turned his attention back to the crown, he was immediately defeated. When Dany realizes Cersei's betrayal and turns her sight back to the crown, she will lose her life also.

&amp;#x200B;

As for Jon and Robb, much of their similarities come purely because of their shared upbringing. The significant part however, is that Robb lost his life because he let his heart overwhelm his sense of duty. In forming a relationship with Dany, Jon is doing the same thing. Right from the start, Jon's character has been partially defined by his abstinence - he refused to go to the brothels with his peers because he couldn't stand the thought of fathering any bastards like himself. Jon had to betray his own philosophy in Ygritte's case as more than just his own survival depended on it. With Dany however, Jon is betraying his own ideals for nothing more than his heart's desires. He is following in the steps of Robb, and I believe that it will cost him his life too.",9,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

I watched carefully and saw her remove the poison from Sansa's necklace, which I had missed when I watched it previous times, but I still don't see at what point the poison gets into Jeoffery's cup.

&amp;#x200B;

The Stranger (the poison used on Jeoffery) was a very fast acting poison, which means that Jeoffery would have had to have drank it just before he died. The only problem is, I don't see Olenna get anywhere near his cup after Tyrion refills it. My best guess is that Olenna passed off the poison to Margaery at some point, who then puts it into Jeoffrey's cup when as he hands it to her as the pigeon pie comes out.

But one thing really annoys me (apart from many others of the series). Craster used to give his newly born male babies to white Walkers to ensure his safety but how did Walkers comes to know that a new one is born ????And they were even easily able to locate the ginny's baby ?? And second thing is that how was night king planning to cross the wall as benjen stated that it is not just ice wall rather it has magic and no dead cab cross it until it stands and night king must be knowing this. So according to me he may have abilities like bran which allowed him to track babies and even a strong foresight than bran as maybe he was knowing in advance that daenerys along with her dragons be coming for jon's rescue so he has a great chance of getting a Dragon. Thus he waited till right time bcz I don't think than just some breaking of ice could have stopped him from killing jon and his team if he wanted to. So that he can get a dragon. Well maybe this is a common observation cuz i don't know as i am new to this community. But please share your views.,1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

And last night I had one about Game of Thrones. Specifically when the White Walkers arrive at Winterfell. It was pretty intense and crazy and basically a lot of people were killed and some escaped. But something that happened in my dream got me thinking...

So in my dream, as the army of the dead assaulted Winterfell, many people were trying to escape or fight back and a bunch of people were dying. A lot of the people who were dying were unfortunately just added to the ranks of the Night King's army. Danny, being there and wanting to help, got on Drogon and was trying to hold back the army as long as possible with dragon fire, but she realized pretty quickly it was pointless as the people that were trying to escape were dying anyway. She made a snap decision to basically ""burn them all"" and burned everyone, even the living, that was in the area. Of course a good amount of people made it out. And I realize it's just a dream, but I was curious if anyone has talked about this possibility at all?

We know there were pictures of Winterfell on fire and Emilia has even said something that hinted at Danny's actions leaving a bad taste in the viewers mouths. Maybe she does something along these lines, killing the living in an effort to save the dead? She has been shown to be a little impulsive during last season. Like I said, I know it came from a crazy dream but I was curious to get your guy's thoughts.

I'm probably just over excited because we're only 2 months away... oh well. Lol",8,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Sure he was a monster to Sansa, but Margaery was much more adept at controlling men than Sansa and had already basically tamed the guy.

Bran was the one who explained to Sansa how Littlefinger was setting up the conflict between her and Arya.  Without him she would have never figured it out.

This was so subtle.  just a single sentence.  When Littlefinger gave Bran the knife, Bran said to Littlefinger, Chaos is a ladder.  Game over.  Bran knew how Littlefinger set up the Stark Lannister conflict and knew the conflict he cultivated between Sansa and Arya. Bran was silent at the trial of Littlefinger, but Sansa and Arya were telling the story he had put together.  They might not believe each other, but they would believe Bran.

* Game of Thrones wiki summary: [https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Garden\_of\_Bones](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Garden_of_Bones)
* Biggest moment: There were plenty of smaller moments in this episode, but few big ones. Perhaps it was the disagreements between Robb and Roose. At some point soon, Roose is going to turn on Robb and perhaps one of the reasons is Roose fails to see his ruthlessness returned by Robb. (Something he'll see returned by Tywin and the Freys.) After Robb's latest victory, Roose wants Robb to kill the Lannister soldiers or at least torture them for information, but Robb disagrees.
* Episode MVP: Melisandre. Shadow baby. 'Nuff said.
* Final thought: It wasn't the biggest moment, or feature the Episode MVP, but we got another glance at the cruelty of Joffrey. It was not only his ordered beating of Sansa, but his subsequent torture of the prostitute. Joffrey certainly earned his ending.",6,24,False,spoiler,,,,,

In season 1 we see that the Starks have a prized Valyrian steel great sword named ""Ice"" that is wielded by Ned Stark and is eventually used to execute Ned himself. Tywin Lannister then melts down Ice and forges the swords ""Oathkeeper"" and ""Widow's Wail"" and gives them to Jaime and Joffrey respectively. Through the events of the series, Brienne is now in possession of Oathkeeper and is (sort of) in service to the Starks, and Jaime has taken possession of Widow's Wail as seen in s7e5. In the promotional photos of season 8 we can see that Jaime is wearing a set of northern style armor and his last interaction with Cercei leads many to believe that he will go north to fight the White Walkers, meaning that the two swords that once made up Ice will be near or even in their original resting place.

I can imagine someone maybe has posted this already, but I was reading it and thought this part was particularly interesting and exciting:

&gt;But this season will be even bigger, with six nearly feature length episodes and some of the largest, most complex sequences ever filmed for television. The final clash between the heroes and the undead White Walkers, in particular, took many weeks to film, including 55 nights of outdoor shooting.  
&gt;  
&gt;That episode was overseen by the veteran Thrones director [Miguel Sapochnik](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/29/arts/television/game-of-thrones-miguel-sapochnik-emmy-awards.html?module=inline), whose previous episodes like [Hardhome](http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/31/game-of-thrones-recap-white-walker-attack-season-5/) and [Battle of the Bastards](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/19/arts/television/game-of-thrones-season-6-episode-9-the-hungry-dogs-of-war.html?module=inline) featured some of the shows most dazzling action scenes. But the new one makes the Battle of the Bastards look like a theme park, Peter Dinklage [told Entertainment Weekly](https://ew.com/tv/2018/11/01/game-of-thrones-final-season-ew-cover-story/).

&amp;#x200B;

This may have already been posted somewhere, but I found this to be particularly interesting and exciting:

&gt;But this season will be even bigger, with six nearly feature length episodes and some of the largest, most complex sequences ever filmed for television. The final clash between the heroes and the undead White Walkers, in particular, took many weeks to film, including 55 nights of outdoor shooting.  
&gt;  
&gt;That episode was overseen by the veteran Thrones director [Miguel Sapochnik](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/29/arts/television/game-of-thrones-miguel-sapochnik-emmy-awards.html?module=inline), whose previous episodes like [Hardhome](http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/31/game-of-thrones-recap-white-walker-attack-season-5/) and [Battle of the Bastards](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/19/arts/television/game-of-thrones-season-6-episode-9-the-hungry-dogs-of-war.html?module=inline) featured some of the shows most dazzling action scenes. But the new one makes the Battle of the Bastards look like a theme park, Peter Dinklage [told Entertainment Weekly](https://ew.com/tv/2018/11/01/game-of-thrones-final-season-ew-cover-story/).  
&gt;  
&gt;And thats presumably before the show even gets to the final clash to determine who actually wins this whole, you know, game of thrones.

She trained with Syrio for a few weeks at best.
The Hound never taught her how to fight.
He was only taking her around The Riverlands hoping for a ransom. And pretty much all he taught her was where the heart was.
And Bravos, Jaqen taught her to lie and the Waif just beat her up. In their last time they trained The  Waif beat her up without breaking a sweat.
And people say Arya beat her because they fought in the dark and Arya learned to fight blind.
All faceless men go through the blindness training. And even the Arya never beat The Waif while blind, she blocked a few strikes at best.
And it's a miracle that Arya could run and jump like that after getting stabbed in the guts.
Milk of the poppy stops the pain doesn't heal stab wounds and neither does soup. And the fact that she swam(a miracle that she could swim after getting stabbed) through that shit water doesn't help.

2) just there were a lot of Sons of Harpys in this scene, where did this many come from? how did they all get in unnoticed? once again, how are they all this good at fighting?  this just breaks immersion for me

3) also, once again, don't the Unsullied proved somewhat useless? they just do not seem near as good as advertised, which seems like bad writing based off previous writing

I saw another post discussing the possibility of the sword Ice being reforged since Jaime is heading with the one half to Winterfell where Brienne has the other half. Personally I don't think it will happen, but it got me thinking about the sword itself and what it (and other swords) means to both houses. Most of this is obvious, but the shift of ownership of the sword (an embodiment of power) shows a lot about the people who control that power and their philosophy.

When it was owned by the Starks, it's primary purpose was carrying out executions which is very fitting since the Starks are very concerned about Justice, Honor, and Tradition. So for that to be it's purpose makes a lot of sense, it shows that the Starks think justice is important enough to devote a literally priceless family heirloom to carrying it out. Ned spends his entire life and his time on the show, leveraging his power for the pursuit of justice as he saw it. I think there is some mention in some extras stuff that the sword might have also  been used by Ned in combat during the Greyjoy rebellion ( Valyrian steel makes it light enough to still be usable), but it's definitely not used regularly for that purpose as seen at the tower of joy. Still, putting down the raiding Greyjoys was justice too in Ned's mind.

When Tywin gets the sword, his first instinct is that something so priceless is wasted as an absurdly large headsman's axe and he has it reforged to into two much more practical swords. Tywin, as always, uses everything at his disposal, including the swords, for two purpses: to project power (he gives one to King Joffrey), and to build his family's prestige (he gives the other to his hopeful heir). So even though Tywin is the ultimate pragmatist, he still uses the most valuable material in the world for political and legacy considerations. That's what *he* spends his whole life leveraging his power for.

Jaime has a different philosophy, he thinks a sword, or power, should serve a purpose and he saw Brienne's oath to Catelyn to be more a worthy purpose than him using it as a crippled King's guard. However, it may be telling that later, he is willing to wield Widow's Wail as if he realizes that he (and the sword) can still serve a purpose without his sword hand. He uses pragmatism, like his father, but for a nobler cause. The fulfillment of an oath, something Jaime has spent his whole life wrestling with.

Cersei is the corrupted endpoint of Tywin's more principled pragmatic self interest. She is what happens when all the dressings of propriety are taken away and pure self interest comes to the fore. When she gives Jaime Widow's Wail, she's not giving it to her heir, she's giving it to a literal tool. She leverages all her power to make the world bend to her will, because for her control is the means and then end. Probably because she's had control taken away from her so many times.

What does this all mean? Well the narrative about how Ice embodies the Starks pride and honor being so unwieldy that it becomes impractical is pretty established, if a simplification. But I think if anything, Tywin's over zealous self interest is what is ultimately impractical, it leads to people like Cersei who believes she is the true successor of Tywin's legacy. He used his power for prestige and legacy, but with his opportunism he chipped away at the rules and institutions that ultimately maintained the power and stability of the realm and therefore the great houses. It really comes down to what Jon Snow said in the Dragon Pit; that if people stop living up to their oaths, oaths stop meaning anything and in the end the oaths are the rules that keeps stability and maintains the status quo for those in power. So while Tywin ""pragmatically"" melted down Ice, the symbol of honor and justice, he also took away something less tangible, but still important. It's a classic tragedy of the commons type deal: when abusing a system benefits you, eventually the system collapses under the weight of *everyone* abusing it. Something Ned knew (even though they called him an honorable fool) and Jon knows.

I think the future of the swords and Westeros is a reversion. Some hoped Ice would be reforged, restoring the honor of the Starks. But even justice, honor and tradition will have to take a back seat to survival, as Jon already knows. Jon is like Cersei in that he is refined version of his father. He has the honor, but has learned that honor is not everything. He believes the only thing power, or swords, are good for now are surviving the Great War.

tl;dr Swords symbolize power. Ice symbolizes justice. Starks like justice. Tywin is meh on justice, melts justice for legacy and prestige for family. Jaime likes purpose and oaths, Cersei likes control, Jon likes saving mankind. Each uses swords for that purpose. ""Which uses it correctly?"" Is an interesting question.

1. Sansa possibly wanted Jon to die in the battle. She is playing the Game of Thrones, and his death would have served her purposes.

2. The writers wanted to create drama and they could not think of a meaningful way to do it besides sending Jon into battle with a weaker army and bringing the Vale troops in as a surprise when hope seems lost. This seems lazy and I hope this isnt the real reason.

Jon will have a heroic/sacrificial death

Daenerys finally gets the child that she always wanted however tragically dies moments after giving birth and naming the child

Tyrion will raise the child as regent while being in the father like figure.. Being a father that he always wanted Tywin to be

Drogon dies in the fight with Viserion but we find out that dragons are asexual in a similar fashion that some lizards are so Rhaegal goes off to some distant corner to begin its own lineage of dragons now that it lost its motherly figure

Cersei gets killed by Jaime. Jaime leaves behind the Lannister name and goes traveling with Brienne.

Bronn potentially being that witty/easy going Kingsguard.

Sansa becomes  Warden of the North

Arya either dies or goes adventuring, never to return to Westeros

Bran remains far north as overseer to make sure the supernatural evil remains sealed or we follow the bran the builder theory where time travel is involved

Also considering most of this didnt have the books to follow that makes it even more impressive.

It closes out with two of the best episodes in the whole show.

Finale Winds of Winter is probably the best finale as it ties up almost if not all characters arcs for the season. It featured one of the greatest sequences The Sept Explosion with a compelling soundtrack throughout.

Character Arcs:

Jon Snow: Started the season dead, betrayed by his brothers. Ended the season King of the North.

Daenerys: Started the season a prisoner to the Dothraki, without her dragons, without her trusted advisors. Ended the season having United the whole Dothraki horde behind her back, reclaimed Meereen and defeated the slavers, allied with Greyjoys, Martells and remaining Tyrell and heading across the narrow sea to claim her birthright.

Tyrion: Started the season grappling with the hardships of ruling a city. Ended he season becoming Daenerys hand of the Queen.

Cersei: Started the season in a position of weakness. Having been humiliated and violated,finding out her daughter is murdered. Ending the season destroying all her enemies, having her revenge and becoming Queen.

Sansa: Fleeing from her captors, close to being captured again. Ends the season returned home with her brother by her side. Having claimed Winterfell back from the Boltons.


Arya: Starts the season blind, weakest we have seen her. Ends the season a fully fledged badass killed returned home to Westeros and avenging her mother and brothers death by killing Walder Frey.

Theon: Tortured and broken having escaped Winterfell finally. Ended the season by his sisters side with a true cause along side Daenerys.

Bran: Started the Season Training/ completing his training under the watchful eye of the three eyed raven. Ends the season becoming the Three Eyed Raven and uncovering the shocking  truth of Jon Snows Heritage.

 We get interesting character development for characters like Melisandre who has lost everything she believed in. As well as Davos who finds a new leader to follow in Jon and becomes a devoted friend and ally.

Jon and Sansas reunion is possibly one of the most if not the most heart warming scenes of the entire show.

Daenerys has some amazing moments and the whole story really moves forward in this season.

There is room for amazing battles and character development.

**If someone asks you what your job title is, what would you say?**

I would say Im a language creator, thats what I do after all.

**What would you say the job description entitles for being a language creator?**

Oh, I dont know exactly. First, you should know that the job is unique - at least so far in it being a career. There had been many people that have been paid to create languages for things, but I think Im the first and only person in history who has actually made a career out of it, where the only way I earn money is by creating languages. 
Anyway, for the job description, I basically just create languages for a television or film property. Thats the whole thing from the ground up: the first step is working with the producer or director or showrunner to figure out what time of a language they want. The second step is creating the language, or the lexicon and that they are consistent with everything that Ive created before. By the time Im still on a show and working on season 3 or season 4, mostly my job is identical of that of a translator, with the exception that if there is a word that I dont have, Ill need to create it, or create some strategy for translating it, as opposed to a translator who works with an established dictionary.

**Did you know that you wanted to do this from an early age?**

I didnt know that human beings could create languages. I actually didnt know what linguistics was either, not until college. I learned about linguistics and language creation at about the same time, around 19 years old. I became very interested in learning languages late in high school. Probably around the tail end of my Junior year, I became very interested in learning languages so I started studying them on my own, and I got into first-year German, I was already taking Spanish all four years, I was in AP Spanish, added German to my Senior year and started studying French and Latin on my own, and I kept on with that when I got to college, where I studied Arabic, and then Russian. And then, my second semester, they offered a class on Esperanto, which is a created language, and it was the first time I had ever heard of Esperanto or anyone creating a language. When my mother heard about this, she said I should take a linguistics course. I didnt know what that was, but the next semester, there was an intro course that filled a breadth requirement, so I took that first linguistics course and found it really enjoyable and really easy. And so, I decided to add it as a second major. 

It was during my first linguistics course that I decided to create my own language, it took a bit because being introduced to language creation with Esperanto, I was only familiar with languages that had been created for international communication, and so, I didnt imagine you could create a language for another purpose. When I finally did hit upon the idea, I would be creating a language just for fun, not to compete with Esperanto. I just immediately went to it. I kinda thought I was the first person to ever do that, but then I found out about the language creating community and joined a tradition that was almost a thousand years old.

**Are you ever on set?**

I am almost never on set. There are occasions where I have been on the set, just to visit, there was one production, Bright, where I was on set the entire day, but aside from that most of the time I receive a script, whether a script for a movie or television show, the script coordinator tags the lines from the script that need to be translated into one or more languages, depending on how many I have done for that show. I get all those lines and I put them together in a document and translate them, record all the lines on mp3, and then I send them back to the script coordinator who distributes it to the actors.

He was so amazing to talk to and I really appreciated getting a perspective from an extremely unique job. So I just want to thank David again for taking the time to do the interview :)

I predicted that Sam and Jorah would meet and Sam would be the one to cure his Greyscale.

My premise is that Dany commanded to Jorah to find a cure. It seemed obvious his story was not going to end with him being a stoneman or suicide at that point (prior I thought it might). So I knew he would find a cure. If a cure did exist, the most logical place to check would be the Citadel.

Which is where at that point same had just arrived. I also thought it would be an interesting dynamic because Sam was there when his father died and it would also be a way to further align Jon's inner circle to Dannys (I was definitely it the camp that believe they would fall in love, but that was definitely not my theory... lol)

At the time at posted it many disagreed but I think most people agreed it was a very possible scenario... Definitely was my most up voted OP I have made here. I doubt I was the 1st person to make that theory but judging from the response here it was the 1st it occurred to many here at least. 

I am interested to see what theories you made turned out right. There are a lot of theories about season 8, a lot of crazy ones, but some of those crazy ones are going to be right.

I have been thinking of this a lot. In the scene in the house of black and white, Arya points out that there are statues of the stranger, the drowned god, (I think there were others too), and Jaqen says they are all different faces of the same god. When he is in Westeros, he refers to the Many Faced God as the Red God. This is also what many call the lord of light. Ive looked around online and many also lump in the old gods/weirwoods in as other faces of the many faced god. Is there really only one god, a jealous god who demands sacrifices of different kinds (drownings, burning, etc). 

Syrio says, there is only one god, the god of death.

What does it mean?

If the Lord If Light is really the god of death, does that make the Great Other/Night King the hero? Or are they just two gods fighting each other for more souls, with humans as the pawns/prize? Or is there truly only one god, and the Night King is just one of his champions as well. Is the Great War just a way to get more souls to the many faced god?

Are the Old Gods in on it too? Are they using Bran to get the living to go north to fight and die, gaining more souls for the god of death? Are the old gods actually the white walkers? Have the children of the forest misled men on behalf of the white walkers?

I need answers, Im going insane.

It's a chance to talk about your favorite moments and lines... or complain about something you didn't like.

Today, it's ""The Ghost of Harrenhal"":

* Game of Thrones wiki summary: [https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/The\_Ghost\_of\_Harrenhal](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/The_Ghost_of_Harrenhal)
* Biggest moment: Renly's assassination. He was the Baratheon most likely to inspire the masses and also the one able to bring the power of Highgarden with him. That all changed when the shadow baby slit Renly's throat. On top of that, it lead to the unlikely alliance of Brienne and Catelyn, which will have far-reaching effects.
* Episode MVP: Jaqen H'ghar. We've been given plenty of devastating deaths, but very few satisfying ones. In this episode, Jaqen gives us one we all wanted by killing the Tickler. It's a small taste of what's to come from the Faceless Men.
* Final thought: My, oh, my how things may have been different had Renly lived. Would it have been Baratheon vs. Baratheon on the battlefield? I'm not convinced. I think there's a good chance Stannis could have lost many of his forces before it came to that. And if Renly could have marched on King's Landing with the larger Baratheon force plus the soldiers from Highgarden, perhaps Tywin couldn't even have saved them.",9,19,False,spoiler,,,,,

In the second, she finds Khal Drogo  and their unborn son in a tent beyond the wall. I believe both of these visions are of the future, but it is in the second vision that a veiled message lies underneath; Daenerys Targaryen will die beyond the wall.  

The first vision is fairly straight forward; King's Landing will be destroyed by dragon fire. There are two possibilities here, either Daeny destroys King's Landing with Drogon and Rhaegal, or, more likely, the Night King will do it with Ice-Viserion (aka Blue Eyes White Dragon), considering Daeny just made an allegiance with King's Landing, the abandoned throne room would have us believe that *all* the inhabitants of King's Landing are dead (much more likely from a White Walker attack than Daeny), and the snow falling would have us believe that the White Walkers are involved (bringing the cold with them, notwithstanding the winter at hand).   

The second vision is a bit more sneaky. Daeny walks out beyond the wall where she finds a dothraki tent with Khal Drogo and her unborn son inside. There she has a short conversation with her former husband in which Khal Drogo says:

KD: ""Maybe I refused to enter the night-lands without you. Maybe I told the Great Stallion to go fuck himself and ***came back here to wait for you.****""* 

So let me get this straight... you came back *here* to *wait for Daeny* to *enter the night-lands?* 

*Daeny is having a vision of her death beyond the wall.* Khal Drogo is waiting for her to *die* beyond the wall. Why would she envision him waiting there, a place she had never yet been or seen, if this was not a vision of her future death?  

When or how the vision does not help to answer. But the message is simple; Daenrys Targaryen will die beyond the wall.

I want to make an outdoor escape room/scavenger hunt!

It's gonna be in King's Landing (KL), so places that it should visit are Blackwater Bay, Red Keep, docks of King's Landing and Walk of Shame stairs.

My idea for the story is:

You're a character from Essos. You saw the future and you know before anyone else that White Walkers are approaching The Wall!

Your mission is to unite 7 kingdoms and defeat the Night King.

You came to KL to ask king's (Joffrey) alliance against the White Walkers. But he has bigger problems, Stannis is on the way to attack the city with his fleet, so he promises you his army if you help him with Stannis.

**#1 Task** \- find wildfire and save KL (don't have an idea for the puzzle).

After you defeat Stannis, Joffrey being Joffrey breaks his word - that little brat. No army for you!

**#2 Task** \- kill Joffrey (mix some kind of poison).

After killing Joffrey, Tyrion (your adviser) gets accused of murder.

**#3 Task** \- save Tyrion

After you save Tyrion, you get a coin. You don't know what to do with it yet.

(""You stole 1 death from the Red God. You have to give it back"").

**(Not sure about the next step)** Cersei is now prisoned by High Sparrow. You know she plans to destroy Great Sept of Baelor, so you make an alliance with her to save her from High Sparrow if she gives you her army. Plus, you save innocent people that would die in the explosion.

**#4 Task -** Find a man from Braavos, give him the coin that you've got and say 'Valar Morghulis', he needs to respond 'Valar dohaeris'. Then you have a right to ask him for a wish, to take the face from High Sparrow, set Cersei free...

**#5** **Task ??** I don't know what to do here!!

&amp;#x200B;

In the end, you should have all the Kingdoms united.

Some ideas and guidelines would be awesome!

It's gonna be in King's Landing (KL), so places that it should visit are Blackwater Bay, Red Keep, docks of King's Landing and Walk of Shame stairs.

My idea for the story is:

You're a character from Essos. You saw the future and you know before anyone else that White Walkers are approaching The Wall!

Your mission is to unite 7 kingdoms and defeat the Night King.

You came to KL to ask king's (Joffrey) alliance against the White Walkers. But he has bigger problems, Stannis is on the way to attack the city with his fleet, so he promises you his army if you help him with Stannis.

**#1 Task** \- find wildfire and save KL (don't have an idea for the puzzle).

After you defeat Stannis, Joffrey being Joffrey breaks his word - that little brat. No army for you!

**#2 Task** \- kill Joffrey (mix some kind of poison).

After killing Joffrey, Tyrion (your adviser) gets accused of murder.

**#3 Task** \- save Tyrion

After you save Tyrion, you get a coin. You don't know what to do with it yet.

(""You stole 1 death from the Red God. You have to give it back"").

**(Not sure about the next step)** Cersei is now prisoned by High Sparrow. You know she plans to destroy Great Sept of Baelor, so you make an alliance with her to save her from High Sparrow if she gives you her army. Plus, you save innocent people that would die in the explosion.

**#4 Task -** Find a man from Braavos, give him the coin that you've got and say 'Valar Morghulis', he needs to respond 'Valar dohaeris'. Then you have a right to ask him for a wish, to take the face from High Sparrow, set Cersei free...

**#5** **Task ??** I don't know what to do here!!

&amp;#x200B;

In the end, you should have all the Kingdoms united, ready to march against the Night King.

Some ideas and guidelines would be awesome!

After reading a lot of theories and re-watching the show a few times i honestly think that Bran has manipulated at least these characters:

\-Varys - voice he heard in the fire

\-Aerys - ""burn them all""?

\-Jon Snow - resurrection

\-The Hound - resurrection and fire visions

\-Berric Dondarrion/Thoros of Myr - resurrection and fire visions

\-Hodor (obvious) and Ned Stark - warging and voice

3377,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2019-2-21,2019,2,21,6,asu3nm,self.gameofthrones,[Spoilers] What the Game of Thrones:Conquest ads tell us about the end of the show. (Probably nothing),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/asu3nm/spoilers_what_the_game_of_thronesconquest_ads/,jand999,1550698470,"Disclaimers: The ads I am about to discuss probably mean absolutely nothing. I doubt the developers or the people who made the ad have any knowledge of how the show will end. However, it might be fun. 

Also, I looked but didn't find any similar posts to what I'm talking about. If there are, my bad. I couldn't find footage of the new ads just the ones from last year. So I will be going off memory for a lot of this. 

 1.  Jon Snow will be King. 

There are several pieces of evidence to support this. This year's ads feature a new character. This character is first seen sitting on the iron throne. He doesn't look like Jon. He has brown hair and a full beard. However, his beard does resemble the one that Jon Snow's statue has. 

He is also wearing Stark armor. The same kind that Jon wears in season 7. (He may wear it before this and Ned or Rob may have worn it.) 

The man then gets up from the throne and shakes the hand of an Unsullied soldier. So what Stark has a connection with the Unsullied? Jonny boy of course. If Dany were to die Jon is the one they would most likely follow in her place. 

We also see the man fighting a WW that looks like the one Jon fought. (Yes they all pretty much look the same). Their fight also mirrors the one Jon had. 

Based on that evidence Jon will become the King. 

 2. Lyanna (Targaryen?) Stark

Another character that appears in these ads is a young women seen leading a stark army. She has black hair and dresses like her brooding father. We see two shots of the army, one showing regular soliders, and another showing Unsullied. The woman then raises her sword and a dragon that looks like Drogon flies in to attack. 

I think of all the dragons Rhaegal is most likely to survive but whatever.
So this ad seems to show us that Jon and Dany will have a baby girl. (I'm just guessing her name would be Lyanna.) She will lead Stark troops and she will have a dragon. 

I think this part is much more of a stretch than Jon will be king but it's fun is wildly theorize. 

So what do you guys think?

Hey everyone. I was wondering if any of you could help me out with some ideas, because Im having some trouble finding anything online.  

 So a very good friend of mines birthday happens to fall on April 14(premiere day). Shes the kind of person who goes completely out of her way to make sure even strangers get a perfect, personalized Christmas and birthday. I have never met someone as giving and kind as her, and I want to give her an amazing GOT themed birthday party. She told me over a year ago that all she wanted for the premiere was a party where we could dress up, have themed food and games and other shit and let loose with it all.  She mentioned she wished we could get all midieval (sp?) so I was thinking about making a big ass turkey so we can like carry the legs around with our chalices of wine. 

Sorry if this is all a big ramble, I get so anxious posting on here and I would be very grateful for some help on some ideas. So far, theres a funny pic of Tyrion with the crossbow to tape on the back of my bathroom door (directly in front of toilet.) and I found some cool Styrofoam egg tutorials with tacs in them to make them look metallic and dragon-like. Im going to look for fake swords and a lawn chair (silver spray paint? Idk) to make a throne of some sort.   If anyone would be willing to spare the time and give some ideas, I would appreciate it so much. What sort of party games or midieval foods could I create?

   TLDR: having GOT bday party for a much deserving friend. I need midieval food ideas, as well as games and decor ideas... Ill update as I think of more that can be done. Thank you for reading. Sorry for rambling.   I just really dont want this to be lame for her. I want to do what I can to make this a top notch themed party that she will remember.",21,4,False,self,,,,,

So for the future court that will rule the Seven Kingdoms, assuming they don't become autonomous or a sort of democracy is formed, certain roles will have been transferred:

* Master of Whisperers: Littlefinger/Varys/Pycelle --&gt; Bran/the Three-Eyed Raven who sees everything  
King/Queensguard Commander(s): Jaime --&gt; still Jaime (continuing to defend his honor, beginnings of this started when he left hence betrayed his queen, as he did before for the Mad King as the right thing to do) and/or Brienne (for the Starks), Sandor (if he survives the Cleganebowl which he might not), finally finding something worth fighting for
* Tyrion as Hand of the King/Queen and/or Master of Coin. He did express a desire to have a wine garden or something so he might do that in his free time or retire from politics.
* Arya as like personal bodyguard/assassin assuming she stays with her family
* Jon or Sansa as new Warden of the North or they can all stay together wherever the seat of the crown is, doesn't have to be King's Landing
* Missandei as adviser if Daenerys is the ruler, possibly married to Grey Worm who is also an adviser/general of the army
* Jorah as another adviser

Other Notable Personae:

* Samwell Tarly as new Maester of the Night's Watch OR since the Night King will be defeated and the Long Night ended and the wildlings living in peace with the southerners, the Night's Watch won't really be needed anymore, so he'll be Maester for the Crown AND married to Gilly and taking care of little Sam
* poor Theon will/should serve his sister, the Queen of the Iron Islands
* Ser Davos will/should retire to a quiet life on a farm
* Podrick will continue squiring for Brienne or become knighted
* Qyburn will be killed, somehow, maybe wildfire
* Varys will die (foreshadowed by what Melisandre tells him in S7 E3), related to what that spirit/demon whatever told him way back when
* Euron will be killed, I don't like the smile on his face
* Edmure reunited with his wife, resumes House Tully
* Unsullied will be freed, no longer soldiers
* Dothraki... given their nature will head off  


The Iron Throne was built by dragonfire and will be melted down by dragonfire; the new seat will be Sansa, Daenerys or Jon as Targaryen/Stark (a song of ice and fire). Jon and Daenerys will not marry although given the Targaryen tradition of incest it's not impossible, still highly unlikely. Wondering how Jon and Daenerys will react to the news. This is the hardest to predict. It's hard for me to imagine a King Jon/Aegon Targaryen or Queen Sansa Stark, I'm only used to Daenerys playing act queen.

Daenerys has said she doesn't want children. Jon as the only man with Stark blood besides the Three-Eyed Raven will have to marry to continue the Stark blood (and Targaryen), in a race of both ice and fire that will be the new ruling dynasty of Westeros. I kinda want now on rewatch Sansa to become the ruler of it all and I don't really like Daenerys's personality but Jon is the most fitting for his blood. Sansa did tell him that he's fit for ruling and he does not wish the rule as opposed to Daenerys who wants it. He would be extremely well supported with an overpowered court. 

Both Jon and Daenerys ruling is too happy-ending and this show has a special relationship with the Many-Faced God. One or both of them must die.",19,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

* Was he a Stark? It is an interesting theory, but the timelines don't add up to me. The Night King was created during the war between the Children of the Forest and the First Men. We see him created in Bran's vision. Bran the Builder, widely known as the first Stark, built the wall after the long night. The wall came up 8,000 years ago while the treaty between the Children of the Forest and First Men was signed 10,000+ years ago.
* Was he King during the first long night? If he was, how could humanity have defeated the undead if their King didn't die? How did the Last Hero defeat the army of the dead? Was there some sort of agreement between the living and the dead? Is that somehow connected to the 13th Lord Commander/Craster and offerings to The Others?
* Is he warging into his army? I'm not sure if this is common knowledge/theorizing, but the army of the dead is one guy in my opinion. I think that The Night King is a powerful greenseer and warg who controls the entire army with his mind. Every battles every individual wight fights is controlled by him.

&amp;#x200B;

Just finished watching the whole series for the 3rd time... and it's just actually this time around that I'm realizing how sub-par Emilia's acting is. In my previous viewings, I wondered where all the hate came from coz for me she's ok. But now, I'm really seeing it. If you just realize the vast and powerful armies she has at her disposal and how she amassed them, you'd imagine a queen so terrible you'd shake in your boots and you'd be in awe of her like she's a goddess...especially her coming out of flames untouched twice. But Emilia just doesn't elicit that kind of feeling. And I'm starting to agree with most that she has only two go-to facial expressions.

So...which actress could've been a more convincing Daenerys and why? Someone who can transition from innocent powerless teen to Athena-like glory.",14,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

I'm not a native english speaker so there will probably be grammatical mistakes- sorry for that and hope you enjoy it :)

1. Bran has several visions: one sees the wights approaching winterfell, another the night King in Dorne with the dragon and turning everyone into part of his army, and the last one is winterfell in flames.
2. Jon and Daenerys talk at the graves of Winterfell about the revelation that Jon is also a Targaryen. Jon is sincere and explains her about his death and resurrection, since he does not want to have more secrets with her. They talk about what it would mean for succession, but Jon says he does not want the throne. Someone interrupts the conversation by saying that Bran has had visions - he explains them everything he has seen in his visions.
3. Arya receives the arrival of the wolves.
4. Daenerys tells Jon that she is going to go with Drogon to find the Night King in the south. She says she has to kill him before his army keeps growing. Jon at first is reluctant, but she ends up convincing him.
5. We see Yara arrive at the iron islands and tell the others that they are going to help Daenerys.
6. Tormund and Jon take initiative explaining to all the armies the different dangers that the white walkers suppose, since they are the ones that have had more experience fighting against them.
7. The twin's army does not respond to any orders if Jaime is not released from his cell, so Tyrion convinces Jon to take him out for the war.
8. Cersei looks very cold at the burial of his son and says that the only thing that can satisfy the pain of this loss is when she ends all her enemies.
9. Jaime approaches Bran and apologizes for what he did to him. Bran forgives him and tells him that he has seen his journey in his visions and that now he is a good man. Then the bells rings advising the approach of wights to Winterfell.
10. Missandei says goodbye to Greyworm before the war begins.
11. Sansa has an emotional conversation with Jon about the importance of keeping Winterfell from falling.
12. Battle of Winterfell. Jon leads the Unsullied and wildings outside of winterfell, awaiting the arrival of the wights. Soon they begin to arrive and the tension is chewed in the environment. The fight begins. It looks like it's matched, but then Jon uses the surprise factor with a signal for the Dothraki to appear from their hiding place. They use a specific formation to surround all the wights in a circle, and then Bronn throws an arrow with fire from winterfell to set them on fire. They do not take long to finish with the remaining wights.

When they think that they have already won the first part of the war, they begin to notice a more intense cold and the appearance of more snow. Then White walkers appear with their horses and giants. Jon orders to fold all the troops inside winterfell, but the giants are in charge of destroying the entrance of Winterfell and the White walkers enter inside. War starts inside Winterfell.

Arya fights with the help of the wolves and kills a White Walker. Bran controls one of the dead giants to fight against the walkers. Beric Dondarrion dies in the Great War. Jaime is about to be killed by a White Walker but Brienne saves him. One of the White walkers enters the castle, and Sam and Tyrion must help Sansa and the rest of the women and children hide. Greyworm is surrounded by 3 white walkers and fights with great honor, but one of them manages to stick a sword in his heart and kill him. Jon and Tormund fight against two White walkers and kill them effectively, but suddenly Tormund receives an unexpected stab in the back and dies in front of Jon. It seems that the war is lost, but then the Armies of Iron Islands commanded by Yara and Theon arrive, and they manage to overcome the battle and finish with the remaining White walkers.

13. However, Varys is responsible for reminding those present that Euron is waiting to attack the surviving army. Then they begin to hear strong footsteps from the war elephants of the Golden Company and Jon urges everyone to return to their positions. Davos orders to throw arrows towards the army, but after all the losses they have had in the recent war against the army of the dead, it's hard to fight again. Euron orders to throw balls of fire to Winterfell, that begins to burn.

Then Jon tells everyone to stop and offers his surrender. Arya asks him angrily why he surrenders so quickly, and he says he can not let more humans die when the battle against the dead is not over yet - every human that dies is one more fighter for the army of the dead. Euron takes Jon as a prisoner and heads towards Kings Landing, but not before changing the Stark flag for the Lannister flag and leaving a representative and part of the Golden Company in Winterfell to control the north from now on, with the threat that if the north rebels, Jon will be killed at the hands of Cersei.

14. In the last scene of the episode, Daenerys is flying with Drogon and suddenly sees on the horizon the Night King with Viserion and how they fly straight towards her.",2,1,False,self,,,,,

* Biggest moment: Choices, choices, choices... but the answer is the taking of Winterfell by Theon and his Ironborn men. If Theon was really at war with the North, it was a brilliant strategic move. Of course we know it's actually a horrific blunder with disastrous consequences for many.
* Episode MVP: Osha. This wilding woman is one of the show's MVPs... for all seasons. Without her, Bran never makes it to the Three-Eyed Raven.
* Final thought: This was a great episode. The fall of Winterfall with Bran &amp; Co.'s subsequent escape. Robb's choice to allow the bastard Ramsay Snow to re-take Winterfell. Littlefinger plants the seed of a Lannister-Tyrell marriage. Arya uses her second Faceless Man murder. The riot in King's Landing with The Hound saving Sansa. And Dany loses her dragons.

I have a theory,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/at57n9/spoilers_valyrian_steel_how_was_it_made_i_have_a/,jjack339,1550767118,"I have checked around the web and cant find exactly. But I think Valyrian Steel is inspired real world Damascus Steel(Would be curious if this is confirmed anywhere). Damascus Steel like Valyrian Steel was considered to be a far superior blade compared to its contemporaries. Like Valyrian steel the knowledge of how to make it was lost and even in modern times we have not been able to replicate it.

What we do know about Damascus steels is they introduced biomass(along with trace amounts of rarer materials)  to the wootz iron ingots which combined gave it more resilience and strength. In medieval times owning a Damascus steel weapon was highly prized. 

So back to Valyrian Steel. All we know about it is that it is superior to anything blacksmiths can currently forge, it works against white walkers, and it is completely unknown how to produce more of it, but there are 3 known blacksmith who are capable of reworking it. 

So here is my theory. Valyrian steel is made from select high quality iron ore and an admixture of actual Dragon biomass (horns, maybe scales or even bone) and trace amounts of dragon glass. The dragon mass would meld with the iron to strengthen it and give it magically properties and the dragonglass would work to synergize the 2 and strengthen the effect.

This makes sense as to why the abilities to make more of it were lost. With the doom of Valyria most of not all living and written knowledge of the process was lost and with the extinction of dragons so lost was the source of biomass. 

Now I think we are going to need a few more of these. Dragonglass works for a dagger or and arrowhead, and maybe even a spear tip, but is quite unsuited for a sword or greatsword or any heavy blunt weapons.

Underneath Dragonstone is all of the Dragon glass they will ever need. Under the Red Keep there happens to be quite a of dragon biomass. We just need someone to discover the required amounts of each material in a book somewhere and a highly skill blacksmith who can make one with that knowledge...

This would also make sense why it is possible to reforge it but not create new currently. Working with the materials would be more difficult than the usual composites use due to its unique characterizes, but there is ""no magic"" involved in that part of the process, it just requires skill. The making of the metal alloy itself is where the magical properties are introduce, so once you have the correct alloy (either an already forged weapon, or maybe even ingots somewhere) you can forge the sword.

Would like to start a discussion here on the best way to run a game of thrones pool. 

My format is simply choose if each character lives or dies. Other pools I have seen here include the option to choose if the character will be turned into a wight\\WW. I choose not to include this since this has not really happened on the show so far (except for Viserion), what are your thoughts? 

Other pools include bonus questions such as ""Who will sit on the Iron Throne"", ""Who will kill the Night King"" etc. When running a pool for $ you can't include questions when you don't know if the events will even happen (what if no one sits the throne or the NK doesnt die) . Which raises a concern, what would be a full proof tie-breaker question? 

Below are my rules, pretty straightforward and the list of characters. Let me know what you think about the list, i'm concerned about a few characters such as Daario, Nymeria, Lyanna Mormont, since we don't know if they will even appear in season 8. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Predict if each character will be alive or dead at the end of season 8.

\*If a character dies and is brought back to life by the Lord of Light (i.e. Jon Snow, Beric Dondarrion) that character will be considered alive. 

\*If a character dies and is brought back as a wight or white walker (i.e. Viserion) that character will be considered dead

However, in the case of Jorah Mormont, all it took was a procedure conducted by Samwell Tarley for him to be cured. This is curious to me because I had understood up until this moment that Greyscale was irreversible except in the rare case of Shireen, allowing her survival to have more of an impact with the audience. While Samwell is a well-read individual and highly intelligent, I don't believe (or at least the characterization I have been presented with about Samwell hasn't led me to believe) that he is qualified to perform a profoundly dangerous procedure to remove Jorah's greyscale, especially when it was described to be ""highly developed.""

Just a warning.

TLDR: During my research for another theory Ive been working on related to The Gods Eye I came across a paragraph in Jainism scripture that seems very familiar. The following is the Lightbringer prophecy and below that is the Jainism text. After that Ill cover how I found it and plead for assistance.

Lightbringer Prophecy: He labored for thirty days and thirty nights until it was done. However, when he went to temper it in water, the sword broke. He was not one to give up easily, so he started over.

The second time he took fifty days and fifty nights to make the sword, even better than the first. To temper it this time, he captured a lion and drove the sword into its heart, but once more the steel shattered.

The third time, with a heavy heart, for he knew beforehand what he must do to finish the blade, he worked for a hundred days and nights until it was finished. This time, he called for his wife, Nissa Nissa, and asked her to bare her breast. He drove his sword into her living heart, her soul combining with the steel of the sword, creating Lightbringer.

Jainism Script: Travelling to the north he began to climb the highest hill he could see, but it became Nanao, ""weighed down"", by his sin. He chose another hill, but for it too the burden of guilt was too great and it became Jhurio, ""broken down"". He chose a third hill, and climbing it backwards it bore him, and he called it Dhinodhar, ""the patience bearer"".

What are the chances that this Jainism text is the real life inspiration for the Lightbringer prophecy? I think its pretty high given the way I came across it. Has this been discovered before? Ill do my best to explain how I stumbled over it.

I was in the process of trying to figure out who, or should I say what, Hugor of The Hill was. In the history of GoT he is supposed to be the first Andal King and the person that the Gods of The Seven appeared to in Andalos. The next paragraph is his description and Ill highlight why I suspect he wasnt an actual historical figure that existed as flesh and blood.

He was supposedly crowned by the Father himself who pulled down seven stars to make his crown. The Maid brought forth a girl supple as a willow with eyes like deep blue pools that Hugor took as his first wife. The Mother made her fertile, and she bore him forty-four mighty sons as foretold by the Crone. The Warrior gave each son strength of arms and the Smith wrought each a suit of iron plate. His realm was extensive, spreading from the hills of northern Andalos to the southern marches, now called the Flatlands, in the south.The Seven also promised him and his descendants great kingdoms in a foreign land.

First of all, the part about the father pulling down stars made me think of The book of Revelations. Theres a part that mentioned a woman wearing a crown of stars (Im not religious or well versed in the Bible so my apologies if I butcher this)

A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head.

Them being placed on his brow actually works as the crest of a hill if you look up the potential meaning of brow I dont think its forehead in this case.

Now, this made me think that there maybe more symbolism and personification behind this Hugor of The Hill character. My personal take is that Hugors crown of 7 stars represents the 7 kingdoms. 

Next, Hugors wife was described in a way that made me think of a river. It just so happens that the river Rhoyne is right beside Andolos and has two lakes in it that could match the deep pools for eyes.

The Crone made her fertile part makes me think of the Golden Fields that are right beside the Rhoyne.

His 4 and forty sons may be 44 additional hills that are strong like Hugor. 

Im not sure about their arms or their iron suits of armor and could use some insight if you have any.

The most important part of this and what led me to find the Jainism text is this: Hugor of the Hill may also be the Andal hero whom Pentoshi singers call Hukko

Hukko happens to mean Hookah in Gujarati. I looked up volcanoes in that province and found The Dhinodhar Hills. Theres a temple built on an extinct volcano there and the story about that temple and Dharmanatha is where I found the Lightbringer/Weightbearer text.

So what does this all mean? Well my previously posted [theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/aruszj/spoilers_a_theory_on_gods_eye_and_the_end/?st=JSANHNFD&amp;sh=ccc517cc) suggests that the Gods Eye will blow up and is at the heart of the conflict between Ice and Fire. I mentioned near the end of that theory that the 7 pointed star of the faith might have been a symbol representing the gods eye. Now while researching the first king of the Andals he appears to be a volcano (a hookah on a hill) that was personified and I may have come across the source of the Lightbringer prophecy. 

I feel like this may confirm my theory in its most basic sense, that the Gods Eye is a volcano but I need further opinions and help if possible with looking into the rest of Hugors description as well as the other legendary heroes from the Age of Heroes and before. 

Also it appears as though Varys and Perhaps Little Finger were aware of this all along. Take this back and forth between them during Baelishs famous chaos speech.

LF: The realm. Do you know what the realm is? Its the thousand blades of Aegons enemies (Baelish just said theres only 200 blades he counted before this, meaning that the story about Aegon the Conqueror is a lie). A story we agree to tell each other. Over and over until we forget that its a lie (meaning the history of Westeros has been fabricated and swayed by the victors).

Varys: But what do we have left once we abandon the lie? (He means what will happen if the truth comes out, that the history of Westeros is not what it seems.) Chaos (will ensue). A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all. ( The Gods Eye super volcano, hes being literal here but Im not sure if Baelish is aware of that.

Varys later goes on to say that Baelish would burn the whole realm to be the king of ashes. Is Varys implying that Baelish is willingly trying to set things up so the Gods Eye explodes so he can rule over whats left?

Also the blowing up of the sept of Baelor scene is heavy foreshadowing for this.

I'm a first time poster here and thought, where would i ask for opinion and critique other than the GOT reddit so, here i am. I'm partaking in a challenge (graphic design) about the Houses' sigil and creating our own versions of it. Rules were that all artwork must be UNIQUE, BOLD and APPROPRIATE.   


My train of thought was the House of Baratheon, and the surroundings of the rightful heir to the throne, hence 2 stags without a crown staring down at each other. I had 2 interpretations whilst doing it, first one was Stannis versus Renly and the second is Stannis fighting himself and others through his own visions and his inability to actually become the King of the Iron Throne.   


PLEASE, do not be mild and appropriate, say whatever it is on your mind in your critiques!

No other character has been allowed to be such an idiot and survive. Robb bailed on a marriage and beheaded one bannerman... dead. 

Margaery really only made one mistake. She did not play nice with Cersei (after the wedding when Cersei comes to her she really is quite disrespectful and right after than Cersei decides to seek out the high sparrow).

When I think about it the main reason I hate her not just because she is bad, but because she should be dead.


I can only think of one reason why she is not besides pure luck. Littlefinger. He had his hand in many of the keys deaths in the series and he knew what she was and he liked the chaos she created that he could use. If he wanted her dead she would have been and nobody but Jaime would have cared.

* Game of Thrones wiki summary: [https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/A\_Man\_Without\_Honor](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/A_Man_Without_Honor)
* Biggest moment: Theon killing ""Bran"" and ""Rickon."" I wonder if the viewer is meant to think they're actually dead. We're not, right? This is more about how weak Theon really is. But if an effort to prove he's strong, he's merely hastened his downfall.
* Episode MVP: Ygritte. Jon is already bewitched. And she uses that to lead him into an ambush.
* Final thought: Coming off the high of last episode, the one was definitely a let down. The whole House of the Undying/The Thirteen stuff was confusing. The moments between Tyrion and Cersei, as well as Tywin and Arya seem forced. It just seemed like a number of things that happen in this episode don't feel like the fit, but are there to move the story in a particular direction. Not one of my favorites.",6,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

- Jon finds out and shares that fire can kill white walkers. Again dragonfire definitely does, but Jon just threw a lantern at one to discover that weakness.

I also want to see them talk about their journey, I know we already know what happened to them but I want them to talk about it rather than gloss over it like they've done for other reunions in the past. I'd like Arya to talk about her adventures with the Brotherhood and The Hound and her training in Bravos and her new skills and her almost dying and for her to show him Needle and that she still has it despite everything. I want Jon to talk about his death and resurrection and his time beyond the wall and fighting the Army of the Dead. I want to see the look on their faces as they tell each other these things and gain more and more respect for each other. I'd also love to see Arya and Jon spa or just for Jon to see Arya's new fighting skills with Needle.

On a similar but separate note I'd love a scene where Arya is fighting The Army of the Dead but she is getting bested only for Nymeria to jump in with her massive wolf pack and start wrecking shit, followed by a scene of Jon and Arya side by side completely destroying the dead with interlaced scenes of Nymeria and Ghost teaming up and doing the same.

Ive never understood why Tywin doesnt put a stop to Joffrey humiliating Tyrion that way. Its not like he hasnt stopped Joffrey from being a jerk before; the scene where he sends Joffrey to bed comes to mind. Its also not like he hasnt protected Tyrion from Joffrey before; he makes excuses for Tyrions behavior towards Joffrey at Tryrions wedding. 

It just doesnt seem to fit within the character of Tywin to let Joffrey act that way so publicly towards a Lannister, even if its *just* Tyrion. When we first meet Tywin hes lecturing Jaime about the importance of the Lannister name and reputation; including Tyrion. I get that Tywin is often embarrassed by and ashamed of Tyrion, but he still expects Tyrion to be a proper Lannister. I feel like allowing Joffrey to behave that way towards a Tyrion damages the Lannister name and Tywins own legacy. 

Which leads me to think that maybe Tywin knew what was going to happen to Joffrey. Right before the wedding feast Tywin and Olenna walk together and discuss young love perhaps theres more than just friendly wedding chat here? Maybe Tywin knew Olenna was going to poison Joffrey, and so he saw Joffreys behavior towards Tyrion as a good way to set up Tyrion for the murder (which was a good way to get Jaime to leave the Kings Guard).

One of the most enjoyable subplots from early on in the series is the spy vs. spy exchanges between Little Finger and Varys. Im watching Season 3, Episode 4 where Varys has a great exchange with Lady Olenna where he admits to having the utmost respect for Little Finger, but He would see the realm burned to ashes if he could sit on the Iron Throne and call himself king or something like that. Meanwhile its made clear repeatedly that Lord Varys is working for the good of the Realm. And that juxtaposition is what I thought should be the ultimate showdown at the end of the story. Varys fighting for the good of the Realm and Little Finger fighting for his own gain, both from behind the scenes, both through an intricate battle of wits.
And while I do like that Little Finger was outwitted by the Starks and not as clever or informed as he thought, I still wanted him to get to the end, thinking hes winning, only to have Varys pull the throne out from under him in the final moments.

I was wondering how people in the UK would watch season 8 when it's released. I started when Season 7 was airing and used Showbox on my phone and dodgy sites like 123movies on my PS4.

Since everyone in my family watches the show now, I'd like to watch it on TV however it seems like the only option is Sky Atlantic (which I don't have). 

I don't want to watch the final season on some 480p stream I found online, does anyone know if NowTV works or something of the sorts?

* Game of Thrones wiki summary: [https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/The\_Prince\_of\_Winterfell](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/The_Prince_of_Winterfell)
* Biggest moment: Catelyn releasing Jaime. There's a lot of talk about how awful Catelyn's decisions are throughout the series... and it's hard to argue that. But she's just learned that two of her children are dead and she believes two of her other children are hostages of her enemy. She thinks it's her job to do all she can to save them.
* Episode MVP: Arya. She's a survivor. And she'll always be. She needed to get out and to do so, she gave Jaqen his own name.
* Final thought: If you think Catelyn makes bad decisions, how about Robb turning to Lady Talisa. He signs his own death warrant. Jon, on the other hand, makes the right decision, and kills Qhorin Halfhand. Then there is Theon's continued idiocy and his hope to hold Winterfell. And Tyrion's decision to use Wildfire, which proves valuable. Finally, Cersei's decision to take Ros.  She's a lot like Catelyn in that she makes rash decisions she thinks will protect her children.",12,14,False,spoiler,,,,,

And to make this more interesting, let's write out how *exactly* the finale is going to be like - what the final 3 scenes are going to be and why do you think that will be the case.

I'll start with mine:

**3rd Final Scene: Sansa Stark ascends the throne**

* Probably going to spark some debate/controversy about this, especially when I make this prediction to my friends. But I'm going with this prediction anyway!
* The idea is that by the end of the show, Sansa would be the only main character remaining with the attributes to rule Westeros. Prior to this, Jon Snow would have sacrificed his own life battling the long night (cue Azor Ahai prophecies), and so would Daenerys (cue the vision at Qarth and the reunion with Khal Drogo). Cersei would also be dead by now, after being killed by his own brother (cue Maggie the Frog) - my guess is Jamie is the one who deals the killing blow, and kills himself after that.
* With the Night King and the army of the dead defeated, Winter is gone and Spring is here. Apart from Sansa, the remaining Starks are 1) Bran, who is bound to continue as the Three Eyed Raven, and 2) Arya, who has always been up for adventures (e.g. finding out what's West of Westeros) rather than ruling. This leaves Sansa the only remaining Stark who has the character and personal experiences to take over the iron throne. 
* Aside from the Starks, at this juncture there is unlikely to be any other main character alive that could be more suitable on the throne. 
* Sansa sits on the throne, declares herself the new ruler of the seven kingdoms, and for once in the show all seven kingdoms are finally in unison. Peace and harmony dawns upon Westeros, revitalised by the scent of Spring in the air.

**2nd Final Scene: Tyrion and the Imp's Delight**

* A little bias on this, since Tyrion is my favourite character throughout the show. In one of the episodes in Season 6, Tyrion mentions to Grey Worm and Missandei that if he ever gets to retire, he would want to have a vineyard of his own. In this vineyard, he has a special drink called the Imp's Delight, only to be shared amongst special people around him.
* In this 2nd final scene, we see an old version of Tyrion living his retirement dream. A lush vineyard with plenty of wine to offer, and there is Tyrion sharing some good ol' Imp's Delight with the special people who deserve it. 
* In this scene we also finally find out what it is about that joke regarding the jackass and the honeycomb.

**Final Scene: Samwell Tarly in the Library at Oldtown**

* Finally, the last scene *ever* of what has been an incredible TV series. Here, we see an old version of Samwell Tarly, smiling to himself while writing down the last few parts of a long manuscript. Cluttered all around his desk are piles and pages of ink-on-paper, with each page narrating all the intricate details of each and every event that happened during ASOIAF and before, starting from the Mad King and Robert's Rebellion. 
* The camera zooms in to the final words of the final page. And voila, Samwell pens down the final word and ends it off with the final full stop. And there it is - all the events before and during Game of Thrones, finally inked on paper for all future generations of Westeros to read. 
* Samwell ends off with a big smile, and the camera pans out to above, hovering over the chandelier that hangs down from the roof of the library. The same chandelier that we see during the opening song of every episode in Game of Thrones.

My logic.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/atwoie/spoilers_making_a_bet_on_who_will_rule_at_the_end/,igcetra,1550936562,"If you know how betting works this will be straightforward. But, otherwise it works like this: if a bet is negative it is favorited, positive is the underdog. For example a -200 bet means that if to win $100 you need to bet $200, if it was +200 it's the opposite: if you bet $100 you win $200.

Anyways, on to the actual post content. So the favorite is Bran at -150. I don't think that he has any interest in ruling and is beyond that so I'll rule that out immediately. Next favorite is Jon Snow at +600 which leads me to the following. If I bet 5 bets of 1u different ones I would profit at least 1u if one of them was to win. I would do the following:

1u Jon Snow +600

1u Jon/Daenerys baby +1000

1u Tyrion +1000

1u The Night King +1000

1u Daenerys +1200

Those are my best guesses for who would rule. I'm skipping Sansa. Anyone else is kind of a stretch. Unless they do something that leaves the ending ambiguous. That's my logic - to make 5 single bets and it would be an almost lock and profit. Worse comes to worst I'll be out of 5u but I think this is a really good method for profiting. Say that Jon Snow wins, I would profit 1u. What do you think?",14,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

I've obviously been rewatching all the episodes in preparation for the new season, and just watched the episode where Joffrey gets poisoned (season 4 ep 2). The widely accepted theory is that Sansa's necklace had a poisoned crystal, which Olenna Tyrell sneakily took off while she was talking to Sansa in the scene before Joffrey dies. You can look back at the scene or watch Youtube videos that show her necklace missing a crystal (should be 6 crystals in total) as Olenna is finished talking with her. I was completely fine with this theory, until:

&amp;#x200B;

In the NEXT EPISODE, Sansa goes with Dantos to Petyr Baelish on a ship, where Baelish takes off her necklace and crunches one of the crystals with his sword to show her that it was fake. When they show the close up of him crunching it, THERE ARE NOW 6 CRYSTALS ON THE NECKLACE! The one he crunches is the one that Olenna supposedly took off to poison Joffrey. This is the point where I started losing my mind, because it seems that nobody on the entire internet has caught this?

&amp;#x200B;

Either: A) The show creators somehow missed this giant detail in the Baelish crunching necklace scene, or B) The necklace didn't have any poison at all, and the one Sansa wore in the scene talking to Olenna just happened to be missing a crystal and nobody on set cared to fix that detail. It can't be both.

&amp;#x200B;

Please discuss and put my mind at ease so I can sleep at night.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

I've obviously been rewatching all the episodes in preparation for the new season, and just finished the episode where Joffrey gets poisoned (season 4 ep 2). The widely accepted theory is that Sansa's necklace had a poisoned crystal, which Olenna Tyrell sneakily took off while she was talking to Sansa in the scene before Joffrey dies. You can look back at the scene or watch Youtube videos that show her necklace missing a crystal (should be 6 crystals in total) as Olenna is finished talking with her. I was completely fine with this theory, until:

In the NEXT EPISODE, Sansa goes with Dantos to Petyr Baelish on a ship, where Baelish takes off her necklace and crunches one of the crystals with his sword to show her that it was fake. When they show the close up of him crunching it, THERE ARE NOW 6 CRYSTALS ON THE NECKLACE! The one he crunches is the one that Olenna supposedly took off to poison Joffrey. This is the point where I started losing my mind, because it seems that nobody on the entire internet has caught this. WTF?

Either: A) The show creators somehow missed this giant detail in the Baelish crunching necklace scene, or B) The necklace didn't have any poison at all, and the one Sansa wore in the scene talking to Olenna just happened to be missing a crystal and nobody on set cared to fix that detail. It can't be both. If it's the latter, then did Olenna just slip poison into the cup herself without help from Sansa's necklace? If so, why the whole necklace storyline in the first place?

Please discuss and put my mind at ease so I can sleep at night.",7,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Hey everyone, Im a high schooler who started a podcast interviewing people with different jobs to teach teenagers about different careers in the workforce, and I had the pleasure to talk to David J. Peterson, who created the Dothraki language, and I wanted to share with the community what the process is like creating languages / how David got started. You can find the entire 40-minute audio interview on the bottom! Thanks! 


-


**If someone asks you what your job title is, what would you say?**

I would say Im a language creator, thats what I do after all.

**What would you say the job description entitles for being a language creator?**

Oh, I dont know exactly. First, you should know that the job is unique - at least so far in it being a career. There had been many people that have been paid to create languages for things, but I think Im the first and only person in history who has actually made a career out of it, where the only way I earn money is by creating languages. 
Anyway, for the job description, I basically just create languages for a television or film property. Thats the whole thing from the ground up: the first step is working with the producer or director or showrunner to figure out what time of a language they want. The second step is creating the language, or the lexicon and that they are consistent with everything that Ive created before. By the time Im still on a show and working on season 3 or season 4, mostly my job is identical of that of a translator, with the exception that if there is a word that I dont have, Ill need to create it, or create some strategy for translating it, as opposed to a translator who works with an established dictionary.

**Are you ever on set?**

I am almost never on set. There are occasions where I have been on the set, just to visit, there was one production, Bright, where I was on set the entire day, but aside from that most of the time I receive a script, whether a script for a movie or television show, the script coordinator tags the lines from the script that need to be translated into one or more languages, depending on how many I have done for that show. I get all those lines and I put them together in a document and translate them, record all the lines on mp3, and then I send them back to the script coordinator who distributes it to the actors.

He was so amazing to talk to and I really appreciated getting a perspective from an extremely unique job. So I just want to thank David again for taking the time to do the interview :)

When Jon is revealed to be the true heir to the throne, how will Dany react? Shes spent her life building to the moment when she sits on the iron throne.

Tywin: You've allowed that boy to ride roughshod over you and everyone else in this city.

The choreography of the sword fight is incredible! typically two swords is kind of cheesy imo, but it really looks as though it was effective as a style, making him far superior to Ned Starkwhom in old age was considered one of the best swordsman in the Seven Kingdoms and comparable to Jaime Lannister. Honestly the only sword fight that is close to as good is Jon Snow v. White Walker in Hardhome.  I didnt get past the first book in ASOIF so I dont know if Dayne is mentioned more often in the books.

So  I realise this is a common and likely true theory regarding Rhaegal. As hes named after Rhaegar, it makes sense for Jon Snow to be his rider due to him being Rhaegar's son and a Targaryen. 

However i've always assumed it would be Tyrion who rides Rhaegal. Why? Obviously it's my own theory. It's noted that Drogon, Viserion and Rhaegal cannot be tamed, but with dragons a bond can be formed. Now obviously Jon can bond with Rhaegal I'm not gonna deny the more likely scenario. Just why would Rhaegal effectively trust Jon enough, it to ME seems Rhaegal has already a trust in Tyrion. Though I've never read the books(correct me if i'm wrong) Rhaegal to the best of my knowledge is noted to be an intelligent Dragon. In the show this is also evident.

Tyrion for the dragons sake of knowing captivity stunts their growth, enters the chamber holding the 2 chained dragons(also obviously letting 2 dragons starve themselves is a bad idea). Rhaegal is the first to be freed. It's obvious he seems to listen to Tyrion, growing up with a human mother seems to me he can kind off understand english, at the very least understands, ""oh he's talking, he is friendly, he will not harm me"". Viserion also quickly knows Tyrions there to unchain them, after watching Tyrion unchain Rhaegal. 

Watching this scene makes me believe if Rhaegal had to choose right here and now his rider he'd pick Tyrion. Obviously  I could(likely) be wrong. 
However the show could pull this on us in my opinion. After all jon has one of the few  blades that can kill white walkers. However you may argue he may give Jorah or Lyanna Longclaw with no exceptions. I could see Jon fighting the dead on while Tyrion, not a fighter but is intelligent, rides a notable intelligent dragon. A dragon intelligent enough to know this man freed him from his dark prison. 

If somehow i'm correct I hope Tyrion's fireproof!!!

Do feel free to dispute this. I just personally feel Tyrion's earned Rhaegal's friendship. Besides Jon has Longclaw, He's a king, Sansa, Arya, Bran, Sam to reunite with, he's a Night King to slay. And don't forget Ghost. Who else is gonna help him maul the wights???? Thats enough characters Jon needs to see without focusing on him.

After all someome who can control Dany's natural conquering urges is worthy of befriending other Dragons in my opinion.

Whatever your feelings on this, a main character's perhaps surprising death in Episode 1 would definitely have a big cultural impact (social media, really, I guess) and let viewers know that the story can go anywhere this season, and nobody is necessarily safe.

So, who do you all think this would be, assuming that my random thought while I was driving to work was correct? Jaime getting anticlimactically killed en route North might seemingly not do his arc justice, but maybe his decision to leave Cersei was all we were meant to see. Or maybe Sansa gets herself killed in surprise action as the commoners flee south in chaos (not sure about that one, lol). Jorah could finally just die fighting someone, or Davos, or Grey Worm.

Brienne's arc doesn't seem complete without Jaime, so I feel she's not an early death, however I feel Jamie's arc doesn't really need more Brienne than he's already seen. Cersei dying early would be surprising in that the plot of the season would be accelerated more than expected and not see many human v human fighting.

Okay that's all, I mostly wanted to see some discussion so I will kindly stop typing examples as they cross into my head.",33,14,False,spoiler,,,,,

If you can build a wall 300 miles (482 kilometers) long, about 700 feet tall (213 meters) and 300 feet thick (91 meters), why so little defense for the army that has to hold it?

It struck me as obvious on my recent rewatch, so without further ado here it is: 

In season 7, Sam spends most of his time at the citadel. Most of his time there is devoted to various busywork and particularly, cleaning. He cleans many things shown to us in a montage, particularly, he cleans poop. Yes, that's right, it's poop. Most of this montage is devoted to cleaning poop. Now, us as the viewers have no clue as to whose poop Sam is cleaning, or why? To answer this question we have to go back, before the events of the series. To Robert's Rebellion.

Rhaegar Targaryen. He's a mysterious figure in the series, there's no doubt. We are told he was killed at the Battle of the Trident, that Robert Baratheon killed him in single combat. We're told from other sources outside the show that Rhaegar's breastplate was studded with rubies. Where else do we see a ruby prominently in the series? Ah yes, Melisandre's glamor necklace which disguises her as young and attractive when she's really an old hag.

Let's say Rhaegar was using this magic. Being the prince of the Iron Throne, he may have had means to obtain something like this. Rhaegar sent someone else in his stead, who died as him in the battle. We never see a flashback of Rhaegar's death, only his marriage with Lyanna. It's commonly said in this series that no one really dies unless you see it happen on screen (See: The Hound), and even then, they could still come back (Jon). So about Rhaegar's personality? We know he sings, plays the harp, he's solemn and brooding. He's studious. He knows about prophecies and we can assume he spends some time readings. We also know from Barristan's story that he likes to pretend that he's not Rhaegar... but a street player... What group of people do we know of that forfeit their names and titles, that spend their time reading and learning? That's right the maesters.

So Rhaegar ""died"" at the trident, and fled to the Citadel to become a maester. But the maesters are smart (they read books), they would know a Targaryen when they saw one. They send Aemon to the Wall, to keep him from working in favor of his own house, ensuring he forfeits his bloodline indefinitely in the most apolitical place in Westeros. They would know Rhaegar. It's ambiguous how much the maesters know, or what's in their little forbidden books section, as Sam so desperately wants to know, yet they prevent him from gaining access too, seemingly laughing off his pleas about the White Walkers. What if the maesters knew about the White Walkers though?

So, Rhaegar is at the Citadel, but what is he doing? Let's say the maesters know about dragonglass in their spooky books section. Maybe they knew how to make it? But how? Targaryens have the blood of Old Valyria, a a magical bloodline of dragonriders and prophecy rearing and other spooky shit. What if the maesters decided, with the throne usurped, they'd perform some experiments on Rhaegar, who is believed to be dead. Maybe this is where Qyburn got kicked out or something? It's like poetry. It rhymes. To ensure he doesn't die, maybe they have him breed to make more of those with Targaryen blood, to continue their experiments, too. Who knows? It's possible.

Now, Sam comes along, years later. From the Night's Watch, talking about White Walkers and the army of the dead. They know Sam can be of good use to them, but they can't show their hand just yet unless they trust him of course. So they send him off doing all manners of novice duty. Particularly, Sam is emptying chamber pots. A lot of them. Tons and tons of poop. They have a room that's just full of shitting people. After that, Sam is shown taking poop to a specific room INSIDE THE CITADEL, not outside, not in an outhouse, not to the water, no. They keep the poop inside. I'm serious. 40 seconds in. But before that, take a look 37 seconds in. There's an old man that Sam is collecting poop from. Take a careful look at this scene. There's a hole cut out in the bottom of his bed just for poop. I mean, look at the guys face. He's been lying there shitting for the maesters for years, no doubt. It's a pained, and regretful face, emotion conveyed beautifully. It's s
o obvious it's unbelievable. Have you guessed it already? That man, that Sam collects poop from... that's Rhaegar Targaryen, rightful heir to the Iron Throne. The maesters, have been gathering his poop. The others in that poop room? His direct descendants. All his children. Their poop is taken directly to a special holding chamber inside the Citadel.

Why though? Why on earth would the maesters confine a bunch of Targs including Rhaegar himself to a chamber in the citadel, shitting their lives away? Well it's simple. Obvious in fact. DRAGONGLASS IS PETRIFIED TARGARYEN POOP. THE MAESTERS KNOW ABOUT THE WHITE WALKERS. THEY'RE STOCKPILING DRAGONGLASS TO PREPARE FOR THE LONG NIGHT 2.0. THEY'RE GOING TO ARM JON AND DANY WITH DRAGONGLASS TO FIGHT THE NIGHT KING. JON WILL BE REUNITED WITH HIS REAL FATHER. If you don't believe this, think about Dragonstone... an island of dragonglass. The Targs lived on Dragonstone... it's made of their poop. The Valyrian Roads? Poop. It's all poop. The key to killing the Night King? Jon's poop.",5,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

Others think The Hound (doesnt have to be HER little brother). 

So, hear me out, and correct me if this is impossible.....

What if she dies in childbirth? Or a miscarriage infection? Or something like that? If the fetus was a male, it would be the little brother of her other three.

Was she just trying to uproot him from castle black to march on Winterfell? Did she plan to burn him? Would Stannis still be alive if Jon had succumbed? I cant imagine Jon keeping his cool when Stannis sacrifices Shireen. 

Its been a while and I cant quite remember how Jons death and Melisandre saving him plays out. I know hes dead for quite a while before she is able to bring him back.

Its only right for The Hound and The Mountain to square off for one final fight. I feel it could play out like this:

The Mountain and The Hound meet in the battlefield or wherever, and after The Hound says some (most likely harsh) words, the fight begins. The Mountains strength is difficult to match, and it seems the fight is in The Mountains favor. The Hound is knocked to the ground a few times and defends himself, but is simply being overpowered. The fight then slows, and The Hound begins channeling his hate and knows this fight determines his fate. Desperate to win, he has to face his greatest fear (thanks to The Mountain)...fire. The Hound has been plagued by his fear of fire all series long-it freezes him in combat and even caused him to flee at the Battle of the Blackwater. He absolutely hates fire. But its his best chance to beat The Mountain. After spending time with The Brotherhood Without Banners (a group put together by Ned Stark specifically to bring The Mountain to justice) he draws blood and lights his own sword ablaze, just like Ser Beric does, and strikes down The Mountain. Fire scarred The Hound, but kills The Mountain.

So, rather than cancel Stannis' death and have him win the iron throne (though I'd like that), my question is how would you get him to where he had to get, but in a process that made more sense.

Like, one thing I disliked about season 7 was how it made Jon into a chump. 

Instead, I'd have Jon learning about the dragonglass on dragonstone back in season 5 from Sam (why Sam didn't believe stannis is beyond me). Between season 6 and 7, he sends miners supervised by Lord Hornwood and Ser Davos to supervise them, who get captured when Dany's fleet arrives. While it is a risk, Jon is going out of loyalty for men who fought for him.",16,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

I say that Jaime seeing Cersei pursue the throne at the cost of innocent lives just as Jaime is starting to gain some humanity after losing his hand has shown him that Cersei is indeed a monster incapable of love.

He argues that he is giving her room so that they both can have a future together and that he continues fighting just for her.

 Here we are a few weeks out and I thought at this point Id be climbing up the wall but with each passing week I dont feel it building up.

And from that excited look on her face, I realized she has always been a traveler and a person who wants to see and experience things.
That brought to my mind that moment in season 6 when she is being rescued by that actress in Bravoos (Lady Crane?), and they have a conversation on how Arya wants to explore those lands beyond Essos, Sothoryos and the others I suppose.
What if Arya manages to survive and decides to sail across the sea or to go and explore the rest of the world? It would be a great ending for her, maybe ending the show in the same way they ended season 4, with Arya sailing to reach Bravoos.
Also, Maisie Williams (the actress that portrays Arya), stated that in her last scene on the show, she was alone.

Has the home of the White Walkers been in front of us this whole time? 

https://imgur.com/a/b06m1l0

Spotted this during the opening credits (S3) and I don't know if this has been pointed out before, but that looks like some kind of structure beyond the Wall, maybe one we haven't seen before. Is this the home or some outpost of the WW we've yet to, but will eventually, visit? Or is it that place where they transformed the human baby into a walker? It looks larger than the other mountains and hills beyond the Wall, and seems of a size with Winterfell and other cities/castles, but I was just curious if anyone had noticed this or had any theories.

The Unsullied and Dothraki arrive in the North. Confirmed by the snow and surronding area with Arya. That means the Unsullied manage to either March or sail to Winterfell alongside the Dothraki who sail from Dragonstone to Winterfell.

That also means following time and distance. The Night King has still not pushed deep enough to winterfell yet and is possibly still in the area dedicated to the Nights Watch and Wildlings possibly hinting that something has distracted the Night King and his massive army for a while.

1)This is all TV show ONLY speculation.

2) Im not saying this *is* something; (not yet) Im just asking your thoughts regarding this idea and looking for any evidence in support... and evidence against this idea.

Mkay?  Great, lets begin. 

- Do Missandei &amp; Grey Worm work together to shed some light on Varys? What are we supposed to be learning about Eunuchs?

Heres how this strange idea materialized.
S4E8: The Mountain and The Viper

When peddling the Essos storyline forward, we see the Unsullied bathing in a stream (or some kind of water feature). Grey Worm pops his head above the water and sees Missandei doing the laundry just a short distance away. She is naked.  She stands. He stares. 

Cut to: Daenerys braiding Missandeis hair. She tells Daenerys that Grey Worm was interested in checking out the nakedness on display.

Daenerys is confused. We are all confused. Then she poses the question if the pillar and stones are removed in castration. Missandei says, IDK.

Cut to: the next scene features Missandei entering the Mereenese Throne room.  She stares at the Throne, dreamily approaching it.  She is only stopped when Grey Worm enters to apologize for staring at her naked body earlier at the watering hole.

This raised some questions for me:

1) Why is Missandei in the Throne room alone staring at the throne? Does she secretly lust for power?
2) Does the Missandei/Grey Worm storyline actually serve a purpose?
3) Do I need to go back and rewatch all Missandeis scenes?
4) Is this some sort of clue about Varys?

It sounds weird, I know, but watching this string of a few scenes made me remember LF &amp; Varys talking about Varyss missing man parts in the Throne room in KL. And made me recall Varys telling Oberyn Martell that a lack of desire allows him to chase other pursuits... as Varys casually looks at the Throne, smiles, and walks away.

It just made the scenes with Missandei finally feel like they had a point.

1) Why is she in the Throne room alone? Does Missandei secretly lust for power?
- How did I never notice that she was standing in the Mereenese Throne room fantasizing about the Throne?  Yes, I have no proof she was fantasizing.  But, the way she stared at it and approached it was reminiscent of the way LF used to stare at the Throne.  We know he was a trusted advisor to the King. We know he lusted for power.  Are we supposed to take a hint here?    Idk, thats not enough to make me suspect that she has ulterior motives, but I have a nagging feeling that the scene should serve a purpose.

2) Does the Missandei/Grey Worm storyline actually serve a purpose?
- Yeah, Im not the biggest fan of these two.  I have trouble understanding the purpose of exploring their unique love affair when it seems to take time away from the many other main characters that I actually care about.  It just feels frivolous.  It feels like an excuse to show Missandei naked as much as possible. Well, it did until tonight. Now Im rethinking that and wondering if their is a much larger plot at work here.

3) Do I need to go back and rewatch all Missandeis scenes?
- Yep, thats the plan.

4) Is this some sort of clue about Varys?
- Maybe.  It feels like it is, but until I can focus on her scenes to see if anything else she says or does supports this I dont know if I can make an educated guess just yet.  I will say this, the show has a lot of Eunuchs. Varys, Theon, and Grey Worm are all characters deeply rooted in the narrative.  Varys in particular stands out because it has been repeated so often that he is a eunuch. LF asks Varys about his balls, Tyrion makes jokes about it, Ros checks, Oberyn inquires...
And Varys iterates that he has no desire. Desires make people do foolish things.  He preaches his pious loyalty to the realm and for a long time I believed him.  But, maybe the Missandei/Grey Worm relationship is a way to discredit what Varys is saying.  Missandei &amp; Grey Worm started as lowly slaves in Essos and have risen to powerful positions in service to a crown.  This is similar to Varys own rags to riches.  Missandei was sold by her master to a woman who burns people and unknowingly employs blood magic. Varys master sold him to a man who would castrate him &amp; Burn his parts in some blood magic ritual.  Grey Worm &amp; Varys were both castrated.  It sort of feels like Missandei and Grey Worm are acting together to mirror Varys.

I am wondering if any of you guys think that there are parallels here. Could Missandei &amp; Grey Worm give us clues to let us know what Varys true motives are? Or is Missandei planning to betray Daenerys? Or none of the above? 

Regardless of your view, Id appreciate some insight or evidence instead of the usual knee jerk reactions to alternative ideas presented here:
Wtf?
Not everything is foreshadowing
This is the dumbest idea

And from that excited look on her face, I realized she has always been a traveler and a person who wants to see and experience things.
That brought to my mind that moment in season 6 when she is being rescued by that actress in Bravoos (Lady Crane?), and they have a conversation on how Arya wants to explore those lands beyond Essos, Sothoryos and the others I suppose.
What if Arya manages to survive and decides to sail across the sea or to go and explore the rest of the world? It would be a great ending for her, maybe ending the show in the same way they ended season 4, with Arya sailing to reach Bravoos.

I think she is and always has acted like a rational agent. 

To give an example: She has decided not to send her forces North to fight the White Walkers. Her view is that either she goes North, fails and dies or she goes North wins but is weakened and now must fight Dani (also weakened) for the throne or she stays home and Dani wins in which case she now can fight a weakened Dani or she stays home and Dani loses so now she can fight a weakened White Walker army and not have to fight Dani for the throne.

The destruction of the Sept was rational behaviour given that the army of the faithful had ceased to be a useful took and had in fact become a threat. The suicide of King Tommen was unforeseeable I think, or at least improbable. 

There are far more examples than this one and in each of them she has acted rationally.

The cases where she ""appears"" to have been at fault weren't actually her fault: the killing of Ned was a result of her inability to control Joffrey, the order to kill Tyrion on the battlefield was Joffrey's not Cersei's, the attempted assassination of Brandon was ordered by Jaimie without the knowledge of Cersei and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

The one case of her being irrational and cruel is revealed when we learn of her treatment of Tyrion as a baby and small child. Of course she herself was a child at this time which is an explanation if not a justification.

So why is Cersei regarded as such a monster? Why do we esteem cleverness in Tyrion but despise it in Cersei? Why do we esteem ambition for the throne in Dani but despise it in Cersei? I think it is possible that some people cannot accept a strong woman beating men at their own game when that woman does not also possess the kind of female-typical, caring, loving, generous attributes shown by Dani for example. There may be other reasons but I personally think this is a factor.",25,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

Undead giants (at least 3, probably even more) with bows being able to shoot ballista arrows at the 2 remaining dragons?

Unsullied probably have no dragonglass spears/tips vs. the wights. Will be interesting to see. Wights being able to withstand lots of damage. As long as the Unsullied can hold the line and keep the dead away with the spears it should be kinda fine. Once the dead breaks in and it will be melee I think it will be a slaughter once the wights swarm the Unsullied.

White Walkers will probably kick ass in melee vs. ordinary soldiers. We don't know how many they are. Maybe 10 left?

Night King with magical powers (seismic groundslam) flying undead Viserion, probably vs. Drogon &amp; Dany?

Imagine Cerseis armies and the Golden Company showing up at Dany &amp; Jons backs when they are winning the battle against the Army of the Dead. Maybe giving the Night King even more troops to raise?

&amp;#x200B;

Do you think the battle will be concluded at Winterfell or do you think Night King will come to the Riverlands and the God's Eye? Maybe King's Landing?",29,8,False,spoiler,,,,,

It's a chance to talk about your favorite moments and lines... or complain about something you didn't like.

Today, it's ""Valar Morghulis"":

* Game of Thrones wiki summary: [https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Valar\_Morghulis](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Valar_Morghulis)
* Biggest moment: The House of the Undying. There is a lot to unpack here regarding her visions. I would direct you to this post, which has it's own theories: [https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/6tc0lr/everything\_danys\_vision\_in\_the\_house\_of\_the/?sort=top](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/6tc0lr/everything_danys_vision_in_the_house_of_the/?sort=top), as well as this video from Alt Shift X: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tuNsMZQbqw&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tuNsMZQbqw&amp;feature=youtu.be). The visions are important, but not the biggest moment in this scene. It's ""Dracarys,"" one word from Daenerys that demonstrates the power she wields.
* Episode MVP:  Jaqen H'ghar. Maybe not an obvious choice for this episode, Dany's dragons were a possibility, as are Brienne and perhaps the Ironborn who betrayed Theon. But this is the episode where we get to see a Faceless Man become a Faceless Man. And Arya receives the coin which will eventually make her No one.
* Final thought: In retrospect, it's a really good episode. At the time, however, Dany's scenes were rather confusing. And I get why they chose to end the season with the marching White Walkers, but I'm not sure we really feel the threat they provide at this point in the series.",8,13,False,spoiler,,,,,

The choreography of the sword fight is incredible! typically two swords is kind of cheesy imo, but it really looks as though it was effective as a style, making him far superior to Ned Starkwhom in old age was considered one of the best swordsman in the Seven Kingdoms and comparable to Jaime Lannister. Honestly the only sword fight that is close to as good is Jon Snow v. White Walker in Hardhome.  I didnt get past the first book in ASOIF so I dont know if Dayne is mentioned more often in the books. Anyways, I hope we get some great sword duels in season 8.

Later we see Tyrion coming back to Dragon Pit followed by Cersei and the guards.

So is there any chance that Tyrion plotted with Cersei to save Lannister name and knows about the Cersei's plan about Golden Company and not marching north?

This could also explain the stern look on Tyrion's face while Jon and Daenerys were having sex. If he has plotted against Daenerys and sees Jon and Dany forming an alliance by marriage or something else, then that's a threat to Tyrion as well. 

Also in some interview I had seen Peter Dinklage was baffled when asked something about his character. (Like he did not mention anything, but it just seemed to me he was confused)

Jamie kills Cersei, and it won't be via Arya Stark using his face.
2. Jamie will die in Brienne's arms. In a way, he does love Brienne because she sees who he really is, so when he mentioned dying in the arms of the woman he loves, that will come true but in a different way.
3. Theon defeats Euron and dies saving Yara. Yara will rule the Iron Islands.
4. Melisandre will return from Volantis with the Fiery Hand to aid in the battle against the Army of the Dead. The Night King will kill her, but not before the Fiery Hand makes a difference in the Battle with Fire.
5. Varys endgame is to do away with the Iron Throne completely, bringing power to the people. He will turn on Daenerys but will get caught and killed by Tyrion. I do not believe Drogon will kill Varys and that Tyrion will kill him first, much like Jon Snow did with Mance Rayder.
6. Jon Snow will find out who he is, but ultimately will choose to keep it secret, accepting the destiny that he earned for himself as Jon Snow.
7. Sansa will become Queen of the North, surviving the Great Way and keeping the Houses of the North United.
8. Viserion will kill Rhaegal before Drogon kills Viserion.
9. Bran along with Sam discovers what the Night King is really trying to accomplish and they figure out how to stop him, and Bran realizes that he isn't just seeing moments in time, but can actually travel there, but in the process Bran gets trapped in time. Bran's story will be left open ended for future stories.
10. I think ultimately the Night King is trying to find a way to re-set the timeline to get his life back or something similar to that. I do think they will have to explain his endgame and not just make him a monster.
11. Tyrion will die saving Daenerys from the Night King. Tyrion will KILL the Night King.
12. Daenerys is wounded by the Night King and lives long enough to give birth, seeing her child before she dies. I am sure of this prediction. Her mother died in childbrith, as did Tyrion and Jon Snow's mothers. This will be her fate.
13. So many fans expect Jon Snow to die and I think he will survive. He will not assume the role of king. I believe he will tell everyone that Gendry is the rightful heir and I think Gendry will rule, although the actual Iron Throne will have been destroyed. Also, I think the 7 Kingdoms will be split up with each having their own leaders, such as Sansa and Yara.
14. Arya wants to leave Westeros to explore the West, but decides to stay and be the wife of Gendry. ( I go back and forth on Arya leaving to go West but ultimately I think she stays with Gendry)
15. Jon Snow leaves Westeros with the baby and discovers that Drogon is following them. I think we will see a Dragon egg unhatched maybe from Drogon in Jon's posession. a Future Dragon for Jon's child.
16. Sam is seen to be the writer of the story and finishes the book and names it the Song of Fire and Ice.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

Here goes.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Jon and Dany defeat the NK pretty early on, with significant losses. Possibly with the help of Bran (I believe that the NK's power of raising and controlling the dead is very similar to - if not identical with - warging. Just a lot more powerful version of it, maybe whiteseeing instead of greenseeing).
2. Cersei attacks them (including Jaime, who possibly helped Jon &amp; Co. in the battle against the NK) in the back while they're collecting themselves after the battle, all seems lost for the North.
3. Mel arrives back to Westeros, smiles, sacrifices herself in a fire, R'hllor is resurrected.
4. Now nothing stands in the way of the shadow / fire (R'hllor might be the lord of fire instead of lord of the light, lost in translation during millenia etc.), NK was essentially keeping the balance. He felt the shadow getting stronger (red priestesses, dragons, warlocks), so he pushed south to even out the odds. He was never emotional about humans / andals, he has no emotion, he was doing what he was programmed to do (""you will fly"" meant maybe being the 3ER, maybe warging into a gigantic ice wight dragon).
5. The shadow attacks the south / KL first. Jaime rushes back, he still loves Cersei. Arrives at the last moment, hug, I love you, I know. Cersei pulls out a bottle of milk of the poppy, Jaime says nope, he has Widow's wail. Only a cunt names his sword. Stabs Cersei, enter Queenslayer. Drops sword, drops armor, drops fake arm. Finally redeemed, he is his true self (and Cersei hated the arm). Steps out to face shadow alone, is consumed.
6. North is in trouble, but there is a solution according to Sam. There must always be a NK. (misinterpreted during the thousands of years since the last time this happened). Dragonglass into the heart of the prince that was promised (or even maybe Bran, but most likely Jon, ""no. it has to be me"" etc.), WW army raised, this time on the ""good"" side.
7. Huge battle ensues, literally ice and fire.
8. South (KL, Highgarden, Dorne etc.) obliterated, new NK marches back north. ""Stay, no. there must always be a NK"".
9. Sansa warden of the North, basically the same as Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, since there are no kingdoms left.
10. Arya maybe hand to her, maybe goes off wandering as the hand of death (serving the many faced god)
11. No idea what happens to Tyrion, Varys, Dany, Bran, Meera, possibly all die during the battles. Except for Bronn. He survives everything.
12. Sansa alone in the throne room / Godswood (in Winterfell), Sam as maester writing the story, Tormund as Lord Commander of the new Night's Watch.

Did Varys ever wonder why the murder attempt was thwarted? I'm sure he wasn't anticipating on Jorah (after getting his pardon) to save her life.

(usually I just close up with ufc but I noticed GoT tonight and I think that might be the new ting). 

During the main scene for the Night King where he throws his dragon killer, he strikes a major resemblance to Bran, mostly in the way they pull their serious face. Ive never noticed it before but since my fav theory is that Bran becomes the King, Ive been trying to find clues that point to that. And quite a lot of stuff points to it in S7, mostly in very minor or basic ways, especially their facial expressions. Which could be nonsense I know. Mostly cause the Night King barely has a face like but cmon... just look at the eyebrows.

Anyhoo, I swear theres some resemblance. Mostly just trying to reopen a discussion here while I start EP7. I also apologise for the bad formatting, posted on my phone.

Basically, as I was binging the show and I was somewhere around season 4, I had become so obsessed with the world George RR Martin had created that I constantly spent time reading articles, watching videos, etc about the lore, all while desperately trying to avoid spoilers for the episodes I had yet to watch. I was doing pretty well with avoiding spoilers, but my streak finally ended when I stumbled upon something that revealed that ""Lyanna Stark is Jon Snow's mom"". 

Initially I was overcome with frustration. I was pissed that I wouldn't get to have that revealed to me through the show/books. But then I paused and my mind was filled with confusion. 

See, even though I had just found out Lyanna was Jon's mom, I didn't really know much about Rhaegar at the time, and I was still under the impression that Ned was Jon's dad so this lead to me to believe that... Jon was the product of incest!?!?

For the longest time I believed that this would be the case and I constantly thought to myself how the FUCK will GRRM flex his story crafting muscles to justify this happening? I came up with two theories and ironically one of them wasn't too far off from what ended up being the truth. One was that Ned and Lyanna might have been captured by the Mad King and forced to have sex and make a baby as a form of torture and Ned was just too ashamed to admit that this happened. And the second was that Ned, similar to Rhaegar, saw some sort of prophetic vision that he had to have a baby with Lyanna and that baby would end up being very important. Obviously, Ned being the honorable man he was couldn't tell people this so he had to make up a different story.

I started to think that GRRM implemented the Jaime/Cersei incest as a way of foreshadowing this twist and getting the reader used to the idea of incest and in a weird way I though this would've been kind of genius.

In the end, after catching up and finding out about Jon's true parentage, I was relieved to find out Ned never engaged in incest with Lyanna, but I have to admit, I was a LITTLE disappointed because it would've been an absolutely shocking twist.",4,19,False,spoiler,,,,,

But what if it isn't?       
     
Multiple times Vargs are referred to as skinchangers, which kinda does make sense, but it also doesn't Vargs dont change their skin, they take control of others skin. As we know there are a lot of history in westeros that is either forgotten or changed through time, so what if the first Vargs actually had the ability to change their skins? hens the name skinchanger, they could do both control the mind of an animal, and change into an animal. Now this is pretty far fetched, seeing as how the only reference i can remember that might back this theory is the usage of the word skinchanger and the fact that Bran was told he would fly, which most likely means flying through time and all that, but i do like to think that Bran in Season 8 will turn himself into either a Raven/Crow or a Dragon.

This is obviously extremely out there and I'm just spit-balling an alternative theory.

Melissandre thought that Stannis was the re-incarnation of Azor Ahai, we then find out she mistook him for Jon Snow. But what if her visions were not 'wrong' just misinterpreted. Azor Ahai is the warrior of light who is directly opposed by the 'Great Other' who is the god of darkness, cold and death. Perhaps she misinterpreted Stannis as Azor Ahai but really, he is the Great Other. He could potentially be resurrected by the Night King as he makes his way down to Kings Landing, the road passes straight through Winterfell.


Melisandre did say that Stannis 'will sit on the Iron Throne', but first sacrifices must be made. Melisandre thought blood offerings and burning Shireen was what was required. What if the actual sacrifice is being killed and turning into a Wight. The sacrifice of turning your back on everything you believe in, duty, honour, your family, Westeros itself and becoming something you're fighting against to get the Iron Throne.

Obviously, this can be pretty easily debunked.. There is already a Night King, would seem a bit out of leftfield to bring Stannis back at this point and doesn't really seem fitting with the Night King's motivations.

This is obviously extremely out there and I'm just spit-balling an alternative theory.

Melissandre thought that Stannis was the re-incarnation of Azor Ahai, we then find out she mistook him for Jon Snow. But what if her visions were not 'wrong' just misinterpreted. Azor Ahai is the warrior of light who is directly opposed by the 'Great Other' who is the god of darkness, cold and death. Perhaps she misinterpreted Stannis as Azor Ahai but really, he is the Great Other. He could potentially be resurrected by the Night King as he makes his way down to Kings Landing, the road passes straight through Winterfell.

Melisandre did say that Stannis 'will sit on the Iron Throne', but first sacrifices must be made. Melisandre thought blood offerings and burning Shireen was what was required. What if the actual sacrifice is being killed and turning into a Wight. The sacrifice of turning your back on everything you believe in, duty, honour, your family, Westeros itself and becoming something you're fighting against to get the Iron Throne.

Obviously, this can be pretty easily debunked.. There is already a Night King, would seem a bit out of leftfield to bring Stannis back at this point and doesn't really seem fitting with the Night King's motivations.

On a side note, I'm sure it's been discussed at length, but for the show to not show Stannis being killed is unusual. I mean, as a theme it likes to show people's demise.

Considering all information we got from interviews and set photos, here is my theory.

Daenerys will be told the truth about Jon in episode 2, 3 or 4. The Winterfell battle happens in episode 3, and the aftermath continues in episode 4, so no time for big drama there.

Dany won't believe it as it is something pretty unbelievable, and the information originates from Brandon, Jon's brother, and Sam, his best friend. If Howland Reed truly plays a part in this, his voice will not be credible for her (his house holds fealty to House Stark of Winterfell).

She will get emotional and maybe a little paranoid, and will think of this as a conspiracy.

So, she will eventually get separated from the northern alliance.

The rest of the living will approach King's Landing and eventually somehow get inside (Cersei might let them in).

Dany will fly there and burn it.

She will win the Game of Thrones, and will accuse basically all the characters who aren't in her team of treason.

**The very last scene of the series is a close up to Dany opening her lips and we hear a subtle indication of her saying ""Dracarys"".**

Or, if there truly is some Brandon time traveling, she would say ""Burn them all"".

**Or it could be made in a way that we really do not know if it is her own will, or if she has been manipulated (Hodor style).**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

This story progress and climax would make me sad, but watching it would be very, very exciting.

This is obviously not some elaborated and thought-out theory, just my intuition talking.

* Episode MVP: Ghost. Like Ser Barristan, Ghost emerges at the last moment to save an important character. This time it was saving Sam from the wights. It's a reminder of how awesome the direwolves are and how disappointing it is that they've been largely absent in recent episodes.

I think Arya is going to die in season 8- but take down Wight Viserion with her. Arya has been a major character throughout the series, and she is undoubtedly going to go out in a badass way. Rewatch the scene when Bran gives her the valyrian steel dagger. Note how sad he looks; it's almost as if he knows what is going to happen with the dagger, but it is necessary that Arya has it. And then watch the most recent teaser, when Arya sees a dragon for the first time. She is the only person I can think of that doesn't look scared upon seeing one for the first time. That in itself isn't much and may just be a nod to Arya's personality in general, but I think that it has some sort of connection to my theory, and GoT loves to throw in little details like that. Now obviously a regular dagger would not even scratch a regular dragon, but I feel as if a valyrian steel dagger might do a bit more to a wight dragon. I think Arya is too major of a character to just die to a regular wight or regular white walker, and if the Night King is going to die, Jon will be the one killing him, so that leads me to believe she will take down Viserion and die in the process. She has a valyirian steel dagger for a reason, especially since Bran gave it specifically to her, so there is no doubt that she will be fighting the army of the dead with it. This is obviously just a theory and could very well be wrong, but hey what are theories for if you can't be far fetched and have fun with them?",61,36,False,spoiler,,,,,

In episode one, the characters will not 'win', but not exactly 'lose', the Battle of Winterfell.

In episode two, Cersei will solidify her control of the southern kingdoms. This will set Dany up with a choice, head south, aid resistance and become queen, or head north and end the threat of the Others for good. (a mirror of Cersei's choice last season). She will choose to go North and Jon, Jaime and others will go with her.

In the North, she will sacrifice herself to help stop the Night King (create Lightbringer?), and Jon will become the new NK to keep the Others out of Westeros.

Jaime then takes their child south (mirroring Jon being taken north), and raise it as a bastard, keeping its identity as the child of Targaryen royalty a secret (again, like Jon). This will also mirror Ned's decision, cementing Jaime's turn into a noble character. He will need to protect the child from the queen, his lover, who sees it as a threat to her reign. Just as Ned needed to keep Jon a secret from the king, his best friend Robert.",20,16,False,spoiler,,,,,

I'd like to see if anyone else comes to the same conclusions as me.

&amp;#x200B;

Bran accidentally brought back the White Walkers. As Old Nan told him the stories of the White Walkers (his favorite stories), he had dreams about them. But they weren't just dreams. He was inadvertently using his abilities to resurrect them. I think the Night King is controlled by a part of Bran's brain that he is unable to tap into, and the only way to kill the White Walkers will be for Bran to sacrifice himself.

&amp;#x200B;

Another interesting thing to note. When Bran is discussing the Red Comet with Osha in S1 Ep10, she tells him that the comet can mean only one thing: Dragons. Later on in that same episode (that very night perhaps), Dany's dragons are born.

***Spoiler Warning:*** *This post generally assumes are you caught up.*  


***Content Quality Warning:*** *I think this is probably going to be a hodgepodge of existing theories, but I wanted to get the thoughts down, and hopefully get some feedback. There might be something insightful here? Maybe? Should this be marked OC? I am not on Reddit much.*

# Defeating the Night King

My current ideas about how to defeat the Night King: 

* **Fire?** No. Well, maybe yes, if you could get him with it. His aura seems to prevent this, probably including dragon fire.
* **Dragonglass?** No. I think he is the exception, since in his case that is the very thing that is powering him.
* **Valarian Steel?** Probably not. It seems like a psuedo-extension of dragonglass and dragon fire. More importantly, the night king seems too special for this. I think, largely for storywriting reasons, he will have a more interesting method required.  

*What does that leave us?*

* **Dawn / Metal from a Fallen Star** \- Dawn is a weapon that is one-of-a-kind, just like the night king. According to the GoT wiki *""Dawn was forged from the metal of a 'fallen star'""*. It also is filled with symbolism and may fit into prophecies nicely. It seems there is a handful of shots at the Tower of Joy where the show goes out of its way to show us the profile of the blade, presumably so we would recognize it later.   For a while I thought that Beric Dondarrion had Dawn north of The Wall, but that now seems unlikely. Now somehow there would have to be some other way for the Night King and Dawn to be in the same place.
* **Replace him** \- In this thinking, the night king is a position that must exist for one reason or another. So, perhaps you can destroy him, usurp him or otherwise push him out of the picture by creating a new Night King.   
* ***Both*** \- Both of the above could be true at the same time.  Let's say that the Night King has the power to control the white walkers, and the white walkers control the wights. But what if when you kill the Night King, instead of freeing the White Walkers, it instead frees them to act as they please, becoming independent warlords commanding armies of undead?  That still can be the death of Westros. So, what if you use Dawn to kill the Night King, and then somebody sacrifices their well being to become the Night King themselves, take control of the White Walkers, and lead the army of the dead back beyond the wall?   Under this thinking, this has already happened. Perhaps the white walkers were made before the Night King to fight against the humans. Then the White Walkers time had come, and the Children of the Forest needed to control them. So, a man was sacrificed to control them and send them north of the wall. That man is the current Night King.  I would even like to point this out from the SoIaF wiki:   
*""House Dayne of Starfall are one of the most ancient houses in the Seven Kingdoms, claiming ancestry dating back ten thousand years to the dawn of days.""* So, it seems that if this scenario is actually a repeat of an earlier event (ie there was a yet older Night King that was also replaced), then the *""metal of a 'fallen star'""* was present then too. They could have also killed that Night King in the same basic way (even if it's not specifically Dawn).  

# Endgame Speculation Time

Last little thing I wanted to point out: Starfall exists among the Red Hills. *""When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers, Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone""* Could we see the new Night's King being created (reborn) at Starfall while it was under siege (Starfall in the Red Hills by the salty Summer Sea burns and bleeds), thus allowing him to animate the dead (including dragons, in their previous stone-like state)? Maybe the living get pushed all the way down south, including King's Landing, and for some reason (maybe part of this plan once they figure it out?) transport the bones of the dragons at King's Landing to Starfall? (To keep them out of the hands of the white king, and be used by the new Night King)  If the White Walkers got that far south, that would be a dreary and desperate situation indeed.

Instead he gets off the horse, puts Jon Snow on it, says there is no time, walks over a good distance and then just gets killed.

Weight could not have been an issue.  Earlier on the horse was carrying three people: Benjen, Bran, and Meera.  And even if so, why not just ride it for some time and then get off of it.  They both had plenty of time.  How cool would it have been to see Jon Snow and Benjen Stark have some nice long dialogue which seems to be missing in some of the season 7 episodes.

Mine is in season 6 is when Ramsay is already Lord of Winterfell. The scene where he acts so nice and then takes Fat Walda and his baby brother down to the kennels, slowly opens all the cages and Fat Walda pleads him to let her go, but he sends the dogs on her and the baby to die.

My wife and I just watched S4E2, and I'm convinced that this episode gives some of the most adamant foreshadowing I've seen yet. There are two distinct scenes that are almost dead giveaways to me:

1) Bran is warging into Summer for extended periods of time. When he is woken up by Jojen and Meera, they warn him that he should not stay warged into Summer for extended periods of time, as staying in another's body for too long may cause him to forget everything about who he is.

2) [Bran's vision](http://i.imgur.com/pHVfJrs.png). I've seen a lot of speculation about this particular part of his vision and trying to figure out who the second person is. But what I think people are missing is that this is clearly a reflection of the Night King - as in, Bran is seeing himself as the Night King (he just doesn't know it yet).

First part is epic and a big surprise of seeing Cersei uaing using wild fire to get her revenge.

&amp;#x200B;

The episode has about 6 points that the episode could have ended.

Arya getting revenge

Tyrion becoming hand of the queen.

John Snow's mom officially being revealed.

Jon being called King of the North.

Cersei becoming queen.

And the actual ending of Danny dinally sailing over.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Dany new alliance with the Greyjoy.

This just occurred tom me during the re-watch of season 3 and I'm freaking the fuck out.

So in season 3 episode 2, There's a scene between Tyrion and Shae. Tyrion tells Shae that people in King's landing are very dangerous. He repeats ""very dangerous people"" and the scene cuts and right away we see Margaery walking towards Joffrey's chamber.

&amp;#x200B;

Joffrey shows his crossbow to Margaery. Margaery puts her hand on the crossbow and tells him ""You are the king."" Joffrey says ""Yes I am"" while he is visibly excited and nervous. 

Joffrey asks her ""Do you like it? i just have it made. Finest weapon in the seven kingdoms""

Margaery: ""It's beautiful. Will you show me how it works?""

Joffrey shows him how the bow works. 

Joffrey"" Do you want to hold it?""

Margaery: ""May I? Please.""

Joffrey helps her hold the crossbow. Margaery: ""I imagine it must be so exciting to squeeze your finger here and watch something die over there.""

Joffrey again gets visibly excited Breathes heavily and looks at Margaery. ""Could you do it? Could you kill something?""

Margaery: ""I don't know your grace. Do you think I could?""

Joffrey"" ""Yes""

Margaery: ""Would you line to watch me?""

Joffrey looks at their reflection in the mirror and says ""Yes"".

And then in a few episodes Ros is killed with the same crossbow. The combination of Tyrion saying ""very dangerous people"" and the very next scene showing Margaery saying these led me to believe it could have been Margaery who killed Ros while Joffrey watched. What do you think?

Ok, so basically the faceless men are no one, blank characters, and they switch faces and take the personality, life stories, and appearance of that person. At the end of i believe season 6, she says my names arya stark and Im going home to winterfell when she leaves that house of black and white and Jaquan haqar smirks and nods, but its bc shes no one pretending to be someone (arya), kinda like how they were playing the game of faces where theyre different people with different stories, shes choosing to wear the face of Arya. And it explains a lot, like why she can still change faces like to Walder Frey etc without a cost like going blind. At first I was like why can she do that if she decided to leave and not be no one, but now it makes sense. Also it explains why shes so weird in that last season like moving around quietly and saying weird cryptic things. I remember watching season 7 and thinking when did arya get so weird a serial killer-y? If you think about it its pretty much how Jaquan Haqar and the waif acted, kinda weird walking around quietly saying obscure things. And it also explains why she kinda loves Sansa still and her family, bc shes playing the part of arya, but is also kinda distant and not as emotionally attached anymore.

I feel like that's a possibility depending of the success of the first spin-off (kind of like Discovery success has made CBS All Access order tons of Star Trek series, though to be fair, HBO doesn't have ONLY GoT) with At&amp;T pushing for it.

Jaime takes a step forward and says that after fighting with them he is aware of his sister's madness and that he will continue to help them until they end the threat of the dead.

9. Jon arrives at Kings Landing as a prisoner of the mountain and Cersei tells him that she will wait to have Daenerys as prisoner to kill both of them at the same time in the most cruel way possible.

10. Davos and Tyrion have a talk about the strategy of this mission as they go south.

20. Daenerys consoles Missandei for her loss, but then begins to have pains in the belly and Missandei realizes Daenerys is pregnant.

21. An old woman stands in the way of the northern armies asking for Jon, so they welcome her. But no one knows that is Melissandre in her true form.

22. Bran has visions of the Night King with his growing army in the south and discovers his past: Azor Ahai stabbed a sword to his wife Nissa Nissa to forge Lightbringer to kill the first Night King. Nissa Nissa became a White Walker, and was sent along with the rest to the Lands of Always Winter and the wall was created. After a few years, Azor Ahai joined the Night Watch and after a while became the 13th Lord Commander. He fought White Walkers until one day he discovered his wife, Nissa Nissa, who was now the Night's Queen. She also recognized him, and he was still so in love that he wanted to continue with her for all eternity. That's why he became Night King, and together they ruled the Wall for 13 years from one of Night Watch's biggest castles. Together they made constant sacrifices to the White Walkers to keep the peace treaty with the humans and prevent a new war between the two factions. But as Westeros society grew and the political interests between humans where each time more complicated, the kings of the north and south joined forces to banish Night King to Lands of Always Winter and kill his beloved wife. Since then he has been planning his revenge to end the humans who were responsible for the murder of his great love. His plan is to kill all of them and sit in the iron throne forever as the final revenge.",3,1,False,self,,,,,

While the deadline approaches I feel a growing fear the last few episodes are going to destroy everything good that what was built in years (remember How I Met Your Mother?).

However, while there is no ending of a series that makes everyone happy, there is *one thing* that could give David Benioff and HBO a place in the history of tv entertainment: **Make this a show about our planet, and kill everyone.**

*Allow me to clarify a bit, in GOT:*

* There is a huge catastrophe that can potentially annihilate the whole human kind.
* Everyone knows about it.
* And everyone knows it's coming.

*..And still, everyone thinks that:*

* It's fake news
* It's someone else fault
* Eventually something is going to take care of it

...and every kingdom keeps thinking about its army, debts, power, personal vengeance, legacy, old values that are dead or other brilliant things that are also very irrelevant for the big picture.

In the meantime, this huge catastrophe that seemed just like an old prophecy and a very theoretical worst case scenario becomes more and more plausible up to a point in which it actually really happens.

***Does this ring a bell?***

What about global climate? What about every nation waiting for others to take ownership and reduce their pollution, plastic, emissions and so forth? Maybe it's Summer -and not winter- that is coming (and a very hot one..) and we are the Lannisters, the Stark, Targaryen etc...

It's actually funny how the whole show is about a huge climate change (*yes..yes.. and sex, and violence, and more sex. we all love that part..*). R.R Martin didn't even need to stretch the imagination too much to find a meteorological event that could eliminate humankind. He just switched the season.

The best way to end the show would be to make the white walkers eliminate all the houses one-by-one, until whoever remains alive decides that the only way to deal with this apocalyptic threat is to stick together and fight for each other.

This is one of the plausible endings of the last season of GOT, in which the humanity (or what remains of it...) decides to fight together and dragons, wolves manage to fight a last epic battle with epic special effects, violence, sex, explosions, more violence, more dragons, more special effects and that the enemy is defeated and everyone is happy again!

***Except that it should not be like this..***

I want a last season in which the villain wins (is it a real villain tho? Compared to what?), in which all the humanity sticks together to fight the last epic battle but guess what? It's too late anyway. They (us) had all the time in the world to do something about it.

All the signs to see this winter coming were there and something should have done looooong time ago. The effort now is just a useless try which can only lead to failure.

This kind of ending in which the world is covered in ice and the whole humanity is destroyed would really be something new and fresh (in all senses..) in the history of entertainment. Plus, nature doesn't care about emotions and this can fit very well in the cynical narration of the whole series.

**HBO, R.R. Martin, David Benioff please, please, please don't give us the usual overdose of special effects, moral and good ending.**

**kill us all.**

Use entertainment to remind everyone that we don't have much time left (*winter is coming in 12 years, according to scientists..)* to take ownership and take care of the big picture.

Every one of them. Its a requisite. 

Apologies if Im missing any details or regurgitating ideas (Im fairly new to GoT lore)

But it seems the best explanation to me for the white walker/wight discrepancy in numbers is that all of them need to have Stark blood. 

This would explain the Night Kings focus on Bran and Jon. It would also mean that Craster is a Stark bastard (explains why he particularly was able to arrange his setup) Baby Sam would then be a Stark and his role in the final season may be larger than anticipated. 

It would also explain why Benjens traveling mates became wights but Benjen seemed to be halted mid-transformation into a walker (Children of the Forest deus ex dragon glass)

The implications of this and the other posts suggesting a trip to Winterfell and its origins closely tied to the walkers (recent alt-shift-x video) would be really exciting.

This is a bit tinfoil but remember all the skeletons in the three eyed ravens cave? What if they were sacrifices that somehow fuel the weirwood trees' ability to give bran power. The red god also demands sacrifice, sacrifice to power something surely, AND is opposed to the white walkers like bran's crew. The many faced god also demands sacrifices but for what? It must go towards a power that is more than just ""getting new faces for assassins."" 

With a grain of salt, it can be assumed that bran's crew, red god, many faced god all demand sacrifices to power the same thing 


There are other connections between these three factions. Red priests can change appearance like worshippers of the many faces god. There are many weirwood faces (similar to the many faced god? What if the many faced god is the one that commands these faces, in this case it would be bran. Maybe it's not bran himself that makes him so powerful, its power through sacrifice.

I was wondering, how literally can we take this line of Benjen's?

The Night King seemed to be interested in consolidating his position and increasing his strength of wights (though I don't think he really needed more), and did not seem to be making an actual attempt on the wall till he had a means to do so (Viserion). The wall stopping the dead would prevent it.

But a wight was brought back to Castle Black in S1 where it attacked Mormont. Also, a wight was taken all the way to King's Landing, so dead (wights) did cross the wall.

Does this mean that a dead can cross the wall if carried by a living agency? So, could a large bird carry a wight over the wall?",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Ive posted similar replies to individual comments in the past, but wanted to reach a wider audience. 

I want to begin by saying that Im fully open to opinions contrary to mine, and I am doing this as a means to help get a better understanding for not only myself, but for others still hung up on those Season 7 shortcomings.

The following is my attempt to fill those plot holes with feasible excuses, as a means to better enjoy and understand the endgame. *Please* correct me if I miss something or misinterpret anything.

**The ill-fated mission to kidnap a zombie:**

In season 7, Jon and some homies head up north with the idea theyre gonna snag a zombie and bounce back to The Wall. This little group of idiots with a death wish is reminiscent of Azor Ahai/The Prince That Was Promised stories where the hero goes North, but his friends are killed and he is saved by the Children of the Forest. 

In *our* version, the heroes get a zombie, who then alerts his masters to whats going on. This leads to Jon sending Gendry back to The Wall, while the rest hightail it onto an island in the middle of a partially frozen lake. This leads to some issues in continuity and feasibility, because this part of the story happens so quickly, where in previous seasons it would have likely been drawn out over the course of an extra episode. 

As a result, I often find the following complaints:

- Why does the NK not just kill Jon and company?
- Why does Dany not just blast the NK?
- How does Gendry run to The Wall so quick?
- How does Dany get to Jon so quick?
- What purpose does this serve other than to please fans?

Before I jump into this, I want to talk about the NK.

As of right now, GRRM treats the NK like Tolkien treated Sauron through the first book and a half: hes a peripheral figure that is shrouded in mystery, lore, and half-true stories. Like Tolkien, GRRM makes it clear that the NK poses some sort of threat, but that threat is constantly overshadowed by petty human drama. As a result, Sauron/the NK are able to regain their strength and a full army in relative peace. It isnt until recently that we even see much of the NK, and as a result we dont even know the following:

- What is the NK *fully* capable of?
- What are his *actual* desires/end goal?
- What sort of power is feeding him, and what makes him weak?

What we *do* know about him:

- He has abilities very similar to Bran/The Three-eyed Raven. Additionally, he can see Brans projection and physically interact with him even while hes worging. 
- He was most likely one of the First Men, and was created by shoving dragon glass into his heart. 
- The NK is old as fuck. Like, *way* older than Targs and such. 
- He can create his own snowstorms, and basically control the localized weather in general.

That said, lets jump into this:

**My theory on what happened up north with Jon and his gang:**

The Wall is the key to the south. Whatever we may not know about the NK, we *do* know he wants to get past The Wall. 

The Wall is made using magic to keep the dead out. Simply breaking in through brute force would never work. The Wall itself needs to come down. 

As such, the most realistic way to do that is melting it down. Given that it is insanely thick ice, with magic coursing through it, it would need an insanely high powerful key to bring it down. 

Enter: Dany and her dragons.

The NK knows hes not getting through The Wall without a dragon. Its also safe to say that he knows about Jon, Bran, and Dany. As I mentioned earlier, we know for a fact that he has the ability to see like Bran, meaning hed be fully aware that there are dragons in the world again. Something hes been waiting a very long time for.

In addition to the dragons, he also almost certainly knows that Jon is coming north. Its also feasible to say he knows that Dany and Jon are working together.

Because of this, we can answer one of the plot holes:

&gt; Why does the NK not just kill Jon and company?

Because leaving them alive gives him the best opportunity to get a dragon. Whether through some unknown ability to see into the near future, or simply through the typical warging, Id argue he knows one of Jons companions is headed south to warn Dany, meaning hell have an opportunity to kill a dragon. 

However, if he kills Jon and all of Danys friends, then there is no chance shes staying around long enough for him to line up a kill shot. Keeping them alive is just him using bait to get her in closer. 

This is further evidenced by the reaction of the zombies when they start to crack the ice. Instead of carrying on, they simply stop. It isnt until its frozen over that they start to advance again. This suggests maybe the zombies are adverse to water, or cant function in it. 

However, we not only see them attacking the group from beneath the ice (remember they tried to pull Tormund in), but we also see that they were able to swim down, chain up Viserion, and then pull him out. Clearly, water isnt an issue. 

This shows that the NK was intentionally keeping them from overtaking the group. This can only suggest that he was intentionally biding his time, especially since he himself could have just hurled a spear at each member of the group if he simply wanted him dead. *Clearly*, there is something else going through the NKs mind. 

Furthermore, we can analyze how the group are able to fight off the encroaching horde with *relative* ease. Had the NK simply wanted them dead, the horde could have no doubt simply overwhelmed them with extreme ease. Why wouldnt he instruct them to do so? This is just another action (or inaction, perhaps) that leads you to assume there is a different motive for the NK here. 

My theory is that the NK sends just enough to keep the gang occupied, and forces Dany to address the immediate threat of her friends stuck on that island. This distracts Dany, keeping her from seeing that the NK is lining up a shot on Viserion. Had she been aware, she could have reacted, heavily impacting the chance the NK gets what he desperately desires: a way to bring down The Wall. 

Additionally, another aspect to consider is what would have happened had Dany flown in and saw that Jon and her friends were dead: she would have flown off, gathered her full army and her *three* dragons, and met the NK at The Wall. The NK would have been thoroughly defeated in this scenario. 

This also partially answers the following plot hole: 

&gt; Why does Dany not just blast the NK?

Because she was so distracted by rescuing her friends, and Viserion dying was such a dramatic blow, that her reaction time left room for the NK to re-up on his javelin and start advancing towards her and Drogon. By that point, retreat was the only feasible option. Theres no way shed risk her other dragons while hes out here hurling magic ice spears at 800 mph. 

So, Id like to recap before jumping to the next couple points. 

- The NK needs to get past The Wall. 
- Brute force wont work because of magic in The Wall, and the sheer size of it. 
- Like Bran, the NK has some degree of telepathic abilities. We dont know how extensive, but we can reasonably assume he is fully aware of the going-ons of Jon, Dany, and the rest of the world. 
- Because of said abilities, he knows that the key to destroying The Wall is in the dragons, and that he can lure them up there by simply trapping Jon and waiting until Dany shows up. 
- He strategically uses his zombies to distract Dany and Jon while he kills a dragon. 
- Dany is awestruck, and as such cannot retaliate in this instance without risking losing her dragons *and* her life. 

That said, lets jump into the more controversial issues:

&gt; How does Gendry run to The Wall so quickly?

So, Id like to start by saying that *this* is one of those parts of the story that feels rushed, and as a result gives a skewed perception of time. As such, my theory on this, and the remaining talking points I highlighted at the beginning, is based around what can be directly observed through this episode, as well as previous episodes and material from the books. 

So, lets start with our Olympic sprinter:

In my opinion, Jon and company are not very far from The Wall when they encounter the zombies. I say this for a few reasons:

- They leave Eastwatch in the wee morning hours, with a wagon/sled full of gear.
- We never see them setup camp, and there is never a time where theyre in a scene that suggests that nightfall is near. 
- The only time we see low-light conditions is when theyre attacked by the bears in the middle of a blizzard. 
- Shortly after that is when we see them find the scouting zombies, and its still very well lit outside. 
- When they catch the zombie and send Gendry off, its still quite light outside. 

You may wonder why Im putting an emphasis on the lighting. Its because were *supposedly* in winter, where light hours would be shorter. 

If we assume that this is true, then that means theyve been walking for less than a day, and with a full sled of gear. And if that is correct, then the distance theyve travelled isnt very far at all, as the slow trudge through deep snow with full gear would have undoubtedly slowed them down considerably. 

Now, this next part is going to be a harder pill to swallow, because it does make some leaps in logic. 

During the previous seasons, we hear Roose tell Ramsay how isolated Winterfell is. He mentions how, from Winterfell, The Wall is somewhere around 300 miles away. It might be more, I honestly cant remember the exact amount he said, but it was definitely in the hundreds of miles. Anyway..

If we assume that the maps provided to us are to scale, we can see that Eastwatch is particularly close to Hardhome, which is the initial destination that Jon takes his group when doing this mission. However, they dont actually make it that far, suggesting the distance theyve travelled is perhaps in the range of 20-30 miles, based off what Roose says, and using the maps to adjust and guesstimate their actual distance.

As I mentioned earlier, observations that help solidify this conclusion is that they never setup camp, and the light levels never suggest they walked through the night. The fully supplied sled also helps explain their slow pace. 

That said, I think we can reasonably say that a human being that is hopped up on adrenaline from just recently coming into contact with a zombie, has no equipment to weigh them down, and is likely to make a more direct route back, can cover 20-30 miles in the span of 2-3 hours, which is a time frame that fits the observations Ive made in regards to light. 

That is to say, it was clearly still daytime when a Gendry left, and it is clearly nightfall when he finally arrives, fully gassed and nearly dead from that long run back. At which point they immediately send a raven to Dany on Dragonstone. 

And that brings me to the next issue:

&gt; How does Dany get to Jon so quick?

Honestly, this is the hardest one to explain. My opinion is that the major issues with this can be boiled down to two points:

- Flying is an insanely quicker form of transportation than ground travel. Particularly if youre just blasting towards your destination as quick as possible.
- The episode, and this particular part of the episode, was condensed considerably, and it didnt do a good job of showing how much time had passed. 

As per my observations that Ive mentioned so many times now, we see theres almost two full days that go by before Dany ever shows up. To imagine she was able to fly from Dragonstone to Jon in a timeframe of 5-6 hours (she leaves in the morning, gets there shortly before dusk), is not entirely inconceivable. Particularly since we dont know the flight speed of a dragon. Still, this is a big plot hole that is hard to reconcile. 


**In conclusion:**

Thank you for anyone bored enough to have actually read this. 

Please note that there are still issues that are simply inexplicable (how did a raven get from Eastwatch to Dragonstone so quickly?). There are also issues with the overall writing of this episode that Im not here to argue. 

I mostly wanted to open up dialogue about the NK and his intentions, and since this episode was the single most NK-centric episode, it seemed best to observe the actions he makes during it. 

Sadly, the writing leaves plot holes to be addressed, and without addressing them its hard to discuss the true nature of the NK and what this episode was trying to convey to us.

To recap, my theory is that this episode showed us that the NK has been playing men like pawns. Often I find that people dismiss this episode and its events because theyre too focused on these plot holes. The irony in that is that the NK has been letting humans fight over petty things, while ignoring his very real threat, just as a lot of viewers brush this episode off as if it never existed because of said plot holes, and as a result weve missed some important information about what is arguably the main villain in this series. 

Hopefully this can open up some dialogue on where the NK goes from here, and what his intentions actually are, rather than discussing the short comings of an increasingly time-strapped writing team that is basically being asked to finish something that GRRM hasnt been able to do in decades.

&amp;#x200B;

I am new to this subreddit! I have not read any of the novels yet but I recently binged the show last year. I will be honest and say that I am not normally a fantasy fan and I put off watching this for a while because it didn't seem like something I would be interested in. However, I am a massive history fan and when someone mentioned to me it drew on real history I decided to give it a go. Needless to say I was hooked immediately, its beyond amazing and now I am an uber fan (will give the books a try as well, I am sure they are perfect).   


When binging the series there were some characters who obviously stood out as being inspired by certain people of history. Once I finished watching I started to google or search for threads/articles highlighting the comparisons (I held off because I didn't want to be spoiled while watching the series). 

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, I have not been able to find anyone comparing Jon Snow to Richard III (King of England). I've found comparisons of Richard III to Stanis, Bran, Rickon, Tyrion...etc...all of which I also noted when watching the show, the similarities are pretty obvious. I really need to discuss this with someone so I have come here, apologies if this has already been discussed. In my opinion Jon Snow has many, many comparisons with Richard and it would be interesting to hear other people's takes on this.

the evidence started stacking when melissandre burned the leeches full of gendrys blood to curse Robb stark, who later dies that episode in the red wedding, Joffery Lannister, who gets poisoned by grandma tyrell, just after melisandre makes the fire sacrifice praying for success or sumshit. and baylon greyjoy who gets murdered by his brother who COMES OUT OF THE SEA FROM NOWHERE and somewhat (or i think maybe he gets converted to) believing in the lord of light idk i havent gotten there yet.
p.s.
i just got to the episode where Tyrion is in the ciry with varys and a red priestess said people of greyscale look to the lord of light and tyrion said no god can do that its stupid to pray or whatever.

This is also the only way that Cersei will help.  To have winter knocking on kings landings door.

Okay, so Jaime is involved in a near death scene in the North and we're left wondering if he survived or not. In the next episode however we're relieved to see that he's okay, but his experience has shaken him to the core and all he wants is to be with Cersei as the NK is ravaging his way through the North. All will end soon, so he just wants to be with his love. 

He arrives back in KL and Cersei is happy to see him. They embrace, when suddenly Jaime stabs her and shoves her out the window from which Tommen jumped to his death, somewhat mirroring what he did to Bran so long ago. It's a real shocker, even moreso when we see Jaime suddenly rip his own face off, revealing himself to actually be Arya. Jaime really did die in the North and Arya saw her opportunity to kill Cersei and took it. 

In walks Zombie Mountain having heard screams. He's going to kill Arya for what she's done to his master, when suddenly, there he is, Syrio Forel out of nowhere. He saves Arya, but realizes that a conventional method of killing is insufficient for this absolute Unit of a zombie. He manages to stun him however, long enough to help Arya escape out into the main City. 

He explains to Arya that he didn't die at the hands of Ser Meryn that day, but was badly wounded and managed to hide and nurse himself slowly back to health. He's been searching for Arya ever since and heard from those Lannister soldiers (Ed Sheeran) that a young woman matching Arya's description was on her way to KL, so he waited and finally found her.

It's very heartwarming. We're all feeling pretty good about this, when suddenly Syrio stabs Arya in the gut. Stunned, she falls to the ground and begins to bleed out, asking why, when Syrio turns away, grabs at the area of one of his ears, rips his face off and turns back to reveal himself to be none other than Jaqen H'ghar. A girl has been violating the rules of the Many Faced God, and her death is owed. Syrio really has been dead the whole time. End of episode.

...that being said. The more I research and look into this, the more I see it as an Episode 3 insult where Anakin is begrudgingly allowed to sit on a council of Jedi Masters... but is NOT awarded that rank.

Why was the Hound never knighted? As I look through Kingsguard groups Id say 99 percent of them are knights. Yet what about the other few... or not so much what as WHY?

If I was tasked with putting up with Joffree on a daily basis, youd have better knighted me. The Hound probably had to deal with more shit from him than anything the Mountain has to deal with with Tywin. Tywin might have been just as cruel, but he wasnt a dick about it and he had an eloquent was of being cruel.

Then Brienne of Tarth... in a Kingsguard where EVERYONE is a knight, sworn to protect the King off the throne, and she wasnt knighted? This one doesnt bother me as much since shes a women, so if nothing else, I can just assume thats the reason.

But having Bronn get knighted after Stannis landing... I mean aside from the arrow he didnt do that much more than say other people do. And who can Knight? Does it have to be a king or can it be anyone who holds a lordship in the kingdom?

The other thing that makes this so murky is in the beginning we hear Eddard Stark proclaiming to strip Ser Gregor of his title, yet everyone else whos been exiled or otherwise shamed gets to keep their Knighthood? Jorah gets kicked out of an entire kingdom and yet is still referred to by everyone as ser

Is there a reason people are actively not knighted? Podrick will likely get his Knighthood before the end of this all if he lives to see it, yet theres more than a handful along with the hound who seem to deserve the title more and more.

TLDR: Why would someone appoint a Kingsguard or Queensguard and not knight them? Is there an actual reason, or just because they dont feel like it and want to play a cruel joke on someone they feel shouldnt receive it yet trust them to guard their life?

Sorry, but if Im appointing a Queensguard Im only appointing anointed Knights, and if I want someone so brave, strong, heroic, or whatever else to be in my Queensguard and their not a knight? Then I should damn well better knight them to reflect all those deeds and things theyve done to prove that to me.",8,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

Many characters from very different regions have been interacting more in recent seasons, and communication seems like a completely unnoticed plot hole. How does Tormund, a wildling born and raised north of the wall, speak to others, say Ser Davos (a commoner from Flea Bottom) with little to no confusion. Lets say that people in the north and the free folk north of the wall both speak the common tongue (unlikely, but lets roll with it). The dialects of the two cultures would be so peculiar to the other that I have a hard time buying that they could communicate at all. I could see Mance (born and raised north of the wall) speaking to Jon Snow among others, but it just seems impossible that nothing is lost in communication between Jon &amp; Tormund. It seems unlikely theyd be able to have a conversation at all. Rant over... for now. ",1,1,False,self,,,,,
