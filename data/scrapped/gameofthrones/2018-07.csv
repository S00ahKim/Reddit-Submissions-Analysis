Character Development,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8v8v12/spoilers_fanservice_vs_character_development/,metsuri,1530437693,"I rewatched the entire series and I still can't come to enjoy Season 7 as much as 1 through 6. There are so many oxymorons, mistakes, and rushed timelines that it feels like 1 more season will simply create more inconsistencies and rushed conclusions. The mistakes have been appearing ever since the first wight appearance.

- Arya was told that if she was no one then the water would cure her blindness yet she went full U-turn and violated the rules again meaning she wasn't no one and the water should have killed her. She was also still in training and nowhere near finished yet she is suddenly a master assassin fighting top tier fighters to a stalemate and creating her own magic faces when she was nothing more than an apprentice that barely advanced beyond simply cleaning... I don't buy the master assassin and top tier fighting abilities. She was much more interesting up through disembarking with the Hound after the fight. The whole road trip with the Hound was excellent as we got to see her character evolve with great detail

- How did a wight get passed the wall not only when the watch brought them in but also when they captured one and brought it to King's Landing... The wall wasn't destroyed yet so how can they cross?

- The show has a human villain problem. It's hard to beat Joffrey, Ramsay, and Little Finger. Cersei has her moments but Euron just tries a little too hard and it made no sense that he soloed the Sand Snakes in less than 30 seconds while both Bronn and Jamie had issues together... I wrote it off as simply being because of darkness, being on a boat with Euron's homefield advantage, and not being used to cramped close quarters combat

- Everyone acts like Sansa is some great leader? She literally got thousands of people killed because she didn't speak up that she sent a summons to her uncle and the Knights of the Vale... Aka she is directly responsible for bringing the Wildlings even closer to extinction... I also think her writing got altered due to political issues regarding scenes like her rape. Over 10x more men die than women and Theon was on the receiving end of long term torture, brain washing, rape, and permanent mutilation yet people were only upset because of a 30 second clothed rape scene...

- Little Finger is Ying as Lord Varys is to Yang. He deserved much more than *we have a convenient past/present seer* followed by a rather anti-climatic plot death. In fact, the entire conspiracy between Arya, Sansa, and Little Finger was one of the worst subplots in the entire season... Arya's new personality doesn't match her personality when escaping the Waif and the Hall of Faces... I still have hopes that it isn't Arya but either the Waif or Jaqen H'ghar using her face. If not that, then I hope she has a decent but tragic subplot that ends with Jaqen H'ghar killing her for violating the rules a second time after being warned

- Daenerys went from being a breaker of chains that liberated many groups of people and gave them a choice to leave free for which they willfully chose to follow her to demanding fealty or death and leaning more toward anti-hero than hero. It is almost as annoying as the subplot in earlier seasons where she was afraid of her own dragons...

- Sam... He ventures off to train in the ways of a Maester to help Jon find a way to fight the White Walkers and in a skyscraper sized library he conveniently finds a mountain of dragon glass and his girlfriend conveniently finds a book mentioning Jon's parentage... I still have my fingers crossed that his dream to become a ""wizard"" will come to fruition in some form. We know magic exists with the necromancer, fire priests, faceless men, the White Walkers, Wargs, Greenseers, the Three-Eyed Raven, Mirri the witch with Dany, Maggy the witch with Cersei, and warlocks, so hopefully Sam discovers something lost or forbidden similar to the stone skin forbidden research. At least that would help me forget the WAY TOO CONVENIENT mountain of dragon glass...

- Time... So Gendry can sprint all the way back to the Night's Watch, Ravens can travel to the opposite side of Westeros, and Daenerys can then fly all the way back across Westeros for which only a single night passes... bullshit. If Arya and the Hound instantly arrived at Lysa's and the fight with Brienne, then we would have missed the entire heroes journey of Arya and the anti-hero character development of the Hound along with the paternal/uncle/mentor relationship between them that led to her removing him from her list of names

- Fan-service... Part of what makes Game of Thrones so good is the wonderful character development, shocking subplots where almost nobody is safe, and often the villains win. I feel like they are going to go full fan-service and barbarically kill hated characters, ensure the Cleganebowl (which I honestly want too lol but I prefer good storytelling over fan-service), and just kill needlessly without proper pacing to give it the same effect as things like Robert's hunting accident, Ned's beheading, the red wedding, the purple wedding, and/or Lord Commander Mormont's betrayal death

- Politics... Don't let fear of SJWs and political correctness hordes dictate any aspects of the writing and development. If this turns into some sort of Gladiator *give Rome back to the people* nonsense, killing off all the men making way for the Queens of the North, South, East, and West, and/or turning Sansa into the world's top war strategist + Arya into a rival for the Sword of the Morning along with more loss of character development and nonsensical time skips and flaws in the plot, then the last season is going to suck

Simply put, if they can not have a coherent plot with proper development, then this should never have been the final season. It's bad enough that we lost characters like Marjorie simply because they wanted to leave the show... I just hope that the final season does not feel as rushed. I have high hopes since episodes are rumored to be feature length meaning the combined total may be longer than a normal 10 episode season.",0,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I've been thinking of some titles that the episodes of season 8 could be. Most of the titles from previous episodes have been names that are referenced in both the books and the show, which i have tried to think about as well.

The battle between the living and the dead will either be episode 3 or 5, as it is directed by Miguel Sapochnik. A clever title for this episode could be ""**The King in the North""** referring to the battle to become King in the North between Jon Snow and the Night King. Other names could be **""The Battle for the Dawn""**, like during the first Long Night, or simply **""The Living and the Dead""**.

I think it would also be interesting to see if they went back and named some of the episodes after the books, like S5E9 (A Dance with Dragons) and S6E10 (The Winds of Winter). They probably won't name one of the episodes ""A Game of Thrones"", but it would be fun to see ""A Clash of Kings"", ""A Storm of Swords"" and ""A Feast for Crows"". I would be surprised if the final episode of Game of Thrones was not titles **""A Dream of Spring""**.

Furthermore, whichever episode Jons's true parentage is revealed to him, it could possibly be called **""The Rightful Heir""**, referring to Jon and Dany's claim on the throne. This could one of the earlier episodes (1 or 2).

Some episodes are name after the words of different houses like S1E1 (""Winter is Coming""), S1E10 (""Fire and Blood"") and S5E6 (""Unbowed Unbent Unbroken""). I am surprised that the words of House Lannister haven't been a title, so **""Hear me Roar""** could be another potential title.

A large part of the series has been focused of finding Azor Ahai reborn and we will find out who this is in season 8, so in the episode where we do find out, it could possibly be called **""The Prince who was Promised""** or **""Lightbringer"".**

It is likely that Cersei will die in season 8 and in the books, her death is foreshadowed by Maggy the Frog, so another episode could be called **""The Valonqar""**.

Most of, if not all, of these will be incorrect, but it is just my opinions.",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

One I would love to see would be about Roberts rebellion as you dont get to hear too much detail about it in the series where Ned dies so quickly. I can imagine the things him and Robert had to do would be pretty interesting, ooh and also this epic battle to stop the Greyjoy rebellion!

What other ones do you think would be interesting to see?

2) Bran somehow turns out to be the Night King.  

3). Sansa broods atop the Winterfell wall and nothing else.

4)  Arya keeps killing people, stealing their faces and uses them to kill more people

5) Cersei has the baby.

6). Brienne dies a virgin (this poor woman deserves some sex!)

7) Tyrion ends up woman-less and alone

8) Jaime dies in the arms of the woman he loves.  (This was just foreshadowed to death ... extra vomit if its Cerseis arms)

So a couple months ago I've uploaded some illustrations of the various, more fantastical creatures in the series in a field guide bestiary type thing; http://www.kevincatalan.com/#/beasts-of-ice-and-fire/ It's mainly been a personal project for myself and in honor of one of my favorite series. And maybe to one day be picked up by a publisher for an official book or something ;)

But after doing more and more research I found out there are a lot of really cool and barely mention critters that I would love to take a jab at but wanted to also get suggestions from the community on possible directions to take designs in. For example, the various ape species described from Essos and Sothoryos; what kind of ideas do you guys have about what they could look like or behave for me to illustrate? I'd love to discuss ideas cause I'm sure there are people out there that know a lot more than me and I really wanna do Martin's creatures justice. And of course I'll share my illustrations as I make them!

Hope this post is alright to post here and I just wanted a place to discuss the fauna of this world. Any other resources would be greatly appreciated! (and yeah I have the World of Ice and Fire book. it's been my biggest inspiration.)",3,14,False,self,,,,,

You could even throw in Gendry who disappeared for years at sea only to pop up again in Kings Landing.

The reasoning we are given is that Tyrion/ later Jon believe that burning Kings landing would kill thousands, but this logic is a strawman argument and I'd like to share my opinion on why, even if it's probably already been discussed to death.

First, let's address the idea that Dany would be murdering thousands of innocent small folk if she flew right to kings landing. This is a flat out lie, and Tyrion knows it. For anyone that's drawing a blank on the layout of the city I implore you to do a Google search. Cersei does NOT live in kings landing, she lives in the separate castle Maegor's Holdfast. This means that if Dany did have to burn Cersei's castle to the ground, she'd only be burning Cersei and her loyal Lord's, plus the men that are paid to be there and some slaves (the only innocent party involved).

Then there's the fact that to avoid attacking kings landing Dany and Tyrion instead decide to try a blockade and starve them out. This strategy in itself will kill mainly small folk. And that's ignoring the fact that it gave Cersei/ Jaime time to respond and start yet another war. Resulting in thousands of lives lost on both sides in the following battles of Highgarden and Casterly rock.

In conclusion, the more time that passes, the more I despise the way that Dany/ Tyrion handle her invasion of Westeros. It seems like way more people died in season 7 than could have ever been possible by simply attacking Cersei directly. Imho, Tyrion seems far more concerned with saving the family that sentenced him to death than he is helping Dany get what she wants, or saving the small folk from yet another war.

What do you think? If I'm missing something then by all means, please help me understand their thought process. Jon disagreeing with attacking Kings landing I can see, as Starks are infamous for not thinking 2/3 steps ahead, but Tyrion is supposed to be one of the best tactical minds in Westeros. But for me, he hasn't shown it since like season 4.",61,30,False,spoiler,,,,,

Of corse theres always the possibility some magic was drawing him toward the kid but it would explain why so many of the trees were getting cut down. 

Although that would raise the question ...

Are the children of the forest really on humanities side ? 

They are deeply connected to the trees and were in a huge war with the first men and were getting slaughtered. Why would all that change ? Just to fight a common threat that they created ? 

I think theres a solid possibility that the CotF are still controlling the WW yo destroy humanity and thats one final twist.

The video at the time explained the set up of Season 1 rather well. Breaking down the families I recall he points out your favorite character from each one. Starks: Arya because she kills a lot of people. Lannisters: Tyrion, because he's played by Peter Dinklage, ""the sexiest little person in the history of popular culture."" and The Targaryen's, ""Daenerys because she's the only one left. *OR IS SHE?!*""

287,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-7-5,2018,7,5,16,8w8pry,self.gameofthrones,[SPOILERS]Best spinoff series ever? Corlys Velaryon's voyages to Essos and The Further East.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8w8pry/spoilersbest_spinoff_series_ever_corlys_velaryons/,a7medy300,1530777462,"To me, Corlys Velaryon's trips to Essos and the Further east is a very interesting topic, exploring many mystical places, and encountering many different races, he explored both the Jade Sea and the Shivering Sea, he brought many fortunes back home and was for a time the wealthiest man in Westeros, with his wealth he built his house a new seat; High Tide, which is located in the small island Driftmark near the Crownlands, he also played a big part in one of the most important events in Asoiaf, The Dance of Dragons, which lasted over 3 years.

Since there is close to no information about his travels, the only thing we do know for certain are the places he visited and the number of voyages in total; 9. And that's about it, so the only thing we could do is make speculations and assumptions about his voyages through his ship Sea Snake, which was later his nickname or alias, there was also a book written about him and his 9 voyages by Maester Mathis, unfortunately there is no information about the book too.

His first voyage would probably be to the north, where he sailed beyond the wall, into the Lands of Forever Winter, he tried to sail around to the other side, but was unsuccessful because of the frozen water of which would probably be the north pole of the world of Asoiaf, there is a small chance that he would've brought fishers and fishing equipment, since the Shivering sea is filled with expensive exotic sea creatures, such as wolf fish, sand lances, grey skates, whitefish, shark, herring, mackerel, seals, narwhals, walruses, sea lions, grey whales, white whales, humpbacks, spotted whales, and leviathans. Since sea travel is expensive, he would either already have enough gold to leave for his other voyages (either from his savings, or a loan from a major house or even the iron bank), or he would've gotten the wealth on this voyage(shipping, treasure, loot, etc), like I said, these are all assumptions, for all we know, GRRM may even write the history of Corlys Velaryon and all of what I wrote would be wrong, but that's also just an assumption since he's already 70 years old and there's way more unwritten history and lore that is missing or vague, and the chances of him confirming anything on Corlys are close to none.

**Corlys Velaryon's voyages to the North of Essos.**

So we know that he went on 9 voyages in total (not including his voyage beyond the wall). From my opinion, I think that Corlys wanted to sail to all the corners of the known world, starting with the north, then to the upper east (The Shivering Sea). We also know that he was the first person to visit Nefer and N'Ghai, and even navigate through The Thousand Islands (which are all located on the far east of northern Essos). Since we also know that his daughter was betrothed to a Sealord of Braavos, this may indicate that he sailed to the north again, this time east, and to Braavos, and who knows how many placed he stopped by on his voyages, since we also know that when he reached The Thousand Islands, he stopped his voyage and went back home, he may have stopped to restock on many places; including Braavos, Lorath, The Axe, Saath, Morosh, Bay of Tusks, Ib, Far Ib, New Ibbish and even Vaes Aresak, which are all port cities that all have their different histories and cultures, Ib for example, is a small set of islands larger than the Iron Islands in Westeros, that are particularity very interesting. Their inhabitants, are a Dwarf like race that look very similar to the ones in the Lord of The Rings, they are very much shorter than all the other races, and are very much into mining and the creation of weapons and armor made of iron or other metals, the only difference is that they are great fishers and not that much into the creation and building of stone structures. They have tried to create settlements outside of their homeland Ib, but all efforts into inhabiting the main land were stopped by the savage Dothraki who slayed them all, the only small settlement remaining is New Ibbish.

The Thousand Islands are ever far more interesting, with their inhabitants being the most shrouded and most mysterious of all the races (in my opinion), despite their name, sailors have only counted lesser than three hundred islands. The inhabitants are reportedly xenophobes, hairless green skinned beings who speak an unknown language and are also said to sacrifice any sailors they find to their evil fish-gods, it is also said that their gods can be visible underwater in a low tide, and many sailors say that The Thousand Islands are the remainder of an ancient sunken civilization that has been submerged underwater from the rising sea level, it is even said that the inhabitant are so scared of the water that they will never enter it even when threatened by death. Since you have to pass through The Thousand Islands to reach Nefer and N'Ghai, we can say that his voyage to The Thousand Islands counts as one.

It is said the the more east you go, the more mysterious it becomes, with lesser and lesser people travelling this far and going back to Westeros and document their voyages and adventures, all information becomes limited to gossip and legends. The city of Nefer is the last remaining city of the kingdom of N'Ghai, it is said to be a place shrouded in fog and mystery, and surrounded by tall chalk cliffs, it is a seen as a small town, and is reputed to be a place for necromancers and torturers, what is really weird about this certain place, is that it is said that nine-tenths of Nefer is hidden underground, which is how the city got its nickname The Hidden City, who knows maybe Corlys even explored the underground part?

So far we are certain that he went on at least 2 voyages, since we know that he went back the first time he reached The Thousand Islands, and it is also said he was the first Westerosi who explored Nefer and N'Ghai which he cannot reach by ship without passing by The Thousand Islands, now that I've covered the north, its time for the even more interesting place; the south.

**Corlys Velaryon's voyages to the South of Essos.**

To the south of Essos lays The Jade Sea, which is reputedly known for high risk and high reward reputation, the more east you go by ship for trade, the more gold you get, many sailors sail to Qarth to trade spices and sell them to rich houses in Westeros and many even go as far as Asshai to trade goods for gold and riches, one of the things we know for certain is that Corlys sailed to the Jade Sea, and got so rich he filled his ship Sea Snake with gold, and went back to Westeros to later build a whole castle for his house on Driftmark. We can also assume that his voyages to the east were after the ones in The Shivering Sea, since he reached almost to the end of the world in the north, and it is also written that on his last voyage he passed by Qarth to buy ships.

The Golden Empire of Yi Ti was once probably the only civilization to ever succeed Valyria, it a vast land that has thick, green patchwork farmland and a verdant rain forest. The God-Emperor, was once the most powerful man in the world of Asoiaf, ruling over the lands of Yi Ti, which are as large as the whole northern part of Westeros, but now with more and more chaos and independence between houses and princes, and the nonstrategic place of the city of Yin(southern most point of Yi Ti), his reign has become limited to the walls of his city, Yin.  Lomas Longstrider, a famous Westerosi explorer who is also known for his adventures to Essos and The Further East, called Yi Ti ""the land of a thousand gods and a hundred princes, ruled by one god-emperor"", The locals of Yi Ti are of similar characteristics and looks of the people living in south-east Asia in the real world. Yi Ti is said by maesters to be the oldest living civilization in the world, dating back before the the rise of the Valyrian Freehold, The Ghiscari Empire, and even before The First Men crossed The Arm of Dorne into Westeros.

Leng, a large island as big as The Vale of Arryn near Yi Ti is home to a rather queer race, the Lengii are a slender race and are the tallest race of mankind, it is said that they reach seven or even eight feet in height, they are said to be the most beautiful of all the races, with large golden colored eyes and the skin color of oiled teak. It is said that mystical beings know as The Old Ones, live under the island's surface, and long ago instructed the empress of the island to slay all foreigners who set foot in the island multiple times, until Jar Har, the sixth sea-green emperor of Yi Ti, conquered Leng,  and closed all entrances to the underground cities and ordered the Lengii to forget them. Now, the Lengii have been driven back to the southern third of the island, since YiTish locals migrated into the northern 2 thirds after Jar Har's arrival in Leng.

It is written that almost all the wealth brought back by Corlys was from Yi Ti and Leng, but the Jade sea is a very vast place, with many islands filled with pirates, warlords, and slave traders. For all we know Corlys could have maybe landed in a lot of places on his way to Yi Ti, Qarth and Leng, including Tyrosh, The Stepstones, Lys, The Summer Isles, Naath, Basilisk Isles, Volantis, Slaver's Bay, Ghaen, Port Yhos, Great and Lesser Moraq, Isle of Whips, Isle of Elephants, Marahai and Manticore Isles.

Imagine a spin-off TV show based on his adventures, seeing all those magnificent places, and characters, meeting different races, with more fictional things taking place (magic, other races, etc) the show will be amazing, going on voyages with his crew, meeting all sorts of people with different cultures, and ethnics, and even seeing mystical creatures, battling with sorcerers, necromancers, and shapeshifters, and maybe even seeing the fish gods or the old ones and exploring their tombs and temples, making a TV show based on a story this diverse and unique may be costly, from all the CGI of creatures and make up for other races, but from what I think, we have never seen a TV show with such a big budget and similarity with movies than Game Of Thrones. I guess we'll have to wait and see, since we are expecting the eighth season next year, and 5 spin-off series, who knows maybe one of those five spin-offs is about Corlys and his voyages?

I just finished rewatching all of GOT, and am on the ACOK for my first read through. I found myself thinking about how people will remember this time in 300 years to come, 1000 years to come.

Out of all the people in the story, I think Jon will be the one bards will sing about in the future. His feats are incredible, and they are even more so if they are exaggerated like most historic events are.

Here's how an exaggerated history of Jon Snow would go in my mind:

---

Jon Snow is exiled from Winterfell from his angry mother at a young age. His skill on the field makes him the protegee of the nights watch commander as a young teen. He is valiantly captured by the biggest army of wildlings the world has ever seen. He singlehandedly escapes, slaughtering wildlings in his wake. Back at Castle Black, he fends off a 100,000 string wildling horde with 100 men after the other high-ranking commanders ran in fear. While holding back the wildlings waiting for Stannis he kills the leader of the Thenns in single combat and takes Tormund prisoner. 

After, he saves wildings from the Other army for the greater good, killing an Other in single combat. This act of valor causes him to die at the hands of the men he commanded, he is stabbed 13 times in the chest. After his death, he rose again by the grace of the gods. Being the first man to survive the ending of his night's watch vows he retakes the north from the tyrannical, flaying, evil Boltons, avenging Robb Stark, The King In the North.

After then he becomes Jon Snow the God King, risen from the dead.

As far as the rest of history, id say it depends on if the new books follow the show, but you can easily say that he also has the chance of ending the whitewalker threat as well.

---

I love history and reading about how it bends the truth so this is a fun thought experiment for me. I believe that after this is over, he will be remembered as Jon The God King. Do you think any other man in GOT lore will be as remembered as Jon Snow?",51,37,False,spoiler,,,,,

Jon and Daenerys will ended together. Arya or Jaime will kill Cersei. The Night King will lose to an alliance of all the good guys. Too much is too much.

3.\* Making the White Walkers the final boss.\* Honestly I hope they just wipe out everything in Westeros. At least that would be an unpredictable ending. There's a reason why I don't watch walking dead. Killing zombies is cheap entertainment. It might be expensive in costumes and CGI and it sure is cheap on dialogue and scenario. A better final boss would have been Littlefinger with Sansa at his side, or Cersei, or Daenerys, or Olenna, or Euron, or any alliance of any of those characters against Jon Snow and his unlikely allies (Tyrion, brotherhood, whoever believes Gendry is the true king, etc.. I'm sure we can find enough to make an interesting battle.) Even the High Septon spreading the seeds of rebellion accross the seven kingdoms would have been better.

2. \*Killing Littlefinger/Roose Bolton and Prince Doran.\* These were power players. These were the sharks (Jaime was talking about)\[[https://youtu.be/FZleUmd7ugA?t=94](https://youtu.be/FZleUmd7ugA?t=94)\] These guys were the reason Tywin's death was a good idea. We wanted to see them duke it out/team up/betray eachother to try to take Cersei's position. Olenna and the High Septon were good but not enough imo. If only the High Septon scenes were better I wouldn't complain but his dialogues were shit. Hardly impactful, repetitive and not a single instance of foreshadowing anything (One of GRRM's writing biggest strength imo).

I'm not saying they should die under no circumstance, but all 3 of them died before any of their implied genius/cunningness could even show. Their plans were effortlessly disrupted by much less interesting characters. At least Olenna/High Septon/Stannis/Robb had a chance to get brilliantly outplayed.

1. \*Having black and white characters\* Remember season 1? The Starks were the good guys right? And the Lannisters the bad guys right? Ned Stark (the whitest of all Game of Thrones), was hiding a Targaryen right under the nose of the King he swore fielty to. He killed a scared Night's watch deserter without verifying his claim that White Walkers exist. He wasn't the 2018 feminist women empowerer that Jon Snow is in season 7. Catelyn almost executed Tyrion unjustly. Sansa lied to protect Joffrey. The Lannisters didn't provoke the Starks into a war. They simply reacted to someone trying to take their crown. Renly/Robert were both ready to kill children for power. Even Jon Snow didn't always listen to his Night's Watch superiors. He tried to desert to help Robb (very grave offense punishable by death). He slept with Ygritte (also punishable by death). The closest we had to a fully good or fully evil character was Cersei and it was actually special and pointed out often explicitly by plenty of characters (Tyrion/Olenna/Arya) because back then, it was unique to have an evil character.

My point is everyone was gray. Now? Jon Snow,Dany, Tyrion and the Starks are whiter than Snow White. Night King, Cersei, Euron don't have a hint of good. They repeatedly chose black characters over gray ones. Why is this bad? Because now their decisions are predictable. Sansa is faced with a situation, what is she gonna do? I wonder! Of course she won't betray Arya lul. Fooled ya ;P .Damn Cersei could save Westeros by teaming up with Dany and Jon Snow, what is she gonna do? lul fooled ya again, of course she chose the most evil course of action possible.

To me it seems like theres plenty of people on both sides of this issue.

From what I gather:

Pros of watching series first:
-Put a name to a face
-Geographic visual
-Won't be let down by the lack of details coming from the book

Cons:
-Spoilers I guess?

Is this pretty much consensus information at this point? Everyone always says the books are way to complex and confusing if you have no prior knowledge. The writing style is also apparently awkward which doesn't help.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

Bran is in a trance, having a vision, while in the vision he wargs into vision Hodor and that allows him to control regular present Hodor while staying in the vision for no reason and seeming to not focus on controlling present hodor. He controls Hodor to make him drag his own body out of the tunnel and continues to controls him, forcing him to hold the door, giving up his own life. While Bran was sacrificing/killing Hodor, Meera shouted something unnecessarily at him (she didnt need to order him since bran was controlling him like meera had asked him to) and past vision Hodor heard this third-party in the present shouting at present hodor through bran's vision and this shout broke his brain forever? Was it a noble sacrifice on hodor's part? Did Bran stop controlling him at some point before he died? He didnt seem guilty or anything the next time we saw him.

383,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-7-6,2018,7,6,22,8wk0nh,self.gameofthrones,"[SPOILERS]Found this somewhere (it was about ygrite and jon),all credit goes to The the Genius",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8wk0nh/spoilersfound_this_somewhere_it_was_about_ygrite/,Acanitro,1530883292,"You people do realize that Jon is NOT the same boy he was when he met Ygritte? Here, he was quite literally a noob virgin, with no experience. Their romance worked well because a) they were both regular people. Jon might have been a sworn brother, but in those seasons he still carried some of that selfishness that comes with youth (people will remember that in S1 he acted better than everyone else, got bitter when Mormont named him steward instead of a ranger. At the time he was till too wrapped up in himself to see the bigger picture) Combine that with his inexperience when it comes to love and girls, and you get someone who is capable of cracking and giving in to his desires more easily (especially when you have someone as forceful as Ygritte coming on to him). Yet this romance, no matter how good was doomed to end, and here's why; it was a nescecary catalyst meant to develop Jon's character. Ygritte is quite literally Aemon's speech; love, selfish and turbulent love that in the end always ends up killing duty. You even get confirmation of this when Ygritte asks Jon to stay in the cave with her, ergo forsake his duty and the lives of his sworn brothers for love. Jon at this point, has spent some time with the wildlings, has seen what they are, and no matter how close he's become with them, he realizes that they will have no mercy on his brothers. He already has second thoughts about staying with Ygritte when the wildings kill that horse breeder and he is finally brought back to reality, whereupon he realizes that there are more important things than his desires. The values his instilled in him rise up and he makes the ultimate decision. To forsake love in favor of duty, thus killing the last remnant of that selfish boy, and finally becoming the self sacrificing and selfless Jon we know.  B) shes the alpha, the instigator, and he was the passive beta too shy to do anything but comply. When it comes to writing a romance, an alpha-beta relationship is the easiest thing to develop, since the alpha is there to instantly start it (almost immediately after they'd met, Ygritte started flirting with him, instantly confirming a romance) and quickly push it along (again, it's easy to develop a relationship and bring it to a quick climax when the alpha is constantly flirting and pretty much dominating the beta).  Now we come to Jon and Dany. He is no longer that naive, selfish and inexperienced boy. He is KITN, a grown man who got betrayed and murdered, a leader who has others depending on him. A man who has pushed love aside in favor of duty. He has become an alpha, a powerful alpha at that. Just like Dany (who had a similar alpha-beta relationship with Khal Drogo. One that transformed her into an alpha as well). The dynamic between the two is obviously going to be differert since a) they're self sacrificing monarchs who always put their people first. Their duties are front and center in their minds; that's why their first meeting was a charged power struggle rather than a session of romantic bantering. They didn't come before each other like a man and a woman, like Jon and Ygritte had. They met as a King and a Queen, two powerful players ready to gouge the other out as either a potential ally or enemy. In such strict conditions there obviously isn't going to be room for them to act freely and naturally. Even in the caves, when their body language hinted that they could relax and be natural around each other, their duties still loomed large enough to eclipse their personal desires. Jon quite simply said it best; there is no time for that. He has given up on love, because he has come to believe that it will interfere with his duty, and for that reason he resists his feelings. And since Dany is in the EXACT same situation as he, she is definitely not going to agressievly come on to him, like Ygritte had. Hence why their romance isn't going to be so blantantly obvious and in your face. Its going to happen through quick, guilty looks (something Davos and Tyrion have both pointed out, and we ourselves have seen in ep5 when Jon petted Drogon. He stared at her for half a second after she mentioned the dragons being her children before shaking his head and guiltily looking away, like he's already betraying his duty just by entertaining the idea), subtle body language (the cave scene and their farewell both hinted that they were now more open and trusting toward each other) and facial expressions (Dany's face when he told her he was going beyond the wall, their expressions during their convo after the mission beyond the wall).  B) they're both alphas, and such relationships are always more difficult to develop for any writer, mostly because such characters are on the same emotional level. Meaning that a relationship like that moves slowly, and subtly. And  it only officially starts when one of them exibits a moment of vulnerability (as Dany has in ep6) Only then, will their walls be broken down, and they will allow themselves to finally let go and love each other. Dany is quite literally everything Jon is, everything he has become. A love with her doesn't demand for him to sacrifice his duty, but rather emrabce and share it's burden with her (something which is echoed in  Dany's quote from ep6. ""We are going to destroy the NK and his army. We'll do it together"" So in conclusion of the stupid analysis no one is going to read, Ygritte is the love of Jon's youth, someone who shaped his character perfectly and made him into what he is today. Dany is the love of his manhood, someone who is going to strengthen his character and share his burdens. ",4,25,False,spoiler,,,,,

My idea is that the Night King destroys everything. From the Wall down to King's Landing, the NK wipes out all the characters in great battles, while the characters fight among themselves in infighting. (Like Cersei and Dany, for instance)
So The Night King takes King's Landing. He walks through the Red Keep turning the dead into wights. He reaches the throne room, and moves up to the Iron Throne. Then he sits on the Throne...
...and shatters. His link to every other White Walker and wight is broken and they die as well.

While in there, she has this hellucination/dream where she's in the throne room, it's snowing, she's approaching the throne, and right as she's about to touch it she turns around to see Drogo and their unborn child. Now I may be overthinking this but I thought it could be foreshadowing for the ending of the show, when Daenerys will choose love (Drogo) over power (the throne), and she won't rull after all. Plus, as we all know, she's no ordinary woman, her dreams come true! Whice made me think this could be a clue for the ending. What do you think?",18,21,False,spoiler,,,,,

Many people like a quantitude of characters best for an even more monstrous number of reasons. So I would like to ask every single one of you, who you think is the very best character of the show and name a reason for your answer.
Personally I like Tywin Lannister best, for the simple reason that he is incredibly smart and a fantastic tactician. But even more I like his recklessness and focus on solving problems at all costs.

Showrunners have confirmed it and there's simply not enough time to incorporate it into season 8 even if they wanted.

I still think Beric will sacrifice himself to bring back an important character. The way I see it, there are two possibilities.

Beric sacrifices his life to resurrect Jon after he's killed by the Night King or the army of the dead.

Beric sacrifices his life to resurrect the Hound after he dies from his wounds by the Mountain or the army of the dead.

In both instances, Beric is sacrificing his life to bring back someone he has a mutual respect for, and I feel that, if Beric does sacrifice himself to resurrect one of these men, that man is a strong Azor Ahai candidate. 

I have this image stuck in my head. We'll use the Hound as I feel it's the strongest example given their stronger emotional connection.

The Hound defeats the Mountain but dies shortly after from his wounds. Beric stands in front of his body, kneels beside him, studies him carefully and makes his decision. Raising his sword, he ignites it and says ""Lord of Light, I thank you for my life, but this man needs it more."" His eyes go dark and the fire goes out. Beric collapses dead as the Hound's eyes open. Realizing what he's done, the Hound screams into a cold dark sky, ""NO! Not for me! Take it back!""",28,19,False,spoiler,,,,,

My guess is that Gendry will become King in the end.

There's a reason why Melisandre took Gendry in. Otherwise, he'd have no part in the story. Like literally, his existence could have just been ignored and he could have lived his life not knowing who his father was. (And who would have cared if he died?)

My guess is that he will be legitimized (somehow) by the end of the series (TV series, not sure about the books) and that Dany and/or Jon will die. ***Sadface.***

Originally I thought that Jon and/or Dany would live to the end and become King and/or Queen. But after thinking about it and realizing that Gendry was taken in my Melisandre herself---who is instrumental in this Long Night Finale arc---I realized that her action in doing so was actually significant. And because she did so, I now believe that Gendry will become King of the Seven Kingdoms. (I don't know how he's going to be legitimized though....or maybe the Kingdom will just acknowledge that he's king because he's got Robert's blood and maybe Essos/the laws will be different after the Long Night? Idk.)

As much as I hate to say it, I think Dany and/or Jon are gonna die (and Gendry becomes King). Even if I didn't originally see it that way.

It sounds pretty anti-climactic, especially when we're talking about a non-main character (Gendry). But being that this is the end of the story, it's a valid ending.

What do you guys think? Feel free to share your thoughts.

Now that she has seen the world she understands that there are better things to fight for with all the power she has. Which is to fight for others, live be for others and even die for others.

But sitting on Iron Throne doesn't really matter to her any more. Her iron throne is leberation of the downtrodden and breaking the wheel of constant tussle between the kingdoms which crushs the people under it for centuries.

And now once she is closer the iron throne(the actual physical one) all the things that she ever wanted to do after gaining the iron throne would have been done even before she actually reaches/sits on it.

So the priest (of the God of Light, I can' t think of his name) who was able to resurrect people, had the Hound look into the fire and asked what he saw. Eventually the Hound said he saw a mountain that looked like an arrowhead. As the expedition went on, as they were walking, the Hound made a comment that that was the mountain that he saw in the fire, and later in the episode the priest died.

Now fast forward to the next season. What if the Hound is the next priest of fire. If you recall he did find some ""religion / spirituality"" with  when the small village/tribe he was with before they were killed, and he avenged their deaths. So he does have some sense of believing in a religion, and he has proven that he can ""read"" fire (for lack of a better term). This is beginning to get me to think, when (not if, WHEN) Clegane-Bowl happens, the Mountain starts to get the upperhand on the Hound, and he busts out not just the sword he's using, but rather a flaming sword like some of the others, and uses an flame imbued sword to kill his brother?

I'm going to use this thread as a personal ventilator when I start what I'm about to tell you next.

Usually we've been able to get summer holidays at the same time with my fiancee. Then we usually do a trip and some light traveling in our own country (we're Finnish). This summer was a bummer as my fiancee could not get her holidays at the same time as I have. In turn, I wasn't able to change my holidays to fir her's. So I ended up with something that's not even a bad thing. A lot of free time. I'm still planning on doing something else than just sitting in front of my TV but I believe it will be a big part of my holidays still.

I'm a big fan of the show and equally big fan of the books (although I'm still going on the Feast of Crows and have the Dance of Dragons to devour later on) and I've been wanting to do either a re-read of the books in a binge fashion or re-watch the show in binge fashion. Optimally you'd like to have the complete series you're binging on but I happened to have this rare opportunity of free time so I won't be too picky.

My fiancee works a job that makes her move around quite a bit. So she's going to be away about 4 or so days of the week. The time when she's home will be basically sleeping and maybe some dinner. So I'll also have the apartment almost completely to myself.

My plan is simple. My summer holidays start at 23rd or July. I intent to watch seasons 1-7 in 5 days during that first week. The total running time of those seven seasons will be approximately 63 hours and 30 minutes. I stock up on food and beverages (a lot of wine and strong alcohol is required so I can relate to characters as Tyrion and Robert Baratheon). I turn off my phone for the time when I'm watching. Which is going to be more or less 13 hours a day. Two breaks between the viewing so I can get some fresh air. Go running or hit the gym or just go to the beach and buy an ice cream. I'm going to limit my ""press stop and make a ridiculous face whenever someone surprising is killed"" to the upper tier characters only. Otherwise my schedule will be ruined. Ultimately, I hope to get a good head start as the fatigue is hitting me in days 4 and 5. I'd rather be few hours ahead of my schedule at the morning of the 4th than to be a second late. Last but no the least, I hope to figure out a drinking game for the series since few friends of mine will be joining this marathon for one sprint.

I've been working on how to fill my fridge to get enough nutrition for 5 intense days of sitting on the couch. At first I though I'd just buy the chips/chocolate/soda/frozen pizza/etc. combo that is usually the junk you eat while having a movie night. But my fiancee pointed out that I'm getting older. Already north of 30 and I can't do the same diet I did when I was younger. 5 days of cheese and nachos will ruin my insides forever. So I'll make a detailed menu following the 5 days. It will gradually get worse cause I do want to get the full candy/chocolate/beer/pizza/whiskey experience but I have to ease my body in to it.

Overall, I'm really excited to get off from work and start watching GoT. It will probably be almost overwhelming but I feel confident that I can make it happen.

Wish me luck! I will be posting on this topic as my plans advance. In a week I'm starting to carry the drinks home. Will be fun.

Here's the original Maggie the frog prophesy.

The third question of Cersei to maggie.

**QUOTE**

""Cersei:*Will the king and I have children?*

Maggy:*Oh*, **AYE**. *Six-and-ten for him, and three for you. Gold shall be their crowns and gold their shrouds, she said. And when your tears have drowned you, thevalonqarshall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you.*""

**END QUOTE**

Did you see the irony here? Cersei asks the witch whether she will have children with the king.

The Witch replies:oh **AYE**.

If Cersei didn't have any children with the King, the traditional reply should be:Oh **NAY**!

clever,clever GRRM. always confuses his readers to trick them to believe something else.

So "" *three for you* "" is exclusive to Cersei **ALONE** whereas ""*six-and-ten for him(king)*"" is mutually exclusive to **BOTH** King Robert and Queen Cersei( meaning the child of Cersei and Robert is **included** in this).

This is why GRRM said not to interpret prophesies literally or too simplistically. according to him,prophecy has a lot of loopholes and metaphorical meaning.",11,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

For me, I wish it was addressed or discussed more. It kind of just happened and everyone was like ok. Even Sansa (who knows) had no on-screen reaction or comment about it. If the resurrection had impact on the story, I could see the relevance of it, but after about an episode they went on as if it never happened. He fucking came back to life!!

Let me list out those details which I found mysterious 

1) Gendry suddenly  reappears after 3 seasons, right at his blacksmith forge in Kings Landing. he was living right under the nose of cersei all these years.

2) remember that all bastards of robert were ordered to be killed down by joffrey in season 1. Also the guards came searching for gendry in the smithy. Isn't it curious that Gendry lived in that same armory for about 4 years? 

3) how did Gendry survive all these years , with a high profile as a blacksmith who arms the lannister army right under the nose of Queen cersei? And that too in that same armory where the guards came searching for him. 

4) In season 7 episode 5; cersei tells Jaime that she allowed Jaime to meet with Tyrion.  She tells him "" do you think anything happens in this city without me knowing it?""

Hmm... Cersei is speaking about Jaime meeting up with Tyrion. But guess what, another thing too happened. Davos who arrived with Tyrion,  met up with Gendry ( who was arming the lannisters) and took him out of the city without much difficulty. 

What does this mean?? How can a blacksmith be taken out so easily? Cersei allowed that to happen as well! She knew about Tyrion entering the city, so logically, she should also know that davos was entering the city.

5) one possibility is that she allowed davos to smuggle gendry out so that gendry would actually meet up with Tyrion.  Remember, in the same episode she suggests that "" I believe an arrangement with the dragon queen is in the best of our interests "". So this means  she had already decided to have a meeting with Tyrion.  In this meeting, she could possibly reveal Gendry as the heir to the iron throne to Tyrion and could persuade Tyrion to switch loyalty  ( which might have happened in their backdoor conversation ).

Folks, I don't know if it's a stretch, but it would be nice to hear your nice thoughts and suggestions as well",13,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

How can she say that the Wheel is unfair and needs to be destroyed when she herself wants to cement herself as ruler of the Seven Kingdoms?

639,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-7-9,2018,7,9,13,8x839k,self.gameofthrones,[SPOILERS] Arthur Dayne's Death,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8x839k/spoilers_arthur_daynes_death/,mAReDux,1531110189,"After giving it some thought, I firmly believe that he lost on purpose. Here's why.

First off, the idea of being a great fighter has been challenged in GoT. There seems to be a consistent dilemma that states that the better fighter does not necessarily win - and ultimately the better fighter is the one who ends up winning, like with how Bronn is accused of fighting dirty and Oberyn losing to the Mountain. So I believe that in context, Arthur Dayne's death was too cheap compared to his reputation. Especially considering that even from the start, Arthur Dayne and his companions were wildly better fighters than Ned Stark's crew. If Arthur Dayne and his friends were accepted by everyone, including people like George Martin, The Three-Eyed Raven and Jamie Lannister as the greatest fighters to ever walk the earth, then they would not be dying to Howland Reed. No, I believe that if in the GoT world, this man is accepted by all to be the G.O.A.T, then he would be unkillable through such cheap-shots, which shouldn't even be that unexpected to Dayne who, being who he is, would know that Reed did not die or receive a major injury and continues to be a potential threat in that fight if he completely ignores him.

Secondly, there is no point in Arthur Dayne winning. Many more soldiers would come even if he defeated Ned. However, if anyone found out that Lyanna had a baby, they would kill him because he is the heir of Rhaegar. So if Arthur Dayne kills Ned Stark and dies afterwards, which eventually he would, then the baby dies. If he runs, he'd have to live in exile and how far can he run when Lyanna is about to die and he has to carry a baby? If he leaves Lyanna like that, people would know she gave birth and the baby is missing along with Arthur Dayne, whom I imagine is a very recognizable face in the seven kingdoms. So for Jon to live, Arthur Dayne and the other Kingsguard had to die. However, had they left all of Ned's crew alive, too many people would know about Jon. So, two were left alive. The uncle and an explanation on how Arthur Dayne lost to Ned Stark.

Thirdly, what possible reason could Arthur Dayne have to fight Ned Stark if not to feed the belief that Lyanna was kidnapped? Dayne, Rhaegar and obviously Lyanna all knew that Lyanna was not kidnapped. Why fight Ned in the first place? Lyanna was never a prisoner. Ned was not going to hurt his sister or her baby. Why fight him? 

Fourth - Rhaegar would never want Ned Stark dead. Rhaegar would have known that Ned would come for Lyanna. Would he actually want his men to murder his wife's brother? Rhaegar aside, Lyanna would never approve of this. This is the equavilent of say Arya's loving husband killing Robb Stark to protect Arya. This makes no sense.

Fifth, the fact that Ned knows where they are. Why does he know this? The theory is that the Starks tortured Rhaegar's men and made them talk. Why would Rhaegar's men know about this if that's the only way Lyanna would not be safe? 

Sixth, Ned was the only way Jon got to live. Rhaegar knows he will probably die on the battlefield, Lyanna after a point knows she's not going to make it. So what's the plan here for them? Have Arthur Dayne kill the uncle and run around the seven kingdoms with a newborn baby strapped next to his sword? No. They have to give the baby to somebody. Rhaegar, Lyanna, Arthur Dayne and the two other men sworn to protect Rhaegar are sitting on a table, deciding what they will do with the baby. Even if Lyanna lives, she can not let anyone know the baby is hers. So they have to give it to somebody. Obviously, Lyanna suggests here that Ned is a honorable man and he will take care of Jon like he's his own. Everyone on that table likes and respects Ned and he is the uncle afterall, so they all decide that Ned will take it and say its his bastard. 

Finally, the obvious wishing Ned good fortune in the wars to come when it should, on paper be a major mismatch that Arthur Dayne and his friends would never be expected to lose. People say this is a sign of respect when in reality there are no irregularities in speech in the GoT world where people use some idioms more differently than we are accustomed to. Mance Ryder said this to Stannis when in fact he knew that Stannis had many wars to come, it was very fitting. Arthur Dayne, being who he is should know for a fact that he's looking at a dead man. Why wish him good fortune in the ""Wars to come"", instead of just wishing him good fortune in that one? He would literally have to be mocking Ned. Can anyone state that the Sword of the Morning, along with 2 of the deadliest fighters in the seven kingdoms, who are confident enough to say that Robert would be dead had they been at the battle, would actually believe they would lose 3 vs 6 while defending stairs against 4 squires, a scrub and the mediocrity of Ned Stark?

No. They clearly all died on purpose. They wanted to fight the war but Rhaegar told them they were all going to die anyway but if they died defending the Tower of Joy, there was a chance that they would save their prince, Jon.",60,36,False,spoiler,,,,,

so let us make the analysis on how the war of the roses ended and deduct how it applies in westeros.

***War of the roses ended when King Henry who descended from the lancasters through his mother married Elizabeth of House York, thereby establishing peace between the various houses and then came to rule British Isles.***

DIDNT GET THE ANALOGY?

READ AGAIN!

***War of the roses(War of the five kings) ended when King Henry(Gendry) who descended from the lancasters(lannisters) through his mother (cersei in game of thrones) married Elizabeth(sansa) of house york(stark), thereby establishing peace between the various houses and then came to rule the British Isles( Westeros).***

haha! so the ending code might have been cracked already. this is so unpredictable as well, right??

this indicates that gendry is actually the son of robert and cersei and that he might marry sansa in the end to rule the iron throne. also, i think jon and dany would die and that their kid would be brought by sansa and gendry as their own, this would establish a harmony between the 4 major houses in game of thrones logo, houses stark, baratheon, targaryen and lannister.",0,1,False,self,,,,,

There's a scene in the television series where Vary's literally explains constructivism. It's [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=108&amp;v=0pxSRa5KRKc). For those who don't know, it's a theory in IR that proposes that power is a manifestation of social perception, or as put by Vary's ""power resides where people think power resides"".

The concept of the Iron Throne also seems to be a nod to realism, the idea that a leviathan-esque power is required in order to establish order and peace, and in the state of nature the world quickly descends back into chaos and disorder - for example the wars that plague Westeros result from a lack of centralised power, the very sort of power the Targaryan's were able to provide thanks to their dragons. Without the risk of being turned to char, people let loose their political ambition and turn Westeros into a war ravaged land (the war of the five kings).

Also, seems to be lots of nods to this through characterisation - for example, many characters are inherently Machiavellian, e.g Tywin and Stannis.

First let me say that I loved the music score in the intro, which is fantastic. I also loved most of the cast. The storyline itself is full of mystery and intrigue. Its really suspenseful and gripping and kept me wanting to watch more and more.
Even the sex scenes in the first episodes became less bothering, since they just portrayed that GoT is a fantasy of hedonism. 

Especially the final shot of E10, with Daenerys holding the three dragons is simply breathtaking and so powerful.

In the end I still feel that something is missing; I understand that everything leads to something even bigger, but comparably everything seemed so small scale in the first season. Everything was only teased, built up a little bit but there was never a catharsis. 
Basically, the whole Season one felt like a great pilot for the complete series. 

Still, a question I have: How did the Starks capture Jaime? I mean why didnt they show us this battle? They cut right before the action. This felt really anticlimactic for me.


In the end, I really want to continue watching GoT. Its not my favourite TV show (thatll probably always be Hannibal) but the first season gave me more than I expected, though I still think theres room for improvement.

I dont like numbers, but itll probably end up on a great 7.5/10",26,13,False,spoiler,,,,,

And we assume that thats what happened. White walkers are robots designed to attack humans....But what if thats not what happened. What if the first walker was in fact a Stark and what if the spell, or what have you, that the children gave him wasnt enough. What if the first walker, a Stark, refused to just be a puppet that attacked his own people. That the children were not all that powerful since they were defeated eventually. And what if he wasnt this all powerful being we see in the night king. Hes stronger, sure. But can be killed by any weapon. Hes a stronger human that looks like a walker, basically.
He resists the children and decides to live in isolation rather than attack his own people. He is a Stark and they love their honor dont they?. But eventually the children try their ritual on others. Some do what the first did. Refuse. So the children go after... less than the noble, and these people, born from tragedy and seek revenge LOVE their new strength, and thats when they start attacking humanity, and eventually their makers. Through the new walkers they have created they have started their, and the first mens, own doom. BUT the very first walker fights these new walkers back. He doesnt fight them to end them, but to help them. Helps them to understand that they are puppets to the children. That they are better than being strings to the others.
Some walkers he has to kill.
Some believe what he is saying and join his side....
But some..
They follow as well, but with motivations to eventually go back and kill every person they can..
The first walker, now the leader of a tribe of white walkers, has a child. The first pure white walker.
His father and mother preach that, while their circumstances are terrible, not all of humanity is bad. That it only takes a small group to create the perspective that a race is rotten and evil. That the first men, and children will hold what the walkers are by using what a fraction of them did. Not what the whole are. That the first men will not approve of their existence. They warn their sons new found power not use his power for harm. For that will prove their point.
For they bring the winter.
Through this pure borns childhood he discovers how strong his powers can actually be...
Hes stronger than the rest. He cant be hurt with simple weapons. He can bring a cold that others cant imagine.
This gives those that have wanted to hurt the children and humanity this entire time time to flood his mind with hate, anger, and revenge.
They encourage his anger and aggression. Telling him that he and his people do not deserve to live in isolation the way his father wants.
He starts to believe it.
The first pure is now a teen. Growing his own thoughts and ideas. Although others have tried to corrupt his mind with hate and revenge, he really tries to continue and follow his parents wisdom.

Hes lived with small attacks against his people. Fought back, himself. It was not new to him.
But one day. It was not just the small group of rebels that they were used to. This was an army. The greatest army created. Meant for one specific reason- to wipe the walkers out.
The teen fought back, but there were too many. He watched the ones he loved be slaughtered. The people he loved and cared for killed for no reason.
His people that sought isolation for peace were not even given that.
They were hunted.
He held his bleeding mother in his arms, still a child, he started to cry. His fathers dead body next to hers. His mother couldnt get a last word out. She looked into his eyes and was gone.
He remembered the warnings that others gave to him about the first men.
The pure born stood by his parents bodies. The remaining forces gather around him ready to kill.
The pure born kneels, defeated. Ready for death. The first men leader expresses condolences. Im sorry little one.
As the first mens leader contemplates his decision, one of his men starts to undress the pure ones mothers body for jewelry....
Others take apart his fathers body for evidence.
Before the leader can attack this disrespectful behavior.. the wind howls and grows COLD. A cold no one has felt. The pure born stands with his fists clenched. The man that searched his mother goes for the stab, his blade shatters. The Night King pick him up by his throat and snaps it. The Night King manages to kill the most. Some run.
Through hundred and thousands of years he is training to resurrect his people. When he does, they are not the ones he remembers. Just bones and dust. His loved ones are gone forever. But some remain... ready for his command.",7,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

I was creating an overview of how many hours a week my friends and I had to watch Game Of Thrones and was encouraged to share.

Included features:

1. Overall list of episodes (with wiki links).
2. Season time totals.
3. How many episodes you have to watch daily, weekly and monthly (updates daily).
4. Second tab with option to input name and number of watched episodes to recalculate your estimates.

Disclaimers include:

1. Today command set to CET time.
2. A month is set to 30 days.
3. Trolls will be trolls, so either copy to own Google Drive or expect your name to be removed.
4. Release date is set to first of April.
5. You should only be able to change a8 to a100 and b8 to b100 in 'Personal Progress'.

TL:DR You need to watch more than 14 minutes of GOT until release from now on.

Im currently really in a GOT vibe (watched all 12 episodes in 2 days) and therefore wanted to share some thoughts.

I really love the visuals, the characters, the acting, the storyline, the intrigue and the mystery. I also think that the use of sex &amp; violence is mainly there to show that the fantasy of Westeros is a world of hedonism (though I find some of the incest and graphic sex scenes a bit irritating) 

Still I feel like the narration is really slow. At the end of an episode, I never really have the feeling that much happened - because, well, nothing much happened. Its not like theres just bland space in the episodes; its filled with crisp dialogues and interesting sub plots, that just arent really that important.

For example, the first season was basically a pilot for the whole GoT. All of the teased battles or teased consequences, encounters etc. Never really embraced. 
I know, its good to have a deep introduction and characterization, but if the introduction takes 10 episodes - thus 10 hours, I find this to be a tad long.
I mean, if someone really needed to summarise what real important happened in Season one: - Ned Stark, Robert &amp; Khal Drogo are dead, Joffrey is the new king and Daenerys got 3 dragons.


My question: Is the narration for the rest of the series also this slow or do we get enough culminations or battles?",19,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

Later, in the same episode, while Robert and Ned are having a meal on the King's Road, Robert half-jokingly suggests to Ned that the two of them should abandon the caravan and roam the King's Road together, ""swords at [our] sides, couple of tavern wenches to warm [our] beds tonight."" Ned responds, ""If you would have asked me twenty years ago...""
  
Essentially, Ned's telling us that by the time he left for Robert's Rebellion, he had stopped the sleeping around and was completely faithful to his wife, and therefore did not father a child while he was away.

The reason i ask is because he's really not doing anything wrong per se. He's following his doctrine just like any good religious person so maybe you guys (religious fans) actually like him. But his character is so infuriating and annoying that his devoutness to religion and how he's going to extremes of punishing beloved characters highlights how religion/cults can be ridiculously excessive and insane especially in medieval times therefore undermining religion.

We know that in the books Dany will deal with 3 treasons, the last one for love.

We also know from set leaked photos that Winterfell will burn, and apparently Martin originally planned to make Tyrion burn it for jealousy of Jon and Arya relationship (she was in love with her), maybe now he's using Jon and Daenerys.

840,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-7-11,2018,7,11,21,8xzb1y,self.gameofthrones,[SPOILERS] CERSEI GENDRY THEORY SEASON 7 HINTS,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8xzb1y/spoilers_cersei_gendry_theory_season_7_hints/,shadowwarrior8,1531313569,"It's quite possible that Tyrion and Cersei agreed  to make gendry the king. Gendry is the secret son. 

Apart from the conventional hints used by other proponents of gendry cersei theory, there are new hints in season 7 as well. They are:

1) Gendry survived **right under the nose of cersei literally as her royal blacksmith** who arms the lannister army, all these years. ( remember that gendry was a wanted man for goldcloaks and they came looking for him in his armory. besides, even though arya deceived the goldcloaks by telling them that a dead boy is gendry, we still see goldcloaks looking for the blacksmith in the episodes of harrenhall in season 3).

2) In season 7 episode 5, cersei tells Jaime **that she allowed the meeting to happen** between Jaime and Tyrion. She also says to him *"" do you think anything happens in the city without me knowing it?""*. Ring any bells? This means that **she also allowed davos to meet up with gendry** and smuggle him out of King's landing. Now why would she allow that? ANSWER IS: **SHE WANTED GENDRY TO MEET UP WITH TYRION**. She wanted to convince Tyrion that gendry **is better king/ruler** than Dany. 

3) in their conversation in season 7 episode 7, cersei implies to Tyrion that **Dany is not the good monarch** he hoped for. she's rooting for Tyrion to switch sides and make gendry king. ( if you deeply watch that scene again you will understand)

4) Cersei's promise to EURON. Cersei promised EURON that she would marry him **after the war is won**. Why would she allow herself to do this? SHE knows EURON is a brother killer and he shouldn't be allowed anywhere near the iron throne. The explanation is, this is just part of her plan. After she wins the war, she could reveal the identity of gendry and make him the king. And **then** she can marry EURON,  and thus protect iron throne from being hijacked by EURON. This would also ensure her safety since her son is the king. this would also ensure the loyalty of ironborn.

5) in season 6 ending,  during her coronation scene, cersei gives a **reluctant grave look** to Jaime. This means she doesn't want the iron throne. She wants gendry on the iron throne. However, she doesn't want to lose her last remaining son in the game of thrones, like she lost her other three. So she decides to play the game for herself, eliminate all her rivals and **then** reveal the identity of gendry and make him king. This would protect him.

I think that some sort of deal happened in that mostly offscreen meeting.

Let's first start by analysing the relevant part of THEIR CONVERSATION IN SEASON 7 EPISODE 7

Tyrion: ""*if there's no future, then why are we here? why did you allow me to come?*""

Cersei:""*Not to help my enemies collaborate in my destruction.*""

Tyrion:""*Yes, no. Its not that you hoped for, but you* ***must have hoped for something!***""

( Tyrion is basically trying to give cersei a concession. he directly asks what cersei wants)

Cersei:"" *what did you hope for? to make jon snow submit to your queen*?""

( well, seems like cersei have some other intentions)

Tyrion:""*Not like this*""

Cersei:"" *but eventually you want him to have to bend the knee to her.*""

Tyrion: ""*YES*""

Cersei:""**WHY?**""(Hmmm what is cerseis intention here?)

( cersei is basically asking tyrion the reason **why he allied with Daenarys.** )

Tyrion:""*Because I think she would make the world a better place*"" 

Cersei:""**YOU SAID SHE WOULD DESTROY KINGS LANDING!**""

(HEY FOLKS, the entire tone and WAY of this conversation makes me a bit doubtful.**CERSEI IS TRYING TO COMMUNICATE TO TYRION THAT DEANARYS IS not his desired monarch**. IS SHE IMPLYING THERE COULD BE ANOTHER **WHO IS BETTER THAN DEANARYS?**)

(**NOTE THE MENTAL STATE OF TYRION**\- **he's clearly disappointed in Dany not listening to him, burning tarlys, burning lannisters, refusing his request to create a line of succession to iron throne** and other tensions- that was his character arc the entire season 7.Hes clearly losing hope in Dany)

Tyrion: ""*she knows herself. she chose an advisor who would check her worst impulses instead of feeding them. thats the difference between you*.""

And then Cersei says: ""*I dont care about checking my worst impulses; I dont care about making the world a better place. That thing you dragged here; i dont know what it is; i dont know what it means; and when it came at me I didnt think about the world not at all. As soon as  it opened its mouth, the world disappeared for me right down its black throat. All i could think about was keeping those gnashing teeth away from* ***the ONES who matter most****, away from my family.*""

(FOLKS!She says ""***the ONES who matter most***"". Its surely more than one. One is jaime, who is the other? the foetus in her womb is not even a person and she is barely 2 or 3 months pregnant)

Cersei proceeds: "" *Maybe euron greyjoy had the right idea. get on a boat, take those who matter...*""

TYRION interrupts:""*YOU ARE PREGNANT*.""

**THE SCENE ABRUPTLY CUTS.**

The conversation is abruptly cut here. we dont know what they said afterwards.

now let us have a quick recap from the books and show and then link this conversation to the wider story arc.

In the books Deanarys is prophecised to have 3 betrayals- for gold,for blood,**and for love**. In the show Dany already had the first two.

**I THINK THE NEXT BETRAYAL WILL BE FROM TYRION FOR THE LOVE OF HIS FAMILY AND WESTEROS.**

This is why I think Dany will die. Possibly out of poisoning orchestrated by Tyrion to make it look as if she would die from pregnancy.(its confirmed that Dany would die at childbirth next season. Dany actor said about her role in season 8 ***""It f\*\*\*\* me up""***. see the link  [https://metro.co.uk/2018/05/23/emilia-clarke-says-daenerys-weird-ending-game-thrones-fcked-7572979/](https://metro.co.uk/2018/05/23/emilia-clarke-says-daenerys-weird-ending-game-thrones-fcked-7572979/) &amp; [https://www.bustle.com/p/daenerys-final-game-of-thrones-scene-apparently-really-messed-with-emilia-clarke-9189758](https://www.bustle.com/p/daenerys-final-game-of-thrones-scene-apparently-really-messed-with-emilia-clarke-9189758)).

so this is why I think dany would die in season 8, most probably by poisoning during her labour. I dont know maybe tyrion would use samwell tarly to posion her. (remember dany burned his dad and brother alive.)

Now, coming to the next part.

who are ""***the ONES who matter most***"" that cersei mentions? 

one we know for sure is jaime. who is other?? its obviously not tyrion, nor can it be the unborn foetus in her womb, since she is barely 3 or 2 months pregnant.

so for many such reasons I have come to the assumption that **she's referring to gendry.**

**yeah, I think gendry is the trueborn son of robert and cersei and the rightful heir to the iron throne.**

I came to this conclusion for many reasons. see these links below:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8xzb1y/spoilers\_cersei\_gendry\_theory\_season\_7\_hints/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8xzb1y/spoilers_cersei_gendry_theory_season_7_hints/)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8x1hd5/spoilers\_gendry\_cersei\_theory/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8x1hd5/spoilers_gendry_cersei_theory/)

for those who **say that the maggy the frog prophecy stipulates/limits cersei's children to 3** see this link below:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8wzwhn/spoilers\_maggy\_the\_frog\_prophesy\_loophole/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8wzwhn/spoilers_maggy_the_frog_prophesy_loophole/)

so for these reasons i have come to the conclusion that Gendry is trueborn son of Cersei and Robert and her only surviving kid. so what I have concluded is that **cersei revealed the truth about Gendry to Tyrion** in the offscreen conversation.  

Also, remember that **cersei allowed ser davos to meet up with gendry.** ( she tells jaime that she allowed the meeting between jaime and tyrion to happen. **by analogy**, this would mean that she also allowed ser davos to smuggle gendry out of kings landing.) why would she do this?? the logical explanation is that **she wanted gendry to meetup with tyrion.** she knew tyrion wouldnt hurt gendry. we know how all that unfolded, gendry saved tyrions life from the guards and the two developed a close friendship.

so what really happened in that secret meeting? what was the deal that Tyrion made with Cersei?

I think that **Tyrion offered Cersei to kill Daenarys**, most probably through poisoning . ( or probably cersei demanded it from him.) and then he would **give allegiance to Gendry.** In return cersei would **offer to fight against the undead** in the coming Great War. yeah, cersei would basically wait until the undead army destroys winterfell and then join up with the remnants of northern army to fight the undead. **SO BASICALLY, CERSEI AGREED NOT TO FIGHT WITH NORTHERN-ESSOSI COALITION OF DANY AND JON, BUT TO JOIN THE FIGHT AT A LATER STAGE WHEN THE NORTHERN-ESSOSI COALITION IS SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKENED.**

this makes complete sense.

Although he is a commoner and a blackmsith who grew up in a slum,**GENDRY IS A PERFECT CANDIDATE FOR TYRION**.Gendry is a commoner, he can **BREAK the wheel**.Also **GENDRY SAVED TYRIONS LIFE** IN KINGSLANDING FROM THE GUARDS.

 some people say that nope,Cersei was negotiating about putting her baby(foetus) in the iron throne. I cant see how this is happening.Dany will never agree to the child of cersei to succeed her.Also, **Tyrion is looking for a monarch to rule**, not a baby. Tyrion is not that stupid to betray Dany for Cersei. However,GENDRY FITS PERFECTLY FOR TYRION. TYRION WOULD PREFER GENDRY TO DANY ANY TIME. ALSO **GENDRY IS HIS FAMILY.**

AND THE FUNNY PART? GENDRY WONT KNOW ANY OF THIS UNTIL THE VERY LAST EPISODE WHEN HE IS REVEALED AS THE SON OF CERSEI.

**AND THIS IS WHY THE SHOWRUNNERS STILL SHOW A STAG SIGIL OVER KINGSLANDING. WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT???**

yeah, that's it folks. I'm done , took a long time.

I have only watched the show and not read the books as of right now.

okay so I've noticed the number 3 is connected to daenerys A LOT. the three heads of the dragon, the fact that her mother has had three children, the fact that as of right now she's had three lovers, etc, 

also i noticed that in order for her dragons to hatch she had to essentially sacrifice three people. She due to her actions whether she knew the things that would happen or not sacrificed rhaego for drogo, then had to sacrifice drogo out of mercy, she then sacrificed Mirri out of revenge. There's that number 3 again, that in the end result caused three dragons to be born. 

Maybe i'm just thinking too much into it but its got to be foreshadowing future events, maybe perhaps she even winds up birthing twins, to set her number of children to 3. Forgive my rambling it's just really been nagging at me and no one i know watches it to get into a discussion about it. ",6,6,False,spoiler,,,,,

The TLDR summary is this: the Three Eyed Raven is Bran's mind trapped in a time loop, his mind stored in the weirwood trees and passed on through the years in host Greenseers until he merges with his younger self through Bloodraven and becomes the infinite Bran, goes back in time to the Long Night to stop the NK, fails then has to wait centuries to do it all again.

Those with *time* to kill...proceed...

First, a word on GoT ""time travel."" I think the Three Eyed Raven telling Bran the ink is dry was a warning but also a lesson that ""young Bran"" never seems to learn from infinite Bran, I think he is warning himself that no matter what he does, at this point, these events already happened. So if Bran does try to repeat the Hodor scenario but harness his powers to change history, it already happened and was reflected in the story we see so it will change nothing but in fact ensure events take place. So it's impossible for him to go back and ""kill the Night King"" because there would be no Night King at this point in the story if he had pulled it off. So ""time travel"" won't effect the story in some kind of Back to the Future way where he can come back to a changed present like Marty did when Biff got the sports almanac. 

Time travel is more a window to look through and Bran might just fall through it...he has bad luck with windows. 

So if there is a loop it might be similar to the Terminator, where Kyle Reese goes back in time to save John Connor who turns out to be the son he created by going back in time. So we don't know how the causal time loop started but because Kyle could go back, John sprung into existence because Kyle would go back.

Equating this to the Three Eyed Raven and Bran: The Three Eyed Raven I believe is Bran's mind, traveled back thousands of years and disconnected from his body, stored in the weirwood's and hosted by Greenseers that it could inhabit. He forged a strong alliance with the Children of the Forest in this time. 

Now there may be a question of how the Children are aligned with him but if he is a Greenseer and they love the trees it would be natural for them to gain each others trust, look into each others minds and come to the conclusion that neither is out to harm the other but protect their own kind. So I think in this way it might have been Bran that really ended the war, showing the Children of the Forest the future their Night King created and maybe resulting in the pact with man. The prequel series might even cover this since Bran could be going back to the time the show will cover.  

With Bran trapped he would have existed as the Three Eyed Raven and influenced mankind through the ages. I'm not saying Bran is the same Bran who built every structure like others theorize but he might have been around experiencing these things and becoming desensitized to the people of Westeros as he watched them make war on each other. 

The Three Eyed Raven we meet would be Bloodraven who has merged with Bran's mind, a Greenseer used as a host for the Three Eyed Raven. He has both memories of his own and infinite Bran. The Three Eyed Raven would have used his powers to guide his younger self to him, using the Reeds. Once young Bran met the Three Eyed Raven that carried infinite Bran inside of him it would be time to ""merge"" even though he ""wasn't ready"". 

""The time has come for you to become me."" When the Three Eyed Raven died, his mind passed into young Bran turning him into infinite Bran. He would have remembered being on the other side of this when he was young Bran and remembered not being ready. 

When young Bran saw the realization of his past, present and future all coming together it probably melted his brain a little resulting in the distant and robotic Bran that 'isn't really Bran anymore' (according to Meera). It is Bran however its just Bran who has seen this whole story an infinite amount of times and can't get off the ride no matter how many times he warns himself the ""ink isn't dry"".

This leaves a few questions:

Why did Bran go back in the first place? Likely to stop the Night King. Even though he was told ""the ink isn't dry"" Bloodraven with Infinite Bran inside of him warned him plenty, the younger Bran I think still has a major influence over the Infinite Bran and causes himself to make the same mistake over and over, go back to try and change something that can't be changed. 

(in my opinion more than Jon and Dany, the Night King clearly wants to kill Bran and the Three Eyed Raven and the Children of the Forest. He walked past Jon who was sunk in a lake and threw a spear past Dany but he came head on at Bran with everything he had, Bran was the goal not getting around Bran like Jon or getting something from him like Dany's dragons)

So why does the Night King want him dead? A Causal loop could be at play. It could be that it was Bran going back in time that somehow caused the NK to exist or helped defeat him in the past, the NK could be out for revenge on Bran and his infinite self for being born or beaten.

How could Bran's loop end? Young Bran is led by Jojen under the influence of his infinite self to a cave. He teaches and then downloads himself into younger Bran. This version of Bran would have infinite versions of Bran going back in time to the Long Night in his head. This Infinite Bran fights in the current war until he decides to go back (never learning his lesson that the ink is dry). He goes back and I would think his body is destroyed in the present. He is then back where he started, in the Long Night with the Children of the Forest and passing through host bodies of Greenseers for hundreds of years until his younger self is born and he can try again by merging with that Bran. 

I don't know if what we're watching would be the ""last loop"" and it will be broken or Bran will learn something new to stop the war once and for all or if its just another iteration. I won't give away spoilers to another massive epic book series but it used a similar device for its story. I do wonder if Bran does go back and there is a loop if it will feed into the spin off show that will take place during the long night. Any way props to Rick and Morty for putting the idea in my head...   ",6,6,False,spoiler,,,,,

What if the bittersweet ending is the undoing of the universe weve grown to watch. GRRM has said the show takes a lot of historic influence, so what if the end for this show is the transition from Monarchy to Democracy. 

Through out the show, and especially in S7 we got a LOT of hints of this being the potential and logical end of the series. 

With the rise of the high sparrow we see the Power a popular figure can have. In S7 succession is also an enormous issue, especially when considering that at the moment at face value Danny cant have an heir; so what does Tyrion suggest, he brings up the Iron Islands and Nights Watch has having their own methods of selecting a leader. Dannys goal has always been to break the wheel, what better way than to replace it all together. 

Maybe the end is the common folk of Westeros are so fed up of the wars and the game of thrones and its impact on them the series end is the small folk rising up and removing all of the Kings and Queens on the board.  ",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

However, if they could've got past their bad blood, I think we could've seen a really incredible plot in the final season.
Consider that right before Jamie's departure, Jamie was the last truly competent general Cersei had left, and Bronn was Jamie's right hand man. Though the show never explicitly states it, it appears that Bronn holds some kind of high rank in the Lannister army at this point, as he can be seen giving commands, and only takes orders from Jamie himself. Let's say Bronn doesn't awkwardly exit the Dragon Pit, but instead stays put on the Lannister's side. This would make sense, as Bronn is still anticipating the Lannisters will be able to offer him the greatest reward for his efforts, regardless of the outcome of the inevitable war. Instead of leaving with Podrick, which implies Bronn may be heading north with the rest of our ""good guy"" gang, Bronn would likely head back to the Red Keep with Cersei and Co. Now, exit Jamie, who at no point is shown communicating his plans to Bronn and seems to leave King's Landing alone and in a rush. 
Our assumption from the final episode is that Bronn is also headed north, and because of their contractual obligations, it will only make sense for Flynn to join the North cast. However, ignoring the contracts, here's what I think could've happened, and I would have loved to see it:
Jamie leaves, and Cersei, while waiting for Euron to return with the Golden Company, needs a resourceful commander to lead her armies. Bronn, seeing an opportunity to double his bets, goes to Cersei and informs her that as a proven warrior, as Jamie's right hand man (literally), and as an old consort of Tyrion, Bronn is in the best position to both command her troops and completely anticipate, counter, and destroy her brothers' forces. He would work excellently alongside the Golden Company, as he is a Westerosi mercenary same as many of them. 
I know a lot of the counter-argument here would be that Bronn cares for Jamie and Tyrion, but he has shown us that he is more about himself than anyone else. If the show could set it up right, having Bronn as the new face of evil in the final season would be both gut-wrenching and extremely satisfying. Just imaging Bronn maiming or killing any of the heroes, and how much it would shake things up for those final few episodes. Plus, if we want to entertain the very fun theory that [Bronn is the last of House Reyne](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/6tflas/everything_theory_what_if_bronn_is_the_last_reyne/), then it would be even more satisfying seeing him counter the Lannisters' moves on both sides, and completely destroy the characters we've seen him get to know over the years. 
Just a thought, but I really enjoy the potential. At the end of the day, we all love Bronn, and although he should've died several times at this point, watching him turn from the loveable sidekick to the greatest adversary Jamie and Tyrion have to face would be fantastic, and more in the spirit of the true twists the early seasons had to offer.",4,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I hit the part in the episode where Jaime and Tyrion are in the cell before the big fight and there is a big monologue about a cousin Orsin (guessing on the spelling) and his beetle smashing. I guess i just dont understand the significance of the story and would like to be filled in on what i missed. i figure it should be important because of how long the dialog between the two of them lasted. My first two watch throughs, I kind of chalked it up to the nervous incoherent ramblings of a man who very well may day later in the day, but that never quite sat right with me. To me it just kind of all seem pointless, and the whole thing just ends in a question. They never really explained any of it

Anyways, hopefully someone can help shed some light on the situation for me and what im missing. Thanks in advance. Also just an FYI, ive seen every episode so no need to tip toe around anything.",8,12,False,spoiler,,,,,

Why didnt the Lannisters retaliate (High Sparrow??)...? They just kind of shrugged it off and then Jaime mentioned it once at a council meeting.

I guess this is just one of those things that separates the beginning seasons and the latter. At the beginning of the show, if this event happened it would be huge news and be very important to the store.

Easily the Mountain could be talking about the first time he gets to have a big battle scene or it could be Cleganebowl. My question is how on Earth does Cleganebowl play out from where we are now: 

* Who is on trial? Obviously the Mountain will represent Cersei. 

* If it's Cersei then how would she ever end up needing to choose trial by combat for her life

* If not Cersei then how was this character captured? Who would the Hound want to fight for? 

* Is there time for all this to be played out with the WW coming? Will it be after they are defeated? 

* What will be the aftermath of the Trial (if it's a trial) will Cersei agree to death, will she agree to exonerate the character in question if the Hound wins? She isn't exactly a champion of the faith I can't see her allowing trial by combat. 

* Will it just be in open battle? What battle? Who vs Who? Where?

Classical Reception can most simply be described as how Classics (the study of Ancient Greece and Rome) is received today. My aim is to prove that GRRM and Benioff and Weiss were greatly inspired by Classics for the show. 
Some example of this that I have discovered:
Jon Snows assassination and Julius Caesars
The character of Joffrey and the Emperor Caligula
 Stannis sacrifice of Shireen and Agamemnons of Iphigenia

She goes to him and tries to get him to her side, at which she fails. But, it got me thinking, why would Cercie go to him in the first place? Oberyn loathes the Lannisters. Did she go to him so that he would try to outsmart her and become Tyrions champion? She had enough faith in the Mountain to know that he would kill Oberyn. In this way, may be somehow break the proposed marriage of Marceylla and get her back?

I'm not particularly good at violence, but I'm good at convincing others to do violence for me.*

*You want specifics, I suppose. When I was seven, I saw a servant girl bathing in the river. I stole her robe. She was forced to return to the castle naked and in tears. If I close my eyes, I can still see her tits bouncing. When I was ten, I stuffed my uncle's boots with goat shit. When confronted with my crime, I blamed a squire. Poor boy was flogged and I escaped justice.* 

*When I was twelve, I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew. I flogged the one-eyed snake. I skinned my sausage. I made the bald man cry! Into the turtle stew, which I do believe my sister ate. At least I hope she did. Once I brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel...*

That scene was hilarious, you can't tell me otherwise, I won't hear it.

Slaver: Dwarfs' cocks have magic powers
Tyrion: You can't hand out a dried cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it! He has to know it came from a dwarf, and how could he know unless he sees the dwarf

Let's say Tyrion was standing closer to where Sansa was. Do you think that he would have escaped to safety with her and Dontos, or do you think he would have stayed because he didn't want to leave his family, despite being hated by most of them? Things would have been very different for Sansa if he went with her, but i doubt he would have been too keen on going to the Vale after what he went through the last time he was there.

Before that I've always kind of struggled to believe that the army of the dead posed any threat to Westeros whatsoever. The Whitewalkers have won every fight in the show because they're fighting tired and meager forces usually caught completely off guard. What exactly was going to happen once they inevitably breached the wall? Sure Castle Black might fall, but once that happens, all of Westeros knows something is up. What were they going to expect to accomplish against a real army in the open fields south of the wall?

Jon's forces alone realistically could have dealt with the Army of the Dead with ease. Cavalry would easily outmaneuver the wights and force them into unfavourable positions and over time whittle them down with minimal losses. There would be no surprise attacks, once Jon knows where they were, the Whitewalkers were never going to lose them. Also there's a reason why the wights move so slowly while not in combat instead of at least jogging to their next destination. We see they're vulnerable to wear and tear, if they were to be running long term like eternally charging after soldiers on friggin' horses, they would get severely damaged just from trying to keep up. A broken ankle is a broken ankle, it doesn't matter if you're living or dead, you can't move with that.

Only now with the dragon factoring in do I think they're posing a threat. Even then it's not going to take a genius to figure out they need to build a big freaking scorpion to take it down. Jaime already knows the design of the exact thing they need to build too.",12,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

What if Melisandre (The Red Woman) HAD accompanied Stannis' army/navy in the Assault on King's Landing?  Could Melisandre really have tamed the Wildfire attack from Tyrion, thus enabling Stannis and his overwhelming force to easily assault and capture King's Landing.  Tyrion, Cersie, Joffery and all the other high enemies of Stannis would be captured and/or killed, Sansa would potentially be freed AND word could have gotten quickly to Robb potentially saving him soon to be murder.
However, Tyrion would no longer be able to meet with Daenerys and that could potenially at worst get our Dragon Queen killed, or at best delay her travel/assault on the 7 Kingdoms.  I don't even think I could begin to predict what this could do/affect to the White Walkers up North.

Or what if Melisandre went to the Battle of the Blackwater and FAILED to tame the Wildfire attack and end up losing her life?  Melisandre would then no longer have taken Gentry away from the Brotherhood without Banners, and Arya could possibly never become a faceless man?  Melisandre would also not be alive to heal/revive Jon Snow OR to burn Shireen or more! (like maybe that crazy king's blood magic that killed people?!?!

As my personal life is in a shambles right now, which is the lightest way I can think to describe things, I've been getting sucked into the GOT Youtube rabbit hole as a friendly distraction.

From that I keep hearing similar sentiments across the board on Season 8, plus some interesting ideas. I'd love to share my own thoughts on the grandest of all finale seasons, probably in the history of TV, and get your feedback. This may be long...

Gendry/Arya
I keep hearing a lot about the possible love connection of Gendry and Arya and I hate it!! Aryas destiny was never to settle down and be a wife. However, that is something Sansa wanted. Sansa also wanted to marry King Roberts son to becomes Queen. So what if in S08 we have the lovely reunion of Gendry and Arya but Arya introduces Gendry to Sansa, a knowing smile on her face as Gendry is blown away by Sansa. The two hit it off and finally Sansa finds herself with a decent guy and once he is made legit by Jon, Gendry is in line for the throne with his wife Sansa.

And so Cersi's prophecy of a younger, more beautiful Queen taking her crown comes true.

Ayra's End Game
While I know there is always a chance Arya could die in the final season which would be devestating if she didn't I always thought she would go off and travel like she said she wanted to. And while I still like that idea I did hear a youtuber recently mention how cool it would be to see Arya as Queens/Kings guard. With Sansa on the throne, this could happen.

The Hound/Sansa
I have read speculation of some theory the hound and Sansa will get together. I fucking hate it. But I do like the idea that in Season 8 Sansa will Knight the hound.

Bran/3ER
When I was looking back at scenes with Bran with the 3ER I noticed skulls and remains on the floor around the 3ER. Now, unless I imagined that it made me think who did those belong to. And then I thought, what if the 3ER was actually planning to level up Bran to ultimately take his life force so he could keep going? But Bran messed up when the NK got him and the shell/body of the 3ER was destroyed so now Bran is simply the shell/new younger body of the 3ER?

Melisnadre/Bran/Arya
So Mel worships the LOL and all the followers have been burning remnants of the old gods. Well, isn't Bran now technically an ""old god"". Mel has a history of burning kids and Bran can't exactly run away from her. Do you think Mel might try and sacrifice Bran in order to destroy the NK, doing what she thinks needs to be done and is this how/why Arya could end up killing her?

Jon/Daenarys
I know everyone is convinced Jon and Dany will have a baby but I hate that theory and I like to believe all the build up of suggesting it was a red herring. Aside from that I don't see the last season, of at least the main portion of it, spanning enough months to show the audience she is with child. 

Prophecy
So everyone is obviously all about the Azor Ahai/Prince(ss) who was promised prophecy and are hooked on the Nessa Nessa Lightbringer idea. I think a lot of what I know of the show/books (haven't read them but I've watched a lot about the world of ASOIAF) seems to hold a mirror up to more modern society ideas including religion. I don't think there ever really was a prophet. 
Every religion has their version of a Saviour and I think all religions in GOT have the same thing. This story of a Saviour that's bent and twisted to suit their agenda but I think it might be little more than just a tale that grew wings over time and all the extra flourishes to that take vary depending on who you align with.

Would this not be an epic teaser?
So on a long drive I started thinking about how great it would be to get some kind of trailer for the new season. And then I thought how epic it would be to show blue darkness and loads of snow. A distorted voice over plays of Sansa from S07 saying the whole ""lone wolf dies..."" Line again but as she says it a pair of red eyes open in the darkness and Ghost starts to step into view. ""But the pack survives..."" More eyes start to open in the darkness around him and then another large dire wolf (Nymeria) steps up beside him. Loads of menacing growls cut to black.

Could you imagine a fan reaction if something like that played out in a theatre?!?!

Anyway would love to hear your thoughts on my own.

I thought that over all the second season had a nice built up for the last two episodes, but out of the 8 episodes I actually cant remember loving any episode that much. 
But the last two episodes were just phenomenal. The battle between Stannis &amp; Tyrion was one of the best battles put to screen. I thought it was very similar to LOTR The Two Towers Battle of Helms Deep (though it doesnt compare to that one, since that one is the single greatest battle scene in cinema history).

The season finale wasnt as spectacular as episode 9, but it was really character driven with a lot of important plot points and decisions. 
Finally Daenerys is stepping forward, finally we get to see the White Walkers and finally a bit more Jon Snow.

I have never felt the desire to start the next season as much as in GoT.

Over all I think Season 2 is as good as Season 1. S1 was way more consistent than S2 but the highs in S2 are much higher than in S1.
It was a strong season, not without flaws and probably a great 7.5/10

And I really hope this is just the beginning. So hyped for Season 3!

so seasons 1,2 and 4 daenerys get a pass because she was ok in these seasons ig, even though i really liked her character only in season 1.

season 1 dany was very much her being her brothers sister. she did as he told, and through being married to drogo became exposed to more brutal, powerful side of life. it was through this new power that she was able to stand up to viserys, kill the witch that killed her unborn child and fucked with drogo,and inspired her to take charge in travelling to westeros and taking the iron throne.

season 2 built upon this nicely, her whole travelling to qarth, trying to find ships etc. like season 1 she was engaging because she had real troubles to deal with.

then season 3 came along. this was the first instance of the writers pushing a dany agenda too strongly down the audiences throats. she became a lot less compelling this season because instead of real hardships and challenges, she just got whatever she wanted whenever she wanted. her taking of the unsullied army was ridiculously cheesy and unrealistic, im supposed to believe that killing the guy in charge is all it takes to acquire this huge ass army, and his murder was completely justified? im supposed to believe just saying youre all free,but you can fight for me if you want is all it takes to get the entire army to fight for her truly with passion? it felt like they were trying to make a perfect leader out of her by making her go on a liberation streak (which shouldnt be the only thing a perfect ruler does obviously). what i didnt like about this was that it was just her vs nameless bad guys. nothing compelling there,and no truth there too. good and bad on both sides, yet the scenes painted her as some perfect person. as if there are no ethical dilemmas with taking these cities. now granted, this didnt bother me TOO much, this is more a criticism of how the filming and music was done in season 3 to try and paint her as some wholly good jesus-like figure. the worst part was the finale, her being held up by a bunch of former slaves whilst cheesy music plays way too much oh god. (was rewatching recently so its been really stuck in my head) that was the first of MANY cheesy scores to play during her scenes.

season 4 was actually a massive improvement, id go as far as saying i kinda liked watching her in season 4. the show finally introduced some moral dilemmas of her actions, her crucifying of the masters, drogon killing livestock and children, former slaves not liking the new life shes forced them into, it was something compelling and interesting for a change. she made some mistakes, but she listened carefully to the advice of jorah and barristan, and managed to make the right decision regarding these matters. hizdahr was a good display of how the bad guys danys been up against arent all just bad guys. there was this great quote from jorah - its tempting to see your enemies as evil,all of them. but theres good and bad on both sides of every war ever fought.
ending the season on her locking up the dragons away was nice, it showed her thinking like a ruler and it was an emotional moment. it was also through these experiences she decided to stay in meereen to improve herself as a ruler and a liberator.

season 5 comes along and shits all over this. i had high hopes that the sons of harpy would build upon her season 4 dilemmas in a way that would force her to become smarter about how she deals with people that dont support her. jorahs gone, and they kill off barristan too for some reason (well actually its d&amp;ds fault, just wont be getting into it). first thing she does in response? feeds masters to her dragons. that was a huge insult to everything barristan stood for,during the whole sons of the harpy situation he was the one pushing for fair trials, not impulsive murders. then this season she just changes as a character, she keeps having lame ass speeches like the im going to break the wheel which sounds kinda cool for the trailer, but barely carry any actual weight. and as though season 4 didnt happen, she goes back to viewing all her enemies as evil. she now hates the masters again, and even worse she now starts to genuinely perceive herself to be an all perfect ruler. when tyrion comes into town, she seems shocked when tyrion even suggests that she may not be worth his service. i dont know why, but for some reason emilia clarke decided to take an entirely different route with playing daenerys this season too. this season she just puts on this expressionless face for nearly all her scenes that arent deliberately trying to be emotional. detached me from her character a lot. she also became a lot more argumentative and irrational this season. then theres this issue with drogon. i loved the fact that as her dragons grew she could no longer control them, that felt real. but then for some reason drogon flies in, saves her and flies off with her on his back. there was just no build up on this scene so it felt flat. (but ig they went for that a pet will protect its owner when in danger.)
and the whole trying-to-touch-his-nose thing all season was so lame too. but anyway, season 5 undid all her learnings from the previous season.

up next is season 6, im really hoping itll be a redemption for dany. being captured by dothraki, im hoping for a season 3 jaime-esque redemption arc, coz in season 5 she became very entitled. too entitled. i was hoping that being a captive would bring her back to reality,and remind her of her roots with the dothraki in season 1. the dothraki are after all a good facilitator of how there is good and bad on both sides. they were good for her in season 1, but bad to others. boi could i have been further from the truth. instead shes entitled as ever, boasting about her titles to the khal [whatever his name was] in the most ridiculous scene ever.
then that scene where she burns the khals rolls around with her cringy speech. this is one of those areas that the show is deliberately not explaining. they need her to have a large army and needed to come up with some way to get her out of captivity so they killed two birds with one stone. but they know this cant stand up to scrutiny so it doesnt get any. once she simultaneously murdered all their leaders and desecrated their holy site all of the dothraki joined her.
like its that liberation of the unsullied army all over again. apparently dothraki follow strength so its fine ahhh i fucking hate that tho. and im supposed to be happy for her? fucking hell. (the biggest unanswered questions is where are the women, children, and non-fighting aged men? if dany brought them with her that makes no sense. its already nonsensical how she can provision her army, but if she has to feed an even larger amount of civilians as well its beyond absurd. but if she left the civilians in essos, then that means she managed to convince all the men to abandon their families to certain enslavement since they would be completely defenseless.)
so she finally gets back to meereen with her army, and how do we see dany deal with this threat to revolt in her city? she unleashes the dothraki horde to kill them all. real nice. and ofc theres all happy music and d&amp;d are like yeah be happy! isnt this awesome? shes solving the situation.

but even tho season 5 had faults it at least acknowledged that the sons of the harpy couldnt be dealt with just sheer violence. you cant kill ideas, killing all those people shouldnt have done shit, if anything it wouldve made things even worse. not to mention the dothraki are savages. but yet were supposed to watch that and think wow isnt dany great?. bullshit, that wasnt a thing a great ruler would do. she learned absolutely nothing from her time with the dothraki, and absolutely nothing more about ruling. and for some reason all the dragons that she had massive problems with are all perfectly tame now? they do exactly as she wants them to do because .. reasons? (i think i actually mentioned some cringy ass excuse somewhere in this rant already) perfect. it just felt like more and more shit getting handed to her because its convenient for the plot. but theres nothing compelling about that. why would i want to watch the adventures of someone that just gets whatever they want with no consequences? a good example of the no consequences situation would also be the fact that they killed off tommen just so that danny wouldnt have the moral dilemma of having to overthrow a child, d&amp;d will really do anything for her, wont they? it pisses me off. i dont want to watch her vs just bad guys. i used to be excited at the prospect of her travelling to westeros because i acknowledged it would be her versus other good people for a change, but the show just went and fucked all that didnt it? guess they couldnt risk dany looking bad in any sort of way. itll be the same with cersei if she does give birth to her new child. shell spare her or theyre just gonna have cersei miscarry the child.
so yeah for some reason at the end of the season 6 shes like im ready now, im totally a competent ruler now yet she showed no evidence of having learned anything. if anything she became worse.

another thing to add to season 6 is that yeah of course the season ends on her getting greyjoy support, tyrell support and dornish support. as if she wasnt overpowered enough already. i seriously dont understand why they think we wanna see some overpowered person just get the support they need easy peasy. no controversy? the closest we got to controversy tbf was randyll and dickons death in season 7. i liked that they put tyrion and dany on the spot.

season 7 rocks about and shes now pushing this narrative that shes taking the 7 kingdoms because she wants to help the people. are you fucking kidding me? if you cared about people youd have stayed in essos and ensured slavery actually ended. you wanna fight oppression? theres your oppression. but i guess if she just admitted she was there to conquer it would make her look bad? well done d&amp;d. this season shes just portrayed as the perfect person that believes everything she does is right and moral, when it isnt. she justifies everything because she just thinks everyone thats against her is evil. that annoys me. and to build onto to what i was saying about her in season 5, emilia clarkes acting has just gone for some reason. like i believe she can act, but its like she chooses not to in these later seasons and its so frustrating to watch. or maybe its just d&amp;ds fault, theyre giving her the instructions on how to portray her character (? man why am i trying to defend her). but yeah overall i just cant stand d&amp;d trying to make everything super easy for her, painting everyone thats against her as evil and her as always justified, her long cringey speeches, and her sense of entitlement. you didnt see seasons 1-4 dany saying shed take the 7 kingdoms in order to help the people i mean come on. shes just lost all the compelling traits and it sucks. to be perfectly honest i just see her now as catfood for feminists. shes supposedly perfect, shes supposedly powerful, she talks some smack, and she makes speeches. all without the grit that makes a character interesting. yet somehow she gets shitload of screentime. oh right d&amp;d we get it, shes yo fav.


i defo rambled on here, so sorry if thats not really a coherent argument. it just annoys me how wrong they went with her arc after season 4 ended. like game of thrones wasnt all about people just fighting bad guys and getting what they want. it was about real conflict where there are no easy choices. real conflict where your enemies arent just evil, and you have to question the morality of your own actions. real conflict usually for power. all of these themes have been stripped from danys story and it sucks dicks. they cant even keep the power aspect since its now just her taking over the westeros to benefit the people of westeros.


i just thought of another reason, but for me daenerys story is the epitome of what i dont like about what the show has become. lack of complexity,lack of scheming,generic good vs evil,lack of emotional moments,plot armour,lack of moral conflict,cheese/cliche tropes,forced quotable lines (i swear half her speeches are just so they can have cool sounding words to put in trailers),too much magic, too many ex machinas. these are all things i find popping up in her story more than anyone elses, which ofc plays a big part of why i dont like watching her character on the show. i do believe her story didnt always suffer from these disadvantages,alas that is not the case anymore.

Waymar Royce is described to be tall, slender and graceful, dark haired and having beautiful grey eyes. Thats exactly how Jon Snow is described in the books, the only difference is that when Sansa fell in love with Waymar he was a young men of 19 and Jon at the time was just a boy of 14, by the time Sansa meet Jon again in the books he will be 18 or 19 and will look a lot like Waymar Royce, her first love. 
  

'

&gt;**He was a handsome youth of eighteen, grey-eyed and graceful and slender as a knife.** Mounted on his huge black destrier, the knight towered above Will and Gared on their smaller garrons. He wore black leather boots, black woolen pants, black moleskin gloves, and a fine supple coat of gleaming black ringmail over layers of black wool and boiled leather. 

- A Game of Thrones Prologue

&gt;**Jon's eyes were a grey so dark they seemed almost black**, but there was little they did not see. He was of an age with Robb, but they did not look alike. **Jon was slender where Robb was muscular, dark where Robb was fair, graceful and quick where his half brother was strong and fast.** 

- A Game of Thrones Bran I
 
'
'

  
More foreshadows:
 
 
&gt;He would father no sons who might someday contest with Catelyn's own grandchildren for Winterfell. (AGOT Catelyn II).

Lady Catelyn celebrating Jon Snow going to the wall. I am pretty sure Jon Snow sons will be her grandchildren. Again, the first time I read this quote, it just screamed foreshadow for me.
 
'
'

&gt;You, Ned said, kissing her lightly on the brow, will marry a king and rule his castle, and your sons will be knights and princes and lords and, yes, perhaps even a High Septon. Arya screwed up her face. **""No,"" she said, ""that's Sansa.""** 

Arya, AGoT
 
This one is  actually pretty straight foward. 

'
'
  
&gt;Sweet one, her father said gently, listen to me. When youre old enough, I will make you a match with a high lord whos worthy of you, someone brave and gentle and strong. This match with Joffrey was a terrible mistake. **That boy is no Prince Aemon, you must believe me.** -

 (SANSA, AGoT)
 

&gt;She shouted for Ser Dontos, for her brothers, for her dead father and her dead wolf, for gallant Ser Loras who had given her a red rose once, but none of them came. She called for the heroes from the songs, **for Florian and Ser Ryam Redwyne and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight, but no one heard.** 

(SANSA, ACOK)
 
&gt;They were not little boys when they fought, but knights and mighty heroes. **Im Prince Aemon the Dragonknight, Jon would call out,** and Robb would shout back, Well, Im Florian the Fool. Or Robb would say, Im the Young Dragon, and Jon would reply, **Im Ser Ryam Redwyne.** 

(JON, ASOS)

'

  
Notice how Sansa's heros match with with the ones Jon's used to pretend to be as a child. 
  
'


 
&gt;Ive never lain with any woman but Cersei. In my own way, Ive been truer than your Ned ever was. Poor old dead Ned. So who has shit for honor now, I ask you? **What was the name of that bastard he fathered?** Catelyn took a step backwards. Brienne.

&gt;**No, that wasnt it.** Jaime Lannister upended the flagon. A trickled ran down onto his face, bright as blood. **Snow, that was the one. Such a white name  like the pretty cloaks they give us in the Kingsguard when we swear our pretty oaths.**

A Clash of Kings - Catelyn VII

&gt;When she crawled out of bed, long moments later, she was alone. She found his cloak on the floor, twisted up tight, **the white wool stained with blood and fire.** The sky outside was darker by then, with only a few pale green ghosts dancing against the stars. A chill wind was blowing, banging the shutters. Sansa was cold. **She shook out the torn cloak and huddled beneath it on the floor, shivering.** 

A Clash of Kings - Sansa VII
  
Sansa cloaked herself with a cloak stained in ""Fire and Blood""
 
&gt;Frog-faced Lord Slynt sat at the end of the council table wearing a black velvet doublet and a shiny cloth-of-gold cape, nodding with approval every time the king pronounced a sentence. Sansa stared hard at his ugly face, remembering how he had thrown down her father for Ser Ilyn to behead, wishing she could hurt him, wishing that some hero would throw him down and cut off his head. But a voice inside her whispered, **There are no heroes** 

- Sansa ACoK
-
&gt;I will not hang him, said Jon. Bring him here. Oh, Seven save us, he heard Bowen Marsh cry out. The smile that Lord Janos Slynt smiled then had all the sweetness of rancid butter. **Until Jon said, Edd, fetch me a block, and unsheathed Longclaw.**

Jon - ASoS
 

'


 &gt;In Sansas dreams, her children looked just like the brothers she had lost. Sometimes there was even a girlwho looked like Arya.

 - Sansa ASoS

Arya is the only sibling that looks like Jon Snow. How interesting.

'
'
 
 
When Sansa was in the Vale and her aunt Lysa was trying to push the idea of her marrying her son, the sick Robin Arryn, of course she knows that Lysa doesnt care about her, and only wants Winterfell. In the end of that chapter, where she is receiving a marriage proposal to marry her COUSIN, she laments:
 
""Its not me she wants, its my claim, No one will ever marry me for love"" (Sansa, ASOS)
 
[The very next chapter of the book? JON](https://78.media.tumblr.com/8a1398e38b36e06629af1d3ae3a808ba/tumblr_inline_ozqhnwM0m41uko8lz_500.jpg). Again, thats not a coincidence, George does this, he said that he takes a lot of planning and caring about the way he writes and structures his books. 

As I have been telling you for the past years, those two will marry for love in season 8.

I dont think the color matches, it looks like there is a lot of brown around his pupil at 3:55 but at 56:24 they are pure grey. Also at 3:55 there is some pigment dispersion at about the 5 o'clock position on his iris and his sclera is really veiny (which makes sense for someone that has been stressed out in a dungeon).

Is it possible for the NK to be a Targaryan?

Here's why I ask. The NK took down 1 Dragon with ample opportunity to take down more. Now if the NK saw Dany as a threat couldn't he have taken her out easily? Also, if he saw Jon Snow as a threat, didn't he have ample opportunities to take him out too? Even when Jon fell through the ice there was no effort made to kill him.

Now let's say the NK was Targaryan related somehow and actually believed in the ""Dragon has 3 heads"" prophecy. Could that be why he took 1 Dragon for himself and has never gone out of his way to destroy the other 2, Jon or Dany when given the chance. 

Is there anyway that his onslaught has been a result of not only the dragons coming back but also knowledge of Dany and Jon. Is it possible that the reason he wanted to stop Bran / the 3ER was to stop them realising/telling Jon who he really is.

Given the prophet/hero Azor Ahai is this figure that exists in the lore of every religion in some way (e.g The last hero) is it possible the NK also believes that he/his people have a promised one who is destined to save/be the hero for his kind? And maybe his aim is to infiltrate Jon's mind in some way before Bran has a chance to... 

Is this just a Sunday roast level of tinfoil or is there any grain of feasibility in this idea?",32,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

As far as I know lightbringer was used in the age of heroes to defeat the long night, what if that sword survived, and was kept in the stark family.

Now the big fallacy in this theory is that Valyrian Steel swords were introduced by, well the Valyrians who invaded Westeros a long time after the long night.

But what if Ice wasn't lightbringer until combined with Dragon Fire and maybe dragon glass to become Lightbringer, in which sense it would literally be a story of Ice and Fire. Now that Ice has been melted and is now in the form of 2 swords, one wielded by Brienne and I believe the other wielded by Jaime. This would help support the 2 ""prince that was promised "" theories.

Although this point might be a bit farfetched swordmaking has sometimes been describing as making a blade sing, which would be interesting to see that Ice was a song of Ice and Fire, Ice the blade and fire (dragonfire and dragonglass).",16,10,False,spoiler,,,,,

The whole Daenerys vs Cercei war is fine, but I think the meeting does not make any sense. Why would Tyrion and Daenerys even think of trusting Cercei? It seems so obvious that whatever Cercei would say, you couldn't trust it. Based on this assesment, what is the point of this meeting? And considering that, there's no way going beyond the wall is worth it, because ""showing it"" to Cercei is absolutely pointless.

In the end it did convince Jaime, which might end up being huge, but that wasn't even the plan. Also I was wondering if Tyrion really believes Cercei changed her mind, is he playing her, or did he straight up betray Daenerys to save House Lannister?",10,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Im pretty sure this is exactly GRRMs diabolical plan though:

Step 1:  Establish a dense and intricate foundation without any definitive direction.  Enough to get people hooked, but not enough to reveal anything that would jeopardize giving too much away.  

Step 2:  Start over with a movie/TV series to reignite interest and capture a wider pop culture base.  

Step 3:  Now that theres sufficient intrigue, let the fans speculate wildly.  All the while keeping a close ear to the fan sites and message boards.  

Step 4:  Cherry pick the best fan theories to incorporate into future material.  This serves two purposes.  First, it injects new material that the author himself may not have been thinking due to his own preconceptions.  Second, it gives the fans a sense of fulfillment by seeing their predictions come true.  Essentially its a choose your own adventure over a larger scale. 

Step 5:  Finish the series in the movie/TV format first so that you can subsequently release the remaining books, effective prolonging the gravy train even longer.  

Step 6:  Profit?

Im sure Im not the first to come to this realization, but it really makes you think about how the story has unfolded and just how much of this was preconceived vs written in to meet fan demand.

Because the fakeout scenes they're doing are likely plausible for the point we're at in the story rather than being absolutely nuts. 

They should bring back Fairley and shoot some Lady Stoneheart scenes from the book, leak it out and then get a nice, tall glass of iced tea and wait for the outrage when the episodes actually drop and those scenes ain't in any of 'em. 

Leak a scene where Jamie kills Bronn because he's thinking he's making a move romantically on Cersei.

However as a fan I wasnt thrilled with Season 7 of the story. It was at best mediocre in my opinion in comparison the previous seasons and storylines. Now I cant help but see theres Team Winterfell, Team Daenerys, Team Cersei and team Night king. However the story's black and white. Fire and ice. Good and bad. I struggle to see the grey, the water, neutral caught in between. And the main conflict in the story? A non talking ice man, who turns babies into weaker versions of himself and raises zombies.

Although ""hardhome"" was terrifying to watch, I didnt really care in ""Beyond the Wall"". I knew Jon, Gendry, Jorah, Berric and Hound wouldnt die. Plot armour. U want zombies to actually matter? BOOM wight ice dragon (that breaths fire? Wights main weakness) but its okay. Viserion wasnt even named till season 7, and Tyrion got a scene mostly focused on Rhaegal so Viserion got his moment. Before the end. 

I dont feel any attachment to these undead, only the NK and viserion(not as much as jon, dany or cersei). We are goin to see an army, of non scentiet dead people die....theyve no names. I give them all as much thought as the wildings that died in S7 e6.  Remember them? Tripped on ice and ripped to pieces by the horde..... with on guts splatter......so original for zombies. So really its emotional the fight to kill the Nk and viserion.
 
Of course itll be amazing. Drogon and Rhaegal v A dragon that wont feel pain and will not stop till they tear him to shreds, or he takes dem or dany with him. Still hoping tyrion is who rhaegal chooses After the pyramid. Maybe they even manage to throw or force him into a weirwood tree and he deactivates. Or mad queen cersei blows up Kings Landing but drogon and rhaegal break his wings off and he plummets into the Wildfire(dragging a brother and rider with him?). Im a sucker for dragons because of the AMAZING cgi.

Then NK v Jon. Maybe Arya, Jamie,Brienne and sam too. Because the valyrian steel. I dont hate the night king. To me, hes a just, there. He watches the wights kill all. All hes done is turn a baby, kill bloodraven, viserion and broke the wall into chunks. Compare this list to Cersei's deeds. Now jofferey. The Waif. And even daenerys. These are grey characters(i count the waif because we dont even know her  name, origin or motivations) the Nk. He kills and raises the dead. Emphasise on raise the dead. 

If hes the focus of season 8 (as many theorise)what will he do? Fly around, not speak and just mockingly raise his hands.  If i wanted this id watch Walking dead. Yes theres a zombie dragon and giants......its just drogon v lannisters in reverse and Wun Wun's fights again.  I just know cersei can up the stakes so much more. Hell daenerys could decide to DRACARYS everyone. i hope this long wait is a pay off. Can any explain to me why the dead are getting so much focus other than ""writers want money and zombie dragons sell"" or the 7 kingdoms arnt united?

Well, when Jamie is convincing Randyll Tarley to fight with the Lannisters, he says When the war is won, Cercei will need a new Warden of the South. I can think of no better man than yourself. And the immediate next scene is a cut to Sam Tarleys face. I think this, along with the fact that Sam has Heartsbane (the Tarly ancestral Valyrian steel sword), is some pretty convincing evidence that when all is said and done, Sam is going to be the Warden of the South.

It's excellent and it's basically  the first season of the show. The main differences I've noticed are in  the dream sequences which are amazing and the battles that occur at  River Run and Whispering Wood. I'm guessing the show simply didn't have  the budget for it but they were really intense fights. But while the  overall differences were small, often times small things in this story  can be of great importance later on.

A lot of things just beg for  answers I don't have.

The difference in the Night's Watch vow between  the books and show is rather telling. ""I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men.""  

Dany's memory of a house with a big red door and a  lemon tree is also interesting. I heard a theory once that said this is proof that Dany isn't who she thinks she is. She's a princess of Dorne. The big red door is something you find in the water gardens and the palace there. Lemons can only be found in part of Westeros:  Dorne. I don't buy it but it's interesting.

The vision Dany sees of a great wolf and a man wreathed in  flame when she's carried into Khal Drogo's tent when the witch, Mirri  Maz Duur, performs the ritual that kills Dany's unborn son but saves  Drogo's life stuck in my head the moment I read it. Now the man wreathed in flame, sounds like a depiction of the Lord of Light. I don't know who or what the wolf refers to. 

The absence of Jeor Mormont's crow in the show now bothers me. ""Corn, corn, corn.""  ""Don't listen to his lies, I just fed him."" This one will be interesting in future books for sure. 

The difference  between ravens and crows as it pertains to the Great Other. I've heard this theory before and holy shit, there's something to this one. In the book it talks about the two as brothers but it definitely assigns a strong negative connotation to crows. They seem to tie in with the presence of evil. Even in Bran's falling dream it's a three eyed crow, not a raven. And it's not his friend either. It tries to kill him when Bran succeeds in flying. 

Why Hodor didn't want to go into the Winterfell crypts  and what was waiting for Bran down there ties into the idea of the crow as the enemy and even a stand in the for the Great Other. The crypts of Winterfell themselves are much more interesting and potentially ominous in the books. 

 Cersei's speculates to Ned that Jon was the son of Ned and  Ashara Dayne before delivering the infamous line:  ""when you play the game of thrones, you win or you die.""

Dany's promise to Ser Jorah for a valyrian steel sword  before she stepped onto Drogo's funeral pyre. 

It's all fascinating stuff. Anyway, on to book two.",8,6,False,spoiler,,,,,

Season 7 did indeed fall short on all of those, but once the hype of the season died down and I rewatched the entire show from the beginning, I came to appreciate season 7 for what it is.

GOT is one of those shows that simply can't be separated by seasons. It's a whole and you have to watch every episode for all of it to make sense. The characters have been growing since the start of the first season, some have grown into better people, and some haven't, and that's fine. We know what their motivations are, we know what most of them want at this point and the story is coming to its end, which is why I think this season has largely been a 'calm before storm' moment of the show.

Was this season action packed? Yes, it most definitely was. And there were moments which might seem as far away from calm as possible, but looking at the season as a whole, it seems to me it's nothing more but an intro into the end of the show.

We have been with most of these characters for 7 seasons, some a bit less, and we have gotten to know most of the major players well. The truth is, there really wasn't much character development in this season, nor were the political tones as good as before, but everything is coming to an end. Every major character's motives are clear at this point and most allegiances are well known. There was no need to delve into the politics any more. 

At the end of the day, season 7 is not perfect. But it's my opinion that it did a good thing with setting the stage for the end of the show.",639,1593,False,spoiler,,,,,

This is especially because  Sandor has undergone quite a bit of change from his previously merciless nature while maintaining his loveably pessimistic views and constant insults, and Arya has become quite the fearsome fighter herself. 

Season 4 is by far my favourite season with one of the big reasons being the development of their adventures together, culminating in the fight against Brienne which I thought was the best choreographed fight scene in the entire series.

Almost all theories suggest that Bran the Builder is the good guy and he built the wall. All these details remain shady.

GRRM proclaims that there are grey shades in people and that he likes to play around in these areas (like Vietnam war where America seen as the good guy. But GRRM thinks otherwise). Given his take on things, I'm curious how could one say that Bran the builder was actually ONLY good.

History is written by the Victors - Winston Churchill

So my theory is on the context of Bran the Builder being the main antagonist. Bran the builder is the king in the north, his brother( who later became Azor Ahai) and the children of forest fight a battle against the first White walkers and night king. The former win with the help of Azor Ahai(with certain help from Nissa Nissa. As a result Nissa Nissa becomes night queen). Azor Ahai's popularity increases as he is the ""one"" who defeats the first white walkers, and as a result there is a power struggle between the brothers. Since he is also heir to the throne, Bran the builder captures Nissa Nissa. In order to release her, his brother signs a pact with Bran the builder, children of forest where he is converted to Night King. He and remaining white walkers help construct the wall( that separates men and others). Men to the south of the wall, Night king(his lady love) and others to the other side of the wall(There is no way THAT wall could have been constructed by only men). At this time Men and children of forest sign a secret pact of not letting go of the night queen and banishing the night king to the north of the wall. Children of forest have their own reasoning(to avoid the cause of previous war). So once the wall has been built, the men does not release the night queen, banish the night king and others(mostly males) to the north of wall. After this episode, Bran the builder destroys all the records of the Night King, creates evil stories of him.

Night King is rightfully annoyed with both men and children of forest. He slowly builds his army. He knows he cannot destroy the wall with his army. Patiently waits for his time.   
And his time does come. Just like any other Stark, he can look into the future, he can warg into people.

1440,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-7-19,2018,7,19,3,8zy98x,self.gameofthrones,[SPOILERS]Game of Thrones Season 8 - Night King Theory!,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8zy98x/spoilersgame_of_thrones_season_8_night_king_theory/,mani3887,1531939781," Most theories and predictions are in the pretext of Night King being the bad guy while the men being Good. Almost all theories suggest that Bran the Builder is the good guy and he built the wall. All these details remain shady.

GRRM proclaims that there are grey shades in people and that he likes to play around in these areas (like Vietnam war where America seen as the good guy. But GRRM thinks otherwise). Given his take on things, I'm curious how could one say that Bran the builder was actually ONLY good.

History is written by the Victors - Winston Churchill

So my theory is on the context of Bran the Builder being the main antagonist. Bran the builder is the king in the north, his brother( who later became Azor Ahai) and the children of forest fight a battle against the first White walkers and night king. The former win with the help of Azor Ahai(with certain help from Nissa Nissa. As a result Nissa Nissa becomes night queen). Azor Ahai's popularity increases as he is the ""one"" who defeats the first white walkers, and as a result there is a power struggle between the brothers. Since he is also heir to the throne, Bran the builder captures Nissa Nissa. In order to release her, his brother signs a pact with Bran the builder, children of forest where he is converted to Night King. He and remaining white walkers help construct the wall( that separates men and others). Men to the south of the wall, Night king(his lady love) and others to the other side of the wall(There is no way THAT wall could have been constructed by only men). At this time Men and children of forest sign a secret pact of not letting go of the night queen and banishing the night king to the north of the wall. Children of forest have their own reasoning(to avoid the cause of previous war). So once the wall has been built, the men does not release the night queen, banish the night king and others(mostly males) to the north of wall. After this episode, Bran the builder destroys all the records of the Night King, creates evil stories of him.

Night King is rightfully annoyed with both men and children of forest. He slowly builds his army. He knows he cannot destroy the wall with his army. Patiently waits for his time.  
And his time does come. Just like any other Stark, he can look into the future, he can warg into people. Around the Mad King time, he foresees the creation of dragons(which can be used to destroy the wall). He wargs into Aerys II Targaryen( Mad King-making him Mad), that eventually results in him being overthrown, causing his children to flee and subsequently create dragons. Around the same time, he creates his army in full force, creates the white walkers. It looks like he can warg into Targaryens. I feel it was he who warg-ed into Daenerys Targaryen creating a memory in Kings Landing.

Night King's army mostly attacks the soldiers only. Bran is the re-incarnation of Bran the builder which is why Night King is trying to get close with Bran. In this battle neither team/army is ""good"" nor ""bad"". The present Men know nothing of night king's horrific history.",13,9,False,spoiler,,,,,

Normally, I am a real ""smart-ass"", you know. If somebody tells me something is great, I want to watch it and say it's not (I'm a monster lol) and with Game of Thrones being arguably the most popular and beloved TV show of all time, I didn't actually expect that much. But sometimes the mainstream audience opinion is right - and this is the case with Game of Thrones. Here are some of my thoughts on the first three seasons:

(some fundamental) PRO's:  


I absolutely love the intro. The music and the visuals are so beautiful and draining, and it also really welcomes you into the world of Westeros, as you have a nice and stylish overview of the map. The World of Westeros is a really interesting fantasy, since visually it reminds me of the Middle Ages, but in it's characters and themes, is way more of a hedonistic (sex &amp; violence + gods) Ancient Greek world - which again, I find compelling. 

In the beginning, I actually expected something else from Game of Thrones; I expected a fantasy story with a lot of battle scenes and destruction and sword fights and so on, but I really came to appreciate at how well thought and intelligent the scripts were. Basically the first season is a political thriller in it's themes.

I think the over all ensemble and huge cast can lead to some confusion for some, but over all I have the impression that building a complex storyline is way more important than that. And of course, the ensemble delivers. I feel like some of these actors were born to play these characters. Like Peter Dinklage for Tyrion. His comedic timing, sense of humor and dialogue is fascinating. I also have to give a huge shoutout to Joeffrey, who has easily become my most hated TV character since (??) ever? 

I think GoT balances the multiple storylines and characters perfectly and I never feel like I'm seeing too much or too less of a characters, although there are so many. What I really loved were the different character archetypes that were built throughout the story, I mean look at the first episode, seeing the whole Stark family in Winterfell. And now look at the last episode of Season 3. Ned, Robb, Caitlyn dead; Sansa married to a Lannister, Arya somewhere with the big guy, and the two boys want to get themselves killed by walking towards the wall. It's such fantastic storytelling if you really think about it and it makes every step or decision leading up to this feel important and essential.

Now onto some things that bothered me a bit (CON's):  


The main reason I started watching Game of Thrones was because of Emilia Clarke. Now, Daenerys Targaryen is a very compelling character and it's really great seeing her rise in these three seasons. BUT as far as things go, there are basically two big storylines - the battle of the throne in Westeros, and Daenerys journey. After watching 30 hours of this show, it feels a little bit unsatisfying to not have these to storylines intertwined. I know, it's probably for the good of storytelling, to built all of this and have a huge culmination, but still I feel myself kind of empty. 

The comparably slow narration is really something I have to accustom for myself. The same thing for the White Walkers. They have been teased and built so many times and thankfully been portrayed as a huge threat, but it still leaves me kind of empty knowing that their screen time was about 5 minutes in 30 hours. 

Now, to some obligatory ""rankings"" or numbers stuff.

My favorite characters so far are Daenerys (because of Emilia Clarke), Jon Snow (because I can really understand and relate to him) and Tyrion Lannister (because Peter Dinklage is such a fantastic actor). But I also really liked Lord Baelish and Robb Stark.

Though many people can of course compare Game of Thrones to The Lord of The Rings (a really unnecessary comparison that even if GoT would ""lose""), I just don't think the over all theme and storyline are matching each other. While LoTR is the epitome of a ""good v/ evil"" storyline, Game of Thrones is way more than that. Although you really do hate the Lannisters, you still can understand them as human beings (hell, Jaime made a 180 degree turn while he was imprisoned) and with multiple ""groups"" of people, like also Daenerys in the future and the threat of the white walkers, the show has so many layers that it's impossible to refer to it as a ""good v/ evil"" show.

  
Which episodes did I find extremely memorable/great/(maybe)rewatchable?

I really enjoyed the season finale of Season One ""Fire and Blood"". The ending shot with a beautiful (and hella naked) Emilia Clarke holding three beautiful CGI dragons was a thing of, well, beauty. 

Then, of course the amazing battle scene (which reminded me of Helm's Deep) ""Blackwater"", which featured some amazing choreography and battle sequences and so much pathos in it. 

""The Rains of Castamere"" have become a standard when it comes down to taking about great episodes (or at least I think it should be), because well it's an emotionally challenging and heartbreaking episode and something I would have never seen coming.

But, If I really had to point out what my favorite episode is it would be ""Mhysa""; The season 3 finale. It sets up so many storylines for the future and does so much right for its characters, relationships and twists that it's a great episode even without featuring a huge decision or big battle scene.

If I had to rate the seasons (on lets say some platform like imdb) I would go 7.5-8.0/10 for both season one and two, and about 8.0-9.0/10 for season three. But you know, at the end of the day numbers really mean nothing. So far, I have seen about 40% of the show ( at least I think so) and there's is still a lot to happen which might influence my opinion on the first 3 seasons.

At the end of the day, I feel like I'm only fully going to appreciate Game of Thrones as an all time great TV show if I watch all seasons and everything. And that's exactly what I am going to do :)",24,12,False,spoiler,,,,,

Over the years since its inception many parallels have been drawn between Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones, and by that I mean it's been brought up hundreds of times how the two are different. 

Now listen up, George R.R. Martin has often stated how he took inspirations from Lord of the Rings (mainly a plot driven story) to write Game of thrones (which is mainly a character driving story). While GoT is a story often said to not have the black and white, the good and evil, the Lucifer and Micheal, whereas LotR definitely has those aspects when depicting their main villains. 
I believe paralells can and will be drawn between GoT and LotR mainly in plot points rather than actually being similarly written. By that I mean GoT's events, especially in season 8 could see some inspirations from LotR, not in the ""black and white"" theme but rather in the actual plot points. 

LotR also features an army of the dead, which can be led by Aragorn because he is the one true king and possesses king's blood. 

Now GoT already emphasizes the power of king's blood over and over again. I think the main power from king's blood comes from 2 sources, 1 being dragons. All the characters that have been told they had king's blood have had Valyrian blood. What are Valyrians known for? Dragons and their proximity to them. I'm assuming the proximity to dragon's fuels the Valyrians blood with magic. The Baratheons were related to Valyrians and obviously all the targaryans. 

This leads me to my second point, the second form of ""King's blood"" or magical blood. The blood of the Children of the Forest. While interbreeding is said to have happen I believe that the Starks ancestors were both CotF and First Men making their blood special/magical which can be seen in the Warging abilities. 

A third form of magical being can be seen in the form of the White Walkers, but I believe they fall under category 2 of being imbued with the Childrens blood. 

Now we come to the good stuff as I'm sure you know a big part of what I described earlier. The continent/region where Valyria used to be is no more, however, a religion formed in those regions that worhship the Lord of Light, a religion based on Fire. Now Melisandre often describes dragons as Fire made Flesh, whereas other people would describe dragons as Magic made flesh. 

Where is the difference you ask?
Well what if there were 2 types of magic, two big sides like in LotR after all, just this time the intentions of both sides are rather grey. ""but the white walker's intentions seem rather gray with all the undead and stuff"". It seems to me that the magic the White Walkers use is on the side of the Starks, the ice magic side, which makes this story rather complicated and grey because Jon is both a Targaryan and a Stark, ice and fire, two opposing sides on a compass. 

So we got Valyria and Valyrians on the fire side along with the Lord of Light, while we got Starks, CotF, and the White Walkers/NK on the ice side. 
I believe in the past a treaty was made with the ""Others"" to keep them north of the wall in return for something rather big which could be a plethora of things, some said the possibility of a night queen in Winterfell or any other factor.

However, I have a different version of what happened in accordance to the LotR ""similarity"" in that GoT is the opposite. See in LotR the big bad evil guy Morgoth got completely annihilated and banished into some sort of other realm at the end of ""the long night but LotR version"" (very very shortened version of events cause yeah). I think the first Long Night in GoT played out differently, the WW were obviously winning (cause what could stop them? No dragons, just people and tree kids). I think Azor Ahai was a Stark or their ancestor with a different name and he wins against the king of the White Walkers in single combat, but in doing so he becomes the new Night King when he chooses to leave and go beyond the wall. This would lead some credence to the ""King's of Winter"" theory because Bran the Builder could've been the new NK's ""King"" giving him the literal title of King's of Winter. 

The White Walkers are every bit of Servants of Winter as the priests of Rhollor are the Servants of Fire. The religion of the Lord of Light is complete opposite to the White Walkers and as we've seen in the show are capable of some quite gruesome things. 

Which brings me to my point, the Lord of Light is very real and he is the opposite of the Night King, now idk if we'll ever see a physical manifestation of the Lord of Light, if we havn't already but his forces and the Night King are about to collide. I think his priests will be major players as they are the equivalent to the White Walkers as the lord of light is the equivalent to the force that controls the NK, the force/magic the CotF believed in. I believe however, that the magic of the LoL is from dragons themselves whereas the White Walkers power originates from the piece of Dragon Glass in the NK's heart. Now I believe the origin of the magic isn't itself in the dragon glass as that would suggest that all magic comes from dragon fire which is a theory for another day. 

Since the magic of the LoL originates from Dragons, that means once all the Dragon's are dead so is the LoL's magic, which means his wights will die just like the NK's wights will die when he is destroyed. That includes Beric and Jon. 

End Game
I think Jon will die, but not before making a final sacrifice which includes stabbing a poor Dragon in the heart in order for his sword to fully be imbued with the magic of fire to destroy the NK. The thing is while I believe Jon is Azor Ahai I think this will break the circle as he is both ice and fire at heart, he won't turn into the next NK like his predecessor, this war is to end the cycle afterall.

Qhono is [shown](https://imgur.com/yzhXRcN) overseeing the attack from a hilltop with Tyrion. He comments that [Tyrions] people cant fight, as the Dothraki Screamers are shown slaughtering the Lannister troops from a distance. 

We then see Qhono [again](https://imgur.com/jiGKnuJ), pretty much immediately after Dany has landed back on Dragonstone from the aforementioned attack in The Reach. Hes escorting Jorah to meet Dany on the cliff.

Clearly Qhono got back to Dragonstone before Dany did. This is odd, considering Dany presumably has the fastest mode of transport (dragons), and she only brings Drogonnot Rhaegal or Viserionto the attack in The Reach. Qhono is not shown riding Drogonor any of the dragonsat any point, so its safe to assume he traveled by land and ship with the rest of the Dothraki.

It makes sense how the Dothraki are able to get to The Reach from Dragonstone, I have no qualms with that. Whats not making sense to me is the mysterious, seemingly teleportation-enabled Qhono, whos able to travel from the Southwestern region of Westeros to an island off the Eastern coast of Westeros by land and sea, faster than a dragon traveling (presumably) in a straight line in the air.

I have no sympathy for her, whatsoever. I don't give a rat's ass about the circumstances of her death, she was a murderess and even if she was flayed by Ramsay Bolton I still wouldn't feel bad for her. A silly little ""star-crossed lovers"" routine doesn't make me feel sympathy for a murderess.

I think Olly was annoying, though, because he was a dues ex machina character, felt very forced in the plot and then did the betrayal, but Olly killing Ygritte was definitely the highlight of his character, by a longshot. If you want to hate him for those reasons, go right ahead, but Olly killing a person who shot his father in the back is 100% justified, and you'd have to be insane to argue otherwise.",72,12,False,spoiler,,,,,

I have a pretty detailed theory as to what will occur in Season 8, which I may post later, but I think the final battle will take place near the twins in the neck.  I think the white walkers will overrun Winterfell and White Harbor and push towards the twins.  Cersei will bring her armies to the Twins as well in an attempt to trap the Northern allies between the White Walkers and her armies, not knowing that the Northern Armies are escaping towards Graywater Watch and then moving towards Cape Kraken.

Now with Cersei defending the Twins, the Northern Armies realize this is their one chance to pin the Walkers between themselves and Cersei and prepare to attack.  At this point the Golden Company with Euron Greyjoy will land in Cape Kraken, effectively pinning the Northern Armies and Walkers between Cersei and Euron.

I also love pursuing hypotheticals pertaining to his world. I actually think I would've enjoyed the story more if things in Kings Landing developed differently, and the following happened. 

- A power vacuum emerges where people vie for power through Tommen, only it's far more stressed. For example, most of the Tyrell's stay in King's Landing and essentially dominate the throne. 
- Cersei relies on the faith militant and ends up blowing up the sept of Baelor 
- Tommen commits suicide 
- Jamie kill Cersei for driving their son to suicide and for killing all those innocent people (this would be a really cool end to his redemption arc). If he poisoned their wine and they both slept together and then died, that would've been cool. 
- King's Landing is basically left without a ruler, and Daenery's is virtually welcomed in and praised, since the years of ""Baratheon"" rule were considered horrible. 
- The whole thing would be a fitting end to Lannister rule, shows how such a foul and corrupted family basically combusted. 
- Also adding in some background to beef up the whole sequences. Like Vary's partakes in the plotting of self-destructing the capital, to make it easier for Daenerys when she lands. I.e before he leaves with Tyrion he kills competent courtiers. 

Daenerys landing in King's Landing with virtually no resistance would still be bitter-sweet because you could write Euron to have some sort of special game plan, and she would still need to defend against the White Walkers.",4,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Really though, once they were killed off, I didnt miss them that much at all, I was simply relieved that I didnt need to watch them adding more fuel to the fire or jumping into agreements and situations without giving it a second thought. 

Overall I just personally found the deaths of characters like Ned and Joffrey to be far more shocking because I did not see them coming at all, yet they still seem to be living in the shadow of The Red Wedding.",20,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

I mean all of the sacrifices that were made and then I realized that none of them will ever know the truth.

Ned lies and tells Catelyn that he cheated and had a bastard son, Catelyn hates Jon and wanted Ned to get rid of him because she couldnt stand the sight of Jon, but Ned never did.

So Catelyn died and lived most of her life thinking that her husband was a cheater and the Honorable Ned Stark had to tarnish his reputation to protect Jon.


To top it all off, poor Jon had to live his entire life believing he was a bastard and wasnt as good as the rest of the Starks. Jons adopted mother hated him and Sansa hated him as well.


Im just starting season 7 but I started to think about all of that and I felt so bad. Ned will never get to clear his name, Catelyn will never know Jon wasnt a bastard and Ned never cheated. 

The only good that came out of it was that Ned really did love Jon and tried to treat him the same as any of his other children. Jon was well educated and was able to learn how to use a sword with Robb and thankfully none of his other siblings hated him like Sansa did. ",18,22,False,spoiler,,,,,

This show is truly a masterpiece in my eyes it told so many great stories with so many great characters with many casualties in between making the survival of every character seem like they defied all odds without the plot shield many shows have. The great part of this is that this is only the starks story and the rest of GOT is just as great, seeing danys growth was amazing as well she gained a shitload of titles throughout this show haha.",12,17,False,spoiler,,,,,

So much effort has been put into the series and it clearly shows. I can't think of anything i've ever seen that could top this amazing show. One of my favourite things about the show is how real the world feels and is. All the characters feel real. Characters have real flaws but are still relatable. Theon is an excellent example of this whilst he invades winter-fell and kills innocent people because he feels as though he isn't good enough for his true family we understand why he does what he does and we may not think what he is doing is right but we know where he is coming from. I forgave him after he helped Sansa escape as it was clear that he felt terrible for what he had done and he had tried to fix that. The show reminds me of Fallout New Vegas in many ways as it is filled with morally ambiguous options and morally ambiguous people. It is everything i love about the genre of fantasy combined with the styles and story of games like Fallout New Vegas. Both things i love.

They both had to swear an oath to someone untrustworthy (cersei and walder), in order to get their help in the war they're about to fight.

I find it very interesting how they make the exact opposite choice.  Robb decides to swear the oath which helps him in the short term but in the end becomes his demise because he gets killed for breaking the oath. If he had never agreed to it in the first place than he'd be much worse off in the short term but in the long term he'd at least end up surviving (probably), because he is unable to even go to war since he can't cross the river.

Jon on the other hand declines to swear the oath which seems very stupid in the short term because he lost a huge ally to fight the big war, even if it's only a temporary ally. Of course cersei might still have tried some funny business but I believe that Jon will survive because he's avoided one of the biggest mistakes his cousin (robb) did make. I bet that if he swore the oath it would probably end up working against him just like it did against robb.

Ofcourse this is all speculation, he could still die against some random wight, but it would make sense for the show to let him live because he makes the right choice.

She is going to end up as the villain.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/90t7x4/spoilers_you_guys_got_it_all_wrong_daenerys/,Monsoon77,1532213175,"I've been holding onto this theory after reading A Dance with Dragons a few years ago. Daenerys is barely holding onto her sanity. If she didn't have the wise council from her followers she would have crucified and burned thousands of people in Mereen. She is ruthless killing hundreds people just for not agreeing to follow her. She has stated repeatedly she will take what is her's through fire and blood. Dany is her father's daughter for sure and now that she is getting older her worst fears have begun to come true and she starts hearing whispers and have vilolent outbursts just like her father the Mad King. She leds an invasion army consisting of monsters, mercenaries, raiders, slaves, and a horde of Dothraki. She burns the Tarly's just for not bending the knee. Now she has lost one of her ""children"" and will probably be even more ruthless in getting what she wants.

Now looking at season 8 this is how I think things will play out. Jon and Dany have fallen in love, but Jon has not seen the Mad side of her yet. When they arrive at Winterfell they will be greeted by Jamie Lannister and Bronn hoping to join forces. Do you really think Daenerys will just be like ""ok hey you killed my dad and tried to kill me but no biggie lets team up lol?"" She'll imprison him thinking he will try to betray her. Tyrion will be furious and try everything to get her to release his brother, but Daenerys will refuse threatening to kill Tyrion along with his brother. Jamie will be sentenced to death by dragon fire. Jon will finally get to see Bran again who will tell him who his mother and father are and that his real name is Aegon Targaryen and the he not Dany is the rightful ruler of Westeros. Jon will also figure out that means Dany is his aunt and is unable to have children. Jamie will be locked in a cage awaiting his execution at dawn but will be visited by his brother Tyrion and Bronn repaying his brother by releasing him like Jamie did for him. This is the 2nd betrayal. Jamie reveals that the young woman Tyrion married was not a whore but actually loved him, and Tywin ordered his men to rape her instead of her willingly sleeping with them for gold. She was unable to live with herself and jumped to her death. Jamie escapes with Bronn's help but Tyrion stays behind hoping to somehow change Danys mind. Instead she will have Tyrion burned in place of his brother despite the council of all her followers. This is the moment the audience will turn on her.

Jamie hearing of his brother's death returns to Winterfell with Bronn helping him sneak in to avenge Tyrion's death. Jon finds them first and earlier being told of Bran's ""climbing accident"". Jon, Jamie, and Bronn fight in the courtyard of Winterfell. Jon's experience fighting in the North helps him tremendously as Jamie and Bronn struggle to fight in the snow. Jamie is badly wounded but Bronn refuses to give up finally for once in his life fighting for something other than gold but to avenge his friend. Jon outmatches Bronn who won't fall for his tricks and falls to Jon's blade. Jamie is recaptured for the final time and burned alive. Cersei hearing of Jamie's death sends everything she has at Winterfell. Dany begins to go even more mad as an army led by Euron arrives at Winterfell and a navy at Dragonstone. Another battle for the north happens along with the Clegane brothers finally meeting in battle. Euron takes down Dany's second dragon with the giant crossbow while Jon is riding him. Thinking her lover and dragon is dead Dany goes beserk burning everything on both sides killing Euron but also destroying most of her army in the process. She is not done though, next she seeks vengance against Cersei flying to King's Landing by burning the Red Keep. Little do they know the Mad King had plans many years back to destroy King's Landing by hiding Wildfire caches everywhere. The fire from her Drogon ignites a chain reaction destroying most of King's Landing and burnings the Red Keep to the ground with Cersei sitting in the Iron Throne clutching her pregnant belly. 

Jon survives but Rhaegal is dead. He mounts a horse and chases after Dany but arrives to a burnt ruin of King's Landing. With snow falling he arrives at the remains of the Red Keep and finds Dany sitting on the throne surrounded by bones, ash, and snow. Dany is practically shouting ""I burned them, I burned them all Jon! All of our enemies!"" Jon is horrified and reminded of the stories of the Mad King. She gets out of her ruined throne and runs to embrace Jon. But Jon slowly unsheathes his sword and as Dany runs to his arms he pierces her in the heart with tears running down his face. Dany stares at him with Mad Eyes asking ""Why?"" ""For the kingdom"" he proclaims. Dany still holding onto Jon takes her last breath and Jon screams in agony. This is the 3rd and last betrayal. Jon stands with Daenery's lifeless body still clinging to her in his arms. He let's her go pulling the sword from her heart. Longclaw suddenly bursts into flames. Jon is Azor Ahai, forced to kill his love in order to temper his blade Lightbringer. Jon stands there in the burned throne room filled with snow and ash holding the flaming sword of legend as the last living dragon roars but is stopped and now controlled by Bran. 

The survivors of Danys battlefield massacre are holding up in Winterfell but will soon be overrun by the undead. Jon arrives wielding a flaming sword flying Drogon/Bran and fighting 2 undead dragons and a horde of zombies. Events happen and soon he finds himself face to face with the Night's King. They fight epically and Jon slays the Night King with his sword of legend but falls himself mortally wounded. All the undead crumble in their tracks as the remaining survivors huddle together in their final stand. The last Targaryen and ancestor of Valyria lays on his back watching the snowy clouds fade away allowing a beam of sunlight to lightly fall on his face. Jon takes his last breath as the snow stops falling all over Westeros. 

There is your bitter sweet ending!",90,109,False,spoiler,,,,,

* S1E1 - The first scene with Sansa and Lady Catelyn in Sansas room. In this scene she tells her mom that she wants to go south to marry Joffrey and be his queen. The next scene is Jon talking to uncle Benjen, where he tells his uncle that he wants to join the Nights Watch and he doesnt care about wife or kids.

'


* S1E4  Sansa and Septa Mordane visit the Throne room. This scene was written specially for the show, its not in the books. She tells Sansa that **one day your husband will sit there, and you will sit by his side.** 

'


* S1E5  Sansa receives a rose from Ser Loras at the Hand of the King Tournament. Just like her aunt Lyanna Stark a few years ago at the Harrenhall Tournament. 


'


* S1E9  Jon Snow goes see Maetser Aemon at his command. Maester Aemon knows Jon is being tempted to leave the Nights Watch to be with his brother Robb and fight in the war for his fathers life. Aemon tells Jon his own personal drama and gives him a speech over **Love and Duty.** Maester Aemon: ""Did you ever wonder why the men of the Nights Watch take the No wife, no children vows? So that they will not love. Love is the death of duty.""   


'

* S2E4  Joffrey order the Kingsguard to beat Sansa in the Throne Room after Robb defeats this armies on the battlefield. The knight rips apart her dress and leaves her almost naked. Tytion stops the assault and order someone to cover her up. [We see Sansa being cloaked by the Hound, with the blue winter rose](http://static.wixstatic.com/media/2177cc_ead555d6403b4b5fb65c5b676758d992.png/v1/fill/w_491,h_275,al_c,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/2177cc_ead555d6403b4b5fb65c5b676758d992.png) (Jon) right behind her. This blue rose was showed just a few times during the show. 

'


* S2E7  Sansa gets her first period and its invited by Cersei into her room for a talk. Cersei tells her that: ""Permit me to share some women wisdom with you on this very special day. The more people you love, the weaker you are. You will do things for them that you know you shouldnt do. You will act like the fool to make them happy, to keep them safe. Love no one but your children. On that front, a mother has no choice."" Thats almost the same speech Maester Aemon gave to Jon Snow 

'



* SEASON 3 - This season will be a very interesting parallel between Jon and Sansa. In the beginning of the season, Jon will be forced to lie and pretend to be a wildling, the enemies of the North. Sansa in the end of this season, will be forced to marry a Lannister, the enemies of House Stark.


'


* S3E7  Margaery takes Sansa for a walk in the gardens and tries to cheer her up about her marriage to Tyrion. She gives Sansa a sex advices and explains to her that women are quite complicated and that its takes practice to please us. The next scene Jon Snow is receiving sex advices from Tormound. He tells Jon Snow that Most men fuck like dogs you need to be patient, give time, your cock shouldnt be near her until she is slick as a baby seal. He tells Jon that he needs to be gentle. 


'



* S5E4  Jon Snow, now Lord Commander, is sending letters to the Lords of the North asking men for the Nights Watch. The first name of the list is **LORD ASHFORD**. Later in the episode we have Sansa on the crypts of Winterfell lighting a candle for her aunt Lyanna Stark. In this scene Littlefinger is telling her about the  famous Harrenhall Tournment, where Rheagar gave a blue rose to Lyanna Stark. This is a special nod to the Ashford Theory. 


'


* S6E4  Jon and Sansa are reunited at Castle Black. In the scene inside Jons room in front of the fire place, Sansa is wearing Jons old cloak. The grey one he used to wear at Winterfell before taking the black. The act of cloaking a woman with his own cloak represents marriage in Westeros.

'

* S6E5- This time is Sansa who cloaks Jon with a Stark cloak that she made herself. 


'


* S6E2 Jon decides to leave Winterfell and go to Dragonstone. In the crypts Littlefinger tells him that he loves Sansa and wants to marry her, Jon immediately assaults Littlefinger and tells him that he will kill him if he touches Sansa. After they leave the crypts, Littlefinger looks at Jon, and then looks at Sansa who is looking at Jon and starts to wonder.

'



* S7E6- Jon Snow tries to give back Longclaw to Jorah, but he refuses and tells Jon he was not a good sin to his father. He tells Jon:**""It may serve you well and your children after you.** Right after Jorah says this the Stark theme starts to play and the very next scene cuts to Winterfell to a scene with Sansa. 

'


* S7E7  Littlefinger and Sansa are discussing Jons  raven informing of his decision to bend the knee to Daenerys Targaryen. Littlefinger is playing with a wooden Wolf and tells Sansa how Daenerys is a very beautiful woman. Sansa response: **""what that has to do with anything?""** Thats the same quote Arya used, when she was jealous of Gendry and Melisandre in season 3. Littlefinger was trying to make Sansa jealous because he sensed something was happening Jon and Sansa.

'

At first i was going to pick Stannis the Mannis, Law and order. He also will put effort into defeating the night king. Also I think he's a baddas, but then I realized if I worked for him, it wouldn't be long before I got burned for doing something wrong lol.
I was sad to see him die season 5 tho lol.

It has written/introduced every walk of life there is. Every psychology. Every single personality that has ever imagined is in Game of Thrones/A Song of Ice &amp; Fire (and then developed them to their true potential). Let's give some examples:

First, the personalities and their character traits. There is introversion &amp; awkwardness (Jon Snow) and shyness &amp; being helpless (Daenerys). They both overcome all of those while being a bastard, a loner, or an outsider to become a Lord Commander/King in the North &amp; Khaleesi/Queen. We also see extroversion with great sense of humor (Tyrion) and depression (Bran Stark). 

Samwell Tarly, a guy who is fat, loves to read books and a coward, fought and killed the White Walker for the first time in thousands of years and then became one of the most knowledgable person in Westeros. There's a cynic (Edd), romantic (Pyp) and slow-witted (Grenn).

There's an honorable man (Ned) and a big liar (Cersei). There's also a tomboyish girl (Arya) who became a skilled assassin and a proper lady (Sansa/Margaery) who mastered the art of politics and governing. There's a sassy man/woman (Tywin/Olenna), and a strong &amp; independent man/woman (Tormund/Ygritte).

We see laziness (Tommen) and hardworking (Lyanna Mormont). We see loyalty (Podrick) and backstabber (Baelish). Foul-mouthed (Sandor) and discreet (Varys). There are bullies (Joffrey) and kind-hearted (Shireen). Rude people (Craster) and polite (Gilly).

Second, not only unique personality but it combines with some kind of deformity too. Bran Stark, an outgoing/climber kid who became a cripple, devoid of physical activities, discovered some mental abilities (Internet). There's a burned face, ugly face. A girl with greyscale. There's a smug guy who was humbled when he lost his hand. There's a Eunuch, I mean tons of eunuchs, and there's a very, very, very old woman. And so on...

Every personality, disorder, and physical/mental attribute is in Game of Thrones, and that is why we love it so much because it's so relatable and we understood all their actions, motives, and perspectives, because every one of us can see ourselves through them.

Which of the main characters are most likely to survive by the end of the show. (Lets list em) 

Jon Snow 

Daenerys 

Tyrion 

Arya 

Sansa 

Jaime

Cersei

These are the highest priority people in the show right now so who do we think out of this list is most likely to make it out alive. 

I personally feel like if Vegas put odds on it Id put my money on Arya. Jon and Dany are about as 50/50 as it goes. I think one of them is dying if not both by the end of the show. So they are way too risky. Jaime is dead and so is Cersei. Cersei is 100% dead while Jaime Im putting at 90%. Tyrion is 3rd on who I think could make it back bcuz he always seems to find a way to survive. Sansa is 2nd here bcuz she would play nicely into the future of Westeros because she wanted to be a queen and I could see her being queen of the north at the end of the series if all of Westeros isnt destroyed by the end of this series. 

I see Arya as the most important piece to the end game of thrones. I just have a feeling that dagger has a high significance towards the story. Shes been building to becoming this ultimate killer/hero type of person that I feel like her arch would be incomplete if she were to die in the final war. I could see it happen as I can with everyone on this list but I feel Arya is 1. Too young and 2. Is more of an important character to the story than Sansa. 

So my rankings goes as follows 

1. Arya 

2. Sansa 

3. Tyrion 

4. Jon 

5. Dany 

6. Jaime 

7. Cersei

There are so many different character arcs and surprises and the writing has been superb. 

For me binge watching is extremely difficult and I find it hard to get into a show, so I rarely do. 

But I am a firm believer in peer reviews and critic scores and every time I checked IMDb for a new show to watch this was at the top every single time. I believe second was Breaking Bad and up until this show Breaking Bad was my all time favorite show and I couldnt believe another show was supposedly better.

I came into this show with an open mind and it actually wasnt what I was expecting at all. Somehow I had got the notion that dragons were prominent everywhere so I was expecting something like Reign of Fire but this show has truly blown me away. 

The acting was phenomenal I think the Hound might be my favorite supporting character, he has so many notable lines and he is truly one of the first to see the world as it is.

I think the biggest was when Brienne of Tarth says shes going to protect Arya and bring her to safety and he says something along the lines of there is nowhere safe in this world everything she has is gone type of thing.

Then we he goes back to the hut and sees the man and daughters skeleton he really began to change. The conversation between him and Tormund when they are looking for the wight was one of my favorite dialogues, that was the only way to have a little light hearted fun added into a situation that they were getting themselves in.

Dont even get me started on poor Jon, his entire life he had to grow up thinking he was a bastard and that he wasnt good enough and so he set out to the Nights Watch because it was basically his only option and the only place he would be treated like anyone else.

Catelyn Stark will never know that her husband wasnt a cheater and she died hating Jon and everything he was because it meant that Ned slept with someone else.

Ned tarnished his reputation to protect Jon and raised him like a son after fighting in a war that was almost entirely based on a lie. To top it all off he gets beheaded by a little shit swizzler for being following his best friends last request. But not only do they kill him, they make him confess to crimes that he never even committed.

I am truly afraid that season 8 is going to go Infinity War on our asses and start killing off the rest of our beloved characters left and right. I also wonder how Jon will feel about the fact that he slept with his Aunt. 

All in all, I have watched three serious shows that I have truly enjoyed Breaking Bad, House M.D and Game of Thrones and I never thought that this show would live up to expectations, but it has exceeded them in every way imaginable. Im always late to the party. I didnt watch Breaking Bad until after the final season, but I am glad I will be able to wait and enjoy the final season with all of the rest of you.

i am talking of a scenario where the night king would be defeated and killed first. and then euron would occupy king's landing and kingslanding could witness the final showdown between euron and basically everyone else, jon, jaime, tyrion, etc.

in the books, euron is portrayed as a terrifying dark lord. in the books, he is attributed with sorcery like powers and he is paving the ground for a massive bloodsacrifice to conjure up his mythical ironborn diety.

does this mean he could blow the whole of king's landing with wildfire?? ( and does it mean he wants to conjure up a mythical ironborn creature/diety for his evil plans of an ironborn empire)??

i think cersei inviting euron to make a common cause could be as disastrous(or even more) as she invited high sparrow for her short term goals. I do think that euron would turn against cersei and probably take her hostage. he might have the support of qyburn in this and with his help, he may uncover the location of wildfire stashes in kingslanding.

he could utilise this wildfire to blow up the whole of kingslanding. he may come up with a nasty plan, collect all his opponents in kingslanding and then blow it up. probably he is planning to blow the whole of kingslanding when the combined armies of jon, jaime enter the kingslanding. it could be lot like a battle for casterly rock scenario, where euron's men would be waiting in ships outside kingslanding and the main army gets trapped inside kingslanding.

Also he posted a new picture of his character euron in the show.

The image shows a shocking physical transformation of the character, who looks completely different to the Euron  in seasons 6 and 7.

his picture looks a lot more terrifying and is somewhat close to the terrifying dark lord version of euron in the books.

In the Instagram snap, Euron has a balding head with long, white locks of hair as well as a clean-shaven face.

In fact, Euron looks a lot more like his brother Balon Greyjoy (Patrick Malahide) but far more villanous, monstrous and terrifying.

heres the pic

Rewatching S07E07, when Cersei asks Jon to withold from the war for the truce, he declares himself already bound to Dany. Look at the wolf-pommel while he talks. It appears to be blinking as well. Either there's glas or whatever in there and it's just reflecting, or something else is going on, like beyond the wall.

Which is why I will not be deleting them either (as they are similar minus two changes). Either way I will leave a link to them here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8zx28z/spoilers_my_theoriespredictions_for_season_8/
Now lets begin, my predictions are made up of my own ideas, the small amount of filming info I read, and one Leak that may not even be true:

-	After racing to Castle Black to inform Edd of Eastwatch Destruction, Tormund and Beric race on horse pack to WF to warn the Starks (and Jon once he arrives) as Edd chooses to stay and Defend the wall, him &amp; the rest of NW dies either marching too Eastwatch and trying to hold off the NKs forces or NK brings down the rest of the Wall. Meanwhile in Wintertown the citizens are in fear after feeling the ground shake knowing what it means, Bran informs the Maester to tell Jon of the wall falling once he arrives and his sisters of the people in Wintertown being scared and Arya with some Northern soldiers escort everyone (including Old Lady Mel) to WF. 
-	Gendry soon arrives informing the Starks that J&amp;D have arrived at White Harbor, Arya and Gendry then have a proper more heartfelt reunion in the crypts and bond for alittle. After metting up with Tormund &amp; Beric on the road and learning of what happened, J&amp;D arrive to WF &amp; we get reunions galore (Jon &amp; Ghost, Sam, and Stark children, Sandor and Arya &amp; Sansa, and Tyrion and Sansa) and Northerners are not pleased to see Jon with Dany and her Dragons flying above. Jon sets up a meeting to discuss a plan against AOTD and to announce Dany as there queen. The Northerners give him smack for this and both Sansa &amp; even Arya (in a twist) are not pleased (but dont worry both sisters (especially Arya) grow to like Dany). Meanwhile Cersei Miscarriages growing more mad &amp; Paranoid then ever.
-	Theon arrives at Pyke only to learn of Eurons lie via Damphair whom is dies in his arms. Theon then sails off to try and track down Euron whom is getting the Golden Company from Essos after giving Yara the Forsakened treatment and Euron gets an idea. Bronn finds Jaime in the Crossroads Inn where he explains to him he is going on his own to assemble an army to take North and is offered to tag along, He does and they get an army made up of Remaining Frey Bannermen, 300 Sellswords from the Westerlands (thanks Bronn), and Edmure &amp; his remaining Bannermen (who escaped prisonment in between season). After wards they arrive to WF with not so warm welcomes (except for Brienne and Pod) but Jaime does apologize to Bran and Jon. Jon also gets revealed the truth via Bran and Sam, With a lot of mixed emotions he decides to tell the other Starks and Dany, But before Dany can even tell him shes pregnant the horn goes off and its time for battle (also if your wondering Last hearth and Karhold was attack at this point).
-	The battle is brutal, resulting in the deaths of Ghost, Tormund, Grey Worm, Bronn, Yohn Royce, and most of the Northern Lords. Gendry also dies but is given the Kiss of Life by Beric. While that happens however Euron, Harry, and the GC surprise attack WF setting it aflame and sacking it for food, With Sansa &amp; Tyrion taken hostage &amp; Varys revealed to be a Traitor. NK arrives after Euron leaves and Mel uses her magic to hold off the NK for others to escape (even turning some dead against him) and barely escapes herself, Theon tracks down Eurons ships only to be forced to kill a Tongueless Yara in her own Reek Persona, Mel meets up with him, explains who she is, and they sail off. J&amp;D &amp; co. have fallen back to the Riverlands where Dany finally reveals she is pregnant, They decide to marry with Jon not wanting his children to be Bastards also Bran &amp; Sam head to the Gods eye to figure out how to defeat NK once and for all and Jaime, Brienne, Gendry, Pod, and Sandor are send to KL to deal with Cersei, on there way there they run into Arya &amp; gendry who are headed there for the samething (they evacuated separate from everyone else).
-	In KL Euron returns with the Golden Company (though some died in surprise attack) and Tyrion &amp; Sansa are brought to Cersei, It is revealed Tyrions deal was that her child would live and be heir to the throne if J&amp;D win, but with the miscarriage she breaks the deal and his tongue is cut out. Jaime &amp; co. make it and Arya &amp; Gendry sneak in to Euron &amp; Cerseis wedding (with Arya disguised in clothing similar to what Lyanna wore on her wedding day) to find out what has happened to Sansa &amp; Tyrion. The next day Jaime, Brienne, Pod, &amp; Sandor sneak in through the sewers while Gendry &amp; Arya get in through the front via Aryas FM skills. Harry Strickland after talking with Sansa has a change of heart &amp; lets Arya &amp; Gendry into the Red Keep, CLEGANEBOWL Sandor gets wounded badly in the fight but Arya &amp; Brienne step in &amp; finish off the Mountain as Sandor dies of his wounds. Arya almost kills Cersei but chooses family over vengeance &amp; goes to save Sansa &amp; Tyrion letting Jaime take the kill, As Harry sends some GC to Trident and kills Qyburn (Also Varys and Euron turn up missing).
-	Everyone leaves from Riverrun to the Trident where they meet up with Theon, Mel, and Tyrion &amp; the GC Harry send. As Dany goes into labour and survives giving birth to twins Jon meets with Bran &amp; Sam at the Gods Eye where Bran reveals Not only is Rhaegar Azor Ahai and Jon is Lightbringer, And that the NK is not the first WW (weather or not he is the 13th lord commander I have not decided yet) but also that the WWs have return due to a mix of Resurgence in Magic, Wanting to end the curse the Children gave them, and being threatened by the burning of Weirwood. Bran explains what he must do and how to defeat him.
-	Everyone then heads to KL, By then the AOTD is not too far away, Jon and Dany fight the NK in the skies while Arya &amp; Gendry evacuate the city and Theon with his Ironborn and GC fight Euron and his Ironborn and remaining Pro-Euron GC. NK kills Dany and Drogon and Rhaegal dies killing Undead Viserion as Jon and NK land safely near the Dragonspit where they 1v1. Varys reappears and informs Jaime of the Wildfire under the Red Keep that will cause a chain reaction destroying the whole city. Jaime races to use it as a weapon on the Wights not before confessing his love to brienne. After everyone has evacuated Jaime sets it off killing him, Varys, the Little Birds, Sept Unella, Harry Strickland, Mel, and the Wights.
-	Bran &amp; Sam arrive in time for Bran to perform a Hold the Door 2.0 on the NK weakening him, Jon puts him down and with help from Sam removes the Dragonglass from his chest killing NK, Making remaining Wights collapse, and Turning the WWs human. Afterwards everyone meets in the Dragonspit to decide whats next. Jon is elected king and his first act is melting down the Iron Throne &amp; declaring there will no longer be one ruler but multiple rulers for each kingdom, Also a Proto-Democratic Government/Republic is established and Red Priest are banished from Westeros. Tyrion is given the Westerlands, Edmure gets back Riverlands, Robin keeps the Vale, Sansa gets the North, Sam and Gilly get the Reach, New houses get Pyke and the Stormlands, A Likeable Sand Snake gets Dorne, and Bran chooses to leave beyond the former wall with the now turned human WWs. Arya along with Gendry and some Refugees sail more west (with Arya &amp; Gendry now being lovers), and Jon raises his children in KL as Ned did for him back in WF.
-	Oh and Sam write a Song of Ice and Fire. ALTERNATE ENDING: Arya and Gendry get the Crownlands and Jon decides to go back home in the North and raise his children there. Sansa kills Robin and assumes power in the vale.",2,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

I believe that both Cersei and Daenerys will destroy Kings Landing fighting for the Throne, but the show has been pointing out to Dany pretty much from season 1.


'



**S1E10**  The sorceress Mirri Maz Dull tells Daenerys she killed her son because [he would be the Stallion who Mounts the World, who would burn cities to the ground.]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLpvLlrlFgc). The show is very precise about prophecies due the lack of time, they only show what is absolutely necessary. They left this prophecy because it will have relevance in the storyline. We now know that it was not Danys son, but Daenerys herself who would be The stallion who mounts. The prophecy says that the Stallion is the ""khal of khals"" who will unite all the Dothraki under his single khalasar and ride to the ends of the earth. Thats what Daenerys did in season 6 and 7. If the prophecy its confirmed, she will be the one burning cities and trampling nations into dust.

'


&gt;Daenerys: My child was innocent.
&gt;Mirri: Innocent? He would be the Stalion who Mounts the World, now **he would burn no cities, now he will trample no nations into dust.**

'

**S1 E10**  - [Dany decides to kill Khal Drogo and burn his body next to her dragon eggs.]( https://youtu.be/wHJTYqLtRms) She lays next to him and promises to reunite with him one day ""When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east"". The next scene happens in Kings Landing Kings Landing with Maester Pyrcelle and Ross in his room; he is remembering the Mad King and what likeable and charming man he used to be in his youth, before madness took over him.

'

&gt;Aerys Targaryen, of all the thousands and thousands maladies, the Gods visits us, madness is the worst. He was a good man, such a charmer. To watch him melt away before my eyes, consumed with **dreams of Fire and Blood**

'

The episode ends with Daenerys entering the fire pyre to eventually hatch the eggs and give birth to 3 dragons. She had this idea from a dragon dream in the early nights.


'


**S2 E4**  [Dany arrives in Qarth and they dont want to let her in]( https://youtu.be/In7YGhGt9Dw?t=3m9s), so she threatens to destroy the city once her dragons are bigger, thats the first time she threats to burn down a city and destroy completely. Daenerys is not mad or insane like her father. Her pride its her weakness, she is a very impulsive woman and when her pride is hurt she loses her head and makes drastic and terrible decisions. This wont be the last time Daenerys threatens to burn a city to the ground.

&gt;Daenerys: Thirteen, when my dragons are grown, we will take back what was stolen from me, and destroy those who wronged me, we will lay waste to armies, and burn cities to the ground. Turns us way, and I will burn you first!!!

&gt;Thirtenn: ahhhh, You ARE a Targaryen


'

**S2 E5**  Tyrion finds out all the [wildfire that its under Kings Landing]( https://youtu.be/YqMrgvy9uMA?t=2m), he mentions that its enough Wildfire to destroy all city. He tells the pyromancer: **The contents of this room could lay Kings Landing low.**The very next scene is Dany is Qarth, teaching Drogo to obey to her Dracarys order for the first time.


'


**S3 E4** In this scene, Varys tries to [alert Lady Ollena of how dangerous Littlefinger is]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFZen-XO5II
). Pay attention at the words he uses to describe Littlefinger, those are the exact same words Tyrion used to describe Daenerys when he met her in Meeren.

'

&gt;Varys: **""Littlefinger was born with no lands, no wealth, no armies.** He acquired the first two, how long before he has the army?"" Peharps you laugh, but I know him better than most and this is the truth.""Littlefinger is one of the most dangerous men in Westeros.... he would see this country burn if he could be **King of the Ashes**

'

Varys was afraid that Littlefinger would destroy the realm trying to get the Iron Throne, so he decided to bring Daenerys to Westeros, ironically, she will be the one turning the kingdom into ashes. And here is something even better, this episode S3E4 ends with Daenerys literally acquiring her **first army**. [She sacks Astapor and leaves with the Unsulied, getting her first army in order to invade Westeros.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGRyZSMzRyo)


'

S3 E7  In the Throne room Joffrey asks Tywin about Daenerys and wonders if they should do something about her. Tywin dismiss his concerns and tells him that **Curiosities on the far side of the world are no threats to us.**  Westeros and the big players of the game continue to ignore Daenerys and her dragons, they are far more worried about their own selfish little games. Right after this scene, we cut to Essos where Dany is planning the invasion of Yunkai. This will be the second city she conquers. 


'

S5E10- Right after the scene where Stannis burns down Sheereen at the stake as a sacrifice for the Lord of Light, they cut to the scene in Meereen where Daenerys and Hizdahr are presenting to the reopening of the Fighting Pits. During their conversation Daenerys explain that sometimes there may be a good reason to burn a city to the ground.


&gt;Hizdahr - That is a vital part of the Great City of Meereen, which existed long before you and I and will remain standing long after we have returned to the dirt.

&gt;Daenerys - One day your great city will return to the dirt as well.

&gt;Hizdahr - At your command?

&gt;Daenerys - If need to be.

&gt;Hizdahr - And how many will die to make their happen?

&gt;Daenerys - If it comes to that, they will have died for a good reason.

&gt;Hizdahr - Those men (in the fighting pit) think they are dying for a good reason.

&gt;Daenerys - Someone else reason.

&gt;Hizdahr - So your reasons are true and theirs are false? They dont know their own minds, but you do?


'

This dialogue is a very important moment for Daenerys as a character. She is starting to rationale the idea of burning cities to the ground in order to achieve an objective, as something necessary, while not realizing that she is losing her humanity, just like those men who are fighting in the pits. She is using excuses of a greater cause to justify the deaths of millions. Just like Stannis did when he burned down Sheeren.


'

S6 E6 - Bran Stark has a new series of visions and one of the visions include a dragon flying over Kings Landing. In the DVD comentary the producers D&amp;D made sure to observe that the image of the dragon flying over Kings Landing it was one the most important image of the whole show.


'


S6 E8  Cersei shows up at the Throne room for a Royal announcement, Tommen declares Trial by combat forbidden in all 7 Kingdoms. [Cersei then asks Qyburn about the rumor of wildfire under the city]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmqQo37R3As), he confirms that the rumors are true and is much bigger than they expected to be. 

'

&gt;Qyburn: Your grace, that old rumor you told me about it. My little birds investigated.

&gt;Cersei: And? Its just a rumor or something more?

&gt;Qyburn? More, so much more.


'

The very next scene? Meeren being attacked by the rival cities of Slavery Bay. Missandei tells Tyrion: The Masters have come to collect their properties. Thats how Daenerys sees Westeros, something that belongs to her and that she needs to retake it.


'


**S6E9**- Daenerys returns to Meereen and finds the city is being attacked by the Masters of the rival cities. She then tells Tyion about her plans against the attack. 

'

&gt;Daenerys: I will crucify the masters. I will set their fleets on fire, kill every last one of their soldiers, and return their city to the dirt.

'

Daenerys was contemplating the idea of burning a city to the ground in the past season, now she wants to actually do it, but is stopped by Tyrion who presents her with another idea. Thats the second time now that  Daenerys threatens to burn down a city and turn into ashes. 

'


**S6E10**  The scene where [Jon Snow is crowned KITN, Lord Cerweyn tells the room that they need to go home.]( https://youtu.be/AXAnxAA73xM?t=37s) 


&gt;The Boltons are defeated, the war is over, winter has come, if the measters are right it will be the coldest one in a thousands years, we should ride home and wait for the coming storms.

&gt;Jon Snow: The war is not over, and I promise you friend, **the true enemy wont wait out the storm, he brings the storm.** 

Remember, Daenerys nickname is Stormborn. She was always a threath to Westeros, but we were so distarcted by the Night King and the Armt of the Dead that we dodnt realize how dangerous she could be for 
the whole realm. 


'


I now believe that both dragons and the army of the dead will destroy the kingdom, but George used the White Walkers as a redherring for the dragons and the way George did was kind of brilliant. The very first scene of the book and tv show, its the rangers going North of the wall and finding the White Walkers and we were all so scared and terrified of them. Then the last scene of the book 1 and season 1 its the birth of the dragons and we all celebrated!!! We were soo happy and excited, and we didnt realize that dragons were as dangerous for Westeros as the White Walkers. 


George RRM called [Daenerys and the Army of the Dead, much bigger threats that could destory the kingdom]( http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/talk-to-al-jazeera/articles/2014/11/13/george-rr-martintalkstodavidshuster.html), but people were so worried about the selfish politics in Kings Landing that they ignore the danger. 

'


&gt;George RRM - Well, of course, the two outlying ones  **the things going on north of the Wall, and then there is a Targaryen on the other continent with her dragons  are of course the ice and fire of the title**, A Song of Ice and Fire. You know, one of the dynamics I started with, there was the sense of people being so consumed by their petty struggles for power within the seven kingdoms, within Kings Landing  whos going to be king? Whos going to be on the Small Council? Whos going to determine the policies?  **that theyre blind to the much greater and more dangerous threats that are happening far away on the periphery of their kingdoms.**

The scene is Jon saying goodbye to Bran while Bran is still in his coma.  Jon references the fact that he and Bran had always planned to go to the wall together, and that they still will someday. They can even go beyond the wall together, if Bran isnt too afraid.

Could the secret to defeating the NK lie beyond the wall, only to be discovered by Bran in a vision?  I for one would love to see Jon and Bran go beyond the wall together, perhaps to strip the NK of his source of power.

Just a thought.

Following that same thought process, as the white walker army travels further south to King's Landing (presumably), could the Night Kings power dwindle somewhat as well?

But having read a lot of them  I have some unanswered doubts.

1. It strikes me as a huge coincidence that when the Targaryens flew from Old Valyria and conquered the seven kingdoms (riding 3 dragons), Aegon was the conqueror and now, Daenerys has 3 dragons (2 after the Night King killed one) with Aegon Targaryen (Jons real name) by her side.

2. Also its a huge coincidence that when Samwell Tarly is transcribing old texts in Oldtown, he lingers in a page where we see the dagger that Littlefinger gave the catspaw to murder Bran; that page stated that the Targaryens used dragonglass to decorate their weapons (one can only asume that the dagger was Aegons).

3. The white walkers were asleep for a thousand years waiting to conquer Westeros again.

It seems a bit cyclical from the time the Targaryens with Aegon leading them conquered Westeros and the current TV show timeline.

I think the dagger is more of a remember Littlefingers treason, because if it belonged to Aegon Targaryen, now theres another Aegon Targaryen and the dagger reappeared (now in Aryas belt).

Could it be possible that the dagger holds a special significance throughout the story of the seven kingdoms and will be used to kill the Night King?

1857,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-7-24,2018,7,24,0,9183ap,self.gameofthrones,[SPOILERS] Game of Thrones - a critique,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/9183ap/spoilers_game_of_thrones_a_critique/,Subtleiaint,1532360284,"I am quite happy to claim that Game of Thrones is one of the best TV shows ever made, its production, themes, acting and story are all of the highest order but I dont think Ill get too many disagreements when I say the quality dropped off dramatically in season 5 and, whilst it has picked up again since, season 7, and presumably the final season, are very different in style to the first few. This post is my attempt to quantify why the show dropped in quality and what has changed.

There are three primary storylines in GoT, the power struggle in Kings Landing, the approach of the White Walkers in the North and the rise of Dany in the East, each of these stories start independently before coming together in the final act. The problem the showrunners had is they struggled to make each story consistently compelling over the first six seasons. 

The weakest of the three stories was Danys, in the first season it was excellent, Danys transition from victim to regal queen was astonishing but the showrunners found it impossible to maintain that momentum over the following 5 seasons. They knew that at some point Dany would have to sail to Westeros at the head of an army but they struggled to make her journey towards that point compelling. In the end we had to contend with a bland success followed by set back arc that robbed her ambition to retake the Iron Throne of any urgency.

Much better was the story in the North. Jons rise from ranger to leading the resistance against the White Walkers was nuanced and well paced featuring a rich supporting cast to help or hinder him. But it wasnt this that made the show great,  Jons story was the most traditional of the three, a young hero has to overcome adversity to save the world from a terrifying enemy, its a  classic heros journey thats been told thousands of times and, no matter how well GoT did it, it could never truly stand out.

What made GoT special was the power struggle in Kings Landing. From the moment Robert Baratheon died the show went into overdrive, the vacuum that emerged that various parties tried to fill, the war that was told in terms of strategy rather than combat, the court intrigue and manoeuvring, it was superb.  At the heart of all this was Tywin Lannister, the man pulling the strings and holding all the cards. This storyline was all about the battle for the crown, the early seasons focussed on the War of the Five Kings ending with Joffrey as the last man standing. Season 4 maintained the intrigue by murdering Joffrey and dealing with the fall out. Its notable that this part of the story was book ended by a very specific event, the death of Tywin Lannister.

With Tywin gone seasons 5 and 6 where supposed to be about the battle to replace him as the true power behind the throne.  It was an interesting idea with Margery Tyrell, Cersai and the High Sparrow all manoeuvring to dominate King Tommen but the showrunners failed to make it as exciting or surprising  as the earlier seasons. We never really understood what each parties ambitions were and what where the stakes. In the end the matter was settled by a big reset button of an explosion which made the events of the previous two seasons largely meaningless, it was an unsatisfactory ending to an unsatisfactory storyline.

The result of this was that seasons 5 and 6 were a big disappointment, Kings landing was flat, we were still waiting for Dany to do anything interesting and the story in the North wasnt enough to maintain the show by itself.

Season 7 picked up the pace again but now the show was very different, we were finally in the end game. Dany was back on Westeros fighting Cersai and Jon Snow was trying to rally them to put aside their differences and unite against the White Walkers. What we had was a very different story to the one that worked so well in the early seasons. Gone was the intrigue, manoeuvring and battle of wits, it was replaced by an epic fantasy story similar in style and scope to Lord of the Rings. This is not a terrible outcome, GoT is still the most incredible thing weve seen on TV but now its epic for its scope rather then the brilliance of the story.  

Im still hoping that GoT can surprise and delight me in the way it did in the early seasons but Im not expecting it to. Im expecting an epic conclusion where villains are defeated and heroes save the day, all framed by the most incredible battle scenes ever shown on TV. That ending wont be bad, Ill still love it and Im sure there will be a twist or two yet to come but it will lack the complexity and blurred lines of the first seasons, it will fall short of the expectations I had for the show when Tyrion shot Tywin as he sat on the privy.

Which is why I will not be deleting them either (as they are similar minus two changes). Either way I will leave a link to them here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8zx28z/spoilers_my_theoriespredictions_for_season_8/
Now lets begin, my predictions are made up of my own ideas, the small amount of filming info I read, and one Leak that may not even be true:

-	After racing to Castle Black to inform Edd of Eastwatch Destruction, Tormund and Beric race on horse pack to WF to warn the Starks (and Jon once he arrives) as Edd chooses to stay and Defend the wall, him &amp; the rest of NW dies either marching too Eastwatch and trying to hold off the NKs forces or NK brings down the rest of the Wall. Meanwhile in Wintertown the citizens are in fear after feeling the ground shake knowing what it means, Bran informs the Maester to tell Jon of the wall falling once he arrives and his sisters of the people in Wintertown being scared and Arya with some Northern soldiers escort everyone (including Old Lady Mel) to WF. 
-	Gendry soon arrives informing the Starks that J&amp;D have arrived at White Harbor, Arya and Gendry then have a proper more heartfelt reunion in the crypts and bond for alittle. After metting up with Tormund &amp; Beric on the road and learning of what happened, J&amp;D arrive to WF &amp; we get reunions galore (Jon &amp; Ghost, Sam, and Stark children, Sandor and Arya &amp; Sansa, and Tyrion and Sansa) and Northerners are not pleased to see Jon with Dany and her Dragons flying above. Jon sets up a meeting to discuss a plan against AOTD and to announce Dany as there queen. The Northerners give him smack for this and both Sansa &amp; even Arya (in a twist) are not pleased (but dont worry both sisters (especially Arya) grow to like Dany). Meanwhile Cersei Miscarriages growing more mad &amp; Paranoid then ever.
-	Theon arrives at Pyke only to learn of Eurons lie via Damphair whom is dies in his arms. Theon then sails off to try and track down Euron whom is getting the Golden Company from Essos after giving Yara the Forsakened treatment and Euron gets an idea. Bronn finds Jaime in the Crossroads Inn where he explains to him he is going on his own to assemble an army to take North and is offered to tag along, He does and they get an army made up of Remaining Frey Bannermen, 300 Sellswords from the Westerlands (thanks Bronn), and Edmure &amp; his remaining Bannermen (who escaped prisonment in between season). After wards they arrive to WF with not so warm welcomes (except for Brienne and Pod) but Jaime does apologize to Bran and Jon. Jon also gets revealed the truth via Bran and Sam, With a lot of mixed emotions he decides to tell the other Starks and Dany, But before Dany can even tell him shes pregnant the horn goes off and its time for battle (also if your wondering Last hearth and Karhold was attack at this point).
-	The battle is brutal, resulting in the deaths of Ghost, Tormund, Grey Worm, Bronn, Yohn Royce, and most of the Northern Lords. Gendry also dies but is given the Kiss of Life by Beric. While that happens however Euron, Harry, and the GC surprise attack WF setting it aflame and sacking it for food, With Sansa &amp; Tyrion taken hostage &amp; Varys revealed to be a Traitor. NK arrives after Euron leaves and Mel uses her magic to hold off the NK for others to escape (even turning some dead against him) and barely escapes herself, Theon tracks down Eurons ships only to be forced to kill a Tongueless Yara in her own Reek Persona, Mel meets up with him, explains who she is, and they sail off. J&amp;D &amp; co. have fallen back to the Riverlands where Dany finally reveals she is pregnant, They decide to marry with Jon not wanting his children to be Bastards also Bran &amp; Sam head to the Gods eye to figure out how to defeat NK once and for all and Jaime, Brienne, Gendry, Pod, and Sandor are send to KL to deal with Cersei, on there way there they run into Arya &amp; gendry who are headed there for the samething (they evacuated separate from everyone else).
-	In KL Euron returns with the Golden Company (though some died in surprise attack) and Tyrion &amp; Sansa are brought to Cersei, It is revealed Tyrions deal was that her child would live and be heir to the throne if J&amp;D win, but with the miscarriage she breaks the deal and his tongue is cut out. Jaime &amp; co. make it and Arya &amp; Gendry sneak in to Euron &amp; Cerseis wedding (with Arya disguised in clothing similar to what Lyanna wore on her wedding day) to find out what has happened to Sansa &amp; Tyrion. The next day Jaime, Brienne, Pod, &amp; Sandor sneak in through the sewers while Gendry &amp; Arya get in through the front via Aryas FM skills. Harry Strickland after talking with Sansa has a change of heart &amp; lets Arya &amp; Gendry into the Red Keep, CLEGANEBOWL Sandor gets wounded badly in the fight but Arya &amp; Brienne step in &amp; finish off the Mountain as Sandor dies of his wounds. Arya almost kills Cersei but chooses family over vengeance &amp; goes to save Sansa &amp; Tyrion letting Jaime take the kill, As Harry sends some GC to Trident and kills Qyburn (Also Varys and Euron turn up missing).
-	Everyone leaves from Riverrun to the Trident where they meet up with Theon, Mel, and Tyrion &amp; the GC Harry send. As Dany goes into labour and survives giving birth to twins Jon meets with Bran &amp; Sam at the Gods Eye where Bran reveals Not only is Rhaegar Azor Ahai and Jon is Lightbringer, And that the NK is not the first WW (weather or not he is the 13th lord commander I have not decided yet) but also that the WWs have return due to a mix of Resurgence in Magic, Wanting to end the curse the Children gave them, and being threatened by the burning of Weirwood. Bran explains what he must do and how to defeat him.
-	Everyone then heads to KL, By then the AOTD is not too far away, Jon and Dany fight the NK in the skies while Arya &amp; Gendry evacuate the city and Theon with his Ironborn and GC fight Euron and his Ironborn and remaining Pro-Euron GC. NK kills Dany and Drogon and Rhaegal dies killing Undead Viserion as Jon and NK land safely near the Dragonspit where they 1v1. Varys reappears and informs Jaime of the Wildfire under the Red Keep that will cause a chain reaction destroying the whole city. Jaime races to use it as a weapon on the Wights not before confessing his love to brienne. After everyone has evacuated Jaime sets it off killing him, Varys, the Little Birds, Sept Unella, Harry Strickland, Mel, and the Wights.
-	Bran &amp; Sam arrive in time for Bran to perform a Hold the Door 2.0 on the NK weakening him, Jon puts him down and with help from Sam removes the Dragonglass from his chest killing NK, Making remaining Wights collapse, and Turning the WWs human. Afterwards everyone meets in the Dragonspit to decide whats next. Jon is elected king and his first act is melting down the Iron Throne &amp; declaring there will no longer be one ruler but multiple rulers for each kingdom, Also a Proto-Democratic Government/Republic is established and Red Priest are banished from Westeros. Tyrion is given the Westerlands, Edmure gets back Riverlands, Robin keeps the Vale, Sansa gets the North, Sam and Gilly get the Reach, New houses get Pyke and the Stormlands, A Likeable Sand Snake gets Dorne, and Bran chooses to leave beyond the former wall with the now turned human WWs. Arya along with Gendry and some Refugees sail more west (with Arya &amp; Gendry now being lovers), and Jon raises his children in KL as Ned did for him back in WF.
-	Oh and Sam write a Song of Ice and Fire. ALTERNATE ENDING: Arya and Gendry get the Crownlands and Jon decides to go back home in the North and raise his children there. Sansa kills Robin and assumes power in the vale.",9,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Watching him humiliate Tyrion, I was thinking oh I will enjoy seeing him dead.. maybe in Season 5 or 6 but Boom  it happened when I least expected it.

But whats also great about this shock is that it provokes a neo noir narration, because its still unknown who really poisoned Joffrey. 
Other than that, I feel like nearly every plot and storyline is reaching its high point to date. Im really enjoying the Arya/Clegane relationship, and Stannis and The Red Queen are more complex than ever. And in Episode 3 we got Daario Naharis get into complete beast mode.

I'm trying to decide between this and the Batman Telltale game. To break it down more:

Game of Thrones (Pros):
* It's Game of Thrones
* It costs around $6 with the Xbox Gold sale
* It's about 12 - 13 hours of game play
* It'll be a nice little content high to tide me till season 8

Game of Thrones (Cons):
* There's only one season out and it looks like it'll stay that way
* I already have a basic knowledge of most of the important bits

* Have next to no knowledge of the story

Batman (Cons):
* $10 for season one

 In the first season or two you hear much talk about how Stannis and his brother Renly have these massive armies up to about 100,000 each. After Stannis kills Renly it is implied that most of his men will then pledge allegiance to Stannis. So at this point we are looking at an army with 150,000+ right? The wildfire explosion looked like it took out 5+ of his ships at most which is absolutely nothing in the grand scheme. When they finally dock and are literally right outside the gates of kings landing it looks like Stannis has maximum a couple thousand soldiers if that. I just never have felt that they convey the gravity of the situation when it actually comes time for battle. This seems to be the theme throughout most of the show how they talk up these huge armies but when they actually show them it doesn't even look like it could be more than 5000 people. Maybe it's just me that is bothered by this sort of thing but when I think of 100,000 people coming to battle I think of something like the battle of Pelennor fields. Sorry for this stupid little rant this is my second time binging GoT I am sure it is more CGI price related than anything. I guess I just wanted to know if anyone else shared my sentiments on this.",10,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

She has basically destroyed House Lannister single handed. She put Joffrey on the throne, screwed over Tyrion to the point the events with him being tossed in the dungeons leads to what happens to the head of the House (Tywin). Looking back, pretty much everything that has destroyed this House comes back to Cersei.

I briefly thought she just wanted to be queen, but quickly realized that wasnt the case, because many of the terrible choices she was making happened well before her being queen seemed at all plausible (she clearly didnt intend to have what happened to Joffrey, Tommen, and Myrcella happen), she didnt expect Tyrion to survive the dungeons, and it just doesnt make sense she would destroy her own House, the sept (which means a fair deal to quite a few people), and completely destroy another House (Tyrell) which were allies to her own (nobody is going to trust her or make an alliance with her after that). After destroying House Lannister, she doesnt seem to have anyone that would truly be loyal, and back her. Even if she found an ally, they would only back her out of fear, and they would almost certainly abandon her the moment any other suitable choice presents itself. The list of ridiculously asinine things Cersei does goes on and on.

I understand making mistakes, but almost every single thing she does seems to be a mistake, to the point it seems intentional. Do you think she wanted to destroy House Lannister, or do you think she just had no idea what shes doing? If you think it was intentional, why?",24,11,False,spoiler,,,,,

We go to Melissandre and the Lord of the Light gang in Volantis, she convinces them to join her in the fight against the dead, they sail to Westeroes. (I am unsure whether Kinvara will return).
We now go to King's Landing, Cersei does have her miscarriage, she starts to get emotional but dosen't show it similar to how she reacted to Tommen's death, this is the moment when she decends into complete madness.
We see Jaime Lanninster on his travel to Winterfell, he is accompanied by Bronn, they stop for a while and talk, soon they continue their travels.
We see Euron Grejoy arriving in Essos to collect the Golden Company, he and Harry personalities clash, but the GC agree to help him and Cersei in the war's to come.
We do not see any of the boat travel to White Harbour, we see Jon, Dany and the rest of the crew looking at Winterfell from the stop Arya was.

take a look

[Baratheon sigil over kingslanding](https://i.redd.it/zzkw3sn2axb11.jpg)

in her coronation scene, qyburn proclaimed her as ***""cersei of house lannister"".***

also, cersei had replaced all the stag sigils in kingslanding with lion sigils.

its evident in season 7, everywhere in castle of KL, we see lion sigils. Also, the baratheon sigil in the throne room has been replaced. so by all means, she has established her tyranny in the name of house lannister.

remember the showrunners replaced the bolton sigil  with stark wolf after the battle of bastards in episode ten within season 6.

but why does they still keep showing the baratheon sigil above KL?

they had an entire season to edit and make changes. so by no way, it was a mistake. by the start of season 7, cersei had established her tyranny in the name of house lannister. so why did they still insist of keeping the stag sigil above KL? all through season 7?

remember that officially house baratheon is extinct with the death of tommen( and to some extent with the death of stannis) and the one remaining member is gendry, an unknown bastard whose heritage is not even recognised by the public.

so my instinct tells me that they are doing it on purpose. there's a hidden reason why they are still insisting on putting the stag sigil of an ""extinct"" house baratheon over KL. probably it would be revealed in season 8.

some speculations  include that somehow gendry would end up on the iron throne.

others say that gendry was never a bastard, but he is actually the trueborn son of robert and cersei all this time, hence the showrunners insist on showing the ""extinct"" house baratheon sigil on KL. 

i am not sure, gendry being son of robert and cersei sounds like a logical explanation why they still show the stag sigil over KL, like a foreshadowing.

watch out for surprises in season 8.

as it turns out, most actors and actresses in interviews are saying that ending of season 8 would turn out to be *""an unpredictable ending"".*

guess ""unpredictable"" is becoming the new ""bittersweet"".

or will it be an ""unpredictably bittersweet ending?""

Jorah,Tyrion, Davos are skeptical, Daenarys is concerned that the Northern lords will dissapprove.
Jon gets sight of Arya and Bran, but dosen't get a chance to properly reunite because their called into the grand hall of Winterfell. Immediately Jon is welcomed back, and tell's his followers in Winterfell about what happened inculding the events of Beyond The Wall.     
Sansa gives Daenarys dirty looks as do the Northerns. They say they are obligated to Jon Snow, and refuse to fight for Dany, she gives a speech but received little to no sympathy. Jon also gives a speech, the Northerns Reluctantly decided to fight with Daenarys. 
We see sir Jaime and Bronn travelling, they arrive at the Twins to see if any fighting men are left, but there are only women. They continue their trip North.
The Golden Company have arrived in King's Landing alongside Euron. 
In the Throne Room peasants have arrived pleading their case to Cersei, Cersei treats them with no sympathy and has ser Gregor kill them, Euron and Harry Skrictland walk in moments after and Cersei greets them. Cersei says she is happy to have the Golden Company on herside, she decides to send them North to lanuch a sneak attack on Winterfell. 
Theon and his force arrive at the Iron Islands, they expect Euron to be here with Yara, but they are disappointed to find nothing but a few fishermen, they say Euron has not been back to the Iron Islands, he has fooled Theon.
Jon eventully reunites with Sansa. And then Arya, their reunion is emotional, they trade stories and Jon points out Arya still has Needle. Jon moves onto to reunite with Bran, Jon is let down as he notices Bran has changed since he became the The Three Eyed Raven, Sam is also with Bran and reunites with Jon. Bran decided not to tell anyone about the wall falling and Viserion, but he tells Jon, Jon is very concerned. Bran is about to tell Jon about the truth about Rhaeghar and Lyanna but there is a knock on the door, Jon is needed by Daenarys. Daenerys expresses her concerns about not being liked by the Northerns. She tells Jon about the pregnancy, Jon is shocked and excited at the same time.
The final scene of this episode is the Night King attacking either Karhold or The Last Hearth, i don't know which he will attack first, but what happens is the same as my first episode, the castle people prepare to leave, they heard the sound of Viserion in the distance, they barely have a chance to look up before Viserion breathes his fire and obliterates them. Surprisingly we see Hodor march with the army of the dead alongside members of the Night's Watch. the final shot we see Alice Karstark/ Ned Umber's eyes turn blue as the camera fades.

My three in order are 

3. Death of Hodor

2. Arya leaving the Hound to die 

1. The sacrifice of Shireen Baratheon 

Poor Hodor. Loyally served and protected Bran and his friends for nearly the entire series, even on a practical suicide mission beyond the wall, before sacrificing himself to ensure their safety. Didnt deserve such a horrible death at the hands of the wights. 

Hated watching Arya and the Hound separate as they were my absolute favourite story arc. Very powerful and heart wrenching scene between them as it had become clear they now cared quite a bit about each other, with the Hound stating he was watching over her and protecting her, and Arya being unable to bring herself to kill him despite his goading to put him out of his misery. I was relieved to have him return as he is without a doubt my favourite character. 

Shireens death though, is just outright disturbing, I found it very difficult to watch the first time through. The ear-piercing screams are too much. Especially since I thought she was a very kind and helpful to those around her, not to mention being just a child. Her relationship with Davos is great, so its heartbreaking to see how much it affected him. ",46,20,False,spoiler,,,,,

(Part 1).,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/91ldqm/spoilers_season_8_episode_2_outline_predictions/,keithohara,1532466188,"This will be by far the longest episode yet in the entire series, almost 2 hours long, I understand if people find this as controversial opinions. As this is gonna be a very long episode it will be split into two parts.

The episode opens up with a shot of Harry leading the Golden Company north, they are not far out from Winterfell. Torumnd and Beric arrive and have accidentally revealed the Night King and Viserion destroying the Wall, as Jon as not told the Northerns yet. Everyone in the castle starts to panic, as panic arrives their is a two men walking through the door, the Northerns don't recongise Jaime and Bronn but Jon and Daenarys do. The Northerns are aggravated they want Jaime killed, he is called into the Great Hall, Jaime tells Jon Cersei is not sending men North to help in the great war. Jon and Daenarys are pissed. As Jaime is judged, a horn is sounded they presume it's the army of the dead, but no it is the Golden Company, this is a very minor battle no major characters die to the Golden Company. Jon and Harry have a stare down and eventully a battle as they battle they hear the horn again, they're both shiting themselves, especially Harry because Cersei and Euron never told them about the AOTD. Harry decides to betray Cersei and declared for Jon. 
The Great War has now begun.
Jon dosen't want Dany going on the battlefield because of the baby, but she says she has to if they want to defeat the AOTD. Everyone puts their beefs beyond them and agree to fight together, surprisingly the NK only has 5-10k wights lead their charged to Winterfell, they defeat the wights, but lose a couple of hundred of men in the process, the Night King is saving his army for one big attack. The Golden Company think they've defeated the AOtD, because they've don't about the 100k numbers.
All of a sudden a White Walker gives the nod and thosuands of Wight advance towards Winterfell. Tyrion, Sam, Bran and Sansa and Arya are kept inside the crpyts so they can escape incase things turn badly. Arya wants to fight but Jon won't let her. This is when Gendry appears from the shadows and says potentially goodbye to Arya as he steps onto the battlefield. Bran immediately goes into vision mode, and tries to turn the tide in the living'a favour. 
The Dothairiki and the Unsuilled are overwhelmed by the AOTD, and most of them are killed. As the wights attack attack prespectives are changing. In comes the Night King on Viserion, Jon sees a vacant Rhaeghal and hopes on as Daenarys hopes on Drogon. There is gonna be a a battle in the skies. Arya sneaks her way onto the battlefield. Melissandre's and the followers of the Lord of the Light have arrived at Winterfell but are too late, They head into the castle through the back away from the battling, Davos sees Melissandre and confronts her, she is willingly to die but says she will be useful in the fight. Davos agrees to keep her alive as the Lord of the light followers steps into the battlefield. Thosuands have died at this point between the two armies. As Jon and Daenarys are burning the AOTD, whilst the Night King burns their army, eventully they come face to face, Jon tells Daenarys to take the AOTD, And Jon will battle the Night King. The Night's King's has come prepared and has more of those javelins, Daenarys is unaware of this and Drogon is vulnerable. As the White Walker prepares to take out Drogon incomes GreyWorm and stabs the Walker in the back, Greyworm dosen't have time to turn around before he is stabbed in the back by a wight. Missandei has no way of knowing GreyWorm is dead. 
The White Walker left a scream, similar to what happened when Sam killed the WW, Dany sees GreyWorm's death and immediately rushes in for revenge but figures fire cannot kill the White Walkers. 
The undead Giants arrive and crush tons of men, but Tormund steps in and kills a giant with multiple dagger stabs.
Viserion continues cause problems,
until Daenarys get involved in the battle, Jon and The Night King's dragon breath fire at each other, This is the true battle of Ice and Fire. Viserion is starting to get ahead, as Jon is standing in a straight position he is easily hit by a icespear as Rhagehal falls incomes Dany with an overwhelming amount of force from Drogon she is able to kill Viserion, but Drogon is hurt in the meantime, Drogon is the last dragon. Viserion has been slayed and Jon and The Night King return back to their armies.

1976,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-7-25,2018,7,25,6,91ldyo,self.gameofthrones,[Spoilers] Season 8 episode 3 outline predictions. Feedback please.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/91ldyo/spoilers_season_8_episode_3_outline_predictions/,keithohara,1532466232,"This will be by far the longest episode yet in the entire series, almost 2 hours long, I understand if people find this as controversial opinions. As this is gonna be a very long episode it will be split into two parts.

The episode opens up with a shot of Harry leading the Golden Company north, they are not far out from Winterfell. Torumnd and Beric arrive and have accidentally revealed the Night King and Viserion destroying the Wall, as Jon as not told the Northerns yet. Everyone in the castle starts to panic, as panic arrives their is a two men walking through the door, the Northerns don't recongise Jaime and Bronn but Jon and Daenarys do. The Northerns are aggravated they want Jaime killed, he is called into the Great Hall, Jaime tells Jon Cersei is not sending men North to help in the great war. Jon and Daenarys are pissed. As Jaime is judged, a horn is sounded they presume it's the army of the dead, but no it is the Golden Company, this is a very minor battle no major characters die to the Golden Company. Jon and Harry have a stare down and eventully a battle as they battle they hear the horn again, they're both shiting themselves, especially Harry because Cersei and Euron never told them about the AOTD. Harry decides to betray Cersei and declared for Jon. 
The Great War has now begun.
Jon dosen't want Dany going on the battlefield because of the baby, but she says she has to if they want to defeat the AOTD. Everyone puts their beefs beyond them and agree to fight together, surprisingly the NK only has 5-10k wights lead their charged to Winterfell, they defeat the wights, but lose a couple of hundred of men in the process, the Night King is saving his army for one big attack. The Golden Company think they've defeated the AOtD, because they've don't about the 100k numbers.
All of a sudden a White Walker gives the nod and thosuands of Wight advance towards Winterfell. Tyrion, Sam, Bran and Sansa and Arya are kept inside the crpyts so they can escape incase things turn badly. Arya wants to fight but Jon won't let her. This is when Gendry appears from the shadows and says potentially goodbye to Arya as he steps onto the battlefield. Bran immediately goes into vision mode, and tries to turn the tide in the living'a favour. 
The Dothairiki and the Unsuilled are overwhelmed by the AOTD, and most of them are killed. As the wights attack attack prespectives are changing. In comes the Night King on Viserion, Jon sees a vacant Rhaeghal and hopes on as Daenarys hopes on Drogon. There is gonna be a a battle in the skies. Arya sneaks her way onto the battlefield. Melissandre's and the followers of the Lord of the Light have arrived at Winterfell but are too late, They head into the castle through the back away from the battling, Davos sees Melissandre and confronts her, she is willingly to die but says she will be useful in the fight. Davos agrees to keep her alive as the Lord of the light followers steps into the battlefield. Thosuands have died at this point between the two armies. As Jon and Daenarys are burning the AOTD, whilst the Night King burns their army, eventully they come face to face, Jon tells Daenarys to take the AOTD, And Jon will battle the Night King. The Night's King's has come prepared and has more of those javelins, Daenarys is unaware of this and Drogon is vulnerable. As the White Walker prepares to take out Drogon incomes GreyWorm and stabs the Walker in the back, Greyworm dosen't have time to turn around before he is stabbed in the back by a wight. Missandei has no way of knowing GreyWorm is dead. 
The White Walker left a scream, similar to what happened when Sam killed the WW, Dany sees GreyWorm's death and immediately rushes in for revenge but figures fire cannot kill the White Walkers. 
The undead Giants arrive and crush tons of men, but Tormund steps in and kills a giant with multiple dagger stabs.
Viserion continues cause problems,
until Daenarys get involved in the battle, Jon and The Night King's dragon breath fire at each other, This is the true battle of Ice and Fire. Viserion is starting to get ahead, as Jon is standing in a straight position he is easily hit by a icespear as Rhagehal falls incomes Dany with an overwhelming amount of force from Drogon she is able to kill Viserion, but Drogon is hurt in the meantime, Drogon is the last dragon. Viserion has been slayed and Jon and The Night King return back to their armies.
The end of part 1 of the battle of Winterfell.

Feedback appreciated",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/91mb8a/spoilers_season_8_episode_3_part_2_fanfiction/,keithohara,1532473103,"This is part 2 of episode 3. The battle between the Living and the dead.

Daenarys is escorted inside the walls of Winterfell, she is very concerned about Drogon who is laying outside the walls, she is greeted inside by Melissandre, Tyrion and Sam head out of the crypts to see who it is, they call Dany over but she does not want to abandon Jon and all her fighting men. We see a line of our characters, Jon in the center, To the side  of him we have Jaime,Tormund,Brienne,The Hound,Arya,Gendry,Jorah,Beric,Bronn,Harry. They nod at each other ad this may be the last time they are together, Bran wargs into the undead Hodor, as he as all ready once he can do it again, Hodor wipes out some of the undead army and clears a path,Jon and the crew advance forward, but a wall of White Walkers are blocking them, They all kill the White Walkers expect for Beric who steps in to save Gendry, unfortunately Beric gets stabbed protecting Gendry. This is Beric's last life so he cant come back, his final sight is the Hound looking at him as he dies. 1 Giant is still standing and wipe out men quickly. Jon and his colleagues are surrounded by wights similar to how the Bolton's surrounds them, as the wights prepare to attack Lady Melissandre steps into the frey, Melissandre has her hands on fire and steps and clears the horde. There is now a clear path to the Night King, the Night King knows Jon is the one who needs to kill him so he allows him through, If Jon defeats the Night King he will defeat the AOTD, if the Night King wins the dead will overwhelm the rest of the North and South. Jon has a stare-down with the Night King almost as-long as the Hard Home stare-down, the Night King is using his infamous Spear as his weapon and Jon is using LongClaw. The Battle Begins. At first, it is an even battle, eventually the Night King starts to gain control and stabs Jon in the leg, this isn't enough to keep Jon down. As the battle is going on we go into Bran's vison, we find out that the Night King must be killed with a flaming sword, a valyrian steel sword or dragonglass weapon will not kill him, unless it is flamed, Jon begins to gain the momentum, after about 15 exchanges The Night King uses his supernatural strength to push Jon backwards, Jon is hurt but must continue fighting, Jon returns to the battle, there is no clear domiant weapon so Jon starts to use his fists to keep the Night King away, but the Night King reacts first and hits Jon with a fist to the face, Jon is laying on the ground almost unconscious as the Night King goes to finish Jon he sticks his sword up in defence his sword turn to fire, The Night King cannot penetrate enough strength to break through the sword, Jon pulls a dragonglass dagger out of his pocket and stabs the Nk, this dosen't kill the Night King but it is slowly starting to damage him more and more. Jon is strong enough to knock down the Night King's weapon and has one last look at the Night King before he is shattered to ice. Suddenly every wight and White Walker shatters completely, as the Night King is responsible for turning all of them.
The episodes ends with Jon returning to the caste, and kissing Dany, At this moment there are several reunions, Jaime and Brienne, Jaime and Tyrion, Melissandre and Davos even get on. The camera zooms away from Winterfell as the aftermath is shown.

I finally finished watching Season 4 of Game of Thrones.

This have been 10 hours of pure joy, and arguably the most invested I ever was in a TV show. Why is Season 4 my favorite Season to date?  
Simple. Because it has everything I dreamed it would have. There was no filler. Every episode delivered and that is ultimately what I found so great. For me ""The Lion and The Rose"" is ""Rains of Castamere"" level. The pure level of joy I had with Joeffrey the son of a bitch dying is inexplicable. It happened when it needed to happen, and it was perfect.   
What's even better is that I never found any plot elements to be boring. Normally I never cared about the Goldie/Sam angle, but I actually found it quite okay here. Arya/Clengan angle was very interesting, as is Baelish/Sansa, a relationship I really want to see. Tyrion's monologue at the end of ""The Laws of Gods and Men"" is one of the most powerful scenes in the whole show. I loved the direction they went with Jaime, he actually became one of my favorite characters, although he was one of my most hated in Season One. Dario Naharis is a great addition for Daenerys, of which I really hope gets bit more straightforward in the next season (I really want to see some battles with Dragons), but really. t the end of the day the clear show stealer was Jon Snow, who became my favorite character (even out trumping Tyrion).

  
And then it happened, my favorite GoT episode to date: The Watchers on The Wall. For the most part I never really cared about the conflict with the people in North, but this wasn't only storytelling at its finest with many interesting plot points/elements, but also one of the best battle scenes I have ever seen. It may not completely compare with The Battle of Helm's Deep, but it's damn near close. The pure amount of innovation is astonishing. And there were fucking Giants! On a fucking Mammoth!! I have never been more invested in a Television episode (well maybe at Hannibal Season 2 Episode 13).

I really have nothing to complain about. Yes, maybe Daenerys character arch isn't as interesting until now, and I really want to see more of the White Walkers, but these are minor complaints. Everything works. Every actor delivers. Every character shines. Every plot point is straight forward. Every hint is brilliant. Every episode is worth rewatching. I have never given a TV season the full 10/10, but if there's one Season deemed perfect, it's this one.

It may or may not be real but the plot leak for season 7 (coming from the same source) was accurate. I have to admit I do regret reading it (thinking it was another entertaining phony plot leak) and I came here to discuss about it. I linked the video below but here are a few key pointers.
- Cersei plans to use wildfire and kill dany but Jamie (who has been taken captive) strangles her to death when they meet in his cell. (Episode 4)
- euron becomes king but eventually flees with captive jamie when dany flies over to burn kings landing when she finds out euron executed jorah, theon and yara
- Bran is the night king. He tried to go back in time to stop the creation of the night king and warged into a man to tell to stop the children of the forest. Turns out the man he warged into was the about-to-be first white walker and the night king. He eventually gets turned into the night king and irl bran gets stuck in vision mode (with the white eyes).
- John kills bran to kill the night king
- dany dies giving birth to their daughter Lyanna
- John rules but spreads the west into independant kingdoms
- euron and jamie who has escaped are presumably dead but could be the start of a spinoff series
- key people who didnt die include sansa arya jon tyrion brienne
I really dont know what to make of this but I hope it isnt true because that would mean Id have to watch season 8 knowing whats gonna happen.

Other fun ones are Tully from anglicized irish meaning 'descendant of Taithleach'; entailing traits like 'calm' 

Tyrell is derived from french *tirer* and apparently meant stubborn

Martell comes from latin ""Martellus"", or hammer. So basically a smith name.

Frey comes from middle german ""vri"" (free)

So anyways I believe at some point Jon will meet Bran &amp; Sam at the God's eye where Bean reveals not only is Jon's father Rhaegar TPTWP (with Jon being lightbringer), but also he reveals the WW's have returned due to a combination of resurgence in magic, Jon's birth, wanting to end the curse the children put on them all those years ago, and them being threatened by the burning of Weirwood's.

Sam also tells Jon he has to accept you he is, Jon decides he is a Stark AND a Targaryen and flies off on Rhaegal to KL. Everyone is at KL (Cersei is already taken care of by this point) and the wights are near KL. Jon and Dany are fighting NK in the sky, NK and Viserion kill Dany and Drogon and Rhaegal dies killing Viserion. They land at either the Dragonspits or the God's Eye and 1v1 there. Bran then weakens the NK via warging him or winning in a battle of minds or doing a hold the door 2.0 on him. Either way he is weakened long enough for Jon to remove the Dragonglass from his chest.

Making the wights collapse and turning the WW's back human as NK dies a mortal man. Anyways a Proto-Democratic Government/Republic is established with there no longer being one ruler but multiple rulers for each kingdom. Tyrion gets Westerlands, Edmure gets the Riverlands, Robin keeps the Vale, Sam gets the Reach, A likeable Sand Snake gets Dorne, and new houses get Pyke and Stormlands. Sansa gets the North and both Arya and Gendry decide to sail to land more west together.

Jon gets the Crownlands and raises his twin children on his own and Sam writes the Song of Ice and Fire. The bittersweet ending is that the war was won but at a great cost as Westeros was left in ruin and Jon lost yet another lover. However If Sansa dies then Arya gets the North with gendry taking the stark name or Arya and Gendry get the Crownlands with Jon ruling the north.",5,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

2058,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2018-7-26,2018,7,26,3,91upna,self.gameofthrones,[SPOILERS] I think the Night King is a lot smarter than we think and might be connected to the Lord of Light.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/91upna/spoilers_i_think_the_night_king_is_a_lot_smarter/,poub06,1532545096,"Alright guys, put ont your tin foil hat, I've thought about something while re-watching ""Beyond the wall"".

I thought it was weird that The Hound saw the mountain with the arrowhead in a vision, which is where everyone ended up being trap by the Night King, and where the Night King got his dragon. So I wondered, what if the Night King actually had planned everyting and is connected to the Lord Light..

The Night King wanted one thing: to destroyed the Wall. In order to do that, he needed a dragon. And in order to have a dragon, he needed what have happened in the episode ""Beyond the wall"": Daenerys come flying with the dragons to save Jon.

So, firstable, Daenerys and Jon needed to meet. They met, because Melisandre, whose actions are dictated by visions in the flames, told Daenerys to send a raven to Winterfell.

Why was Melisandre in the south ? Because, Jon forced her to leave, when he learned about what she did to Shireen, which is what the Lord of Light asked.

And this happened, because she saw a vision in the flames in season 3, that told her to go North with Stannis, and especially, Davos who, as she said, has a role to play. (He's the reason Melisandre was exiled from the North)

So, the Lord of Light brought Daenarys and Jon together, to fight the dead, or to give TNK what he needed...

The reason why I think TNK is behind all of this, is because I think that he is a lot smarter than we think and that he actually planned everything. The visions in the flames seem to have lead to what happened in ""Eastmarch"", and what happened in this episode seem to have been planned by The Night King since Day 1, in order to cross the wall.

Everytime the army of the dead attacked the Night Watch, they let someone escaped. In the first episode, they let Will run away, in the season 2, they saw Sam and kept him alive. At Hardhome, they only attacked once Jon was there and they didn't kill him, even when the white walker had the opportunity to. Jon lost his sword, and the WW just pushed him down, while he killed the Thenn the second he had the chance. Why ? Because he needed Jon to know how big of a threat the army of the dead is.

So, Jon Snow' focus is on the army of the dead, and he met Daenarys. Now, it's time to bring the group North of the Wall and trapped them.

So, there's the vision of the mountain with the arrowhead, and Bran sees TNK at this exact same spot. TNK is actually baiting them. He want Jon and the group to come behind the wall and it worked. Then, they must trapped them there to force Daenarys to come, so TNK send a small group of wights just in front of the location he wanted them. When Jon and the others start the attack, they charged at them, not to kill them, to trapped them. You can see wights running ahead of Jon and the others, because they wanted to surround them. And then, they waited. The White Walkers could have easily killed them, why are they waiting ? For the dragon. Which is why they came prepared with their ice javelin and probably their chains too.

Finally, the magic behind the dragons returned soon after the White Walkers appeared. So, it's possible that the Night King is also behind this.

Now, the Night King has his dragon and is ready to fuck Westeros big time.

TL;DR: The Night King is a lot smarter than we think, and he planned everything since the beginning to cross the wall.",29,51,False,spoiler,,,,,

""The door' episode I think has some insight to how the show will play out. When Bran becomes the 3 eye raven he see Aerys Targaryen saying ""burn them all"". What the show leads us to believe is he is saying burn Tywin and his army with the city, but what I think he is truly saying is burn the wights because Bran speaks to him through his mind which ultimately drives the mad king crazy. I believe that bran inspire the mad king to mass produce wild fire not to kill The mad king initial enemy's, but for the future war to come against the Night King. 

Also, I believe that Gendry is actually Cersy first born son. Now I am not certain how Gendry became a orphan and also, if Cercy is even is aware that he is even alive. I also believe that Cersy and Jamie are really the Children of Aerys. The book hints that Aerys made comments to Tywin that he would sleep with with his wife. Now when I read that my first thoughts were that Tyrion was the son of Aerys because of Tywins distaste for him and the remarks that he wasnt sure he was his even his son, and also the dragons didnt devourer him on sight when he release the 2 remaining dragons in the dungeons in meereen. Another reason why I think Jamie and Cercy are indeed Targaryens is the saying that it's a flip of a coin that a Targaryen will be crazy. Now cercy is clearly mad, and Jamie has a moral code and compassion for people. These 2 theory of Gendry and Cercy would mean that Gendry is the rightful heir to the throne. Not only is he the first born of Robert Baretheon which Baretheon are Descendants of Targaryen, but his mother is a Targaryen which would give him a edge over Jon for the throne. 

I also believe that Gendry is Azor ahai and Jon is the prince that is Promise. In the books it was said that Azor ahai was a Black smith. The only Black smith on the show is Gendry. Now in the books it has been said that Azor ahai and the prince that is promise isnt necessary the same person. So I believe Gendry will produce the sword to Jon and Jon will Pludge Dany in the heart to ignite LightBringer. 

Now I will end this with a Vague conclusion. The Night king will drive Jon and his forces all the way down to Kingslanding, and where ultimately jon will decide to Sacrifice himself and his Army with the Wild fire that Aerys was instructed by Bran to produce. Leaving Gendry as the Ruler of the ashes. Now I have more thoughts of how Arya, Jamie, Cercy, and ect character will play out, but I feel that that Gendry and Jon are the 2 most important characters when the show finishes. Also I know I am not the first to come up with all this theory because when I thought of them I did a Google search and seen some of these theorys, but everything I have said was all thoughts that came to me by over analyzing the show when i rewatch them.

Anyway, here goes...

Sansa Stark and Dolorous Edd. 

If you havent immediately left this post yet, let me explain my thinking. 

First things first, Jonsa is not a real possibility, nor do I want it to be, for the record. 

I really do love the idea of Sansa realizing she does not need a man in her life to be happy. I would love to see her fully transition from being a girl who fantasized about marrying the handsome prince to truly seeing just what awful things those handsome princes can do and growing into an independently powerful leader. Still, as a Sansa fan and a bit of a romantic, Id like to see her actually find someone to be happy with too.  Just like her father, Jon, and Robb, there are good men, but unfortunately she only really encountered the worst of the worst and she ended up being manipulated, abused, and raped instead. Her views on men and possibly people in general are probably not great, and reasonably so. 

So how does Edd fit in? I was watching an episode in Season 6 (4, I believe) where there was a quiet moment at the table when Sansa, Jon, Edd, Brienne, Tormund, etc., are eating, and Edd apologizes for the state of the food, and Sansa smiles and says there are more important things. We see just the hint of a smile on Edds face  one of the only times we ever see one! Then it all clicked. 

Edd is good and honest. He is one of Jons best friends. As far as we know, he does not torture people like Joffrey, manipulate like Littlefinger, or abuse women like Ramsay he escaped from the mutiny at Crasters Keep, for instance, and didnt just stay there like the some of the others to rape and beat Crasters daughters. Basically, he is loyal and uncomplicated, the same qualities her father and brothers shared. He is not traditionally handsome, no, but hes not half bad and he would treat Sansa with respect. 

I even think Sansa would appreciate his dark sense of humor, especially after everything she has gone through. She also needs a calm, simple presence to keep her from going full on power hungry, and she could for once have a healthy relationship. In turn, I think she could bring out perhaps a gentler side of Edd that we have never seen before, like the moment at the dinner table. 

Why I think this could (although probably wont) happen:

He is Lord Commander now. Assuming he lives to the end (which, unfortunately, Im doubting), it would be a good idea to be friends with the Wardeness of the North, which is where Im predicting Sansa will end up. The Nights Watch is not supposed to be politically involved, but having the support of a powerful Northern family would be useful in supplying men, food, weapons, etc., for the Wall. Even if the humans win against the white walkers, Im guessing the Nights Watch will be needing a lot more men by the time this is all over, and they may want to even start manning more castles in case the threat ever comes back. And what better way to build a strong alliance than through a marriage, say, to the Wardeness of the North, and the person who can easily supply you with all of those things?

But, average_fish, you say, men of the Nights Watch cannot get married. No, not right now, but if things go how I think they will, with Jon ultimately ending up on the iron throne, this theory notwithstanding, I feel like he would allow the Nights Watch, Kingsguard, and maesters to marry, especially after growing up ostracized as a bastard (more marriage theoretically means there will be less out of wedlock children), his own experiences with love, and people like Sam, who are in love but have to hide it because of their vows. Im not quite sure how it would work logistically (Can criminals at the wall get married? Where will wives/children stay?) but I definitely can see that happening. 

Anyway, thats my idea. Its nuts, but I just had to get it out there. It hinges on a lot of different things happening, and I doubt it would ever happen because its just so random, but I would love for these two to get a happy ending. ",9,16,False,spoiler,,,,,

Most everyone that Ive heard talk about this says it is happening in real time. What about Bran seeing this in the future? This would make sure that the armies of the living will defend the right part of the wall instead of sending troops to castle black or wherever.

I remember the first watch through, hating Walder Frey with a passion, and being so shocked and saddened at the Red Wedding. But going back through it, and leading up to the Rains of Castamere, I was absolutely sickened by Robb Stark's actions and character. He was such an idiot and I found myself actually rooting for Frey to just kill the stupid SoB. 
He makes and breaks his promise to marry his daughter, with the corniest love storyline ever. 
 He then tucks himself over by killing Karstark. Losing half of his forces in the process.
Because he made that decision, he now needs help AGAIN for Lord Frey, and fully expects him to forgive and forget, AND HELP him win a losing battle.
 He bullied his uncle into marrying the Frey girl, expecting his uncle to fix his screw up.
He lost Winterfell because he trusted Theon not to screw him over.
He brings his wife (the symbol of his betrayal) to meet Lord Frey, being cocky and stupid. Not expecting any backlash.
Attends the wedding and after being shot by arrows, his mother begs him to leave and offers up her own life after ALL of his mistakes, but he just sits there with tears in his eyes and refuses to even try to escape. Not thinking of his mother who would surely be killed, or the siblings still out there who will surely be in danger of paying for his war.
After the wedding, Roose even makes a comment about Robb saying: ""He ignored my council at every turn, if he'd only been a trifle less arrogant.."" 


By the time he FINALLY got shot with arrows, I was almost cheering. And when he was holding his stupid dead wife he gave up everything for who got stabbed, I was almost happy. Robb Stark was a failure and upon review of the series, he made countless mistakes that I feel made him deserve  the events of the Red Wedding. I hate Robb Stark and I think he is insufferable. He deserved everything he got and he is an idiot who brought alot of grief to his family by being arrogant and stupid. I was kind of shocked that I came to this realization, due to the complete 180 I took from watching it the first time. I am glad Robb is dead and I can 100% empathize with Walder Frey. I still love Arya, Sansa and Jon tho.

baratheon sigil over kingslanding in SEASON 7

see the pic above?? its a stag sigil over kingslanding in the opening credits, **in season 7**.

we all know that when cersei began her tyranny, she was proclaimed as ***""cersei of house lannister"".***

she then proceeded to remove all symbols of house baratheon and replaced it with lannister lion as is evident in season 7. and all members of house baratheon are dead, save a bastard who is not even recognized in the wider public.

yet the showrunners still chose to put the stag sigil over kingslanding in the opening credits instead of lannister lion.

makes it all the more mysterious. some say it was out of laziness. how can that be when the showrunners had time to replace the bolton sigil with the stark one, in two consecutive episodes within a single season? yet why didnt they replace the stag sigil even though they had one full year, enough time and a whole season to run?

this is why it is an **easter egg**. it is no error from the part of the showrunners. rather, it is a clue given by the showrunners to solve a puzzle for those who are keen observers.

now what does this really signify??

house baratheon is ""extinct"" we are told. and we are told that the only remnant of house baratheon is an unrecognised ""bastard"" who goes by the name gendry. ( gentry means highborn, pun intended?)

if that was the case, then the stag sigil doesnt make sense. it should be expelled into obscurity like the rest of house baratheon.

however, the fact that they still show stag sigil implies that house baratheon is very much alive.

for gendry was not a bastard, all this time, he was actually the trueborn son of robert and cersei. hence, the significance of baratheon sigil over the capital of westeros.

this theory makes perfect sense why the stag sigil is shown in KL.

for those who **say that the maggy the frog prophecy stipulates/limits cersei's children to 3** see this link below:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8wzwhn/spoilers\_maggy\_the\_frog\_prophesy\_loophole/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8wzwhn/spoilers_maggy_the_frog_prophesy_loophole/)

also this theory makes an amazing parallel with of the roses. check the link

[https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8x84x2/spoliers\_war\_of\_the\_roses\_theory/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8x84x2/spoliers_war_of_the_roses_theory/)

now the real reason why they actually put the baratheon sigil over KL could be that cersei would be ruling on behalf of gendry after all. we have to understand the mental state of cersei. she lost her 3 kids in the game of thrones. she is a fierce mother, and is unwilling to put the life of her only remaining son at stake; especially when she is surrounded by enemies. so she decides to take the throne for herself, eliminate all her enemies, and then when the job is done, she could reveal his true identity and proclaim him the king. so this makes perfect sense why they would put the stag sigil above KL.

as a side note, this also explains why cersei promised to marry the brotherkiller euron, ***""after the war is won.""***since she plans to step down from the iron throne and make gendry the king when she wins the war, the iron throne is safe from eurons manipulations. thus she was able to get two shots with one move, ensuring the loyalty of the deicisive ironborn fleet and also ensure her security since her son is now king and she no longer needs to fear harm from euron if she marries him.

also the secret deal between tyrion and cersei might actually be to make gendry the king. for more details on what actually might have happened in their secret meeting, check the link below

[https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/comments/8y86pi/what\_really\_happened\_at\_tyrion\_cersei\_secret/](https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/comments/8y86pi/what_really_happened_at_tyrion_cersei_secret/)

some might ask: *""why did cersei abandon gendry in the first place?""*

answer is simple: **robert used to rape cersei**. gendry was a child born out of rape. not all mothers would want grow up a child that symbolises one of the most horrific incidents in their life. in the case of cersei, her husband robert hated her, used to pour wine over her, raped her and came to her in bed and screamed ""lyanna"", ""lyanna"" moaning over the loss of his true love. as a result, cersei grew up to hate him so hard and she decided not to share an offspring with him.

another question is: *""how noone realised that cersei was pregnant? how could she abandon him so easily?""*

answer: ***nobody said that*** noone realised cersei was pregnant. infact, ofcourse people were aware of her pregnancy. the trick lies in how she abandoned gendry. she swapped gendry for a similar looking dead baby and gave up gendry to another woman, possibly with jaime's help. as cersei told ned in the books , "" ***jaime found a woman to cleanse me of it***""

*so what happened to gendry after cersei abandoned him?*

ans: after cersei abandoned gendry, later on her motherly instincts resurged and she began to feel remorse over what she did. however, it was too late by then. she could not take gendry back, for if she revealed what she did, the lives of her incestous children and her own would be at stake. so she decided to let him be in the slums. **in the books, cersei used to sneak out as a tavernwench to visit the slums of kingslanding, the same slums where gendry grew up.** gendry himself had stated that his mother was a tavernwench.

*how did gendry end up with tobho mott, the most famous blacksmith in westeros?*

in [http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Gendry](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Gendry) it states

&gt;***When he was old enough, an unknown lord paid his apprentice fee so he could learn to be a blacksmith.***

also in [https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Gendry](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Gendry) it states

&gt;***When Gendry was old enough, an unknown lord paid his apprentice fee so he could learn to be a blacksmith***

*who is this ""unknown lord""?*

some say its varys, but that is pure ridiculous. varys may have made contact with a few other bastards of robert, but that was becuase they were known. gendry on the other hand, was a literal unknown until jon arryn finds him years later. before jon visited gendry, he was a total nobody and noone seemed to think he was of any significance. this *""unknown lord""* might well be a character ( most probably jaime, since he is a knight as well) under cersei's orders. why would anybody want a poor nobody in the slums to learn smithing from the most reputed westerosi blacksmith? this indicates that it was cersei who wanted her son to be in that position. so this implies that she arranged for the apprenticeship of gendry, right under her nose, and she also can watch him grow.

*also what was the secret jon arryn discovered before he died?*

we are told that jon arryn discovered the fact that 3 official children of robert were not actually his.

really? let us look.

one of the last things jon arryn did before dying was that he visited gendry in his shop. he also asked questions about his mother. a few weeks(or days) later, he was poisoned.

and its all the more mysterious that before dying, the last words of jon arryn to robert was ***""the seed is strong***"".

this implies that what jon discovered was that not only the 3 official children of robert were incestous but also that gendry is the only trueborn son of robert and cersei.

ned thought he really discovered why jon arryn died for, but he was wrong. he only discovered one half of it. he made serious mistake in assuming gendry to be a bastard.

that also explains the way cersei reacted to ned.

ned tells cersei: ***""i know why jon arryn died for.""***

cersei replies:""***do you, lord stark?""***

well folks, that was a long post. but there are many more reasons and details into this matter, but i dont wish to lengthen this post.

so, do share your thoughts on the matter.

Other popular choices would be Jon and Dany of course and I think Bronn would get a lot of love but I suspect my choice would be nearer the bottom of the list; I love the Sansa character.

Everyone else gets the best lines, they get to be cool, they get the epic action scenes but its Sansas journey that most fascinates me, she is simply the most tragic figure in Game of Thrones. When we first meet her shes the stereotypical stuck up and vacuous girl, she hates her home and dreams of living in the glamourous city of Kings Landing. When she learns that shes to marry the heir to the throne she thinks all her dreams have come true, shes completely oblivious to the horror shes about to endure.

She gets her first dose of reality when Joffrey tries to bully Mycah and her wolf ends up dead, this is just the start. Whilst betrothed to Joffrey she suffers humiliation, emotional and physical abuse; she starts to understand the hell shes living and appreciate what she had before. She thinks shes getting relief when Joffrey drops her for Margaery, she even thinks shes going to finally get her happy ending when shes betrothed to Loras (which is doubly tragic as she doesn't understand his sexuality), but this brief happiness is robbed from her as well.

Its during this period she becomes a survivor, she learns how to protect herself, emotionally at least, and stay out of trouble, shes on the road to becoming a cynic rather than the naieve little girl she was. Shes forced to marry Tyrion, which she goes along with, but she cant see that he represents the best life shes been offered so far, hes a good man, he would treat her well, respect her and keep her safe but to her hes a Lannister, and Lannisters killed her family.

When she escapes Kings landing shes now a protg of Littlefinger, she knows hes untrustworthy but she thinks she can predict what hell do and, at least, shell be safe. This in itself comes crashing down when he convinces her to marry Ramsey and leads to her worst experience yet. By the time, she watches Ramsey be eaten by his own hounds the girl she was is long gone. Whats left is an emotionally scarred, cynical husk of a women who struggles to connect to her own family. Shes learned lessons however, she doesnt suffer the other Starks naivety, shes cunning and ruthless. 

Theres some suggestion that, by the end of the show, shell basically be Cersai, but Im hoping that they dont go down that route. Sansa is a survivor, shes been through hell and come out the other side, whilst Cersais experience made her selfish and sadistic, Sansas can make her wise, pragmatic but still compassionate. 

Shes not funny, shes not cool, but her arc is brilliant and so much more interesting than everyone elses, thats why shes my favourite character.  ",51,40,False,spoiler,,,,,

A season I consider the greatest TV Season ever put to screen. It had everything I dreamed it would have, but that's not the topic for this post.

I started watching Season 5 yesterday and although it had some fine plot elements in it, I really did not find myself invested in the characters, the action and the plot development as I did with Season 3 or 4. Not that it was bad, but it just was ""there"" and not the GoT level I was used to. Episode 7 finally was a really good episode with some nice elements but oh my god. The following Episode ""Hardhome"" was one of the best TV episodes I have ever seen!  


I am a smart guy. If I see things teased and built up, I love it when these things finally happen and the storylines intertwine.  
The dialogue between Daenerys and Tyrion was absolutely amazing. ""Stark, Baratheon, Lannister, Targaryen, Tyrell, they're all just spikes in a wheel"". That's a direction I never thought would be possible. It opens so much room for more and inventive outcomes. It's amazing to finally see a Lannister &amp; Daenerys meet, because well, that's actually what the Series has been building up to. 

It's also really tough to think about what has happened to the Lannisters. Tywin is dead, Joffrey is dead, Tommon is broken, Cersei is imprisoned, Jaime has only one hand and Tyrion is somewhere where no one knows him. Comparing this with lets say the End of Season One is really thought provoking.

But of course, the real highlight are the White Walkers here. The last twenty minutes are blockbuster action stuff. It's frightening, but also stunning. How did a TV show manage to pull this kind of stuff of? The White Walkers were teased for 4 and a half fucking Seasons and FINALLY they are here. And they seem invincible as fuck. When they kill  a human, he becomes one of [them.](https://them.How) How cool is that??

in this post, i intend to discuss what really the hand to the king, intended to convey to robert baratheon.

we are told that *""seed is strong*"" refers to the fact that when a baratheon made an offspring with another woman, the baratheon trait of black hair always predominated.

wonder where this assumption come from??? this was the same assumption that ned stark made in the books. now i am going to convey why ned stark was wrong about jon arryn all along. he thought he knew the truth jon arryn died for. he did, but just one half of it.

now let us travel to the actions of jon arryn before his death.

a few weeks( or days) before his death, jon arryn visted gendry in his shop. he then asked gendry questions about his mother.

why did jon arryn visit only gendry? why not other bastards? why did he have a special interest in gendry?

the reason is, jon arryn somehow found out that gendry is actually the trueborn son of robert and cersei.

so coming back to jon arryn:

after he visits gendry, a few days later, jon arryn is poisoned and succumbs to his death.

jon arryn didnt get the chance to reveal the truth about gendry to his king.

just before he succumbs to his death, king robert arrives and he barely manages to say, ***""the seed is strong.""***

now where did ned go wrong? ned learned about the last words of jon arryn from grandmaester pycelle.

however he interprets it to just mean that baratheon hair predominate in a real baratheon offspring.

whereas in reality, what jon arryn meant was that **king robert still had a legitimate trueborn heir.**

so ned was able to discern only one half of what jon arryn discovered, namely that the three official children of king robert were not actually his, but he mistook gendry for a bastard.

even when ned learned that jon arryn asked about gendry's mother, still ned didnt have a clue.

But I've not seen the answer to the below questions in any of these:

1. In Bran's vision, he observed the creation of the current Night King. The guy who was being converted to Night King was all tied up and did not like being converted so. In fact, it appears as if he was very scared. **Why was he so scared?**  
\- Now I see theories which postulates Azhor Ahai to be night king(in fact I myself thought so), the legend says that Azhor Ahai defeated all the white walkers before. Would he be so scared ?   
\- Many theories suggest that someone purposely wanted to become night king to control some of the white walkers. This theory makes sense, but **that** scene does n't.  
**-  Why was he tied up?**   
\- I refuse to believe that the new night king is the same one first created by children of forest. I feel Children of forest created a night king before and then there was the great war. Men defeated and possibly killed the old night king.  
\- Children of Forest were allies to men during the war. Why will they purposefully convert a man by tying him up?  

2. Was Bran falling from the window pane ""**accidental**""(Yeah Ser Jamie pushed him and all that) ? **Why did he climb to that specific window pane? He got access to all his ""visions"" after this incident.**  

3. **What did Meera mean by ""you died in the cave that day"" ?** 
4. Why did Lord Bloodraven guide Bran to Children of Forest cave ? 
5. Most importantly **why is the night king attacking now?** Is it in anyway connected to Bran? ",15,7,False,spoiler,,,,,

It's a very simple one  you pick alive/undead/dead. You can win prizes. Enter before leaks if you want them.**

It's inevitable that there will be some major leaks prior to season eight (and some stuff is already known, to be fair). So, in an attempt to get at least a little ahead of the game and give people some off-season fun, we've created a deadpool.

This is a really simplified version  no odds or anything, just picking alive/dead/undead for a bunch of characters.

Rules:

1. If a character is not mentioned in any way, they are assumed to have ended the season alive  
2. If there is a time jump for an epilogue (e.g. Jon dying of old age), it will be excluded  
3. Your account must have joined Reddit at least four months ago

**Prizes**

We're being a little vague on prizes just now, because it'll depend on how many people enter  but at least the winner will get some Reddit gold be able to choose something from the prize pool  [here's a link to a pic showing the pool](https://i.imgur.com/0r8Xrfx.jpg)

**Deadline**

We'd recommend getting in quickly. When news of character deaths starts leaking, we'll start considering whether to shut the deadpool. While we'll keep it open for entries, those who enter after that won't be able to win a prize.

**Other stuff**

At some point we'll post the pie charts of people's predictions  just to give an idea of what the prevailing view on the sub is for the fate of characters! And if anyone wants a formatted copy of their entry, get in touch with myself/through modmail and we'll send that over.

Now I finished binge watching Season 5 in two days and here are some thoughts I have on it:

  
I think that the first half (I think until episode 6) is kind of boring for GoT levels. It's definitely not bad as a TV show, but it was missing something I loved in Season 4. I think that the narration in the first 6 episodes was a bit slow and I wasn't invested in all plot elements. I never really gave a shit about Brienne, and for the most part wasn't interested in here scenes. The Arya stuff will probably be very important for future seasons since I believe that she will turn out as one of the big characters, but it also wasn't as interesting to see as lets say her Season 4 alliance with Clegan. 

Now onto the good parts; I think Daenerys character archetype in this season is the most straightforward. Finally we see some storyline intertwining with amazing Tyrion Lannister and her meeting, which caused an amazing dialogue at Episode 8 and hopefully will bring lots of stuff for the future. Seeing Cersei being imprisoned and then humiliated by that religious group is definitely interesting to see, because it shows at how drastically things have changed for the Lannisters (Jaime one arm, she imprisoned, Tyrion betrayed family, Tywin dead, Tommon too young, Joffrey dead..). And of course the stuff with Jon Snow was amazing.

""Hardhome"" is one of the best TV episodes I have ever seen. It feels like blockbuster action, perfectly put together and serves every purpose for the storyline. The White Walkers are finally here (yeah I know they are bastards but they are really bad ass and I love when teased things actually happened), I also really loved Episode 9 ""The Dance of Dragons"" which showcased some great stuff in Meereen and with Drogon.

But I really have to say that the season finale left me cold. Stannis was one of my favorite characters of the show, and this really felt bad. I mean I get it, he made terrible mistakes and the Bolton's burned their horses (or something like that), but if you want me to believe that his journey is finally over, then please let me see the battle. It all felt rushed. From one episode to another he went from completely bad ass strong man to dead. I often complain about the pacing being slow (especially in Season 2/3), but here the pacing was WAY to fast. I mean Stannis ""revenge"" was built for like 4 seasons and then he loses of screen?   
And of course the final shot, Jon Snow getting betrayed and ""killed"", though he definitely will not be dead.

Over all, Season 5 had some amazing stuff in it (Hardhome/Dance of the Dragons), but the script did not always feel tight and crisp and it missed the continuity.

And I realized something: as the show demonstrated, the Night King can create new White Walkers by turning babies.

Craster stroke a deal with the Walkers: he would give them his male children, and in return, they would spare him and his daughter-wives. But *why* would the Walkers consent to that?

Why not raid Wildling villages to steal a baby every once in a while? Maybe they do and it's just not shown, but if that's the case, then why make a deal with a single human?

My theory is that the Night King can't turn just any baby into a White Walker. What if he needs *inbred* children? What if his ability to turn babies exploits a genetic defect that's found only in highly inbred children?

Now, I don't know whether this would have any significance to the story, but I find this idea interesting to consider. What do you think?",15,7,False,spoiler,,,,,

Arya became the badass we all thought she would, and took away emotional scars that make her seem cold and calculated, always watching her back and almost detached from reality.
Sansa went from being a naive girl believing in fairy tales to someone who knows how to play the game by learning from the best. She may not be the most exciting character, but I think she makes a fine head of Winterfell.

But rewatching season 7 made me realize just how much I hate what happened to their storylines once they got back together. It's understandable that they would argue and criticize them based on the images they had of each other when they were separated. But I thought there would be some smart way to show how they got together and resolved those issues.

Instead, we got a hurray, girl power! moment when they kill Littlefinger,  even though the entire development of their story lines was laid out to show their conflict. We didn't see them working together, plotting, there were no real signs for this. I think this is incredibly cheap writing. The show knowingly left out important information and showed us scenes that would make us believe the opposite of what was happening. 

When they killed Littlefinger, I wasn't happy that they were actually working together, I was frustrated that the show writers purposely tried to construct a false narrative for an aha moment at the end. It seemed like they artifucially exaggerated the tension just to throw people off track. They treated the audience like we're stupid enough to fall for that cheap shot.

Littlefinger deserved to die, but he was one of the smartest players in the game, yet his death was the result of a narrative they didnt show us, and seemed cheap and lazy for it. ",82,91,False,spoiler,,,,,

So Ive been rewatching the entire series with my fiance who has never had the pleasure of watching GoT and we just watched this episode and noticed one thing that got me a questioning the writers choice for this. 

Okay, so at the end of this episode, the Night King harpoons one of the flying dragons (forget who is who)... as the rest of the crew is loading up a dragon that is SITTING RIGHT THERE. 

Like, why didnt he go for the easy target that is like 50 feet away from him? How is the flying dragon at 40,000 ft his first choice? Plus, he has to see all the humans boarding too. 

IDK, just seemed like a weird plot hole.

~Stannis doesn't get killed at the Battle for Winterfell.

This will cover spoilers in the books up until Clash of Kings and all seasons of the show.

I know this is out there, but here are some things we've found out in the show/books:

* Tywin became hand of the King in 262 AC
* Shortly after marrying Tywin, Joanna Lannister (his wife) was kicked out of King's Landing by the Queen.
* Tywin was not below having intercourse with whores (As seen with Shae), so long as no one found out.
* There exists a secret passage to the Tower of the Hand that both Varys and Tywin know about.
* Gendry was born in 284 AC.
* Gendry's Mother had golden hair and was a Tavern Wench (Which is often a prostitute).
* Having a whore that looks like a queen is very popular with the patrons (as seen in Varys and Tyron's travels to Essos).
* Cersei often denied Robert her companionship in his bedchambers which was a source of frustration for Robert.
* Gendry was given assistance in becoming a blacksmith from a high lord (though this could be Jon Arryn) and escaping King's Landing from Varys.


So here's my theory based on those facts:

Shortly after his wife leaves King's Landing, Tywin is desperate and has the secret passage in the Tower of the Hand built. This passage goes straight to the bed chamber so not even his own guard knows who he has been sleeping with. Tywin then has whores, who he pays handsomely, use the secret passage and one of these girls becomes pregnant and later gives birth to a girl. Eventually Varys comes to court in 278 AC and learns of the secret passage and Tywin's night time activities. He tracks down the whore who gave birth to Tywin's bastard and questions her.

The bastard later becomes a Tavern Wench and is very popular for her striking similarities to Queen Cersei. Varys eventually finds out about the trouble between Robert and Cersei and introduces the bastard to Robert who is pleased to be able to engage in intercourse with a Cersei look a like. As Varys had hoped for, the girl becomes pregnant with Roberts child. After giving birth to Gendry the girl is killed and Varys pays for Gendry to learn the ways of blacksmithing which keeps him safe for a commoner and later arranges for his escape from Kings Landing. It's Varys hope that Gendry could one day become a claimant for a movement to overthrow whoever sits on the Iron Throne and make the lives of the common folks better since he was born and raised as one.",20,13,False,spoiler,,,,,

here are some points

1. cersei says to catelyn about her blackhaired beauty who was her firstborn son, back in season 7. also cersei and robert discuss about their firstborn back in season 1.
2. cersei describes her son as . *""he was a fighter too"".* in season 7, gendry says, *""i am a fighter""*
3. for those who think maggy the frog prophecy limits cersei's children to 3, click the link [https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8wzwhn/spoilers\_maggy\_the\_frog\_prophesy\_loophole/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8wzwhn/spoilers_maggy_the_frog_prophesy_loophole/) . either way, maggy prophecy doesnt limit cersei's children to 3.
4. the name gentry itself means highborn. so it makes sense why cersei named him gendry when she abandoned him.
5. the showrunners still show a baratheon sigil above KL in the opening credits, even though we are told that house baratheon is extinct and cersei rules as a lannister.
6. R+C=G has an amazing parallel with war of roses. click the link[https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8x84x2/spoliers\_war\_of\_the\_roses\_theory/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8x84x2/spoliers_war_of_the_roses_theory/)
7. jon arryn's dying words to king robert was *""the seed is strong.""* this might well mean that what he found was that not only the 3 official children of robert were not his, but also that robert's seed is preserved through his only trueborn son, gendry.
8. melisandre says to gendry, ""*there is power in kings blood.*"" she also says *""you will make kings rise and fall.""* these are too remarkable words to describe a lowborn bastard.
9. gendry says his mother had yellow hair and was a tavernwench. guess who has yellow hair? cersei. also in the books, cersei used to sneak out in KL as a tavernwench to the slums of KL, the same slums where gendry grew up.
10. When Gendry was old enough, *an unknown lord* paid his apprentice fee so he could learn to be a blacksmith. why did gendry receive this special treatment that none of other uncrecognized bastards of robert receive? (noterecognised bastards of robert like edric storm had special care). but gendry was a total unknown, even to robert. this means that this ""unknown lord"" might well be a character on behalf of cersei (most probably jaime).
11. also, gendry was the only bastard who was coveniently shipped out of KL, coinciding with right at the time of bastard hunt ordered by joffrey. in books, it was ordered by cersei. either way, only joffrey and cersei knew about it. this makes it even more mysterious why, gendry was still conveniently shipped out coinciding with the same time.
12. gendry survived in KL, right under the nose of cersei, for about 4 years (from season 3 to season 7) as her royal blacksmith even though he was a wanted man for the goldcloaks and royal army.",10,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

However, I have a few doubts about this happening. Here are some reasons why:

As we can clearly see, the writers didn't have much time to pad out the ""story details"" in Season 7. That's why Euron's massive fleet gets built in one week, Daenerys lands on an island without vegetation with a massive, hungry army, and an armored soldier can fall into a river and live. There is no mention of what happens to the Reach, Dorne, and the Riverlands after the Great Houses fall. 

Usually, these details would be filled in by GRRM, who would spend months padding out the plot holes - but these writers only have a few weeks or even days. Hopefully the half-year delay means they had more time for writing this time.

However, it worries me that all these details will be missed yet again in Season 8, which can really break the finale. 

Also, it's possible that they simply don't have enough time to wrap things up, which can make the finale feel rushed. They have a LOT of loose ends to tie together.

GoT is a pretty expansive show with a lot of plot threads to resolve. However, it hasn't left itself enough time to do justice to all of them. S8, IMO, is mostly going to focus on 3 arcs - humans vs WW, North vs Cersei and Theon vs Euron. Even doing these arcs justice would require almost all the screen-time. So once the action is over and the climactic battle done, what kind of resolution do you expect?

I can thinks of GoT going a couple of ways, with pros and cons for each. 

1.  No-resolution Ending - The minimalist approach where only the main plot threads are resolved. We see who sits on the Iron Throne and who marries whom and where the main characters end up, but little to no information on the rest of the world. Dorne, Riverlands, Stormlands, Essos etc. are ignored completely. The advantage of this ending is that it wouldn't take much of the screen-time. The disadvantage, ofcourse, is that its deeply unsatisfying. 

2. Whole Episode dedication - In this type of ending, all the climactic action takes place in the penultimate episode while the finale is reserved for resolving as many plot threads as possible. You visit each region and each character in turn to see how they are faring in the aftermath. This provides a satisfactory resolution and is in keeping with GoT's theme of having the major action take place in the penultimate episode. However, this would leave even less time for the main arc which would make it feel rushed. 

3. Montage ending - Another thing a lot of shows do, show a ""where are they now?"" montage for different characters. Set to heartwarming music, we get the bittersweet scenes from the lives of different characters in different regions - a small council meeting, someone ruling the North, farmers farming, traders trading etc. It doesn't provide the desired resolution, but it provides some level of closure. However, it'd be really incongruous for a show like GoT. 

4. X years later - Another common type of ending. You fast-forward to a time when the current dangling plot-threads have been resolved and someone simply narrates a summary of what happened in the aftermath. This would be the ending where Sam is writing a book and you get short clips of events as he narrates. Satisfying enough, I guess, but not exactly GoT's style. GoT never does a voice-over narration like that. 


So which type of ending do you expect GoT to have? Or would prefer it to have? Some combination of the above? Or some other type not listed here?",15,10,False,spoiler,,,,,

This paired with the size of the Game of Thrones franchise would make it very easy for a casting director to have greater freedom with who they hire.

Of course the original show does have amazing actors who were very well known before hand, such as Sean Bean, Charles Dance and Diana Rigg to name a few.

And while I agree that most of them deserve to be on these lists, I think Stannis does not get the recognition he deserves. 

For me, he is the most recognizable and identifiable character in the series. And no, that doesn't mean that {SPOILER} I kill my children, but that his motivations, his goals and the price he is willing to pay, are all ""real"". He's desperate after losing at Blackwater, and he wants to keep his honor and pride but will do anything in his power to get to the throne. But again, that does not mean he enjoys killing his children or burning people, but it's a burden that he is willingly going to bear in order to achieve the goal.

\[SPOILERS\] 

I feel like his death in Season 5 is really REALLY disappointing. I'm okay if he dies (though I would rather have seen him on the throne), but Off Screen? Really? That's one of the biggest characters you had, the rightful heir of the thrones, and you don't even show the battle he lost?

Just wow. I finished watching Episode 9 and 10 of Game of Thrones today. I am speechless. Do you know this feeling? You want to express your thoughts on something, but you can't find the right words to do your thoughts justice?  
That's why I come around with a statement that maybe sounds exaggerating. But I don't care:

Battle of the Bastards &amp; The Winds of Winter are the two greatest Television Episodes of all time.

The Battle of the Bastards can be summed up in one word: perfection. Every shot, every long take, every sound of music, every line of dialogue, every character action. It all comes together perfectly. This is the level you would expect from a 250 million dollar action blockbuster, but Game of Thrones once again did the impossible, even topping The Watchers on the Wall, Blackwater and Hardhome in terms of innovation, dramaturgy and pure emotion. It reminded me of Braveheart, The Lord of the Rings The Two Towers Battle of Helms Deep, even the opening scene of Gladiator. Everything happens in a moving rhythm, yet claustrophobic sense of danger. The long take while focussing on Jon Snow battling in the middle of the battlefield being surrounded my his men and enemies is ruthlessly fascinating, because it never stops. If there is one thing The Battle of the Bastards does, it is to make us viewers feel that we actually are in this battle. It's so character driven on Jon Snow. 

Now, I don't want to be a smart ass and try to analyze the whole battle, but it's just phenomenal. In every regard.   
But one thing that I noticed was that the whole battle relied on human emotions. Especially Jon's party. Their battle strategy isn't well-thought, it isn't organized, there are no clever tactics. It all relies on what a human soul can take. Anger, rage, hate - it's all a direct reaction to the actions of Ramsey. It's the kind of Pathos, I haven't felt in GoT since Season 4.

The Winds of Winter can also be summed up in basically one word: well, perfection. While it's the complete opposite of the Battle of the Bastards, it's equally great in quality. It's the perfect season finale.

One that sets up everything perfectly, yet concludes the major storylines of S6 and gives us answers to many questions. Yes, we finally get a look at Jon Snows mum, and that he is no bastard and actually related to Dany. Yes, finally Daenerys is picking up and sailing to Westeros. Yes, finally that Frey guy got killed. And oh boy, Cersei.   
The whole Sparrow Storyline was tough to watch. It wasn't even satisfying seeing Cersei being imprisoned (although I hated her in Seasons 1-4). It was weird seeing bad guys torture bad guys. But I was and am rooting for the Lannisters. Cersei blowing up the entire building, and then Tommon committing suicide (just like Cersei foreshadowed) felt really huge.   
I loved the scene where Jon became the King of the North (homage to Robb) and I loved seeing Littlefinger disappointed.

There is not a second wasted in The Winds of Winter.

All in all, Season 6 of Game of Thrones isn't as sharply written as Season 4 (which I still consider to be the greatest Television Season of all time), but it's high points are the two greatest Television episodes I have ever seen.

  
And some personal remarks/questions to the Season:  
I found the Arya storyline to be a bit boring, though it picked up big time in the end. I really loved Brans journey and all the things we learned about him and the past. I thought the Daenerys Dothraki angle to be really REALLY annoying, because it led to the same thing  with her on a dragon giving an ""epic"" speech.

I'm still pretty indecisive about who I want to see sitting on the Throne at the end. I think Daenerys would be the obvious, but also comparably boring choice. Though I appreciate the Lannisters, I still don't really wish that Cersei remains at the throne. I really wanted Stannis to be the King, but okay oh well. 

Hopefully Season 7 won't disappoint.",11,18,False,spoiler,,,,,

The drop height is by no means only psychological, but intimate and intensively character-driven.

But in return, the battle is also never slow in its narration - just as it is not a splatter scene or senseless gigantomania.

Without question, there is an almost weary portion of pathos and graphically enormous bloodshed.  But the violence, like Jon's intention, is never staged as the real purpose.  It's what got me going after all and had me shaken.   It is pure consequence. 
 
While many other Fantasy Battles rely heavy on tactics and strategies, the Battle of the Bastards doesnt. Just compare all the ladder, pyramid, shield, catapult or bomb action from the Battle of Helms Deep to this one. Here, everything is personal. Its the Wildlings and Jon running against Ramseys army. Its bloody violent and brutal, and claustrophobic and dangerous. All of that because the fight never really transforms in a large scale tactic battle.
If there is one word the Battle of the Bastards can be summed up: human. Its all human emotions. There are neither cheesy theatrics, war glorifications, nor strategies. And the humanity oozes out in every scene.

It's nice to see Ramsey being mauled by his dogs, of course, but the melancholic silence as Winterfell is recaptured shows the reason why GoT splits off from other fantasy. People, family died. There is no room for celebration, but there is room for vengeance. ",13,21,False,spoiler,,,,,

Gina ended up winning because no one expected that she was playing. Good show. But it got me thinking, the one who won the game was the one that no was aware of, this gave free reign of the competitor to implement plans unchallenged, flying under the radar. 

I have thought before and read on here about peoples thoughts regarding Syrio Forel and Jaqen Highar. But it got me thinking about a few things. First, how is it that Jaqen ended up in the cells of Kings Landing? It seems odd that someone of his skill would find themselves captured without a purpose. He also does not show up until after Syrio has been defeated by Meryn Trant. Obviously, this theory is not new, but it seems as thought this is not a fight between the great houses, but a proxy war between the gods. The God of Death, The Lord of Light, The Old Gods, the New Gods, all have champions in Westeros. But the one playing behind the scenes where no one exists to counter their plans, is the God of Death. 

So, I went back and was watching all the season for about the 5th time, because dont judge me. I watched the Syrio death scene a few times and I had a revelation, or at least a thought. Not from anything I saw, but from what I heard. Syrio is armed with a wooden sword, Meryn Trant has a metal sword. This is important. As Arya is running down the stairs, she hears the fighting, and then hears a sword fall. A metal one. Go ahead and listen (Season 1 Episode 8), tell me I am hearing things. Its a metal sword, not a wooden one. So what, could be just a sound editing error, or it could be absolutely nothing and I am thinking too much into it. Well

Syrio, is Jaqen, is a myriad of other people. He is serving the God of Death in the fight over the world with the other gods. My thought is that he changed faces in front of Meryn Trant which freaked out Trant, caused him to scream and drop his sword (what we actually hear) and run (and we wouldnt know this because Trant was by himself and he doesnt quite seem to be the type of person to come clean about running away scared). Syrio, now Jaqen makes his way to the dungeons to get picked up by Yoren to he can reunite with Arya (this is my biggest leap of faith because it means Jaqen had known or had something to do with Neds death and would know that Arya would head to the wall somehow). Yada yada yada Arya then trains to be a faceless man as part of his plan to use someone who is thought to be dead, and at the very least not a threat to carry out the God of Deaths plans to win the proxy war between the gods.

I also want to say that I love the show and the books.

First off, it's obvious that George is a very slow writer, but I think 'The Winds of Winter' book is actually finished and he is working on the final book right now. I think that the he is contractually obliged to not release WoW until the show is finished so that the book doesn't interfere with the show's ratings and probably it's DVD/Blu-ray sales, and so he keeps releasing other works that flesh out the ASoIaF universe to keep the book fans engaged. Martin wishes at this point to make the books stand out and be more than a tv tie-in.  I think he wants to completely ""top the show."" 

I also think it is very clear that D&amp;D want to move on to something different and wanted to wrap up GoT ASAP. Furthermore I think that HBO would rather be the first to end the story, and I think they would be just as happy if Martin never finishes the book series. 

it's obvious that George isn't very happy with the show anymore, and other than gaining way more readers, I think he regrets allowing it to be adapted for TV or film. in recent interviews I get the impression that he wants the book and show to be viewed as completely separate entities. He constantly says ""the show is the show and the book is the book,"" and ""Some characters are still alive in the books."" As the show had gone on he has been less involved in it, and he even claims he hasn't seen S7, which is obviously a lie. This tells me that he is not very happy with it at all. He has often said that he absolutely hates fan-fic, and let's be honest S7 had some of that in (Clegane's meeting and the ""Thought you might be still be rowing,"" thing.) I dont think the Clegane bowl will happen in the books. Clegane bowl is happening in the show because the fans want it, which at the end of the day is fan-fiction. George has also said that he hates seeing the 'hero' in constant life-threatening situations and somehow constantly being able to escape. This is obviously what Jon is doing now, he should have died beyond the wall but he magically escaped because he needed to be alive in the final season. they did come up with stupid reasons as to why Jon survived. Benjen coming in at the last second with the Walkers surrounding them, yet they didn't come after them when Jon was with Benjen. It was only after Jon got on the horse and was gone, did the Walkers show up again and killed Benjen. ""There's no time"" REALLY? 

A) HBO orders up an additional 8th season to cash in on GoT's ""hotness"". While D&amp;D only wanted to do 7 seasons, so they compromised by adding 3 episodes, a few extra minutes each and broke that up into 2 seasons (7&amp;8). This left them with more money to spend per episode. That money went largely to actor's pay, cinematography, wardrobe, action and CGI dragons. Martin gave D&amp;D a short bullet points list of the big events that will go down and which characters are ultimately important to the overall story. like I said, D&amp;D want to move onto different projects. So, the certain aspects of the story, its plots, character developments (including their dead/alive/existence status), pacing is all over the place causing the slip in overall quality. Really, it seems to me that D&amp;D should've worked out a rough outline of what they wanted to do with each season early on and then handed the Show over to someone else after season 5. Not only should HBO have demanded that after Martin left, but they should've ordered a full 10 episodes per the remaining seasons if they choose to continue it beyond the books.

B) HBO has surprise hit with GOT and pushes Martin to finish book series.  b)  Martin tries to speed up writing but can't outpace show. Since HBO doesn't have definitive annual seasons, when Martin sees he's being outpaced, he asks HBO to slow production until he can publish. HBO refuses because the show is ""hot"" and an extended hiatus could kill ratings.  HBO pushes Martin to give plot details to GOT producers, but not wanting to kill book sales, Martin's outline is vague. I also think he is pissed that he doesn't get to finish his story, the show does. With no more access to Martin, HBO decides to cut down seasons 7 and 8 to be  ""faster."" ",2,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Personally, I believe he'll embrace some of both following his discussion with Theon, regarding him being both a Greyjoy and a Stark.

My prediction would be that the Targaryen part he'll embrace (reluctantly) will be in regards to the Iron Throne. He'll use his lineage as a means to ascend to King, then use his life experiences as a Stark Bastard to rule efficiently with all the compassion he has.

(Actually I noticed that the narration and pacing is really, like REALLY fast in this Season. Maybe even a bit too fast. Theres so much stuff happening in each episode.)

And the battle is mostly built up with Daenerys being the good and Cersei being the bad.
But am I the only one who is rooting for the Lannisters?

I dont know why, but I just feel that both Jaime and Cersei are much more compelling characters and have way deeper and more recognisable characterisation than Daenerys. 
The storyline with the Sparrows really made me forget how much I hated Cersei in S1-4 (I really did), but it turned out that she eventually really is a human character, as weird as that sounds.
And Jaime is a character that I always loved.
I think its just great to see characters in different situations, when theyre falling and rising, winning and losing.

Daenerys on the other hand, had pretty much the most linear character arc one could imagine.
It was just her giving an epic speech after epic speech, showing of her dragons, then giving another epic speech, saving the innocent from the bad guys and then, well give an epic speech.

And I see a lot of people on here that hate her, and Im not sure I understand why. She's an imperfect character that often but not always is capable of changing her mind when advisors come to her with new evidence and perspective. 

And she's hella badass. I won't deny that I love watching her with her dragons. I disagree that she is incompetent or has everything handed to her. People say that it was too easy for her to get her army of unsullied, for instance. Im not sure why- I think it was very smart. Someone who has never encountered a dragon but has spent his whole career dealing with slaves? It was very clever of her to take advantage of his misconception that a dragon on a chain is basically a beast that is under the command of whomsoever holds the chain. And when Drogon shows up to save her from the Sons of the Harpy? I dont think its just overly convenient dragon bailout. She seems to have a connection with her dragons similar to the connection the Stark children have with their direwolves. I never see anyone accusing Jon or Bran of having plot armor when their direwolves save them in the nick of time. Yes, she has dragons. Yes, that is an enormous advantage that many other characters do not have. But learning how to use them effectively is basically the point of her character. Shes the Mother of Dragons. She does have some special Chosen One type abilities. But taking strategic advantage of her special abilities (burning the Khals alive with herself inside) is a sound plan, not random plot armor. She manages to eliminate her enemies and demonstrate her power to a nation of people that are awed by her and then rally around her. No, another character could not have done it that way. But her taking advantage of her unique abilities isnt the same as having things handed to her.

What else? She can be extremely defensive and rash when she feels cornered, which often brings out her entitled side. She certainly has made mistakes. Lately that has been even more of a problem as she grows complacent. The reason I like her is because she struggles with being a good ruler, but at the end of the day I think that is something that is important to her, even if it doesn't always come naturally and she has to fight her own nature sometimes. I think she wants to bring a better life to all people- I think she proved that when she stayed in Mereen and again lately when she agreed to focus her attention on the war in the North instead of just her conquest of Westeros. Yes, the show didnt do the best job of allowing her screen time to fully resolve things in Essos. But I think they did a decent job of showing that after her initial liberation of the slave cities there was pushback, and she and her advisors had to deal with that and even if things werent 100% settled when she left, she made sure to leave a presence of trusted people there to oversee the transition to a peaceful government with no slavery. Its not like shes gone off the face of the earth. Presumably, if Daario has problems, he can write her and she can either personally go back or send more of her forces to help him.

As opposed to Jon- I like him, but in many ways he is too perfect for me. even his flaws are virtues- he sometimes reacts too emotionally (because he is so honorable and loves his family so much, etc). That's fine... but I prefer characters that have things about them that I love and things that are terribly wrong in a way that isn't designed to make them look even better- and could easily doom them.

I want Dany to learn and evolve and become better- - but the process is what I want to watch. And in order for it to count, at least for me, there has to be a real risk of her going mad queen. I don't want to love a character that is the king champion savior as a foregone conclusion. I want to agonize every week about whether they can control their vices to be the person I hope they can be, because I know it could just as easily go the other way.

In this universe, a show of force is sometimes necessary. Ned's execution of the watch brother in episode 1, Jon killing Olly, etc. Rulers cannot afford to even look weak- and sometimes burning is an effective way to quell dissent and treachery. Especially when an important goal is to hopefully prevent future similar occurrences.  But it is a fine line. I hope she stays on the right side... the thing with the Tarlys and her recent interactions with Tyrion made me a little upset, but she did offer them the black. To just let them go would be a show of weakness on her part, and what she needs right now is to appear strong. And like I said- I feel like there needs to be almost equal chance of a character making me happy and letting me down in order for me to really connect with their story and get invested. 

The other thing that I see being brought up is this idea that she is entitled. But imo, people underestimate the importance of appearing to be fully confident and unwavering when you are a leader. Her self assuredness about her claim to the throne and her plans are part of what strengthen her claims as a queen. But the really remarkable part about her is that she can and does change her mind in private when people bring her new evidence, and she genuinely seems as though her ambitions are not rooted in a will to power but rather her desire to reshape the world into a better place for the people. Of course she uses her birthright as part of her justification for the throne, but also she's earned it- or at least she's in the process of earning it. She has several times now made comments in private about how even though she believes she deserves the Iron Throne by birthright, she worries about being worthy of it and doing a good job as ruler. It would be completely silly to think that the only people who should be in power are those that dont want it and are all but forced into leadership out of a sense of duty, like Jon.

And not just that, but that maybe they are actually each a part of the Azor Ahai prophecy. This strictly show related. However, the show-runners of Game of Thrones have been told the ending of the series from the man himself, G.R.R.M. So could this possibly be how the book is going to end???? Probably not, but you never know. These are also not my personal opinions. May include spelling and grammar mistakes. I'm not perfect, and some events may be slightly out of order. This was mainly for fun so read for enjoyment. I've broken down the evidence by season so (WARNING HEAVY SPOILERS FOR SEASONS 1-7):

**Season 1:**

**Before the series begins:**

* *Prince/Princess who was promised prophecy (PWWP).*

\-  1/2. Born amongst salt and smoke. This applies to Daenerys (Dany), as she was born on Dragonstone, a smoky island off the coast of King's Landing that was the original seat of Aegon the Conqueror and House Targaryen.

\-  2/2. Born in sand amongst a bleeding star. This applies to Jon, as we find out in the finale of Season 6 that he was born in the desert region of Westeros called Dorne, while Sir Arthur Dayne's sword Dawn (forged from a falling star) sat beside him freshly covered in blood.

* *Had mother's who died during childbirth*.

\-  Rhaella Targaryen died giving birth to Dany.

\-  Lyanna Stark died giving birth to Jon.

* *Were hidden at birth and raised in secret.*

\-  Dany was moved from place to place as a child, along with her older brother Viserys, in order to avoid assassins sent by King Robert Baratheon.

\-  Jon was raised as the son of Ned Stark, in order to keep the secret that his parents are really Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark.

* *Can trace their lineage to the Mad king.*

\-  Dany is his daughter.

\-   Jon is his grandson.

**Series begins:**

* *Leave their homes and join a new group*.

\-  Dany (begrudgingly) agrees to marry Khal Drogo, the head of a very large Dothraki khalasar, and to join the Dothraki as the khalasar's version of a queen.

\-  Jon leaves his Stark home of Winterfell, and decides to join the Night's Watch, a group that defends the Wall from any threats beyond it.

* *Begin to thrive in their new groups*.

\-  Dany forms a real love and partnership with Drogo, learns the Dothraki language, controls some of their customs and adopts their policies, gains confidence in her role, and grows stronger, even standing up to her abusive brother.

\-   Jon proves that he is much more skilled than any other new recruit, begins training the new recruits, and is named the steward to the Lord Commander himself, Jeor Mormont. This sets up Jon to be a strong candidate for the next Lord Commander.

* *Form a valuable friendship*.

\-  Dany with Ser Jorah Mormont as a sell-sword/bodyguard from Westeros.

\-  Jon with Samwell Tarly, a smart but naive recruit and Jon's first friend in the Night's Watch.

* *Survive a near-death experience*.

\-  Dany is almost poisoned by a wine merchant, but is luckily saved by Ser Jorah.

\-   Jon stops a white that attacks him and his direwolf Ghost inside a Night's Watch tower. This marks the first appearance of a white inside the Wall.

* *Say goodbye to two people close to them*.

\-  Dany loses Viserys and Khal Drogo. After multiple offenses to both Dany and the Dothraki, Khal Drogo pours molten gold onto the head of her brother Viserys, killing him instantly. Then, Drogo suffers from an infected cut and the blood-magic of a scorned witch, which leads to his death.

\-  Jon receives news that Ned Stark, his ""father"", has been beheaded in King's Landing. Then, his ""uncle"" who is also in the Night's Watch, Benjen Stark, goes missing during a ranging mission. Benjen is presumed dead, and is not seen again until the end of Season 7 as a half-white. 

* *Given powerful weapons.*

\-  In the Season 1 finale, Dany manages to hatch three baby dragons from petrified eggs, by climbing into Drogo's funeral pyre. Creatures who were thought to have been extinct for over one-hundred years.

\-  Jon, receives a Valyrian steel sword from Jeor Mormont after saving his life from the white. Valyrian steel is the strongest and lightest steel in the world, and only a few swords remain in the Seven-Kingdoms.

* *Start journeys of Fire and Ice*.

\-  Dany, after hatching her dragons, takes her remaining khalasar into the hot, desert terrain, to find a place to keep them safe and plan her next move towards retaking her home and all of Westeros.

\-  Jon, and his fellow Night's Watch members start a journey to the icy, cold, deep-north, in order to find out what has been happening beyond the wall. Rumors swirl of white-walker sightings, and of the largest wild-ling army to ever exist.

**Season 2:**

* *Trekking through a wasteland*.

\-  Season 2 begins with Dany, and her weather-torn group, looking for shelter from the fierce heat and fire of the Red Waste.

\-   Jon, and his weather-torn group, are looking for reports of the largest wildling army to ever exist. As well as suitable shelter to escape the fierce ice and cold.

* *Enjoy their new roles*.

\-  Dany begins to come into her own as leader of her khalasar. The shy girl from the first season is almost gone.

\-  Jon also begins to come into his own as a Night's Watch member. He's volunteering for duties, teaching new recruits, and no longer carrying a chip on his shoulder.

* *Opposite sex advances*.

\-  When Dany makes it to the end of the Red Waste, she is invited into a city called Qarth. Within Qarth thirteen members make up a council that together rule the city. One member is man known as Xaro Xhoan Daxos, or the Spice King. Daxos proposes marriage to Dany many times, and every time he is rejected.

\-  While Jon is on a scouting mission, he comes across a few wild-lings. One is a female named Ygritte, who Jon takes captive. While captive, Ygritte makes many sexual advances toward Jon, and every time she is rejected.

* *Taken captive*.

\-  While a guest within Qarth, warlocks use magic and betrayal to steal Dany's dragons and lure her into their tower of a hideout. Once within the tower and past her visions (will discuss next), she is put into chains by the warlocks. She manages to escape by having her three dragons burn the warlock in front of her.

\-  While Jon has Ygritte captive, she manages to escape, lure Jon into an ambush, and take him as her prisoner.

* *Gain knowledge from enemies*.

\-  When Dany first enters the warlocks' tower, she begins to have visions. One is of King's Landing , only it's ruined and covered in snowy ash. (Possibly foreshadowing the series finale?????) After Dany escapes the visions and is put into chains, the warlocks' explain to tell her that her dragons are the source of the warlock's restored magic. Meaning it's possible her dragons brought magic back into the world.

\-   Jon and his group come to a house known as Craster's Keep, belonging to a man known for housing the Night's Watch north of the Wall. Jon comes to find out that Craster marries all his daughter's, they have his children, and the cycle repeats. If that wasn't bad enough, he then finds out Craster has been giving all of his son's to the White-Walkers (WW), as a sacrifice so they would leave him in peace.

* *Make a bold decision and head into the unknown*.

\-  After getting revenge on those within Qarth who plotted to steal her dragons and potentially harm her, Dany decides to take the now deceased Spice King's ships deeper into Essos towards Astapor and Slaver's Bay. This decision is bold because Dany doesn't know much about Essos and it's lands, and also it's the opposite direction of Westeros and the Iron Throne, Dany's ultimate goal.

\-  Now that Jon is a wild-ling captive, he makes the choice to go undercover and infiltrate the supposed ""largest wild-ling army ever"", by killing a fellow Night's Watchmen, Qhorin Half-Hand (Qhorin's idea). By doing so, the wild-lings believe he is a true deserter of the Night's Watch, keeping his cover for now.

**Season 3:**

* *Pretend to be naive and but up a powerful bluff.*

\-  Once is Astapor, Dany meets a slaver who frequently insults her in Valyrian. Little does he know Valyrian is Dany's native tongue, and Dany uses this to her advantage. Dany strikes up a bargain with the slaver: one dragon for eight-thousand Unsullied soldiers. Some of the fiercest warriors in the world. Dany is told by many not to make the deal, as a dragon is too powerful, but she is confident in her decision. When the time comes to make the deal, Dany commands one of her dragons to kill the slave-master, and takes the Unsullied for her own.

\-   Meanwhile in the deep North, Jon is under watch by the wild-lings, as few truly believe he has left the Night's Watch. His bluff is working, for now.

* *Overcome a large obstacle.*

\-  After Astapor, Dany sets her sights on the city of Yunkai. The Yunkai send sell-swords named the Second Sons to fight Dany's army, and one in particular named Daario Naharis to kill Dany. Daario decides to instead join Dany, and with his help, Dany's army conquers Yunkai.

\-  As a wild-ling, Jon and a small group are tasked with climbing the Wall itself. After almost falling on the way up, Jon survives the climb, largely with the help of Ygritte.

* *Intimate relationships.*

\-  Dany feels an initial attraction to Daario, and although they don't officially hook-up until Season 4, they form a ""friends-with-benefits"" relationship. Her first since the death of Drogo at the end of Season 1.

\-  After the thrill of conquering the Wall, Jon and Ygritte start an intimate relationship, but this one becomes serious. They form a relationship based on real love.

* *Begin to become true leaders.*

\-  Dany has now conquered and liberated two cities. She has three dragons, an army, and thousands of former slaves following her. The freed slaves have even taken to calling her ""mhysa"", which means Mother. She is becoming a queen.

\-  After escaping the wild-ling camp, and taking multiple arrows from Ygritte and his way out, Jon makes it back to the Wall and Castle Black. The first time in two seasons. He is now battle-tested, knows the wild-lings, and is ready to become a leader when his men need him most.

**Season 4:**

* *Fight for a moral high-ground.*

\-  Dany has now conquered two cities in Slaver's Bay, and makes her way towards a third, the city of Meereen. After approaching the city, and having Daario Naharis defeat Meereen's champion outside the city gates, Dany launches the collars of all the slaves she has already freed into the city. This sends a message that she is done with slavery, and anyone who joins her will never again be put into chains.

\-  Now that Jon has returned to The Wall, he is immediately faced with a problem. While Jon was undercover with the wild-lings, the Night's Watch party he began with were attacked by whites. The surviving men went to Craster's Keep, and while there, led a mutiny that resulted in Craster's death. As well as the death of their own Lord Commander, Jeor Mormont. Jon volunteers to take down the mutiny on the moral obligation to get revenge for his Lord Commander, but also because Jon grossly exaggerated the numbers of the Night's Watch. If the wild-lings make it to Crater's Keep and find out the real numbers, the wild-lings would attack the Wall and easily take it.

* *Answer injustice with justice.*

\-  Dany dispatches her Unsullied to infiltrate Meereen, start a slave revolt, and then open the city gates for the rest of her army. The plan works, and the city is hers. She then has 163 Great Masters killed, in response to the 163 children that were killed and strung-up along the path from Yunkai to Meereen.

\-  As mentioned above, Jon is on the way to put down the mutiny at Craster's. And as much as this was done to make sure the Night's Watch members there don't tell any wild-lings their true numbers, this was also done to get justice for Jeor. Jeor made Jon his steward, gifted him a Valyrian steel sword, mentored him like a father, and helped him grow into a man and a leader. Jon wants to avenge Jeor, and get some kind of justice against his fellow Night's Watch members that killed their own leader.

* *Forced to cage their beasts.*

\-  While in Meereen, a shepherd brings Dany the bones of his daughter, who was accidentally killed by her largest Dragon, Drogon. In response, Dany agrees to cage her dragons under the Great Pyramid of Meereen. She isn't able to catch Drogon, so only her other two dragons, Rhaegal and Viserion, are successfully caged.

\-  While putting down the mutiny at Craster's Keep, Jon reunites with his direwolf Ghost, who he had not seen since being capture by wild-lings in Season 2. But once he returns to Castle Black, he is ordered by Alliser Thorne, a high-raking member of the Watch that also hates Jon, to cage Ghost. Or risk it becoming food for the men.

**Season 5:**

* *Tempted by lineage.*

\-  Meereen is growing chaotic. Former slaves and masters are constantly fighting, and a secret organization known as the Sons of the Harpy are killing Unsullied soldiers. One such Harpy is found, and Dany at first wants the man executed. Her adviser, Ser Barristan Selmy, argues the man should have a trial. He then warns her of how her father, the Mad-King, acted. He went for execution over trial, and soon lost himself inside his own murderous desires.

\-  After the remaining wild-ling army was smashed by Lord Stannis Baratheon, the younger brother of former King Robert and technically the true king of Westeros , Stannis takes refuge at Castle Black. While there he makes Jon an offer, join him and rise as Jon Stark, Lord of Winterfell. After some consideration, Jon declines, stating he made a vow to the Night's Watch.

* G*ranted official titles.*

\-  In order to keep the piece in Meereen, Dany agrees to marry a noble from one of the city's most well-known houses, Hizdahr zo Loraq. Through this marriage, she is officially the Queen of Meereen, to those who already saw her this way and to the nobles who refused her claim.

\-  At Castle Black, it's now time to elect a new Lord Commander. At first, Alliser Thorne is the clear favorite and seems to have the election locked up. But then Samwell Tarly gives a passionate speech for Jon, and it's enough to sway his fellow men, leading Jon to become the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.

* *Working with different groups isn't easy.*

\-  Meereen is still at odds. Former slaves hate former masters, and vice versa. One slave murders the man that Dany wanted to put on trial. To try and fix the situation, Dany has that slave publicly executed. The other former slaves immediately turn on her, and any masters preset. Neither group is any happier, and worst now Dany has lost members from the one group that was originally with her.

\-  Things at Castle Black aren't going so well. Lord Stannis expects his troops taken care of, and is even trying to recruit wild-lings to his cause, a move that upsets the Night's Watch. The Night's Watch want revenge against any remaining wild-lings. The wild-lings that survived want revenge against the Night's Watch. And members of the Night's Watch are growing uneasy with: their new Lord Commander, lack of men and supplies, and wild-lings and Stannis' men always around them. This comes to a blow when Janos Slynt, the man responsible for betraying New Stark back in Season 1, publicly refuses the orders given by Jon. Jon responds by publicly executing Slynt, a move that pleases some and angers others.

* W*orking with the enemy.*

\-  As mentioned above, Dany marries a noblemen in order to better unite Meereen. And she also agrees to re-open the fighting pits to freedman only, something she has constantly been against. This move is a way of showing the masters she can respect their old traditions. And during her fist visit to a fighting pit practice exhibition, she is given a gift, Tyrion Lannister. All Dany knows of house Lannister is that they played a role in casting out her family, so naturally Tyrion is first seen as an enemy. But after some discussion, Dany agrees to allow Tyrion to counsel her. His knowledge of ruling and of Westeros are of great value.

\-  Jon must also work with his enemies. The Wall needs more men, and one of Jon's duties is to ask the lords of Westeros to send anyone they can spare. This includes Roose Bolton, the current warden of the North who betrayed the Starks and stole Winterfell. At first Jon refuses to send a letter to Roose, but is reminded the Night's Watch remains neutral. So he reluctantly asks. His next move is even bolder, he plans to allow the wild-lings to pass through the Wall and settle in the North as subjects of the Seven Kingdoms, or even let them join the Watch. Jon's idea is met with harsh criticism, but he points out that every single wildling left on the north side of the Wall will be killed, then resurrected, and then added to the White Walkers ever-growing army. Jon then leads a rescue mission to a place beyond-the-wall called Hardhome, in order to save wild-lings who were separated during Stannis' attack. The mission is a success, however; bringing even more wild-lings into Castle Black does not go over well with many of the Night's Watch.

* *Consequences of one's actions.*

\-  Dany is in attendance at the official opening of the fighting pits. Lately things in Meereen have cooled down, and everyone has relaxed their guard. Suddenly, Sons of the Harpy reveal themselves on every level of the arena and begin slaughtering both masters and freedmen alike  Hizdahr included. The new found peace was simply a distraction for this main attack. Dany and her companions are pushed toward the center of the pit, and just when they look to be in trouble, Drogon swoops down, defends Dany, and then leaves with her to an unknown location. Her city is at war again, this time without its queen.

\-  The night Jon returns from Hardhome, his squire Olly comes and tells him one of the wild-lings knows of the whereabouts of his uncle Benjen Stark, who has been missing since Season 1. Jon goes down and follows Thorne to a gathering of his Watch brothers, only to find a sign marked ""Traitor"". Thorne, Olly, and other members of the Night's Watch begin to stab Jon, each saying ""For the Watch"". Jon siding with the wild-lings may have been the right decision, but men who have fought them all their lives did not seen it this way. Jon collapses and seemingly dies from his wounds, bleeding out onto the cold snow.

**Season 6:**

* *Both are reborn, new, and improved?*

\-  After Drogon takes Dany away from Meereen, she is met by a massive Dothraki khalasar. She is taken prisoner, but once it's discovered she was married to a Khal, she is told she must join the Dosh Khalleen. A group of all the wives of fallen Khals. This doesn't sit well with Dany. All the Khals from across the land are gathered in their city Vaes Dothrak, and are deciding if Dany is allowed to join the Khalleen. Dany has another idea. She traps the Khals inside their meeting hut, sets the place on fire killing them all, and emerges reborn from fire once again as Daenerys Targaryen, the Unburnt.

\-  Jon was last seen bleeding out from his wounds delivered by his fellow Night's Watch members. The worst happens, and Jon dies. But Ser Davos isn't giving up. He enlists the help of the Red Witch Melisandre, to see if she can resurrect him. She is reluctant, but tries anyways. She preforms her spell, and it looks like it failed. But as everyone is leaving, Jon Snow opens his eyes, alive once again. His death also allows him to leave the Night's Watch, as his vows end now that he has died.

* *Revenge.*

\-  As mentioned above, Dany kills all the former Khals. They took her prisoner, insulted her, would have raped her, abused her, and would have made her remain a Dosh Khalleen. Her revenge was swift and powerful.

\-  A newly resurrected Jon has to take care of some unfinished business. The Night's Watchmen who killed him had all been captured, and were to face justice. Jon offers Thorne, Olly, and two other men a chance for any last words, and then has all four publicly hung. Revenge is his, even if it isn't so sweet.

* *Form a new army*.

\-  Once Dany burns all the Khals, she asks all the Dothraki to join her and her cause. They all agree, and suddenly Dany has a much larger force.

\-  Now that Jon is no longer apart of the Night's Watch, he isn't sure what to do. That changes when his ""sister"", Sansa Stark, arrives at Castle Black. She informs him that she ran from Winterfell, where she was married to the abusive Ramsay Bolton, and that his forces are looking for her. They eventually devise a plan to take back Winterfell, and defeat the Boltons. To do so, Jon and his allies ask any northern lords who haven't joined the Boltons to fight with him, as well as the wild-lings. Some agree, and an army is formed, but one smaller than they need.

* *Fight for their future.*

\-  While Dany has been gone, Tyrion has ruled Meereen in her place. He's a good ruler, but not as threatening as ""the mother of dragons"". So finally, all the slavers from Slaver's Bay begin an assault on Meereen. Just then, Dany and Drogon arrive and ready for battle. With a newly freed Rhaegal and Viserion, Dany and her three dragons begin burning the Slaver's fleet. They quickly begin retreating, but a message must be sent, so Dany has 2/3 of the former high-masters executed, and tells the third to spread the tale of what happened here. Of what happened when slavery tried to return to Meereen. 

\-  Jon, and his out-numbered men, get ready to battle the Bolton's army for control of the North. They have a plan to make up for their lack of men, but that goes away once Ramsay releases Jon's youngest ""brother"" Rickon and has him run across the battlefield, while he shoots arrows at him. Jon makes it feet away from Rickon, right before an arrow hits and kills him. Enraged, Jon attacks the whole army, and his men follow. The battle is fierce, but it seems Ramsay has led Jon into a trap. Right when hope is lost, Sansa comes in with the Knights of the Vale and smash Ramsay's forces. Jon follows a fleeing Ramsay to Winterfell, and proceeds to beat the living crap out of Ramsay. The battle is won, and once again Starks rule Winterfell. 

* *Begin a new chapter, stronger than ever.*

\-  Now that the slavers have been put down, ships and soldiers are plentiful, and the dragons are battle-ready, Dany is ready to set sail for Westeros. She has three dragons, and Unsullied army, a Dothraki horde, and alliances with both House Tyrell and Martell, two old and respected houses in Westeros. A new chapter begins, one that finally has Dany in Westeros!

\-  With the battle won the North is safe, and a Stark once again holds the North and Winterfell. Now they must figure out what's next. A lot of powerful, northern houses have been hurt in the constant warfare, and someone needs to lead. Lyanna Mormont, the new leader of House Mormont, stands and makes a case for Jon Snow. Although he's a Snow, he's still a Stark, and for the most part a Stark has always ruled the North. This fact, and Jon's proven merit, sway the other lords in attendance, and soon chants of ""the White Wolf"" and ""King of the North"" are shouted by almost everyone. Jon hesitantly, accepts the honor, out of duty and not for personal glory. A new chapter begins, and from a bastard to King of the North! 

**Season 7:**

* *Plan for the future.*

\-  Now in Westeros, Dany plans to fight for the Iron Throne, and the Lannisters are her target. With all her strength at the ready, she and her advisers plan for war. 

\-  Now as King of the North, Jon has more responsibility than ever. But the biggest threat is still that beyond the Wall, the WWs. Jon begins planning his tactics, one of which is convincing those in Westeros that the threat is even real.

* *End of similarities, because the meeting is here!*

\-  Dany is advised to invite Jon to Dragonstone, as he is gaining quite a reputation. 

\-  Jon agrees and he and Davos make the journey. 

\-  Jon arrives, and Fire and Ice are officially united!!!!!!!!!! 

\-  Instantly the contrasts in styles are on full display. Dany is aggressive and more power-hungry (fire), while Jon is relaxed and focused on the bigger threat (ice). 

Over the course of the rest of the season, their bond grows stronger. And finally, in the season finale, they hook up for the first time. This sets the stage for a wedding, and maybe even a child in Season 8.

That's all! A lot of info, but after seeing all their similarities it seems very much like Dany and Jon are the embodiment of Fire and Ice. I'm not sure how the book with deal with the Azor Ahai prophecy, but it seems like the show is simplifying it, and making Dany and Jon each a half of the prophecy. It works, and who knows this could all be right, or completely wrong. Just my interpretation of the material. Thanks for the read! ",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

This was mainly for fun so read for enjoyment. I've broken down the evidence by season so (WARNING HEAVY SPOILERS FOR SEASONS 1-7):

**Season 1:**

**Before the series begins:**

* *Prince/Princess who was promised prophecy (PWWP).*

\-  1/2. Born amongst salt and smoke. This applies to Daenerys (Dany), as she was born on Dragonstone, a smoky island off the coast of King's Landing that was the original seat of Aegon the Conqueror and House Targaryen.

\-  2/2. Born in sand amongst a bleeding star. This applies to Jon, as we find out in the finale of Season 6 that he was born in the desert region of Westeros called Dorne, while Sir Arthur Dayne's sword Dawn (forged from a falling star) sat beside him freshly covered in blood.

* *Had mother's who died during childbirth*.

\-  Rhaella Targaryen died giving birth to Dany.

\-  Lyanna Stark died giving birth to Jon.

* *Were hidden at birth and raised in secret.*

\-  Dany was moved from place to place as a child, along with her older brother Viserys, in order to avoid assassins sent by King Robert Baratheon.

\-  Jon was raised as the son of Ned Stark, in order to keep the secret that his parents are really Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark.

* *Can trace their lineage to the Mad king.*

\-  Dany is his daughter.

\-   Jon is his grandson.

**Series begins:**

* *Leave their homes and join a new group*.

\-  Dany (begrudgingly) agrees to marry Khal Drogo, the head of a very large Dothraki khalasar, and to join the Dothraki as the khalasar's version of a queen.

\-  Jon leaves his Stark home of Winterfell, and decides to join the Night's Watch, a group that defends the Wall from any threats beyond it.

* *Begin to thrive in their new groups*.

\-  Dany forms a real love and partnership with Drogo, learns the Dothraki language, controls some of their customs and adopts their policies, gains confidence in her role, and grows stronger, even standing up to her abusive brother.

\-   Jon proves that he is much more skilled than any other new recruit, begins training the new recruits, and is named the steward to the Lord Commander himself, Jeor Mormont. This sets up Jon to be a strong candidate for the next Lord Commander.

* *Form a valuable friendship*.

\-  Dany with Ser Jorah Mormont as a sell-sword/bodyguard from Westeros.

\-  Jon with Samwell Tarly, a smart but naive recruit and Jon's first friend in the Night's Watch.

* *Survive a near-death experience*.

\-  Dany is almost poisoned by a wine merchant, but is luckily saved by Ser Jorah.

\-   Jon stops a white that attacks him and his direwolf Ghost inside a Night's Watch tower. This marks the first appearance of a white inside the Wall.

* *Say goodbye to two people close to them*.

\-  Dany loses Viserys and Khal Drogo. After multiple offenses to both Dany and the Dothraki, Khal Drogo pours molten gold onto the head of her brother Viserys, killing him instantly. Then, Drogo suffers from an infected cut and the blood-magic of a scorned witch, which leads to his death.

\-  Jon receives news that Ned Stark, his ""father"", has been beheaded in King's Landing. Then, his ""uncle"" who is also in the Night's Watch, Benjen Stark, goes missing during a ranging mission. Benjen is presumed dead, and is not seen again until the end of Season 7 as a half-white.

* *Given powerful weapons.*

\-  In the Season 1 finale, Dany manages to hatch three baby dragons from petrified eggs, by climbing into Drogo's funeral pyre. Creatures who were thought to have been extinct for over one-hundred years.

\-  Jon, receives a Valyrian steel sword from Jeor Mormont after saving his life from the white. Valyrian steel is the strongest and lightest steel in the world, and only a few swords remain in the Seven-Kingdoms.

* *Start journeys of Fire and Ice*.

\-  Dany, after hatching her dragons, takes her remaining khalasar into the hot, desert terrain, to find a place to keep them safe and plan her next move towards retaking her home and all of Westeros.

\-  Jon, and his fellow Night's Watch members start a journey to the icy, cold, deep-north, in order to find out what has been happening beyond the wall. Rumors swirl of white-walker sightings, and of the largest wild-ling army to ever exist.

**Season 2:**

* *Trekking through a wasteland*.

\-  Season 2 begins with Dany, and her weather-torn group, looking for shelter from the fierce heat and fire of the Red Waste.

\-   Jon, and his weather-torn group, are looking for reports of the largest wildling army to ever exist. As well as suitable shelter to escape the fierce ice and cold.

* *Enjoy their new roles*.

\-  Dany begins to come into her own as leader of her khalasar. The shy girl from the first season is almost gone.

\-  Jon also begins to come into his own as a Night's Watch member. He's volunteering for duties, teaching new recruits, and no longer carrying a chip on his shoulder.

* *Opposite sex advances*.

\-  When Dany makes it to the end of the Red Waste, she is invited into a city called Qarth. Within Qarth thirteen members make up a council that together rule the city. One member is man known as Xaro Xhoan Daxos, or the Spice King. Daxos proposes marriage to Dany many times, and every time he is rejected.

\-  While Jon is on a scouting mission, he comes across a few wild-lings. One is a female named Ygritte, who Jon takes captive. While captive, Ygritte makes many sexual advances toward Jon, and every time she is rejected.

* *Taken captive*.

\-  While a guest within Qarth, warlocks use magic and betrayal to steal Dany's dragons and lure her into their tower of a hideout. Once within the tower and past her visions (will discuss next), she is put into chains by the warlocks. She manages to escape by having her three dragons burn the warlock in front of her.

\-  While Jon has Ygritte captive, she manages to escape, lure Jon into an ambush, and take him as her prisoner.

* *Gain knowledge from enemies*.

\-  When Dany first enters the warlocks' tower, she begins to have visions. One is of King's Landing , only it's ruined and covered in snowy ash. (Possibly foreshadowing the series finale?????) After Dany escapes the visions and is put into chains, the warlocks' explain to tell her that her dragons are the source of the warlock's restored magic. Meaning it's possible her dragons brought magic back into the world.

\-   Jon and his group come to a house known as Craster's Keep, belonging to a man known for housing the Night's Watch north of the Wall. Jon comes to find out that Craster marries all his daughter's, they have his children, and the cycle repeats. If that wasn't bad enough, he then finds out Craster has been giving all of his son's to the White-Walkers (WW), as a sacrifice so they would leave him in peace.

* *Make a bold decision and head into the unknown*.

\-  After getting revenge on those within Qarth who plotted to steal her dragons and potentially harm her, Dany decides to take the now deceased Spice King's ships deeper into Essos towards Astapor and Slaver's Bay. This decision is bold because Dany doesn't know much about Essos and it's lands, and also it's the opposite direction of Westeros and the Iron Throne, Dany's ultimate goal.

\-  Now that Jon is a wild-ling captive, he makes the choice to go undercover and infiltrate the supposed ""largest wild-ling army ever"", by killing a fellow Night's Watchmen, Qhorin Half-Hand (Qhorin's idea). By doing so, the wild-lings believe he is a true deserter of the Night's Watch, keeping his cover for now.

**Season 3:**

* *Pretend to be naive and but up a powerful bluff.*

\-  Once is Astapor, Dany meets a slaver who frequently insults her in Valyrian. Little does he know Valyrian is Dany's native tongue, and Dany uses this to her advantage. Dany strikes up a bargain with the slaver: one dragon for eight-thousand Unsullied soldiers. Some of the fiercest warriors in the world. Dany is told by many not to make the deal, as a dragon is too powerful, but she is confident in her decision. When the time comes to make the deal, Dany commands one of her dragons to kill the slave-master, and takes the Unsullied for her own.

\-   Meanwhile in the deep North, Jon is under watch by the wild-lings, as few truly believe he has left the Night's Watch. His bluff is working, for now.

* *Overcome a large obstacle.*

\-  After Astapor, Dany sets her sights on the city of Yunkai. The Yunkai send sell-swords named the Second Sons to fight Dany's army, and one in particular named Daario Naharis to kill Dany. Daario decides to instead join Dany, and with his help, Dany's army conquers Yunkai.

\-  As a wild-ling, Jon and a small group are tasked with climbing the Wall itself. After almost falling on the way up, Jon survives the climb, largely with the help of Ygritte.

* *Intimate relationships.*

\-  Dany feels an initial attraction to Daario, and although they don't officially hook-up until Season 4, they form a ""friends-with-benefits"" relationship. Her first since the death of Drogo at the end of Season 1.

\-  After the thrill of conquering the Wall, Jon and Ygritte start an intimate relationship, but this one becomes serious. They form a relationship based on real love.

* *Begin to become true leaders.*

\-  Dany has now conquered and liberated two cities. She has three dragons, an army, and thousands of former slaves following her. The freed slaves have even taken to calling her ""mhysa"", which means Mother. She is becoming a queen.

\-  After escaping the wild-ling camp, and taking multiple arrows from Ygritte and his way out, Jon makes it back to the Wall and Castle Black. The first time in two seasons. He is now battle-tested, knows the wild-lings, and is ready to become a leader when his men need him most.

**Season 4:**

* *Fight for a moral high-ground.*

\-  Dany has now conquered two cities in Slaver's Bay, and makes her way towards a third, the city of Meereen. After approaching the city, and having Daario Naharis defeat Meereen's champion outside the city gates, Dany launches the collars of all the slaves she has already freed into the city. This sends a message that she is done with slavery, and anyone who joins her will never again be put into chains.

\-  Now that Jon has returned to The Wall, he is immediately faced with a problem. While Jon was undercover with the wild-lings, the Night's Watch party he began with were attacked by whites. The surviving men went to Craster's Keep, and while there, led a mutiny that resulted in Craster's death. As well as the death of their own Lord Commander, Jeor Mormont. Jon volunteers to take down the mutiny on the moral obligation to get revenge for his Lord Commander, but also because Jon grossly exaggerated the numbers of the Night's Watch. If the wild-lings make it to Crater's Keep and find out the real numbers, the wild-lings would attack the Wall and easily take it.

* *Answer injustice with justice.*

\-  Dany dispatches her Unsullied to infiltrate Meereen, start a slave revolt, and then open the city gates for the rest of her army. The plan works, and the city is hers. She then has 163 Great Masters killed, in response to the 163 children that were killed and strung-up along the path from Yunkai to Meereen.

\-  As mentioned above, Jon is on the way to put down the mutiny at Craster's. And as much as this was done to make sure the Night's Watch members there don't tell any wild-lings their true numbers, this was also done to get justice for Jeor. Jeor made Jon his steward, gifted him a Valyrian steel sword, mentored him like a father, and helped him grow into a man and a leader. Jon wants to avenge Jeor, and get some kind of justice against his fellow Night's Watch members that killed their own leader.

* *Forced to cage their beasts.*

\-  While in Meereen, a shepherd brings Dany the bones of his daughter, who was accidentally killed by her largest Dragon, Drogon. In response, Dany agrees to cage her dragons under the Great Pyramid of Meereen. She isn't able to catch Drogon, so only her other two dragons, Rhaegal and Viserion, are successfully caged.

\-  While putting down the mutiny at Craster's Keep, Jon reunites with his direwolf Ghost, who he had not seen since being capture by wild-lings in Season 2. But once he returns to Castle Black, he is ordered by Alliser Thorne, a high-raking member of the Watch that also hates Jon, to cage Ghost. Or risk it becoming food for the men.

**Season 5:**

* *Tempted by lineage.*

\-  Meereen is growing chaotic. Former slaves and masters are constantly fighting, and a secret organization known as the Sons of the Harpy are killing Unsullied soldiers. One such Harpy is found, and Dany at first wants the man executed. Her adviser, Ser Barristan Selmy, argues the man should have a trial. He then warns her of how her father, the Mad-King, acted. He went for execution over trial, and soon lost himself inside his own murderous desires.

\-  After the remaining wild-ling army was smashed by Lord Stannis Baratheon, the younger brother of former King Robert and technically the true king of Westeros , Stannis takes refuge at Castle Black. While there he makes Jon an offer, join him and rise as Jon Stark, Lord of Winterfell. After some consideration, Jon declines, stating he made a vow to the Night's Watch.

* G*ranted official titles.*

\-  In order to keep the piece in Meereen, Dany agrees to marry a noble from one of the city's most well-known houses, Hizdahr zo Loraq. Through this marriage, she is officially the Queen of Meereen, to those who already saw her this way and to the nobles who refused her claim.

\-  At Castle Black, it's now time to elect a new Lord Commander. At first, Alliser Thorne is the clear favorite and seems to have the election locked up. But then Samwell Tarly gives a passionate speech for Jon, and it's enough to sway his fellow men, leading Jon to become the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.

* *Working with different groups isn't easy.*

\-  Meereen is still at odds. Former slaves hate former masters, and vice versa. One slave murders the man that Dany wanted to put on trial. To try and fix the situation, Dany has that slave publicly executed. The other former slaves immediately turn on her, and any masters preset. Neither group is any happier, and worst now Dany has lost members from the one group that was originally with her.

\-  Things at Castle Black aren't going so well. Lord Stannis expects his troops taken care of, and is even trying to recruit wild-lings to his cause, a move that upsets the Night's Watch. The Night's Watch want revenge against any remaining wild-lings. The wild-lings that survived want revenge against the Night's Watch. And members of the Night's Watch are growing uneasy with: their new Lord Commander, lack of men and supplies, and wild-lings and Stannis' men always around them. This comes to a blow when Janos Slynt, the man responsible for betraying New Stark back in Season 1, publicly refuses the orders given by Jon. Jon responds by publicly executing Slynt, a move that pleases some and angers others.

* W*orking with the enemy.*

\-  As mentioned above, Dany marries a noblemen in order to better unite Meereen. And she also agrees to re-open the fighting pits to freedman only, something she has constantly been against. This move is a way of showing the masters she can respect their old traditions. And during her fist visit to a fighting pit practice exhibition, she is given a gift, Tyrion Lannister. All Dany knows of house Lannister is that they played a role in casting out her family, so naturally Tyrion is first seen as an enemy. But after some discussion, Dany agrees to allow Tyrion to counsel her. His knowledge of ruling and of Westeros are of great value.

\-  Jon must also work with his enemies. The Wall needs more men, and one of Jon's duties is to ask the lords of Westeros to send anyone they can spare. This includes Roose Bolton, the current warden of the North who betrayed the Starks and stole Winterfell. At first Jon refuses to send a letter to Roose, but is reminded the Night's Watch remains neutral. So he reluctantly asks. His next move is even bolder, he plans to allow the wild-lings to pass through the Wall and settle in the North as subjects of the Seven Kingdoms, or even let them join the Watch. Jon's idea is met with harsh criticism, but he points out that every single wildling left on the north side of the Wall will be killed, then resurrected, and then added to the White Walkers ever-growing army. Jon then leads a rescue mission to a place beyond-the-wall called Hardhome, in order to save wild-lings who were separated during Stannis' attack. The mission is a success, however; bringing even more wild-lings into Castle Black does not go over well with many of the Night's Watch.

* *Consequences of one's actions.*

\-  Dany is in attendance at the official opening of the fighting pits. Lately things in Meereen have cooled down, and everyone has relaxed their guard. Suddenly, Sons of the Harpy reveal themselves on every level of the arena and begin slaughtering both masters and freedmen alike  Hizdahr included. The new found peace was simply a distraction for this main attack. Dany and her companions are pushed toward the center of the pit, and just when they look to be in trouble, Drogon swoops down, defends Dany, and then leaves with her to an unknown location. Her city is at war again, this time without its queen.

\-  The night Jon returns from Hardhome, his squire Olly comes and tells him one of the wild-lings knows of the whereabouts of his uncle Benjen Stark, who has been missing since Season 1. Jon goes down and follows Thorne to a gathering of his Watch brothers, only to find a sign marked ""Traitor"". Thorne, Olly, and other members of the Night's Watch begin to stab Jon, each saying ""For the Watch"". Jon siding with the wild-lings may have been the right decision, but men who have fought them all their lives did not seen it this way. Jon collapses and seemingly dies from his wounds, bleeding out onto the cold snow.

**Season 6:**

* *Both are reborn, new, and improved?*

\-  After Drogon takes Dany away from Meereen, she is met by a massive Dothraki khalasar. She is taken prisoner, but once it's discovered she was married to a Khal, she is told she must join the Dosh Khalleen. A group of all the wives of fallen Khals. This doesn't sit well with Dany. All the Khals from across the land are gathered in their city Vaes Dothrak, and are deciding if Dany is allowed to join the Khalleen. Dany has another idea. She traps the Khals inside their meeting hut, sets the place on fire killing them all, and emerges reborn from fire once again as Daenerys Targaryen, the Unburnt.

\-  Jon was last seen bleeding out from his wounds delivered by his fellow Night's Watch members. The worst happens, and Jon dies. But Ser Davos isn't giving up. He enlists the help of the Red Witch Melisandre, to see if she can resurrect him. She is reluctant, but tries anyways. She preforms her spell, and it looks like it failed. But as everyone is leaving, Jon Snow opens his eyes, alive once again. His death also allows him to leave the Night's Watch, as his vows end now that he has died.

* *Revenge.*

\-  As mentioned above, Dany kills all the former Khals. They took her prisoner, insulted her, would have raped her, abused her, and would have made her remain a Dosh Khalleen. Her revenge was swift and powerful.

\-  A newly resurrected Jon has to take care of some unfinished business. The Night's Watchmen who killed him had all been captured, and were to face justice. Jon offers Thorne, Olly, and two other men a chance for any last words, and then has all four publicly hung. Revenge is his, even if it isn't so sweet.

* *Form a new army*.

\-  Once Dany burns all the Khals, she asks all the Dothraki to join her and her cause. They all agree, and suddenly Dany has a much larger force.

\-  Now that Jon is no longer apart of the Night's Watch, he isn't sure what to do. That changes when his ""sister"", Sansa Stark, arrives at Castle Black. She informs him that she ran from Winterfell, where she was married to the abusive Ramsay Bolton, and that his forces are looking for her. They eventually devise a plan to take back Winterfell, and defeat the Boltons. To do so, Jon and his allies ask any northern lords who haven't joined the Boltons to fight with him, as well as the wild-lings. Some agree, and an army is formed, but one smaller than they need.

* *Fight for their future.*

\-  While Dany has been gone, Tyrion has ruled Meereen in her place. He's a good ruler, but not as threatening as ""the mother of dragons"". So finally, all the slavers from Slaver's Bay begin an assault on Meereen. Just then, Dany and Drogon arrive and ready for battle. With a newly freed Rhaegal and Viserion, Dany and her three dragons begin burning the Slaver's fleet. They quickly begin retreating, but a message must be sent, so Dany has 2/3 of the former high-masters executed, and tells the third to spread the tale of what happened here. Of what happened when slavery tried to return to Meereen.

\-  Jon, and his out-numbered men, get ready to battle the Bolton's army for control of the North. They have a plan to make up for their lack of men, but that goes away once Ramsay releases Jon's youngest ""brother"" Rickon and has him run across the battlefield, while he shoots arrows at him. Jon makes it feet away from Rickon, right before an arrow hits and kills him. Enraged, Jon attacks the whole army, and his men follow. The battle is fierce, but it seems Ramsay has led Jon into a trap. Right when hope is lost, Sansa comes in with the Knights of the Vale and smash Ramsay's forces. Jon follows a fleeing Ramsay to Winterfell, and proceeds to beat the living crap out of Ramsay. The battle is won, and once again Starks rule Winterfell.

* *Begin a new chapter, stronger than ever.*

\-  Now that the slavers have been put down, ships and soldiers are plentiful, and the dragons are battle-ready, Dany is ready to set sail for Westeros. She has three dragons, and Unsullied army, a Dothraki horde, and alliances with both House Tyrell and Martell, two old and respected houses in Westeros. A new chapter begins, one that finally has Dany in Westeros!

\-  With the battle won the North is safe, and a Stark once again holds the North and Winterfell. Now they must figure out what's next. A lot of powerful, northern houses have been hurt in the constant warfare, and someone needs to lead. Lyanna Mormont, the new leader of House Mormont, stands and makes a case for Jon Snow. Although he's a Snow, he's still a Stark, and for the most part a Stark has always ruled the North. This fact, and Jon's proven merit, sway the other lords in attendance, and soon chants of ""the White Wolf"" and ""King of the North"" are shouted by almost everyone. Jon hesitantly, accepts the honor, out of duty and not for personal glory. A new chapter begins, and from a bastard to King of the North!

**Season 7:**

* *Plan for the future.*

\-  Now in Westeros, Dany plans to fight for the Iron Throne, and the Lannisters are her target. With all her strength at the ready, she and her advisers plan for war.

\-  Now as King of the North, Jon has more responsibility than ever. But the biggest threat is still that beyond the Wall, the WWs. Jon begins planning his tactics, one of which is convincing those in Westeros that the threat is even real.

* *End of similarities, because the meeting is here!*

\-  Dany is advised to invite Jon to Dragonstone, as he is gaining quite a reputation.

\-  Jon agrees and he and Davos make the journey.

\-  Jon arrives, and Fire and Ice are officially united!!!!!!!!!!

\-  Instantly the contrasts in styles are on full display. Dany is aggressive and more power-hungry (fire), while Jon is relaxed and focused on the bigger threat (ice).

Over the course of the rest of the season, their bond grows stronger. And finally, in the season finale, they hook up for the first time. This sets the stage for a wedding, and maybe even a child in Season 8.

That's all! A lot of info, but after seeing all their similarities it seems very much like Dany and Jon are the embodiment of Fire and Ice. I'm not sure how the book with deal with the Azor Ahai prophecy, but it seems like the show is simplifying it, and making Dany and Jon each a half of the prophecy. It works, and who knows this could all be right, or completely wrong. Just my interpretation of the material. Thanks for the read!",10,12,False,spoiler,,,,,

For me, one of the best leaders in the series is Tywin, who never swings a sword.  I just find it odd and wonder if people could help me understand why there is such a correlation.

I really liked Season 1-3, I still think that Season 4 is the best TV Season ever, I thought Season 5 was pretty good and I absolutely loved Season 6.

4 Episodes in Season 7, I don't feel the same ""vibe"" I felt in the other Seasons. There's just something missing in it, I don't know.  
The pacing and narration is so fast, that it's becoming annoying. I mean, look at Seasons 1-6. There are like 4 big battles (Blackwater, Watchers on Wall, Hardhome &amp; Battle of the Bastards), each of them has been built up for really long and the pay-off delivers. Now, I get it, the battle between the Lannisters and Daenerys is the one true big battle (outside of the White Walkers). But why is there an action scene and battle in nearly every episode? I have no investment if the Battles are coming so rapidly. For instance, The Reason Blackwater was so great, was because there was no battle for 18 episodes, and it was a great pay-off. 

  
The weirdest episode for me is ""The Spoils of War"". In general I feel like Season 7 is moving so quickly, that all the different character meetings slowly lose their uniqueness. And then, again a battle. Random Dothraki and a Dragon attacking the Lannisters.

But what I found weird about that battle is that the show runners actually wanted ME, to root for Daenerys.

How can I root for the primitive random Dothraki or a fuck'n Dragon, when I've got to love Bronn &amp; Jaime for over 6 Seasons?  
Am I the only one who hates dragons? For me it takes all the great things about a battle; it's like hey, let's do this one sided and let the dragon destroy everything. How am I supposed to root for ""the good"" guys, if they're completely random people and animals, when ""the bad"" guys are far more likable and even the underdogs?

I don't know about you guys, but Season 7 has some really great fan service, but feels completely disappointing for me, and does not bring out the same feelings as the other Seasons.",72,0,False,spoiler,,,,,
