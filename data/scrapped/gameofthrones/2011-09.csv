2,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2011-9-1,2011,9,1,11,k0usa,self.gameofthrones,Several Speculations with Open Spoilers on ALL BOOKS,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/k0usa/several_speculations_with_open_spoilers_on_all/,A_Polite_Noise,1314842450,"The following speculations are not mine alone; some I have arrived at on my own and some were called to my attention by others.  I have posted them in several posts now but I felt like gathering them all together and actually providing quotes from the book to support them.  I will be speculating that:


*Jon Snow will be alive in the next book, as Azor Ahai reborn*


*Sandor Clegane a.k.a. The Hound is alive*


*Jaqen H'Ghar is in Oldtown with Sam Tarly*




**Jon Snow will be alive in the next book, as Azor Ahai reborn**


In the prologue of A Dance with Dragons, Varamyr Sixskins implies that Jon Snow is a very powerful warg by his estimation:


""The gift was strong in Snow, but the youth was untaught, still fighting his nature...""


That same prologue sets up the notion that a warg can live on in the beast he wargs into after his human body has died.



In Melisandre's chapter, she grows irritated when her fires do not show her Stannis:


""Yet now she could not even seem to find her king.  *I pray for a glimpse of Azor Ahai, and R'hllor shows me only Snow.*""



Earlier in that same chapter, she describes how the flames show her Jon:


""His long face floated before her, limned in tongues of red and orange, appearing and disappearing again...now he was a man, now a wolf, now a man again.  But the skulls were here as well, the skulls were all around him.""


Throughout the book, Melisandre often warns Jon of danger - of ""daggers in the dark"" - and often accompanying these warnings she asks about the whereabouts of Ghost and suggests Jon keep his direwolf near him.



In the first book, Thoros - a drunken red priest - has power enough (presumably because the birth of dragons has increased magical potential in the world) to revive a dead knight (Beric) 7 times.  Another red priest, Moqorro, is able to save (albeit in a rather unsightly way) Victarion's sickly arm and restore its strength and functionality.  Melisandre is clearly stronger than these two, and is arguably the strongest practitioner of magic in the series thus far.  She is stronger at the Wall by her own admission (we know it isn't a lie because it is her own thoughts in her own POV chapter).



In Jon Snow's last chapter in A Dance with Dragons, his final word is a whispered ""Ghost"" before the 3rd and then 4th dagger stabbed him.  The speculation is that he wargs into ghost, saving his 'soul' or whatever essence he is outside of his dead body (as shown possible in the prologue both by Varamyr doing it and by Varamyr suggesting Jon was a powerful warg).  Jon Snow is actually Azor Ahai come again, as Melisandre's fires showed him when she asked to see Azor Ahai instead of Stannis.  The vision of him as a man, then a wolf, then a man, may be meant to speak of him warging into Ghost when his body is killed, only to return when Melisandre (a very powerful sorceress) fixes his body.




**Sandor Clegane a.k.a. The Hound is still alive**

In A Feast for Crows, Brienne is following a tip that The Hound has ""the Stark girl"" and, along with Septon Meribald, Podrick, Ser Hyle, and Dog, has traveled to where rumors of The Hound marauding originate.  There, the band of travelers come across a secluded sect of monks.  On the way to see the Elder Brother, they pass the stable where they see a huge black stallion, stomping its feet and fighting its reigns.  Ser Hyle calls it, ""A handsome beast"", and Brother Gillam says it is named Driftwood but ""was surely whelped in hell,"" and goes on to say how violent and ill-tempered the horse is.

When they reach the Elder Brother, he informs Brienne that ""The man you hunt is dead.""  He goes on to say:


""I buried him myself...I know a little of this man, Sandor Clegane...this was a bitter, tormented soul, a sinner who mocked both gods and men.  He served, but found no pride in service.  he fought, but took no joy in victory.  He drank, to drown his pain in a sea of wine.  He did not love, nor was he loved himself.  It was hate that drove him.  Though he committed many sins, he never sought forgiveness...you would have pitied him...if you had seen him at the end...He begged me for the gift of mercy, but I am sworn not to kill again...The Hound died there, in my arms.  You may have seen a big black stallion in our stables.  That was his warhorse, Stranger.""

Brienne takes this information and says dully, ""Sandor Clegane is dead.""  The Elder Brother replies, ""He is at rest.""  The Elder Brother immediately begins telling the story of how he was a knight, and says in this story that he changed from a sad, drunken, violent sinner, ""...when I died in the Battle of the Trident.""


The constant use of the name The Hound when speaking of who died, but saying that Sandor was not dead but rather ""at rest"", coupled with the immediate telling of a story of how the Elder Brother himself ""died"" in a way to be born again in faith suggests that the same has happened to Sandor Clegane.


Also supporting this is that as Brienne and her group arrived at the sect, before talking with the Elder Brother, this happens:


""On the upper slopes they saw three boys driving sheep, and higher still they passed a lichyard where a brother bigger than Brienne was struggling to dig a grave.  From the way he moved, it was plain to see that he was lame.  As he flung a spadeful of the stony soil over one shoulder, some chanced to spatter against their feet.  'Be more watchful there,' chided Brother Narbert.  'Septon Meribald might have gotten a mouthful of dirt.'  The gravedigger lowered his head.  When Dog went to sniff him he dropped his spade and scratched his ear.""


This gravedigging brother with a limp and an affinity for dogs is quite possibly the born-again Sandor Clegane, ""lame"" from his injuries and still as fond of dogs as he had once told Sansa he was.





**Jaqen H'Ghar is in Oldtown with Sam Tarly**


In the prologue of A Feast for Crows, a man kills the prologue POV character, Pate.  The man is described:



""He was just a man, and his face was just a face. A young man's face, ordinary, with full cheeks and the shadow of a beard. A scar showed faintly on his right cheek. He had a hooked nose, and a mat of dense black hair that curled tightly around his ears. It was not a face he recognized.""



This description matches exactly the description of the face Jaqen takes after he helps Arya and the North take Harrenhal:


""I do. My time is done."" Jaqen passed a hand down his face from forehead to chin, and where it went he changed. His cheeks grew fuller, his eyes closer; his nose hooked, a scar appeared on his right cheek where no scar had been before. And when he shook his head, his long straight hair, half red an half white, dissolved away to reveal a cap of tight black curls.""



At the end of A Feast for Crows, Sam arrives in Oldtown and is greeted by Pate.  This is actually Jaqen, who is most certainly a Faceless Man, who has killed Pate and taken his identity for reasons still unknown to us.

I hope to god that they make a season 2 and hopefully extend to one more season if they do not cover all the plot which the show is based. a couple questions thought

1. is season1 100% based off the book?

2. is the show going to completely follow the book?

3. would the fanbase be pleased to see HBO continue the series further after the completion of the books plot?

Question 2: I'm finding it difficult to believe that Westeros (in particular Varys) has not heard that Daenarys is the Mother of the three Dragons, surely this would be reported hand in hand with the stories of three dragons/a three headed dragon after she sacks three cities and proclaims her title wherever she goes.. has anyone else found this a bit puzzling?

In the explanation of the origins of the faceless men Valaria is described as being built on top of 14 volcanoes. All of which were mined. Plus, the Doom is generally described as some hot and smoky destruction, which would fit in. I think Euron also described hat the Doom was still on in Valaria, i.e. the volcanoes are still active.

Plus, it fits into the whole fire motif that is going on with Valaria and that part of the world.

In fact, if you take the world geography to be somewhat based on Europe (Westeros = UK, with its many kingdoms. Wall = hadrians wall yada yada), Valaria would roughly be int he direction/space of Pompeii.

A little preface, my friend gave me GoT right before the show premiered and here 3 months later I find myself without any more ASoIaF. I've read the essays on the Tower of the Hand and can't get enough of GRRM's stories (I plan on getting those Egg stories next). So if you haven't read the speculation essays on Tower of the Hand there's talk of that next.

So let's get into it.
Jon Snow, dead or alive? Lord Snow seems too important to die, the Dragon has three heads right?

Now, what are the wildlings going to do about this attempt on his life. Furthermore, was he really going to break his oath and march to Winterfell?

And what about the Boltons, I'm pretty sure the entirety of the Bolton letter was a fabrication save for the bit about Mance. I'm glad Theon got the girl and is reunited with his sister.

Tyrion and Mormont? Woow, after SoS I was reaaally hoping I would get some super adventures of Tyrion and Varys going 'round the world. But any chapter with Tyrion is a good chapter. Now, was Tyrion's deal with the sellswords to join Daenerys or go back to Westeros?

Now onto Varys, wtf is his end game? Is he only loyal to the Targaryans and breeds chaos for them? Also my heart let out a little cry when I realized it was Kevan POV for the epilogue, as GRRM kills the prologue and epilogue characters.

Speaking of Targaryans, Daenerys just got picked up by Drogo's former bloodrider. That's going to be interesting, I'm thinking she won't have her dragons fully tamed and ready to invade Westeros until the end of the next book(If there's only going to be 7).

Also, what's up in the Vale? ADwD didn't touch up on that at all, and AFfC wasn't all that about Sansa and Littlefinger much as well.

Also I wanna give out a shout out to Barristan Selmy and Strong Belwas. I think Selmy is going to do all right in Mereen until Daenerys comes back. Oh and the bodies which the trebuchets were launching I think could have been the hostages or pox ridden corpses.

I'm sure I'll think of more later on, I hope you all enjoyed the book as much as I did. I'm already ready to give the series another good read.

EDIT: First thing I could think of, what's up with Bran and his two buddies? Jorjen doesn't seem to be doing too well. . . And what happens when winter happens, wont the writes take over everything north of the wall and Brand and his new teacher will be kinda boned?",22,9,False,self,,,,,

Standing hard against the sunset sea at the western edge of the known world, Westeros stretches from 
the red sands of Dorne in the south to the icy mountains and frozen fields of the north,
where snow falls even during the long summers.

* The children of the forest were the first known inhabitants of Westeros, during the Dawn of Days: a race
small of stature who made their homes in the greenwood, and carved strange faces in the bone-white
weirwood trees. Then came the First Men, who crossed a land bridge from the larger continent to the
east with their bronze swords and horses, and warred against the children for centuries before finally
making peace with the older race and adopting their nameless, ancient gods. The Compact marked the 
beginning of the Age of Heroes, when the First Men and the children shared Westeros, and a hundred petty
kingdoms rose and fell.

* Other invaders came in turn. The Andals crossed the narrow sea in ships, and with iron and fire they
swept across the kingdoms of the First Men, and drove the children from their forests, putting many of
the weirwoods to the ax. They brought their own faith, worshiping a god with seven aspects whose
symbol was a seven-pointed star. Only in the far north did the First Men, led by the Starks of Winterfell,
throw back the newcomers. Elsewhere the Andals triumphed, and raised kingdoms of their own. The
children of the forest dwindled and disappeared, while the First Men intermarried with their conquerors.

* The Rhoynar arrived some thousands of years after the Andals, and came not as invaders but as
refugees, crossing the seas in ten thousand ships to escape the growing might of the Freehold of Valyria.
The lords freeholder of Valyria ruled the greater part of the known world; they were sorcerers, great in
lore, and alone of all the races of man they had learned to breed dragons and bend them to their will.
Four hundred years before the opening of A Song of Ice and Fire , however, the Doom descended on
Valyria, destroying the city in a single night. Thereafter the great Valyrian empire disintegrated into
dissension, barbarism, and war. Westeros, across the narrow sea, was spared the worst of the chaos 
that followed. By that time only seven kingdoms remained where once there had been hundredsbut they would not stand for much
longer.

* A scion of lost Valyria named Aegon Targaryen landed at the mouth of the Blackwater with a
small army, his two sisters (who were also his wives), and three great dragons. Riding on dragonback,
Aegon and his sisters won battle after battle, and subdued six of the seven Westerosi kingdoms by fire,
sword, and treaty. The conqueror collected the melted, twisted blades of his fallen foes, and used them
to make a monstrous, towering barbed seat: the Iron Throne, from which he ruled henceforth as Aegon,
the First of His Name, King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, and Lord of the Seven
Kingdoms.
The dynasty founded by Aegon and his sisters endured for most of three hundred years. Another Targaryen king,
Daeron the Second, later brought Dorne into the realm, uniting all of Westeros under a single ruler.
He did so by marriage, not conquest, for the last of the dragons had died half a century
before.

However, I'm inclined to be permanently suspicious when it comes to this book series and when I read the Epilogue, apart from the surprising ending, one other thing really caught my eye.
There have been more than enough references to Garth the Gross throughout all 5 books, but it is when the narrative describes Garth as ""(Mace Tyrell's) his uncle. Lord Seneschal of Highgarden, whom men called Garth the Gross."" Could this be setting up a twist in the story in either of the next two books?
I'm thinking that Victarion will sail into Meereen, be overcome and Daenerys will claim the Dragon Horn and tame the Dragons. After that she will finally make the journey to Westeros and reclaim the Iron Throne, and Highgarden will ally with her. This paves the way for Garth the Gross, or the 'Perfumed' Seneschal to betray her as well.
Kevan Lannister in the Epilogue has his suspicions in the Epilogue that Mace Tyrell wanted to make Garth the Master of Coin, so this would also fit with the Prophecy in the Palace of Dust, specifically the Betrayal for Gold."")

DO NOT READ ON IF YOU'RE NOT FINISHED!

Allright. I literally put it down an hour ago. Then I grabbed a beer. Then I sat down and started to write. Long rant following.

I'm disappointed. Let's go by character here. From best to worst IMO.


The Good:

Tyrion (big surprise, I know): 

Awesome as always, but why? Wittiness? Sure! As always. Brilliant character and obviously fan-service to put that much of him into this. I'm not complaining, mind you. Tyrion was one of the few trickles of water in this desert of a book.  His chapters were awesome for one major reason. THINGS KEPT HAPPENING! He made more way then all of the other characters combined. He did what the other characters were doing until now. Plotting, saving his hide, changing allegiances, making observations and ACTING upon them. Pretty much what all the characters were doing in most of the books. Here he stands almost alone.

Arya: 

There wasn't much of her in here, but again, THINGS HAPPENED. We see her character growing and accomplishing things. We see where her path takes her. We see she hasn't forgotten what her motivation is yet, but we also guess, that she might, in time. And that troubles me.

Theon: 

I didn't care for him at all until this book, and I didn't really care for his plight, but his unique perspective gave interesting insights into affairs otherwise unwitnessed. I liked how he grew from an (understandably) insufferable low-life to something resembling a human being, able to take his fate in his own hands and regaining his wits and part of his pride again. I was with him, I felt with him, I understood him. Things happened.

Melisandre: 

Interesting and necessary chapter to humanize her. Probably the most important chapter in the book concerning the future of the series.


not as good:

Davos: 

Had a nice build-up through his few chapters with a nice, if foreseeable twist at the end. Sadly, leads nowhere yet. Mostly Setup.

Cersei: 

Again. Not much of her in here, but it answered and resolved her cliffhanger. Though I doubt it, it might even be the last we see of her.  Might be she's done. Classic example of the higher you climb the farther you fall. It was an interesting read and it showed her as more compassionate as I had remembered her. Still her role was too short to really care for her given her past actions. Kevans death will probably give her a bigger role again. We'll see. mostly Setup

Jamie: 

One Chapter. Managed to end a stalemate. Fair enough. Since missing. Whu...?

Selmy: 

Nice new perspective at the end. ""Fire and Blood"" gave me the chills. Got things rolling, took action were Sansa II would not. Would read more about him.
Still Setup.

Asha: 

Her first chapter was a nice read, and since GRRM doesn't seem to care to give us insights into the minds of Kings, the only possible perspective on Stannis. Started alright, ended in 30 pages of nothing at all. Setup.

Victarion:

Interesting new asshole aboard. Entertaining, still a setup.

Connington: 

I don't yet care. Will be important for sure, and it was nice to meet him again after he *parted* ways with Tyrion and to get a look into his head. Setup.

Bran:

Boring, boring, boring, HODOR!, boring, boring, WIGHTS! Boring, THREE-EYED-CROW!, FUCKING SETUP!!! 
also getting Theon trippy


WORSE

Jon

He fills as many pages as Tyrion I guess. And it starts out promising. What with actually making an example of Slynt and all. Then: Bowing to Stannis, to Selyse, endless defending of his actions to his subordinates and spending his pages making further SETUPS: Get the wildlings over the wall! (Sorry, that's the one thing he actually did.) Send all of our ships for more wildlings that might be dead already into the autumn storms! What about food? Let's inspect the storage-cellars for some pages. So that guy that sired his own grandchildren did not die in that fire? Better let him rescue my sister. What about food? We need money! That reminds me, we also need more food. Oh look, how convenient, a banker that will lend money to me. Who goes where on the wall? Let me think about that for some chapters.  I guess I better send some of my trusted brothers north at the start of winter to rescue random wildings by escorting them and bringing them food we don't have enough of, as I've never before stated, because the ships we didn't have sank to the surprise of absolutely noone. Also, let's send wildlings south, with me, for vengeancey feelings after I didn't act on them after the death of my father, or Bran and Rickon, or even that bitch of my step-mother, while I wasn't yet the FRICKIN LORD COMMANDER! BOOM! HEADSHOT! THE END!

Really? I understand his motivations and why he's doing what he's doing, but do we have to fill that many pages with this nonsense? This arc is actually pretty good, but its stretched to thin like not enough butter on a piece of bread. (-.- sorry) This could have been cut in half easily and would have made for a tighter/ better read without loosing anything. I don't care about his death . Melisandre will probably see to it (and I look forward to Jon/ Ghost warging the shit out of that boar), but when they struck him down Ceasar style, all I could think of was: ""Maybe you should have actually DONE something sooner!""


Daenerys

I'm not going to go into great detail as she's pretty much like Jon. Starts out nice enough. Dragon eating more then sheep, but then, nothing. Did we need her holding court and not-fucking and sometimes fucking Dhaario for three quarts of the book before it finally came to what we've waited for since those Dragons hatched? And once again. Setup, as it ends in a stupid cliffhanger I didn't even care about anymore.


The absolute worst

Quentyn: 

What the fuck was that for? Seriously? Couldn't one of the numerous assholes in Mereen, (the Harpy anyone?) or one of the Yunkish try to free the dragons to the same effect? Just for this to happen Quentyn had a far too long, far too boring setup. Do we actually NEED a POV character die off in every book just for the sake of it? The book would be none the worse without him.


Honorary mention:
Kevan: Nice chapter. Feels like the story might finally get rolling again. Too bad we have to wait ten years for any follow-up. 

Final words

I did enjoy the book, no mistake, but there was just such an abhorrent waste of pages everywhere and the sudden urge to introduce even more new POV characters, only some of which I deem important for the future yet, as well as the tendency to waste perfectly good pages on perfectly good characters doing absolutely nothing (Jon, Dany) while seemingly cutting short on characters that might have much more to tell (Cersei, Jamie, Selmy).

Well, with that amount of set-up at least there's bound to happen something in the next book...


Also I think I forgot a Sand-Sister Chapter can't be bothered to look it up right now."")

So I'm thinking after finishing aDwD that I really wanna get behind this new young Aegon as a protagonist. Even though the chapters involving him were scarce, I found the Jon Connington storyline really fascinating for a variety of reasons, including the insight into the past of Westeros it gives us, and the addition of another contender to add to the main power struggle in the seven kingdoms (which has always been my favorite storyline to follow.

This kinda coincides with how my feelings toward the Daenerys storyline have changed. She was never my favorite character, but in the first 3 books I could always find most parts of her story pretty interesting, and I was enjoying the anticipation of waiting for her to show up in Westeros and massively alter the balance of power as well as bring the Targaryen family back into the picture. But I just could not STAND the Meereen story in aDwD, and even though hopefully Dany's gonna continue her journey sometime soon, I can't help but see her as this petulant, annoying child who I'm not excited about seeing as a ruler anymore.

I'm much more intrigued by young Aegon's entry into Westeros with the Golden Company, and the promise of how he can affect the story. If he truly is Rhaegar's son, then he has by far the strongest claim on the throne of anyone alive. And I know, I've read all the speculation that he's a fake, which I definitely accept is a possibility. I'm really hoping that GRRM didn't introduce him to be cannon fodder for the next book and for there to be some big reveal about how he's a fake so that he can get killed off and make way for Dany, even though I know that's likely since Dany's been around for the whole series.

But with all the characterizations we've ben given, plus Varys' explanations in the epilogue about how Aegon has been bred from birth to make an enlightened ruler, living with the common folk and learning the history and faith of Westeros, I just found his storyline especially compelling. I know I'm probably rooting for a dying storyline, but I'm gonna hold out hope! What did everyone else think of the Aegon/Jon Connington introduction?",29,7,False,self,,,,,

Anyway, these are my favorite moments:

1) AFFC: Septon Meribald's ""Broken Men"" speech (This is the heart of a book that deals with the consequences of actions.  In a series that focuses on players, this provides a sobering reminder of the grim lives of the pieces in the game)

2) ASOS: Oberyn vs. The Mountain (I never in the entire series wanted anything as much as I wanted Oberyn to break The Mountain.  And he does, though in a sick twist he dies doing it.)

3) ASOS: Sansa building a snow castle (The Eyrie provides the perfect setting for this beautiful scene.  It is one of the few locations untouched by the war that has ravaged Westeros.  We get a rare chance to reflect on everything that was lost.)

4) ADWD: The introduction of Reek (When I realized who Reek was I felt sick for having ever wished any harm on Theon.  Nobody deserves that kind of degradation.  His redemption was the most interesting part of this book.)

5) AGOT: Catelyn's wish for peace right before Robb is crowned King in the North.  (Her desire to keep what remains of her family is all the more tragic when you realize how impossible peace ever was in a world like this.  Her small voice of reason is drowned out by a cry for blood and war.)",21,18,False,self,,,,,

I feel the breed used on the show look too much like domesticated dogs, when i first saw them as adults (the dogs not their characters) i immediately thought they had german shepherd ears so I wasn't surprised when i looked up Norther Inuits and read they were derived from german shepherds and alaskan malamutes. Even malamutes and husky mix have more of a wolfy look to me.

I'm very sensitive to the concern of not ruining anything for people still making their way through the books (though I think reading this reddit before finishing them is almost *asking* to get accidentally spoiled, but that's not my point) and I am pretty careful with mine where they aren't otherwise marked.

But I've been seeing a lot of threads where the spoiler limit is **very clearly** marked in the title, and yet people are arbitrarily commenting about marking spoilers in the comments. If a post says ""Blah blah blah (Spoilers from all books)"" how could that be any clearer? The spoiler tags are a great feature, but they can be cumbersome when trying to write multi-paragraph posts and get in depth about things. These threads are around for those of us who have finished all the books and want to have diverse discussions about them where anything from any book could be brought up, so why should we agonize over covering every little possible detail that may or may not count as a spoiler?

I'm all for erring on the side of caution when it's up in the air as to whether to cover something or not, but if a post is clearly stated to be a discussion with spoilers from all the books, can we dispense with the random, ""Might wanna cover that bro!"" comments?",3,14,False,self,,,,,

  - Season 4: Storm of Swords part 2 with some Feast for crows (Ironborn + Dorne)
  - Season 5: A Dance with Dragons plus most of feast for crows

Feast for Crows is good and really helps introduce more of the factions playing the game of thrones and their motives (Dorne, Ironborn) but it doesn't really have that much action, and I think it would do them well to use it to pad out the freight train of action and events that is ASoS.

Assuming this is correct, will they have to wait five or more years for A Dream of Spring if the tv show catches up?
Even if they do it differently I can't see it ever NOT catching up to the books unless they take year breaks every now and again.

My mum read The Hobbit to my brother and I as a bedtime story, and when we were old enough, we read LotR on our own. I just loved the world, the languages, and the characters.

Unfortunately, I haven't really enjoyed many Fantasy series since reading Tolkien. I can't help but draw comparisons to Tolkien and most series I tried turned out to be cheap imitations at best. I think the problem was that the plots weren't character-driven or even thematically-driven; they were based on magic and not much else.

Then I heard about aSoIaF. Actually, I heard about the TV show. I was wary of the words ""If you like Tolkien, you'll LOVE this"", but for once they actually turned out to be true. I decided to watch the first season of GoT and then decide whether or not to invest my time/money in reading the books.

Suffice it to say, I loved it. I was enchanted by the characters, plots and most of all, the apparent lack of reliance on magic to drive the plot. I mean, there are obviously some magical elements, but they're not arbitrary. They fit the characters, the world and the situation. 

I then decided to read the books, and I think the series as a whole is  amazing, and I think I love it because it's *not* like Tolkien. At all. No Elves, no Orcs, and the Dwarves are not bearded miners.

The one thing I won't do is compare Tolkien to GRRM. Both have their strengths and weaknesses in terms of writing, but they're really too different to compare. Tolkien built his world on its languages and mythology; GRRM built his on a lake of his readers' tears. Tolkien is about clinging on to hope in the face of dire circumstances, the triumph of good over evil, etc; GRRM reminds us that there are no absolutes. 

Just my two stags ;)

* Tyrion Lannister - Completely different than Peter Dinklage, but it worked for me.

* Tywin Lannister - At first he did a gruff voice that I liked, but later he changed it.

* Davos Seaworth - Sounds exactly how I would expect a salty ex-smuggler to sound.


One thing I did not like is that he basically had two voices for every female character.  I was happy that he initially used a regular voice for female PoV characters, but that ended up changing (Dany being the worst).  Also, his voice for Robb really threw me off.  He sounded much older than he was supposed to be.

- rides/""experiences""  
- merchandise  
- settings, decoration  
- food and drinks

Rides:  
- Dragon rollercoaster.    
- The Wall vertical drop ride.  
- Ranger's Quest ride.   Ride along with the Night's Watch on a quest north of the wall.  Would be a thrill ride/sort of scary. (Similar to Hogwarts, Spiderman, Simpsons, Men in Black rides at Universal.  semi-rollercoaster/imax/set interaction...hard to describe if you haven't seen it)

- Weirwood

- Braavosi sword fighting lessons  
- Induction into Night's Watch

Here's my deal.  I've read all the books, and they are my absolute favorite series of novels I have ever read in my life.  That being said, I was excited when the show came out as my wife who does not read much fantasy/sci-fi agreed to watch the show with me since I loved the books so much.  So we watched the entire series, she didn't really like it, and I kind of have to agree with her.  

I'm not quite certain why that is though.  I recognize that the production is top notch.  The sets, the wardrobe, the graphics, it really does feel like Westeros and after watching the show I really interepreted the visuals as I was reading ADWD.  The fights were very well choriographed as well, the action was gripping, and there was a sufficient amount of gore to give it that signature HBO only feel.  

Plus the chicks are hot.

But I am still not sure what my problem was with the show.  My wife would say, ""it just wasn't that interesting, I never really got into it"".  Again I have to agree, but why?  I have 2 ideas:

1)The Dailogue. 

Honestly, while staying true to much of the dialogue of the books, I feel it just didn't transpose very well to the screen.  I found that in the books the inner narration was the key driver to make you love and respect each character, it's what made them believeable.  But when you cut all of that out and don't add anything additional to the dialogue, the character's loose their heart.  Basically I just didn't become invested in the characters.  (Tyrion's lines did the best for his character, the others all left something lacking).

2) The acting.

Don't get me wrong, I love Sean Bean too, but I think that for most of the actors (including him) it felt more like a play being filmed than a television series.  Most actors seemed to be reading the lines as a vehicle to get the sentences not, not actually convey emotions with passion.  (Again some exceptions, like Tyrion and I think Arya was excellent).  But overall, it just...well I was disappointed. 

Again I'm not sure if I'm alone on this because most everything I hear is how much people loved the show, but for whatever reason I just didn't get blown away as I had expected.  

What pisses me off about it is that it's really hard to say why. 


TL:DR:  I recognize the show was very well made, it just didn't suck me in or get me emotionally invested.  Im not sure, but maybe it was the script or the acting.

The scene I am referring to is when Robb visits Bran for the last time before he goes to war with the Lannisters.  After Robb leaves, Bran emerges from the shadows (as he is wont to do in the show...) and this exchange takes place:

RICKON: They've all gone away.

BRAN: They'll be back soon.  Robb will free father, and they'll come back with mother.

RICKON: **No, they won't.**

He says that line with almost stone cold certainty and as we know, he was right.  None of them come back - not Robb, not Catelyn, and not Ned. This glimpse of Rickon is seen again when Bran finds him in the crypt (emerging from the shadows again) saying, with stone cold certainty, that he saw their father there, and seems to be more aware of that fact than Bran.  While I'm not sure if it was meant by the show's writers to be intentional foreshadowing (and pretty blunt, at that), if it is then it may mean Rickon has more of the 'third eye' in him than previously thought.  At the end of all this, Rickon may turn out to be the most important Stark of them all.  Pure speculation, I know, but I like the angle the show took on it.

**tl,dr** Rickon may have prophecized the doom of his family in the show, and it may be an interesting angle the show is taking on his chracter.",18,23,False,self,,,,,

He said he wanted to make Jon his heir and legitimize his blood legally, but Catelyn tried to convince him otherwise. She left before anything was fully completed though, and with her left our eyes into the scene.

What do people think happened? It seems like a loose thread hanging out there for several books and I'm really curious about it.

The north seems defeated, but as it is said in the first book, the North is larger than the other seven kingdoms combined. Most of them hate the Boltons and the Freys and are full of anger over what happened. A legitimate heir could be something to unite them. If Robb's ""will"" doesn't end up being brought up again, perhaps this is where Rickon will become important when the Onion Knight goes to find him. I think Bran has a different role to fulfill, so it would be left on Rickon.

If Varys knew that Dany was pregnant, he was obviously getting information in less than 9 months. However, he never brought up the dragons that were ravaging cities and being displayed to everyone who asked. Only now, with a new master of whispers, has it even been mentioned to Cersei. A few possibilities come to mind:  
  

* Varys knew and didn't tell Cersei  
* The information was coming entirely from Jorah Mormont and he stopped relaying it to Varys  
* They are on a different timeline (although much of the ravaging is definitively occuring after Jeoffrey becomes king)

A couple of times I've been in a thread specifically about the TV series and seen a ""Book Spoiler"" tag and moused over it, expecting the spoiler to be something from A Game of Thrones (which I've finished reading), since season 1 = book 1. Unfortunately though since threads discussing the show often contain bits and pieces from the other books, I've gotten spoiled for some things since ""Book Spoiler"" doesn't specify *which* book. I can't be the only one that's made this mistake! (...Right?)

So instead of just using [Book Spoiler](/b ""Snape kills Dumbledore""), it might be more prudent (and easier for idiots like me who don't learn the first time) to include the book title in the warning, like [A Clash of Kings Book Spoiler](/b ""Snape kills Dumbledore"") etc. Mods could even add each in the sidebar for easy copy/paste, if it please them.

Sure we could just avoid all book spoiler tags, but that kind of sucks for people like me who want to participate in discussions, but who are in the middle of the series.

This looks like an awesome community, and hopefully before long I'll be qualified to join it by being familiar with the mythos. I'm reading through AGoT at the moment -- I actually started it some time ago, put it down, and then picked it up again after watching the first few episodes of the TV series.

My question is, how is time measured? Since there are multiple years to a season, rather than vice versa, what constitutes a year? I know they have years; I see references to name days, instead of birthdays. My first thought is that Westeros uses a lunar calendar, a la the Islamic calendar -- I seem to remember a mention of a destroyed second moon at some point, so I know there's one moon. But it's also possible, I suppose, that there are some really good Westeros astronomers who know how many days pass between times when star X rises at the same time that the sun sets, or whatever.

Say you're a criminal and you get given the choice of the wall or getting one of your extremities cut off. You choose the wall, so you go into training to be a man of the nightswatch. At this point you're still a recruit (if you volunteered you could still go home). The training seems to be time based i.e. you graduate after a certain amount of time without having to do any tests or pass an exam. But you're still not a MAN of the nightswatch, you haven't taken the oath so you cant be done for desertion and you don't have to worry about Ned Stark taking your head.

When the time comes to say your words, what if you don't want to?

So, why is that relevant? Well, my theory is that Varys and Illyrio are still running the same scam, but in a slightly bigger scale. When Varys started working for Aerys, his plan was to take the throne away from the Targaryen. We have at least one indication (which might be just a rumor) of Varys making Aerys suspicious of Rhaegar. It might well be that the influence Varys had in the time leading up to Robert's rebellion was much higher than we know. After Robert won the war, and the Targaryen lost their throne, Varys took care of protecting his future customers, making sure both Aegon and Viserys and Daenerys would reach the Free Cities. Now he and Illyrio are running the second part of the scam: sell the throne back to the Targaryens.

The only thing I'm missing is what's the price. Sure, wealth and power are nice, but both can be had by other means, and both Illyrio and Varys have enough of that. Lands, lordships, and all that is pretty meaningless if you have no heirs, as is the case for both men (at least that's what I think about Illyrio, and the lack of balls in Varys' case would make it difficult too).",26,22,False,self,,,,,

But now I don't know what to do...I know the second season of the TV series doesn't come out until Spring 12 (?), but I don't want to wait to continue the story.  Should I read the books even though I only know the saga from the first TV season? 

Should I just wait it out, and read the books after the series?  Will reading the books ruin the rest of the series for me?

Or is it all a moot point because the books are superior?  I'd appreciate any thoughts, I don't want to lose any of the excitement I've got for this epic.",31,8,False,self,,,,,

Apart from GRRM and Tolkien, I've never read fantasy novels before. The fantasy section of the bookstore (we still have one or two left just (UK)) is a bit of a mystery to me. 

What other fantasy books would you kind people recommend (or other books in general) for those who have enjoyed aSoIaF?

Lassie was barking madly and running towards the door and back to the middle of the room and barking, and back to the door, again and again. ""What's the matter Lassie"", asked Robb. ""Are you hungry"", inquired Jon.  Lassie kept barking and running back and worth.  Jon and Robb looked at each other, shrugged, and went back to reading.

Lassie had gone somewhere but returned soon after, dragging a container of tar derived liquid the pyromancers called ""gas"".  Then Lassie started barking again.  ""Look at this"", said Robb, ""Lassie is  running back and forth between this gas and that leaking cauldron. Just back and forth, gas to leak, leak, gas, gas, leak, over and over again."" ""Are you thirsty"", said Jon to Lassie. Lassie sat down, looked at both of them and slowly tilted her head. 


Lassie had left again, but soon returned once more, this time dragging a large sheet of parchment. Then Lassie snatched a piece of charred wood, which had tumbled out of the fire. Holding it in her teeth, Lassie began to write on the parchment. ""Look at this Roob"", said Jon. ""What's it say"", asked Robb, as both got up to take a closer look at what Lassie was up to.  Jon tried to comprehend Lassie's markings. ""Well it looks like it says"", mumbled Jon: ""There is a gas leak and you two will die unless you lave this inn NOW!"" ""What an odd thing for a dog to write"", pronounced Robb. 

Jon and Robb look at each other again. ""Do you know what this means"", asked Jon. ""I have no idea"", answered Robb. ""But I do feel a bit sleepy, I think I'll go take a nap."" Jon agreed, ""Yes, I feel a bit sleepy too, perhaps a good rest will clear both our heads."" 

Robb and Jon headed for their rooms, as Lassie was banging her head against the wall.

Loved all of Dany's chapters, loved her struggle and difficulty with ruling a conquered city, loved how she always yearns for peace, loved the dragon riding, and loved the cliffhanger to her storyline. Is she going to unite the khalasars under her rule?

Loved Tyrion's travel to Meereen and the way he joined the Second Sons.

Loved the way Jon made all the tough and right decisions and how that cost him his life. Maybe we'll see.

Loved the price Cersei had to pay and can't wait to watch her screw things up some more.

Loved Arya's training and can't wait to see were it will lead her.

Loved Bran's development as a Greenseer. Can't wait to see how we will affect Westeros from now on.

Can't wait for Davos to find Rickon and what will come of it.

Loved Theon's storyline.

Might be forgetting someone.

Loved this book. Also loved the previous one. I can never understand how can people say ASoS was better than AFfC or ADwD. The books keep getting better and better.

(Late I know but with school starting what are you going to do?)  Thinking back through the book I was trying to decided which scenes I would be most excited to see transferred to the small screen during HBO's television series.

1. The fight with the Dragon in the pit.

While reading this chapter I had to stop myself a few times cause it was just so awesome.  Not only will the build-up be epic and violent with all the matches going on but we also get to witness that creative magic and connecting of story lines when Dany saves Tyrion &amp; Penny from the lions without recognizing who they are.  Then BAM there is a (I hope) ridiculously sweet dragon in the middle of the pit, roasting people, tearing limbs off, generally causing mayhem.  Finally, we get our heroine coming to tame a dragon...with a whip?!  Her hair gets set aflame but she still mounts that raging beast and off they go into the sky.

3. Cersei's walk through King's Landing

How sweet will this be?  I found myself smiling the whole chapter.  I don't think anything was more satisfying than when Joffrey got his deserved end.  Honestly, I even gained a little respect for her during the whole ordeal because she faced it so bravely and held here head up high...And then she ruined it at the end and showed everybody how much of a wimp she really is.  All I have to say HBO is that this scene better be decently long and you better not skip the shaving scene before hand :) Lena Headey is quite a beautiful lady and her being shaved would not be something to miss.

So yea, tell me if you have any scenes that you are super excited to see get transferred to film.  Try to limit it to aDwD since that is the spoiler I posted but I won't be that mad if you don't.

Edit: I have no idea why both are labeled with 1.  I have changed it to 2. many times and it keeps changing it back.  Not important.",20,6,False,self,,,,,

The only character that seems completely different to me was Renly. In the books, he's a casual, charismatic jokester type of guy. In the show, he's kind of a tight ass. He never smiles and he's prissy.

I was completely shocked when he got killed off in ACoK because they never brought up his gayness in the books (as well as his relationship with Loras) and I just assumed that it was going to play out later. I remember a line here or there that might have kind of hinted at him being gay, but there was nothing really solid.

1. 
What was the deal with little lord Arryn (the snivelly turd) going to Casterly Rock Or Dragonstone?  It seemed like Catelyn always thought it was one place andevrybody else thought it was the other?  Why the confusion and what's the significance of the confusion?  What would going to one place over the other mean?

1. 
Beric Dondarion?  Whats his deal?  Who was he?  Who was he allied with?  Why did he go off thr grid?  Why does he keep coming up (is he some sort of lord of someplace special, a good warrrior, etc...)?

1. 
What happened with Stannis's army during the battle?  I think they started attacking each other, but who attacked who?  Did Littlefinger have something to do with it (he was going to talk to the Tyrells at Highgarden.... right?)?

1. 
When Davos brought Lady Melisandre to Storms End and she gave birth to the shadow demon, he said he knew whose face the demon had, or who had impregnated her, or something...  Well who was it?  Stannis?

1. 
Why didnt Arya trust Roose Bolton and tell him she was a Stark?

So I bought a graphics tablet with my first paycheck, and I sketched this picture of [aFFC](/b ""Arya Stark in Braavos selling clams"").

This is a sketch of exactly how I imagined the scene when I read it in aFFC. It is NOT a sketch of Maisie Williams. Im pretty impressed with the casting for the TV series, but I think its really important to remember the character that you created in your head from GRRM's text, rather than the actor or actress. 

[Art talk] I really dont have much formal artistic training, as I am an engineering student, so Im still working out a lot of the kinks of drawing digitally. You'll notice that there are lots of really messy straight lines, or lines that arent straight. Also, if you follow the lines from the buildings and the ground, you'll notice that the perspective is not exactly correct. Also, I am an idiot with layers, and absolutely retarded with color. I hope to do more of these if I have time, and iron out these imperfections. I have a great picture of [aFFC](/b ""Lord Commander"") Jon Snow overlooking the nights watch in my head, as well as some characters that havent been cast.

I mean, really GRRM?  7 years for this?

I wasn't left satisfied with a single major storyline.  A hundred doors were left wide open and so many things were left unresolved from AFFC that I can't help but wonder if GRRM rushed THIS book, even after 7 years.   As I started to get toward the end I was hoping that the climax would be awesome as it usually is... but seeing Varys come back, as neat as that was, did little to settle my disappointment at the ending with Daenarys.  Really?  Standing around with your dragon with a khalasar seemingly bowed in terror... isn't that EXACTLY how the first book ended?  Going all this way just to wind up where you were?  I understand the ""go back to go forward"" concept but this seemed ham fisted and unnecessary.  A story needs to progress forward and for some of the characters, they seemed stuck in traction.


So much of what is significant happens behind the scenes and isn't described, the dragons are hardly seen, and the climax seems to come premature (pun intended) and the ending was sorely disappointing.  I know it sets up for the next book, but really for the last 2 books I'm starting to wonder if it will get better in the next.

[Spoilers!],https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/kvey3/no_true_knight_honor_in_the_asoiaf_universe/,dayoza,1317313650,"Background:  I read the first 4 books about 4 years ago.  I'm now re-reading them, in preparation for Dance of Dragons.  Halfway through Storm of Swords, and a couple of questions keep nagging me.

Is the honor culture of Westeros a reflection of some real ideal that existed in Medieval Europe?  Does the characters' moral reasoning reflect the way many ancient Europeans thought about ethics? Two examples come to mind:

First, Ned Stark's concept of honor.  Honestly, Ned Stark might as well be a more bad-ass Ned Flanders.  He is a sickening goody-goody.  All of his decisions are based on what he thinks he ought to do, for the sake of his honor, his reputation and his family.  For this reason, he is racked with guilt about his bastard, Jon Snow, even though he does the most honorable thing by taking the boy into his house and caring for him.  Why can't he forgive himself for a temporary mistake he made early in his life?  Ned basically commits suicide at the beginning of the first book because he trusts littlefinger (a man portrayed as having no honor), and tries to do the honorable thing to restore the rightful leader to the throne.  Can't he use moral reasoning to see that using deception might be morally acceptable, in order to get a better outcome for the realm?  As he says to Robb (or Bran? I can't remember which), A lord's duty is to protect his smallfolk.  Yet, the consequences of his foolish, honor-seeking actions are to plunge all of Westeros into a bloody war.

Second, contrast Ned's rigid, unbending sense of Honor with Sandor Clegane's different moral stance.  He refuses to to become a knight because he sees the vows and what they represent as being all lies.  To him, all battles ultimately result in raping, pillaging and killing innocents.  So in his mind, he is morally justified in never taking the vows and rather doing the dirty work he was born for: to fight and kill.  He thinks that in battle it is folly to pretend to be a defender of some abstract symbol of morality.  True, he has been treated much worse in life than Ned has, yet, I see merit in his morality as well.  He honestly does not want to hurt Sansa and Arya when he has contact with them.  He seems to know how evil Cersi and Joffry are.  He simply lives and lets live when he can, and kills when he needs to.  However, he is also a consistent old-testament style prophet in the books.  He point out to everyone; kings children and outlaws, that the vows of knighthood are all based on lies. In his eyes when it comes to battle, no one is honorable. 

Who is right, Sandor or Ned?  ",25,18,False,self,,,,,

But I just can't figure out why. I don't know what benefit getting Jon away from the Wall would have other than Jon being the only other person known to be alive in the world who could identify the fake Arya and discredit Ramsay's claim on Winterfell.

I'm convinced that Jon's not dead.  Another one of GRRM's teases that don't come to fruition.  He either survived the attack or - and this is the speculation - that's when changed his skin and merged into Ghost.  His last word was ""Ghost"" and as it is known, Jon has a bit of Warg in him that Melisandre confirms.  I thought this was a longshot theory at first, or at least as likely as any other, but then I was thinking about how Varamyr Sixskin's prologue had ANYTHING to do with the rest of the story, since in previous books the prologue turned out to have huge foreshadowing.  This is the only thing I can link it to - that Jon just lost one of his 'lives' and now will live in Ghost's body, just as Sixskins had done when he lost his own first life as a boy.

1012,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2011-9-30,2011,9,30,21,kwdpz,self.gameofthrones,It's 7 AM on a weekday and I have just finished reading A Storm of Swords... [spoilers],https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/kwdpz/its_7_am_on_a_weekday_and_i_have_just_finished/,w00tingspree,1317384475,"I started *A Storm of Swords* in the middle of Hurricane Irene. The power was out and I was reading by candlelight, having just finished *A Clash of Kings* (the naval battle in Blackwater Bay was especially fun to read amidst pounding rain and howling wind). I had to put the book down when the semester started but I picked it up again two days ago to finish reading.

I'm not going to comment much on my reaction to the Red Wedding, since it's been posted about many times here, although I must say I could not put the book down after that scene. But the ride just kept going and going, with some of the most fast-paced and moving scenes ever... Jon Snow's defense of the Wall and reunion with Ygritte, Stannis's call to defend the realm, Joffrey's wedding feast, Arya and the Hound, the Lannister family argument...

... and Sansa playing in the snow. That was one of the most powerful scenes in the book for me. In *A Game of Thrones* all Sansa and Arya did was argue, but Sansa remembering Winterfell and her snowball fight with Arya was one of the most heartbreaking things in the series. George R. R. Martin makes some pretty powerful character arcs in his universe. And he does a really good job showing both the conflict on a large scale and the personal conflicts that affect every individual character.

I feel that between Books 1 through 3 George R. R. Martin set up a huge number of different story and character arcs... and they all came together in a resounding clash in the last half of *A Storm of Swords*. And at the same times he is setting up even more storylines... Daenerys's army grows bigger, Stannis prepares for an invasion in the North, Arya heads off to Braavos, Bran unlocks his powers, and House Lannister is left in chaos. All the while Petyr Baelish draws closer to his motives, whatever they may be. What started as a murder mystery has now blown up into a conflict of cosmic proportions. And what's most exciting is knowing that there is no clear cut ""hero"" who will inevitably ""win"" in the end... only that winter is coming, a Lannister always pays his debts, the night dark and full of terrors, and *valar morghulis*.

... oh and zombie Catelyn. HOLY SHIT. I've always heard about how George R. R. Martin likes to kill off characters, but bringing them back? I thought Lord Beric was just some freak, but magic in *A Song of Ice and Fire* is potent and game-changing (when it is not a mummer's farce).

So that's my reaction. Favorite book in the series so far. I really enjoyed *A Game of Thrones* and thought it was an amazing book stand-alone, thought A Clash of Kings was brilliant and satisfying, but this book really ties a lot of story arcs together - like Joffrey's reign (and Tywin's reign), Robb's reign, the epic ranging (and Mance Rayder's reign) - in a very satisfying way.

I wish I discovered this series earlier...

Oh, and why do *A Feast for Crows* and *A Dance with Dragons* have only 3 stars each on Amazon? I'd read the reviews but I don't want any spoilers...",29,36,False,self,,,,,

A complex story with grey characters who evolve and change isn't for you.

May I direct you towards Harry Potter? You might feel more comfortable there. There aren't POV chapters for unimportant characters. And each book has a clear beginning and end. Plus the series is already ended!! You won't have to wait for a a few years for it.
