Especially the first two seasons were almost crippled by lack of proper budget, and while many good things came of out of it (lots of nice, small off-the-book conversations, etc.), I also thought: ""They have all the money now. People would probably pay if they could touch up some old scenes"". 
So no re-shoots (contract reasons), all the work must be done by CGI-studios. 

What if we could see Storm's End briefly before the parlay between Baratheon brothers? Or massive Dothraki hordes and Vaes Dothrak that doesn't look like a village? Qarth that's more than fancy aisles and gardens? More direwolves! Maybe a few brief snippets or shots of battles at Green Fork and Whispering Woods? 

And most of all, what if Battle of Blackwater would better hold up against modern standards? We could see the water burning green at the background, more ships getting destroyed by the explosion, add more men to the fights, some shots of catapults raining fire on Stannis' ships from the walls, and more things they could not do due to budget limitations. All to add the sense of scale the battle now mostly lacks. 

And maybe add some of the deleted scenes back in the show. Although there probably are reasons why they cut those in the first place, I cannot fathom why they didn't show Loras crying after Renly. ""Pacing reasons"" I suppose. 

What do you think? Are the earlier seasons a holy grail they should not touch? Do we open a Pandora's box of bad ideas if they should do it? Would you buy it? ",7,6,False,self,,,,,

What if Bran sacrifices his life to heal the North and become sort of ""one with the world""?

Children inherit 50% of their genes from their biological father and mother. So what's this go to do with Craster?

If we assume Craster began his reclusive community with but one woman (it doesn't matter how many really), but lets say it's one to keep things simple. When he and this woman produce their first child, it will have 50% of Craster's genes (and any children produced with woman 1 will have 50% of his genes).

When Craster then produces another child/children with his 1st generation of daughters, he will have a second generation that will receive 50% of their genes from Craster and 50% from their mother, but their mother _also_ has 50% Craster genes and 50% of woman 1's. Thus 2nd generation daughters will get 50% Crastor genes (directly from Craster himself) and 25% Craster genes from her mother. (The other 25% are genes from woman 1).

As this process continues, more and more of Craster's genes are 'pushing' out any residue of woman 1's. Each successive generation gets the previous generations woman 1's genes halved. We should approach 100% of Craster's genes after n number of generations.

This can be described using the following formula:

x = 1 - 2 * (0.5)^(n+1)

Where x is the percentage (as decimal) of Craster's genes in the individual.
n is the generation (e.g. the 1st child would be n = 1, the 2nd generation n =2 and so on)

""Ah ha!"" one might say, this formula will never reach x = 1 (ie Craster's genes are 100%) even after infinite generations. And no it will not, but as there are only ~20 000 genes in humans, should we achieve a mere 0.9999999 then there is only a 1/100 chance that the offspring has one single gene that is not Craster's. We could be sure that the offspring is 100% genetically Craster - A CRASTER CLONE!

so if x = 0.9999999, n is ~24 (after rounding up)

That means it will take 24 generations until we have a CLONE CRASTER.

Let's assume that we're in Medieval times and Craster's daughters will produce a child at 15, so it takes 15 years before the next generation can be produced.

Thus 24 * 15 = number of years until we have a CLONE CRASTER = 360 years!

If Craster uses some Old God magic, and lives for several hundred years, he could clone himself without modern science!

*disclaimer - this doesn't account for mitchondrial DNA which is inherited entirely from the mother, Craster's Clone would have all of Craster's genes, except for his mitochondria which control metabolism etc. 

TL;DR If Craster takes his vitamins, he could achieve human cloning.

Edit: Crastor -&gt; Craster

Thoros of Myr, Beric Dondarrion, and Melisandre (who I'm just guessing will end up with this bunch, Lord of Fire and all) might be the first she encounter, but she's heading to King's Landing.

Cersei Lannister had a direct hand in Ned's death, there's no way Arya has given up on killing her. But the prophecy says that the ""valonqar"" will kill Cersei, so we know it can't be Arya. Now I have heard the theory about Arya wearing Jaime's face to kill Cersei, but I don't think this is how it will play out. Instead, I believe that Jaime will kill Cersei because he is **defending** Arya while she fights the Mountain. We don't really know how Zombie Mountain operates, but I imagine he'd act like a ~~Hound~~ dog and rush to protect his owner when she is in danger. This maneuver would give Arya the chance to strike a deadly hit, killing the Mountain.

So why would Jaime do this? Jaime did not seem pleased with Cersei at the end of the season, and I feel this divide will only grow stronger. Jaime's character has grown incredibly, and after his encounter with Brienne, I think he may be more incline to remember the oath he made to Catelyn about keeping her daughters safe. All of his own children have now died, and their mother unconsciously caused the death of his last son. Killing Cersei by protecting Arya would redeem Jaime, and I hope we do get to see more honorable acts from him.

Also, with Cersei gone, it would be easier for Jaime and Tyrion to call a truce and Daenerys could take over King's Landing more easily. All of which would have her heading North with her dragons even sooner.

And I mean, it would be awesome to see lil Assassin Arya take out Zombie Mountain.",10,5,False,self,,,,,

Here's mine

1. Petyr ""Littlefinger"" Baelish - He's still alive and he's done so much work to get him where he is right now. He now has an army, wealth, and lands. He's the one who created the war in the first place. It's not even an incident like Lyanna's abduction but it was deliberately planned.

2. Tyrion ""Imp"" Lannister -  He's escaped from death a few times already. Vardis paid for his the first time while Oberyn, Tywin, and Shae were offered to the gods the second time. Not to mention his whole journey to pretty much everywhere. He's an awesome Hand for both Joffrey and Daenerys and I don't think he made any terrible move yet.

3. Daenerys ""Mother of Dragons, bla bla bla"" Targaryen - She started as the girl whose last name is Targaryen. But then, she survived all odds and become the strongest player in the game right now. She's the powerhouse. House (team) to beat. She'll most likely get the crown. Her dragons have a big part of her game though.

4. Varys the Spider - Like Tyrion, he's a bastard in a different kind of way. He's deprived from lots of things because of him being a eunuch. His strength though comes from that same disadvantage he have. He knows how things go in the kingdom and he plays his cards right up until now. He didn't have much impact compared to Littlefinger today but he certainly know how not to lose in this game.

5. Tywin Lannister - The only dead character from the list. If not for that cheap move by Tyrion, he could still be the most powerful man in Westeros today. He has lots of experience in both the battlefield and the political side of the game. Didn't lose any fight. His house is the richest and most powerful one in Westeros. I don't think anybody can top that.

I was watching another theory on bran warging into a Wight Hodor and I had a thought, what if bran becomes the third head of the dragons as a way to defeat the night king.


Blood raven tells him he will not walk again, but he will fly.


What if danny rides into battle against the night kings army and one of dannys dragons gets captured or killed, the night king changes/raises it as his new mount (undead or ice), and after a hasty retreat by danny, a second battle and a certain amount of death takes place bran makes a last ditch effort to save his family and he manages to warg into the ice/dead dragon and bend it's will to his own, turning it against the night king himself but potentially risking his own life in the process due to using too much of his stregnth.


And if defeating the final Wight walkers breaks the undead link, the dragon and benjen would both be lost.

Of course, Jon and Arya, Lannisters reunion could be good, Hound and Starks sisters, Sansa and Tyrion and so on. But I'd like to see this one. 

They never had a scene in the books unlike the show. In the show, Jaime tried to warn Jon at the courtyard of Winterfell from entering the Night's Watch. He had at one point probably same illusions abourt Kingsguard, as Jon had about Night's Watch. Becoming a hero, knight in this well respected order of knights. Realizing thy're past their glory days, how it sucks to be there and it's not worthy to give up life for it. As he said to *""It's only for life""* in a very sarcastic tone.

Since now both of them got out of their respective orders via death or simply being relieved by the King. Given how Jaime laments in the books about failing to protect Rhaegar's kids - guess who is Rhaegar's son, journeys they underwent since the beginning and also how Jon basically represents Ned - the way he looks, behaves, moral code. We know how much Ned hated Jaime and Jaime was bothered by the way Ned judged, when he had no idea about it and what went before he enterd throne room. 

It would be fascinating to see them meet again and reflect on their journeys. I could see Jaime even being someone who will protect Jon as Rhaegar's son by fullilling his vow to protect Rhaegar's kids, in this case his son and Starks. Brienne is doing it right now as Sansa's sworn sword with Oathkeeper and Widow's Wail - the other part of re-forged ancestrial sword of House Stark ""Ice"" is in possession of Lannisters. Jaime can put it to use and might be important for the war against white walkers. How cool it would be Oathkeeper and Widow's Wail (both part of the Ice) back in the North, protecting Starks.

I used to say the same things myself however, under the foolish belief Winds of Winter would be released soon I started a reread of the series. 

Honestly, I'm struggling to see Cersei as mad. I think the show may have blurred my vision. My current chapter is her walk of atonement near the end of A Dance of Dragons. I'm yet to read anything I interpret as insane or unreasonable. Given her circumstances every quote, thought or action seems relatively sane.

The only exception I find is her belief that she would make a better man than her father or brothers. But I attribute this to naivety in what it is to lead or to rule. 

Am I missing something? Can anybody point me to a chapter that made them think 'yep, she's lost it'? 

I'm talking strictly books here. I thin the show has allowed us to see that Cersei is not all there. So far in the books though I'm struggling not to feel begrudgingly sympathetic.

I consider myself to be pretty emotionally cold. Don't really know why, I just always have been. Maybe a product of my environment? Probably. After I saw the Red Wedding, I felt bad for Robb and his wife and mother. But that was it. No crying, no not being able to sleep, no disbelief. I somehow managed to avoid all spoilers and didn't know what was gonna happen until Rains of Castamere started playing. 

  When Ned Stark died, it was the same thing. Just a ""Oh. That's too bad for his daughters."" Then it was done. 

  After Jon's murder I figured they'd bring him back to life.  I just had a hunch. 

  Up until last night the only death that I was even somewhat sad for was The Hound's. I just loved his storyline/arc and his arc with Arya. He's one of my favorite characters.

  But last night I decided to binge, and got all the way to Season 6 Ep. 5 ""The Door""....

  Seeing Brann watch Hodor have a seizure and realize why he can only say ""Hodor"" was enough to surprise and shock me. Then after I realized what was gonna happen my eyes got a little misty. I figured it was allergies. But seeing the Wights plunge their daggers and axes into Hodor, and seeing that Hodor was doing it out of his own free will was too much for me. I realized that he knew this was gonna happen since he was a boy. 

  When the credits began to roll I realized my face was damp. I had actually cried. I finally felt sadness and disbelief.
 
  Goddamn you GoT for making me feel stuff.

My theory revolves around the religions on the show, mainly the Faith of the Seven. This theory relies heavily on other theories about Bran being somewhat of an immortal in that he may have been Brandon the Builder and many other Brans throughout history.


My theory, in short, is that the Seven Gods, while they may have existed in the past, are also a prophecy, and that the battle between the living and dead will be won with the Seven Gods fighting on the side of the living. This means that the world of Game of Thrones is possibly a repeating history, or that Bran wrote these stories down knowing that they would be necessary to win the war.


The Seven Gods:

Father (Jon Snow) - represents justice

Mother (Daenerys Targaryen - mother of dragons) - represents motherhood and mercy

Warrior (Jaime Lannister) - represents strength in battle; is pictured carrying a sword (This could also be Brienne of Tarth if Jaime proves to be Azor Ahai. She does already have a significant sword)

Maiden (Sansa Stark) - represents innocence

Smith (Bran Stark) - represents crafts and labor (builder)

Crone (Tyrion Lannister) - represents wisdom

Stranger (Arya Stark) - representing death and the unknown


These characters are all likely to come together in Season 7 of the show and the Winds of Winter. There may also be overlap between these gods and others throughout the Game of Thrones world. The Many Faced God is likely the House of Black and White's interpretation of the Stranger, which means Arya was just finding her way within a religion worshiping her all along.

What the entire series may be, more than anything else, is a renewed war between the Old Gods, worshiped by the Children of the Forest and possibly the Others (White Walkers) and the New Gods worshiped by the Andals. Perhaps the Drowned God (Euron Greyjoy) will play a role in this war. Thoughts?",10,29,False,self,,,,,

Or something close to it. I love himym series but the ending caused a lot of hate among the viewers. I thought it was well written and it would be a cool twist to the show's ending if we see this happening.

The thing about GoT now is the things we expect to happen will finally happen. Dany finally invading Westeros (and then fighting WWs), Cersei's short term plans are about to backfire, WW threat, Winter has come, etc. The visions and prophecies from the previous episodes don't help hiding the future of the show.

So what if the show end up to be a game of Chess between Varys and Littlefinger after all? With all the characters being the Chess piece? I've seen that analogy for years and it's not really far fetched. The two have a lot in common but at the same time differ from many aspects. 

Right now, both showed some sort of weakness from their games. For Varys, it's Kinvara's revelation and his little birds becoming Qyburn's. It is stated time and again that Varys trusts his little birds 100% and with Qyburn getting some of his loyal little birds out of him, his one true weapon somehow is weakened. For Littlefinger, it's his lust with Sansa and recent miscalculations (particularly with the Boltons).

Nevertheless, both looks great with their respective alliances and with massive chaos about to happen, I can't help but think that these two will continue to play the game harder than before. Not to mention the lives of the kings/queens are in danger.

ps. for now, Littlefinger is shown more as a villain and Varys as a hero. Don't you find it weird? We know Littlefinger's plan all along but we don't know Varys'. ",11,7,False,self,,,,,

Dany and Jon will be on opposing sides in the upcoming war
The nights king will kill and raise one of danys 3 dragons for himself
Bran will warg one dragon for Jon to claim
Dany will be left with one dragon
All 3 sides of the war will have one of the dragons

1) Shireen sacrificed to the ""lord of light""...i'm able to set apart reality from fictions very well, but personally this moment left me speechless, i had to get out of my chair, get some water on my face, think about what just happened, and then unpause to continue watching...i think i found it the most horrific because i am a non-believer myself and i find religious offerings to be one of the worst things that humans ever came up with...apart from that, i mistrusted Melisandre from the first episode we saw her, i always felt she was evil...also, there's the obvious fact that she was an innocent little girl who has done nothing to no one, yet suffered so much (locked in tower, ""stone"" face, neglected by parents) to deserve such a tragic ending...without a doubt, most mentally disturbing character death to me.

2) Hodor sacrificing himself to save Bran...okay, i must say, when he was first introduced, i never thought i would care much for a character like Hodor...it's sort of that feeling you get when you feel guilt for ignoring a disabled person, but you push it out of your mind because you know can't do anything about their disability...be as it may, i still didn't expect him to die and felt sad when i realized that those are gonna be his final moments, especially knowing that he's dying scared and alone to save someone else...of course the moment it actually became an even bigger shock is after the reveal of how he actually became the person he was...hold the door, hold the door...

3) Oberyn dying on the edge of victory...personally i feel like Oberyn is that sort of supportive character that just takes over the few episodes he's in, and you just wish he gets his happy/neutral ending and goes back to his regular life ""before the show""...when he first told Tyrion he was gonna be his champion for the trial by combat, i thought ""wow, okay, this guy is insane, gotta respect that""...fast forward to the actual battle, you actually root for him by default because you want Tyrion to win, but you still have doubt that such a small man can beat that ""thing""...when the actual fight begins, you can't help but be impressed by Oberyns overall combat skill, but you're still not convinced...at this point i just want to add that the first time i was watching this episode, i was on my computer super late at night and with headphones, so i fully embraced the moment and my eyes were wide open through the whole fight...and then it happens, ""you raped her, you murdered her...you killed her children!!!"" *spear into chest*...i was sitting in shock thinking ""is this actually possible?"" only to have my dreams crushed just a few moments later...

Honorable mention:
If this character had more of a backstory, he's easily be in the top: 
Ser Rodrik beheaded by Theon Gayboy...the whole buildup of Theon taking Winterfell, to Rodrik refusing to bow down to him, to Theons multiple attempts to actually make the killing blow, makes his deaths one of the worst and most graphic of all...it's the moment that all respect for Gayboy (exactly the moment i started calling him that) went out the window and never came back again...i still hate him after everything he's been through just for causing this poor mans death...

Nymeria (with her wolf army) reunites with Arya, and they roam the Riverlands together.

Sansa and Tyrion reunite, realise they had it good (esp Sansa) and get it going again. Sansa ends up with the opposite of the princes she used to dream of, Tyrion ends up with the ideal of purity from the series in opposition to his whore lovers.

280,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2016-12-5,2016,12,5,7,5gi8qt,self.gameofthrones,[EVERYTHING] Game of Thrones Bran/Dragon Theory,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/5gi8qt/everything_game_of_thrones_brandragon_theory/,seanjohnseanjohn,1480891432,"I recently thought of an interesting theory involving Bran and the dragons in Game of Thrones. We all know that Bran is a warg and has the ability to control other life forms. I think that Bran is warging into the Dragons and controlling them, possibly unknowingly in his sleep/dreams. First of all, in season 4 episode 10, The Three Eyed Raven tells Bran, ""You will never walk again, but you will fly."" He says this to Bran before any of the events that I mention below occur. In season 5 episode 9, Daenarys is in danger and about to be killed by the Sons of the Harpy, when her dragon, Drogon, suddenly appears out of nowhere at just in time to save her. Then after saving Daenerys, Drogon drops her off at a location where she is found by a Dothraki Horde. Eventually she gains control of the Darthraki Horde and they become a part of her army. Drogon, under Brans control, dropped her there on purpose so that she could gain control of the Dothraki horde, greatly enlarging her army. Furthermore, in season 6 episode 9, Drogon reappears right at the climax of the battle of the Siege of Meereen, appearing right when he is needed the most, at the perfect moment in time. He proceeds to turn the tide of the battle in favor of Daenarys and her forces. Without him, victory would have been imposible. It is very unlikely that Drogon would have shown up at the perfect time, in situations that would have spelled death/defeat for Daenarys without him, right when he is needed the most, twice without some outside factor or influence. Additionally in season 4 episode 10 and season 6 episode 6, Bran has visions induced by the three eyed raven, and a weirwood tree. In both of these visions there is an image of a dragon flying over a city with it shadow visible below. What if this frame isn't just a vision, but in fact a flashback or flash forward to a time where Bran has warged into one of the Dragons, the image being in first person from the the perspective of the dragon controlled by Bran. Another piece of evidence that I found was in season 3 episode 2. At one point in this episode Bran is talking to Jojen Reed about his warg powers and says, ""It's not just wolves, sometimes in my dreams I..."" , but then gets cut off and interrupted by Jojen, before he can finish his sentence. If it is not only wolves that he has been warging into, could he also be warging into dragons, as well as the Three Eyed Raven and Wolves in his dreams? So far I have not seen any evidence in the show that suggests that he was controlling the three eyed raven, he only sees it in his dreams. So maybe he was about to say dragons. If this theory were true, then there would have to be reasoning behind why Bran is helping Daenarys. For some unknown reason, Bran is supporting Daenarys and ensuring her survival, helping her get to Westeros. An idea I had about the reasoning behind Bran warging into the Dragon is that he is trying to get Daenarys and her dragons to Westeros, because they are needed to stop the White Walkers and their unread army. After all, fire is paramount in the effort to stop the white walkers from destroying Westeros. And in this case, dragons seem to be the best method of defeating them.",8,6,False,self,,,,,

Anyway, I'm obviously talking about his desire to resurrect Jon Snow. Ever since watching the season 6 premiere, it struck me as a little contrived that Davos Seaworth--a rational man with what was seemingly previously only a mild professional respect for Jon Snow--would want to protect the body of Jon Snow to see whether he could be resurrected. In a sense Davos has always been a good audience surrogate character (he's about as ""normal"" of a person as you get, and he's surrounded by some absolutely nutty things happening), but in this case it seemed to me like he was a bit *too much* of an audience surrogate in wanting Jon to come back. The audience obviously knows Mel is around and can potentially resurrect people like Thoros did, and the audience deeply cares about Jon. But does Davos care? Would he *really* seek out Mel--whom he hates--and ask her to do this? Am I forgetting about some key scenes from season 5?

Theory goes something like this: Rhaegar (for whatever reason) decides he is going to lose the Battle of the Trident so rather than go and die he glamours (using the rubies in his armor) a loyal soldier and has him die in his stead. (much like how Mal uses her glamouring ability and seems to draw power from her ruby choker) Rhaegar then runs and joins Faceless Men and eventually, either intentionally or not, runs in to Arya. As the books say, she looks just like Lyanna and even had her mentality. Rhaegar, now Jaqen, takes her under his wing and gives her the training to defend herself (and hide if necessary) that Lyanna never received as mentioned by Ned in the books. (His silver streak is intended to be a reference to his past life as a Targ) If this theory is true, it would also tie in well with the theory about Jaqen wanting to steal a certain book from the Citadel. 

If this theory is popular and i just missed it, I apologize. However given the new information the show has given us in ""winds of winter"" if this is an old theory maybe its worth revisiting. 

EDIT: so i made a mistake. It wasn't New Rockstars, it was The Last Harpy on youtube. the link to video discussing theory is here 
 https://youtu.be/3ekYxJR461A

EDIT 2: Ive been going back reading through Rhaegars history with this theory in mind. One maybe significant thing is on the day he was born at Summerhall, there was a massive fire there killing King Aegon V and Prince Duncan. May be coincidence but thats a fair amount of kings blood that was ""sacrificed"" to fire. (it is yet unknown what started the fire, so sacrifice may be accurate)  Like I said, Im reading this now through a certain lens so I may be making something from nothing. Just noting similarities and looking for ties to Red Priests ",29,28,False,self,,,,,

so in conclusion, inbreeding produces children with a higher chance of insanity already, and on top of that her father was mentally unstable, leaving her with a natural tendency for insanity AND a genetic one. a double whammy. this, along with her decisions that could be considered borderline unstable, will make her a terrible queen later in life.

But I'm honestly very fascinated by the potential importance of howland reed.

This is a character that has only been teased to us. He is a old northern lord, who runs the swamps of the north. His children have been major in regards to bran's storyline. And as we all know he is the only other person who knows what happened at the tower of joy. 

Since the tower of joy, howland has been hidden at the neck. Even in the books I heard he just sent his teenage children to declare for Robb stark. 

GRRM has said on record he will appear in the future but what I want to know is what's your prediction for howland reed?

Will his story be connected to Jon Snows? Bran Starks? The white walkers? Or maybe he will have his own story like the hound did in S6E7 ""The Broken Man"" but maybe stretched throughout the 6 episodes of S8. 

A recurring theme in this show has been out with the old (Ned, Tywin, Stannis, Robert) and in with the new (Jon, Daenerys, Sansa, arya etc.) and it would be nice for an older character like howland to be a major part of the ending of this show.

I'm placing strong bets that Arya dies this season and I'm going to suggest both a manner and a reason for it then add a bit of outside evidence.

First off, as far as I've been concerned Arya has been ""safe"" for as long as she's been in Bravos. It's for the same reason Dany was safe until she crossed the sea. In both cases their plots would effectively be the world's longest shaggy dog stories if they died before heading back to Westeros. There would have been no narrative pay off. Now though they're both in Westeros and Arya in particular is in a fair amount of danger of ""finishing her arc.""

I think she has a bit further to go, she needs something grander than the murder of a secondary character to really be worth the time invested, but I see her now as basically a one shot pistol. She's not going to galavant around the entirety of the country slaughtering baddies left and right. It would be totally out of character for the story as a whole. But she'll probably get at least one more kill in, or at a minimum an attempt.

So that leaves the question of ""who?"", And my prediction it'll likely be the character with the biggest pay off. By my reckoning that's Jaime. The way I see it there are only a few characters in the ""top tier target list."" The Hound, The Mountain, Cersei, and Jaime. The mountain's death belongs to the hound (hype). She likely wouldn't kill the hound if she had the chance. And the narrative doesn't work for cersei. We need someone in Kings Landing to hate, so I feel like cersei will survive at least until the end of the season when the plot shifts fully north for the finale.

That leaves Jaime, which brings up an interesting possibility for Arya's death... There are basically two people left in Westeros who see Jaime as a potentially good person, Tyrion, and Brienne. Tyrion is busy and rarely an eminent threat to anyone, so what about Brienne?

Well, her whole arc has been about oaths and failing to live up them. What if it happened one more time in the most tragic manner possible?

Prediction: Arya kills Jaime (or tries). Brienne witnesses the event and fails to recognize arya due either to a disguise or never really having seen her in the first place. Brienne avenges Jaime at which point Arya's identity is revealed. Brienne has failed her oath entirely.

Additional evidence: Maisie Williams has been releasing some, shall we say, none too childish photos. If she dies this coming season she'll likely be looking for a new gig, and chances are she's not going to play another child assassin. If her character is scheduled for death then now is the time to prove to the world she an actress and an adult, not a child. Those photos will go a long way towards that.

[SPOILER]
In Battle of the Bastards how did they film the Vale horses crashing into the Bolton barricade? 

I watched a behind the scenes of Battle of the Bastards and one part I'm confused about is when The Bolton's surrounded Jon's forces with that shield barricade, and then The Vale came in to the fight and their horses crashed into the Bolton barricade, how did they film that?

It seems like they would have to film actual horses crashing into people. I'm just curious about that part.
When I look at the barriacade it is moving so it is real people. Maybe they are filmed seperately?

""There will come a day after a long summer when the stars bleed and the cold breath of darkness falls heavy on the world. In this dread hour a warrior shall draw from the fire a burning sword. And that sword shall be Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes, and he who clasps it shall be Azor Ahai come again, and the darkness shall flee before him.""

Now this is not the main person i believe is azor ahai this is just one of the theories i have on him or her and in this theory i say that Arya Stark could Azor Ahai. Now you are probably thinking that is too crazy well remember Azor Ahai does not have to be the person we think it is so it could still work. but anyways let's begin my evidence:

The Red Star Bleeds: The red star bleeding could be from her fathers blood on the sept as he was beheaded it could also be from the red comet in the sky.

Darkness Gathers: darkness gathering could be when she whined blind when you are blind it goes dark.

Darkness shall flee before him/her: Darkness fleeing could be when she got her eyes back.

Cold breath of darkness falls heavy on the world: The cold breath of darkness could be either the threat of the white walkers, Cersei's reign as mad queen, or whatever Littlefinger or Euron have planned.

Born Admits salt and smoke: The salt could be her salty tears from witnessing her father getting beheaded or it could be after she was stabbed by the waif and was thrown into salty Braavosi sea water. i have not made a strong connection to the smoke part of the prophecy yet but when i do i will re-edit this and put it in here.

LightBringer: Needle Obviously

Awakening dragons from stone: i have not made a strong connection to this one either but there is still two books and two season left alot of time to fulfill this part of the prophecy.

Now Azor Ahai was said to have tried to make lightbringer in three ways first in water but failed then in the heart of his captive lion but failed then finally in the heart of his beloved wife nissa nissa. Now the Lion would be Cersei. But the Nissa Nissa is a hard one. It would not be Gendry as Gendry is not her biggest love, Not Jon because he is not her biggest love, Not Ned because he dead from someone else. I think her Nissa Nissa will be her Direwolf Nymeria and she will have to stab the heart of her Direwolf with needle and when she has done this she will have fordged lightbringer and become Azor Ahai reborn the savior of Westeros.

Hey GoT community, I have an idea that builds upon the theory that Bran Stark is also Bran the Builder.
I haven't been able to think of a way that Brans Warging or Greensight abilities will be of any use in an actual battle against the Night King. This put me on a train of thought that maybe, in the current time, and in the future they won't be useful, and Bran doesn't have anything to contribute to the battles to come. Does that mean he is insignificant? No, after all the Three Eyed Raven has told and shown him I don't think so.
Here's what I think Brans contribution will be: Bran will realize the full power and extent to which he can reach into the past using Greensight to make an impression on people and events. He will become Bran the Builder and perhaps even cease to exist in the current time, with the goal of building the Wall, Winterfell, and other magic infused structures to buy time for the future of men so that they may be prepared for the real war against the White Walkers to come.
This may have been stated elsewhere on Reddit already, but I didn't find it.

Littlefinger remains stationed with the Knights of the Vale at Moat Cailin for all of season 6, until Sansa calls upon him. She writes a letter to him in episode 7, and yet he never sends word or even shows up until Sansa goes out of her way to retrieve him. 

Is it possible that Littlefinger was waiting until the battle already began? That he would annihilate the remaining Bolton forces in one swoop? Remember, in season 5 Cersei said she would grant him the title of Warden of the North if he destroyed the traitorous Boltons. 

It makes sense that Littlefinger would not only wait, but intentionally hold out until the likely event that Jon dies in battle. In fact, we almost see him die several times throughout the fight, but as we know, the Lord of Light is protecting Jon.

Anyways, I was thinking about all the shitty things certain characters I love have done and was curious about what you guys think are the more dastardly or heroic character defining actions on GOT (and yes I know this isn't the most original question)

For me I'd say Jaime raping Cersei next to David HassleJoff's corpse kinda made me iffy on him for a bit (and no I don't think that it was consensual even if the writers want me to, if it was consensual they'd use more than just visual cues to display so) but then he kinda redeemed himself for me a bit by saving tyrion, in general Jaime is such a conflicting character for me because of the sheer number of deplorable things he does but certain things about him are really cool like his ""bromance that isn't really a bromance because she's a woman"" with Brienne, and the aforementioned recuse of everyone's favorite imp.

On a more positive note I'd say I really like melisandre as of late, even if her past actions were horrid everything she's done she's done for her religion, and even though I'm an atheist if I saw the things she saw (or gave birth to) I'd most definitely understand her reasoning, but that just being part of it her revival of Jon and the regret she's seemed to be showing towards the wrongs she's committed make her much more unique and interesting to me.",51,35,False,self,,,,,

All of the family members that we see watching Bran are now dead (or have died and come back). It cuts to Arya and Sansa sewing and it shows Arya listening to the other family members outside. The family encourages Bran to stay on target and just as he is about to shoot his 3rd arrow (3rd that we see him shoot anyway) Arya, from the shadows lands the final shot. 

Lets say this is all foreshadowing, how are some ways Arya could help Bran ""make the final shot"" in the war against the White Walkers? Also if you want to go true tinfoil, if Brans target represents Winterfell, he misses to the ""south west"" and ""North"" of the target. Coincidentally the two places Bran the builder built the Citadel and The Wall. Like I said, it just read differently this time around and I wanted to hear your thoughts on it.

We then 'remembered' that we were talking about Game of Thrones. We talked about GRRM saying it will be a bittersweet ending so the big questions we were discussing are as follows. 
Who do you WANT on the Iron Throne?
Who SHOULD be on the Iron Throne?
Who do you think WILL be on the Iron Throne? 

Personally I think...
WANT - Jon Snow - Thinking this might be a common one but he should stay in the North where he belongs. He will make a great Warden of the North, he's wise and a good commander who inspires love and loyalty in his men.
SHOULD - Renly Baratheon -I know he is long dead but I think he would have made a really great king. He was loved by many and a good claim.
I also think Jaime Lannister would make a good king 
This would make a nice full-circle. He was found by Ned sat on the Throne after The Mad King's death and if he climbed those steps now he would make a good king. 
WILL - I've got a bad feeling that Daenerys is going to actually do it. BUT!!! I think she will not last long and she'll die from an illness or injury but not before she has a child. This will open the gates to her giving Tyrion the title of Lord Regent to rule until her son/daughter comes of age. This is the bitter-sweet ending that GRRM talked about. 

I've spoken to others about this and everyone seems to have their own opinions so should be interesting. ",30,1,False,self,,,,,

That being said dothraki are mainly a cavalry force used to riding in open Plains and grass lands. When they arrive it will be the begining of winter in westeros. As mentioned in ""A knight of the seven kingdoms"", the water in Dorne can be scarce in the late summer, not enough to sustain 100k horses and riders. Then we look at high garden for aid right? But as I'm sure they didn't imagine to feed a whole army at the begining of a 10 year long winter so Dany might not be able to gather aid in the name of resources from them. As i mentioned it is the begining of winter and the Dothraki have no winter clothing to speak of. As its been said in the first book by Jorah, all the king would have to do is close the gates and wait for the Dothraki to starve as they have no siege weapons. Now she does have dragons, but at the same time if her army cannot adapt she won't be able attack much of anything. This has always been Russia's natural defence and I'm sure George R.R. Martin will not ignore the troubles of a winter invasion.

The Wildlings were somewhat safe, living at Hardhome, safe in that they hadn't all been massacred by White Walkers until Jon decides to come and try and save them and take them South. If the White Walkers wanted them to join their undead army why didn't they strike before the attack on the wall and when the full force was at Hardhome?

It seems they only chose to invade and kill everyone when Jon was trying to save them, so how did they know?

Again by my count, eight of these heirs died under suspicious or questionable circumstances.  Seven of the eight Targaryen heirs who died suspiciously did so between the years 209 and 232 A.C. In addition, four other Targaryens died in strange fashion during roughly the same time period.  These deaths effectively demolished House Targaryen's chances at continued long-term rule over the Seven Kingdoms, arguably more so than the Dance of Dragons, the Blackfyre Rebellions, or any of the numerous instances of Targaryen misrule.  So, hence my title - who killed House Targaryen? I believe I know, but I want to see what you guys think.

Here are the deaths I've ruled suspicious -

1) Aerion Targaryen, son of Prince Baelor, died stillborn 206 A.C.

2) Baelor Targaryen, son of Prince Baelor, died stillborn 208 A.C.

3) Prince Baelor ""Breakspear"" Targaryen, son of King Daeron II, died in a tourney accident 209 A.C.

4) Prince Valarr Targaryen, son of Prince Baelor, died of the Great Spring Sickness 209 A.C.

5) Prince Matarys Targaryen, son of Prince Baelor, died of the Great Spring Sickness 209 A.C.

6) King Daeron II Targaryen, died of the Great Spring Sickness 209 A.C.

7) Prince Rhaegel Targaryen, son of King Daeron II, died of choking on his food 215 A.C.

8) Prince Aelor Targaryen, son of Prince Rhaegel, died in an accident 217 A.C.

9) Princess Aelora Targaryen, daughter of Prince Rhaegel and wife to Prince Aelor, believed to have killed herself 219 A.C.

10) Prince Daeron Targaryen, son of King Maekar I, died of a sexually-transmitted disease 229 A.C.

11) Prince Aerion Targaryen, son of King Maekar I, killed himself by drinking wildfyre 232 A.C.

Deaths 1 and 2 are suspicious because of the babies' direct proximity to the line of succession, and given that stillbirths had not yet become common to House Targaryen at the time.  Also, stillbirths can be influenced by sorcery as seen with Mirri Maz Dur and the unborn Rhaego Targaryen.  

Death 3 is suspicious because Prince Baelor was a trained warrior and veteran of numerous battles against the Blackfyre rebels - it seems doubtful that he would allow himself to be killed during a simple tournament melee.  Furthermore, the killing blow was dealt by his own brother, Prince Maekar, which is odd given that the two had an excellent relationship by most accounts.  Prince, and later King, Maekar was overwhelmed with remorse for the rest of his life over the ""accidental"" kinslaying, but consider that sorcery could easily force a mace to swing just a little too hard.  

We'll skip deaths 4, 5, and 6 for now and instead focus on death 7.  Prince Rhaegel was undeniably a lunatic, but it seems unlikely that he would suddenly lose the wherewithal to chew and swallow - unless sorcery were involved.  

Death 8 is suspicious because Prince Aelor is supposed to have died at the hands of his beloved sister-wife Princess Aelora - however, details of the accident are not available.  

Aelora herself was subsequently assaulted and (one supposes) systematically gaslighted by three men known as the Rat, the Hawk, and the Pig until she killed herself in death 9.  This is odd behaviour for three random men to engage in  unless they had been hired by some outside force - and this seems likely given their later rebellion against the Iron Throne in 251 A.C.  

Death 10 seems fairly straightforward until one realizes that Prince Daeron only turned to copious quantities of alcohol and prostitutes to cope with vicious and unending ""dragon dreams"".  Such dreams are not unknown to the Targaryen family, but were certainly capable of being intensified by sorcery until the profligate Daeron boozed and sexed himself to death.  

It's a similar story with Prince Aerion in death 11.  Aerion ""Brightflame"" was a complete lunatic and a monstrous individual, but he had never exhibited the sort of erratic behaviour that would suggest his desire to personally transform into a dragon via consumption of wildfyre.  That is, he probably would not have done so unless the idea were planted in his head via sorcery.  

Finally, we have deaths 4, 5, and 6, all coming at the hands of the Great Spring Sickness - a sickness which appeared suddenly, took the lives of two heirs to the Iron Throne before taking the King as well, and then disappeared just as suddenly.  Nobody knows from where this sickness came, except that it was possibly brought on by - you guessed it! Sorcery.  When did the Great Spring Sickness strike? 209 A.C., the same year that the Hand of the King Prince Baelor Breakspear was killed in a freakish tourney accident.  Who ascended to the post of Hand of the King to replace Prince Baelor? Brynden Rivers, the Bloodraven, and a known student of sorcery.  Who, as Hand, came up with the sweeping and effective measures which were implemented to curtail the Great Spring Sickness as suddenly as it had come?  The Bloodraven.    ",22,12,False,self,,,,,

What if all the characters are analogies for animals and the story is an analogy for the food chain.

Animals as much as we love them, are vicious and brutal in the wild. Pack animals almost always end up on top (wolves and lions)

And the White Walkers/Others are really people or simply **us**. We come in and destroy. We'll tame animals (wights) and use them for means other than their natural purpose.

House Baratheon began as a Targaeryen offshoot, and there was a pretty recent intermarriage. But Cersei has no royal blood, so who the hell is supporting her claim? Obviously this will be a big plot point of the upcoming season, but she still had to secure power somehow. 

Furthermore, who the hell would the crown fall too? Are there any living Baratheons? If a council was called, would the throne revert back to Daenaerys? Some offshoot of the Baratheon family?

Factors as to why their disappointing include; badly executed death scene, lack of propose to the story and the fact that they had so much potential to the story.~They also needed to have died in Season 6

Here's my list

5. Kevan Lannister: Kevan was mostly the main power in Kings Landing in Season 6, and never really did anything of importance at all other than get in Cersei's way. His death scene wasn't even shown in the finale, whereas in the books his death held some importance.

4. Doran Martell: Doran had a lot of potential to the storyline in Season 6, unfortunately the show runners didn't use the book material and ultimately ruined the Dorne storyline as a whole 

3. The Blackfish: The Blackfish vs. The Freys was built up for over 3 episodes and it ultimately ended anti-climatically. He really didn't serve much purpose other than as a plot device to get Jaime outta Kinds Landing. We also didn't even see his death scene  

2. Roose Bolton: For nearly 4 Seasons Roose has been built up as an intelligent person who would never leave himself unguarded or outplayed, unfortunately both happen to him. He also died pretty pathetically that didn't help 

1. The Three Eyed Crow: The main reason why he's #1 is because we don't know anything about him. In the books we know his name, why he's there and his backstory. In the show he's some 1000 year old hobo who never really taught Bran anything, we still don't know how Bran is going to help in the War for the Dawn. At least he had a unique death though",19,11,False,self,,,,,

But the 2012 game sucks and the telltale game is not really an RPG so my idea was to have a game of thrones RPG set in Westeros. You start the game as a farmer in the Riverlands and when you return from a walk with your son and Daughter your house, barn, animals, and family are destroyed by a group of bandits in this moment you have a choice in this moment as you are cornered you either choose to have the son and Daughter sacrifice themselves to save the father, the father and daughter sacrifice themselves to save the son, Or have the Son and Father Sacrifice themselves to save there Daughter. 

Which ever one you choose you are left to Mourn over your families death. Cut to several years later you are a mercenary in Essos and you are captured by slave traders and taken to Astapor where of course Daenerys frees them with her dragons and you escape with some new friends you made these include a Slave, Two Night's Watch Deserters who was also captured, A Mercenary from Myr who was also captured, and a Fugitive from Highgarden who left to Slaver's Bay to try and start a new life. You leave with them to the Crownlands where you find out that the Bandits that killed his/her family are on the loose still and so you write there names on a list and the game is baseically you must find and kill each of the bandits that did you wrong but it is not easy. For starters in the game there is a Morality system i call Protector or Killer (atleast until i come up with a better name) in this you either are a Protector and do not kill citizens, Only kill Enemies and if they are wounded on the ground you spare there lives, you are a good person to all, and you help save lives. 

When you are a killer you kill anyone in your path, do not spare the wounded, be a bad person to everyone you meet, and try and destroy the lives you should save it also plays into the story as you choose to either kill the Bandit members you go after or you take care of them in a different way. Also the map is huge the places you can go to are the North, The Neck, The Vale, The Westerlands, The Riverlands, The Crownlands, The Iron Islands, Dragonstone, And Slaver's Bay. With The Wall, Beyond the Wall, Dorne, The Reach, Storm lands, and Braavos coming in later as DLC. Also you can choose to join a house and fight for it these include House Stark, House Baratheon, House Lannister, House Arryn, House Tully, House Tyrell, House Greyjoy, and House Targaryen. 

And Multiplayer is two things Co-op for the main game story and online multiplayer where you and other players fight in battles the modes are Conquest (capturing all the camps in the map), Capture the flag, Wildfire (take a Barrel of Wildfire to the enemy camp), Siege (siege the enemy castle and if you are on the other side defend it), Team Deathmatch, Arena (fight in the Arena against other Opponents these include of 1 on 1, 2 on 2, and Deathmatch), Leader Team Deathmatch (same thing except one of the other players plays as a character from the show), White Walker (you and your allies have to kill the White Walker (think Juggernaut mode but with a white walker), and Ice vs Fire (three players play as three characters from the show and three players from the other side also play as three characters from the show as you lead other regular players to victory). Oh yeah and the game is open world.     ",33,4,False,self,,,,,

Arya was chasing Blarion the Black cat and she gets lost and finds the hidden room below the Red Keep filled with dead dragons. 

**ARYA STARKS NIGHTMARE ABOUT KINGS LANDING**

&gt;When they had first come to Kings Landing, she used to have bad dreams about getting lost in the castle. Father said the Red Keep was smaller than Winterfell, but in her dreams it had been immense, **an endless stone maze with walls that seemed to shift and change behind her.** She would find herself **wandering down gloomy halls** past faded tapestries, descending **endless circular stairs,** darting through courtyards or over bridges, **her shouts echoing unanswered.** In some of the rooms the red stone walls would seem to drip blood, and nowhere could she find a window. **Sometimes she would hear her fathers voice**, but always from a long way off, and no matter how hard she ran after it, it would grow fainter and fainter, until it faded to nothing and **Arya was alone in the dark**.

&gt;It was very dark right now, she realized. She hugged her bare knees tight against her chest and shivered. She would wait quietly and count to ten thousand. **By then it would be safe for her to come creeping back out and find her way home.** - Arya Stark, AGoT

~*~

Jon has this bad dream about Winterfell that has him feeling lost and unwanted. He is not really alone in the castle though. The King's of Winter are down in the crypts where Jon is being lured. He is afraid. 

**JON SNOWS NIGHTMARE ABOUT WINTERFELL**

&gt;Sometimes I dream about it, he said. 

&gt;Im walking down this **long empty hall. My voice echoes all around**, but no one answers, so I walk faster, opening doors, shouting names. I dont even know who Im looking for. **Most nights its my father, but sometimes its Robb instead, or my little sister Arya, or my uncle.**

&gt;[]

&gt;Do you ever find anyone in your dream? Sam asked.

&gt;Jon shook his head. **No one.** The castle is always empty. He had never told anyone of the dream, and he did not understand why he was telling Sam now, yet somehow it felt good to talk of it. Even the ravens are gone from the rookery, and the stables are full of bones. That always scares me. I start to run then, throwing open doors, climbing the tower three steps at a time, screaming for someone, for anyone. And then I find myself in front of the door to the crypts. Its black inside, and I can see the steps spiraling down. Somehow I know I have to go down there, but I dont want to. **Im afraid of what might be waiting for me. The old Kings of Winter are down there, sitting on their thrones with stone wolves at their feet and iron swords across their laps, but its not them Im afraid of.** I scream that Im not a Stark, that this isnt my place, but its no good, I have to go anyway, so I start down, feeling the walls as I descend, with no torch to light the way. **It gets darker and darker, until I want to scream**. He stopped, frowning, embarrassed. Thats when I always wake. - Jon, A 


Unlike Jon, Arya enters the room filled with monsters. 

&gt;""It's dead,"" she said aloud. ""It's just a skull, it can't hurt me."" **Yet somehow the monster seemed to know she was there. She could feel its empty eyes watching her through the gloom**, and there was something in that dim, cavernous room that did not love her. **She edged away from the skull and backed into a second, larger than the first.** (Arya is literally sitting inside the skull of a Dragon. A warg and future skin-changer. Hmm.) For an instant she could feel its teeth digging into her shoulder, as if it wanted a bite of her flesh. 

After Syrio holds off the Gold Cloaks, Arya runs and only knows one way out of the Red Keep: The hidden room of dead dragons. This time the encounter is very different. 

&gt;Could she find the room with the monsters again? 

...

&gt;She would need to go down the serpentine steps, past the small kitchen and the pig yard, that was how she'd gone last time, chasing the black tomcat . . . 

&gt;This time the monsters did not frighten her. They seemed almost old friends. Arya held the candle over her head. With each step she took, the shadows moved against the walls, as if they were turning to watch her pass. Dragons, she whispered. She slid Needle out from under her cloak. The slender blade seemed very small and the dragons very big, yet somehow Arya felt better with steel in her hand. 

As Arya escapes through a secret tunnel under the Red Keep, she remembers Winterfells crypt:

&gt;Suddenly Arya remembered the crypts at Winterfell.

A childhood memory of all the Stark children (minus Rickon) in the crypts and a ghost jumps out and scares them. That ghost was Jon, covered in flour joking around. Before he's revealed, Arya punches the ""ghost"" and baby Bran is clutching Arya's hand and Robb's leg. Sansa had already run away. 


&gt;The memory made Arya smile, and after that the darkness held no more terrors for her. ... **She was going home.** Everything would be better once she was home again, safe behind Winterfell's grey granite walls.


2 Notes:

**The tunnels under the Red Keep:**

&gt;Red Keep was commissioned by Aegon the Conqueror, yet was only finished in the time of his son Maegor. Maegor, whose mother was accused of using witchcraft in order to conceive him, and who he himself was accused of using dark magics.

&gt;About the Red Keep, he said: *""only the blood of the dragon will know it's secrets.""*

Yet GRRM chooses this way for Arya to find her freedom? 

~*~

**Where is Arya's Home?**

This line from her nightmare:

&gt;By then it would be safe for her to come creeping back out and **find her way home.**

In Jon's mind, is Winterfell Arya's home? In ADWD, Jon knows ""Arya"" is Winterfell yet he thinks this:

&gt;**Bring her home**, Mance. I saved your son from Melisandre, and now I am about to save four thousand of your free folk. You owe me this one little girl. - Jon, ADwD

Is the Wall Arya's home? No, it's wherever Jon is. Just like Arya's second visit to the room full of dead dragons, Jon will enter the crypts at Winterfell again and the King's of Winter will not frighten him. In fact, he will one day join them as a KiTN.

I'm rewatching the show and got to this part. This is the only time on the show that Tywin doesn't get the have the last word. That nervous playing with keys at the end is perfect! She played her last card and it was very effective. I like to think this is the reason he just gives up and has to take Shae to his bad to maybe feel better.

Even if they dont they have several cousins and other relatives who can inherit highgarden.

Martin named his work ""A song of ice and fire"". I was just wondering on your thoughts on what it could be and if it could be a subtle hint from Martin.  
  
The **obvious** solution would be Jon (half Targ hence fire, half Stark hence ice). But this would be too easy no? Maybe a red herring? I'm not sure what all the book and show cases are when it comes to singing. So maybe we could focus on the singing part. Rhaegar was known to sing a lot and I feel it is important since that was mentioned on the show. ""A song of ice and fire"" could mean so much more than lineage or seasons. Maybe I'm reading too much into it but what other stuff than ""Jon duh!"" could be the reason for his choice of title?

What if GoT had more money on those crucial first seasons, would they done something differently? Shot something they had to scrap due to budget reasons? What if they just could have squeezed in a few more scenes and maybe even episodes. What should they be about? 

So,imagine if you will, that after the main filming is over, HBO decide to lengthen the season by a few episodes and grant D&amp;D more time and money for extra shootings. You are the director of those shootings. What story lines and/or scenes you want bolstered? No major rewriting, as the main filming has already been done, but you can complement and expand. 

There is nothing I really need for seasons 1-3, but this I would like to have seen in seasons 4-6.  

4: Maybe no extra episode, but some extra scenes of Yara trying to rescue Theon, and her retreat back home through Bolton held North, and her witnessing the slow defeat of Iron Born in it. 

5: Maybe one extra episode due to more scenes filmed throughout the season, including more time spent on Martells interacting with each other in the first half of the season, and especially Doran as he tries to rule his unruly country and family. Before Jaime sails away, a tension-filled scene where Bronn overhears and confronts Dornish guards unhappy with Doran, and some other foreshadowing, to set up Ellaria's coup in the next season. 

Also some more scenes in Stannis's camp, to highlight the despair of the march to Winterfell. 

And Brienne and Pod in the North, interacting with Bolton-soldiers and Stark-loyalist peasants, while waiting for the candle. 

6: 13 episodes. Yeah, I got a lot I would have wanted to see. 
An extra episode after The Door, that focuses on Bran as he travels across time and space in his dreams, witnessing events that shaped his world, trying to make sense of it all. He sees the death of his grandfather and uncle, the slaying of the Mad King, maybe the entirety of Tower of Joy. We cut to Meera trying to defend Bran from wights, and episode ends with Bran finally managing to return to reality and Benjen rescuing them at the nick of time. 

The remaining two extra episodes happen due to extra scenes filmed across the season, including some time spent before Kings Moot, to heighten and explore the rivalry and hostility between Euron and Yara, and maybe Theon reminiscing his late father, Jon talking to his imprisoned murderers who cannot believe their eyes, Tyrion trying to rule Meereen and weed out sons of Harpy, and to give more time to Tommen being converted and estranged from his mother. 

A scene in episode 6, between High Sparrow and brother Lancel that sheds light on his way of ruling the sparrows. ",19,6,False,self,,,,,

I believe that, like in the show, Winds of Winter will showcase Cersei going full Mad Queen - blowing up the Sept of Baelor and many of her subjects. However, in the books Cersei will be able to kill many more people who didn't appear in the show. 

Some of these characters will include; Dorna Lannister (ne Swyft) and her two children Martyn and Janei Lannister. Cersei would not have been aiming to kill these three characters, but they just happened to get in her way as Dorna insisted on attending Cersei's trial in place of her husband Kevan Lannister (who had recently been murdered) and to support her son Lancel.

When Harys is informed that his daughter and grandchildren have been murdered, at the hands of Cersei, he will betray the Lannisters by returning Arya to Westeros.",8,7,False,self,,,,,

1. He won the favor of a Hightower at a tourney and eventually her hand in marriage despite being from a poor Northern house with a completely different culture and geographic location than what she was used to.

2. He sold poachers to slavers. I believe they are called ""passerby"" or something of that nature, meaning it wasn't pre-planned. Why would there be slavers on the West end of Westeros? The nearest place to sell them is half a world away.

Any ideas about this? The story seems well backed up, but some details don't seem to add up.

The more I think about it the more I'm thinking Dany is a major red herring made to make us think she is so significant that she HAS to play a part in the story the while way through when in reality she might not have to. The title of the book ""ASOIAF"" would lead us to believe the obvious that Jon is the ice and Dany is the Fire and that the entire series hinges on their eventual meeting up and wether or not that meeting is going to be a love story or a war. Now that it's confirmed that Jon is a Targ the ""song"" could be exclusive to him and not necessarily have anything to do with Dany. I think it's possible that Dany's significance will be in getting the dragons to Westeros and as the WW's make it further and further south somehow Jon end up taking control of the Dragons and save the day. There's a whole lot of other more detailed approaches I think GRRM will take to ""cover his tracks"" with the Dany story and how it could be possible for her to die with all her plot armor but I do believe it's going to happen. Right now she is on her way to Westeros to take the throne and as hated as Cersei is she should be able to steam roll Kings Landing. There was some foreshadowing with the trouble Euron will bring but all logic tells us that the thrones is Dany's for the taking... and that's where people fall into trouble with this show. Nothing is a sure thing. I think this season we are going to get to see just how much Euron should be feared and i think the only way we get to see that is him doing massive damage to Dany's fleet. I have a feeling Dany is going to get blown out of the water, maybe make it to Kings Landing with her troops extremely weakened and I think Cersei, the character everyone assumes is a goner, will stomp her flame out. I just don't see how Jon and Dany can coexist, we are all waiting for their inevitable ""meet cute"" and I think that will be a major curveball thrown our way... they will never meet and Dany ""the mother of dragons, the breaker of chains , the blah blah blah blah..."" with all the excitement built up for this massive firework that is supposed to explode in the sky of Kings Landing will be a dud and just kind of fizzle out.

The commentary (extra features on the DVD/BR) for that episode had Michelle MacLaren (Director) and GRRM who wrote this episode (but actually didn't write this one scene and kind of went out of his way to make that clear). This isn't verbatim, but the conversation went

MM: One of the ladies had a... how should we say it... certain things about her are not of this era. When we were getting ready to shoot this scene, one of the AD's came in and said Michelle, we might have a problem. I said what? He said ""One of the girls has a Brazilian"". I said oh god... what's a Brazilian again? And... idk if you know what I'm talking about George, but.. 

GRRM: I *do* know what you're talking about 

MM: ...but we didn't think a Brazilian was of this era, so we had to do a little makeup

Which is then followed by a short conversation between the two about razor blades and styles.

Season 7 is a long ways off, and at least this is *something* kind of new. Which girl was it? I'm guessing Myranda since she had a close up. Who applies the makeup? They can't just let her do it herself, they need movie quality makeup, but that's awfully intimate for someone else to be doing... 

Also, another interesting tidbit that's safe for the whole family... the next scene is where Ygritte and Jon are hunting the deer (the windmill/""Do you like girls who swoon, Jon Snow"" scene), and the deer they brought in had a donkey on set so that it had a friend to hang out with. 

Just a few random facts, because the offseason is long and full of boredom!

PS. Don't ever watch the commentaries that are only Sophie, Maisie and Brans actor. They spend most of the time... acting like 12 year olds (season 3 shooting was 5 years ago, so they were), making wierd noises, talking about Ice Age and memes and then you get to Theon torture scenes and dead hookers and it's just horribly awkward. You'd think they would pull them out for those scenes, but nope.

She has her list, but after that, what would her goal be? She doesn't fit in with the faceless men, and I doubt she would fit in as a Stark at this point. I believe she will last for a while, but probably die before the end unless there is some other goal or life for her.

Sansa, on the other hand, has experienced a much more drastic character arc than Arya. (cue hate here). She has gone from a little girl who believed in fairy-tales, to a much more mature woman who sees through Littlefinger and stands up for herself. She still has her humanity even through all of the horrible things she's been through, and I believe she can have a happy ending if she lives through everything.

I somehow always disliked this character, but I was never able to point my finger on what it was that bugged me about him. I asked myself quite a few times ""Why do I hate this character?"" because it was just so untypical for me. I hated how he looked, when I actually, genuinely don't care about stuff like that. I hated that he was fat, that he had this disgusting baby beard, I hated his entire cowardly, baby-like attitude, his weak smile, his cringey sex scene, I just hated everything about him.

And I never understood why. I never had such an utter disgust towards a fictional character, never against a a villain, and sure as hell never against a ""good guy"". Today I finally figured out, that it's not his looks, his attitude, not even his story that makes me hate him.

I hate him because he breaks the fourth wall.

Just for those who don't know, [breaking the fourth wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_wall) means that an actor or movie does something that makes the viewer remember again that he is watching a play or a movie. This can be a cool device, but often when it happens unintentionally it is frustrating. And this happens to me with Sam.

Frankly, I find it obvious that Samwell Tarly is the GoT incarnation of George RR Martin himself. It is his own little role, as someone who watches everything play out, interact with the protagonists, make a minor impact and in the end, he will write everything down. I see all these ""father-conflicts"" in GoT, the focus on father-children relationship, which is also GRRM writing about his own conflict with his father, and Sam and his father are the most obvious manifestation of all problems GRRM always had with his dad. Everytime Sam is on screen or mentioned, this reminds me that there is a guy, who even looks quite like Sam, who wrote all this stuff and made this one character for himself. It breaks the entire magic of the show (and books) for me, it suddenly kicks me out of Westeros straight back to planet earth, with all my own problems, when I just wanted to relax and watch GoT.

That's why I hate Samwell Tarly.",7,8,False,self,,,,,

In the final moments, we only see one dog attacking him chewing off part of his face. Nice. However, the other two dogs are just barking. In the next moments where Sansa is walking away, look at the dogs at the side of Ramsay, are they actually chewing him or the ropes?   
Right, now this next part where Sansa is out of the scene, the camera purposely blurs but you can still see the shadow or outline. Concentrate on this scene. Now, tell me does he actually stand up? Look closely and keep replaying this part where Sansa leaves the scene until the end. I've watched this so many times but to me you can just about make out from the shadow that he actually stands up. **You'll need to watch this scene in high quality and not on YouTube quality**.

They win the battle but most of Euron's fleet still stands and most of Dany's fleet is damaged and Euron kidnaps The Second sons fleet, Kinevara, Daario, Missendei, and Yara. Dany forces split up with Dany, The Dothraki, and The Ironborn takinf dragonstone. The Unsullied taking Casterly Rock, and The Dornish and Highgraden headed back home.

When Dany takes Dragonstone Tyrion suggest they send a Raven to the north to add in the battle she at first refuses as she does not want help from a house that added Robert Baratheon but after some convincing from Theon Dany decides to send a Raven to get add from Jon and his forces. In the North Jon receives the Raven. It states that Dany needs the North's help taking KL Jon at first decides not to as he just finished a battle with Ramsay and the white walkers are coming. However Howland Reed arrives and reveals his parentage then Jon decides to march south to help add his aunt in the invasion bringing with him Davos, Ghost, his northern army, and Howland and his army.

On there way to the vale to take a ship to Dragonstone they run into Brienne, Pod, and Jorah who have heard of Jon being crowned king of the north and want to help (also Jorah has cured his greyscale at this point) They decide to let them come with them. Also they run into The Hound who has left the brotherhood (The Brotherhood and Arya have made it north at this point by the way) who decides to tag along.

Meanwhile Dany and her dragons have claimed the dragonspit. Wall that is happening Euron comes to Cersei where it is revealed that Daario is a spy for Euron and both bend the knee to her. Randall also comes in and bends the knee to Euron NOT Cersei and has Sam and Marwyn as his hostages.

Meanwhile Jon, Davos, Brienne, Pod, Jorah, Howland, The Hound, and the northern armies arrive at dragonstone to meet with Dany. Jon explains not only of the threat coming to Westeros but also he is her nephew and she is his aunt and that they are related. (also Jon and Theon get into a little heated reunion) Anyways Dany takes Jon to the dragons where Jon bonds with Rhaegal. Anyways The Martells, The Tyrells, and The Unsullied return from where they were to meet at the dragonspit for the big meeting to give the enemies a last minute chance to surrender (however Davos and Tyrion pick up Gendry from KL before hand) Gendry, Howland, The Martells, The Tyrells, and the Dothraki Commander all wait at dragonstone.

Wall Dany, Jon, Davos, Brienne, Pod, Grey Worm, Tyrion, Jorah, Varys, and the Hound all meet at dragonspit with Cersei, Jaime, Bronn, Euron, Qyburn, and the Mountain to discuss one last chance to surrender with Euron bringing Yara and Missendei as his hostages. It fails and Cersei tricks Dany into letting one of her dragons loose and Euron uses a Balistae laced with wildfire and shots it at Viserion killing him on site. And Euron kills Missendei right in front of Grey Worm.

So they all escape and Cleganebowl also happens. The Hound wins and kills his brother but dies not long after to blood lose and Qyburn is burned alive by one of the other dragons. Meanwhile Gendry escapes dragonstone where he finds Arya the two have a reunion and decide to go to KL to kill cersei.

Meanwhile everyone regroups at Dragonstone and think up a plan to attack KL. Wall Cersei, Euron, Daario, and Randall think up a plan to defend the city. Also Jaime and Bronn conspire to turn on Cersei.

EDIT: Apparently some one send me that Nymeria and Ellaria get taken hostage so i guess Euron takes them as well along side Yara and Missendei but i don't think Obara and Tyrene will die until the battle

A little background first. I am watching Season 2 currently, up to mid-season but because of the internet I know some of the major reveals and plot points. I have really enjoyed getting back into the show since I first watched season 1 several years ago. I joined a fantasy football league (32 teams) that is asoiaf themed with each team representing a house or faction earlier this year and had to pick a house from the Iron Islands or Riverlands (my team/house must be from that location). I looked at house sigils and sayings, choosing the most fun/humorous one since I was only familiar with the great houses and those were already taken. I ended up choosing House Wode which has been fun (I get to make puns/play on words and make [sweet sigil/uniforms](http://www53.myfantasyleague.com/fflnetdynamic2016/53309_franchise_logo0008.jpg)) but now that I have more knowledge and appreciation of asoiaf I want to choose a house with more prominence; a house I can be proud of while watching the show or reading the books.

So /r/gameofthrones, is there a Riverlands or Iron Islands house that is **particularly awesome**? Who has the **best sigil**? Who has the **best words**? Who is the most **proudly featured** in the books/show? Is there a Riverlands or Iron Island house that looks to be **more featured in the upcoming season**?

Here is a list of the houses/factions already taken in the Riverlands/Iron Islands so they are not available:

* Greyjoy
* Tully
* Brotherhood without Banners

Or if they really are all wiped out without a single surviving member and the crown DID default to the Lannisters, wouldn't Jaime come before her in that particular line of succession? She was the Queen / Queen Mother, but from what I've always gathered, that really doesn't put her in any position to inherit, hell, she's not even entitled to get the Kings last name and even if she were, the Tyrell line would have precedence at that point. You could probably argue that she won it by right of conquest, but that really leaves things in a curious position for next season. What do you guys think?

Jaime, obviously, killed the Mad King Targaryen. 

Tyrion, while he didn't actually poison king Joffrey, everyone believes he did.

And Cersei, who is responsible for king Tommond's suicide.

Everyone in Westeros like to shit on Jaime for being a kingslayer, but apparently regicide is something the Lannisters are quite good at. 
In fact, the Lannisters also had Robb Stark, the _King_ In The North, murdered on their behalf.

And they've indirectly contributed to the deaths of two other kings. 
Stannis Baratheon, after the Lannisters defeated him at the battle of the Blackwater, was forced to attack the North where he met his untimely demise.
They also killed prince Oberyn Martell in a trial by combat, which led indirectly to the murder of prince Doran Martell. Two Dornish princes dead because of the Lannisters.
And let's not forget how they wiped out pretty much all of house Tyrell. 
And, as The Rains Of Castamere tells us, they completely eradicated house Casterly as well.

The Lannisters excel in destroying houses and murdering kings. 
In fact, they've murdered notable members of almost every house in Westeros except house Greyjoy and house... Lannister. Yes, they killed Tywin, but he was no king. And the Lannisters had the current king tightly under their control, so it was hardly a dent in their power. 

Speaking of which... isn't there a Lannister on the Iron Throne right now? A certain Queen that's just oozing evil and begging to be killed?
Hmmm, just food for thought.",12,15,False,self,,,,,

For the longest time, I heard many say that Sansa's value as the Key to the North was meaningless. I felt the same, the show made it seem like no one cared that Sansa was on the loose (despite everyone who wanted no part giving excellent reasons not to get involved). 

I believe Sansa's value was important to everything that happened in the North. 

Take the Umbers for instance, a polarizing aspect of season 6. I've heard many say that the Umbers allied with Ramsay, and they didn't even have the key to the North! 

And sure, Smalljon helped Ramsay - because both wanted the Wildlings gone. 

Now think about the long term. What about later? What about his entire introductory scene? Smalljon outright refused to swear loyalty to the Boltons, even after Greatjon passes away, refusing to do so - he still despises their family and refuses to outright pledge any oaths of fealty. Smalljon even gave Rickon to ensure the bargain was true (I believe he assumed Jon would have wanted to trade Sansa for Rickon, but Ramsay had other plans; either way, what use was there for Smalljon to continue holding Rickon aside from making themselves liable? Not defending them, really - just understanding them).

So, think about all that. Having the Key to the North, Sansa, would ensure a united North in the long-term.

And that's why Ramsay fucked everything for his house. He was treated like a maniac and died like one too. ",10,13,False,self,,,,,

Jon forces with some Dothraki land further in the storm lands to try and rally some of the people there and march to the front gates. Wall Dany's fleet with some Martell and Tyrell ships attack the eastern gates however Euron's fleet with the second sons fleet and some Lannister and Tarly ships come in Yara and Theon's Fleet with some Martell and Tyrell ships go to deal with them. We get an epic sea battle with sships being destroyed by cannon fire, Soldiers swinging from ropes and fighting on them, Ships smashing into each other, And Theon and Daario have an epic duel with Theon Decapitating Daario. 

Euron kills Tyrene and then tries to awaken a Kraken but it backfires and he calls out plan B. It is revealed that Euron and Qyburn were making a Zombie Frankenstein dragon from the dragon bones underneath the red keep. He awakens the dragon and wall Theon is distracted Euron kills theon. Dickon (leading the Tarly ships) tries to convince his men to change sides but it backfires as he is thrown over board by his own men. The Zombie Dragon burns most of the Pro Dany Greyjoy fleet and a good amount of the Martell and Tyrell ships with them.

Dany notices this and sends her dragon Rhaegal after it. Rhaegal and the Zombie Dragon fight in the sky meanwhile Euron tries to awaken the sea Kraken again this time he comes very close but before he can finish Yara attacks Euron and the two fight in an epic duel Yara comes in top and kills Euron plunging her sword into her eye and decapitating his head. As Euron's corpse falls into the sea the Kraken fails to awaken. Meanwhile Rhaegal is losing to The Zombie dragon and in one last attempt Yara uses Euron's Balistae laces it with Wildfire and fires at the Zombie Dragon (but waits for a clear shot) when she gets a clear shot she fire and kills the Zombie Dragon.

The Pro Euron Greyjoy fleet changes sides and helps Yara take down the rest of the Tarly, Lannister, and second sons ships. Meanwhile Dickon Tarly washes up on shore and races to the red keep as fast as he can to free Sam and Marwyn the Mage.

Varys indicates he has shunned all desire from his mind as he has seen what desire can do to men and how it can keep them from their goals. Oberyn then asks Varys what his goal is and Varys gestures towards the iron throne.

What are your thoughts? Is he indicating that he wants to win the throne for someone else (i.e. Dany, Aegon, etc.)? OR Is he saying he wants the throne for himself? 

Personally, I've never fully believed him when he's said his sole motive is to have a peaceful realm, so I want to believe he's gunning for the throne himself. I think Varys is playing a bigger game than everyone (bigger than Littlefinger) because he understands that with the way things are poised, there will be all-out annihilation between Dany and Cersei (think of all the wildfyre her dragons are going to blow up). I think he's positioned everything in such a way that no big house will be left standing at the end, and he'll be the only one left with power.

So anyways Jon's forces with some Dothraki land further in the storms land they try to rally the people but it fails as the people of Storm's lands do not want to risk it so Jon along with Howland, Ghost, Davos, Brienne, Pod, and the their armies with the Dothraki that came with them march to KL. Meanwhile Arya and Gendry sneak into the city through the sewers where Gendry explains that he is a leader of a Resistance with help from a Priest (played by Mads Mikkelsen) and his new established Faith Militant have been helping Gendry and his resistance.

When Gendry and Arya get to the hideout Arya introduce themselves and her, Gendry, and the Priest try to figure out a plan to attack however Arya suggests that they rally the citizens to start a Riot at the center of the city as a distraction so she and some Resistance can let Jon's armies in. The Priest does not agree with using the people as a distraction but he has no other choice at this point. So The Priest rallies the people and starts a Riot and Gendry leads some Resistance and septs to the eastern gates to assist Dany.

Meanwhile Arya and some of the Resistance attack the main gate and Arya using her faceless men skills sneaks into the area where they open the doors into the city and opens the doors to the city allowing Jon and his forces to charge in head on. Arya uses her faceless men skills to get out of there and before she can talk to Jon though she remembers why she is here and presses on. Jon and his armies along with Howland's army, The Dothraki, the small folk/Resistance/Faith fight the Lannister soldiers, City Guards, and The Tarly Soldiers. they are winning until Randall Tarly, Jaime Lannister, and some Kingsguard show up.

Randall Tarly Brutally murders Brienne of Tarth, Davos is killed by two kingsguard, and right at this moment Jaime changes sides and kills the two Kingsguard who killed Davos then fights Randall Tarly in the streets. Confused Jon and Howland kill the other Kingsguard. Meanwhile Arya kills Illyn Payne for the death of her father and makes her way to where Gendry is. Wall that is happening Dany's forces with some of the Martell and Tyrell forces attack the Eastern gates wall Yara and the greyjoy fleet with some Martell and Tyrell ships go up against Euron's fleet and the Second sons fleet.

The Unsullied, the Dornish Soldiers, the Highgarden Soldiers, and the other Dothraki that did not go with Jon land on the shore and start shoting catabolts at the walls. In this moment Gendry and some Small folk/Resistance/Faith Militants attack the Lannister, Tarly, and Second Sons soldiers guarding the gates and Bronn changes sides letting Dany's forces, The Dornish Forces, and the Tyrell forces into the city and they overpower them to the point where some of the soldiers and guards in the main areas of the city move there attention to the eastern gates which allows Jon and his forces finish off who stayed.

Meanwhile Jaime and Randall continue to fight and the fight takes them to the blacksmith and in a mindless fit of rage Randall slips and goes into the blacksmith fire getting burned alive. Jaime then goes back to where Jon was. Tyrion, Jorah, Obara, Grey Worm, The Dothraki Commander, and Gendry fight at the Eastern gates. However the Lannister and Tarly Archermen start firing arrows Bronn is killed by a field of arrows, Obara is killed by a kingsguard, and Grey Worm gets wounded. However Dany and her dragons burn the archers from below and accidentally some innocent citizens.

Gendry and Arya regroup and make their way to the red keep. Jon, Jorah, Tyrion, Howland, Ghost, Pod, Grey Worm, Jaime, and The Dothraki commander all meet up at the eastern gates Jaime explains that he is sorry for how he belittle Jon at winterfell and that he was a terrible person then and he has changed. Jon accepts it but reluctantly. He also explains that Cersei plans to blow the whole city up with wildfire as self defense. Tyrion, Jorah, and Pod race to find the other wildfire barrels and dispose of them wall Jon, Jaime, Ghost, and some of his soldiers and some Dothraki race to the red keep to stop cersei wall the Dothraki Commander, Howland and Grey Worm stay to finish off some of the remaining Tarly forces and second sons.

So I was reading Clash of Kings and am at the part where Dany is in the Warlock's Social Club having visions and we hear ""The dragon has three heads"" and while there's a lot of speculation usually in the form of ""Tyrion is a secret Targaryan"" a thought occurred to me.

Speculation about how Dany is Fire and Jon is Ice sounds good, but now that the show has stated the obvious and told us what we all knew, we know that Jon is Ice And Fire, so with Dany that would be like two fires to one Ice. And then I thought of some spoilery pictures that have come out leading to speculation that one of the dragons will be killed and raised by the Night King and then it hit me.

Of course, the Night King IS the third rider.

He is the embodiment of Ice.

And further speculation, I'm willing to guess that he was also a Stark when he was human. So Stark is Ice, Targaryan is Fire and Jon Snow is both.",60,139,False,self,,,,,

There are few points that never have added up to me even with the current theories that are out there - 

Here is what I'm pretty sure is true:

Ned and Ashara Dayne fell in love.

Ned danced with Ashara Dayne at Harrenhall.

Ashara was dishonored resulting in a pregnancy.

Ned used a wetnurse in the service of the Daynes to nurse Jon Snow (Edric Dayne says this)

Here are some things that may or may not be true:
Ashara's child was a stillborn daughter.

Ashara jumped from a tower at Starfall to her death sick from grief over her child and brother(?) or love lost (Ned)

Here are some things don't add up that may or may not be related to Ashara Dayne:
If Ned Stark killed Arthur Dayne and either he or his brother dishonored Ashara Dayne why would the Daynes name Edric 'Ned' Dayne after him.

Dany and the Red Door/Lemon Tree

Stretchmarks on Septa Lemore.

Who do we actually think fathered her child and if you believe she is still alive (her death is basically the book version of an off screen death) then where is she?

Jon, Jaime, Ghost and a handful of Dothraki and Jon's soldiers race to the red keep Tyrion, Jorah, and Pod go to find the wildfire barrels and destroy them before they can be set off with help from some Rouge little birds. Meanwhile Grey Worm and the Unsullied, and Howland and his armies go to deal with the remaining Tarly soldiers and Second sons to there surprise the Remaining tarly soldiers and Second sons. Have surrender and the remaining Lannister soldiers and city guards have surrendered as well so Howland and a hand full of his men catch up to Jon and the others wall Grey Worm and a hand full of Unsullied with the Dothraki commander and a handful of Dothraki go to help dispose of the wildfire in the city.

Meanwhile Dickon finds Sam, Marwyn, Ellaria, and Nymeria imprisoned and let's them out and help's them escape to outside the city where they will be safe until the battle is over however they are confronted by some Lannister soldiers but Sam with Heartsbane along side his brother take down the soldiers and make there way to outside the city. Wall this is happening Grey Worm and Tyrion find barrels of wildfire and destroy them before it is too late and Jorah, Pod, and the Dothraki commander also find barrel and destroy them with help from the Rouge little birds. But one of Euron's men (played by Connor Mcgregor) was put in where the second last supply of wildfire was placed and is guarding it with some Ironborn and second sons Grey worm attacks him and either one of two things happen A. Grey worm is killed by Euron's crew member or B. Grey worm is wounded either way The Dothraki commander comes in and fights him one on one as Jorah, Pod, and some Dothraki fight the other Ironborn and second sons who were with him.

Meanwhile Jon, Jaime, Ghost, Howland, and the men with them make it to the red keep Jon, Ghost, Howland, and the men fight against the kingsguard, The Lannister soldiers, and The Ironborn who are guarding the keep as a last defense wall Jaime makes his way to the red keep to confront Cersei. Arya is near the throne room but is stop by Jaqen who has come to kill her for leaving the faceless men they fight and Arya wins but is wounded from the fight. She makes her way to the throne room where Cersei is Arya comes out and before she can kill her she chooses family over vengeance and allows Jaime to go for the final kill making Jaime the queenslayer Jaime sees Arya on the ground wounded and runs her to the healing room where Kinevara is.

Jon, Ghost, and Howland find the last patch of barrels of wildfire and put out the candles before they can be set off. They then dispose of the wildfire and right when all seems good there is yet another Zombie Dragon created by Qyburn and Euron. It comes out and goes to Dany who is on drogon. Dany on drogon fights the zombie dragon with Rhaegal by her side Jon is shocked but senses something is wrong and he and Ghost go to the throne room wall Howland and his men stay to destroy the rest of the barrels under orders from Jon. Dany fights and tries to kill the monster frankenstein dragon but it is no use. the other dragon some how gets Rhaegal to turn on Dany and the Zombie dragon snaps Drogons neck with it's jaw and Dany and drogon fall to the water.

Jorah, Pod, (Grey Worm if still alive), and the Dothraki commander destroy the last of the wildfire and if Grey Worm dies Jorah carries him out in his arms. Dany arises from the water and finds her Drogon on the shore dead the dragon she loved the most as a child, the one she named after her husband Khal Drogo, the the one dragon we thought would live to the end is dead. Dany cries over the corpse of her dragon child and when the Monster deformed Dragon of Euron comes to finish her off she yells at the dragon and then makes it look into her eyes the Dragon then is calm and dany puts her head on the dragon. Rhaegal also returns to control and Dany adopts Qyburn's Zombie dragon as her own with it going to Drogon's body sad over what it has done.

Jon and Ghost make there way to the Throne room where they find Jaime on the Iron throne waiting for Dany. Jaime informs him that Arya is in the healing room Jon rushes to the healing room where he finds Kinevara attending to the wounded, and Arya in a bed of blood. Either one of two things happen A. Arya makes Jon promise that he will never tell Sansa or Bran about how she has killed people and also not to be angry at Jaime because he was the one who took her to the healing room in the first place. He promises and she then dies in Jon's arms or B. She is stitched back up and they have a reunion with Jon relieved that she is not about to die. Jorah finds Dany near Drogon's corpse and tells her it is all over she is queen.

Dany rides The Zombie Dragon who she names Aegonion after her great grandfather Aegon the conqueror to the red keep where she enters the throne room and Jaime moves from the iron throne with Dany sitting the iron throne. Tyrion finds Ellaria and Nymeria and poisons them for Myrcella. Varys resumes his role as Master of Whisperers, Illyrio and Surella Sand are send Raven's with Surella being told she is legitimized and made queen of Dorne and Illyrio is master of coin, Olenna remains lady of highgarden but when she dies Dickon Tarly will rule Highgarden but until then he is spared and send home, Yara is made master of ships and queen of the Iron Islands, Jaime is Banished from King's landing and send north to join the night's watch, Tyrion is offered Casterly Rock but declines it and remains hand, If Grey Worm lives he is Commander of the City watch if he dies The Dothraki commander is, Jorah is made head of queensguard, and Gendry is legitimized and made lord of storm's end and is betrothed to a noble woman (and if Arya lives she is betrothed to Gendry).

Feedback appreciated!**  

A bastard of House Stark whose name is Snow  

with nothing to inherit, a brother to crows  

His father he loved but his mother he never knew  

for reasons which he has no clue  

Father never spoke of her which he never understood  

of his bloodline he was lied to for his own good  

His origin is one of love and war  

promised in secrecy, mentioned nevermore  

There was once a prince with silver hair and lilac eyes  

whom everyone adored but the stag despised  

He left the princess for the love of another  

that of the future King Usurper  

It was during the false spring at Harrenhal  

in sight of Gods, in sight of all  

to Lyanna a crown of blue roses Rhaegar bestowed  

and Robert started a war to win back his betrothed  

At the Trident they met, hammer and sword  

in what is now known as the ruby ford  

Robert's hammer came down on Rhaegars chest  

the prince's siblings fled while they killed the rest  

The war was won but the cause was lost  

Robert vowed to win back Lyanna at any cost  

She was found by her brother in a now long fallen tower  

in a bed of blood smelling of blue flowers  

Seven on three for the life of his sister  

simply because Rhaegar couldn't resist her  

A storm of blue rose pedals blew accross the sky  

as metal met metal and all but two men died  

Ned wept as her final final words were said  

""Promise me. Promise me, Ned.""  

If Robert had known, the child would die  

so to the rest of the world Ned would lie  

He returned home to Winterfell with infant in hand  

a stain on his honor whom Catelyn couldn't stand  

A bastard named Jon, born of the dragon and dire  

a prince that was promised, whose song is of ice and fire

Sure they have a powerful army and respectable name. However, aside from Blackfish, I don't see any Tully who has legit uncanny traits to boast.



Lysa Arryn is a given. She is one of the most terrible characters in the show. Probably she's on the top 3 in my list (together with Craster and Viserys). If she is a real Tully by character, then I think the Tullys are awful.

Next one is her older sister, Cat. I rewatched S1E1-3 last week and my hate for Cat just grew. She uses her highborn profile to her advantage and without it, I don't think she can make a rational decision on her own. Like Cersei, she's not as smart as she thinks she is. She was easily played by Littlefinger and Tyrion. A classic ""Chess piece"" in the game of thrones.

The next one is Edmure Tully. I mean, from the get go, we've seen him to be an incompetent man. The difference of him and Blackfish through smart directing is shown during Hoster's funeral. Edmure's incompetence is shown throughout the course of the series.

I mean, if you look at other houses. Baratheon bros were great on their respective fields. Tyrells siblings too. Stark, even though having a Tully blood in them have several redeeming qualities. Martells look decent. Oberyn's a badass. The Lannisters MAY be another case but if you look at Tywin, Kevan, and Jaime, they're all powerful men individually.

Perhaps the show decided to drop this quest but that would be queer since the crypts of Winterfell is quite a grand narrative both in the show and especially in the books. Personally I belive Howland Reed might have taken hold of Ned's bones in order to return them to Winterfell when it is back in Stark hands. 

When word gets out that Jon Snow has taken back Winterfell, Howland Reed surely would think the time has come to put his friend to rest. When/If this happens, he could reveal Jon Snow's parantage and all other sorts of things that Ned promised Lyanna. There are some theories believing the reveal will happen in the crypts, suggesting that there may exist something there to prove that Jon is the son of Rhaegar. If this were the case, maybe Ned planted such evidence and told Howland Reed so that the secret wouldnt be forgotten. What do you guys think?",16,13,False,self,,,,,

In sum, the ""O"" symbols that we see everywhere are similar to an ""Ankh,"" and represent life.  We also frequently see an ""X"" or ""Theta"" sign which foreshadows death.  The show's producers are using these O's and X's together as a portent of life and death in the series, and we can use them to accurately predict who will live and who will die.


The story has balance in many things:  the sun and moon, House of Black and White, ice and fire, life and death.  Many people noticed a circular image cut into two equal parts, from the Hand's pin to the moon door in the Eyrie.  It was labelled a ""Theta"" and one theory suggested that it represented the balance between two worlds with a similar origin.  This was a very general explanation though.  I wanted to figure out how this circular image related directly to the story and characters. 


Then I noticed something while re-watching the end of season one.  When Dany loses her baby, the tent is shrouded with ""X"" symbols.  X = Death.  Later when she first stands up with her dragons, the funeral pyre looks like the moon cracked open and Dany and her dragons poured out, exactly like the Dothraki legend.  These images are DIFFERENT.  We have TWO SYMBOLS here, with two different meanings.  The circular one alludes to birth and life, like an an egg cracking open.  I therefore believe the circle is not the Theta, rather it is most similar to the ancient Egyptian symbol called an ""ankh,"" a cross with a circle on top.  It was used to represent the gods ""handing"" life to mummies, as well as conception.  This is perfectly mirrored in the Hand's pin.  This deliverance of life would explain why the symbol would be popular with the white walkers as seen in the show's first scene, as well as represent birth.  (The white walkers are mummies, not zombies?!  What's next, main characters are werewolves?).


The ""X"" symbol more closely resembles the Theta, an ancient symbol of death.  It was used to denote which criminals for example, would be sentenced to die.  In an almost comical way, the show is telling us which characters are getting the death sentence.


It is fun and creepy to hunt for this X symbol once you know it means the kiss of death.  It is also shockingly accurate.  In the past we see it not just around Dany's death tent, but on the chest of literally every character who has thus far died.  The bigger the X, the more certain the death.  The Boltons had the largest X of all as their sigil and they are completely wiped from the history books.  eXcellent.  Ned wore a large leather X throughout season one.  Jon wears the same until he dies, then switches to a plainer tunic.  The Dothraki Kahls, Rob, Roz and Shae's dress necklines, the septons' chains, Ygritte's bow, the minor characters who we now know are toast:  X's everywhere.  The Hardhome camp is covered in X's, from the two fishes crossed over the meeting room to the wildling woman who crosses her arms right before accepting death.  Ray started to build a sept that was, unfortunately for him, a large structure of X's.  The windows around Tywin and the pattern on his leather tunic.  The pattern on Shireen's face.  Joffrey's enormous, oversized sash that crossed his belt.  A subtle, decorative X pattern on the windows behind Tommen and Cersei.  The X can also be a portent of danger.  In the case of Sansa, she never wore an X until the moment Robert sentenced Lady to die.  Arya, an assassin, often wears a net of X's.  If you are still unconvinced, choose any scene and re-watch it.  


My favorite scene is when Dany confronts the three Masters in Battle of the Bastards.  The men represent Life, Death and an Other.  The one who lives has a circular, cowl neckline.  His counterpart in the middle has a large X on his chest.   But there is also the third ""Other.""  That Master is making the shape of the Night King -- dragonglass -- with his hands.  Either that or he is bragging about his very large penis.  We see a lot of ""threes"" in the series, and this scene sums things up nicely:  there is a yin, yang and an in-between.  This idea was often represented in ancient symbols with three lines, like the ones dissecting the ""O"" in the show's title.  There are two eyes and a third, spiritual eye in between.  It is important to note that in this instance, the ""Other"" Master is killed, suggesting that there will be no negotiating with the Night King.  In this world he is an aberration, which fits with the notion that all men must die.


How does this affect the last last two seasons of the show?


Missandei:  I really like her but this Miss is going to die.  Her top is always shaped like a large X.  NOOOoooooooo.  This is tough to see once you recognize its significance, but it does make me appreciate her story differently.  I always pictured her ultimate importance would be after the main story ends -- she would be the mega translator for a newer, improved kingdom.  Now I think Missandei must have a critical scene where she tries to communicate with the white walkers and the Night King.  If anyone would be tasked with breaching that ancient language barrier, it would be her.  


Sir Daavos:  He frequently wears the large leather X on his chest.  Notably he was NOT wearing it during the Battle of the Bastards, but soon...  This is another NOOOooo because he is my favorite character and I also pictured him as Jon's right hand man in the new kingdom.  So what does this mean?  Someone else will need to be Jon's trusted advisor in the future, if Jon is even around.


Dolores Edd:  I was kind of hoping that his average skills as a man of the watch would keep him alive, but ""D. Edd"" is dead.  This is really disappointing.


Varys:  He also wears an X, more frequently in later seasons.  He's a goner, but this seems about right.


Sam:  He often wears a quilted jacket with a distinctive X pattern.  I am choosing to believe this is simply an oversight by the wardrobe department.  AN OVERSIGHT, I SAY.


Dornish ladies:  This is pleasing to see.  In their last scene chatting with Lady Olenna, all of them are wearing the large X except for Obarra.  Conveniently, Lady Olenna asked for Obarra's name, so when she is the sole survivor we will remember, ""Oh yeah, Obarra, the more diplomatic one.  The one who looks like an angry little boy.""  This also seems about right.  


Littlefinger:  His mark is genius.  His garb is completely plain except for his X-shaped Mockingjay pin.  Ygritte's X's were on her bow and she died by the bow.  Littlefinger's bird pin no doubt signifies he will either ""fly"" through the moon door as many speculate and/or die by Sansa's hand, the little bird of House Arryn.


Dany:  Her dress necklines are becoming increasingly more X-shaped as the show progresses and she will die eventually, probably in childbirth.


Cersei:  The pattern on her new, black dress is a sea of black X's.  Note that she also stopped wearing her necklace, an oval of life, when her last child died.  


The Mountain has a small X of swords on his chest.  Lady Olenna has a faint X on her new headpiece.  Jorah often wears a blue X around his neck as well as X-patterned leather by his grayscale.  Brienne's armor.  These characters are slowly but steadily working their way towards the ""end.""


Architecture:  If you see a building with obvious ""X"" architecture next season, expect that it will be annihilated.  


House sigils:  Woe to your house if your sigil is an X or sun.  The Theta or death symbol was sometimes written as a helios or sun.  We can therefore say goodby to not just the Boltons, but the Umbers, Karstarks and Martells.  We can also expect that House Arryn, the only true circle, will have a long, fruitful future.  


Who might live for now?  Jaime, at least through season 7.  The only X he wore was on his kingsguard armor (the same as the Mountain), and he violently ripped it off when Tommen sent him away.  Jaime's battle armor:  safe.  Jaime's King's Landing outfit:  NOT safe.  Also safe for now:  Theon, Yarra, Tormund, Tyrion, Gilly, the Hound and possibly Stannis.  Interestingly, I cannot see an X on Stannis' armor anywhere when Brienne swings, unless I'm missing something.  His armor is a bit confusing.  I would need to re-watch more episodes to see what he wore earlier.  


The Maesters also wear nothing but circular cowl necklines and circular chains.  This seems to fit their role as preservers of life within the realm.  I believe they are working much harder behind the scenes to save the realm than we know.  


There are other subtle symbols and patterns to consider.  The safe characters tend to wear a half-moon around their chest and neckline.  For example, Cersei and Tommen wore jewelry to that affect when the sept blew.  They were safe, but Tommen took his off before jumping.  I think the downward ""V"" is usually worn by southerners or Targs, and the upward triangle is often worn by northerners and the Night King.  When Sansa and Jon (Season 6, ep. 10) are watching Melisandre ride away, the camera spends a lot of time framing those two with triangles and the ""square"" parapet.  Maybe squares represent safety or division between the two.  Someone smart should re-watch the show to figure that out.


What has been seen cannot be unseen.  Once you start looking for these X's and O's, you will see the literal and figurative patterns everywhere.  This ""Where's Waldo"" of life and death makes re-watching the series, and making predictions, a lot of fun.

So far, practically every individual who has used this line, or a derivative thereof, has died a painful death: Robert decided to get a little tipsy and then got boared of living, Viserys' crown burned his eyebrows off, Joffery choked on his grapes, Tommen mucked up his *Assassin's Creed* audition, and Stannis (if we go by the TV series) got a slice of Brienne-pie.

Now whilst Robb never actually used these exact words, so far as I can remember, he also fell victim to I-am-the-King'itis along with Balon. So here's my question(s): Daenerys has definitely used the line ""I am the[ir rightful] Queen"" a number of times now; does this mean she's due for the chopping block? And on the flip-side, since Jon has never used this line, though granted he's only just been made King, but IMO he's not likely to use this line ever, so does that make him ""safe""?

The Church had full use of the resources of the land, but usually did not pay taxes or tribute, but was subject to the claims of service, when the king or lord called for the levy. Is this the case with the Gift and the Night's Watch? We know that the Night's Watch is supported by taxes and tribute in kind from the Gift. Food, clothing, equipment and weapons would be the sort of items that the Gift would provide. Now the Gift is the most northerly of the lands of the North and would probably be like northern Scotland in the summer and this implies a limit on the types of crops that can be grown and animals that can be raised, but still, given a population density equivalent to Scotland in 1300 AD and the implied size of the North (from GRRM), the Night's Watch of the size it had dropped to in the show would have been quite well provided for over the summer, enough to store food against the coming winter.

But the other part of the question is manpower. Certainly the standing forces of the Night's Watch are made up of volunteers and ""volunteers"" who ""take the Black"". But if the analogy between Church lands and the Gift remains true, then all free men of the Gift would be part of the levy, the feudal militia. Generally, the levy (the arriere ban or the great fyrd) would be all able bodied men able to bear arms. The arms would be usually kept at home, and while they might be no more than a helmet, shield and spear, the levy would be expected to train at least once a month. Moreover, the Church granted its some of its lands to knights or retained the knights on the land when it was willed or granted to meet their responsibilities to serve the king or lord. The Gift should have also sustained bannermen and men-at-arms that the Night's Watch could call to arms as needed. If there were wildlings in numbers inside the Wall, the bannermen and men-at-arms would be responsible for local defense and call the levy to arms while the local populace would retire inside a nearby hill fort or castle. Others would garrison the castles along the Wall as an augmentation to the Watch. I think this is an area that GRRM did not explore or research very much, but he's a fantasy writer, not a military historian and his concentration, rightfully, should be on the story, though some more thought should have gone into the Gift and what that meant for the Watch.

Here's what I think - 
North - Starks under Jon snow followed by either Sansa or bran 
Vale - I have a strong feeling robin arryn will die and house baelish will replace house arryn as the lord paramounts of the vale but if baelish ends up dying then it'll be that hardyng guy 
Stormlands - Baratheon under gendry who I feel will be legitimised 
Dorne - unpredictable since we don't know many of the houses that swore fealty to the martell house but if the sand snakes die and Quentyn (bad with spellings) doesn't exist then maybe it'll go to house dayne of starfall because they're Pretty much the second house we know in dorne in the show and in the books they have a pretty good position in dorne 
Westerlands - Lannister name under tyrion or maybe Jaime but I prefer tyrion
The reach - I feel that since the two older brothers got merged into loras the male line has exhausted and we didn't really see any of the Tyrell cousins yet and presumably many Tyrell's died in KL in the sept I think house tarly will end up ruling the reach from horn hill itself 
Riverlands - I think the riverlands should go to the house mallister of seagard because of their role in preventing many iron men from entering the mainland of the continent and them being loyal to the tullys. In the show Jason is alive and well at seagard unlike the books so I think it makes perfect sense because after the lannisters have lost their power the freys will too and they are already lacking a head now that walder and his two most trusted sons are dead.

I'll freely admit it looks rough with the paper mache base and you can certainly get better 3D printed from etsy, but I'm not about paying that much. I'm pretty aware of all the flaws so hopefully if/when I attempt to make it a few more times, they'll improve. I thought I'd post it anyway if any of you guys are starving for GoT and something to do in the meanwhile. It was still a lot of fun and chewed up a day.





Materials were all Hobbycraft:





Mod Podge Matte, Designer Mask 21.6 cm, Daler Rowney Gold Taklon Short Handled Synthetic Brushes 7 Pack (You don't need these, any old brush will do but I thought I'd recommend them because damn these are pretty good quality for reasonable price), Masking Tape, DecoArt Crafter's Acrylic Black Paint 59 ml and overall colour paint: Antique Gold Art Acrylic Paint Tube 75 ml, and optional DecoArt Dazzling Metallics Venetian Gold Elegant Finish Paint 59 ml which I didn't actually use that much so I almost left it off the list, and ofc paper/leaflets for the mache.






Black yarn is good for the bit around the mask (I'd advise it over laces, it's softer and easier to pull through the holes you have to painstakingly puncture if you don't have any suitable tools) all I need to do is find some material to attach to the back to cover the hair and complete it, but it's pretty much done otherwise. 




EDIT: Had to submit as text post because imgur mobile apparently doesn't like adding text under photos despite it saying ""add description,"" RIP


EDIT 2: A bit of black water colour around the eye creates that really nice gothic effect, acrylic wont smudge well for this effect on this paper mache surface but water colour will. See [Here](http://imgur.com/a/Icvtn)",3,14,False,self,,,,,

I think he's an amazing character; strong, honourable, trustworthy, and leads by example. I was thrilled when I saw him declared King in the North, but I can't possibly see how it will end well for him. Consider these four points:

1. As far as most of the realm is concerned, he's a man of the Night's Watch. Early in the series when he though about deserting to join Robb's cause, (especially in the books) he has second thoughts because he knows as soon as someone sees him in black they'll kill him for deserting. How is that any different now? I imagine he'll have a tough time convincing the commonfolk/lesser houses that he was killed and therefore freed from his vows. 

2. He's a bastard. This one seems obvious, but I still don't think it can be understated. The traditions and formalities of Westeros are something that make up the core premise of the series. I don't see how Jon Snow can command the support of the masses if he has no real claim to the North. Especially once you consider that Sansa is still alive.

3. He doesn't know how to play the game of thrones. Cersei, Dany, the Tyrells, and whomever else have spent the last 6 seasons of this show playing high stakes politics in King's Landing (Dany has Tyrion with her now, who is imo the best political mind in Westeros, so for that reason I'm not putting her in the same boat as Jon here, even though she's been isolated too). Jon has been at the Wall soing nothing but worrying about the Others. How is he going to compete with the cunning of the Lannisters (Cersei in particular)?

4. And lastly, well, Littlefinger. He is the posterchild of men not to be trusted. He killed Ned and who knows how many others. He started from nothing and he has limitless ambition. In fact he literally said to Sansa that his goal is to end up on the Iron Throne. I think that conversation alone constitutes treason against the new king in the North. The man makes me nervous, and I'm worried Sansa and Jon will fall for his tricks. 

I really want Jon to succeed, but I just don't see it happening. Perhaps if he can align with Dany or Jaime (if Jaime ends up turning on Cersei) there could be a way, but that seems too far-fetched for GRRM's style. Would love to hear everyone's input on this. ",25,10,False,self,,,,,

[MAIN SPOILERS BELOW] 



It's never made 100% without question that kings blood has power, but there are many times where the Red Woman uses kings blood to achieve something. It almost always works, to an extent, but the show portrays this in a way that it could be coincidences The closest the show gives to proof of the power is the shadow baby.

So if kings blood has such strong power, my question is why?

Having the blood of the first men makes some sense as they played *the* vital role in history, along with some being turned into White Walkers. At least it would make sense if that's what they went after, but it's all about that sweet sweet kings blood and, seemingly, nothing more. This confuses me for two reasons. One, I'm slow. Two, the king of ""titles titles"" is just some bloke who seized the throne by force. Had there been a line of succession stemming from the first men or [insert vital blood bags I'm forgetting], I'd have an easier time understanding the importance of king's blood.

If anyone can shed some light as to the importance of king's blood, I would very much appreciate it.",25,5,False,self,,,,,

LSH is revived through sacrifice, but not of a king or anyone with king's blood.  Lord Varys was used in blood magic when he was younger, and he's not a king either.  

The Red Woman has misinterpreted things before.  I theorize that there's no more magic in King's blood than in anybody else's.  In a world of magic, everybody has power in them.  Sacrafices, blood magic, even bringing people back from the dead is possible.  But it's not because of any relation to a king, it's based on a person's innate value themselves.",45,45,False,self,,,,,

However they spare one, as he is seen almost surrendering to them. A similar scenario happens with Sam in season 2 episode ten, when the horn blasts three times, and Sam hides behind the rock. Some people think the white walker didn't see sam and that's why he didn't attack him, but I definitely think he did. However, similar to the spared ranger, Sam is seen as surrendering to the white walker, as he is terrified. So any ideas on why they do this? Is it to send a message? Do they have a code?

Raise is a peculiar term to use when talking construction.

Always loved the medieval setting - always have been a history buff, adored reading about how the lives of peasants or lords or what have you went hundreds of years ago... Always liked the fantasy images that crop up, lords and ladies, but as I grew I came to mix my love of history and adoration of fiction / fantasy together...  Fast forward to now, been playing Crusader Kings 2 for a few years, love the narrative I create with the outcomes that occur in that game (seriously, it's all mechanics beneath the game, but it's startlingly easy to build narrative despite that niggling ""it's all faaake"" in the back of one's mind. Highly recommend.) 

Found reddit... Found people talking about how CK2 is ""Game of Thrones: The game"". Saw the popularity boom, heard about the general synopsis, always wanted to read / get into the show.

Got the prequel book - ""The Knight of the Seven Kingdoms"" for Christmas. Just got the leather-bound set yesterday...

I want to watch the show *and* read the books at the same time, pace wise. A friend had told me that the books are apparently relatively... Blunt in terms of delivery and how Martin sets the pace of the narrative and descriptions? At least in the first few books?

The series seasons are based on the book series as well, correct? Season 1 is book 1, 2 is book 2, etc...

But does anyone have any tips or know of any guides that I can use to read and watch at the same time, without overextending how far I go with one medium? IE some guide saying... ""read up to chapter _, then watch up to episode _"" 

Or, in general really, tips on how to go about reading and watching the show to get the most enjoyment out of it. What to expect, faults and pros of both mediums, how to properly balance my excitement and this hyped perception with reality from literal years of the fandom talking about it....

Thanks! (also, LOVE the subreddit - how it's set up and the professionalism and dedication of the mods, and the love of the community... Beautiful.)",7,1,False,self,,,,,

I'm pretty sure it's stated in the later episodes that 1 dragon egg is very expensive. I don't recall its exact value but as far as i recall it can buy an army and ships enough to conquer Westeros.

So here's the thing. Why did Illyrio gave it to Dany? Sure it's a gift. Sure he's a Targaryen loyalist but he doesn't know Dany can give birth to dragons. It's a better move for him to sell it and be rich. I don't think he has intentions to be a ruler so him not being a Targaryen doesn't hinder him from being powerful.

Viserys said Illyrio is smart enough to have an investment on him given the premise of him (Viserys) getting the crown back and Illyrio receiving something in return from it. The odds doesn't favor Viserys' victory if you ask me.

The last time we heard about Illyrio is him lending his place to his friend Varys and Tyrion. I don't even think he met have intentions of meeting Dany any time soon. Varys didn't even mention him to Dany. So the return-of-investment thing is far from true. What's his intentions?

Also, where the hell did he get it? If it's from Asshai, it's pretty much a precious item and a lot would be interested in it.

While personally I am new to Reddit, I have always loved theory crafting on Game of Thrones. I enjoy every aspect of the show and I've rewatched it two-three times in every offseason. I've poured through the books and studied every detail I could about the great world that contains Westeros and Essos.

Upon my second rewatch, I thought about the idea of Cersei becoming queen. While everyone was wondering about who the rightful heir should be, she just took the fucking throne. 

This made me think about every theory I've made. I've realized that theories don't need to make perfect sense. Just because one thing should happen logistically, it doesn't mean that it actually will. 

I always thought that Gendry would have to be the heir as no pure Baratheons existed anymore. I think I saw something in TWOIAF about a bastard Targaryen becoming king, although I believe he was legitimized. Either way, Gendry was the closest thing to a potential heir that could've been made king, and yet Cersei just took the throne. In the moment, this made sense, and I couldn't understand why I ever thought that wouldn't happen as I knew Cersei would erupt the caches of wildfire left by Aerys under King's Landing. 

Have we been going about creating theories wrong? Should every theory make exact sense? I feel like the details we get hooked up on get in the way of our individual understanding of where the narrative may lead. Or I'm just going insane during this offseason.

I am wondering what the best way to break off areas would be, and what points to apply to each area. I can't just rip off the vanilla versions from Risk because there will be new sea routes that are game-changing to those original versions.

Of the characters who aren't in the spotlight as often, who would you say has the most tragic story/character arc? My vote is for Ser Dontos of House Hollard. Yeah sure, when we see him in the books, he's a drunken idiot who get turned into Joffreys fool, but good god does the man have a good reason for it. His entire family was wiped out due to the part they played in the Defiance of Duskendale. The only reason he is still alive is because Barristan the Bold told the king to spare him. Then he gets his  knighthood stripped away in front of the entire court of Kings Landing and gets turned into a fool. For a bit of slight redemption, he plays the part of Sansa's savior and what does he get in return? Littlefinger orders his men to fill him full of crossbow bolts. Granted, he did it all for gold but I men come on. Sure he might have sold out Sansa at some point but good lord, what a way to go out. Dontos might have been a drunken idiot, but the guy had a pretty shitty life. So, as I stated earlier, who do you guys think is the most tragic secondary character?

Tell me what you guys think!

Soon after Dany and co arrive in King's Landing, there's a power struggle for the throne. Cersei goes overboard, Jaime can't take her actions anymore, and Cersei dies by his hand. Jaime then joins up with Tyrion, Dany, and the rest of her camp. 

Meanwhile, Jon Snow descends upon King's Landing in search of help against the White Walkers. He goes to Dany for help, and the two of them fall in love. He becomes legitimized as either a Stark or Targaryen (he's definitely a Targaryen, but might still get legitimized as a Stark). They realize the Iron Throne is made up of Valyren steel and handy dandily for them, Gendry the blacksmith has arrived back in town and he melts it down to make swords to fight the WW. 

Then, they go to war with the WW, and, at this point or quickly thereafter, the only dragon left becomes Drogon. Drogon wrecks shit, maybe with the help of Bran's mind powers, who knows, becomes Dany's prophesized ""stallion that mounts the world,"" but even he, too, dies by the end. 

Meanwhile, during the fray at Winterfell, Jon is reluctantly forced to kill Dany in a major dramatic scene which breaks his heart, but he knows he has no other choice because he's the hero, Winterfell is the lightbringer, and the hero must bind his love to lightbringer in order to defeat the WW.

Eventually the battle ends, Jon and co defeat the White Walkers, and the duty of ruling of King's Landing falls upon him. Jon, however, does not want to be King of the Seven Kingdoms, and instead chooses to legitimize Gendry after its come out he's the last Baratheon and rightful heir, and Gendry assumes rule of the Seven Kingdoms, with his wife Arya Stark by his side. Confident in Gendry, Arya, and Gendry's hand, Tyrion, and their ability to rule the 7 Kingdoms, Jon returns home to the North, where he continues to rule as their King.

For those who don't know it: Azor Ahai forget his great sword ""Lightbringer"" and drove it to his life's heart in order to combine it with her soul and make it stronger.
If we assume that the story will continue relatively close to what is currently introduced and expected in the show, maybe some kind of romance is indeed possible between Jon and Daenerys. Her sacrifice seem logical to me and somehow confirms GRRM's promise for a bittersweet ending. I guess she won't be exactly killed by Jon, but some kind of sacrifice will happen. That will also ensure her vital role in the war against the Night King.

She said, ""Our fates are joined. Together we murdered a king. If my house should fall I have nothing to hide""

Well, by the end of the last season her Son, granddaughter and grandson were killed. Potentially some other lesser Tyrell and associates that were present in the Septum.

This is a lady that has nothing to lose, now and out for vengeance. Frankly, I think her part in Joffrey's murder is pretty small compared to what Cersei did. With good PR it could even be seen as justified.

Now that she's allied herself with Varys, I do wonder if her threat to Little Finger will play out?

Surely, this info will be valuable for Varys to use against Little Finger?

Now that I think of it, it looks like Little Finger brought his dagger in that scene. Maybe he planned on killing Olenna up until she said if she were to be harmed ""they'll never even find what's left of you.""",178,608,False,self,,,,,

One of them is about Tommen and I'm wondering if I'm correct about this. 

Firstly, his character has been played by two different actors since the series began, correct? I believe his character was changed to a different actor around the time of Goffreys death. I recall his face during the scene where he and Cersi sat on the Iron throne during the battle of Blackwater. He looked different than he does now.

My second observation was that I thought the actor who now plays Tommen was actually already in the series in an earlier season. Am I right about that? It would have been during season 3 I believe. Two young Lannister boys were captured by one of Rob Starks men. Robs wife was telling them stories of how Rob turned into a wolf during the night.

This is what I want to happen, and I'm going to tie off as many loose ends as possible. Again, this more what I want to happen than what I think will happen: 

Arya goes to Winterfell and meets up with Jon and Sansa. Sansa agrees to kill Littlefinger with Arya's help, but he flees. Jon leads his army to Riverrun to reconquer it and they meet up with Brienne and the Hound, who reluctantly joins Jon's forces after persuasion from Davos. 

Cersei wants Jaime to go back to Riverrun and defend it. He refuses. She ends up sending the Mountain, thinking that only he can stop Jon's growing army (he kinda absorbed the Vale's army, and young Robin agreed to help ""liberate"" his uncle Edmure; the Fray's are a lot weaker without their father and easily roll over). She also thinks that she'll be safe with Jaime around and fear instilled in all of King's Landing.

Enter Clegane bowl. Unfortunately, the Hound loses, but the Mountain is killed by Brienne. Jon wins Riverrun, with the help of Melissandre. His quest for dragonglass now begins and he looks to Dragonstone next. 

Meanwhile as Dany and her army are at the steps of King's Landing, Jaime tries convincing Cersei to abandon and the city and run off with him. Live as commoners wherever they can. She refuses and demands he assembles the military to defeat Dany which he knows is an impossibility. Realizing that Cersei is lost to him, he kills her and then himself, much to the dismay of Oleanna and the sand snakes who wanted to kill her themselves. 

Internal quarrels between the sand snakes, Tyrion, Dothraki and what to do with Jon leads Dany to kill the sand snakes (fuck them) with the aid of Bronn and reprimand the Dothraki for pillaging. Theon meets with Jon and accepts responsibility for the fall of Winterfell. Jon forgives him and agrees to fight Euron with Theon and Asha if Dany and them all promise to help fend off the White Walkers. They defeat him with a Krakon or two involved, and Davos' skill at sea is important here. He feels redeemed at last for losing at Blackwater Bay.  

They go to Dragonstone and get as much dragonglass as possible to fight off the walkers and start building their forces and friendships. Some romantic tinglings between Dany and Jon begin. They meet a certain blacksmith who has been in hiding awhile. Jorah gets a cure for greyscale from Sam. Meanwhile, Bran sees that Sansa and Arya are alive at Winterfell. He tries to meet up with them but ends up bringing down the wall...

As Ed and the Night's Watch are destroyed, everyone meets up at Winterfell, a grand reunion of sorts. Bran convinces Dany and Jon to imprison Theon. Bran reveals Jon to be Dany's nephew which kinda halts their romantic advances. Howland Reed comes to confirm this and help fight off the walkers, along with Benjen. Gendey and Arya are happily reunited. Sam comes and reveals some awesome history and how to break their magic of creating wights and other magical magic things. Awkward but wonderful Brienne and Tormund gazing also ensues. 

They engage in battle with Bran warging a dragon, Dany riding one, and Tyrion riding one. A whole host of good 'ole characters die in the battle, including Brienne, Tormund, Asha, and a ton of minor characters. The good guys realize they are losing.

One piece of info Sam reveals only to Jon and Davos is how he can create a sword to defeat the white walkers - he has to kill Dany. Jon refuses until Melissandre convinces him it is the only way to win. In this confrontation, with the Valyrian steel sword Oathkeeper, recovered from Brienne, Jon accidentally kills the Imp instead. Dany, unable to kill Jon or else lose his army in the fight, sends him and his army to march on the white walker army to buy the rest of them time.

Jon survives (of course), but is separated from the fighting and ends up north with Davos and Theon. With help from Bran, he meets up with the Children of the Forest where he seeks redemption for killing Tyrion and failing to save the realm. 

The Walkers push on Winterfell. Dany comes to the realization that all she has done since she was born is try to take her homeland back, irregardless if the people want that or not. Now her kingdom (queendom?) is on the verge of collapse. She launches a final defense against the walkers, losing two dragons, except Drogon who flies from the battle with her. Theon, btw is freed and guards the Starks hiding in the crypts.

Bran, hiding in the crypts with Arya, Sam, and Sansa, realizes who Azzor Azhai is, and its not Jon, its Davos. In order to save the realm, Davos must bring forth Lightbringer by killing Jon. Davos doesn't believe this to be true, though the Children tell him this and Bran communicates this as well, with much conflict seeing as it would mean Jon dying. In order to bring himself to do it, Davos has a revelation and finally believes in the Lord of the Light. But before he kills Jon, his sword becomes Lightbringer. This is an allegory to Abraham being asked to kill Isaac. So they march into battle again, being flown there by Dany and Drogon. Jon tragically dies defending the entrance to the crypts at Winterfell. Drogon also dies, but takes out a large massive amount of walkers and wights with him. Jorah saves Dany but eventually they agree this is their last fight, and Dany apologizes for not lovig Jorah sooner. Davos however, with help from Thein and Arya waterdancing, finally defeat the white walkers. Bran and the children of the forest rebuild the wall and plan on starting up the Nights Watch again, with Theon volunteering to lead it. 

Littlefinger meets with Varys who is de facto ruling at King's Landing, seeking power, having been disgraced at Winterfell. With considerable difficulty governing the city, Varys appoints Littlefinger to a positon of power, remembering fondly their spy games at court previously. However, Arya has learned from Varys the role Littlefinger played in Ned's death and forces him to admit it to her and Sansa. Sansa then kills him. It is implied that Varys foresaw this outcome and welcomed it. Varys, realizing that the people will not be happy without a true king on the throne, Gendry is placed as king of the six southron kingdoms and it is hinted that she and Arya will marry.

Bran becomes King of The North. Sansa realizes that she never wanted to be queen and have kingly sons after all and becomes content in a simple life. Davos returns to his wife wherever she may be. At the end it is revealed that Dany and Jorah survived the battle and escaped the seven kingdoms. They now live as a nomadic couple in Essos.
