That is why I believe to know how the show might end. So this theory will focus on Jon Snow and should be taken lightly as I am a casual fan with an idea that seems fitting for the show.

I believe Jon Snow, the secret targeryan, will survive the end of series and Dany will not but there's more to it then that.

Jon Snow as of the past couple of seasons has really  been throwing himself out into harms way almost to the point of death multiple times. So wouldn't it be ironic for him to just not die. Jon's one goal, his true purpose, is to defeat the white walkers and he has constantly gone out of his way to display the sacrifice he is willing to make for the great or good. So it would be against our expectations to have him kill the night king or something like that and live. We wouldn't  expect that at all because the show has constantly shown us that happy endings don't exist in this world but to give a happy ending would go against everything we have come to expect from the series as a whole.

So, George RR Martin has said the series will have a bitter sweet ending so Jon can have a ""happy"" ending but someone's gonna have to take the bullet to make it a bittersweet ending. That's where Dany comes in.

Dany has one goal since the start of the series. She wants to rule and for 7 seasons she has but, she wants to rule all of westeros. And I've already established that the series is ironic so, wouldn't Danny not getting what she wants truely be a slap in the face. I mean for the most part I've been rooting for her to be Queen of the 7 kingdoms since the start but, the show has constantly shown us that she isn't a ruler but a to conqueror. I see her as a Robert Baratheon type character in the sense that she is a person people can rally behind but a person that can't actually rule. 

So how would the end play out? I believe Jon will win the great war but many will fall for the great or good but before this final couple of battles take place we learn that Dany is pregnant with Jon's child and at the end of the war when everything is cooling down is gives birth to her child and dies.

I called this theory The Mirror End theory for certain reason, poetry. You know who likes thing to be poetic Samw... I mean George RR Martin. Why mention this? Well because the end of the series will mirror another war's end, Roberts Rebellion. So at the end of that war Ned Stark reunites with his sister Lyanna who has gave birth to baby Aegon Targeryan (Jon snow). Lyanna dies and Ned takes the baby with him, changes his name to Jon Snow, and raises him as his own. 

Now the final ending prediction that I believe will come true. So Dany is pregnant with Jon's child and has taken the iron thrown. Jon has won the war and is meeting up with Dany to witness his child's birth. When he arrives he Dany's child is born but Dany isn't doing so well she ultimately dies like Lyanna did so many years ago. Motherless now, Jon takes his baby and raises it just like his father\uncle Ned. Jon doesn't want to rule but the people choose him to rule because he lead them to victory. For any of you who have learned about US history  this should sound alot like George Washington who also didn't want to rule but ended up ruling anyway. In this new world Dany is dead but her goal of breaking the wheel is accomplished. Jon is the first democratic ruler of the 7 kingdoms. Samwell Tarley and Tryion are at his side helping create this new world. 

I want to note that Dany does not have to die in childbirth in order for these theory to work but, she has to die after their child is born. The way she goes could happen in many ways she can die in a sacrifice  to make lightbringer. The main point is that after the war Jon comes home with a motherless baby after the war like Ned did with Jon completing the circle.",19,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

 So I think similar to season 7 Jon will need someone to go up to Castle Black (for whatever the reason) and Jorah will volunteer like he did to go capture one of the dead. Jorah will do this because of the hurt he's feeling over Daenerys and the fact his father served there as Lord Commander. 
Before leaving Sam will give Heartsbane to Jorah for his travels as the army has obviously broken pass the wall. 
When Jorah arrives he will probably be greeted by Beric and Tormund who fled there after what happened at East Watch. 
 During Jorah's time there he will become Lord Commander like his father before him. So my guess is Ed will be killed and the only other notable characters at Castle Black will be Jorah, Beric and Tormund. So I think naturally the next person to lead them will be Jorah for the sake of poetic effect. Plus he would have come there under the orders of Jon which will make them listen to him. I also like the fact that Tormund would hate Jorah being the Lord Commander after he stated his hate for Jorah's father last season. 
Now I also think Jorah may leave his oath to Daenerys behind him. Because I'm thinking he'll be struck with the revelation of the end of the world and that he will never get to be with Daenerys. Finally that will hint that HIS story is almost over. 
 BUT he will take the vows of the Nights Watch like his fathers dying wish and betray his oath to Dany. Not that he stops loving her or anything but he's finally grown as a character to see the big picture. 
Anyway in short Jorah will be the 1000th Lord Commander and my guess is he may actually be the one to save Jon in a battle against the Night King and sacrifice himself to kill him. Earning his redemption for the North. 
 Would that mean he's Azor Ahai... Well I don't think so. It only says Azor Ahai lead the world against the White Walkers. Doesn't really say anything about killing the Night King. So I'm thinking that part is up for grabs to any character and my prediction is Jorah.

Plot points where rushed; House Martell's story was butchered even further, Yuron built hundreds of fucking ships seemingly within a month. Suddenly Littlefinger is dumb as bricks playing scooby doo with the Stark children. The wight mission was just the dumbest, most idiotic idea ever. And even if they were to make it they could have at least decreased the level of plot armor by sending fewer characters, thereby increasing the uneasy feeling that in GoT, no one is ever safe.

Having said that, we all know they work best when having a model to adapt from. So which popular sitcom style would be best? Here are a couple of choices:

## **Arrested Development:**
Large cast of a family? Check. Cold, selfish characters? Check. Room for some brilliant narration style fun? Absolutely. Who wouldn't love to hear Ron Howard telling us ""Brienne continued to tell everyone she had absolutely no interest in a ginger-haired wilding. This was a lie.""
Perhaps we could even have a season 4 style 'Every character gets an episode type thing.' (I believe this is know in some circles as POV. Apparently.)


## **Scrubs**
Let's have some JD style-narration. Instead of his happy-go-lucky version, we can have Jon Snow (now named JS to his friends) having broody, imagine-what-could-go-wrong daydreams. Sandor Clegane is Dr Cox, Dany is Eliot which makes Turk......Davos? Tyrion? Who knows. 
(Considering how Scrubs final season went, this may be a bad idea)

## **How I met your mother**
""Kids, settle down. This is the story of how we beat the Night King. And why you also have to call your mother 'Great Aunt Daenerys'""
Reverse timeline, lets go. Podrick is Barney.

## **The Office/Parks and Rec/Modern Family** 
Documentary/constant interview style. Personally I look forward to Cersei interviews of her simply sneering, and Varys doing Jim-style side-smiles to the camera.

## **Any laugh-track sitcom.**
This is GoT though, so the laugh-track is replaced by the screams of the smallfolk whenever one of these lords or ladies makes a fateful decision.


Let me know any of your ideas!

Not sure if this was picked up before, but I noticed this scene on rewatch which possibly points to where Cersei got her idea to blow up the Sept.
From 6x02, Tommen visits Cersei at the Red Keep after disallowing her to attend Myrcella's funeral.


Tommen: I should have executed all of them. I should have pulled down the Sept on to the High Sparrow's head before I let them do that to you, as you would have for me. You raised me to be strong... and I wasn't. But I want to be. Help me.

Cersei: Always.

Part of the oath goes ""I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post"". I think this has significance to Jons character because he in fact is doing some of these things. 

""I shall hold no lands"" - He holds Winterfell in the North

""I shall wear no crowns"" - He is the King in the North

""and win no glory"" - He is glorified for defeating Ramsey Bolton in the battle of the bastards

""I shall live and die at my post"" - He lived, was killed, but then lived again

I think this has significance because he has yet to take a wife or father any children. I think this will happen in Season 8 with Daenerys and he will have officially done the opposite of everything he swore he wouldnt do. His watch did end after he died though so he is in the clear for me.

Edit: I realize he died and the pact no longer is in effect. My point is that now all the things he doing are the things he couldnt do in the nights watch. Not that its bad, just that we can predict more of what Jon will do in the next season. ",83,246,False,spoiler,,,,,

The moment the NK and Jon look into each others eyes.

Jon's eyes open wide, he turns around yelling ""Go! Go! Flee!"". 

Jon senses correctly what the NKs next target will be. 

No dragon. 

Not Jon. 

But Daenerys.

Btw, did anyone spot this? One of the WW's has a different hairstyle now. He is wearing a braid. Stop/repeat slowly at 6:11/6:12

Another strange thing/thought. I am currently rewatching Season3. The scene when Samwell kills a WW. 

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfdHNjbYHU

The Crows! Sent by Blood Raven to alarm Sam and Gilly? Or.. sent by the NK to find Sam and Gilly?

And another thing i just spotted. The way Beric enlightens his sword after the death of Thoros. No more blood needed, the wights hit by the sword fall down quite fast.

The Northerners probably won't react too well to finding out that Jon bent the knee to Dany, especially if they realize he's also in love with her. So it would probably be in his best interest to keep quiet about it but we all know that Jon is very truthful and honest and even discloses details when they don't need to be told (telling about sleeping with Ygritte).

Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade.

I dream of the voice from the flames!

Was it a god? A demon? A conjuror's trick? I do not know. But the sorcerer called and the voice answered.

And ever since that day, i have hated magic and all those who practice it. And you can see why i was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis and his red priestess. A symbolic revenge of sorts.""

Later then he replies ""But influence is largely a matter of patience, i have found"" --&gt; Tyrion has become quiet and quite patient in season7.

""The contents of a man's letters are worth more than the contents of his purse"" --&gt; mind the letters and their content in season7, Tyrion to Jon, Jon to Sansa. You can find these letters on GoT's twitter.

He then shows Tyrion the male prisoner inside his box. Either this indeed is the sorcerer. Or it is the mummer who sold Varys to the sorcerer. Varys does not respond to Tyrion's guessing. 

So. The seek for revenge of Varys may or may not be over now. 

If it was a sorceress, Melisandre perhaps. Or even the high priestess of Rhllor. 

How does Varys look at Dany's rebirth then? Or at Jon's? Victims of magic or practicing magic? How does he look at the dragons?

Thoughts?

While those are good theories I have may own theory and that is Jaime is Azor Ahai now I know you have all heard this already yes but this is different.

My theory is that Jaime is Azor Ahai but AA and PTWP are two different people with Jon and Dany's child being the Prince that was Promised. Now I believe that The Prince that was Promised was misinterpreted and that The Prince that was Promised will not save the world from the white walkers but will save it from destroying itself and he will create change in the world. Perhaps destroy the throne and install Democracy bringing a Dream of Spring. 

Azor Ahai will be the Samwise to his Frodo in the sense he will be the one to have to destroy the White walkers. Now what evidence to I have for Jaime being Azor Ahai.

- First if the theory of him being a Targaryen is true then he has the blood.

- He was most likely under the Red Comet so that would be the red star bleeding (could also refer to the Sept being destroyed)

- Born admits Salt and Smoke can refer to multiple things. It could refer to the Bath tub scene where there was smoke from the steam and the salt being the salty water of the tub or Jaime's salty tears, Could refer to when he returned to KL after the sept was destroyed where there was smoke and maybe salty tears or the salt from black water bay, or maybe in the field of fire, whatever you think any of those could be it.

- Lightbringer would be his sword

- Cersei his Nissa Nissa

- If he finds out who he is he would be awakening the dragon within him.

Now yes this does sound crazy but I do think it would be a cool twist if Jaime was Azor Ahai (and also if the PTWP and AA were not the same person and Jon and Dany's child was the PTWP)",15,7,False,spoiler,,,,,

Lets Talk About Jon Snow,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/73t2xe/main_spoilers_book_show_comparison_lets_talk/,russomd,1506954441,We all know that the book and TV show are totally separate stories. In the Book we have Little Griff (Aegon Targaryen) the Son of Rhaegar and Elia. Little Griff was never in the show. In the show Jon Snow is revealed as Aegon Targaryen the son of Rhaegar and Lyanna. I really question if they are just having Jon take over Little Griffs storyline as Aegon. Will Jon snow be resurrected in the Winds of Winter or was that something made up on the show? Would Rhaegar have named both of his sons Aegon? Paradox isn't the right word to use but it just doesn't add up. We won't know until Winds of Winter. Tell me what you think?,18,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

In other words, our knowledge of them is too limited since primary sources (the books and the show) provides too little (or not enough) info of them. The tale of the Three Thousand of Qohor is a classic example. 

&amp;nbsp;
    
According to Ser Jora Mormont, a troop of 3 thousand Unsullied successfully defended Qohor against twenty-five thousand Dothraki Warriors led by Khal Temmo. The Dothraki could have outflanked such a small force, but the Dothraki riders launched a direct frontal assault instead (eighteen Dothraki charges and three attacks by Dothraki archers), which resulted in more than twelve thousand Dothraki fighters being killed. And all of these happened more than 4 hundred years ago. 

&amp;nbsp;

Then what can the tale tell us about the Dothraki vs the Lannister combat in the show (Season 07)? Are the Dothraki warriors led by Daenerys just as much arrogant, reckless and unsophisticated as they were 400 years ago? It's not clear. And what about combat formation of the Unsullied troop at the time? Their battle line was spread out as thin (only 2~4 layers deep) and long as the Lannister troop was in the show? Or the Unsullied troop's battle formation was in phalanx? It's not so clear either. Depending on answers to these questions, we will have different conclusions as to whether the Dothraki could defeat the Lannister army even without Dragons or not. Thus, the best we can do is to admit that we have not enough relevant info of the Dothraki (and Westeros army), and make explicit our own assumptions on these questions.

She's unilaterally declared herself ruler, without the (on-screen) assent of the royal vassals.  She clearly does not abide by the tradition of being advised by a council, other than Qyburn.  She has no claim to the Iron Throne by blood or by marriage (she inherited it from her children, not her spouse).  She's a woman in a system that rarely, if ever, allows women to rule (it's specifically noted that she's the first queen regnant of Westeros). She employs a heretic maester, which should bring the censure of the other maesters.  She destroyed the center of the Westerosi faith, which should lose her the support of the people (as we saw with the Faith Militant, Westeros is a place of strong religious sentiment).  She's shown no ability to defeat, or even curtail, the rebellion against her rule that's taking place.  She's allied herself with a Viking pirate, which should cause at least some trepidation on the part of her mainland supporters.  She's also shown herself to be ruthless towards the heads of families, which is perhaps the greatest sin in a quasi-feudal society that prizes honor above all. 

Given the above, why does Cersei have any loyal vassals remaining? I'm not just talking about the heads of great houses (most of whom are dead or rebels).  I'm talking about the average local lord with 50 or 100 bannermen.  It can't just be that people are afraid of her - Tarly seemed to be a man of tradition and honor, and yet he supported a queen who broke those in every way. She should have little to no support/army, even among Lannister loyalists.

Often, in historical situations like the one GRRM borrowed for GoT (Wars of the Roses), nobles would sit out conflicts like the show's, and offer late support to the winning side. Others would support the legitimate ruling line (Targaryan, in this case).  

Tl;dr Cersei's support makes no logical sense and exists solely because she's the show's main villain (and arguably, main character). ",181,69,False,spoiler,,,,,

It seems to me that a (major?) plot hole exists and I haven't seen discussed (I apologize if it has been my searches we not fruitful). 

Everyone mentions Jon Snow's honor (even Cersi, as a son of Ned Stark). Everyone knows the rules of the Nights Watch. You take a lifetime vow and you forfeit your House, promise to take no wives, etc. Everyone knows Jon joined the Nights Watch. However, not many people know he was killed (in fact, for much of the time he covers this up), thus ending his watch. No one knows his watch has ended, yet no one questions his honor when he has left the Nights Watch and is King of the North. Dany doesn't, Tyrion doesn't, Cersi doesn't (she even goes so far to rely on him keeping his promises as a part of her plans during the negotiations), and so on. 

Why is this? Unless you know what the viewers and only a select few characters know, you should be questioning Jon: ""So what happened to your vows on the wall, how are you now King of the North?""

Many of our favorite characters will die in the Great War causing some bitterness for the ending. Jon and Dany both survive and have a child. Right now, Dany thinks that her greatest desire is the iron throne. At the beginning of the whole story, all she wants is to go home and have a family, she has no intention of ruling. I think that it's clear that when she is with Jon, she is much more vulnerable and softer. With her child and Jon(finally family for her), she'll realize that she actually has no interest on the throne anymore. We also know that Jon has no real interest in ruling. I would like to see the end to Jon and Dany's story being them leaving Westeros with their child to some remote place, not caring about Targaryen restoration or any of that political bullshit. This would be somewhat bitter, because seeing at least one of them on the throne is what a lit of fans want to see, them just walking away from it in the end would give some frustration and make the ending of their story not so ""Disney"" or ""fairytale"" like. I thknk Tyrion and others will be left to pick up the pieces in Westeros, looking to move on from a tyrannical form of government. This ending would be very fulfilling and will leave many satisfied, but the destruction of Westeros, the extinction of many great houses, the deaths of many beloved and possibly innocent people, and just the pure bloodshed of the great war would provide some bitterness and tragedy to the ending of the series. I think that the death of a character like Tyrion, Arya, Jon, or Dany would make the ending of the show too tragic and without much sweetness. If Jon dies and Dany lives, there is no sweetness because Dany would just be lost and devastated without him and left with a fatherless child. The death of Jon would be tragic and the ending of Dany's story would potentially be even more tragic. There's no sweetness in that. If just Dany dies and not Jon; Jon would be potentially left with a motherless child, something that he definitely doesn't want and he would be left without the love of his life. This would be another outcome with no sweetness at all, just bitterness. Jon being alive and in mourning would not be sweet, it would be really sad and depressing. Lastly, if both of them die, obviously that would be very tragic and not sweet at all. This is just my take and opinion on the ending of the show. Obviously others may feel differently about it, and that's completely fine. I just feel that too many think that a shitload of tragedy and death has to happen whereas in reality that shouldn't be the case. We should be able to get an ending that provides just the right amount of joy and fulfillment without coming across as a Disney movie or fairytale where all of the protagonists get happy endings and everything that they desired. Obviously, others may disagree with this ending, and that's ok. Anyone who feels like this is a bad ending or it is too happy, feel free to explain why in the comments.

I find it likely that the old three-eyed raven caused Aerys's craziness. He probably tried to warn him telepathically that an enemy was awakening in the north and he could stop them before they even start their advance. He tried to tell him to burn them to use wildfire, but I am guessing it didn't all quite go through and all Aerys understood was ""enemies""... ""in the north""(the starks)... ""wildfire""...

Edit: The bachelor's button is also known as the Cornflower, Basket flower, Bluebottle, Hurtsickle, and Boutonniere flower. 
In heraldry, it's a Gillyflower. This is one flower that received its flower symbolism during the Crusades and the hayday of heraldry.

The question was ""why did Cersei put the High Sparrow in charge?"".

Quote

If I may answer this question in the form of bad poetry?



Cersei was queenin' and mommin'
As Margaery honed in on Tommen
Though Marge was technically queen
Cers' found her too sly, too obscene

Cast aside as her son was seduced
She fearfully devised her noose:
Empower the faith of the seven
(Annoying her Lord Uncle Kevan)

Now since everyone knew that ol' Loras
Would, say, prefer Boris to Doris
And Marge got caught misbehavin'
When she lied to the sparrow to save 'im

(Breakin the laws is not smartin'
When your world's run by George RR Martin)

Both Tyrells were placed in the care of
The creepy and mute Septa Sheriff
Now Cersei was once again free
To manipulate her son the king

As always, her failings at schemes
Was to think it was consequence-free
She had herself only to blame
As Flea Bottom gawked at her shame

One addendum I'll add to this lesson
Which further explains her aggression
Cers' had her memory jogged
Of her time spent with Maggy the Frog
And she figured ""This smirking slut here
Won't take away all that I hold dear.""

TL;DR
I'll now be terse-y
Change up the verse-y:
Basically, Cersei,
Averse to the curse-y
For the wear, worse-y
Put her son's first-y
In a damn hearse-y",6,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

We know very little about Craster, except that his father was a storm crow who mated with a wildling.   When Aemon meets little Sam, he exclaims how he ""looks just like Aeg did"". Aemon talks to Sam about how he was once young and amorous, and how there was one particular young lady who caught his eye and caused him to break his vow of abstinence. 
 Aemon doesn't know little Sam is Craster's child, but Jon discovers that some of the Night's Watchmen are aware of Craster's arrangement. Could this be because Aemon kept in touch? Craster also lives very close to the wall - because the apple doesn't fall far from the tree?
 The baby we see get converted to a white walker seems immune to the cold. Similar to how Melisandre says ""the Lord of Light keeps me warm"". Targarians are the Lord of Light's chosen people. They have ""the blood of the dragon"", and dragons are ""fire made flesh"".
  Said baby seems comfortable in the white walker's arms - perhaps due to the familial bond they share?
 The walkers have silver hair, and in the books they are described as beautiful and supple. I believe the change in their look for the show was so as not to make their lineage too obvious. If they looked like pale, gaunt versions of Viserys, we'd have caught on right away.
 Another thing we know about Craster is that he is incestuous - another Targarian trait. 
 He has silver hair, though we initially think this is due to his age. Gilly has auburn hair, like many wildlings do, but little Sam's hair is coming in light blonde. Recall that Danni's hair has more yellow in it during season one.
 This is all mere conjecture on my part, but it really starts to add up. 
 If my hypothesis is correct, this means that little Samwell is of royal descent. That makes him a prince. A prince... who was promised... to the Night King. Stands to reason that he could end the Long Night simply by taking up his mantle. The two people who have the best chance of figuring this out are Samwell (the badass researcher who is desperately looking for a way to stop the coming of Winter), and Bran, who is Google incarnate, and who is now hooked up with Sam.
 The rub is that Sam has declared to Gilly that he only wants to prevent the coming of Winter in order to protect Sam and Gilly. He has admitted that he doesn't care about the rest of the world, ""not really"".
 Meanwhile, it must be Bran who convinces Sam to do what must be done. I say this because each Stark sibling has given their dire wolf a name which has predicted their destiny, but thus far, we haven't seen how Bran's choice of the name 'Summer' will play out. We can only assume that Bran will be instrumental in bringing an end to Winter, and in the context of this hypothesis, it stands to reason. 
 What do you guys think?

 Let's start with the Night King's ""convenient chains"".   

  Jon last encountered the Night King at Hardhome. This was the only area North of the wall that was developed enough to become a town. It was a port town with an inlet deep enough for large ships. It was destroyed hundreds of years ago by flames that burned so high that the watchers on the wall thought the sun was rising to the North. 
  
If you watch the opening shot, the camera pans over the painted table map, leading us from Dragonstone (from where our heroes embarked on their journey), up past the wall - the wall is perfectly framed by the fire place, and we symbolically see the flames rising high above the wall. I initially thought perhaps our heroes didn't realize they were at Hardhome, but we see the camera swings Northwest before fading in on our heroes. 

 Although they are not at Hardhome, we can clearly see on the table map that the mountains they traverse are distinctly below sea level. 
 This is important, because it means that unbeknownst to our heroes, the so-called ""lake"" they are on is actually composed of salt water. 
 That is one of the reasons why it takes so long to freeze.

 Another reason it takes so long to freeze is that it is near the ""mountain,  like an arrow head"", which is actually a volcano. 

 We know it is a volcano because

 a) it looks like a volcano,

 b) the description of the destruction of Hardhome is symmetrical with the description of the Doom of Valyria, which we know (from the HBO animatic history of Valyria) was destroyed by a volcano

 c) it accounts for the presence of obsidian (dragon glass) in the area, and

 d) it makes sense as to why this episode, along with the titular scenes from the s5 episode ""Hardhome"" were filmed in Iceland. 

Just like the hot springs in Iceland, the water is likely kept warm by underground lava tubes.

 So the land our heroes are on is indeed ""kissed by fire"", making the Lord of Light's presence strong here. 

 Moreover, each member of Snowcean's 7 is in his own way, ""kissed by fire"". 
 The Hound, Beric, Thoros and Tormund are obvious. Gendry was not so much kissed as he was molested by fire, plus he's a blacksmith, and also, Baratheon's have diluted Targarian blood. 
 Jora likely has Targarian blood too - his family had a Valyrian steel legacy sword. Plus he is faithfully, endlessly devoted to the Mother of Dragons.
 
 Jora, Tormund and Beric each tell Jon something important that resonates with him and helps him to accept his destiny.
 So Jon is essentially on holy ground, surrounded by his apostles. 

When he goes under the water, and we say ""how did he survive that?"", the simple answer is: he didn't.
 
 Jon is reborn a second time. His resurrection is hidden in plain sight. He gasps for air - just like he did when he was resurrected in s6, e1. This time however, it is sneakily hidden by the fact that he is emerging from the icy water. 
  The hilt of Longclaw ""opens it's eyes"", not literally, but symbolically.   There is symmetry with his previous resurrection scene. The pommel is lying face up, like Jon was on that table. There is a dramatic, suspenseful silence. A white wolf opens it's red eyes...

 So Jon is reborn, ""amidst salt and smoke"". 

The ""bleeding star"" of the prophesy is Viserion. 

So what about ""waking dragons from stone""? 

Jon had gone to *Dragonstone*, to get the *Dragon Queen* to *wake up* and see that the only war that matters is between the living and the dead. He halfway convinced her when he showed her the carvings in the *dragon glass* (which is a type of *stone*), but she becomes fully invested after she leaves *Dragonstone* to come and help him.

  If it doesn't go without saying at this point, all the complaints about ""Deus Ex etc..."" can be set aside. Precedent has been established for the divine intervention which saves the day.

 If you think nothing was accomplished here, reflect on the likelihood that the most important prophesy in the realm is now fulfilled.

 Of course, as we know, ""prophesy can be a tricky thing"". 

My main point is that what are perceived by many to be weak plot points are actually well thought out and decisions were made very deliberately. 

 The fact that these clues were hidden so cleverly suggests that we are not looking at a red herring.  



[Edit] *Tried to streamline the wording and paragraph structure. Hope it is an improvement.*

Now in the show there has been a lot of how Hollywood portraits archery in common. Lock - Hold - Release.

Is an archer able to defend against another type of opponent? A knight? More than one knight? Depends on his 
training, but indeed, he is.

* We had this scene [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXNC3Hc0gTo)

Edmure Tully fails. The Blackfish succeeds. He calculates the winds influence. He does not hold, just aims for 
half a second, then releases the arrow. Hit.

* We had this scene [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4049iH6WHxA) at 2:48

What does Ramsay do right? Never hold! One arrow shortly follows the other. Aim and release. But he needs too
much time to grab the next arrow from the quiver.

* Article dealing with the question ""Could Ramsay have actually killed Rickon with a bow that far out?"" 
[See here](https://winteriscoming.net/2016/07/24/could-ramsay-have-actually-killed-rickon-with-a-bow-that-far-out/)

* Now for Arya. See [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4049iH6WHxA)

No holding, short aim, one arrow after the other in short time. No usage of a quiver. Guess she had stuck the arrows 
in the ground before. Anguy, the Archer teaches Arya the principles. Never hold! Never even aim! Will she remember?

* A really trained expert? Well. Insane. Finally, see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEG-ly9tQGk&amp;t=4s)

All members would have their normal weapons (swords and war hammer in Robert's case) that they typically carried and everyone would be healthy and in their primes. The setting would be a flat and pretty normal area of land such as what we saw near the Tower of Joy. The battle would be to death and the winning side would be whoever was left standing in the end. All side stories, relationships, and other random things do not apply. This is simply a fight to the death. No magic, fire, or any other tricks. Both sides will be allowed an hour beforehand to plan their attack/defense but they must all meet face to face and all at once in the same location.

The reason I ask this is to see just how effective and talented the Kings Guard was with all members in their primes and a willingness to collaborate and work with one another against a common threat. I tried to make their foes a mix of skill, speed, and strength in addition to including a member (Jory) that is a capable but otherwise middle of the pack/average type fighter. I made this post as I believe, show viewers and to an extent book readers as well, only receive limited exposure of just how special these members of the Kings Guard truly were. It also gives us an opportunity to explore the other great fighters of Martin's universe and mind.

Despite their great reputation, my money would be on those opposite of Kings Guard due to their 2 on 1 advantage in numbers, willingness to fight dirty, and unique combination of skills. I think another great part of Martin's writing is how he portrays how sometimes stories and legends are better, prettier, or satisfying when they're left as such things. Are these famed warriors such a case?

It's the off season which means it's quiet and time for creative conspires, deep interpretations, and simple but silly crap like this so what do you guys think? Could these men prevent this group of six from entering the royal chambers and defend their king. How would you imagine it going about?",14,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

Im rewatching the whole series since the ending of season 7 and Ive come across some very unusual acting of Tywin whenever he speaks with Tyrion. Of course there is that known quote "" you are no son of mine"" before Tyrion kill him but also a couple other examples come into play. S1E10, Tywin and Tyrion are speaking about how Tyrion will become the Hand of the King in his stead. Towards the end of the conversation, he states ""youre my son."" This phrase keeps coming up, nonstop. Unfortunately i dont have any other particular season/episode examples. Lets take this into perspective: whenever we humans are trying to convince ourselves something thats untruthful, we keep stating that phrase over and over again. In this case, Tywin knows Tyrion is not his son but by restating the ""youre my son"" phrase over and over again, he is trying to manipulate himself into believing it.

For Melisandre to give him his hand back, so he can finally complete his redemption arc by getting another chance of using his skill, but this time to use it in protection of all that is good. 
I just don't see what he is going to accomplish in the north, at the moment he's not a great commander, or a great anything really... but perhaps that's the point i guess, not going because he's got much to offer, but because it's right.

She was so sure of her plan to survive at the end there even though it hinges on her enemies winning. She even threw shade at Jaime even though he had the right idea to not use the unknown when making plans.

 She then makes a logical mistake with regards to the missing dragon. She assumes, correctly, that the dragons are vulnerable but somehow doesn't reach the conclusion that it is the dead that she claims they will beat that are responsible.

 That misfire at the end there really catches the meaning of that description of her for me. She is smart but arrogantly so as to miss major mistakes in her own logic. A flawed thinker with good looking but ultimately bad plans.

 I think she might have connected the dots if Jon had told the crowd about the commanders of the dead and how they have the magic to raise more dead, magic weapons apparently super strength. But the mistake ultimately is in her hands.

What was supposed to be a more brutal and gritty Jack Sparrow turned out to be just another loudmouthed barbarian with shit for brains, boasting about how he will convince Daenerys Targaryen to marry him with the size of his navy and that of his genitals alone.

But along came Season 7 and he suddenly did turn out to be the Euron Greyjoy from the books, only with parts of his omitted brother Victarion fused into his character and sans black hair, blue eyes, an eye patch and purple lips.

So I wondered, did Euron intentionally put up a macho act in front of the Ironborn to win over their easily fooled minds and hearts? Because that's definitely what book Euron would do to such a group of people.",7,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

He falls from the sky and plummets through the Throne Room, just barely managing to twist and shield Dany from the impact as he lands on the Iron Throne and is impaled. Jon lies in the middle of the room, in a pool of his own blood, as the Night King slowly approaches to finally end him. As the Night King reaches Jon, he pulls out and ice dagger and begins to slowly press it into Jon's chest. Just as Jon begins to scream in agony the Night King stops and turns, we see a bloodied Dany has crawled from the Iron Throne and grasped his ankle. The Night Kind tries to kick her hand free but realizes her grip is strong, and hot. Dany squeezes harder, with both hands now, one on each ankle and the Night King bursts into flames. Dany then crawls though to the warm puddle of blood and water to Jon, already weakened from her recent childbirth, she wraps her her arms around Jon and lays her head on his chest. Her eyes flutter closed, never to open again.

The next scene opens with Jon sitting in front of a front of a fire, it is dawn and he can see the snow slowly starting to melt outside his window. He reaches down to a cradle at his fit and picks up a young child, wrapped warmly in a blanket. The child's hair is light with streaks of silver. The child begins to cry, so Jon gently rocks him. Sam enters the room quietly and gently places a large book on a table behind Jon as he sits down. Sam opens to the first page, it is blank, and he grabs a quill with a soft smile. Jon, still rocking his child looks down to him, ""Let me tell you about your mother...""",15,12,False,spoiler,,,,,

For context, Littlefinger basically threatened Cersei with her secret about incest after she showed him that she had done research about him, followed by ""knowledge is power"". Cersei simply had her men apprehend him and told him that ""power is power"", then just let him go and left.

While on the cards Petyr was right and knowledge should allow you to eventually get power, the show has actually proven Cersei right on this one.

- Ramsay played smarter than Jon in the Battle of the Bastards but Jon had a large army march to his aid, so he (&amp; Sansa) won.

- Cersei had less intellect and knowledge that the Sparrows and Margaery, but she had firepower (literally) so she won.

- Dany is often outsmarted and/or imprisoned by her enemies, but being fireproof + having dragons always works to her benefit.

- And of course Littlefinger himself is a fine example. He had all the knowledge, but it couldn't hold a candle to some enhanced teenagers with magical skills (and Sansa I guess, she gave the order after all).

- All 3 main characters who are in a position of power have no particular knowledge while the characters holding all the knowledge and/or wisdom (Varys, Melissandre, Bran etc) don't really have any real power on their hands.

Or maybe the answer's somewhere in the middle and you need a combination of both. After all Dany had Missandei, Davos, Tyrion and Jorah, Cersei had Qyburn and Jon had Sam and Aemon to get the best of both. Thoughts?",53,33,False,spoiler,,,,,

For me the most heart breaking moment of the entire series has still been when the Mountain crushed Oberyn in that trial by combat. It just upsets me on so many levels because Oberyn was easily one of my top 3 favourite characters. I would love to see more of his life in action. I think it would be really sweet to see more of his youth. When he would travel and be the cocky jerk that he was, picking on bigger stronger men all the time. 

Anyway, I dont think this would make a great spinoff for the general public, mainly just for me. But I love the idea of experiencing more Oberyn in all his glory.

I'm not the most artistic or creative person so I always leaned towards something that was easy. I found one that just required buying a styrofoam egg and then painting the heads of wide tacs. So I went to my local art stores in search of these things. I ended up finding tacs that are pretty small, not nice and big... as well as only styrofoam spheres. I bought the sphere and tried shaving it down to an egg but it looks horrible. I don't know where to find an egg shaped one. I was curious if any of you extremely creative people out there had any idea on how a simple pleb like me can find some sort of replacement as a base for the egg shape and what to use to make the scales? I got really excited when I thought how it would be a good gift and now it's just not coming to fruition in any shape or form.


TLDR; I'm pretty much asking all you extremely creative redditors on how to help a simpleton such as myself make a dragon egg, to have any ideas that doesn't include a styrofoam egg because I just can't find one. Thank you very much to anyone who actually helps.",8,6,False,self,,,,,

Given the perspective of Season 7 from 1, honestly I don't think this has fundamentally changed, unlike some of the dramatic evolutions that other prominent characters have undergone. His character has almost always revolved around his family, either in support or opposition. Regardless of what he actually *does*, he almost always has the best lines.

I'm one of those who thinks Tyrion is probably betraying Dany for love of his family. To be honest, I like his character so much I wish on a certain level this wasn't the case, but I'm just seeing too many story elements pointing in that direction to ignore them. I'll detail them below:

**His advice on conquering Westeros**

Tyrion's advice to Dany regarding how to best proceed with her conquest of Westeros both makes complete sense for his character, and is seemingly devoid of sense at the same time. Dany walks into the political situation in which Cersei's position is probably at the weakest it has been since Stannis was at the very gates of King's Landing. The Seven Kingdoms are highly fragmented with their alliance to the crown. With newfound allies in Dorne and the Reach, combined with the forces she brought with her from Essos, she has a force capable of taking King's Landing with almost the might of half the realm as well - almost as a foregone conclusion. Tyrion appeals to Dany's humanitarian side and instead coaches a more convoluted approach (if it succeeded) would slowly strip the remaining allies Cersei possesses away until she has no viable option but to surrender. Tyrion does have a point that this is the 'nicer' option on the surface, but by ignoring the obvious victory and attempting the clever approach allowed Cersei the time to nullify her alliances with Dorne &amp; the Reach and dragged out the war. One notes that the clever and drawn out approach Tyrion used also gave his siblings the maximum time to come to their senses and surrender.

**His clothing choices**

A few more eagle-eyed people on here noted that Tyrion's choice of tailoring started changing over the course of Season 7. The closer he got to the season finale, the closer the clothing started resembling his father, Tywin's old ensemble. 

**The family theme in S7**

The elements of family become very prominent in S7. We have the remaining Starks reuniting in Winterfell. Jon attempts to give Jorah Mormont back his family's Valarian sword, Longclaw. Jorah refuses the offer and tells Jon to keep it, and have it serve him and his children. Dany's children aspect with her dragons is revisited again, and in the finale Jon even brings up Mirri Maz Duur all the way back from S1. He casts some doubt as to the Witch's bias as far as Dany being barren - which seems a possible setup for a pregnancy in S8, or if not that, certainly another bullet point for the family theme.  Given how hard the theme is pushed, I find it probable that Tyrion's character motivation is revolving around his family, as it has for the vast majority of the series.

Even the name for one of the finale music pieces is 'A Lion's Legacy', which might be another clue. Despite the Lannister Sigil covering multiple characters, if my recollection is correct, Tyrion is one of the characters most often referred to as a Lion over the course of the show.

**The Sales Pitch**

Another point that occurs to me is his initial pitch to Dany as her advisor regarding taking the Iron Throne-

""House Targaryen is gone. Not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you. The Starks are gone as well - our two terrible fathers saw to that. The remaining members of House Lannister will never back you - not ever. Stannis Baratheon won't back you either - his entire claim to the throne rests on the illegitimacy of yours. That leaves the Tyrells - not impossible, but not enough.""

At the point of the Season 7 finale, virtually every single one of those predictions is proven wrong, either through ignorance or bad judgement on Tyrion's part. The Starks have regrouped in Winterfell and are in a better position then they have been at any time since the Red Wedding. House Targaryen is proven to have another living member - one Aegon Targaryen who is currently starting a strong relationship with Dany. Stannis was utterly wiped out and is dead and irrelevant. The Tyrells have also been destroyed either by Lannister plotting or their armies, as well as Dornish leadership. Tyrion's advice, while clever, has been ultimately bad. Last but not least, the current Warden of the West - Jaime has abandoned Cersei and is heading North in support of Jon &amp; Dany's alliance.

**Meta Elements**

With Jon Snow becoming ever more important to Dany, his advice and interactions are overshadowing Tyrion's own role as her primary advisor. In a sense, regardless of his intentions, Tyrion is in the way of Jon &amp; Dany's further evolution as a couple and to a degree, romance.

Tyrion's position as Hand is also in a perilous position - he's had very few successes this season to point to as far as Dany retaining him as Hand. 

With everything added together, I see a clear picture of Tyrion making the final call to support Cersei with that 'surprise' pregnancy revelation in the finale and the fact that the audience is deliberately not shown the remainder of the conversation before a scene change occurs. To my mind, this supports Tyrion being the final betrayal of Dany - for love, as supported in one of the book prophecies:

*. . . three heads has the dragon . . .*

*. . . three fires must you light . . . one for life and one for death and one to love . . .*

*. . . three mounts must you ride . . . one to bed and one to dread and one to love . . .*

. . . three treasons will you know . . . once for blood and once for gold and once for love . . . 

 
**An Aside:**

Assuming I am correct with regards to Tyrion switching sides (with good reasons from his perspective...) this leaves Jaime heading north. I wonder if the whole ""Valonqar"" aspect of that looming prophecy could get turned on its head. For some time Jaime has been suspected as being a prime candidate for the person who kills Cersei, given that he is technically a younger brother and would be the less obvious choice. GRRM could have done a double-reverse on us at the end, and have it actually be Tyrion, the obvious choice that Cersei suspected all this time. Jaime is throwing in his lot with the fighters in the North, and is unlikely to be heading South until the fight is resolved - so it is unlikely he would be in a good position to be able to simply get to Cersei absent a major battle.

If Tyrion ends up throwing in with Cersei completely, then I can see a few points that could trigger the Valonqar betrayal. For instance, Tyrion has always coveted the Lannister seat at Casterly Rock. With Jaime absconded, Cersei could name Tyrion Warden of the West, as he's wanted and get some of the recognition he's been denied all his life. He is currently unaware that its value is greatly diminished given the fact that the fabled gold mines have gone dry, and I see no reason for Cersei to tell him that before he is offered it. It would fit her character to both 'reward' him and hurt him at the same time. 

Another possible point is Cersei's pregnancy. The old prophecy by Maggy the Frog, specifies that she will have 3 children:

*... ""Will the king and I have children?"" she asked.*
*""Oh, aye. Six-and-ten for him, and three for you.""*

Given that tidbit, I think Cersei is lying about the pregnancy in order to control her brothers, or has some related medical condition that mimics pregnancy at the least. 

If Tyrion is confronted with the fact that he betrayed Dany for a lie (the pregnancy), and his lordship is a complete sham, I could see him snapping as he did with Tywin.

Some people says that it's Jon and Dany dying and their child surviving, some people saying that it's Jon and Dany surviving but other characters dying or Dany surviving with child and Jon dying, etc. **you got the memo**. From my point of view it's not about actual characters but about whole concept of westeros. Like GRRM pointed out that Tolkien didn't made aftermath which would told us what happened after the Aragorn being crowned. GRRM didn't liked that. I'm talking about actual kingdoms here. The long night is here and great war became. After defeating the NK and Cersei, Jon(aegon) and Dany would became king and the queen but that doesn't makes it even close to the happy ending or disney. The winter will stay. After them being crowned there will be a lot of things. First of them is winter that will mostly be long, cold and hard. Whole westeros will be covered in snow and the horror will rise. Not enough supplies and food will make a deal here. The most of kingdoms are destroyed or empty and there's no more supplies left. The last big one food supply from highgarden was destroyed by Dany. People most likely will start dying due to starvation and cold. Soon enough whole westeros would be emptying out and both Jon and Dany won't do much to help this situation because they simply don't have resources. This is what Jon said to Dany at dragonstone that if they don't do something she will rule over the graveyard. Dany also don't want to be the queen of the ashes. But for me it's way too late. After the war is won the winter will completely destroy westeros and people living in it. The worst scenario will happen which leads dany and jon to be ruling over... yes... a graveyard. This is the bittersweet part of this story. The sweetness part of it is Jon and Dany being king and queen and probably they gonna end up having a child but this is about their people. They will be dying and suffer all over the place and jon and dany can't do nothing to help them. The only thing they can do is to pray to gods for the spring to end up this horror and suffering of their people and there it is... A DREAM OF SPRING. They will be the queen and the king of the ashes and they will rule over the graveyard which they wanted to avoid. The winter will be long... and they will dream for a spring to come in. Bittersweet.

I was hoping to create a discussion for everyone to write about the little-known references that we may not notice when rewatching! 

One of note I found was in season 1 episode 3 ""Lord Snow"" in the scene where Robert Baratheon, Jaime Lannister and Barristan Selmy are in a meeting and all discuss their first kill. Robert states that his was a Tarly boy, a ""dumb high-born lad"" who he struck down with his warhammer. He states, ""They never tell you how they all shit themselves. They don't put that part in the songs. Stupid boy. Now the Tarly's bend the knee like everyone else.""

As we know Cerseis prophesy as told by Maggy says the following

* Maggy let Cersei ask three questions. 
* When will I wed the prince? 
* Maggy responded that she wouldn't marry ""the prince"" but she would marry ""the king"". 
* I will be queen, though?
* Maggy confirmed that she would, but that in time she would be cast down by another, younger and more beautiful queen, who would take all she held dear. 
* Will the king and I have children?
* Maggy cryptically replied that the king would have 20 children, but Cersei would have only three but and that gold would be their crowns - and gold their burial shrouds

So far this has been very accurate, she did marry the king not the prince, she has had 3 children that are dead and all blond and she is the queen for now

What is not said in the shows scene but implied is the following extra bit from the books prophesy:

* And when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you.

Valonqar is High Valyrian for ""little brother"", so it has been though that Jamie or Tyrion will kill her as they are her younger brothers.

There is a deleted scene from season 7 that leaves Cersei waking up in a blood stained bed after Jamie has left, time will tell if its just dropped or pushed back to season 8.

This scene would also fit the TV and book prophesy, the 4th child is never born so she only has 3 children and the death of a 4th child would tip her over the edge in grief and madness.

So Joffrey death x100 level grief which fits And when your tears have drowned you

So we have to address who the Valonqar is.

Tyrion is highly unlikely at this point he is far too far away doing an important and time consuming job being hand to go on a merry little hike to off Cersei

So Jamie then! 

Well maybe but why did we just have him chose moral back bone and honour of his word to leave Kings landing to head north. Its possible the show will engineer a complete 180 and he just walks back in to Kings landing but this doesnt make much sense there is no reason for him to just stop and go back rather than continue north to be honourable. With him possibly becoming Azor Ahai as some very competent theorising on here have covered in the past. 

So we are out of brothers of Cersei who are in a realistic position to fulfil the prophesy **dam!**

Ive seen a lot of discussions/theories regarding Bron  and who his real identity or family might be.

One of these has been that Bron is a long lost and hidden member of house Reyne

It would seem easy to dismiss this as house Reyne was put to the sword man, women and child or it would if we didnt have dead houses of Targaryen and Baratheon suddenly finding long lost true heirs. Courtesy of one of the many YouTube videos it seems in the books it rumoured that a member of house Tarbeck was never accounted for, and the show merges stories due to limited time so Tarbeck could become Reyne.

House Rayne and the rains of Castamere have received **a lot of air time** for a house that plays no part in the show and this show rarely adds anything without meaning.

House Rayne was the smaller vassal house to House Lannister, the younger red lion to the older larger golden lion a brother house if you will.

So could it be Bron? Well he is very driven to become a lord, acquire lands and a castle without ever stating for what end. Is he really a nobody that just wants to pretend, no he has travelled everywhere and has the military skills of a trained high born, lord or knight. 

He may already have full knowledge of the night king and his threat, he has been north of the wall and when it was **bring your Wight to work day** he slopped off like it wasnt the must see event, in recent Kings landing history.

But he has been hanging around with Jamie and Tyrion Lannister!
Like Gendry, **the best place to hide is in plain sight.**

To rebuild a house you need wealth, influence and forces. Just like Daeneryss story line but without the schemers to back it or the marriage that lands you a Dothraki army.

The biggest player with wealth, influence and forces was House Lannister and working for them leads to Bron gaining in all regards, as well as the opportunities for revenge.

He has gained influence and wealth but not the castle or seat of power which he needs to gather forces so he is able to strike down Tywin Lannisters legacy and get revenge for Tywins actions.

Tywin legacy has almost died out in the show, Tywin and Joffrey are dead only Cersei is left. Bron has got the measure of Jamie and Tyrion who are not of Tywins mould but Cersei is a carbon copy, ruthless and evil.

Knowing the danger that the army of the dead pose and looking for a way to get revenge it is possible for him to assassinate Cersei.

A key thing here is he is still at Kings landing. His relationship has been with Jamie and Tyrion and both in a positive way but now they have both gone north yet he has stayed. His interactions with Cersei has not be plain sailing, she arranged and then sabotaged his wedding to Lollys Stokeworth and therefore stopping him getting Castle Stokeworth.

In the S2E1 north remembers when Tyrion talks with Cersei about losing Arya and killing Ned and how it could cost the Lannister their existence, Im sure thats The Rains of Castamere playing.

The Lannisters attempts to kill families off have never fully worked out. The attempts to kill the Targaryen, Baratheon and Starks have failed when they tried. So perhaps they were just as successful with House Reyne.

So their it is, is Valonqar/brother taken in the narrow literal sense or could it be in the wider house sense. There is a contrast in how Lannisters/Reyne and Stark/Karstark have handled what have been family betrayals

But has anyone considered the fact that Winterfell is going to be completely destroyed in S8. Im no expert on the geography of Westeros but with the Night King crossing the wall, Im assuming Castle Black will fall. However, if the NK is just moving south (which I guess is what we are supposed to assume since we dont know his motives?) wouldnt he reach Winterfell fairly quickly? And if he does I dont see them coming up with a way to defeat the NK before he reaches Winterfell. Unless the travel to Winterfell takes much longer than I thought in which case maybe theyll have enough  time to come up with a plan. 

Another thing that somewhat reinforces this theory is the fact that in GRRMs original outline its mentioned that Tyrion burns Winterfell down. Perhaps since thats not happening (anything can happen so its technically possible he still does) GRRM was set on having Winterfell fall and will have it be the NK and his army that do it.

Cersei goes to see Qyburn and gets told she indeed is pregnant. Happiness.

She meets Euron in the throne hall. Both receive information that Jon and Daenerys have been proclaimed King and Queen of the Seven Kingdoms at Winterfell.

The moment Cersei sits on the Iron Throne, the NK begins his attack on the Red Keep, riding Viserion. Cersei and Euron get burned. Ashes. Both killed by a ""younger brother"".

It includes three major battles, actual scenes with Ghost, CLEGANEBOWL, an awesome death scene for Cersei, and more!


This is a ROUGH draft of my very in-depth predictions for season 8. Im still making changes to it, but I thought others might enjoy reading what I have so far, and might be able to provide some constructive criticism. Ive outlined the entire season episode by episode. Each episodes description includes: a suggestion for a title, a synopsis, the major scenes from that episode, other minor scenes (for example, scenes that I thought would be funny), descriptions of battles (if applicable), and what music will be played during the end credits. The scenes are not in any particular chronological order within the episode (unless they must logically be); under each episode is simply a bullet point list of major/minor events I predict will/want to see happen in the show. Ive tried to condense the lists as much as possible, and thus not everything is written in full sentences. 


My Word document of predictions has surpassed 6,000 words, so I thought it would be a good idea to split it into three parts. Part one will cover episodes 1, 2 and 3, part two will cover episodes 4 and 5, and part three will cover episode 6 (the finale) plus ending details that may or may not make it into the show. Ill post part two on Saturday and part three a day or two later. 


Please, please do not downvote just because I kill off your favorite character or something. This is GOT S8. Lots of people are going to die. Dont like the way I have a certain character arc finish? Dont like the way a certain scene happened? Comment and tell me your idea/prediction! Remember that these are just my predictions for season 8, and the way I see things playing out isnt going to exactly match anyone elses way. If you have ideas about additional scenes, though, or better ways to end a certain character arc, or better episode titles, tell me!


I worked really hard on this, so I hope you enjoy!


**Episode 1: The Dragons in the North**

Description: Jon and Daenerys return to Winterfell. Cersei plots to hold Kings Landing. Theon hatches a plan.


	Reunions at Winterfell. Jon arrives &amp; reunites with Arya, Bran, and GHOST (who actually appears).

	Tyrion reveals to Dany &amp; Jon that there is no way Cersei will drop everything to help them. Tyrion knows that Cersei lied to get additional time to gather an army around Kings Landing.

	Kings Landing: Cersei plots, uses the time she has now gained to amass her army around Kings Landing. She figures shell let the fight in the North play out and be fully prepared to meet whatever comes South. 

	We get some scene(s) of Theon sailing 

	Arya and the Hound reunite. Brienne might also be there in some capacity. Its hilarious.

	Jon calls for the Northern Allies to begin to gather at Castle Black to defend the wall (not knowing that its already been destroyed). 

	Jaime travels North, catches Bronn following him, allows Bronn to tag along. 

	Other minor scenes (in no specific order): Drogon and Rhaegal chill out outside of Winterfell and freak everyone out (except for Ghost, who strangely doesnt seem to mind them). People plan the defense of the wall against the WWs, not knowing that the wall has fallen. Maybe some training scenes? 

	A short time after Jon, Dany and crew have returned to Winterfell, a large meeting is held to plan the defense of the wall. At some point someone insults Jon in some way for his family history, and Sam feels the need to defend him by saying something along the lines of But hes actually the heir to the Iron Throne! and proceeds to explain the whole Rhaegar/Lyanna deal. Everyone, as to be expected, freaks out. Dany is the most shocked. Jons just confused. Sam apologizes, saying he thought Bran had already told him. The room is chaos for while until

	Episode ending: a rider from the wall (who was at ground level when the wall fell and immediately rode at full speed to Winterfell), near death, bursts in and brings first word the wall has fallen, and that Viserion has risen. 


Credits: Ominous instrumental musicmaybe a darker version of the Dragons theme?


**Episode 2: Salt and Smoke** 

Description: Jaime arrives in Winterfell. Jon deals with the fallout of a revelation. Theon puts his plan into motion. 


	We see what happens to Beric and Tormund: they race along the top of the wall to Castle Black, fighting a few wights that climb the wall to chase them. Beric is seriously injured (from battle/when the wall fell) and Tormund is forced to leave him. Beric stays back to help fight off the wights and help Tormund escape. Our favorite ginger successfully makes it to Castle Black and delivers the news. Ravens are sent off to every major house, saying that The Wall has fallen and winter has come to kill us all. 

	Jaime arrives at Winterfell (w/ Bronn in tow) mid episode and meets everyone. He tells them about Cerseis plan to break her word, but Dany reveals Tyrion already told her as much. Dany is worried Jaime might be a spy, and Jaime subsequently has to beg for his life. Its not looking good, but Brienne stands up for him and forces him to finally reveal the truth about slaying the Mad King to Daenerys, Jon, and everyone else. Jaime is conditionally given a pardon if he serves in the war to come, with his fate to be determined after the war. 

	Jon deals with the news about his parents. Lots of brooding and sulking. Sam keeps apologizing to him for letting it slip, but says he had to stand up for his friend like Jon stood up for him.
 
	Jon and Dany have a private talk. Both agree that their relationship should end, not wanting to repeat mistakes of the past. 

	A proper, hilarious Bronn, Tyrion and Podrick reunion scene. You know you want it. 

	Cerseis army has gathered outside Kings Landing, along with The Golden Company. News arrives that the Wall has fallen. Everyone is, understandably, freaked out except for Cersei, who thinks theyre ready to face whatever comes south. News spreads fast, though, and the city becomes tense. 

	Dany and Gendry have a talk. Gendrys parentage is discussed, but Dany doesnt blame him for what his father did. She also tells him that she knows about his skills as a smith and has a special job for him. Soon after, she and Gendry return to Dragonstone on Drogon to go do the job. Davos and Tyrion also go along with them: Davos to gather up the remaining dragonglass theyve been mining and building weapons from and bring it north, and Tyrion to keep advising Dany. 

	Jaime and Bran get some sort of reunion scene. Branbot holds no grudge and forgives him for what he did. Jaimes a little freaked out, but he comes out a bit lighter.

	It is revealed that Theon has been plotting a rescue mission for Yara. He sneaks onto Eurons boat in the middle of his fleet, intending to get Yara out secretly. (He takes a small rowboat out when he knows they will be close to land and scales the side of Eurons ship.) Somehow Euron knows hes coming and is waiting for him with Yara, alone. A fight ensures and both gain serious injuries. Its looking like Theon might lose the battle, but he sacrifices himself to ensure Yaras freedom and bravely takes Euron over the side of the ship. They both plunge into the water below and drown (remember theyre both really injured, and Theon intends to drag Euron to the bottom of the ocean before letting him get rescued), never to be seen again. Yara manages to convince the crew to ally with her with an amazing speech (she probably has to beat a few people up too), thus turning the Iron Fleet to Jon/Danys side.

	Episode ends: Cut back to Winterfell, where it slowly begins to snow. In the distance, movement is seen over the crest of a hill. 


Credits: Greyjoy theme, instrumental

**Episode 3: The Siege of Winterfell**

Description: The army of the dead approaches Winterfell. Daenerys makes a tough decision. 


Opening: A wight looms over a hill overlooking Winterfell. 

This episode is the SIEGE OF WINTERFELL. Maybe a month or so has passed since episode 2. 


Winterfell has been surrounded on all sides by wights (and has been for a few days?). Most of the Northern Allies are currently gathered around Castle Black, too far away to help. The first half of the episode is our crew at Winterfell just trying to make it through the night as the wights test their defenses. Jon sends for help from the Northern Allies, but it will take them time to arrive. This goes on night after night. Everyone, and I mean everyone, is forced to fight or help out in some way. 

	Tensions are very high, lots of arguments break out. People are low on sleep because the wights only attack at night. Winterfell is very strong defensively, but there are a lot of wightsmany of which can climb. Night after night, they attack the walls of Winterfell, and occasionally a group makes it onto the top of the battlements or further. 

	Jon sends word to Dany to come help, and we cut to Dany receiving the message on Dragonstone. Dany is reluctant to charge back in and risk her dragons, seeing what happened last time she did that (she both lost a dragon and gave the NK the most powerful weapon he has), so she sends word to Jon that she wont be able to come for a few more weeks. She talks with Tyrion about her decision, and he comforts her that she made the right choice. Maybe they talk about how they both have people there they love. 

	We cut back to Winterfell, where Jon receives the message. He be sad. 

	At one point during such a breach, wights storm one of the towers. Brienne saves Sansas life, once again fulfilling her vows to Catelyn. 

	Ghost actually gets some scenes and is seen fighting wights.

	This goes on night after night, although we only actually see a few of the nights play out in the show. 

Finally, after two weeks or so, the Northern allies and the remainder of the Nights Watch make it from Castle Black to Winterfell. They crash through part of the massive army of wights to surround and protect Winterfell. Our heroes on the inside of Winterfell join them and the BATTLE FOR WINTERFELL begins. Its huge. Its massive. A lot of people die, but no major characters. Towards the end of the battle, Dany turns up again with her 2 remaining dragons, and guess what? Thats right, they both have DRAGON ARMOR. (That was her secret project for Gendryalong with several other smiths, to make two functional sets of dragon armor). They roast the rest of the dead army alive. 

At last, the battle is over. There are dead, but no bodies raisebecause there are no WWs here. Our heroes are confused. Eventually someone realizes the battle was just a distraction to keep them occupied.  This was only a small portion of the army of the dead. Jon still orders that the bodies be burned (maybe the dragons can help accomplish this quickly?)


Episode ending: The NK and several WWs are on Viserion, flying South. An army of dead follows in their wake. (What part of Westeros is most densly populated and least prepared to fight the WWs? Thats right. Theyre heading south towards Kings Landing. DUN DUN DUNNNN.)

Credits: Starts off as the House Stark theme, but transitions into the White walker theme

At the end of the day exchange Varys says something to the tune of ""You will have your vengeance and it will be so sweet if only you are patient.""

Heading into season 8 we are left in what I think is a very classic GoT-y situation. The heroes of the story are both marching up to Winterfell for a very traditional final epic high fantasy battle, while the Lannisters are lingering around the perimeter ready to go full wild card.

Cersei is making deals left and right with Euron and the Iron Bank, but we dont see what these are costing her yet. Jaime is literally last seen masking his identity and riding off alone. Tyrion is clearly unpleased with the new alliance between his Queen and now King. Each of these three are in a position to make decisions that will shake up the great war in unexpected ways.

So whats actually going on with the Lannisters? The show is being deliberate in what were shown vs. what we arent. The specifics of Tyrions meetings with Jamie and Cersei are both off screen, we havent seen any of Cerseis private meetings with Euron, and so on. These are moves the show is waiting until next year to play, but there is still some faint writing on the wall that informs the present and the future.

&amp;nbsp;

**Cersei**

*The baby is a lie.*

My main reason for thinking this is because of how fundamentally in character it would be. Cerseis power, outside of the large men with swords who follow her around, is her body. Shes the (2nd) most beautiful woman in the world. It was the crux of her thesis as she educated Sansa during Blackwater Bay. She always viewed her body cynically, as the advantage afforded her at the cost of being a woman.

Shes using that advantage non-stop in Season 7. She allies with Euron with the promise of marriage. She kills Ellarias daughter with a kiss, then goes and dominates Jaime physically in a way hes uncomfortable with. This is her full blown Modus Operandi at this point.

At the beginning of Eastwatch Jaime returns to the Red Keep after the burning of Blackwater Rush. Qyburn is leaving Cerseis room as Jaime arrives (my lord -conciliatory); he seems morose, and Cersei has already been informed of what happened. Having just seen Drogon in action, Jaime is convinced that the war is over and they have no chance. Tucked away in the conversation about what to do is this:

&gt; C: Maybe we can count on Tyrion to intercede on our behalf

The idea of enacting a truce between Cersei and Daenerys originates here, just pointing that out. The scene ends with them understanding they cant win the war, but Cersei has very Red Wedding style plans fermenting.

I think that at this point Cersei in some small way gets word to Tyrion that she may be prepared to sue for peace. More on that in a bit.

In their next scene Jaime returns after meeting with Tyrion. Qyburn is leaving Cerseis room as Jaime arrives (Ser Jaime -emboldening).

&gt; Q: I could give you something.

&gt; S: That wont be necessary.

The apparent answer for what something is is Westerosi Plan B, yet were left wondering.

Cersei again has already been informed by Qyburn of the news that Jaime is there to present, this time the meeting with Tyrion. Both events that Qybern was very quickly privy to involve Bronn. Not saying, just saying.

Cersei tells Jaime directly that shes pregnant (something youd have to do for the dumbest Lannister). Whatever fence sitting he was doing as he entered has now disappeared from his mind.

&gt; C: Never betray me again

If she has reached out to Tyrion in an attempt to regain an advantage, the cost of that move is that Jaime has regained some value for his brothers life. She needs something to mitigate that cost; the baby works perfectly.



The legitimacy of the pregnancy isnt important. She could and would use it to her advantage real or not, but it makes more sense if she creates it as a means to retain power. Given her first child with Robert Im not sure how much the prophecy means, but it would apply here. And Olenna comments to Tywin how Cersei is soon to be barren. 

Cersei wields the pregnancy in the exact same way with Tyrion. She avoids taking the wine that Tyrion offers, and Cersei indirectly tells Tyrion that shes pregnant (something youd have to do for the smartest Lannister), and then we cut away from seeing how Tyrion responds. It is even referred to as a bluff in the post show segment.

Cerseis side of the conversation ends as shes admitting that she understands what the dead marching on them means, and if it might be best to just run away and save her family. Yet we walk back out to the group having somehow renegotiated a truce and are rejoining the great war, but with no clue what went into that transition.

So it seems shes had some measure of success in manipulating Tyrion into her ploy. Whether theyve come to a formal agreement or shes just successfully isolated and latched on to his weaknesses its hard to say, but she has that moving into next season. That might be all she has.

&amp;nbsp;

**Tyron**

Tyrions failures as Hand of the Queen are well documented. His military plan to lay siege to Kings Landing was defeated on both land and sea. The only victory Daenarys got was by air, a plan Tyrion consistently argues against. By the time hes walking through the extra crispy remains of his houses army and watching the Tarlys get roasted he has to be wondering if this path is the correct one. By the time hes drowning his sorrows with Varys he seems to be conceding that the only thing between Daenarys and the Mad King is his counsel, which she doesnt seem to be heeding.

And so were back to Cerseis armistice. After Dany returns from the Rush, Jon gets word that Bran and Arya are home, and Bran has seen the army of the dead marching south. Tyrion comes up with the idea to bring a wight to Cersei in an almost instant moment of realization, and a hard redirecting of attention back to Cersei just as it was shifting to the Night King. At first I figured it was just him trying to be a smart politician (and failing terribly), but now I think hes finding a solution to forwarding an idea that he wouldnt get away with proposing out of the blue.

If that isnt the case, then Tyrion just happens to reach out to Cersei just as she comes up with the idea of him doing so. It is a little too convenient. It could be poor writing, but it feels in line with everything else. We dont see anything about how these communications are playing out, and again, Cersei seems to know more about it than Jaime, who we largely experience all this through.

By the end of his conversation with Cersei, Tyrion is almost broken. When Cersei uses whataboutism to attack Daenarys, his only defense of her is that she can check her worst impulses with his help. But she very pointedly has been ignoring his help. He mentions repeatedly that he didnt know Jon had bent the knee, even though we get the sense hes spoken with both since they returned from beyond the wall. This must feel like an act of betrayal, and one that considerably lessens his role. He has admitted to loving his family, loving Cerseis children, just as shes seemingly growing a new one.

As Jon enters Danys room, on their way to fight a war he doesnt understand, Tyrion has to be contemplating who or what is deserving of his loyalties. Dany has lost trust in him and has no use for him. Jon, his fellow broken thing, is already a King, and is about to find out that hes The King. Im not suggesting that hes suddenly breaking bad, but his preservation instinct isnt aligning him with the people hes currently traveling with.

&amp;nbsp;

**Jaime**

There isnt much to say about Jaime, the poor bastard. Not because there isnt much there, it is just all there to see. Just like Sansa, he was stuck in a toxic relationship, but because hes a slow learner, it took him until now to get out of it. Him and Sansa both had to take action; Sansa had to build the courage to take action, Jaime had to see the truth so he could take the right action. Hes always been earnest in acting in a way that he deems honorable, it was just that he was being poisoned into finding honor in the wrong things. The freedom he has moving forward is really the most exhilarating thing we could get for his character, as it is the first time he's had the opportunity to fight for his own honor, and not somebody else's.

&amp;nbsp;

**Moving Forward**

Remember this exchange between Olenna and Tywin at Joffreys wedding?

&gt; T: Im not worried about the Iron Bank.

&gt; O: We both know youre smarter than that.

Yet Cersei seems to be doing just that, even as Tycho is lavishing her with comparisons to him for turning to them for help. He mentions how the bank will miss their interest payments, and Cersei seems all to eager to give up leverage in order to make an immediate gain.

Another classic from Jaime, when Roose refuses wine at dinner:

&gt; J: You do understand how suspicious that is to ordinary people?

Cersei refused wine when she met with Tyrion, betraying her intentions. Tycho refuses wine when meeting with Cersei at the beginning of the season, perhaps betraying his intentions.

The Iron Fleet, the other acquisition by Cersei this season, is headed by Euron. When asked what he wants out of the partnership, he answers:

&gt; E: Ever since I was a little boy, I wanted to grow up and marry the most beautiful woman in the world.

Prophecy sirens should be blaring. When Eurons erection from seeing the dragon is ruined by seeing the wight, he makes a not-subtle advance towards Dany, telling her to go and hide, and they may eventually be the last people alive. Seems like you could tell who he thought was the most beautiful woman there.

We dont see how Cersei is keeping Euron on board. However real the alliance is at the moment, it isnt anything more than tenuous at best. Tycho from the Iron Bank even talks about the Iron Fleet as a separate entity (lots of iron for the family of gold). Cerseis stock looks to be about as high as it is going to get, but you can't underestimate the Lannisters.

&gt; J: Are you going to order him to kill me? I'm the only one you have left. Our children are gone, our father is gone. It's just me and you now.

&gt; C: There's one more yet to come.

If Catelyn doesn't take Tyrion, Jamie doesn't attack Ned. If Ned hadn't been attacked, he would've left Kings Landing, never have discovered the truth about Joffrey, and never have been taken captive, which means Robb wouldn't have declared war.
Also, if Catelyn doesn't take Tyrion, no war in the Riverlands.
So basically Littlefinger got insanely lucky that Catelyn happened to come across Tyrion. Obviously he then capitalized on that by delaying Ned's departure from the capital until Jamie could attack him, but still, pretty crazy luck.
P.S. on the subject of Littlefinger's luck, 99.9% of the time, Renly becomes king and Littlefinger's position stays the same or becomes slightly worse, but Renly just so happened to get stabbed by a demon baby, which allowed Littlefinger to parlay with the Tyrells, which in turn made him Lord of Harrenhal, which then allowed him to take power in the Vale.

**TRIVIA**  
* Most lines in an episode: Jon in ""Battle of the Bastards"" (88), followed by Ned, with 77 in ""The Wolf and the Lion"" and Sam, with 71 in ""The Watchers on the Wall"".  
* Sam's total in Season 4's ""The Watchers on the Wall"" was higher than his total for the entirety of Season 1, Season 2, Season 3, or Season 6.  
* Ned surpassed Tywin in Season 6, from beyond the grave.  
* Most times 1st place in an episode: Tyrion (14) followed Jon (7), then Jaime and Ned (6).  
* Most times 2nd place in an episode: Tyrion (10) followed by Jon (7) and Cersei (6).  
* Most times 3rd place in an episode: Tyrion, Jon, Sam, and Arya (6).  
* In Season 4, a Lannister came first place in each of the first seven episodes.  
* Nobody has been 1st place in an episode from every season. Tyrion was first in at least one episode from all the seasons besides 6, also his lowest ranking season (3rd). Tyrion did not come 1st in any episode of Season 6 (the first time he failed to), and only came 2nd and 3rd once each.  
* Highest lines-per-episode average (minimum 3 episodes): Tyrion (25.5), followed by Ned (24.2--37.9 in Sean Bean's speaking episodes), Jon (20.4), Oberyn (18.4), Jaime (17.6), Cersei (17.1), Robert (16.7), Daenerys (16.4), Lady Crane (16), Arya (15.3), Lysa (15.2), Sansa (15), Robb (14.4), Frey (14.4), Viserys (14).  
* Most lines by a one-episode character: Brother Ray (32 in ""The Broken Man"") followed by Karsi (24 in ""Hardhome"") and Mero (17 in ""Second Sons"").  
* Most lines by a guest star (not in the opening credits): Olenna (196), followed by Pod (169) and Yara (160).  
* Fewest lines by a credited regular: Khal Drogo (46--billed as ""also starring"" in end credits), Viserys (70) out of opening credits people.  
* Least prominent character to get 1st place in an episode: Viserys Targaryen (25 lines in ""A Golden Crown"").  
* Tyrion has been in the most episodes (61/67), followed by Cersei (58), Jon (56), Daenerys (56), Sansa (54), Arya (53), Jaime (49), Jorah (48), Theon (43), Sam (43), Littlefinger (41), and Varys (40), Davos (36), Brienne (36), Bran (35), Bronn (34), and Missandei (34). These are the only characters who are in the majority of episodes.  
* Tyrion has the most lines in season premieres, and in season finales.  
* Only Tyrion makes the top 5 (and top 3) for every season. Jon, Daenerys, and Cersei make the top 10 for every season.  
* The most prominent characters who never got first place in an episode are Littlefinger, Jorah, The Hound, Stannis, Catelyn, Margaery, and Joffrey.  
* Melisandre, Missandei, Podrick, Pycelle, and The High Sparrow are the most prominent characters who never made the top 3 in lines in any episode.  
* The most prominent character who never made the top 10 for any season is Varys, followed by Brienne, Bran, Joffrey, and Tormund.  
* A lot of characters had their most prominent year in Season 5 with their highest ever line total: Cersei, Sam, Bronn, Stannis, Roose, Daario, Loras, Jaqen, Mace, Meryn, Olly, Grey Worm, Hizdahr, Shireen, and Selyse.  
* Theon has 97 more lines in Season 2 than any other season.  
* Characters missing the top 30 in a season where they were a credited regular: Sandor in S1; Melisandre, Jeor, Sandor, Margaery in S2; Talisa, Catelyn, Bronn, Littlefinger, Jeor in S3; Joffrey, Stannis, Melisandre, Ygritte in S4; Ellaria, Missandei in S5; Missandei, Littlefinger, Jaqen, Roose, Ellaria in S6; Melisandre, Gilly in S7.  
* Nobody appeared in every episode of Season 3, 4, or 6.  
* Dropouts from last year's top 100: Yoren, Xaro, Jory, Doran.  
* Tiebreaker = more episodes.  
* I can pretty much crunch any other line count math you might want too, including specifics from seasons or episodes, and also clicking ""view results"" after 7 seconds on [this quiz](https://www.sporcle.com/games/doctrine_duke/got-lines-per-episode) will give you the top 4 per episode.

**Full Series Line Count Predictions**  
Will there be enough Daenerys focus in S8 to topple Cersei and become the series' top female? I kind of doubt it, just because there will probably be a lot of Cersei too, probably not 73 fewer lines. The Arya/Sansa rivalry being so close is cool to win the Stark sibling race, but Sansa has the talkier role these days and will probably stay ahead after her high showing for Season 7. Davos and Jorah are racing for Littlefinger's spot in the top ten and my money's on Davos, although both getting in and knocking out Theon is certainly possible too. Tormund would need to get a lot of play to knock Robb out of the top 20, but anything's possible with these rumoured movie-length episodes. I also forecast Beric/Qyburn/Euron into top 50, and Lyanna Mormont/Lord Glover into top 100.",52,147,False,spoiler,,,,,

Know that it is known that Jon snow's real name is  Aegon Targaryen, do you think it is possible he dies by the hands of the drowned god? Who do you guys think the drowned god is?

There are a lot of loose ends, a lot we pin on the writer's apparent lack of good writing while others may jump to defend them. Still, while re-reading the books and re-watching the show, we are still left with several pending items such as:

- **Davos** not dealing with **Melisandre** about Shireen's death. Is he biding his time? Is he letting her move around freely since she might be useful in case someone important looses his/her plot armor and needs reviving? Probably nothing going to happen here, probably he will kill her next season. Or the writers are confident we will forget about this. I have seen Shireen screaming at the pyre and Davos in possession of the small toy, so I know I won't forget about it.

- **Theon** and Yara, whose actions along with the rest of the Ironborn were crucial in striping the north from the Starks, but mostly Theon who only faced an angry face from **Jon** when they met again. Yes, Theon saved Sansa... but I would expect a stronger reaction, even if he knew they were on the same side. I mean, in certain moments Jon knew about Theon supposedly killing his little brothers but also everyone he knew at Winterfell, the people Jon grew up with, the betrayal of someone who might not have been a brother to him but definitively treated as a real honored guest from Eddard is heavy and carried horrible consequences. I probably would land some good fists against Theon's face. But probably Jon is giving less importance at the moment for more pressing concerns such as the show-and-tell they had to prepare for Cersei, also he's a right proper lad.

- Ellaria Sand and the sand snakes are not the only living people in **Dorne**. I mean, they have a bunch of princes, any of them would've seized power while Ellaria was out with Yara. Even if they didn't because Dorne supported their plan, right now the entire region is still a threat now that Ellaria was captured. They should be mobilizing entire armies against King's Landing. I mean, the whole North revolted when the Lannisters captured Ned, is Dorne really that apathetic about their current leaders? Yes, yes, the Dorne timeline in the show is terrible, but just remember that Dorne is quite huge to be brushed off with just the capture of the Red Viper's paramour and daughters.

- **Jon** and **Tyrion**. Jon met Tyrion when Robert asked Ned to be his Hand. They went together to the wall and formed a curious relationship of respect but that was about it for those two. The events that occurred later (Suspicion of Tyrion's dagger and possible assassination attempt on Bran, Cat capturing Tyrion, Tyrion escaping and becoming Jeoffrey's Hand, Blackwater Bay siege from Stannis, etc.) are surely known to Jon in part of becoming Lord Commander first, then King in the Norf and being able to read all news available to him. I mean, there was time to catch up on all important events while they were/weren't fast traveling. But when they met again, no big deal, no surprises, nothing. At least I expected Tyrion buying Jon a beer and have a lengthy discussion on all the unclear affairs. Something along the lines of ""I heard you tried to kill Bran, so my step-mother captured you"" / ""Funny you mention that! Got a nice story about how I trial-by-combat-escaped my way out of that"". Maybe later. Maybe never.

- Nice of the **Hound** on forgiving **Brienne** about their fight. Nice of him on being happy about **Arya** now capable of looking after herself. Even if both of them left him to die. But I'm letting this one go as a simple mention since Sandor has shown a lot of growth lately and probably just thinks: ""Bugger the past"".

Just imagine yourself, in any of those scenarios. You being Jon and suddenly facing Theon. You being Davos and having Melisandre around. You being the Hound and seeing Brienne next to you. You being one of Dorne's princes and seeing your leader taken or a power vacuum and the Dornish throne ripe for the taking. No reactions on the show, no side notes, no comments, mostly nothing important.

I know: There is no time to check all those loose ends. No time to write them in, no time to fix them. So we all assume most of those things are just going to be forgotten and left as it is. It just bothers me to some level and wanted to share it with you since some of you might be ready to lash out against this post, maybe saying something along the lines of ""this post is stupid"" just like Arya would say or even write your own loose ends and discuss.

EDIT: Also, before anyone says that Davos, Jon, etc. are better man, they take the high road... ...bugger that. No one is that perfect on dealing with emotions. It is human to show some anger now and then.

And if I'm wrong, I will gladly read your comments why.",8,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

I can't recall the season/episode, but they have a stronghold north. To truly bring closure, Jon/Dany may need to head there and destroy the last of everything. Maybe him or Dany perish in the battle.

I FF'd through so much. So I tried simply stringing up all of the NW/North of the Wall scenes and its been a right cracking time. You've got Jon trying to convince Mance to bend the knee, Jon getting elected LC, his execution of Janos Slynt, Mel attempting to seduce Jon with those glorious tits, Stannis giving his Father Of The Year speech, Jon being advised by Maester Aemon and sealing his destiny (kill the boy, Jon Snow!). And Hardhome! All topped off with a nasty assassination and the mother of all cliffhangers. 

Of course, this doesn't mean there aren't other things to recommend about S5. While the High Sparrow plotline started out a bit slow, Cersei's walk of shame was pretty powerful and Jonathan Pryce's performance is sublimely brilliant, Arya's killing of Ser Meryn Fucking Trant was awesome, and of course, Stannis the Mannis' final days.

Sansa is showing some small signs of empathy for Littlefinger and Arya makes an attempt to comfort her.



Arya: ""You did the right thing.""


Sansa: ""You did it.""


Arya: ""I was just the executioner. You passed the sentence. You're the lady of Winterfell.""



I realized how this completely contrasted with Ned's lesson to Bran in s1e1. Additionally, this piece of advice from Ned has become an integral element to Jon's character as a leader. I can go in a lot of different directions in interpreting this, so I was wondering what some other people think.



Personally, I feel like this could be emphasizing the importance of plurality in power. We have seen the storyline transform in favor of those who heed counsel. Robert Barartheon was a king who had won a rebellion and established his power by overthrowing his own king, going on to destroy further rebellions and maintain his grip on the Seven Kingdoms. He basically epitomized the symbol of centralized power and displayed utter ambivalence toward his duty. Additionally, Ned showed some of the desirable traits of a leader, such as the lesson that he who passes the sentence should carry out the execution, and still ended up being executed. One could argue that a man with inferior honor toward his duty and toward his friend, the king, would have removed himself from the situation and back to safety in Winterfell long before things escalated to his arrest and subsequent execution. Even if someone is infallible in his or her personality, he or she cannot effectively carry out every single responsibility of a ruler alone. This would be assuming that Sansa and Arya are being used to depict an efficient ruler.

The way I see it Cersei had two main options either send help or do nothing.

Option 1 
She could call all the banners and sent them all north to help fight the WW. And there would be two main outcomes of doing so.
     

Scenario 1.
                   They get defeated by the WW and everyone that was sent then becomes a WW including the remaining dragons. This results in a even more massive WW army. That Cersei would have little chance of defeating and surviving (if she does not flee) so she ends up dying. Or huge twist she becomes a WW and marrys the night king. 
     

Scenario 2. 
                  They defeat the WW, however they would most likely end up taking huge losses. And those who survived would not be up for another fight between Jon+Dany against Cersei. And if there was another battle they might be inclined to take the side of the people who were willing to fight along with them, which would be Jon+Dany.( I'm assuming Cersei would remain in Kings Landing if she did send help.) This would then result in either Cersei voluntarily surrendering which I do not think she would do. So she would have to use the Golden company or what is left of the kings guard to fight. But I think she still would have lost, then be killed afterwards or in the process.   


Option 2
She does not send help and uses the Golden Company, and what is remaining of the Lannister army, and who ever else is willing to defend kings landing. 
    

Scenario 1.
                  Jon+Dany and company lose to the WW and Join their army including dragons again, resulting in a massive WW army. That would easily overwhelm Kings landing, and again kill Cersei (if she does not flee).
   
 
Scenario 2. 
                 Jon+Dany defeat the WW however they would take heavy losses, and similar to the other scenario 2. Their army would have to march to kings landing in winter, and then fight in another huge battle for their lives. This scenario gives Cersei the best chance of defeating those two, and remain the queen of Westeros. 

If I were Jon+Dany after defeating the WW I think the best thing to do would be to wait out the long winter in the north. Where you know Cersei would not send her army since the are a southern army. This would also give them the best chance of having the golden army leave, because they would be sitting around kings landing for years maybe decades. And eventually they would want to do what they are good at which is killing. The only obstacle I see is the lack of food, because Dany made the wise decision of blowing it all up. They might be forced to go south for food resulting in a battle.

What do you think?

While S7 may seem like a great time to show up--not many competitors for the throne (one, really) with a relatively weakened army, is there another time in the show when it would have been more ideal?

To be clear: I mean to ask when Dany would have had the easiest time taking the iron throne with the forces she has in S6E10 
For argument's sake, let's assume a few things:

- Assume Dany has the same force as she does in S6E10--the ~100,000 Dothraki, ~8,000 unsullied, 3 dragons, Greyjoy fleet and whatever ships she had.

- Count out the Dornish and Tyrell armies from Dany's forces.

-  Say that the Greyjoy happenings (Balon's death, Euron's rise as king) have already happened, as this would have little or no impact on political climate before S7.

- Try to be more strategic and less tactical, as in, avoid talking about when the best time to attack a certain army would be and focus more on the political climate of Westeros.

The first option to me is right after Roberts death. All the kingdoms are fighting, but for the crown or justice, not independence. Only one army is formidable in Renly+Tyrells, but they don't control the crown.

My second option would be after the Battle of the Blackwater, but this would mean facing a much more formidable Lannister/Tyrell force and a King in the North with no interest in kneeling.

Depending on how crafty her spywork is, my third (and in my opinion, best) is sometime after the death of Tywin and before the revival of Jon Snow. The Tyrells would love a way out from the Lannisters and have a son ready to marry, Dorne, the Riverlands, and the Stormlands are a mess, and neither the Vale nor North have any true allegiance to the crown.",10,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

While **Dany&amp;Jon** are off fighting the WW, their **forces will be severely weakened** (the NK already killed one of Dany's dragons upon his first time meeting her). Especially since the **Dothraki** horde and the **Unsullied** are **not used to** such **harsh climates** and will drop like flies.

**Cersei,** on the other hand, could use that time to rebuild and **strengthen her army** by **conquering the southern regions.** She could easily conquer the **Stormland, Dorne, the Reach and Riverlands** as the **great houses of those regions;** Baratheons, Martells, Tyrells and Freys/Tullys (with the exception of Edmure who currently a prisoner, and therefore presents little threat) are all **extinct** and the **smaller houses aren't powerful enough to oppose** her. If she manages to successfully do so, she would have **4 more kingdoms to add** to her army (which currently consists of mercenaries, Euron's fleet, the Westerland-Lannister army and the Crownlands).

Afterwards, all **Cersei has to do is to take care of the leftover army** from the **war between Dany&amp;Jon VS WW.** 

a) Even if Dany&amp;Jon defeat the WW, they'll be very weakened and could have possibly lost another dragon(s) whereas Cersei would have had a bigger army than before. (You could argue that Dany could just have her remaining dragon burn down the Red Keep/King's Landing and claim victory but I doubt Tyrion and Jon would let Dany do that).

b) If WW defeated Dany&amp;Jon, they'd nonetheless still be somewhat weakened; assuming that **Jon had slayed a few White Walkers which would also kill the wights that White Walker had animated** during the battle of Dany&amp;Jon VS WW. It's also worth noting that **Dany would have burned down a significant number of wights with her dragons** which would make it easier for Cersei to wipe out the remaining army of the dead. If Cersei loses to the WW, then it was **already a lost war from the start** and Cersei at least managed to procrastinate her inevitable death. If Cersei betrays Dany&amp;Jon, **Cersei can enlist 4 more kingdoms to fight against the leftover NK army** as she would have conquered the southern regions; which in total would be **all 7 kingdoms fighting against NK** whereas **Cersei helping Jon&amp;Dany** would be **only 3 kingdoms fighting against NK**

Honestly, the only **flaw in the plan** was how she **alienated Jaime which made him leave.**

All three of these characters begin as proud, go through a sobering hardship, and come back stronger and better people, but not without a few bumps. Lets go through these three characters:

Jaime: begins as a arrogant and brash person, although good at his core (as seen by his actions to save the people of King's Landing). Is taken prisoner by Robb Stark, transported back to King's Landing by Brienne, loses his hand, is ridiculed, and becomes a better person through it. He gives Oathkeeper to Brienne and strives to make things right. However, he becomes involved with Cersei again and refuses to leave her until the very end of season 7, even through the horrible things she has done. It seems like Jaime was redeemed after being with Brienne, yet fell back somewhat into his earlier character.

Sansa: begins as a naiive and somewhat spoiled child. She has a childlike fantasy of wanting to become queen and marry a good and kind king, and believing that she is helping herself and her father, tries to save him by pleading with Joffrey. She is beaten and abused by Joffrey, is forced to marry Tyrion, and is taken away from King's Landing by Littlefinger. From there, she gains some independence, but then is sold to Ramsey where she is raped and abused. Again, it seems like Sansa finally was able to be independent, but was trapped back into a horrible situation from a family which she could barely escape.

Theon: begins as a cocky (pun intended) person, and helps Robb to march south. That is, until he decides to take Winterfell after meeting his father after many years, in an attempt to become a true Greyjoy and obtain approval from his family. Theon is then taken prisoner by Ramsey, is very badly tortured and stripped almost entirely of the person he was before, and castrated. Theon eventually redeems himself (or not, depending on the opinion of the viewer) by saving and protecting Sansa. It seems as though Theon has recovered somewhat, but he has PTSD and becomes Reek again while fighting against Euron and bails when Yara needs him.

All three characters go through a hardship, a redemption, a subsequent faltering period, and an even greater redemption. Season 7 leaves off with Jaime riding north and being true to his word, Sansa freeing herself of Littlefinger and allying with her sister, and Theon gaining the respect of his people and going to save Yara. This faltering period is often criticized by many viewers, but I would argue that it does not represent bad writing, or is out of character for these three. Instead, it shows that the road to recovery and the path of development is not always straightforward, and instead can be varied and nuanced. 

TL;DR: Jaime, Sansa, and Theon develop as characters, but not in a straightforward way. While seen by some as bad writing, I argue that it makes the story more realistic and complex.

- It's not a popularity contest. Many people consider Cersei unlikable but still think of her very highly as a character, same for Theon. Meanwhile everyone loves Tyrion, but some people think the writing of him ever since he left King's Landing hasn't been very good.

- We're talking about the show versions of the characters, so any additional book content should not be taken into consideration to make the decision. In addition, they should be judged separately from the books and not by how similar they are to their book counterparts.

Love your comments! Keep them coming! 

**Episode 4: The Mad Queen**

Description: Daenerys plans to take back the Iron Throne. Tormund reveals a secret. Arya sees an opportunity.

	Cersei has closed off Kings Landing completely, not allowing anyone to enter or leave. Her army still sits camped outside. Word about the dead army coming has people terrified, but Cersei thinks shes prepared. 

	Yara writes about Theons heroic sacrifice and how the Iron Fleet is now theirs to command. Jon and Dany receive the message together in Winterfell. 

	The Northern Allies are still chilling out around Winterfell. There are probably a few good reunion scenes here. 

	Jon, Dany and crew discuss whats going on around Kings Landing. They both decide that Cersei has to go now if the city has a chance for survival. They hope to beat the NKs army south by riding Drogon and Rhaegal. (The NK isnt going at full speed on Viserion because he doesnt want to get separated from his army, and hes still working on building his army on the way). They plan to infiltrate the castle and kill Cersei to stop her command over the army outside Kings Landing. Once this is done, the people will be free to evacuate the city and the armies will be able to team up to fight the dead instead of fighting each other. When it is asked who will do the deed, Arya volunteers. 

	Jon is reluctant to let Arya do such a thing, still remembering her as his young little sister, but Sansa vouches for her. (Sansa knows what Arya has grown up into better than Jon does, having seen what she did to Littlefinger). Jon eventually agrees on the condition that Arya doesnt go alone. The Hound volunteers to go with her.

	Jon and Sansa send word to Davos to bring the rest of the raw and forged dragonglass to Kings Landing, not North.
 
	Tormund meets Lyanna Mormont for the first time, whos chilling at Winterfell with her army after the siege. I completely accept the fan theory that Tormund is her father, and they get a wonderful scene together where he figures out who she is and then reveals as much to her. For just a moment, Lyanna breaks down and gives him a hug. Its the only time we see her act more like a young child than an adult in a childs body. The hug is joyful, but also heartbreaking because Tormund will never make it back North again. (Am I as bad as GRRM? Probably not, but I try.)

	Theres a touching moment as Jon interacts with Rhaegal, the dragon named after his biological father. He finally kind of gets over his brooding and realizes he is both a Stark and a Targaryen. 

	Dany sends word to the Unsullied/Dothraki to move to Kings Landing, but not to engage Cerseis army yet. 

	Jon once again leaves Sansa in charge of the North, but this time, something about it feels more permanent. 

	Sansa releases Brienne from her vows so she can go south and fight for the side of the living. Brienne is reluctant to go, but Sansa really wants her to go on her behalf, so she finally agrees.

	Pretty much every main character whos a good fighter (along with some red shirts, of course) are heading South towards the end of the episode. I figure each dragon could easily manage the weight of 20 people with their armor on. (The dragon armor has some sort of built in saddle type thing?). Only a few main characters, the ones desperately needed in the North (such as Sansa, Bran, remaining leaders of the major houses, etc.), stay behind. 

	The episode ends with the dragons taking off from Winterfell, passengers in tow. Then we cut to Cersei staring out of a window as the two dragons approach from afar. Then we cut to credits. 

Credits: House Lannister theme that transitions into Rains of Castamere. We all freak out wondering what Cersei is thinking as she stares at those dragons. 

**Episode 5: The Iron Throne**

Description: Daenerys tries to take Kings Landing. Enemies come face to face.

This episode is the FIGHT FOR THE IRON THRONE.

Recap: currently, Cersei has Kings Landing on lockdown and surrounded by her armies. Our heroes plan is to kill Cersei to both free the city and get all the armies on one side. (They figure that once shes dead, everyone else will listen to reason and team up to fight the WWs).

We start the episode in Winterfell, though, where Bran is having a vision of the original Battle for the Dawn. In his vision, Bran sees the Night King get stabbed with a Valyrian Steel sword, which wounds the NK and forces his retreat but doesnt kill him. Bran has uncovered some powerful knowledge: the NK is super powerful and itll take more than *just* Valyrian steel to kill him. He gives this news to Sansa, who knows that she must get it to Jon ASAP. Sending the message with just a raven is too risky, so she also sends out the message with messengers on horseback. Finally, Sansa, having been placed in charge of the North, makes the decision with what to do with the forces still in the North. She knows that it would be impossible for the entire army to make it South in time for the battle, so she sends only the cavalry, hoping theyll outpace the army of the dead. (The rest of the forces stay in the North to help defend it, in case any WWs try to come back North). 

Now, back to the South. Our crew of heroes (~40 total) fly in with the two dragons and land directly on the grounds outside the Red Keep. (On the way in, the dragons have face a few of Qyburns weapons, but oh boy does dragon armor come in handy!) There they hop off and battle the guards that rush out to meet them. During the chaos, Arya and the Hound sneak away to go deal with Cersei. 

	Cue some awesome ground level battle scenes with the crew and the dragons. (Also, Dany *finally* wears some sort of actual armor)

	Arya and the Hound kill some guards or something to get disguises. Even the Hound is grossed out (but slightly impressed) by how Arya makes *her* disguise. 

	More sweet battle scenes. Our crew breaks down the main door and storms the throne room. (There may be only 40 of them, but they are a collection of the best fighters in the realm. Having 2 dragons for back-up certainly doesnt hurt either. 

	Arya and the Hound approach Cerseis chambers. (Plan of the Red Keep supplied by Varys &amp; Co.) They kill a few guards as they go. But who stands guard right outside Cerseis chambers? Thats right, the zombified Mountain. The Hound says to Arya that this is something hes gotta do alone, and that while hes fighting the Mountain she should go deal with Cersei. INITIATE CLEGANEBOWL. HYPE HYPE HYPE. 

	Meanwhile, the throne room has been secured. Battle wounds are being patched. Drogon and Rhaegal sit happily outside, roaring their little dragon hearts out. Dany gets a cool scene where she slowly walks through the room and touches the throne. Shes been trying to get here, to the Iron Throne, for 8 seasons, and now its right in front of her. 

	Jaime, meanwhile, realizes something feels amiss. He quickly leaves the throne room to everyones confusion. Cut back to

	CLEGANEBOWL!!!! The Hound wins and we all know it, but doesnt come out unwounded. Cut to--

	Arya opening Cersesis door only to find no one (hahaha) there. She removes her face disguise in confusion. Cut to

	The Hound, sitting there panting. He looks up as Arya enters the room with a strange look on her face. He says some witty one-liner as his smile turns to a frown. Cut to

	Jaime, down in the basement of Kings Landing (you know, with the dragon skulls). He spots Cersei and Qyburn talking in secret. Cersei tells Qyburn to go, do it and that she will bring the Red Keep down upon her enemies. Something along the lines of if I cant have the throne, no one can. Its implied that Cersei has filled the Red Keeps towers with wildfire, and that her quickly thrown together plan was to lure her enemies in with an easy victory and then basically burn them all. You know that Jaimes getting some serious Mad King vibes now. Qyburn leaves, but as he goes to go up the stairs or whatever, Jaime steps out from the shadows and stabs him in the back. Cersei is surprised.

	Meanwhile, Dany stares up at the iron throne. Someone asks if shes finally happy to have it. She asks how many swords its made ofsomeone replies around 200. She (kind of reluctantly, but kind of with a new determination) says something along the lines of good, well need the steel to fight the dead and orders it to be torn down and reforged. (The iron throne must have some Valyrian steel in it, right? Either way, theyll need the weapons.) Everyone is shocked, but no one argues with her. 

	Jaime and Cersei have their last talk. Cersei begs him to run away with her. He doesnt agree, but still seems reluctant to kill her. However, its revealed that Cerseis pregnancy was fake and meant to control him. This is the last straw for Jaime, who proceeds to strangle her to death. (Maybe against one of the dragon skulls?) Cersei finally slumps down, dead. (The whole realm breaths a collective sigh of relief, although no one knows why). Jaime collapses, cradling her head, silent tears on his face. The shot stays with them for several long moments before we cut to credits. 

Credits: Silence for several seconds, before we go into a very quiet, sad version of Light of the Seven

**A note on prophecies:** I dont think that any one person will be the answer to all the prophecies. My original version of S8 involved Jaime alone fulfilling the prophecies (I love the whole Golden Hand theory), but I felt like it wouldnt have been right to give all the heroic roles to a single character. GOT isnt about one hero and one villain, its about a gigantic mix of characters who all have important roles to play. Thus, I think that multiple characters will play significant roles in fulfilling the prophecies. In my modified version of S8, I chose Jon, Dany, and Jaime to together fulfill these major roles. I dont think the show is going to give us a clear answer of who exactly is TPTWP/AA/LB in the end, it will just kind of be implied. Thus, I am also going to be rather enigmatic in how the prophecies are fulfilled. Just know that these three characters will play significant roles in the downfall of the NK. 

**Comments on Part One**: Thank you for all your comments! I would like to respond to a few of them here.

	Yes, Bran would realize that the Wall had fallen almost instantly after it actually fell. He would then proceed to tell Jon about it immediately. This is one of those important details that kind of just slipped my mind while writing my predictions for episode one. However, do we know how long the last scene of season 7 takes place after the scenes on the boat? Perhaps the whole crew has already arrived back in Winterfell when the wall actually falls. Im just going to run with this, so just replace the ending of episode one with Bran busting in in his wheelchair and revealing the news instead. 

	I apologize that some characters have not gotten the screen time they deserve. Please dont assume that if a character isnt mentioned in my predictions, that they dont do anything of importance; I just didnt have time to write down what they did. For instance, in the first three episodes, Arya might work on training the people of the North on how to fight, she might get some nice one-on-one talks with Jon/Sansa/Bran, etc Im a busy student who would love nothing more than to expand this list of predictions even more, but I have -10 free time right now. This is where I need your help. Think Im missing a scene? Tell me! If I like it, I may just add it!

	I totally forgot about the whole ""Dany killed Sam's brother and father"" plotline, so assume that is addressed in episode 1 or 2. 

Part three will be out tomorrow or Monday!

Danny &amp; allies:

~ 50k dothraki (I assume the whole Khallesar includes women&amp;children&amp;old ppl unable to fight, so only about half of them are able to fight... if those ppl aren't counted then there is 100k of them which just makes matters worse)

~ 6k unsullied (I assume that since they've been fighting for so long at least 2k must have died by now)

~ 6k almost unsullied (not fully trained/grown, she bought both, depending on how they were used&amp;how old they were there could be more or less)

~ 10k Northern soldiers &amp; Free folk (that's the number given and seems believable considering Robb gathered 20k at a moments notice and was supposed to be able to raise  20k more had he waited... the north has seen some bloody fighting in the meanwhile but some of the largest houses didn't participate so their armies should still be intact)

~ unknown number of Northern peasants (if shit hits the fan hard just give them a shield and spear... better than nothing)

~ 2 dragons

That's 72k trained soldiers, an unknown number of peasant levies and two dragons.

Lannisters &amp; allies:

~ 10k Lannister&amp;ally soldiers (I'm being generous here they could have lost more when the dragon &amp; Dothraki attacked them but since they said before that they are stretched all over the road and since the gold got to King's Landing I think most survived)

~ 20k Golden company mercenaries when they arrive

~ 30k-60k Ironborn (but they are mostly sailors not soldiers plus someone has to man the ships so it's not like many can fight in a land battle)

That's less than 10k men she can actually send north right now. Hardly enough to make a difference.

Meanwhile she can use her forces to retake the Riverlands/Stormlands/Westernlands/The Reach and increase her manpower &amp; build more scorpions (we saw that it can injure a dragon and that was one, now imagine what a 1000 would do) while waiting what happens in the north. If the White Walkers win then they are all dead anyway and her contribution wouldn't have helped, if Danny&amp;co win their armies will severely depleted so she will actually have a chance of winning or stalemating them.

Just finished Season 4 but I'm very confused about one thing.

Why does the Hound refuse to give Arya to Brienne?

Obviously neither Arya nor Sandor *trust* Brienne, but why did the Hound feel obligated to protect Arya?

Did he actually care about Arya?
What did he plan on doing with her?
Did he plan on taking her somewhere else? 

I've read plenty of explanations for why Arya left him to die, but I haven't been able to find anything regarding the Hound's feelings towards Arya or his reasoning in keeping her.

Can someone please explain this to me or direct me to a place where this has been explained?

The way the Ironborn story is playing out,  I think the only interesting outcome is The on ruling. Yara and Euron aren't as interesting of characters to me and I feel that there isn't the payoff compare to Theon.

 It would have everything come full circle for him: he started the show as accepting of his role within the Stark family, then rejecting it to please his dad,  regretting it almost immediately, losing his identity as Reek,  recovering some of his identity but not willing to take the final steps (jumping over the boat),  and then finally emerging as a reborn Theon and rediscovering his courage. 

He has said on multiple occasions that he is not fit to rule... But maybe as S8 plays out,  that is shown to be more self denial than anything. My question is, if this all happens,  will the Ironborn following Euron accept Theon?  And do you see a better solution to all this or maybe want to see Euron or Yara ruling?

IMO, this is one of the possible endings... where NK wins... and Bran decides to go back in time and change it... 
and I wouldnt be suprised he gawks back to the Night Watch man his father beheaded in the first episode. And he tells Ned ""Lyanna"" and starts telling him the future... forcing Ned to believe the imminent danger beyond the wall.

Stannis always defended her against her mother (who really hated her for some reason??). I found it really ridiculous that after the fact, the mom wants to feel awful and kill herself like seriously?

And same for Stannis, how could he bear to hear and see that?! I just find it hard to believe he was so heartless about his child. Especially since in this show everybody goes hard for their kids; they're like their prized possessions.

The Night King is dead, but I still honestly believe Daenerys isnt going to survive - either death in battle or a supposed prophecy of her dying by Jons hand - and Daenerys legitimizes Gendry as the Lord Of Storms End, such as she wants people to forgive their mistakes of their fathers and she gives Gendry the Baratheon name. With her dead, people would suspect Jon to take the throne, but Id have Gendry rightfully take it. Jon becomes King of an independent north.

The sad cincher about it is that I think Arya will die in Gendrys arms; that shell overstep her boundaries and get cocky and try taking on a White Walker or get overwhelmed... something to that nature. 

Gendry arrives in Winterfell years later to see Jon, Sansa, and Bran, and both he and Jon go to the crypts to visit Aryas grave, and like Robert says to Ned about Lyanna, she was supposed to be his and everything ends.

That is... for some reason it seems perfect to me, and I cant quite tell.

I dunno, personally I don't want her to be either. I'm probably one of the few who would rather see her independent, cause I kind of hate the predictable relationship between her and Jon.

In the last season of the tv show, particularly the last episode, there was some slightly unusual behaviour shown from Tyrion. Was wondering what others think about this and what it means for the next season. 

Here are some of the things I noticed (and some speculation as to what they may mean). There's no particular order, I've just numbered them for ease of reference and discussion:

1. One of the key events of the last episode was Tyrion meeting privately with Cersei in an attempt to get her to change her mind. Now he appears to everyone else (and himself?) to achieve this, though we know she doesn't plan on keeping up her end of the agreement. But assuming for a moment that she had planned on keeping up her end of the agreement - what did he actually say to her to get her to change her mind? It certainly wasn't his appeal to family and apologising for killing Tywin; we saw all of that on-screen and she wasn't swayed. It must surely have been him agreeing to give her something (his life? Dany's? The throne?), unless I'm missing some other angle. It all happened off-screen, so he seems to be keeping some secrets from the viewers and possibly Dany and her backers.

2. Towards the end of the final episode, when Dany and John go to her chambers, a lot of screen time is given to Tyrion watching them enter and then lingering around, looking at the door. This must indicate that it's an important moment for the character. What is Tyrion's reaction to Dany and John becoming lovers? Is he jealous? If so there could be major ramifications depending on how he reacts as a result. He's been a major proponent of them allying, but he didn't exactly look thrilled by them becoming lovers.

3. He broached the subject of the succession with Dany in the last season. What was his angle there? He didn't actually say who he thought should replace her when she dies, but presumably he had someone in mind (himself? someone else?), otherwise he wouldn't have pressed so hard on the issue.

4. He's also shown increasing reservations about Dany all season, most notably when she (reasonably given the circumstances imo) executes the Tarlies with Drogon. Later we see him worrying out loud with Varys about her temperament. Is he becoming disillusioned with Dany? Could this be the beginnings of a betrayal storyline?

The one key thing that makes me doubt all of these angles (which would paint him in a pretty negative light), is the fact that his personality has been built up to be, essentially, one of the nicer major characters. He's quite noble, loyal (especially to Jaime), and diplomatic; not the sort of character you'd expect to stab people who had shown him kindness in the back.",12,17,False,spoiler,,,,,

I know Ned acted as hand for a brief while, but he didnt play the game well nor correctly and got severely punished for it.

* Jon Arryn- Although we only know very little, he has been credited along with Tywin Lannisters backing at keeping the kingdoms together. He died, and everything went down the drain from there on.

* Tyrion Lannister- From his stint in Kings Landing and now as Daeneryss hand in Season 7, he has practice at ruling and helping others rule. Hes got wit, charm, and a great talent at judging character (as he says he does), but he has had fumbles in battle strategy late in the show - but give him credit where credit is due for the defense of Blackwater - which have seriously dampened his success.

* Tywin Lannister - I suspect everyones answer to be Tywin, under the short time he reigned as hand under Joffrey, as he truly was the puppet master playing with all the strings. He had respect - from Olenna Tyrell no less! - fear, and was a military mastermind and commander too. And to be fully known, that once he died, everything for the Lannister name left in Westeros starting slipping quite fast.

* Davos Seaworth - The best talker Ive ever seen, more so than Tyrion. Trading Stannis Baratheon for Jon Snow as his leader, hes proven to circumnavigate testy and troubled waters under both leaderships. He successfully started the redemption and revival of Jon Snows resurrection and coup of the Nights Watch, convinced Melisandre to convince Stannis to ride to the Wall, and among many others. Hes your greatest cheerleader.

* Jorah Mormont - Though including him on a such a list is testing many boundaries as he was never given a clear title of any such manner, it is not an unknown fact that he had Daeneryss ear throughout her beginnings and kept her alive in Qarth among other perilous scenarios. He eventually betrayed those he was betraying her to as he become devoted to her cause and it was always brought up that he had a reserved spot for him on her council.

I didnt include Ned Stark or Kevan Lannister or Qyburn in this list. My own selection would be a tie between Davos and Jorah. Thoughts on who would be the better hand of the King?",12,8,False,spoiler,,,,,

Not only is she in my opinion the most beautiful person in the entire cast, but I also miss her for burning Cersei like for example in S5E3: ""Mother! Welcome! Can we bring you anything to eat or drink? I wish we had some wine for you, it's a bit early in the day for us...""

Their entire relationship was so entertaining...

I also found it fascinating that I never knew her motives besides her one obvious goal. Why did she try to help the common and the poor people? Her first priority was to be ""THE Queen"", but was all of her charity work (when she was still engaged to Joffrey) rather politics or did she have a kind heart as well? Or her kindness towards Sansa... She didn't really have to be that nice to her to find out that Joffrey was a monster...

I'd love to read your opinion on her, so please chime in :)

Not a sole exception, as almost all other Westerosi noble families had members present or mentioned in the books cut to make the story easier to understand for the TV viewer (cut family members prominently include Victarion Greyjoy, Arianne Martell, Garlan Tyrell, the list goes on...)

Things are quite different in the show's German dub, however, where Aemon refers to Aerys as ""Enkel meines Bruders"" (grandson of my brother) and that ""sein Enkel Aerys"" (his grandson Aerys) reigned after him. This is not the result of a faulty translation however, even the german Game of Thrones Wiki explicitly states that the english-language original of the show and the German dub differ in this point. It's interesting that the German dub does make out Aerys as the grandson of Aegon V (like it is in the books), it however also states that Aerys reigned directly after Aegon, implying that Aerys' unnamed father never became King. I wonder whether this happened in any other dubs of the show, or if this specific change of dialogue only occurs in the German version.",7,6,False,spoiler,,,,,

I try to imagine them differently, but it requires active concentration and as soon as it breaks, the show characters appear again. Now there are some characters that are almost the same as in the show, and some that are very, very different. But I don't want to mix and match. Either I imagine every character differently or every character from the show. Which is much easier but then I have to ignore every description that differs from the show, which sucks.

(Main Spoilers)

In the air Dany riding Drogon and Tyrion riding Rhaegal are having a dope ass Dragon fight with Viserion. Rhaegal takes a big hit and him and Tyrion start to plummet towards the icy ground below leaving Dany with no choice but to dive fast and hard to try and help them reorient themselves. (Que hard cut to Jon, Jorah, and Jamie) 

The three J's or J and an A if you prefer are having a regular old rope-a-dope duel with The Night King sword of the morning style with the three of them tag teaming the bastard. The Night King nearly lands a good hit on Jon but Jamie parries it with his metal hand causing it to shatter and Jamie goes down. Jorah takes a good swing at NK but he gets knocked away and Jon gets tripped up and rolls over to face the NK as he comes in for the killing blow. (Que hard cut to Bran and Sam in the distance.)

Sam has one of his moments of brilliance and tells Bran to warg into the NK. He tells Bran he is stronger than the NK but Bran is doubtful. He does it anyways and the do the cool zoom in on Brans face as he wargs out. Awesome mental battle ensues as Bran dukes it out mentally with the NK. (Hard cut to the NK)

NK stops mid swing and Jon starts to crawl backwards to his sword, he can tell theres some weird shit going on but he's not about to say no. Bran speaks through the NK telling Jon to end it because he can't hold on too much longer. Jon kills the NK which kills Bran in the process. 

Dany goes to save Tyrion midfall but because Tyrion is a strong independent dwarf who don't need no man he manages to right himself and fire off the finishing shot at Visi ending the chase as the ice dragon falls to the earth only to shatter like ice. ",11,0,False,self,,,,,

- Bran Stark (Now let's start with Bran. Now a lot of people think Bran will be killed of sense now that he knows the truth (R+L=J) he may no longer be needed. But I think he is going to have more to do it may be to help against the long night)

- Sansa Stark (now some people think she will due to the fact that her direwolf dead and most of the starks who have had direwolves have dead. Two thinks 1. Ned and Cat did not have Direwolves and still dead second I think she is too obvious)

- Arya Stark (Now this one seems most likely as her death was forshadowed in one of the books and it seems they me be setting her up to die (with catspaw she may try to kill a other) But at the same time they have forshadowed other fates for her)",22,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

But then I realized, in Season 6 he led the recapture of Riverrun, and the taking of Highgarden in the last season. And there are likely still occupying Lannister armies at both.

Now given the choice, who are the men going to follow. The man who led them to victory (and a bloodless one at Riverrun as well), or Queen Wildfire? He could march those men north to join the fight against the White Walkers.

Probably an obvious observation, but it just now occurred to me.

Well, I wish he had run away. Here's why, Jon has to decide where his loyalties lie to, the Watch or family. Him choosing family would add so much depth into his character. Jon had grown up with Robb his entire life, and throwing that away because of some stupid oath that most members don't even take seriously is just foolish. Jon obviously looks up to Ned, so just like his father, loyalty is a trait he follows. But loyalty towards family should always come first, he might be a bastard, but Robb was more of a brother to him than Sam or Grenn would ever be. So I think he should've continued going to Robb.

**Episode 6: A Dream of Spring** (This episode will be at least an hour and a half, maybe longer)

Description: The Night King marches on Kings Landing. 

Episode opening: Much like the season 4 opener of Ices reforging, it is a montage of the Iron Throne being melted down and reforged into individual blades. This probably requires dragon fire of some magnitude.

	Cerseis death has successfully turned most of the armies outside over Kings Landing to their side. Maybe it takes a few inspirational speeches and some bribery, whatever. 

	Jaime is dealing with a lot right now. We pick up a few days after Cerseis death. A few whispers of Queenslayer are going around. 

	Yara shows up with the iron fleet and uses the boats to evacuate the city. She expresses regret about missing the upcoming battle, but knows that shes more help on the sea than on land anyways. Anyone unable to fight gets on the boats and they sail awaymaybe across the Narrow Sea?

	Around the same time, Davos (w/ Tyrion and Gendry in tow) shows up with a boat full to the brim with dragonglass, which is quickly dispersed around the armies and made into make-shift weapons. 

	Jaime and Tyrion have a heartbreaking scene together discussing Cerseis death. 

	Various cutscenes of the characters preparing for war. Word comes that the army of the dead isnt that far away. Tyrion comes up with a plan to strategically place wildfire where the dead will march, hoping to take at least a chunk out of the army. Someone agrees to shoot the wildfire from a safe distance with a fire arrow or something.

	At least one cute scene with Tormund being super impressed by the Red Keep.

	The remainder of Danys armies show up, along with other armies within marching distance of Kings Landing. The cavalry Sansa sent from the North also show up just in time and deliver Brans message. Theres some discourse between armies, but its quickly shut down. Few doubt that the true threat is coming, and coming soon. 

	Late one night, an undead Viserion is spotted in the distance. Dany is distressed. The NK appears to be using it to scout their armies. 

And then, its time for the BATTLE FOR THE DAWN. All of the major armies weve seen team upfrom the North to the South, from the Dothraki to the Unsullied, theyre all ready to fight for their lives. Its massive. Its huge. Its epic. It eats up a lot of the CGI budget. Lots of people die, being Game of Thrones. The battle starts as the sun is setting and the WWs and co. approach the armies outside of Kings Landing, and lasts until just before dawn breaks. 

	Part of the army marches within range of the wildfire. However, the person with a bow cant trigger the wildfire because their arrows keep hitting the wights and not the wildfire on the ground. A few wights fall over dead, but the stuff isnt triggering, which no one thought would be a problem. Maybe the WWs proximity and their magic cold powers have even done something to help keep it contained? Dany decides to try breathing fire on it with one of her dragons, but its unsure if the dragon could be hurt if in close proximity to such a massive explosion. Before they can come to a decision, Melisandre (who is somehow currently in Kings Landingmaybe she just came on her own? IDK) rides out alone on a single horse directly into the wight army. It looks like they have her surrounded, but she does some sweet fire magic or something and goes out in a blaze of glory to trigger the wildfire. Theres a massive chain reaction explosion that takes out a good portion of the dead army, but the wildfire eventually dies, and more and more just keep coming. Our heroes prep for battle. And then it begins.

	BATTLE MONTAGE GALORE. Tormund dies in a blaze of glory. :(

	When Viserion shows up, Dany knows she must send her other two children to face him, otherwise their armies are toast. The dragons shed their armor in favor in being lighter and more agile in an air battle. She watches sadly as they take to the air. The NK dismounts and Viserion goes to face the other two dragons alone. 

	BATTLE MONTAGE GALORE. Jaime and Brienne fight side by side. Brienne takes a major wound doing something heroic and is forced to retreat to get patched up. Jaime has lost Widows Wail in the midst of the battle, so she gives him Oathkeeper to keep fighting with. Meanwhile, the Hound, still wounded from CLEGANEBOWL but determined to fight, fights side by side with Arya. He takes a mortal blow, though, and Arya is forced to give him mercy. Very sad. 

	All the dragons end up wounded. Viserion is about to bring Rhaegal down when he is stopped by Drogon. In the process, Drogon is maimed, but will survive. Undead Viserion has been wounded so much he can no longer fly or barely breath blue fire, and he lays on the ground, barely able to move. Still, everyone is afraid to approach him. Drogon sits nearby, surrounded on all sides and unable to fly. Rhaegal is trying to defend him from the wights surrounding him.

	Dany sees her dragons in distress from afar and rides out with part of her reserve army to rescue them. Dany is forced to finish Viserion off herself (she wont let anyone else do it) with a spear of dragonglass. Its a super sad scene. She also checks on Drogon and Rhaegals health. Just then, an extremely large group of wights breaks through her reserve army. During the ensuing battle, Dany tries desperately to defend her children (shes not a fighter, shes just desperate and trying to defend her dragons) and takes some sort of wound-- just as she loses consciousness, Rhaegal grabs her and flies away to get her to safety. (Dont worry, she wont die). Drogon finally manages to move himself off of the battlefield so that hes in relative safety. 

	Who kills the Night King? The battle is utter chaos. Towards the end, Jon sees the NK for the first time and makes a desperate charge towards him in hopes of ending the war (sound familiar?). The NK sends wights at him, but Jon easily cuts them down. They proceed to face off in one on one combat. The NK is about to kill him, when suddenly a sword pierces his backits Jaime with Oathkeeper! The NK doesnt instantly die, though, and turns on Jaime. Jon, having been disarmed, pulls a dragonglass dagger and stabs the NK. The combination of Ice (literally what Oathkeeper was made from) and fire (dragonglass=obsidian can represent this) kills the Night King. The sun begins to rise. Dawn has come. 

	At that point, a large portion of the wights turn to dust. Not all of them, but certainly a lot of them. The army of the dead takes a huge hit. Some of the WWs still alive try to make a run for it, the rest continue to fight but are easily subdued. Parties are dispatched to kill any remaining WWs and wights. 

	The battle scene ends with Jaime and Jon, sitting back to back, exhausted. A single wight struggles towards them, upper torso only. Without even looking at it, Jon pulls a dragonglass dagger and puts it through the head of the wight. Jaime doesnt even acknowledge it, and they go back to sitting in silence. I dont know why the idea of this scene amuses me so much, but it does, so I had to include it. 

So now we skip ahead about a month or so, at least a few weeks. Dany, having been seriously injured, wakes up in a room in the Red Keep (kinda mirroring how Tyrion woke up after TBOTBW). She finds the realm already far into the process of cleaning up and repairing itself.

	Dany inquires about the state of her dragons, the state of the realm, and the ending of the battle--Tyrion gives her all the details. She smiles at how well theyve done in stabilizing the realm and keeping it from collapsing from the chaos in her absence. Tyrion brings up Jaimes fate, but Dany tells him the killing the Night King is more than enough to gain him a permanent pardon.

	First and foremost, Dany visits her remaining dragons. Rhaegal looks fully recovered, but one of Drogons wings is hurt and hell likely never fly again. They all have a bittersweet reunion. 

	Dany requests to be brought to the throne room. All our favorite major characters currently in Kings Landing are there waiting for her. Most of them look more or less recovered from battle injuries, but many have scars that will last forever. Dany gets introduced with her ever expanding list of titles. 

	A number of ceremonies are held. Dany honors Jaime and Jon for killing the NK and officially, publically pardons Jaime. (Whispers have gone around and the nickname Kingslayer is used more often than ever, but for the first time, in only a positive way). Several characters are knighted, including Pod. Pod initially refuses to be knighted until Brienne is, but then Jaime steps up and knights them both. When someone protests, Dany shuts them down. 

	Dany inquires more about the state of the realm, and is told more about how many people have contributed to ruling in her absence. 

	Someone asks Dany when she wishes for a new throne to be forged. With a startling decree, Dany steps down from being the monarch of Westeros and institutes a council in her place. 

Youre probably surprised right now. Why would Dany willingly give up her throne that she just spent the past 8 seasons trying to get? Because its a good ending to her character arc. Here are a few details we know about her:

	Dany is a fair and decent ruler who actually cares about the smallfolk

	Dany wants to break the wheel

	Dany is unsure about who would succeed her after her time on the throne

	Dany recognizes that Westeros has been plagued by really poor leaders for a long time, including her father.

Dany comes to a realization when she sees how good the realm is ruled by a group of people working together for the benefit of everyone. By stopping the Westeros monarchy, she breaks the wheel by ensuring the pattern of horrible kings with absolute power comes to an end. While Dany knows that she would be a good queen, she also acknowledges that her successors may be very poor rulers (like Robert) or cruel and horrible rulers (like her father and Joffrey). If she continues the monarchy by being queen, she subjects the future population of Westeros to the same fate. By breaking the wheel, she frees the people from having a single ruler with unquestionable power. 

	A quick note: Dany has tried to set up a council system in the past (was it Astapor, Yunkai, or both?), so we know shes not totally against the idea of giving the rule to more than one person. The council(s) only failed when she (and her armies) left. Thus, shes already learned from her past mistakes and now knows that, if she uses her remaining forces to support the council, it could grow and become established. 

I dont have the exact details of the council in place, but essentially:

	The initial plan is for the council to consist of 7 members of equal standing, one from each of the seven kingdoms. However, upon further consideration, the number is expanded to 8 to give the Riverlands and the Iron Islands separate representation. (Perhaps, ironically, the council is still called The Council of Seven and the members referred to as The Seven because it sounds so much cooler.)

	Each of the seven kingdoms would decide in their own way their method of picking their representative. Maybe, when a spot is open, all the major houses from the region meet and have something along the lines of a kingsmoot, I dont know. 

	One of the seven members may be selected to be the organizer/voice for the council, but all members would have equal power in decision making.

	Each of the seven members would have their own set of personal advisors, who may be from any region

	The council of seven can nominate people to fill positions traditionally filled by the small council, such as master of coin and whatnot. 

The council is certainly not a perfect system, but Dany figures its gotta be better than an absolute monarchy. Dany dictates that she will fill the roles of the council herself for the first time to serve for the next three years (while the realm is recovering), and after that the individual regions can pick as they choose. 

Here are the people Dany picks (or tries to pick):

	The North: Jon, who turns it down and suggests Sansa instead. Sansa is reluctant to accept and leave Winterfell without a Stark (at this point, Bran is already gone, more on that later). Arya sees that this is important to her, though, and *very* reluctantly steps up to act as temporary lady of Winterfell. Sansa then accepts Danys offer.

	Westernlands: Tyrion, of course. He quickly accepts, honored. Jaime looks on with pride.

	Iron Islands: Dany asks Yara first, but she turns it down, saying she prefers life on the sea. She promises to send her most trusted advisor in her stead. 

	Stormlands/Crownlands (combined): Dany herself. She asks Davos, our favorite Onion Knight, to be one of her main advisors, having originally come from that region. He humbly accepts. 

	I cant think of any alive characters left for the other 4 regions, so assume the positions are filled by random people from the other major houses. 

Now, here are some of the long term parts of the ending. As promised, its overall bittersweet. Some of these will be shown in the last 15 minutes of the episode or so. The ones that take place significantly later in time may have to be shown in an epilogue format (if the show has one) or simply hinted at. Not all of these may be shown in the show, especially the ones that take place not just 5, but 50 some years in the futurethese are more of just predictions for the fun of it. Perhaps some of them will be shown in the books but not the show.  

	The last few Children of the Forest (there have got to be some left somewhere) come to find Bran at Winterfell a few weeks after the NK has been defeated. Bran knows he must return to the far North to make sure the WW threat is gone for good. He also knows that he must continue to protect the Children there and makes the decision, much to Sansas sadness, to stay there for good. They share a tearful goodbye. Yes, even Bran criesit shows that theres a little bit of him still inside himself, making the scene even sadder. Bran is never heard from again. 

	Jorah briefly returns to Bear Island to visit his family, but afterwards returns to Kings Landing to continue serving Daenerys.

	Once the realm is stabilized, Daenerys briefly takes time off to return her armies from Essos (or at least those who wish to return) back to Essos. 

	Jaime and Brienne return to ~~Casterly Rock~~ Tarth together. They live happily ever after, because at least two people in this show deserve to. (Im sorry, but Im completely, totally biased on this prediction, since they're basically my favorite characters.) 

	Speaking of people who deserve to be happy, Ser Podrick Payne journeys around Westeros and becomes one of the most renowned knights of all time.  

	The Nights Watch is officially disbanded, seeing as how there is now a giant hole in the wall they were supposed to protect anyways. For their service in the war against the dead, each man is awarded some of the land in the Gift. Some of the ruined castles are even renovated along the wall.

	Many wildlings perished during seasons 1-8, but there are still many left who did survive. Seeing as how the wall is fallen and there is no longer any official division between the North and the far North, the wildlings are given a choice of where to settle. Some choose to head back up North to their ancestral lands, some settle in the Gift, while other head South or even across the sea to see the world.
  
	Jaimes nickname Kingslayer is forever solidified in the history texts, but he no longer minds it. 

	Bronn FINALLY gets his castle.

	Killing the NK seems to have made the winter slightly more mild, and summer returns after only a few years, to everyones relief. 

	Arya grows more and more restless month after month as lady of Winterfell, and after about two years she disappears in the middle of the night. (The smith at Winterfell also, strangely, disappears at the same time.) Sansa quickly returns to Winterfell and someone else takes her place on the council. (In my version of the ending, its totally Lyanna Mormont). Strange stories are told about a pair of strangers traveling around the kingdoms killings bandits and stuff. Nothing is heard of Arya Stark for a few years until she eventually turns back up at Winterfell and apologizes to Sansa. (Something along the lines of I tried to be a lady, but thats not me.) While Arya still never stays in one place for long for the rest of her life, from here on out she makes an effort to keep up communications with Sansa and be a part of her life.

	Davos serves as Danys advisor for a few years before retiring to a nice island somewhere. He spends his days reading and fishing.

	Yara dies of battle wounds several years later, because that's the only way I could see her going out that would be acceptable. She takes a bunch of people with her, though. 

	Trouble arises on the council about what to do when breaking ties in voting on issues. Thus, a few years after its initial creation, the council of seven is expanded to 9 people in total. An extra representative is given to the far North to represent the Wildlings and those in the Gift. (To everyones annoyance now, the council is still called the council of seven.)

	Tyrion serves as the Westernlands representative on the council for a long time. He dies in his own bed at the age of 80, and, well, you know the drill. 

	Dany serves on the council for a long time. Several years after the show ends some major problem arises in Mereen, and she returns with her remaining army to put it to rest. After making sure an actually stable form of government is set up there, along with Astapor and Yunkai, she returns to Westeros. From here on out, she continues to serve on the council, occasionally taking time to get Dragonstone back up and running. 

	Jon doesnt know what to do with his life. Hes officially done with positions of leadership, but with the war finished and Westeros entering a phase of rebuilding, there are no great battles for him to fight. He spends most of his time between Kings Landing and Winterfell initially, but both places hold too many sad memories, and he realizes he doesnt truly belong in either place anymore. He spends several years journeying in the far North beyond the wall, talking with wildlings and making sure that no WWs have survived. He even makes a few expeditions into the uncharted parts of the North, hoping to find the place where the WWs lived. His name goes down in the history books forever.

	Do Jon and Dany get back together eventually? I couldn't decide, so it's up to you to make your own predictions on this one. I also couldn't decide if I wanted Dany to end up pregnant or not, so I purposefully left that part out of my predictions. I'm not for or against Jon/Dany myself, and since it's rather controversial, I figured I would just leave it out of this list of predictions and focus on other things. 

	Speaking of history books Sam returns to the Citadel after a number of years and becomes a renowned maester. He is responsible for many changes and reforms in the Citadel, and also goes on to write down the histories of the past number of years. (He especially focuses on Jons story because thats the one he knows the best.) He calls the series A Song of Ice and Fire.

I feel like the bulk of season 7 was getting rid of characters that dont fit in the fantasy story of the living vs the dead. In example, the sand snakes, Littlefinger, Olenna etc...

Many of my friends that Ive spoken to have openly admitted that Theon cant be redeemed. They have a point, if his brutal torture and Sansas rescue didnt redeem him for you then honestly nothing will. For me I think it made me feel bad for him but then after feeling bad you remember all the troubles that Theon has made for the Starks and for Winterfell. I get it he has had an identity crisis but at the end of the day it was still his decision, it wasnt as if someone like Ramsey was going to torture him if he didnt do it.

Lastly, hes going to save Yara, who is a decent character but I mean really? Like if Yara were to die in season 8 in the grand scheme of things...who cares? I was a little disappointed that we didnt get to see more Euron in season 7 they basically cut him off after episode 3 and I was also disappointed that thrones really hasnt lived to its reputation the last 2 seasons of anything can happen and itll break your heart so maybe this season 8 Theon storyline will help develop Euron as an antagonist and he will kill Theon and Yara?

She's no nonsense, she's clever, she's resourceful and she's dangerous. Too dangerous.

By now, the end of season 7 she is probably the most dangerous main character (not including the dragon's) in the show by quite a significant margin. She single handedly brought down a ""great"" house without a single person in said house able to so much as draw a sword against her. She could quite feasibly assassinate any of Jon's main rivals, and can not only hold her own, but defeat one of (so probably more than one of) the realms greatest knights. 

So knowing all this, I feel like she's too dangerous to live. She's like a huge dues ex machina card that can be activated at any time to kill anyone and alter any event. I feel like Cersi probably would be dead right now had she not decided to stop and visit the family instead.

She has all of the power of the faceless men, but none of the restrictions and I fear that this cannot be allowed to stand. My prediction is that the faceless men will take exception to the things  Arya has been doing and put a stop to her, because otherwise what's the alternative? Send her off to assassinate any political rivals that might raise their heads? She's like a magic bullet that can be used against anyone at any time and it's even more OP than having dragons. However her powers are considerably less useful in the war with the undead, though not a lot is stopping her from wandering around among the Lanisters wearing the face of some lord or another and assassinating various leaders one by one, or just skipping right to Cersi.

So I predict one of 3 endings for her, and none are good unfortunantly.

* The faceless men come for her

* She makes mistakes and Cersi finds out what she can do, and springs a trap for her

* She meets her end vs the undead.

Also a thing to point out is that in the books she has even more power, being able to warg into animals similar but not as well as Bran can.

TLDR: Arya is the most powerful single main character in GOT and unless she's removed her presence basically eliminates any possible threats. She's like a magic bullet.",29,7,False,spoiler,,,,,

Personally, I care most about character reunions, meetings, interactions and relationships (old and new).

I think it will be interesting to have Dany meet all of Jon's loved ones - Sansa, Arya, Bran, Sam (&amp; family). As someone whose only family member she ever knew was a horrible person, I think she'd have a strong reaction to seeing how loved Jon is and how much of a ""real family"" the Starks are. I also think that it would be wasteful if there aren't some good Dany/Sansa, Dany/Arya moments. 

I also don't want reunions to be glossed over - when Jon and Arya see each other again, I want the moment to make me cry like the Jon/Sansa one did. I also want it to come out that Sam's the one who saved Jorah, and Dany killed his brother and father, and for this to cause some conflict.

Finally, I want some props for the Stark girls for the people they've killed! I want Jon to laugh when he hears that his sisters killed Littlefinger while he was away. I want Arya to tell everyone that she avenged Robb and their mother, and killed Walder and all of house Frey. The Hound will laugh if he finds out Arya killed Meryn Trant in Braavos and he would also be amused to hear that Sansa fed her abusive husband to his own hounds.

I think going into season 8, we all know that the White Walkers have to lose. So a victory of the living won't be a surprise or a twist. Obviously characters will die, but we also know that's coming. So to me, it's the interpersonal character moments that will matter the most in the final season.

What's most important to all of you for the final season?",138,62,False,spoiler,,,,,

This revolves more around the more complete chronology of the whow, however there still may be some ancillary evidence from the books when relevant.

From Season 1, Game of Thrones has conditioned us to believe in good guys and bad guys. Most episodes are written from the point-of-view of the Starks and Daenerys, who are painted as the ""Heroes"" of the story. But are they really heroes? On the other end, are the Lannisters really villians? In the following paragraphs, we will be discussing similar actions taken by the ""heroes"" and ""villians"" of the story, how they relate to each other, and if there really is a good guy in a Game of Thrones, or if the writers have tricked us into believing in one.

The first event when we see a ""villian"" in Game of Thrones is when Bran climbs the tower at Winterfell and stumbles upon Jaime and Cersei having sex, and is then thrown from the window by Jaime. This happens at the very beginning of the series, where we have little context of the world and the characters, and paints the two Lannisters immediately as the bad guys. It's a little ironic that one of the moments we've seen most recently is sex between Jon and Daenerys, who are aunt and nephew, and whose family has a long history of incest. The way these two events are presented is a little different. During the tower scene, we have little understanding of the incest rules in Westeros, we don't know, for example, that Tywin married his cousin or that Targaryens married their siblings. With that in mind, the tower sex scene really isn't as bad as it's first made out to be. Sure, they throw Bran out of the window, but at that point he's just a kid that they barely know whose father is someone they don't really like. We've seen many of the heroic characters, including Jon and Dany, kill children, either directly or indirectly (Jon and Olly, Dany and the child that her dragon killed). Within the context of the other events of the show, does the tower scene really give indisputable evidence that the Lannisters are truly evil? And even if they are kind of bad for this event, are Jon and Dany any different? If we take these events on their own without the biases of following Jon and Dany as the heroes for the entire show, these events really aren't that different at all. But because of how the writers use Stark and Targaryen points-of-view, and try their best to make them look heroic, we have two totally different perspectives on pretty similar events.

The two events I want to talk about next are the Red Wedding, and Arya's mass revenge killing against the Freys. The perspective we are shown of the Red Wedding is from the Stark perspective, which portrays the Freys, Boltons, and Lannisters as dishonorable villians. But looking at the entire situation objectively, are they really bad for doing that? Let's start with the beginning of the War of Five Kings. Robb becomes King in the North because of Ned's death and Sansa and Arya being held hostage. He marches down to the Riverlands and Westerlands and makes war on the Lannisters, causing the deaths of thousands of soldiers, as well as the massive destruction of the Riverlands, crippling their food supplies for winter. All for his sense of ""honor"" and vengeance, and to rescue his two sisters, one of whom is already free. Is Robb really a hero for this? Likewise, are Tywin, Roose, and Walder really villians for making a secret strike, taking out the leaders of the Northern army and bringing a quicker end to the war? I'm sure that, had the war continued traditionally, thousands more would have died. Are their lives somehow worth less than Robb's and Catelyn's? The writers really try and portray the Red Wedding as a reprehensible, dishonorable act, but I think that looking at it objectively, they made the right choice to kill Robb then and there, rather than to ""honorably"" let more and more people die while food supples continue to get destroyed. Because of our Stark perspective of the Red Wedding, we end up rooting for Arya when she commits mass murder on the Frey family. But if we take a step back and forget our connection to Arya, why would that be a good thing? Why would we root for someone who feeds a man his own family members before killing him and his entire family? Tywin, Walder, and Roose didn't want to kill the entire Stark family with the Red Wedding, they were just trying to end the war, whereas Arya commits an absolutely horrible act for no real reason other than revenge, and yet, because of the Stark point-of-view and the portrayal of Starks as good guys and Lannisters as bad guys, we end up cheering for Arya's revenge and hating Tywin, Walder, and Roose for the Red Wedding.

While Dany doesn't really have any brazen examples like the ones above for the Starks, her portrayal as a hero comes into question when you look at her end goals. She's okay with starting another civil war in Westeros , once again killing thousands upon thousands of smallfolk and soldiers, all for her selfish belief that she deserves to be Queen of Westeros. Why can't she be happy with her kingdom in Meereen? She's actually done real good over there, and yet she totally abandons it for her own, selfish desires. Is Dany really a hero there, or is she just being portrayed as one by the writers?

While I'm sure there are other events that could be discussed here, I'm trying to keep it as brief as possible, but I think the examples above are enough to show that we have been deliberately misled by the writers into viewing the Starks and Targaryens as heroes and the Lannisters as villians. At the end of the day, I don't believe there are heroes and villians in Game of Thrones. Pretty much every character has committed horrible acts, or at least been involved in them in some way. I think this deliberate misleading towards heroes and villians has a lot to do with George RR Martin's anti-war stance. Many of his other works are very strongly anti-war, and he himself was a conscientious objector during Vietnam. George RR Martin really hates war, which is why I think Season 8 is going to go a lot different than people think. It's been set up that Season 8 will bring more war into Game of Thrones, with the Starks and Targaryens (""good guys"") vs the White Walkers (""bad guys""), as well as the Starks and Targaryens against Cersei (""bad guy""). But if we've determined that the good and bad guys are a farce in Game of Thrones, we have to think that things will turn out much differently than ""Starks and Targaryens heroically beat the bad guys against all odds."" First let's talk about war against the White Walkers. We will be talking a little bit about the books here, but not any plot spoliers, so be warned. The White Walkers (called the Others in the books) are portrayed a little bit differently in the show and in the books, but I think that at the end they're going to mostly follow the same storyline. In the books, we don't have any evidence so far that the Others are straight up evil. Their plans are totally unknown, at least not from a primary source, and their name- the Others- is literally a play on xenophobia- human's irritational fear of the other, or those different than themselves. While the show White Walkers have done some more evil-seeming stuff than in the books so far, I don't think that they're really going to be truly bad guys- or at least, not any more bad than the humans in the show have already shown us to be. When it comes to war with the Lannisters, I don't think we're going to see the expected outcome there either. 

With all of the horrendous acts committed on all sides in Game of Thrones, I really doubt we're going to have a happy ending at all. I think that in Season 8, instead of the epic, large scale battles that people expect, we're going to see a lot of stuff that reinforces the anti-war nature of the story. I don't think the Starks and Targaryens are going to ""win,"" in fact I doubt there will be a real winner at all.

So that's the end of my essay, I'd love to discuss this more in the comments, so please share your ideas!",15,10,False,spoiler,,,,,

He was one of the best characters but also fell prey to the 8 season limit and having to wrap things up quickly. 

1. Sansa is the most irritating character of all - writers tried to project as this strong independent woman, but she still needs some one or the other to ""protect"" her and quite contrary to what she tells Brienne, before sending Brienne away to KL.
She actually needed Theon to save her from imprisonment by Ramsay, she needed Brienne to save her from the search party, she also needed Jon Snow to finally get rid of Ramsay. But Littlefinger was apparently a sitting duck, completely opposite to how he had been portrayed until S4.

2. Why did Littlefinger not demand trial by combat? 

3. I understand that in this world, peasants may not get fair trial, but Littlefinger did not get a fair trial - zero evidence, since almost everything charged against Littlefinger was based on the words of Sansa, Arya and Bran. Why should the rest of the people in the Winterfell Hall believe any of them?

4. If Bran was able to see Littlefinger hold the knife to Ned's throat, why did he not see that Littlefinger tried to help Ned and warned him too? Ned was the one who was stupidly honorable to not pay heed! 

5. Why did Littlefinger not try to enquire and understand how Bran knew ""Chaos is a ladder"" mentioned by Littlefinger - he stayed in Winterfell long enough so that he could be bumped off by the Starks conveniently. Especially, after the crypts incident with Jon, etc. he should have just packed his bags to the Vale, but no stayed on for a few more episodes so that he could be become part of Season Finale dead list.

Thoughts?

It's obvious that he has come to love and care about Dany, but the more I rewatch some of their scenes together I feel like he still in a way has some feelings but is trying to ignore and get over them.

The way he was looking at Dany in the scene where she named him her Hand, he was clearly touched by Dany's kindness and compassion and for finally being accepted and viewed as a person. She is one of the only people who has ever given him that, I wouldn't blame him if he was developing some feelings.

At the same time though, I think he is trying very hard to get over it because he is smart enough to know and accepts that Dany and him will never be anything more other than close friends/professional business workers. Jorah I think is probably trying to do the same, but it's too hard for him to move on especially after everything he has been through with her.

I also think that Tyrion has come to view Dany as more of a sister figure, which helps him to not let those feelings kick in again. I would love it though if Dany put him on the spot and asks him if he is also in love with her, but only if something happens which makes this topic seem relevant to a conversation they're having.",11,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

4. The living can be turned into white walkers via dragonglass to the heart (plus maybe some old gods voodoo)

5. In certain circumstances, adults turned into white walkers retain their ""human"" goals and morals, i.e., Benjen.

Which brings us to....

**6. A human is going to take over the army of the dead or possibly raise a pro-humanity army of the dead by sacrificing themselves via dragonglass to the heart to become a pro-humanity white walker.** Candidates for this role include anybody who can warg, putting Bran at the top of the list.

Ended up letting the gold train get spread too thin, which was then massacred by overwhelming forces. (LOSS)

&gt;Damascus steelwas a type ofsteelused for manufacturing sword blades in theNear Eastmade withwootz steel.[1]These swords are characterized by distinctive patterns of banding and mottling reminiscent of flowing water. Such blades were reputed to be tough, resistant to shattering, and capable of being honed to a sharp, resilient edge.[2]

The steel is named afterDamascus, the capital city ofSyria. It may either refer to swords made or sold in Damascus directly, or it may just refer to the aspect of the typical patterns, by comparison withDamaskfabrics (which are themselves named after Damascus).[3][4]

The original method of producing Damascus steel is not known. Modern attempts to duplicate the metal have not been entirely successful due to differences in raw materials and manufacturing techniques. Several individuals in modern times have claimed that they have rediscovered the methods by which the original Damascus steel was produced.[5][6]

The reputation and history of Damascus steel has given rise to many legends, such as the ability to cut through a rifle barrel or to cut a hair falling across the blade.[7]A research team inGermanypublished a report in 2006 revealingnanowiresandcarbon nanotubesin a blade forged from Damascus steel.[8][9][10]Although many types of modern steel outperform ancient Damascus alloys, chemical reactions in the production process made the blades extraordinary for their time, as Damascus steel wassuperplasticand very hard at the same time. During thesmeltingprocess to obtain Wootz steel ingots, woodybiomassand leaves are known to have been used ascarburizingadditives along with certain specific types of iron rich inmicroalloyingelements. These ingots would then be further forged and worked into Damascus steel blades. Research now shows that carbon nanotubes can be derived from plant fibers,[11]suggesting how the nanotubes were formed in the steel. Some experts expect to discover such nanotubes in more relics as they are analyzed more closely.

I'm such a kid at heart. If you're like-minded, you'll love this prank.

I don't get many kids trick or treating during Halloween because of my location, so I decided to make and give out tricks instead of treats this year.

Instead of the rattlesnake eggs prank, I made dragon egg envelopes (a fun Game of Thrones spin). Heh.

If you aren't familiar with the prank, here's a video that shows a similar idea. Opening the envelope causes the mechanism inside to unwind. (You manually rewind the mechanism for multiple use.) Goofy, but FUN. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxyfZGya0b8",1,2,False,self,,,,,

It will end with peace for sure - but how? I believe option 1, but I cannot exclude the other options.
option 1 - reigning of sovereigns with blood of all remaining houses with claim on the throne (John - Cersei/Danearys or Jaime - Danerys with the Starks as right hand or something like that)
option 2 - no sovereign, a somewhat democratic system between the houses

The last scene where they interacted before this scene was when Dany ignored Tyrion's plead to not go to Eastwatch where she could possibly die after his advice on doing 'nothing' got her no where after she listened to it before. It was a sad scene for Tyrion because of how much he was scared to lose her, but it wasn't the best way to leave us hanging on their relationship while we wait for Season 8 to arrive.

And next thing you know, we get a very similar scene where Tyrion is about to go risk his life where there is a high chance he could be murdered by his own sister, and Dany is the very first and pretty much only person who is against him doing this. THIS really satisfied me, because despite his mistakes like being responsible for the loss of their allies, Dany still loves and cares about Tyrion and didn't want him to pay the price for it by dying. She knows he's only human and isn't perfect. It was her choice of words too that really hit home for me. ""I didn't come all this way, to have my Hand murdered."" She has been through a lot and has come a long way, she lost people she's loved and valued, she recently just lost one of her 'children' and now she's frustrated on the fact that a man who has become her close friend/brother figure is possibly about to be gone next.

When Jon notices this, he insists he should be the one to speak to Cersei alone instead since his decision is what caused them to not earn Cersei's support but Tyrion knows he'll be killed before he can even say a word. Even though he also cares about Jon, I think Tyrion also wouldn't let Jon be the one to speak to Cersei because him dying would be bad for Dany especially since she's already lost enough of her Westeros allies. But Tyrion knew he had to be the one to do this, because it was his idea and if he had to die in order to get the support they needed and to not have everything they went through be for nothing, then this was the only way.

Dany still didn't like it but she knew he had to try, her reaction seemed very similar to when she reluctantly accepted that Jon had to lead the suicide mission to Eastwatch in S7E5 only she looked more vulnerable in this scene. I think their clashing in the early episodes made this moment have more of an emotional impact which is why I love it so much. The whole time I was looking at Dany's face as she was watching Tyrion leave the pit, all I could read from it was 'Please don't die, I still need you.'",10,30,False,spoiler,,,,,

Who is left as possible next queen to cast Cercei down and take all she holds dear? Only three possible queens come to mind: Dany, Arya or Sansa.

Will Dany cast down Cercei and become the new queen? Does that mean Jon will die to get the bittersweet ending or will Jon and Dany be married and will be Jon the king and Dany his queen, but with only ruins left to rule?

Will Arya cast down Cercei by killing her and become the next queen? Maybe with Gendry as king?

Or will Sansa become queen and cast down Cercei by leading an army of survivors after the WW are overcome?

And what about the Valonquar prophecy from the books?

&gt; It was Riverrun's old maester, with a message clutched in his lined and wrinkled hand. Vyman's face was as pale as the new-fallen snow. ""I know,"" Jaime said, ""there has been a white raven from the Citadel. Winter has come.""

&gt; ""No, my lord. The bird was from King's Landing. I took the liberty . . . I did not know . . ."" He held the letter out.

&gt; Jaime read it in the window seat, bathed in the light of that cold white morning. Qyburn's words were terse and to the point, Cersei's fevered and fervent. *Come at once*, she said. *Help me. Save me. I need you now as I have never needed you before. I love you. I love you. I love you. Come at once.*

&gt; Vyman was hovering by the door, waiting, and Jaime sensed that Peck was watching too. ""Does my lord wish to answer?"" the maester asked, after a long silence.

&gt; A snowflake landed on the letter. As it melted, the ink began to blur. Jaime rolled the parchment up again, as tight as one hand would allow, and handed it to Peck. **""No,"" he said. ""Put this in the fire.""**

He practically showed Cersei a middle finger.

All answers are basically something like this: those things happen because it doesn't need to require things the living require to do similar things. This answer is also legitimate. I have a long theory explaining more strange things to come. You remember there was a guy beyond the wall who gave his baby boys to the white walkers and life was going on for him and his daughters? Two things seem to be implicit here.

1. It is possible to have a deal with white walkers (night's king).
2. They turned the babies into white walkers. It makes sense only if these babies are going to grow and be useful. We have not seen baby army. Are they becoming ""a particular white"" or ""king"" or what? 

These probably mean, there is a degrees of life for withe walkers. They can communicate with the living but not normally. They grow but don't reproduce. They probably can give collective orders to the dead army to do things (like mind controlling). This explains how that chain work was done, how that wolf figure was formed by the dead army at the last scene of the season 07.

Now: what degree of life? It is ""something between death and life"". It is perfectly justified nowadays: the fuzzy logic. (Please search and read about it elsewhere because it is not easy to explain it here). 

Last: what we gain from this fuzzy logic type of life? A damn lot. Mind blowing. It is the logic that makes unrealistic things happen without breaking the realistic laws. Roughly: in fuzzy logic things can be true and false at the same time, or dead and alive, or real and unreal.",27,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

When asked: ""Lady Sansa, will you take this man?""
She steps next to.. Theon Greyjoy before 
answering: ""I take this(!) man.""

No tie used as in the wedding of the Seven Gods. In the faith of the old gods, man and woman stand side by side during the ceremony.

She does not even look at Ramsay Bolton.

All other rituals were cut off this scene.

Wiki ASOIAF:

""bride and groom join hands, kneel before the heart tree, and bow their heads in token of submission. When they rise following a moment of silent prayer, the groom removes the maidens cloak, and places the brides cloak around her shoulders, after which he will carry her to the feast in his arms.[29]The wedding ceremony is followed by a feast, which in turn is followed by thebedding.[29][33]""

But the next scene, upon entering the chamber, Sansa wears exactly the same cloak.

That's what Brand found out. That's why the gods will not doom Sansa for killing her sadistic ""husband"". And why Bran made this strange sounding statement to her in s7. Clever Bran.

Mine is the scene with Daenerys having visions in the House of the Undying, specifically from the moment she steps into the ruined throne room to the moment she steps into Drogos tent.

So apparently after the BotB the North is now independent again and Ramsey is now eaten alive by dogs, hurray. But it's just bad writing that Jon Snow would be chosen as the King of the North just because a 10 year old that hates sewing said so, while Ned Stark's eldest daughter, the trueborn daughter of Warden of the North and Lord of Winterfell and his heir (because Arya is still somewhere in the Narrow Sea sailing to Westeros and no one knows about Bran yet, he later abdicated anyway, so..) and the actual saviour of the North because she brought the Knights of the Vale to battle while Jon Snow was stuck between a pile of dead bodies and Bolton soldiers, is sitting right there.

And even worse, that Jon Snow dismantled the Kingdom of the North and renounced his crown just because he wanted to do his aunt and there appears to be no response at all from the Northern Lords, who have been fighting for their independence since the WotFK.

* Alexander the Great = Aegon the Great. Militarywise. Failed in the end to keep peace among his successors. Never named one specific heir, that led to civil war.

* Alexander the Great = Rhaegar. The connection to his friendship with Hephaistheon is a key element to his final failure, is a key element for GoT. Played instruments. Sang. Had the wisest advisors you could imagine. Failed in the end.


About 300 years later:

* Jon = Caesar, stabbed to death. 

And rised again as Augustus, conquering half the world and becoming the most successful of all roman imperators.

* Daenerys = Cleopatra? Her ""suicide"" could have been to willingly enter the snakepit Vaes Dothrak. To burn all the ""snakes"" at the House of the Dosh Khaleen. To rise again.

Cleopatra seduced Caesar, who was much older, was in love with Marcus Antonius, committed suicide before Augustus could execute her.

Both Caesarion and Marcus Antonius ""followed"" Caesar and Cleopatra in the line of succession, but failed to get to any throne. One failed finally, one's final fate is heavily debated.",23,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

This seems incredibly important considering the Targaryen's are sort of the purest representation of the early Andals while the Starks are the best modern representation of The First Men. Obviously The First Men and The Andals have been marrying and having children for centuries and neither family is uniquely Andal or First Men (man?) but it seems like Jon is the most unique union of the two ancient races.

The way GoT will end was right in front of our eyes the whole time. How Daenerys foreshadowed the whole GoT series and everything that's happened..

I would call my theory 'The wheel theory' 

To quote Danny:
 ""Lannister, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell. They're all just spokes on a wheel. This one's on top and that one's on top and on and on it spins, crushing those on the ground."" 
Now, that line may indicate nothing but we have seen game of thrones lines foreshadowing really important things in the future (Red wedding, Baratheon dynasty ending etc) So I think it may mean something. The 'spokes' on the wheel are the houses mentioned +Targaryen. The houses are in an order. Most houses suffer for a long time after they get 'crushed' for example, Baratheon, Stark and Targaryen suffer at the same time so the 'crush' indicates the point that a house starts it's bad point.

I think I also figured out the wheel's order:

Baratheon-Stark-Targaryen-Lannister-Tyrell

We start at the Targaryen at the bottom (After Robert's rebelion)

After Robert's death, the Starks end up at the low end and keep getting crushed untill the red wedding ends. The Lannisters are on their best with Joffrey as a king.

The Baratheon were getting crushed at the war of the 5 kings.. Renly died and Stannis got manipulated and lost important battles. This is the time the Tyrells are on top with Margaery pretty much controling everyone, the Tyrells were the winners for the most part without anyone realising it.

The next ones to hit rock bottom are the Lannisters at Cersei's walk of shame (and the Tyrells are close to rock bottom with Marg and Loras's imprisonment.) They were at their second lowest part at the time Tywin died and Tyrion leaves (It's not the worst part since the Lanisters are still ruling while on walk of shame there was only Cersei being pretty much depressed.) The Targaryen are at the top with Danny conquering Essos.

This is where the top end stops existing and being important and thus we care about the bottom. The Tyrells are at their worst with the sept getting blown away. Notice how the Starks are only getting better after their crush?

So in season 7, the Tyrells are still the victims with the complete end of their house. They were at the top for the most part so their crush was gonna be the worst (The bigger they are, the harder they fall)

So season 8 predictions: There are 2 out of the 5 houses that are out of the wheel (Tyrells and Baratheon) they only have bastards (Gendry and maybe a flower or two) so there is noone at the top atm.. The Lannisters are as strong as the Starks and it's the Targaryen's turn to hit rock bottom. So I believe that Danny will get preggo and die in childbirth or be assassinated a bit after her giving birth. The point is that she will die after giving birth to Jon's child. Now Jon is also a Targ and I think that he will also die. But Cersei will die first..

But can he? The Night King was captured and turned into some icy abomination thousands of years ago. The last Long Night was some 8,000 years ago, which ended in him being driven back into the desolate Land of Always Winter and trapped behind a wall. 

King's Landing was built about 300 years ago. **The Night King does not know King's Landing exists.** How would he? He didn't get weekly updates from down south. Most people didn't even think he existed. The same for pretty much all the major castles. Even Winterfell was built after the Long Night was over. 

So that's why I think the Night King cannot target anything. You can't target things you don't know about. 

As to why I think he *won't* target anything, I have this from D&amp;D.

&gt;  He's not really human anymore. Evil comes when you have a choice between that and good, and you choose the wrong way. The Night King doesn't have a choice; he was created in that way, and that's what he is. In some ways, he's just Death, coming for everyone in the story, and for all of us.

&gt;  He's just a force of destruction.

So these comments, along with what we've seen (him slaughtering anyone and everything without distinction) gives me the idea that he's not much of a tactician. I don't see him having anything by way of battle maneuvers or planned attacks. I think he's gonna swarm the North and kill everything he can get his hands on. 

You might say ""but but but he targeted the Cave of the Three Eyed Raven"" to which I say, because Bran gave him a map. 

So yeah, that's my speech. The Night King isn't coordinate an attack on King's Landing or anywhere, because he doesn't know where they are or that they even exist. So that's that on that.",19,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

I am currently doing my second rewatch of season 7. 

I get to the second to last episode, and I am watching the fellowship just smash through these ice zombies. Even towards the end, before the dragons showed, the fellowship slowly gets pushed back. Which is amazing considering they didnt immediately get swamped. One hundred thousand ice zombies, and they still didnt get the W.

Ice zombies suck....

And then I get to thinking, of the proud Lannister army, in sharp formation, shaking, as a horde of Dothraki come charging. I then think of the battle of the bastard, of the heavy cavalry, and the umbers, with their shield wall.

There are so many Ice Zombies....Like, an unbelievable amount, and getting larger, every moment.

Like so many zombies that it would be really awesome, if there was a place where their numbers wouldnt count for dick. Then I remember the neck, with the swamps and most cailin, with its long causeway.

Too bad its facing the wrong way. Causeway is the southern entrance, but ice zombies are coming from the north. The bloody gates are next, which actually is perfect, because even Baelish said it, a million men could storm the bloody gates, they would have to do it 6 men abreast and be slaughtered.

With fire, dragonsteel, or dragonglass, and we have a whole mountain of dragonglass.

Now, the AOTD would present a good challenge to the combined forces of the north plus the vale as is. 

But the AOTD even with an undead dragon, wouldnt stand no two strokes of an escorts hand, to the combined armys of all living men in Westeros.

You would have Jon, Jorah, the Hound, Breann, Bronn, The Strong fighters of the north, a well trained, well managed Lannister army, the Knights of the vale, motherfucking unsullied, who arent scared of shit. Im putting this sentence here because I am not sure of the correct punctuation to make that sentence work, and not run on. You would also have the Dothraki which is going to merc on some zombies. 

Plus three dragons, and a ridiculous green liquid that will torch anything.

If they would all just get along. The army of the dead would have been eliminated along time ago. In fact, if Ned was still alive, he would have heeded Lord Commander Mormont. He would have sent his army north of the wall and smashed the AOTD in its infancy.

If they would have just got along.  (Or if Brandon would have killed Baelish)

Tl/Dr .The army of the dead wouldnt even be a worry, if everyone could have just gotten along.

More screen time of Robert Baratheon, hunting etc. (Mark Addy was fantastic in this role)

More screen time of Ned Stark (including his ""promise me Ned"") dreams, this would have given a greater sense of mystery in season one.

More moments for Jon and Jeor Mormont 

Stannis sticking to his book roots (not burning his Shireen)

Ser Barristan may have still been alive

Jon Connington

More time for Danys relationship with her dragons to be shown (In the books each dragon has a unique personality)

Robb Stark marrying not just because of love but out of duty as he got his love pregnant after she cared for him from an injury. He married to prevent birthing a bastard.

Jeyne Poole marrying Ramsay instead of Sansa

Seeing Robb in atleast one battle

Stark characters other than Bran learning to warg

Theory:
So it's probably safe to hazard the guess that the Wight Army will reach King's Landing--based on the vision Daenerys had in the House of the Undying. I believe this is where the Wight Army will be destroyed. Wildfire fills the tunnels underneath King's Landing. The presumably massive Wight Army will breach the city, and its defenders--possibly Daenerys, Jon, and friends--will light the wildfire.  The defense of the city and resulting explosion will most likely kill the entire wight army as well as many of the city's defenders: the Hound, Tormund, Brienne,... Jon will probably fight on the ground, while Daenerys flies her dragons. Luckily, he is a Targaryen, which means he possesses ""fire resistance"" (not immunity).

What about Viserion? King's Landing is full of scorpions, ordered by Cersei to kill Daenerys dragon. I think the scorpions will be used to shoot Viserion to the ground, and something else will finish him off (the explosion?).

##Where our story begins:

The sea is finally calm, and the night breeze is cooling after the relentless sun. Water stretches as far as the eye can see in every direction but for once it is not tearing at the sails, not tossing the ship to and fro, not trying to drown the souls that dare to cross upon its back. No, tonight it is not a wildcat toying with its prey, tonight it is a lazy, purring thing, content to just playfully rock the wooden ship along its path.


*You remember that day like it was yesterday. The day that would plunge the Seven Kingdoms into war, the day that would tear families apart and see brother fighting brother. The day
dawned like a warm summer day, not unlike the countless other summer days that had passed before. Only it was still. Stiller than the darkest hour of night. Looking back, one could swear
even the gods were holding their breath. The storm descended with a ferocity that surprised even those who called it down upon Westeros.*


Stars twinkle like a million candles, winking in the darkness of the night. The night had always seemed lonely and cold to you, but weeks confined to the deck of a ship with not another living soul save the others trapped with you has taught you the real meaning of lonely. You have learned to welcome the night, for the darkness clouds the emptiness of the open ocean and brings sweet dreams of a home that now only exists in the land of dreams.


*The sky darkened early that day, for out of the Red Keep poured a conspiracy of ravens, black as the day itself. One cannot ignore the irony a flock of ravens is called a conspiracy, and a flock of crows is called a murder, and indeed many would come to believe that both visited Kings Landing that day. Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell, Warden of the North, and Hand of the late King Robert Baratheon, lost his head that day. But that was not all House Stark lost that day. Arya, youngest daughter of Eddard Stark disappeared that day, and her older sister Sansa was left an innocent lamb alone in a den of lions.*


Even the weathered sailors seem to relax into the calmness of the night. One brings out a stringed instrument and begins to strum a melancholic melody, one that sings of a lost love left on far away shores, one that plucks heavily at a persons heart. It stops your thoughts in their tracks and takes you back, back to a time that you would rather not remember, but it forces you to remember for a second before you can shove the memory away.


*Rumors flew faster than arrows in the weeks following the execution of Eddard Stark, dark little things that slithered like snakes across all seven of the Seven Kingdoms. King Joffrey was not the true son of Robert Baratheon, they whispered. No, he was no real King but the product of a crime that few dared say aloud. A dark, twisted love between his mother, the Queen Cersi, and her brother, Kings Guardsman Sir Jamie Lannister. These rumors flew like sparks and traveled faster than wild fire. Those sparks caught in the dry summer grass and ignited an uncontrollable fire. Robert left behind two younger brothers who, upon hearing the rumors claiming Joffrey no true King, set out to take the Iron Throne for themselves. Alas, they did not fight on the same side, and so another House was torn apart this time by war.*


You force your mind back to more pressing matters. Everyone has suffered something, why should you let yours haunt you? You are jolted out of your thoughts entirely at the first shouts of Land! Straight ahead!. It appears that you have reached your destination in one piece. The sea had her fun but the gods made sure she did not ask for too high a price. The Captain, after looking long and hard through his spyglass, declares that the ship will anchor on the open sea for one last night before entering the harbor in the morning.


*While other houses in the South chose sides, the North was also readying for war. Rob Stark, oldest son and heir to Winterfell, was named King in the North. The North had not taken the death of their Warden lightly, and after calling on his banner men, the new Lord of Winterfell also marched on Kings Landing. This Northern force included House Tully, brought into the fold by blood ties. Soon all the great houses are entangled. Balon Greyjoy of the Iron Isles renews his raiding with a new fire. House Tyrell sides with Renly Baratheon, consummated with a marriage. Meanwhile Stannis Baratheon places his faith in the God of Light. The Maesters of the Citadel have written this war down as the War of the Five Kings, a clash that will not soon be forgotten. But these old Maesters were not just sitting idly by. An ancient text was uncovered that told of a long forgotten island that harbors a heart more precious than gold, a heart of the most precious, coveted metal known to both Westeros and Essos Valyrian steel.*


The lands that lay behind you, the ones you left many nights ago, do not hold anything for you anymore those joys and wonders died long ago. The kings and queens may fight their petty wars but no longer will they concern you. For you, the only thing that matters now is the land that lies before you. A new land that may hold a new life for you. As you muse upon the events of the past year you cannot help but wonder what the Fates have in store for you, upon these strange shores

---

There is equal parts scheming and blood-shedding. There's a generous helping of sex. Dragons ripping each other to shreds. It's quintessential Game of Thrones and HBO.

It's a marketing department's dream. I can already think of a million angles they can use, and I'm just some bum on the internet. Brother vs Sister, King vs Queen, Man vs Woman. They could play up the sibling rivalry, they could play up the civil war, hell, they could even hype it up as some battle of the sexes.

Unlike the War of the Five Kings, where audiences generally were in agreement on who they wanted to win (Starks= good guys, Lannisters= bad guys), both sides in the Dance have their pros and cons. Audiences could essentially pick sides. HBO could hype this up on social media, telling viewers to tweet #TeamBlack or #TeamGreen to show their support, or something to that effect.

There would also be the element of familiarity that audiences would have with the locations. I, and I think many others, would get a kick out of seeing Rhaenyra glowering over the Painted Table on Dragonstone, knowing her descendant Daenerys would later do the same. It would be a kind of deja vu to see Aegon sit the Iron Throne instead of Joffrey, and Alicent to run the Small Council instead of Cersei. History doesn't repeat itself but it often rhymes, and viewers would eat that stuff up.

Cast Eva Green as Rhaenyra and Tom Felton as Aegon as the big names. They have established greek-cred and brilliant acting skills. Eva Green is ferocious and cold and sexy. Tom Felton can play bloodthirsty and petulant like none other. I would suggest someone along the lines of Helen McCrory for Alicent Hightower (her and Felton playing mother and son again would be funny).

The only drawback people like whinge on about is the CGI. To this I say: go watch seasons one and two. Those were lower budget, as opposed to later years, and they were still brilliant. They depicted a war we were all deeply invested in, without having any type of Bastardbowl-level budget. Besides, this might not even be an issue. If the last season does well (it will) and there seems to be significant interest in the prequel (there will), HBO will throw money at this. Clever writing and filming and millions of dollars will make sure this turns out just fine.

So yeah, that's my latest speech. Get on the winning team. This show is begging to be made. Hear me HBO.",15,46,False,spoiler,,,,,

More importantly I just wanted to play around with the unlikely idea or zero probability of the Arya we know truly never existing past her time in training as a Faceless Man. 

When Arya returns to Winterfell the guards tell het Lady Stark is in charge, she ask which Lady Stark. Now that isn't a big deal because she was just being cautious most likely. So much has happened that she has to plan her words accordingly.

Next, Arya and Sansa speak in the catacombs and Sansa tells Arya Something along the lines of Jon being so happy to see her and that when ""he sees [Arya] his heart will probably stop.""
Again, probably nothing but what if she stabs him with Needle or Littlefinger's dagger. 

Lastly, When Bran, Sansa, and Arya are all gathered together and Bran gives Arya the dagger that was meant to kill him he has this look on his face. Another moment that could be interpreted as something else. My original interpretation was The Three Eyed Raven was just able to see how much Arya has been through, who she has become, and what she has done and what she will do.
Or he couldn't see anything. Idk. Who knows.

It results in some pretty great butchered Nickafied names.

The only problem is one of them is ahead of the other in the show and the other one has read lots of spoilers on line, so they continuously spoil things for each other. 
One day my room mate was supposed to catch an early flight out of town. I woke up to the sound of the main theme blaring and I walked out in the living room. He told me he missed his flight so just came back and binged for hours. 

Anyway, I'm just enjoying having GOT playing in my house all the time and watching different episodes with them and hearing all these bizzaro names for my beloved characters.

I came to the conclusion that  she could be  the bleeding star under which Jaime would die and be reborn.  The lords of house Tarth are given the title Evenstar, and If Euron returns with the Golden company to take Storms End, he would have to sail past through Tarth where a battle could possibly  take place which could claim Its lords life. The death of Lord Selwyn Tarth Would make Brienne the Evenstar as his only living heir, thus falling in line with legend of AA.

In S5 Jaime and Bronn have a conversation about how they  would  want to go out, Jaime chooses dying in the arms of the woman he loves.

Well... this death could be literal, or metaphorical.
I predict the way Brienne is going to die (foreshadowed by  her comment to Catelyn Stark-(And when the Karstarks draw their swordsWho would want to die defending a Lannister?) is protecting Jaime (maybe from the Northern alliance when they would try to kill him after  Cerseis betrayal ) while suffering a mortal wound (he may get injured as well),and as he is holding Brienne in her last moments (or both of them are holding each other in their presumed last moments) he would  finally realize his purpose and what he has to do in order to save the living, and this realization making him a completely different person, in a way, reborn.

When Cersei is confronted by Jaime after she miscarried, crazed, defeated and broken, It dawns on her who the valonqar is, and that she cannot escape the witches prophecy, welcomes death by Jaime's hands. In this moment  his right hand is engulfed in flames as Cerseis soul merges with his golden hand creating Lightbringer, 
and their souls merging together to create Azor Ahai(Jaime and I are more than brother and sister. We are one person in two bodies).
And after Jaime dies killing the Night  King, they will leave this world as they came into it, together.

What do you think?

Cersi Lannister is pregnant and has broken up with Jamie Lannister. Her baby will be considered a bastard. Right now Jon Snow and Danyerous Targarian basically think that since her dragon Viseron died, death will pay for life like Mirri said. Daenerys will probably become pregnant with Jon's baby after they have boatsex. Through some course of events, I think that Daenerys's baby and perhaps Daenerys herself will die and Jon Snow will secretly undertake Cersi's bastard child as one of his own.


There are already theories that in the last episode Tyrion negotiated that if Cersi has her baby, that it will be the heir to the throne after Daenerys, and this logic just further confirms that. Tyion did look concerned as Daenerys and Jon went off to have boatsex. This will make the ending of the show have a sort of ""infinite loop"" thing going on, because this is similar to the situation between Ned Stark and Jon Snow at the beginning.

However I think he is still alive because they would not reintroduce a long lost character just to kill him or have him disappear again so we will see him again (I hope we do atleast). I believe he will have two roles when he arrives to WF he will of course forge Valryain steel (sorry if I butchered the name) for the battle. I also think he will reforge his Hammer but I also think will obviously have a friendship with Jon.

Mainly because they both believe they are bastards and also they may both know how that feels. However I think him forging steel and having a friendship with Jon is not the only reason he is back I think he has another role besides forging steel and being Bros with Jon I think there is another reason in my opinion...For Arya. I think when he gets to WF (IF he does) he will reunite with Arya and they may end up falling for each other and when the story is done Arya and Gendry will be lord and Lady of Stormlands (or King and queen of the seven kingdoms).

Now before you all stat it is fan service or I am crazy first I do not think it will be right away like they will not fall for each other right away definitely not and secondly here is some evidence.

Evidence:

- First I know it may seem like fan service at first but let's remember Jon and Daenerys got together in the books so if that was consider wishful thinking for awhile and still happened why couldn't this.

- They would not just bring him back JUST to forge steel (I am referring to the showrunners by the way) for a lot of reasons but mainly because they could find a lot of other smiths to forge the steel. Also then to be on a Wight mission. Yes there is being friends with Jon but Jon will be busy with other things.

- Okay now I will get to the more legitimate evidence. For starters in Season 3 Arya tells Gendry ""I will be your family"" With Gendry replying ""You will not be my family you will be my Lady"" Or something like that.

- Also When the actress who plays Arya was given the line she was told by the director to say it as if she was telling him I love you

- It fulfills Robert's wish in season 1.

- In season 1 Ned tells Arya ""You will marry a high lord and rule his castle""

- The Actress who plays Arya is a fan of the ship (and yes I know stuff from the actors is not good evidence but still).

- Gendry and Arya were both lifed lives of Lowborns Gendry was raised as a Lowborn and Arya has lived and associated herself with lowborn much of her life (shout out to CaveLupum).

- The actor who plays Gendry has stated he would like to see Arya and Gendry reunite. Stating that ""they seemed to get on. It was a nice banter between the two of them. It would be great to revisit that."" 

- Yes I am aware in the interview he also got into the elephant in the room. The 10 year gap. He is incredibly uncomfortable about the speculation of Arya and Gendry hooking up. Three things 1. This statement is his opinion which by Theory standards is not solid conformation of it not happening and for the showrunners and creator of the story (If they have them hook up) Does not really matter as he is not GRRM or D&amp;D he is an actor 2. The actress who plays Arya is no longer the age she was when filming season 3 3. There have been a lot of scenes where the actors may have felt uncomfortable (once again I know opinions of an actor are not good evidence but still).

While humans have fought one another for ages, White Walkers seem to be ""pure"" of fighting one another. I think this plays into why the Night King can only turn babies into White Walkers. Babies represent ""purity"", having just gained their humanity, and free of war. Since the Night King and the  Walkers were created to fight humans, maybe they were given a quest by the Children of the Forest that their mission was to stop the ""impurity"" of the humans, and therefore their magic only works on ""pure"" humans (newborns).

At the very least, I think that the White Walkers may represent a rescued, pure form of human, and that their goal is punishment against the humans for their warring, and their game of thrones.",11,6,False,spoiler,,,,,

I keep hearing about how the Dorne storyline was butchered in the show vs the books. But what were the original storylines that took place in Dorne that didn't get the best treatment in the show?

Other than Season 5's laughable episode, the Dorne storyline just seemed like a revenge story to tie up the plotline with Cersei's children and the witch's prophecy.

In the end despite dying in S1 it's Ned's advice and training from people like LF that helped Sansa. Catelyn allowed her to be trained into a piece of meat and let her be betrothed into a family of lions. It always frustrated me that she was already being manipulated before she even made it into KL.

Is my assumption too harsh or did I hit around the right ballpark? Because she and Arya have shown so much potential that I feel Catelyn let go to waste. Even Tywin, the sadist, didn't let Cersei grow into such a pussy. And he doesn't even love them like a normal parent.",53,59,False,spoiler,,,,,

Im not sure if this is pure coincidence or if it's more to it so that's why I'm asking you. 

So the first time Tyrion sees Drogon (during his boat trip true Valyria with Jorah) he almost drownes when he jumps overboard to save himself from getting infected from the stonepeople. He gets saved by Jorah eventually, but still, this drowning incident took place right after his first encounter with a dragon.

During spoils of war Jaime charges Dany with a spear and right before Drogon roasts him to ash he gets saved by Bronn who pushes Jamie down from horseback into the lake. The scene ends with Jaime drowning. He later manages to swim to shore with a little help from Bronn.

Jon (this is actually his fourth contact with the dragons) but during the epic battle beyond the wall he also gets pulled into the water by the dead and Dany and the other rides away on Drogons back. He manages to get up from the icy lake by himself, but later gets saved by Benjen who gives him his horse so Jon can ride away.

So how is it that these three characters almost end up drowning and why is a dragon(drogon) always present when these events occur? 

I have a theory of my own and that is that these events all somehow have shown the power of dragons. After Tyrion sees the dragon he somehow ends up believing in Dany and her cause and becomes her hand, Jaime ends up riding north to participate/fight in the great war and Jon bends the knee to Dany. 

So what do you think, are these events somehow connected and to they mean anything at all?",17,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

I started watching late last year after Season 6 ended and somehow had never gotten spoiled on anything including Ned and Baelor, the Red Wedding, the Purple Wedding, Blackwater, Shireen, the Trial of Ceresi Lannister etc...

My best friend is in the same boat as I was with having zero foundation of the series, but yet interested, and somehow not spoiled. To make things interesting, we have discussions after each episode and a tracking of every character he either loves, likes, feels neutral about, dislikes, or hates... and there's some interesting choices. So, after Season 1, Episode 1: Winter Is Coming, here were a few of his thoughts...
.
.
- He thought that the ranger shown in the first opening shot at Castle Black, in the middle (Yohn Royce's son, I believe) was going to be one of the main characters. That lasted long... haha.

- He loves Ned and Catelyn's relationship, and for some reason finds Jon dislikable. I was a huge fan of Ned and Cat, and didn't like Jon all too much in the beginning, but it is still always odd nowadays as I really like his character.

- He hopes Daenerys does not cross the Narrow Sea for Westeros purely because of her cunt brother. 

- He distrusts Joffrey because of his smirk... and that's about it so far. I'm trying to bring it to his attention about every character there is but he doesn't view Joffrey or The Hound or a few others as important yet... which is why they're missing from the list. (He'll probably add them come time)

- Tyrion is not one of his favorites, actually quite dislikes him but again I cannot begin to wonder why. The only Stark child he loves is Bran, while he likes Arya and Robb, and feels neutral about Sansa, disliking Jon and Theon (I know Theon isn't technically a Stark son, but I am counting him)

- Likes Jaime, dislikes Robert, and hates Ceresi. Interesting thoughts. When Bran was pushed, he absolutely despises Jaime and only dislikes Ceresi as apparently Ceresi seemed to not want Bran pushed. Again, still interesting.
.
.
Loves: Ned, Catelyn, Bran
Likes: Arya, Robb
Neutral: Daenerys, Sansa, Jorah
Dislikes: Robert, Ceresi, Tyrion, Jon, Theon, Viserys
Hates: Jaime 
.
.
I'm going to enjoy keeping track of this for him, and I'll make sure not to do every episode unless he feels it is purely necessary to update the list and his thoughts because who knows what will and will not set him off. I already like that he doesn't like Viserys, and he'll dislike him for only a short bit as it is. 

Looking back, I realized why that episode is so amazing to watch. Cheers!",5,9,False,spoiler,,,,,

So while she is walking through the House of the Undying, she opens a door and finds someone the iron throne.

&gt;Finally a great pair of bronze doors appeared to her left, grander than the rest. They swung open as she neared, and she had to stop and look. Beyond loomed a cavernous stone hall, the largest she had ever seen. The skulls of dead dragons looked down from its walls. Upon a towering barbed throne sat an old man in rich robes, an old man with dark eyes and long silver-grey hair. ""Let him be king over charred bones and cooked meat,"" he said to a man below him. ""Let him be the king of the ashes."" Drogon shrieked, his claws digging through silk and skin, but the king on his throne never heard, and Dany moved on.

&gt;Viserys, was he first thought the next time she paused, but a second glance told her otherwise. The man had her brother's hair, but he was taller, and his eyes were dark indigo rather than lilac. ""Aegon,"" he said to a woman nursing a newborn babe in a great wooden bed. ""What better name for a king?""
&gt;   ""Will you make a song for him?"" the woman asked.
&gt;   ""He has a song,"" the man replied. ""He is the prince that was promised, and his is the song of ice and fire.""
&gt;He looked up when he said it and his eyes met Dany's, and it seemed as if he saw her standing there beyond the door. ""There must be one more,"" he said, though whether he was speaking to her or the woman in the bed she could not say. ""The dragon has three heads."" He went to the window seat, picked up a harp, and ran his fingers lightly over is silvery strings. Sweet sadness filled the room as man and wife and babe faded like the morning mist, only the music linger behind to speed her on her way.

Obviously Aegon is Jon Snow like we have learned. Thats Rhaegar and Lyanna Stark. The song of ice and fire is referring to their houses (Kinda) Ice meaning Stark (North) and Fire meaning Targaryen. And finally Jon Snow is also the prince who was promised, sealing the deal. 

&gt;...Three heads has the dragon... the ghost chorus yammered inside her skull with never a lip moving, never a breath stirring the still blue air... mother of dragons... child of storm... The whispers became a swirling song... three fires must you light... One for life and one for death and one to love... Three mounts you must ride... one to bed and one to dread, and one to love... The voices were growing louder, she realized, and it seemed her heart was slowing, and even her breath... three treasons will you know... once for blood and once for gold and once for love.....

What does that mean? Can anyone count out the three for each?
In the book she figured the one for blood was Mirri Maz Duur and her Khal. Can anyone else fill in the blanks?

Yes he is no longer king but Bran could've seen Dany free the slaves of Slaver's bay and he understands what is coming just as much as Jon.

Arya would also be because of the Mad King thing but also that Jon was King of the north and that the North was independent and yet he gave that up giving it back to the Targaryens and on top of that she could see Dany taking Jon away from her.

So how could this play out. Could Sansa and Arya try to betray Jon? Would Arya really betray Jon? Will Jon find out about that bag of faces and her killing and maybe even Banish her for in his eyes Dishonoring Ned?

.....Well....Maybe....And Hell No. Okay I think Jon and the stark sisters may be in conflict but I think it would be quickly resolved as there is a real threat coming from further north. Also If Jon finds out about the bag of faces and also how she acted towards Sansa I'm pretty sure Jon will just ask her not to do something like that again which she is not with the faceless men any more so...yeah and also I think Arya could explain she was playing Game of faces with Sansa and she never intended to hurt Sansa (She ask Sansa if she was alright in season finale i'm pretty so she was doing that).

Also we could see some scenes with Dany, Arya, and Sansa that could have the two start to warm up to Dany. Now for Bran I already said he will probably be cool with Dany from the get go but he will probably have to explain to them the truth. When Jon finds out he may not be happy with the fact he hook up with his aunt. ",17,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

House Arryn - As High as Honor: Lysa is brought low when she reveals how little honour she has when she threatens Sansa and then rants to Littlefinger about all the bad things she's done for him. She's thrown 'down' the moondoor.


House Baelish: He has no house words does he? Probably because his word means nothing. Baelish picked the Mockingbird for his sigil, and you could say that he attempts to make himself seem small and nonthreatening to everyone else while whispering in everyone's ears (especially to Sansa in the end...) which wound up backfiring for him. Interesting that his actual house sigil is a fiery eyed Titan. You could say there's a correlation between the cold and ruthless man he was and the small but knowledgeable man he tried to appear to be.


House Baratheon - Ours is the Fury: Wasn't he drunk and pissed about the Lannisters when he went after that boar? More closely, he was killed by the Lannister wanting to escape his fury in finding out there incestuous secrets.


House Bolton - Our Blades are Sharp: They 'backstabbed' (blades) house Stark, then Ramsay stabs his father iirc.


House Greyjoy - We Do Not Sow: They're a bunch of killers not above killing each other to steal from others.


House Lannister - Hear Me Roar!: Tywin tried to threaten and talk down to Tyrion, Tyrion shot him. I think with the prophesy and 'wrap his hands around your throat' line, it might be Jamie choking Cersei after she, refusing to give up Kingslanding, is trying to order the caches of wildfire to be blown up. Or, more personally, perhaps after being at war Jamie's rather shell shocked, and Cersei giving him alot of abuse (physically?)  and screaming Jamie chokes her to death. This would be an interesting change of double standards (Women being abusive).


House Martell - Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken: We got how the prince of Dorne died in the show. It might be an indicator of how Dorne will largely stay out of the war in the books. It may indicate the Sand Snakes will not give up Dorne to Dany in the books. Historically they were the only province not to be defeated so Maybe Dany is advised against bothering with them at all?


House Stark - Winter is Coming: You could say that 'Winter' for the STark family kicked off early on when they separated, with Ned and the girls heading of for Kingslanding. It could indicate that the NightsKing and the Whitewalkers (who bring Winter with them wherever they go...) are going to be a big threat to the Starks.


House Targaryen - Fire and Blood: Dany's first death (rebirth) was when she came out of the fire with three dragons. I think the next is going to be her dying in childbirth, at least show wise. Danys last passage in the books seems to allude to fact that she is 'physically' capable of bearing a child. For a character that has had such a 'hero's journey' to die of something so 'simple' these days. Plus she'll never get to see her war won. 


House Tarly - First in Battle: They were the first 'notable' characters to die in the war with Dany. This was also the first battle in the war.


House Tully - Family, Duty, Honor: Catelyn and Ned both got their family in the line of fire by refusing to sit back and play the game and holding fast to to their principles. Catelyn theorised in the book that having to take Tansy Tea in order to abort her pregnancy lead to Lysa go more insane. Edmure in the show gives up hold of Rivverun to save lives (abandoning his family, duty and honour). Brynden the Blackfish dies refusing to give up fighting for his ancestral home (Riverrun).


TL;DR: Theories on how characters have and will die based on their sigils/house words. Jamie with kill a 'roaring' Cersei. Dany was reborn in fire, will die in a 'bloody' childbirth.",17,19,False,spoiler,,,,,

And also, theyre really ugly, the bad guys. ""


""I believe in gray characters, as Ive said before. We all have good and evil in us and there are very few pure paragons and there are very few orcs. A villain is a hero of the other side, as someone said once, and I think theres a great deal of truth to that, and thats the interesting thing.""

It would be odd if either GrrM in the books (that show will be based off of) or the showrunners (electing to change the story) ends his opus with a battle of evil, ugly Night King with little or no motivation (or dialog) vs good looking Jon Snow and Dany. 

It's not like his world was devoid of truly evil villains so it's not so out of the ordinary but I will say Joffrey had Tyrion fighting for him that we could have rooted for. Bolton took out Theon who we hated at the time...so from some points of view, they *might* have been considered to have good qualities for their people.

Still, I think when all is said and done, even if he has no dialog the meaning of the Night King will have to be more than just death, evil and an enemy to be vanquished. I don't subscribe to the Bran theory but I do think Bran and him having a connection serves a purpose. If it proves true that he has the same power as Bran and in 8,000 years has seen the evil man has committed he would be even more detached than Bran and see Westeros as a huge threat. 

If the Night King was aware of the violent nature of Westeros and the Lord of Light's constant preaching that he is an enemy, he might assume, in the interest of crowning a king they might create an army to launch an attack on him beyond the wall. The Night King might just be making a preemptive strike to an attack he assumed will come based on rhetoric and the general way Westerosi people invade and kill each other. Unifying people against a common enemy is fairly common in Westeros and history. 

Ironically Jon, our hero, has appeared to be the only one not blinded by the oncoming threat but it could be the rallying of forces against the Night King that is what spurs him forward. Now this wouldn't make him good at all, just another being trying to survive (as the Children were) that doesn't want to be a victim of genocide, which is definitely their intent if they see him as pure evil. After all if Cersei and Jon who are both human can't even come to an accord when faced with a bigger threat, there is no way they would ever make peace with the Night King if they knew he existed.

I've pieced together that Lyanna was about 16 years old and 10 leagues (about 35 miles) from Harrenhal when she encountered Rheagar, Arthur Dayne, and Oswell Whent. Harrenhal incidentally belonged to the Whents at the time.

Why was Lyanna there and who was she with that she could disappear without family, guards, servants, or ladies in waiting attempting to intervene? There are no reports of bloodshed that I could find, which is understandable because that would have removed the ambiguity that GRRM built into the story, but then again where were these witnesses? It's almost like Lyanna ran off on her own, however unlikely that seems. If there were Stark witnesses, they'd either have seen violence or seen Lyanna run off willingly... but we don't hear either way.

The location is all wrong too. Close to that time (I can't tell how close) her brother Brandon was on his way to Riverrun for his own wedding. We know this because Brandon detoured and never made it to Riverrun when he learned his sister was missing. Riverrun is east-north-east of Harrenhal and directly south of the Twins. You would not pass Harrenhal to get to Riverrun, yet isn't Riverrun were Lyanna should have been headed? And wouldn't she have been headed there along with the rest of her family?

S7E7 of the series mostly clears up the abduction vs. elopement question but it leaves major questions about how Lyanna ended up where she did without anyone knowing, how her family and retainers lost track of her, and how Brandon so quickly concluded she was kidnapped when all he could really have known is that Lyanna ran away. He should have expected her at Riverrun, probably with his own retinue, or if not that with a small retinue of her own.

Is anyone able to stitch this together so that the Starks' actions make more sense?

Her motivation seems to be to bring Stannis to power, but really her motivation is to serve the Lord of Light. His goals **are** her goals, but she doesn't know what they really are, as she often states.

In the end, I think she's basically a Gollum character -- one that seems on the surface to be a bad guy/girl, and works against our (seeming) heroes, but in the end the good guys would never win without him/her.

Basically, I think she's nothing but a tool of Rhllor. I think Rhllor's goal is to get mankind to follow Jon or Dany (or both), and so ""his"" motivation is to get rid of whatever stands in the way of that.

If a Baratheon takes the Iron Throne, then Jon, with all of Ned's honor, would never take it from him. He would probably even help defend a Baratheon against a Targaryen. There are 2 Baratheons, and I think Renly was more likely to be chosen by the people (as if that mattered), so Melisandre gets rid of him first. What's interesting is that Stannis *always* gets the blame for this, when in reality it's almost entirely Melisandre's doing. Stannis just brought the sperm.

With Renly out of the way, Stannis has to go next. This takes a lot of doing, as he's able to muster some serious armies and navies, but eventually it's accomplished. 

Then, in Stannis' weakest moment, when he begins to lose faith because of the sacrifice of his daughter and the desertion of his armies, she abandons him. It looks like she's running away from a bad situation, but in reality Rhllor has called her to where she's more needed -- to revive Jon ~~Snow~~ Targaryen.

She said something on the show (I think most of the previous theories fit the books as well, although obviously much of this is past the end of the last book) to Varys about how she had completed her task of bringing Jon and Dany together, so she's leaving for her final task. So by that point even *she* realizes that her goal was their coming together and into power. Does she realize at this point that she was just screwing Stannis all along for the Lord of Light? Is that what her big ol' lady scene was about?

I don't think any of this is some huge revelation to many of you, but more evidence of it has been popping into my head lately, so I wanted to get it all down in words. 


tl;dr - Melisandre was always (And probably unknowingly) following Rhllor's bidding to get rid of the Baratheons to clear the path for Jon/Dany's leadership.


[edit] Also, when Aemon is dying, he says, ""The sword is wrong, she has to know that ... light without heat ... an empty glamour ... the sword is wrong, and the false light can only lead us deeper into darkness"" while speaking of Stannis' fake ""Lightbringer"" bit. Did she know?

Also, Rhllor's nemesis, his ""devil"" if you will, is the Great Other, also known as ""the god of ice and death.""",10,10,False,spoiler,,,,,

I know this is way out there but it is something that just came to mind, then blew my mind, and I would really love some feedback on this nut case insane crazy theory. 

We all know the epic jaw-dropping finale of season five where Jon Snow gets killed by his own trusted brothers at the wall. In the next season he is then supposedly revived by the red priest and her magic. 

What if Jon really is still dead and Arya is now wearing his face? 

It doesn't really show a timeline or much about Arya when she leave Braavos. What if she made her way the wall got Jon's face and if now living out as him? During season 5, they spend a lot of annoying damn time on Arya and the faceless men and then Jon dies at the end. 

Arya and Jon probably have the first and most heartfelt relationship out of any two characters. The whole story in the books and series has focused on the idea that Arya is a little girl that people underestimate and she always believes and proves that that she shouldn't be under estimated. Maybe she is more underestimated. 

Some people believe that the Lord of Light and the Faceless Men are connected in some way. What if their magic is actually faceless men magic? What if faceless men were actually in charge of killing Renly for example. 

There may be even more foreshadowing or details that I may have missed that someone else could provide. But I think it is a pretty out there theory that would be cray cray. 

I know there is a ton of holes in this theory such as Jon and Arya being in two different places at the same time and Dany banging it out with Jon but it is still fun! What is some feedback???

I absolutely love her character, and can't really fathom why she is so disliked among the fandom. Her character is so richly written, and has such a strong arch it's remarkable. The only other comparison to make would be Jaime Lannister. And her arch comes full circle in this episode IMO...Allow me to explain;

Dany starts off much of Season 1 as this naive, sheltered, innocent, vulnrable, quiet little girl. She is thrust into a marriage because of her abusive brother, where she is raped and can't even communicate with her own husband. She starts developing strength. Inner strength. Determination to persevere (similar Stark traits). She learns a new language, adapts to a new society, and even begins to be able to hold influence over her king husband.

Her trusting nature gets the better of her, and much of this is stripped away. But then, her fire awakens her three children. From here on, Dany is truly powerful.

Many say she uses this power for selfish gain, and she's reckless, idiotic and possibly crazy with what she does. She tried ending slavery. It DOESNT just happen over night. Sometimes she had to be ruthless to those who threatened or disobeyed her (Kraznys, Merrenese Masters, that former slave who killed a captured harpy behind her back). All of these people were guilty of a crime, and she delivered justice in whatever way she knew how. She never harmed an innocent person.

Her perceived arrogance and righteousness are a direct effect of her needing to fight for what is hers. And the Iron Throne (as far as she or anyone besides Bran Sam and Howland Reed knows) is hers! But she is not her brother. She does not expect it to be given to her. She is fighting for it, while also fighting for what's right (Ending Slavery, killing Night King). In reality, she still has some of that scared little girl we met in the beginning in her core. She is just incredibly selective with who she shows it to, because in this world, you simply cannot look weak.

My favorite scene in Season 7 was with her and Jon on the boat after BTW. She personally witnessed his heroism. She saw the scars on his body. And yet this man, who was proclaimed king by his people, who sacrificed himself for them time and time again, had proclaimed Dany his Queen. Because SHE sacrificed herself, and her dragons, to help the North when no one else would. What an endorsement.

Was her response an arrogant ""It took you long enough"" or ""Write a letter to your people and demand they do the same""? No. It was a very vulnerable, very sincere, ""I hope I deserve it"". 

I believe Dany will die next season without getting the chance to fully rule. In her vision at the house of the undying, she reaches out to touch the throne but just when she is about to touch it, she goes north beyond the wall and ends up with Drogo. That is just how Season 7 went. She could have won the throne very quickly, but chose something more important instead.

She is a hero. She is someone to look up to, and I'm sick of seeing all these people call her an entitled bitch. Even though Jon Snow is still my favorite.",653,3316,False,spoiler,,,,,

Two bastards vying for the Iron Throne. Like the common joke is that bastards can't really do anything or go anywhere in life. Now, we have two possible bastard children with one destined to become the most powerful person in Westeros. This can also coincide with part of Maggy's prophesy because someone young and beautiful will cast her down and take everything she holds dear. At this point, since all her other children are dead, the only thing Cersei wants is the throne. And who, usually called young and beautiful, can take that from her? A child. A child of the true King and Queen. (Or even her own. Killing her like Tyrion did with their Johanna, their mother, in childbirth, but that feels a bit forced for me.)

The rest is just from what I heard.

------

Late for the party and only typing this cus after a quick google search I didn't find anything. But as usual, probably not the first one.

My first thought on how to fullfil the prophecy in the most unexpected way was that she might be pregnant to a handicapped son, not necessarily  a dwarf, of course. 

So ""When your tears have drowned you"" might refer to after discovering her son is handicapped. Denying his existence or even asking him to be killed. Similar to hers own feelings towards Tyrion.

Then ""the Valonqar [Valyrian for 'the little brother'] shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you"", supposedly Jaime or Tyrion, both proved sympathy for the handicapped.

Basically ""having"" three kids is a play on words. A A perfect example is that for Tywin, Tyrion was never his son.

And that would also validate the theory that Gendry is Cersei's son. All that talk about ""beautiful black haired boy"", ""never visited his crypt"" was very irrelevant but too detailed. And even Gendry himself seems completely irrelevant to the series, but appears way too much.

What these actors have in common is their interactions with Arya Stark. Rory is the greatest Hound that could have been cast and he portrays the character beyond perfectly. Charles Dance likewise really emphasized the early books theme of moral ambiguity. His Tywin was so delightfully acted that I feared him, respected him, and began to (almost) root for the Lannisters while he was head honcho. Gwendolyn is of course the only actress that could have been Brienne, who else is a 6+ foot woman with acting experience? Like Tyrion the casting was preordained, but like Dinklage Gwen knocks the character out of the park. 

All of them have a delightful interaction with Arya. The relationship between Arya and Sandor is so well written and well acted. 

The season two scenes between Tywin and Arya are the high point of that season. You begin to see Tywin both as a monster and as a human. My personal headcanon is that he knew all along she was Arya Stark and was just playing along. 

We have had two scenes with Brienne and Arya, but theyre both perfect. The sparring scene is the moment when Arya finds a new mother character. 

There are others of course, Sansa and Arya, Jaqen and Arya, Yoren and Arya, Beric and Arya, etc, but these are the most memorable interactions. Sandor and Brienne discussing Arya in s7 was a high point of the season. 

Maisy Williams is of course perfect as Arya too. Her perfect portrayal of Arya is part of what enhances these actors amazing scenes with her. ",20,35,False,spoiler,,,,,

I just love the simplicity of what Jaime was trying to communicate with Cersei, and yet she once again is too stubborn to comprehend that concept. I thought the actor handled that line masterfully, because you can tell that Jaime is getting frustrated and fed up with having to reason with her and is disgusted that she is willing to let humanity perish if it means she still has power.

Jaime was completely right, if the Night King wins, he will head South, the rest of the world and kill everything in his sight and with a dead Viserion now under his control his chances are even greater. If the living wins, even if they lose a lot of numbers, people will look up to Jon, Dany and Tyrion for being heroes that saved the world and will gain more support, and when they find out Cersei did nothing and planned to double cross them people will help them eliminate her.

I already made a post on which one will die if you want to check it out https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/75caal/everything_which_stark_will_go_next/

But today I will be talking about a theory/prediction I have for the stark sisters. So not to long I read a article where Alan Taylor implied that one of the stark girls may die. I later found out this was for Season 7 and of course it ended up not being true as the violent thing he was referring to was actually the death of Littlefinger. But it got me to thinking in season 8 could one of the stark sister be the last stark to go to the moon of moons to reunite with the other starks at Khal Drogo's afterlife Party.

Now I don't want any of them to die to be honest but this is Game of thrones a show that is known for killing of beloved characters even ones that just wanted to live a happy life (Hodor) and in the show's case characters that should've stayed alive longer (Cough Barristan Selmy Cough). That and I could not let the thought torture me any longer so I thought up a interesting prediction for S8. 

So when the white walkers attack WF either Jon riding Rhaegal or Dany on Drogon could ride to WF and get Bran, Lyanna Mormont (if she is there at the time), and maybe Meera and Howland Reed (remember this is just my prediction NOT actual fact) But anyways there is only room on the dragon for one more person. Either Sansa will stay behind and make sure Arya gets on the dragon or Arya will stay behind and Vice Versa. if Sansa stays behind she would pretty much sacrifice herself somehow I was thinking wildfire but idk how there would be any in WF unless Jaime brings some. If Arya stays she would fight off some of the white walkers and get killed by one of them or the Night King.

If Sansa stays to die she would be doing what her direwolf did (her direwolf dying due to them not finding Nymeria and it having to be punished in it's place. Correct me if i'm wrong by the way) In this case Sansa would be sacrificing herself to safe her sister life. Also it would be sort of her sacrificing herself for her family though if Arya dies it be also that but it also kindof come full circle with her arc as it was forshadowed by Jon long ago in the books and also it maybe fitting that she dies to live on through Nymeria.

Okay I did not think this out to much obviously but what do you think?",11,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

Forgive me if this has been mentioned before. 

I have been pondering over S07E06 for a while and have just thought of a way in which Daenerys and her dragons could have made it to the Snow Patrol without the whole Gendry running back to Eastwatch, raven flying all the way to Dragonstone, then Daenerys flying to the squad just in time. Targaryens have a bond with dragons that no-one else does. Earlier in the season we see Jon have a moment with Drogon that even surprises Daenerys, this is obviously because he himself has Targaryen blood. Now throwback to season 5 when Daenerys is saved by Drogon in the Great Pit. He obviously sensed that she was in danger in some way through this bond that Targs have with the dragons. So would it not have made a bit more sense and perhaps even been a bit cooler if this had been the case with Jon being saved beyond the wall. Perhaps Jon could have 'bonded' with one of the other dragons (say Rhaegal) in that scene where Daenerys arrives back to Dragonstone after the Spoils of War episode (could have still had Daenerys watching the two intrigued). Then when Jon and co were in danger beyond the wall, instead of the scene where Daenerys has just received the raven and leaves to go beyond the wall we could have had a moment where Daenerys is overlooking her dragons on Dragonstone, one of them (say Rhaegal) starts acting strangely as he senses Jon is in danger and suddenly flies off with Viserion following. Dany sees this and hops on Drogon to follow (i agree this part seems a little sketchy but you get the general idea of where I am coming from) and the rest is as we have seen.

I think this could have taken care of the whole controversy with event timing in the episode and would still have the overall outcome of Dany seeing the army of the dead, NK getting hold of a dragon, and the squad escaping with the wight etc. Also, I think part of the issue with the message getting to Dragonstone isn't just about timing but also the fact that in previous events beyond the wall you always get the sense that the characters are on their own with no chance of being suddenly helped at the last minute should something go wrong, unless something supernatural intervenes (3ER sending Benjen/Coldhands). I personally can look past the timing issues, well except maybe the raven message reaching Dragonstone in time given the insane distance from Eastwatch. This idea would have obviously needed more thought put into it than I have provided (particularly the last part) but I think the general concept of the dragon(s) sensing Jon was in danger could have been interesting. Maybe you could argue that this would have given away the whole Jon being full targ or something before the show fully confirmed in the finale. Or maybe you could just say this whole idea is completely ridiculous but hey, the off season period is boring af. Just trying to raise some semi interesting points.",22,160,False,spoiler,,,,,

In the efforts to fight, naturally, there will need to a leader in the fray which undoubtedly appears to be Jaime's role in battle (as evidenced by S7E4). I'm assuming Jon and others will survive the battles north, and that Jaime will play a critical role in taking down the NK - either directly, or indirectly via the creation of a distraction.

The context for the scene would likely be Jaime's place at the Vanguard of the army, placed there by Dany (similar to Tyrion's placement by Tywin earlier in the show).

There are many ways this can be set up...but it would make for an unforgettable moment if there's a scene where Dany looks to Jaime and says,

""You're a Kingslayer. Be a Kingslayer.""

A simple line, but it can be a short little dialogue echoing that of Lady Tyrell's advice to Dany in S7. It also comes full circle with Tyrion's line in the pilot. 

For Jaime's character arc, I couldn't think of a heavier moment than to hear that line coming from the Mad King's daughter.",32,68,False,spoiler,,,,,

This was made all too evident when HBO announced there would be multiple endings just to make sure to confuse anyone who catches wind of certain scenes while they are filming, etc.

It seems like everything we've all said gets quoted by the media as well. There's been a million times where a Yahoo! article actually sites a reddit user on a theory, etc.

I'm not complaining but I think for a lot of people, we will just find it sort of vindication when the season finally airs sort of how the true identity of Jon Snow was announced, for example.",4,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Naturally, expectations are high. The seven seasons of this show have set a precedent and Season 8 has a lot to stand up for if it's to deliver a satisfying conclusion, and personally, I'm hoping the writers cover as many loose threads as they can. Here's what I'm hoping this season touches on. I'm sure I'm leaving out a ton so leave what you want as well.

- The culmination of Arya's training. No One should be left on her list by the end  
- The culmination of Bran's training. He won't walk again, but it'd be great to see what happens when he does fly.
- The true motives of the White Walkers and what they want for Westeros.
- Quathe from Season 2 and what she was talking about since she was very prophetic.
- Melisandre's backstory and master plan.
- Of course, the relationship between Jon and Dany once Jon realizes who he is.
- Just to keep it subtle, it stars with C and ends with ""blegane bowl""
- Full character arc for Brienne, Jaime, and Tyrion, specifically.

Like I said, I've probably missed a lot.

Edit:
Less emphasis on taking the black.

Main point: Snow renounced any claim as an heir. (Even if he was a legit Targ).

Support: Therere are no legal take-backs, even regarding the line of succession.
(Except as someone noted: by royal decree, and Jon became kingindanorf so it very well may be moot). 

Controversy: Bran said, hes the heir to the iron throne, which I think is technically wrong due to prior point.

My initial thought was that if it wasn't Game of Thrones themed, I probably would already have put it down.

I haven't experienced anything to do with war yet either, so I'll be interested to find out what that's like.

We see/ hear the theories of Tyrion being a secret Targ.

Is it possible that all of Tywins children were Targs?

I mean, the Twins exhibit the perfect Targ dichotomy: great  leader or insane ruler.  Maybe it was arranged between the families if Tywin was Sterile or injured ""south of the border"" to provide Lannister heirs....the families were fairly close at that time.
There were really no other great Lannister warriors of note, none that mattered anyway.
That sort of frustration could surely lead a man to drown an entire family in their sub-terrainian castle.

Or could Tyrion be the only trueborn Lannister and that fact along with his physical maladies have been the reason Tywin hated him?   Could the story of Lann The Clever be a tip to Tyrion's Lannister heritage and the source of his own cleverness?

Needless to say Ive had some shower thoughts concerning how the histories might impact the story.

One of these thoughts is while rare, there are certainly more dragons eggs out there. With Daenerys already showing she can hatch dragon eggs, couldnt these eggs come in to play? If you were Daenerys, wouldnt you select a trusted agent (Varys isnt doing anything important right now) to track down and procure these eggs? Here are just a few that are rumored to still be around:

**Kings Landing:** The last dragon born to the Targaryens died in 153 AC. Before her death she had a clutch of 5 eggs. Arlan of Pennytree (Duncs old master) saw the dragon and her eggs in Kings Landing the year before she died. 

**Dragonstone:**  The hatcheries under Dragonmont volcano may still contain eggs. Perhaps in addition to this there is rumored to be a cache of dragon eggs on the island or in the castle. Aerys II (the Mad King) tried to hatch eggs from a number he found in the depths of Dragonstone. These may or may not be from the cache or the hatcheries, but more interestingly is how recent this would have been. Aerys II ruled from 262 to 283 AC. Events in Game of Thrones Kick off around 289 with the death of Robert Baratheon. 

**Summerhall:** Aegon V (Egg) made a disastrously unsuccessful attempt to birth dragons at Summerhall in 259 AC. Archmaester Gyldayn says that 7 eggs were present for the attempt. Might they still be there, among the ruins? 

**Shadow Lands:** Although he may not be a reliable source, Illyro Mopatis tells Daenerys that her 3 eggs are from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai. If true, that adds another location and also means these eggs dont subtract from the number of the Westeros eggs.

**Winterfell:** Yes, Winterfell. Mushroom, court fool to numerous Targaryens, claims Vermax left a clutch of eggs in the Winterfell crypts at the beginning of the war between the Blacks and Greens. Maesters discount the story, but fools like Mushroom and Patch Face are often surprisingly prophetic.

**Vale:** Yup, the Vale too. I did say there where a lot of eggs Rhaena Targaryen brought 3 eggs to the Vale during the civil war of the Blacks and Greens. One may have hatched and become her dragon, Morning. The fate of the other 2 is unknown.

**Greyjoy Egg:** Euron Greyjoy claims he had an egg but threw it into the sea in anger. I dont believe that. Perhaps he never had an egg, but if he did I dont think he threw it away.

**Whitewalls:** Lord Butterwell offered an egg as a tourney prize at Whitewalls on the occasion of his daughters marriage. Whitewalls was razed to the ground by Brynden Rivers (Bloodraven) when Butterwall was discovered to be a Blackfyre sympathizer. Brynden Rivers is suggested to have position of the egg when he states it was taken by his agent of his and is safe.

**Unhatched Targaryen Eggs:** It was the custom of the Targaryens for generations to place a dragons egg in the crib of newborn Targaryens to see if it would hatch. An accounting of all of these eggs does not exist. But we know of several from the war of the Blacks and Greens which were unhatched and their whereabouts are not known: Viserys II, Maelor, Eleana, Daeron, Aerion, and Aemon (yes *that* Aemon), and Rhea and/or Daella.

**Missing Dragons:** Nettles and her dragon, Sheepstealer were last seen flying over the Bay of Crabs. Nettles fled when Rheanyra named her a traitor for becoming Daemons mistress. The Cannibal, a wild dragon who never had a rider, also survived the civil war but was never seen again afterwards. These two are not known to be male or female, but neither are people sure how dragon reproduction works anyway. 

Does anyone know of any more eggs out there? Am I right that Dany should be looking for more eggs, particularly now that we know her dragons are vulnerable? It would also be a blow to her ego if someone else (maybe a Celtigar or Velaryon) hatched a dragon now that magic is back in the world. Could the Winterfell eggs exist, and what would happen if a Jon came across them?

Edit - For completeness I'll add **The Ruins of Valyria:** The home to dragons before the doom, there may still be eggs and other treasures. Several Westerosi have travelled to Valyria, but only Euron Greyjoy has been there and returned. Assuming he can be believed. Book Euron has a dragon horn from Valyria with him at the King's moot.

Daenerys will die, thats the bittersweet ending, she has to die.

I dont like the idea of her dying, but it is what it is. There's no way Jon and Dany end up together with kids at the end.

We've all heard the nissa nissa prophecy, we've seen dany's visions of the broken red keep with snow falling on the iron throne.
Its meant to happen.

But at the end of the day, we know that killing jon snow again is not even something a sadistic would think. The poor lad has suffered enough.

After Dany dies, there's only one female character that could end up with Jon. His cousin.

Dont think I didnt notice the way Jon promised to protect Sansa from Ramsay. Swoon! Now previous to season 6, I have to admit that I didnt consider Jon and Sansa as a couple much at all. 

They barely have had any mention together, even in season 1 when they were both at Winterfell together. Sansa was a far different character then than she is now. She was far more superficial and concerned about appearances and things that ultimately didnt matter. 


She learned some hard lessons in her time at Kings Landing and afterwards, when given over to Ramsay Bolton. Most of all, she learned how to be strong and independent and about what really matters in life. 

Family matters to Sansa now, more than it ever has before. Jon, too, has grown up. Hes learned how to be a warrior, how to defend and fight for the things that matter. As it so happens, what matters to him is also family. That is something they have in common. Perhaps they could fight for family, together,as a family.",24,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Thinking back to the scene where Brienne approaches Davos and Melisandre at Castle Blackmainly to gloat about having personally killed Stannis following his defeat outside WinterfellBrienne enters the conversation with *'I saw what happened'* immediately after Davos presses an evasive Melisandre on what happened to Shireen. 

Davos is immediately interested in hearing what she has to sayunderstandably, given that she is a supposed eyewitness, and seems willing to be more candid than Melisandreand politely introduces himself. Brienne cuts him off by reminding him that they had met once before, not long before Renly was killed. Long story short, she provides no information about Shireen, and walks away immediately after dropping the 'bombshell' news of Stannis's death. Melisandre, probably seeing an opening to get away from Davos's questioning, walks off seconds later.

Here's the thing: Davos had no definitive evidence at that point to suggest that Shireen was dead; when Davos first presses Melisandre on this, her only response is a grim, wordless expression, which seems to confirm Davos's worst fears.

An ominous sign, to be sure, but not a confirmation. The fact that Melisandre returned to Castle Black alone might suggest that she split once she realized that Stannis's chances for victory were hopeless, but didn't stick around long enough to see the worst of it firsthand. And although Davos is naturally inclined to distrust Melisandre, it's not impossible to see him coming to the conclusion that she might genuinely *not* know anything meaningful, and is sheepish and evasive because she feels guilty about abandoning Stannis to his fate. (Which I think she probably was). 

For the sake of argument, let's say that Davos decided then that Melisandre simply didn't know because she fled before the big battle. If she won't say with any absolute certainty that she watched Shireen die and/or saw her dead body, it would open up the remote possibility that Shireen might still be alive. If Shireen is alive, then she's almost certainly in great danger, either trying to fend for herself (a grim best-case scenario) or has been taken captive by the Boltons (worst-case scenario).

Davos is well-aware of House Bolton's reputation for cruelty at this point, as he referenced this early in S5 while trying to convince Jon Snow to leave the Night's Watch and join up with Stannis against the Boltons. *('So long as the Boltons rule the North, the North will suffer').* That's bothersome enough to him in abstract, but the possibility that they could be abusing a girl he regards as a surrogate daughter in the cruelest ways imaginable? One would think that the possibility, however remote, would drive him crazy, and put him on a warpath.

So let's say that Davos decides to catch up with Brienne after she leaves, and implores her to tell him any hint(s) she might have learned about Shireen's fate, even if she thinks such details meaningless. Brienne, already inclined to dislike and distrust Davos, probably wouldn't know what to make of that request, perhaps assuming (not unreasonably) that Stannis left Selyse and Shireen back at Dragonstone when he sailed north, and accusing Davos of trying to trick her.

Knowing Brienne, however, it's difficult to see how she wouldn't be at least somewhat receptive if Davos made a pitch like, *'Look, hate me, hate Stannis, hate Melisandre all you want; you have your reasons. But Shireen is just a kid, she didn't do anything wrong. I'm telling you that Shireen was at Stannis's main camp when he sent me to Castle Black; I even tried to convince him to let me take her with me, but he refused. I couldn't care less about the political angle at this point, but if there's even the slightest chance that she's still alive, she's in trouble, and I'm going to do anything and everything in my power to rescue her, with or without your help. But please, if you know anything, it might just be the difference between life and death for this girl.'*

Again, it's hard to see how something like that wouldn't give Brienne some pause; she prides herself on maintaining and living up to a high moral/ethical code, and a key part of that code is her determination to protect the innocent who can't defend themselves. Brienne seems especially protective of young women and girls in this sense, evidenced by her exhaustive efforts to find the Stark girls and bring them under her protection, and her earlier decision to give a proper burial to a trio of lynched tavern girls, despite Jaime's warning that taking the time to do so would jeopardize her mission. (Which it does). 

I'm certainly not suggesting that Brienne would want to drop everything and try to track down Shireen, but if Davos had appealed to her like this, it might have softened her views on him a bit, as opposed to her regarding him as a slippery character just because of his long affiliation with Stannis. A parallel with Brienne's changing opinions of Jaime Lannister, whom she eventually came to regard as an *individual* beyond the common narrative of Jaime as the amoral 'Kingslayer.'

Admittedly, I might be putting too much stock in this, but I still feel like it would have been made interesting material for both characters. They could have had Davos present at the dining room scene where Jon receives and reads aloud Ramsay's 'Pink Letter,' where he boasts of having Rickon Stark as his hostage, and where a mention of Shireen would be notably absent. Cut to an expression from Davos that is at once pained and relieved, and a vaguely sympathetic expression toward Davos from Brienne.",6,7,False,spoiler,,,,,

So a friend and I decided on the fly to host one ourselves on our college campus. We'd been planning this since July, but had to put it on the back burner due to exams and a host of other stuff. Now, although end-semester exams are around the corner, we kept today aside as being a possible feasible option.

And it went... well! Super well! We had some pretty obscure fundas as well (we'd included the YouTube History and Lore videos to compensate for not asking book-related questions) and saw a decent turnout. It was fun and engaging and I'm wishing I could do something like this more often!

We had, apart from Q&amp;A style trivia questions + pounce/bounce for the top seven final teams, some fun Jeopardy!-esque round, a charades round to sustain interest, and some visual connects. Some questions are in the comments.

What sort of other stuff could we do next time to improve the experience? I'm hyped for more!",18,17,False,spoiler,,,,,

Frankly it has almost nothing to do with the Sword of the Morning himself.

&amp;nbsp;

My issue is with his redheaded companion who is seen at the start of the fight sharpening his sword. Apparently, this man is Ser Gerold Hightower, the *Lord Commander of the Kingsguard*. When the Northern companions meet the Kingsguard knights beneath the Tower, we finally meet the Sword of the Morning and his sworn brother. Keep in mind, Dayne was **not** the Lord Commander when he died, so why isn't the redheaded guy who's supposed to be Hightower doing the talking? ***He's the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, not Arthur Dayne!*** 

&amp;nbsp;

So my question today is about mutually making their marriage an open one.

 If after seeing him whore and make bastards for a year or two, Cersei outright aired her grievances and asked for his official permission to 'cheat' herself would he have allowed it?

 Of course he would probably stipulate that she take precautions so as to not make a bastard (too late by then if I'm remembering right) and to not do it with any who would use it to undermine him.

 I don't see him as an actively sexist person. He can also be reasonable and compromise when he is at fault if he isn't drunk. I personally think that he would have given the okay but I'm asking for the fandom's opinion here.

 What do you guys think?

 Edit: Let it be noted that I don't actually think it would work even in a show regardless of wether Rob would allow it or not. The question I am asking is if Robert would allow it.",15,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

.
-
+ He's shocked that Robert died, thinking that there'd be some sort of coup where Ned would save the day... not having Littlefinger betray him and all. (After all, who would trust Littlefinger, with a name like LITTLEFINGER?)

+ He wishes Arya would kill Ceresi and Joffrey with Needle, and I've kinda put it in his head, falsely of course, that she plays a big part in Ned's confession. He probably thinks she'll ride in to save the day, and I almost hate being so cruel.

+ He's glad that cunt Viserys is dead. He never liked him, and he started being a drunken, jealous fool. He's caught onto Dany having the blood of a dragon by the heat and the eggs and all of her statements; he thinks something is up with those eggs, but he's not quite sure. He is in love with her and Drogo's relationship. 

+ He's iffy on Jorah, as we know Jorah has already been highlighted to have been spying, but he finds him to be content in saving her and defending her like there's no tomorrow, so it's a big shrug of the shoulders on that one. I think he'll come to love him in time, like I do.

+ He thinks Theon is horribly underrepresented, and that Robb and Maester Luwin need to be knocked down a peg for constantly reminding Theon of his prisoner ward status as if it is supposed to really make Theon feel like crap.

+ Lysa is loco. He still loves Catelyn, Ned, Arya, and Bran. He's come around to Sansa, seeing that she may be enamored with Joffrey but that she's actually playing his heart and toying with him, and toying everyone at the court.

+ He despises Tyrion, and I am honestly so surprised. I think it's for the same reason he doesn't like Jaime or Ceresi in the arrogance they display - which, Tyrion does boast a lot of confidence in himself in the earlier seasons - he just doesn't like Tyrion's wit or remarks or truly anything about him. I think when it comes to he and Sansa's marriage my friend will slowly turn his favor around.

+ He is in love with Bronn; can sense he'll be an important(er) character. He, although not the staunchest supporter of LGBT that I know of, adores Renly and Loras's relationship. He sees right through Pycelle, likes Varys's immediate admitting of serving the realm. 

+ He doesn't think Ned will die, but something will go wrong with the confession.

+ He loves Tywin. And he thinks Robb's conquest will fail, but to a certain extent where Robb will get Sansa and Arya safe, but die or lose Winterfell or something. Can't exactly remember what he said.

+ Jon is coming to his own. No opinion on Sam, Pyp, Grenn, Alliser, or Commander Mormont, but that'll change I suspect. 
.
-
Loves: Ned, Catelyn, Bran, Arya, Sansa, Robb, Bronn, Tywin (GOD he loves all the Starks. Uh-oh)
Likes: Daenerys, Jorah, Varys, Renly, Loras, Jon, Khal Drogo 
Neutral: Theon
Dislikes: Joffrey, Littlefinger, Pycelle, Lysa
Hates: Ceresi, Jaime, Tyrion

It is a very interesting thing, the fact he hates all three Lannisters. I remember liking Ceresi for a bit, and loving Tyrion, hating Jaime to then love Jaime ever since Season 3. Interesting. Baelor is for tomorrow. I'll make an update for that and then Fire and Blood as well.

He's hooked on the show, like I expected. I remember falling in love by the end of Episode 3 or 4, when Arya gets to start her dancing lesson with Syrio Forel. What do we say to the God of Death? Not today. ",12,22,False,spoiler,,,,,

When I first did the trailer I didn't own the show, so I had to get all of my clips from YouTube. Since I now own the show on Blu-Ray, I thought that I would re-do it with the higher quality sources (Sadly, since Season 7 hasn't released, the Season 7 bits are still from YouTube). I also made some minor adjustments to thinks that I felt didn't flow well the first time around. Anyways, I hope you guys like it! Let me know what you think :D

Could this is GRRM's clever play naming system to hint readers and viewers that Stannis Baratheon is just as metaphorically heartless as the Tin Man is literally? To me, it makes sense, given that he does go on to do some pretty heartless things like killing his brother, committing extramarital sex, killing his daughter, all in the name of power. Of course, in the end, he commits suicide having realized what he's done and still not any closer to winning the game of thrones.",16,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

- they used Greenseers to break the Arm of Dorne in the south, 

- then they tried to break Westeros in half again with the hammer of waters (as they were pushed north I would assume) 

- then they created the White Walkers and a gigantic wall was built in the North. 

Westeros has three wounds on it from this massive war, all by the Children's magic with the assumption that the White Walkers ""got out of control"" and the Children ""joined"" with men to battle them. I think that assumption isn't entirely correct. 

If the COTF were losing and needed man to come to the table they needed a bigger threat. The WW brought man to the table but make no mistake, the COTF never told man they made the White Walkers. Think of that conversation... 

""let's make a deal and I'll help you defeat the threat **I MADE**."" I don't think man would be so happy with the deal if they knew the WW weren't ""the great other"" basically the devil in the north but just more Children magic. 

The ""Great Other"" **served it's purpose** and then the COTF used man to put their monster back in the box. They built the wall and locked away the ""devil""...who was really just a pissed off human cursed by the COTF as we all know now. 

So the COTF get the Gods Eye and humans more or less leave them alone there, very little activity in the Gods Eye...except Howland Reed 

- a descendant of possible interbred humans with COTF

- the guy who caused R+L to meet at the Tourney where the Laughing Knight wore a weirwood shield, 

- was the only other person at the tower of joy where he ""got lucky"" and despite being somewhat of a wimp beat the greatest Knight ever allowing Ned to get to baby Snow

- who has a Greenseer son so could be a greenseer himself (which would explain some of the above) 

- Sent his kids to take Bran to the Three Eyed Raven

8000 years later we find cave paintings of the children being ""friends"" of man, **a great other evil god which we now know is false** and a religion spouting a chosen one worshipping Rhllor, the god of fire who opposes ""the other.""

**If we know they made up the devil how can they not be the ones that made up ""god""?**

The song of ice and fire is the song the children are playing on mankind. Ice vs fire, constant fighting and re-forging since they couldn't beat man. This is why Jon is a fire ""wight"" because it's all the same resurrection magic, they can just do it better than the NK. If they made up the ""great other"" and R'hllor is preaching humans need to fight the ""great other"", they had to have made up R'hllor. Why would a ""god"" preach warnings about a devil that isn't a devil but a magical creation of the children?

The COTF had the Three eyed raven and some children in a weirwood beyond the wall to keep watch on the NK. They constructed a wall and the Nights Watch to hold off the NK. All those things have now failed and hes coming for them however many of them are left which might be very few at this point. 

The NK wants two logical things, revenge (He is a wronged human, turned into a threat by the COTF) and peace (freedom from his curse and death most likely). He knows the COTF are in the Gods Eye and he's heading for them I believe and not Kings Landing, I think after Winterfell falls he will march south and the Gods Eye is right in his path and he will head towards it and Harrenhal instead of Kings Landing. 

The COTF will use man and this prophecy to protect themselves. I think the NK didn't bother with Jon because he sees him as a tool of the children, just as he was. The AA would have been a prophecy created by the children just as the ""great other"" lie to make man fight their battle for them and I think it will happen at Harrenhal which is **where the story started** and also happens to be blasted by dragon fire which could make it treacherous for the NK and his army since it might be dragonglass (I believe that will be the reason why the Harrenhal castle just north of the Gods Eye was blasted by dragons although some maintain dragonglass is volcanic and not made by dragons). I think this castle will be the NKs final battle and he will fall here but when his nature is revealed it won't be so happy an ending as he was just someone wronged looking for revenge and **not** the ""death of all men"". I think ""all men must die"" is a COTF slogan. 

I think we will get answers from Howland Reed at the Gods Eye. I think Howland, who was at the Tower of Joy and has connections with the COTF will fill in most of the blanks. This will all end with the death of magic and ""Wights"" which means when the Wights die, Jon will have to die since the same magic keeps him alive and that is the point of calling him a ""fire wight"" not that the NK can control him but that they are bound by the same ""curse"" and breaking it means they both die now. Jon may be intended to be AA but I think he will end the song of ice and fire instead, possibly destroying the source of the children's magic. 

Popular consensus would be the COTF are out but I think for the NK to have any real meaning they would need to re-enter for the finale. I also think Howland Reed would have been omitted if he weren't going to play a part as well just as other characters have been.

I personally think they will if they both survive. Assuming Daenerys will become pregnant, I can't see a reason why they wouldn't. Yes, they are related biologically, but they don't see themselves as relatives psychologically. 

I think that once Jon and Dany find out the truth about Jon, there will be some tension and they will distance themselves from each other, but once the pregnancy bomb is dropped, they will come back together because of both love and duty. I don't think Jon's parentage will just magically eliminate all of the feelings that they have for each other, and I couldn't see Jon just abandoning his child for a fairly petty reason. One of Jon's worst fears is fathering a bastard, so I could easily see him going back to Daenerys when she becomes pregnant. 

Lastly, I think a marriage alliance would work well politically as well. Assuming Cersei is defeated, their marriage would unite the north and south. Politically speaking, there would be nobody better to marry to Daenerys than Jon and vice versa. Them being in love would just be an added benefit to their relationship. 

I just think that with an obvious pregnancy incoming, it would be hard to sell Jon and Dany not being together in the end if they both survive. That's obviously a big IF, but Im personally of the opinion that the core ""good"" characters will make it through to the end, with them being: Tyrion, Jon, Bran, Daenerys, Sansa, and Arya. Saying that characters have to die in order to make an ending bittersweet is just flat out wrong. If you take the context of GRRM's ""bittersweet"" quote, he uses LOTR as an example. Not really many of the main characters died in that story. I just think that characters like Jon, Tyrion, and Daenerys are meant to make it to the end and be a part of the rebuilding of the ""new world"".

might actually be about Cersei and another man.

Tyrions story sounds more like a riddle than an actual personal anecdote. And whenever stories like this come up in the show, I personally take note of them because they seem really important. 

Ive taken his story and removed the names. Heres what it looks like now:

&gt; I was sixteen. My brother and I were riding when we heard a scream. She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels. My brother scared away the men easily enough while I wrapped her in my cloak. She was too scared to send off on her own, so while my brother hunted down the rapers, I took her to the nearest inn and fed her. She was a wheelwright's orphan, and she was hungry. Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine. Impossible as it seems, there was a time when I was unaccustomed to wine. I forgot how frail I was around girls. I was always waiting for them to laugh at me, or look away embarrassed, or ask me about my tall handsome brother. I forgot about everything but her, and somehow I found myself in her bed... Didn't last long: I didn't know what the hell I was doing. But she was good to me. She kissed me afterwards, and sang me a song, and by morning I was deep enough in love to ask for her hand. A few lies, a few gold coins, and one drunken septon, and there you have it: man and wife. A fortnight anyway, until the septon sobered up and told my father... First he had my brother tell me the truth: the girl was a whore, you see. My brother had arranged the whole thing: the road, the rapers, all of it. He thought it was time I had a woman. After my brother confessed, my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards. He paid her well, a silver for each of them. How many whores command that kind of price? He brought me into the barracks and made me watch. By the end, she had so much silver, that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling onto the floor. 

Intuition led me to believe this could be about Cersei. Her importance in the overall story, her resentment toward Tywin, Tywin's need for control in Cersei's romantic life, her confusing attitudes about sex, her sensitivity when it comes to the subject of rape, her moments of real vulnerability that suggest she does (or did) have a heart, all those jokes about Cersei being a whore

As far as the identity of the guy goes, when I removed the names from Tyrions story, it sounds a lot like something that could have happened between Robert and Stannis. Think about it; Robert being the handsome, strong older brother, Stannis the quiet, more polite one who lives in his shadow. Chasing off those guys would have been a very Robert thing to do. And Stannis has this extremely rigid attitude about prostitution and sexuality in general; a childhood trauma like this could totally explain that sort of mindset in later years. Plus, Stannis was known for being super uncomfortable around women all the time.

This could also partly explain why Tywin was weird about Stannis. By all counts, Stannis was the sort of guy that Tywin would respect. But he refused to acknowledge that Stannis had a solid claim to the throne. Maybe he was afraid of what he would do in retaliation? 

Full disclosure: Ive theorized about a relationship between Stannis and Cersei before, so I couldve just been looking to confirm my own expectations here. ",20,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Two episodes previous to this, ""The Bear and the Maiden Fair"" features the final scene of Jaime going back to Harrenhall to rescue Brieane and finds her in the pit with a bear. I'm wondering if this is a foreshadow of perhaps Breianne being wounded and in battle against a Mormont, possibly Jorah of course, and Jaime saves her. I understand this is a far stretch seeing as Breanne is far better than Jaime now due to his hand, and obviously Dany and Aegon(Jon) are now lovers and he has sworn fealty, meaning Breanne probably won't fight Jorah due to his service to Dany. 

However, I came across a endgame idea for GOT as a whole and it went into detail on how Jon was the PTWP as I think we can all agree he is, and then went on to go into how he kills Dany to create lightbringer and defeat the WW. This would provide a probable cause for Breanne and Jorah to be fighting if Jon betrays Dany. 

Tell me your thoughts, and maybe comment any S8 foreshadowing you think we've seen in the making.",12,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Next month I will be competing in a Game Of Thrones themed model United Nations. For those who are unaware, model United Nations is where you play the role of a delegate assigned to you and do your best to advance your delegates position whilst following what your delegate would actually do. For example if I was assigned the role of president trump in a model United Nations I wouldn't support things such as abortion due to that being his position. 
This model United Nations is set in Westeros and begins ""immediately after the death of Ned Stark, political unrest erupts into the civil war known as the War of the Five Kings. During this time, several regions of Westeros also want sovereignty. Adding to the instability, groups of uncivilized humans said to be wild, violent and uncontrollable, known as Wildlings, are among those who seek passage into Westeros. They currently reside north of The Wall, which is a 700 foot high and 300 mile long wall built by Westeros at its Northern border. It is protected by soldiers known as the Nights Watch, who work to keep these Wildings out of Westeros and maintain peace at The Wall. Another concern currently facing the people of Westeros is that a long and harsh winter is approaching. In the Game of Thrones universe, seasons last several years. As such, a prolonged winter requires adequate preparation of food and resources in order to ensure survival. The long summer has ended, and autumn is fleeting away faster than anticipated. Winter is coming."" It is my task along with the other committee members to try and find solutions for: The War of the Five Kings, Risk of Fragmentation of Westerns, and the White Walkers. 
I was assigned the character of Jon Snow and was given this description of him: ""The illegitimate son of Ned Stark, Jon is considered a member of both the Nights Watch and House Stark. He is extremely loyal to his family and his House, and is interested in supporting Robb in any way he can. Contrary to the show, in this committee Jon can remain a member of the Nights Watch and also leave The Wall to pursue other goals should he choose to do so. While Jon does not own many resources himself, he has working relations with certain Wilding chiefs. Jon also has a direwolf named Ghost who protects him at all costs.

In preparation for this model United Nations I'd like to create a rough plan of action to advance my position as much as possible. Currently I'm mulling over the idea of potentially leaving the night's watch to join my brother Robb in his action against the throne, or sticking with the night's watch and potentially assassinating the Lord Commander to take his position or if not wait for his death while making friends with other Lords. 

What are everyones thoughts?

He has been dealt a shit hand, but still comes out on top as one of the most skilled and dangerous men in Westeros.

He defends those that cannot defend themselves. Some examples of this being: he saved Loras from being killed by The Mountain, he saved Sansa from being raped (and most likely killed) by the men in Kings Landing, and I know for a fact that Arya wouldnt have made it through her travels if it werent for The Hound.

Which brings me to my favorite part of the entire show, Arya and The Hound. He protects her (keep in mind, he had no reason to do so), despite the fact that she continuously threatens to kill him (and attempts it). The entire reason that he fought Brienne of Tarth, and almost died doing so, was to protect Arya. They develop, what I consider to be, the best relationship in the show. It was as if he became a father figure to her.

He is such a badass fighter. I personally have a hard time watching fight scenes, but when The Hound is involved, I cant keep my eyes off of the screen. I think everyone can agree that the chicken scene is by far one of the best in the show. Not only is it one of the most memorable, but it also provides a hint of comic relief. In a show as serious as Game of Thrones, its a pleasant thing to see.

I could go on and on about all of the things that make The Hound the best character, but his fearlessness, his honesty, and his hidden heart of gold prove it for me.

It really was Stannis all along. 

I think he was supposed to die in order to fulfill his destiny. On various occasions, Melisandre tells Stannis that her magic requires sacrifice, or a kings blood. At first it seemed like she was saying he had to sacrifice relatives (like Gendry or even Shireen), but maybe she was really saying he had to sacrifice himself.

&gt; Melisandre: I have seen the path to victory in the flames. But first you must give yourself to the Lord of Light. 

&gt; Stannis: Ive said the words, damn you. I burnt the idols. 

&gt; Melisandre: You must give *all* of yourself.

Self-sacrifice is the ultimate act of duty. Stannis talks about Melisandres prophecy as if he doesnt want to be king at all, but has a moral obligation to do so, even at great personal cost. 

&gt; I never asked for this, no more than I asked to be king. We do not choose our destinies, but we must do our duty, no? Great or small, we must do our duty. -- Stannis

In fact, his final words were, Go on, do your duty.

So heres my theory: **I think The Prince That Was Promised and The Night King are the same person. And that person is Stannis Baratheon, the One True King of Westeros.** 

Part of the prophecy about The Prince That Was Promised is that hed be born again amidst salt and smoke. Not born  born *again*. 

The first time we saw The Night King (not in a vision) was at Hardhome. Right around the time of Stannis death. We literally watched as he raised his arms and a bunch of people came back to life while fires burned in the background (smoke) and the survivors took to the sea (salt).

Years and years of exposition on Stannis and casual statements that theyll bend the knee or [hell] destroy them. Davos warnings that Stannis doesnt just talk about paying people back, he actually does it. Davos increasing desperation as Stannis runs out of time. Melisandres dread at the prospect of Stannis failure.  

It makes a whole lot of sense that whoever is capable of saving the realm would also be capable of destroying it. And nobody had better reason to raise an army of the dead than Stannis, the rightful king whose claim was forgotten.

&gt; This war has just begun. It will last for years. Thousands will die at your command.  You will betray the man serving you. You will betray your family. You will betray everything you once held dear. And it will all be worth it. Because you are the Son of Fire, you are the Warrior of Light. You will sweep aside this pretender and that one. You will be king. -- Melisandre to Stannis

Brilliantly acted by Mark Addy, every word that comes out of his mouth is meme gold. Also, just as a character, Robert is a pretty interesting guy. That being said, hes easily the most underrated antagonist in the show...

- Possibly starts the rebellion by spreading the rumor that Rhaegar kidnapped Lyanna. We dont actually know who first told this lie, so well give him the benefit of the doubt on this one.
- Starts off his reign by allowing injustice to go unanswered; he didnt punish anyone for the numerous war crimes that were committed during the sack of kings landing. We kind of shrug this off some as an audience, but right off the back, this is a guy who essentially condones rape...
- Gives no thought to the importance of his marriage, and instead of trying to use his marriage to Cersei to help unite the kingdoms further, he dishonors her on their wedding night and many nights after
-makes Jon Arryn his hand, but doesnt listen to any of his good advice. An equivalent situation would be if a friend asked you for help doing something, showed no interest in contributing, and then when you tried to do it yourself, they came in and screwed everything up.
-put the crown in debt. If you borrow from the iron bank w/o a plan to pay it back, youre basically guaranteeing a war in the future. Also, by borrowing from Tywin, he allowed an already powerful House to gain too much leverage over him
-had literally no interest in ruling or in the greater good, but voluntarily took the throne anyway
-split up his house into 3 parts, which weakened the realm and exacerbated the power vacuum that followed his death
-gave 0 effort into raising his son to be a good king. Absolutely unacceptable, seeing as how he knows firsthand that Jon Arryn makes a great father figure. All Robert had to do was to put Jon in charge of raising Joffrey, but alas... 

Ok now we get to when the show starts:
-makes his best friend Ned take a job that he knows hes going to hate. Justifies it by saying that he needs Ned to rule for him, but then when Ned accepts, Robert undermines him at every turn
-kills Sansas dire wolf because to not do so would be mildly annoying to him
-continues to spend money that he doesnt have on extravagances like the Hands Tourney
-lets the Lannisters, specifically Jamie Lannister, do whatever the fuck they want
-leaves his kingdom in the middle of an impending war in order to go hunting
-gets killed by a pig /s

The thing about all these actions is that we know that Robert does know right from wrong, he often just cant be bothered to do the right thing. Being a bad king doesnt necessarily make you a bad guy, but when you have all the necessary knowledge and resources to be a good king but you arent because you cant be bothered, youre kind of a villain. I guess my point is that while Robert is seen as a funny but negligent king, hes really just straight up a bad guy. Agree/disagree?",46,21,False,spoiler,,,,,

All the named Dothraki are dead. None of those remaining have any real dialog, unless you want to count insulting the Lannisters' fighting ability. 

But here's the real puzzle: this is a culture built upon raising and riding horses across wide open spaces. Not only couldn't they give a fuck about castles, the whole idea of living behind walls and not under the stars is an anathema to them. Is Dany going to give them castles and titles? I don't think so. They aren't going to farm, it's against their beliefs to till the land which is like cutting the flesh of Mother Earth. 

And what of their favorite things? Fighting... they can do that for a time but fighting to subjugate, loot, rape, and enslave? Well that's not going to fly under Dany. As soon as she comes to power she's not going to want any fighting for the sake of fighting. 

It doesn't seem like Westeros will welcome a wandering hoard. So do the Dothraki slink home after the war, far fewer in number, leaderless, with great portions of their culture verboten but no new culture to replace it, and only material rewords which can be carried back? At least they could return to riding the plains but this seems like a shit deal overall.

One of the maesters says something along the lines of and the drowned god was supposed to rise again and destroy aegon the conqueror 

I just found it interesting that of all the myths and legends that they decided to write this one in. I thought it could potentially be some foreshadowing. Originally I thought it could foreshadow euron possibly killing dany. Since then however, knowing Jons name is actually aegon, I wonder if it could some how foreshadow his death. Im also more on board with Theon being the drowned god as opposed to euron now too.

For me? It would definitely have to be the weird switch-ups that the show did from the Novels. I'm speaking mostly for the whole Loras Tyrell, Stannis/Shireen Baratheon, and Barristan Selmy ordeal. I fully believed these characters should have just stuck to the routes they took in the books rather than what the show had given them to deal with.

For this specific case, I'm more wishing they gave Loras something more than **just being gay.** I'm perfectly fine with him being gay, because I am as well, but with his homosexuality being used as a plot device.. I really, and I mean *really* didn't agree with the actions D&amp;D took with his character. In comparison to his novel's counterpart, show!Loras is but a shadow of what he could have been.

book!Loras is a knight, a tourny frequenter (and winner, mind you), and first and foremost: Tyrell's prized fighter. While in the books he's used as cannon fodder for a Cersei vs. Margaery plotline, in the novels he's not even *involved* with the Faith Militia arc and instead storms Dragonstone and conquers it whilst sustaining severe injuries. I'd much rather him die as a knight who conquered Dragonstone than some silly device used in a storyline that was easily done without his presence in the novels.

What about you guys? Don't be afraid if this gets downvoted, I know how people can be with criticisms, but I'd really like to discuss this with you lot!",26,12,False,spoiler,,,,,

I believe that Dany will die before the end of the series.

My basis for this is largely rooted in the ""prophecy"" Dany sees in the house of the undying. kings landing is in ruin and covered in snow, she reaches out to the throne but turns away before she gets to it and then goes beyond the wall to the ten wth Drogo and her son.

Besides the obvious that its showing kings landing will be overcome by the wights and destroyed and that Dany will get close to the throne and be beckoned away at the last moment heres what i think of it.. when she goes through the door in the throne room she is north of the wall (the land of the DEAD. not the side of the living as Jon puts it). Dany is then reunited with Drogo and her stillborn son, which Mirri Maz said would only happen when ""When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves. When your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child. Then he will return, and not before."" i believe this is a metaphor for when she is dead. all of those things cannot happen in the real world and are in fact the opposite of what occurs naturally. i think that like her being north of the wall being the opposite of her being alive and symbolizing her death, mirri maz's prophecy is a metaphor meaning ""listen bitch you'll never see them again until everything is backwards and you're dead'.

on top of all of that the new development that Kit Harington shed a tear after reading the end of the series script. maybe she does something selfless and sacrifices herself for the rest of the world. Maybe she becomes the Night Queen?!?!?!?!?

anyway this has probably come up before and i apologize. the ideas came into my head while re watching GOT and simultaneously rewatching Stranger Things...... Upside down, dead alive.... you get it.

I'm currently doing a season 7 rewatch as it's airing on free to air tv in New Zealand now. And last night I saw a moment that I believe is a hint, or foreshadowing if you want to call it that, to a theory I have been thinking a while. 
[Here's the image]
(https://i0.wp.com/longnightiscoming.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Fire-and-Ice-Jon-and-Dany-walking-out-of-Dragonstone.gif?zoom=2&amp;resize=324%2C178)

So I believe that the song of ice and fire is not as obvious as we may think. This theory first came about for me as I read George referring to Jon as a fire Wight. 
Basically I believe that Jon is Ice turned fire and Dany will become fire turned ice. 

We have specifically been shown how the night king was made, and I don't think it's a coincidence it's a similar fashion to how Azor had to sacrifice his wife Nissa Nissa.
I believe Dany will offer herself to become night queen, to not only regain control of Viserion, but to free the biggest slave army. The army of the dead. And of course Jon will be the one to turn her as a nod to him being Azor reborn.

Sorry if this has already been talked about but I tried to find similar theories on here but came up with nothing. 
Love to hear any thoughts on this theory!

Jon's(/House Stark's) is melancholy, sorrowful, and at times feels as if he/House Stark has been defeated

Up until now, I always thought that the music resembled what is happening on the show (which is true) and what is to come. Dany, the conquering hero, the savior of Westeros, the triumphant, etc... And this would indicate that she will be the victor in the final conflict.... whereas Jon's music sets him up to be the martyr, the hero who loses everything, and will eventually die....


BUT


I realized this morning that the books are written in point-of-view style... what if the musical score is written the same way:  it does not reflect (nor predict) what is ACTUALLY happening, but what the character BELIEVES is happening/thinks will happen?


Dany believes she is the conquering hero, the rightful queen, etc... she sees herself as a great savior, etc... hence her music reflects that.
Jon believed he never had a place in the world, he despairs for Westeros, sees tragedy for him and his family, does not view himself as a champion (like Dany views herself) but as someone thrust into this conflict against his will..... and hence his music reflects that.



So then, if this is true, perhaps the music indicates what the characters want, rather than what they will get, and Dany will lose the throne, and Jon will be victorious and gain peace/happiness?",22,100,False,spoiler,,,,,

So a bit of explanation as to why I think this, it's quite plausible that Ser Onion was the one to have had the power and faith needed to bring Jon back to life. I believe this is the case as Ser Davos, multiple times is stated as not being a man of faith, not believing in Gods, and therefore that's where I draw the parallel between him and another Red Priest, Thoros.





Thoros, like Davos was a man without faith and went about his day pretending to believe, however at a time of desperation and need, he called to R'hllor and he answered, bringing Beric back to life. So this is where I think Davos did the whole resurrection, the moment everyone else goes out and Davos looks distraught, touching Jon, is when I think R'hllor answered, as the only thing Davos had left is to believe in something he already isn't sure about, he saw the power of The Lord of Light through Mellisandre and therefore consequently may have gotten the ability of resurrection becasue he had nothing else left and Jon ""was his friend""





SO.... This is where I think Davos will end up by the end, as a Red Priest. In a way it's poetic irony, Davos who never believed in the Lord's intervention and thought Mellisandre was talking rubbish to Stannis, he never believed in gods and therefore it's a complete turn to his character, a man who had no faith to becoming something as he once resented, a red priest because he got to witness the Lord's power.





This also brings me onto saying I think Jon will die again, not a ceremoniously as before, but a death that will force Davos to be desperate, with Mellisandre not there, and Thoros dead I think it will therefore be Davos who will find it within himself to resurrect Jon and become a catalyst of him becoming a Red Priest after the war for the dawn.





TL;DR: I think Davos will become a Red priest by the end of the story, serving as poetic irony to his character and resurrecting Jon to catlyse his transition to Priest.",21,25,False,spoiler,,,,,

S6E10 up next...,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/78xung/main_spoilers_rewatching_with_my_girlfriend_her/,jgs2,1509045281,"My GF is watching the series for the first time. I am watching with her, my second run through. We just watched S6E9 and the finale is up next. I've hyped up this episode because it's my favorite. I'd been following rumors, podcasting, (reading reddit threads...) etc. during the latter seasons and was swept up in the Jon's parentage mystery. So, I was very well ""primed"" for this reveal (though not spoiled), and it blew me away (as it did many of you).

My girlfriend, however - while a close watcher - likes to completely avoid all commentary, media, etc. To each his/her own, sure. But I'm afraid the significance of the Jon's parentage reveal, which constituted the peak of the series to date for me, may be lost on her. I've tried to very subtly drop hints at various points emphasizing who Rhaegar was, making sure she caught the passing mentions here and there, etc. But I'm just not sure she will grasp the full meaning of the reveal. I don't even think she has ever given any thought to who Jon's parents are (other than knowing he's ""Ned Stark's bahstuhd""). Maybe that's a good thing.

So, fellow redditors, I ask:

1. Did any of you experience the Jon's parentage reveal ""cold,"" without being ""primed"" for it at all? If so, how did it work for you?

2. If it wasn't you personally, did anyone close to you have that experience? If so, what did they think?

3. What subtle hints, if any, can I extremely casually drop before we watch this ep to get her primed for the reveal, but without giving anything away? References to Rhaegar are out the window, because it's been so long since we've had a reference to him that it would raise her suspicions.

I just want her to enjoy the experience as much as I did. ",13,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

It's powerful, emotional, blends perfectly with an enhances the scenes it plays against on screen, etc...........

&amp;nbsp;

but then the last 2 minutes of S7E7, The Dragon and the Wolf, where Jaime's riding north and the world is darker, and snow falls, and ""Winter is Here"" plays....  that piece, while nowhere near as entertaining to listen to as LotS, was, for me, so much more heart-wrenchingly powerful....  and tbh, depressing.

&amp;nbsp;

Watching that scene I felt, even though Jaime's epiphany, and his departure for (presumably) Winterfell should be uplifting, that the music robbed me of any hope for Jon and Dany to defeat the NK....  it felt like the journey was over or that it was filled not with hope anymore, but despair..... Damn you, Djawadi for being so good........

In the beginning of the show he was basically Ned Stark lite, but kind of a child so impulsive and a bit naive(maybe impulsivity has to do with Targaryen blood?). Since then the character has gone through so much... Joining the nights watch,becoming lord commander, then dying, only to be brought back to become king in the north and lead the fight against the white walkers... But how has he grown or developed? 

Sansa,Arya,Jaime,Tyrion,Cersei and even Daenarys have grown through their journey. But Jon is still impulsive ned stark lite... In the Battle of the Bastard's, Ramsay plays Jon with the whole rickon thing, and Jon being an impulsive idiot falls for it, and puts the whole army at risk despite Sansa's warning. Also the whole actually I swore fealty to denarys already... He continues to show his stupidity.
And the thing is all the other characters who have had an honorable shtick and especially those that were also impulsive ie; Robb, all ended up dead permanently, yet somehow Jon snow is still here not really paying for his mistakes.

I would love to have my mind changed.

I get what they say. They say she is a pathetic little girl and does not do much. 
But in all fairness what are they expecting her to do? What does she have? 
Yes if you compare her yo Dany, Cersei, Catelyn, Brienne, Arya, Olenna, and Sand Snakes she seems like just a hopeless girl.
But first of all hopeless girls do exist and are much more than warrior princesses, second anyone in her position won't do much. 

Let's just look at Dany, sure she was ""Sold"" to Drogo, but boom a big FIRE and then she has three dragons, and even had a little band of warriors, Dothraki and Jorah, and some money I suppose, she also had her freedom.
Cersei had her brother a kingsguard, her house the real power, and even then she failed in a thing or two. 
Catelyn had the support of House Tully, Stark, and even Arryn in sense. 
Brienne and Arya again have their freedom, were trained from a young age to kill, and then Brienne is given a Valyrian steel sword
Arya trained to be a faceless man. 
And so on with others. A combination of both luck, or fortunes, and their ability is what got them what they have, like Machiavelli says.

But what does Sansa have or can do? 
Even if she had the abilities of Arthur Dayne could she just kill them all? 
Even if she is Olenna or Baelish could she have manipulated the entire court and freed herself?
What would you or I do in her situation? 
Why do we want her to be a warrior/queen/politician/manipulator/all around jack of all trades? 

Just remember that she is a hostage and has no family, yes in the show it's a bit different but still, and has no gold, no friends, no allies, no men sworn to her service, no spies, no power what so ever. 
So Why do we want her to kill the kingsguard and everyone in the redkeep, hit the road to the Twins killing house Frey then go to the North and take it without breaking a sweat. 

The closest to her story is that she is like Baelish or Varys but with a powerful name.
Sure it looks like she is a stupid week female characters, but in all fairness that is the most realistic and it's because GRRM ruined us with great strong female characters but the books/show are not about what we want or like or about a statement, to a degree I suppose, or just making sure all women are strong and powerful and men evil or the other way around. 
Just look at how much suffering people, men and women, get in the story and you might just start to feel sorry for Sansa and what she goes through and understand that she was put into a difficult situation which she cannot control. 
Lastly I think she would grow and take more control of her life. But she is still young and needs to to learn so much.

For a long time I thought the North was based on Scotland, but on a repeat viewing, it reminds me a lot more of Russia.

* The North is the largest of the Seven Kingdoms, and is often cited as being almost impossible to conquer.  This is also true of Russia; Napoleon and Hitler have tried to invade Russia, only to catastrophically fail.  Only the Mongols have successfully conquered Russia, much like the Targaryens conquering the North.

* The North, despite being the largest, is also the poorest of the Seven Kingdoms.  Its economy depends on timber and livestock.  Historically, Russia also had a reputation of being a very large but poor country.

* To gain access to the North, you must cross the Riverlands.   Ukraine and Poland have a large series of rivers to cross before entering Russia.  (Yes, I know the Riverlands are based off the Netherlands)

* The Norths climate.  The North has a reputation for being cold and harsh.  Russia has a similar reputation.

* Northern culture is very stoic and takes immense pride for living under arduous conditions.  Having known many Russians, Ive seen a similar attitude.

* Whoever passes the sentence, swings the sword.  Russians profoundly consider execution a matter of honor.  Military executions in Russia during World War 2 were carried out by officers.

* The large skins that Northerners wear seems much more of a Russian thing.

* The North is a holdout to the Faith of the Seven.  Russia was one of the last countries in Europe to convert to Christianity.

Secondly my English isn't that good so please forgive that :D

-------------------------------------------------------

You know probably all the requirements to be Azor Ahai/the prince who was promised:

1.  Someone from the line of Aerys and Rhealla Tagaryen
2. Someone how's born beneath a bleeding star, amidst salt and smoke.
3. They should have a burning sword 
4. Has something to do with dragon's 
5. ""The dragon must have three heads"" and ""the song of ice and fire"" may be involved somehow
6. Sacrifice must be involved with the sword somehow 

So, we all know that it gives theories about the three dragon heads are three persons they should be Azor Ahai. This theory is about that. 

I don't think that Tyrion is one of the persons, because he isn't a Tagaryen. 
I know it gives circumstantials for that, but I don't think that it will another revealing like with Jon Snow. 

Jon Snow/Aegon Tagaryen is one of the persons. 
He is in the line of Aerys and Rhealla Tagaryen. He was born beneath a bleeding star ( the sword of Ser Arthur Dayne),
he is the song of ice and fire probably, has something do to with dragons.

Daenerys Tagaryen is also one of this persons. She is also in the line, she was born  admits salt ( the water around Dragonstone) and smoke ( the storm in the night of her birth). Also beneath a bleeding star, has something to do with dragon's.

So everybody is saying that the third person is Tyrion, Jaimie, Bran or Hodor(lol).

But who could be in the line of Aerys and Rhealla Tagaryen without a version or something like this?

I think that Daenerys can born another child, and that child will be the third person. Don't think that I believe that it will give a time jump! Why would the directors come across with the story that Daenerys can't become children's? Because she can!

I believe that Daenerys will be pregnant, the child will be in the line of Aerys and Rhealla Tagaryen and Jon must kill the baby and Daenerys to get Lightbringer, he must bring a sacrifice.

# I. Means, motive, opportunity

## A. Means: blood magic.

**Stannis was known for his use of blood magic in his pursuit for the throne.** 


He did this through his relationship with the red priestess Melisandre, who believed Stannis to be the prophesied Prince That Was Promised that would lead the realm against a coming darkness. As we learned from Daenerys in season 1, however, the use of blood magic comes at a price. More on this later.

## B.  Motive: his claim was forgotten. 

**Nobody had better reason to raise the Army of the Dead than Stannis, the rightful king whose claim was forgotten.** 

Think about it: why did the White Walkers return when they did, after thousands of years? It makes sense that they were brought back because someone desperately needed an army. Stannis tried everything to get an army, but to no avail. He didnt have the crown, the gold, or the favor of the people. Thats why he resorted to blood magic in the first place. 

## C. Opportunity: execution by Valyrian steel.

Heres where the price of using blood magic comes in. Melisandre told Stannis that her magic requires a kings blood, and that certain sacrifices had to be made before Stannis could get what he wants. Neither of them seem to understand what this means until its too late: **Stannis had to sacrifice himself in order to fulfill his destiny.** 

Remember what Mirri said to Daenerys about blood magic?

*""Only death can pay for life.""*

Stannis left for the North when Melisandre informed him that death marches on the Wall. It was practically a suicide mission that ended when Brienne executed him  using Valyrian steel. In Brans vision, the Children of the Forest created the White Walkers by stabbing a man with dragonglass, which is also known to kill White Walkers. So is Valyrian steel. If dragonglass could create a White Walker, its possible that Valyrian steel could too.

&amp;nbsp;

# II. Clues

## A. Symbols from Dragonstone

**The symbols that are associated with the return of the White Walkers were also found in the cave in Dragonstone, where Stannis lived for almost twenty years.** 

During his conversation with Sam at Castle Black, Stannis reveals not only that he knew about that cave, but also that he believes in the Army of the Dead. Stannis himself said that he wasnt the type to believe in something unless hed seen it for himself. He was one of the only people in the realm who took the White Walkers seriously; this is a strong sign that he may have had something to do with it.

## B. Music

**When we see the Night King at Hardhome, a variation of Stannis theme music plays.** 


That scene is the first time we see the Night King in the flesh? We see visions of him before then, but its important to note that visions can be from anytime in the past, present, or future. Outside those visions, we never see the Night King with the White Walkers until the end of season 5  right around the time of Stannis death. As Jon and the survivors take to the sea, a lone cello plays a variation of the notes from Stannis theme. Then, the Night King steps out onto the dock, that theme continues to play but transitions from that warm cello sound to an icy percussive effect, and Stannis theme fades away. 

Stannis theme: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3cDLnkYs30

Hardhome: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozkHwFG91AI

&amp;nbsp;

# III. Warnings

## A. Theyll bend the knee or Ill destroy them.

Stannis tried to take the throne using traditional means and by following the law, but the odds werent in his favor. He was denied everywhere he went, from the Iron Bank to the King Beyond the Wall to his own brother. 

**From the very start, he warned his enemies that if they didnt bend the knee, he would destroy them.**

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; ""Ill have thousands of your men in chains by nightfall with nowhere to put them and nothing to feed them. Were not here to slaughter beat dogs. Their fate depends on their king.""

&gt; ""All the same, we do not kneel."" 

&amp;nbsp;

## B. He doesnt just talk about paying people back, he actually does it.

Stannis Baratheon may not have been the most likeable man in Westeros, but he was the real deal. **When he made a promiseor a threathe followed through.** 

He did his duty when Robert told him to hold Storms End. He gave it up when Robert told him he was giving it to Renly. But when the time came for him to claim what he earned, everyone turned against him. He tried the high road at first, and they still didnt listen. He warned them that the darkness would devour them all if he didnt triumph. He warned them that hed have their men in chains by nightfall (the Walkers were literally in chains by season 7). He warned them that he would destroy them. And they didnt kneel. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; This war has just begun. It will last for years. Thousands will die at your command. You will betray the man serving you, you will betray your family, you will betray everything you once held dear. And it will all be worth it, because you are the Son of Fire, you are the Warrior of Light. You will sweep aside this pretender and that one. You will be king.

I couldn't find a similar theory anywhere, so hopefully it's a new perspective, and would definitely be amazing to happen!

So, at the moment the Night King looks pretty unbeatable. I thought back to the early parts of the story in the books and show because they often like to leave something open-ended, then come back to it to solve a later problem. One of the things that was never expanded upon was the apparent mysticism surrounding the Crypt of Winterfell. There are stories about the statues and iron swords being there to keep the spirits confined. At the point where it is mentioned, it's a lot easier to dismiss it as an old wives tale (or old nan's tale, if you will). With everything that has happened since, it doesn't seem such a stretch to see a possible element of truth in it. 

Brandon the Builder and the Children built the wall and put the spells in place to keep the white walkers on the other side. What if Winterfell was a backup for the eventuality that *Winter* came and the wall *fell*? The crypts could have been woven with the same kind of magic in the wall, to keep the spirits of the kings of the north and lords of Winterfell within. Each tomb has a statue of the occupant with a direwolf at their feet. Perhaps if the Night King approaches (or takes) Winterfell he will awaken the vengeful spirits of every Stark since Brandon himself, each controlling/riding a fully grown Direwolf and they will do enough damage to leave the way clear for Jon to finally face off against the Night King.

Is the first one the full season 7 and bonus material?

First says ""Game of Thrones: S7 (Conquest&amp;Rebellion + Blu-Ray)"" for $39.96.

Editorial review:  
&gt; Includes 45-min. never-before-seen animated history Conquest &amp; Rebellion, which tells the rich backstory to the Game of Thrones 

Second says ""Game of Thrones: S7 [Blu-ray]"" for $57.19.

Editorial review:  
&gt; Game of Thrones: The Complete Seventh Season (BD+DC)  

[According to this article](https://hd-report.com/2017/10/11/new-game-of-thrones-season-7-bundle-includes-conquest-rebellion-bonus-disc/), the first one is a pre order bonus set that includes both the complete season 7 and the history (Conquest&amp;Rebellion)

&gt; This edition of Game of Thrones: Season 7 with Conquest &amp; Rebellion has a list price of $57.99 but is available to pre-order for just $39.96 (see Amazon pricing below). Thats a huge disparity between the Game of Thrones: Season 7 Blu-ray Disc that has been available to pre-order for $62.00 (List: $74.99).

It's confusing the first one is so much cheaper...

I could see something like that working. 

But then you get the theories like Jaqen H'Ghar being Syrio, or Syrio being part of the Faceless Men and that he was trying to recruit Arya from the very beginning, which I just can't believe would gain any sort of credence at all. The only thing that would have probed interest in Arya would have been that she was a Stark - she was a 10 (either 11 or 9 years old, depending on if you're going with the show or the books, so we'll just settle on 10) year old troublemaker with no noticeable skills or talents that would lead anyone to believe that she could actually train and be destined to be part of one of the most prestigious Assassin's Guilds within this universe. 

I've also seen a few people talking about Tyrion actually being a Targaryen, which I also think is ludicrous. Him not being a Lannister is something that I could actually be okay with (For those that aren't familiar, the theory is that Joanna was actually knocked up by someone else, and that's why Tywin hates him so much. Not only is he a dwarf that caused Joanna's death, but that he's a bastard from another man), but I've seen people wanting him to be a Targaryen which I think is just silly. This theory would have been more believable if Jon hadn't turned out to be a Targaryen, but having Tyrion _also_ be a Targaryen would just seem unrealistic.

What about you guys? Let me clarify, this isn't just wacky fan theories that people make up. I'm talking about fan theories that are very unbelievable, but seem to have gained a lot of attention/support.",44,22,False,spoiler,,,,,

But the question is how are all his pies never burnt. The answer is clear he is a targaryen. We all know targaryens can't be burn so it only makes sense. So since we now know he is a targaryen  what does that mean for the series as a whole. I think hot pie is the rightful heir to the iron throne. He will kill Dany and her dragons with poisoned pies and will take the iron thrones for himself. This would be the perfect ending for  the series ASOIAF and for hot pies character arc as this is the direction we all think it's going.

This story takes place during the filming of the first episode of GOT in Winterfell (Belfast, Ireland). While touring the set I asked the archery coach, who taught Bran (Isaac hempstead wright) in the first episode how and where to fire his arrows, if there were any interesting stories that occurred whilst filming. It so happened there was one.

During the scene in which Bran was firing arrows at the targets, he (the archery coach) was watching on to observe whether what Bran was doing was abreast with what the directors and choreographers wanted. All was going as planned and several takes of Bran firing the arrows were taken. Although some had to be reshot because of Alfie Allen (Theon Greyjoy) was missing a stage direction or line during the scene. According to the archery coach, he was just being a dick and was making it hard for the others to play their part in the scene. Sean Bean (Ned Stark) was becoming agitated at his behavior and so was Charles Dance (Tywin Lannister), who happened to be looking on whilst they were filming.

The Directors, also frustrated with his attitude called for a break in filming in order for those acting in the scene to relax and try to forget that Aflie was acting like a dick. This is where it gets interesting. As the cast members began to walk away from the scene and have a break the archery coach walked up to the target and began to pick out the arrows so they could be used later. As he was about to clasp the arrow and pick it from the target Alfie fired one that nearly hit the archery coach's hand. Everyone was visibly shocked by what Alfie had done. Alfie began to laugh. Sean Bean was still on set and was outraged by what he'd done and wanted to have words with him. As he approached Alfie, Dance put a hand on his chest and looked him in dead in the eyes and in a very Tywin Lannister way said ""No, I'll deal with him."" Sean saw that Dance meant business and took a step back. Dance marched over to Alfie who was still giggling like a school girl and said, in a stern and direct manner ""Walk with me, now!"" Alfie new he'd screwed up and begrudgingly followed Dance to a part of the set that was away from the cast but still viewable by the archery coach. Dance's commanding and naturally intimidating nature came out. He pushed Alfie against a wall of the set and said to him simply and sternly, ""There are good and bad decisions we make every day... Don't be a person that falls into a path bad decisions."" Whilst looking him dead in the eye, and remaining amazingly intimidating. 

Alfie hadn't much to say, and scurried away. Dance walked past, full knowing that he wouldn't dick about again. The next shot for the scene that was taken, according to the archery coach, was the one they kept for the actual episode.",26,39,False,spoiler,,,,,

(Season 8 speculation &amp; theory),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/799d6o/everything_has_the_show_already_foreshadowed_how/,ChippieTheGreat,1509185203,"This one's a long post. I'm sorry. The more I thought about it the more I wrote, so for the brief explaination, there are two levels to the theory:

#TL:DR

Theory 1 - There are clues throughout the series that Sansa Stark will end the show as Queen Consort - Married to the King on the Iron Throne. There are three possible Kings she could marry. 
---
Theory 2 - The most likely King Sansa will marry is Jon. There are clues that Sansa will seduce Jon, or somehow trick him into marrying her against his better judgement.
---
---

#Imagery

*Season 1, Episode 4:* Sansa and Septa Mordane walk into the throne room of the Red Keep and are gazing at the Iron Throne as Mordane explains:

&gt; **Someday your husband will sit there and you will sit by his side.**

&gt; And one day, before too long, you will present your son to the court.

&gt; All the lords of Westeros will gather here to see the little prince.

In this scene Mordane is using the image to *teach* Sansa about the responsibilities of being Queen.

*Season 7, Episode 6:* Arya and Sansa are having their confrontation in Aryas room at Winterfell. Arya explains:

&gt; We both wanted to be other people when we were younger.

&gt; **You wanted to be a Queen.**

&gt; **To sit next to a handsome young King on the Iron Throne.**

In this scene Arya is using the image to *taunt* Sansa about her former character.

Note that in both scenes, the women speaking to Sansa are clearly referring to Joffrey. Yet in both cases they dont mention him by name when they use this imagery.

In the second scene, Arya is clearly trying to goad or frighten Sansa. Perhaps shes deliberately bringing this topic of conversation up because her training helps her to realise that deep down Sansa still clings onto this dream.

*Season 6, Episode 10:* Littlefinger explains to Sansa what he truly desires:

&gt; A picture of me, **on the Iron Throne, and you by my side.**

Littlefinger then leans in for a kiss but Sansa stops him and dismisses him by saying:

&gt; Its a pretty picture.

In this scene Littlefinger is using the image to *tempt* Sansa with a vision of her future.

Note how she doesnt stop to tell Littlefinger that his picture is unrealistic, nor does she stop Littlefinger to tell him that she doesnt want to be Queen, or rule the Seven Kingdoms. 

There are a few explanations for this - Maybe Sansas shocked that he tried to kiss her? Maybe shes purposefully teasing him because she still had plans for him at this point in the story?

Or maybe, in that moment, Sansa betrayed her own thoughts. She calls it a pretty picture because she genuinely likes the picture. It's not too dissimilar to a picture shes had in her mind for some time. Sansa still wants to sit beside the Iron Throne. But she doesnt want to be Littlefingers Queen. The image Littlefinger presents to Sansa is *almost* perfect, but its not enough to tempt Sansa into marrying him.

It strikes me as curious that three times in the series someone has been speaking privately with Sansa and used this exact imagery for wildly different reasons.

But there are two other interesting quotes to consider.

*Season 2, Episode 3:* Sansa is having dinner with Cersei, Myrcella and Tommen. Myrcella innocently asks about Sansas marriage to Joffrey and Sansa replies:

&gt; **Im counting the days until the fighting is done and I can pledge my love to the King in sight of the gods.**

*Season 2 Episode 7:* Sansa has just had her first period. She is talking with Cersei, who says:

&gt; **You may never love the King, but you will love his children.**

Well come back to these two quotes later. But for now recognise that, just like the first two quotes, in context these characters are obviously referring to Joffrey, but taken at face value they could all be foreshadowing Sansas final fate in the series.

---

#**Sansa in the Throne room**

Sansa appeared in the Throne room several times throughout the first two seasons:

*Season 1, Episode 4:* Sansa and Septa Mordane discuss her impending marriage. The Iron Throne is vacant in this scene. The scene ends when Sansa brings up the fact that her grandfather and uncle were murdered in this room by the Mad King (as he sat on the Iron Throne).

*Season 1, Episode 8:* Sansa kneels before Joffrey (sitting on the Iron Throne) and pleads for her fathers life. The final shot of the episode is the camera panning down on the Iron Throne as it consumes her. 

*Season 1, Episode 10:* Sansa watches from the side of the court as Joffrey (sitting on the Iron Throne) orders that the bards tongue be cut out. He then leads her out of the room to taunt her on the ramparts where he displays her fathers head.

*Season 2, Episode 3:* Sansa kneels before the Iron Throne as Joffrey (standing in front of the Iron Throne) threatens her and then has her stripped and beaten before Tyrion arrives and stops him.

*Season 2, Episode 9:* Sansa is summoned to the Throne room where Joffrey (standing in front of the Iron Throne) forces her to kiss his sword before the battle of Blackwater. The final shot shows the Iron Throne as it pans to the right and the shot is consumed by a brazier (on fire).

*Season 2, Episode 10:* Sansa watches from the side of the court as Joffrey (on the Iron Throne) showers favours on his allies. When Loras proposes that Joffrey marry Margaery, Cersei tells Joffrey that Sansa should be set aside so that Joffrey will be free to marry Margaery. Sansa turns to exit the throne room and starts to walk away before Lifflefinger stops her to tell her that she is still Joffreys toy and that he wants to help her escape Kings Landing.

Every single scene where Sansa witnesses Joffrey in the Throne room she either watches from the side-lines as the game is played - where she is just another pawn - or shes on her knees in front of the Throne as a victim of injustice. Throughout her time in King's Landing, perhaps Sansa was watching and learning about how important the Iron Throne was. How it *commands* power. Perhaps she dreamt of how awesome it would be for her to be the one sitting beside that throne, wielding all the power

---

#**Theory 1**

Season 1 Sansa wanted to sit next to a handsome young King on the Iron Throne because she had a nave dream of an exciting life at court where she could be adored and admired.

Season 8 Sansa wants to sit next to a King on the Iron Throne because she now believes that the world is cruel and vicious and that she needs power to protect herself.

In Season 8 (once the fighting is done, as you might say), Sansa will be given a choice to marry the occupant of the Iron Throne and she will accept. If we wanted to completely capture the spirit of Septa Mordanes prediction then a suitable final scene would be Sansas husband sitting on the Iron Throne, with her at his side, and they will be announcing to the court that she is pregnant with their child. If Sansa and the King are in a loveless marriage then this will also make Cerseis prediction from Season 2 come to pass.

Thus, the show would end with Sansa having completed a satisfying character arc, and the writers will pat themselves on the back for having brilliantly foreshadowed Sansas fate at least five times throughout the series.

---

#**The Candidates**

From my understanding, even if the Iron Throne still exists by the end of the show, there would only be three possible ways this ending could go down:

**Bachelor Number 1: Tyrion Lannister:** If Jon and Dany were both to die in the War for the Dawn, Tyrion may become Danys heir in the eyes of her allies. Jon and/or Dany may even declare Tyrion to be their heir before the final battle. This is not to mention the fact that Tyrion is also naturally the heir of Cersei and Jamie if they were to die. Could Tyrion end up as King? Its not impossible. It might instead be the case that Tyrion becomes a kind of Lord Protector for the realm as it begins to transition into something like a constitutional monarchy. Either way, Tyrion would sit on the Iron Throne.

Under these circumstances it is very easy to imagine Sansa and Tyrion marrying again. Sansa respects Tyrion for the kindness he showed her. Tyrion was always fond of Sansa, and admitted to Shae that he was attracted to her. Together they could be an effective ruling partnership. And moreover, if Tyrion became King he might want to marry Sansa to secure the support of the North. It would also be a satisfying conclusion to Sansas arc that whereas before she only cared for handsome pretty young men like Joffrey and Loras, she has now matured to the point where she instead values Tyrions strength of character and intelligence, and is willing to ignore the fact that hes a dwarf.

**Bachelor Number 2: Gendry:** This match makes some sense. Gendry has adventured with Ayra, hes fought beside Jon, and like Sansa hes been through some horrible ordeals. These two characters *could* get along well enough to agree a marriage - Its impossible to say until we see these characters interact.

But a compelling piece of evidence is that this marriage would bring to pass Robert Baratheons statement to Ned Stark back in *Season 1 Episode 1*:

&gt; You helped me win the Iron Throne, now help me keep the damn thing.

&gt; We were meant to rule together.

&gt; If your sister had lived, wed have been bound by blood.

&gt; Well, its not too late.

&gt; **I have a son, you have a daughter.**

&gt; **Well join our houses.**

The beauty of this statement is that, just like Septa Mordane and Ayra and Cersei and Sansa in the previous quotes I mentioned, Robert is referring to Joffrey, but doesnt mention him by name. 

However: Can Gendry really become King? Its very unlikely. Even though hes Roberts son, its well established that bastardry is a serious impediment to the legitimacy of a ruler. Even Ramsay (who had been legitimised by royal decree) was anxious of how the arrival of his baby brother would affect his own position. Would the series really end with Gendry on the Iron Throne? It seems unlikely that many would support his claim. And its unclear if he even wants to rule the Seven Kingdoms.

**Bachelor Number 3: Jon Snow (aka. Aegon Targaryen)**: Its very possible the series will end with Jon as King given his parentage.

But there are many problems with the idea that he would marry Sansa. Firstly, there is no clear rationale for Jon to marry Sansa in the show - Jon already commands the respect of the North. He would surely be better served by marrying into a southern house to secure his support in the south. 

And pairing Jon with Sansa is problematic from the perspective of the characters (they know each other as siblings) and the show-watchers (I doubt this ending would go down well among fans and the writers must surely know this).

However, theres already lots of speculation from the books that Jon and Sansa will marry ([see Alt Shift Exs video for more details](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q14AuWiltIw)). If GRRM really is planning to wrap up his series with a Jon and Sansa marriage, perhaps D&amp;D will feel that they had no choice but to follow his lead. 

*Season 7, Episode 1*: Sansa and Jon are arguing about how to rule (Ill only reference the important points of this scene):

&gt; Sansa: Joffrey never let anyone question his authority; do you think he was a good King?

&gt; Jon: Do you think Im Joffrey?

&gt; Sansa: **Youre as far from Joffrey as anyone Ive ever met.**

&gt; Jon: Thank you.

&gt; Sansa: [who is gazing at him] Youre good at this, you know?

&gt; Jon: At what?

&gt; Sansa: **At ruling.**

&gt; Jon: No

&gt; Sansa: You are They respect you, they really do [she grabs him by the arm] But you have to be smarter than father. You have to be smarter than Robb. I loved them, I miss them, but they both made stupid mistakes and they both lost their heads for it.

&gt; Jon: And how should I be smarter? **By listening to you?**

&gt; Sansa: Would that be so terrible?

This scene is Sansa explaining how Jon could be a great King if he followed her guidance. Maybe once Sansa learns that Jon is her cousin, not her brother, she will quickly warm to the idea of marrying him. If she really does want to become Queen, then surely she will find a way to make a marriage with Jon work.

Are you following me so far? 

Good. Then put on your tinfoil hats and join me as we go into a second, very dark, theory. Theory 1 stands independent of Theory 2, but Theory 2 takes the notion of a Jon &amp; Sansa union and makes it *even more* disgusting.

---

#**Sansa mirroring Cersei's story**

Later in that very scene from *Season 7 Episode 1*:

&gt; Sansa: Everyone who's ever crossed [Cersei] she's found a way to murder.

&gt; Jon: You almost sound as if you admire her...

&gt; Sansa: ... **I learned a great deal from her.**

What exactly did Sansa learn from Cersei?

*Season 2, Episode 9:* Cersei and Sansa are in the Red Keep during the battle of Blackwater, Cersei is explaining to Sansa what will happen if the City falls to Stannis:

&gt; ""If it were anyone else outside those gates, I might have hoped for a *private audience*.

&gt; But this is Stannis Baratheon.

&gt; I'd have a better chance of seducing his *horse*.

&gt; Have I shocked you little dove?

&gt; **Tears aren't a woman's only weapon.**

&gt; **The best one's between your legs.**

&gt; **Learn how to use it.""**

Does everyone remember how Cersei Lannister seized power in Season 1?

That's right: She seduced *her cousin* Lancel and manipulated him into endangering King Robert's life by getting him drunk in the boar hunt.

Moreover, Cersei seems to have, long ago, seduced and manipulated *her own brother* Jamie, and is, as of Season 7, using her pregnancy as a means to *emotionally control* him.

It also should be pointed out that Cersei herself is the child of two cousins: Tywin and Joanna Lannister.

---

#**Theory 2**

What if Sansa is consumed by the desire to become Queen? 

What if the War for the Dawn ends with Dany dead and Jon hailed as the new King? 

Sansa will see an opportunity to become Queen. Jon will naturally be reluctant to marry his own cousin (who he knows as his sister), so Sansa will take extraordinary measures.

Sansa will seduce Jon.

Absurd? Maybe not. 

---

#**Jon mirroring Robb's story**

Remember that, in this scenario, Jon will be dealing with the grief of losing Dany, the impending responsibilities of Kingship, and he'll still be grasping with the revelation of his parentage. Jon might close the series in a vulnerable place. And in his vulnerability he may make a terrible error in judgement.

Does this sound familiar? It should - It parallels Robb and Talisa back in Season 2. Just like Jon, Robb had lost loved ones, been betrayed, and was struggling with the burdens of command. In his grief Robb was looking for comfort, and found it with Talisa even though he knew he shouldn't be with her.

*Season 1, Episode 9*: Maester Aemon explains to Jon Snow that:

&gt; **Love is the death of duty.**

&gt; **What is honour compared to a womans love?**

Part of the reason Robb married Talisa is because, since he slept with her, he felt honour bound to marry her. In the show Robb clearly loves Talisa, so this isn't really addressed, but in the books it's made clear that Robb just made a terrible mistake and feels that marrying [Jeyne Westerling] is the only decent thing for him to do.

Sansa might summise that if she and Jon sleep together then, just like Robb, Jon will feel compelled to marry her.

Would Jon really be so stupid as to sleep with Sansa?

Well, consider this: Perhaps Jon *doesn't even realise* he's sleeping with Sansa!

---

#**Jon mirroring Littlefinger's story**

Though it's never explicitly made clear in the show, in the books, a crucial component of Littlefinger's backstory is that one night, when he was young, he got drunk and was taken to his room. Lysa Tully snuck in after him, and the two then had sex. Still drunk, Petyr believed he was having sex with Catelyn.

So there's a clear precedent in the source material for a man to have sex with a woman, whilst believing that he was actually having sex with *another* woman.

Jon isn't the type to get drunk. 

However: If Jon were injured in the final battle then a Maester may be giving him milk of the poppy to aid his recovery.

Sansa knows all about the effects of milk of the poppy.

*Season 1, Episode 8*: Sansa is pleading for her father's life and claims that the milk of the poppy changed his character and confused him.

&gt; ""He was badly hurt.

&gt; Maester Pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy.

&gt; **He wasnt himself.**

&gt; **Otherwise he never would have said it.""**

In Jon's delirious state, Jon might think that Sansa is Ygritte.

Jon will then come to his senses and realise the horror of what he has done. But he will feel that the only way to make amends is to protect Sansa's honour by marrying her.

A dark and chilling way to end Sansa's journey as a character would be her tricking Jon into sleeping with her, knowing that he will then feel compelled to marry her. In doing so, Sansa will become like her childhood hero Cersei. 

The fighting will be done and Sansa will be married to a handsome young King. This King will sit on the Iron Throne with Sansa by his side. She will declare her love for him in the sight of the gods, but she will never truly love him. But she will love his children.

Game of Thrones would end its story by giving its audience one last devastating shock. Sansa has been a victim to the greatest villains of the show: Cersei, Joffrey, Littlefinger, and Ramsay. But the series will end with sweet little Sansa Stark becoming the villain of the story.

#**One Last Thought**

Want to take this theory to a whole new level of disturbing tinfoil?

Consider this: As Queen, Sansa would need a guard. Perhaps the Hound is available?

*Season 2, Episode 7*:

&gt; Hound: Killing is the sweetest thing there is.

&gt; Sansa: Why are you always so hateful?

&gt; Hound: **Youll be glad of the hateful things I do someday when youre Queen, and Im all that stands between you and your *beloved* King.**

I'll let you ponder the troubling implications of that statement.

But if you look back to when Stannis first arrives at the Wall he tells Sam that its a whole lot of dragon glass at Dragon Stone. Sam even mentions how Stannis told him about it but he didnt believe it.

   My thing is , if Ser Davos is with Jon and hes lived at Dragon Stone for years why wouldnt he tell Jon about it? He knows that they need dragon glass in order to beat the white walkers but he just doesnt mention that his home of many many years is filled with that very substance.

So one of the big criticisms of the Beyond the Wall episode is that it really felt like the whole Jon sequence after Dany arrived was really unnecessary and just for shock value. Why didn't he just get on Drogon and fly away with everyone else?

Well I think a reason for this is because he COULDN'T. We know that dragonriders have a special bond with their dragons and it is incredibly likely that Jon will ride Rheagal in season 8 (RIP Viserion). So, due to all the magic and stuff of Targaryen's and dragons, they couldn't let Jon get on Drogon and this whole sequence was the best alternative D&amp;D could come up with.

So, yeah. I think this would be pretty cool if it were true. Of course, this could be totally debunked if there is precident of a dragonrider in the past riding someone else's dragon, but I cannot think of any off the top of my head. Does anyone know of any?",15,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

I think my experience with the show will be different than other fans, as I go into it already knowing a ton of spoilers. 

Nonetheless Westeros and Essos are both richly written worlds, both populated with characters I really love and *really HATE.* I really like Jon Snow and his trouble with his parentage, and most of the Stark family. 

Tyrion Lannister is also really great. There is something about Daenerys Targaryen that resonates with me too. Maybe its her journey where she is thrust into a position of power and comes to use it in an interesting way, as a kind but sometimes cruel leader. 

Fuck Joffrey Baratheon, though. And Cersei too. And Jaime. But I hate Joffrey most.

Anyways, Im really excited to see what this show has in store for me!",6,7,False,spoiler,,,,,

Since Game of Thrones went with the fan service direction (giving up intrigue in favor for big fight scenes and CGI clashes), I think the Night King will die to Jon Snow. It will be an aerial fight between Daenerys on Drogon, Jon Snow on Rhaegal, and the Night King on undead Viserion. At first it will be just Daenerys against the Night King, but slowly Drogon begins to lose since he does not have the advantage of never tiring like an undead dragon would. But that's when Jon, mounted atop Rhaegal, swoops in and delivers a strong blow that takes both Rhaegal and Viserion down to the ground. Jon and the Night King fall off their mounts and begin to fight, while Rhaegal and Viserion also clash. Rhaegal inevitably dies, but soon after, Jon's sword lights aflame and he kills the Night King, therefore killing undead Viserion and all the undead army as well.

So all dragons but Drogon die. Now this wouldn't be the ending I'd want, since I'd prefer Jon actually sacrifice Daenerys to achieve the flaming sword, but by the direction of the show, I believe it'll go down this way.",8,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Its thought to be made of living fire, which certainly applies to molten gold (Jamie's hand is made up of gold). Game of Thrones does like its molten gold imagery, as Daeneryss ill-fated brother Viserys can attest to.

Theres also a possibility, however, that the burning is metaphorical, and Jaimes gold hand will simply glint in the firelight, giving the illusion of burning. Nothing is ever as it seems in matters of prophecy on Game of Thrones.

He is already a king slayer, he sacrificed his kingdom, too.

I know this is far-fetched and digging up too much but it would be cool if it turns out to be a reality.",5,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

If you have read this theory many times before, bear with me.  There is a key reason why I believe Tyrion being a Targaryen bastard is key to the story.

&gt;""He is the prince that was promised, and his is the song of ice and fire."". He appears to look at Dany then, as if seeing her, and then he adds that ""There must be one more,"" and ""The dragon has three heads."".

GRRM on the Three Headed Dragon Prophecy:

&gt;""Three heads of the dragon... yes... but the third will not **nessesarily BE a Targaryen**...""

He has Targaryen blood but he is not *necessarily* a Targaryen.

I can already see the comments being posted in regards to Genna Lannister's remarks:

&gt;(To Jaime) ""Sweetling, I have known you since you were a babe at Joanna's breast. [...] but Tyrion is Tywin's son, not you. I said so once to your father's face, and he would not speak to me for half a year. [...].""

But to emphasize a part:

&gt;**""I said so once to your father's face, and he would not speak to me for half a year""**

Tywin *knew* that Tyrion was not his.  Why would Tywin keep Tyrion?  Because Tywin loved Joanna (still a Lannister by maiden name), and Tyrion was still *her* son. And Tywin had to live with that throughout Tyrion's life. As much as it might hurt Tywin, Joanna and Aerys were friends since they were young. Tyrion isn't a *necessarily* Targaryen *or* Lannister because he is a bastard.

&gt;""Let me give you some counsel, bastard,"" Lannister said. ""Never forget what you are, for surely the world will not. Make it your strength. Then it can never be your weakness. Armor yourself in it, and it will never be used to hurt you.""

&gt;Jon was in no mood for anyone's counsel. ""What do you know about being a bastard?""

&gt;**""All dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes.""**

&gt;Am I? the dwarf replied, sardonic. **Do tell my lord father. MY mother died birthing me, and hes never been sure.** ~Jon I *A Game of Thrones*

...

&gt;""Remember this, boy. **All dwarfs may be bastards, yet not all bastards need be dwarfs.**""

There was a quote that parallels this with Daenerys and her dragons knowing who she is (I think in the house of the undying?) but for not it is not quite important.

Between Joanna and Aerys, reportedly:

&gt;""The scurrilous rumor that Joanna Lannister gave up her maidenhead to Prince Aerys the night of his fathers coronation and enjoyed a brief reign after he ascended the Iron Throne as his paramour can safely be discounted"". ~ *The World of Ice and Fire*

Joanna was born 245 AC and 250 AC and Jaeherys II's coronation was in 259 AC., meaning Joanna was between 9-14 years old.  If the rumor is to be believed, which at this age it is, then Aerys' initial encounter with Joanna happened before Tywin and Joanna where even together.

&gt;""It has been reliably reported, however, that King Aerys took unwonted liberties with Lady Joanna's person during her bedding ceremony, to Tywin's displeasure. Not long thereafter, Queen Rhaella dismissed Joanna Lannister from her service. No reason for this was ever given, but Lady Joanna departed at once for Casterly Rock and seldom visited King's Landing thereafter.""

Ser Barristan to Daenerys' Chapter in ADwD:

&gt;""Prince Aerys... as a youth, he was taken with a certain lady of Casterly Rock, a cousin of Tywin Lannister.  When she and Tywin wed, your father drank too much wine at the wedding feast and was heard to say that it was a great pity that the lord's right to the first night had been abolished.  A drunken jape, no more, but Tywin Lannister was not a man to forget such words, or the.. the liberties your father took during the bedding.""  His face reddened.  ""I have said too much, Your Grace. I-""

Aerys' Relationship with Rhaella starts to decline. 

&gt;Sadly, the marriage between Aerys II Targaryen and his sister, Rhaella, was not as happy; though she turned a blind eye to most of the king's infidelities, the queen did not approve of his ""turning my ladies into his whores."" (Joanna Lannister was not the first lady to be dismissed abruptly from Her Grace's service, nor was she the last). Relations between the king and queen grew even more strained when Rhaella proved unable to give Aerys any further children. Miscarriages in 263 and 264 were followed by a stillborn daughter born in 267. Prince Daeron, born in 269, survived for only half a year. Then came another stillbirth in 270, another miscarriage in 271, and Prince Aegon, born two turns premature in 272, dead in 273.

In 272, Aerys summoned Joanna to court for a tournament:

&gt;Sadly, the marriage between Aerys II Targaryen and his sister, Rhaella, was not as happy; though she turned a blind eye to most of the king's infidelities, **the queen did not approve of his ""turning my ladies into his whores."" (Joanna Lannister was not the first lady to be dismissed abruptly from Her Grace's service, nor was she the last)**. Relations between the king and queen grew even more strained when Rhaella proved unable to give Aerys any further children. Miscarriages in 263 and 264 were followed by a stillborn daughter born in 267. Prince Daeron, born in 269, survived for only half a year. Then came another stillbirth in 270, another miscarriage in 271, and Prince Aegon, born two turns premature in 272, dead in 273.

&gt;At the great Anniversary Tourney of 272 AC, held to commemorate Aerys's tenth year upon the Iron Throne, Joanna Lannister brought her six-year-old twins Jaime and Cersei from Casterly Rock to present before the court. **The king (very much in his cups) asked her if giving suck to them had ""ruined your breasts, which were so high and proud.""** The question greatly amused Lord Tywin's rivals, who were always pleased to see the Hand slighted or made mock of, but Lady Joanna was humiliated. Tywin Lannister attempted to return his chain of office the next morning, but the king refused to accept his resignation.

Then, a year later in 273 AC, Tyrion was born.

&gt;In 273 AC, however, Lady Joanna was taken to childbed once again at Casterly Rock, where she died delivering Lord Tywin's second son. **Tyrion, as the babe was named, was a malformed, dwarfish babe born with stunted legs, an oversized head, and mismatched, demonic eyes (some reports also suggested he had a tail, which was lopped off at his lord father's command). Lord Tywin's Doom**, the smallfolk called this ill-made creature, and Lord Tywin's Bane. Upon hearing of his birth, King Aerys infamously said, **""The gods cannot abide such arrogance. They have plucked a fair flower from his hand and given him a monster in her place, to teach him some humility at last.""**

However, in Oldtown, it goes into more detail (and I think in Oberyn's account from rumors):

&gt;huge head, thick black hair, a beard, an evil eye, lion's claws, **with teeth so long he was not able to close his mouth, and both male and female genitals**

Dragons are both male and female.

If it is to be believed that Jon and Daenerys are the  two of the three heads of the dragon, then Tyrion would fit perfectly because all of their mothers died in childbirth.  Only death can pay for life. Tyrion has a green eye and a black eye.  In Dunc and Egg:

&gt;Egg had big eyes, and somehow his shaven head made them look even larger. **In the dimness of the lamplit cellar they looked black**, but in better light their true colour could be seen: deep and dark and purple. Valyrian eyes.

Tyrion's hair color does not match his siblings or his father's.  He has a mixture of pale blonde and black hair. Jon notes of Tyrion's hair:

&gt;hair so blond it seemed white

Not only that, but if you've read TWoIaF, then you know that dwarf babies and monstrosities is **very** common among the Targaryens.

After the Battle of Blackwater, Tyrion is usurped by Lord Tywin as hand (in GRRM's own words, usurped).  Then Tyrion asks for his rightful claim to Casterly Rock.

&gt;I knew the answer before I asked, Tyrion said. Eighteen years since Jaime joined the Kingsguard, and I never once raised the issue. I must have known. I must always have known. ""Why?"" he made himself ask, though he knew he would rue the question.

&gt;""You ask that? You, who killed your mother to come into the world? You are an ill-made, devious, disobedient, spiteful little creature full of envy, lust, and low cunning. **Men's laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors, since I cannot prove that you are not mine. To teach me humility, the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my father's sigil and his father's before him.** But neither gods nor men shall ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse.""

So what if Tywin was not only upset at Tyrion as who he is, but also upset at the suggestion that someone *who is not his son* is asking for Casterly Rock?  Specifically *the bastard of the man who made a joke of him his entire time as Hand* while actively trying to ruin his life by taking Jaime away from him and placing him in King's Guard.

Furthermore, when Tywin states Tyrion *is* his son, he is just doing it to use him.  When Tywin names him hand, he calls him his son.  When Tyrion points a crossbow at him (at least in the show), Tyrion is like ""No.  You are my son.""  And then when Tywin gets shot he states:

&gt;**""You . . . you are no . . . no son of mine.""**

&gt;""Now that's where you're wrong, Father. Why, I believe I'm you **writ small**. Do me a kindness now, and die quickly. I have a ship to catch.""

The writ small is important for later.

Continuing with Tyrion and the Three headed dragon. Tyrion's obsession with dragons and the parallels between him being a dragon:

&gt;Tyrion had a morbid fascination with dragons. When he had first come to King's Landing for his sister's wedding to Robert Baratheon, he had made it a point to seek out the dragon skulls that had hung on the walls of Targaryen's throne room. King Robert had replaced them with banners and tapestries, but Tyrion had persisted until he found the skulls in the dank cellar where they had been stored. He had expected to find them impressive, perhaps even frightening. He had not thought to find them beautiful. Yet they were... Tyrion stood in that dank cellar for a long time, staring at Balerion's huge, empty-eyed skull until his torch burned low, trying to grasp the size of the living animal, to imagine how it must have looked when it spread its great black wings and swept across the skies, breathing fire.

&gt;...

&gt;""Dragons,"" Tyrion told him. ""What good is that? There are no more dragons,"" the boy said with the easy certainty of youth. ""So they say,"" Tyrion replied. ""Sad, isn't it? When I was your age, I used to dream of having a dragon of my own."" ""You did?"" the boy said suspiciously. Perhaps he thought Tyrion was making fun of him.

Tyrion and Jon have similar dragon dreams:

&gt;""Oh, yes. Even a stunted, twisted, ugly little boy can look down over the world when he's seated on a dragon's back."" Tyrion pushed the bearskin aside and climbed to his feet. ""I used to start fires in the bowels of Casterly Rock and stare at the flames for hours, pretending they were dragonfire. Sometimes I'd imagine my father burning. At other times, my sister."" Jon Snow was staring at him, a look equal parts horror and fascination. Tyrion guffawed. ""Don't look at me that way, bastard. I know your secret. You've dreamt the same kind of dreams.""

And they even become friends as both being outcasts of their families.  The weakest of Daenerys' dragons is Viserion has gold scales:

&gt;The surface of the shell was covered with tiny scales, and as she turned the egg between her fingers, they shimmered like polished metal in the light of the setting sun. One egg was a deep green, with burnished bronze flecks that came and went depending on how Dany turned it. Another was pale cream streaked with gold. The last was black, as black as a midnight sea, yet alive with scarlet ripples and swirls.

Which, appropriately, was named after her brother who died with a crown of molten gold.

&gt;**Child of three**, they had called her, daughter of death, slayer of lies, bride of fire. So many threes. Three fires, three mounts to ride, three treasons. ""The dragon has three heads,"" she sighed.

Jon, Daenerys, Tyrion are all children of Aerys Targaryen's lineage.  Tyrion also has a fascination with Wildfire.

Aerys appointed Jaime as kingsguard, foresaking all lands, titles, and is to never father children.  This infuriates Tywin because Jaime is his only true son.

&gt;**Aerys had chosen him to spite his father, to rob Lord Tywin of his heir**.

There is a good deal more parallels between Tyrion and Dragons.  For instance, Jaime searches for Tyrion in after his father is killed and only finds dragons.  [Here is a good post where you can read in depth the countless times Tyrion is paralleled dragons](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/4qrsbf/spoilers_everything_tyrion_joanna_and_aerys_a/)

But one of the things I always bring up is that **Aerys II Targaryen was the one to mint the gold dragon coin for Westeros**.  The source of power and pride for House Lannister is in the form of a **golden dragon**.

_______

#Tywin's Doom

________

&gt;""And is that the end of it?"" Cersei asked, amused. Looked at in the right light, it could be seen as a salutary lesson. ""No, Your Grace. **At the end a dragon hatches from an egg and devours all of the lions**."" 

Cersei watched a play as a dragon hatched and devoured all the lions.  Now, given the fact that Tyrion is a bastard of King Aerys, would it be poetic for Tyrion to kill off Jaime and Cersei, ending Tywin's line much like Tywin obliterates the House Reyne?

After Cersei sets up Tyrion with Shae and Tyrion learns of Tywin lying about Tysha being a whore, through Jaime while he is releasing Tyrion, and the fact that Jaime is in on it, Tyrion hits Jaime:

&gt;""Oh, you've earned more than that, Jaime. You and my sweet sister and our loving father, yes, I can't begin to tell you what you've earned. But you'll have it, that I swear to you. **A Lannister always pays his debts**.

Now, this will require a different post and interpretation, but just use have a willing suspension of disbelief. Just a nugget to get you to do so:

&gt;**I used to dream that one day I'd be rich enough to send a Faceless Man after my sweet sister.** ~Tyrion ACoK

And since Cersei is paranoid and certain that Tyrion is the valonqar:

&gt;[Laughs] Prophecies are, you know, a double edge sword. You have to handle them very carefully; I mean, they can add depth and interest to a book, but you dont want to be too literal or too easy... In the Wars of the Roses, that you mentioned, there was one Lord who had been prophesied he would die beneath the walls of a certain castle and he was superstitious at that sort of walls, so he never came anyway near that castle. He stayed thousands of leagues away from that particular castle because of the prophecy. However, he was killed in the first battle of St. Paul de Vence and when they found him dead he was outside of an inn whose sign was the picture of that castle! [Laughs] So you know? Thats the way prophecies come true in unexpected ways. The more you try to avoid them, the more you are making them true, and I make a little fun with that.

Arya is going to being Cersei's valonqar while using Jaime's face to give Cersei the justice Ned Stark couldn't give to her.  Jaime is going to be killed by Tyrion, and Tyrion will plot Cersei's death using Arya.

Jaime's dream in ASoS:

Jaime asks ""Who are you?"" to a bunch of cowl robed men:

&gt;Around him stood a dozen tall dark figures in **cowled robes that hid their faces**. In their hands were spears. Who are you? he demanded of them. What business do you have in Casterly Rock?

In AFfC's prologue (before we learn about valonqar and Jaime's dream), Pate is set up and killed by a faceless man:

&gt;**""Who are you?""**

&gt;""A stranger. No one. Truly.""

Cowled robes are the clothing of the Faceless Men order, as revealed by Arya I in a AFfC. ""Who are you?"" Is also heavily emphasized in what few chapters Arya has in AFfC, appearing seven times in her second chapter when she begins training with the Faceless Men. Jaime is lead down stairs into this pit:

&gt;...

&gt;something dark and terrible lurked there, something that wanted him.

&gt;...

&gt;What place is this?

&gt;Your place. **The voice echoed; it was a hundred voices, a thousand, the voices of all the Lannisters since Lann the Clever, whod lived at the dawn of days. But most of all it was his fathers voice**, and beside Lord Tywin stood his sister, pale and beautiful, a torch burning in her hand. Joffrey was there as well, the son theyd made together, and behind them a dozen more dark shapes with golden hair.

Now the whole sword is linked to lightbringer, but that is, again, for another post. Tywin's voice dominating the voices of all the past Lannisters is a reflection of Tywin's legacy he is trying to carry on.

Brienne asks:
&gt;What lives in the darkness?

&gt;**Doom**. No bear, he knew. No lion. **Only doom**.

Then comes Cersei's dream in AfFC:

&gt;She dreamt she sat the Iron Throne, high above them all. The courtiers were brightly colored mice below. Great lords and proud ladies knelt before her. Bold young knights laid their swords at her feet and pleaded for her favors, and the queen smiled down at at them. **Until the dwarf appeared as if from nowhere, pointing at her and howling with laughter.** The lords and ladies began to chuckle too, hiding their smiles behind their hands. Only then did the queen realize she was naked.

&gt;Horrified, she tried to cover herself with her hands. The barbs and blades of the Iron Throne bit into her flesh as she crouched to hide her shame. Blood ran red down her legs, as steel teeth gnawed at her buttocks. When she tried to stand, her foot slipped through a gap in the twisted metal. The more she struggled the more the throne engulfed her, tearing chunks of flesh from her breasts and belly, slicing at her arms and legs until they were slick and red, glistening.

&gt;**And all the while her brother capered below, laughing.**

The laughing is explained in Jaime's second dream that appears in AFfC:

&gt;That night he dreamt that he was back in the Great Sept of Baelor, still standing vigil over his fathers corpse. The sept was still and dark, until a woman emerged from the shadows and walked slowly to the bier.  ""Sister?"" he said. But it was not Cersei. She was all in grey, a silent sister. A hood and veil concealed her features, but he could see the candles burning in the green pools of her eyes.

&gt;Sister, he said, what would you have of me? His last word echoed up and down the sept, mememememememe. I am not your sister, Jaime. She raised a pale soft hand and pushed her hood back.

&gt;Will you forget your own lord father too? I wonder if you ever knew him, truly. Her eyes were green, her hair spun gold. He could not tell how old she was. Fifteen, he thought, or fifty. She climbed the steps to stand above the bier. **He could never abide being laughed at. That was the thing he hated most.** 

&gt;**Who are you?** He had to hear her say it. **The question is, who are you?**

...

&gt;""We all dream of things we cannot have. Tywin dreamed that his son would be a great knight, that his daughter would be a queen. **He dreamed they would be so strong and brave and beautiful that no one would ever laugh at them**.

Joanna Lannister is dressed as death. The Silent Sisters represents the stranger (who the faceless man says he was in Pate's chapter), which is the God of Death in the faith of seven and one of the forms of the Many-Faced Gods.  It is even easy to believe that the stranger comes from the Faceless Men considering that they both originated in Essos.

Interesting thing is that Jaime asks the woman, before he knows who she is:

&gt;Sister, he said, what would you have of me? His last word echoed up and down the sept, mememememememe.

As if to say death wanted Jaime.  And when Jaime asks the cowled person, *in his second dream as well as his first*, ""Who are you?"" the cowled robed person turns the question and emphasizes, ""The question is, 'Who are you'?""

As if she were playing the game of facess with Jaime.  **BUT NOT ONLY THAT IT IS ALSO THE QUESTION IN THE FIRST LINE OF THE RAINS OF CASTAMERE**.  All of this happens Tywin's dead body, the man who immortalized the obliteration of House Reyne with the song Reynes of Castamere. It is a double entendre.

Joanna, the woman Tywin loved, poses the question ""Who are you?"" to **Tywin's only heir** all the while foreshadowing a Faceless Man will end Cersei's line:

&gt;That Night Tyrion Lannister dreamed of a battle that turned the hills of Westeros as read as blood. He was in the midst of it, dealing death with an axe as big as he was, fighting side by side with Barristan the Bold and Bittersteel as dragons wheeled across the sky above them. In the dream he had two heads, both noseless. His father led the enemy, so he slew him once again. **Then he killed his brother, Jamie,** *hacking at his face until it was a red ruin*, **laughing every time he struck a blow**. Only when the fight was finished did he realize that his second head was weeping.

Tyrion is going to kill of Jaime and Arya is going to use his face to kill Cersei.  Arya is going to bring justice to Cersei that Ned tried to bring before his arrest and eventual death.

&gt;**Needle was Robb and Bran and Rickon, her mother and her father, even Sansa. Needle was Winterfell's grey walls, and the laughter of its people.** Needle was the summer snows, Old Nan's stories, the heart tree with its red leaves and scary face, the warm earthy smell of the glass gardens, the sound of the north wind rattling the shutters of her room. Needle was Jon Snow's smile

Tyrion is laughed at throughout his life and in numerous passages, but most notably during the start of his downfall when Shae:

&gt;""He used to make me tell him how big he was.  *My giant*, I had to call him, *my giant of Lannister*""

&gt;Oswald Kettleblack was the first to laugh.  Boros and Meryn joined in, **then Cersei**, Ser Loras, and more lords and ladies than he could count.  The sudden gale of mirth made the rafters sing and shook the Iron Throne.  ""It's true,"" Shae protested. ""My giant of Lannister""

&gt;The laughter swelled twice as loud.  Their mouths were twisted in merriment, their bellies shook.  Some laughed so hard that snot flew from their nostrils.

The Rains of Castamere lyrics feeds into the idea that Tyrion will flip the Reynes of Castamere narrative on his father:

&gt;*And* **who are you**, *the proud lord said*,

&gt;*that I must bow so low?*

&gt;*Only a cat of a different coat,*

&gt;*that's all the truth I know.*

&gt;*In a coat of gold or a coat of red,*

&gt;*a lion still has claws,*

&gt;*And mine are long and sharp, my lord,*

&gt;*as long and sharp as yours.*

Again, the question ""Who are you?"" was reflected back and emphasized by Joanna to Jaime.  It is what the faceless men ask to play the game of faces.  Now picture this: instead of Roger Reyne being the one posing the question, think of Tywin posing the question.  The rest of the lyrics fits perfectly.  

&gt;*Only a cat of a different coat, that's all the truth I know*

In this instance, it is not the *cat's* coat but a **coat of arms**. When bastards take up coat of arms, they usually either invert the colors, **or** take up their father's coat of arms as Glendon Flowers did in *the Mystery Knight*.  Tyrion is not only a Lannister through Joanna (Tywin's first cousin, mind you), he is also a *Targaryen*: One of the three heads of the Dragon in the Targaryen coat of arms.

&gt;*In a coat of gold or a coat of red,*

The Lannister's coat of arms is a Gold Lion while Reyne was a Red Lion, but in this instance it is a Gold Lion and the **Red** Three-Headed Dragon

&gt;*a lion still has claws,*

Tyrion's birth:

&gt;huge head, thick black hair, a beard, an evil eye, **lion's claws**

...

&gt;*And so he spoke, and so he spoke,*

&gt;*that lord of Castamere,*

&gt;*But now the rains weep o'er his hall,*

&gt;*with no one there to hear.*

&gt;*Yes now the rains weep o'er his hall,*

&gt;*and not a soul to hear*

Tyrion is going to kill off Tywin's lineage, ending his legacy since Tyrion himself is not of Tywin's seed.  Tywin took away Tysha from Tyrion, even though Tysha loved Tyrion and vice versa, he lied to Tyrion saying she was a whore.  Tywin made his soldiers ""have sex"" with her infront of Tyrion and then made Tyrion take her afterwards, while she left with silver in her hands.  Jaime knew of the truth about Tysha, but denied Tyrion the truth. Jaime is the only one in the world at this time Tyrion loved and trusted the most, very possible even deeper than Shae. Cersei spends her entire life hating Tyrion for taking her mother from her all the while also being paranoid that Tyrion is going to kill her and take all she holds dear.  Cersei frames Tyrion as the killer of Joffrey by paying off Shae. And after Tyrion learns it all from Jaime:

&gt;""Oh, you've earned more than that, Jaime. You and my sweet sister and our loving father, yes, I can't begin to tell you what you've earned. But you'll have it, that I swear to you. **A Lannister always pays his debts**.

Instead of going to Varys, Tyrion goes to the Tower of the Hand to find Shae in Tywin's bed. You know what happens.  Then:

&gt;Waddling to the door, he listened a moment, then eased it open slowly.  A lamp burned in the stone niche, casting wan yellow light over the empty hallway.  Only the flame was moving.  Tyrion slid out, holding the crossbow down against his leg.

&gt;He found his father where he knew he'd find him, seated in the dimness of the privy tower, bedrobe hiked up around his hips.  At the sound of the steps, Lord Tywin raised his eyes.

&gt;**Tyrion gave him a mocking half bow. ""My Lord""**

&gt;""Tyrion."" If he was afraid, Tywin Lannister gave no hint of it.  ""Who released you from your cell?""

&gt;""I'd love to tell you, but I swore a holy oath.""

&gt;""The eunuch,"" his father decided. ""I'll have his head for this.  Is that my crossbow?  Put it down.""

&gt;""Will you punish me if I refuse, Father?""

&gt;""This escape is folly.  You are not to be killed, if that is what you fear.  It's still my intent to send you to the Wall, but I could not do it without Lord Tyrell's consent.  Put down the crossbow and we will go back to my chambers and talk of it.""

&gt;""We can talk here just as well.  Perhaps I don't choose to go to the Wall, father.  It's bloody cold up there, and I believe I've had enough coldness from you.  So just tell me something, and I'll be on my way.  One simple question, you owe me that much.""

&gt;""I owe you nothing.""

&gt;""You've given me less than that, all my life, but you'll give me this.  What did you do with Tysha?""

&gt;""Tysha?""

&gt;*He does not even remember her name*.  ""The girl I married.""

&gt;""Oh, yes.  Your first whore.""

&gt;Tyrion took aim at his father's chest.  ""The next time you say that word, I'll kill you.""

&gt;""You do not have the courage.""

&gt;""Shall we find out?  It's a short word, and it seems to come so easily to your lips.""  Tyrion gestured impatiently with the bow.  ""Tysha.  What did you do with her, after my little lesson?""

&gt;""I don't recall.""

&gt;""Try harder.  Did you have her killed?""

&gt;His father pursed his lips.  ""There was no reason for that, she'd learned her place... and had been well paid for her day's work, I seem to recall.  I suppose the steward sent her on her way.  I never thought to inquire.""

&gt;""On her way *where?*""

&gt;""Wherever whores go.""

&gt;Tyrion's finger clenched.  The crossbow *whanged* just as Lord Tywin started to rise.  The bolt slammed into him above the groin and he sat back down with a grunt.  The quarrel had sunk deep, right into the fletching.  Blood seeped out the shaft, dripping down his pubic hair and over his bare thighs.  ""You shot me,"" he said incredulously, his eyes glassy with shock.

&gt;""You always were quick to grasp a situation, my lord,"" Tyrion said.

&gt;""That must be why you're the Hand of the King.""

&gt;""You... you are no... **no son of mine**.

&gt;""Now that's where you're wrong, father.  Why, **I believe I'm you writ small**.  Do me a kindness now, and die quickly.  I have a ship to catch.""

&gt;For once, his father did what Tyrion asked him.  The proof was the sudden stench, as his bowels loosened in the moment of death.  *Well, he was in the right place for it*, Tyrion thought.  But the stink that filled the privy gave ample evidence that the oft-repeated jape about his father was just another lie.

&gt;Lord Tywin Lannister did not, in the end, shit gold.

All Tyrion wanted was to know the whereabouts of Tysha so he could possibly find her, but even with a crossbow pointed at him Tywin denied Tyrion the knowledge and called her a whore. The shit gold jape was started by Aerys II Targaryen as well.  But, again, this is Tyrion starting to flip the narrative of the *Rains of Castamere* on his father by killing off his Tywin's specific family line *becoming* his father in a small way.  George RR Martin even said it himself through Tyrion:

&gt;Why, **I believe I'm you writ small**

Tyrion is Tywin's character written small.",32,7,False,spoiler,,,,,

Thank you, Tywin.

As this quote becomes a bit of a theme throughout the show, we are constantly shown that it is seemingly true.  Robert, Stannis, Renly, Joffrey, Tommen, Cersei, etc...  The only person to be a monarch and not state such is Jon (and possibly Robb and Mance, but I can't remember).  And Jon has proven himself worthy of a crown.

&amp;nbsp;

Now, for Sansa.  I noticed in a rewatch of S7 that when she's in charge of Winterfell, she does claim more than once that she is the lady of Winterfell, in effect saying, ""I am the king.""  She enjoys being in power, that is clear.  But moreseo, she demonstrates her selfishness and potential condition of being unqualified to rule when she tells Brienne:  ""You will go to King's Landing and represent my interests.""  I think this line solidifies that she is A. no true Lady of Winterfell, and B. unfit to rule.

&amp;nbsp;

Clearly, she believes that she is ruling the North (not being a steward for her king), and that her agenda is paramount, not Jon's.  I wonder where this will lead.",24,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

There is one camp that seems to feel when GrrM noted the characters are all ""gray"" and not black and white and the ending will be ""bittersweet"" they tend to believe there are ""no good guys"" and no one to ""root for"" and also many have posted ""bittersweet"" ending theories that are fairly brutal and involve most everyone meeting a grisly death. 


There is another camp that see a more hopeful story and tend to think it will have a happier ending albeit with a price paid by the ""heroes"" and see the ""gray"" as more that even the darkest characters (Jamie, Theon, the Hound) may have light in them.

Soon we will get our answer on what GrrM thinks (or the showrunners interpretation of his view) of his story by the conclusion but I was curious what everyone thought in terms of the tone of the show? 

It started off bleak, ""heroes"" like Ned and Robb were wiped out while evil like Joffrey met an unsatisfying end at the hands of an even worse cabal. Characters we liked were betrayed, beaten, raped and tortured. Other characters like Stannis dabbled in blood magic and did somewhat evil things despite other positive qualities. I think the first impression caused by this might have painted a different picture than the finale and it might be why some of the more recent seasons seem a little fan servicey.

Now we saw Sansa deal justice (brutal but just) to Bolton and then Littlefinger. We saw Arya become a master of her own fate. We saw Jamie finally walk away from his sister. The Hound commit to doing something selfless without expressing irony. Jon survive his betrayal and rally his people to his cause, finally getting someone to believe in him. Dany fly in on her dragon and smash Cersei's army. All of these character still make ""mistakes"" and aren't suddenly infallible (morally or militarily) but I do see them as *good* and I do think in the end some will get the fate they deserve. But that is just my glass is half wight version of gray. ",4,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

But D&D will resolve at the same book endgame in S8. Whoever ends up on the throne at the end, it will be someone **unexpected** and it's someone who is passing **""Unnoticed""** and **""in the shadows""** VERY interesting. George says ""Winds of winter might come out in September 2018"" but nothing is agreed. So hopefully it comes out BEFORE Season 8 *fingerscrossed*

Interview with a Spanish journalist published recently and roughly translated: 

>[Q](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sBgnAN029RU/maxresdefault.jpg): Is Azor Ahai a real character in the saga or just a legend? Could it be a woman?

>George: Azor Ahai is a male character in a legend, which can be extrapolated to a female character if it currently existed in Westeros. The genre is neutral from the moment you decide to point to any of my characters as such. But Azor Ahai is not anyone in particular, it is part of a fantastic story within the fantasy saga itself. Any character could be attributed to a divinity, such as the Drowned God or The God of Many Faces. None of them is a real character, they are mere legends of the history of Westeros and their meaning is symbolic.

>Q: Have you made any changes to the plot due to the changes that HBO has made? How do you expect to keep the element of shock in your novels, if the series has already revealed (or will reveal) the most important part of the plot? 

>George: No, I have not made any changes because of the series. The series does not influence me when writing my novels. The series has revealed some important elements, but the procedure in which I reveal them will be different in my books and reading it will be magical.

Who gets the Throne in the end?

>Q: Will the Iron Throne end in the same conditions in both versions? If you had planned not to destroy it and seat a king or queen at the end of the story, would it be the same or the same as in the series?

>George: It would be the same or the same, without a doubt. But that does not mean there are not going to be surprises that nobody has seen or will see in the television version. What is the use of knowing the end if the path has not been enjoyed? It does not matter who reigns but how and why that character has achieved it. Some bet on Jon Snow, others on Daenerys Targaryen.

>Q: Too predictable, maybe?

>George: In my novels Jon is dead and Daenerys has not stepped on Westeros, I am afraid that you advance events that you have not read yet nor do you know how they will happen. There are many characters and points of view to unravel, but everything does not revolve around these two characters.

>Q: So, is not Jon the hero of this story? Daenerys would not deserve a reward after living in exile since childhood?

>George: I do not like labels. All my characters have suffered, each in his own way. For something I write from their points of view, so that we can all understand why they do what they do and how they feel in front of the enemy. For the Lannister, the Starks are the bad guys. It would not be fair to dismiss them as villains or their rivals as heroes.

>Q: Is Jon a hero? 

>George: You can say, but so is Jaime Lannister, Sam Tarly or Stannis Baratheon. Each of them has been a coward once, but also brave. If you ask me if Jon is the hero of this story, I answer that he is not; all are important as long as they remain alive and they will have the same opportunity to prove their worth. Regarding Daenerys, I do not think that deserving, in this saga, is synonymous to obtain. In real life, because you are a good person, you do not get everything you want.


RIP Jonsa crackship:

>Q: There are those who believe that Jon could end up with Daenerys, as in the series. Even Sansa has been proposed as a second option to be the only noble girl available, do you think a crazy idea, in both cases? In the beginning he had in mind to pair Jon with Arya, although I understand that the current story is far from this. 

>George: We must bear in mind that Jon, in my novels, is dead. The only thing I can assure you is that I never planned to marry Sansa. If I discarded the idea, I would be an illusion if I thought to change it to meet the same pattern. In the event that Jon came back to life at some point, that possibility is very remote. I would never marry Sansa. Both have been raised as brothers and neither thinks of the other in a way that goes beyond brotherly love, which does not even exist. Arya has a better relationship with Jon than this one with Sansa and they will not end up together either. To understand your possible relationship with Daenerys, you will have to continue reading.
