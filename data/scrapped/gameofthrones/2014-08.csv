I think the most likely one is the Rhaegar + Lyanna= Jon Snow Recently, sean bean, the actor portraying ned stark, said that ned was obviously not the father. Also in that scene when jon was departing for the wall, ned stark says you may not have my name but you have my blood. I always thought that it was interesting that he said blood rather than son. Also in the book, rhaegar and lyanna did love each other and presumably had sex. I think they may even have married in secret. Right before she died, she says to bed promise me ned. Perhaps promise to keep jons real identity a secret because robert would kill any and every targaryen. Also she died well after the war, probably from giving birth to jon snow. Lastly, ned is far too honorable to have actually fathered jon.

However, jon was burned by the fire when he tried to kill the white walker, and targaryens dont get burned.

In the part when bran has a vision from touching the tree, he sees dragons flying over kings landing and snow on the iron throne. I think this is forshadowing jon's targaryen identity ( see my jobs mother post). Maybe jon and dany will rule together despite his vows. Maybe he will marry dany and have kids born from incest like tradition. I highly doubt this though because jon is extremely loyal and honorable, but GoT is full of surprises so you never know.

Aimee hands the award to Dan. She looks sad as she steps away
David grabs the mic Wow guys! Oh man, I gotta be honest, this does not come as a surprise, season four finale was definitely our strongest hour yet!
Dan: And it only gets better from here on out! Without giving anything away, we have a lot of surprises coming up  some that might even surprise the bookfags!

Alex Graves leans over to Nikolaj Coster-Waldau I don't understand, it was the shittiest episode of the series, let alone the season. How did they win?
Nikolaj slowly looks at him
Glances down at his arm
Graves follows his gaze. He pulls back Nikolaj's sleeve. Nikolaj is wearing golden plate armour.
Graves slaps him, Nikolaj runs away DUNGEONS!! RUN!!
David looks at him, confused
Behind Oona, a shadow stalks out of the aisle
It's Coldhands. He stabs her repeatedly in the stomach
Before Dungeons can react, an arrow hits him in the chest, he collapses

Every cut character rises from the audience and starts to murder the cast of GoT
Strong Belwas slits Emilia's throat
Liam fights off Euron, Victarion and Aeron while they try to seize him
It's a bloodbath
George RR Martin raises a hand, everyone stops.
Dan has an arrow through his throat. David crawls over to him
George laughs Oh...the Fyre rises. Except you're going to cut Aegon, aren't you? David cradles Dan as he dies. Are you going to tell him Maester Aemon is coming? That was Jon's line, you piece of shit. He says it to Ygritte you fanfiction fucking shits
ENOUGH Alex Graves stumbles out of the audience ENOUGH, GURM. LET HIM GO
And why would I do that?
He pulls out a floppy disk This contains The Winds of Winter. Everything you've written over the past three years. If you don't let him go, I'll destroy it. I'll destroy the whole draft.
Martin pauses.
It's only 168 pages. I'll write another.
David stands, turns to Graves. Consensual...
Before he can finish, Nikolaj steps in front of David
Jaime Lannister sends his regards.
He stabs David, David falls down dead
Graves howls and smashes the floppy disk
All the life drains out of him as he imagines all the characters Jaime was going to rape in Dorne
Lady Stoneheart slips up behind him and slits his throat

My current game, I loaded up Robert's Rebellion as Tywin, and was immediately asked to marry Cersei to Hoster Tully, which I did. Shortly after, the Rebellion started to fail, so I sided up with Aerys and stormed to Riverrun before Hoster could kill Cersei. I took over Riverrun and captured Hoster, who died shortly after in my dungeons, despite offering him house arrest instead of a cell. Not long after that, Aerys was captured, so the war was technically ended, but then Robert asked me to help him depose King Rhaegar, and with a high warscore, I pulled the trigger and swiftly moved to besiege King's Landing. When it fell, I didn't capture Rhaegar, but I did capture Rhaenys, Viserys and Rhaella. Not long after, Rhaegar was captured and the war ended, with King Robert Baratheon and Queen Lyanna Stark ruling the Seven Kingdoms with Lord Paramount of the Westerlands Tywin Lannister serving as Hand of the King. 

Alas, that is not where it ends. I got a notification that Queen Lyanna was ""coming on to me"", so I went to her chambers and, lo and behold, Queen Lyanna Stark was with child, and it was mine. Whoops. Shortly after, I conceived a child with my wife, and then Jamie Lannister, released from the Kingsguard, conceived a child with Margery Tyrell. Oh, I got Queen Lyanna with child again.

Other notworthy things:

* Viserys is still rotting in my prison. I've yet to decide to exile him or give him a trial. I released Rhaella, and plan to wed Rhaenys to Tyrion when I get a chance. 

* Rhaegar was sent to the Wall, and Aerys is ruling from one of the Iron Islands. 

* Cersei, the widow of Lord Hoster Tully, is betrothed to Lord Paramount of the Stormlands Renly Baratheon. 

* Robb Stark is the Lord Paramount of the Riverlands at the age of 6. Eddard Stark has no more children at this point. 

* Walder Frey died 3 days into the game. ",13,17,False,self,,,,,

Last night was just a regular saturday night behind the bar, but who should come in but Hot Pie and his dad!

Ben had a lemonade and we had a quick chat, I said how much I enjoyed the series and asked him if he would be in the upcoming season. He said that he isn't, and hasn't filmed any scenes :( But he said he had a complete ball filming with the GoT team, and he would love to go back if he could and hasn't ruled out more Hot Pie scenes if they need him. I then had to go back to work, and didn't get a chance for a photo or anything, but thought I would share this little titbit of info about one of our favourite characters.

|Discuss your reactions to the episodes with perspective from the whole show. Talk about details you missed the when you first watched the show. Point out foreshadowing details that you noticed. Discuss an actor who is totally nailing their part (or not). In general, what did you think about the episodes and where the story is going? Book vs. Show comparisons are welcome, but you need to use spoiler tags for any book differences that do not appear in the show.|

* **This thread is scoped for SEASON 4 SPOILERS** - Turn away now if you have not seen all of the episodes! Open discussion of all aired TV events up to and including episode 4.10 is ok without tags.

* **[Book spoilers still need tags!](#b)** - If it's not in the show, [tag it](/r/gameofthrones/wiki/spoiler_guide).  Events from episodes *after* this one need tags.

* **Please read the [posting policy](/r/gameofthrones/wiki/posting_policy) before posting.**

* **[Use green theory tags for speculation](#g)** - Mild/vague speculation is ok without tags, but use a warning tag on any detailed theories on events that may be revealed in the remaining books or in the show.

* **Posting policy reminder:** Don't post or ask for non-pay sources.

Cersei has just revealed she has Tyrion's whore.

&gt; Instead, he looked at the girl's face and said, ""You swear you'll release her after the battle?""

&gt;""If you release Tommen, yes"".
 
&gt; He pushed himself to his feet. ""Keep her then, but keep her safe. If these animals think they can use her... well, sweet sister, let me point out that a scale tips two ways."" His tone was calm, flat, uncaring; he'd reached for his father's voice, and found it. ""Whatever happens to her happens to Tommen as well, and that includes the beatings and rapes"". *If she thinks me such a monster, I'll play the part for her*.

&gt; Cersei had not expected that. ""You would not dare"".

&gt;Tryion made himself smile, slow and cold. Green and black, his eyes laughed at her. ""Dare? I'll do it myself"".

&gt;His sister's hand flashed at his face, but he caught her wrist and bent it back until she cried out. Osfryd moved to her rescue. ""One more step and I'll break her arm,"" the dwarf warned him. The man stopped. ""You remember when I said you'd never hit me again, Cersei?"" He shoved her to the floor and turned back to the Kettleblacks.

Then season 4 comes along and we see a lot more of Tommen, who was raised by the same two people, yet he seems like a normal person. He's just not nearly as fucked up as Joffrey. In fact, he doesn't seem fucked up at all. 


So what's the deal here? Do the books reveal something more about Joffrey, like a mental illness? If not, what are your guys theories as to why he's just such a fucked up person?

This has me wondering how exactly they go about taking a castle. Their strength without doubt is on the sea. I was thinking they must have to leave their strips and try to storm a castle on land like anyone else would, but this quote really threw me off. After Sam says that Hightower should have plenty of money to hire enough swords, the captain of Huntress says, ""... swords are no good against the ironmen, unless the men who wield them know how to walk on water."" This left me really confused. How would having men at the castle not help in defending it? Surely they can't take it from the sea. That doesn't make any sense. They would have to go to ashore eventually, and anyone would be crazy to try to meet them on water.

Perhaps later in the story it will get more into it, but it's really left me stumped because I can't come up with anything reasonable.",20,24,False,self,,,,,

Why is The Hound more morally righteous than his brother, The Mountain? Sure, The Hound has his dark moments, like in Season 4 of the show, when he [show spoiler] (#s ""beats and robs that farmer who offered him and Arya food and honest pay for honest work""), yet overall, the show seems to indicate that he has a conscience, and doesn't really want to hurt anybody unless he has to or is put into a 'them or us' position. The Mountain, on the other hand, is portrayed as a brutal savage with no qualms about murdering the f#*k out of anybody who even looks at him sideways. I know that their family has a long history of serving the Lannisters and that the Clegane kids are all more or less bred to be warriors, yet somehow The Hound seemed to grow up honorable while The Mountain grew up a monster. Why is that? Do the books offer any explanation about why two kids raised by the same people in a similar fashion would come out differently? Is The Hound that much better, or is this something the show has added (or perhaps something I've read into things since I like the Hound-Arya storyline so much = )",13,14,False,self,,,,,

If that is true, I would much rather describe it as *least legendary, yet still legendary*.

There were so many moments of awe that made me realize how *odd* my math skills are because I can't *even*.

* Cersei's narcissistic personality and paranoia makes for good entertainment. Her character sometimes made me actually irritated, which means GRRM did a good job.
* I forgot GRRM was the author for a bit and Arys Oakheart's fate reminded me of that. I was honestly taken aback because I figured, being a POV character, he had a bigger role. Still a great scene.
* I get this weird feeling that Euron is mad.
* Victarion was a badass viking.
* Revealing Arya had slashed Dareon's throat and becoming blind made me wtf.
* Vengeance. Justice. Fire and blood. This has to be the greatest quote of the book. It could have made me squeal like a little girl.
* Littlefinger's Sansa marriage plan was admirable. It made me nod my head out of respect to Littlefinger.
* Brienne and Crew's hanging was stone cold. I dropped the book and was in a state of denial. Great scene.
* Cersei being locked up remedied me of the vile taste that I had from Brienne's last scene.
* Jaime maneuvering the Riverrun politics was great, and denying Cersei was even greater. 
* I'm interested in why Tom Sevenstrings (who was last seen as part of the Brotherhood) is in Riverrun, and if he had anything to do with Brynden's escape or the Freys being ambushed
* The talk of sorcery and invading one's dreams made me curious about Jaime's earlier dream scene with the blonde woman.

From What I've been able to find most knights only wore full plate towards the 15th century, and only for a dozen years or so since gunpowder brought an end to that and during the 13th-14th centuries they mostly just wore chain, a breastplate and maybe a surcoat.

As the title says, I have not yet read the books in the series of ASOIAF, however I do own them all. I have seen all the TV episodes and I want to know what happens next. I know the books do differ slightly from the show, some changes more obvious than others and some had to be done due to the ""logistics"" of actually making the show.

So what I am asking is, should I read the first 4 books, of which I have already seen on TV? Or can I pick up from book 5 and still be fine? Or would you say that I should really read the books to fully understand the others as the differences between the books and the show is noticeable?

517,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2014-8-6,2014,8,6,7,2cqdvs,self.gameofthrones,"[All Spoilers] Speculation on ""Cut"" Characters Moving Forward:",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/2cqdvs/all_spoilers_speculation_on_cut_characters_moving/,Sniederhouse,1407278202,"As readers of the series know, A Feast For Crows and A Dance With Dragons see a shift of narrative in the most recent two entries into A Song of Ice and Fire. Not only do we venture further south to Dorne than we have in any of the previous books, but characters in regions that we are familiar with are introduced as well. 

It seems to me, due to the casting that has been announced, the Greyjoy uncles and Asha (Yara) have story lines that may not make it into the show. Stoneheart appearing to have been cut has been accepted by myself, but cutting the Greyjoys seems... Well, foolish. 

Here are a few reasons why they may have not been cut and just postponed:

1) Clearly the show is operating on a much different timeline. It is entirely possible they chose to introduce Dorne this season and include [spoiler](#s ""Balon Greyjoy's death"") with the hint that the Uncles will be introduced into season 6. This would keep the show interesting for longer in introducing characters not all at once but at a slower pace. They would probably have to introduce Connington and ""Aegon"" along with the Greyjoys since the Dornish are such a large group.

2) Can the show even operate the same narrative without the Greyjoys? They seem to be fairly important. At least Euron, who many have speculated to [spoiler](#s ""actually be Darrio""), is of importance as he could cause a lot of havoc. Victarion could be cut but I really enjoy the Greyjoys. I thought the Kingsmoot was so interesting. The novels are so rich with culture I would love to see even more changes in scenery for the show. 

Now, the show could cut the Greyjoys completely but it seems unsatisfying to just leave Balon and Yara with nothing to do in the show or just invent a story for them. Reasons to cut:

1) The Dornish are probably bigger players than the Greyjoys. The Greyjoys may just be there as filler to throw us readers off the scent of the true course of the novel. They could be there to add depth and emotion to the Dany arc as we know that Euron wants her dragons. 
2) There really is a lot of characters and casual TV show viewers (who I sort of can't stand, sorry) don't even know the names of many characters, thus can't be given even more to process lest they quit on the show. Perhaps the Kingsmoot can indeed be cut but introduce Daario as a threat if he indeed is Euron. He doesn't have to be Euron in the show but if he betrays her in the book, he could still betray her in the show, just under different circumstances. 

What say you, redditors?  I would love as many opinions on this as possible. WinterIsComing.Net is full of so  many biased folks who either hate the show's direction or praise it and there are very few people who speculate without getting hostile. ",19,6,False,self,,,,,

If Jon is truly Rhaegar and Lyanna's child, then he would have a mix between wolf's blood and dragons blood. Ned mentioned in AGOT that Lyanna had the wolf's blood in her, stronger than he did, and Rhaegar was known for having white hair and the red of his house. Could Ghost be spiritual guardian of his combined parents watching over him? 
The way I see this is that Rhaegar only has the one heir left, Jon, being that the myth is true. He was in love with Lyanna and I'm assuming knew of her pregnancy and was happy about it. Because Lyanna fiercely would have loved her child as any wolf mother would have, this could mean Ghost would be an incarnation of those two to protect Jon beyond the walls of Winterfell.

If Tommen and Joffrey are gone then Stannis would be the undisputed next in line.  No one could really deny him then. Robb and Balon really didn't oppose Stannis so much.

I'm not sure if the next thing i'm about to say is just a scenario a lot of people imagined or a scenario I created, so anyways without further delay I present: The Masterplan by Petyr Baelish.

It all starts when he became master of coin. He became more power hungry and wanted an even better position, probably (Hand of the) King.
He made a plan to let the whole continent plunge in to chaos. We all know that he loves chaos because he profits the most from it (and because of his speach 'Chaos is a ladder'). He does this by first by killing Jon Arryn. We know what this all has done but after that he'll need more chaos. Having Sansa, he might get the North to rebel the Boltons' rule and take it for his own. If he does this then he'll already have 2 major regions under his control. (The Vale and the North)

The North (and Petyr) remember that Cat was killed in the Riverlands by the Freys. Commoners don't like the Frey's and again could rebel against them alongside the northeners to avenge Cat. 3 regions done.(The Vale, North and Riverlands.)

The Greyjoys are still in open rebelion but are known to weaken after long periods of fighting. They like to attack quick and fierce but are seemingly failing as years now have passed and they don't seem to make a great influence in the invaded lands, so this danger will eventually stop and Petyr will make use of their weakened numbers. They are either conquered or allied with Petyr. 

Time has passed and Daenerys's army might attack Kings Landing.
Cersei will probably have every army she can get defending Kings Landing.
Meaning Casterly Rock and Highgarden are ripe for taking.
Petyr does this with all the armies combined and gets Cersei cornered.
Dany winst the throne and Petyr waits for the right moment to strike and somehow takes the city or he gets himself in to the position of Hand of The Queen. He betrays her and takes the throne for himself. The Seven Kingdoms are now all owned by Petyr.
With the only real threaths being...

There is still one person who could have stopped this. Stannis. He is the only problem with this idea as he could have taken the North and just go after Petyr and Cersei and eventually fighting Dany.

Or the White Walkers just come and destroy it all.

Thank you for reading this idea i had in mind.

I have had this theory since season 1 but didn't investigate for fear of spoilers. I think I may be on the money so if you would rather not know... don't scroll down



Curious? Good.

Who is Roberts True heir? Stannis? Nope.

Roberts true heir is his son.

""Treason"" I hear you cry ""Robert had no true born sons, only bastards and monsters born of Cersei's incest"".

Except

Robert did have a trueborn son conceived on his wedding night to Cersei Lannister.

The babe prince supposedly died in infancy but suppose he didn't...

The baby was the image of Robert and Cersei had come to despise Robert since their wedding night. However, she is a loving and protective mother. She can not love the child truly but can not kill it either even though she wants to sit a son of her own with Jamie on the throne. So... how to deal with this problem?

Fake his death... possibly with one of Roberts other bastards. Send him to live with some tavern wench and visit on occasion. 

Some evidence.. cersei, an otherwise callous woman, is visibly upset when confronted by Tyrion about the mass slaughter of Roberts baseborn children. Maybe at the idea of her own child being killed.

So..where is the hidden heir..dead in kings landing? Nope. He is alive and well..hopefully.

Who is he?

 All Hail king Gendry Baratheon.

Yep...Gendry.

Evidence.

When Ned Stark asks about his mother, we learn she died when he was little, she sang to him and.... wait for it.... she had yellow hair.

Tenuous? Maybe... but very possible.

So..what sayeth the realm. Does R+C=G?

I say all hail the black bull...long may he reign.


Notes. 

I have finished storm of swords. I'm watching the series first before I read the books. I know Gendry's story overlaps with edric Storm but thus far it hasn't affected the theory.

Once again this is a theory thread. If you know what happens, be the theory true or false...Please don't spoil.",25,0,False,self,,,,,

I read a dozen theory posts that really fascinated me, but all of them were a few years old and I didnt find answers so much as I had more questions.  

If it is Jaquin, what is the theory behind them wanting the Key and why take Pate's spot at the Mage's side?

so a few weeks back during the San Diego Comic Con, I was thinking about asoiaf/got, and I was thinking: ""what would happen if Westeros had a mirror universe?"" So, after getting into the idea some more I decided to create /r/Alteros to answer and discuss those questions. 

Allteros and Westeros are essentially the same. Social and economic status are pretty similar in both universes, with some variation. Of course, it is very possible that some characters would have lost or gained some, or all of their wealth due to the consequences of this alternate universe. 

The main difference, however, is that the character traits found in the Westeros tend to be the opposite in Alteros--something akin to the Trek mirror universe. 

With that said, feel free to ask any questions you have about the sub, or visit /r/Alteros to explore this new world. ",14,6,False,self,,,,,

When I read the description of the wall I assumed it was a fantastical idea and let the whole issue of realism go.  But then I began to think about it.

The wall is said to be 700 feet (~213m) high.  At the top, it is described as wide enough for 10 mounted knights to ride abreast.  Let's call that 45 ft or 15m.  I haven't seen a quantitative description of the base width of the wall so I'm estimating based on the depiction in the TV show that's it roughly 100m.

By those numbers, a 1 meter long section of the wall would encompass a volume of (213m * 100m * 1m) - (0.5*(100m - 15m) * 213m * 1m) = 12268m^3.  The first term is the volume of the wall if it were 100 m wide the whole way up, the second term is the ice that isn't there because the wall gets narrower as you go up.  

Assuming that the ice masses roughly 917 kg/m^3, the mass of ice would be 1.1 x10^7 kg weighing roughly 1.1 x10^8 Newtons.

Assuming that the weight is distributed evenly over the base area (which is a pretty big assumption, but close enough for this) then the pressure at the base would be about 1.1 megapascal or 12 tons per square foot.  That is a fairly heavy duty footing, but within the realm of possibility, even for medieval engineering standards.

But would the ice bear the stress of the wall above it?  I found some work by Prof. EM Scholson at Dartmouth about the structural properties of ice and learned a few things I didnt know.  Most importantly, at the probable local conditions (sub-freezing but not wildly so) the failure stress of ice is approximately 9 megapascals.  Given our previous 1.1 MPa stress at the base, the wall is actually pretty heavily overbuilt against internal stress.

Im a geotech, so I obviously think of the footing first.  There are some other considerations that could destroy the whole thing such as shrink/swell cracking, differential settlement, wind loads, and Im sure other things I havent thought of.  Any other thoughts?

TL;DR The wall seems like it could actually be a reasonable engineering feat, even with medieval technology.

I don't see it. Maybe its because I'm a hetero male, but between the two, Robert B. seems like he'd be the better choice. So, I thought I'd break down the pros and cons  and people could give their opinions. Because I'm bored.

**PRO:**
*Rhaegar-* He's a Prince and every girl seems to dream of being a Princess at some point. Disney has made a mint off this fact. He's good looking and can play an instrument. Good lookin' enough that he'd be a player even without a title. Also, Scientists have done studies showing women find guys who can play instruments more appealing. 

He's educated, rich and.... really rich. Has castles, boats and will be King one day. All his buddies say he is a great guy once you get to know him.

*Robert-* Also nobility but not a Prince. 6'6 and a good lookin', strapping fellow before he got tubby. Science has also shown most women prefer taller guys. He's also a manly man who likes a beer, hunts and is athletic. Which you'd think would appeal to a girl from the North who is used to being around similar types. As much as we think opposites attract, most of the time we go towards the familiar. Parents died when he was a kid so no in-laws to worry about. And, for the same reason, he'd be much more likely to acquiesce to the wife because she fills a void left by the lack of a family. 

Is the best soldier in Westeros and chicks dig a guy in uniform. His best friend is her brother so she knows he will help keep him in line. Also, Robert would know any misbehavior would piss off his best friend/brother and not just the wife. Helps avenge the murder of your father and brother.

**CONS:**
*Rhaegar:* Comes from a family with a strong history of mental illness. Oh, btw, is already married with children. People say ""Eh, he's a Targareyen and rules don't apply to rich nobility"". Well, if you don't like cheaters, you aren't going to like a dude who ditches the first wife and his two young kids. His father is crazier than a shithouse rat. He read a book of prophecies as a kid and decided they applied to him. So there is a super healthy narcissism.  

Doesn't seem to think of the ramifications of his actions on those around him. Which is another aspect of a narcissistic personality. Doesn't seem to pick up on his best friend being gay so he's kind of oblivious to even those close to him. Again, is already married and polygamy is frowned upon in their society. His dad murdered your brother and father and wanted to murder your younger brother. And he was AWOL when that went down. Which is no excuse.

*Robert:* Is a meathead. A nice guy, yes, but he won't be playing an music or reading books. May be a cheater type but you never know because lots of guys seem like that and get it out of their system before they are married. But, still, he knocked up a bar girl. Is a meathead and that may not appeal to someone who has meatheads in her family.(Brandon) 

Isn't a Prince. Ended up becoming a tubby drunk but that might be because he was living an awful life with a shrew wife that was banging her brother behind his back. Is pretty friggin' oblivious to the aforementioned fact that his wife was a tramp. Has anger issues and abandonment issues. Did,in fact, become King even though he didn't want the job. And, like many things he had no interest in, he put forth no effort in the field. 

**Conclusion:** Both seem to me like a pretty shitty choice. But, in the end, If my sister had to choose one, I'd hope she'd choose Robert. His faults seem much more manageable then a potentially crazy, narcissistic polygamist. Plus, as her brother, I wouldn't have to fear death if she hooked up with him. ",37,14,False,self,,,,,

And it struck me that a lot of you guys describe Cercei's storyline as her ""descent into madness"".

Why is that? I mean I cannot disagree more on this! Cercei hasn't changed a bit from when we first met her. She is shortsighted, emotional and overconfident. She thinks of herself as a true heir of Tywin's, while getting played by all the true players in the game of thrones.

You could argue she always was insane, although I would rather call her sane, but evil (and stupid). But I wholeheartedly disagree with the idea of her descending (during AFFC storyline) into any mental state other than what we came to know her in from the very beginning.

Do you a different opinions and interpretations of her character and the AFFC story of Cercei?

the way sansa has been portrayed in season 4 plus the ""you will fly"" comment seems to suggest that they have a lot bigger role than what has been published so far.

on the other hand arya/daenerys/cersei/tyrion have a season's material at least in the books that can be portrayed in season 5

So far in the show, She gives a warning to Daenerys to be cautious with trusting people as they want her dragons. I have a hard time trying to figure out what her purpose and intentions are. 

What do you guys think her intentions are? Good or bad? 
Who do you think her true identity is? If anyone important. 
What do you think is the meaning behind some of her 'warnings'?


Here are some links to more detail on her character:

Within the Stark family: 

Ned never had a scene where he talked directly with Robb.

Jon Snow never had a scene with Sansa.

Catelyn never had a scene with Arya.

Rickon barely had a scene with anyone but Robb and Bran.

Nearly finishing A Clash of Kings ans was wondering if someone could clear something up for me. I was reading over [Ser Dontos'](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dontos_Hollard) page on A Wiki of Ice and Fire and I think I might have missed something, regarding this:

&gt; **After secretly being contacted by Petyr Baelish**, Dontos leaves Sansa a note and promises to help her escape.

Was that mentioned in A Clash of Kings, I can't seem to recall Baelish contacting Ser Dontos. I've probably missed it but honestly can't remember!

Also under **A Storm of Swords** on that same page it says this:

&gt; Several meetings in the godswood later, Sansa tells Ser Dontos of the plot to marry her to Willas Tyrell. Dontos tells Sansa that she will be freed the night of Joffrey's wedding and **gives her a hairnet laced with amethysts**.

Doesn't that happen in A Clash of Kings, pretty sure Ser Dontos gives Sansa a necklace in her last chapter.

Upon seeing the spelling of 'valar morghulis,' I couldn't help but notice that both words can be (or were) derived from Sindarin words from Tolkien's books. 'Valar' in Sindarin is basically what the elves use to refer to their gods. The second word 'morghulis' is strikingly similar to the Sindarin word 'morgul' meaning 'black sorcery.' 'Morgul' is made up of 'mor,' meaning dark or black, and 'gul,' meaning magic or sorcery.

So back to GoT land. 'Valar morghulis' means 'All men must die' in High Valyrian. Now look at this phrase with the context of Sindarin, or High Elven. 'Valar' - refering to god(s), 'mor' - dark/black, 'guhl' (pronounced 'gul') - magic/sorcery.

(Note: 'is' at the end is probably a suffix indicating action, i.e. the action of having to die).

So, is it possible that 'valar morghulis' is refering to 'the god(s) of dark sorcery'? If so could that god(s) be Arya's infamous God of Death?

Not only do I think it is possible, I think it is entirely likely. This here quote from GRRM himself seals the deal for me:

""Tolkien was a philologist, and an Oxford don, and could spend decades laboriously inventing Elvish in all its detail. I, alas, am only a hardworking SF and fantasy novel, and I don't have his gift for languages. That is to say, I have not actually created a Valyrian language.""

So there you go, I thought this was an interesting observation that maybe you can tell your friends and make yourself look like a bigger nerd than usual :P Thoughts?",9,8,False,self,,,,,

They most often play the chorus, which sounds like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgHn4CkuTo0&amp;t=1m3s), except a bit slower and on several instruments. 

You can very clearly hear it in the background of the Purple Wedding [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNS3NKOKHP4&amp;t=4m2s)

Does anyone know where I could find such a song without the Game of Thrones dialogue on top of it? 

If the producers of the show haven't released this part of the soundtrack, perhaps some of you talented musicians can recreate it on your own! :)

Thanks for reading!

In fact, this is my first reluctant post. I have stay far away from this corner of the web because the formatting is something awful but I digress. My limited knowledge of this format with all of the brackets is confusing. If a moderator could please let me know if I screw this up then that would be wonderful. I figured this website would be the easiest way to reach a large scope of fans to bounce this idea of off.

I went away this past weekend. On the way home I was discussing Jon Snow's parents with my brother who I believe frequents this site. Together we came to a very likely conclusion on who Jon Snow's parents are. I read the wiki on the theories (http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jon_Snow/Theories) and while I have the same thoughts on his mother, I do not see a theory on his father. Sean Bean recently did an AMA essentially confirmed Maury style that he is indeed not the father. Let's start with his mother: Lyanna Stark. Ned made a promise to her on her deathbed that has never been explained as far as the show is confirmed. I have not read the books. If you can gather anything from the first season of GOT it is that Ned, despite all consequences, was a man of honor. This leaves me to believe he in fact did not bed a whore due to his vows to Catelyn. He took the young Jon Snow back to winterfell under the guise that he was unfaithful to Cat and was doing the right thing for the child. This quote from Cat says a lot: ""Whoever Jon's mother had been, Ned must have loved her fiercely, for nothing Catelyn said would persuade him to send the boy away."" The first season shows you the love he had for his sister and what a better way to honor her than to care for her son.

The theory that Rhaegar Targaryen is the father of Jon Snow is pretty good except for one thing. The show has stressed, and I mean STRESSED that one of the important traits of lineage is hair color. Remember when Ned reads the Baratheon lineage in that bid ol' book and realizes that Joffrey has blonde hair? I do. He paid for that discovery with his life and it took quite a while for the incestuous claims to surface. The Targaryens have blond hair. All of them. Daeneryus, her brother Viserys, and of course, Rhaegar. If hair color is as important as the show declares then Jon Snows voluptuous locks didn't come from Targaryen genes. Who else has similar hair to Jon snow and loved Lyanna? Oh yeah, Robert Baratheon. I have to rewatch the first season but my brother pointed out that Jon Snow wasn't allowed to eat dinner with the Starks when Robert visited Winterfell. I don't know what significance it would be that his father is Robert so thhat is where you guys come in. You probably know more than me.

2. Unsullied: Also in the first Daenerys chapter, when they are on their way to the palace to meet Khal Drogo, an unsullied stops them before they enter.

But I suspect that something sweeter was used in the negotiations. Remember that Littlefinger was sent, yes? Who did he conspire with to kill Joffrey? OLENNA TYRELL. Littlefinger went to Highgarden (or wherever), meets with Olenna, makes the offer of marriage with the promise of his death. It makes sense because one moment the Tyrells are HATING the Lannisters and the next they're all buddy-buddy. Something had to have changed to convince them to act nice, and that was Joffrey's death.

Or because he just wanted to avoid a battle. Whatever the reason, it is made very clear that Renly has more men at his back than does The Kinslayer. Hell, Renly even had supporters in the North before they crowned Robb. 

Am I correct in assuming that proper succession is a concept understood by most in Westeros? Obviously Renly has no rightful claim to the throne, yet here he is with more supporters than his brother.

So I see one of three things being at play here:

* Stannis was seen as a horrible leader and unfit to rule. I would assume that you can make exceptions for the line of succession if next in line is terribly unfit, e.g., a mental retard.

* Renly was incredibly charismatic and persuasive. 

* The people didn't really care about the line of succession, they just served their own interests. Rendering the line of succession pretty much useless.

Am I even close here? I would assume there is more detail in the books.

Knowing what was going to happen, I made sure to keep my eye out for any clues and what I found seems to contradict what the popular belief is. Most believe Olenna dropped the poison in Joffrey's cup, as its clear she took the jewel off of Sansa's necklace. However, for the entirety of the wedding, the cup was nowhere near her (I promise, watch it again. When Margaery is given the cup she sets it down on her table, not Olenna's like what is commonly believed). 

So how did the poison get from Olenna to the cup? There were only four people the entire wedding who had any contact with Joffery's cup and could have poisoned him: Joffrey (obviously wasn't him), Tyrion (wasn't him), Sansa (wasn't her), and Margaery. Pretty obvious who must've poisoned the cup, right? Given the many shots of Margaery's frustrated facial expressions when Joffrey spit out his wine, raised his cup as if he was going to drink but didn't, etc, throughout the wedding, it's made pretty clear that she held a part in the plot. 

But now here's where my theory begins to differ from others. How did Olenna get the poison to Margaery? It's possible Olenna did just hand it off to her, but at no point in the episode is there any evidence that the two had any contact with eachother after Olenna pulled the jewel from Sansa's necklace, which caused me to believe there must have been a middle-man. I propose that this middle-man was not a man, but actually a woman: Brienne of Tarth. 

At one point, after Olenna had procured the poison, Brienne, with her hands behind her back, approaches the king and queen's table. Margaery then reaches her hand out to take Brienne's, and that is when Brienne gives her the jewel. But why would Brienne want to be a part of this plot? To avenge the woman she admired and served who was killed by the Lannisters: Catelyn Stark. So she agreed to help in murdering Joffrey by taking the poison from Olenna and stealthily passing it off the Margaery, who then poisoned the cup.

Anyways, that's my two cents. Let me know what you think.",7,0,False,self,,,,,

R. Martin loves throwing bits of subtle foreshadowing into the dialogue (""People die on their chamber pots""/""Shouldn't you wear a helmet?""/etc), casually  and quickly so people barely notice that it could be important. After becoming familiar with this theme of his from rewatching the series, one line in particular has piqued my interest especially because it has been stated not once, but twice so far in the show. 

Shortly after Bran wakes up from his coma in season 1, Old Nan is telling him stories of long winters, white walkers, and things of the like, when Robb comes in, shoos her out, and mocks the ridiculousness of her stories by saying ""One time she told me that the sky is blue because we live in the eye of a blue-eyed giant named Macumba"" (to which Bran responded, ""Maybe we do""). When I first heard this I humored the thought. Sure it's quite outlandish, but if it were true? It could potentially explain why winters last so long (that's when the giant closes his eyes to sleep, or something like that), as well as the nature of the blue eyed white walkers. 

I considered the idea as a fun thought, but didn't consider it seriously... that is until the same line was mentioned again. In season 4, when Tywin confronts Oberyn in the brothel, Oberyn proposes the same idea: ""Some people believe the sky is blue because we live in the eye of a blue-eyed giant"". Why would GRRM feel the need to casually reference this belief not once, but twice in the story (so far) unless it was important? It could be a stretch, but knowing the author's love for subtle foreshadowing and how he goes about it, don't you think it could be possible he's hinting a major clue at us? Anyways, I've begun to stick with this theory, let me know what you all think.

**Edit:** If this were true, then the intro to the show could also be a subtle foreshadow in itself, showing the world to be a concave land, which would make sense if it was in an eyeball.",11,14,False,self,,,,,

But if you had to choose one character that was the 'main character' for a season, who would you choose?

Season 1 is obvious: Ned Stark.
Season 2 is far more subjective but I would say that Tyrion Lannister was the most pivotal character to that season.
I can't think of one for season 3 at all and for season 4 I can think of several who may fit the bill; Jon, Tyrion again and maybe even Cercei.

What do you guys think? This is in relation to the show only.

I recently just started both of them this January (i'm on season 3 of the show, and I'm reading A Dance with Dragons now). One thing I've liked about Game of Thrones is that it deals with death WAY differently than other popular shows today. When a character dies, they're dead. No hope for fan favorites like Eddard or Robb. It completely puts me on edge for my favorite characters for the future! But with the teases at Berric Dondarion in the early parts of season 3, as well as the HUGE Lady Stoneheart reveal at the end of ASOS, it seems that not even Game of Thrones can kill people off for good anymore. Pretty soon we'll have the Mountain coming back from the dead, the possibility of wargs and what happens when they die, and who knows what else by the end of the series.

http://winteriscoming.net/2014/05/23/characters-confirmed-game-thrones-season-5-new-details/

Will [AFFC](#g Maggy The Frog's prophecy to Cersei) be shown as a flashback? It says she will only appear in one episode next season. Only one episode implies to me one scene, rather than introducing a new character. The writers have shown that they want to avoid flashback scenes and dreams as much as possible. The one exception so far has been Bran and Jojen's green dreams. Even these are still shown in real time, with us seeing them along the the boys. Will they change that policy, or re-write Cersei's plotline to make her suddenly paranoid and grasping when she gets this unexpected revelation.",8,7,False,self,,,,,

In the book Tyrion's trial by combat is asked for after Oberyn already says he will be his champion.  In the show, that comes after Tyrions has already asked for his trial by combat.  I loved the way the show handled Tyrion asking and not knowing that he had someone to be his champion.  I think it added extra drama with Tyrion not knowing if he was going to fight the mountain or not.

And that led directly to my favorite scene:

I had one question regarding Varys' and why he helped Tyrion? What was his motive behind it? Is this explained in the books? It sure doesn't seem like Varys would be one to care about others unless there's something of interest for him.

A lot of the show is based on excitement from not knowing what is going to happen, while IMO the books are more about deeper things like character development/characteristics of the society, and they much less heavily rely on suspense. I watched Season 1 before reading AGOT, and I read ACOC, ASOS, AFFC, and ADWD before watching the show, and I while I obviously enjoyed the books/show more when I didn't know what was going on, I felt that with the books my enjoyment didn't vary nearly as much as the show when I knew the plot.  

All this to say that if the show finishes before the release of ADOS, I really won't mind.

Please excuse me if this has been pointed out before or if the books answers on the matter at a later point but I just wanted to share my view on Littlefinger and his acting.

We know that Littlefinger is responsible for the death of Jon Arryn (Hand of the King)
If we assume that this was done to make Robert ask Ned to become his Hand, he knows that Ned has to accept.
So Ned goes to King's Landing where his influence can affect him.
We also know that Littlefinger betrayed Ned when Ned tried to take power.
We also know that Varys looks Littlefinger when Ned is surprisingly beheaded, revealing his assistance in Joffrey's command.
As a result of this the Northerns, especially Robb will try to avenge his death by declaring war against the Lannisters, all predictable.
He also knows that the Lannisters will need help against Stannis, (Renly, his death wasn't forseeable) and the Starks.
This is where the Tyrells come into play, Littlefinger volunteers to go to the Tyrells upon Tyrion's request to arrange a marriage.
We also know that Olenne and Littlefinger took part in the murder of Joffrey.
So all the things he has done was to strengthen the power of House Tyrell

To conclude it appears that Littlefinger is working for the Tyrells but pretends to be working for the Lannisters and gives them just so much that they trust him.

Let me know what you think.

The Icelandic goats, a rare and ancient breed dating back from the Vikings, played the pivotal role of Drogon's afternoon snack. They are now at risk of being slaughtered when their farm goes up for auction in September. This would cut their total population by half (there are currently around 800 total). 

Haafell is the farm these goats call home. It is the only commercial goat farm in Iceland, and is run by Johanna Thorvaldsdttir. In 2008, she single handedly saved the Icelandic Goat population from going extinct, when she left her nursing career to start Haafell. 

We've currently raised $30,000 and are about 1/3 to our goal. With this money, Johanna will avoid foreclosure and continue her mission of creating a sustainable and successful farming operation. 

We are offering incentives such as limited edition tote bags and mugs with a GOT-like sigil of the goats, as well as farm tours, soaps, and chocolate. 

Below is the link to our indiegogo campaign where you can find pictures of the goats, incentive gifts, and more of the story:

I wrote down some random questions I have during reading, and I'm going to post them here, some of them might sound stupid but that's what the thread is called :D 

**1)** *What is the deal between Sansa &amp; The Hound?*

- Now since I finished Season 4, I know that the Hound dies and nothing really happens with him and Sansa after he saves him, and I don't understand why is he constantly messing with Sansa, is this just GRRM's way of introducing the Hound as a character, or is there more to their relationship in the parts I haven't read yet? **(Please use spoiler tags for this one if it's in the parts I haven't read yet)**

**2)** *What's the wolf-headed thing the first Reek gives to Theon?*

- When they're searching for Bran &amp; Rickon and the others around the river, Reek says: ""I know they are in the farmer's place, I feel it"", and Theon feels something in Reek's bag, a wolf headed silver thing, and says ""I know where they are"". Is that the brooch/pin that Bran owns, and when he sees that in the bag, he suddenly has the whole plan of killing the farmer's children and making them look like Bran &amp; Rickon? 

**3)** *Who can legally make someone a knight?*

- This one, I'm just ignorant/unlearned about. I don't know if it's the same way they did in the old times in real life, but I don't even know how that worked either. So, what are the requirements to have the right to claim someone a knight? Why can't a villager make another villager a knight? Can only people from royal families do that? But who decides a family is ""royal""? Viserys is a Targaryen, can he claim someone a knight? It can't be only king's right since Stannis claims Davos a knight, so maybe only people from the current royal family has the right? Please enlighten me ;_;

**4)** *What's the currency in the world of ASoIaF?*

- I'm guessing I can check the wiki for this but I always get accidentaly spoilers when I'm there, so if someone could give a little summary it'd be great! I thought it was simply golden dragons, but then Theon gave Reek some ""Stark silver"" to buy him a little army.

**5)** *Why didn't Stannis attack from land?*

-  I didn't really know the map when I was watching the show, but this bothered me so much when reading the books, Stannis has so many horsemen &amp; knights left from Renly, and Blackwater Bay looks like it was created for a trap to be set! Right before the Battle of the Blackwater, Davos actually **does** think about this. He says it'd be faster to arrive to King's Landing, but it'd be hard to pass the river with all the horsemen, so it'd be inefficient.

- Well, this'd be even slower but why not just go around the Blackwater Bay and put your armies to Duskendale or somewhere west of the Dragonstone? There ain't no river there, AND I doubt anyone in the King's Landing would expect it

**6)** *How did they make that much wildfire? Is Hallyne hiding something?*

- When Hallyne and Tyrion are talking about the wildfire for the last time before the battle, Hallyne is pretty weird about the whole deal. He just says ""we just worked hard"" but that sounds pretty weird to me. And they only found a couple hundred in the Dragonpit(?). Is there something he's hiding or am I just nitpicking? **(Please use spoiler tags in this one if it's in the parts I haven't read yet)**

Sorry if some of these sound stupid, if I used the wrong terms or words for it, and for my english. Thanks!",16,15,False,self,,,,,

It was growing hard to see. Theon thrust his hand into the sack impatiently, groping amongst soft fur and rough scratchy wool. A sharp point pricked his skin, and his fingers closed around something cold and hard. He drew out a wolf's head brooch, silver and jet. Understanding came suddenly. His hand closed into a fist.

I just wanted to tell you how much this subreddit means to me in particular. First, I am a huge Game of Thrones fan. I started watching the series last fall when my girlfriend introduced me to the world of Westros via the HBO Series. I knew of Game of Thrones before that, but I thought it would never be able to compare to my favorite TV series at the time (Spartacus). Anyway, I watched the three seasons and was able to enjoy the fourth season on HBO last April. 

After the fourth season ended, I picked up the books and I'm now 200 pages into A Storm of Swords. My goal is to eventually be a Game Of Thrones master like so many other book readers are. What helps in reaching that goal, is the content that is posted on this subreddit. There's so many theories, photos and all things Game of Thrones here. It not only push me to read more and dive deeper into the Song of Ice and Fire, but keeps things fresh.
There is so much more to be read and watched. 

I can't wait to continue this journey with you. Thanks for all your posts. 

Winter is coming.",8,19,False,self,,,,,

Okay, so I'm sure most of you have seen the South Park parody of Game of Thrones, if not go watch it. I thought it was pretty decent (especially the Black Friday White Walkers :) ). The thing that really confused me was the theme song. Why was it ""wiener, wiener, wiener...""? There are barely any dicks in the show. I can remember a few, like Hodor and the wine merchant who tried to poison Daenerys but are there more in the books? I mean that's the only explanation I can think off. If there are a ton of ""weiners"" in the books, give me specifics (I'm just interested as to how they work into the story ;D ). I'm not a book reader but I am 1000% okay with spoilers.

I think I remember Walder Frey and Roose Bolton discussing Edmure's capture and the Walder's ascension to Lord of the Trident, but have the Freys actually captured it? With the Blackfish now already on the run, and Talisa dead and not in the castle, it seems very unlikely it will appear. But do we know its status?

I heard that Riverrun was mentioned a couple of times in S4 but can't remember whose hands it's in.

|Discuss your reactions to the episodes with perspective from the whole show. Talk about details you missed the when you first watched the show. Point out foreshadowing details that you noticed. Discuss an actor who is totally nailing their part (or not). In general, what did you think about the episodes and where the story is going? Book vs. Show comparisons are welcome, but you need to use spoiler tags for any book differences that do not appear in the show.|

* **This thread is scoped for SEASON 4 SPOILERS** - Turn away now if you have not seen all of the episodes! Open discussion of all aired TV events up to and including episode 4.10 is ok without tags.

* **[Book spoilers still need tags!](#b)** - If it's not in the show, [tag it](/r/gameofthrones/wiki/spoiler_guide).  Events from episodes *after* this one need tags.

* **Please read the [posting policy](/r/gameofthrones/wiki/posting_policy) before posting.**

* **[Use green theory tags for speculation](#g)** - Mild/vague speculation is ok without tags, but use a warning tag on any detailed theories on events that may be revealed in the remaining books or in the show.

The Epilogue...,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/2dv0ia/adwd_finished_the_book_the_epilogue/,DrownedFire,1408339111,"Holy shit! It gave me shivers. I've always thought Varys was the sympathetic version of Littlefinger because he serves the ""realm"" but that scene at the end creeped me the fuck out. Even more, the little birds with their daggers. I imagined psychopathic orphan killers with dead eyes.

As for Kevan, I was starting to like him. The way he was handling politics seemed Tyrion/Tywin-esque. Honestly, I thought he had potential to become a competent player/ruler of the realm--especially now that his older brother is gone and he can be a leader instead of a follower. Overall, amazing scene.

I also like the little nod at the end with the white raven, representing that Winter has come (i.e. look out for TWOW). You just know that a great amount of chaos has been setup for the next book. 

Truly this series isn't just another hit series that has achieved mainstream status and will fade away with time. No. It is a masterpiece, with layers upon layers upon layers. It offers amazing characters, dialogue, and plots; superb and unconventional ways of tackling themes; and overall just a great story. Best of luck to GRRM on the next two books.",48,50,False,self,,,,,

1692,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2014-8-19,2014,8,19,5,2dx08p,self.gameofthrones,[All Spoilers] Just finished the books. I have some questions.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/2dx08p/all_spoilers_just_finished_the_books_i_have_some/,Kaleb1983,1408393304,"Jon Snow.  He's not dead, right?  There's too much hinting on his heritage and his important.  The red woman said he has ""daggers all around him"" and he gets stabbed by 4 daggers.  She also saw him in the flames when she was looking for Azor Ahai.  Then there's the whole thing about ""the boy dying, the man being born.""  What's the winning theory on him?  He's not dead, right?

Quinton Martell.  I'm pretty sure he's dead, but his story seems like it could have easily just been written out.  I know GRRM likes to kill protagonists, but generally there's some purpose for their existence in the story.  They do something before they die, something that influences the rest of the story.  Quinton just released the dragons.. anyone could have done that.  Am I missing something?

Dany.  The book ends with her standing by her big black dragon with a Dothraki army kinda closing in on her.  This could go a couple of ways, but the whole ""to go forward, I must go backward"" kinda seems to be relevant here.  What's the theory on what happens here?

Is Stannis truly dead?  The book ends with soooo many cliff hangers.  There has to be a hint I missed about if he's dead or not.  Manns Raider too?  He's clever and resourceful, and the only hint we have of both their deaths is the letter from Ramsey.  If Stannis was killed, Ramsey should have gotten his bride and Theon back too.

WTF is Tyrion doing?  Promising ~150,000 golden dragons to get the support of a small sell sword company?  It's better than being a slave, but he has to have a larger scale master plan that I just didn't pick up on.

Daario Naharis.  My first thought when they said the Yunkai were flinging corpses was that they're throwing the corpses of the hostages into the city.  Then it dawned on me that they're spreading the plague.  He's not a huge character, but I'm curious if people think he's alive or dead.

Ser Robert Strong.  Obviously the mountain reborn in some kinda pseudo Frankenstein experiment.  The whole epilogue bodes well for Cersei but the revelation of the mountain still being alive shows her off as a liar and bodes badly for her.  More chaos for the Targaryen invasion I guess.

Jaime?  Brianne?  WTF is going on there?  I was so confused when I read that chapter and was hoping for at least a glimpse as to what the hell the Brotherhood is up to, but none was given.  Brianne was hanged but she's alive again, she comes for Jaime.. she loves Jaime though and doesn't believe he's truly a villain.  Again, WTF?

And all the other unanswered questions of the books lol.",13,5,False,self,,,,,

I'm trying to wrap my mind around it.  Some of it is pretty apparent, like that the Tyrells control the Reach, the Greyjoys control the Iron Islands, and the Martells control Dorne.

What about the North?  I know that by right it belongs to Bran, but he is busy being Frodo.  Would that make Rickon or Sansa the Lord/Lady of the North?  Don't the Boltons kind of control the North for all intents and purposes right now?

And the Riverlands?  From what I can tell with Cat and Lysa dead, doesn't that mean the Bran, Rickon, or Sansa are in control of this as well?  Or Sweetrobin?  Is Walder Frey sort of the DeFacto ruler at the moment?

What about the Stormlands?  Stannis is clearly the rightful ruler, but surely the King has had his lands and titles revoked by now.  Who is ruling in his stead?  Tommen?

Casterly Rock:  Jaime is a King's Guard.  Tyrion is in exile.  Is Cersei or Tommen now the Lord/Lady of Casterly Rock?

Personally, I'd love to see him back.  I like the actor and I thought he made a good impression in his minor appearances in the first two seasons.

WHY WHY WHY Theon. WHY. I understand his initial motives in hoping to prove himself to his father and take his place as the prince of the Iron Islands, but then he sees how his father and sister view him. 

I really wish he would have sent that letter to Robb. It seems like one little mistake that just snowballed into a tragic fuck-up with one thing after another. Sadly it's too late when Theon realizes who his real family was.

Ugh. I'm not going to say he didn't deserve everything that came to him, because he never really made any attempt at doing the right thing. But for some reason I feel for the dude. Alas.",2,0,False,self,,,,,

So, in ADWD we eventually learn that this Young Griff character Tyrion meets up with is actually Prince Rhaegars son Aegon, who it turns out hadnt been killed by The Mountain when he was a baby. He had instead been snuck out of Westeros by Jon Connington and brought up by the group Tyrion is sent to by Illyrio and groomed to be the king in preparation for him winning back the throne. 

My question is, why werent Viserys and Daenerys ever told of his existence? The two of them (well, Viserys and Daenerys in utero) were smuggled to Dragonstone during the rebellion by Targaryen loyalists, while at the same time the infant Aegon was smuggled to Essos by Jon Connington. It appears, however, that Illyrio and Varys oversaw both groups of Targaryen survivors. Illyrio, after all, had fostered Viserys and Daenerys when they were in Pentos, while at the same time sent Tyrion to join up with the group fostering Aegon (apparently at the behest of Varys). The story seems to imply that Varys and Illyrio are working together to restore the Targaryens to the throne, so theyre definitely aware of both Aegon and Viserys/Daenerys.

However, it doesnt appear as if Viserys and Daenerys had any knowledge of Aegons continued existence. Dany, of course, is completely unaware, and Viserys is quite adamant that he is the rightful heir to the throne, since Rhaegars children are, in his mind, dead. I cant figure out why Varys and Illyrio didnt inform the two of them of their nephews existence. Maybe they didnt want to have the three of them reunited for their safety, but at the very least they could have told Viserys and Daenerys that Aegon is still alive and is the one theyre going to try and restore to the throne. I cant see any advantage in letting Viserys think that he is the one who is going to become king some day, only to eventually inform him, oh, by the way, your dead brothers son is actually still alive and, oh yeah, he has a better claim to the throne than you do. It seems to me like that plan could backfire pretty easily, especially knowing how Viserys is. In the beginning of AGOT, Viserys refers to himself as the rightful king right in front of Illyrio, and Illyrio just goes along with it despite apparently knowing that Aegon is still alive and being groomed to be king. 

There are two possible explanations that I came up with. First, Viserys HAD been told about Aegons existence when Dany was too young to remember. However, he knew that Aegon had the better claim to the throne than he did, but also wanted to be king himself. So, he lets Dany think that Aegon was killed alongside his mother and sister while secretly plotting to kill Aegon when he gets the means to do so. Illyrio goes along with this because he might as well have two people who could potentially become king of Westeros hed have an in with, and he didnt really care if it was Aegon or Viserys. 

Secondly, Varys and Illyrio never told Viserys and Dany about Aegon because they wanted to use them as a kind of decoy to protect Aegon from Robert. They knew that Robert would try to go after any surviving Targaryens, and could potentially find out about Aegons existence, even with Varys as master of whispers. If Viserys is groomed to think that he is the rightful king, and goes around Esso loudly proclaiming that he wants an army to invade Westeros, that will likely distract Roberts attention and make it less likely that he ever finds out about Aegon, until Aegon invades and retakes the throne. 

Still, those two theories dont really answer all of the questions. Does anyone else have any ideas/theories?

As I saw someone do something similar on here a while ago, I want to make a book or folder where we have the picture of the major (and some minor) characters in it with space below to write their name, prediction, and if they will or will not die- just something fun I can do to see who she recognizes (and how badly she butchers their names) and fun predictions that we can review at the end of every season. 

So I want to know- does anyone have a link to a pre-made similar booklet, or even a template I can use? I will if I have too, but I would rather not have to try to make it work in microsoft word especially if someone already made one. If not, would anyone have even some basic tips for the best way to approach it.

Thanks for any help. ",2,3,False,self,,,,,

When comparing Westeros and Essos as a show watcher, I'm confused as to why there's so much hustle and bustle about the Iron Throne and control of Westeros. Essos and the free cities seem much more prosperous and appealing to me. Sure you have the red waste, but the coast lines tout Braavos with the largest bank in the world, Qarth being the greatest city in the world, and Slaver's Bay looked to have some pretty ballin ass cities and monuments.

King's Landing is always being referred to as a shit hole (or at least it smells like one) where the people are starving, yet it holds the Iron Throne and all of the perceived power in Westeros. It's a good port town so I can see why it was established but other than that I don't see much value. The North sucks as it seems like a medieval version of the USSR. 

Highgarden and Dorne sound pretty sweet, and the Riverlands don't look too bad, but what do they produce that you'd want to control? Casterly Rock and surrounding areas have gold mines, so I can understand those areas.

It just seems like nobody in Essos really gives af about who sits on the throne, so the throne's power lies only among the Westerosi. Why is that what everybody wants, instead of Essos?",26,12,False,self,,,,,

What balance of qualities makes a successful ruler in Westeros? Book readers can probably (&amp; hopefully will) chip in to help based on their knowledge of previous reigns prior to the start of ASOIAF. Most agree that while Robert Baratheon was a decent and honorable man, his rule was also a bit too laissez faire, and set up many of the social and economic problems that popped up later in the series. Obviously Joffrey is far too cruel, and Ned, although never a real candidate for king, proved that an unwavering commitment to honor and moral justice is extremely unpractical in the Westeros political system. So what's the key to a long, successful reign? What combination of intelligence, ruthlessness, cunning, political scheming, and military prowess is needed to sit on the Iron Throne for a goodly amount of time?",20,9,False,self,,,,,

Additionally, I am not sure how much this topic might have already been discussed but I will present it for discussion nonetheless.

Many people including myself become confused regarding Shae's actions in Season 4. Many of us believed that the show would take an alternate path to resolve these lovers story as the show relationship between Tyrion and Shae seemed like a far more genuine love affair than in the books. In the books less focus was placed on Shae as a major character and her only significance in my observation was serving as Tyrion's ""companion."" (I am severely allergic to crossbow bolts to the chest so I will refrain from using that word.) Whereas in the show she was given more character mainly being more strongly attached to Tyrion and even appeared to share actual affection for him which is something that you would not generally expect from a woman in her profession. Giving Shae that amount of connection to Tyrion in addition to her protection of Sansa in the show in my opinion made her more likable character for the viewers, but for those of us who knew the eventual outcome we were often speculating about the possible alteration.

When finally we viewed the events in the season finale despite the differences presented Shae's character she turned out to be exactly as portrayed in the books and she was simply attempting to elevate her position in life by seducing men in power. Her jealousy when Tyrion was married to Sansa was not jealousy because of love for Tyrion but rather it was out of fear that she was being cast aside and all her efforts up to that point would have been for nothing. The only issue that I had trouble working through was why in seven hells did she care so much for Sansa when there was apparently no reason. The answer I came up with was that she was simply hedging her bets. She was already attached to Tyrion, but that would mean little to nothing if the Starks won the war.

Shae first appears in the Lannister camp at the very beginning of the War of the Five Kings when the Lannisters were in the best position in the war. She was then relieved from the service of some low officer or lord (I can't remember if we ever learn who) in favor of a bed with one of Tywin Lannister's sons which in my opinion is to convenient to be coincidence and we were never privileged to the details of how Bronn found her. My thoughts are that she overheard Bronn looking for a ""companion"" for a Lannister and made good use of the opportunity presented. When the Lannisters then appear to be losing against the Stark armies who are defeating them in every battle she then attempts to win favor with Sansa Stark because she is a high lords daughter and the sister to the King in the North (THE KING IN THE NORTH!). She berates Tyrion for marrying Sansa even though he has made it known that he does not love her, and it is not until the opening of season 4 that she makes attempts to get close to him again, because of the events of the Red Wedding which solidified Lannister victory. However, Tyrion wants to send her away from King's Landing which is not what Shae wants to happen so she betrays Tyrion and testifies at his trial to gain favor with the remaining Lannisters who would still have a head.

Story lines like Shae's are what makes me really love GoT. She is not the most important person in the story but yet she is still given the opportunity to have desires and motivations and to even become a player in the game. These are only my thoughts and ideas based on my recollection of events and could be accurate or completely erroneous. Even if you all disagree with my thoughts I really encourage the discussion because there is nothing more thoroughly enjoyable than discussing GoT. Take care!

I've seen the series twice, but watched along with him anyway. Every so often I would ask him to predict what comes next, here are the predictions I remember:

Bran becomes an archer to kill Jamie 

Arya kills Sansa with needle while playing

Joffrey kills Robert with Cerseis help

Jon snow becomes a white walker after being sent to the wall

Tyrion gets killed trying to save Joffrey from Stanises sword

Ned stark holds the iron throne after Robert...somehow..

Rob stark flips Jamie to their side

Fucking Tywin and Rob meet on the battlefield and one dies

The dothraki kill the sliver lady after her blood of my blood dies

The last one I can remember, and my personal favorite: Tyrion took the blame for ARYAS murder

To be fair, we watched the whole series in a few days so he didn't really have time to think...but still, smiling and nodding while he says these is tourture. I wanted to grab him by the collar and scream ""NO, STUPID BOY NO"" but you gotta let the show reveal itself.

Just need help understanding a quote from A Game of Thrones. Please don't upvote this post (I don't see why anyone would, though.)

I've watched all four seasons and I'm in the process of finishing the first book. But for some odd reason, I am having trouble comprehending what Maester Luwin means when he tells Bran and Rickon, wewe shall need to find a stonecarver who knew his likeness well

Does Maester Luwin mean that they're going to need a stonecarver who knew what Lord Eddard looked like in order to create an accurate depiction of him through a statue or tomb?

I understand in the show, this is the scene where Maester Luwin confirms to Bran that Lord Eddard had been executed at the Great Sept of Baelor, and Bran and Rickon's dreams indeed came true. I just don't understand what Maester Luwin means by that quote, though. Perhaps my reading comprehension has depreciated severely, because I feel really stupid at the moment. 

Anyway, thanks in advance for any help!",9,21,False,self,,,,,

Here are the contenders:

http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Strongholds

Now, for me, in no particular order:

**Storm's End** - Going from the story of the castles' creation, if you believe the tales, and add in the fact it has never been taken be either force or siege, it is probably one of the strongest contenders for the title.

**Riverrun** - Sitting smack dab in the middle of three rivers, it has excellent cover and I can't recall when it was taken...if ever.

**Harrenhal** - By sheer size, this one should take the cake, but it has its problem. It takes a whole army just to garrison it, plus, it's mostly in ruins thanks to Aegon the Conqueror. I would like to try and be unbiased and have it considered pre-Aegon, but it was only completed for like a day.

**The Twins** - A lot of Riverlands castles, huh? Perhaps being smack dab in the center of Westeros forced a lot of them to built strong holds to protect their lands. Anyway, it's two matching castles on each side of the river, with a bridge across to connect them.

**The Eyrie** - not as grand of a stronghold as some of the others, but having the Bloody Gate protect the Vale, they pretty much cannot be besieged. On top of that, it's only a thin mule-trail up to the Eyrie itself. Without dragons (or possibly a giant ~~eagle~~ falcon) I don't see how you could possibly take this castle.

**Casterly Rock** - It is literally a fortress built from a mountain that overhangs on the sea. With the ocean rushing up against the seaside wall, I can't imagine trying to climb into it as the Wildlings did climbing the Wall, and that leaves little room to attack it from any other point. I'd have to place the Rock higher than the Eyrie on my pick-list, only because -- should an enemy get past the Bloody Gates, the only thing that supplies the Eyrie is a dumbwaiter...and if that was taken...?

Finally, **Greywater Watch** - Unless you're a crannogman, you probably never have nor ever will see it... I mean, the castle *moves*. Not being able to even find the castle you want to attack is probably the best defense you can get.

I suppose if I had to choose an order right now, it would be: Greywater Watch -&gt; Storm's End/Casterly Rock -&gt; The Eyrie -&gt; Harrenhal

**EDIT**: After reading through the comments, I feel **Winterfell** gets, at the very least, an honorable mention. Double walls with a moat between them (with the proper garrison) would make it a fairly solid fortress. Though I must say that in its current state (post- ~~Theon~~ Reek) it's in a fairly poor state.

**EDIT #2**: **Dragonstone**. Against an assault, it would have to be an impressive navy to take it, since the fortress is basically the entire island. Besieged however, since it cannot support itself at all, it would go down in a few months.",93,39,False,self,,,,,

|Discuss your reactions to the episodes with perspective from the whole show. Talk about details you missed the when you first watched the show. Point out foreshadowing details that you noticed. Discuss an actor who is totally nailing their part (or not). In general, what did you think about the episodes and where the story is going? Book vs. Show comparisons are welcome, but you need to use spoiler tags for any book differences that do not appear in the show.|

* **This thread is scoped for SEASON 4 SPOILERS** - Turn away now if you have not seen all of the episodes! Open discussion of all aired TV events up to and including episode 4.10 is ok without tags.

* **[Book spoilers still need tags!](#b)** - If it's not in the show, [tag it](/r/gameofthrones/wiki/spoiler_guide).  Events from episodes *after* this one need tags.

* **Please read the [posting policy](/r/gameofthrones/wiki/posting_policy) before posting.**

* **[Use green theory tags for speculation](#g)** - Mild/vague speculation is ok without tags, but use a warning tag on any detailed theories on events that may be revealed in the remaining books or in the show.

* **Posting policy reminder:** Don't post or ask for non-pay sources.

This time, for greatest warrior of all time! Okay, now before I set the rules, I want to have a quick reminder to all:

**SPOILERS ALL** So if you have not read all the books and short stories be warned there may and probably **WILL BE SPOILERS**! You've been forewarned!

Okay, now for the rules...

**Qualifications** - NOT exclusive to Westeros (obvious from many of the names you'll see shortly). 1v1, not taking into consideration their prowess as a leader. Not tourney, not lance, not mounted. And none of those sissy bows or crossbows (Sorry Anguy)! Currently alive or dead does not matter. Consider taking each person in their prime (ie- Robert pre-king). The equipment they are most proficient with and own will be what they are wielding (ie- Valyrian Steel)! Even if an axe (Victarion) or Mace (Balon Swann) are preferred weapons, that does not make them ineligible. After all, this isn't a greatest swordman contest, it's greatest warrior! The fight is an arena, flat and solid ground with plenty of room to move and maneuver. They are to be ranked as *exceptional* *talented* *fair*, with only one to be considered the greatest. Here's my initial list!

**ELITE:**
Ser Arthur Dayne -
Aemon the Dragonknight -
Ser Barristan Selmy -
Cregan Stark -
Gwayne Corbray -
Robert Baratheon -
Oberyn Martell ""The Red Viper"" -
The Smiling Knight - 
Daemon Blackfyre

**Exceptional:**
Ser Duncan the Tall -
Ser Jaime Lannister -
Ser Oswell Whent -
Ser Gerold Hightower -
Victarion Greyjoy -
Strong Belwas -
Ser Ryam Redwyne -
Andrik the Unsmiling -
Criston Cole -
Sandor Clegane -
Brienne of Tarth -
Syrio Forel -
Khal Drogo -
Areo Hotah

**Talented:**
Ser Gregor Clegane -
Garlan Tyrell -
Loras Tyrell -
Bronn -
Greatjon Umber -
Qhorin Halfhand -

The wildcard category... I just don't know where to place these guys. A few I'm inclined to set as at least talented (Balonn Swann, Strong Belwas, and Syrio), but I wanted to get a general consensus before I just flat out put them in any category. I was trying to think of a category name between Talented and Exceptional, but couldn't think of one, so I'm open to suggestions!

I know for some, specifically Khal Drogo, that not being on horse *does* take away from much of their true skills. If you guys can think of any names I may have missed, please post and tell me where you think they belong! As for my choice of greatest of all time, I'm probably going to have to be clich and choose Ser Arthur Dayne. Though, Aemon and Daemon both (Daemon more so in my mind) are strong contenders. Enjoy!

P.S. - I'll adjust where people are ranked if anyone can give sufficient reason that they should be moved up or down.

**EDIT**: Grammar and schtuff. Also adding/adjusting names.

**EDIT #2**: Added the *Elite* category and moved names a bit. Keep the comments coming!

**EDIT #3**: Okay, I give. Loras Tyrell has received his bump. Bravo to all for the compelling arguments!

**EDIT #4**: Lots of support to say Sandor &gt; Gregor. This just enhances the **HYPE** for **CLEGANEBOWL**! Also bumped up Brienne, I'm interested to see what she can really do (Show-wise, she does beat the piss out of the Hound, so I'm on board now!).

**EDIT #5**: Demoted the Kingslayer! Bwahahaha!

**EDIT #6**: Drogo and Grey Worm get some love, Rhaegar gets a demotion (if only he had a dragon...)",120,22,False,self,,,,,

ARYA STARK DEATH SCENE


A horse gallops across the marshy lands of the north carrying two riders on it's back. On the front is a groggy and weary young girl sporting a leaking gash at her side which she presses onto with all her might, the blood coating her hand crimson red. She lay shaking with her face on the horse's mane supported only by her companion, a man of curly brown hair and an ever changing face.


""Where.. where are we going?"" Arya asks with a tired shivering breath.


""Home Lady Stark. We are going home."" the man responds flatly


""Did we win?"" she asks again.


""Daenerys Targaryen is no more thanks to you and Kings Landing burns. Some would call that a victory."" the man replies flatly once more.


""And Jon?"" she asks through the pain as the light in her eyes darkens.


""Right here dear sister and look, we're back."" The man proudly proclaims as their horse reaches the ruined city of Winterfell, once upon a time the seat of the North.


""Jon? How did you?"" she asks groggily trying her best to look back.


'Jon' hops down and pulls Arya into his arms carrying her bridal style so she could glimpse his face. She smiles upon seeing his hazy visage, it had been so long since they were together she thought she could never recognize him but there he was.


""I remember what you said, I would be found frozen with my needle between my fingers."" she tells him deliriously and smiling.


""I'm sorry our reunion had to be this way."" Jon apologizes as he carries her through the gates.


""What would father think if he could see me right now I wonder."" she asks no one in particular


'Jon Snow' lays her down on a large hay before looking solemnly at her and pondering a course of action, bury her as was the custom here or burn her as Lord Snow was doing purely out of necessity given recent events.


""Father, I am sorry if I have upset you by taking the path I took. I wanted nothing more than to hurt those who destroyed our family. In these final moments I pray to the gods, old and new that they forgive me."" she groggily recites a prayer she made up.


""I am very proud of you Arya, the path you took was harsh and brutal yet like a true Stark you came out of it stronger and wiser."" 'Ned Stark' or someone wearing his visage bends down to console the dying girl, delicately stroking her head.


""I missed you so much."" she cries, tears washing the blood and dirt from her cheeks.


Arya's body seems to relax having let go of it's previous struggling tension as her father stays by her side until her final moments. Her raggedy breathing becomes softer and measured, her furious heart eases and night seems to roll in faster than ever before in history. A single snowflake floats down and delicately strikes her nose as she draws her last breath, a skinny blade clutched between her hands.


Her companion stays by her side even still, the faceless had no family and did not belong to any place. They were no one yet for the first time in forever he felt genuinely sad at someone's passing especially since she was just another assassin. He buries her with her ancestors, leaving a message for the new lord of the North before disappearing into the growing mist.

Beside the point of Renly being a total dick to Stannis (seriously the whole exchange is just Renly being a confident asshole). I found out Renly and Catelyn didn't know about Joffery's heritage until Stannis sent out the letters. Renly received the knowledge about a week prior so there was no way he knew when he pronounced himself King. Stannis only threw his hat in the race because he knew Joffery had no right to the throne while Renly basically schemed to get the crown because he wanted it. You don't have to agree with me but i think Renly just as power-hungry and conniving as the Lannisters while Stannis (Mannis circle jerk aside) crowned himself King because he knew that Joffery had to right to the throne.,35,15,False,self,,,,,

It's quite common these days, but still. Someone else noted that we'd all be called Snow if we'd be in the GoT universe (we practicly live at the polar circle). One of my other friends disagreed and said she wouldn't be a Snow since her parents were from much further south. This gave me the idea to creat a map similar to [this.](http://gameofthrones.net/images/Westeros_Maps/Map_Westeros_Political.gif) But using our own world map


**The map** 

[This is what I've done so far](http://i.imgur.com/jBusPsT.jpg). **It's a work in progress** so it's fairly rough around the edges. I'll probably gradient the ""borders"" or give them a more distinct line to separate them. I've used a few diffrent maps to base the locations on. 

Namely: 

* [Big mountains around the world](http://www.nationsonline.org/maps/physical_world_map_600px.jpg)

* [Avarage temperatures](http://www.mapsofworld.com/world-maps/image/wether/average-temparature-january-enlarge.gif)

* [Desert vs forrest in Africa](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/21/Africa_satellite_orthographic.jpg)

**Why is that there...?**

As I said, it's a work in progress so these things can shift around. Let me give you and idea of my thought process behind the map: At first I was trying to match the areas geographical position to each other e.g. Snow north, Sand south. However, due to the way the GoT universe is, Sand isn't as far down as something like South Africa. The further down south you go, the warmer it gets, but after the equator, that flips around and the further down south you get, the colder it gets. From what I understand, Westeros ends somewhere close to what would be the equator. And people like Oberyn Martell sort of remind me of people from the middle east-ish area. and therefor Dorne would be around the middle east. 

**This is where you come in Reddit.**

I want opinions on the locations I've chosen for each piece of land. Do you want me to switch some of the regions around? Shift some borders? It's all layered so I can easily make changes to this. 

Specificly I'm looking for stuff like: 
&gt; Africa should be hill instead of South America because The Reach is more similar to Chile, Brazil and South America in general.

Did protecting the faith mean killing people who didn't believe in them? I'm guessing the seven pointed star is like their version of the bible but how did that religion spread so quickly and why was it basically only in the south of westeros? The north keeps to the old gods who are actually pretty gruesome and require sacrifices iirc. 

I guess I'm kinda looking for a summary of the religions/gods of westeros/planetos. Bravosi worship the many faced gods. The Lord of light is up and coming. The seven is basically in westeros only. Am I missing any ?

I bet some of you are wondering where your favourite (or not-so-favourite) new blood has gone. Well I'm here with an explanation:

My mum had a few gallstones and was rushed to the hospital. Most of the end of August for me was helping her recover, not much time for GOT.

Now I've moved into college and the WIFI is actually good enough for watching the shows.... HOWEVER... My roommate is halfway through *A Clash of Kings* and there's no way in hell I'm spoiling anything for him by watching the show. I might be able to sneak a few in every once in awhile but no promises...

While a long absence is a good reason to think the actress might not return, we have a lot more to worry about than just LSH if that holds true. We have, however, seen many characters disappear for long periods and make a return with the same actor playing them.

Note: I haven't finished all of ADWD yet, so there may be appearances (or lack thereof) that I don't know about. 

Characters that disappeared for a while and reappeared (with the same actor):

* Lysa and Robin Arryn - They were in a few episodes of S1, then reappeared about 30 episodes later in S4.

* Alliser Thorne - Absent from 22 straight episodes between S1 and S4.

* Maester Aemon - Absent from 20 straight episodes between S1 and S3.

* Janos Slynt - Absent from 18 straight episodes between S2 and S4.

* Biter - Absent from 18 straight episodes between S2 and S4.

* Hot Pie - Part of Arya's story since S1 until they parted ways in S3. Reappeared once 14 episodes later in S4.

* Dontos - Absent from 11 straight episodes between S2 and S4.

* Grenn - Absent from 8 straight episodes between S3 and S4.

* Littlefinger - Absent from 6 straight episodes between S3 and S4. 

I'm probably missing some, but I think there is plenty of evidence to show that it's very possible for an actor to be gone from the series for an extended period of time and then return, although none of them are quite as big of a character as Catelyn.

Some characters that have been missing for a while that we should (or at least could) see return:

* Catelyn - Obviously.

* Lancel Lannister - Last seen at the Battle of Blackwater Bay in S2. Got injured, but supposedly still alive. Could reappear, but the story might not necessarily require it.

* Kevan Lannister - Has only appeared in 4 episodes, last seen in S2. You'd definitely expect him to be in S5.

* Walder Frey - Hasn't been seen since the end of S3. Also had a period of absence between S1 and S3. We're all waiting for revenge.

* Illyrio - Last seen in S1. Appeared in 3 episodes. Confirmed to return in S5 played by the same actor.

* Brynden 'Blackfish' Tully - Appeared in 5 episodes of S3. Expected to return in S5 or later, although the story may work around it (but then what happened to him?).

* Edmure Tully - Like Brynden, last seen at the Red Wedding and his status is unknown.

* Myrcella Baratheon - Last seen in S2. Will be recast for S5.

* Balon Greyjoy - He's still alive as far as we know. Only been in a few episodes, last seen in S3. My guess is that he will not return and his death will be announced when they start the new Greyjoy storyline.

* Yara Greyjoy - She's stuck around, but only appeared in one episode for both S3 and S4. We should be seeing a lot more of her.

* Osha and Rickon - They left in S3. Will we ever see them again?

* Gendry - Sailed away in S3. Whether his story is finished or not is unknown. Maybe he could return in the same or similar role as he did in AFFC.

* Eddard Stark - Some have suggested that he could appear in Bran's visions, although it's probably unlikely.

Let me know if there are any others that I missed. There is always the chance that a character could return and be played by a different actor. It definitely wouldn't be a first.

(The Stark kids look so young!)  I'm only two episodes in and I got to the part where Cersei visits Cat who's sitting vigil at Bran's bedside.  She tells her the story about the black-haired baby she lost and is very uncharacteristically kind to Cat, even going so far as to say that she prays to the Mother every morning and night to return Cat's child to her.


So here's my question, and maybe it's been discussed before.  Why did Cersei go visit Cat in the first place?  Was it just to check up on the situation and make sure Bran hadn't been mumbling anything in his sleep?  Did she go up there in the hopes that Bran might be by himself and she could finish the job Jaime started?  (Unlikely, I know.)  Cat surely wouldn't have expected the queen to go out of her way to extend her sympathies in such a personal, close-friend kind of way, so what were Cersei's motives for doing it?  You could even say she was acting out of maternal instinct since we know how much she loves her children and and it's one of her worst nightmares to imagine herself in Cat's position.


I've enjoyed the discussions I've had with folks here in the past, so I'm wondering what you guys think were Cersei's motives for making this visit and saying the things she did.",13,2,False,self,,,,,

Rewatching it made me love it even more.
Specifically, the council meeting in the beginning, Edmure's failure at archery, goodbye to Hotpie, Sexy Pod, and Hand removal a la Jaime.

One thing I didn't understand was the Horse thingy with Jon Snoo. Can someone explain the significance if there is any?

With the council meeting I love how Tywin set up the room to gauge everyone's strategic ability. Varys, Littlefinger and Pycelle walk in with Tyrion behind and are stunned by a standing Tywin at the head and five chairs on one side. LF the second to move sits next to Big T, pissing off Varys in the process and Ol' P not giving a shit (basically). Cersei strolls in, thinking outside the box moves a chair to the otherside of her father. Finally Tyrion, with the unmentioned 'no moving chairs' rule broken, loudly moves the last remaining chair to the opposite head of the table. A great power play in my mind.

Someone obviously skipped his archery training when he was a child. Robb's face after the second arrow was loosed; ""Don't laugh, this is a sad moment"" -Robb

Saying goodbye was such a sad moment for me. I love that guy, and he's gone, never to see him again (bookwise).

What could have Pod done for free sex? Satisfy the women as well, it's simple guys, jeez. 
First time I saw this, I hadn't read the books beforehand (intended) and that just slapped me across the face and called me bitch. Figuratively.

Perchance to the degree that you would've preferably had it altered or excluded as means to reserve screen-time, which could be utilized to include a scene omitted from books or prolong an already existent one. Please offer the basis and rationale of your opinions!


In my opinion the scene in [S01E07] where Littlefinger teaches Ros and Armeca his view of seduction, is to a great extent utterly irrelevant and time-consuming (Time which could be better spent elsewhere). In the scene Littlefinger's monologue offers insight into his methods and motivation. He speaks about his love for Catelyn Stark and his duel with Brandon to explain his approach to the game. We've had hints of his childhood before and he referenced the duel when he was first introduced to Eddard but it is worth exploring his history in more detail so that we more fully understand his motivations. It is also important for the show to establish Littlefinger more firmly in the mind of the viewer before his betrayal of Eddard. The scene isn't awful considering those facts, and I believe that Littlefinger's character isn't being misconstrued at all. However I disliked the manner of this scene and I would've preferred if his character was established in a more effectual way. Overall I dont think it deserves the criticism I've seen heaped upon it but it's definitely not the shows finest moment.


Edit: It's hard trying to convey what you ultimately want said with a complicated scene. What I'm trying to say is that the scene is very relevant in the sense that it offers insight into Littlefinger's methods, characteristics and motivations. Nonetheless, I believe the scene was poorly executed since it's in large a cringe-worthy (play with her arse, etc.) sexposition, which made it a far less effectual IMO. Don't get me wrong, the scene is purposeful, but I wished it was somehow altered. 

Moreover, the aforementioned scene is also not *the* most irrelevant and/or ineffectual one in the show, but *one* of them, in my opinion. It's simply just an example of mine.

""A tall lord with copper skin and silver-gold hair stood beneath the banner of a fiery stallion"" Dothraki are known to have copper skin and Targaryens are known to have silver-gold hair. So, I'd say it is Rhaego who is somehow alive and wins the throne with Stannis. Which is odd and unlikely.. Maybe that's what would've happened if he survived? I dunno.

""Rubies flew like drops of blood from the chest of a dying prince, and he sank to his knees in the water and with his last breath murmured a woman's name."" I'd say this confirms the R+L=J for sure. Reading that line made me 100% certain. Oh, and along with the line that goes something along the lines of; ""a pale blue rose forming on a wall of ice"" or something also helps confirm it. Jon is at the wall and 2 times so far(maybe more) Eddard or somebody related Lyanna to a pale blue rose. That REALLY confirms it for me.

I have no clue about the whole Aegon/The dragon has three heads thing. The first time I read through it, I felt like that was symbolizing another Targaryen being alive but I have no clue. It could mean that Aegon is alive because ""The dragon has three heads"" could mean Dany, Viserys, and Aegon. I might be reaching although that definitely has some significance.

And lastly, and my favorite prediction:
""A corpse stood at the prow of a ship, eyes bright in his dead face, grey lips smiling sadly. A blue flower grew from a chink in a wall of ice, and filled the air with sweetness."" I believe that could mean Jon Snow dies/becomes a wight. I see the ""eyes bright in his dead face"" symbolizing the fact that he will die and become a wight. Wights have bright eyes. ""A blue flower grew from a chink in a wall of ice, and filled the air with sweetness."" Death and then talks of a pale blue rose. Jon will die.

However just now, about 70% of the way through the combined version, did I read this: http://imgur.com/RAQns1X.jpg

Finally this story has picked up. The first 50% just felt like the longest build up and it was tough to get through. Not much really happened however now the story is all coming together.

The Martells are off to fuck shit up in Kings Landing. Cersie finally got the shit she deserves. Brienne saw Cat alive and from the last chapter I read of her, is in the midst of being hanged. Tyrion is on his way to the Queen, Jaime has won Riverrun and Sansa is to be given the Eeyrie thanks to Petyr.

Fucking finally. Big George, you've made this book a tough read, but if it continues the way it has the last few chapters, well then it was worth it.

Also please no spoilers unless tagged or you are sure it is before the chapters I have stated. Cheers",11,0,False,default,,,,,

It will allow subreddits to have designs sold to benefit charities.  This is a call for all artists and designers to submit work for the contest that will determine /r/gameofthrone's design. 

You will get to vote on the submissions, and the winning entry will be professionally printed and made available for purchase through the new Reddit service. **Proceeds will be donated to the [Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary](http://www.wildspiritwolfsanctuary.org/), George R.R. Martin's favorite wolf charity and home of [The Westeros Pack](http://www.wildspiritwolfsanctuary.org/westeros_pack.php).**

For this campaign we are printing 16"" x 48 (1.5 x 4) wall scrolls/banners.  That will offer some variety to fans used to seeing a lot of t-shirt designs, and the traditional format allows many more design options.  The winning design will need to be in vector format for printing, so if the source is raster it will be converted.   

**Here are the technical details:**

* There is no color limit
* Print dimensions are 16"" x 48 (1.5 x 4)
* Raster development should be at least 4,800 x 14,400 pixels
* If your design does not fill the entire space, specify a background color
* Banners will be printed on one side
* You can use the Reddit Snoo or other official Reddit media in the design if desired
* We do not yet have the OK from HBO to allow official Game of Thrones logos/photos/other media

Feel free to ask any questions you have about this.  The details are not fully known yet, but more information will be posted as soon as it's available.  Please check back for updates.  The turnaround for this is likely going to be quick, so if you want to submit work, please get started now.

Work can be submitted by making a comment below or by [sending a modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fgameofthrones).  A separate poll will be set up for the vote.

**Update:** The banners are screened onto a polyester fabric and mounted with black plastic rods.   They're ready to be hung on a wall immediately, no framing needed.  The end result should look something [like this](http://imgur.com/KMKly9U). 

**Update 2:** Ok, as part of the competition the submitter of the winning design will be getting a free banner.

**Update 3:** On the use of HBO media, the advice is to avoid anything with a ""TM"" symbol next to it on [the HBO GOT Store](http://store.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/index.php?v=hbo_shows_game-of-thrones ).  Or make sure that everything you do could be considered an artistic reinterpretation of the source.  The Reddit Snoo is is perfectly ok, and making a Snoo that looks like a GoT character is definitely reinterpretation if you want to go that route.      

**Update 4:**  Reddit is now throwing in a year of Reddit Gold for the winner!

**Update 5:**  The deadline for submissions has been moved to next spring to be more in line with the Season 5 premiere and generate more visibility for the whole thing.  Artists should expect to have their submissions in by March.  A more specific deadline will be announced once it's known.

**Update 6:  This contest is officially closed.  The overall point was to set up some charity items for the service that's now been released as [Redditmade](http://redditmade.com/).  The Redditmade launch has been more than problematic, and we've not gotten enough submissions during this low traffic time of year anyway, so it's not worth focusing effort on this right now.  If Redditmade is updated to make it more viable for subreddits we can look at it again fresh in the Spring.**

Until last week I never watched an episode and kept myself sheltered from spoilers. I just got done watching all 4 seasons. It was great but I have to ask,

Why do people like Daenerys? or why don't I like her?

The annoying thing about her is how badly written her story arch seems to be. Maybe it gets better later, I only know the show. Apart from a few parts of the first season there is no dramatic tension at all. She has no personality at all. It creates a big contrast with the other characters making her scenes incredibly boring. Everything is so easy for her, everything just ""works"". Whereas the other characters are going through life or death situations, scheming and backstabbing. She is just so unbelievably dull I think the show is significantly improved if all her parts were removed. I really hope gets less scenes in season 5. Maybe she is just there to make the other characters more interesting.
