So I was in Belfast visiting the locations, got to meet the Direwolves and different scenes, I was told a few little vague details about season 6. 

First Spoiler - Is that they were recently on the set of the wall and they said ""lets just say the wall is in pretty bad shape!"" This could be anything or something silly but read into it as you want!

Second - We were asked several times about deaths and what we thought, Was Sansa dead? Was Theon dead? Was Jon dead? Was Stannis dead? Was the Hound (Spotted drinking in a local pub) dead? They said we normally get to see deaths on screen and he left it at that!

Third - There is a huge emphasis on Brans storyline next season becoming a greenseer and he may be able to see about Jon's mother!

Fourth - There is a huge battle upcoming in season 6 around winterfell and is being referred to as ""The Battle of the Bastards"".

Fifth - There was shooting done at a local famous bridge up at the Giants causeway which will be represented as the Iron Isles and will be a big storyline!!!

I think thats all that was said at least thats all I can remember, I will post more if I recall anything else, Tour was awesome but freezing cold!!!",77,100,False,self,,,,,

9,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2016-2-1,2016,2,1,12,43mkl5,self.gameofthrones,[All Spoilers] Something neat I noticed while re-watching Season 1 (music),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/43mkl5/all_spoilers_something_neat_i_noticed_while/,jdund117,1454296878,"In episode 2 of Season 1, there is a scene where Jon says goodbye to Bran before he leaves for the Night's Watch.  I noticed that the music in this scene is the exact same music that plays when Jon is killed at the end of Season 5.  I had previously thought that Ramin Djawadi made that track specifically for Jon's death scene, but he actually made it for Season 1.

[First Scene](https://youtu.be/6nno_Dx8S40?t=50s) (0:50)

[Second Scene](https://youtu.be/uOOllehJqcM?t=3m8s) (3:08)

It's neat because there are a few parallels between the scenes.  For example, in the S1 scene, he's saying goodbye to Bran, but Catelyn is glaring at him and then tells him to leave.  After Ned closes the door, Jon Snow never sees Bran again.  In the S5 scene, he is betrayed and killed by Olly.

My interpretation of the use of the same music in these two scenes is character transformation.  When Jon walks out the door, he effectively leaves behind his old life as the Bastard of Winterfell to become a man of the Night's Watch.  When he is killed in S5e10, we can only assume he's leaving behind his old life as a man of the Night's Watch (more like THE man of the Night's Watch) to become someone different.

If music is meant to convey meaning in this series (which it does more often than one would think) I think it's being used here to convey that Jon isn't going to stay dead, but rather transition to another stage of his life.  Just as he said goodbye to Bran and Winterfell, he also says goodbye to the Night's Watch and all that the boy Lord Commander Jon Snow was.

Far-fetched, probably, but I thought it was neat.

**TL;DR** - Jon Snow death music was in Season 1 when he says goodbye to Bran and leaves.  Jon, in dying, isn't going away, but he's not going back to who he was.

In all honesty I'd pick Aemon Targaryan to be the king. I feel like if he was on the throne rather than the Mad King Robert's Rebellion never would have happened. Unfortunately that means that a lot of the characters that we love probably wouldn't exist. 

Aemon is kind, wise and very observant. I think he would have been a great fit. 

Another character that I would like to see on the throne is Stannis Baratheon. He seems like he would be the best at Protecting the Realm. He understands the threat of the White Walkers and doesn't take any bullshit from anybody. 

Who would you guys like to see on the Iron Throne?

EDIT: I'm going all in on Stannis, considering that some characters probably wouldn't exist within the timeline of Aemon being the king.

You can also include the small council if you would like. My dream small council (implying that it is a time of peace and there wouldn't be any families trying to usurp the throne) would consist of:

Hand of the King: I'd probably go with Davos, as /u/rayluaza pointed out, Davos is intelligent and also has a commoner's perspective.

Master of War: I'd have to go with Tywin Lannister. The Lannister army is one of the best in the 7 kingdoms and he has been at the helm for over 30 years.

Master of Coin: Petyr Baelish. A self made man. Even though the crown was in debt while he was master of coin I feel like he would do a decent job, I wouldn't know who else could be Master of Coin, maybe Tyrion?

Master of Whisperers: Gotta go with Varys. He has little birds all around the known world and always knows what is going on. He's the man

Master of Laws: Ned Stark. Honorable, wise and just. ""He who passes the sentence swings the sword."" I couldn't think of anyone better. 

Master of Ships: Balon Greyjoy. Assuming that he would be willing. Being the Lord of the Iron Islands I would think that he would have plenty of knowhow considering Naval warfare.

Lord Commander of the Kingsguard: Gotta go with Ser Barristan. Well respected and has won the most single combats in history.

Grand Maester: Pycelle. Even though he's plenty sleazy, he serves the crown justly. Just as he had been doing before the show started.

There are some improbable details and some pretty common ideas but they are working to what I would like to be the ending. I'm not promising anything special but if you like reading other people's theories, by all means, read on! :D

----------------------------------------------------------------

My first theory is that the religion of the Lord of Light is the only true religion and that it is the same religion as the religion of the Old Gods, just from the perspective of the other side. 

I believe this mostly because it explains pretty much all occurences of the super-natural in the series, from the shadow baby to the resurrection of Dondarrion, from the White Walkers to the Dragons. 
I believe the Lord of Light is on the side of Dragons, which are fire made flesh and is fighting for the resurrecting of the Targaryan dynasty.

So now you might be asking; so what about the weirwood trees, the raven beard -fuck my life I'm stuck in a tree- dude who is gonna train Bran, what about wargs and the white walkers and their necromancy? What about the Children of the Forest?
Simple; they represent the Darkness (as it is called in their religion).

Wait... Bran is gonna fight for the Dark side!?
Well, yes and no.

We all know George RR Martin tries very hard to instill a post-tolkien sense of morality into his work, that is to say; there is no evil and good, just a shitload of grey.

It is because of this that Bran will find out that Barkbeardbird in fact works for the side of the White Walkers and he will explain why it is important that they win. They will have a good reason, a good enough reason to slaughter hundreds and thousands of men. maybe Dragons if left unopposed cause what happened in Old Valyria again? Maybe the return of Dragons could eventually spell the end of Westeros?

So why are the Dragons and the Lord of Light represented as the good and the White Walkers and wights as evil?

A song of Ice and Fire takes place 4000 years after the White Walkers were defeated, we all know the saying; History is written by victors. 
We know everything about the Dragons, the greatness of Valyria but the White Walkers were driven up north, their legacy is gone, their story untold, they are the big unknown, the strangers.
Now ofcourse The Lord of Light's religion would call them 'The Darkness'. Asking him what White Walkers are is like asking an 1950s American what a Communist is; you're probably not gonna get a very unbiased or even, realistic, opinion.


At the start of the series it has been summer for almost 10 years, this is seen as a good thing but it is not; it means the seasons have become unbalanced. The preservation of the balance will be the climax of the series.

I see it as this; There are two sides. Ice and Fire. They are equal, eternally trying to wipe each other out, and somehow, if one of them succeeds, it will be the end of the world. Either by ice, or by fire.

They are not evil, they are simply two equally important factions with violent and peaceful sides. The Dragons are to Fire as the Wild Walkers are to Ice. The Children of the forest are the peaceful side of the Ice Faction, just like the Red Priest, who through the Fire Side can heal the sick and resurrect the dead.


I also think that most ancient families belong to one side or the other, except for the Greyjoys, who through their drowned god, are the truly independent ones. They are water, both unfrozen and unburned. 

Obviously the Starks are a noble family of the ice faction, the Boltons are the dark side of the ice faction. The old families that build Valyria were the noble families of Fire, their violent families were families like the Targaryens, the Dragon Families and the warlocks.

The Lannisters, Baratheons and Tyrells are the true human dynasties. Families of the new world. They have no affiliation with either side but since magic has been coming back Baratheon has been swallowed whole by the war of Ice and Fire. First being used by Ice, which used the family to cast down the Targaryens and then rewarded it with power. Then Stannis joined forces with the Fire, and ended up being used (maybe even punished) to aid Jon Snow and to destroy the new age of men and their 5 kings, including Stannis himself. So the Targaryen Dynasty can be reborn in it's ashes.
--------------------------------------------------------------
**All that being said, this is what it comes down to:
**
The world of game of thrones consists of the **OLD WORLD** and the **WORLD OF MEN**.
The **old world** consist of the side of **ice** and **fire**.
**4000 years ago the side of fire won** and **the side of ice surrendered but was not destroyed**.
The side of fire **because of it's victory**, resulted in the greatest city ever known, **the Valyrian Empire**.
But **because Ice was not there to preserve the balance, it grew until it destroyed itself.** (the doom) 
But again not everything was destroyed, just like **a small piece of Ice** remained north of the wall. **A small piece of Fire** remained on Dragonstone; The Targaryens.
So both sides of the old world were now reduced to just a small part of what they had once been. But **they have slowly been returning** to the world and after a 10 year summer, only a few decades after a 10 year winter (as told by old Nan) caused the old world to come into action once again; the balance has been lost, like a spinning top, it is starting to wobble because it lost it's speed, it's energy. 

I think the series will end one of two ways; either John Snow, the son of both ice, fire and men, will broker a truce between the three factions (which has been a theory I've heard before)... But what I hope happens is that he will fail to do so, after which ice and fire somehow cause mutual destruction, causing the death of the old world, a new balance and the true beginning of the age of men. So the series encapsulates the final act, the ending, of the Song of Ice and Fire and the beginning of the Song of Men. 

It will be the transition from the world of magic, to the world of men; from fantasy to human drama. In this way not only the story comes full circle, but the themes aswell. The story begins as a political (human) drama, slowly becomes a fantasy story and then finds its way back to put humans at the center of the stage.

I'm basing most of my question off of the TV-verse. The reason this question has come up for me is that even though I've gone through the series thus far 5 full times, everything that I see points to her loving him until the absolute very end. What I'm specifically referring to is Tyrion finding Shae in Tywin's bed. Throughout the series, I could see them growing closer, they both show genuine worry for one another, they both try desperately to fight the system. Shae at one point even berates Tyrion for being afraid of his father and that basically, she'd fight even his father if it came to it.

Now I get the part where Tyrion basically does the whole, ""I'm telling you I don't love you because I do love you."" trope to chase her away into leaving King's Landing. This is all well and good and I could still even see her fucking him over during his trial as this is the ex-gf BS. But it still isn't registering for me that she was in Tywin's bed at the end. I could understand it if they hinted at at least one other point, that she was a golddigger, but I can't think of a single scene that indicates in this direction until I saw her in Tywin's bed.

Now I get it, Tyrion flips his shit and kills her out of anger, but I just can't accept that D&amp;D were trying to feed me that one of the two following situations was occurring:

1. Shae was able to get over her massive breakup with Tyrion by...  
a.  falling in love with his father.  
b. sleeping with his father in order to get back with him.
2. Shae was never in love with Tyrion but..  
a. She was just in love with the lifestyle that she living with the hand.  
b. She was always working for Tywin from the start.

George doesn't want to be predictable, he wan't to suprise readers and have criticized LOTR for being too predictable with it's good vs. evil theme. So what could be more predictable whan a war between humans and white walkers?

So we have learned from stories about The Long Night which was a long period of time long time before the first book and first season where the white walkers reigned Westeros. A person, The Last Hero/Azor Ahai ""showed up"" and conquered the white walkers. Right now I can't remember who built the wall (the children of the forest?) ,but that doesn't matter. We are told that the people build the wall to protect themself from the white walkers.

That's where my logic breaks. I don't think the wall was build by people or whoever it was. I think that The Last Hero was a diplomat and not a conquerer/soldier and there was no flaming sword. There was a pact between the humans and the white walkers and the white walkers themself built the wall to mark their territory.

The humans have broken the pact which is the reason why the white walkers (others from now on) is now going towards the wall. The others doesn't want to destroy or kill all the free folk, but they want the free folk out which is why they are pushing the free folk towards the wall.

Jon Snow is the key to all of this. Rheagar somehow got to know about the pact and knew that there has to be a balance between fire and ice. Dany is the destroyer, the villain in Game of Thrones who will destroy and destabilize the world. The others fear her and Rheagar knew about this and what his sister will do. Rhaegar did not have a child with Lyanna just because it was love, but because he had to in order to save the future of the world from his sister.

Jon Snow/Stark/Targaryen (whatever he will call himself once he finds out about his parentage) is the one who will make a new pact with the others (he already brought the free folk and the nights watch together so he already knows how to create somewhat peace). Jon is Rhaegar song of ice and fire, the one who must seek to help the others in protecting the world from Dany and in the end a marriage between Jon and a white walker might happen.

What do you folks think? There's probably loopholes here though, but I found it to be a logical theory to me.",19,0,False,self,,,,,

A prediction thread.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4423mj/allspoilerstheory_hi_rgameofthrones_a_prediction/,TheRedPriestHippo,1454536396,"Hello. I'm here with a ""prediction thread"". I like predicting, and I like reading predictions. So let's see yours too! I have seen some set photos so I've put the [AllSpoilers][Theory] tags.

In Kings Landing, Cerisei will spend the first few episodes ""plotting and scheming"" to get revenge on the High Sparrow and his followers, but Tommen will be angry and avoid her in favor of Margaery. Kevan will control the Lannister army. It will all make her crazier. She will only have Quburn and FrankenGregor in her corner. She will come up with a poor plan, but before she can put it into motion the conspiracy between Littlefinger and the Tyrell's will start. Margaery will be released from imprisonment by the High Sparrow thanks to having always been very generous to the poor. She will resume her marriage with Tommen, bringing him out of his self imposed isolation and making him feel comfortable going out in public again. When out amongst the people Tommen will be arrested and imprisoned by the High Sparrow and charged with being a false King, born of incest. Cersei, who categorically denied the charge of incest when confessing her affair with Lancel to the High Sparrow, will be forced to go on trial, along with Tommen. Cersei will confidently demand trial by combat, having FrankenGregor as the ace up her sleeve. Of course, The High Sparrow will have an ace up his sleeve as well. 

http://youtu.be/3ufP2IEKayM

CLEGENEBOWL!!! GETHYPE!!! 

Brother Sandor was healed both physically and spiritually. His soul is clean. He has a seven pointed star carved into his forehead and is completely devout. He and his big brother will decide the fate of Ceresi, Tommen, and the power of House Lannister. As all of this is happening, Littlefinger will kill Kevan, which will hurt the ability of House Lannister to respond to whatever happens in the aftermath of the trial. 

FrankenGregor and Brother Sandor will have an epic battle. Sandor will have a lifetime of rage for his older brother to vent out. It will be completely emotional for him, a catharsis of the highest order. FrankenGregor will feel nothing, say nothing, and not even appear to have any memory of Sandor. Complete indifference. The two giants will cut and brutalize each other. They will discard their weapons, and rip off helmets, and beat each other with fists. FrankenGregor will die with his little brother on top of him, punching his head into mush. Cersei and Tommen are guilty. The gods have decided. The High Sparrow will punish them with exile, House Lannister will go back to Casterly Rock.

This is where Littlefingers part of conspiracy comes to light. Who was ""the handsome young man"" that Littlefinger gave to the Tyrell's? Some say it was Lancel, but Lancel is a devout Sparrow and not Littlefingers to give. Others say it was Olyvar, but Olyvar was his gift to Cersei for testifying against Loras. I believe that Littlefingers gift to the Tyrell's will be...Gendry. He rowed that boat up the coast, right to The Eyrie and has been in Littlefingers pocket ever since. Gendry is the only remaining character with Baratheon blood. If he has Roberts blood, then he also has Targaryan blood through his great grand parents. There are numerous characters who could testify as to who he is, and he perfectly fits the profile of the ideal King to the High Sparrow, with his humble beginnings from Flea Bottom and his feelings about royalty. The High Sparrow will legitimize Gendry as King Gendry of House Baratheon, first of his name, yada yada.. 

http://youtu.be/sDTbls-C09I

The Tyrell's and the High Sparrow(and unbeknownst to the High Sparrow, Littlefinger) have conspired to take down House Lannister in Kings Landing. The High Sparrow will annul the marriage between Tommen and Margaery. As negotiated by the Tyrell's and the High Sparrow, Magaery will marry Gendry. ""The Queen to Four Kings"" they will call her. This creates a peace between The Sparrows and The Tyrell's who still have a large army. Of course, Littlefinger will start plotting to overthrow The Sparrows. Can't have the city controlled by religious fanatics when you deal in whores after all. 

Gendry would obviously be a fantastic King.

In the east Danerys has been captured by Khal Jhaqo and the Dothraki. She will speak to them without fear, constantly stating that she is the Khaleesi, and the Mother of Dragons, etc.. She will start to earn the respect of the Dothraki.

In the meantime, Tyrion will wield a Tywin-like mastery of political affairs in Meereen. He, Varys, and Grey Worm will wipe out the Sons of the Harpy and bring stability to the city. Tyrion will be seduced by a beautiful Red Priestess and start to find religion after killing his father and Shae, and having seen dragons. Followers of The Lord of Light will grow in Meereen. 

The Dothraki who are sympathetic to Danerys will help her escape from Khal Jhaqo and she will go back to Meereen. Knowing that they can't lay siege to the city, the Dothraki will start killing all of the Meereenese outside of the city. Danerys knows she must go to war and meet them in the open field. For most armies this would be a bad idea, but Danerys has dragons, and a very well crafted strategy by Tyrion.

Field of Fire 2.0. Many of the Dothraki will die screaming among the burning ghost grass, with Danerys riding Drogon and setting the them ablaze like Aegon and Balerion 200 years earlier. Khal Jhaqo will get BBQ'd, and thousands will die on their horses.

In the aftermath of the battle, the Dothraki who survived will join the strength of their Khaleesi, as the Dothraki always follow strength. Jorah will die. The Red Priestess will start to convince Tyrion and Dannerys of old prophecies. 

With the city under control, a much bigger army, and all of her enemies vanquished, Danerys will finally go to Westeros. She will leave Daario in Meereen to run the city.

I know there are other storylines, but these are my predictions for Kings Landing and Essos. I'll post my predictions for the other regions when I can. Thanks!

Honestly, watching my parents (who generally dislike fantasy and never watch anything more involved than a weekly sitcom) slowly grow more and more invested in this show, to the point where every day when they'd be off work they'd be rushing me to start the next episode, asking me if the books have any more information on this character or that plot, etc. etc., was really amazing for me. I had a huge amount of fun guiding them through all 5 seasons, and I absolutely love that they can't wait until April (now that I've talked them down about the Jon thing, at least).

Simply having a different religion might not disqualify Stannis from contention, but surely his de facto declaration of war against the Faith of the Seven by burning their altars on Dragonstone ensures that he can never and will never be crowned or receive a coronation from the High Septon, and his rule will never be accepted by the Faith or by the lords, ladies, and smallfolk he presumes to rule. 

So truly, if the Baratheon dynasty is to continue, only Renly can continue it. His naming of a rainbow guard is a nod the the Faith of his people, and an unspoken pledge to protect their religion from those who would seek to take it away from them with fire and steel (people like Stannis.)

3. The scene with Jojen at Crasters Keep, when he visions his hand on fire. I know many people have told me that it was showing him the way of his death (when the child of the forrest blasted his body), but I was very much under the impression that it was the skeleton (white) stabbing that killed him, and the blast was simply to prevent him from becoming a white? (More meat for the army of the dead).

4. If Cersei is found guilty of incest with her brother, and Tommen then being revealed to not be the legitement son of Robert (along with Joffrey), who would then be in line for the throne? Stannis, Renly &amp; Shireen are all dead. I know Gendry is the obvious answer, but nobody knows he's the son of Robert &amp; nobody knows where he is or if he's alive! Who would be in line for the throne at the very moment of/if Cersei was found guilty?

5. Why did we only see *The Faith Militant* in S5? What were they doing during S1-S4?",86,5,False,self,,,,,

I'm here to gauge interest and get feedback on an app I made which is highly relevant to this subreddit, and which I think many users would enjoy. If any mods have an issue with this, please let me know. This post [should be permissible according to the subreddit's posting policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/wiki/posting_policy#wiki_marketing_and_commercial_posts). **This post contains no spoilers for the books or movies.**

As I read through the series, I found it difficult to keep up with the characters and their backgrounds like everyone else, but I was not satisfied with the existing services to rectify this.

Shelfari is great (and is the basis for Kindle's X-Ray feature), but it can be incredibly slow to load, isn't available offline, does not have a convenient mobile website, and doesn't even have a search feature within each book! My solution was to create my own app that compiles the best information from all over the internet (including Shelfari) into a single, lightweight app.

[Reading Guide: Game of Thrones](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.enceladus.ASOIAFGuide) is available on the Google Play Store for Android devices. Here are some of the features I included:

* All five currently released books
* Nearly every character, location, and important group
* Spoiler protection by separating information and descriptions by book
* Easy (offline) access to Westeros and Essos Maps
* And more!

[Here are some \(spoiler-free\) screenshots.](https://imgur.com/a/woj5z)

The app is available for free, with the caveat that the free version is restricted to only access of the 1^st book and the maps. The full version is only $0.99 for now though! In the interest of making this a little more fun and to reward you for reading to the end of the post, ~~I'm going to give away promo codes for the full version of the app to the first twenty-five people who comment and explicitly mention they want a promo code.~~ All out, sorry!

Happy reading!

I don't even really care if a prequel season is likely or even being remotely taken seriously as a possibility, I just like thinking about the possibilities. I tried to keep it realistic in terms of possibility, so I steered clear of mega-stars (I hate when these things end up like ""Brad Pitt, Tom Hardy, Christian Bale, etc.) I know some of these have already been cast for the upcoming flashbacks, so this is all purely hypothetical for a prequel season.

So Jon Snow is dead! The brothers of the nights watch will perform the funeral rights as they have with all the other brothers that have died and burn Jon Snow on the funeral pyre. The funeral will have a eulogy of sorts consisting of those who didn't want him dead and will finish with ""and now his watch has ended"". As the fire dies down, just as the Daenerys did from Khal Drogo's funeral pyre, Jon Stark will walk from the flames reborn. I believe this ties up the various plot points set in motion, it will confirm that he is Targaryen blood (child of R + L, although i don't know when they will show that in the show) it allows him to be prophet, the Prince that was promised, ""reborn amid salt and smoke"", he is the prince of R, he is the promise from Ned to Lyanna it frees him form the nights watch because ""now his watch has ended""

The only question I have is will his rebirth bring the ice dragon to life!

Anyway the quote goes comes when Melisandre describes visions she has seen. The quote goes ""I ask R'hllor to show me Azor Ahai, instead he shows me only Snow."" I know you may assume the word 'Snow' might make you believe she is being teased that the bastard Snow is Azor Ahai. However there is a much more obvious part of this quote that you may find yourself overlooking. The word Snow is written with a capital 'S'. Obvious grammar knowledge tells that this means the word Snow is a name not the element snow. Therefore meaning the vision she gets does actually show her that Jon is Azor Ahai.

You see, although I enjoyed the show, I enjoyed the books much more. And a lot of people kept telling me to watch the show first, otherwise I wouldn't enjoy it. I refused to listen to them for the first few seasons/books, because I like envisioning it first, and then comparing it to the show. But after hearing so many people tell me this, I decided to try this with the last half of Season 4 and Season 5. So I finished the entire show. I just finished AFFC and will be starting ADWD today.

But I'm so disappointed in Season 5, I honestly don't even know if I want to watch Season 6. They changed so many things, and I haven't even started ADWD. Not only did they change things, but Season 5 was boring as hell. The last episode was great, don't get me wrong, but there were times I wanted to fall asleep.

Sure, I was upset too, but when you think beyond the ""FUCK THIS SHIT/THIS GUY/OLLY"" posts, it makes sense if you look at it how the other Night's Watch members did. 

The White Walkers haven't been seen in 8000 years. They are considered to be a myth at best, a fairy tale at worst. Even the Watch believes this - for the last 8000 years they've been fighting Wildlings - the same people that their Lord Commander now wants to help. No matter what reason he gives, it's a pretty damn shocking thing if you're a black brother. Fighting the Wildlings, who've killed hundreds, if not thousands of your comrades in arms only to be told ""oh we gotta work together because I saw those myths in hardhome"" isn't really the best excuse to give. 

The only people who've seen a White Walker are the Wildlings who survived Hardhome, who no one is going to believe, Edd, who seems to pull a Houdini and vanishes after Hardhome, Sam, who goes off to become a maester, and Jon Snow. 

Remember that when Sam killed the Walker that wanted Gilly's baby, no one believed him - they all made fun of him for even bringing that up. 

So for people to say that the Watch are idiots for not ""putting aside their hatred"" to fight the Walkers are wrong in the sense that for the last eight thousand years, there's been no ""greater enemy"" for them to fight - it's always been the Wildlings. Always. 

As an aside I still don't get the Olly hate circlejerk. Here's a kid who lost his entire family to the Wildlings, who watched as his parents were fucking cannibalized, and now Jon Snow wants him to play nice with those same people? Recipe for disaster there. ",14,8,False,self,,,,,

Think about it,:

To the Valyrians, Dragons were like what cars are to us. So, the richer you are, the better your dragons will be. Faster, bigger, more powerful. Now the Targaryens, being a lesser house, obviously won't have the best dragons. Which implies that Balerion, Vhagar &amp; Meraxes were average dragons most probably.

The ASoIF world hasn't seen nor heard nor read of dragons larger than Balerion/Vhagar. All the dragons in recorded history are descended from the first 4/5 (I don't know how many exactly).

So, were there dragons in Valyria known to be larger/more powerful than Targaryen dragons? And if so, could Drogon, Rhaegon &amp; Visarion be one of their descendants?",28,43,False,self,,,,,

What says Game of Thrones more than poignant romance? 

The challenge: **Create a GoT-themed Valentine's card** (yep, a **physical** one). Whether you go for stylish, funny, or touching is up to you - all stand an equal chance of winning.

It's a pretty informal competition, meant to be a bit of fun, but there's a few rules.

1. TV spoilers are fine, book spoilers are not (i.e. stuff not covered by the show).
2. It has to be a physical card. Take a picture and submit it [on the other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/44svup/).
3. They're Valentine's cards, but be reasonable with the sexual explicitness.
4. **We'll lock the thread at the beginning of Valentine's Day (GMT)** (11:59pm GMT on Saturday), and the mods will vote on a winner.  

----

**Prizes**  
1st place wins 8 months of Reddit Gold  
2nd place wins 4 months of Reddit Gold

The winner also receives the adoration of [this cute puppy](http://i.imgur.com/7btGhDm.jpg).

Good luck!

And i have some ''proof'' about this theory aswell

He never drinks wine, he has been offered wine 3 times and whenever someone offers him vine he kindly refuses.Vampire tends to never drink anything expect for the blood from their enemies. Which is what Roose does when he is finished flaying them.

We have never seen Roose or Ramsay move in the sunlight. Whenever they are out strolling they always move when it's cloudy or pitchblack. A common thing for a vampire since the sun burns their skins and reveal what they truly are. Ramsay's skin is also a proof of this. He is so pale that it seems he has never been outside when it's sunny. Since Ramsay is only half-vampire and half human he can drink wine and eat food like a normal human being.

In the books we can read that Roose and his men also sometimes use the torture technique impale to impale their enemies from rectum to the mouth with a sharp spear. This was also famously done by the real life Vlad III Dracula in 1300's. Which is why he got the title Dracula the impaler.

Roose is waging a multi-generational war against the Starks and their werewolf-ish powers. His penchant for leeching could even be explained by his clandestine vampirism, as the living dead tend to have poor circulation and this would prevent blood from pooling in his hands, feet, and groin drapes.

Keep in mind -- the Game of Thrones universe has already established that cured skin can be used to magically take on the appearance of another person. Add to that the fact that Roose is described almost as if he's wearing a mask -- ""Only his eyes moved; they were very pale, the color of dirty ice."" -- and it all starts to add up to him being a vampire.

Plus, there's little mention of Roose's ancestors in the books, which is unusual considering the fact that each volume contains a 100-page appendix laboriously detailing the family trees of each of the named houses of Westeros. Maybe Roose's only has one branch because he's been tooling around the five kingdoms for centuries. It sure would explain why he keeps his psychotic son Ramsay around.

Where as in the show she is shown to be actually in love with Tyrion which i strongly disbelieve

Now everything i am going to write is just my theory and can be complete bullshit

IMO Shae was Twyin's whore,now i know Tywin has a strong dislike for whore but what was he doing with her in the end of Season 4,they were having sex ofcourse

He needed someone to know what Tyrion is doing while acting as Hand of the King and after and when time comes use it against him

He even tells Tyrion not to take that whore to King's Landing knowing that Tyrion always likes to do what he is not supposed to do.

A strong evidence of Shae acting to be in love with Tyrion comes in Season 3 when Tyrion gives her golden chains but she refuses to take them but in the finale of Season 4 she is seen to be wearing the same chains surely Tywin can give him all the chains she wants why would she wear the one's that the person she hates gave her.

The theory should not be viewed as authoritative, but is instead based on my literary readings of the book and watching the series on HBO. 




**__My theory is that Rickon Stark will return to the series not as a boy but as a Scourge against everyone who betrayed the Starks. The Boltons, the Frey's and the lands of the South. He will also be the one to lead the people of the North away from and against the Others. __**




First, a quick refresher.




1. Rickon is the youngest legitimate child of Eddard Stark, and with the death of Robb and Bran passing north of wall presumably to become a Green Walker (Old God), Rickon is the last legitimate heir to Winterfell and the North. 


2. The last time we saw Rickon was in Season 3 after Jon Snow gets into it with the Wildlings and betrays Ygritte. Bran tells Rickon to go with Osha to Last Hearth, the seat of the Umbers, loyal bannermen of the Starks.




Firstly the legitimacy issue. There has been theories that Jon Snow could claim winterfell, and that he may be absolved from his Night Watch oaths by the events at the end of Season 5. I'll just go ahead and dismiss this now. The only way that Jon Snow could claim winterfell is over Rickon's dead body (literally) as no matter what Jon's parentage is, he could never be the legitimate Lord of Winterfell while Rickon lived.




The Second Point goes towards the overarching theme that I see in the series, which is the power (both creative, and destructive) that desire has. Desire for power grants people it in Westeros, and that same desire ultimately destroys them. This is a recurring theme. Danaerys desires the Iron Throne, but she can never claim so long as her desire to free the slaves keeps her trapped in the east. Arya desires to become a faceless assassin, but the only way that can happen is if she abandons her desire to kill for her own ends rather the God of Deaths. It leaves her trapped and blinded for a time. Lord Varys is such a dangerous character to scheming lords because his only desire is to protect the realm. There is a very telling scene when he is recruiting Ros, and Ros tries to manipulate him and finds him castrated. ""Is what you find there so terrifying?"" It is. Its what makes Varys so dangerous. His absolute lack of Desire for anything but the Realms well being.     




If desire is such a powerful force in the series, what then would an orphaned Stark whose family and birthright have been cruelly stolen from him desire? I would argue that his desire would be to take back what little remains of his family and avenge himself upon those who betrayed him and his. Starting with the Boltons, who are holding the last known living Stark, Sansa, prisoner at the Castle that legitimately belongs to Rickon.     




At this point you all are probably thinking, but wait, Rickon is a boy, how will he be able to do any of this? I would argue, firstly, that in the Game of Thrones universe age is very rarely a limiting factor. Arya is only a year and some change older then Rickon and she's on her way to becoming a murder fairy. Time is also fluid, because they don't have the same 4 seasonal cycle in this universe we do, and aging seems to progress at paces faster then we may think plot wise, simply because we've not gone fully from summer to winter yet. But remember, Summers can last for years in this world. I would argue that at the point of his reentry, Rickon would have gotten big enough to carry arms.    
 



Furthermore, tutelage under Osha, the Brutal realities of his new life in exile and possibly some influence by the Old Gods will have seriously hardened him.  Remember, in the Books Jojen Reed foretold ""The Wolves will return"". This was a vision from the Old Gods, so there is divine intervention at work for the Starks, and rickon specifically as he was in the Crypts before Brann showed up following Eddard's execution. He is also arguably the last Stark since Arya is on the verge of forsaking the Old Gods and her birthright, and Sansa is married to Ramsay, and though it was unwilling she did say the oath. Also remember that in the scene where we last see Rickon, Osha tells him that ""The Umbers are Great Warriors, they'll teach you how to swing a sword"". to which Rickon retorts ""I know how to swing a sword.""    
    

Having read all this, re-watch the scene from S3 EP9    
    

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVlRkEqI2T0    
    

&gt;Rickon affirms his great desire to protect his family

&gt;Osha calls him ""little soldier""

&gt;Bran proclaims him the Heir to Winterfell

&gt;As they leave, Osha says that Rickon ""Will learn to walk in darkness""    
    

Okay, all well and good. But where will Rickon get the power to challenge the Boltons, and the Southern Lords? Three places definitely. First, the Umbers where he is seeking shelter. Secondly, the Karstarks. Remember that the Karstarks were not present for the Red Wedding massacre. Their banners headed north after Robb executed Lord Karstark. They are unscathed, though Rickon will have to promise them an ocean of southern blood to get them to his side. I think after all that has happened Rickon will have no problems promising this. By now he won't have Robb's hang ups about scourging the Southlands. The Third source would be the agitating Northern Nobles that Ramsay is royally pissing off with his antics. There is also a potential chance that he could get the Wildlings too due to Osha's educating him and his time (according to the books) spent among Cannibals. That right there is a powerful Army, one that, depending on how things go at the Wall with the Army of the Dead, may be forced by necessity to move south. Rickon won't do this however, until Sansa is safe. Because she's his Sister. Watch out Ramsay.     
    

The final piece of this puzzle I will lay down is what got me thinking about Rickon in the first place. The Direwolves. The use of Omens in the series are hugely relevant. The Direwolf Puppies being found after their mother died in battle with a Stag. Us meeting Tywin Lannister first as he is field dressing a dead stag. The bastard Jon Snow getting the one White Direwolf. Indeed, everyone in the books and the series just can't help but point out that Jon Snow's Warg is the odd one out. Being so white and different. 



But its not the only odd one out. All the Stark Direwolves are grey and tan furred like normal wolves. Except for TWO. Jon Snow the Bastard gets a white one.     
    

Rickon Stark got a Black Direwolf. The ONLY Black Direwolf. The  color Black has massive significance in the series. It is the color of the true Warrior. Like The ""Black"" fish, and current heir to the Riverlands. Castle ""Black"", the seat of the Nights Watch. Black is also the color of the long dark. ""He will learn to walk in Darkness.""     
    

As for Rickon's ultimate fate, desire is everything. His desire to avenge himself and his family will bring him to unleash a terrible vengeance on the South. Under a new Stark Banner, a Black Wolfs Head, Rickon will start killing alot of people we wished had died already. Like Lord Frey. Ultimately however the true enemy is the Others and their Army of the Dead. He must be willing to give up his desire for vengeance and turn his banners against the true threat to the realm. If he does that, he may even be one of the three dragon riders due to his implied latent Warging abilities when he ran into Bran in the Crypts of Winterfell following his first vision.

We should all know about the R+L=J theory by now. And we should all be hoping that Melisandre will resurrect Jon Snow, but for this she needs the sacrifice of a King. Now I as a show watcher will of course be leaning further towards what happened in the show rather than thinking about the books. In the how, Shireen is dead. Burnt to a crisp by none other than Lady Melisandre. Does she still have power from this sacrifice. Possibly, but I will be suggesting something else. If R+L=J is indeed true then Melisandre has another king at the Wall from which she will gain power. If you couldn't figure it out yourself, it's Jon, who is the rightful heir to the throne with Daenarys. The Nights Watch will attempt to burn Jon Snows body, but as has been stated by Daenarys,
He is no dragon, fire cannot hurt a dragon.
Well who is a dragon? Well according to the well supported R+L=J theory, Jon is. Melisandre notices that Jon's body stays unaffected by the flames and knows what this means. Her visions which she had in the books about Azor Ahai will lead her to resurrect Lord Snow with the power that she has gained from Jon. Yes, this seems repetitive, but I have found things which have not yet been discovered.
Azor Ahai was the leader of men in the fight against the Others. He wielded the mighty Lightbringer, a sword capable f killing White Walkers. Jon has a sword of Valyrian steel which would undoubtedly be burnt with him, giving it the flame of Lightbringer. He is Azor Ahai. He will be the King of the Andals.",68,40,False,self,,,,,

His plan succeedes and he sends Pycelle to the black cells.

From the books it is said that Craster was born from a Night's Watch ranger who took a wildling woman when he was off ranging beyond The Wall. When she gave birth to Craster, she attempted to go to The Wall in search of the father, but was chased off by the Night's Watch.

In ASOIAF, it is often said that Starks have manned The Wall for thousands of years. Could Craster's father have been of Stark blood, making Craster a Stark bastard?

If so, this has intriguing implications as to the *gifts* he makes for the Others and why he only sleeps with his daughters. Perverse reasons aside, perhaps it's more to do with keeping at least half of the blood within his sons, to be of 'Stark' origin. Birthing sons with other women would dilute his half-Stark bloodline and not *work* or be accepted as a suitable offering.

Do you think that the Others could be the result of a Stark bloodline? Perhaps the Others *are* Starks? Starks of old.

Consider this quote:

&gt; ""Craster's **more your kind than ours**. His **father was a crow** who stole a woman out of Whitetree village, but after he had her he flew back t' his Wall. She went t' Castle Black once t' show the crow his son, but the brothers blew their horns and run her off. **Craster's blood is black**, and he bears a heavy curse."" - Ygritte, ASOS Jon III

Before you blow this off as some crazy theory, consider one final point; the whereabouts of Benjen Stark. As far as I'm aware, most of his men he went ranging with were found to be dead, but himself never found. Perhaps the Others got to him first and have somehow acquired him / his blood to join them - willingly or otherwise.

What do you think? 

EDIT: Since saying this, I've had a Google and seen some similar ideas about it.

Youll likely pair the song with the Starks eradication, which is certainly a valid association. Lets not forget its original purpose. Its a [reminder of what happens to those who cross House Lannister] (https://youtu.be/iQ2QP4hfs5s), a cautionary tale of sorts.  But much more than that, Ramin Djawadis craftsmanship is apparent in the many variations of the song, which follow the growth, rise and fall of House Lannister itself. 

&amp;nbsp;




Pre-Red Wedding, the song is used to signal the glory and victory of House Lannister. In season 2, we get our first exposure, as [Tyrion, free of worries, whistles the tune on his way to the Small Council meeting] (https://youtu.be/UiyCg10k2mk?t=95), much to Cerseis chagrin. Its a gentle nudge, to get the audience to begin associating the song with House Lannister through Tyrion.  

&amp;nbsp;



In Blackwater we get our first lyrical taste of the song, as [Bronn and Lannister soldiers drunkenly toast House Lannister on the eve of battle] (https://youtu.be/JDl-H8wNJ18) against Stannis Baratheons forces. Here, again, the song serves as a gentle nudge, as its a lively and warm contribution to the world-building of Westeros, with a slight imminent death undertone. The soldiers are seemingly reassuring themselves of their own safety, owing to the legendary status of the House they represent. Bronns (Jerome Flynn) voice elevates the harmony to the point of near comfort. You can almost taste the ale. However, in [the end credits of Blackwater] (https://youtu.be/fhXS7yIwf6U), the song returns to herald the return of the legend himself, Tywin Lannister, to Kings Landing and to highlight his victory over Stannis. This version is serious, foreboding and lacks any whimsy found in previous versions. Its a statement  Tywin Lannister, the man whose very actions inspired the song itself, has returned. Its a sign of more Lannister victory to come.  


&amp;nbsp;


Season 3s versions of the song seem to focus largely on the fall of House Stark. [Thoros of Myr gives his whimsical, typically drunk rendition] (https://youtu.be/HoeaxuFvBc8), but were not explicitly reminded of the song until were told of its history and implications in Second Sons. Cerseis story to Margaery of course serves as an insightful misdirection, as Cersei implies that House Tyrell is potentially the target of eventual Lannister wrath. In Rains of Castamere (3.9) were absolutely floored with the outcome: total, ruthless annihilation and complete, absolute Lannister victory over the Starks. Djawadis [A Lannister Always Pays His Debts] (https://youtu.be/jERdloSRJEw) agonizingly and beautifully blends Stark tragedy with Lannister victory.



&amp;nbsp;


Even in Post-Red Wedding episodes, the song continues to evolve. In season 4, we open with the [melting of Ice] (https://youtu.be/CSY7043i3a0), serving as a bitter reminder of previous seasons casualties. The Two Swords theme is part Stark, part Lannister. The Stark theme precedes the breakdown of the Stark ancestral blade, Ice. However, as Tywin emerges from the darkness in observance during the blade's reforging, the familiar tune emerges. Two Swords as a song and episode signifies the turning point for the Lannisters. Now that theyre no longer at war with the Starks, who is next? 


&amp;nbsp;



Of course, Oberyn Martell  [answers this question resoundingly] (https://youtu.be/mDvinF3eGQw), as he appears to completely loathe the song and the family. The drunkenness apparent in the Lannister soldiers tune reeks with complacency, which both the audience and Oberyn can sense. Indeed, the complacency is [readily apparent in King Joffreys antics](https://youtu.be/L4q6PyoW5JU), right up to his much welcomed death. Sigur Ros rendition of the song, [in the final credits] (https://youtu.be/w3QW8PVyyNM), is the first time the song is employed to showcase something other than Lannister victory  its a harbinger of the familys fall. With Joffrey murdered, Tyrion arrested, Cersei in grief, Tywin is completely shocked to discover the boldness of his obscured foes. 


&amp;nbsp;


   
The resulting turmoil in the House stems from its collapse upon itself. Tyrion is blamed and nearly everybody is completely clueless about the actual perpetrators. There are hints of the theme in the beginning of [Tyrions confession] (https://youtu.be/e4Uq8O5ZhUA?t=52 ), which serve as a build up to Tyrion and Tywins palpable stare down at the episodes end. In The Children we see Tyrion and Tywins final confrontation. Djawadis [You Are No Son of Mine] (https://youtu.be/_SmxvNP58BU?t=341) follows Tyrion, as he puts down the crossbow, walks away from his fathers quarreled, lifeless corpse and begins his path unto self-loathing and rediscovery.  


&amp;nbsp;



What follows in season 5 is Tywins evaporating legacy left to the unsteady hands of his children, [who are taken aback by the void left by their fathers death and its implications for their family] (https://youtu.be/kUyvoXPcRWE?list=PLpkgFfvB9Bu1jo0q-vlVypgHji2RTW8cR&amp;t=70). Note that the theme contrasts in context with Season 4s, which opened similarly. Whereas in Season 4, the theme reminded audiences about Tywins ferocity, authority, and ruthlessness, Season 5s reminds audiences of Tywins ultimate failure to cement the legacy of his House. Slain by his own dwarf son, survived by his two incestuous children, Hand to two Mad kings, Tywin's death brought a shroud of doubt over his legacy and that of House Lannister.

&amp;nbsp;



Eventually, in Season 5, Cersei tries to carry her fathers legacy on her bare back. Failing miserably, much to her shame, Cersei finds herself struggling to wear the Lion furs her father had shrugged off. Shes shaven, and ultimately, degraded in Mothers Mercy, to Djawadis [Atonement] (https://youtu.be/3ufP2IEKayM?t=289), which serves as an agonizing reminder of House Lannisters descent - from the majestic seaside keep of Casterly Rock to the fanatical squalor of Flea Bottom. The Lion's daughter atoned for her sins, so what lies next in season 6 for House Lannister? 


&amp;nbsp;



**TLDR**:  By the end of Season 5, The Rains of Castamere is no longer just a Lannister victory song, or a foreshadowing of Stark defeat  its a complex and growing theme that gradually evolves with, and mirrors the developments of, House Lannister itself.  Its also often used as a tool to engage the audience with the narrative, particularly the Red Wedding and beyond. Were left wondering how much further House Lannister will fall before it faces the same fate as the Reynes of Castamere and were excited for more brilliant compositions from Ramin Djawadi.

The theory is that Dany will reach Westeros by going east, not west. 
The evidence of this is Quaith saying that Dany must go east to go to west. I suspect that beyond the shadow land and the ghost grass lies the land of always winter. 
The evidence for this is the story of the long night. In Assai, there's the legend of the Azor Ahai who defeated the Others, and in the North, there's the legend of the Last Hero that defeated the Others. These events happened at the same time. However, there is no legend or mention of the Others in the central part of essos, in Valeria or in Vas Dothrak. I think that during the Long night, the Others tried to expand their territory, and that their territory lies just outside of the Land of Always Winter and the Shadow land. They're connected. 

We always see the map of Westeros and Essos as they lay straight with Dorne and Valeryia at the south and North at north, But I think this is out misconception. Southeast of the map connect to the northwest. 

So Dany will get her new dothraki army ""to go forward you must go back"" and ride to the shadow land, where she'll find the secrets of the Others and go past the land of always winter, arriving to save Westeros from the north of the wall, sandwiching the Others army in between Dany and Jon. 

Otherwise nothing explains why it's taking so long for Dany to go to westeros after FIVE seasons!!!FIVE!!",13,17,False,self,,,,,

At around the 22 minute mark, she clearly says:

""When ***this castle*** was under siege and I was starving, Stannis boiled soup for me from books.""

However, the subtitles read:

""""When ***Storm's End*** was under siege and I was starving, Stannis boiled soup for me from books.""

[image: http://i.imgur.com/U5JvlhY.png]

The subtitles are, of course, the correct version in terms of the story (in the scene here they are eating at Dragonstone, but the siege she is referring to was during Robert's Rebeliion and occurred at Storm's End).

Obviously, the script on set was incorrect (or the actress misremembered her lines), and this was only noticed later in post-production, and since they couldn't re-shoot, someone thought, ""Well, at least we can fix the subtitles."" 

I just thought that was very interesting for some reason.  I wonder if there are other examples of this happening- has anyone else noticed anything along those lines (subtitles not matching speech), in GoT or other programs or movies?

Even though I'm not hard of hearing, I usually always watch movies and shows with subtitles on.  I notice differences between spoken dialogue and subtitles often, but usually it's just typos, or clearly some speech-recognition software fail, or the subtitles being truncated or abridged because the actor is speaking faster than someone might typically be able to read.

But I've never seen subtitles used to fix an actual mispoken or mis-written line.",9,7,False,self,,,,,

If not, I apologize in advance.  I also posted in r/gamesofthrones 

There is currently a game on Kickstarter called **Council of Blackthorn** that was inspired by AGOT.  The designer, Jay, was trying to work on a game that modeled the interconnected nature of the different political factions in a kingdom.  A quote from him:

&gt; The idea for Council of Blackthorn popped into my head while I was watching an episode of Game of Thrones. There is always so much focus in stories and games around the king or about becoming the king. 

&gt;I felt that the more interesting story thread was about the members of the small council. The kings council have to develop a secret intertwined web of allies and influence to be useful to the king, however, the more powerful they get, the more threatening to the king they become.

&gt;I wanted to capture the non-linear subversive nature of intertwined alliances and influence while creating a stressful sub strategy of trying to stay alive by not getting beheaded by a mistrusting king. I think that Council of Blackthorn captures that environment.

I've played the game a bunch of times and had a really great time with it.  The game has also been praised by Father Geek earning his Seal of Approval.

I will have ""Game of Thrones"" in one corner, in the title font, and I want a quote and artwork to be placed on the panel as well. The panel size will be dependent on what I decide to put on it, but I'm thinking probably 3'x5'. 

I want the quote and artwork to be somewhat related if possible, unless the artwork is ""neutral"" and not specific to any certain house/event (the iron throne, for example). As for the artwork, I'd like it to be something that is more elaborate and significant than just a map, but there are obviously some restrictions in the nature of a cutout design. I will put an acrylic panel on the back of the cutout, so I will be able to add some ""floating"" sections if needed, but I'd like to make it mostly a continuous profile. Currently, I'm leaning towards using ""A lion does not concern himself with the opinions of sheep"", but I'm open to other suggestions, and I'm not sure what artwork to use yet either. A negative, ""silhouette"" style subject would be ideal for this application.

In my own game I went with Asher. And I know this is probably some time ago for most of you but if you let Rodrik live, you get the option to ambush the camp. Now when you return, Ludd and part of his army are **inside the stronghold** already. 

How did that even happen? 

I mean, in Asher's storyline it makes sense. You decided to let them into your castle and when hell inevitably breaks loose they are still within your walls. But with Rodrik you never invite them inside, they **have** to break the gate to get inside. Am I missing something here?

Obviously this isn't majorly important information, it would just be nice to know how old the Stark kids are since all the shit started hitting the fan. Also am interested in how long the Lannisters have been in power and been in cahoots with the Boltons.

My current guesses for Stark kids ages are:

Sansa - 16
Arya - 14
Bran - 13
Rickon - 10 (I honestly cannot remember even vaguely how old he was in season 1, judging children's ages by their appearance is not a talent I possess.)

Bonus: Jon - 19

If anyone has solid evidence of the show's timeline or of any characters' age changes, I would like to know!

I'm of the opinion that the Tarly brothers story will be somewhat similar, but the other way around.

Both brothers disliked each other due to their differences but soon will start to care for and even admire each other. Dickon is the perfect son, the worthy successor of Randyll Tarly, while Samwell is an obese (ex)coward who prefers reading to fighting (all while being the heir of a House known for excellent &amp; smart warriors). It isn't too unlikely that there was friction among the two.

But now Sam is a changed man. He killed a White Walker (&amp; a Thenn), and the treacherous murder of his best friend by his very own sworn brothers will leave Sam as a hardened sceptic. Perhaps Dickon will come to respect this changed man and maybe even Randyll Tarly will.

Or maybe Sam will shove a sword through Randyll Tarly's heart.",3,2,False,self,,,,,

One note that the book briefly accounts is how he actually attended Tywin's marriage and took the wife's virginity before Tywin.
So about 6 months after reading this I was just sat thinking about Game of Thrones and it HIT ME.
I know why Tyrion is hated so much by his Father. 
Contrasting from popular belief, I think that Tyrion is in fact a Lannister born and bred, but I think he is the only one. 
Yes that's right, I believe it is in fact the Lannister twins, Jamie and Cersei, who were the spawn of King Aerys making them only half Lannister.
If this is the case, which I'm 100% sure it is, this means that Tyrion is the the only legitimately conceived Lannister of that family. This meant that Tywin knew his sperm created a ugly stunted dwarf, which also killed his wife! 
Can you feel that hate yet?
What's more, the twins have many Targaryen traits, such as the obvious incest relationship and also Cersei and Joffrey have definitely shown traits of the Mad King in the brutal ruling of the kingdom!

He would play the players to his advantage however best he can, and start figuring out who he can and can't trust.

There's some deeper speculation at the bottom of this post. Nothing serious, but I want to spark some discussion about Tommen's upcoming plot. Jon and Dany and Bran and Sansa have had their turns; I haven't seen any Tommen yet.

I was going to come up with a witty pun of the title Viva La Vida to fit this, but I think I'll just call this one...

""R.I.P. Tommen""

**Verse 1**

I thought I ruled the realms

My queen would have sex when I wanted some

Now they hold me in the lonely Red Keep

As I think how to save Margaery

[Instrumental]

I remember watching Joff

All the fear in his eyes as he coughed

I listened as the guests would sing

""Now the old king is dead,"" and ""Fuck the king!""

Next moment I was made a king

Now my council puppeteers me

I was a fool but now I understand

I don't hold any true power in my hands

**Chorus**

I hear Faith Militant bells a-shaming

Smallfolk, knights, lords and squires complaining:

""Give us food to survive winter's steel;

All the crops we had, you turned into burned fields!""

My council won't let me fix this

But I realize if I had

Clever lies to tell them

That'd be when I'd save the realm

**Verse 2**

It was a frigid and icy wind

That made the suffering begin

Shattering hopes and the screams concur: 

People couldn't believe how fucked they were

The revolting people wait

For some food on their empty plates

But I'm just a puppet on a lonely string

Oh, can I even do anything?

**Chorus 2**

I hear Faith Militant bells a-shaming

Smallfolk, knights, lords and squires complaining:

""Give us food to survive winter's steel;

All the crops we had, you turned into burned fields!""

My council won't let me fix this

I wish Lord Petyr would teach me his

Clever lies to tell them

That'd be when I'd save the realm

Oh oh oh oh ohh oh [x5]

[Repeat Chorus 2]

So yeah. King's Landing would be starving and angry at the Lannisters for being the side of the war that burned nearly all the crops in the Riverlands, causing a huge inbalance.

The line ""I wish Lord Petyr would teach me his / Clever lies to tell them"" is there because I think there's a chance he could find some trace of Littlefinger's actions surrounding Joffrey's death. He would think that Littlefinger is for the realm (because who doesn't think Joffrey's death was a good thing) and thus seek out Petyr's council, thinking he's a benevolent puppeteer.

Then, if [ADWD spoiler](#b ""Varys kills Kevan on the show as he did in ADWD"") and Tommen finds out (which Petyr would make sure of), he would think Varys is working against the Lannisters and the realm. So he would play the moves of Varys (and everyone else on the small council) against them using Petyr's wisdom, while aiding Petyr's moves; unknowingly working against Varys' plot to secure peace and working for Petyr's plot to create chaos.

I think that his kindness and his puppeteering of events that would aid the people would somehow be the Lannister's weak spot for the Faith Militant and their ultimate downfall, though. Plus, if he saves Margaery, that's another active card the Tyrells can play against the Lannisters. So his kindness would save his people and his queen, who would in turn overthrow the Lannisters (Tommen included, since everyone knows he's a Lannister bastard).

Before that, however, Margaery would convince the Tyrells not to do anything against Tommen, as Cersei is the only Lannister to blame for arming the Faith Militant and working against Margaery and Loras. As Cersei works against the smallfolk of King's Landing and Faith Militant, the Tyrells would work against Cersei but keep their alliance with Tommen, who would help them to bring Cersei out of power (he would want to prevent her from puppeteering him and working against Margaery any further, allowing Margaery more control over him). Petyr would somehow make sure that the Tyrells stay aligned with Tommen, and that they get dragged down and into the smallfolk revolution as well, which is why Varys wanted to put a wedge in the alliance (at least in the books; idk if he's done anything in the show yet). Then down goes the majority of House Tyrell's power, and Petyr would be that much closer to ruling the realm. The Tyrells' involvement would destroy the chance of the smallfolk getting any crops from Highgarden (unless enough survive, and they spread the revolution and flock in The Reach), but they would continue to feed House Baratheon of King's Landing, creating another reason for the smallfolk to be angry at the Houses.

Of course, this is all just wild speculation based on this modified song, but I do see the series possibly going in this general direction. Let me know your ideas on Tommen's upcoming plot. Also, do the Lannisters have some kind of food supply hidden somewhere, or are they also relying on the Tyrells' croplands?

**tl;dr: Tommen's kindhearted nature and attempts at playing the game to save his people and queen will be the downfall of the Lannisters and Tyrells, as well as the smallfolk due to a withdrawal of food supplies from House Tyrell.**

**still tl;dr: Everyone in the capital is fucked.**

And thus begins the series of the bittersweet ending of the series.",3,0,False,self,,,,,

It is said that white walkers can only killed by dragon glass, and then we learn that Valerian steel can too- I believe both have to do with being forged by fire (I assume that Valerian steel has some fire-related component that regular steel doesn't). Forgive my ignorance, but I assume that regular ol fire works too, given the fact that they burn bodies to prevent them from coming back. 

What about all those running skeletons?  I noticed people aiming for headshots- and it seemed that lopping off heads was stopping them- but then when they were throwing themselves off the cliff, they picked themselves right back up and kept at it. Or did they go at it as long as their head was in tact?

So what are the rules in killing them all?  What determines who is a walker and who is a skeleton?

Also- does reanimation only occur when it's winter on Westeros?  Hence, when it's so cold in Winterfell, the dead get reanimated, and the further south the cold goes the reanimation follows?

**What is it?**  
[An API of Ice And Fire](https://anapioficeandfire.com) is an [open source](https://github.com/joakimskoog/AnApiOfIceAndFire) REST'ish API for quantified and structured data from the universe of Ice and Fire (as well as the HBO-series Game of Thrones). You can get access to structured data about most books, all characters and houses. Maybe you want to know which characters have POV chapters in the book A Game of Thrones or maybe you want to know which members are sworn to House Targaryen? This API has all data that you would ever need! 


&amp;nbsp;

**Why?**  
As I describe [here](https://anapioficeandfire.com/About), I love everything about the A Song of Ice And Fire series and I frequently lurk in several subreddits. I also wanted to give something back to the community with hopes that people will find this useful.

One of those heads belonged to George W. Bush, which was apparently an accident. This caused a big controversy, bla bla, apologies were made, and everyone eventually forgot about it (apart from every ""TOP 10 FACTS ABOUT GAME OF THRONES"" ever).

So, In Season 3 episode 10, Tyrion threatens Joffrey at the small council, after learning of the Stark's defeat at the Twins. Grand Maester Pycelle goes on to say: *""Lord Tyrion should apologize immediately.* ***Unacceptable, disrespectful and in very bad taste.****""*

 I always found this line to be somewhat amusing, until I very recently found out that that was actually what HBO had to say about the George W Bush thing in Season 1. I quote: 

&gt;*""We were deeply dismayed to see this and find it* ***unacceptable, disrespectful and in very bad taste.*** *We made this clear to the executive producers of the series who apologized immediately for this inadvertent, careless mistake. We are sorry this happened and will have it removed from any future DVD production.""* --A press release made by HBO, apologizing profusely when they learned that the Season 1 finale of Game of Thrones inadvertently included a shot of a prop head of President George W. Bush impaled on a spike.

I just friggin love how exactly two seasons later, after a similar event (Major character dies a shocking death one episode prior), they actually threw in a line referencing that controversy.",39,690,False,self,,,,,

Do we think we're going to see a significant size increase and will Daenerys (presuming everything is okay) want to wait until he is bigger - and less of a lil' bitch - to attempt to retake Westeros? It would be great if we were to see Drogon this big (obviously not quite as big considering Balerion was 200 years old) but still, Barristan even says ""A dragon never stops growing, Your Grace, so long as he has food and freedom.""

Warning: I am using references from both the show and the book. Currently, I am reading book one, have watched the entire series.

I noticed some recurring dreams about the crypts between the Stark family. (In the show) Bran has a dream that Eddard is in the crypts, so he visits them once he awakens. Rickon and Shaggydog are down there as well and says that he also had a dream about their father, without Bran ever mentioning his dream to him. (In the books) Jon tells Sam about a dream he has of the crypts and how he doesn't want to go to them, but he knows he has to. As I haven't gotten very far into the books, I don't know if it ever mentions Arya or Sansa having a dream about them, but I believe I read somewhere (or even watched it on the show) that Eddard has a dream about the crypts as well. 

Honestly, I can't put together a crazy theory as to why that's happening, but I feel that it's very important. The Crypts are important. I read somewhere about a theory of the White Walkers taking Winterfell because the Crypts are magic, or something like that. It was much more majestically worded, but I have a pretty bad memory, and I've learned the consequences as to what happens when you put all of your eggs in one basket, so I won't say that it has to be true.

Just wondering if any of you guys have some cool theories (or just simple reasons) to explain this?",65,98,False,self,,,,,

The face is old, pale, shrunken, and wrinkled with white eyes. The door glows.
When someone approaches the Black Gate, the eyes open. Then the door asks, ""Who are you?"" A man of the Night's Watch must repeat a part of his vow, I am the watcher ... realms of men. The door will open then, saying, Then pass. 

Isn't that proof that magic clearly exists in Westeros? Why many smart characters do not believe in magic (other than dragons)? Tywin straight out denied the possibility of magic at work when Renly got assassinated. Tyrion wasn't much of a believer either. Or at the minimum, they believe magic is long gone. But there's still a talking door! (And Tyrion has been to the wall, i doubt this talking door is being kept as a secret by the Night's watch)",20,13,False,self,,,,,

i've been a firm believer that we will all or a strong majority of the characters die by the end of the story (per the Ragnarok theory). **I feel that the newly released teaser is a future vision by Bran.** I don't think that all of these characters will necessarily die in the next season or book, but I think they will die before the conclusion of the story. Here is my reasoning: 1. Bran can have visions of the past, present, and FUTURE. 2. The weirwood network is a catalyst for visions, and the left door to the the house of black and white just happens to be.... WEIRWOOD. 3. Looking at past season's teasers, I noticed that the show runners use clips of literal things that have occurred, are occurring, or will occur, they do not use the figurative storytelling some are suggesting this teaser to be.",28,0,False,self,,,,,

**Identifying Key Elements:**

The most noticeable thing in this trailer is that it takes place in the House of Black &amp; White. This is where the Faceless Men keep their, well, faces. Presumably only the faces of the dead are kept in this hall, and we don't know how the faces make their way there. It wouldn't be unreasonable to assume some kind of magic is involved, though this has yet to be confirmed or denied.

I think the order in which the faces are shown is fairly significant for a number of reasons. Let's break it down:

* Stark

* Stark

* Tully/Stark

* Lannister

* Lannister/Baratheon

* Baratheon

* Snow/Stark

* Wildling

* Stark/Lannister/Bolton

* Lannister

* Targaryen

* Lannister

* Stark

* Lannister

It's easy to see that we have two major players: The Starks and the Lannisters. When the teaser starts out there is a noticeable focus on the Stark side. As it progresses, things get a little bit muddled up and we start to see more Lannisters, with some others interspersed. It might be worth noting that Sansa is also in some respect a Lannister through marriage to Tyrion, but then again it was never consummated and she was remarried to Ramsay Bolton. This leads me to question if there are meant to be other connection through Daenerys and Arya. I personally couldn't see where Arya comes in, but there is the potential for a link between Tyrion and Daenerys given the theory that Tyrion is a secret Targaryen. It is possible, though unlikely, that this is a link the teaser is trying to hint-at.

Moving forward, one of the most obvious distinctions in the teaser is the dead versus the living. The first four shots all show characters that we're pretty much certain are all dead, except for one. We then hit Jon, who's fate has been debated since the end of the latest book. Following this, all characters that are currently alive. I think it's pretty clear why it was lined-up like this: they want to stir the debate about Jon's life. Is he to be lumped-in with the dead before him, or the living after him? Or is he some sort of fulcrum between the two? Personally, I think that's exactly it. Currently he is dead, which shouldn't surprise anyone, but I and many others are convinced that he will return in some capacity. That would make him both dead and alive during the season. However, this careful placement could also be a red herring, and here's one of the biggest reasons why I think that might be the case:

All of the dead characters say something in the teaser. They each have a line that's been cut out from one of their scenes before death. These ""phrases"" generally encapsulate the biggest aspects of that character. Ned's story was one of honor, Robb's one of war, Catelyn's one about family, Joffrey's about control, and Jon's about defending the realm. The clips were carefully picked as the ones that best represented those characters before they died, and that includes Jon. So that could be a sort of nail in the coffin for Jon, but the particularly insistent like myself might say that they're playing on the technicality that Jon is currently dead, even if that may not continue to be the case. It might also hint that Jon Snow is dead, and he will be somebody else when (if) he returns. Only time will tell for sure.

The last obvious detail is that all these faces are in a place where only the dead should reside, so to speak. Given that we see six definitely living characters, we're clearly being led to wonder if there are implications being made here. The Faceless Men are particularly fond the saying ""Valar Morghulis"" or ""All men must die."" This seems to be the obvious conclusion: all these characters will die, as will everyone else. I've also noticed that Jon's line is the only one to span across two of the shots. That is to say, we begin to hear him say ""The long night is coming,"" while looking at Jon's face, but only when the camera pans to the living characters does he finish with ""and the dead come with it."" The way this is done is very clearly deliberate, but to what end? Talking about the dead just seems to cement the idea that these characters will die, right? But what if it's exactly the opposite? I think they're trying to emphasize that these characters will have significant roles in fighting the dead, and will be the major players that come out of it alive. Perhaps this is wishful thinking, but it would be terrible storytelling to just end with ""And everybody died."" I think we're looking at the six, maybe seven with Jon, ""heroes"" of the realm. 

If there's something I missed, please leave it in the comments! I'm also interested to see everybody else's speculation on these things.",58,61,False,self,,,,,

Imagine having to escape from the white walker and wights army north of the wall the sense of fear would be incredibly potent (unless if you have dragon glass or Valerian steal of course).

All of Westeros would of course be included up from the ""Haunted Forest"" to ""Dorn"" and every island in between with everything replicating the map in it's entirety.

The story line would also be well created and bendable hopefully even more so with Skyrim with more options to save the characters you care for if you manage to save the day under extreme conditions and tasks.

The game would likely start with you choosing an existing character or creating your own one and witnessing a important event such as the beheading of Eddard Stark or something more tranquil depending on the character you have chosen. For example if you picked John Snow you might start the game finding out out your uncle (Benjen Stark) has gone missing and your given a  mission to try and find out what has happened. If you pick Sam you need to start out by trying to survive the training without getting beaten down too badly as you arrive to Castle Black. Of course not every character would have a specific start some would use the same sort of starter missions because of how many there are to choose from.

Some characters should not be playable at all such as Arya Stark as you would not be allowed to die as you are only a child however other important characters such as Sandor and Brienne should be playable. 

Important events could happen within the story such as different armies rallying up and you have the choice to choose a side or go against both of them and maybe even creating your own army if you become wealthy and powerful enough. 

I could imagine myself picking a character such as John Snow or Petyr Baelish (haha) and riding one of khaleesi's dragons taking out White Walkers when they eventually breach the wall in late game.

They would be a great deal of speech in the game especially for talkative characters which allow you to betray and manipulate people like in the show but you can use it for the greater good or for evil.

1. Is it possible that the characters we saw in the House of Black and White will actually end up dying? If not this season maybe by the end of the show? 

2. What if the characters that are missing there are the ones that will die by the end of the season? As far as i know we didnt see Ramsay and Roose and its fair to say they are 2 candidates to die by the end of the season. Maybe the show producers could pull some ""reverse psychology"" type of thing on the viewers!

This are just 2 cheap ideas i have and probably everybody had already i just wanted to know if we can make anything out of them, maybe figure something out.

Thanks for reading and have a nice day!",2,0,False,self,,,,,

I was looking at GRRM's **[1993 draft](http://watchersonthewall.com/george-r-r-martins-original-plan-game-thrones/)** of the layout for what was originally supposed to be only three books, and I couldn't help but notice that all his broad strokes are still on point. *Although some of the more specific storytelling may have strayed, the broad strokes still stand.*

&amp;nbsp;
 
He speaks of of three major conflicts that still hold till this day and seem to be central in ASOIAF. They are:  
1.) Starks vs. Lannisters  
2.) Danny Invading The Seven Kingdoms With a Dorthraki Army (GRRM writes that this is the ""second and greater threat [than the Starks vs. Lannisters]"")  
3.) The Others (GRRM writes that this is ""the greatest danger of all"")  

&amp;nbsp;
 
What is interesting is that these broad strokes for the three conflicts still stand central to the book and show, and they show us where he is going with the story. My focus is on conflicts 2 and 3. Conveniently, the end of season 5 has Dany run into another Dorthraki army. Fits in perfectly with what he wrote in 1993 about conflict 2, which would have Dany invading The Seven Kingdoms fully loaded with dragons and a complete Dorthraki army. Looking at conflict 3, we are told that GRRM planned to ""draw together the characters and plot threads"" to prepare for the final battle with the others, which is another direction he has not strayed from.

&amp;nbsp;
 
On top of these conflicts, GRRM writes about the essentially confirmed theory of R+L=J. He notes, ""Jon's true parentage is finally revealed in the last book."" Considering that in 1993 his plan was to write only three books and now we will have seven it is likely that Jon's parentage will be revealed in either book 6 or 7 (I find it more likely that it will be book/season 6).

&amp;nbsp;
 
The final point I wanted to make is that of the ""[f]ive central characters that will make it through all three volumes."" They are: Tyrion, Dany, Jon, Arya, and Bran. All these central characters are alive and well, just as he planned in 1993. It is my belief that they will remain alive through the end because these characters, along with the three conflicts, were the foundation of his original draft, and as we are about 3/4s done with the story we have seen that these conflicts and characters have stood the test of time.

&amp;nbsp;
 
Some of you are probably sick and tired of this draft, but I find it very useful. Before I start getting attacked about how this or that didn't happen as was written in the draft, I want to point out that I am not focusing on the specifics he was writing about in this draft, I am talking more of the broad strokes he is speaking of. I personally think that this draft should hold great weight when trying to theorize where this is going.

&amp;nbsp;
 
I wanted to see what everyone thinks as to how much weight we should place into this draft considering all the broad strokes still stand. Furthermore, I wanted to see what else you think this draft reveals, and what are its implications on the endgame.

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks for hearing me out.

Especially in the show.


Stark= Ned dead, his father Rodrick too, his sister Lyanna too, his brother Brandon too, his brother Benjen is gone, his wife Catelyn is dead, his son Robb the king in the North is dead, along with his wife Talisa and his child and even his wolf. 
5 children remain but they're all believed dead except for Sansa who is well Sansa Lannister for the South and Sansa Bolton for the North. 
They may get a proper comeback though, it must be season 6 main plot. Right Now, Boltons rule.


Tully=Catelyn is dead, her father too, so as far as I know we have Edmure as a hostage. Poor Brynden Tully will most certainly face a siege by the Freys. For now, the Riverlands are rulled by the Freys. The Boltons/Freys alliance really replaced the Stark/Tully one.


Arryn=Well, Jon Arryn is dead and Lysa is dead, so there is Robin, a retarded child. Basically the power of the Vale belongs to Littlefinger now.


Baratheon: Renly is dead. Stannis is dead with his family and allies.
Robert's name is carried by the current king: Tommen Baratheon who is in fact a Lannister incestuous son. As more and more people know about the incest, Baratheon name is basically gone. Keep rowing Gendry...
 

Tyrell=the brother and the sister (queen) are in jail, I think Loras will die this season as well as Mace and possibly grandma Olenna. Loras' brothers aren't even mentionned in the show. Id say their credibility is gone. Same as Lannisters, their fight brought them down together.


Martells= Well, they may be in the best position right now, they managed to stay out of the conflict until season 4 so the majority of their power is still there. But despite Prince Doran patience they lately took part in the war too. With Quentin dead (not even in the show) and Aryanne not existing in the show, they may end just like the others.


Lannister=Tywin is dead. He was the Lannisters.
Then, what do we have? 3 children. 1 killed his father (and officialy his nephew/king) and is now on the run, the two other are a mad Queen who just lost what she had (political power), and un one-handed kingslayer, who can't inherit lands nor marry, who by the way fucked the said mad queen and got 3 incestuous bastards. The first was mad and is dead, the second was beautiful and is dead, and the third one has the will of a Ronflex in a KFC out of chickens. 
They're being destroyed allong with their Tyrell rivals by the High Sparrow &amp; co, ""&amp; co"" including cousin Lancel, who can't inherit AND fucked the queen too. Poor Kevan despite being the last ""respectable and capable"" Lannister has no heir, and will probably die in the show like in the books. Im having a hard time listing all the reasons this family is fucked. Still, they're my favorite family and I'm sad.


And well, House Targaryen does not even has lands at this point. Maybe Dany could get along with the Martells and take Dragonstone and the stormlands but for now they're not part of the seven kingdoms.


If I were some throne player, I'd ask myself if I'd really want to get those 7 shitdoms right now.
Do you think cousins of cousins and forgotten bastards can carry the greatest names or do you think the ""7 kingdoms"" will belong to other families ?",93,84,False,self,,,,,

In the new teaser, I found Catelyn's [quote](https://youtu.be/OmrA8nOZF2Q?t=39s) to be particularly interesting. It's [her line from S03E09](https://youtu.be/sSiEj1rkJpM?t=1m43s) and it is a particularly vindictive one: ""Show them how it feels to lose what they love.""
I find it interesting because it definitely reflects Lady Stoneheart's revenge obssessed character and I was wondering if this could be a clue from D&amp;D(?).

*Joffrey sadistically killing whores w/ crossbow

Back in S1/AGOT, King Robert had Ned write down his will, stating that Ned would be king until Joffrey became old enough. Instead of using Joffrey's name, Ned wrote down ""Rightful heir."" 

Ned knows Jon's true parentage, and this one is right in our faces. If a certain theory is true, Jon would be the rightful heir to the throne. Lets say that the Lannisters actually honored Roberts will, and declared Ned king. Ned would have reigned, knowing that Jon was next in succession. 

EDIT: We are led to believe Stannis is this ""rightful heir,"" which I have discussed my thoughts in the comments below. One thing we are overlooking here is the fact that Ned said until the ""rightful heir **comes of age.**"" 

Stannis is already of age, so why would Ned write that tiny detail? Jon was only 14 at the time in the books. If Ned intended Stannis, then Stannis is well above the age to rule, thus unseating himself in the process. So why didn't Ned omit the coming of age part? I think this highly implies someone young that is not Joffrey.

Sure it could mean Tommen, or Myrcella, but they are also bastard children which is the very reason Ned omitted Joffrey. It could mean Gendry....but it could also mean Jon. There is a lot of reading between the lines that GRRM hid in this scene, and I feel it goes far beyond making Stannis king.",138,68,False,self,,,,,

Okay so we know from the teaser pics that Bran is with the three eyed raven and it's most likely a vision cause he's walking around. Also it looks like he's in a northern castle, presumably Winterfell.

Also season 5 started with a flashback of the Queen when she was a child. And I'm pretty sure I heard a while back that there was a someone casted as a young Ned for season 6.

I think that season 6 will open with the three eyes raven showing Bran Winterfell when Ned was young in a Christmas Carol type of way where he can walk around but nobody can see him. This way the show can open the same way as they have in the past and catch up on Bran's story killing two birds with one stone.

She is obviously trying to say that he did die. But won't remain that way for very long. She also hinted heavily at Jon Snow's return whilst on the Jimmy Kimmel show just over a month ago. She said ""The poster (containing Jon Snow) might have given the game away a little bit"".

According to the lore, the Long Night happened thousands of years ago and people froze to death and then the white walkers appears who could reanimate the dead. We've seen  people being reanimated from death, by magic or godly intervention as functioning humans or zombies. For the thing that is supposed to be final, it's surprisingly lenient in the world of Game of Thrones. Syrio Forel said that there's only one true god in the world and it's Death And that the only thing we say to is ""Not today"". That implies that the death can be postponed, maybe even after one's killed which we've seen it in action many times. And then the teaser for the S06 shows a lot of dead characters and the chance of death for many others. What if the phrase ""Long Night is coming and the dead come with it"" means that the long night is the actual reason why people get reanimated and white walkers are just some of these first reanimated people and the same will happen again. All the characters we saw as ""faces"" will die and then get reanimated for the final battle.

""That man's life was not yours to take. A girl stole from the Many-Faced God. Now a debt is owed."" said  Jaqen H'ghar. That implies that the God of Death, the Death itself, can claim lives and that they can be stolen from it. That seems to go against Syrio's belief. Doesn't seem that the god of death can be behind reanimating the dead, but who can? The only thing that can stop white walkers is Azor Ahai, who is supposedly a reincarnated god of fire. If we believe followers of the many-faced god, every deity is just a face of Death. That means that Azor Ahai is Death itself, coming into a real world to claim the dead it's been promised that were reanimated.

First, she pledged to defend Lord Renly with her life. Later that night she watched as he was assassinated. Next, she pledged to defend Lady Stark, but was not around when Stark had her throat slit. She wasn't around because she had been tasked, by Stark, with returning Ser Jaime unharmed to King's Landing. Under Brienne's protection Jaime is brutally maimed. Next, she sets off to to find and rescue the Stark girls. After stumbling upon Arya, Brienne kills Arya's protector, after Arya refuses to be rescued, and then can't find Arya; Arya is now alone in the world. Finally, Brienne runs into Sansa and, as with Arya, fails to convince her to be rescued. Later, after being raped and repeatedly abused by Ramsy, Sansa decides she's ready to be rescued. So sends the signal Brienne swore to watch for at all times, but unfortunately Brienne's attention has wandered elsewhere. And that's it. Effort and desire, sure, but Brienne thus far has been an absolute failure. 

To be fair, she may have avenged Renly by killing Stannis. ",12,0,False,self,,,,,

Just pick out three characters you expect to survive. Also, do me a favor and try to list your *riskiest* bets first. For example if you predict Arya will survive, I'd consider that to have a lot less risks tied to it than a prediction Roose Bolton will survive til the end, so list Roose first and explain reasons why. Not a big deal, just a minor request since I think the risky bets will be more interesting to read. Don't sweat it if you can't decide which survival you think is the least likely of your three, however. Keep it in mind though if you have over three bets; I for example don't expect Tyrion to die, but I don't consider that to be the most shocking revelation ever, so I won't be including him on my list.


Anyways, here's my three:


**Jaime** - I somehow expect that Jaime simply has too much to his storyline for him to die. One thing is that many theorize he will be the one to fulfill Cersei's prophecy, so as long as she's alive, so is he. Another is that you sort of expect Jaime's story arc to have him slowly drift from Cersei and towards Brienne, and we still aren't seeing incredibly strong signs that he's drifting from Cersei. Given the current rate of things, if we're to presume that he will indeed drift from her and towards Brienne, his story is moving far too slow for him to kick the bucket any time soon. As it stands, Jaime seems like he could easily survive the next two seasons. 

I also feel like Jaime just fits perfectly as a surviving character. Technically, he's directly responsible for much of the conflicts that have unfolded in the series. In that regard, he's one of the worst characters. On the other hand, he's done a lot of good aswell. He's this perfect balance of grey, and as such, doesn't seem like a character that needs much ""correcting,"" if the current path is to continue. I also personally wonder if perhaps we won't see some kind of ""synthesis"" where Brienne must perhaps break a vow in order to *protect* Jaime, whilst Jaime himself has acted honorably in the events leading up to that moment. I think that'd be interesting to see, if Brienne were forced to become an oathbreaker herself to rescue Jaime, and it'd create this scenario where Jaime and Brienne came full circle. Regardless of which theory about Jaime you wish to follow, I don't know of any theories that see him dying soon. It's *possible* he could die right at the end, but that simply remains to be seen. Even then, I would expect his death to be rather heroic. If not heroic, then I wouldn't be surprised if perhaps he offed another king, again in a positive manner for the realm. And if an opportunity doesn't arise for him to be heroic or a kingslayer towards the end, then there's simply no sense killing him at that end, either.

**Podrick** - Don't get me wrong, Game of Thrones isn't afraid to kill off characters, and minor characters or supporting characters are regularly killed off simply because they *are* disposable. Podrick however, I feel would be taking it too far, even by Game of Thrones standards. He's a character that's done absolutely nothing wrong whatsoever while already having quite a bit of honor, talent and heroics to his name. Podrick is this *perfect* balance where....let's say next season they killed of Tyrion. Alright, that's a huge deal. That's a major character, so even if you loathe the decision, you cannot deny it carries heavy implications for the series moving forward. Podrick is not significant enough for his death to serve this purpose. On the other end of the spectrum, you have characters like Shireen that are obviously very minor. If they die, it's not so much a big deal with huge ramnifications for the world and the story, but rather her death is more symbolic; her dying symbolizes a sort of loss of innocence or broken promises. It *means* something. Podrick isn't exactly this either. It's *possible* for him to develop into something like this for Brienne, but it's not something I consider likely.

In short, I consider Podrick to be this perfect balance of significant, insignificant and likeable so that his death would be nothing but aggrivating. There's no payoff. Yes of course, this series is full of aggrivating deaths, but they were deaths with purpose. They were deaths that either highlighted the cold-heartedness of another character that offed them (Shireen, Ros) or they helped move the story forward (Robb, Tywin). In Pod's position, the only people with potential to kill him at the moment are Brienne (would never happen) or the Boltons, who don't *need* to kill anyone to drive home how disgusting they are, as it's already established. In that regard, I think the death of Podrick would even cross the line by Game of Thrones standards, as it'd be nothing short of senseless. Meanwhile, we get sort of comical little allusions to Podrick's potential here and there. He's killed a Kingsguard, he's so good in bed whores don't accept payment from him, he's got little talents in areas when least expected and may be one of the most honorable and knight-like characters the show has to offer. I look at Podrick and have to wonder if perhaps we're not seeing a future legendary knight; a character that's meant to act as the new Barristan Selmy or Kingslayer for when the series is coming to a close. But death? I don't really see it. At least not yet.


**Gendry** - Again, I think this series will come full circle. House Baratheon is born of bastards, and it's only got one bastard left being showcased. It would also be pretty poor writing if his storyline just *died* in a rowboat with no sense of closure, so make no mistake, I do expect to see him again. And in regards to stories coming full circle? Gendry is perfect. Not much to say about that, he's simply perfect. And let's be real here: he already survived three seasons, spent another two seasons on a boat, MAY spend another season on a boat, and then he's only got a handful of seasons to not die in. Considering that I think we can all agree when he returns, his return will hold quite a bit of significance (aka the realm realizing ""holy crap this is the heir to Storm's End with a decent claim towards the throne), his death would not be swift by any means, nor would it be one that the show is likely to include without a good bit of drama behind it to highlight that this means the death of House Baratheon in it's entirety. Lastly, Melisandre had quite a bit to say about the guy, none of it suggesting he would simply die a meager death of no significance. 

Simply put, upon his eventual return, you can expect glory. Lots and lots of glory. But death...? I really don't see it happening. His survival would embody the series coming full circle in an almost perfect fashion: it would be proof ""the wheel"" is still spinning since House Baratheon is once again born of bastards, and yet the house would be changed and different under him, for a proper element of realism. But if he were to just die or drown in his rowboat? ...Well that's just fucking lame. Bad writing, not entertaining or interesting, and of course the writers know that and know better, so I just don't see it happening.

What if the boy is Olly, the baby Nights Watch-man (and Jon's steward) that betrayed Jon Snow. And the man to be born (reborn?) is obviously Jon. 

My main reason to come up with this idea is that let's face it Jon is not dead one bit. And it's a safe bet that Melisandre ends up resurrecting him, but do you think that she would need a sacrifice to do this. Like a life for life situation possibly.
 
Someone's probably posted this before me but I think it's important to consider HOW Jon gets resurrected and what connotations that has for the world. For example will more people worship R'hllor because his magic is proven to exist?

As you can clearly see in the pictures, Hafthor Bjornsson (The Mountain, Robert Strong) has his zombie makeup behind those glasses he's wearing. I guess he just got the makeup put on and then went on to film. But the interesting part is found on his instagram profile at around the same time.

This guy is a viking, alright?
He ALWAYS has a beard going, ALWAYS. Even when he played the Mountain in season 4. So WHY would this guy suddenly get that beard shaved precisely when filming in Dubrovnik and generally when filming season 6? My only answer to that is that the kings guard helmet is going off at SOME time during the next season, I mean that must be the only reason? So that they can put that creepy zombie-eye makeup all over his face, so he looks zombiefied when the helmet goes off?
Anyways, this was a minor rant, but please tell me what you guys think about it down below. Might just be a coincidence that he got shaved.

But wondering what you think? This is a show only theory, as I'm not sure there'll be a clear equivalent in the books.  


After Jon's death the new NW commander sends ravens to Last Hearth and all the other major Northern Houses explaining that the Wildlings are loose south of the Wall, and he asks for help in containing them. Knowing that Stannis has been defeated by The Boltons, and knowing that the support of the House ruling Winterfell is crucial in any effort to destroy the Wildlings, he blames Stannis and Jon for letting the Wildlings south of the Wall, and tells the Boltons that he killed Jon for his betrayal of his oaths (and for declaring himself the Boltons' enemy). Jon is clearly established as the ""bad guy"" in this story.  


The NWC asks the Boltons to rally the northern Houses to destroy the Wildlings, or drive them back north of the Wall. The Boltons oblige and rally their bannermen, who are also pretty upset about the news that the Wildlings have been allowed to cross the Wall.They don't much like the Boltons, but they fear the Wildlings. They have no idea that the Others are the real threat, or that they even exist. They only know that the NW and the Wall have existed for thousands of years for the sole purpose of keeping the Wildlings north of the Wall.  


Ramsay gathers an army of the united northern houses to destroy the Wildlings, who are lead by a resurrected Jon Snow. (This would explain the set spoilers that suggested the Umbers were actually fighting alongside the Boltons.). 


On the battlefield, what had seemed like a straightforward fight against the Wildlings suddenly becomes very, very complicated, when the Northern Houses see Jon Snow, whom they had believed dead. They begin to suspect that the NWC hasn't told them the complete truth about Jon. Sansa and Rickon become aware that Jon is alive. Perhaps they receive a message from him, perhaps he somehow manages to sneak into Last Hearth or their camp to talk to Sansa? (Is this where we see the cast ""Lord of the Tower"" who may make the difficult decision to let Jon in to meet with Rickon and Sansa?) Sansa trys to persuade the Northern lords not to follow the Boltons into battle against Jon. The Northern Lords meet (without the Boltons) to discuss amongst themselves what to do. Some listen to Sansa (could Jon even possibly be there?) and the united front of the Northern Houses shatters, with some remaining loyal to the NW and the Boltons, and others supporting Jon. (Is this where we see the cast Noble who makes a stirring speech that turns most of the northern Houses against the Boltons?).  


Little Finger is watching the whole thing from a distance, hanging back to see who will win the battle, with plans to swoop onto the battlefield at the end and defeat the weakened victor, then declare himself Lord of Winterfell. Cuz' that's what LF would do.  


The armies meet, the battle rages, thousands die, a clear victor is hard to determine in the midst of such chaos. Defeat of the Boltons appears almost certain. Ramsay is captured and is at Jon's mercy. Little Finger begins to make his move and approach the battlefield.
But wait! What is that icy mist creeping over the hill? Only Jon and the Wildlings understand what it is. As the threat becomes clearer the survivors rally around the only leader to have met the Others in battle and survive...Jon Snow. They do what they can, gathering the dead and trying to burn them as quickly as they can (which explains the set photos of heaps of bodies on the battlefield). But there isn't enough time to finish the job. The Others are moving fast. The Others arrive at the battle. They resurrect the dead on the field, creating an armed wight army. There is a valiant last stand against the Others and their wight army. WunWun holds them off as long as he can to give Jon time to retreat to Winterfell. Sadly he dies and is also resurrected as a wight.  


The survivors retreat into Winterfell, which because of some sort of magic/spell thingy is protected from the Others. Enemies are now forced together, uneasy allies. (This explains the set spoilers suggesting that Jon, Sansa, Little Finger and Ramsay are all alive and in the Winterfell court yard after the battle). There's lots of arguing. Sansa wants Ramsay killed. Jon correctly argues that they'll need every single survivor to have even a chance in the battle against the Others, and lets Ramsay live. This will probably end up being a very bad idea indeed, but that's Jon for you. The wight army and unWunWun gather outside the walls of WInterfell and try to enter, but the spells hold and Winterfell is safe, but surrounded. This is how S6 ends.",21,14,False,self,,,,,

Like the rest of you, I'm waiting for season 6 and I'm bored so I am gonna tell you all a story about something that happened to me last year when I first started watching this show.

I started watching this show last year before season 5 aired and I was hooked. I caught just in time for season 5 and I was mega hyped! Now at the beginning of May, the teachers in my high school and teachers in high schools across the board went on strike for higher pay or something. It was actually kinda sweet, because we got to miss like three weeks of school due to the strike.
 
Sometime during the middle of this strike, my friend (who also really likes this show) informed me that, courtesy of HBO Canada and Ciniplex (its a theatre company), the Season 5 finale would be aired in Ciniplex theatres across the country FOR FREE!! We knew we had to get tickets. The way it worked was there was a set date and time (I think it was a Wednesday at 12 oclock in mid-May) when we would log onto the Ciniplex website then we input our emails and then we get verification codes and printouts for the tickets. The only catch was, there were limited seats for each theatre, so this email-input system was on a first come-first serve basis.

The day before we were going to get our tickets, the school board announced the end of the strike. Obviously I was mad. I was supposed to be getting tickets tomorrow, not being in school. Luckily, I had a lunch period at 12 oclock, but it would end soon afterwards so I had to be quick about it. But, my friend pointed out to me that my schools Wi-Fi is garbage. Neither of us had data, so we needed to go somewhere else to get our tickets. Luckily, there was a public library that was close enough, but I would probably miss at least part of economics class while I was getting these tickets.

The day comes, and I tell my classmates to cover for me. I go to the library. The, at 12 oclock, the site isnt working, it wouldnt let us input our emails. I panic. It was a first come-first serve basis, what if others get the tickets first and then theres none left for us? After like 10 or 15 minutes of trying, I tell my friend we are going to be VERY late for class and we need to head back. So we sprint back and instead of going to class, I notice my friend heading to the cafeteria to try at this ticket thing again. So I go, too. It works at our school, surprisingly, so we never really had to skip class and go to the library in the first place. But whatever, we were getting the tickets now.

Because of this, I missed a ton of econ class. Much more than I thought I would. I head back to class and my teacher gets mad at me for walking in late. I apologize. Then he asks me what I was doing at the public library. Instantly, I knew my classmates betrayed me. They didnt cover for me at all. I tried to BS my way out of it, but I was pretty obviously lying and my teacher got pretty mad at me. Everyone laughed at me :-/ It was even more embarrassing because I needed to ask that same teacher for help later that period on an essay I was writing for the class.

In the end though, it was worth it. I saw the finale in theatres in June, it was amazing. Although, because I went to theatre that night, I forgot to study for a chemistry test I had the next day.

TL;DR: I needed tickets for the season 5 finale, skipped econ class for it, none of my classmates covered for me, I goofed.",7,8,False,self,,,,,

I've only read the first few chapters in the books, so I'm hoping to learn more about them as I read. I'm fascinated by the faces they've carved in the trees.

No one says a word through the entire beginning of the scene but everyone's non verbal motions are just incredible.  

I also love how everyone's actions mimic their personalities.  

Tywin - Standing at the head of the table where he's always felt he should be.  Demanding others do as he wishes.  

LF, Varys and the Maester - quickly abiding by Tywin's demands as to continue to play the game in the shadows by back dealing and such.

Cersei - separates herself from those she thinks are beneath her....at the right side of her father who she feels protects her.  

Tyrion - first assumes he's not welcome and then when he realizes he is......he separates from everyone as if to say I don't support or trust ANY of you right now....  ",13,106,False,self,,,,,

He's dead, but he's obviously too important of a character to not be brought back. Some people think he'll be burnt on a funeral pire but walk away unscathed for being half Targarean. (Martin stated that was a one time thing btw)

In the show, they don't waste screen time (other than Dorne), and had Mel meet with Barric and Thoros right when Thoros was resurrecting Barric. Not a coincidence. So the precedent was set. I truly don't believe there's an argument to be made against this regarding Jon coming back.

I can see it now, before either ep 2 or 3, they'll reference that for the casual viewer in the ""previously on"" piece.

Thoughts?

Similarly, I was stoked when Tyrion aka my other favorite living character was travelling to Essos to meet her and hopefully revitalize her story, but in my opinion it somehow had the adverse effect: the Essos story arc just slowly made Tyrion less interesting of a character.",205,152,False,self,,,,,

Let me begin by saying I am a reader first, and am in absolute love with the book series.  I am currently working on my reread, and enjoying the hell out of the All Leather Must be Boiled books 4 &amp; 5 combo read.  I am also a huge fan of the show, and look forward to watching it every Spring.  I have always been ahead of the game (eh?) when it comes to having read first, watched second.  

Because of this, I have always known the major plot points and story-line before watching the seasons.  So far, the show has not ruined the books for me, even with the occasional spoilers here and there (Night King, finding out what happened to Theon/Reek before reading, etc.).  I haven't minded the different direction the show has taken on several topics, because I have been comfortable accepting the fact that the books and the show are two different animals at this point.

However, now that the show has passed the books, I am a bit nervous to watch season 6.  I understand that there will be things on the show that will not be in the books, which doesn't bother me, but I am worried about the details that will be revealed that are going to be in the books.  I have loved being able to read first and know what is going to happen on the show.  I enjoy comparing the series and the show at the same time.  But the fact that these wonderful, beautiful books could be spoiled for me has me questioning whether or not I should even watch the upcoming season.  My hope (as far-fetched as it may seem) is that book 6 will be released sometime this year, and I can read it and go back and watch season 6 after the fact.  

I am torn, my brothers and sisters.  Has my watch ended, at least for now? ",15,0,False,self,,,,,

Season 5 finished off Dany with a new Dothraki group and I began to wonder where the show could take it from there.

For the past couple of seasons Dany has seemed to make many poor decisions. At some points even similar to Rob Starks storyline where he ultimately dies. Hoping it doesn't come to that I'm thinking the show could bring her back to her Dothraki roots where she first became the fierce Khalesi we knew.

As I read the first book in the series I came across an ancient Dothraki prophecy Jorah told her when the first entered - Vas Dothrak - their holy city. It mentioned of some one who would unite all of the different Dothraki hordes into one unified army. Do you think Danerys has the potential of doing that? She's already much better of than in Season 1... she has Drogon with her and she can speak Dothraki. She just has to prove herself now. Will Dany's united Dothraki army help in the Long Night against the White Walkers? (Book 1 also mentions how Dothraki fighters are some of the best fighters in the world)

Ramsay, after sending the pink letter, will travel to castle black with bolton soldiers and demand his bride back, they tell him jon isn't there but he doesn't believe them and takes some of them captive as bait for jon, so him and sansa will be forced to confront Ramsay.  When it is time for battle, to provoke jon, ramsay will display them on crosses to get in his head.  I know a lot of people have predicted one of the characters is Rickon, but i think he still has a bigger part to play in the story.  Remember when bran had a dream and went into the winter fell cripts after Ned died and Rickon was already there, suggesting he may have Jojen like abilities.

This made me realize we don't know what all Ned's promise to Lyanna entailed. (This may seem obvious, but there are a lot of scenarios that would mean different things to the story.) Operating under the assumption that R+L=J is legit, I initially assumed it just meant to keep Jon safe. But I think it entails more than that. Is it to keep Jon's parentage a secret? If so, then why would Ned tell Jon they'd discuss his mother next time around? Was the promise to not let Robert find out about Jon's parentage? If so, it seems like Ned could've then confided in Catlynn. (She wouldn't have betrayed Ned's trust, and it'd have saved Catlynn a lot of grief.) Was it to tell Jon of his parentage at the right time? Maybe because Lyanna knew her and Rhaegar's son would be the Prince that was Promised. (There seems to be some evidence in a vision Dany had in the House of the Undying.)

My opinion: I think Lyanna and Rhaeger knew how important a role their son would play in the future. I tend to think, too, that Ned knew what a powerful, influential player Jon could be because of his parentage. (Though, perhaps not so far as to know or believe he was the Promised One or Azhor Ahai.) I think the promise was for Ned to shield Jon from those who could destroy or corrupt him and only tell him of his true identity ""at the right time,"" to be determined by Ned. Perhaps if Ned at lived long enough, the the political strife in Westeros, in conjunction with the impending Others invasion, would have been cause enough to tell Jon of his parentage and give Jon the chance to rise and become a major player. I don't think the promise entailed never tell anyone, including Jon, about his parentage. There had to have been a loophole. But, I don't know that this explains why Ned didn't or couldn't tell Catlynn, so there has to be something else, right?

JL is such a complex character who has had a truly redeeming arc in the world of westeros and I believe his S6 path will continue his journey to righteousness
To begin I believe we will first see Jamie as he is returning to kings landing based off this promotional photo, with myrcellas corpse covered behind him
http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/f47d5fd1b64583fa07e43bcfd26aa17fbf1895a5ab5180f57ce2e5c06ffd2533114d3c331c5d6d3838d657eb7d88f660-768x511.jpg
cersei will be waiting for him and still distraught from her walk of penance. She will be joined by the reserected Mountain who will be not too far. Jamie will deliver the body and the scene will be very emotional with more atmosphere than dialogue.
http://8840-presscdn-0-18.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/12132511_887713074609998_2897582100707833890_o-810x456.jpg
As for Bronn, I believe if he is shown at all before Jamie eventually leaves for the river lands. It will be in tow of Jamie with Trystance bound as a sort of prisoner. I believe Trystane will be present in kings landing regardless as I can not see Jamie returning to Dorne. He will demand consequences.
I believe the next scene we will see Jamie is him discussing the death of myrcella with cersei who will demand revenge. Jamie will attempt to be diplomatic with her but she will call him a coward or something along those lines and leave the room. We will begin to see Jamie see cersei for who she really is
http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/c005844822b3bcc6e3ad2f109b8db34532b799537db6612fdcf15b5d724200171ac3acfa0a629efa61603887dcdd536d-768x511.jpg
There will be a funeral held for myrcella with all the big players (kevan, pycelle, qyburn) in Kings landing in attendance
Next Jamie scene will be himself and Tommen next to myrcellas body. Tommen will still be very confused of the politics surrounding him and explain everything that happened with the faith militant. Jamie will convince him to stay strong and that he will do all he needs to free Margery
http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/73e277f70f633f433ab947528fbb9fa375273b2d316fa98a9017d7e4cb67698896d438dc1d5a4a2425a56db1f3c37bc2-768x511.jpg
This is when we will see Jamie suit up accompanied by the tyrell army and mace tyrell to free Margery and loras. He will feel the need to protect his last illegitimate child and reverse the anomie happening in Kings landing
http://8840-presscdn-0-18.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/jaime-on-horseback.jpg
When he arrives at the steps of the faith militant he will demand for the tyrells be released. For sure Margery will be released at this point and converted as a member of the faith. Whether this is a ploy is up for debate I couldn't say myself. Loras will probably remain imprisoned at this time denying to bend the knee to the faith. Both mace and Jamie will be dismayed by this. When Margery returns to king Tommen she will also convince him to join the faith. This is when Jamie will decide to leave for the river lands and attempt to stop the siege at the castle of house Tully by the freys. Seeing nothing left for him in KL he will enlist Bronn and a small Lannister army to help him lift the siege, at cerseis command.
Meanwhile, cersei will demand trial by combat to the High Sparrow and Jamie will turn her down 
The FrankenMountain will be her champion (get hype)
Whether or not there is a scene between Jamie and Trystane is quite debatable but that's for another discussion of Dornes role in S6.
There will be a scene of Jamie, Bronn and the Lannister army riding to the river lands where he will see see devastation across the lands. 
After arriving at riverrun, jamie will meet with Walter Frey or another Frey commander and be asked to try to allow blackfish to give up command of riverrun. Jamie will parley with bryndon ""blackfish"" Tully who will be stubborn to give up riverrun.
Brienne of Tarth and Podrick will arrive at the siege and Jamie and her will have an awkward reunion where she will storm out and join the Tully side after Jamie refuses to lift the siege. I expect a comedic scene between Podrick and Bronn as well
Edmure Tully will be held captive by the freys and after threats of being hanged, will remain a prisoner. There will be a deal reached by the end of the season with the freys taking control of riverrun after Jamie convinces Blackfish to escape with several Tully soldiers, and Edmure remaining a captive of the Freys. (or possibly being released)
Jamies last scene will be with Brienne who will arrive at Jamie's tent claiming to have found Sansa Stark. They will embark at night Just the two of them as Brienne tells him the Hound will kill Sansa otherwise. This sets up a cliffhanger at the end of the season regardless of the appearance of Lady Stoneheart or another Stark seeking revenge. However, if LSH is in the show I imagine the finale may end with her reveal (don't get your hopes up)

Side notes (THEORY):
I believe Brienne will encounter the Hound as the Gravedigger after meeting Septon Meribald/Elder Brother and the Brotherhood without Banners and her mention of him will be HYPE for the S7 premiere to feautre CLEGANEBOWL

I believe the Freys will end the season in power of Riverrun to allow S7 to feature Jon Snow's new Northern host to feature some battle scenes and politics while gathering an army to defeat the WW and the army of the dead and allow Arya to exact revenge of Walder Frey.

This also ends S6 with Brienne, Jamie and Cerseis stories to match up with the end of the books so far, while other plotlines will go off page.

Except for Ned who when he did it there was a sense of honor and duty, and after that you kinda compare all of them to this. I mean when Theon did it, it was just madness, when Robb did it, it wasn't the wisest move, and when Joffery did it, it was also madness and it shows with the character. But when Jon executes Slynt, the way the music is silenced and even though he is pleading for mercy, he still goes through with it, shows that this really was the proper punishment for Slynt and that Jon maybe learned the most about duty and honor from Ned.

Any new locations?

Here's my prediction.

* King's Landing: pretty much guaranteed
* Winterfell: pretty much guaranteed
* The Wall: pretty much guaranteed
* Meereen: pretty much guaranteed

* Vaes Dothrak: probably
* Pyke: probably

* Braavos: early in the season
* Dorne: early in the season
* Riverrun: late in the season

* The Twins: maybe at some point

* Harrenhall: don't think so
* Moat Cailin: don't think so
* The Eyrie: don't think so
* The Dreadfort: don't think so
* Dragonstone: don't think so

* Pentos: no
* Qarth: no
* Astapor: no
* Yunkai: no

I think we're running out of major new opportunities for cool cog animations. Maybe only Oldtown, Casterly Rock and Highgarden, and I don't think we'll see the latter two yet. I guess Sunspear has been replaced by Dorne permanently. Volantis could be amazing, but they skipped that  opportunity last season. It is possible that they will come up with animations for some of the less important places such as The Last Hearth or White Harbor, if they are heavily featured in one or two episodes... Pentos was featured in episode 1, and later recycled for episode 1 of season 5 - I guess only because they already had an animation. The Twins was also used for a single episode before it was recycled for season 3.

A few of my predictions:

**Azor Ahai** - They've briefly delved into Stannis being the ""Chosen One"" by the Lord of Light, but I don't believe we've really seen the legend of Azor Ahai in the show.  

**Drowned God/Iron Islands** - I believe they did a House Greyjoy History on an earlier season's disc set, but now would be a good time to dive a little more into the Iron Islands, maybe getting more into their religion.  

**House Tarly** - Presumably we're going to see more House Tarly this year?  Be nice to see a history of Sam's family and his father's role as a military commander in recent wars.  

**Brotherhood Without Banners** - I would guess we're going to see a lot more of the Riverlands this season, so it'd make sense to reintroduce the BwB since its been awhile, maybe comparing them to the Kingswood Brotherhood/Smiling Knight/Simon Toyne/etc.

**More northern houses** - The North Remembers!  Time to introduce some Karstark, Manderly, Dustin, or Umber histories?

But Lysa also died after falling in the moon door. It's only after Lysa died that Brienne finally met the girls.

But winning jousting competition doesn't seem to be a steady source of income, and unless you're the best of the best like Loras, it's not a method for more common knights

Jamie and Barriston are the kingsguard, and so was Brienne and the Hound at some point, so they may get wages. Does Dany give wages to her advisors? did the book mention Barriston and Jorah being on payroll at any point after she became the queen of mereen? 

Does Brienne get income for her service to Catelyn? Catelyn says that Brienne will always have food and board, but is that it??? For most of the travels Brienne hunt animals and build fire to cook, and sleep outdoors in a sleeping bag, but she does visit inns on occasions like when she went to crossroad inn. She also stayed in King's Landing for some time during Joffrey's wedding, which cost money. Is Brienne living off on her daddy's allowance? Is being a knight even a real job? 

Tyrion specifically say the he doesn't pay podrick. Podrick doesn't come from any major house with a lot of wealth. So how does podrick get money do buy....anything? 

After running away from battle of the blackwater bay, Hound seem to make a living out of...stealing mostly. Is that the usual way of Knight's income? They steal from smallfolk with their big swords? 

If you want to be a knight you need to buy an armour and swords and need to pay the blacksmith to make them and maintain them. So how do they get money to do that if the lord they serve do not give them wages?

I may be ticket-calling for the hype train here, but would it be possible for Arya to take on an amended role of Lady Stoneheart??? I think it would be awesome to have Arya join up with the BWOB, once Westeros-side again, and use her dead mothers face while rummaging through the country, hanging Freys and gradually crossing off names on her kill-list. After all, the absence of LSH from the show has left lots of fans scratching their heads and trying to figure out the true extent of her role in the books. Thought it might be a nice nod to appease both readers and viewers without completely derailing any storylines. Any takers?

So,here are the 16 characters whose faces were revealed:

1.Jon Snow

2.Daario

3.Melisandre

4.Nymeria

5.Robert Baratheon

6.Oberyn

7.Daenerys

8.Tormund

9.Jamie

10.Joffrey

11.Sansa Stark

12.Robb Stark

13.Cersei Lannister

14,Catelyn Stark

15.Arya Stark

16.Tyrion

Do you notice anything strange about the characters on this list? They are all characters who **we know for a fact are alive**, or characters **who we know are dead**.

Dany,Dario,Tyrion,Jamie,Arya,[S6 Spoilers](#s ""Jon Snow"") (etc.) are all alive right now,whilst Oberyn,Joffrey,Robb,Oberyn (etc.) are characters that we **saw die**. Who is missing you ask? 

Well,how about Sandor Glegane? Or Stannis? Whilst we are missing certain major characters like Tywin or Barristan, these are all characters who we saw die and most likely won't play **any** role in S6. But,neither the Hound or Stannis's deaths were directly shown,and for all we know they could still play a role in S6.

S6 spoiler territory here,where I'll explain this in further detail:

[S6 Major Spoilers](#s ""Alright so,the entire ""Hall of Faces"" marketing teaser is clearly centered around Jon Snow,because HBO knows he's alive and that he's coming back through Melisandre,which is why they showed her face and not Stannis's. Also, the legacy of Robb,Catelyn and Ned all live through Sansa,for whom we know has an important role this season,so they showed them as well. Not to mention the potential of Catelyn returning as Lady Stoneheart. Tyrion and Dany,who are also both alive, play a major role as well. HOWEVER, we never saw Stannis or the Hound die, so if they are coming back, they couldn't show their faces on the posters since they are NOT either confirmed alive or confirmed dead,but of course they can't spoil the surprise for us just yet.

Maybe something significant could've happened to Dany as well, to get her story off the book path. I think implementing this would've made it much easier to tell a story from a TV perspective - sometimes I feel like the show feels very rushed. In addition, I would imagine this would have relieved a ton pressure from GRRM in terms of the show catching up. The comparison of new events and/ or new causation to the same event would be incredibly entertaining to dissect.

I really thought of this idea with respect to the event of our Lord Commander being reborn - one should have him be dead, the other alive (probably the show and book, respectively - the book would be more interesting to go through the details). But I thought its a bit too far now to deviate that much.

Now how i think it will get connected to Walder Frey...

After the White Walkers breach the Wall and march South they will come to The Twins (as it is the only crossing to get South) We know the White Walkers hate everyone with hot blood and probably try to kill everyone at the Twins before marching forward.Walder Frey knowing he won't be able to fight back or run very far will hold up in his castle and gradually his food stocks will deplete and they will eat the Horses and the Rats till there are no more of them.And then everyone will have to resort on cannibalism.

Most of the people at the Twins are Walder Frey's offsprings and so Walder Frey will be doomed to survive by **eating his own younglings.**

Right around the 2:02 mark, there's a split-second shot of a character that is [almost definitely Varys](http://imgur.com/0LP42cF). Not sure if it's been confirmed anywhere, but I thought that was very very interesting. I Googled it, and, I haven't read the books, but people think that Varys might have set up the riot to abduct someone named Lord Tyrek? Here's a passage from the books:

&gt; It was Varys he thought of then, smiling and smelling of lavender. The eunuch had agents and informers all over the city. It would have been a simple matter for him to arrange to have Tyrek snatched during the confusion . . . provided he knew beforehand that the mob was like to riot. And Varys knew all, or so he would have us believe. Yet he gave Cersei no warning of that riot. Nor did he ride down to the ships to see Myrcella off.

A) He wants Robert to think he wants Dany killed, so that he can say she's killed and allow her to develop on the other side of the world unmolested.

B) He uses Robert to push for the assination attempts as a way to speed up the process (Arya overheard Illyrio (sp) telling Varys to speed things up)

C) He has Jorah stationed by Dany to ""spy"" and alerts him of the assination attempts so that Jorah can stop them. He knows this will infuriate Khal Drogo that someone would dare try to kill both his queen and his son and hopefully push him to invade Westeros.

No seriously, I didn't get any of this my first time watching this series (I'm dumb), but damn Varys can play the game.


EDIT:

So we're talking about theories and figured I'd explain mine...

I believe that Illyrio and Varys knew of Viserys' attitude from the get go. Illyrio had housed them for several years and both realize that Viserys would never be able to hold the throne. He'd just be another ""Mad King"" and get disposed of. I feel like instead they'd get rid of Viserys through the marriage with the Dothraki. Illyrio even states that she needs to get pregnant with Khal Drogo. Doing so creates another heir to the throne. 

Once they get rid of Viserys they can implant Dany as the queen regant, and mold her son into the perfect Targaryan king. While this is going on they can have Aegon come in and marry her. (Such is the Targaryan way) securing the Targaryan claim to the throne.",166,600,False,self,,,,,

 Bronn=Aegon BUT he was never killed by the Mountain as people say 

- We don't know his last name/where he is from/who he parents were

- Expresses his love for singing *which I think the show makes it an obvious point.* Rheagar liked singing too

- Also like, Rheagar, he doesn't seem to have a problem wooing the ladies

- He seems Dornish. I don't know how to explain it but, he seemed to fit in well. And he likes the bad pussy so...

OR...
Just to get real tinfoily...
What if R+**L**=Bronn??
Is there enough time for them to have 2 kids (assumimg R+L does in fact=J) or maybe even twins?? How old is Bronn? Could him and Jon be brothers?

I need this show to come back.

Hi I'm the current editor of A Song of Ice and Fire, and various other warcraft III Map Makers. So, over the past roughly three years a project on Warcraft III has been going on that has created a multiplayer based strategy community around game of thrones/ a song of ice and fire. Now what makes this unique is that not only is it focused around a narrative approach to gameplay but it also works in the actions of players and other players as working as cohesive whole to come with your own unique outcomes.

A long while back I messaged moderators in regards to if it would be okay to post a link and some information about the project. So, lets detail a few basic things about the project which takes place starting very early into the first books.

First and foremost there are twelve factions in the map which covers all of Westeros and the Step Stones each with unique 'paths' that help you tailor the outcome of the map:
Red: Lannisters
Blue: The North
Teal: Riverlands
Purple(Black): Night's Watch
Green: Tyrells/Renly
Yellow: Dragon Stone(Stannis)
Gray: Crownlands
Brown: Iron Islands
Orange: Dorne
Light Blue: The Vale
Pink: The Wildlings
Dark Green: Winter

Second: This is a strategy game that plays like a mix of typical RTS, and MOBA. It is highly hero focused with just one catch, when a hero dies that hero is dead permanently. The map uses a QWER system so people who have played MOBA should be familiar to it's hotkeys. In addition each player has a set of bases which they can use to rally the units that are automatically spawned and improved time to their heroes and armies. As such the is a lack of base building in the map and a heavy focus on action!

Over-all this is one of the most popular warcraft III maps at the moment with around 800+ games hosted a month! As such we would really like to see new faces join our active and bustling player base!

Here's our website with a link to the ASOIF board: http://xenforo.gamerisle.org/index.php?forums/a-song-of-ice-and-fire.81/ Updates are regularly posted here, and you can find information about new versions such as change logs, and ongoing discussion of future features.

We also have a very two very active clans on Warcraft III that play the map on USeast which are: Clan KOSD/KOSN just visit our Clan Channel to play!

How do I get warcraft three if I don't have it? That's easy! Here's a link on blizzard's own home store page: https://us.battle.net/shop/en/product/warcraft-iii-reign-of-chaos you will also need https://us.battle.net/shop/en/product/warcraft-iii-the-frozen-throne the expansion for warcraft III.

Where do I find games of this being played?: http://makemehost.com/games.php shows a comprehensive list of all custom games on warcraft III being played currently on the available bots.

Tl;dr here's a video describing the game by one of it's more active players: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6deSOo-y9Rw

In closing I'd like to thank the moderator team for allowing me to make this post even if the delay between me posting it and acceptance was a bit long!",7,42,False,self,,,,,

Much later, when Jaqen H'ghar (or whoever) discovers Arya has used one of the faces and taken a life that she shouldn't have, he (?) readily takes poison and kills himself.  
  
I get that we have no idea who the actual person is that looks like Jaqen H'ghar -- maybe it's just a face that some Faceless Man is using.  But my question is this:  Why does a Faceless Man have such a problem killing himself in one instance and in another, drinks poison without hesitation?

* Slavemaster dude just plain fucked up when he handed Dany all his 8k soldiers without any failsafes. I find this strange because you don't get to be in that position unless you're really careful. But then again maybe he was just shitting his pants in excitement because **dragons**.
* None of the (former) slaves fell out of formation when Dany said that they can go. Probably a combination of their training and peer pressure. Personally I think the dude who started the mass spear-banging is a true bro.
