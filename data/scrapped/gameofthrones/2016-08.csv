With the recent death of our beloved Lord Bolton, there has been much speculation as to who will now rule the Dreadfort, as well as Karhold and Last Hearth. All three of these are strategically valuable locations. Here are my thoughts:


The Dreadfort: As Lady Bolton, Sansa's claim to the Dreadfort is strongest. Regarding whether or not a woman can claim it, it stands to reason that she can, the same way Lady Olenna can call the banners in the Reach to support Dany and the Sand Snakes can rule Dorne. It makes sense for her to claim it so that she will no longer be reliant on someone else (Joffrey, Cersei, Littlefinger, Ramsay, etc). Another possibility is that she will have the castle razed, but that's unlikely given that the Dreadfort is fairly big and well-defended and Jon would know that it could be useful. 


Last Hearth: Given that we are uncertain over the current state of House Umber, we can't say if there are any Umbers left to make a claim. My personal opinion is that Tormund will be raised to the title of Lord of Last Hearth and the wildlings will settle there. Alternatively, some less-known Umber could claim Last Hearth, kneel before Jon and beg. 


Karhold: I consider this case a little different, since I'm fairly certain that there are still living Karstarks. It's possible that they Karstarks get to keep Karhold, but given that the Karstarks were Ramsay's major supporters, I think Jon will strip any living Karstark of all lands and titles, then give command of Karhold to one his men, most likely Davos, either as Lord or Castellan. 


Other smaller Keeps and Castles: Umber and Karstark definitely weren't the only houses supporting Ramsay, so there may be a number, probably 3-5 smaller Keeps up for grabs, but I doubt the show will include them, given the lack of significant characters. ",15,2,False,self,,,,,

I know that in truth Robb, Catelyn, Theon, and Stannis are the reasons the Starks lost the war, but I believe Sansa has a bigger hand in the matter then most remember. 

Lets look at the facts, Robb and Catelyns hasty nature in the war were due to Sansa and Arya being prisoner. If Sansa and Arya werent in the hands of the Lannisters, its safe to assume they would be less reckless with their decisions.

SO fast Forward to the battle of the Blackwater where The Hound betrayed the kingdom and was planning on leaving KL. During that time he offered to free Sansa and to take her with him. She refused.

Due to her being shallow and not trusting the Hound she did not return to her family. Although Jaime had been freed by Catelyn by this point its safe to argue that with Sansa returning to her family they would've recaptured Jaime with the blessing from Catelyn. Thus regaining leverage in the war. Robb wouldnt lose the Karstarks and he wouldnt return to the Frays.

But as we know, that didnt happen, Sansa refused to be rescued. And that wouldnt be the last time she would do that. She was offered by LittleFinger too, and she refused and in doing so was left to marry Tyrion. Once again, she chose not to be with her family, this time because she wanted to Marry Loras. (His Brother in the books). Although, at this point the Starks were already slightly fucked, Sansa did not know this and still chose not to see her family.

In the end, Sansa's selfishness and naivety may be partly responsible for her families demise.

Explanation: The ancient Valyrians are the roots of the Targaryen family. They were known to have strange abilities including the bending of stone and creation of Valyrian Steel, although it isn't known how they did such things. What is known however, is that the Valyrians did have dragons.

Next season, I am willing to bet that Sam will discover the simple fact that once the Doom of Valyria occurred and nearly all of the dragons died out (save for Aegon's and a few others), Valyrian Steel became impossible to create. If Sam figures that Valyrian Steel must be crafted with dragon fire, then it will make him want to test theories regarding the possible truth of this hypothesis.

Daenerys plans to return the Iron Islands to Yara and Theon, and she will most definitely sail there as that is where Yara and Theon will have the advantage. If she is to sail under Westeros, she'll pass the Citadel at some point, and her dragons will be right along with her. This is the perfect opportunity for Sam to test this theory.

Other reasons that may prove this to be true include the idea of Dragon Glass. I know that it has been referred to as obsidian, but that doesn't strictly speaking MAKE it obsidian. Maybe the GOT/ASOIAF version of obsidian is made with dragon fire as well as it is known to kill White Walkers. After all, the idea of a volcano in Westeros and Essos is unknown to my knowledge, part from the possibility of that being from Valyria as well (or even the cause of the Doom of Valyria).",44,10,False,self,,,,,

However, there are two potential hurdles to clear: 1) there is a possibility that Bran cannot cross the wall without breaking its protection against the WW and 2) Jon Snow's brother re-appearing after a few years absence and declaring Jon to be the true heir to Westeros likely wouldn't be enough to convince the realm. So, in addition to Bran's testimony (either via a return to Winterfell or some form of communication as the three eyed raven) which of the following scenarios might provide enough credibility to accomplish this? And which is most likely?

1. Bran returns to Winterfell and demonstrates some other supernatural capability in front of some of the other Northerners (like seeing a future event or warging) that convince them that his visions are legit
2. Bran returns to Winterfell and his story is corroborated by a witness like Howland Reed, or the letter that Ned gave to Varys during his incarceration (not sure if I buy the latter but I have heard if elsewhere) 
3. Jon explores Lyanna's grave in the crypts, where they find Dawn (the sword which ultimately fulfills its namesake and becomes lightbringer) and/or a sealed letter from Ned that explains what happened

However, a few pieces of information have been posted already. Namely, that there is a character in Welsh mythology named Brn, and his name means ""blessed raven.""

This, in and of itself, is cool enough to speculate about, but I'd like to raise a few more interesting parallels between Bran of Welsh fame and Bran Stark. From now on, for clarity's sake, I'll refer to Welsh Bran as Bendigeidfran (welsh for blessed raven, a nickname for the mythological hero) and our beloved Bran Stark as Brandon. All information on Bendigeidfran was drawn from the Wikipedia page found here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Br%C3%A2n_the_Blessed

The major role Bendigeidfran plays in mythology centers around the marriage of his sister. Bendigeidfran was king of Britain, and a giant. An Irish king, Matholwch, asked for her hand in marriage, and Bendigeidfran agreed.

Bendigeidfran happened to have a half brother named Efnisien. Efnisien was displeased that he wasn't consulted about the marriage, so killed Matholwch's horses. An angered Matholwch returned to Ireland after Bendigeidfran gifted him a magic cauldron.

In Ireland, Bendigeidfran's sister (Branwen) was abused by her new people, and wrote home of her struggles. None other than her half brother, Efnisien, came to her aid.

Efnisien came to the castle with Bendigeidfran, and killed Matholwch's men while they planned an ambush on the rescuing forces.

AND NOW FOR THE PARALLELS

I have a feeling that many of you have probably already reached the conclusions I'm about to get to. Congratulations, you get an early start on sending GRRM your welsh regards.

Basically, the 4 characters of this story fit decently well into 4 characters of Game of Thrones.

Bendigeidfran = Brandon Stark

Efnisien = Brandon Stark's half brother, Jon Snow

Branwen = Brandon Stark's sister, Sansa

Matholwch = Sansa Stark's husband, Ramsay Bolton

A noble's (bran, both stories) sister (Branwen/Sansa) is wed to a ruler (Matholwch/Ramsay) of a nearby kingdom. The ruler proceeds to abuse his new bride to the point that she calls out to an old friend/relative. The half brother (Efnisien/Jon) kills the horses (and in Jon's case also the horsemen) of the ruler, and seeks revenge for the abuse the ruler inflicted on his half-sister. The half brother also puts his own life in danger to defeat the ruler in both situations, but Jon was the only one of the two to survive.

Takin' a fancy to the welsh now, George?

Tl;dr George is a dirty cheat who steals from the ancient welsh

Fell = The Dragon's death

So maybe there's a dead Ice dragon beneath Winterfell. There's no real proof of any of these but maybe you guys could help with more theories on this. 

For example, 

Why did they build a castle above the dead dragon?

What's gonna happen to Winterfell, if the dragon is somehow awakened?

Not sure if this is a new theory or not.

I've been re-watching season 1. Cersei mentions her son who died of fever that looked exactly like Robert. When Ned first meets Gendry (episode 4) he mentions that his mother had golden hair but died when he was little. Ned tells him to look at him - he then looks like he has seen a ghost indicating that he is the spitting image of Robert.

What if Cersei didn't kill her first born but gave him away? What if that first born is in fact Gendry.

Gendry is the rightful heir of the iron throne.

While apparently loyal to the Crown right now, all the legitimate Baratheons are dead so there's no one with a clear claim to Storm's End and the Stormlands. What should Dany do?

Maybe she'll take a lesson from Aegon the Conqueror. When Aegon invaded Westeros, he gave the Stormlands to his bastard companion Orys, who founded House Baratheon. Luckily for Dany, even though all the known Baratheons are dead, there happens to be a certain Baratheon bastard who a willing queen could legitimize and name this new ally the rightful Lord Paramount of the Stormlands. And luckily for Daenerys, she's almost certain to meet Jon--after all, Tyrion can vouch for him being a good guy and he's an obvious potential ally--who happens to have as his own chief advisor one of the very few people alive who knows of Gendry's existence and parentage.

And I still don't understand why the Umbers betrayed the Starks.

Even after the Tyrells joined the Lannisters and Stannis was defeated at black water and the Karstarks left return to the North, the Umbers decided to stick with the Starks anyways. At the Red Wedding the Umbers were betrayed by the Boltons as well. The fact that the Umbers were loyal up until this moment means that they did not see the failure in the south as a blunder on the Starks parts thus have no reason to hate the Starks to a point of kidnapping Rickon and turning him in to the Boltons. The Umbers must've still believed the war could have been won up until the Red Wedding. Even less, they have no reason to join with the Boltons as the Boltons also betrayed them. If anything they should be taking up arms against the Boltons for betraying them and their war in the south. 

Next, many will argue that the Umbers are the Northernmost house and thus were most against the wildlings entering the Gift. Being the northernmost house also means that they are the least prone to wildling attacks and raids, if anything the wildlings agreeing to live peacefully in the gift would mean no more raids and attacks. The Umbers are also one of the stronger Northern houses so they wouldn't need the Boltons to aid them in defeating a minute wildling force of 2,000 men. They could have easily defeated the widlings and even taken out the Nights Watch if they wanted to on their own. 

Lastly, from a more realistic point of view  the Umbers and Boltons are 2 of the larger northern houses and should have been able to field more than 6,000 men. 

Edit: I got the books/show mixed up. Greatjon was not at the red wedding but my point remains that the Umbers were betrayed along with the Stark at the red wedding as they were a part of Robb's army in the South. The fact that they were loyal to the Starks war effort up until that point means that they should put the blame of failure in the south onto the Bolton's and their betrayal. They have no reason to side with the house that betrayed them and their liege Lords as well as many other Northern houses. The Boltons essentially betrayed the North. ",20,2,False,self,,,,,

Many a time have I seen people talk about bastards like they have a degree of a claim to something. Some people even go as far as to say that a certain commoner bastard could sit the Iron Throne some day. Sorry to break it to ya folks, but that's not how bastardy works. A bastard has **NO CLAIM** on his father or mother's lands and titles and always stands last in line to inherit. Of course, if ALL the other family members are dead the bastard has a much better claim than Joey from the town inn. But other than that, he/she tehnically has no right to inherit if other family members of propper birth are alive. **Nobles in the GoT universe** (as well as medieval Europe) **generally do not have ANY respect for bastards at all!** A bastard becoming a lord/lady, or let alone a king/queen is a very rare and queer/special occurrence in the GoT universe. That's why Jon becoming **DAKINGINDANORF** is so much more significant than you think. This shows you how much the lords of the North respect him now, enough to make a bastard their king! This also adds depth to the dynamic between Jon and Sansa. Sansa is the one who should inherit the North by rights, but the lords/ladies of the North proclaimed Jon king without even mentioning the idea of making her the ruler. This also, I hope, explains to you that Gendry has **NO CHANCE** of sitting on the Iron Throne.

This seems to support the idea that she would be open to the idea that she would marry her nephew. Whether or not Jon would be open to that remains to be seen. I'm not really invested in the idea, it just caught my attention as I was reading.

TINFOIL AWAY!,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4vorat/everythingrewatching_currently_and_i_noticed/,DefsNotAVirgin,1470085110,"Ok so i have started rewatching and I just finished Episode 6 of season 2.  This is the episode where Jon Snow captures Ygritte.  When Qhorin the Halfhand is questioning her i noticed something odd. http://imgur.com/a/YplVR
When asked why Mance Rayder is sending people into the mountains, Ygritte looks right at Jons Valyrian steel sword.

This is where the tin foil can start to be fashioned into hats.  I think Mance Rayder is trying to find weapons to fight the white walkers, stay with me, I dont think his original idea was to march on the wall but more of a back up plan.  I think some how while Mance was a Man of the Nights Watch he learned of the stashes of dragon glass/ and possibly Valyrian steel hidden in the Frostfangs, possibly from Maester Aemon.  

In the Episode where Jon Meets Mance they talk about why Jon left the nights watch and he tells Mance it was because The Lord Commander knew about the dead taking crasters baby boys.  This could be the reason Mance left the Nights watch.  I think he told Lord Commander Mormont about the dead and he didnt believe him so he left the nights watch in order to side with the wildings knowing they were the last chance to defeat the WW if Mormont wasnt going to do anything.  

After not being able to find the swords or dragon glass, and now having another crow on his side, Mance decided his only chance was to go south over the wall.  This lead to his demise and the thought of dragon glass and valyrian steel died with him.  That is until Samuel Tarly killed a white walker with dragon glass and realized its true power.  

I believe through Sam's training at the Citadel he will learn of the locations of stashes of dragon glass.  He will inform Jon Snow and maybe Daenerys assuming this happens after her and Jon team up somehow.  At that time they will march/fly north obtaining the dragon glass and having the huge battle with the WW north of the wall.

This is day 6 of the roast thread. This is being done on all the major sports subreddits and with all the crazy content from our beloved series, I thought this would be pretty fun. And of course with something of this nature, there will be **spoilers and theories** galore from both the **SHOW AND BOOKS**. So stay out if you aren't caught up or don't want something spoiled.

Guidlines rules credit goes to /u/Isuckatthesethings1 on the /r/nfl subreddit (I honestly can't remember which sport was the first to do the roasts or who came up with the guidelines specifically so I'm going to credit him because that's where I saw it. If anyone knows better let me know and I'll change it.)

**GUIDELINES**

1. Lets try to be more creative than lul Cersei or no penis jokes. These jokes are unfunny and unimaginative and we all know we are better than that.

2.  This is a roast thread, please take all jokes as well..a joke. I saw a few cases of retaliation and arguing. Jokes are Jokes, dont like it? Move on.

3.  NO OTHER CHARACTER BASHING, save that precious ammo for when that character's time to be roasted comes.

4.  No malicious posts, trolling, or over the top comments attacking r/gameofthrones users. As i said before this is supposed to be light hearted and fun, lets keep it that way.

5.  The next characters up are on the list. Just look at the next people on the list after today, so you guys will have time to come up with material and decent jokes referring to those characters.

6.  Have fun! This is meant to be lighthearted thread and they are to be taken as such. The offseason can be long and hopefully this series will provide some fun to pass the time. So roast away!!

7. Here are the [**Maturity guidelines**](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/wiki/posting_policy#wiki_4._maturity.3A_all_content_must_be_respectful_and_mature) for this subreddit. Let's make sure we follow these too so no one gets in trouble!


**This is the list of character pairings we will be doing each day. The next day will be the next one on the list after the crossed off one (Today's) The list came from u/All_I_do_is_loss**

(If anyone has any ideas for better pairings or for missed characters, let me know and I'll add/change it)

Joffrey first 'awarded' Harrenhal to Janos Slynt for his role in betraying Ned Stark. Slynt loses Harrenhal shortly thereafter when Tyrion exiles him to the Wall, and the castle is in play once again.

Next, Tyrion offers Harrenhal to Littlefinger in the event that he can convince Lysa Arryn of the Vale to declare for the Crown. This was ultimately part of a ruse, of course, to help Tyrion figure out which Small Council member(s) were secretly reporting his plans to Cersei. Interestingly enough, Tywin later grants Harrenhal to Littlefinger *officially* for his role in brokering an alliance between Houses Lannister and Tyrell. ""The Lord of Harrenhal will make a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn,"" Tywin declares. 

During negotiations between House Frey and Robb Stark, the Frey representatives list Harrenhal as one of Walder's terms for re-establishing their alliance. Obviously, the Freys never had any intention of honoring this agreement, but it was a perfectly reasonable request from Robb's standpoint, and he agrees to grant Harrenhal to House Frey ""when we have no further strategic need for it.""

However, while Harrenhal has proven a decent place to temporarily garrison an army--both Tywin Lannister and Roose Bolton took advantage of this at various points--the structure is in a pretty sorry state otherwise. Tywin dismisses Harrenhal to Arya as a ""blasted ruin,"" and later calls it a ""useless pile of rubble,"" despite his reasoning at the very same meeting that Littlefinger having the title 'Lord of Harrenhal' under his belt would make him a suitable match for Lysa Arryn's husband.

It makes me wonder, does being Lord of Harrenhal give one control over much more land than the castle itself? Or is it just the most coveted fixer-upper in Westeros?",12,10,False,self,,,,,

""I have seen it in the flames, read of it in ancient prophecy. When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers, Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone.""

Doesn't this sound exactly like the scene of Drogo's cremation? The Dragons eggs were stone according to Illyrio, The ""bleeding star"" could just be the comet we saw during the episode. That scene could arguably be called Daenerys' rebirth scene as the mother of dragons. If that's the case then she was quite literally born amidst smoke and.....not sure where the salt is but i'm sure its there somewhere.

Fire: 
Its pretty damn obvious. You've got the Lord of Light, a mystical 'something' who has followers that go around lighting everything on fire. 

Dany Targarian, who has dragons, hangs out in a nice warm beach town, and goes around lighting everything on fire. 


Ice: 
The White Walkers

We're making a lot of assumptions about them. Vast army of the dead coming for all living things. A desire to get south of the wall. Obviously they're the big badguy, right? Well Mr. RR Martin is the king at destroying assumptions. The truth is, we don't actually know what the white walkers motives are. All we know about them is that they have an army of the dead, fought the wildlings, they were created by the children of the forest to fight off The Andalls, they don't like the 3-eyed raven, and they're generally pretty aggressive. 

The theory: Jon Snow teams up with the White Walkers and the army of the dead counters the dragons. 

I mean think about it. He's risen from the dead, he's already allied with an odd group from the north, his brother hangs out with the little green men, and his last name is SNOW for crap's sake. Also, the history and lore suggests that the oldest struggle in Westeros is the battle between North and South. This really rings true all the way up to Robert's Rebellion, War of 5 Kings, etc. KINGINDANORF!

In Season 3 we see a hapless Theon Greyjoy strapped to an X shaped cross, Crux Decussata or St. Andrew's Cross apparently for days. Indeed, House Bolton uses a flayed man upside down on a crux Decussata as their sigil and we've see them use them repeatedly for torture during the show's course. 

My understanding is that historically, being hung from a cross, be it shaped as a ""t"", ""T"", ""X"", ""Y"" or ""I"" is an eventual death sentence, flayed or not. Thankfully, Game of Thrones is not reality... but we do know that many have been crucified on a crux decussata throughout history, St. Andrew from Christianity probably most famously. 

I found this [article](https://archaeology-game-of-thrones.com/category/weapons/) on historical links Bolton torture, which briefly mentions their use of the crux decussata, but it is suggesting that being hung upside down puts the heart further away from the first incisions, likely prolonging their consciousness while being flayed. (Could use a fact check here as well...)

Would it be safe to assume that a captive would eventually expire of similar causes as a crucifixion victim if not at least taken down to rest every once and awhile? ",6,3,False,self,,,,,

But, I've been rewatching the series again and have noticed something in S06E05. During the second vision where Bran and the Three-eyed Raven are at Winterfell I spot the banners used in S06E09. So this led me thinking that those aren't new banners and are preferably old banners of the Starks before the War of the Five Kings.

Bran: The Wise Wolf, The Wolf Who Sees All, or the Three-Eyed Wolf.

Arya: The Night Wolf, The Dark Wolf, or The Silent Wolf.

Sansa kinda gets the shit end of the stick, but let's face it, as good a character as she is, none of her traits abide well to epic names as 'the ability to see and learn literally everything'  and 'the skills and magical abilities which enable you to assassinate just about anyone.'",30,11,False,self,,,,,

The reason why the Northern Lords seemed kind of quick to reinstate Jon is actually quite simple.

 The Red Wedding was not just the murder of Robb and Cat. It was a route of the entire southern Stark force. They killed all nobles in the Twins as well as the footmen celebrating outside in the camps as well the show made it pretty clear by showing ordinary Stark footmen dying too. The Red Wedding wasn't just an attack on the Starks, it was a betrayal to all of the North. The Boltons literally sided with the Lannisters, one of the mortal enemies of the North, to betray the Starks as well as their Northern bannermen that marched south with them. 

All the houses stood with the Starks EVEN AFTER Stannis's failure at black water, the Tyrells joining the Lannisters, and the Karstarks marching home. This shows clearly that none of the houses believed the war was lost because if they did, they would have marched back up North. Against overwhelming odds they stood strong with the Starks. The fact that they only actually lost the war when the Boltons betrayed them, means that it was really the Boltons who lost them the war. They never saw following the Starks into war as a blunder, because they believed they were going to win. They only actually saw defeat at the Boltons hands and thus should rightfully hate the Boltons. 

The reason no houses wanted to commit men to Jon's cause was probably because of fear of the Boltons as they are known for literally flaying their enemies. They also didn't believe that Jon was going to win and did not want to loose another war as much as they hated the Boltons. When Jon defeats Ramsay and takes back winterfell hes essentially avenging the North and all the houses that lost Lords, commanders, Bannermen and soldiers to the Bolton betrayal. They are willing to stand with Jon partially because he is half Stark but also because he stood up for justice. He stood up for the justice of all the houses that were betrayed at the red wedding. He was out numbered, out manned and fighting a scary enemy who literally tortures POW's but he did it and won. If that doesn't commend a great deal of respect then I don't know what does. 

Also, after Jon explained who the real enemy was I think they came to accept why he brought the wildlings south. They must have been hearing reports of WWs reappearing for some time now and with Jon Snow, an ex-commander of the watch and now deeply respected person for avenging their houses, coming forth and saying that these rumours and reports are true I think they very well understand that they are going to need all the help they can get for the upcoming war. And any living souls north of the wall is just fodder for their new enemy.

EDIT: A good point was made in the comments that Jon did take Winterfell by right of conquest and he has the right to take the lives of all the lords who refused his call. Rather than making an enemy of Jon they kneel to him instead. This is more evidence that the Northern Lords bowing to Jon made sense and wasn't poor writing.

Speaking of the offspring of Ned and Cat, Robb led The North against the captors and murderers of his fathers. Even though he failed and died, he never lost a battle and his pursuit of true love over duty and honor can be seen as positive. Jon, who is still a Stark bastard (Lyanna is a Stark), defended the sorry lot that inhabits the Seven Kingdoms against the dangers that lurk beyond The Wall, made peace with the Wildlings and freed The North from House Bolton. Bran is basically becoming one of the most powerful supernatural beings in Westeros which is pretty neat. Arya, even though her story in the recent episodes is kind of edgy in terms of sense and credibility, managed to survive alone in a world where stronger men died and is about to become a real threat for enemies of House Stark (possible substitute for LSH? I mean she would have no problem taking over the lead of The Brotherhood with the Hound joining them... okay tinfoil hat time is over). Rickon is a case of his own having accomplished basically nothing but on the other hand, he never did something wrong.

That cat is what leads Arya down to the room beneath the keep where the dragon's skulls are kept. 

Jump forward about a dozen chapters to when Ned is being held in the dungeon and Varys visits him. Varys tries to get Ned to confess and take the black, warning him with what would happen to his daughter. Varys then tells Ned an anecdote about Rhaenys Targaryen, who was killed for crimes her family committed, and goes on to note that she had a black kitten which she named Balerion. Varys wonders aloud what happened to the kitten and says he assumes it must have been killed when she was.

I don't think Balerion was killed. I think he escaped, probably having lost an ear. It would be impossible to confirm without GRRM explicitly saying so, but I bet that Balerion was the same cat that Arya tracked down and led her to the skull of the real Balerion.

&gt; *Weve talked about it. Its something Im not opposed to, but it has to make sense creatively. Im open to it. The guys arent opposed to it, but theres no concrete plans.*

---

Given that HBO dashed to Buzzfeed in an attempt to control the fallout of Bloys comments about the shows ending with a statement adding that he didnt really say for sure thats the endit seems like that messaging may refer to HBOs hopes for this spinoff rather than seeing more Game of Thrones beyond season eight.

If my theory is true then Jaqen encountering Arya was a deliberate act to lure Arya to the House of Black and White, not to train Arya to be a faceless man but to train the Waif to act like Arya.
If true then at the end, when Arya returns the Waif mask to the House of Black and White it's the Waif simply returning a mask that she doesn't need any more because she now has an Arya mask.

Which is a fair point.

I always had a soft spot for Tommen, he's younger brother of a sadist. It reminded me of the Hound getting his face mashed into the fire. Joffrey threatens to skin Ser Pounce, and I'd bet it wasn't an idle threat.

Joff dies, and Tommen ascends. I loved the scene between him and Tywin over Joff's corpse about what makes a great king. Joff didn't give the slightest shit, but Tommen pays close attention to Tywin (as Arya did in s2 as his cupbearer), recognizing he is genuinely smarter than himself and wanting to learn. Cersei hated this. I believe Tommen/Tywin would've been an amazing combo running Westeros, and often wonder if Tyrion sealed Tommen's fate when he killed Tywin. His grandfather wouldn't have let the faith militant gain power, unlike Cersei who encouraged it because she was jealous of Margery.

That final scene with Tommen is beautifully done. Cersei has taken his new faith and his wife away from him, and he knows she did it. She has chosen herself over him. He has absolutely no power, and it cost him everything in his young life. The way he takes off the crown, I feel that was the moment he decided to kill himself, and the way he walks out of frame to place the crown on a table (while the Sept burns in the center of the frame) really underscores his understated nature, that his final living action happens offscreen while Cersei's wrath dominates the visual scene.

Props to the foley team who had their moment to shine and nailed it. The soft ""du-dunk"" of the crown on the table, the moment of silence and then the footsteps leading up to the jump was perfectly done.",362,2856,False,self,,,,,

It's been mentioned multiple times, even in interviews with GRRM that GoT portrays the view that good and evil are very interchangeable; that evil can merely be good from another's perspective and that sometimes the what's good doesn't always portray itself as the great hero you expect. This is easily seen in the personalities of many characters in the show. 

Thinking about this, I wondered if maybe this theme applies to one of the biggest plot lines in the show. 

Since the beginning we see Robert Baratheon and the rebellion as the good triumphing over the evil Targaryen's and the Mad King. Mainly because Rhaegar apparently kidnapped and raped Lyanna Stark. I am not saying the Mad King was good but maybe the idea of good and evil during the rebellion is all wrong. From what I've heard from the show Rhaegar seemed to be a good person. It was said he would have been a good ruler, he would sing in the streets of kings landing and give the money to the poor. The only evidence we have heard of him raping Lyanna is from Robert (who was promised to marry her) and Ned (who needed to keep Jon's birthright a secret). Is it possible Robert is the bad guy here who spread rumours of rape and kidnap due to jealousy he had that Lyanna and Rhaegar were actually in love?

I was all about Jaime redeeming himself with Brienne's help (and you have to admit, losing his ability to kill anyone with his sword), but then the Riverrun siege happened and we learned Jaime's sole motivation is still his sister.

Sorry if it's been posted already or if it's common knowledge (I got into GoT only recently and haven't gotten around to the books, only the show) but I still think it's cool. 


The Mad King wasn't actually mad. Or at least, he didn't start out that way. The three eyed raven was attempting to enter the MK's mind (similar to but less successful than Bran's takeover of Hodor's mind) to warn him and prepare him for the return of the White Walkers. That's why the MK suddenly became obsessed with fire, and ordered the mass production of wildfire - the idea was planted in his head by the three eyed raven as defensive ammunition against the Walkers. The 'burn them all' mantra wasn't a sign of sadistic madness, it was the advice the 3ER was trying to get through to the MK on how to defeat the WW, which is why he was constantly repeating it. He must have heard it in his head all the time. 


But it was an imperfect takeover - the MK was not a half wit like Hodor and his mind could not be penetrated as completely (plus the 3ER may have been less powerful or naturally talented than Bran, but that's a little more subjective). So the repeat attempts by the 3ER to penetrate the MK's mind drove him mad and ultimately made things worse over better, as it set events in motion for Robert's Rebellion, ending the Targaryen dynasty who had long been considered masters of fire (plus of course there's the trappings of the dragons and Valyrian heritage - dragon glass, Valyrian steel, etc.) 


Things end up resolving themselves of course with Dany and Jon set to reclaim the Iron Throne just in time to lead Westeros in the Fire and Ice war, but still. I sometimes wonder how things might have gone if the 3ER had managed to successfully communicate to the MK what needed to be done, and avoided the war altogether. ",26,5,False,self,,,,,

**~Speculation for TWOW~ I recognize people think Meera picked it up during S6E5 but I'm not basing this speculation off of show knowledge THANKS**

IMO, it is likely that there will be a series of reveals/interactions with some of the great Valyrian Steel swords soon - Blackfyre with (f)Aegon via Illyrio, LSH confiscating Oathkeeper (half of Ice) from Lady Brienne, the possibility of Petyr having smuggled Widow's Wail (the other half of Ice) out of KL and it ending up in Sansa's hands, and Euron may have found some VS swords (mayhaps Brightroar?) while in Valyria.

I was wondering if Dark Sister, the second ancestral Targaryen sword belonging first to Queen Visenya, could end up in **Meera Reed's hands**. The last wielder of Dark Sister was Lord Brynden Rivers (Bloodraven aka Three Eyed Crow, one of Aegon IV's 'Great Bastards') and it's whereabouts have been unknown since the arrest of Lord Rivers and his banishment to the Wall, ordered by Aegon V (egg). 

My thinking is that with all the cunning, *sorcery*, and allies/spies/informants he had, it wouldn't be too big of a stretch to think that he could have gotten Dark Sister to the Wall with him after the arrest... if it had stayed in KL, surely another Targaryen prince would have wielded it since? - it would be befitting when he was serving as LC to have such a weapon. I would think he would have been carrying Dark Sister when he went on his 'last ranging' to eventually make a permanent home in the 'Cave of the Three-Eyed Crow'.

With shit eventually going to hit the fan with Bran and Co. north of the Wall with the Others (I for one hope they don't sit in the cave forever) , it would make perfect sense for Bran's primary protector to be in possession of a VS sword to protect him with... The prolific VS swords aren't played up as much in the show - I think they just wouldn't have bothered with anything like this in s6.

Another big reason I'm really excited about this possibility, is that, IMO, Dark Sister has some of the coolest history and has been wielded by serious bad-asses; Daemon Targaryen drove it through One-Eyed Prince Aemond's throat after leaping from Caraxes to Vhagar during the Battle above the God's Eye , then Aemon the Dargonknight used it while becoming one of the finest knights in recorded history, and finally it was wielded by the enigma that is Bloodraven, seeing much and more action including two duels with Aegor Rivers (Bittersteel, Bloodraven's half-brother, founder of the Golden Company).

Overall, I don't think it would be too big of a stretch - Dark Sister in Meera's possession would prove invaluable for the trials she and Bran will be subjected to in their arc, and it would be pretty bad-ass to see Meera fight with such a weapon against agents of the undead.

Anyways, thanks for reading my excited ramblings - I hope this isn't commonly posted about/an old subject of speculation for most of you. I'd love to hear your thoughts on the matter!

TLDR; could Meera get Dark Sister from Bloodraven after Bran and the gang are forced to flee/fight? ",36,16,False,self,,,,,

*

I like playing around with ideas a lot. Not necessarily *theories*, but ideas. One of the ideas I've been playing around with a lot during the past 2 weeks or so is the idea of Viserys Targaryen surviving the events of SE1 by, instead of losing his shit, escaping the Dothraki camp once they go back on their word with him. I realise how unlikely what I'm about to say is, since everyone seems to believe that magic participated in Daenerys being able to hatch her dragons, but I think Viserys stealing a single Dragon egg (lets just say Viserion's egg) before escaping the Dothraki, then seeing both Targaryens hatch their Dragons during the same night (possibly) could've lead to *soooo* many missed opportunities.


Similar to the Baratheon situation in SE2, or the Greyjoy situation in SE6 (the Greyjoy's being split between Yara I Greyjoy, and Euron III Greyjoy) I think it would've been interesting to see house Targaryen have 2 claimants to the throne. Daenerys, who'd basically more-or-less still take the same route she did as in the show, using her two dragons to become a chain breaking Khaleesi saint. And Viserys, who'd use his own dragon and ""birthright"" as rightful heir to house Targaryen and to the Iron Throne to convince The Masters, as well as any other new enemies Daenerys is now making, to fight on his side. This would not only give Viserys forces to work with, more context and reasoning to the Masters rebelling in the later seasons, as well as the assassination attempts by The Son of the Harpy, but it'd also give The Masters somebody to actually rally behind, an actual **antagonist** and **threat** for Daeny. This would only give her more of a reason to want to deal with the uprisings in all of her cities. Having Viserys, someone who could very well be a **very** big threat and still make a claim to the throne, re-emerge with a dragon, the massive support of The Masters, and a massive fleet already on his side and heading to Mareen would've given more weight to the situation. Having Viserys attack Daenerys in Mareen, **literally unleashing the dragon on her**, would've just made the battle even better in my opinion.


A lot of people complain that Daenerys doesn't have a main antagonist. This makes people feel like a lot of the battles she fights, and a lot of the stuff she survives, although awesome and cool and exc, exc, to watch somehow feels *empty*. Like there's no real **risk**, no real **enemy**. That she just has random people who don't like her attack her from time to time. Having Viserys be alive and command the armies of The Masters, having him supporting the assassination attempt by The Son of the Harpy, giving Viserys a Ramsey Bolton-esc side story would probably be able to fix this issue very well. Instead of Viserys dying by having some gold melted on his head, it would've been cooler if we saw Rhaegal burn and kill Viserys or something. Having Viserys die like that and having Daenerys **gain** Viserion (and of course throwing a Dragon reunion party) after the battle could also potentially fix the issue of *""Daenerys doesn't earn anything she gets""* problem some people complain about. Or maybe Viserys wins the battle of Mareen, killing Daenerys, leaving us with another Robb Stark level of ""no way"" on our hands. I don't know. Having Viserys alive and in this situation leaves a lot of possibilities and different outcomes open to debate.

*

This is just a theory-ish opinion piece though. Maybe a bad one, maybe a good one, I don't know. What do you guys think? Do you like the idea of Viserys being a dragon riding badass antagonist, would you be onboard with it if this happened? Are you already with how things already played out? Do you hate this idea?

However after reading AWOIAF, at least through all the Targaryen kings, it doesn't really point out blatant madness. The toss a coin thing to me is more of just a way of pointing out that half of them were terrible rulers. Even Viserys doesn't seem full blown mad or even fringing upon it just a terrible person.

The Season 6 Soundtrack is amazing, and although I believe it is the most consistently fantastic soundtrack of the series, it does not contain my favorite track. My favorite track, without a doubt, is ""You Are No Son of Mine"" from Season 4. ""You Are No Son of Mine"" played after Tywin's death (and it continued through the scenes where we see Varys, Tyrion prepare to leave Westeros), and I feel that it perfectly captures the solemnity of the series. The track (which you could split up to three parts) is just perfect:

Part 1: A more somber rendition of ""The Rains of Castamere"" that slowly and smoothly transitions into Part 2.

Part 2: A very beautiful and sorrowful instrumental version of the main theme.

Part 3: The exact same as Part 2 (the main theme), although it is vocal instead of instrumental. The vocals add a great elegance and magnificence, which of course is complimented by the already fantastic melody of the main theme.

I have no idea how the series is going to end, but if is ""bittersweet"" as GRRM says it will be, then I think that ""You Are No Son of Mine"" would be the perfect piece to play to finish off the series (at leasts Parts 2 and 3, as Part 1 is Lannister-specific). The track evokes feelings of sadness, but it also brings about slight feelings of hope and optimism. It's a masterpiece.

They're all just spokes on a wheel. This one's on top, then that one's on top. And on and on it spins, crushing those on the ground.

So I was thinking about [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0K14HBSWw0) on S05E08 and the part where Dany says she's going to ""break the wheel"". Since we can pretty much assume *the wheel* is an allegory for the systematic opression of the smallfolk (the spokes on the wheel being the great houses of Westeros), what does Dany mean specifically by ""breaking the wheel""? 

We can see she has already ""broken the wheel"" before, in Astapor, Yunkai and Meereen. Here she abolished slavery and adopted policies that favored the poor, especially former slaves (or at least intended to do so). She ostracized the great families of Meereen by leaving them in the sidelines of the city's governance and actively fought against them by locking up their leaders and [outright executing them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpCocBknqWI). In Slavers' Bay, the wheel was slavery and the aristocracy, constantly spinning and crushing the poor and the slaves and all those who don't have a coin to pay for their freedom and wellbeing. 

But ending with the foundation of a millenary society such as the old cities of Ghis was not easy: from the moment Daenerys took Astapor to her departure to Westeros she faced harsh opposition from those she deposed, costing her close allies and at times even her own life. She had to sacrifice a lot to rule a Meereen without slavery, and then some to keep Astapor and Yunkai slavery-free as well. 

This takes us to Westeros. Westeros doesn't have slavery and never has, yet class oppression still exists in the form of **feudalism**. In a feudal society the lords own the land and the further down you go in the social hierarchy the less favored you are: smallfolk make up for the greatest casualties in wars they don't start, and in many cases, don't fight. Entire villages can be sacked and there's very little you can do without a title next to your name. But feudalism is a very stable system to organize your society, it has stood in place in Westeros for literally thousands of years. Kind of like slavery in Meereen, Astapor, and Yunkai, except Westeros is a whole hecking continent and Slavers' Bay was just three cities in the desert. Three big cities with a lot of gold, yes, but three cities nonetheless.

So is feudalism Westeros' wheel? Is this the system she wants to end? If it is, then Dany's up for a big challange. The only way she can hope to conquer and rule the Seven Kingdoms is with the help of at least some of the great houses of Westeros: she's already got the Tyrells and Martells (Sand Snakes??) by her side. Is she just going to take the Iron Throne and go ""well, thanks for the help guys, but you're all just spokes on a wheel. Gotta implement my utopian classless society. Hope you don't mind"". That would be a terrible decision of she intends to keep that throne of hers. She could always pull an Aegon V and be super-friendly to the smallfolk, but it's not like this would change much. Aegon V was only as benign to the lower classes as he could without having all the lords of Westeros revolt against him. And this doesn't look like what Dany hopes to achieve: she wants to erradicate the problem from its root. It would be really interesting to see, but I don't see ""Queen Daenerys"" being a thing for too long if that's her methodology. 

Or maybe I'm looking too much into a metaphor and she'll be thrilled to keep the status quo of the Seven Kingdoms' social organization despite it being against everything she stands for. Who knows.

Arryn is on the brink of destruction, Martell is gone, Tyrell will be gone soon, Baratheon seems to be gone, and there is a scenario where Lannister could be eliminated. Not to mention the Boltons, potentially the Umbers and Karstarks and potentially other norther houses. 

To clarify, I believe this all could happen, but it's crazy that this didn't happen sooner. It seems so easy to eliminate a family line, and unless there are cousins, aunts, or uncles that the show is glossing over, all of these houses survived so long just to be killed easily in several chaotic vengeful plots. That is sort of implying that this is the most vengeful time ever. Perhaps it is with the lack of a strong central ruler, but I'm curious if this is just me.",15,3,False,self,,,,,

He was thinking that Jon will become the Night's King to form a peace treaty and that someone may have to rip the dragonglass out of the NK's chest to destroy him and the rest of his army. Very interesting.

So here where my theory comes to play. What if NK wants to ultimately transfer his self into Jon's body? We seen last season how NK was regarding Jon with alot of interest. He may be able to tell that he is a Stark and Targ. Someone with great power inside him. Possibly more then himself. So how will this all go down? 

During the huge battle between humanity and White Walkers, the NK stops the killing for awhile to talk about a peace deal. He demands Jon to meet him. Jon goes unaware of the Night King's true agenda..which is to take over Jon. So Jon and the NK battle it out a bit, he doesn't really want to harm Jon but he plays along to amuse him and then knocks him out and ties him up. The NK has created a barrier of his own around the ritual area. I'm thinking something cool like ""ice fire"" some try and get through it but die in the process. Nobody has an idea what to do, Melisandre tries but fails. Dragon fire is able to create some weakness but not enough for someone to get through without burning to death. Dany gets the idea to envelop herself with dragonfire from all three of her dragons and walks right through. She sees Jon tied up and rushes to free him but comes across NK, he tries to turn her into a Whitewalker but fails. Dany tries to stab him but he knocks her around. Jon gets freed through finally realizing the power inside himself. He is just in time to save Dany by thrusting his fist into the Night King's chest and takes out the shard of dragonglass.",5,2,False,self,,,,,

He is a mute, and is described as being a very curious young boy, and ""learning quickly"". When Ramsay sacks Winterfell, Wex somehow manages to evade capture, and ends up following the Stark boys and their companions, somehow without the direwolves ever noticing. When they separate, he decides to follow Rickon and Osha, rather than Bran and the others. He follows them until they leave the mainland by boat, and a little while later he shows up at White Harbor, where he eventually informs Lord Manderly of Rickon's whereabouts. 

He's awfully good at moving around unseen (Theon complains that Wex seems to appear out of nowhere sometimes, and that he often forgets that Wex is in the room with him), tracking and following without being noticed, hiding, and overhearing information. 

We know that Varys' ""little birds"" are *everywhere* (even in the Citadel), so presumably he would have some on the Iron Islands (and Wex is a mute child from the largest town on the Iron Islands, he'd be a pretty good candidate), and presumably Varys would be quite interested in following Theon's movements, when's he's causing havoc in the North on behalf of King Balon.

Let's assume he is one of the little birds. When Wex pops up again in White Harbor, it would be the first time in a long while that he would have had an opportunity to relay information back to Varys. And when Wex is brought to Lord Manderly, who is with Davos at the time, he doesn't exactly seem to be brought there as a prisoner. He's not in chains, there's no mention of capture or questioning, and he seems pretty willing to tell them information (through yes or no questions) as well. Lord Manderly seems to be quite fond of the boy. Wex isn't uncomfortable, he's cheerful, and happily does what he's ordered by Davos and Wyman (which seems odd, for an Ironborn). 

Could Wex be one of the little birds? Could Varys have told him to turn himself in, to help the Manderlys in their efforts against the Boltons and the Freys, and keep the North in chaos? ",4,14,False,self,,,,,

I think the Dothraki will probably end up going back to their home in Essos after the war, just with their culture changed because of the influence of Westeros and Daenerys (who would probably be a huge heroic figure in their culture for centuries to come if she helps them conquer another continent).

So he arranged a massive tournament at Harrenhal, which all the great lords of the realm would attend (except Tywin Lannister who was having a sulk), in order to hold a Great Council and get consensus on deposing the Mad King. However, Varys found out about the plan and told the Mad King, who then turned up at the tournament himself and prevented the plan from going ahead.

Because of this, the realm was torn apart by the king's madness, resulting in the blood and carnage of Robert's Rebellion and all the problems ever since.

Anyways, this stems from the if you could revive one character, who would it be and why thread. Going to go into a bit more expanded and in detail of the response I had from there, because I thought it was interesting and well I have no new book to read and no new show to watch so I am bored...


It goes a little something like this :

Robert Baratheon on his death bed makes a miraculous recovery, there are murmurs of black magic.  A follow of R'hollor says the God of Light wished it so... Others say a strange healer showed up in the final minutes and pulled a mircale, saying ""Life must pay for life..."", many rumors abound. One thing remains Robert Baratheon is alive and breathing again.

- Ned reveals to Robert the evidence that his children are not his, but likely that of Jaimie Lannister. This is what Jon Arryn had found and why he was killed. After a heated argument, Robert accepts these claims.

- Cersei and her children had fled the city, after Robert recovered, she realized she had played her final hand and for the safety of her children fled Robert's wrath. She flees to Lannisport via ship.

- Robert dispathes ravens to Casterly Rock demanding that Tywin Lannister turns over Cersei and the children.

- Robert realizing he has no heir is brought Gendry, the spitting image of a young Robert. He legitimizes the boy so that he has an heir.

- Sansa and Gendry Baratheon are promised to wed each other.

- Tywin Lannister who at this point was already preparing for war, begins to move.

- Ned Stark sends ravens to Robb Stark to call their banners.

- House Tully calls their banners.

- The Tyrells call their banners for the King.

- The Crown Lands call their banners.

- The Stormlands call their banners.

- Dragonstone calls their banners. 

- Iron Islands remain neutral. (Will likely still seize the opportunity to begin to raid and rebel again) 

- The Vale remains neutral. (Depending on what Petyr Baelish's next play is, this may change) 

- Dorne calls the everloving shit out of it's banners. A chance to kill Lannisters!? The Dornish army arrives at the battlefield just all awkwardly and incredibly fully erect at the thought of killing Lannisters. Oberyn at this point doesn't even have a spear, he just has a gigantic erection with a spearshead attached.

- The Lion's Rebellion begins. It's a bloody and vicious war, but albeit a short one. Tywin no matter how great and smart is ultimately killed. Cersei kills herself and Myrcella, Joffrey is killed attempting to shoot people with a crossbow, Tommen is captured. Jaimie Lannister is killed by Barristan Selmy at the second battle of the Trident, along with most of the Lannister army and most of the cousins of the various Lannisters. The Lannister name is essentially extinguished. Kevan Lannister surrenders and takes the black. The rains weep o'er their hall for not a soul to hear.

- The Night's Watch sends word of strange tidings. With Ned in place, a true man of the north, a believer of the Old Gods. Their word has a lot more weight. Men and reinforcements are sent, Ned Stark rides north after the Lion's Rebellion to deal with Mance Rayder.

- Ned and Jon have the talk. Jon Snow, secretly remains Jon Targaryen. 

- Ned brings back proof of the others to King's Landing. They prepare to deal with the threat of the Others.

- Daenerys Targaryen dies via manticore, as Barristan Selmy never leaves Westeros and is thus unable to save her. RIP to Dany.

- Aegon does not attempt his invasion, as the land currently stands as one fist and not five fingers. Not quite easy for the taking. I would assume they go after the Dragons, seeing them as the keys to the Kingdom. At this point they have probably killed and escaped any masters they had.


That is a brief summary of what I think would happen had Robert never died expanded from my comment. Obviously, more will happen after that, but that is all I could reasonably take a guess at. Anything outside of that, such as what happens to Danys dragons or what happens to Jon Targaryen, I don't have an accurate assessment of for this version of events.

Edit : Tyrion is Tyrion and is ultimately far too hard to predict. He might worm his way out and make his way to Essos with a pile of gold. He might talk them into sparring him for some purpose. He might get killed, in battle, in a siege, by Bronn when the gold runs out, in a random tavern by a whore he offends.

Others have speculated that Shireen's sacrifice was what ultimately enabled Jon Snow to be revived.

Both valid opinions. However, there's a key detail that's easy to overlook, and I can say that because it didn't occur to me until about a year later when I started thinking about it.

Consider this: the fact that the heavy snows in the North melted so quickly is a strong implication that sacrificing Shireen, on some level, actually *worked.*

If we're to go by Melisandre's rationale, the Lord of Light did not predestine Stannis to rule the Seven Kingdoms *or* to act as a modern-day Azor Ahai. However, the Lord of Light did accept the sacrifice of Shireen (who possessed 'King's Blood') as sufficient to rapidly melt the snows and allow Stannis's army to press on.

This suggests that the Lord of Light recognizes the legitimacy of the Royal Baratheon line, right? This in and of itself is quite interesting because Baratheon kings and would-be kings are a relatively new phenomenon. As the series opens, House Baratheon has only held the Iron Throne for about 20 years, after ousting a Targaryen dynasty that had ruled Westeros for centuries.

Does that mean that the Lord of Light now regards House Targaryen's royal claim to be illegitimate? Possibly, but it's hard to see why an omnipotent being would be so interested in the outcome of what is, again, relatively speaking, a small civil war.

Here's another possibility: prior to the Targaryen conquest and unification of the modern day Seven Kingdoms, many of the 'Great Houses' conducted themselves as royal families of their respective regions, and styled themselves kings and queens. Among others, this includes House Stark, House Bolton, House Lannister, and...

...House Baratheon! Regardless of how legitimate the Lord of Light regards Stannis Baratheon's claim, the blood of the bygone 'Storm Kings' runs through his veins--and by extension, through his daughter's veins as well.

If it was the blood of the 'Storm Kings,' rather than that of 'King Stannis' specifically, that provided Shireen with the valuable resource of 'King's Blood,' doesn't that mean that every Stark, Lannister, Targaryen, or what have you could possess King's Blood as well, thereby making them strong candidates to be sacrificed in this way?

Deja-vu... When Robb captured Jaime, Jaime challenged Robb to the EXACT same one-on-one duel, with nearly identical language. And Robb wisely declined, saying ""We're not doing it your way."" (and of course we all thought ""good choice Robb""). 

The bigger point: Both Robb and Ramsay were good at ""strategy."" (Until Robb screwed his strategy by breaking his his word to the Freys.)

It's Renly Baratheon. Renly had absolutely no right to the throne, and he acknowledged that. Stannis the Mannis was the rightful heir. He only claimed it because people liked him more than Stannis and he thought he could be a better king, basically he was arrogant and selfish.

Here's how things could have gone down if Renly supported his older brothers claim to the throne instead of declaring himself king:

1. The Tyrell's side with Stannis, not Tywin Lannister, ensuring Stannis wins the Battle of the Blackwater.
2. In the sack of King's Landing, the Lannisters are essentially wiped out. Tywin, Tyrion, Joffrey, Tommen and Cersei all die. 
3. The Mannis takes the Iron Throne.
4. Stannis immediately ends the war with the North, he has no quarrel with Robb Stark and once the North pledges fealty, he begins to focus on the real enemy.
5. Stannis beefs up the Night's Watch and the Wall, making them extremely well prepared for the Wildling assault, as well as the White Walkers.
6. The White Walkers are defeated.
7. With the Seven Kingdoms united, Daenerys has no strength or allies in Westeros, and her rebellion is beaten back.
8. Happily ever after until Stannis' death, and then all hail Queen Shireen Baratheon, First of Her Name.

That was my plan all along"".

Egregious examples are the villain in Skyfall, whose plan relies on Bond always being at the right place at the right time and doing the right thing in the exact right way. Urggh. Nobody can foresee that, and rather than thinking ""This villain is super smart"" we think ""This plot is full of convenient coincidences"". 

On the other hand, we have Littlefinger. Later in the show, we learn that he was behind the murder of Arryn, and behind the attempt to have Brann murdered and the Lannisters blamed. He's also involved in the murder of Joffrey in an attempt to get at Sansa, etc. etc.

But: It is very clear that he is just someone who is incredibly adept at dealing with chaos, and doesn't have 100% control over what will happen. And I'm very grateful that we have no ""You gotta be kidding me"" moments. For example: Sure, he used Tyrion's dagger to have the Lannisters blamed for the assassination attempt on Brann, but he didn't know how it would pan out. I'd have flipped my shit if he somehow had known that: Tyrion's gonna travel to the Wall and back, will run into Lady Stark, who will capture him to take him to the Eyre, where he'll find a champion to win the Trial by Combat for him.

He doesn't appear to have any super-intricate long con going on, he just knows that whenever shit goes sideways, he'll find a way to go upwards. Caosh ish a ladder, my friends.",41,72,False,self,,,,,

It really needed to grow on me. But now I can't wait for the new season to come out and I enjoy reading all the theories and comments here a lot. 
So when I decided to give the books a try - because why not - and I really did not like them at first I thought ""well the show took me a while, too."" so I waited some time and tried them again, read the first book, and the second but eventually I had to stop because it just wouldn't click. And I think I know why: It's just too much of everything. 

Too much names, too much backstory, too much characters and relatives and knights and ladies and hidden plot lines and scheming and...well, everything. It really annoyed me at some point. I know that GRR Martin tries to be as realistic as possible and all and I know a lot of you people like that, but honestly: I don't think that all these details are needed for the story. 

I am really glad that the show leaves a lot of this out and reduces the story to some vital parts. For me, thats much more enjoyable. And actually - I really don't care if this is making the show more ""unrealistic"" or ""takes out some deep background that was in the books"". I don't need a tv show thats all realistic - actually, if that was the standard I could rarely watch anything. I enjoy the show for what it is. ",21,0,False,self,,,,,

I thought the most interesting of them was Rhaegar Targaryen.

So the whole point of the last experiment, was the chain of events if you changed one thing. So we will keep this in mind in this one. As there are basically several points where this timeline can diverge. Let's go by them in chronological order.


**Rhaegar Targaryen declares Elia Martell the Queen of Love and Beauty**

- Lyanna Stark does not runaway with Rhaegar Targaryen

- The Starks don't ride south to ask for her release from Aerys and are thusly not executed.

- Brandon Stark marries Catelyn Tully

- Robert Baratheon marries Lyanna Stark

- Jon Snow is never born, nor is Robb Stark, Bran, Arya, or Sansa

- Petry Baelish is never appointed to a position in Gulltown and is never able to rise above that position. He is not taken to King's Landing to be Master of Coin.

- Cersei is married off to Viserys Targaryen, they live on Dragonstone far from Jaimie, a man crueler and more demented than she could have hoped for... Viserys is known by some as the valonqar to Rhaegar. She lives a sad life and has three still born children, the last takes her with it.

- Jaimie becomes distraught over his sister death and drunk and near mad, attacks Viserys. He kills two handful of men, while drunk and staggering, before a spear is stuck through his belly and spine. (Okay, these last two things were far fetched, but fuck this storyline was so boring. I needed some spice)

- Aerys eventually dies, I mean he probably does a lot of Mad King shit in between, but death comes for everyone eventually. Not going to be entirely surprised if he dies in a similar fashion to Jon Arryn in the books.

- Rhaegar inherits and takes over the Kingdom.

- It is known as a good reign

- Everything is pretty boring.


**Rhaegar Targaryen declares Lyanna Stark as the Queen of Love and Beauty, but they don't abscond**

- It's pretty controversial, Lyanna tells her family of her wishes to go with Rhaegar Targaryen. Targaryen's have taken two wives before so there is precedent. Everyone is pretty upset, including the Martells, the Starks, and the Baratheon's, but it isn't rebellion worthy.

- Lyanna dies in child birth, giving birth to Bran Targaryen. The boy is raised in King's Landing and is raised alongside Aegon Targaryen. They are extremely close friends. However, with his Mother not around. Elia Martell is constantly scornful and shows much hatred to Bran Targaryen. A Night's Watch recruiter regales him of tales of the Night's watch. However, his tutor and close friend Barristan Selmy has made him very much long to be a King's Guard.

- Robert is given a new wife to appease him, a highborn lass of a prominent family.

- Most everything is the same as above.

- Rhaegar Targaryen is forever broken from the death of his one true love Lyanna Stark. He is never the same. He begins to drink, eat, and fuck his way to an early grave. He puts the realm in severe debt. Elia Martell is forever hateful of Rhaegar. Their relationship forever turned sour. Rhaegar is eventually killed on a hunt by a wild boar.

- Aegon Targaryen takes the throne. Bran Targaryen is named to the King's Guard.

- It's pretty boring stuff.

**Rhaegar Targaryen defeats Robert Baratheon in single combat at the battle of the Trident**

So here is the issue with this one. Some would say this is exactly where this whole thing could get turned around, but remember the whole point is we change one aspect. Not many. If Rhaegar Targaryen kills Robert Baratheon it would not break his Army the same way it broke Rhaegar Targaryen's.

Rhaegar was the only thing tying his army together, they were Royalists. Watching the only Royal they would follow die, broke them. Lewyn Martell was already dead at this point and the Dornish flank was being overran. A lot of Rhaegar's bannermen were already killed at this point. Rhaegar's death was the final nail in the coffin of that battle. Killing Robert, and you may disagree, would just prolong the battle, but ultimately there were still more rebels and more rebel leaders. So I would have to change several things for this outcome. However, since the other two were so boring let's roll with it.

- Rhaegar Targaryen kills Robert Baratheon in single combat. The antlers broken off his helmet float down the river. It forever becomes known as the Ford of the Broken Antler.

- Lewyn Martell slays Lyn Corbay and leads the Dornish to charge the Rebel flank.

- Barristan Selmy cuts through the rebel lines and manages to kill Jon Arryn.

- The Royalist army is spurred on by Rhaegar's victory in single combat. 

- Seeing the battle lost, Ned Stark begins to flee back to the North.

- He manages to take his Army back to the north, where using the secrets of Howland Reed they are able to lose their pursuers.

- So begins a very prolonged Northern Campaign. 

- Unable to pierce through the Neck, the Royalist army retreats and begins to build an invasion fleet.

- Rhaegar not wishing to destroy the family of his true love Lyanna, sues for peace with Aerys. The Mad King demands all of their heads, he wants all of the North to burn. He demands the riverlands and the Vale, who have surrendered and bent the knee at this point, be burnt to the ground as well. Vaerys tries to council him out of this, but the Mad King can not be persuaded. He even wants the Riverland and Vale houses who did not enter the fray be destroyed.

- The Mad King dies peacefully in his sleep for a sickness that took him quickly. 

- Rhaegar Targaryen is declared King.

- Ravens carrying peace terms are sent to the North. The terms dictate that Ned Stark will call off the rebellion and bend the knee, in doing so he will remain Warden of the North. Rhaegar is not his father, he wishes for peace. The Northern campaign will be brutal for both sides. The North is a harsh place and the Northerners can defend it with a guerrilla campaign for a very long time.

- Lyanna dies in child birth. Her body is returned to Winterfell per the peace terms. 

- Ned seeing no other option, keeps the peace.

----------------------------------------------

That was fun to write about, although a bit silly. Honestly, we'd be left with a very boring story if Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen don't abscond.

Also, a lot of stuff I just sort of wrote for the fun of it, such as Rhaegar following the same path as Robert.

It was a lot more unpredictable as well, because I didn't have a lot of basis of the events. I had to go off past history of things that were said by characters about what was intended for them before the rebellion.

I also, took a hard look at the battle of the trident and the description on it's wiki and by many of the characters.

This was fun and a lot more loosely based than Robert's living. Let me know what you think or what you would think would happen?",21,27,False,self,,,,,

King Robert Baratheon and his caravan ride into Winterfell. The town is stirring with excitement but Ned knows what the king will ask of him.

Robert B: ""Ned, I need you to be my new Hand of the King"".

Ned: ""Apologies my lord, but I must gracefully decline. I would suggest your brother Lord Stannis The Mannis"".

Robert B: (stares grimly at Ned)

Robert and the caravan pack their things and begin riding back south to Kings Landing. Bran runs along side the caravan waving as they exit the gates of Winterfell.

If you remember in the episode ""The wars to come"" we see a young Cersei Lannister talking with Maggy, a witch and fortune teller, who tells to Cersei about her future. she said she ""wouldn't marry ""the Prince"" but ""the King"", and while the king would have twenty sons, she would bear only three children who will wear golden crowns as well as golden shrouds."" Finally, she revealed to Cersei that ""although she would indeed be Queen, she would be cast down by another, younger and more beautiful queen."" (thanks GoT wiki for the words!).

The thing is, most of us thinked that this younger and awesome queen should have been Margaery Tyrell. We all know what happened to her in the end of Season 6. So who will fullfill the prophecy? The first choice i have is Daenerys. she looks more beautiful and is younger than Cersei, and has a lot of power in her hands.

Weiss for pairing my two favorite characters in the entire series: Tyrion Lannister and Daenerys Targaryen together. When I first started watching the series, it was when Season 4 had just finished its finale and when I had gotten to that point all I think to myself was: I want Tyrion and Daenerys to meet!! 

Because the show has multiple different settings, most of our favorite characters don't really get to meet each other (depending on what location they are in). I will admit, I never really thought that Tyrion and Daenerys would cross paths but I was hoping for it and when they started to promote the meeting between the two, it was number one on my anticipation list for what to expect in Season 5! I still remember cheering when the two finally interacted in ""The Gift"" and I was too happy and hyped watching the two having a one on one conversation alone in ""Hardhome"".  It was so hard to believe that this was actually happening right in front of my eyes, finally knowing how the two would measure up to one another.

Their relationship was EXACTLY how I had imagined it would be. Although I was expecting a little bit of bickering between the two, I still liked it better when the two just had a mutual respect for one another. I never realized how much they had in common until they spent more time together. Tyrion is the brother Daenerys should've had, while at the same time Daenerys is the sister Tyrion should've had. The more you see them together, the more you can tell that they have a brother-sister type of bond and I absolutely LOVE it. Hopefully the A+J=T theory is confirmed, so that it is revealed that they are in fact half-siblings. Their chemistry met my high expectations, and I couldn't be more happy now that these two are a team.

Another thing I love about their pairing, is that the two meeting wasn't just a one time event that they'll probably never see each other again unless they somehow manage to cross paths again in the future; 3-4 seasons later. They actually became a part of both of their storylines, and now Tyrion is her Hand of the Queen (meaning he's not leaving her side anytime soon, unless one of them dies before the other).

Edit: I love how the showrunners have handled incorporating fan service into the series, without making it affect the show and keeping it consistent to the story they are telling. They make it work while keeping it professional and worth the watch.

I can't wait to see more of these two together in the final two seasons, what do you think about the pairing between Tyrion and Daenerys? What are your thoughts?",38,31,False,self,,,,,

With Sam off in the Citadel learning about how to fight the WW's, he will inevitably stumble upon the fact that Valyrian Steel is key. If Jon doesn't already know anyways, which he probably has an idea. Well anyway, with this knowledge Sam will need to learn how to forge Valyrian Steel. Here he will learn that dragon fire is required.

The Westeros/Essos Sphinx was the riddle according to Aemon Targaryen...  The Essos Sphinx's were put there to throw us off the trail.  GRRM and his books basically canned the idea of a centaur as the male Essos Sphinx (basically four legged dragons with two wings do not exist).  The Westeros Sphinx is the answer, but it was twisted by the Maesters to hide the truth.

The Westeros Sphinx alludes to four parts- head of a king, body of a lion, tail of a serpent, and wings of an eagle.  At first glance, using ""the Dragon has three heads"" we might think the lion/eagle is a griffon- it's not.

The answer lies with the four flames... Green, blue, orange, and black.  These colors are backed up with references to dragon behavior/discrepancies and some real world examples.  GRRM likes to use color to designate materials in Planetos with properties very similar to our world.

Green Fire (wildfire):

Thought to be related to dragon fire.  The clue is ""death comes out of a dragon, but probably does not enter.""  The origin of green fire in our world is phosphorous.  Phosphorus used to be collected from guano... Bat crap.  Bats are associated with one place above all- Harrenhal.  Harrenhal was built by Harren the Black- the biggest castle in Westeros.  He was Aegon's first target...  We can infer through the story that Harrenhal was technologically advanced for its time, and was ""thought"" to dabble in blood magic.  Balerion burnt Harrenhal during the night with fire ""so hot"" it melted stone.  The towers looked like ""lit candles"".  Big bats, lots of guano, and you can create some massive heat.  The family was wiped out, and it appears a lot of material was moved to King's Landing- most likely to the Red Keep.  The builders of the Red Keep were slaughtered upon completion.  Now, the commonalities of bats and dragons...

-leather wings, short necks, bat-like movement on the ground, and a ""controlled birthing mechanism"", basically bats only give birth when it's summer/fall and food sources (magic) are ripe.  They are also nocturnal and mistakenly ""thought"" to be attracted to light/heat.

2. Blue Fire- this was kind of tricky....

The only reference we have to ""blue fire"" is the story Varys told to Tyrion about being cut ""root to stem"" and burned.  We are not told what was said, but the answer lies somewhere else... Leave that for last.  To get a ""pure blue flame"" in the real world- you have to burn natural gas.  Natural gas is produced from vegetation that is packed on top of itself over and over without fully decaying.  The best spot to find natural gas is in swamps or bogs... (We have lots of natural gas in Louisiana).  Now in Planetos- the only swamps we know of is where Howland Reed is located.  House Reed has an interesting banner depicting a ""lizard lion"" which at first glance sounds like an alligator, but lizard lion actually refers to something else...  ""Lizard Lion"" is a westerosi Komodo dragon.  First- a lizard lion is the ""King of Lizards- a monster"".  Godzilla- spewed blue flame and was thought to be a Komodo dragon mutated by radiation.  Now for real world comparisons of biology.  Both dragons and Komodo's lay eggs, can change sex or have asexual birth.  Lizard-like appearance, and two sacs attached to the bottom jaw that can inject poison/fire.  They are also exclusively meat-eaters- especially carrion or dead animals.  They also seem to grow in size or shrink based on their environment.  They can also be cannibalistic...

3. Orange fire- or an everyday old house fire.  Hard to nail this one down at first, but then I smacked my head when it clicked- enter Syrio Forel's story of the ""orange tabby cat""- a magnificent beast said by most, but Syrio had seen that cat a thousand times- it's ears narled off, fat from the masters table.""  Dragon/cat biological comparison: the cat counters the ""blindness of bats/lizards"" and gives agility and dexterity to the dragon... along with a long tail.  Dragons are said to be trainable, but ""untamable"".  They are typically friendly to only one owner, but can turn on anyone.  The ancestor of both seems to hail from Yi-Ti/Ashaai.

So, we have the three heads of the dragon: bat (wings), cat (body), and tail (lion-lizard), but we still need ""blood""....

Enter the final ""flame""- the Flame of Balerion- the Black Dread.  The clue lies with the guard's description to Arya about the cat- Balerion... that cat is the real king, old and mean as hell.  The voice of the blue flame was brought forth by the blood of Varys- a Blackfyre.  The sword Blackfyre was given to a bastard- the true king.  We can corroborate this with remembering Westerosai (England's) original Conquerer- Aegon (William) the Conquerer... Previously known as Aegon/William the Bastard.

We can further corroborate this with the owner of ""Balerion"" the cat- Rhaella Targaryen- the first born child Rhaegar... or as we also know of her- the waif.   A first-born child of a father who sacrificed 2/3rds of his family for Jon.  Rhaegar is the bastard of his mother and Lwellyn Martell.",5,1,False,self,,,,,

That would fit in with the prophecy of Maggy the Frog, who had told Cersei, ""Queen you shall be... until there comes another, younger and more beautiful, to cast you down and take all that you hold dear"". What could be more dear to Cersei than Jaime (and of course, given that she lusts for power, the iron Throne as well now)? 

I am guessing Jamie being disillusioned with what happened at King's Landing might return to Casterly Rock in the beginning of Season 7, and Tyrion as Dany's Hand would push Dany for a marriage with Jamie as that would give her control of the formidable Lannister army. This seems to have been foreshadowed in the show when Dany herself had spoken (to Daario) of the need to enter into political marriages to secure her position in Westeros, in S06, E10. A marriage with Jamie would be necessitated perhaps by (I am guessing here), the attack on her forces by Euron Greyjoy depleting her forces substantially. Remember again, that Euron has the dragonbinder with him. That is not without significance, and as we know the show has been full of foreshadowings. Now that Yara Greyjoy has allied with Dany, Euron, would be left with no choice but to seek an alliance with Cersei, perhaps even by way of marriage. Cersei may be forced to acquiesce to marrying Euron in order to secure her position after Jamie has left her to go to Casterly Rock.

I just finished watching the series this week, watched the whole thing in the last month or so. So sorry in advance if any of this has been speculated before. 


My theory first came to mind during the interaction with Bran and Hodor in the ""Hold the Door"" episode. To me it seemed like Bran didn't make this happen to Hodor, It seemed like he WATCHED this happen to Hodor all those years ago. It's hard to determine exactly what was happening there but this small difference is kind of crucial to my theory. So if we are assuming that Bran only watched what happened to Hodor all those years ago, that then means that these same events occurred all those years ago ( what 30-40 years ago? Not entirely sure on Hodor's age) So with that established It leads me to this, There is some sort of time loop happening. We will come back to said time loop near the end. Now as for the source of the time loop? Easy, Bran. But not the Bran we all know, I'm believe that the three eyed raven/crow is in fact Bran, he's been calling young Brandon for all these years to hopefully better equip him with the tools he needs to be more successful than he was in the war against the walkers before he restarted this time loop It would appear that young Bran has interfered with this plan though, this is why the Raven so rigorously sought out Bran and why he was so adamant about the length of the visions as well as why he was always present for them, He knew exactly what was going to occur and he was trying to prevent it.


#The beginning:
 I think this time loop was likely initiated by the original Bran ""the builder"" all those years ago he built the wall as an attempt to end this war with the walkers once and for all I'm not sure yet how exactly or why exactly he looped time initially, but in doing so he continued to exist and another Bran became. Now I'm also not sure if that next Bran was the Raven. Perhaps there was one, or more Bran between the builder and the Raven


#Why:
 I don't think any iteration of Bran has had the power to actually influence the past, only to reset it and ensure that some form of himself is started a new. Else he would just keep modifying time until the walkers were ultimately defeated.


#The end: 
I believe that towards the end of the series Bran will put all this together for himself, and as the war with the walkers turns south (heh) he will look to restart the loop once again but this iteration of Bran will finally realize his true power and modify key moments in the past of John snow and Dany to aid them in the war with the walkers, ultimately leading the 7 kingdoms to viktory, Now a point could also be made for him just restarting the loop and that being the end of it, Our friends at GOT aren't famous for giving us happy endings after all. 


#Side notes/ Potential effects of this theory:
These are a bit of a reach but things I consider possibilities, Let me first start by saying that some people experience these loops differently than other's Hodor being a perfect example. I think how ever that the head priestesses of the light may in fact be effected in a similar manner, We've seen that Mil is quite old to say the least, roughly, the same age as the Raven. We also know that the necklace she wears alters her appearance, We've seen a few other Important priestesses wearing the same necklace, So it's easy to assume that they are also... Old. I think they may actually be the children of the Forrest left over from the last loop. They now serve the lord of the light, Brandon Stark. 


Please let me know what you guys think, and again my apologies if any of this has been speculated before!",10,11,False,self,,,,,

As far as the show is concerned this may not matter much - but if we imagine Westeros to be a real world (which is kind of the point) then one of the problems with the current state of things is that there are almost no heirs left - and in many cases - not too many possibilities for heirs.  Daenerys is likely unable to bear (human) children.  Bran may not be able to father them. Between being castrated, killed, or otherwise damaged, there just aren't that many young ones or fertile/virile ruler-candidates left.  (Robin Arryn?)      
       
Beyond that, many of the survivors may not be the best parents for other reasons.  Although a few people may overcome abusive childhoods and become great parents - generally people learn parenting by example from their parents and Daenerys and Tyrion and Varys didn't have great childhoods.  Cersei has shown she's not a great mom to potential kings (Tommen was a find lad, but a terrible king).      
     
My concern is that this entire struggle is very likely to set us up for a situation where in just 20 to 40 years - they'll be doing it all over again.  Daenerys on the throne or any but a few mentioned above - will die eventually and when they do - they'll either die without heir or with a weak one and Westeros will be thrust into another succession war.       
      
And that brings us back to Jon Snow.  Jon Snow may be the best ruler Westeros can get not because of his birth parents and his Targ blood - I don't think that matters - either events will bring him to the throne or they won't.  In this maelstrom he is not going to have opportunity to make his case as the rightful heir before a tribunal or room of lords, etc...  But because of this Stark upraising.  Although Catelyn was unkind to him, he knows what a family, what childrearing looks like.  He absorbed the lessons of Ned Stark and he got the training.  The abuse of Catelyn was minor compared to the abuse that most of the other ruling candidates would seem to have taken in one way or another (save maybe Sansa).  But the fact that he wasn't completely accepted into the noble family (much as Tyrion felt he wasn't) may humble him and give him some small-folk cred perspective.       
     
As far as we know - Jon Snow is still virile and can father children (I mean, he just died - it wasn't that serious - just kidding)... and if you take Varys' perspective ""for the good of the realm""... Varys is backing the wrong candidate.  For real stability he should be favoring a candidate who can not only provide the next generation of rulers - but a next generation of relatively sane ones.

The prophecy in the books says ""And when your tears have drowned you, *the valonqar* shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you.""

Valonqar is High Valyrian for ""little brother.

The video says *the* valonqar means Jaime or Tyrion will die, leaving only one of Cersei's siblings left to kill her.

Since it does say ""the"", could that mean any little brother? Such as The Hound, The Mountain's little brother? (obviously that's unlikely, but you get the point)

She is understandably worried about both her sons, Tommen and Joffrey, but more so the latter, who is near the fighting. When Lancel tells Cersei that the battle appears lost, she insists on Joffrey leaving the battlements so that he can come to her (presumably to get him away from the fighting so he won't be killed by their enemies). There is an argument about this (Lancel and Tyrion both think King Joffrey should stay with the troops for morale purposes), yet Cersei insists, and word gets back to Joffrey to leave the lines and come to her (which he does). 

Question: where did Joffrey go after that, and why was Cersei no longer concerned about his whereabouts and well-being at the very end when she was on the Iron Throne with Tommen? She was very keen on making sure she and Tommen didn't get captured (she had the essence of nightshade on standby, ready to poison herself and Tommen), but what about Joffrey? Did she just forget about him? Did she no longer care? Is there anything book readers can add to give us insight to her thinking on this?

George R.R. Martin really likes his rule of 5 when it comes to conflict. Let's take a look. This whole thing started off with the War of the Five Kings:

* **Joffrey Baratheon**

* **Stannis Baratheon**

* **Renly Baratheon**

* **Robb Stark**

* **Balon Greyjoy**

Now, every single one of these kings is now officially dead (or at least as far as we know). This war can be considered a prelude to the REAL conflict Martin was building up to. That's right, there's a new 5 in town:

* **Cersei Lannister**: The real brains behind everything going on in King's Landing and perhaps the most manipulative person on the show finally has official rule. 

* **Jon Snow**: The new King in the North, and the one that was meant to be it all along. And unbeknownst to him, he has dragon blood in his veins. 

* **Daenerys  Targaryen**: The beasts in the East have finally found their way home. Dany is coming armed with Unsullied, Dothraki, Greyjoy ships, three fully armed and ready dragons, and even some ruling experience. It's about damn time.

* **Euron Greyjoy**: Unlike Balon, Euron is capable of becoming a true threat. Balon was seen as a bit of a joke. He posed little threat other than raiding some ships. However, Euron is absolutely much more dangerous. And let's not forget that he has a full suit of Valyrian armor in the books that may come out. I personally see him as the dark horse of the war to come.

* **The Night King**: Finally, the true threat that has been waiting in silence for quite a long time is ready to come out. Winter has arrived, and as we all know, the night is dark and full of terrors.



So, all in all, the old five are dead. The true five, the five we were all waiting for, the one's whose stories have been been building up for so damn long, have finally arrived.

Psychologically, I mean.  The trauma they experience remains a fundamental part of their makeup--they don't magically get over that shit, fall in love with their soulmate, and live happily ever after.

Victims of sexual assault have a difficult time overcoming that kind of horror.  Sansa was repeatedly raped, beaten, and cut by Ramsey.  She is scarred physically as well as emotionally.  My theory is that if she survives the coming war, she will end up ruling Winterfell alone--like Elizabeth I, the Virgin Queen.  OR...she'll enter into a platonic marriage with Jon Snow.

I've never subscribed to the theory that Dany and Jon will marry, largely because I don't see Dany surviving.  If Jon's true heritage becomes known AND recognized by the people of the north (say via Howland Reed and Bran) I could see Jon and Sansa undertaking a purely political partnership in order to rule the north.  And for some of the bittersweetness promised for the end, Jon leaves Winterfell similar to the way Frodo left the Shire, and Sansa still ends up ruling alone.  Producing an heir of their bodies wouldn't be an issue if they jointly chose someone to inherit the position.

So what do you guys think?  Those of you who think Sansa will survive--could you see her as Queen of the North?",12,0,False,self,,,,,

You have Jon becoming the new king of the north, Cersei in Kings Landing, the Sand snakes in Dorne, Euron with another new fleet of ships, etc. Some time also has to be spent on Jorah and the Stoneskin, as well as on Sam and his sword/whatever knowledge he gets from Old town..

Point is, these last 13 hours are going to be pretty packed. And really, Littlefinger is sort of meaningless at the moment. I guess he still has control of some cavalry, but things are about to get much bigger than that fast. Its going to be huge battles and big power plays. What, if anything can Littlefinger still do to stay in the 'game'? I hear people talk about him like he is going to pull off some big upset and become King, but I just don't see how that's possible..

I've been watching theory videos on youtube, i.e. Last Harpy, and a connection occurred to me. Most of this will be a repost, hopefully not all of it.

There is a popular theory that Samwell is to be a wizard(arry). When he and Gilly were fleeing south to Castle Black, she was impressed of his knowledge of the Night Fort having come from marks on paper, comparing him to a wizard. At another point he said he said he always wanted to be one. Maester Luwin once said that the Citadel had knowledge of how to cast spells that never worked, though Qarth has shown us that proximity to dragons awakens old magic. There is a notion online that maesters are for science and against magic philosophically (also part of the reason, I think, that Qyburn lost his chains), which is why Sam would be, in his search for a weapon to defeat the Walkers, more likely to poke around in this stuff and make the potential discovery. He has his father's sword and he has some experience with dragonglass; the notion of new Valyrian steel and dragonglass has certainly been discussed. An idea I find compelling is the Horn of Winter. If that is indeed what was with the satchel of dragonglass, and the power of ritual has been restored, the results of his meddling with the horn that could bring down the wall could be of more profound consequence than the glass or steel.

We have known Brienne of Tarth to be quite clumsy, following the *false* king Renly, letting him die, then letting Catelyn Stark die.


Would it be that far off that she *missed* Stannis' head?

Brienne is clumsy, and she was using Oathbreaker, a sword with a *gold* pommel. What else was gold? Oberyn's shield. 

""Prince Oberyn tilted his dinted metal shield. A shift of sunlight blazed blindingly off polished gold and copper, into the narrow slit of his foe's helm. Clegane lifted his own shield against the glare. ""


Could it be possible that the gold pommel blinded Brienne's eyes and made her miss, not realizing that she didn't hit our rightful king? 


After this, Stannis goes straight into action and starts to crawl to the Riverlands. 

There, he meets Jaqen. Most of you have probably heard of the theory that the Jaqen at Harrenhal is different from the Jaqen of Braavos. Assuming Jaqen has traveled, he took The Hound's face in the Vale, and probably went back to the Riverlands seeing as it's the gate to several realms.. perhaps for his next target, or just to relax.


There, Stannis The Mannis kills the experienced assassin and takes the faces he has collected. Then he wears The Hound's face as a disguise, since there is no way for our King to know about The Hound's death, sadly.


Since he is still crawling and hurt, that is when Septon Meribald finds him. This is why it didn't make sense that they found The Hound in the Vale, they never did!


Mannis takes advantage of the situation, and is healed and stays with the Septon and his *false gods.* 


That's when the massacre happens, and Stannis is enraged, murdering until he finds the Brotherhood without Banners. 


There, he considers joining them since they are *also* followers of the Lord of Light! 


Cleganebowl is dead. ALL HAIL THE KING!

First, the bad guys, in GoT's case the Northerners and in CoN's case the Telmarines, begin the battle with a mass cavalry charge which is defeated by the 'good guys', the Stark loyalists or the Narnians, who are vastly outnumbered by the bad guys. Then, after defeating the cavalry, the 'good guys' are nearly defeated by the bad guy infantry, who advance in a spear/pike wall after the cavalry have been defeated. Finally, the battle ends with the bad guys being defeated by outside intervention, in Game of Thrones the Knights of the Vale and in Chronicles of Narnia Aslan and the nature.

My theory is based around the idea that The Night King was made when a Stark was captured and the CotF attempted to turn him into a weapon.

The second idea is that Craster is the desendant of a Stark (possibly the younger brother of The Night King) left on the northern side when The Wall was built.

The combination of these ideas is that the White Walkers protect and tolerate Craster because The Night King can only turn people (possibly babies) with a shared bloodline into more White Walkers.",25,3,False,self,,,,,

I think she will send the Mountain with an army to Winterfell.

The fookin Hound is with the Brotherhood around the Riverlands, so is Arya, and Melisandre is going south. I think we will se this huge reunion next season, Arya, Sandor, Melisandre and the BWB all together.. and who knows, maybe Brienne and Pod too.

I truly believe that Tywin aided in the plot to kill Joffrey.

*For the best understanding of the theory, I advise you watch all scenes*.

&gt;Tywin: This is a **plot. Plots are not public knowledge**. And the *Tyrells won't cary this out until after Joffrey's wedding*. We need to act first and kill this union in its crib. We need to find Sansa stark a new husband.

Now, for this theory to make sense, I have to go all the way back when the Lannisters and the Tyrells first formed a relationship.

Tyrion is Hand in King's Landing, in Tywin's rule, and Tywin is at Harenhall (where is in the books, Roose Bolton is in Harenhall while he's conspiring with Tywin, while Tywin is off fighting in the North).

Stannis Baratheon is planning to attempt to take over King's Landing, and after killing Renly Baratheon (who is married to Margaery Tyrell and is actually a gay lover to her brother, Loras) it gave the Tyrells a stronger reason to fight against Stannis.  After hearing Stannis assassinating Renly in the books, Tyrion sends Littlefinger to Ser Loras in order to try and gain his army of ten thousand while in the show Tyrion sends Petyr to Catelyn Stark about the proposal.

[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9jac7Qg9w4)

Later in the series, Lord Tywin reveals to Cersei that the Lannister gold mines have been run dry for the past three years.  House Tyrell is the second wealthiest family in Kings Landing.  Petyr Baelish is the master of coin, and I believe he has known about the Lannisters predicament since the beginning.  If House Tyrell is the second wealthiest/most powerful house, then I do not doubt that Littlefinger would take advantage of this situation to get Tywin to comply. And Tywin would be stupid to refuse a marriage between the Houses, because that would be the surest way to keep peace between the two houses as well as sustaining the Lannister's power.

Littlefinger knew Catelyn wanted her daughters back, the proposal by Tyrion among Tywin, Catelyn and Robb is the exchange of Jaime for Arya and Sansa. Catelyn complied by sending off Jaime to King's Landing so she can have her daughters back, while Robb would obviously refuse this proposal out of honor of his fathers death. Tywin also wants his son back, so the only logical thing for Tywin to do is to agree with the release of her daughter as well as killing Robb off, after the release of Jaime, to ensure peace.

**Fast forward to the Battle of Blackwater**

Tyrion has taken out a good portion of Stannis' fleet.  Enough to delay them from entering the Red Keep to which *both* Tywin Lannister's fleet *as well* as Tyrell's ten thousand strong finish off the Battle of Blackwater.

Before Tyrion and Sansa's arranged wedding, the Tyrells were going to marry Sansa to Ser Loras to secure the North. However, Tywin got in the way of that by marrying Tyrion to Sansa so the Tyrells didn't overstep their power.

The day after the Battle of Blackwater, there's a post-battle ceremony. Tywin entered the court on his horse after his horse shit, he receives his title as Hand of the King and then he leaves the court like he does not give a fuck. Littlefinger is granted Harenhall (which was of Tywin's plan), Ser Loras asks for Joffrey to marry Margaery, to which Cersei and Maester Pycelle dismiss Joffrey's commitment to Sansa, and after Joffrey agrees to mary her, Ser Loras asks for a place in the King's guard, which is granted.  

Now, listen to the conversation Tyrion is having with Tywin and Cersei in regards to refusing Sansa's marriage to the Tyrells:  

&gt;Tyrion: Sansa is key to the North *The Tyrell army is helping us to win this war.  Do you really think it is wise to refuse them?* 

&gt;Tywin: *There's nothing to refuse.  This is a* **plot. Plots are not public knowledge**. And the *Tyrells won't cary this out until after Joffrey's wedding*. We need to act first and kill this union in its crib. We need to find Sansa stark a new husband.

Then Tyrion realizes that they are to marry Sansa off to him. Tywin knew the Purple Wedding would happen. He had foreknowledge of a ""plot"" that will ""happen after Joffrey's wedding"".

**What would Tywin's motive be to kill off Joffrey?**

Tywin is all about sustaining family image.  The very first scene he was ever in, he is quoted: *""Family is what lives on, Family is all that matters""*.  And Tywin needs an heir to Casterly Rock.  The thing is, in his family's current situation, his direct family's heritage of Casterly Rock is at stake.

Jaime swore an oath to king's guard and when you swear an oath to King's Guard, you can't *marry*, so no offspring (that can't be bastards), and you must disregard *all* inheritance, making Tyrion rightful heir to Casterly Rock *which Tywin did not want*. Tywin's grandchildren are Baratheons by name, so they can't inherit it either. Since Tywin did not want Tyrion to inherit Casterly Rock, he wanted the possibility that Tyrion would produce an heir (since it is possible for a dwarf to have a normal baby) or have Jaime to give up the King's Guard to serve at Casterly Rock.  Cersei could still produce an heir through Ser Loras, but it is known that Ser Loras is a ""sword swallower""/gay, so he would want Tyrion to produce an heir.

At Tyrion's wedding to Sansa, Tyrion gets quite drunk and Tywin commands Tyrion to consummate the marriage and produce an heir  *through any means necessary* (including rape) . Later, Tyrion gets upset at Joffrey and threatens to cut off his dick:

[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15zQAdNoRck) S3E8

I think Tywin considered this as a possible opportunity to get rid of Tyrion at the time since Tyrion just openly threatened the King in front of many.

Joffrey started soiling the Lannister name by acting the way he was and dragging the Lannisters into war and getting Jaime captured (Tywin's only hope for Casterly Rock), by unnecessarily beheading Ned Stark. The war Joffrey caused is why Tywin sent for Tyrion to serve as King's Hand (in his place) to rule over Joffrey at the end of season one. The war also halted the gold mines at Casterly Rock, putting them in debt. Tywin sees Joffrey solely responsible for all of this, especially Jaime's capture, and soley responsible for putting the family's name at risk. 

Tywin's only concern of the entire war was that Jaime was captured by Robb (remember: Family is all that lives on, Family is all that matters):

&gt;Tywin: *""They have my son!""*

[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-5-qlj8aZg) S1E10

&gt;Tyrion:(knocks cup off table, breaking it) *""There's your peace. Joffrey slaughtered that when he chopped off Ned Stark's Head""*

&gt;Kevan: *something something Casterly Rock*

&gt;Tywin: *""THEY HAVE MY SON!""* Get out, all of you. (proceeds to name Tyrion Hand of King)

When Tywin got to Kings landing and the Red Wedding happened (which Tywin planned), Tywin took over Tyrion's spot as Hand of the King and, at this point, pretty much assumed rule over the Kingdom. You can see Tywin's assumption of ruling over the Kingdom in two different scenes.

The first scene Tywin strides up to Joffrey sitting on the Iron Throne (with no one in the court) while the King's Guard followed Tywin, juxtaposing Joffrey's lack of King's Guard.  You can see who has the power in this scene:

S3E7: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tk5hKomP4MA)

(note this is only part of the scene that's proving my point about Tywin not giving a shit about Joffre's rule as king, but the entire scene is important):

&gt;Tywin: I'll see to it that you'll be consulted *whenever it is necessary*.

*walks away, then turns around as if he completely forgot*

&gt;Tywin: *Your grace*

And then the King's Counsel announced the death of Robb Stark happened and then this happened:

Tywin hinting that he'll aid in poisoning Joffrey: ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRrV1ff33iM))

*after Tyrion threatens Joffrey and Joffrey exclaims I AM THE KING*:

&gt;Tywin: Any man who must say ""I am the King"" is no true king.  *I'll make sure you'll understand that once I won your war for you*.

&gt;Joffrey: *My father won the war.  He killed Rhaegar, he took the crown!* **While you hid on a Casterly Rock!**

Tywin stares down Joffrey.

&gt;Tywin: The King is tired, see him to his chambers.

&gt;Cersei: Come, you *have a wedding to plan*, you must rest.

&gt;Tywin: Grand Maester, perhaps some *Essence of Nightshade* to help him *sleep*.

&gt;Joffrey: I *am not* **TIRED!**

It is noted that Essence of the Nightshade was going to be used by Cersei to commit suicide at the Battle of Blackwater in the show and foreshadowed Joffrey and possibly her own death in the scene where Bronn is singing Rains of Castamere. And when Cersei is about to kill herself and Tommen, in strides in Tywin to save the day, which Cersei drops the Essence of Nightshade.

In the books, Tywin mentions that there was another king that often liked to remind people that he was the King: the Mad King. Who Tywin hated dearly.

This scene happened at the season 3 finale, then the Purple Wedding happened *two episodes later in the next season*.

And then, after the conversation when the counsel found out Robb and Cat being dead and Joffrey is escorted out:

&gt;""The boy is thirteen. There is time yet."" Lord Tywin paced to the window. That was unlike him; he *was more upset than he wished to show*. **""He requires a sharp lesson.""**

I would like for y'all to watch the Purple Wedding all over again.  

The opening scene to it is a conversation between Olenna and Tywin, which she said:

&gt;Olenna: *Wars are rather expensive. The Iron Bank will have its due*

Casterly Rock's gold mines have almost gone dry, as well as halted by the war, three years ago. The Throne's debt is also the Lannister's debt. Tywin needed the Tyrell's relationship because the Tyrells are the 2nd richest house, and they have Daenerys threatening to cross the sea, and the Stormborn in the Iron Islands threatening a rebellion.

[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylnGorj9oXk)

Joffrey embarrasses Tyrion and then tries to remind Tyrion that he is the king.  Margaery breaks the tension by pointing out the pidgeon pie.  (Interestingly enough, birds are heavily associated with Sansa. Joffrey beheaded a pigeon with his new Valyrian steel sword, to which he commented that *""Every time I use it, it'll be like cutting off Ned Stark's head all over again""*).  And then when he was eating the pie and is reminded about Tyrion not kneeling, he calls for Tyrion for his wine to wash down the pie, to which you can see Tywin visibly pissed off.

Joffrey drinks the poison and starts choking. After Cersei goes after Joffrey while he's dying, and the king's guard on the right side of the tables sprints to check on him, you can see Tywin covering up Tommen's eyes (the only one left at the Lannister table besides Sansa) before Ser Dontos escorts Sansa off.

After Sansa is escorted off, Tywin steps up to Joffrey and observes Joffrey (which is where the scene ends):

[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifx0Fg_drBI).

And then in the beginning of the next episode, Cersei questions where Sansa is and then Tywin commands ""Find her. Bar the gates of the city, *seize every ship in the harbor*.  **No one** leaves the capital!""

Ser Dontos leads Sansa to a boat which they rowed out to Littlefinger's boat, which is hiding in a misty cloud.  Only to find out Littlefinger was part of the plot of killing Joffrey, and Ser Dontos was helping Sansa to get payed.  Wouldn't Tywin commanding that every ship in the harbor be seized only suggest that he may not want anyone seeing or going after Ser Dontos taking Sansa into Littlefinger's boat in the fog?

**Tywin is a Kinslayer?**

There are a couple things to consider here.  Joffrey is Baratheon by name, not Lannister.  I don't think Tywin would care *as much* unless Joffrey is named *Lannister* (cause, again, *Family/name is all that lives on*). Joffrey is also known, or at least possibly considered, by almost everyone in King's landing as a product of incest. Tywin knows this, which is why Tywin tried to get Ser Loras to marry Cersei, to produce an heir that everyone knows is not incest (in the scene where Tywin announces Tyrion and Cersei's wedding to Sansa and Loras respectively, Tywin told Cersei that *he wanted to put an end to the incestuous rumors that was soiling the Lannister name*).  Tywin just turned a blind eye to Jaime and Cersei to pretend that it didn't happen or he didn't care. Maybe he didn't care as long as it isn't public, because Tywin was all about not bedding whores, but he ended up bedding Shae in secret. 

Whenever they had Joffrey's body in the sept after his death, Cersei, Tommen, and Tywin were in the room. Tywin discusses to Tommen on what makes a good king.  During which, Tywin said:

&gt;A wise young king knows what he knows and knows what he doesn't. You're young.  *A wise young king listens to his counselors and heeds their advice until he comes of age.*  And the wisest kings continues to listen to them long afterwards.  Your brother wasn't a wise king.  Your brother wasn't a good king.  **If he had been, perhaps he'd still be alive.**  *Now, as the king, you have to marry.  To further the family line.*

[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doY0IjisBlk)

Tommen is an easier pawn to control to Tywin, while Joffrey was a loose cannon that did as he pleased.

**Why would Tywin help Sansa?**

The proposal from season 2 by Tyrion was for Robb to release Jaime in exchange for Arya and Sansa.  Robb refused this, so Catelyn took up the offer and released Jaime to bring her daughters back.  Tywin is a man of his word, so why not help Sansa?

Tywin also wanted Tyrion to produce an heir. Sansa is Tywin's plan B. There's a chance that the child will not become a dwarf (fifty percent chance by the punnet square) and plus Tywin never knew whether or not Tyrion actually bedded her, and he hoped for him to produce an heir. Tywin has greater hope getting Sansa to produce an heir through Tyrion than getting Ser Loras to bed Cersei, which is Tywin's plan C.

**Why did Tywin spend so much money on the wedding?**

As Syrio Forel said: *""Never do what is expected""*

Tywin spending so much money on this wedding would only serve as a smokescreen to him aiding the plot. Why *would* Tywin spend so much money only to kill his grandson? Not to mention half of the wedding was payed by the Lannisters, from *the throne's money*, and the other half is payed off by the Tyrells.  Even having the dwarfs fight as a play was arranged by Littlefinger.  All of this pointing to both the houses and Petyr Baelish having ties into the plot.

And the cherry on top of this whole theory:

Olenna speaks with Tywin Lannister [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrkZQQ_5ywU). The scene opens with Tywin Lannister pouring wine into two cups, after the Purple Wedding, giving one to Olenna while talking about the Betrothal of Ser Loras to Cersei. Tywin is always a man of foreshadowing/symbolism.

Remember how the marriages were played out in the beginning.  In the books, Littlefinger rides to Ser Loras Tyrell for help at the Battle of Blackwater, Tywin, his troups, and the Tyrells arrive when the Battle of Blackwater happens.  Then Margaery is arranged to mary King Joffrey, and Ser Loras is to be King's Guard, while Tywin gave Littlefinger Harenhall.

In the show, Littlefinger rides out to talk to Catelyn Stark of Tyrion's proposal with the exchange between Tywin and Robb.  Robb will obviously refuse, so this is why it is brought to Catelyn.  Littlefinger then rides to Tywin about the proposal.

Olenna Tyrell poisons Joffrey, Tyrion is blamed as well as Sansa by association. They are both set up. Olenna wanted gain power over the throne, Littlefinger helped plan this so he could help Sansa for obvious reasons, and Tywin wanted to sustain the family name while also keeping his end of the deal by helping the release of Sansa.

At the trial, before Tyrion's final verdict, Jaime reveals that Tywin knew Tyrion didn't murder Joffrey and that the court was a farce by Cersei to make sure Tyrion was sentenced whether or not he was innocent. In fact, Tywin rigged the judges.  He assigned Mace Tyrell as one judge, and he bribed Prince Oberyn Martel with Gregor Clegane's life as well as a spot on the King's Counsel in return of being the third judge to convict Tyrion.

Jaime didn't want risk Tyrion's death, so he told Tywin that he would take down is oath to King's Guard in exchange for Tyrion's survival.  Tywin happily agreed and told Jaime that he would rule over Casterly Rock and Tyrion would take the black, *only if* Jaime were to leave the King's guard and take up Casterly Rock.

Tywin knew about Shae all along. Cersei found out about Shae whenever she learned that Shae was a handmaiden, wasn't noble born, and couldn't curtsey while she climbed the ranks to handmaiden at King's Landing. Cersei would use Shae against Tyrion by paying Shae to say that *""Tyrion wanted to please Sansa by getting revenge for Ned Stark.  So he planned to poison the king""*, There are theories that Shae was Tywin's to begin with, but from what I know and my current research they *seem* speculative.  It may have more solid grounding, I do not know.

Also, note the conversation Jaime has with Catelyn Stark, when he is Robb's captive, in regards to vows:

[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpD47mmlei4)

&gt;Catelyn to Jaime: You are no knight.  Youve forsaken every vow youve took.

&gt;Jaime: So many vows.  They make you swear and swear. Defend the king, obey the king, obey your father, protect the innocent, defend the weak, *but what if your father despises the king?*  **What if the king massacres the innocent?**

Joffrey is often referred to in the books as King Aerys III, and he has been equated to the Mad King in several other instances.

Given all of these things that had happened, I think it's more likely than not that Tywin helped plot the Purple Wedding. Tywin did not like Joffrey, and Tywin wanted Tyrion dead from his birth.  Tywin only called Tyrion his son when he wanted to use him. Because the mines have ran dry and the Lannisters are in debt, Tywin also needed House Tyrell's strength to ensure the Lannister's survival. Joffrey only put a stain on the family name as well as putting Tywin's line at risk.

**TL;DR: Tywin hates Joffrey for soiling the family name and putting his family line at risk, Tywin needed the Tyrells for power/support of the family, Tywin fulfilled Tyrion's proposal to Catelyn/Robb Stark by getting rid of Sansa, in exchange with Catelyn for Jaime, as well as killing off Robb to put the north at bay**",28,5,False,self,,,,,

If you ask me, I believe there will be a huge leadup to it, with several things going Cersei's way and the Dothraki having some trouble at sea. Around episode 4 or 5, we'll get a large battle where Dany defeats Cersei, and it will take around 3/4 of the episode similar to BotB. The fight against Euron will likely be in the season finale.

Now, Jaime was at the Twins. Arya even saw him and gave him the sexy stare. And Arya knew it was Jaime, she has seen him before. Now, I'll go through the reasons why Arya would want to kill Jaime.

- Jaime tried to kill her brother Bran by pushing him from a tower.
- Jaime killed Jory Cassel, whom Arya loved. Jory took care of Arya on the kingsroad and promised her that he would keep Eddard safe.
- Jaime maims Eddard by spearing him in the leg. Okay, Jaime himself didn't do it, one of his men did, but Arya probably doesn't know that.

This alone should definitely get Jaime on Arya's list. Arya put Polliver on it just for taking Needle, and another guy (forget his name, Roche?) for threatening to rape her. My only theory is that she simply doesn't know that Jaime did these things, but it seems like she should at least know that Jaime maimed her father.

Now, Arya doesn't really know much about what has happened past Season 1. So she doesn't know about Jaime's conflict with her brother Robb. Even so, with Arya there at the Twins, she should've been able to kill Walder Frey and Jaime.

So my first question is what does the average common people of Westeros know about Ned's treason? Do they think Ned wanted it for himself or do they know that he wanted to give it to Stannis/etc?

The reason I say this is because later on when Stannis meets Jon beyond the wall at Mance's camp, Jon says that his father died for him. So how do *people like Jon* know this? I mean I don't recall this information being spread around. Maybe a few people like Renly, Arya, Ser Barristan etc knew about this but I don't recall this being spread around on a large scale. Sure people who knew Ned closely like Jon won't believe that he tried to take it for himself as they know the sort of man he was, as is the case with a lot of the Northerners (e.g. Lyanna Mormont), but this does not apply for the whole of the Westeros. 

So essentially I'm asking do people know the truth about Ned, and to what extent. If so, how because I don't remember this being spread around",37,57,False,self,,,,,

I decided to write up a post and just go through the basics regarding the different types of knights, different types of houses and how they're founded, and the sometimes vague naming traditions of the Seven Kingdoms.

I'll start by discussing knights, secondly I'll go into how houses are founded, and finally I'll do my best to shed some light on the minefield that is naming traditions in cases when people marry people who are not of the same standing in Westerosi society. 

****

Knights: there are really one two types of knights, regular knights and landed knights, but due to nicknames like 'hedge knight' and 'sworn sword' being common there is some confusion, so I'll just briefly discuss each.

- Knight: a knight is any man who was knighted by another knight, as any knight can knight any man. Knighthood has its roots in Andal culture and is believed to have been brought to Westeros during the Andal invasion. Contrary to the nobility, this rank is not hereditary and it is possible for the baseborn to become knights. Knights are referred to with the title ""Ser"". They are supposed to be brave, courageous, honourable, and true to their word. They should be loyal to their feudal overlord, and are tasked with defending their faith. In practice, knights often fall short of sustaining such high and noble ideals. Many do not try particularly hard, and instead seek knighthood mainly for the prestige and opportunities. Knights are not part of the nobility, they own no lands or keep, and they have no men under their command, other than a squire and possibly a page or standard bearer. Knights who were already of noble houses are typically referred to by their full name, while knights who were baseborn and have no family name usually either invent a last name for themselves (such as Ser Rolly Duckfield, who chose his name because he was in a field full of ducks when he was knighted) or take a title based on the place or battle where they were knighted (such as Ser Bronn of the Blackwater). Because knighthood is tied to the Faith of the Seven, knights are rare in the north (though not entirely non-existing). However,  the warrior tradition of the north is similar to that of knighthood, and heavy cavalrymen in the north serve a nearly identical function to knights in the south, and are considered knights in all but name. Well known examples of knights include Ser Arthur Dayne, Ser Barristan Selmy, Ser Jorah Mormont, and Ser Jaime Lannister. 

- Hedge knight: a hedge knight is any knight who is not in the service of a master or a particular house. Due to the fact that any knight can knight any man, there are quite a lot of knights knocking around Westeros. Most are in the service of either a noble house or a particular master, but some are not, and are forced to travel the length and breadth of Westeros looking for gainful employment, as being a knight requires money to maintain your equipment, and a roof over your head is something any man can appreciate. Most hedge knights travel in search of employment and often attend jousts to make money and display their prowess in hopes of being hired and making a name for themselves. Well known examples of hedge knights include Ser Humfrey the Mummer, and Ser Arlan of Pennytree.

- Sworn Sword: Knights who are in the service of one singular master, rather than a family/house, are commonly referred to as ""sworn swords"". They act as retainers for their master, taking food, shelter, and money in exchange for their services in war, should they be needed. During a campaign, lords often hire a large number of sworn swords on a temporary basis. After the campaign ends and the lord has no further need for so many knights, they are released and become hedge knights once again. Sworn swords who are assigned especially as bodyguards are known as ""sworn shields."" Some sworn swords, such as northmen, are not knights. Those who are, and are not hedge knights, may interchangeably be called ""household knights."" Some household knights can reach a respectable status in their master's service, becoming a master-at-arms, a captain of the guards, or even a castellan. 

- Landed knight: a landed knight is a knight who inherits or is given a castle, holdfast, or keep to live in, and lands to protect. Landed knights can be members of noble houses, but there are also  examples of lowborn people becoming landed knights. Landed knights have servants in their household, men-at-arms to command, and smallfolk to protect. While the wealthiest landed knights manage more land than the poorest lords, landed knights do not have the authority to deliver justice in their land. Rather, they must appeal to their liege lord, whom they are also sworn to fight for. Some landed knights are more powerful than smaller lords. These knights are usually of ancient houses, with extensive lands, and strong castles. Their status is often reflected by taking a style that incorporates the name of their castle, such as Ser Symond Templeton being the ""Knight of Ninestars"". A landed knight has less prestige than members of the nobility, and is outranked by lords at feasts and tourneys. Well known examples of landed knights include Ser Gregor Clegane, Ser Ronnet Connington, and Ser Symond Templeton.

****

Houses, the different types, and how they're founded: any man who is/becomes lord of a keep of some kind with land may found a house for himself. For this reason, there are quite a lot of them, and many houses have multiple branches. 

Anyone raised to the nobility could potentially become lord of somewhere, and landed knights can also found their own houses, as landed knights are also lord of a castle/holdfast/keep with lands. Because houses can be founded by both members of the nobility and landed knights, there is a distinction drawn between [noble houses](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Category:Noble_houses) and [knightly houses](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Category:Knightly_houses). 

For example, when Karlon Stark defeated a rebellious lord and ended his house, he was given said lord's lands as a reward. This made Karlon Stark a lord, and because he was the youngest son of the King in the North, and as such would not likely inherit the title, he founded his own house. The newly made Lord Karlon Stark named his new castle Karlon's Hold (though over the years the castle would come to be known as Karhold), and founded House Karstark.


Similarly, when Robert's Rebellion concluded in a decisive victory for Robert Baratheon, Robert appointed his brother Stannis Baratheon as Lord of Dragonstone, an island in the Crownlands. Stannis took it as a slight, because he wanted Storm's End, the much more prestigious castle that should have been his by right, but he did take the opportunity afforded to him by his new lordly status to found House Baratheon of Dragonstone, a cadet house of House Baratheon of Storm's End. 

Examples of knightly houses include House Clegane, which was founded when a lowborn kennelmaster saved Tytos Lannister from a lion, and was given some land and a towerhouse in reward. The kennelmaster named his towerhouse Clegane's Keep, and founded House Clegane, as Lord Clegane of Clegane's Keep. 

Similarly, when the lowborn smuggler Davos saved Stannis Baratheon and his men from starvation during the Siege of Storm's End, he was given a knighthood and a keep with some land on Cape Wrath as a reward. Davos, now both Ser Davos and Lord Davos (as he was both a knight and a lord, and as such is alternately referred to by both titles, on different occasions), then founded House Seaworth, having taken the name ""Seaworth"" for his last name upon being knighted. 

****

Naming traditions in the Seven Kingdoms: they're vague, strange, and inconsistent. Typically, when a man marries a woman, the woman takes the man's last name, and any children they might have would have their father's last name, rather than their mother's. But this isn't always the case. We know of several examples where the woman did not take her husband's name, and some where the children even got their mother's name. Whoever it was that married Maege Mormont, Maege did not take his name, nor did their daughters; hence Lyanna Mormont being named Lyanna Mormont (there is some speculation that the Mormont daughters might be incest children, because Maege apparently got married in secret and won't say who the husband was, and there are lots of rumours about her ""laying with bears""). 

Among other copious examples is Ryon Allyrion, whose mother was Delonne Allyrion. Lady Delonne Allyrion was married, but it's never specified to whom. Whoever it was, she did not take his name, and his children did not get his name, but hers. Presumably, Lady Allyrion's husband was of lower birth than she was.

Normally, noble ladies are wedded to noble lords, as her parents would arrange her marriage for her, and would want to wed her to a man who either is, or stands to become, lord of somewhere, because daughters typically don't inherit (unless there are zero sons) so they want their daughter to marry someone with whom they can live somewhere nice and have servants and people to rule, and her children can be lords in their turn. But sometimes women marry someone of lower birth than them, in which case she sometimes will hold on to her own name, as it is of higher status, and give her children her name, rather than her husband's. GRRM once wrote on his blog:

""Most of the ladies of Westeros do change their names when they wed, although usage varies. If the wife's family is significantly higher born than the husband's, she may use his name little, if at all.""

It's a bit vague, but basically it differs on a case-by-case basis. ",21,116,False,self,,,,,

So what could be the way to keep our beloved show rolling on even after 2018? What are the potential spin-off possibilities? It's a no-brainer that the spin-off can either feature events prior to the events of the Game of Thrones, or the events after the Game of Thrones comes to an end. 

Here are some of the obvious ones that spring to mind:

1) A spin-off (prequel) based on Robert's Rebellion or the War of the Usurper spanning the events between the end of the Targaryen rule and the crowning of King Robert, which is something us fans would be dying to see, for it would feature memorable characters like the Mad King Aerys, Lyanna Stark, Ser Arthur Dayne, Tywin Lannister, Jon Arryn, and of course Ned Stark and Robert Baratheon. There would no scope for predictions with this series though as the events in the War of the Usurper is known to one and all. 

2) Tales of Dunk and Egg- set almost 90 years before the events of the Game of Thrones, a series based on the tales of Dunk (Ser Duncan the Tall) and his squire Egg (who would go on to become King Aegon V Targaryen is also a distinct option, more so as 3 of the books in the series are already out providing material enough for a spin-off. The hitch though would be that a series based on Dunk and Egg tales would be considerably lighter in tone and substance, with little gore, intrigue, or women to keep the viewers hooked (unless the show makes some drastic additions!). 

3) A spin-off set even farther back in time and featuring the battles between the Children of the Forest and the First Men and the invasion of the Andals. 

4) A spin-off featuring the events in Westeros after the white walkers have been defeated and order has been restored to Westeros by its new King (whomsoever it may be, though I see only 3 possible candidates- Jon, Dany, or Jaime) and a new round of the Game of Thrones is set in motion!

Forgive me if I miss any information, I need to rewatch GoT again. So, the Boltons desperately wanted to rule the North and Tywin Lannister wanted to end the war, right? The easiest way Tywin could end the war was to slaughter them at a wedding feast. Walder Frey doesn't seem like the kind of man to pick a losing side. The Karstarks had already left and Robb's army was declining in numbers while Lannister forces were still strong. With the right reassurances and rewards (like Riverrun) maybe Walder Frey could have still gone through with the Red Wedding but kept Robb Stark as a hostage like they did with Edmure because he is the heir to Winterfell (but that would be a dumb idea, the North always remembers).

What do you think Walder Frey would have done if Robb had married one of his daughters instead?

She's mentioned in official GoT interviews and at ComicCon how Sansa resents Jon's new power and how she might join with Littlefinger to combat that.

Does anything in the show actually point to that so far? It seems that a lot of fuss is being made about something that doesn't even exist in the show itself. In the books, Sansa clearly resents Jon because he's a bastard, constantly insisting that he is merely her half-brother, but I can't remember a single interaction between or conversation about Jon and Sansa before last season. There is a little bit of tension between them before the Battle of the Bastards because of Sansa's lack of input and her calling the Knights of the Vale without Jon's knowledge, but it seemed that any tension was put to rest during their ""winter is here"" chat.

At the ""kingindanorf"" ceremony, Jon looks to Sansa for approval, and she smiles at him, then spots Littlefinger brooding in the corner. She seems afraid of what he may be plotting, not eager to join him, especially since she *just* snubbed him at the Weirwood tree.

Please correct me if I'm wrong. I know the wildfire was hidden throughout King's Landing when the Mad King wanted to burn it down. Jamie killed him after finding out his plan, correct? So is this why Cersei knew where it was?

That could easily be symbolizing imagery that these women will have the largest impact on the future of the Seven Kingdoms. 

Each of these characters has a pivotal role in shaping Westeros. We have: 

**Cersei**- roughly responsible for the death of each of her children, has stepped into her role as the Mad Queen with chaotic finesse.

**Sansa** - finally free from her torturous husband Ramsay, is no longer a doe-eyed damsel but a hardened young woman deadset on restoring her Stark name back to its rightful status.

**Arya** - fully transformed into a rogue vengeance assassin. 

**Daenerys** - the most obvious and significant factor in Westeros' future with her army of Unsullied, army of blood-sworn Dothraki and of course, her dragons.

**Yara** - rock-hard with no hesitation to claim herself the rightful queen of the Iron Islands, with zero dependency on a man, and most importantly, her ability to rally hordes of loyal and devoted men to her cause. 

**Ellaria** - cutthroat, merciless, and even more willing to wreak havoc on her enemies than Cersei, if thats possible.

and **Olenna** - reasonably one of the only remaining *sane* leaders of the Great Houses. Not to mention her exceptional wit and capacity for politics. Add in the fact that Cersei just went and murdered her son and grandchildren, and well, I would **not** want to be Cersei right about now. 

But one thing I noticed as well is that there are, suspiciously, seven of them. The number seven is obviously a giant recurring theme and symbol in the series: Seven Kingdoms, Faith of the Seven, etc.  But then I started to really think of the possible co-relation between the Faith of the Seven and these significant characters. So, if these women *are* embodiments of the seven gods, which one is which? I came to my own conclusion looking at the characteristics and values of each of the gods, and what they represent:


The Father  divine justice and judges the souls of the dead

The Mother  mercy, peace, fertility and childbirth. Sometimes referred to as the strength of women.

The Maiden  purity, innocence, love and beauty.

The Crone - wisdom and foresight; depicted carrying a lantern.

The Warrior  strength and courage in battle.

The Smith  creation and craftsmanship.

The Stranger - death and the unknown; rarely prayed to.
[*definitions courtesy of gameofthrones.wikia.com*]

I did not associate the characters with these gods word-for-word, but on the more abstract perceptions of why they are generally prayed upon. (No pun intended.) 

**The Father = Ellaria Sand** She is all about justice, albeit selfish justice. Her lifes mission is to make the Lannisters pay for their crimes against Oberyn and his sister, Elia.

**The Mother = Cersei Lannister** The only redeeming quality she possesses is her fierce passion and love for her children. If youre wondering how in the seven hells I put her as the Mother when she is the opposite of peace and mercy, dont worry. Im getting to that.

**The Maiden = Sansa Stark** From the beginning she was strikingly beautiful and a resilient romantic. Untouched in her first marriage to Tyrion, made into more of a martyr and less a bride in her marriage to Ramsay, she is an obvious pick for the Maiden. 

**The Crone = Olenna Tyrell** Despite the somewhat haggard perception the word crone suggests, Olenna is wise beyond measure and has an incredible judge of character. She displays the Crones foresight in her elaborate plan to carry out Joffreys assassination. 

**The Warrior = Yara Greyjoy** She commands her own fleet, and when her father is content to remain at Pyke while his last surviving son, Theon, is being flayed by Ramsay Bolton, Yara takes no time at all to strike back in attempting to rescue him herself. 

**The Smith = Daenerys Targaryen**  She has been the epitome of creation since climbing atop Khal Drogos funeral pyre and creating a new age when she brought dragons back into the world. She created a new dawn of free cities in Quarth, Astapor and Meereen. And creation goes in hand in hand with building, the nature of craftsmanship. 

**And the Stranger = Arya Stark** Trained in the ways of the Faceless Men, who are strangers by nature; a face in the crowd never identified. She is a child and yet her comforting lullaby at night is the list of everyone she wants to kill. What could be more representive of death and the unknown than a young girl who can change her face and bake your sons into a pie before slitting your throat? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. 

The main thing I want to elaborate on is the ironic, and almost perfect, contradictions each of these possible representations contain. For example, Cerseis qualities as a mother resulted in her acts of havoc, revenge and pain; the very opposite of peace and mercy. Ellarias traits of the Father are all too hilarious considering that no two people have more cause to despise each other than she and Cersei. One is responsible for the death of the others paramour, the other responsible for the death of the others daughter. Mother and Father duo *indeed.* Sansa might once have been the vision and ideal of purity and innocence, but that girl has been to hell and back through her over trusting nature and now shes *pissed*. Shes gone from maiden to downright fury and revenge. Though Daenerys is a creator in many ways, shes extremely destructive as well. Nothing she creates comes without the cost of destroying something else. Although we can all agree the things she destroys (slavery, warfare rape, etc.) are gladly gone. On Olennas end, though her part in Joffreys death did Westeros a great service, it definitely didnt play out too well for her. And Arya may have all the *skills* of a Faceless Man, but she is NOT a Faceless Man. She is, in no uncertain terms, Arya Stark, and she is going home. 

So what do all these contradictions mean? I think it could be another example of George R.R. Martins genius implantation of foreshadowing. The women are ruling this world (at the moment), and they are metaphorically the seven gods, yet they bastardize or skew the gods values. This could be a hint that when all is said and done, the faith of the seven will be gone, and the world will have ONE god. Perhaps that lord of light we hear so much about.

Little Finger is working for the White Walkers.

*Disclaimer: I am anEarthling and hence can only provide circumstantial and speculative evidence to prove my""theory"".*


**Introduction:**

After theorising in a previous post that his ending might be in sight , I started to read the book again. On reading it more carefully, I have come to the conclusion that Petyr Baliesh is one of the most important characters in the book, if not one of the main characters central to how the story begins and unfolds.

**Family Background and Personality:**

Petyr Baelish's great-grandfather was a sellsword and his great grandfather a hedge knight. Both these professions were considered to be taken up by people with dubious character. Despite the Baelish relinquishing their profession for landed nobility, their history is a fact.

On a personal level, Petyr from a very young age is considered to be brilliant, cunning and manipulative. Although not mentioned directly, Petyr Baelish was also reckless and overconfident. A good example of this is challenging Brandon Stark, even when he knew he was younger and inexperienced than the Stark. He seems to have it in control as an adult, but there are indications that he might not always be able to monitor these two negative traits.

**Petyr Baelish Redeeming Quality:**

Petyrs redeeming quality is his love for Catelyn Stark, imagined or real. He seemed to love her genuinely and was willing to go to lengths including putting his life at risk to prove his love for her.

**Current Events and Petyr Baelish Past:**

His family background and personality become important in the context of his love for Catelyn Tully and her eventual rejection of his love. For someone who grew up with her and seemed to love her with an obsession, her marrying a Stark over him might have been a betrayal of his love but marrying a Stark might have added humiliation and shame.

Petyr;s family was not only insignificant with little to no wealth in comparison to the great noble families, but his family history of mercenaries and hedge knights was not something to brag about either. Petyr himself talks about his familys insignificance and the lessons he learned from it. Little Fingers family history, when compared to Starks, is both shameful and humiliating for a 15-year-old. Starks are the Warden of the Norths, Kings of Winter, and a family who can trace their origin to the First Men and great leaders like Brandon the Builder and Brandon the Breaker. Petyr knew competing with such a family was impossible on several levels.

The only way Littlefinger was able to display his love for Catelyn was a show of strength, which he failed at miserably. To add insult to injury, he was sent away from House Tully after challenging Brandon and failing along with Catelyn refusing to see or correspond with him.

**Facts from Books and Series:**

A) Hatred for Starks. LF is responsible for Stark deaths and all the ills that have befallen them in recent times.

B) Petyr is ambitious for both wealth and power. He thrives on Chaos and Appeals to Dark Side of Human Nature including greed, violence and hate to achieve this chaos and benefit from it. All in all his goal of chaos comes with unleashing evil.

*So, where am I going with this? My Theory:*

After being humiliated and having lost the love of his life, Petyr Baelish wanted to be powerful, wealthy and seek revenge ( however twisted or illogical) against the Starks. He did not have the wealth, army or alliances to achieve his goal. Under such circumstances, the intelligent, overconfident, ambition and reckless Petyrs only alternative was to reach out to someone extraordinarily powerful for assistance. Someone who could help him gain wealth and power and who hated Starks as much as he did. But who could that be?

**THE ONE TRUE ENEMY OF THE STARKS: THE ENEMY BRANDON THE BUILDER STARK DEFEATED AT THE AGE OF DAWN.**

**Evidence:**

**A) Agent of Chaos:**

Although no one believes White Walkers existed, stories did not cease to trickle in from Castle Black to the Citadel. For example, a couple of hundred years before the Doom of Valayria, Castle Black sent stories to Citadel of complete destruction of Hardhome and the screams they heard from cliffs above Hardome, where no one living had ever ventured.

Even with reports trickling in from time to time, the White Walkers didnt seem to venture close to Castle Black. It is only after Robert;s Rebellion and before John Arryns death that the Raiders started to disappear and stories of White Walker sightings began to emerge consistently.

One of the themes of fantasy novels is the idea that when societies forget values of compassion, justice, equality and spiritual nurturing, and obsess over maximising power, lust, giving way to greed, jealousy, hate and violence then evil is reborn, or it begins to thrive again. However, if this were the case, then there were several instances during the history of Westeros, from the time of the last Long Night to current period when they could have reemerged. So why now?

What if the reemergence of White Walkers depended not only on chaos and evil but also someone on the other side of the wall? An agent who can promote their interests and act as a bridge between the living and dead?

The story of 13th Commander after the Long Night in this context becomes necessary. It is believed he was seduced by a white corpse queen who for all purposed was a White Walker, while the commander of the Knight Watch. He married her and then established a reign of terror at Castle Black, with rumours reaching the Citadel and Winterfell of the practice of human sacrifice, cannibalism and necromancy. Although his reign was cut short by an alliance between Brandon the Braker and the King of Wildlings, it reinforces the fact that the White Walkers need men on the South side of the wall for their end goals. These men ( maybe a member of Stark Household is the key here and hence LF's obsession with Sansa) need to adopt evil ways and spread terror. Otherwise, the corpse queen could have targeted a Wildling King.

The traditional enemies of the Starks, like Bolton and Skaggs, could have also reached out to the White Walkers. However, being the descendants of First men, they either knew of the terror, over the years stopped believing WW existed, or Stark Bannermen were keeping an eye on them.

However, Petyr Baelish was not a descendant of the First Men, did not know the exact extent of the terror these creatures could unleash, and he was not under surveillance as a possible threat to North. Added to this Petyr was overconfident, reckless and above all, he was intelligent enough to learn the history, search for clues, reinforce its validity and then learn to reach out the Nights King and the Others.

We have already seen that the Nights King can connect with Greenseers. Are there any other instruments that could emulate Greenseers? Yes, the Glass Candles from Valayria. How could Petyr Baelish get a hand on one of those? Catelyn Stark mentions that LF was sent away from House Tully after challenging Brandon. But there is no further explanation of where he went or what he did before reemerge as a good friend of Lysa?

What if the events at Riverdale led to anger and anger led him to t pursuing the dark arts, which eventually led him to information about the White Walkers and Glass Candles?

There could be other ways he was able to establish connections; maybe he just happened to be in the right place at the right time. But his hate for Starks and ambition to prove he was a man worthy of Catelyn's love, might have driven him to seek out dark ways of achieving his goals.

He already had connections in Essos through his great-grandfather, a mercenary, where dark arts, sorcery are still prevalent. Further, Littlefinger was already sinister in many ways, so reaching out to the other side would not have been hard for him to do. It is believed that it was Dany's dragons that lit the candles, but there is no proof of this. Maybe the candle lights for only certain individuals or only a few know how to work it.

Back to Petry, my theory postulates he established a connection with the Others through the Glass Candle or another form of dark art and made a pact with the Others?

If he was successful in developing a relationship with the Others, then his enormous wealth, rise to power and behaviour since the start of the series makes complete sense.

He might have bargained with the devil in return for revenge, wealth and power, all three factors that had denied him the love of his life. However, to fulfil his ambitions he was also required by the WW to maximise chaos and appeal to the darker side of human nature to spread enough evil for Others to return to and for him to succeed in his goals.

Both of which Petyr Baelish has been doing successfully since the beginning of the story.

Interestingly, even when chaos and evil ruled since the end of the reign of the 13th Lord Commander, there was no indication of White Walkers sighting or Rangers missing since then. From what we can decipher, the events of missing Rangers and WW sightings are recent. How recent? Not during the time of Roberts Rebellion but after. Who is the one person, who emerges as a valuable player after the Rebellion, who was missing from Westeros politics before the Rebellion? LittleFinger.

**B) Interest in Valayrian Sword:**

Although Little Finer lost the dagger to Robert at a Tourney, ( shows recklessness), once he got it back, he seems to have the dagger beside him all the time(the knife was last seen when Petyr was eating fruit from it at his castle ). Additionally, it is believed it was Varys who sponsored Gendrys apprenticeship with Tobho Mott based on his description of the person as stout. However, Mott also described him as someone who is short with a beard. Short and brown beard both matches Littlefingers physical description. Additionally, while Varys was known to send gifts to Roberts illegitimate children, he never tried to hide the fact of his relationship with them. It could be possible, and Varys didnt know of Gendrys existence and if he knew it didnt make any sense that he would push for Gendry to learn how to forge a Valayrian sword. Varys seems to have little to no information about the White Walkers, and Valayrian steel doesn;t seem to be all that useful against a conventional army of living men.

But given Gendry's mother's background as a barmaid, and LFs business interests it could very well be that LittleFinger knew of his existence. If you remember, Valayrian sword is also made of magic and since Gendry is a Valayrian LF might have assumed he would be able to learn to make the sword quicker than someone without the blood of Valayria.

But why would Little Finger need Valayrian Swords? One reason could be that Petyr Baelish knows the fact that Valayrian swords are lethal to the Others. In his overconfidence, Littlefinger believes he can kill the Night King once he has achieved his goals. The other reason is that he is genuinely scared of his action or doesnt completely trust the others, and wants to procure weapons to protect himself from the Others, in case something goes wrong.

**C) The *PRIMARY EVIDENCE* of his involvement with the White Walkers is his *MOCKINGBIRD SIGIL*:**

Petyr Baelish for some unknown reason changed his personal sigil to a mockingbird at some unknown point in time. Not only did he change his sigil, but he wears it so that it is visible to everyone. Why such visibility? What is so symbolic about the mockingbird and why that bird? For a long time, I have tried to figure out the symbolism of a mockingbird. I have read several of them and while entertaining made little sense in the context of the character. However, then I came across this bit of information:

**""Mockingbirds are mythologically great birds in many Native American cultures. In *SHASTA INDIAN MYTHOLOGY, MOCKINGBIRD is the GUARDIAN OF THE DEAD*.""**

Yes, Mockingbird in Native American mythology is considered to be the protector of the dead. The dead in Song of Ice and Fire are none other than the White Walkers. Since Martin uses symbols to foreshadow events, the use of Mockingbird to provide us with clues of the importance of makes perfect sense. Petyr Baelish might not be a guardian in the conventional sense, but he is the man south of the wall representing the Others and their interests.

These are all speculations of course and I am still developing evidence to further my tinfoil theory. But Petyr Baelish character is too sinister, too evil and has been central to all the unfolding events, for him to be just another player with no real significant role. Would love to know your thoughts!

So a lot of people think that Danny will follow her father's(?) Path and become a ""Mad Queen"". I personally think she will fail at getting the throne, help defeat the white walkers, with only Drogon as the last surviving Dragon. It's too cliche for her to win and be The Queen. 
Alright so on to Jon. Some of us figured he was a Targ, and after season 6 we know have proof. He's now DAKINGINDANORF. I personally think even if the world finds out he's a Targ, he still wouldn't want to rule. He just wants to survive the second long night and kill the white walkers. I rambled a little sorry. But back to his blood. Back to his family. The history. What if during the work up to the battle with the Walkers or during the war, or maybe it's not connected. Something clicks in Jon's head, where he knows nothing, and turns him mad. Another mad Targ, but not the one people think. 
Just speculation and I don't think itll happen but we never known. Anyone see or think or hear of this theory. Could be interesting.

What will become of her story in S7? There are a few directions that it can go. 

1. Brienne is sworn to Sansa Stark. She is likely on her way back to Winterfell. Maybe a chance that she encounters Arya in the Riverlands before she goes, and takes her along for the ride back to Winterfell? (Sansa is looking for her and Arya wants to go back to Winterfell anyways) 

2. Brienne's relationship with Jaime. A great deal of emphasis has been put on Jaime and Brienne's relationship, and it's mentioned again when they talk at Riverrun. He says he doesn't want to fight her, and they exchange a longing glance as Brienne escapes. Will she have any further interactions with Jaime? As a Stark knight, she may have to kill him. 

3. In the books, Lady Stoneheart holds Brienne and Podrick hostage. She orders Brienne to either kill Jaime or face death herself (including Pod). Brienne agrees to kill Jaime. LSH is pissed at Brienne because she failed to protect Sansa and Arya. In the show, LSH likely won't make an appearance. How will she translate into the show? It seems like Arya has taken on the role of LSH, but she would have no reason to want to kill either Jaime or Brienne. Unless it somehow becomes known to Arya that Jaime pushed Bran from the window or wronged/injured or killed Ned and Jory, respectively. Will Arya be the one to command Brienne to kill Jaime? 

4. Brienne fails to negotiate with the Blackfish, Brynden Tully, resulting in his death and the loss of the Tully's control of Riverrun. Will Sansa dismiss Brienne for wronging her family and causing Brynden to die? 


These are all the scenarios that I could think of; please add more or add onto my thoughts!

One particular chapter I was interested in was Dany's chapter where she goes into the House of the Undying and is shown many visions (past/present/future?). One vision is one of her brother Rhaegar. Though it is not explicitly stated, through context clues you can figure out who this person is (since Dany never knew her older brother). The book states that the man ""had her brother's (Visery's) hair, but he was taller, and his eyes were a dark indigo rather than lilac."" The vision goes on to show the man playing the Harp as well as naming his second child, ""Aegon."" Also later in the chapter, she speaks to Jorah of this vision and they openly state that it was Rhaegar. 
ANYWAY, in the books, Tyrion is said to have ""hair so blonde it seemed white"" along with one green eye and one black eye. So now we know that dark indigo is a Targ trait (of Rhaegar who would in theory be Tyrion's half-brother) therefore laying out proof that Tyrion's black eye may just be a dark purple since he already has the hair.... 
I'm sure Tyrion's eye color  has been speculated previously, however it's nice finding more proof among the text. 
For those who don't know, along with his appearance, there are many hints that Tyrion may be a Targ including but not limited to: the Mad King's obsession with Joanna Lannister (Tyrion's mother who died birthing him), Tyrion's life-long obsession about dragons/having dreams about dragons, and the multiple statements by Tywin that he cannot prove that Tyrion is his true son.

I believe Jon snow is the prophecy as the prophecy says 'Born amidst salt and smoke, beneath a bleeding star.'
As we see on season 6 episode 2
https://youtu.be/w6j-60Td0a4
Jon snow is reborn with the help of malisandre. As we see she washes Jon snow with water which could very likely contain salt as salt is the best way to clean in an unmodernized world like GoT or also they wouldn't want to wash a body with drinking water and his hair is burned and there we have smoke.
The bleeding star is more complicated but I think I figured it out. You see malisandre's necklace is made of ruby (which comes from Reuben which is  latin for red or described  'colour of blood', Reuben is also a Hebrew word meaning 'behold, a son') , but I don't think it's any ordernary necklace, I think it is star ruby. If you have time please read this article which goes in depth of the meaning but I will use a few quotes.
http://www.crystalvaults.com/crystal-encyclopedia/ruby?p=3

'Star Ruby has the same metaphysical properties as Ruby, but with increased healing and magical energies. It is most powerful at full moon. The Light of the Soul is reflected and grounded within the star of the Ruby, and amplifies ones internal resources and fortitude. It is extremely potent for those inclined to self-harm or self-neglect, and is quite beneficial in overcoming sexual dysfunction or the trauma of sexual or power abuse and suppressed anger. As a stone of spiritual Light, it can be used by Light workers and healers to integrate high-frequency energy into the body, and assists one in recognizing the true abundance of life. [Eason, 71][Ahsian, 334]'
As we can see it all makes perfect sense the ruby is used by light workers and healers malisandre's necklace is the bleeding star.

Upon the finale of season 6, when Jamie gives Cersei that look after she blows up the Sept of Baelor...a new favorite theory is that Jamie will be the one to kill Cersei.
Well, I found a passage where Cersei is talking to Sansa....
&gt; ""...Do you want to be loved, Sansa?"" 
&gt; ""Everyone wants to be loved.""
&gt; ""I see flowering hasn't made you any brighter,"" said Cersei. ""Sansa, permit me to share a bit of womanly wisdom with you on this very special day. Love is poison. A sweet poison, yes, but it will kill you all the same."" [End Chapter]

For example, all of Jon's siblings refer to him as ""brother"" except for Sansa, who refers to him as ""half brother."" He grew up along Robb, who treated him as an equal. He was very close with Arya and even had Needle made for her. He was seemingly pretty close with Bran and Rickon too. 

Rewatching their reunion at Castle Black is far more emotional than the first time I saw it and it explains Jon's reaction. When I first saw it I wondered why he didn't run into her arms right away. He stared at her in bewilderment for a moment at first. And their chat when she apologizes for the way she treated him makes much more sense as well.

Warg - See the enemies intel as much as you want, don't act too rashly though, it might become too obvious if the enemy realise theres a constant rabbit following their every move. If warged animal dies, the backlash is pretty big to the user. Can be used as a long range mental disruptor (? in the books). 


Shadow assassin - Sacrifice 10 years of your life force to kill any target, instant success, extremely good vs competent commanders. Stannis at his age of 30ish can only use twice before it kills him, need shadow binders. 


Facelessmen - A high cost assassin that has guaranteed success, but what if you hard a trainee instead? Also have to wait for a potentially long time. 


Glass candles - Book only artefact, essentially can be used as video chats between people, quite cost efficient, need the presence of dragons in the world to work. 


Glamour - A cheaper, discount version of faceless magic, don't need to pay a hefty sum for it and widely available, but it can be broken if the target really focus at you and look hard enough.


Zombification - Turn one soldier of your own into the undead, losses all tactics and intelligence, but gains massive strength. 


Weather control/conjure storm - Used by Euron in the books and Stannis in the show, requires a lot of blood sacrifice to work but this magic is pretty large scale, but affects both present parties. Possibly the cause of the shatter of hammer of dorne (? not confirmed). 


Seeing into the flames - Sees a potential future and avoid danger, every red priests can do this so is fairly available, but not very accurate. 


Scorpion venom enhanced by magic - Used by Oberyn martell, guaranteed kill on anyone but must require blade contact with the flesh. 


**Special mentions (these are all fairly overpowered):**


Wildfire - Pretty much nukes in high quantity, inextinguishable by water, explosive, has magical properties, won battles before. 


Dragons - Win battle just on its own, Nuff said, but does require time to nurture correctly, Dany needed 5 years for dragons to grow at least reasonable size for destruction. Weak vs gorilla warfare, can be assassinated, can be poisoned (? not confirmed, just theory), near useless if is less than three years old. There are also anti-dragon weapons such as sky hooks that abuse the low range of dragon flames to hook them out of the sky, used in dance of dragons. 


Mass undead resurrection - Another broken magic, can easily turn everyone into your own soldier, can only be killed by fire, you must be a white walker though... 


Resurrection by Rhollar (?) - That guaranteed assassin that you sacrificed a lot for? yep just nullified it. 


Super human/Legendary fighters such as Arthur Dayne - Already wields strongest sword in known existence, can 1v6 without a sweat.

&gt;""This is not life, *when will he be the way he was?*""

&gt;""When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east,"" said Mirri Maz Duur. ""When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves. When your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child. Then he will return, and not before.""

The show omits ""when your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child."" And in the last Daenerys chapter it is hinted that she has her period. So maybe she shall bear a child? 

Then, in the show, Daenerys enters the House of Undying, where she enters the throne room where the Red Keep is partially destroyed and snow is falling in. She walks up to the throne, and is about to touch it, when she hears the cry from one of her dragons.  She follows it the cry to a blizzard wasteland outside where her son and Khal Drogo are in a tent.  They talk, and then Daenerys realizes that they she can't stay there and repeats the prophecy.

[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7VuGknEfQY)

Let's break it down:

I start of with the middle of the prophecy:

&gt;When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves

Because if you think about it: When winter comes, the seas will freeze and *dry* out. Blizzards blow strong winds and can cause avalanches. Or perhaps the Volcanos in Valyria will erupt in a similar manner to the Doom of Valyria.

Also, the Dothraki sea has dried up.

&gt;When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east

Quentyn Martell is known as ""the son of sun"" (the Martells are a House whose sigil is a spear through the sun) came from the West but died in the east.

&gt;When your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child. Then he will return, and not before.

Again, it is hinted in ADWD that she had a period.  Maybe Mirri was saying when the White Walkers take over that Khal shall be able to be as he once was. But, Daenerys killed Drogo.  Maybe after the Winter's War, Daenerys shall die?  Thoughts?",11,3,False,self,,,,,

Jon and Arya were close before the family was separated.  In some ways there's a parallel to her personality and Ygritte's.  Both are skilled fighters, both have a cheeky insouciance towards Jon, and both would rather die than yield in battle.  

Whether both Jon and Arya actually survive to the final page of the novels/moment of the series, could that kind of relationship (as part of GRRMs original conception of the books) still be in the cards?

I remember the first thing that really caught my interest was the mystery of who tried to have Bran killed. Of course, everybody immediately thinks Cersei or Jaime, but I found it very fascinating considering the possibility that Tyrion really did do it. To my knowledge, for at least most of the book, we didn't get any confirmation on whether it was true or false. In Tyrion's chapters, they tended to skirt around that. Any circumstances where he denied doing it were situations where anybody would have lied if it were true.

Makes me sad the show never concluded that storyline. A lot of the people only watching the show don't know the plot twist that it was Joffrey. Mostly because they simplified his character a  good bit in regards to his motivations. ",28,31,False,self,,,,,

On a side note, Varys is almost certainly a Targaryen. Even the name Varys sounds Targaryen if you ignore the V. It also explains why he is entirely hairless, and why a sorcerer (likely a follower of the lord of light) wanted his member for a ritual. It is likely he has kings blood. Also explains why he is so unique in his occupation of secrecy; he's been flawlessly keeping his own all his life. And, why he would side with Dany and Dorne.

I can suspend my disbelief because the show can't contain everything and had to cut significant plots. But why include Varys in the show as a rival to Little-Finger if he turns out to be just a generic double-agent? (And a bad one at that).

Note their aren't very many nobles under the age of majority and the only birth we've seen is in a flashback 25+ years ago. This will cause another crisis in a score years.       
   
Let's see who's responsible among the nobility    
Robert - tried - but victim of moon tea and politics (all but one of his bastards killed). gone     
Renley - no help. gone     
Stannis - murdered his daughter (Shireen was not too much the looker but could have made a nice wife for someone and bore children)  shadowbabies don't count.  gone     
Jaime &amp; Cersei - the best heir producers we have - but so political they outlived them all
Tyrion - no help, certainly wasn't interested in doing his duty with Sansa     
Littlefinger - probably the biggest supplier of moon tea in Westeros - seems more interested in taking other people's heirs than having his own     
Rob - on this forum Rob is much maligned - but he was at least working the problem      
Sansa - celibacy then moon-tea - she's dodging it    
Jon Snow - the love lost loser thing is getting old. it sorta worked in the Night's Watch - but he's a King now - time to get an heir    
Arya - maybe later - doesn't seem to be into the whole ""mom"" thing     
Bran - ?, doesn't seem interested if he's even capable    
Margaery - she tried, but never came through, gone now    
Loras - no help, gone         
Robyn Arryn - like the geek who is the only male at the prom - somebody will probably be willing     
Theon - no help   
Yara - not interested     
Euron - seems like he could serve - but .. laterz (if he's still alive)     
Oberyn &amp; Ellaria - the Sand Snakes are okay - not exactly heirs .. Oberyn's gone now...   
Edmure Tully - seems like the old boy is trying     
Freys - there may be heirs somewhere - but they may not be nobles any longer      
Boltons - Roose tried to do his part - fratricide is a problem...   both he and Ramsay gone        
Daenerys - maybe sterile - dragons don't count   
Jorah - freindzoned 4ever        
Missandei &amp; Grey Worm - not happening    
Varys - nope     
Sam &amp; Gilly - working the problem, but not nobles    
Thormund - He might become a noble and he might be willing to try if the partner was right    
Brienne - doesn't seem interested - wants to be a drama queen not a mom     
Pod - May eventually be left to repopulate the noble class of Westeros himself

If you were gendry and you just escaped what would you do first, well in my opinion Gendry was tortured at harenhall and watched his friends die by the LANNISTERS; So gendry could have rode to the storm lands and started gathering Lords to his cause to fight the Lannister and then Gendry learns about Robb Starks death, but who was Gendry best friend? Arya Stark, oh shit, Gendry needs revenge since the starks are helpless, Sansa in King's landing, Jon in the nights watch, and Arya who knows where she is. Why would men follow gendry you would ask, well, gendry literally the only thing left of house baratheon and if Jon can be warden of the north then Gendry can ride for baratheon. So 3 seasons of gathering men and houses is a lot of time, but I think in season 7 gendry is going to be revealed with his army wearing stag armour and yellow cloth. Jon and daenerys will unite house targareyan and ""stark"", and Arya and Gendry will unite house Baratheon and Stark. Also Gendry will show up just in time for the battle of the dead. I mean George doesn't write characters that are useless and Gendry hasn't served what he can to the story yet.

Before I post links to the podcast we started about watching **Game of Thrones**, I just want to give a bit of back story. I've never tried watching the show (or read the books) until late last year. It was hard for me to get into it, falling asleep during the pilot several times. Well, my buddy convinced me that I'd get hooked if I just followed my three episode rule (details on the next week during our Lord Snow discussion). He also promised we could talk about it on a podcast, which I'm never one to shy away from.

We're hoping that this becomes a fun little project while we wait for the next season of **GOT**, hopefully some of you join us for the journey as a newbie watches **Game of Thrones** week to week and discusses and theorizes about something that has been available for years.

And now, here's our podcast:

**Late to the Game... of Thrones**

[Episode I - Winter is Coming](http://www.thatentertains.com/late-to-the-game-of-thrones-episode-i-winter-is-coming/)

Winter is (finally) here! We may be late to the game (of thrones), but its never too late to become a fan! Mike DeAngelo, a seasoned fan of HBOs Game of Thrones, invites Kev to finally check it out. It took a while, but he finally did it, and they're running through fresh recaps, starting with the pilot episode, Winter is Coming.

[Episode II - The King's Road](http://www.thatentertains.com/late-to-the-game-of-thrones-episode-ii-the-kings-road/)

The boys are back (in town) and are ready to talk about 1.02, The Kings Road. Before talking about the episode, the boys gush over their new theme song and talk about Roberts Rebellion as a buddy cop prequel. Mike is proud of Kev getting names right!

Jon would be warden of the north, but with much less bloodshed.  The Boltons would have been smashed by Stannis's army, had Jon been able to rally all the northern houses to his cause (which would have been easier since he would not have been seen as the man who brought the wildlings south of the wall).

Now hear me out, cause I know it's controversial, and I know y'all gonna shoot it down, but just entertain the following thought:

- Sansa counted on her brother miscalculating Ramsay and engage him in open conflict. Her goal was to fool Ramsay into believing Jon had no chance at all, which is one of the main reasons he draws his forces out of Winterfell (as well as the fact that he doesn't want to look weak). 

- Sansa realized that calling in the Knights of the Vale early would not be as effective as sending them in once Ramsay had commited too many of his men. Once the Bolton men were in the fray, they would need to reposition themselves to fight back the incoming Cavalry, which would allow Jon's force to attack them in the rear.

Now of course, there are holes in this crackpot this:

- Why didn't just Sansa tell Jon? They could still plan to lure Ramsay's forces into the fray, even if it meant sending most of his men to their deaths (similar to when Robb sent a smaller portion of his host to attack Tywin whilst capturing Jaime Lannister). 

All right then. Tinfoilhat back on.

I think an off screen death was intended to be a lot more powerful than it was portrayed because of his short relationship with Jamie. 

Jamie truly respected Bryndyn Tully. I think his cold, hard resolve may have reminded him of Tywin in some way. He didn't actually want him to die, and you could tell when he got the news. The audience was meant to feel the shock along with Jamie.",36,64,False,self,,,,,

Warning: tinfoil ahead. 

So I have started a re-read of ASOIAF and this quote stood out to me:

""Catelyn thought of the three children she must lose."" (GoT, pg 67)

So far, we know that Rickon and Robb have died. There are three Stark children left (not counting Jon in light of recent reveals, as well as it being Catelyn's children being discussed). This seems like foreshadowing that 3 of the children will die. 

However, I find it interesting that it is the two who were not intended to go south that were the two she lost. This is in contrast to the implication of Catelyn's statement. What caught my eye about the quote was the foreknowledge of Bran not going to court even though he was intended to. I know Bran has huge plot armour, but this lead me to believe that Catelyn would lose the three children that did not go to court (the opposite of what she intended by the statement.) Rickon and Robb are already gone; I wouldn't be surprised if Bran follows. 

Edit: the context is that Bran and the girls were supposed to be leaving for king's landing, and Cat remarks about losing 3 of her children. All the stark children are healthy and whole at this point (including Bran).",13,0,False,self,,,,,

At some points, they seem like sadistic demons of pure evil, like when they decapitate corpses and arrange their bodies in weird shapes. Other times they show mercy, like they have shown to Will (first episode), Sam (twice) and Craster's babies.

This got me thinking. What do Will, Sam and Craster's babies have in common ? They are all good people. They haven't done anything to cause suffering to another being.

What if the White Walkers are like the Ghost Rider and they can sense how much suffering humans have caused and then they kill them and raise them as wights to enforce their mission ? Maybe that's the directive the Children have given them: purge all wicked creatures. If so, it would be a genius move, as humans are by far the most cruel species.

And before you say ""But what about the wight children and the horses and the other animals that they raised ?"" This theory only concerns the White Walkers' behavior for killing. Them finding corpses of children and animals that died from sickness or the cold and raising them as wights doesn't require killing them directly.

So this would make the White Walkers the ultimate pacifier weapons. Purge the wicked and leave only the pure hearted behind. They turned on the Children because they became allies with the evil savage men that burned forests and killed wildlife for personal gain.

So if you are a newborn or someone that would never hurt a fly, the White Walkers have no beef with you. It would make for one hell of a message towards being more altruistic and a better person.

This will draw out Jaime Lannister and he'll be forced to march with a substantial part of the Lannister forces in King's Landing to retake or rescue their home.         
After Jaime passes the Blackwater Rush on the Goldroad, Daenerys should land at Duskendale or some other port out in the Blackwater and get in between Jaime and King's Landing.  He will turn around when he hears of this - but he will have to face the Dragons and Dothraki in the open field - not in a siege.       
With Jaime defeated in the field - the siege of King's Landing should be easy. 
         
Other strategies might be - sail right into Blackwater Bay and take King's Landing with the overwhelming force from the sea (and air).      
-or-       
Land at the Sunspear or some port on the Sea of Dorne and march up Westeros building the army as you go (to include the forces of the Reach &amp; Dorne).  Let King's Landing stew for awhile in the thought of the giant army and three dragons approaching - there could be deserters...            
-and/or-      
Retake Dragonstone (from minimal Lannisters or Stannis retainers) and attack King's Landing with the Dragons from the air - weakening it until you are ready for one of the other strategies.

Arianne is a femme fatale who is a fully fleshed out character and seems like a generally good person overall (relative to the other characters in ASOIAF at least...maybe not a good person by modern standards idk but that's a slippery slope)

[A Clash of Kings](http://www.moddb.com/mods/a-clash-of-kings)

Mod for RPG game Mount &amp; Blade: Warband set in during the time of ""A Clash of Kings"" .

Start as a common peasant and climb your way up to become a lord, sellsword, tourney knight, bandit, merchant, soldier and much much more. Join the armies of Tywin Lannister, Stannis or Renly Baratheon, Robb Stark and fight their enemies.


[A World of Ice and Fire](http://www.moddb.com/mods/a-world-of-ice-and-fire)

Another Mount &amp; Blade: Warband mod.


[Crusader Kings 2: A Game of Thrones](http://www.moddb.com/mods/crusader-kings-2-a-game-of-thrones-ck2agot)

My personal favorite is this mod for grand strategy game Crusader Kings 2.

Start as any lord or king from -4 Before conquest to 302 After conquest.

Play as Robb Stark, defeat the Lannister forces, sack Kings Landing and take Joffrey, Tommen, Cersei as prisoners and avenge your father. Or play as Tywin Lannister and make sure that does not happen.


[Age of petty kings](http://www.moddb.com/mods/westeros-age-of-petty-kings)

Mod for Medieval II: Total War: Kingdoms set during the Andal invasion.

- Cleganebowl happens (get hype). No idea who wins

- Cersei about to blow everything  up with wildfire, gets stabbed in the back by Ser Jaime Lannister. This would fulfill the prophecy, as well as making for some interesting story. This would also mean Jaime has killed a long with his right hand and a queen with his left

- Ser Jaime or Tyrion appointed Lord of Casterly Rock by Queen Danaerys Targaryen

- Tyrion and Jaime make peace and embrace. Alternatively a subplot occurs with Jaime hating Tyrion for his part in Tywin's death

- Jon learns that he is a Targaryen from Bran

- Jon and Danaerys ally, either by falling in love, or just because the White Walkers are coming and they need to fight together

- Dany dies, either in the final battle, or because Melisandre killed her

- Someone (Jon, Jorah, Tyrion, Bran?) becomes Azor Ahai in their grief and their sword becomes Lightbringer from Dany's blood

- White Walkers proceed to get wrecked by Azor Ahai

- Azor Ahai dies, either in confronting the Night King or killed by the new King on the Iron Throne, Petyr Baelish

- Sansa marries Petyr

- Sansa either kills Petyr herself or hires Arya to kill him (possibly with the help of Jorah, Jaime, Jon or Tyrion)

- Sansa or Arya should know that Petyr betrayed their father before they kill him

- Sansa becomes Lady Sansa Stark, Queen of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm

- The Hand of the Queen is really whoever is left. Some candidates include: Olenna Tyrell, Bran Stark, Jorah Mormont, Jaime Lannister, Tyrion Lannister or Jon Snow

- Sansa could marry Robin Aryyn to secure her power

Securing the border - Moat Cailin, White Port and also west coast, Euron is still undeclared in his diplomacy towards North
Foreign policy - Eyrie is already an ally and they have to answer the call if it gets attacked, marching south would be tough; North should not be marching more south than the neck and thus should not meddle in Riverrun politics in order not to get again vulnerable.

But I've been thinking about where the series is going and what the aftermath has been, since Martin has described the conclusion of the series as ""bittersweet"". My tinfoil is that, after winter has passed and a rightful ruler sits upon the Iron Throne (or whatever political position takes it's place), Tyrion will become lord of Highgarden and the Reach. My theory is founded on how Tyrion states he wants to spend the rest of his life, with his little vineyard and sweet wine that only his closest friends could drink. But Highgarden is famous for the Arbor, the best vineyard in Westeros, and I can see Dany gifting Tyrion this land after everying is said and done. 

But why not Casterly Rock, you may ask? Well, my belief is that Tyrion simply wouldn't want it. The mines have gone dry, and besides that, Tyrion has too many bad memories there. But with House Tyrell dying with Lady Olenna, it would make sense to appoint a new lord to the region. I believe that with Tyrion's experience as a civic leader, he would make an excellent lord. 

All of this is of course, complete speculation and rest upon the fact that Dany would ever let her Hand leave her side. But it would give us a bittersweet ending, of all the allied survivors of winter toasting to the fallen with the first batch of wine made under Tyrion's keen eye. ",16,16,False,self,,,,,

My question is, how does she expect them to behave? 

It is true that thinking things through is not her strong suit, but she cannot overlook the fact that they will pillage, burn and rape the ever loving fuck out of the entirety of Westeros. She claims to care so much about human rights by freeing slaves, but the suffering she will unleash upon Westeros with the Dothraki will shatter any reputation of kindness and compassion she has built up. Innocent women and children will be raped, infants will be cut out of their mother's wombs, etc, etc. It will be horrible. Even as a Khal/Khaleesi, she will not be able to stop this normal behavior of the Dothraki. It is part of their culture and no real Khal would make such a request of them, it would show weakness. One of the aspects of the Unsullied Dany seemed to like in season 2 was that they do not rape, kill innocents, or steal. The Dothraki are not the Unsullied and will do all these things. 

Does Dany just not care? Is it worth it, to cause untold suffering just so she can sit on a throne she has never seen? This does not seem to fit with the moralistic Dany we have been presented with so far. Yes, she has been cruel and dishonorable before (killing masters who had no part in killing the children and breaking her word with the owners of the Unsullied), but I have always seen her as wanting to protect the common people. 

Note: Please don't talk about how the Dothraki are likely to die in the Winter and this is not something we have to worry about. I want to talk about the principle of thing, not scenarios that cripple the Dothraki. ",21,5,False,self,,,,,

One thing I see talked about is the prospect of Jon becoming the King, because he has Targ Blood and is presumably the best position on the line of succession, but I don't find this convincing at all for a couple of reasons.

Firstly there's no credible proof to show the people of Westeros, we only have Bran's Visions and Howland Reed, both of which can be easily dismissed. If you lived in Kings Landing and a Noble Boy and a lord that lives like a Hermit come in, the boy claims he has visions of Jon being a Targ and the lord backs the kid up but has little standing in the nobility, you wouldn't believe them. If they came with an army, you'd treat them like they treated Stannis in S2, an invader attempting to take the city, you'd certainly not take his side based on his claim. As for Dany believing Jon's ancestry, I don't think Bran and Howland's word will convince her to beleive Jon is a Targaryen.

Secondly, I don't think the people of Westeros care about the line of succession, after seeing what Joffrey did, the 'rightful king' according to the law, would they still be interested in supporting the one favoured by the line of succession? Also with Cersei's reign of terror in King's Landing after killing all the nobles who had any pull in the royal court, it seems like the ruler of Westeros is based on who has the greatest army rather than than any rightful claim.

So if Jon does become King, I doubt being a Targaryen will aid him in anyway, in fact it'll probably be the pull of his reputation as a Stark which aids him in amassing an army large enough to take and hold Westeros, as well as Cersei's reign of terror causing the people to turn to anyone else to save them. Apart from the Targayren connection to the Throne, the other implications of Jon being a Targaryen, could be Jon being able to ride a dragon or Jon being extremely fire resistant like Dany.

I'm having trouble seeing how R+L=J presents any practical impact on the story. Is my reasoning wrong? Am I missing something obvious?",46,19,False,self,,,,,

Westeros is Europe. The dothraki are probably Middle East. The slaves are definitely Africans. The Yi Ti are definitely 'China'. The 'game of thrones' is like the war of the five kings.

 In all the arguments the only thing people seem to be basing the climates of areas on is latitude.  They dont seem to realize that elevation and rainfall/humidity are generally lower in Essos.
To put it simply, it'll snow in Westeros and it wont in Essos(it will in some places but hardly any compared to Westeros) and snow lowers the temperature a lot.  
And for the people who say ""but deserts get really cold at night"" this happens because there's little humidity in the air so it becomes very easy to heat up and cool down.  So the sun makes it hot but when its gone none of the heat stays.  So seasons wouldnt really affect them too hard except maybe longer nights.
Lastly, even if it was colder in the Dothraki Sea than in Westeros, Westeros would still have it worse because of snow and moisture.  You do not want to be wet when its -20 F and with snow falling from the sky, being blown straight at you by winds, and covering all the ground and roofs it could get hard to stay dry.

Idk if the Dothraki could survive Winter and honestly, I doubt D&amp;D will acknowledge it, I just hate when people argue without knowing anything anything about their argument.

They last for years, people born in one season may not see that same season again for another decade or more. Currently, we've arrived at what is expected to be the longest and coldest winter in a millennium.

It has been asked before here on this subreddit how the people of Planetos track ""years"" if the seasons themselves last for ""years"". And it has also been pointed out that Maesters and other learned people can track the passage of a year by the movement of the stars. Whenever the stars have reset to their original positions, they know a year has passed.

This means Planetos doesn't move through seasons like Earth (obviously).

Earth passes through every season during its orbit around the sun, if Planetos did this, every season would be experienced before the stars reset. Merely putting Planetos into a wider orbit would not solve this, as even though the seasons would be longer, they would all be passed through before the stars returned to their original positions. In other words, before a year has passed.

But Earth doesn't get its seasons by its orbit alone, its orbit simply determines the length of said seasons. The main factor contributing to the seasons in the real world is the axial tilt of our planet. Earth has an axial tilt of 23.5 degrees, give or take. Thanks to this, during one portion of the Earths orbit, a hemisphere could either be facing away, or towards the sun, creating either winter or summer, respectively. Other times, the hemispheres are facing the sun side-on, creating both spring and fall.

The Earths axial tilt, and its stability in its position, creates the seasons we know and love. So what does this have to do with Planetos? Planetos (according to this theory) has no stable axial tilt.

Planetos instead swings from small to greater degrees of tilt. For some years Westeros' hemisphere is tilting more towards Solos (Planetos' star) than others. This creates the years-long summers and winters, while its drifting from these extremes creates Spring and Autumn.

""But why would Planetos do this when Earth doesn't?""

Good question. Earth has one major benefit keeping its axial tilt stable: a large (relatively speaking) Moon. Even though the Moon has only 1/6th the mass of Earth, it exerts enough of a effect on Earth to keep its tilt around 23.5 degrees with very small variation. This is also why Earths seasons will begin to variate in the next couple billion years as the Moon slips into an increasingly wider and wider orbit (it's drifting away at a rate of ~1.5"" every year).

""Wait, Planetos has a moon (henceforth known as Lunos), we've seen it, and Drogo called Daenerys 'Moon of my life'.""

Good point, Planetos does have a moon. However, this doesn't immediately mean the Planetos-Lunos relation is equivalent to the Earth-Moon relation. It's been established that Planetos is larger than Earth, so a Moon-sized Lunos would have less of an effect on Planetos to begin with. If Lunos is smaller than our Moon (albeit closer to appear as large as our own), than it would have even less. 

So Planetos might experience this axial drift, known in our world as true polar wander, but it doesn't appear to drift to extremes like the poles facing directly at its star. Instead, some sense of order seems to be present. If it wandered randomly, than civilization, even medieval ones like on Westeros, would be hard pressed to come by.

The theory extends that Planetos' polar wander was once uncontained. The lands we now know as Westeros and Essos experienced wild seasonal change: the lands of The North dried to barren wastelands and the Shivering Sea warmed, while Dorne and the Dothraki Sea froze into tundras. Perhaps, an ancient people, perhaps the evolutionary ancestors to the Children of the Forest, naturally found this habitat unlivable, and in a large collective use of magic, fought to bring stability to the seasons. They succeeded to a degree, Planetos' polar wander was bound to be stuck between two much smaller extremes, not enough to dry The North, or freeze Dorne. But due to the imperfect nature of magic, as well as the crude and basic use of it by this ancestral race, meant Planetos' axis still drifted. Seasons stabilized somewhat, but due to the continued polar wander, meant they could last for years.

Over the years, the Maesters studying the stars created four sets of star positions (one for every season), saying if the stars were in one of these four positions, then a year has passed. Eventually, a calendar with weeks and months would be developed so the simple man can track the years.

**In conclusion, Planetos experienced what we know as Polar Wander, where the axial tilt of the planet swung wildly, creating extreme and unstable seasons. An ancient magic-using race attempted to stabilize the planet, and somewhat succeeded. Tundras no longer dried, and deserts no longer froze, but depending on its tilt, and the time it spends at that certain tilt, summers and winters can last for the years the do in the series. Spring and Autumn occur when Planetos shifts between its summer position, and it's winter position. Years were determined if the positions of the stars matched the charts they (Maesters and other astronomers) had for that particular season. If they did, they'd know a complete orbit has been made.**",10,14,False,self,,,,,

Peytr Baelish calls it a ""lie"".  

I was trying to wrap my head about it, and I began to study the Targaryen family tree.

We have Aegon, Visenya, and Rhaenys.  I remember when Dany talked about naming her dragons... Thinking about Rhaegar naming his children- she pondered ""why no Visenya"".

Then, in ""Game of Thrones"" I stumbled upon Tywin teaching Tommen about being a good king.  He mentioned Orys I.  The only Orys we know is Orys Baratheon.  He was the first Hand of the King, and a rumored bastard of Aegon's father.

So, I started doing some research, and I think I found something- using word etymology, and some of Tolkien's philology of language (Tolkien was the man when it came to building fantasy languages.)

So- Rhaenys.  Rhae means mother.  We see this ""root"" in the books through the ""Rhoyne"" river- worshipped as the ""Mother"".  ""Visenya"" is a loss until I check Tolkien's history (Silmarillion)- specifically the ""rings of power"".

I stumble upon an elf named Daeron, who created the Cirtein (sp?) language- a scholar and sailor.  There are two Daeron's in the Targaryen lineage.  It mentions the nature of rings- Daeron had one that he gave to Gandalf.  What is interesting was that it was one of three: one meant ""gold"", one ""senya"" meant water, and last narya ""fire""- the ring of fire.

So Visenya's name means water- why her line was stopped.  

Now to the issue of Orys.  Orys tends to mean ""the One"" or ""divine""- seems to stem from Horus/Osiris in origin- basically ""divine leader"".  Makes sense- he started the Baratheon line, but he was still a ""hand of the king"".

Aegon was a doozie, the problem with Aegon is that ""ae"" doesn't really exist in history, but ""ea"" does.  Basically, it's just a sound.  ""Gon"" does have a meaning.  It is synonymous with ""Gond"" meaning ""stone"" or ""protector""-cool.  Back to ""ae""- tends to only show up as ""aeg"" which means ""piercing"".

This shows up in myth- the shield ""aegis"" given by Zeus was thought to be ""unable to be pierced"".

So, what does this mean...?

Aegon was the bastard- Orys was the pure blood.

The quote given to Orys ""my shield, my stalwart, my strong right arm"" actually reflects the origin of Aegon.

These root words are carried throughout the line- Aemon/Aemond means ""protector of man"".  Maegor means ""piercing evil"".  Daemon means ""shadow of man"".  

What is kind of scary, though is this.  There was a queen named Naerys- married to Aegon the IV.  She was considered very devout, a woman of the seven.  Naerys should be a derivative of ""fire"", but Daenerys has a different meaning.  ""Dae"" as in ""Daemon"" refers to shadow, so ""Daenerys"" means ""Shadow"" of fire.

So, we remember Melisandre's words- ""shadows are the work of Rh'llor- you can't have shadows without light"".

Also interesting, Qoherys- the first family to own Harrenhal after the death of House Hoare may have an unusual meaning.  Qohor, in Essos"" is near the river Rhyone.  It's branch- the ""Qhyone"" means Dark Sister.  Qohor is know for one religion specifically- the Black Goats of Qohor.  It is possible that Qoherys means- ""Black"" ""Fire"".

On a funny note: 

Daario Naharis using Tolkien's language actually means..... ""The horse to be ridden by the ruler""- haha!

Also, just realized- Rhaegar actually breaks out to mean ""the mother evil"" or born of the evil mother.
So, it's possible that his mother caused the tragedy at Summerhall...",11,0,False,self,,,,,

Firstly, I'm obviously assuming that the White Walkers invasion is repelled, either at the wall or within Westeros itself. Obviously there's a bunch of long-lasting legacies at stake, namely that of Lannister and Stark, but Daenerys will likely have the largest impact on history in terms of fame (I'm assuming whatever Jon ends up doing is going to be understated and kept largely unknown to the world).  
&amp;nbsp;

Whereas everyone who doesn't already know Daenerys' name is going to, very soon. Obviously there's kind of only two outcomes here: Daenerys invades Westeros and restores the Targaryen dynasty to its rightful place, or she is repelled and defeated (Only way I can see this happening is if she and her army are essentially sacrificed to stop the White Walkers but it's the end result). So how do the residents of Westeros view her in these two situations?  
&amp;nbsp;

**Situation One: Daenerys' invasion is ultimately unsuccessful, she is either killed or forced to run back to Essos or further, how is she seen?**  
&amp;nbsp;

As we know, the winners of history get to write the books. Any of Dany's intentions or good points are going to be instantly forgotten. In the same vein that Robert Baratheon vilified Rhaegar to suit his side of the story, Daenerys will likely suffer a similar fate. And let's face it, she has plenty of material to feed that story. The Masters of Slaver's Bay will be quick to spill the beans on how she killed the Thirteen of Qarth before stealing anything she could lay her hands on. Astapor will talk of her trickery and lies that she used to steal the Unsullied before slaughtering the noble business men she fooled. Yunkai will talk of how she used a sellsword company that she gained allegiance of by seducing one of it's captains and convincing him to kill his partners before abandoning him for a husband later on.  
&amp;nbsp;

Meereen will obviously have no shortage of complaints. There's the crucifixion of the masters, the fact she allowed her beastly dragons to feast on livestock and children, fed yet more masters to them before abandoning the city in its hour of need only to return and slaughter yet more masters before abandoning the city once more.  
&amp;nbsp;

Now, we have to guess what would happen in the invasion, but it's not exactly hard to imagine the type of thing that can be dreamt up to paint her bad. The evil Targaryens, already ousted, made an attempt to conquer Westeros once more, a huge army came and caused untold death and destruction (unavoidable).     
&amp;nbsp;

A hundred years from now, Daenerys could easily be painted as a violent dictator who herself had no discernible qualities other than she burned her own husband to take use of dark magic that gave her dragons. If anyone else had dragons, would she have succeeded? Of course not. Unable to cope with the fact her family, and specifically her rapist brother, had been defeated, she sent countless people to their deaths to satisfy her own goals. When she failed, she was revealed to be the foolish woman she was. Her dark, incestuous family finally came to and end and the Starks/Lannisters/Someone else took their rightful place as rulers of Westeros.  
&amp;nbsp;

**Scenario two: Daenerys is successful in her invasion of Westeros, retaking the Iron throne and restoring the Targaryen dynasty and ushering in a new age of dragons. How is she seen?**  
&amp;nbsp;

The endless list of Dany's titles only grows with her liberation of Westeros. Westeros had suffered through a terrible, bloody war where everyone had sought a crown and used the smallfolk as their pawns. To top this, Cersei Lannister had killed countless innocents in an effort to save her own skin before having her own terrible rule. Not forgetting, this was not that long after her deceased husband usurped the entire realm because the woman he desired loved someone else.   
&amp;nbsp;

Daenerys started off by surviving rape and multiple assassination attempts that occurred merely because of her birth. Putting her people at the forefront of everything, and swept a wave of liberation across Slaver's Bay. She gave the long oppressed Unsullied their freedom and punished their masters. She liberated Yunkai before moving onto Meereen where she refused to leave while the Sons of the Harpy tore at the city. When she finally did leave, it was only to take her dragon away before any harm could come to the city. After all, she even locked two of them up for the good of the people. Risking her life and yet more rape, she won the Dothraki's loyalty and returned in the city's hour of need, crushing the masters attack with her dragons, while causing minimal casualties.  
&amp;nbsp;

Knowing that she couldn't leave Westeros to its terrible fate, Daenerys gathered more people to her cause. She took in the fleeing Ironborn who were cruelly ousted by their uncle. She helped the only surviving Tyrell, a tiny old lady who'd had to suffer her family being killed by Cersei Lannister. She took in the Dornish, who had already suffered with three of their most beloved being murdered in King's Landing.  
&amp;nbsp;

Taking these suffering peoples under her wing, Daenerys finally crossed the Narrow Sea to reclaim her family's land. Again, we have to get guessy, but it's pretty easy to imagine. After years of living under the mad queen, King's Landing welcomed their true ruler, and the other realms welcomed a final end to the long war. The Baratheon/Lannister rule was just a blip on the radar, and the Targaryen dynasty ruled forever more, all thanks to Daenerys the liberator.  
&amp;nbsp;

Daenerys herself is lauded as a wonderful beauty, a passionate woman who crossed half the world saving anyone she could. Absurdly dedicated to making the world a better place, it was her beauty, ingenuity and passion that changed the world

Screwed up the title.)

This man barely had screentime--even in the books he didn't get that much exposure--but he's one of my favorite characters in the show. He doesn't accomplish much, isn't a political player *at all* and could have been cut from the story without changing it much. So why do I like him so much?

I think if I had to sum it up in one word, it's because he's *unwavering.* In a world with as many shades of grey as GoT, it's extremely refreshing(and I suppose a little comforting) to see someone who does not waver in the way he sees life in the slightest. Even when everything comes crashing down, he faces death with a dignity basically no other character in the series gets. It's just nice to see a character who keeps to his morals from first to last scene in spite of everything else. Like, he had nothing to gain from dying like that - he could just have let them take Arya and, you know, not die. But that's just not the way he does things, so he dies doing what he thinks is right. 

And unlike many characters in the series who die *because* of doing something right(Ned, Robb, about 75% of the cast), Syrio dies *in order to* do something right and there's something really nice in seeing a character openly stare death in the face and say ""I accept you so someone else can reject you"" instead of the usual thing where death comes as a surprise for other similarly moral characters. 

And that's why I personally don't like the ""Syrio is a faceless man"" theories despite really, *really* wishing he was still alive. I think his character is better defined as a simple man who lived and died by his sword and morals instead of some convoluted magical assassin plot. I don't know if I'm alone in this, but much as I love him I hope he's forever dead.

Cersei is literally unconnected emotionally due to her dead children with Jaime and probably unconnected to Jaime from arguments.  
......................Somehow before or during the coming of Dany's attack Jaime is already suspicious upset about the Sept Wildfire but Jaime catches Cersei with Euron or just misses&amp;suspects her in a sexual embrace with Euron and Jaime leaves her furious.

While rewatching season 3, I came to the scene when Brienne and Jaime are in the bath and Jaime tells her about when he killed the Mad King. He tells her about all the places where Aerys put wildfire caches, including the Sept of Baelor and even under the red keep. This has already foreshadowed the events of the season 6 finale and I believe it could for shadow another future event, possibly in the finale of season 7.
I think Dany will have Cersei nearly beaten, the castle will be overrun with unsullied and Dany's khalasaar. Cersei will give the word to Qyburns little birds to set off the cache under the red keep, destroying the throne rather than surrendering it. Dany shows up at the end to see what she has conquered, completely destroyed.
This would also play into Dany's vision inside the house of the undying in season 2, where she sees the throne room destroyed, with snow falling. It would also serve as a way to eliminate the dothraki from the storyline, without seeing them just freeze to death when winter comes to the south.",62,134,False,self,,,,,

3) He was the one who moved Robb's garrison from the Twin when he wanted to take Harrenhal by force (Note that this Garrison was left there in case Lord Frey would betray them).

4) When Robb had planned to encircle Gregor Clegane in the Riverlands, Edmure was the one to screw it up and let them flee.

A partial theory of GOT's end game based on Jon Snow.

When Jon was brought back, he seemed the same -- but I think he was changed in a major way. He just doesnt know how yet. He was always a Targaryen. I think he was reborn a Targaryen Dragon. (Fits with blood sacrifice/magic). 

I've read lots of comments/theories on how Jon will find out he's a Targaryen. Most focus on Bran/Reed/Benjen telling him -- and I agree. BUT, when/if it goes public, consider that people will want EVIDENCE to believe he's the true heir to the Iron Throne. Not just hearsay from family friends. 

I think that evidence will come when a dragon (possibly the one named for his father) comes to him and bonds with him in the way Dany and Drogon are bonded. And especially if he rides it  then no one could doubt. 

Jon wasn't fire resistant before -- but maybe he is now. Or maybe hes the first Ice Dragon  impervious to being turned by the WWs, which would be a powerful twist as well. 

D&amp;D have hinted Jon will be darker/harsher in the future episodes. This would be consistent with having the spirit of a dragon like Dany, i.e. the Targaryen way. 

Some related predictions:  

1) I suspect Jon and Dany will likely be married or engaged to be so in an alliance before he finds out shes his Auntee. (Tyrion really likes Jon and will reco him for the marriage they discussed). This will cause major weirdness and tension. Dany will be massively conflicted between her feeling of deserving the throne and her loyalty to Rhaegar (the crown prince). But...  

2) I dont think Jon will claim or want the Iron Throne  hed only take it if the masses wanted him to  which is a big difference between him and Dany, and why he ""should"" be King -- because he earns things, rather than feeling entitled. But I think hell always identify as a Stark from the North. 

3) I suspect Sam or someone will find evidence of R and L's shotgun wedding, proving Jon isn't a bastard after all, which would make him the undisputed heir -- and, more tension/danger for him. 

4) Look for a Rhaegar reveal next season through Time Lord Bran going to the Tourney at Harrenhal to finally confirm what went down. (Why else would they tease his father instead of just confirming it  pt 2 will in some way confirm Rhaegar as father and it wasn't a kidnapping). 

5) Jon and Dany will have a falling out at the end. Not sure if he kills her unless she goes batshit crazy (I think Cersei has that covered -- would be too much for both to go nuts). I think Dany will die fighting the others or be betrayed. GRRM said she'll be betrayed again...

6) A final note. As others have pointed out, Jon Snow may never find out who he really is (though I doubt it). GRRM said the ending would be bittersweet  that would definitely be sad. He specifically asked Ned about his mother, and if she knew about him. To do all hes done and not find out the one thing he wants to know -- that would be bittersweet indeed.

To my surprise, the theory was picked up by dozens of news outlets [around the world](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2016/06/27/when-is-the-game-of-thrones-season-7-release-date-and-what-are-t/) after I posted it on Reddit, and [Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-mystery-of-jon-snows-real-name-is-solved_us_5773b5aae4b0d1f85d47ce88) even went so far as to dub me The Theorist that was Promised, which I think is a wee bit of a stretch, but heyhyperbole makes things fun sometimes. 

The response was overwhelming, to say the least. Among the hundreds of replies in my inbox was one from a managing editor at ZergNet, who offered me a job writing articles on pop culture, gaming, and more for [Looper](http://www.looper.com/), [Nicki Swift](http://www.nickiswift.com/), and [The List](http://www.thelist.com). After pinching myself a few times to assure myself that no, this is not a dream, and yes, my Game of Thrones geekery did just land me a job, I replied back to the message with a resounding, Hell yeah! 

So here I am a couple of months later, with nearly 50 stories under my belt for them so far. Looper just launched two new series I'll be doing for them: TheoryBox-- where I get to broadcast my crazy tinfoil theories on tv shows and movies to the world, and TheoryLoop-- where I give breakdowns and explanations of popular fan theories. The first one was published today, and is an expansion on my [reddit theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4qcqbs/everything_the_marginalization_of_jaime_lannister/) about the marginalization of Jaime Lannister, and what that potentially means for Cersei in season 7.

So, thank you, /r/gameofthrones. Thanks for being a place where 3/4 of a million obsessed geeks like myself can come together and discuss, quibble, and endlessly analyze this awesome fictional world.

Odin, the Nordic god associated with healing, death, sorcery and power (unlike Greek gods they Nordic gods didn't just assign one sector to each deity) is in one legend said to have sacrificed one of his eyes so that he can attain foresight, in a very very similar way to the three eyed Raven.  Additionally, Thor while on a journey, enters a cave underneath a giant ash tree to find Odin rest on its roots.

Strong parallels exist too in the chronicles of the Vlsung clan, most similar to the Lannister family, an hunger for power, revenge and incest. The 'Cersei' character Gundrun also seeks vengeful and dramatic flair. I've before noted similarities between Circe from homer's odyssey (blonde, spiteful, affiliated with lions) going beyond the name alone. 

I of course assumed that he had drawn on legends before researching further into Nordic folklore but not this extensively. I am not discrediting the author, but rather applauding his transformation of several sometimes laughable stories into complex and wonderful plots and characters. Not only that, but drawing folklore into the modern context and leading others to learn about these fascinating tales of past cultures. I highly recommend to any other fanatics or simply ancient history fans looking into Greek and Nordic/Germanic and Swedish mythology, and would love to hear any other parallels fans have noticed in folklore.",3,1,False,self,,,,,

This just doesn't make sense to me. 

Robert Baratheon is a great warrior and King of the Seven Kingdoms. Obviously, he was a terrible father but after another rewatch it's bothering me that a person who wielded a fucking war hammer, and has every resource available to him, wouldn't have somebody teach Joffrey how to be a man. Jaime, one of the greatest knights alive, wouldn't take it upon himself to mentor his 'nephew'? They both sit there and let him become a snarling, barking chihuaha? Tommen was a kind person, but so was Rhaegar. That didn't stop Rhaegar from learning how to be a boss. I know Cersei had the big hand in raising the children but she surely sees the importance of being a man who is a talented killer. Look at her brother/lover.

Jon Arryn, the man who raised two of the greatest warriors of their era, really let his son breast feed for that long?? I don't understand this. Every other kingdom has a capable Lords or Ladies who knows how to handle himself in a fight. Just can't see how the first Non-Targaryen King and his Hand would start the dynasty off like that. I mean, in that time period it was all about tournaments, fighting, jousting, kicking ass and taking names. Joffrey, as crowned prince, surely would've been expected to compete in tournaments  at some point.

I've seen people say that The Night King and The Night's King are different people, but have we seen this actually stated anywhere?

I'd always thought the show just changed it because The Night King sounded better (similar to how the term ""The Others"" is not really used in the show).

Did I miss when this was alluded to or stated? Or is that idea based off the Leaf flashback showing the creation of the first White Walker? I always have assumed that the first White Walker was not The Night('s) King, but rather the current big bad is the same man who deserted the Night's Watch and became the Night's King; that he had joined the already existing White Walkers through his relationship with a White Walker woman.

I know a computer game with this idea would be hit and miss, but I really like the idea of alternate universes, and it would be really cool to see some different outcomes.

Or maybe you can set the first event and the fallout is generated? 

Start at Ned's execution: first event: Ned twists just right to get away, disappears into the crowd. Yay!
Joffery spots Arya in the crowd. ""Her! Bring her up here!"" Ned starts to scream ""Nooo-"" but is dragged away by Littlefinger. The Hound, giving zero fucks, kills Joffery before he can order Aryas beheading.

That actually gives us some info, inferences can be made.

So let's make them.

The first day of summer is 

Jun 21st 2017

The last day is September 4th 2017.

S6 finished filming December 17th 2015 and aired April 24th 2016 130 days allowed of post production

Benioff said at Sdcc they finish shooting in February.

For this purpose let's assume feb 14th. Halfway in the month. Last day is feb 28th 2017.

So 130 days of post production from February 14th is June 24th 2017.

June 25th 2017 is the nearest Sunday. 

It's possible that 7 episodes needs less post time. But they are going to be doing more ambitious set pieces that may need more time for vfx. It seems to me to balance out.

This seems to be a solid estimate for airing of S7. Hope you enjoyed.

Sansa is lady of Winterfell, Wardeness of the North (assuming that title still matters if there is a King in the North). She is pretty important in Westeros, especially now that the Starks have reclaimed Winterfell. She has had absolutely terrible luck wth her marriages so far and frankly I think it would be difficult for her to find an appropriate spouse in Westeros for a few reasons. For one, there aren't too many high born lords left at this point. But even aside from that, I think she is going to be considered bad luck or tainted or ""used"" because of her past. It sucks but the reality is that there probably aren't a lot of men of noble birth jumping at the chance to marry Ramsay Snow's (SNOW I SAY!) widow. 

And you know, I think Sansa probably doesn't feel too great about any of them either. 

Will Sansa die a spinster? No. Winterfell needs more heirs. (Note: I am eliminating the idea of Bran being Lord of Winterfell for the purpose of this theory.) 

So. Who will Sansa marry? In ADWD Jon arranged a marriage between a Karstark girl and one of the Thenns in order to promote peace between Westeros and the free folk. I know you're all shipping Tormund and Brienne but it makes complete sense for Sansa to marry a wildling and, going a step further, it makes sense for that wildling to be Tormund. Jon trusts Tormund a great deal, and Tormund is an important person to the free folk. Cersei and Robert joked that their marriage kept the realm together, but Sansa/Tormund would keep two realms together. 

I like it and I'm shipping it. What do you think? ",30,3,False,self,,,,,

This is a quote of his from the show. If this number is accurate and not just him bragging, and all 99 boys were given to the Night King then Craster is responsible for 99 White Walkers being created. He's one of the largest contributors to the upcoming Long Night. No wonder the WWs spared him.

I feel her lesson with the Faceless Men was to teach her that she could ALWAYS be No One by being just herself Arya Stark and only if she was HONEST to herself! By the end Arya, who was adept at changing 'her face'/identity without the magic but was useless for the Faceless men to use properly as a member assassin because she was too tied to Arya the underlying FACE. Arya could perform the Faceless magic using a No One's 'face' identity by self denial. I think they respect her inherent 'faceless' talents and let her go to live and be a free agent doing the Red god/God of Death's work on her own until she gives her life over. Arya also helped weed out a bad seed waif.

If Jon and Dany are eventually going to meet, and I think it's pretty safe to assume that they will at some point, then there's a decent chance Tyrion and Sansa will also be seeing each other again.

At least for now I don't see Jon or Sansa leaving the North or each other after being away from family for so long. So the four of them may all meet together. 

So that got me wondering about the reunion between Tyrion and Sansa. The two of them were still married the last time they saw each other, I wonder if their marriage would still be valid/recognized. Considering how Ramsey treated Sansa, she might have much more appreciation for Tyrion now that she knows he could've treated her just as badly but instead chose to do his best to respect and protect her. She may not have wanted to marry him initially, but she was still fairly naive at that point and placed much more value on things like Loras being ""gallant"". New Sansa might not think of being married to Tyrion as such a bad thing. Depending on when a reunion happens Jaime and Cersei might already be dead, and without Tywin to stop it that would make Tyrion Lord of Casterly Rock along with being Hand of the Queen. 

Maybe the marriage that will unite the North, the rest of Westeros and Dany's invading army isn't between Jon and Dany but the couple that is already married, Tyrion and Sansa. ",6,0,False,self,,,,,

It's covered more in the books but is mentioned slightly on the show that Robb (being absolute dead on and cementing his career as a psychic) names Jon as his heir as he believes all his other siblings either dead, lost or firmly in the hands of the Lannisters. He gives the task of delivering the official letter to Maege Mormont (and possibly someone else in the books I forget). Maege and the letter are never heard from again.
Lyanna Mormont firstly sends Stannis the letter stating that Bear Island will not kneel to any king other than that named Stark, and then proclaims Jon just that in the Season Six finale. Wouldn't it be rather jolly if Maege had somehow got the message upto Lyanna, and Lyanna genuinely knows that Jon is the true heir when she proclaims him King in the North.

I reasoned that **she's just simply cruel**, not mad. This draws obvious parallels to **Maegor the Cruel**, and that got me thinking of how big of a parallel that really is. I mean, Maegor literally waged war with the Faith Militant and burned down the Sept of Remembrance with dragonfire, killing everyone inside. From his awoiaf entry:


&gt;He mounted Balerion and without a warning flew over the Sept of Remembrance on Rhaenys's Hill, where he unleashed the Black Dread's flames, which consumed the Sept and all within in dragon flame. Those who tried to flee were slain by archers Maegor had placed around the hill. The screams of burning and dying men were said to echo in the streets of King's Landing and for it was claimed for seven days a pall hung over the city.


He was Cersei before Cersei was Cersei lol. So there is more in common there than just cruelty in general. So I thought, **what if there could be even more in common**, specifically in regards to where Cersei's plot might be going based on what we know about both her plot so far and how Maegor the Cruel's plot ended up. And that is, **suicide**. Again, from awoiaf:


&gt;During the hour of the wolf, those few who remained left the throne room leaving Maegor alone to brood. He was found dead seated on the Iron Throne the next morning, his robes covered in blood, his wrists slashed. Some say he had been killed by a knight of his own Kingsguard who could no longer abide his tyranny, some say he had been killed by a builder that escaped the slaughter and desired revenge, and some whispered that Maegor had been killed by the throne itself.[13] Perhaps the most likely explaination however is that Maegor killed himself by opening his wrists on the blades of the Iron Throne.


So, I will admit that Maegor's death isn't 100% confirmed as being suicide, but all things considered it does indeed seem to be **the most likely explanation**, at least according to Occam's Razor (ha ha). The circumstances prior to this seem to have amounted to much the same as the circumstances around Cersei are shaping up to be. **Jaime did not seem to be pleased** with what he saw when he returned to King's Landing in the season 6 finale. **Cersei has very few supporters left** and one who was her closest ally seems to be imminently about to turn on her. The walls are closing in around her, and when they do, she will not have enough allies to turn to in order to make it through, **and she will *know* that fact**, just like Maegor:


&gt;When Rhaena Targaryen learned of her brother's claim she managed to escape her forced marriage to Maegor. Stealing away in the night while her husband slept, she mounted on her dragon Dreamfyre and managed to smuggle the blade Blackfyre with her. Two of Maegors Kingsguard also abandoned him. These series of betrayals and the loss of his mothers guidance left Maegor a broken man. He called his banners but few answered and those who did were not enough to defeat his many foes.


Also note the loss of his mother's guidance (who had passed away previously), which can be compared to **Cersei's own loss of the guidance of Tywin**. Though it left her less broken than unrestrained, perhaps.


But what about **Maggy the Frog's prophecy**, you ask? Well, it doesn't actually say anything specifically about Cersei's death in the show, just about her getting **""cast down""** and having everything she held dear taken **by a younger, more beautiful queen**, which doesn't necessarily have to be interpreted as fatal to her. And in the books it attributes her death specifically to the **""valonqar""**, which would be difficult to reconcile with suicide despite the many theories on who the valonqar really is. **But...** in the case of the show, if you accept that it doesn't speak to her death at all, then anything in that regard is on the table, and if you (and Cersei) interpret it fatally and interpret the younger, more beautiful queen as Daenerys, then **Cersei offing herself becomes a sort of last act of defiance to the prophecy**. And in any case, in the books, it would be no stretch at all to attribute it as such. **Everything else in it has already come true**, her children have died, her deposition is imminent, **why wait for the final strand to be woven**? Why not just end it now, and why not alone and on the throne? The one thing she always wanted, that she finally got, but knew it would soon be wrenched from her grasp. I think *she* would think it'd be a fitting means for her own end, given the circumstances.


Though it is difficult to say for sure if she will even burn down the Sept of Baelor or assume regency in the books, so I admit that last part is on shaky ground. But if the situation does turn out the same way or at least in a similar way in the books as it did in the show, I believe suicide as a last act of defiance still **fits right in line with Cersei's character**, regardless of the other circumstances. **We know she is capable of contemplating suicide**, or at least assisted suicide, because of her actions during the siege of King's Landing and the **Battle of Blackwater Bay**. There was her whole explanation to Sansa about Ilyn Payne's true reason for being there, for granting them quick and merciful deaths should the city be taken, herself included. And in the scene in the throne room with Tommen, it is not clear if she had enough poison for the both of them and had intended to take some herself after she made Tommen drink a fatal dose, or if she was going to just go see Ilyn Payne afterwards, but in either case, **she definitely was resigned to both assisting in a (forced) suicide and killing herself, either on her own or with assistance**. If the walls were really closing in around her, and her prophecized, violent death seemed imminent, I think she would definitely rather commit suicide instead.

-----

**tl;dr:** Cersei will commit suicide because she has more in common with Maegor the Cruel than Aerys the Mad, and Maegor (evidently) committed suicide when all of his supporters abandoned him and his entire life and reign crumbled around him (likely where Cersei is heading, especially in regards to Jaime), *and* because it will be her last act of defiance against the world, and Maggy the Frog's prophecy about her violent death in particular. We know she is capable of resigning herself to suicide, because she did as such in the siege of King's Landing during the Battle of the Blackwater.

Two scenes I found formed a very interesting contrast.

S2E1: Cersei's confrontation with Littlefinger after he taunts her about her incest

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKTc8Chvw5k

and

S6E5: Sansa's confrontation with Littlefinger after the whole Bolton-rape-marriage awkardness.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qA0ye5Xh-cI

The two womens' handling of Baelish forms a nice foil in terms of their views on power.

Cersei asserts her control over the situation directly. She shows her guards willingness and ability to kill Baelish for her. She tells him that she's powerful because she can have him killed. Even her line ""Power is power."" asserts that she believes her power comes from the fact that she is naturally powerful. But most of all, Cersei *talks.* She doesn't let Baelish open his mouth, she does all the talking. By Baelish's standards, that knowledge is power, Cersei is the one imparting all of the ""knowledge"" (about the nature of power, or more accurately about Cersei's character) in the conversation.

Sansa, on the other hand, forces Baelish to do all of the talking. Rather than tell Baelish she could have him killed, she forces Baelish to tell *her* that she could have him killed. She makes him dig himself deeper and deeper as the conversation continues, all with few direct accusations and even fewer threats.

And in the end, while Baelish slithers out of both scenarios intact, the power dynamic is completely different. While Cersei makes it clear, since she's the only one talking, that she is letting Baelish live because she needs him, Sansa leaves Baelish seeming genuinely thankful to be given his life because she forces him to say that she has the power to take it.

And the end result is that Littlefinger took revenge on Cersei (That scene is when he really started throwing wrenches into Lannister gears, then of course he kills her kid) because he viewed their exchange as blunt intimidation, whereas he's still willing to come to Sansa's aid.

It's a good pair of scenes.

He tells her that even a castle even as strong Harrenhal was usless against Aegon's dragons. 

This led me to look up stories on some of the great castles of Westeros and how they sized up against dragons. What I found was a interesting story about the Vale of Arryn who's castle is very different than the others of Westeros and probably my favorite. I often wonder where the inspiration came from. To summarize, 

""The Eyrie is physically the smallest of the great castles of the Seven Kingdoms, and can hold a garrison of only five hundred men. It has never fallen to a conventional army, and it is said that a dozen major assaults were made against it during the Age of Heroes, but all in vain. Similar to Harrenhal, however, it did prove vulnerable to dragons during the War of Conquest, but unlike Harrenhal, the Eyrie was not burned with dragonfire.""

Interesting. Looking back on the conversation between Arya and Tywin, Arya responds to Tywin's story of dragons, by saying:

""It wasn't just Aegon riding his dragon, it was Rhaenys and Visenya, too... Rhaenys rode Meraxes, Visenya rode Vhagar... Visenya Targaryen was a great warrior. She had a Valyrian steel sword she called 'Dark Sister'.""

Tywin then acknowledges that Visenya is a hero of hers and asks Arya ""Aren't most girls more interested in the pretty maidens from the songs? Jonquil, with flowers in her hair? ""

Naturally, Arya tells him ""Most girls are idiots."" 

Tywin laughs and says ""You remind me of my daughter.""

***Hold up... Arya reminds him of Cersei? Forshadowing? I hope not, but let's skip this for now and go back to Visenya Targaryen***

Visenya was the sister and wife of Aegon the Conqueror. She was skilled in battle and fierce, Visenya was somewhat stand-offish in matters of the heart. She is the more likely than her sister to garb herself as a warrior, and when so garbed, she would wield the Valyrian steel sword Dark Sister, whose slender blade is designed for a woman's hand.

After Aegon had burned Harrenhal by simply flying his dragon Balerion over the walls, the implication was obvious. The inhabitants offered no battle. 

Just like Tywin said, dragons were the game changer.

After the Field of Fire (the only time all three dragons were realesed together) Visenya was charged with subduing the Vale while Rhaenys was charged with conquering Dorne. House Arryn sent an army to the Bloody Gate but Visenya Targaryen simply flew her dragon Vhagar up over the walls and landed in the courtyard, as a display of supremacy. Ronnel Arryn, the current King of the Vale and only a boy, was so excited to see the dragon that he rushed out into the courtyard to greet Visenya. Rather than pointlessly resist the power of the Targaryen dragons, his mother and Queen Regent, Sharra, surrendered after Ronnel stated he wanted a ride on the dragon, which Visenya granted him.

***So wait... the Eyrie was spared destruction because a young Ronnel Arryn wanted a dragon ride!?!? Hilarious, what a great plot line! Tin foil for sure, but this totally reminds me of something Sweet Robin would do. The kid gets so hysterically excited that running off to see a real life dragon totally fits his character.***

To bring a little closure to the story of Visenya,
During the Faith Militant uprising Aenys abandoned the city with his family and fled to the safety of Dragonstone, where Visenya Targaryen counseled him to bring fire and blood to the Starry Sept in Oldtown and Sept of Remembrance in King's Landing. Aenys though incapable of making a firm decision instead fell ill and chose not to heed her counsel and the Sept wasn't destroyed.  

This last part of the story makes Tywin's line to Arya  that she reminds him of his daughter, chilling. We know Cersei is a crazy person. She burned down a sept just like Visenya wanted. Is it possible we see Arya turn to the dark side? Will she start killing innocent people? It's interesting to see how the characteristics of these three women interweave.
***Its also likely this quote from Tywin means nothing more than a nod to Arya's quick wit.***

- I hope you enjoyed my rambling, and sorry it's not so neatly executed. Most of the information comes from Imdb and GoT Wiki... I really enjoyed all the tie ins between Tywin and Arya's conversation and was dissapointed that I seemed to miss so much of it the first time watching. I'm glad I stumbled upon more of Visenya and history of the Eyrie. What a great story.

They are fully castrated, meaning their penis and their testicles are cut, before being burned at the altar of the Lady of Spears. They begin their ruthless training at five years old, and roughly one third of the boys survive their training and become Unsullied.  

Starting at five years old, they train every day, from dusk till dawn. Their training is designed not only to teach them how to fight, but to strip them of all sense of individuality, empathy, and self-worth. Slaves that fail any aspect of their training are killed.

As one of the slaves tells Dany in *A Storm of Swords*:

&gt; They are chosen young, for size and speed and strength, the slave told her. They begin their training at five. Every day they train from dawn to dusk, until they have mastered the shortsword, the shield, and the three spears. The training is most rigorous, Your Grace. Only one boy in three survives it. This is well known. Among the Unsullied it is said that on the day they win their spiked cap, the worst is done with, for no duty that will ever fall to them could be as hard as their training.

The boys are given a spiked cap when their training is complete, signalling that they are now Unsullied. They're also almost incapable of feeling physical pain, due to a strict regiment of something called ""the wine of courage"".

&gt; Kraznys turned back to Dany. They feel no pain, you see.

&gt; How can that be? she demanded through the scribe.

&gt; The wine of courage, was the answer he gave her. It is no true wine at all, but made from deadly nightshade, bloodfly larva, black lotus root, and many secret things. They drink it with every meal from the day they are cut, and with each passing year feel less and less. It makes them fearless in battle. Nor can they be tortured. 

The Unsullied are also completely void of any sense of identity, as a result of their training. They don't even have names. 

&gt; His girl conveyed the essence of his speech, more politely. There are other ways to tempt men, besides the flesh, Arstan Whitebeard objected, when she was done.

&gt; Men, yes, but not Unsullied. Plunder interests them no more than rape. They own nothing but their weapons. We do not even permit them names.

&gt; No names? Dany frowned at the little scribe. Can that be what the Good Master said? They have no names?

&gt; It is so, Your Grace.

&gt;Kraznys stopped in front of a Ghiscari who might have been his taller fitter brother, and flicked his lash at a small bronze disk on the swordbelt at his feet. There is his name. Ask the whore of Westeros whether she can read Ghiscari glyphs. When Dany admitted that she could not, the slaver turned to the Unsullied. What is your name? he demanded.

&gt; This ones name is Red Flea, your worship.

&gt; The girl repeated their exchange in the Common Tongue.

&gt; And yesterday, what was it?

&gt; Black Rat, your worship.

&gt; The day before?

&gt; Brown Flea, your worship.

&gt; Before that?

&gt; This one does not recall, your worship. Blue Toad, perhaps. Or Blue Worm.

&gt; Tell her all their names are such, Kraznys commanded the girl. It reminds them that by themselves they are vermin. The name disks are thrown in an empty cask at dutys end, and each dawn plucked up again at random.

&gt; More madness, said Arstan, when he heard. How can any man possibly remember a new name every day?

&gt; Those who cannot are killed in training, along with those who cannot run all day in full pack, scale a mountain in the black of night, walk across a bed of coals, or slay an infant.

There's quite a lot of cruelty involved in the training of Unsullied. Including, but not limited to, killing children and animals.

&gt; Whose infants do they slay?

&gt; To win his spiked cap, an Unsullied must go to the slave marts with a silver mark, find some wailing newborn, and kill it before its mothers eyes. In this way, we make certain that there is no weakness left in them.

&gt; She was feeling faint. The heat, she tried to tell herself. You take a babe from its mothers arms, kill it as she watches, and pay for her pain with a silver coin?

&gt; When the translation was made for him, Kraznys mo Nakloz laughed aloud. What a soft mewling fool this one is. Tell the whore of Westeros that the mark is for the childs owner, not the mother. The Unsullied are not permitted to steal. He tapped his whip against his leg. 

&gt; Tell her that few ever fail that test. The dogs are harder for them, it must be said. We give each boy a puppy on the day that he is cut. At the end of the first year, he is required to strangle it. Any who cannot are killed, and fed to the surviving dogs. It makes for a good strong lesson, we find.

Shireen had king's blood in her as a child of Stannis Baratheon - similar to Gendry and King Robert. Stannis may not have been the chosen one as predicted by Melisandre, but he was the true king as the closest living relative to the former king, Robert Baratheon.  Further proof of Stannis' king's blood can be found in the fact that Melisandre used Stannis to give birth to the shadow demon that killed Renly. 

The true king's blood was used to resurrect Jon Snow, the Lord of Light's chosen one.  As awful as her death was, she was not sacrificed in vain. ",13,3,False,self,,,,,

And also, somebody mentioned that they wished Jon could have joined Robb on his campaign, but if Jon broke his NW oath to do that, Robb would have been forced to execute him for desertion, whether or not he wanted to.

Anyway, my question is, if Robb had been forced to execute Catelyn/Jon himself, would that have been considered kinslaying, or just dispensing justice, or both (kinslaying AND justice)?

What about if he had somebody else do the actual execution/s for him? (But I think that anything done in Robb's name and with his permission might still make the kinslaying/justice his responsibility.)

(I put ""killed"" instead of ""executed"" in the title to make it as spoiler-free as possible.)

Also, if you think that Westerosi people/Robb's bannermen won't consider one or both of those to be kinslaying, what about the old/new gods in the series?

Whatever the people/bannermen think is justified, I really think that the old/new gods in that world would still see those acts as kinslaying, since they've probably observed people doing justified/unjustified kinslaying for thousands of years.",19,9,False,self,,,,,

I have a much more interesting but farfetched idea on how things will play out.


It starts with Daenerys taking the throne from Cersei. Little finger has been scheming to get on the throne for years and wants Sansa by his side. There was a recent thread saying how Sansa will betray Jon but in this situation she uses Jon. As Jon, like Ned could care less about the Iron throne and is content with being the warden of the north he wouldnt bother challenging the crown but Little finger is not satisfied and wants to be king. With Jons military expertise and the backing of the north Little finger now has an army. He gets Sansa to convince Jon to start a rebellion (similar to Roberts Rebellion) and he will go to war with Daenerys (Ice &amp; Fire come together now). In the end, Little Finger is on the throne with Sansa by his side while Jon rules the north. I understand this wont happen but I have to say I like the thought of it.

When Tyrion accuses Tywin of being ungrateful for his key role in defending King's Landing from Stannis's onslaught until the Lannister/Tyrell reinforcements arrived, Tywin scoffs, noting that he didn't demand a ""garland of roses"" every time he ""suffered a wound on the battlefield."" This of course implies that Tywin participated in frontline combat in his younger years. In early S4, Tyrion attempts to reassure Jaime in the aftermath of his maiming by reminding him that their father hadn't wielded a sword in years, yet was arguably the single most powerful man in the Seven Kingdoms at that time.

However, Tywin is much better-known for his acumen in political and (to a lesser extent) military strategy than he is for his combat skills. He began his service as Hand to King Aerys from a very young agesometime in his twenties, if I remember correctly. We know that he oversaw the complete destruction of Western houses who rose up against Lannister rule prior to becoming Hand, but again, this was an area where both the effectiveness and the ruthlessness of his *tactics* are remembered more than anything else.

On the other hand, Tywin does appear to be in very impressive physical fitness for a man his age, and one has to figure that Jaime inherited at least some level of purely *natural* talent that allowed him to become a veritable prodigy when he came to learn from some of the greatest knights in Westeros.

I want to contribute with one of them I never heard mentioned before, which has clear similarities with the events that are described in ""The Rains of Castamere"". 

In Florence (~1500) the Medici were the richest and the leading family of the Tuskany. There was a large list of enemies they had - amongst them there was the Pazzi family. This also was a very rich family in Florence and they wanted to end the dominance of the Medici (""and who are you that I must bow so low""). And so they tried to kill the leaders of the Medici family - but did not succeed since Lorenzo, head of the Medici family, survived the attack. As a consequence, all involved members of the Pazzi family where killed, the rest exiled, the name ""Pazzi"" disappeard (people whose family name was Pazzi had to change their names - even if they had no connection to the conspirancy family) and the house sigil of the Pazzi family was removed from all the buildings where it appeard. The traitors where publicly hanged in the piazza della signoria, just like Tywin did with the Reynes (Leonardo da Vinci actually draw one of the hung men when he saw him). As a consequence of these events no one questioned Lorenzos authority anymore. 

It is also interesting that the Pazzi did chose the celebrations to Easter Sunday (the most important day in christianity) in the cathedral of Florence to attack their enemies, just like Cersei did on the Festival of the Mother in the Sept of Baelor. 

Finally, some of you might remember this whole story, since it was potrayed in ""Assassins Creed II"".

Explanation: In a flashback to Cersei's childhood, she visited a fortune teller and the fortune teller told her that she will have 3 children, will become queen, and in the book an extra fortune was that she will be strangled to death by her little brother or ""Valonqar"". Keep the last one in mind. Now, recently in the season Arya has spoken with melisandre and melisandre told her that she sees brown eyes, blue eyes, and green eyes inside of her soul. Eyes that Arya will shut forever. Meryn Trant has brown eyes that Arya stabbed out. The Waif had blue eyes and Arya killed her. Cersei has green eyes, but if the fortune teller told cersei brother is going to kill her, how will Arya kill her? Well my guess is that she kills her brother and takes his face to kill her. Which brother is going to kill her? Well, in the finale of season 6, the high sparrow quotes ""The Warrior punishes those who believe themselves beyond the reach of justice."" Cersei believes she is above justice and Someone who's a warrior will kill her. Jaime is the only one that fits this profile. He is a warrior of the kings army and he is also Cersei's brother. Then there's the ""Jaime is Cersei's twin"" thing so how could one be older than the other? Well, Jaime could have been born after Cersei, making him a little brother. So, to conclude, I believe that Jaime Lannister will die somehow, Arya will take the face of Jaime Lannister to then kill Cersei, the mad queen. Thus giving the title Queen Slayer to Jaime and Arya will avenge her fathers death that was carried out by the former king Joffery Baratheon.",26,19,False,self,,,,,

Bran is meant to become the next three eyed raven but we don't really have a reason of why. 

From what I am aware of the Children of the Forest created the WW to defend them from humans and at some point built the wall to protect against the WW. So why did the wall get built? Why are the WW building an army? 

So I just wanted to ramble off some story arc of the WW. 

The Children created the WW to protect from humanity. At some point the WW figured out how to raise the dead. To anyone this seems crazy and probably evil. So the children worked with the humans to create the wall in fear of the WW spreading. They wanted to contain the evil they had created. of course the WW aren't evil but were rejected and became evil. GRMM likes to really through the idea of villian and hero around, so it's a decent conclusion to think the WW will end up being good. So why would they be building an army? What if there is a reason they are building an army besides to attack the humans. What if they are either preparing for something or trying to run from something. We have not seen them try to cross the wall so I am assuming they are preparing for something. 

Over all this time what has changed? Why would they be more active now then ever. Maybe they feel like humanity is gearing up to attack them. Maybe that's why they attacked hardhome. They were being given a gift and that was taken away. What if that caused them to believe humans were rising against them. Wildings heading south, bran reaching the third eye raven. Things aren't looking good for the WW. The other thing that has changed, three dragons are awakened and headed towards westeros. What if the WW's know?  Dragons are really the only threat to them. So what if they wanting to defend themselves against what they feel is an invasion. What if there is an ice dragon in the Wall and they are hoping to unleash it and defend themselves.

I put off watching GOT for so long because everyone talked about the rape scenes and I felt uncomfortable with that. But recently my Dad watched it and wouldn't stop talking about how good it was, so I had to watch it and I was immediately hooked!
Unfortunately most of the show had been spoiled for me. I was on tumblr during the Red Wedding, Joffrey's death, Ygritte'a death, and Jon's death and saw a multitude of gifs and reactions to that. However, the biggest shock for me was Ned dying so early- I knew he died, but for some reason I just assumed he'd die at the Red Wedding.
I feel like every character still alive is my favorite. I love Jon of course. And Sansa and Arya. Sam and Gilly. Brienne and Podrick. DANY OF COURSE and Jorah, poor Jorah.

I agree that the final event of the series seems to be building towards an epic battle between the living and the dead. However, at least as of now, things seem to massively favor the living.

Assuming that at least one of Dany's dragons survive, which is probably a given, the wight army of the walkers is as good as useless. If all 3 of them happen to be alive for the battle, no matter how many wights the Others manage to throw out, they will be disposed by dragonfire incredibly easily. In the books, the Others' answer to this might turn out to be Ice Dragons, but I don't see that happening in the show, since IIRC they've not once been mentioned and it would feel pretty forced to just pull them out of nowhere.

Now, as for the Others themselves. For show only, we already have 3 people who have successfully killed a White Walker: Sam, Jon and Meera. White Walkers aren't really portrayed as absolute badass fighters, their main advantage is the fact that their ice blades seem to shatter regular steel weapons.  
 There are however quite a few valyrian steel swords at the disposal of living. There's Longclaw at the hands of Jon, who is very much capable of taking on a walker one on one. There's Oathkeeper in the hands of Brienne, who I reckon is even more qualified for walker slaying duties than Jon is. It's possible that Meera is currently in possession of Dark Sister, although that's still merely speculation. Cersei also probably has Widow's Wail, so once Dany takes care of her, that's another one added to the list. And Sam is running around with Heartsbane, which I'm sure he'd gladly gift to a capable warrior to use should the time come. Unless I'm forgetting something, that is atleast 4 valyrian steel swords confirmed, 5 if Dark Sister is truly with Meera. AFAIK there should also be a bunch of obsidian in Dragonstone. This doesn't even take into consideration the popular theory that while at the citadel, Sam discovers the secret to creating valyrian steel weapons and the living starting to mass produce them. 

The actual amount of White Walkers in the show still seems to be unconfirmed. There were 4 of them at hardhome, but during the scene in season 4(?) where we saw a baby being turned into a white walker, there seemed to be a lot more of them standing around the ceremonial area. It's also unknown whether dragonfire affects them or not, same goes for wildfire. Either way, the odds seem stacked against their favor, even if there's like 20 of them, their army will probably be disposed in a matter of minutes, and if the dragonfire doesn't destroy them, they are left against the full forces of the living with plenty of dragonglass and valyrian steel opposing them. 

So what can the Others play at? One opportunity is them waiting and hoping for the living to fight amongst themselves, hopefully kill the dragons or at least a few of them. And then strike when the army of the living is divided and weak. However, they can't possibly rely on that. Given the insane numbers and strength of Dany's army at the end of season 6, she should have no problem overthrowing Cersei at King's Landing, and I doubt Jon would rally the north against her, which doesn't really leave anyone who would or could do it. So the living should logically be under solid rule of Dany and her dragons, and I'm sure she'll gladly help Jon in the battle against the undead. 

Another possibility is Bran turning to the side of the Others / The Night King somehow manipulating him. Bran is clearly incredibly powerful, but doesn't really have much of an idea what he's doing. A lot of people have theorised the 3 dragon riders to be Dany, Jon and Bran, with Bran warging into a dragon, seemingly foreshadowed by the Three-Eyed Raven telling him that he will never walk again, but he will fly.  
So if Bran were to take control of one of the dragons and turn it on the living, he could cause a lot of damage before someone could feasibly stop him by killing the dragon. This honestly seems like the only feasible option the Others have left, someone on the inside destroying a large amount of the living forces.

What are your thoughts? What exactly are the Others planning in order to stand a chance against a united Westeros under Targaryen rule with 3 dragons opposing them and plenty of Valyrian steel / Obsidian to go around?

TL;DR: The Others seem massively outscaled by the resources of the living, which includes potentially 3 dragons and atleast 4 Valyrian steel swords + Obsidian. What's their game?

What could it be?

Could Daenerys be the one finally bringing ""the storm"" with her dragons? The hell is made of good intentions after all: 
Bran is crossing the wall while marked by the Nights King without even questioning himself if this act will have consequences;
Jon was brought  back to life by a priestess commited to the practice of blood sacrifice; she believed she burnt Shireen to give the victory to Stannis, but what if Shireen was the price paid for Jon Snow? Jon, after a small period of doubt, is now willing to fight and lead thousands of men into battle and , possibily, their deaths and 
Daenery is also on her way to Westeros, confident she can control her dragons and huge army to a certain extent. ( I could also point out that both her dragons and her Dothraki army were gained through blood and fire magic). It is almost sure that Dany cannot control 3 dragons at once..

If the white walkers can reanimate horses and ride them, they can do the same with dragons...(edit: or claim it as theirs somehow)

Magic is not reliable and did not help the Children of the Forest; we now know the white walkers were born by magical means , during a war, and could not be controlled in the end, causing more harm than expected. We have two characters ( Bran and Daenerys) bringing magic into the world again, also on wartime, both confident it can be controlled...

In short: I believe the twist is that the ""good guys"" (Bran, Daenerys and Jon) will be the ones that inadvertently will make possible for the conflict to be establish. I believe the so called "" Big Other"" just comes when Azor Ahai appears, and not the other way around. The sacrifice the three of them will have to offer is to give up Magic entirely.

Okay, so, the Ghost of High Heart, the old, stooped woman the Brotherhood Without Banners exchanges songs for prophecies with. Amidst her string of VERY ACCURATE prophecies (which include lines about Catelyn Stark's death, Stannis killing Renly, Sansa unwittingly helping in Joffrey's murder, and so on) was the following: 

""I dreamt of a man without a face, waiting on a bridge that swayed and swung. On his shoulder perched a drowned crow with seaweed hanging from his wings.""

For speculation's sake, let's assume the woman is speaking of Balon Greyjoy's death. Now, the books haven't named Balon's killer, but it's how the show introduce Euron. If I'm understanding the prophecy correctly, the Ghost of High Heart is suggesting Euron is a Faceless Man. 

So, here are my thoughts: 

1. Euron is a Faceless Man, and he is one of many throughout Westeros. The Faceless Men have been playing the game of thrones all along, and they hope to win. That's all I've got. 

2. Euron is a rogue Faceless Man, and their interest in Arya is ultimately rooted in them wanting her to kill him.

Drogo hurt too, Luwin was rough, and I didn't want to see Marg go this past season, but other than that I haven't had a real gut punch moment at all. Personally, Catelyn and Robb were well outside that range.

For me, as long as Arya, Bran, Tyrion, Olenna, Jaime, Cersei (one of my favorite sympathetic monsters ever), Varys, Jon, and LF (just too much fun) are still kicking, I can deal with anyone else dying. I just know that I'm going to see one of them eventually though

Cersei - Blows up the damn Sept, kills her husband... etc etc.

Catelyn - imprisons Tyrion partially causing the WOTFK, slits the Frey's wife's throat, and it's less of an issue but hates Jon because he exists.

Dany - (it counts I swear) massacres and crucifies the Masters, plans to kill more people.

Mothers are always categorized as the caretaker and are a symbol of forgiveness, yet they seem to be the least forgiving characters in the show.

**EDIT #2** I think my argument has been misconstrued a bit, because I was vague so it's my fault.

Jaqen is smiling as he watches Arya leave at the end of No One. It doesn't make sense for a Faceless Man to be happy to watch someone leave with all their secrets and abilities, unless it serves a purpose. There have been multiple theories connecting the House of Black and White with the Iron Bank, which currently has loaned out millions to the Iron Throne, which is currently being ruled by Cersei...who just happens to be at the top of Arya's list, and Jaqen has heard her repeating her list many times before. Everyone knows what kind of person Cersei is, and the bank must be well aware that she will most likely refuse to pay the debts, so it would be in their best interest if she were removed and someone more reasonable rose to power, allowing them to begin collecting their debts.

TL;DR
Arya was allowed to leave because the Iron Bank paid the Faceless Men to kill Cersei, and Jaqen knows she is on Arya's list.",34,56,False,self,,,,,

I have a ton of respect for her ability to survive in Kings Landing and later Winterfell, and for what she was able to do in the Vale, but this season I don't think she's done anything admirable at all. She essentially sent Jon and an army of northmen to what she had to think would likely be their deaths-including soldiers that she implicitly took under Stark protection when treating with Lyanna Mormont. As the lone remaining trueborn Stark, she could have inspired the loyalty of the other Northern houses, or spoken for herself in the wake of the battle. Jon all but stepped aside and told her to rule. But instead she took the back seat each time and then sulked when the people chose Jon. 

My opinion on her overall character is still very much in flux based on what ends up happening with the Littlefinger situation. If that look between them during Jon's coronation was one of extreme apprehension and she leverages her power (the knowledge of what LF did in the Vale, what appears to be his blinding love for her) to dispose of him and fight for what's good, then my impression of even what happened in season 6 would change drastically in her favor. If, instead, it was her deciding to side with Littlefinger to claim what she thinks should be hers, then she would become one of the show's worst villains imo

**At 30:** Ned asks if Renly is home, he really wants to hear yes. Right after you can see the worried look Littlefinger gives to Varys. Ned should have kind of been able to tell there was something wrong from this reaction. 

**At 39:** Littlefinger is like ""hehe its probably nothing Ned, the kid is just scared, ran off with his boyfriend."" His left eyebrow goes like ""right Ned? its nothing, everything is fine""

**From 42:** Varys is subtly trying to test Ned one last time to see if he understands that ""things are not going to go well man, come on Ned! COME ON!"" He is like ""dude I wonder why they galloped in haste to south, what about you Ned?"" He finishes it with smile and stare and a deep breath. He is hoping maybe Ned figures something is off.

**And at last at 51:** Littlefinger's sigh of relief, he is thinking ""okay its over, he listened to it all but now he is looking at me, so he is still the same dumb Ned that trusted me last night, so lets go Ned, all right?""

Varys didnt try hard, maybe he could have somehow told Ned last night? But then Cersei and LittleFinger would have figured it out? But I think its because he didnt really like Ned anyways, he likes smart people and Ned is not one.

What do you guys think? Is this something they intentionally put in? To show that although they are both backing Cersei and Joffrey, Varys still wants to see different results. He doesnt want to see LittleFinger succeed with his plans.

(Theory),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4y3zb5/everythingvalyrian_steel_swords_are_smithed_with/,Lansdolli,1471412164,"I believe that the secret ingredient to make Valyrian Swords is Dragonglass or obsidian. This would make since considering both obsidian and Valyrian Steel seem to be the only way to kill white walkers. Let me know what you think. 

I apologize if this is a common theory I am new to the forums and have not seen it's like yet so I decided to share my thoughts on the matter with you all.

Edit: I may have just debunked my own theory. On the obsidian wiki page I learned that obsidian is classified as a glass (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian) which means it is unable to be smelted and as a result it is unlikely to be a part of Valyrian Steel. It is still possible just unlikely in my opinion. Thanks for everyones responses!

After Season 6 Episode 10, it way confirmed that the most popular fan theory was true (R+L=J). But one thing I noticed and many others did that Bran has no real proof of what he has saw, Bran has no accurate way of knowing that the child born was Jon (Lyanna also said a different name to Jon). Once Bran arrives back to Winterfell he may tell Jon what he saw at the Tower of Joy, and looking for answers he goes to the most obvious person for answers. Howland Reed. Howland along with Ned Stark were the only 2 survivors of the ToJ and now Howland is the only person alive who knows what really happened. Bran will say to Jon what he saw at the ToJ and Jon will look for answers and turn to Howland who is the only person who really knows Jon's parentage. 

So for Jon to learn his true parentage he'll go to Howland, but that doesn't mean he'll have support from the other Lords of the Realm since they can't believe the word of one man.",23,6,False,self,,,,,

At first LittleFinger gives Ned some good advices. He tells him to wait and see what happens and to act cautious and that they can work together. But then Ned insists that he supports Stannis and he needs men to take the throne for Stannis and then we know what happens after.

LittleFinger always wanted to get Ned in trouble and get Starks to join the war, right? Did he just say those things to ensure the right reaction from Ned? Knowing what the honorable Eddard Stark would do? Or LittleFinger was just lying anyways and the plans to imprison Ned was already in works so he was just hoping Ned would just stick around without him needing to pay Janos Slynt for extra favor? Or was he really, genuinely, giving him good advice?

**Edit:** I'm talking about that specific scene, not LittleFingers plan as a whole. That scene at first doesnt seem to go right with the rest of LittleFinger's plan. We now know that he always wanted a war to start, he schemed from the beginning to make Starks go to war with Lannisters. Yet in this scene I'm talking about, he is giving good advices to Ned, he is telling him to be cautious and not do the rash thing! why? Thats what I'm asking.

Now, bear with me for a second, especially if I sound like a broken record and you've heard this before.

Many people see the Night King as like, the Final Boss, but this can't be the case. It just can't be. It's too obvious for GRRM to write. 

The Night King is simply the personification of **Valar Morghulis**: All men must die. The real villain is politics and the people that choose evil over good, because they have that choice. The Night King doesn't have that choice, he was just made that way. He's an unstoppable force of destruction that is coming for everyone; good and evil. All men must die.

Which is where I see a very strong parallel.

[Such as this scene from Return of the King.](https://67.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ltq5lj615O1qcw8mro1_500.gif)

For those of you that can't see links, it's Aeowyn killing Sauron after he says ""No man can kill me"" and she responds with ""I am no man."" Why does this parallel with GoT?

Because of [this scene](https://img.pandawhale.com/post-26821-all-men-must-die-but-we-are-no-awdH.jpeg) when Dany says ""but we are not men"".

This leads me to believe that it's not Azor Ahai / Jon that will kill the Night King, but Dany. The prophecy is so obvious, and I know that it's a *great* theory that I absolutely love. I'd love for it to be Jon, the most deserving of them all, to kill the Night King, be recognized for his birth and status, and become some kind of King to either the North or to Westeros. But Jon has, time and time again, denied that he would ever want to hold such a title (even though he's basically King in the North now..)

I also don't see Dany as basically replacing the Mad King as going crazy herself. We've already seen Cersei basically take up that banner and wave it around for all (especially Jamie) to see. I don't think we have room for TWO mad queens. No, Cersei will be the main antagonist, even though plenty of people think Dany will go all Mad King on everyone. And if she doesn't, what role does she fit, then? What place does she take when it comes to the final endgame? Her body being the sheath to Lightbringer? I don't know. It's just so obvious.

But what an interesting and fitting nod to GRRM's inspiration, to have the series end in such a way, with Dany killing the Night King because of how unexpected it would be. For GRRM to build up this prophecy about Azor Ahai, only to have Dany be the one to win the war/ kill the Night King? What a misdirection. It would certainly blow my mind.

But I guess we'll just have to wait and see.

She is the ""Good"" person and everyone loves her. Tyrion hasnt seen much of her conquering and when she started down her usual path he pulled her back. Dany has acted correctly for Essos. Its a land still in slavery and cruelty. She was seen as a great warrior in Essos, but everything that makes her a good ruler is Essos makes her a tyrant in Westeros. 

The only douby in this theory is we have people from westeros backing her, but that could be because they see a power that could stop all the crap happening in westeros. She could take the 7 kingdoms, but I don't think she would be respected by the rest of westeros, especially the north. They will see her come in with an army and dragons and take westeros by force, claiming to be the true ruler. The north itself will not be content with that. Everyone but those with Dany will proably see her the same way. 

I would love to see the POV of dany from the people of westeros. We see her charging in as a hero and I would love to see the POV change to show her as a tyrant. Show arya watching in the streets, or from jaime watching her do terrible things. 

GRMM has stated that people are now pure good or evil. We all have both. He also says that he wont have the perfect heroes in white and the constant villian in black. Who do we know who wears white all the time? Dany. GRMM also likes to show war as a gruesome thing, war isnt good. Who wants to take westeros by force and has a massive army? Dany. 

I strongly believe dany will end up the villian and I really hope we see it happen. Hopefully they start to portray her as the villian or have one episode where the POV switches.",15,0,False,self,,,,,

Who's there?
Rhaegar
*Opens door*
Oh, hi Mance!

And so it begins.....

I have expanded on the much hated and impossible theory that Mance Rayder is Rhaegar Targaryen in disguise. This theory reinterprets the Battle on the Trident, the skirmish at the Tower of Joy and the destiny of the Seven Kingdoms. It brings back to life a handful of other characters believed dead including Ser Arthur Dayne, Ser Oswell Whent, and Lady Ashara Dayne. Also exploring the implications of Mance being Rhaegar and the plight of his sister Daenarys and three apparent sons; Aegon VI, Jon Snow and Aemon Steelsong. Feigning death, donning disguises and embracing secret identities are prevalent tactics throughout the series (comprehensive examples listed later) so please suspend your disbelief for a moment and humor the theory. 

Of all the great theories in the ASOIAF universe, the best one to start with is Rhaegar + Lyanna = Jon (R + L = J), which, in my opinion, elegantly ties together the song of ice and fire. Jon Snows story is the union that came of Lyanna Stark, descendent of the ancient blood of the First Men who found and conquered and bound the powers of the icy north, and Rhaegar Targaryan, of the ancient blood of the Valyrians who found and conquered and bound the powers of the fiery east. As the story goes, Rhaegar kidnapped Lyanna in the style of wildling courtship and took her to the Tower of Joy where Ned Stark later found her before returning to Winterfell with a baby named Jon Snow. Thus J = L + R = aSoIaF; making these three characters the centerpiece of the entire story.

In my opinion though, Rhaegar, the warrior bard who has caused so much drama and upheaval and grief is also the embodiment of fire as a Targaryen prince and of ice as the King-Beyond-the-Wall and the rest of the story is just the song he is living. But more on that later.

Here is a telling quote from the first time L + R encountered each other.

""Under Harren's roof he ate and drank with the wolves, and many of their sworn swords besides, barrowdown men and moose and bears and mermen. The dragon prince sang a song so sad it made the wolf maid sniffle, but when her pup brother teased her for crying she poured wine over his head. A black brother spoke, asking the knights to join the Night's Watch.""
-ASOS, pg. 281


I.              The Prince of Dragonstone Bested them All: The Kidnapping

We begin at the tourney of Harrenhal.

An important side story of the tournament is that Howland Reed was getting bullied by some other squires and is saved by the Knight of the Laughing Tree, a mysterious knight with a smiling weirwood sigil. Additionally, the KotLT story and theory behind it, told to Bran Stark by Meera Reed, mentions the beautiful Ashara Dayne and the little crannogman who couldnt take his eyes off of her. Just a fun little side story but with important future consequences, Ashara Dayne probably did the dirty with Howland and therefore Meera Reed is their daughter.

Ever paranoid of plots against him, Aerys tasks Rhaegar (amongst others) with discovering the identity of this mystery knight, which Rhaegar seemingly never does.

Yet when the jousting began, the day belonged to Rhaegar Targaryen. The crown prince wore the armor he would die in: gleaming black plate with the three-headed dragon of his House wrought in rubies on the breast. A plume of scarlet silk streamed behind him when he rode, and it seemed no lance could touch him. Brandon fell to him, and Bronze Yohn Royce, and even the splendid Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning.
-Eddard to Bran, AGOT

Ill now muddle into a grey area; glamours and such. The quote above indicates my speculation that Rhaegar used ruby glamours to cheat and win the tournament, thus winning the rights to name Lyanna Stark the Queen of Love and Beauty and some time later steal away with her. It is not necessary to my alternative story if Rhaegar cheated to win, but since he probably organized this tournament and changed the whole course of the kingdom through his victory, it would make sense that he wouldnt take any chances of losing if it could be helped. There is precedent of black metal and rubies used for glamours (changing appearances) by Maynard Plumm/Bloodraven (at a tournament no less) and Melisandre on Mance, Rattleshirt and herself. She also uses a glamour on Stannis sword, Lightbringer, which has a ruby hilt and was noted by Maester Aemon and Samwell Tarly as giving off no heat. Apparently the sword, Lightbringer, should give off heat from its flame.

If Rhaegar used this ruby armor for glamour and manipulation at Harrenhal, perhaps he used it again on the Ruby Ford at the moment of his apparent death, but more on that later. There is also good reason to believe Lyanna Stark was the mysterious Knight of the Laughing Tree, but I digress.

So as everyone knows, Rhaegar wins this tournament and famously declares Lyanna Stark the Queen of Love and Beauty.

Ned remembered the moment when all the smiles died, when Prince Rhaegar Targaryen urged his horse past his own wife, the Dornish princess Elia Martell, to lay the queen of beautys laurel in Lyannas lap. He could see it still: a crown of winter roses, blue as frost.
-AGOT Ned Chapter 58

Sometime after the tournament, Rhaegar, evidently attracted to Lyanna more than all others, including his own wife, absconded with Robert Baratheons betrothed which was the catalyst that leads to the death of Lyannas lord father, Rickard Stark and elder brother Brandon, who are put to death by the Mad King after Brandon showed up in Kings Landing demanding that Rhaegar return Lyanna to Winterfell. Aerys kills them brutally then demands the heads of Robert and Ned from Jon Arryn who refuses. All three call their respective kingdoms banners and march to war against the crown.

II.            Elk, Shadowcat and Prince in Black: The Battle of the Trident reimagined

A Game of Thrones, the book, begins about 15 years after Roberts Rebellion, otherwise known as the War of the Usurper, of which a key moment which shifted the balance of power in Westeros occurred when the allied rebel armies of Stark, Arryn, Tully and Baratheon led by Robert Baratheon met the loyalist armies of the Targaryens led by the Crown Prince Rhaegar Targaryen in the Battle of the Trident.

If the Battle on the Trident had gone differently, here would be the alternate reality:

Prince Rhaegar shook his head. ""My royal sire fears your father more than he does our cousin Robert. He wants you close, so Lord Tywin cannot harm him. I dare not take that crutch away from him at such an hour.""

Jaime's anger had risen up in his throat. ""I am not a crutch. I am a knight of the Kingsguard.""

Rhaegar had put his hand on Jaime's shoulder. ""When this battle's done I mean to call a council. Changes will be made. I meant to do it long ago, but... well, it does no good to speak of roads not taken. We shall talk when I return.""
-Jaime 1 AFFC

The Battle went otherwise.

Multiple sources mention the battle, which ended when Robert caved in the ruby encrusted breastplate of Rhaegar, scattering his rubies and his retainers across the Ruby Ford, while he lay dying in the waters. Ruby, ruby, ruby. Notably, two of the Kingsguard were also killed in this battle, Prince Lewyn Martell and Ser Jonathor Darry. Rhaegar also had two squires, Myles Mooten who died earlier at the Battle of the Bells and Richard Lonmouth, the Knight of Skulls and Kisses, whose death is presumed at the Trident but unaccounted for.

So we get to my first big leap; Rhaegar surviving Roberts legendary warhammer blow on the Ruby Ford, hang in there. As my theory will go on to claim that Mance is Rhaegar in disguise, Id like to use Mances origin story and his story of his abandonment of the Nights Watch. Mostly everything we know about Mances origin came from him or Qhorin. This theory then assumes Mance has lied to Jon Snow and the readers but there are some interesting allegories to be found.

First of all, Mance Rayder is mentioned as early as the first chapter of the first book, in the second paragraph with the story of the Nights Watch deserter:

The man had been taken outside a small holdfast in the hills. Robb thought he was a wildling, his sword sworn to Mance Rayder, the King beyond-the-Wall.
AGOT, Bran Chapter 1

From Mances mouth we hear his origin story:

 My birth is as low as a mans can get, no septons ever smeared my head with oils, I dont own any castles, and my queen wears furs and amber, not silk and sapphires. I am my own champion, my own fool, and my own harpist. You dont become King- beyond-the-Wall because your father was. The free folk wont follow a name, and they dont care which brother was born first. They follow fighters. When I left the Shadow Tower there were five men making noises about how they might be the stuff of kings. Tormund was one, the Magnar another. The other three I slew, when they made it plain theyd sooner fight than follow.
(Jon X, ASoS)

His mention here of sapphires is telling. Here is a list of all 25 times in ASOIAF when sapphires were mentioned and a secret was being withheld. What is Mance not sharing?

Say the secret is that Mance is Rhaegar, his birth was as high as a mans can get, a septon anointed his head with oils, he was the Prince of Dragonstone and he clad himself in silks. He is still his own champion, fool and harpist and he became King-beyond-the-Wall by his own merit, despite his crazy father.

Ok, Id next like to repurpose Mances story of abandoning the Wall with Rhaegars death.

One day on a ranging we brought down a fine big elk. We were skinning it when the smell of blood drew a shadowcat out of its lair. I drove it off, but not before it shredded my cloak to ribbons. Do you see? Here, here, and here? He chuckled. It shredded my arm and back as well, and I bled worse than the elk. My brothers feared I might die before they got me back to Maester Mullin at the Shadow Tower, so they carried me to a wildling village where we knew an old wisewoman did some healing. She was dead, as it happened, but her daughter saw to me. Cleaned my wounds, sewed me up, and fed me porridge and potions until I was strong enough to ride again. And she sewed up the rents in my cloak as well, with some scarlet silk from Asshai that her grandmother had pulled from the wreck of a cog washed up on the Frozen Shore. It was the greatest treasure she had, and her gift to me. He swept the cloak back over his shoulders. But at the Shadow Tower, I was given a new wool cloak from stores, black and black, and trimmed with black, to go with my black breeches and black boots, my black doublet and black mail. The new cloak had no frays nor rips nor tears... and most of all, no red. The men of the Nights Watch dressed in black, Ser Denys Mallister reminded me sternly, as if I had forgotten. My old cloak was fit for burning now, he said.
I left the next morning... for a place where a kiss was not a crime, and a man could wear any cloak he chose.
(Jon I, ASoS)
A fun side gamed called the Corn Code theory might indicate that the here, here, and here? question indicates uncertainty in the story. But I wont get into that.

I would repurpose this story instead as the story of Rhaegar meeting Robert on the Trident. Robert is symbolized by the big elk (stag of Baratheon) and the shadowcat is Roberts fury. They wound each other. Robert is so wounded that he cannot continue on to Kings Landing and Rhaegar, per the story, was bleeding worse than the elk. Instead of getting to Maester Mullin and the Shadow Tower, Rhaegar probably wanted to be with Lyanna at the Tower of Joy where his Queen of Love and Beauty was on her deathbed. Anyway, he is hurt too bad to make it far so his brothers bring him somewhere for immediate care. Rhaegar is nursed back to health, perhaps by some kind of wisewoman. The only one I know he is associated with is the Ghost of High Heart, who was once brought to Summerhall by Jenny of Oldstones and foretold of TPTWP. At Summerhall, the wisewoman foretold that TPTWP would be born of Aerys and Rhaellas line. The Ghost is alive per Arya and Brotherhood Without Banners encounter, but who knows what happened with Rhaegar after the Battle.

This would be the point of the theory where Rhaegar dies and dons a new disguise. I think the red silk from Asshai in his cloak may be part of a glamour, but I agree that is a stretch.  Rhaegar then hides in the Riverlands until he can reunite with Ser Arthur Dayne and head to the Wall.
As cool as Mances background story is, a cog from Asshai crashing or washing up on the Frozen Shore north of the Wall doesnt make any sense. I made a proposal earlier that he used the rubies as a glamour in the Harrenhal Tourney. Perhaps the red silk plays a part in that too.

The crown prince wore the armor he would die in: gleaming black plate with the three-headed dragon of his House wrought in rubies on the breast. A plume of scarlet silk streamed behind him when he rode, and it seemed no lance could touch him. Brandon fell to him, and Bronze Yohn Royce, and even the splendid Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning.
-Eddard to Bran, AGOT

Here is what Melisandre says of glamours:

The spell is made of shadow and suggestion. Men see what they expect to see. The bones are part of that. Was I wrong to spare this one? If the glamor fails, they will kill you.
Melisandre, ADwD

We will come back to the part about Rhaegar/Mance joining and abandoning the Nights Watch soon.

III.            Our Knees do Not Bend Easily: The Tower of Joy

After the Battle of the Trident and with Robert wounded, Ned leads the armies to Kings Landing and Storms End, then takes a small detachment of his close friends to pursue Lyanna. He finds Lyanna under guard by three Kingsguard at the Tower of Joy near the Princes Pass in the Red Mountains of Dorne.

I looked for you on the Trident, Ned said to them.
We were not there, Ser Gerold answered.
Woe to the Usurper if we had been, said Ser Oswell.
When King's Landing fell, Ser Jaime slew your king with a golden sword, and I wondered where you were.
Far away, Ser Gerold said, or Aerys would yet sit the Iron Throne, and our false brother would burn in seven hells.
I came down on Storm's End to lift the siege, Ned told them, and the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne dipped their banners, and all their knights bent the knee to pledge us fealty. I was certain you would be among them.
Our knees do not bend easily, said Ser Arthur Dayne.
Ser Willem Darry is fled to Dragonstone, with your queen and Prince Viserys. I thought you might have sailed with him.
Ser Willem is a good man and true, said Ser Oswell.
But not of the Kingsguard, Ser Gerold pointed out. The Kingsguard does not flee.
Then or now, said Ser Arthur. He donned his helm.
We swore a vow, explained old Ser Gerold.
Neds wraiths moved up beside him, with shadow swords in hand. They were seven against three.
And now it begins, said Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning. He unsheathed Dawn and held it with both hands. The blade was pale as milkglass, alive with light.
No, Ned said with sadness in his voice. Now it ends.
-AGOT Chapter 39

Id like to note Ser Arthurs comment, Our knees do not bend easily, as another important character says something similar later.

Here is my alternate theory on the skirmish at the Tower of Joy. The fight takes place with seven northmen against three Kingsguard; Lord Commander Gerold Hightower, Ser Oswell Whent, and Ser Arthur Dayne against the northmen; Ned Stark, Howland Reed and Lord Dustin, a Cassel, a Wull, a Glover, and a Ryswell.

We should assume the Kingsguard are as legendary that day as they should be, because why wouldnt they be, and hold their own against the seven. As Jaime Lannister remembered he could, Arthur Dayne fights against several men, including Ned Stark, the best of the northern fighters, and Martyn Cassel, captain of Neds household guard. Howland Reed at first refuses to fight his brother-in-law, Ser Arthur, and abstains from the fighting, trying to calm hotter heads and propose a peace agreement. Lord Dustin and Mark Ryswell, family friend of the Dustins (Barbrey Ryswell had married Lord Dustin) take on the aging White Bull, Ser Gerold Hightower. Lets say all three suffer injury and die of their wounds because I dont have any leads on them from after this day. Theo Wull (Bucket), advanced in age and Ethan Glover, former squire of Neds brother Brandon and rusty from dwelling for months in the dungeons of Kings Landing since Brandons death, take on Ser Oswell who defeats them both. As the fighting settles and the odds turn in favor of the Kingsguard, Arthur presses the attack on Ned but Howland finally enters the fray in defense of his liege lord and severs the fingers of the Sword of the Mornings fighting hand.

I learned from Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning, who could have slain all five of you with his left hand while he was taking a piss with his right.
-Jaime to Kingsguard, ASOS chapter 67

Ser Arthur continues to fight with his left hand and Ned decides to yield. Thus Howland Reed saves Ned from Ser Arthur.

The finest knight I ever saw was Ser Arthur Dayne, who fought with a blade called Dawn, forged from the heart of a fallen star. They called him the Sword of the Morning, and he would have killed me but for Howland Reed.
-Ned Stark to Bran, ACOK chapter 21

The fighting subsides and the two remaining Kingsguard escort Ned to his dying sisters bedside, where he first meets the infant Jon Snow. Lyanna makes Ned promise to care for the child, to keep him secret and safe. She dies with a smell of blood and roses in the air.

Promise me, Ned.
-AGOT, Ned chapter 48

So this story is only different from the original in that Ser Oswell and Ser Arthur survive instead of die. Since they were two of the best swordmen in the realm (albeit not much accreditation to Ser Oswells exploits, just that he was part of the most legendary Kingsguard of all time) and since there is a sliver of evidence which lets me think they lived, lets say they lived and keep going with this.

The four remaining combatants, Ser Arthur, Ser Oswell, Ned and Howland, reach a settlement. Howland Reed and Ned resolve to return to Starfall, with the bones of Ser Arthur (which are actually those of Lord Dustin.. I say this because Lady Barbrey is mad that she never received Lord Dustins bones) and the sword Dawn, to lay the foundations of the lie of Ser Arthurs death, claim Howlands wife Ashara Dayne and their infant daughter Meera, who was conceived at the Tournament of Harrenhal, and return to Greywater Watch in the Neck. Ashara fakes her death with the legendary leap from the Palestone Tower and has been living in the Neck unseen since then. Nobody has seen Howland Reed but a handful of times since this day, and their castle has no maesters or ravens and apparently floats around, so Ashara living in secrecy seems plausible.

Ser Arthur agrees to take the black at the Shadow Tower under the name of Qhorin Halfhand, hoping to reunite with his liege, Prince Rhaegar, soon to be disguised as Mance Rayder. Remember my theory has Howland Reed chopping off some of his fingers while saving Ned, which is badass, but Qhorins story is that a wildling chopped of some of his fingers with an ax. Potato/Patato. The Lord Commander of the Nights Watch, Qorgyle of Sandstone, friend of Winterfell and originally from a castle close to the Daynes Starfall, maybe helps with this ruse.

Ser Oswell, a good man and true, cannot agree to take the black and accuses Ser Arthur of doing the one thing the Kingsguard must not, giving up the safety of the only assuredly living king, Jon Snow. Ser Oswell instead adopts the name of Oswell Kettleblack to embrace his shame and flees to the Vale. He eventually joins the service of Petyr Baelish and his sons serve on Cerceis Kingsguard and as bodyguards. Is this too much of a stretch?.. guy with the same first name who was on the Kingsguard himself, didnt die, fled and had sons who through connections and some prowess get on the Kingsguard too. Maybe but I like it and the Kettleblacks are a little mysterious.

Here are the people involved at the Tower of Joy:

       Eddard Stark  returns to Winterfell with infant Jon Snow
       Howland Reed  returns to Greywater Watch with Ashara Dayne and infant Meera Reed
       Ser Arthur Dayne  takes the Black as Qhorin Halfhand
       Ser Oswell Whent  Fleas to the Vale as Oswell Kettleblack
       Ser Gerold Hightower  Deceased or returns to the Hightower in Oldtown
       Lord Willam Dustin - Deceased
       Ethan Glover - Deceased
       Martyn Cassel - Deceased
       Theo Wull  - Deceased
       Mark Ryswell  Deceased
       Lyanna Stark - Deceased
       Jon Snow  returns to Winterfell with Eddard Stark

IV.             Shadows Are Friends to Men in Black: Joining the Nights Watch

So now we have both Rhaegar and Arthur alive and with the purpose of taking the Black to defend the realm at the Wall. Rhaegar wants to do this to serve a great cause of battling the coming winter in the song of ice and fire. Arthur wants to serve his friend and king. Both were wounded in their battles. Both are well known, easily recognized characters so they would need fail-proof disguises and cover stories.

So yes, its convenient to the entire plot of the story for Rhaegar to still be alive and to continue his pursuit of prophecy and defense of the realm of men. He seemingly died at Roberts hand on the Trident with hundreds of witnesses etc. but maybe glamours, maybe faked death, maybe carried away and was only wounded. Maybe it wasnt Rhaegar but someone disguised in his famous armor like when Garlan Tyrell wore Renlys famous green armor and antlered helm in the Battle of the Blackwater and hundreds believed it was Renlys ghost. Remember people close to Rhaegar like Ser Jonathor Darry and Ser Richard Lonmouth also died in this battle with no attribution to their death. Maybe people were distracted because they were chasing his scattered rubies or getting the wounded Robert to safety. Sure GRRM said Rhaegar died and was cremated but he cant very well say otherwise, and Rhaegars sister survived her little adventure into Drogos funeral pyre and was reborn as the Mother of Dragons. There are plenty of instances where those thought dead were actually not dead. I know, its a stretch but its possible, and if he didnt die it would have to be kept secret and where better to start again fresh but as a man of the Nights Watch, whose purpose is to defend the realms of men.

Rhaegar, now healed and disguised as Mance rendezvouses with Ser Arthur and proceeds to the Shadow Tower.  Mance takes the vows, stays awhile but eventually heads beyond-the-wall for a place where a kiss was not a crime, and a man could wear any cloak he chose.

A reminder of what Rhaegar was like:

What was he truly like?
The old man considered a moment. Able. That above all. Determined, deliberate, dutiful, single-minded.
- Barristan and Dany, about Rhaegar, ASOS page 111


V.            You dont become King- beyond-the-Wall because your Father Was:  Army Muster

Rhaegar is now Mance. Eventually, Mance abandons the Nights Watch to join the Free Folk north of the wall. He spends years rallying most of the wilding clans to his cause by besting their clan champions and joining them to his army. Apparently there were five other would-be kings-beyond-the-wall. Mance killed three while Tormund and the Magnar of Thenn joined his cause.

Mance had spent years assembling this vast plodding host, talking to this clan mother and that magnar, winning one village with sweet words and another with a song and a third with the edge of his sword, making peace between Harma Dogshead and the Lord o Bones, between the Hornfoots and the Nightrunners, between the walrus men of the Frozen Shore and the cannibal clans of the great ice rivers, hammering a hundred different daggers into one great spear, aimed at the heart of the Seven Kingdoms. He had no crown nor scepter, no robes of silk and velvet, but it was plain to Jon that Mance Rayder was a king in more than name.
(Jon II, ASoS)

I like the part about a hundred different daggers. It reminds me of the swords that make up the Iron Throne. After years of this, Mance becomes known as the King-Beyond-The-Wall with a massive, though undisciplined army. Knowing winter is coming, and knowing the Others are coming, his goal is to get the wildings south of the wall. Maybe for the same reason as Jon wants the wildlings south of the wall, because hundreds of thousands of dead wildlings will be reanimated as undead wights.

You know nothing. You killed a dead man, aye, I heard. Mance killed a hundred.
Tormund to Jon, Jon XII, ADwD

Raymun Redbeard, Bael the Bard, Gendel and Gorne, the Horned Lord, they all came south to conquer, but Ive come with my tail between my legs to hide behind your Wall. 
Mance to Jon, ASoS, Jon X

Mance searches through old graves looking for the Horn of Winter and seemingly never finds it. Jon and Sam did once find a horn filled with dragonglass spears at the Fist of the First Men. The horn seemed broken and so Jon gave it to Sam and the horn is now with Mances son Aemon Steelsong on their way to Dany. More on that soon.

Mance finally attacks the Wall, is routed by Jon and more so by Stannis. Stannis would be Mances cousin but thats probably not relevant here, although Stannis saw his father drown on a return trip from the free cities to look for a bride for Rhaegar under Aerys orders. Anyway, Mance is captured and his wife Dalla dies during the battle birthing his son. A quick side story:

Jon switched Gillys baby with Mances baby so that Melisandre cant burn the baby for kingsblood and sends Gilly, Sam, the baby, and Maester Aemon off to Oldtown. Gilly and Sam discuss naming Mances baby Aemon Steelsong, a notably Targaryen name, after the maester. Lets just call this a beautiful poetic coincidence. If Mance is Rhaegar, Dalla would be his third wife and Aemon Steelsong his third son. This would be his second wife to die in child birth, the other being Lyanna Stark. His first wife, Elia, almost died birthing Aegon and Rhaenys before that.

Sam and co. arrive in Oldtown. Sam says:

Can Gilly stay aboard till I return?
Gilly can stay as long as she likes. She poked Sam in the belly with a finger. She does not eat so much as some.
(Samwell V, AFfC)

Sam the Slayer, gets off the boat and immediately meets Alleras the Sphinx and Marwyn the Mage who hears Sams story and immediately leaves. Sam asks Marwyn what hes going to do:

Get myself to Slavers Bay, in Aemons place. The swan ship that delivered Slayer should serve my needs well enough. The grey sheep will send their man on a galley, I dont doubt. With fair winds I should reach her first.
[...]
Sphinx, look after this one.
I will, Alleras answered, but the archmaester was already gone. They heard his boots stomping down the steps.
Where has he gone? asked Sam, bewildered.
To the docks. The Mage is not a man who believes in wasting time.
(Samwell V, AFfC)

So Mances baby, Aemon Steelsong, may accidently be headed for Daenarys aboard the Cinnamon Wind with Marwyn. Dany would be Aemons aunt. Lets get back to the original theory and cite a few more pieces of speculation.

VI.          The Halfhand of the King

If we could prove that Qhorin Halfhand was Ser Arthur Dayne it would lend a lot more credence to Mance being Rhaegar. Sadly, there isnt much direct evidence but it is fun to reread thinking it could be true.

When Jon and Qhorin first meet:

The ranger gave his horse into the care of one of his men and followed. You are Jon Snow. You have your fathers look.
(Jon V, ACoK)

Jon is never described as looking like Ned Stark, though he is mentioned as looking like Arya who is described as looking Lyanna. I believe Robb, Sansa and Bran are noted more for their Tully features. Qhorin as Arthur would know Jons father, Mance/Rhaegar but this proves nothing for Qhorin maybe just knows the Stark look.. Mance later says:

The singer rose to his feet. Im Mance Rayder, he said as he put aside the lute. And you are Ned Starks bastard, the Snow of Winterfell.
Stunned, Jon stood speechless for a moment, before he recovered enough to say, How... how could you know...
(Jon I, ASoS)

Note he did not say Ned Starks son or bastard son. These comments are interesting because both Qhorin and Mance recognize Jon on site. However, Mance has secretly seen Jon Snow multiple times in Winterfell, including when Robert came to ask Ned to be Hand:

 I took a lute and a bag of silver, scaled the ice near Long Barrow, walked a few leagues south of the New Gift, and bought a horse. All in all I made much better time than Robert, who was traveling with a ponderous great wheelhouse to keep his queen in comfort. A day south of Winterfell I came up on him and fell in with his company. Freeriders and hedge knights are always attaching themselves to royal processions, in hopes of finding service with the king, and my lute gained me easy acceptance. He laughed. I know every bawdy song thats ever been made, north or south of the Wall. So there you are. The night your father feasted Robert, I sat in the back of his hall on a bench with the other freeriders, listening to Orland of Oldtown play the high harp and sing of dead kings beneath the sea. I betook of your lord fathers meat and mead, had a look at Kingslayer and Imp... and made passing note of Lord Eddards children and the wolf pups that ran at their heels.
ASOS, Jon I

Here it seems that Mance does refer to Ned as Jons lord father, but also distinguishes that from Lord Eddards children, no longer referring to Jon. Not sure what to make of this.

It seems that the wildlings will only accept Jon Snows defection of the Watch under certain conditions. Here is how Qhorin charges him:

We may escape them yet, the ranger said. Or not.
Im not afraid to die. It was only half a lie.
It may not be so easy as that, Jon.
He did not understand. What do you mean?
If we are taken, you must yield.
Yield? He blinked in disbelief. The wildlings did not make captives of the men they called the crows. They killed them, except for . . . They only spare oathbreakers. Those who join them, like Mance Rayder.
And you.
No. He shook his head. Never. I wont.
You will. I command it of you.
Command it? But . . .
Our honor means no more than our lives, so long as the realm is safe. Are you a man of the Nights Watch?
Yes, but
There is no but, Jon Snow. You are, or you are not.
Jon sat up straight. I am.
Then hear me. If we are taken, you will go over to them, as the wildling girl you captured once urged you. They may demand that you cut your cloak to ribbons, that you swear them an oath on your fathers grave, that you curse your brothers and your Lord Commander. You must not balk, whatever is asked of you. Do as they bid you . . . but in your heart, remember who and what you are. Ride with them, eat with them, fight with them, for as long as it takes. And watch.
For what? Jon asked.
Would that I knew, said Qhorin. Your wolf saw their diggings in the valley of the Milkwater. What did they seek, in such a bleak and distant place? Did they find it? That is what you must learn, before you return to Lord Mormont and your brothers. That is the duty I lay on you, Jon Snow.

There is a little cited story of one of Qhorins exploits. Apparently, he spent a year alone in the Skirlling Pass on a ranging, his company all dead, and survived to return to the Shadow Tower. Ill have to look harder for this quote. I would surmise that he used that time to meet for a final time with Mance, who was gathering an army in the Frostfangs beyond the Skirlling Pass, and make plans for the reunion of Jon Snow and Rhaegar as Mance. Until I find the quote, forget that. Anyway, here is Qhorins demise:

The big spearwife narrowed her eyes and said, If the crow would join the free folk, let him show us his prowess and prove the truth of him.
Ill do whatever you ask. The words came hard, but Jon said them.
Rattleshirts bone armor clattered loudly as he laughed. Then kill the Halfhand, bastard.
As if he could, said Qhorin. Turn, Snow, and die.
And then Qhorins sword was coming at him and somehow Longclaw leapt upward to block. The force of impact almost knocked the bastard blade from Jons hand, and sent him staggering backward. You must not balk, whatever is asked of you.
[]
Even when Ghost's teeth closed savagely around the ranger's calf, somehow Qhorin kept his feet. But in that instant, as he twisted, the opening was there. Jon planted and pivoted. The ranger was leaning away, and for an instant it seemed that Jon's slash had not touched him. Then a string of red tears appeared across the big man's throat, bright as a ruby necklace, and the blood gushed out of him, and Qhorin Halfhand fell.
[]
He knew, he thought numbly. He knew what they would ask of me.
AKOK, Jon chapter 68

Interesting about the ruby reference but no matter. If Qhorin Halfhand is Ser Arthur Dayne then it seems like a dull ending for the infamous Sword of the Morning. Even a bywatcher of the fight comments:

Ragwyle laughed. ""Who would have thought it? Qhorin Halfhand slain by some lordling's byblow.""
AKOK, Jon chapter 68

However, perhaps this was always Ser Arthurs purpose. It would be a bittersweet irony if Qhorin/Arthur, of the Kingsguard and Nights Watch, died defending the Targaryen prince Jon Snow, as he was first thought to have done at the Tower of Joy. At least he died with steel in his hand, serving and protecting his kings son.

We can only die. Why else do we don these black cloaks, but to die in defense of the realm?
Qhorin to Lord Commander Jeor Mormont, AKOK, Jon chapter 43

VII.            Conclusions

So, if Mance is Rhaegar then Rhaegar is still alive. If Rhaegar is still alive, he is the rightful ruler as King of the Seven Kingdoms, Lord of the Andals, the Rhoynar and the First Men. He is also King-Beyond-the-Wall. He also might be prisoner to Ramsay in a cold cage in Winterfell for all the north to see but this sets up nicely for the great reveal.

If Aegon is really Aegon VI, he is the heir to the throne and the Prince of Dragonstone. He also solidifies Rhaegars marriage to Dorne.

If Rhaegar actually married Lyanna, then Jon Snow is legitimized as Jon Targaryen and second in line after Aegon. Jon solidifies Rhaegars marriage to the North.

Aemon Steelsong is a legitimate son of Mance Rayder, who was married to Dalla, so Aemon Steelsong would be third in line to the throne. This would solidify Rhaegars marriage to the lands beyond-the-wall.

Baby Aemon might soon be in the possession of his aunt, Daenarys, who has no claim to the throne by the laws of male heredity but the Targaryens are known for marrying their siblings and cousins so she might marry Rhaegar, Aegon, Jon or Aemon.

Rhaegar as Mance as Rattleshirt beat Jon Snow in a sword fight so lets say he is the best swordsman of this group and that he ends up with his old buddy Ser Arthurs legendary sword Dawn, which seems to make sense as Lightbringer since it was forged from a meteor from outer space thousands of years ago and is called Dawn which is when the light of day is brought to the dark of night. That makes Rhaegar/Mance into Azor Ahai.

Since Dany has a dream prophecy where Rhaegar named Aegon the prince that was promised it seems to make sense that Aegon is TPTWP. However, Jon Snow is a better fit for having a song of ice and fire, since his mother was ice and his father was fire. Baby Aemon is also a good fit for ice and fire since Mance is fire and Dalla is ice. Dany fits the born amidst smoke and salt bit.

Maybe Dany can rally the eastern cities, the free cities and the Ironborne through Victarion who brings the Iron Islands and by Eurons conquest, Highgarden, Oldtown and the Reach, Aegon can bring Dorne, Aegon and/or Stannis the Stormlands, Jaime the Westerlands, Rickon the North, Sansa the Vale and Riverlands, Mance the wildlings, Bran the Old Gods and Arya the full fury of a thousand wolves.

We could just say they are all promised princes and princesses and they will all be part of the greater song when the full forces of ice clash with the full forces of fire. As for me, Im rooting for Rhaegar.

A parting thought:

I think Mances name, which seems to reference no other character or plot device, simply means home. A manse is a home. Home for Mance would be Summerhall, so his adopted name would constantly remind Rhaegar of summer.

And yet Summerhall was the place the prince loved best. He would go there from time to time, with only his harp for company.

The point of this is that it's a game and the watcher has to guess what's going to happen in Season 6 by Eliminating which one they think was a lie. 

Maisie replied with:
1) Arya goes back to Westeros, back over the sea
2) Arya is in the trailer more times than people have realised because they don't realise it was her
3) Arya doesn't cross anymore names off her list

Sophie replied:
1) Ramsay dies
2) Lady Stoneheart returns
3) Arya checks three people off her list

Okay so in regards to Maisie Williams' answer it is obvious that the lie is that ""Arya doesn't cross any more names off her list"" as we know that in S6 Ep10, she kills Walder Frey.

However, Sophie's answer brings confusion.  Obviously we know that Ramsey dies in S6Ep9 so we know that that is one of the truths. However, ""Arya crosses Three more people off her list"" is obviously the lie as that didn't happen and I don't think that was ever the plan for Season 6.

It is simple, straightforward and entirely accurate.

So this is how it goes:

You remember the Tourney of Harrenhall? Well, right before the Tourney, winter in Westeros was brutal, and two turns later, winter returned with a vengeance. Now while we have all been focusing on Starks, Lannisters, Baratheons, Arryns, Targareyns, let's, please turn our attention for a minute to the King in the North.

Imagine a winter so severe; it is leading the Southron Lords like Rhaegar to act totally out of character.

Now imagine the Night King. He has to feed his dead in the midst of this dreaded winter. For some reason, someone has been spreading rumors about him so he cannot go to Wildlings for help, Castle Black is completely out of the question, thanks to some fake corpse queen and her Lord Commander. So who does he turn to in his hour of need?

Yes, you guessed correct! The Iron Bank. He walks in to see an unfazed group of bankers. He asks them for help. They agree to give him a loan ( the Night King doesn't know the meaning), but they say he has to provide them with collateral. Not knowing what this means, the Night King puts up his entire kingdom of Land of Always Winter as collateral. The bankers charge the Night King 50% APR for an undisclosed amount, this they say is the most generous offer they can make, only because of the prime property the King just put as collateral and the fact that he is you know the Night King. Now remember the Night King knows nothing.

The Night King goes back home with the offer, not knowing he has signed away his life and that of his people, to someone even the devils are afraid. He writes songs about the Iron Bank and prays to the old god and new for their eternal prosperity. Years pass and the minions of Iron Bank come to collect from the Night King. The Night King is shocked. Before he has time to get around the esoteric terms being thrown at him, including sub-prime, derivatives, own ABS, he is given a 24-hour notice to collect his belongings and lead his people out of Land of Always Winter.

Night King is terrified. What are these ancestral weapons the Iron Bank is using to throw us out of our homes, he thinks? More importantly, how can we destroy them? Does Valyarian steel work he ponders? I wish there were dragons he thinks.

The Night King is devastated. He thought the bankers were real people, but what can he do? The weapon Subprime and Synthetic CDO sound very dangerous to him, so he relents.

He thinks he needs to talk to the wildlings but then decides, they know nothing just like him. He then sends out spies to collect more information about this bank. He learns, the Iron Bank has given used the same weapon against Lannisters, Baratheon's and he hears rumors that even Starks and with them Winterfell has fallen to this weapon of the Storm Gods and BloodStone Emperor.

He tells his Hand, to get ready to march to Braavos but his hand tells him this evil force can't be destroyed by the Night King alone. They need all of the Westeros to unite. Night King agrees. They march towards Hardhome.

Then in Hardhome he sees the Lord of Light, the only man who can bring down the agents of dark force. He sees Jon Snow, the Lord Commander. He lifts his hand, urging Jon Snow to join forces.

By this time GRRM is exhausted so he decides: let me kill them all. Let me kill them all. So he kills them all like in ""Departed"". 

The End.

However, beyond that, I haven't seen much else regarding the future of his character, so I thought I'd ask what you all think will come of him after he kills/doesn't kill Cersei.


I thought of a possible path for him the other day after reading a thread about what would make fans of Dany hate her. One comment read that she'd be unliked if she executed Jaime, and considering Jaime's role in Robert's Rebellion, it's a very possible outcome that could occur. I believe that she will try (but fail) to have Jaime killed for what he did to her father. Why does she fail? Tyrion.


Tyrion owes Jaime for what Jaime did to save Tyrion in season 4. As a result, I believe Tyrion will either a) secretly release Jaime (perhaps fulfilling the betrayal for love prophecy?) or b) have him sent to the Wall. Either way, I believe Jaime will be heading to the North relatively soon. Once in the North, Jaime should (hopefully) be able to finally complete his redemption arc.


Now, even if Jaime is being sent to the Wall by Dany, there's no way he's going to make it there. I can't imagine the Wall holding back the White Walker threat much longer, and I believe he would be stopped by Stark forces anyway. This is where a number of events could occur:

1) Jon Snow may hold Jaime Lannister accountable for the assassin sent after Bran (Lannister knife). At this point, Jaime may argue that he didn't have any part in the event. Since Sansa witnessed the conversation between Littlefinger and Lysa Arryn, she could even back his story (in a way, making up for not defending Arya against Joffrey). This could be the nail in Littlefinger's coffin.

2) Jaime and Brienne, being reunited again (with Cersei out of the picture), may finally become something more than just companions.

3) Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, Jaime has a chance to show how he's become a more humble man. Jaime, being the head of the Westerlands, may choose to willingly bend the knee to Jon Snow, the King of North, not only providing a vast army to the North (which might be needed IF a Dany-Jon War does break out), but also finally putting to rest the great Stark-Lannister feud once and for all.

He has experience acting in a medieval setting recently on the show The Last Kingdom (another book adaptation) which won't go amiss if he finds himself in the fantasy world of asoiaf.

Any thoughts on this? Perhaps someone can find a good picture to Photoshop some Targaryen hair on him?

Apologies for my writing (i am new to reddit and game of thrones)
Ned Stark will be back !!
Well i don't know if people may have noticed or not(most likely because i just watched all seasons previous week back to back)...so when i was watching the finale of season 1 again,the bit at the end surprised me,when jon snow is talking with lord commander mormont.
 - Mormont : ""At least you weren't whoring in Mole's Town""
 - Mormont : "" Honor made you leave Honor Honor brought you pack""
 - Jon snow : "" My friends brought me back""
 - Mormont :  "" I didn't say it was Your honor""
 - Jon Snow : "" They killed my father""
 - Mormont : "" And you are gonna bring him back to life""

So at first like most people i thought it was just him saying its your friend's honor that brought him back and past is past you can't change what happened to your father .

But with the amount of foreshadowing in the tv series,i am quite postive it pointstowards  ned stark revival.
How ?,Well honor brought made you leave meaning ned stark's death and honor brought you back pointing to ned stark's revival 
then jon says my friends brought me back meaning how he was brought back to life in season 6
Then Mormont says i did not say it was your honor  indicating to ned stark's honor.
and then mormont says you are gonna bring him back  meaning jon's going to bring ned back
another evidence is that when jons about to leave winter fell ned says next time we meet i will tell you all about your mother meaning ned will tell him R + L = J.
or it could all just be wrong and m overthinking and daydreamng.Anyways more food for thought

Military power in feudal societies rested on land. The King or Lord held title to the land. The land was granted either for one life span or as a hereditary holding to men who pledged their loyalty. The holding of land was contingent on military service. The man who held the land, depending on its extent, would be required to provide a knight and his entourage or as many knights and other men-at-arms as the wealth of his land could support. This obligation was tied to the holding of land. The military power of a King or Lord was counted in the number of knights he could mobilize and deploy. In GoT, the obligations run up from the simple knight to the Bannerman to the Lord of a Lesser House (Mormont) to the Lord of a Greater House (Starks) to the Lord Paramount and Warden (Lord Stark) to the King. Historically, in general, theoretically, a knight served at the pleasure of his lord, but realistically by the late Middle Ages, the service on campaign was limited thirty days at the knight's own expense, with the King or Lord paying the knight for further service should the knight volunteer. In addition, a knight could be expected to perform thirty days of guard duty as the garrison of one of his lord's castles or forts. The exception to this rule involved an invasion of his lord's lands within a specified distance of the knight's residence. A knight who lost his holding, lost his obligations and his wealth, leaving him with his horse, arms and armor to make his way in the world.
A second source of knights were knights drawn to the lord's household, where the lord took the obligation to feed, house, equip and arm the knight and his entourage and the knight served at the lord's leave and performed whatever tasks assigned him. A wealthy lord could keep a large household. A King, such Haraald, could keep hundreds of Huscarls in his household.
Finally, a lord could engage the services of landless knights and men-at-arms, paying them by contract for specified services, such as for a campaign or for garrisoning a castle for a year. It took a wealthy lord to hire any number of  mercenaries. Such men had lower social standing, much like ronin in Japan. A knight without land was, in feudal society, a contradiction in terms.
It was always assumed that a knight would be accompanied by his entourage, which was composed of his squire, his page and at least one servant, all mounted and with his possessions on a packhorse. The squire, a knight in training, would ride a hunter, somewhat less massive than a warhorse. He would be armed with lance and sword, more lightly armored with a shield. The squires would usually be collected and would fill the ranks behind the knights. The page served the knight and helped the squire. The servant(s) took care of the baggage and the dirty work. The servant(s) was usually armed with a spear or missile weapons and maybe a helmet and was expected to guard the baggage during a battle. A knight might also have one or two extra horses, an additional warhorse or a riding horse for marches, when he was usually out of his armor. So a force of a thousand knights might include a thousand squires, two or more thousand pages and servants and more than 5,000 horses. 
A knight was universally defined as a heavily armed and armored horseman. It took substantial wealth, generated by the output of the land and its serfs/slaves/peasants to support a knight. His primary equipment was his warhorse, a horse with sufficient blood to be quick and fast but large enough to bear the weight of a man and his armor (in other words, not a Clysdale, more a large hunter). Warhorses required extensive training and were stallions, requiring special handling. He was armed with a lance and sword, carried a shield and was armored from head to (almost) toe. By the middle Medieval period, this meant a steel helmet with at least nasal protection and a ring mail coif under or a aventail hanging from it. It meant a ring mail hauberk, down to mittens on the arms, with an attached coif over the head and hanging down to mid-thigh. It could include ring-mail chaps or trousers covering the feet. At this point, vulnerable spots would be reinforced with steel (or hardened leather in the warmer climes of Spain and Italy) plates. Protection for the horse had become more common running from padded barding to ring mail with the improved power of missile weapons, which also drove the improvement in armor. Ring mail protected well from cutting, slashing and chopping weapons, but could be separated by the point of sword, spear, lance or arrow/bolt. Under the mail, a padded gambeson was worn, which made the hauberk more comfortable and protected against crushing weapons. The shield was made of planks, laid crossways like plywood and covered in leather. The shield was a necessary defense against swords, spears and arrows and an offensive weapon when used to punch and bash an opponent. The lance was the primary and the sword the secondary weapon of the knight.
The use of such weapons, the shield, the horse and the endurance to carry the weight of armor (40-70lbs distributed over the shoulders and hips) required long and intensive training which a knight received from his father, his older family members, his foster father and older knights of the household. Young noblemen were often, like Robert Baratheon and Ned Stark, sent to related or allied lords for fostering, ensuring they were well-cared for, but not spoiled during their youth and training. No one who had to labor at any tasks daily to plant, tend and harvest food or animal husbandry or a trade, such as a blacksmith, had the time for such training (or the wealth, in most cases to buy the horse, weapons and equipment). Mounted on a warhorse, heavily armored and armed, trained to war, the knight dominated other classes of Soldiers and warriors on and off the battlefield. When properly used in mass, they were unstoppable and the key to victory, the core of any feudal army.
Depending on the wealth of land and trade of a kingdom, it might be able to produce and support a knight for every hundred people. England in 1300 could mobilize 35,000 knights, but the lack of transportation infrastructure (the best roads in Europe were built by the Romans a thousand years earlier) meant that usually only the knights near the area of operations would be mobilized, which explains why English armies early in the Hundred Years War rarely had more than 5,000 knights and the armies on the border with Scotland rarely mustered more than 10,000.

Most Houses in the books are hilariously old;  The Starks, Lannisters and Tyrels are supposed to be 8,000+ years old.

Personally, I'm having trouble picturing a noble house lasting for more than a couple of centuries, at least if we use medieval history as an example. This is a death-trap world, more or less (just like the real middle ages), and we've seen people die like flies in the books. Hell, by the time of ADWD several Houses are on the verge of annihilation. 

Even if the historical accounts are WAY off, all the major houses would still be pretty damn old assuming that the events of ASOIAF prehistory actually had the time to take place.

My question to you guys is, do you think they will go for the early reveal, maybe in like an opening scene before the intro like they did with Cersei's prophecy and the Hound last season, in episodes 1 or 2. Or do you think they will drag it out, maybe throw some foreshadowing throughout the season like they did in S6 with Bran's flashbacks. I guess I don't see them waiting very long at all unless they maybe wait to pair it up with Jon meeting up with Dany (couldn't see this happening until later into the season because of how much material they have to cover/round up) so other than that I kind of see them revealing this to us early, and get it out of the way so non-book readers will get the picture.

A million ways they could do this but I think for sure we are in for some sort of Rhaegar reveal, it would be a shame not to show him, just because of the awesome character he is also the fact that the story basically is the way it is because of his actions at Harrenhall.

There has been a lot of debate on whether there is friction between the White Wolf and his half sister. I believe there is evidence that Sansa intends to become the head of House Stark. Therefore also Wardeness of the North and if she intends to claim the right of her brother's kingdom: the Queen in the North. Many point to two reasons why they suspect Sansa in betraying Jon. The first is that she did not reveal to Jon that Littlefinger is her true contact when she lets his council at Castle Black know that the Tullys have taken Riverrun. In this instance she is concealing her relationship with the former Master of Coin.

The Battle of the Bastards:
Here is Sansa's first evidence of trying to position herself as the only heir to Winterfell. She does not tell Jon that Lord Baelish spoke to her at Mole's Town because that would lead to a myriad of questions. Why is Littlefinger in the North? At Moat Cailin? Why? What allegiance do you have for him and why?

Most importantly, Jon would convince Sansa to get the Knights of the Vale north so the two armies could join and strategize a siege. This would allow Ramsay to gain knowledge and prepare for the attack. Winter is coming, and any delay could spell doom for an army besieging Winterfell (look at Stannis Baratheon in the fifth book). Sansa wants to win Winterfell quickly so she can establish herself as its lady and be able to protect herself for the first time ever.

Thus, she keeps it all a secret and lies to the council. Instead, she will allow Jon Snow and his wildings to lead the Stark army in the vanguard. A majority of the Bolton army will die from the attack and with any luck, Snow and his wilding allies die as well. This would eliminate the strife between wildings and loyal Northern lords. This would also remove Sansa's only rival to the seat of Winterfell. She has already marked Rickon for dead since Ramsay will not let a Stark live to rival his claim. Bran is also regarded dead since he was last seen heading north of the wall with little protection.

The Lady Sansa could have taken in the wilding women and children as wards in Winterfell in honor of the men who fought with her brother in the Battle for Winterfell. Many historical events in Westeros show that multiple claimants will lead to dispute and most likely bloodshed between family, such as the Dance of Dragons with King Aegon and Princess Rhanerya. Sansa Stark has learned to do what is best for her own personal safety and future.

It makes the most strategic sense for Sansa to take this route as it ensures her safety and establishes her as the most powerful figure north of Moat Cailin. Once the battle is won, she will have a mighty army of the Vale in a sense loyal to her through her cousin Robin and her step uncle Baslish, until she can have the Northern lords rally to her. She can manipulate Petyr Baelish, knowing that she is his weakness.

Sansa's Training 
Sansa Stark has been taught by a number of the best players of Game of Thrones. During her time in King's Landing, her tutelage includes names like Queen Cersei, Queen Margaery, Tyrion Lannister, the Queen of Thrones and of course, Littlefinger himself.

She is the most diplomatic and politically experienced person in the North, despite her age, and minus Lord Baelish. This knowledge will give her a considerable advantage among honorable northern lords and ladies. She is a Stark, but also knows how to lie like someone from King's Landing (see when she lied to the Vale lords to save Baelish.) She also knows how to beat Baelish, utilizing her powers as a woman (remember when Cersei told her that her most powerful weapon is in between her legs.) The combination of being taught by these two power players makes her into a formidable GOT player.

Jon Snow/Jon Sand/Jon Targaryan 
The second evidence of Sansa's mindset is the scene when Jon Snow is crowned the King in the North. The wilidings, the Vale and the North crown Jon as King, when it was Sansa's politics that allowed for the victory in the Battle for Winterfell. It seems as if Lyanna Mormont intends to declare for Sansa, but then she says ""I don't care if he's a bastard,"" and Sansa's smile disappears.
 
Throughout the entire scene she is never acknowledged as the savior of the battle. Then Littlefinger and her share a look that shows neither is happy with this new sequence of events. Sansa Stark is the true heir of Winterfell, even if Jon Snow was the bastard son of Eddard Stark. But he is not. In truth he is a Targaryen Great Bastard, the son of Prince Rhaegar and Lyanna Stark. He has no claim at all for the seat of Winterfell. This knowledge will become common, and it could possibly be Howland Reed or Bran who reveals the truth.

Sansa will be maneuvering herself with the aid of Littlefinger in Season 7 to claim the seat of House Stark. Sansa cannot be underestimated anymore. She is not following this course due to hate, jealousy or resentment. She follows it because it is the smartest and most calculated move she can make, that is what her King's Landing tutors showed her. 

I don't think the tension will ever escalate between Jon and Sansa, as the truth of his lineage will be explained. Then Jon will relinquish his claim to Robb's kingdom and Winterfell. Jon will take up his claim for the Iron Throne as the son of the last Targaryen prince. Sansa will still have to contend with Bran for the seat of Winterfell. But I think Bran will become something else in the Realm due to his abilities and inability to walk. Perhaps Jon's Hand, the new Master of Whisperers, or a maester.

However I did want to write this post to explain that Sansa is now a major player in game of thrones and should be given the credit she deserves. She is not evil or even the new modern age Littlefinger. She is actually more than that. She is educated, logical and strategic and she demonstrated that in Season 6.",10,0,False,self,,,,,

From what I see in the FAQs this is backwards from how most people do it, but I guess that just makes me either a really nerdy hipster or hipsterish nerd. I've read all five books, and because of my work and living situation, have very limited time for sitting down and watching hour-long episodes of a TV show, no matter how amazing the show is. I'm not averse to going back later and watching all of it, but my goal is to be able to talk with my friends who've seen all six seasons without worrying about spoilers, and to get there by watching the fewest eps possible.

I assume all of season six is new material and should be watched. But I know that a number of things diverge as well. I read that [TV](#s ""Sansa suffers Jeyne Poole's fate with Ramsay Snow/Bolton, Robb's wife is present and killed at the Red Wedding, much of the Dorne plot was cut in favor of an odd adventure in Dorne with Jaime and Bronn, and that Ser Barristan and Jojun Reed are killed"") but not much else. What, if any, episodes do I *need* to watch before watching season six? Again, regardless of how great all the seasons and episodes are, the goal here is the fewer, the better.

General, in the age range 40  55. Hes a senior military officer, and theyre looking for a white actor who uses the British RP accent. The actor is needed for the week of September 6th.
Priest, in his 60s. Hes a venerable priest with moral authority and gravitas. The show is seeking a white actor, using an RP accent, with characterful face for this part. Hes scheduled to shoot one week, from September 22nd.


Warrior, in the 35  45 age range. The character is a tough-looking bruiser with the attack skills of a pit bull, and the actor needs to be great at fighting. He has a considerable amount of dialogue as well. Its described as an excellent part for a top-end actor. Helpful clues in the description? We know its not a Dothraki character as the actor for the role is required to be white, and theyre asking for a neutral and non-posh English accent. This role is currently scheduled to shoot across October.


Gate Guard, in his 20s. The character is described as a Confident, characterful, straight-talking Northern lad with a great face to play across a very excellent series of scenes.  Theyre looking someone with wit, timing, and charisma. Hes currently scheduled to film between mid-October and mid-November.
City Guard, in his 30s. The show is casting for a city guard who intercepts a suspicious-looking person on his nightly patrol. They require an RP accent for this one. Hes set to shoot for a week in mid-October.


Merchant, in his 40s. The merchant appears at an inn during a busy evening. Theyre seeking a character actor, for a non-combatant role. His appearance is more open, including ethnicity/race. That suggests a character appearing somewhere in Essos- or a place weve never been before, since Daenerys is now on the move. This part is scheduled to shoot the first week of November.


Lovely Lady. Ah yes, what would Game of Thrones be without its courtesans and nudity. The show is casting for an attractive young courtesan who is sure of her own mind. Its described as a good speaking part and casting notes that full nudity is required for the role. Similar to the merchant, the lovely ladys physical appearance is open, indicating this role is for somewhere on Essos, or at a new location. Shes scheduled to shoot for one week in early October.
Young Lord, in his late 20s. Hes a tall, handsome young lord, and the show is looking for a white actor who uses the RP accent. Hes scheduled to shoot in the week commencing September 20th.


Lieutenant, in his 20s. The character is described as an athletic, physically fit, and disciplined warrior. Appearance-wise, theyre looking for someone not white, with Middle Eastern descent mentioned. This bears the hallmarks of a Dothraki character description. Hes set to shoot several days across three weeks, between mid-September and mid-November.",93,191,False,self,,,,,

Instead of being Ned's bastard, or Rhaegar's heir, Jon would be Daenery's bastard brother from rape of The Mad King. That would be a dark twist. 

What if the entire thing ends with the White Walkers exterminating all life in the world, except for a few remaining Starks and a few remaining Children of the Forrest. Wnterfell is protected by their magic and Bran is grown into roots of the last remaining Weirwood Tree in the world? What if Bran IS Bran The Builder, and goes into the past to the ""Age of Hero's"" and works with the COTF, but in this alternate timeline, betrays them before they are able create the WW?  In the past Bran has his legs and his ability to reproduce. He reboots the whole thing. 

I suppose it's a cliche time travel timeline twist kinda thing, but they did open that door with Bran getting Ned and Hodors attention in past timelines.

If these two parties had met on the street - they would have set into fighting.  Ned had just come from the Battle of the Trident where Robert killed Rheagar - the prince these men were sworn to protect.  They wanted to be in that battle - or protecting King's Landing.  Instead they were ordered to be protecting this tower and then up walks.. the enemy.   The rebels that were overthrowing the king they swore to protect - and a prominent leader among them.  They are polite - but they are sworn enemies.  One or the other party is going to die in the war at this hour and location. 

Further - though they were polite at the beginning - this was not a ""tournament duel"" this was warfare and open melee with unequal numbers.  So although it may have been ""more honorable"" for Howland Reed to announce his presence before stabbing Dayne in the back - he was not bound to stand by politely and watch Dayne kill his friend Ned Stark - and then wait for Dayne to turn  around, bow, and let Dayne finish killing him.  Ned did nothing dishonorable..  he was fighting for his life in combat - he survived and his opponent died. 

Also according to the books - if the other person defending the Tower of Joy was Gerold Hightower - he was the Lord Commander of the King's Guard.  He was the superior officer to Dayne.  But he accepted Rheagar's order to stay at the tower with Dayne.   But he was not the swordsman that Dayne was - nobody was.  So when the Northerners killed Hightower - they killed Jaime's boss and Hightower was not a King's Landing to stop the Kingslayer from his kingslaying. ",36,16,False,self,,,,,

I am currently re-watching season 3 and recently re-watched the scene where Varys tells Tyrion about the sorcerer who drugged him and cut off his johnson (Big Lebowski anyone?) for a blood magic ritual. His member was burned in a brazier (an old-timey stove, not a piece of women's underwear.)  
**When it was burned, Varys says, the flames turned BLUE, and a voice spoke back in response to the sorcerer's chants.** That's all we learn about his backstory in that scene. (plus he had the sorceror shipped to him free thanks to Amazon Prime, oh, and he has understandably hated magic ever since).  
Cut to Season 6. Varys has joined up with his old pal Tyrion in Meereen and they are holding down the fort while Khaleesi is out running errands (picking up some new armies, taking over the entire Dothraki civilization, no big). In an effort to stabilize the revolting city, the two most awesome people on Planetos pay a visit to Meereen's top Red Priestess. When confronted by a skeptical Varys, she says to him, ""Everyone is what they are and where they are for a reason. Terrible things happen for a reason. Take what happened to you, lord Varys, when you were a child. If not for your mutilation at the hand of a second rate sorcerer you wouldn't be here helping the lord's chosen bring the light into the world. Knowledge has made you powerful; but there is still so much you don't know. Do you remember what you heard that night? When the sorcerer tossed your parts in the fire? **You heard a voice call out from the flames, do you remember? Should I tell you what the voice said? Should I tell you the name of the one who spoke? We serve the same queen; if you are her true friend you have nothing to fear from me.""**  
So.... what the hell is going on with the voice and the blue flames?!?!

We've been shown history more or less repeating itself in a few instances during the events of the show/book and with the theories of the wall coming down when the white walkers invade, what if Bran is Bran the builder and is destined to rebuild the wall and winterfell in the aftermath of the invasion? 

Not only this, but during Bran's experience with the Weirwood network, what if he learns a terrible truth in that there must always be a Nights King, and the one to take up the mantle must be a stark, and an incredibly powerful warg.  This would not be unlike a circle of life scenario in that the white walkers are needed for new life to develop (almost like the reapers in mass effect)

So Bran is destined to rebuild the wall, rebuild winterfell and ultimately become the new nights king.  

But wait, there's more.

One of the first scenes we see is Lord Eddard Stark beheading a deserter of the Nights Watch with none other than Jon Snow and Bran standing next to each other watching it happen. Let me remind you guys what was said 

Jon Snow: ""Don't look away, father will know if you do""

Eddard Stark: ""Bran, do you know why I had to do that?""

Bran Stark: ""Our ways the old way""

Eddard Stark: ""He who passes the sentence should swing the sword"" 

I believe that the story will end how it started, with Jon Snow learning of what Bran is destined to do and Bran offering himself to die in order to stop the White walkers once and for all.  Jon will reluctantly agree and opt to behead Bran (possibly with Lightbringer or a reforged Ice if you like) because it has to be Jon.
But as Jon's about to do this, we trace back to this conversation between the two in the first episode except the other way around with Bran telling Jon to not look away, because father will know if he does.

As the sword falls everything is silent, but in the distance we see the sun start to rise, signalling the end of winter and your bittersweet ending.

I, along with the majority of you all, are expecting a battle between humanity and the white walkers in Season 7. And while that does seem predictable (which is another aspect I take slight issue with), this plot doesn't fit with the tone, message, and overall basis of the story itself.

George RR Martin fought in the Vietnam War and his novels are very much anti-war. The books made a point of how terrible war was and is in Westeros. From multiple points of view, we see how war is terrible, makes monsters of men, and causes nothing but chaos, fear, and suffering. The siege of Mereen, Robb Stark's campaign, Arya's chapters at Harrenhal, the siege of Riverrun, and even recalls to Robert's Rebellion expand on war and its terrible repercussions upon Westeros and the people. The message of the story is clearly set on revealing that war is terrible and ultimately causes nothing but pain and agony. 

And this is exactly why I am absolutely against the idea of a humanity-white walker war in season 7. The white walkers have been portrayed as this unstoppable unnatural evil force, which is exactly what George RR Martin has stated he actively avoids in writing his novels. He takes criticism with stories like Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Star Wars, and all the other blockbusters for having a story that is all about the battle between good and evil. George RR Martin said that he doesn't want any of that and he likes his stories as close to the real world as possible by having complexity within characters.

So why is it that there is an upcoming battle between good men (Jon, Sansa, and loyal bannermen) against evil creatures as the white walkers? This is particularly frustrating because I feel like the show is losing its purpose to audience and I can only hope that this won't be the case for next Season 7. But those are only my thoughts on the issue.

TL;DR: A Song of Ice and Fire is an anti-war story, and with the story headed towards a battle against humanity and the white walkers, it feels as if it contradicts the message ASOIAF held to the audience since the beginning.",30,3,False,self,,,,,

I can see it being an awkward scenario. There won't be any true clash, neither want to take the power from the other... But I wouldn't mind betting is something that Littlefinger will try to manipulate.

I decided to withhold judgment for more than a year until these scenes picked up again at the beginning of S6, but frankly, I never felt that any of the points I'm about to list here were answered in a satisfactory way. Perhaps there are others out there who share these concerns, or perhaps I'm totally missing the mark on a lot of this! Either way, I'm curious to read your responses. :) 

**Oddity #1: Why would Brienne be surprised that Stannis is moving toward Winterfell?**

When Podrick first spots Stannis's advancing army and reports this to Brienne, she is initially skeptical, and only believes his claim when he reminds her that he fought at Blackwater, and was thus very familiar with the design of Stannis's 'Flaming Heart' banners.

Podrick's near-encyclopedic knowledge of Westerosi sigil designs is all well and good, (recall his correctly identifying a number of Dornish banners as he, Tyrion and Bronn awaited the arrival of the Martell delegation to Joffrey's wedding) but what other candidate(s) *besides* Stannis would Brienne think might be leading an army toward Winterfell from the North?

It should be noted that Stannis was not trying to sneak up on the Boltons by any means; on the contrary, this was to be the beginning of a very high-profile comeback attempt, and Stannis's larger intentions for his Northern campaign were common knowledge as far south as King's Landing. One might argue, *'well, Brienne doesn't have access to informants the way Cersei or Littlefinger does.'* Fair enough. But consider that Brienne presumably had her eyes glued on Winterfell for quite literally weeks on end. It wouldn't have been difficult to determine, for instance, that Bolton-occupied Winterfell was bracing itself for a siege. And Stannis had already sent ravens to various houses across the North to appeal for support, with limited success. Between observations and rumors, it shouldn't have been too difficult to put the pieces together, and conclude that if anyone was on the march, it was probably Stannis Baratheon.

**Oddity #2: What was the lighting the candle in the tower supposed to signal aside from Sansa actually being in Winterfell? And shouldn't Brienne and Pod have known that already?**

If the old woman who first tells Sansa about the candlelight signal had already made some contact with Brienne, then couldn't she have just passed along some confirmation to her that, yes, Sansa Stark was a *de facto* hostage of the Boltons inside Winterfell? Again, much like Stannis's ambitions following his rout of Mance Rayder's army, Sansa's marriage to Ramsay was by no means a low-profile affair. On the contrary, Roose understood the symbolic value of having a member of House Stark (the previous Wardens of the North) marry into his own House Bolton, (the more recent Wardens of the North, following their betrayal of the Starks and alliance with House Lannister) and would be sure to spread the word of this marriage far and wide across the North. Again, this is something that Brienne and Pod likely would have heard about at some point, and possibly would have served as all the confirmation they needed that Sansa, whom they hoped to rescue, was within the walls of Winterfell.

It would be one thing if Sansa lighting the candle was meant to signal the beginning of a more sophisticated plan to get her out of there, possibly involving some sort of clandestine escape route, with sympathizers on hand to secure her escape. But there's no indication that this is the case; even if Brienne and Pod had stayed behind for an extra 30 seconds and spotted the candle, it's unclear what their next step would have been.

Even having Pod deliver his line less like, *'Hey Brienne, Stannis is coming! Just figured I'd let you know, since you mentioned wanting to knock him off when we were talking a few weeks back,'* and more like, *'Hey Brienne, Stannis is coming! Now's our chance, let's try and infiltrate Winterfell while they're busy fighting,'* would have been a major improvement, as it would imply some real potential consequences for Brienne opting to take this detour. It also would have made sense for Pod to be more adamant about focusing on Sansa, (whom he knew at least in passing from his time as Tyrion's squire) and less interested in going after Stannis, since unlike Brienne, he didn't have much of a personal stake there.

**Oddity #3: Where exactly was Podrick when Brienne confronted a wounded Stannis in the Wolfswood?** 

Podrick's instinct seems to be remaining at Brienne's side whenever possible, often to her annoyance. But he's mysteriously absent from the frame when Brienne encounters Stannis. At the time, this led some to speculate that Pod might have intervened somehow to prevent Brienne from killing Stannis, as neither the killing blow nor Stannis's corpse was directly shown on screen. However, I think we can now say with about 99.99% certainty that this wasn't the case. 

In the S6 premiere, Pod is once again at Brienne's side as they fight off the Bolton hunters sent after Sansa and Theon, without explanation of how and/or when they reunited.

Of course, one could certainly argue that having Podrick in the Brienne-Stannis scene would have been pointless, considering that he had no real stake in Renly's assassination. Fair enough, but arguing 'narrative sense' here doesn't automatically make up for the lack of 'logical sense.'

Once again, this seems like it would have been an easy enough fix: have a disillusioned Podrick go ahead of Brienne in pursuit of Sansa, and briefly engage the Bolton hunters before she arrives on the scene. Without saying one word, it would have emphasized that Brienne's detour to finish Stannis, while not ultimately fatal for Sansa, Theon, or Pod, nonetheless *could* very well have compromised her goal of fulfilling her oath to Catelyn to protect her daughters. No 'mea culpa' on Brienne's part needed; one knowing look between she and her squire would have said all that needed to be said.",3,0,False,self,,,,,

For starters, Joanna Lannister came into contact with King Aerys at her wedding and at a tourney in KL. It has been confirmed in A World of Ice and Fire that Aerys and Joanna took ""unwanted privileges"" on her Wedding night, while there is no evidence that anything happened at the tourney.

On top of that, Aegon the Conquerer created the iron throne to be uncomfortable, so no one would never sit easily.  Jaime sat on the throne after he killed Aerys and Cersei sat on it during the Battle of Blackwater. Tyrion never sat on it, even when he was Hand of the King.

Then there's all the kings that were weak or crazy, just like Joffrey and Tommen, and of course Jaime and Cersei doing incest. Tyrion may be a strange twisted looking dwarf, but there are no accounts of any Targaryen being born like that.

Lastly there is the first ever Lannister, Lans the Clever. At their roots Lannisters are not strong, rich, or powerful.  Lannisters are Clever. And Tyrion is the only child of Joanna that is Clever.

For Tyrions evidence of being a Targaryen we have his dreams of dragons. Which he dreamt after his uncle told him a bunch of stories about dragons.

Then there are the times when his father says ""You are no son of mine"", which he also says to Jaime, so I think thats just Tywin's fatherly love.

Other than that we have Tyrion's black eye which may or may not be purple.

There's also chances that all 3 of them are Targs or none at all.

I'm not saying that this theory is right,  I'm just don't like how people seem to assume that Tyrion is a Targaryen. He very well might be, but other theories like this are very likely as well.

TL;DR: There is more evidence that Cersei and Jaime are Targaryens(half) than Tyrion. ",7,0,False,self,,,,,

It was badly executed. But I still think the events can be explained to be plausible. This is from a comment I wrote in a different thread. Sorry for all the errors, I wrote this on my phone.


**CONTEXTUAL BACKGROUND**

During Robert's Rebellion, Dorne fought on the side of the Targaryen. Prince Lewyn Martell, Oberyn's uncle, who was part of the Kingsguard, led the Dornish spears along side Rhaegar at the Trident where they lost. Presumably a lot of Dornish lords and knights perished and the Dornish have been nursing a grudge ever since, one compounded by the fate of Princess Elia and her children. When the Lannisters presented their bodies to the King wrapped in Lannister cloaks, Robert Baratheon was pleased. Ned Stark was outraged at the brutal murder but Robert merely said ""I see no dead, only dragonspawn.

Of course, all of this was started because Rhaegar humiliated and abandoned his Dornish wife to run off with 15 year old Lyanna Stark.

**THE NOW**

So the Dornish were basically shat on by all sides of the conflict. They have been politicaly isolated for the last 20-ish years. What has Prince Doran really been doing? Quietly plotting ""something"" while slowly becoming a weak cripple? At least in the books, Quentyn Martell, Trystane's older brother, was sent to Daenerys on a hidden mission to get her support.
In the show, there's only Trystane Martell... Who Doran betroths to the daughter of Robert Baratheon and granddaughter of Tywin Lannister. Doran, who should be thirsting for justice, could presumably have chosen to have betrothed the future ruling Prince Trystane to a number Dornish women, but chose instead to betroth him to the spawn of Dorne's greatest enemies. Why would they accept a person like her as their future Princess?

Later on, when the Red Viper, the very essence of Dornish manly ideals, goes to King's Landing and dies fighting as the champion of Tyrion Lannister in an attempt to force Gregor Clegane to confess that he killed on Tywin's orders, Doran washes  once again just takes it and washes his hands of Oberyn. And Trystane... Well, that weak ponce is too caught up with his golden haired betrothed to care. He's in bed with the enemies.

Ellaria said it herself, Dorne thinks Doran is weak. Oberyn was at least trying to do something. Should they continue to follow Doran or should they throw their lot with Oberyn's paramour and his bastard daughters? Bastards can be legitimised and daughters are free to inherit and rule in Dorne. Ellaria was Oberyn's wife in all but name, considering the sheer amount of time they had been together (15 years?), and the amount of bastards he fathered off of her.

Obviously, Doran and Oberyn worked together to keep the people of Dorne loyal to House Martell, making a great duo of brawn and brains. But without Oberyn and a united House Martell, who would the people turn to?

**So where did they fail?**

Well, the show failed to show all of this in the background. They should have shown Ellaria working in the background to win over Doran's guards, using her association with Oberyn to rile them up. Even a passionate speech in front of a hall of Dornish highborn would have been enough, or Obara holding a rallying speech in front of the household guards. Or how about a disgruntled anti-Lannister conversation overheard by Jaime and Bronn?~~~~

Oberyn Martell was portrayed wonderfully IMO, and I actually like him more in the show than in the book. Aero's death was disappointing but that's just the GoT way. Trystane's death actually just shows how unsuited he was to rule Dorne.",16,18,False,self,,,,,

Here are some steps for how this might happen.

*1)* Arya is currently (in the show) at The Twins, she is likely to travel North from there - she may come across the Brotherhood Without Banners, of which The Hound has joined.

*2)* Sandor is part of the Brotherhood, it is a possibility that they will train Sandor to be faster. The fight between the Red Viper (Oberyn) and The Mountain (Gregor) as well as Tyrion's talk with Bronn made it perfectly clear that the only way to beat Gregor is to be faster than him. This'll definitely make... a certain 'bowling' session more exciting.

*3)* If Sandor is 'reborn' in some form of grace of god or gets called 'little brother' within the brotherhood because he is the newest recruit or something along those lines (yeah it is very unlikely), then Sandor is a candidate for un-aliving Cersei in the books. In the show, Sandor is a 'brother', so he can kill Cersei, which Sandor might be inclined to do for bringing Gregor from the dead.

*4)* Thoros of Myr and Beric Dondarrion are in the Brotherhood with Sandor, in season 1, Beric Dondarrion was commanded to bring justice (kill) Gregor Clegane by Ned Stark, which pretty much confirms that Sandor will be coming along for Gregor for some juicy bowling.

*5)* This is unlikely but Beric &amp; Thoros were on Arya's list, perhaps Arya could try do kill them at some point? That might result in Beric telling Sandor to kill Gregor in Beric's dying moments or something. This is incredibly unlikely, but possible still?

*6)* The Mountain goes North and/or the Brotherhood goes South and the [brothers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o72FGjCgUX8) meet, most likely the Brotherhood ends up in King's Landing or something. Perhaps if there is another trial by combat, Sandor might take the opportunity. Perhaps Dany takes King's Landing and wants Cersei executed, however Tyrion begs her not to execute Cersei, forcing Dany to compromise with a trial by combat, which Cersei will probably allow again now she is Queen.

*7)* Get Hype

*8)* Sandor kills Gregor and potentially could die from injuries from the fight afterwards or something like that or might just survive.

But it won't be murder, only justice"". 

I can't get Thoros' prophecy of The Hound out of my head. Listen, I like The Hound as much as the next guy, but him getting axed off by a girl (no disrespect to Brianne) was absolute poetic justice. And just like that, I thought we had gone full circle, &amp; The Hound's fate had been determined justly.  Until the reveal that he was still alive, I thought ""only justice"" meant he had to pay for the sins he committed while in King's Landing with his life. 

Since this past season with Sandor ""redeeming"" himself in a way, I think Thoros' prediction has a completely new meaning that I'd hadn't seen previously. Maybe the ""justice"" served when Sandor dies doesn't really apply to himself at all. Maybe his true purpose this whole time has been to bring justice to others that have wronged the innocent of the realms.  Does ""only justice"" apply to The Hounds' eventual death, or does The Hound serve up some kidney pie justice (&amp; die in the process) to a person that truly, truly deserves it? (THE MOUNTAIN!)

Sorry for the rant and kind of being all over the place with this theory. It just seems like the Red Priestesses &amp; Priests visions come true, but not in the way that they were originally envisioned (ex: Melisandre seeing the Bolton banners burning, but not realizing that it was due to Jon &amp; not Stannis... RIP). I always thought Thoros' vision had a purpose, but now I think the vision had a much deeper meaning then Thoros, The Hound, &amp; ourselves could ever really see. ",18,13,False,self,,,,,

**Strategy**

Strategically, backing the Lannisters puts Baelish on the losing side of the war.  It means Renly, Stannis, and Robb all end up against him.  Although the Lannisters end up getting ahead, that's largely due to one of the least foreseeable events in the series, i.e. Melisandre's shadow driving the Tyrells to the Lannister camp.  The situation was looking very grim for King's Landing up until that point, so it doesn't really makes sense for Baelish to choose to back Joffrey from a survival perspective.

Backing Ned would have led to war with the Lannister and Renly camp, but the North, the Riverlands, and a minor portion of the Stormlands would have been united.  Given that it's Baelish, the Vale could be persuaded to support Ned, too.  With Renly and the Lannisters unlikely to join forces, that combination would be more than sufficient to hold the throne.

**Politics**

Ned is very honorable.  That's not something Baelish has to admire, but it does make Ned predictable.  And predictability makes it easier for Baelish to plan his intrigue and generally manipulate politics.  Stannis, similarly, is very dutiful, another trait that's rather predictable (except where Melisandre is involved).  Joffrey is arguably more predictable (for his sadist qualities), but he's not the only Lannister that Baelish's actions forces himself to deal with, and Cersei, Tywin, Tyrion, etc. seem to be better at intrigue and therefore more difficult to deal with.

**Ingratiating himself to the Starks**

There's no way Catelyn would have ever loved him after he turned on Ned in such a public way.  The exchange between him and Catelyn in Renly's camp had a out-of-character level of desperation.  It seems like he's settling for Sansa now.  

In a world where Ned succeeded in holding the throne until Stannis arrived, he likely would have continued serving as Hand, giving Baelish plenty of opportunities to have Ned killed discretely.  He also tried quite a bit to make Ned go with his original plan of staying alive and backing Joffrey, so he doesn't seem to be driven by a single-minded jealousy toward Ned.",45,28,False,self,,,,,

Granted some things in this theory are a stretch, but this could possibly be how a major battle plays out in Season 7.


We all know Dany has a massive army and seems unstoppable, but I think there may be a way for her to lose the Battle for King's Landing with the pieces we already know about. (and by lose I mean win but at a great cost)


First let's break down what Dany really has right now. Daario said in Season 6 that they would need a 1000 ships to sail to Westeros. So since Daario knows a good bit about war, let's assume he is spot on with that and Dany is now sailing with a 1000 ships. She also has three dragons. That's it right now because all of the factions she commands are on ships and honestly most of them probably don't know a thing about sailing. So in all honesty, in the water, her army is somewhat vulnerable except for the dragons and Ironborn.


Now, let's say through the power of TV magic Euron somehow is able to actually raise a 1000 ships and enough men to sail them. This would suddenly give him one of the largest armies in Westeros, and could easily make him an attractive ally with Cercei who will be in need of allies. So let's skip the how/when here and let's assume they get married or are at least allies. So if Dany sails into King's Landing she could suddenly be facing a 1000 Ironborn ships being manned by more skilled crews as a whole and would suddenly be at a disadvantage. No problem, cause dragons, right? Well let's assume one more thing which is Euron having the dragonbinder. If he has this he could either take down a dragon or turn one of them on the others. So let's go with him controlling one and attacking the others. This would suddenly take at least two dragons out of the equation while they are fighting. Suddenly, we have a pretty even fight on our hands where both sides take mass casualties.


I'm not saying any of this will happen, I'm just pointing out that Dany's massive army may not be as unstoppable as everyone thinks given certain circumstances happening. Just something interesting I thought about. Thoughts?",7,4,False,self,,,,,

I would like to discuss the possible strategies and alliances to come. And NO, I dont think Daenerys will become the Mad Queen; we already have Cersei and it would be simply stupid at this point, with the white walkers menace approaching, to have a new villain...

1) Dorne as starting point: Remember her speech to the Khalasar? It is my believe that Daenerys will want to submit the nobles of the disputed regions before heading to Kings Landing, in a pincer movement designed to isolate Cersei even more. Notice I said nobles. She was pretty clear that she wanted her bloodriders to attack the castles and knights in open battle. Tyrion convinced her it is stupid to lay waste to everything and her goal is to rule the land. 

Therefore I think she will use the Dothraki to submit the Stormlands. This make sense as they could cross the borders to the Stormlands by horse under the supervision of dornish general, who are more familiar with the region after all. 

2) Euron will strike The Reach and Oldtown: It is unclear at which point Queen Cersei will align herself to Euron, but this is sure to come, as she will seek revenche against the Sands and Olenna. Daenerys will be forced to engage in naval battle in order to protect her west coast allies. The Tyrell and Iron Born fleet will face Euron with the Unsullied possibly marching the region to prevent any  land attacks from Cerseis forces.

3) Remember, Cersei still controls the Westerlands and the Crownlands; nominally she also has The Stormlands and the Riverlands: There is no doubt in my mind that Daenerys will subdue the Stormlands with ease and she will eventually defeat Euron, but at a high cost. She will regroup in the region south of the Riverlands and have Tyrion march the Westerlands and take Casterly Rock.
At this point, Cersei will start to get desperate.

4) The Ice and Fire Alliance: King Jon Snow will be busy prepping for the real menace and he will be neutral, in spite of his advisors pleas. Most possibly toward the middle of the season,  Littlefinger will try to manouvre the  Knights of the Vale to his advantage again: something like "" we need to head to the Eyrie and protect Sweetrobin from the dragons"". The North forces are close to exaustion and without the Vale, Jon Snow must seek an alliance with Dany. Tyrion will broke the deal and Littlefinger, once again, will try to exert influence and ""offer"" Harrenhal as the place where both forces can converge and a marriage take place.

5) Littlefinger will persist in trying to gain Sansa to his side: From his point of view, Danys invasion will be an opportunity to get rid of Jon Snow, Cersei and the new queen. I am not sure how he will play his cards, but his new endgame  is to have Sansa inherit the North from Jon Snow and to convince the northern houses and the Vale to invade Kings Landing. Of course he will lose it all before he has time to betray Jon Snow and eliminate Dany.
Now the fangirl in me really wants Dany to recreate Visenyas conquering of the Vale, flying straight to the Eyrie and offering Sweetrobin a ride on Drogon, neutralizing Littlefingers influence over the boy. 

6) The moment Dany and Jon are wed is going to push Cersei over the edge: I see the Ice and Fire couple sharing just one night together, with Jon heading North again, possibly with the Unsullied, and Dany planing on meeting the Dothraki at Kings Landing to invade the city. But she will arrive and realise Cersei destroyed the city and fullfil her House of the Undying vision. 

7) The season will end with Daenerys heading North with her dragons and the wall coming down. 

And now I take off my tinfoil hat....

Honestly, this is how I imagine things will play out, maybe I am wrong, but we will only get to see it next year.",17,0,False,self,,,,,

Cercei, upon losing the upcoming war against Dany will attempt to ignite the rest of the wildfire under kings landing only for Jaime to have to repeat his actions against the mad King. Though Dany's vision in the house of the undying seems to indicate that he fails to prevent her from carrying out the deed. 

Another theory I've been mulling over is Arya. She is currently in the Riverlands and although she says that she is heading to Winterfell, a couple of unforeseen meetings might derail that plan and cause her to go south. Who will she meet? 

There are two characters in the Riverlands that I would like to see Arya re-United with. The first is Nymeria. Arya's long lost dire-wolf is currently leading a pack of man-eating wolves over a hundred strong. This puts an army of wolves in the hands of westeros' deadliest assassin. I don't see how this will play into her role as Cercei's assassin but it's still too cool of a thought to just dismiss. 

The other character nearby is Sandor Clegane. He has begun a path of redemption closely tied in to the sparrows and the faith of the seven. When a few dozen innocent followers are slain he takes up his axe and avenges their deaths. How will he feel when he hears that Cercei has just slain hundreds, if not thousands, of innocent sparrows (as well as the high sparrow himself). Something tells me he's gonna find himself a bigger axe. 

Arya and Sandor where the surprise hit pairing on the show (their adventures were largely a show thing, not featuring much in the books) who wouldn't like to see more. 

Also lets not forget when Melissandra met with Arya she told her ""I see blue eyes, brown eyes, green eyes. Eyes that you'll close forever"" it's a paraphrase but I believe the green eyes is a foreshadow of Cercei (who in the books at least is repeatedly referred to a green-eyed. 

This would also give us our long-anticipated Cleganebowl!!!! 

Perhaps Arya kills Cercei while ""wearing"" the face of Jaime. Meanwhile Sandor is fighting Gregor to keep him from protecting his queen while outside Lannister guards are being distracted by an army of wolves. 

This went on longer than I thought but it's fun to speculate. Let me know what you think. Where did I go wrong? What could add to/detract from my guesses. ",97,29,False,self,,,,,

I seem to recall her being approached about the subject, but dismissing it because no one liked Stannis (more or less).

If this were the case the series would be better named A war of ice and fire. 

To me the word 'song' in the title is a clue of the outcome that we are all awaiting. Song suggests harmony rather than conflict. 

GRRM's central theme throughout the series has been that war, even for a just cause, is horrible. It is always the innocent who suffer most. Perhaps after seven books of war and violence he will end the series on a note of peace. 

There are several clues throughout the series that this might be where this is going. The night-watch's history seems to strongly suggest that the last war with the White walkers ended in some kind of truce. It is even suggested that the walkers might have been involved in the construction of the wall, alongside the first Bran Stark (possible foreshadowing).

Maybe Drogon will ignite the wild-fire beneath King's Landing and the city will be destroyed. Dany will see her vision from the house of the undying come to fruition. She will stand in the burnt remains of the throne room and see that she has become more like her father than like Aegon the conqueror. 

Seeing what war has done to her, she will fly north to broker a peace with the walkers and end the long night. ",11,1,False,self,,,,,

They had many years to get to Mance's forces before Stannis got to them at the wall. They were at the Fist and Hardhome and were unstoppable - and FAST. So while we all wait for Winter, they should have already wiped out every humanoid being North of the Wall. Even assuming the wall is full proof, they and their entire army should have been ready to go by the end of the book one or two tops. They should have just been milling around by the Wall out of fire range probing and waiting for winter for the last three books. Instead, they let Stannis come in and burn countless new wight bodies before they could get to them, let alone the few thousands that they let get south of the wall. Just poor leadership on the WW part (or plot armor for Westeros).

Possible ideas: 

* They were farming new WWs (aka Others) from people like Craster. But then, why not just capture them all, let some live to force them to farm babies for you while in captivity? Believe me, Westeros has done worse, the captives would do it.
* Maybe GRRM is out of his element on zombie logistics? Dragons need time to grow, not Zombies. Outbreaks take months not years. 
* Something else?

Though some of these free men had wealth enough to own a horse and served as light cavalry, as scouts or as raiders, in the manner of the ""Border Reivers"" along the English-Scots marches. Such light cavalry would have a large pony or light horse, a spear, helmet and shield and scout and screen for an army, though as small family groups usually, and not as efficiently as light cavalry will become by the 19th century, but enough that an army commander wasn't usually surprised by an enemy and had some situational awareness for a day's ride around him. Remember, this is time without radios and telegraph. Even before semaphores or heliographs. The use of lanterns or fire baskets or flags did exist, but only to transfer simple messages, like ""the bad guys are here!"". The primary communications system was the mounted rider, carrying a written or oral message. In general a written message better communicated the information needed or desired and the tasks to be performed. It also could be intercepted and translated as necessary. An oral message was faster, but ran the risks of inaccuracy in communicating, though more secure unless the message was tortured out of the messenger, though this then gave the opportunity for misinformation. An ancient tradition of the Assassins was of one who killed twelve men with one blow of a knife. The Assassin killed a chief advisor to a king, allowed himself to be captured and when tortured, gave the details of a non-existent plot against the King, naming eleven men most valuable for their competence and loyalty, all of whom were condemned and executed. A simple cypher code was used in the Middle Ages, but the other problems were the lack of literacy in the Middle Ages, the reliance on educated (sometimes barely literate) religious clerks (Maesters? Septas?) and variety of dialects which demanded the use of Latin or Greek as a common language. Then there was the physical dangers of travel in a land with a disrupted society filled with brigands, deserters, insurgents and angry peasants. Sometimes a messenger could be given an escort, hopefully large enough. Horses got sick, stumbled and broke legs, mired down in mud and bogs, got swept away at fords. Messengers took their time, went around not through dangerous areas, stopped for meals and sleep and entertainment. A dedicated mounted messenger could make twenty miles a day easily, up to fifty miles a day with effort, and with a change of horses every second day, since such a pace would kill a horse. Birds, like pigeons or ravens (GoT) could be used to carry messages. The problem there was the brevity of such a message, the chance of the bird going awry and the popularity of falconry among the nobles of the Middle Ages (we haven't seen this in GoT) which allowed a form of communications jamming by destroying the message bird, which also created the prospect of the bird's message being intercepted.
Battlefield communications, again sans radio, meant using the sound of drums, horns, rattles, whistles, voice and standards. In this case, we are not talking the well trained infantry maneuvering by the sound of drum commands or of cavalry drilling in silence with only bugles that became common in the 18th century. Only simple commands could be communicated by sound and then only over a limited range, even without the sounds of battle. This is why battlefield formations remained dense through WW1, since the only way to communicate by voice with a couple hundred troops was to pack them in around the guy giving the commands. As far as an army commander exercising command of his army, usually split into at least three elements, his best bet was mounted messengers. Which takes us back to all the problems outlined above. This is why a commander, especially one on the offensive, could be found fighting in the frontlines. Once he gave his orders at the beginning of a battle, there was little he could do to influence events unless he had a disciplined enough force he could hold under his hand as a reserve to commit at the right time. Even the Eastern Romans (Byzantines) with some of the best trained and disciplined armies of the time, faced the problem, which is why generals like Belisarius had a large personal guard paid out of his pocket and loyal to him that allowed him some flexibility in committing his forces to battle.
Getting back to the original subject, such free men would often own their land of themselves, but they would still owe political and financial obligations to the local nobleman through their villages and regional political systems. Certainly, as free men, they owed obligation to the King or Lord in time of invasion. By proclamation, they would normally be armed with a pole arm, spear, bill, halberd, etc, a helmet and a shield. They would have some simple body armor, such as a heavy buffalo hide coat or a jacket of heavy cloth, stuffed with unspun thread or even straw, which could provide protection from blunt weapons and arrows at long range. An example of such men are the free men on both sides of the border of the English and Scottish clashes. The Scots were Low Land Scots, called by their lords to war, their lords being Scots-Irish, from the conquerors over the Picts or Norman-Scots, imported by the Scottish kings as their allies against the Scottish nobility. They would be armed with spears and marshaled in deep formations, schiltrons, which were impervious to English mounted knights and men-at-arms. Their nemesis, Welsh and English yeomen, armed with spears for the Welsh and bills for the English and with the longbow. The self bow made of a single stave of wood had long fallen out of favor as a war weapon, not having the range and penetration needed against armored foes (though it was an arrow from such a bow that pierced King Haraald's eye at Hastings). The longbow was thicker and spanned the length of a man's outstretched arms. War bows could generate a 140 pound pull. They could go to four hundred yards and penetrate light armor through body and horse and at 100 yards, punch right through mail. At 50 yards, a longbow would go through shield and hauberk (it made for nice TV, but by at least the third arrow, Ramsey would have put one through the shield into Jon. Also each arrow should have gone deeper past the shield as the range diminished). When the English and Scots met after 1300, if the Scots didn't find a way to neutralize the English bowmen, they lost. The English archers would shred their formations and the English knights and men-at-arms would charge into the gaps and break open the formations and then the pursuit was on. It was a verity that an army took far worse casualties when pursued across and off the battlefield then when it stood and fought. Interestingly, the Wildlings in GoT seem to be armed with simple bows and long bows, but also with compound recurve bows that would rarely be seen outside of those areas of Europe exposed to the Arabs, Turks or horse nomad barbarians. As I said before, by 1400, the English archer had become a dragoon, riding to battle and fighting on foot. Other examples would be the light infantry (the Catalonians who formed the ""White Company"") and cavalry (genietes from Spain, stradiots from Albania) from the marches and from the mountains and forests. 
Some such freemen found their way into service with Kings and Lords, in a system called ""livery and maintenance"", where a freeman was given clothing, usually of the family colors or with their sigil prominently displayed and subsistence and housing at the expense of the king or lord, such as the Yeomen of the Guard, a major change in a feudal society divided by classes based on political power being linked to the right to 'bear arms"". The thought that freemen, other than knights, would perform the fulltime duties of Soldier for a King or Lord as (or more) efficiently as a noble was among the concepts that begin to break apart feudal society. Such freemen also came without the family or blood ties a noble knight brought (think Jamie Lannister as a King's Guard).
Another source of such forces, some cavalry, but usually pole-armed infantry or crossbowmen, was the city militias. These militias were usually formed around the guilds, such as in London, though by the 16th century, they were reorganized around the city's ""quarters"". The backbone of the Flemish army at Coutrai in the 14th century and many an Italian city-state of the 9th through 15th centuries were the city militias. Such militias existed in cities from Spain to France to the Germanies. The militias might have a small command and training group of professionals, but a formation like the ""City Watch"" in King's Landing was very rare in a feudal society. London did not have a fulltime security force until the mid-19th century, though both Athens and Rome and Constantinople did so. The city militia served usually under the mayor with the guild leadership for officers and usually under the terms of their charter from the king or Emperor. It was an alliance between the clans and cities that created the Swiss armies that humbled Charles the Bold. 
Which is another source, free men who owe no allegiance besides what the contracted between themselves and the political structures around them. The Highlanders (it must be said here that the Highlanders had a very poor reputation among the English and the Scots because of their unreliability, ill-discipline and obsolete weapons and armor when serving outside their native lands) and the Swiss are examples. Such people eventually became incorporated into a political entity and often became mercenaries. The warriors serve the Clan chiefs and their family groups when needed or they decided the need. An unpopular clan chief could call the muster and get few takers. Clan chiefs lead by tradition, custom, but mostly by charisma. The clans would muster by family with whatever weapons and armor they had, often, like with the Swiss nothing but a helmet and a halberd. The first Swiss victory over the better armed, armored, disciplined and trained Burgundians came with an ambush by the clans on a heavily wooded, mountain trail. On the open field, the Highlanders and Swiss would have been easy meat for a mounted forces even a tenth of their numbers. When the Swiss moved into the open, however, they had made and alliance with the cities, like Bern and Geneva, and they traded most of their halberds for pikes and crossbows and maneuvered in large, tight formations which the mounted knights couldn't penetrate, while the crossbowmen countered, to some extent, the English longbowmen in Burgundian employ. It would seem the Wildlings are much like these clans armies, and south of the Wall, invulnerable on their home ground (against live humans, that is), but in the open, the better armed and armored, mounted men-at-arms of the Night's Watch (before it atrophied from lack of threat) and bannermen and man-at-arms of the North, supported by freemen bowmen and spearmen would simply have ridden them down. Certainly like the Highlanders and Swiss, the Wildlings would be too poor for much in the way of weapons and armor, but you would still think that even the poorest warrior would have a spear, shield and helmet or helmet and bow. And leaders like Thormund Giantsbane would have more armor, like a Highland or Irish clan chieftain, helmet, hauberk, shield, spear or two-handed axe (galloglas).

Littlefinger as lord of Harrenhall and knights of the Vale might decide to go south, maybe even with Sansa and her Tully blood, if she wants to be Queen that much.

I'm sure this may have been pointed out by others, but I haven't seen anything about it. None of what I noticed is directly foreshadowing, but when you look back at it you can definitely see some connections between what happened in that scene and events from the series.

Here's some things that I noticed:

* Everyone in the Stark family that Robert touched has died, and only them so far. Robert makes physical contact with Ned, Catelyn, Rickon and Robb, and all have died so far(in the show at least). The rest of them; Arya, Sansa and Bran (though idk what to make of Jon) is alive. This whole touch and die thing might be coincidental, but I don't think it's that much of a stretch to say that it was intentional by the creators.

When Robert interacts with the Starks, there's also a lot that hints at coming events in the show:

* After greeting Ned and Catelyn, Robert shakes Robb's hand and says ""You must be Robb"". There might not be too much in that, but it kind of fits with the fame that comes with being KITN.
* Robert looks at Sansa and says ""Aye, you're a pretty one"", which is basically a huge part of her life before and after that scene. Being pretty and lady-like sort of objectifies her as nothing but a pretty face, which is essentially how people treat her up until season 6: a pretty face with a good family name that is used and married for other people's interests.
* Robert goes up to Arya and says ""Your name is?"", which foreshadows so much of her story. Not only does she try to ""lose her name"" by becoming one of the ""faceless men"", but also before that in her story she is constantly using different names and hiding her identity.
* Bran is asked to show his muscles, and Robert says ""You'll be a soldier"", which of course he never will because he shortly after loses use of his leg muscles.
* Rickon gets a pat on the head because no one cares about him.


EDIT: Alright, perhaps ""irony"" was a more suitable word than ""foreshadowing""

&lt;b&gt;Season 2, Episode 2&lt;/b&gt; - Varys and Tyrion are chatting. Specifically, it's the conversation where Varys reveals to Tyrion that he knows his secret of bringing Shae to Kings Landing. More popularly remembered as Varys' ""And I keep on paddling"" episode. Verbatim, it is as follows:

The storms come and go, the waves crash overhead, the big fish eat the little fish, and I keep on paddling"" - Varys (The Eunoch)

I found it interesting that Varys begins his little spiel with the words ""The storms come and go"" - as Euron made his introduction with the words ""I am the storm"" in his speech. 

Knowing that Euron intends to sail for Dany, and Varys has been working the anon-support-from-afar angle for Dany as well, could it be that there is a collaboration of sorts between Varys and Euron? 

What sort of collusion could these two spectacles of human manipulation be plotting? If there is a connection between the two, I would be very excited to see this revealed and watch the plan succeed or fail.

For my money there's only one answer.

Tywin Lannister

for a multitude of reasons

1. he's MASSIVE threat due to his high level of intelligence and overall competence matched with his ruthlessness.  both directly and indirectly responsible for some of the most atrocious things committed in canon, such as the rape and murder of Elia Martell and the killing of her children,   the torturing at Harrenhall,  the massive civilian death toll in the Riverlands, and the Red Wedding. 

2. He's clearly still human, still has flaws and makes mistakes, but is also capable of kind actions (as demonstrated with his scenes with Arya) and can appreciate the strengths of those around him (unless their name is Tyrion) he doesn't do vile things seemingly for the sake of just being evil or just for personal satisfaction (Hello Joffrey/Ramsay) he does these things because they can benefit his family and he feels the ends justify the means. ""Explain to me why it is more noble to kill 10,000 men in battle than 12 at dinner?""
 
3. Charles Dance.  for my money easily among the top 5 performances in the series,  Charles Dance just NAILED IT. whether he was intimidating Joffrey, demonstrating his intelligence while verbally sparring with Olenna Tyrell, showing excessiveness stubbornness in his attitudes toward Tyrion, his ruthless callousness regarding the Red Wedding, his disappointment when speaking with his children, his intrigue and slight admiration of Arya, he ran through a gamut of different character values and emotions and hit a 10/10 on every single one. 

4. His backstory, family, everything about the construction of his story informs his character and his personality, you can immediately understand how this man came to be what he is,  there's no contrivance, no drastic unexplained shift, he grew dissatisfied with the reputation of his family under his Father's weak tenure, so improving his family's reputation became a core element of his motivation, he wanted a strong family to continue to uphold their new reputation of strength, which is why he found the children he ended up with so disappointing.
he could have expanded his family  and strengthened his legacy further if not for the death of his beloved wife, but she died giving birth to Tyrion which fueled Tywin's resentment as he simultaneously lost the chance to expand his legacy and gained a permanent black mark on it (in his eyes) all down to one person.

My main issue with this is that it provides little to no actual help to her. The north can muster maybe 10-15 thousand men at best. The majority of their armies were wiped out in the War of Five Kings, Iron Born Invasion, Battle for Winterfell, and the Battle of Bastards. Furthermore, I don't see Jon marching his army south to help Daenarys take the throne. It just wouldn't make sense for him to commit his few troops left to a cause that is minor compared to the WW threat. A marriage alliance between these two would simply not help Daenarys enough.

It would be far more strategic of her to marry Tyrion, Edmure, or Robyn. A marriage alliance with any of those three could potentially guarantee the support of closer, larger armies for her. The Vale still has 20,000+; Lannisters have at least 20,000+; and I'm sure the riverlands could muster up a large army still. 

On the flip side it would be a very smart decision for Jon to try and woo Dany. ",66,18,False,self,,,,,

I mean, even if the book was finished (which I suspect it is and has been for quite a while) is it being held back for the purposes of keeping the tv show fresh?

When it comes to issues like this, and this is fairly uncommon I would think, where you have two properties somewhat dependent on each other and one has to be more valuable than the other, who dictates the terms of release for each?  I would have to think that the show is way more popular than the books (everyone who reads the books watches the show but everyone who watches the show doesn't read the books) but in terms of profitability the book has to outweigh the show.

If the book came out before the final seasons would it ruin the show more than if the book came out after the show ruining the book?  The books have mainly subtle differences from the show so when those of us who read the books watched the show we knew the generalities although the specifics were different.  But if the generalities about the ending got out it would most likely spoil it for everyone.

I guess it comes down to what GRRM wants to do.  The book sales are probably greatly affected by the tv show, they'd probably sell a ton more if it came out now as opposed to after the show ended.  I would assume they'd sell the same amount as the older ones if it came out after.  But are the extra book sales enough to reveal the ending of the show and ruin it for the greater audience?",9,6,False,self,,,,,

I added up all the seasons lengths and there is only a twenty minute gap between longest and shortest season.

So it seems that the show runners have a target when it comes to show length.

There is a lot of talk about the lack of ten episodes for season 7, Dave and Dan mentioning that the show ""It's crossing out of a television schedule into more of a mid-range movie schedule."" Does this mean we are to expect longer episodes?

The average series length so far is 554 minutes/9.2 hours. If the show continues to follow it's targets for length instead of episode number then each of the seven episodes of season 7 could be on average, 79 minutes long.

The filming schedule is delayed for wintry weather but they are still filming from August 2016 to February 2017. That is a longer time span than any of the previous seasons.

It doesn't seem that likely that we are going to get 80 minute long episodes but maybe a few of them will be. HYPE

I posted in an related thread, but thought the topic was complex enough to merit its own thread. 

So, my question (or rather theory posted in question form) is that Sansa advanced the cause of House Stark (but not necessarily Jon Snow or their allies) by withholding the information about the Knights. 

How?  Well, had Snow known, then he probably wouldn't have kept it a secret from Ramsey. And had Ramsey know about the KotV, a fine fighting force untouched by the earlier wars, and whose number we don't know, but we would have to estimate they number at least 4-5k, then Ransey would have known he was actually outnumbered. And if Ramsey had known he was outnumbered, he doesn't meet them in the field, but rather stays behind the walls of Winterfell where 200 men can hold off a vastly superior force, according to Ned Stark. He would let them do their siege, and he'd launch some guerilla actions, and probably kill Rickon from the top of the tallest tower to cause snow to attack, but he wouldn't commit to a force on force, he would just wait them out. Ramsey was sick, but he wasn't stupid, and he was pretty clever as a commander. 

Of course the danger there is that Snow is then able to rally some other houses, being that he now has a Stark, and a real army, but I'd still have to think time would be on Ramsey's side. Especially with a force of comprised of free folk, and other houses. Doing a siege in winter would just be too hard. 

However, because Ramsey didn't know, we saw what happened and house Bolton fell. 

So, do you agree or disagree?  Obviously Sansa should have told him and hoped that Snow kept that ace up his sleeve. Her not doing so did get a lot of people killed. But more or less than if Ramsey had found out about them?",15,1,False,self,,,,,

Here is my reasoning:

1. Why read the books when you know the ending already?: After the show concludes, book readers will still probably read the books (with ADoS releasing 8 years after the show ends), but if they're also show watchers much of the steam will be taken out of reading the ending because now they already know generally how it would end. Knowing GRRM the last thing he wants to be is predictable, what better way to throw everyone off their game by completely giving a different ending than whats in the show.

2. It would encourage show readers to go back and read the books: Now I know many show readers have already taken to the books, but as we wind down with the show we're left with assumptions about book characters. Clearly all these extended characters that were cut from the show would have no real significant impact on the ending right? WRONG! Incorporate all the characters and forge a new ending resulting in an almost ""alternate timeline"" view between the books and the show.

3. Give GRRM more creative opportunity: Now i'm sure GRRM has thought of multiple ways to end ASOFAI but what better opportunity to end it in two different ways than giving one ending to the show and another to the books. We've heard GRRM say that the ending would be bittersweet, and we all believe him, but how great would it be if the show went with a feel good kinda sorta bittersweet ending for the show, and then for the books include a gut wrenching good guys win with great sacrifice ending for the book that no one saw coming, it would be classic GRRM.

4. It would stimulate sales of the book series: This one kinda just takes the previous reasons and bundles them together, a new ending would encourage people who normally wouldn't have read the books to go and read them, maybe some of them would just skip to the last book to get the end, but with all the cut characters that weren't in the show, they would probably feel the need to go back and buy the series and read through it as a whole.

5. Book readers would get the full experience: Book readers have always been the loyal fan base that the series would build on, and they will continue to be the loyal fan base to continue reading even after they know the full story, what better way to reward them than with a ending that feels like its just for them.

TL;DR: Do you believe that the endings for the show and the book will be different? If so, to what degree? Not so different, or completely different? Let me know what you guys think!

My theory is that they've been setting this conflict up for a while now.  In Essos, we've seen a couple of scenes now where different priests and priestesses are preaching to a group of people about how Dany should be worshipped.  In Westeros, I think Melisandre will convince the Brotherhood without Banners to flock behind Jon Snow as Azor Ahai now that she believes he is the savior.  I think the scene where some of the Brotherhood go against Thoros and Beric and kill those villagers is a sign of things to come.  The more radical Dany lovers will be led by Kinvara and the more humbled Jon Snow believers will be led by Melisandre.  This will definitely be only one of many plots to come in Season 7 and 8 but this would have to be the least forced way to set up a conflict between Jon and Dany (Before they eventually get together and bone of course).",12,6,False,self,,,,,

With Jon and Rickon, you can at least *sort of* give them a pass for being bloodthirsty for vengeance and absolutely terrified, respectively. But what excuse does Smalljon Umber have for climbing right into the middle of the trap he helped set?

As far as I can tell, the basic plan was, surround them with the shield wall and gradually box them in. Smalljon *has* to have been aware of this, since he was the one leading the bulk of those forces into the melee.

Obviously, there would be bragging rights and probably some tangible reward for the soldier(s) who actually cut Jon down and could prove it. I have to imagine that's why the two Bolton goons back in S5 both got themselves killed by a badly wounded Stannis, since they were trying to incapacitate him, rather than kill him right then and there. (Remember the one that sliced open the back of his ankle?) But again, those guys were just regular goons who could probably use the bit of extra reward money and/or land. 

Smalljon, on the other hand, already had it made. Between delivering Rickon to Ramsay and contributing Umber soldiers to his cause, Smalljon was almost inevitably going to come out stronger, so long as they won that battle. (And at the time he climbed into the center, the Vale Knights weren't there yet, and there was no reason to believe that the outcome hadn't already been decided in his side's favor).",13,2,False,self,,,,,

I posted this as a [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwjYiwKBrTQ) yesterday and it was taken down due to a thumbnail that contained a spoiler on [Jorah's greyscale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwjYiwKBrTQ) , so I'm just putting this back up again and added text below. Cheers!

After reading ADWD I became very curious about greyscale and what it's potential role would be in the series (book and show). It wasn't until recently that I took weekend to research exactly what our friends in ASOIAF suffering from this affliction, could possibly do to cure this seemingly death sentence.
I started by tracking the disease to it's real world inspiration...leprosy, which led me to look at the treatments for it. I noticed that the chemical composition of Dapson contained an element that is mentioned a few times over in the book. I immediately drew a link to the only curable instance that is known to both book and show, that instance being Shireen Baratheon's. We all know the story of Stannis bringing in maesters and healers to treat his daughter. We don't know what stopped the spread of greyscale, but perhaps there is a scientific explaination. Sulfur is part of the chemical make up of Dapson, sulfur would have been abundant on Dragonstone and so would Magnesium Sulfate (Epsom Salt) which is used to treat infections like staff and is in general, an inhibitor of aerobic bacteria.
After reading Hamfast44's post about the Ironborn ritualistic drowning potentially being a primitive form of inoculation, it really made me think that there might be something to this. Sulfur is also likely an ingredient in dragon glass aka obsidian. Now (real world) obsidian as a volcanic substance does not contain sulfur, however, dragon's fire is almost always noted, in ASOIAF, as having a sulfuric smell. That last part has nothing to do with greyscale, but perhaps the third most abundant element in the human body is a key opposing ingredient to winning the war for the dawn?",5,7,False,self,,,,,

Meera is the only character with no lines in the scene. Not a single one -- Bran pleads for her, Tanner threatens her (and everyone), Jojen tries to bargain, and even Tanner's mooks get a few mutters and chuckles, but Meera doesn't say a word. Now that I've noticed it, it seems so obviously weird.

I haven't gone through and seen how many lines she's had in all her screentime thus far, but I'm sure it's less than 20. So the question is -- is Meera a mystery on purpose, so that we can get to know her now as she and Bran travel alone? Or has the narrative just consistently dicked her over to the point where we know nothing about her as a character, and it's about to become awkwardly obvious? Because if it's the latter, that's seriously unimpressive. I've started to get the impression she is a prop-character, there to help the others and move the plot along but with no motivations or backstory of her own.

He thinks quickly in dire situations which is usually how he stays alive.

Most think this means Jon will combat or try and dissuade her to help defend the North.

Now if this doesn't go well, there is some history with the Stark's and dragons.

The last Stark king bent the knee to Aegon the Conqueror, earning him the title: ""The King Who Bent the Knee"", however he did it to save his people. Now that Dany is using a similar method of benefitting her allies, Jon might be tempted to bend the knee. But will he?

If it comes to battle due to his Stark heritage, his sister still remaining alive, and his desire to fight in the North and not the South, do you see him making an anti-dragon tool?

Would it be possible? Some sort of Net-Trebuchet, possibly steel razor wire of some sort? I think it would be interesting if he broke out of the traditional Stark expectation when it comes to dragon fighting.

Dany has a huge force so she'll need a reason to see why taking the north isn't the right choice, or any easy one.

She also wants to take revenge for the Hound whom she considers dead. 

In the books Lady Stoneheart presumably killed them both. I think the show had decided to replace her with Arya doing the job. Also, this really seems to be all heading to this direction since Brienne and Pod are in the Riverlands. (They aren't in Winterfell) and Arya's presence there seems to be connected. Another thing which increases my suspicions is Maisie Williams tweets after reading the script saying' that this isn't anything we're prepared for.. Which may be bad news for some of our beloved characters.

(A Speculation of Houses, Families, and Plotlines)",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4zj8tk/everything_what_if_the_song_of_ice_and_fire_was/,HerrSprink,1472141007,"So with the current state of things in the show, some pretty crazy stuff is shaping up to unfold in the coming two seasons. Daenerys is going to invade Westeros, Jon is going to fight the White Walkers, there'll be some inevitable conflict between the two yadda yadda yadda. But this stuff has been coming for a long time and what I've been personally intrigued with since I started the series was what exactly the ""Song of Ice and Fire"" actually meant. 

In terms of the show and the novels, those two elements of ice and fire can be interpreted in many different ways. Some believe that the ""ice"" is the force of the Others who will descend upon Westeros and wreak havoc and that the ""fire"" is the combined force of humanity that will combat it, for example. Another common theory is that ""ice"" and ""fire"" are representative of the two ""main"" houses of the franchise, those being Stark and Targaryen respectively. This would make sense, as those elements are even displayed in some form or another in each house's imagery, words, and even location. House Stark is THE northern great house, their words, ""Winter is Coming"" indicate ice, snow, and an entire season descending upon the world, their domain is similarly called Winterfell, and even their sigil features wintry colors. Conversely, House Targaryen's words, ""Fire and Blood"" connote flames and conquest, their colors evoke the destructive power of fire, and their sigil is the dragon, which is also commonly associated with fire. These themes even extend to the heirs of each house, such as Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen. Jon is seen as dower and brooding yet well respected, typically displaying traits that could be considered ""icy"" if you'll allow an unfortunate pun and similarly Daenerys is passionate, driven, and seems to spread from one place to the next with little stopping her, indicating that she could actually be fire incarnate. Hell, even the ""rebirth"" of each character would indicate that each character is their respective element, as Daenerys is seemingly immune to fire and becomes her own woman after cleansing herself in it and Jon comes back from the far reaches of death as a cold corpse.

However, none of is this really groundbreaking stuff. It's been assumed that these thematic implications have been implicit since the inception of each character in the novels and tv show but despite this, I'd like to posit something a little different today. Very simply put, what if Jon was the ""fire"" and Daenerys was the ""ice""? Throughout each season of Game of Thrones and each of the novels, the arc words of franchise, ""Winter is Coming"" become more and more prevalent as the characters age and grow increasingly aware of the conflicts plaguing Westeros. The Others threaten to kill everyone on the continent, Daenerys and her growing reputation spread panic in the current monarchy, and many different schisms and conflicts in the North and Riverlands basically result in martial law from the Trident upwards. Yet still, as House Stark is smashed to pieces and drawn further apart, many different individuals from all walks of life still repeat those words, ""Winter is Coming"". This is perhaps best encapsulated by Olenna Tyrell when she quips that that her own family's words, ""Growing Strong"" mean relatively little in comparison to the Stark motto.

Yet the idea of Jon being the ""fire"" and Daenerys being the ""ice"" is still unbroached. Despite the almost irrefutable evidence that Jon is now and has always been a Targaryen, Jon's presence in the series as ""fire"" doesn't really become relevant until the later seasons in which we see his rallying abilities. He quickly rises up the ranks of the Night's Watch and leads them in what he thinks is the best way possible, fighting valiantly through two mutinees and commanding respect, being grudging or legitimate. He attempts to save the Wildlings from the growing threat of the White Walkers and does so with relative success. He even manages to gain the favor of several northern houses in his quest to reinstate House Stark as the Lords Paramount of the North. What is most interesting about these successes is that they have come in the last few seasons of the show, and relatively speaking of course, this meteoric rise to success is again exemplary of the metaphor of ""fire"". Jon's legendary skills as a leader and swordsman spread throughout the north and his chief rival in S6, Ramsay remarks that he doesn't wish to fight Jon one-on-one, knowing that he'd lose to perhaps the best swordsman in the North. Even Lady Lyanna Mormont realizes that Jon is the best hope the North has of becoming stable, shaming (SHAME) other northern lords for their refusal to support Jon and Sansa. At the end of the season, Jon is declared the new King in the North and with many houses being sworn to Jon's cause, Jon is perhaps the metaphorical embodiment of ""fire"" that humanity will huddle around as the ""ice"", be it White Walker or otherwise descends upon them.

Conversely, Daenerys is shaping up to be quite the force to be reckoned with, descending upon Westeros with the full intention to put the continent to the sword if she has to, to regain her crown. Daenerys has made many decisions, both ill and justified, that would indicate that she is typical of the dragon's blood, yet perhaps she is the ""ice"" in the franchise. Daenerys often acts with an empowered sense of justice, freeing slaves and reforming systems that she does not believe in herself, for which she gains the epithet of ""breaker of chains"". However, Daenerys's characterization throughout the series becomes gradually less heroic as time passes and she is forced to act with impunity. She burns those, quite literally, who wrong her often without a second thought, and while this is indeed a form of swift justice, it creates respect out of fear rather than instilled courage or wonder. Daenerys's temperament hardens with the deaths of her brother, husband, son, and some of her closest advisers, yet as the series progresses, Daenerys acts with more detachment as she learns to rule. Finally, in the last scene of S6, we see her full fleet sailing over to Westeros, with many of her entourage pleased with the fruits of their labor yet Daenrys stands there with little excitement on her face. She simply has one task, to descend upon Westeros and take back what she believes is rightly hers. Here we see for the first time ""ice"" masquerading as ""fire"", with cold detachment and singular purpose. ",10,12,False,self,,,,,

All of the rankings are adjusted, and some new characters have been added! Aside from the tier list, there are also full-battle analyses on the Tower of Joy and The Battle of the Bastards!

In case you missed the last posts, I made this website to evaluate and rank the swordsmen of television and movies based on the realism of their fight choreography - I use what I know about fencing to assess them as if they were really dueling rather than engaging in silly-looking stage combat.  For my purposes, choreography is more important than lore.

""For all of its great moments, season six did not have many of the great duels that we got to enjoy in previous seasons. Most of the fighting was done against the extras of the Bolton army, and some characters who I had hoped to add to my rankings werent shown fighting at all.

Areo Hotah was stabbed in the back, The Blackfish died off screen, Ramsay opted to shoot at Jon rather than duel him, and the waif was killed in the dark. But theres still lots of swordplay to analyze. Aside from an updated tier list, you can also see my thoughts on the aforementioned characters, some major battles, and my thoughts on the much-hyped Cleganebowl below.""

I also made a facebook @TheSwordsmansStandard, if anyone is interested.

That being said, I want to thank you guys for all of the great discussions and feedback that I got for my season 1-5 rankings!

I'm not a huge ""Game Of Thrones"" fan, but I noticed something and could not find anything about it posted on the Web, so I thought I'd pitch it here.

Obviously, impossible to discuss without spoilers, so be warned.




The prevailing wisdom is that Melissandre, The Red Woman, resurrected Jon Snow. I don't think she did.

Melissandre used blood magic to kill Renley. We see that on screen.

Besides that, she has done nothing successfully. She has exhibited no magic and was actually shocked by the resurrecting powers exhibited by Thoros Of Myr.

In ""The Red Woman,"" Melissandre's true nature is revealed and it appears from what is actually in the episode, that her appearance is a result of magic from the amulet she wears. Beyond that, when we see her with her potions, the assumption is that they are either functional or help her create illusions. Poisons and potions are, generally, their own thing and functional on their own (i.e. poison kills, not because it is magical, but because it has a reaction with organic tissue).

So, within the show ""Game Of Thrones"" (not the books), Melissandre does one magic trick and everything else we see from her is her using the power of suggestion (I see this future, ""look into the flames"") or outright failure (Stanis couldn't take King's Landing because he didn't take me with him!).

In short, Melissandre is wrong far more than she is right and there is no evidence that she actually has power beyond Stanis's power to impregnate her and deliver shadow killers.

So . . . doesn't it seem like it was Davos who actually resurrected Jon Snow?

Melissandre leaves, taking her ""style over substance"" faith with her. Davos stays, Jon is resurrected. While Davos does not like Melissandre, he has vouched for the abilities of the Lord Of Light to others, based on having seen the shade that killed Renley. Even Melissandre has said that the Lord Of Light is not done with Davos and with all of the other reversals in ""Game Of Thrones,"" doesn't it seem far more likely and logical that Davos is the true conduit for the powers of the Lord Of Light? Every battle that Davos is with Stanis, Stanis survives; Davos is sent back to Castle Black and, despite Melissandre's sacrifice, Stanis is defeated.

Wouldn't Davos be just another statement by the producers on the substance of faith over the appearance of faith? And wouldn't it be much more believable that it was Davos, not Melissandre, who brought Jon Snow back from the dead?",43,12,False,self,,,,,

As I was rewatching the seasons, I noticed that the name ""Jaehaerys"" was already said by non other than Sam when travelling with Gilly and Sam Jr to Castle Black. Since then his name has never been spoken or mentioned ever since. 

I just thought It was cool to see the most (debatable) yet popular name already had been mentioned in the show with a tiny bit of Westrosi along with it.

Lord Randyll Tarly - Reaction - Anger. He was livid his son brought home a wildling. 

Sansa Stark - Reaction - No expression, almost unconcerned about the news of the dead marching. Seemed more concerned about Bolton

Little Finger - Reaction - Bored expression on his face.Obviously concerned about the Iron Throne. 

The Northern Houses - Reaction - A little surprised. But were more concerned about the Red Wedding and who avenged them and who didn't.

People who had normal reaction - 

Brandon Stark &amp; Meera Reed

Jon Snow &amp; Certain Night's Watch Members. 

Sam Tarly &amp; Gilly 

Wildlings &amp; Tormund 

Ser Davos 

Stannis ( Mostly due to Melisandre) 

I would add Melisandre but then she is on another league. She not only knows about the Long Night, she is also in search and claimed to have found the Promised Prince (twice).

These are the two ways I would react:

Either dismiss it off and laugh at the person or take the person extremely seriously. The reaction to news of Night King  is somewhat puzzling.",38,11,False,self,,,,,

If Cersei gave Maggy attitude while asking for a prophecy (which she most likely did), I can see Maggy making up some crazy nonsense just to mess with her, and it would mess with her even more if Maggy attached the fake prophecy to a couple of real ones (marrying the king, gold will be their crowns).

- Jaime will understand that he never really saw Cersei's true face, his life was a lie and the woman he loves is actually Brienne.
- He will help Sansa, Arya and Brienne and he will kill Cersei. He will almost die there but Brienne will save him and make him go with her instead of dying with Cersei. Either Brienne or Sandor may save Jaime from the Mountain by killing the Mountain. Brienne is likely because the Valyrian sword that Jaime gave her may kill the zombie Mountain (it's only natural to expect that Jaime's decision to go back and save Brienne in the bear's pit and to give his sword to her will save his life at one point), and Sandor is also likely because...Cleganebowl of course.
- Jaime and Brienne will fight together against white walkers, and Jaime will die in the last battle either saving Bran or Jon, killing an ice dragon or maybe the night's king and being killed by it.
- Brienne will be pregnant when the war-winter is over, and she will give birth to a child. She may die as well, or continue serving the kingdom as a knight. The child will be raised by Jon (and Sansa or Arya), like Jon was raised by Ned. Jon's real father Rhaegar was kind of similar to Jaime, sacrificing everything for love and all, and Jon's real mother died at birth. I think Jaime and Brienne are kind of like Rhaegar and Lyanna (Rhaegar was also a grey character whose wife and children were killed, and he fell in love with another woman and they both died but their child survives and becomes a king). So maybe Jon and Sansa (or Arya or Daenerys) will be parents to Jaime and Brienne's child, just like Ned and Catelyn have been to Jon himself.

Bittersweet ending.

And here is the proof in Norse Mythology:

------------

Jaime is a combination of Tyr, Sigurd and Freyr in Norse Mythology:

Tyr: One-handed God of War. Tyr is a reference for Tyr-ion but Jaime's name was Tyrion in the original outline of GRRM, a Lannister who was supposed to protect Stark girls, and to switch sides later (and to fall in love with someone). Tyr had an adulterous wife once, and he was destined to kill and be killed by the biggest monster in Ragnarok.

Sigurd: Lover of Brynhildr who was a virgin warrior. He saved Brynhildr and they fell in love and Sigurd gave him a magic ring symbolizing his love but he was tricked to marry another woman by making him forget the memory of Brynhildr, using magic. He had children with the other woman, but in the end his wife and children die. He remembers that the woman he loved was actually Brynhildr but he is killed by (and kills) an enemy eventually and Brynhildr wishes to die with him, and they die together. But they leave a daughter behind who is raised by a foster father and she becomes a queen in the future, marrying a future king. 

Freyr: Twin brother of Freyja. He had a magic sword but he gave it away. He was the last person to die in the final battle of Ragnarok. He fell in love with a woman, they got married and they had a son who became the king later.

---------------

Cersei is a combination of Gudrun, Freyja and Gullveig:

Gudrun: Fools Sigurd, marries a king later and her children die in the end.

Freyja: Twin sister of Freyr. A goddess associated with love, sex, beauty, fertility, gold, war, and death.

Gullveig: She is believed to be the same figure as the goddess Freyja. Her name is associated with the words ""gold"", ""alcoholic drink"", ""power"". She was speared by one of the Gods who are considered as sir (Tyr is one of them), she was burnt but reborn. 

---------------

Brienne is a combination of Brynhildr and Gerr.

Brynhildr: A maiden who served to a king in a battle between two kings. She was imprisoned but saved by the legendary warrior Sigurd. The two fell in love but Sigurd was tricked by another woman and left her. She waited for Sigurd a long time but in the end they became enemies on the opposite sides, although Sigurd remembered his love for her eventually it was too late and he was killed. Brynhildr jumped into fire when she saw his dead body in the fire and they passed on to the other world together. Their daughter Aslaug was raised by a foster father and married the Viking King when she grew up.

Gerr: A goddess and wife of god Freyr. Freyr had to give away his magic sword to get her. Their son becomes the king in the future.

So I was reading [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4zo1xu/everything_jaime_cersei_and_briennes_fates_based/) and I thought of another parallel that I think fits quite well. If this was already posted before, please do forgive me.

**Littlefinger = Loki**
Also known as the god of lies.

Loki also has children that can be symbolic of what Littlefinger was able to accomplish
or the things he uses to manipulate the game:


**Jrmungandr** who is a giant beast and also a snake. Snakes are often symbolism of lies and poison. Which Littlefinger uses often against his enemies.

**Hel** who is directly called death. That's not a hard one. Remember Jon Arryn.

**Fenrir** who was a giant wolf. In this case, it could mean Ned Stark. He used him for his plans.

**Sleipnir** is an eight legged horse. Horses are usually associated with war wich Petyr uses to his advantage.

**Narfi and Vali** Vali was turned by the gods into a wolf at some point who then tore out the sinews of Narfi. Also the sinews were used to blind Loki until Ragnarok. Vali here could be Sansa. He's, indeed, blinded by her until the Ragnarok, or Winter, starts and the game changes when Jon is declaed DAKINGINDANORF. So he was able to use Sansa to this point.

-----

I'm sure GRRM uses mythology as reference for his story a lot of times, but this was just something I thought was interesting and that could work.

How do you think their new roles will play out in the intermission between battles?

Jon now has to come to terms with a different form of leadership. He already had to live in his fathers shadow, but now he has to live up to his father's martial ability. He is the only one carrying the Stark line, and will now have to enforce what he is (partial heir, commander, Targaryan) and what he isn't (Turncloak, trueborn, etc.). How will he come into the role as the leader of a house he always tried to place himself outside of?

Sansa had made a choice to let Jon play leader. She seems to support that and has taken almost a backseat in the ruling, while making sure Jon listens to her counsel. She seems to be done in southron politics for now, however she's been applying their tactics to the North (deceit, sneak attacks, alliances). Do you think she'll fall into the Lady Stark role? Or will she embrace her southron tendencies with her northern blood? We also don't know if she may have a Bolton bastard brewing in her, and this might come into play for her conflict as well.

Arya is coming home now possibly. If she does and mentions what she's been doing, how will she reconcile that with her lineage? The Starks are a proud and noble house of honor, where she has been practicing assassination, poisons, and shadow, the furthest from honor. Do you think she'll come to relent these later because she wants to be a Stark? Or allow it to happen because honor is what killed her father? She now is almost the most outsider of all the children, how does she come to terms with that?

So what are your thoughts? Who will they strive to be and who will they become?",7,4,False,self,,,,,

For the later seasons, I get excited at the thought of watching really any episode in Season six. The Battle of the Bastards would be even more amazing! The team at HBO spends so much time and effort getting the cinematography to look great, it would be amazing if we could see it as they intended. 

Plus this would be a great thing to roll out a HDR version of each season every 2 months to keep us all entertained until Season 7 comes.

Where is Gendry, why is he important to the story and did he win the gold medal in Rio for rowing? House Baratheon is my favorite house in Westeros and I don't believe George is done with them just yet.

**Some backstory on House Baratheon:**
House Baratheon was founded by Orys Baratheon, half-brother to Aegon the Conqueror. This means that all Baratheons have blood relation to the Targaryens. Ormund Baratheon, Robert's grandfather, also married a Targaryen, giving his bloodline a stronger connection to them. This has huge implications for Gendry! Gendry is a bastard of Robert Baratheon. ***He is the only living person with Baratheon blood (TV Show) and one of three with Targaryen blood (TV Show).*** It drives me up the wall when people say he is not important to the story!

**Where did all the Baratheons go?**
Robert was killed by a boar/murdered by his wife, Cersei Lannister. His children, Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen Baratheon were fathered by his wife's brother, Jaime Lannister. This eliminates their claim to the bloodline. Though the realm was aware of the rumor of Jaime and Cersei's incest, it was not fully accepted as truth. Now that they're all dead, this claim no longer has to be disputed. Robert's brothers Renly and Stannis are both dead along with Stannis' daughter, Shireen. Cersei/Joffrey also had all of Robert's other bastards killed. I think Robert has other bastards in the books but I haven't read them. So for the TV show, that leaves us with Gendry.

**So where is Gendry and what can he add to the story?**
I'm not sure how Gendry will be reintroduced, but I believe he will revive House Baratheon and he will do it with help from House Stark.

**Why do I think this?**
Jon Snow was just declared head of House Stark and DAKINGINDANORF. Though he is not actually Ned's bastard (R+L=J), everyone believes he is. If the ""bastard"" of Ned Stark can rise to the head of House Stark and become legitimate, a bastard of Robert Baratheon can most assuredly do the same thing. Though Gendry and Jon have never met, they already have very strong connections. Gendry became good friends with Arya Stark in their time with the Brotherhood Without Banners. He even went as far as to say *""You would be my lady.""* Though Jon hasn't seen Arya since Season 1, they were very close and Arya was Jon's favorite sibling (cousin). Davos Seaworth also appears to be DAHANDOFDAKINGINDANORF. House Seaworth is a former vassal of House Baratheon and Davos even risked his life to free Gendry from Stannis and Mel. And to top it all off, Jon and Gendry are now distant relatives after the R+L=J reveal. Jon has every reason to help Gendry restore House Baratheon.

**What do I think will happen?**
I'd love it if Gendry rowed all the way to Old Town and bumped into Sam because we all imagine him still rowing and it could further cement his circle of friends around Jon, though I think that's unlikely. He's most likely gonna stumble across the Brotherhood again, be given control of House Baratheon by Jon or other nobles, solidify an alliance with House Stark through a marriage to Arya (doesn't have to happen because of all the other ties) and proceed to kick ass and take names.

TLDR: Gendry's gonna go all ""Ours is the Fury"", revive House Baratheon and team up with House Stark.

From the books:

&gt; The legends say that the Night's King was a warrior without fear, and when he saw a woman atop the Wall with skin as white as the moon and eyes like blue stars, he chased her and loved her though her skin was cold as ice, and when he gave his seed to her he gave his soul as well. He brought her back to the Nightfort and proclaimed her a queen and himself her king, and with sorceries he bound his Sworn Brothers to his will. For thirteen years he ruled until finally the Stark of Winterfell and Joramun of the wildlings had joined to free the Watch from bondage. After his fall, when it was discovered that he had been sacrificing to the Others, all records of him were destroyed and his very name was forbidden

&gt; Some say the Night's King was a Bolton, or a Magnar out of Skagos, others say he was an Umber, Flint, or Norrey. Others still say he was a Woodfoot, who ruled Bear Island before the ironmen came, but others still say he was a Stark who was brother to the man who brought him down

&gt; three fires must you light  one for life and one for death and one to love. three mounts must you ride  one to bed and one to dread and one to love. And three treasons will you know  once for blood and once for gold and once for love

From the show:

* The night king looks at Jon and shows him how he can raise the dead. Is that an advanced form of warging?
* Bran and the three-eyed raven are tied to the tree the same way the man that was stabbed with dragon glass
* The scenes hint at all of them being tied to a tree, like a foreshadowing image
* The man's right arm is not visible
* It's unclear if the man can walk
* This scene establishes time travel of some sort
* The rocks, with and without snow, are using the same spiral as the white walkers have done, will do

&gt; Leaf to Bran: ""We needed to defend ourselves... [] from you... from men.""

* The night king can see Bran the same way Bran can see him
* The night king can control dead people the same way Bran can warg into Hodor
* The night king stops to look when killing the three-eyed raven


Questions:

* Does Leaf maybe actually mean from ""you, Bran""?
* Did she need to stop him for something? Maybe he asked.
* Is Dany the woman atop the Wall with skin as white as the moon and eyes like blue stars?
* If the Stark who was brother to the man who brought him down is Bran, could the brother be Jon, after killing Dany as well for the Lightbringer deal to love?
* If Bran is the whispering Lord of Light from the past, could have he become too powerful, gone rogue, or maybe even have a different view on the white walkers and the wights?
* Why was exactly this the episode in which a red priestess told Varys that she knows what he was told through the flame whispers?
* Did the show told us all of this right before the Hodor scene so that we would all get distracted by Hodor?

Comment:

Maybe there are many things that would be too far a stretch for this to work, but the idea that I've been forming is that Bran must be related to the Night King. Maybe he goes back in time physically as well after decades of interactions with the past and gets captured by Leaf and the children of the forest. Maybe they even transform him in agreement. Leaf says that the problem was him, and/or men. In the books she's younger, and so is the three-eyed raven and the night's king, which could be different, more recent (then what happened earlier?).

If Bran is the Night's King maybe he's upset at the three-eyed raven and wants to kill him. Bran would be some sort of Darth Vader and the three-eyed raven that told him he'd never walk again would be some sort of Ben Kenobi (Bran would walk as the Night King, not as himself).

The point is, why in the show did they highlight the tying, the similarity of the face shape of Bran and the man and the Night King, and the whispering? All in an episode showing us time travel?

It's possible that both Leaf and the Night King knew what was going to happen in the future. The Night King if it was his past would have known, while she would/could have known because in the past she had talked about it. Clearly some of the motivations would need to be understood, but I can't ignore the amount of foreshadowing in the episode.

In a way Bran is the most standard character. Always good and in a quest for the greater good. It would be interesting if he turned out to be the one behind the mad king, the Lord of Light, many years of whispering, and ultimately even the most evil character, the Night King. In a way they are the most standard good character and the most standard evil character. But they're both simple, in the good and the evil way. It would give to the series yet another metaphor of the ice and fire: the Night King and the Lord of Light. Which would be interesting because the saving sword, Lightbringer, has the same meaning as Lucifer, which is a fallen angel (often even called dragon) - from good to (d)evil.

What the hell is going on there?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4zu1f3/everything_the_lonely_light_what_the_hell_is/,savois-faire,1472301233,"The Iron Islands is a collection of 31 islands, though there are only 8 that are considered the major islands, as the others are tiny and mostly uninhabited. Of the major Iron Islands, Lonely Light is the westernmost. In fact, it's not even located in Ironman's Bay. 8 days sailing north-west of Great Wyk (the westernmost of the major islands in Ironman's Bay), Lonely Light is a small, inhabited island at the centre of a cluster of 13 tiny islands, and it is the westernmost point of the known world, far from the Westerosi coast, way out into the Sunset Sea. House Farwynd of the Lonely Light rule the island and its smallfolk, led by Lord Gylbert Farwynd, the Lord of the Lonely Light.

The Ironborn, who are already considered a bit of an odd bunch by the other Westerosi and many of whom consider themselves a separate race altogether, exchange myths and stories about what goes on on the Lonely Light, and strongly dislike their people, whom they consider to be a weird and creepy bunch. Many claim the Farwynds are skinchangers who can take the forms of sea lions, walruses, and whales. They say the people of the Lonely Light have sex with seals and walruses to create half-human, half-animal offspring. Aeron Greyjoy certainly isn't a fan of theirs, for one. 

While all the Ironborn who have tried to sail west to see what lies beyond the Lonely Light either never returned or came back and said there was nothing but never-ending ocean, Lord Gylbert Farwynd of the Lonely Light claims that he has found land to the west, and that beyond the Sunset Sea there lies a land where every man would be a king and every wife a queen. He presents his claim to rule the Ironborn during the Kingsmoot, promising to take them west across the Sunset Sea to new lands, to ""a better place"", but he's quickly dismissed.

It isn't known for sure how the Ironborn even settled the Iron Islands in the first place, most believe it was settled by First Men who sailed there. But the First Men weren't exactly known for being sea-faring, yet the Iron Islands were inhabited since at least as long ago as the First Men invasion of Westeros, if not longer. Their throne is made of a mysterious type of stone found in other mysterious, ancient places in this world, and nothing about their culture or religion seems to really fit with the notion that they're First Men descendants (though they do live in a remote, isolated, and rough part of the world, so it's to be expected that they're a bit unique, regardless).  The Ironborn claim that they rose from the seas (hence why they think of themselves as a separate race, neither First Men nor Andal) along with the strange Seastone Chair that is their throne. 

The Farwynds are also the only remaining worshippers of the Merlings (an aspect of the religion of the Drowned God that even the other Ironborn consider too dark to practice). Merling worship is one of the darker religions in Planetos, which involves regular blood sacrifice, and which is said to give them supernatural abilities in return. The Andals wiped out all the other Merling worshippers, but never quite got to the Lonely Light.  

Brandon the Shipwright, who was a Stark king, famously sailed the Sunset Sea to reach and explore the lands beyond, but never returned. We know the Starks are First Men descendants, and skinchanging/warging is a common trait in their bloodline. Some speculate that, if the people of Lonely Light really are skinchangers (which is something not found in any of the other Ironborn), they might be the descendants of Brandon the Shipwright (the Farwynds of the Lonely Light are also nicknamed ""Wolves of the wild sea"", after the whales they can supposedly skinchange/warg into). Some also say that Aeron Greyjoy's statements about the Farwynds, whom he doesn't care for in general, and the Farwynd branch of the Lonely Light, whom he appreciates even less, provide a clue:


&gt; Aeron knew some Farwynds, a queer folk who held lands on the westernmost shores of Great Wyk and the scattered isles beyond, rocks so small that most could support but a single household. Of those, the Lonely Light was the most distant, eight days sail to the northwest amongst rookeries of seals and sea lions and the boundless grey oceans. **The Farwynds there were even queerer than the rest. Some said they were skinchangers, unholy creatures who could take on the forms of sea lions, walruses, even spotted whales, the wolves of the wild sea.**

&gt; Lord Gylbert began to speak. He told of a wondrous land beyond the Sunset Sea, a land without winter or want, where death had no dominion. Make me your king, and I shall lead you there, he cried. We will build ten thousand ships as Nymeria once did and take sail with all our people to the land beyond the sunset. There every man shall be a king and every wife a queen.

&gt; **His eyes, Aeron saw, were now grey, now blue, as changeable as the seas.**

Could the people of Lonely Light really be skinchangers? Might the Farwynds of the Lonely Light, and maybe even the smallfolk they rule, be descendants of Brandon the Shipwright? Is there really some land of plenty to the west? Or is it all just stories made up by the other Ironborn to make the people from the far away place seem different and scary?",222,1417,False,self,,,,,

Daenerys coming over with her dragons/army to take the Iron Throne would be easy, but it seems like there is no one that could stop her. Here is where Euron and his Dragon Horn come in. In the books we don't know if it actually works and we haven't seen it in the show. If he could take the Dragons (or just one) and or the throne he'd have a grater chance of marrying Daenerys. He wants power, what she has not her, him taking  either the throne before she does or a dragon would give him the upper hand. She would be the one coming to him with an offer of marriage or something else, in exchange for a quick and bloodless take over/union. Possible clue to her losing one dragon or two ... in Bran's visions we see a dragon flying over king's Landing not the three that she would most likely use to intimidate/subdue the city.

The Iron Throne room ""burnt"" was seen by Daenerys in a vision. A likely candidate to set it on fire is Jaime. Since the Mad King the only people who have set fire to king's Landing or near it (Blackwater Bay) have been Lannister's, and they have all used Wild Fire to do it. All of them so far have been siblings tyrion, Cersei and now it might be Jaime's turn. The things that are the most important to jaime were his family, all of which are dead or exiled only his sister remains. His sister is becoming more and more like the mad king he killed. People theorize Jaime will light Wild Fire and fulfill his oath to the Mad King ""burn them all"" but this time it will be for the good of the realm. Why he or someone else will set the throne on fire remains to be seen. Maybe they try Cersei's demolition trick again on Daenerys or Euron. Which leads me to ..

Bonus crackpot theory....(not based on anything)
Brienne and co. light the fire! 

Set up - Jaime has been unable to fulfill certain orders/oaths in the past and tasked brienne with one of them (return Catelyn's daughters) and has gifted her a Valyrian steel sword, which he named ""Oathkeeper"" , to help her. Jaime will believe he has to stop Cersie and Euron (Mad king x2 + dragon(s) ). He'll plan to light the throne room with them both inside and dragon(s) near by. Three man team Jaime, Brienne and Pod. (they are there for some reason) 

Event- The mountain stops/kills jaime. Brienne and Podrick kill the mountain and destroy the throne room along with Cersei, Euron and Dragon(s).

Outcome- Brenne fulfills Jaime's failed Oaths truly earning ""Oathkeeper"" and Podrick is Knighted.

Jaime Lannister. If the truth about him saving the people of king's Landing was known he would be renowned as one of the greatest knights ever. Yes, he killed the king he swore to protect, but he also saved hundreds of thousands of people, all of kings landing.

""He attempted to murder a child by pushing them out the window!!!""

Yes he did. But why? 

""Cersie! He said ""The things I do for love."" 

But who's Love? Cersie is the person he always tries to return to. Although, over and over he seems to care about small folk (this is shown more in the books). Jaime appears to be a ""for the greater good"" type of person, ""good"" being the people. It could be argued that by pushing Bran out the window he was trying to make sure Cersie's affair would not come to light. Saving his life, Cersie's, their children, and whoever else who stood in Tywin's way if he tried to save them. Basically war. The small folk suffer more than anyone during war.

To recap
He killed his own king, to save an entire city.
Attempts to kill a child to avoid war.
Sees small folk as people not just someone beneath him.

But he shouldn't have been part of an affair to begin with!!!

Yeah, that's true. He weighted the loss of life and made the choice with less bloodshed. 

He is seen as someone who puts Cersie first but, over the course of his life he seems to have put life above all else. Those are the vows he doesn't break, those are the vows he remembers. 

When he killed the mad king Cersie was still unwed, no affair. He didn't die a hero, he lived long enough to become a ""villain""..then a hero again.

A lot of people argue over who should have been the king, Stannis or Renly. That one would have been better than the other. They had their flaws, they were opposite, but they stayed their course. Robb stark seemed to be all over the place. Like iron when it came to Lord Karstark, like copper when it came to his accord with lord Walder, and true steel in the battlefield with his allies and enemies. 

Jon Stark seems to be true steel. Like Robert he makes his enemies his allies. The northern Lords that followed him, not only did it out of loyalty to the Stark name, but because they saw that even with overwhelming odds he would rise to fight for what was right. He was true steel when he executed his brothers on the wall, including a child, for murderous treason. Once more when the Northern Lords who hadn't helped him to regain his home accepted their wrong doing in dismissing him, they're people had suffered and Jon's cause seemed a weak gamble, Jon welcomed them back. He seems a combination of Robert Baratheon and Jon Arryn, Ned and Rob stark, stern but fair. Not going to one extreme or the other. Don't break like Stannis, don't bend like Renly.

It was motivated by justice--in S02E04 he says ""A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad the good"". But in the same episode Davos confronts him about the shadow that killed Renly, and Stannis replies ""cleaner ways don't win wars"". With this logic, he should have had some regard for Davos' esteem, and spare him his fingers. 
So according to Stannis, it is okay for him to use black magic, but not for Davos to smuggle food into a castle that is under siege?

We see this sort of thing happen with other wargs. In the books the wilding falcon warg was killed when he was warging into his bird and this caused his mind to stay within the bird. I can't remember if the show references this but I think that if a warg's animal is killed while the warg is is warging into it then their mind is gone as well. So,to recap.

_

""Deep Ones are a species posited by Maester Theron in his manuscript Strange Stone. Theron drew a connection between the black stone of the Seastone Chair and that of the ancient fortress that serves as foundation of the Hightower. Theron suggested they were created by the Deep Ones, a ""queer, misshapen race of half men sired by creatures of the salt seas upon human women"", according to Maester Yandel. Theron suggests they inspired the legend of merlings and that the sea creatures who fathered them inspired the religion of the Drowned God."" GOT wiki

**Children of the Sea**
_

Since it seems to be that the White Walkers are a product of the Children to fight mankind; could it be possible that the Deep Ones made an attempt too? Greyscale causes scaling of the skin and those who are effected by it seem to go feral eventually, becoming the wights of the damp. Perhaps the skin is dry because it needs to be in contact with water? They also seem to be drawn towards the water, but not per se into it? Could they be afraid of the water..? Of something in the water?

Maybe, like the children, the deep ones live long, but don't breed amongst themselves. So they're turning to any place they can like dark magic? Greyscale isn't just a disease its a curse. ""It is worse than death itself"". 

Let's take it one step further: perhaps they have some control over it still? Are we sure it spreads through physical contact and not the water itself? Shireen apparently got it from a travelling merchant's doll who arrived by boat on Dragonstone. Not to mention all the theories surrounding the Drowned God and Patchface wanting to ""march Shireen into the sea."" Maybe that wasn't the first attempt to claim Shireen for the sea... Maybe there is a correlation between the Deep Ones taking children and the fact that only children are able to survive greyscale? So many questions!

*Are they still looking for the right host like the night's king/queen to create their walkers of the sea?*

**Looks**

*Squishers: ""They look like men till you get close, but their heads is too big, and they got scales where a proper man's got hair. Fish-belly white they are, with webs between their fingers. They're always damp and fishy-smelling, but behind those blubbery lips they got rows of green teeth sharp as needles."" 


*Greyscale: ""The pattern made by the hardened and splitting skin is similar to cracks made in thin ice, and in later and more severe stages look somewhat like patterns of scales. In later stages the hardened flesh becomes mottled grey and black as it dies, resulting in the flesh appearing to have the texture of cracked grey stone, or like grey reptile scales.""

**The Grey Death and The Long Night**
_

But thats not all. A very specific description on Greyscale in the Wiki caught my eye:

""The pattern made by the hardened and splitting skin is similar to cracks made in **thin ice**, and in later and more severe stages look somewhat like patterns of scales.""

Much like The White Walkers. 


""Fish-belly white they are""


Much like The White Walkers: 


""They are taller than humans and have long wispy white hair and also commonly a white beard. They have **pale grey-white skin which is wrinkly but stretched** taut across their frames (...)""

_

*Could the White Walkers be a combination of the Dark Curse from the deep ones and the Children of the Forest?* 

Perhaps the man they turned was also cursed without them knowing and he turned, but was corrupted. Assuming it occurred like it did in the show.

Just a crackpot theory... ~*Oh, I know, Oh oh.*~ 

Let me know what you guys think.

When they cross over through to Castle Black, Stannis makes them give up their old gods - the same old gods that the North, many of whom are now sworn to Stannis - and take the Lord of Light as their god. To symbolize this, he gives them bits of weirwood to burn in the fire.

Why does he do this? People say Stannis in the books isn't supposed to be this fanatic like showStannis was presented as but it seems to me forcing his faith on people who don't believe in the same thing is kind of fanatical all the same. What are his plans for the North if that's the case? Will he force his allies in the mountain clans and other houses to give up the old gods too or threaten to destroy them?

It paints a dark picture of the future under his rule, that's for sure.",23,33,False,self,,,,,

The North (Jon, Sansa, Davos, free folk and northern houses, and I guess LF)

Dany and the East (Tyrell, Dorne, Tyrion, Varys, Theon, Yara, Jorah, Greyworm, Missandei, etc.)

The South (pretty much just Cersei, Qyburn and the Mountain but Jaime, Bronn and the Lannister army are still on her side, at least at the moment the season ended)

The Night King and the army of the dead

It seems that the most likely changes amongst these groups would either come from the return of lost allies (such as Arya and Brienne and Bran returning North) or the forging of new ones (such as a Euron/Cersei alliance, a decision for the Hound and Melisandre, etc). This is barring some huge alliance between Dany and Jon, which is of course possible. 

But I am wondering, are the rest of the main players pretty much set at this point? Or could we see some turn cloaks? I think the most likely characters to Switch allegiances are:

1) Jaime- seems likely to turn on Cersei, but may have nowhere to turn. He crippled Bran and killed Dany's father. He has love for his brother (though says he will kill him) and for Brienne

2) LF- loyal to no one but himself so I don't think he is really aligned with the North at all. His view of Dany will be interesting because she will have the upper hand on the iron throne, but if victorious her grip on the throne would likely be strong enough to prevent LF from ever taking it. I don't think he will join a losing cause in Cersei. Varys knows he is a schemer, as well. 

3) Tyrion- has stated that Dany inspires him and is now hand of the queen. But, he loves his brother, he cares for Sansa and Bran, and developed a friendship and respect for Jon both in the show and books. If he believes Dany is becoming unhinged, or if she neglects the WW to outside the throne or orders Jaime to be killed, I could see him leaving her. 

4) Theon- he loves his sister and has pledged himself to Dany, but he also carries immense guilt over his actions against the Starks and has said that Ned was his true father. He also pledged himself to Sansa and Robb before her. I think it is possible that he re-joins the North

5) Sansa- I think the look between Sansa and LF was just a tease to suggest that she might be playing the game now as well and betray Jon, but really serves as a setup for her eventual betrayal of LF. However, she did lie about the Knights of the Vale. She won't join Cersei and has no relationship with Dany

TL;DR: is the board set or is there more shuffling to be done?

Catelyn asking Brandon Stark to spare Littlefinger is in my opinion one of the biggest mistakes. Obviously we have no clue what Westeros would look like without Littlefinger but we can assume that Catelyn's family would be much better off. Littlefinger had a huge role in the death of Ned as he betrayed him at his critical moment. He was also a pretty big factor in igniting the War of Five Kings, which claimed the lives of Catelyn's son, unborn grandchild, and herself. He also gave Sansa to Ramsay and we all know where that lead. Oh and he also killed her sister.

Cat would not have had such issues with Jon but Ned's interest would still be understandable, he would still be keeping his promise to Lyanna to keep Jon safe, and Jon would not be a threat because of his still bastard status, and Brandon was dead so there wouldn't be a way for Ned to become ""dishonorable"" in other people's eyes. 

The only answer I have come up with on my own is that Ned didn't want to lie (dishonorable)or dishonor his brother in death, but he was already lying. Just always seemed to me this might have been an easier way and I've always wondered what others thought about this.

1. Been paraded through the streets in the nude, as part of a public shaming ritual. 

This will cost her both respect, and more importantly, fear.

2.Blown up the Sept, while it was occupied by many prestigious houses, including the Tyrells, formerly house Lannister's wealthiest and most powerful ally as well as the only force protecting them from the wrath of the Iron Bank. And their current leader, mind you, is Olenna Tyrell. A strong, dangerous woman who has lost all of her children to cersei (Fun fact: Since Olenna married into house Tyrell(I think?) and therefore does not have any Tyrell blood in her vains. Meaning that, in the show, the Tyrell bloodline effectively died in that sept).

This will cost Cersei the support of a great many houses, plus her actions have caused House Tyrell (about 100,000 bannermen + ships) to join with Dany Targareyan (about 150,000 infantry, 8,000 of which are the highly trained and highly loyal Unsullied + Dragons + ships(Greyjoy)). For comparison, House Lannister has roughly 60,000 bannermen(Not counting the men they lost against Robb Stark). Highly trained and highly payed, sure, but will that be enough?Also, even less support from the common people, most of whom probably want her dead now.

3. Seizing the Iron Throne (Are women even allowed to do that? Especially under these circumstances). She basically has the worst claim by now that Especially since both of her current foes (J &amp; D) are both Targaryens.

This will cost her...You get the point now.

So what do you guys think? Has Cersei finally gone bananas? Or does she have something sinister up her sleeve?   How confident she looks, sitting of that throne... 
Torn apart by internal strife and besieged by both homegrown rebels and invading foreign armies, can House Lannister maintain its grip on the Iron Throne? Or is Westeros destined for more Targaryen rule?

So, I was thinking about how much of a massive undertaking building that massive fucking wall would be. I mean, yeah. You got giants, you got forest smurfs (they cant lift that much though) and some men. All building a great big wall.

What if it wasn't just the Giants, Children and men that build the wall. What if the White Walkers helped build it, or they just did it themselves? Yes, its a bigger reach than when Brandon was going for that sword in KL throne room. But I reckon I'm onto something.

Cause think about it, why is the wall made of ice and not stone? Where the hell did they even find the ice blocks to build that thing, they got a massive fucking freezer we don't know about? OR, is it the White Walkers and their meddlesome magic.

Makes a shit ton of sense to me.

I know that ""Down Votes are Coming"" because of this theory, or maybe its been posted before. Whatever, I think its plausible. Tell me what ya rickon.

EDIT: Other speculations.
-White Walkers don't want humans in their lands, maybe they see NW ranging as acts of aggression.
-Deal was struck between Men and Walkers for everyone to stay the fuck outta the upper north region.


It just makes more sense to me that a race that harnesses ice for almost all it's shit would have built the great big bloody wall out of aforementioned ice.

This is entirely speculation, just like all the other theories about why the White Walkers are in such a bad mood. And before you say ""But they clearly say that Bob the Builder built it!"", Westeros doesn't have the most accurate recordings of history. So, yeah.",75,46,False,self,,,,,

I'm guna rattle off some random ones.

* **Howland Reed** playing a major role. Along with the other Northern Houses. We should be down with Essos for the most part. Multiple other plot lines have merged together. Should be time for the Northern Houses on screen. So , I'm pumped.
* **Sam** discovering things at the Citadel, and us getting a better understanding of the Citadel/Maesters in general. Maybe he'll find a way to rework Valyrian Steel, Find out more about Dragon Glass, find a document legitimizing Jon, or find the cure for Jorah? Those are all guesses, for all we know he'll be all done with his training when the show comes back and we'll never see Oldtown more
* **Iron Bank** is a piece to this huge puzzle and they have to be more important than the show has given them credit for. Multiple characters have stressed the power of the IB, especially Tywin and Tyrion. Tywin, though wise and grounded, isn't one to compliment the power of someone else. There's more to them.
* **Jorah** getting cured? Who the hell knows. Hope he doesn't die though. Thinking he might seek out the woman that was in Qarth? Can't remember her name but I think it's Quaithe or something. Funny forshadowing that she was telling Jorah about stonemen and greyscale and he basically ignored her while asking other questions. Then he goes through Valyria and gets it. Oh GOT.
* **Stark Reunion** will hopefully continue. Looks like Bran will be in WF shortly, however Arya might just be killing everyone. Lena Headley (Cersei) said the death she would like to see for her character is killed by Massie Williams (Arya). Could be foreshadowing but I doubt it. Probably more of her just being a fan.
* **Winter has come** ..... this might be kind of dumb, but it should be cool to see how the entire country is frozen over. Picturing KL eventually covered in snow. Should be pretty cool.
* **Casterly Rock and Highgarden** ..... I'm almost positive we won't see either of them this season, but I wish we did. Don't think they can really serve a purpose at this point, but maybe they'll prove me wrong. 
* **Rhaegar flashback** but that kind of goes hand in hand with the one below this.
* **Tourney at Harrenhall Flashback** .....  Now I didn't think of this, but I saw a theory on here about there being a flashback episode showing the tourney at Harrenhall because someone thinks the new locations that have been casted will be perfect. So they're guessing, but it still got me pumped. In regards to that, if you want to read the most in depth theory about The Game of Thrones and how everything came to be, check this out.

Navies are expensive to build and maintain and feudal kings and lords could always hire or conscript civil ships for military purposes when needed. The Eastern Romans and some of the Islamic caliphates maintained navies, though some years there was no money to crew the ships or keep them afloat. Some strong kings, like Henry V, during the Hundred Years War found the determination and funds to create a navy of ""King's Ships"" which allowed him to secure the English Channel during his lifetime.
Navies existed to transport troops and supplies, since ships (and river barges) could carry troops and supplies farther and faster than they could be transported across lands which still relied on a transportation system (roads and bridges) built over a thousand years before in some instances. Navies then had to seek to deny an enemy the prospect of transporting troops and supplies, especially an invasion force and sustaining them from the sea. Finally, navies had to fight through the enemy's attempt to prevent the movement of troops and supplies. Strategically, navies were linked to critical and essential geographic points such as narrows and straits that an enemy needed to traverse or ports and bays that facilitated the loading and unloading of troops and supplies. 
Whether Euron Greyjoy joins Cersei or not, he wants revenge on his niece and nephew. If he somehow found enough ship lumber on the Iron Islands to build his ships, crew them and arm and supply them, which would take a few months, his best bet at intercepting the Trageryan fleet is the Straits between Westeros and Essos. Ancient and medieval seamen could navigate across oceans and seas. The problem was that their ships, with some exceptions like the Vikings, weren't built to survive rough weather, so they stayed in sight of land in order to run for a bay or port as a safe anchorage against a storm. The Romans lost entire fleets to storms. Also, without radar, aerial recon and binoculars, even large fleets could easily miss each other in the open ocean, which is why there are so few open ocean battles in history. So Dany's fleet will run along the coast of Essos till it passes through the Stepstones, the Grey Gallows or the Broken Arm. His other chance would be to trap Dany's fleet inside the Sea of Dorne or at Sunspear and attack her as she is landing her troops. Another scenario would be Euron seeking to break a blockade of Blackwater Bay by Yara and Theon after they had landed Dany's army somewhere along the Sea of Dorne. Why the Sea of Dorne? Unless resupplied during their travels (another reason for staying near the coast), a feudal fleet could not travel for a long period of time, especially one carrying horses. Horses don't like sea travel and keeping them healthy for any period at sea can be problematic. In the 18th century, the British rarely tried to transport horses to North America, since too many died on the trip. British, German and Loyalist cavalry had to find mounts in America or fight on foot. Sea travel also was unhealthy for troops, between the lack of hygiene, exercise and the horrible food, regiments could lose 25% of the men they boarded the ships with. Dany would want to get her army ashore as soon as possible. That could mean heading straight to Sunspear. It would be difficult for Euron to intercept her unless he waited in the Straights for her to pass by, if she didn't go straight across from the Island of Lys.
There were essentially three types of navies in feudal society, each with its own tactics and ships, but in almost all cases, the objective was to turn the ships into a fighting platform for men-at-arms, infantry, marines and sailors. 
In places like the Med, the galley dominated. Long, narrow, light draft and lightly built, they could use sails for cruising, but their primary motive power was men at oars. In ancient times, oarsmen were free men, part of the crew and expected to participate in the fight. Slaves as rowers were introduced in the Medieval period. The galleys of this time never reached the size of some of the ancient ships, usually had only a single bank of oars with one to ten men at each oar. The galley carried artillery, stone and bolt throwers mostly, which with the missile troops using javelins and bows, were intended to sweep the decks of enemy ships, not sink them, though some fire projectiles could start a blaze if the other ship's crew couldn't put it out, maneuver their ship and shoot at the enemy at the same time. Ships were sunk through ramming, head-on or into the beam side. If a galley couldn't pull free, she might go down with her victim. A galley could maneuver to sweep across an opponent's oars, breaking them and leaving the enemy vulnerable. Whether after ramming or when an enemy was vulnerable, a galley would pull alongside and its troops, armored men-at-arms or marines would board the enemy ship and seek to kill or capture the opposing crew and take the ship. Archers and javelinmen would support the effort from the bow and stern of the ships. At a certain point, one fleet or another would lose heart and retreat or flee.
Some galleys operated north into the English Channel, but they were limited to coastal waters and only certain times of the year when conditions were good enough for them to safely operate. The main warship in these waters was a heavily built sailing ship, with one or two masts for square sails. They could be as large as a thousand tons measurement (not displacement) which translated to over one hundred feet long and a forty foot beam. While generally seaworthy, they were by design somewhat top heavy and when converted to warships with ""castles"" fore and aft, some what tender to high winds. Often the defending fleet, covering a port or a river mouth, would tie their ships together and lay planks across them which would allow them to reinforce the parts of their ""line"" under attack. The attacking ships would approach, archers and crossbowmen shooting across the water from the ""castles"". Fire projectiles might by shot from bows, sometimes light artillery, catapults and spearthrowers would be mounted, but often the troops would simply throw the incendiary ""bombs"" or materiel on to the enemy ship. Once contact was made, the knights and men-at-arms would engage in close combat and the winner would capture the opposing ship. Other friendly ships would join this ship and their boarding crews cross over to reinforce the original boarding party. Otherwise, this scenario would be replayed all up and down the line of defending ships. At some point, the attackers would capture enough defending ships and the survivors would cut the cables and escape or the attackers would admit defeat and draw away.
The third model was, of course, the Vikings, but other than not building ""castles"" on the fore and quarter decks and being able to sail or row, combat would be very similar to that in the English Channel.
In a sea battle between Dany's and Euron's fleets, Dany would want to withdraw her horse transports to the rear and push forward as fast as possible into close combat, given that neither the Dothraki nor the ""Unsullied"" have missile weapons (which is strange, given that every horse nomad tribe in history, even the North American natives, used bows from horseback). Dany might have better artillery aboard her ships, but her best bet is to get alongside Euron's ships and hope the Dothraki are as effective on foot at sea as on horseback. If she's landed her troops, then their place could be taken by Westerosi troops experienced at naval warfare, say Dornish infantry with bows and spears. The odds might be more even in a battle between Yara/Theon trying to break Euron's blockade of the Sea of Dorne or Euron trying to break Yara/Theon's blockade of Balckwater Bay.
Based on history, however, an open sea battle between Euron and Dany would be unlikely.",3,0,False,self,,,,,

What if Tyrion had not done so much whoring and drinking? My theory is that Tywin is intelligent enough to recognize Tyrion's potential as a leader, and while being a dwarf is like being a bastard, Tywin still would have respected him. He may even have had Casterly Rock. Tywin is portrayed as prejudiced against Tyrion for being a dwarf, but I see it as it was Tyrion's own vices that caused the rift between him and his father.

And a couple things stuck out again, and reminded me to bring them up on here:

During the battle at Hardhome - 

1. Group Swoop --


The Magnar of the Thenns has the free folk bar the main gate; he watches as the folk that didnt make it inside slam up against it, theres lots of shuffling boots and panic, but then... they disappear.  A few muffled gasps and a sudden, whisking yoink motion give the impression they were all swept up together somehow.  So the Thenn approaches the gate and peers through a gap in the planks, after a moment of misty silence a wight sprints up to slam against the wood, and battle begins.  
But -- what happened there?  The all-in-one whoopsie-daisy group snatching makes it a stretch to assume those free folk had fought and been killed in that short amount of time.  So was it supposed to have just been accepted as synchronized desertion on their part?  Or some kind of long-range sniper magic on the Others?    Any theories, answers, and/or something Im missing?  It bugs me every time.

2.  Whore Forcemen --


I get that the shot of the the Others ahorse on the mountaintop was shoehorned in there so people would gasp and shriek ""OhhhHHH THE FOUR HORSEMEN!  Of the aPOCALYPSE!  the BIBLE!"" etc, and if anyone in the room was looking confused, loudly unburden them of their ignorance.  This isnt the question, Im just saying its just kind of low-hanging fruit, imagery-wise.
It turns out, though, theres a fleeting nine-or-so-frame shot of another Other; he looks just like the one Jon dispatches outside.  (Could that have been a mistake?  He has the exact same hair, similar face shape, armor, even the same weapon.  It actually looks identical, like the same prop was used.)  Interestingly, theres a THIRD Other in the same shot, just behind #2.  Again, this shot only appears for maybe 1.6 seconds of screen time, and occurs near the end of the episode, sequentially just after Wun Wuns skeleton water olympics.)  Whats interesting about all that is that if no mistake was made, then all four are on screen, assuming the Nights King was one of the four.  Weve got Jons victim Other, these two other Others, and the NK.  
So, on to the question:  Isnt that bananas?  Did anyone notice that?

There's a good amount of changes in the show, some for the better and some for the worse as we all know. I actually thought they made good calls omitting things from the show, and maybe adding a few stuff, but there's always stuff that they'll mess up on. 

My favorite arc in the books is the Griff/Young Griff one. I was really hoping we'd get the see the blue haired prince and that would make great contraction to the show, and Jon Connington is such a interesting and complex character, I seriously loved reading about his character and such, and maybe if we're lucky they'll show him later on, but that one scene with Tyrion, Griff and Young Griff on the boat was so incredible, to me at least.

I was reading the top quotes from Season 6 on **WOTW** site and saw this quote. The line in bold stood out. Could this be a reference to Greyscale? Does the ""fish"" have anything to do with House Tully symbolically speaking maybe? (*most likely no*)... Or is it possible that the cure for Greyscale is a rare fish that exists in only a certain part of the world which eats the Greyscale (*dead-skin*) away? But if it's eaten away, than what happened in Shireen's case? So it must be stopped. Perhaps through application or digestion.

Highborn, but a bastard
Part of the family, but still apart 
In his innocence, he knew nothing. 

Never knew the love of a mother 
Abandoned at the Nights watch by his father, 
In his loneliness, he knew nothing. 

Marched forward to fight wildlings 
But was captured on the road, 
In his unfamiliarity, he knew nothing. 

He tried to stay away, keep his vows 
But a cave proved tempting, 
In his love, he knew nothing. 

Then in power, lord commander
Faithfully he served the watch 
In command &amp; still, he knew nothing.

Betrayed by his own 
Left to die in the cold, 
Even in death, he knew nothing. 

Broke all boundaries, life &amp; death
Punished the traitors, for their wrong
Braving all odds, he still knew nothing.

Kingdoms will never be more ripe for conquest than they are right now. A boy king sits the Iron Throne.

winter comes, the realm will starve. And who remains to deal with all of this, who rules the little king
who rules the Seven Kingdoms? Why, my own sweet sister. There is no one else. My brother, Jaime,
thirsts for battle, not for power. Hes run from every chance hes had to rule. My uncle Kevan would
make a passably good regent if someone pressed the duty on him, but he will never reach for it. The gods
shaped him to be a follower, not a leader. Well, the gods and my lord father. Mace Tyrell would grasp
the sceptre gladly, but mine own kin are not like to step aside and give it to him. And everyone hates
Stannis. Who does that leave? Why, only Cersei.
Westeros is torn and bleeding, and I do not doubt that even now my sweet sister is binding up the
wounds  with salt. Cersei is as gentle as King Maegor, as selfless as Aegon the Unworthy, as wise as
Mad Aerys. She never forgets a slight, real or imagined. She takes caution for cowardice and dissent for
defiance. And she is greedy. Greedy for power, for honor, for love. Tommens rule is bolstered by all of
the alliances that my lord father built so carefully, but soon enough she will destroy them, every one. Land
and raise your banners, and men will flock to your cause. Lords great and small, and smallfolk too. But do
not wait too long, my prince. The moment will not last. The tide that lifts you now will soon recede. Be
certain you reach Westeros before my sister falls and someone more competent takes her place.
But, Prince Aegon said, without Daenerys and her dragons, how could we hope to win?
You do not need to win, Tyrion told him. All you need to do is raise your banners, rally your
supporters, and hold, until Daenerys arrives to join her strength to yours.

Prophecy Theory",https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/50g0nn/everything_in_the_arms_of_the_woman_i_love/,Lockpick-Handgrenade,1472629222,"Heya guys, tin hat merchant here. With a new theory for you to downvote. Begin.

When Bronn and Jaime where sailing down to Dorne to confront the least popular plot point in season 5, they had a wuick conversation about how they would like GRRM to kill them. Bronn wants to die the least GRRM-like death possible, and Jaime wants to die ""In the arms of the woman I love."".

This woman is obviously Cunty... Cersei, rather.

And how is Cersei going to die supposedly? With her brothers hands around her throat. Its been generally excepted that Jaime would be the one to kill her, prophecies 'n' all that.

I think that when Cersei calls for hidden fireworks she loves to light up KL, Jaime repeats history and kills her. Instead of fleeing, he stays with her to be blown up Seven Sept Style.

He has said multiple times ""All I care about is Cersei"" and once she is dead, he couldn't care less about whether he goes Rhollor Akbar with her.


I actually like Jaime and love the theory that he will live to kill the Night King, so I hope my theory doesn't come true.


Sincerely, Lockpick.

Ours is the Theory


EDIT: I just realised it would be a bit difficult for Jaime to choke Cersei with his own hands.... Hands.
