Oona Chaplin is gorgeous and she performed the character perfectly, but Talisa's character felt a lot less significant than Jeyne Westerling. Jeyne and Talisa are very similar characters, but why make Robb's wife some random woman from Volantis? Jeyne's character made a lot more sense to marry, she was a daughter of the lord of The Crag. The lord of the Crag tried to marry her off to the Lannisters but they refused her marriage because they considered her too low of birth. Robb came along, the King in the North, and showed interest in Jeyne because she was pretty and made her feel important whereas the Lannisters didnt. And then Catelyn got mad at Robb for betraying the Freys by marrying a pretty girl from the Westerlands. Robb justified it because he said how he solidified himself with a lord of the Westerlands, but we know he mostly chose her because she was a pretty girl. 

Granted, I do like the change they made in having Robb's wife be pregnant with his child. There was nothing wrong with Oona Chaplin, but why didnt the writers just cast her as Jeyne instead of Talisa? ",10,6,False,self,,,,,

Who is he refering to when he says ""they killed his brother's son"" as Aemon's brother was Aegon V, and his son was Jaehaerys II, who died of an illness? Is it a mistake of the show by saying that Aerys the Mad king was the son of Aegon V or am I missing something? Because in reality Aerys would be Aegon V's grandson and Rhaegar who is the second death mentioned, would be Aegon V's great grandson, when he says the children I assume he refers to Rhaenys and Aegon, who were butchered on Tywin's orders. Apart from that, it is a great speech, I would like to have answer to the question above, thanks. At the end, Aemon says that Aerys II as the king after Aegon V, but that would be wrong, as Jaehaerys II came before Aerys II. Just something I would like to point out.

I figured it out
 
The Last Hero - contacted the children of the forest, learnt from them, and built an alliance against the others. Left with 12 companions on his journey to the children.
 
Brandon the builder - constructed the wall using CotF magic (supposedly to keep the others out, or to keep men out of the others lands), and founded house Stark.
 
The Nights King - 13th Lord Commander of the Nights Watch, and wed to an assumed white walker female.
 
They're the same person. He left with 12 companions, learnt of the magic of the children, constructed the wall, and named himself the 13th lord commander in honor of his 12 fallen comrades. He then constructs the wall, and builds an (uneasy) alliance with the other through marriage, as so many others have done since.
 
The Nights King has also been stated to be a Stark, and brother to the (at the time) King of Winter and Lord of Winterfell, Brandon the Breaker. Old Nan also stated to Bran in her story ""he mayhaps was also named Brandon"". I think, when he named himself Lord Commander, he gave Winterfell to his brother, Brandon the Breaker (remember, my theory suggests that Brandon the Builder is the Nights King).

Aemon Targaryen says to Jon Snow about Honor and Duty, explaining how it is easy to have honor when you are happy in life.

It's interesting to see the scenes that are created to reveal information about the future.

&gt;  ""Love is the death of duty.""

&gt;**Jon Snow** chose duty over love. His brothers killed the person he cared most about and now he's Lord Commander of the Night's Watch and may even be in large part responsible for saving all of humanity from the White Walkers.

&gt;**Robb Stark** chose love over duty. He married, against his contract, to the most wonderful girl he had ever met, and thousands died for it. Now Robb rots in the ground while Jon girds himself in as much honor as is available to a man of the Night's Watch.

Will the Children of the Forest be used as translators? 

What is their pupose? Who is their god? Are they gods? What is their religion? Do they age?

I'm hoping that the show helps us understand them as a people group to help sympathize instead of demonizing them. It'd be awesome if we were actually torn between who we actually want to win the war.

You think Joffrey would have let the high sparrow take Margery? Fuck no. They'd all be dead. 

Maybe it's evidence of good writing that I can swing so wildly with my feelings towards the characters. Whatever it is though, Tommen really sucks. I think the only person I dislike more than him is Ramsey.

I'm reminded of Walter's quote in The Big Lebowski... ""Say what you want about National Socialism, Dude, at least it's an ethos."" That's how I feel about Joffrey and Tommen.

Am I completely alone in this, or does anyone else agree?

""We always want the wrong woman."" 

This sentence is true in the case of several characters we've seen in the show. For example:

- Tyrion Lannister, of course, fell in love with a whore who wound up betraying him.

- Jaime Lannister fell in love with his sister.

- Robb fell in love with a woman that he didn't promise himself to.

- Jon Snow, a member of the Night's Watch, fell in love with a wildling on the other side of the wall.

- Joffrey married a woman who's family took involvement in his eventual murder.

- Stannis worshipped Melisandre who eventually led him into a battle he could not win.

- Baelish loved Catelyn Stark, a woman sworn to another man.

- Jorah Mormont fell in love Daenerys, after originally spying on her whilst plotting to murder her.

- Samwell Tarly fell in love with a woman who was off bounds, and marked as property of her father.

- And of course, Rhaegar fell in love with Lyanna. 


What could GRRM be possibly hinting at with this quote? Could this potentially be an important theme that we are missing in the show? Is it foreshadowing another upcoming relationship that could possibly be wrong for both partners? ( J + D = ?)

Similarity 1: They are both seen, within the series, as antagonists with immense power and a single common goal: genocide. Also throughout the begin portions of the series they are not primary antagonist, but an antagonist for later on.


Similarity 2: They are both able to revive their fallen enemies and further turn them into subordinates. In GoT we have Wrights and in ME we have Husks. Both of which are mindless and attack on site. I would speculate that if a Giant was killed by a Walker it could be turned into something resembling a Brute from ME. 


Similarity 3: They are both legend, but not believed. In ME, Shepard tries to convince people of the existence of the Reapers before it is too late, but is dismissed as warmongering. In GoT Jon Snow tries to report the existence of the power and scope of the Walkers but is stabbed by the Nights Watch and dismissed by the Lannisters in the south. 


Similarity 4: They both use the living to reproduce. In the ME series a harvesting takes place in which the Reapers, and their subordinates, collect millions of human samples in order to create one of their own: another Reaper. It is speculated that this new Reaper is the sum gain of that entire species. In GoT, Season 4 Episode 4 we see a child sacrifice be taken way north and being converted into a White Walker with a single touch. To counter this there is a theory that White Walkers and humans can mate. Just trying to point out possible errors in my logic.


Similarity 5: They both can hide away for a millennia. In ME the Reapers come and destroy everything every 50,000 years and the return to dark space. In GoT the White Walkers were last seen, before the series, over a thousand years ago, when they were pushed back beyond the wall.  


Similarity 6: They both seem to be superior in their own way compared to humanity. In GoT the White Walkers are shown to be: immune to the cold, not needing food or water, and stronger in most accounts. In ME the Reapers are shown to be way more intelligent and technologically advanced then their enemies. 


And the Wall is the Citadel


Similarity 1: They both have emotion. In GoT is stated that the Wall can weep and it is hinted out further that the wall has human emotion as well. In ME, at the end, the player learns that the Citadel is a version of higher level AI that can think and control things around it. 


Similarity 2: They are both great bases. In GoT the wall is considered to be the greatest thing ever constructed by humanity and serves as a great barrier between the 7 Kingdoms and the Lands of Always Winter. In ME, it is stated that when the wings of the Citadel are closed it become almost completely impenetrable.

 
Similarity 3: Their origins are wrong (probably). In GoT it is believe the Brandon The Builder Stark used magic and might and built the wall. I dont think this is the case, at all. If this was possible why arent their more examples of this level of magical ability and scope in the world of GoT. In ME it was believed that the Protheans had created the Citadel to act as their principal seat in the Galaxy, but this was later completely disproven.


Similarity 4: They both help their occupants. In GoT it is stated that the Nights Watch can use old spells and such and transverse the Wall it secret locations. If a code word is all that is needed than anyone would be able to use these passages, which would make them useless. In ME the Citadel, with aid from the Keepers, does its best to help new species acclimate to the Citadel and become part of their community. 


So my theory is fairly similar to the overall plot of the Mass Effect Series. The wall is the citadel and the White Walkers are the agents the Wall uses to harvest humanity. Just like in Mass Effect the Wall is trying to prevent the destruction of the planet and humanity from humanity by killing off most of humanity or rather the species of humanity that have become to technologically advance. The Wall uses is castles and tunnels to listen to what is going on in the world to determine when the White Walkers need to be awoken. Further the dreaded Long Night is a sense the Harvest in which the White Walkers gather their needed specimens while killing the majority of humanity in the process. During this time more White Walkers are made from the fallen foes and a single perfect White Walker comes into existence. After the majority of humanity is destroyed the White Walkers retreat back to Beyond the Wall allowing some survivors to live and repopulate the world with generations later claiming that they are a myth and a legend. 

Questions that my theory does not answer:

- How did the Wall come into existence originally?

- What does the Wall gain from harvesting species?

- Is this the worst fan theory ever?

It was a masterful let-down by D&amp;D at the end of the episode for show-only and book fans alike.

Does it end at that, though? Just a trick by D&amp;D, or is there more to it? What if there actually IS a wildling that saw Benjen riding North? Alliser may have actually received such information, then took advantage of the news to lure Jon into a trap (in the show). 

Benjen may actually still be alive. The rangers he went out with came back dead, and then reanimated. Maybe Benjen escaped, and tracked a WW. It's possible he may have even met a CotF along the trail. Sure, his horse is gone, but he's a Ranger and can live off the land if need be. If the wildlings saw him and let him pass, it would only make sense that they didn't kill him because they saw him heading in the wrong direction, and figured what's further north will surely kill him.

I don't really buy into the recent theories that he became a WW. I had a moment of clarity the other day when I saw the ""Best Seat in the House"" video which showed what looks like a flashback of Ned and Brandon. But what if it was Ned and Benjen? Would Brandon, which doesn't push the story much, or Benjen, give reason for Bloodraven to take Brann to that specific timeline in Winterfell? What if Benjen is alive and well, and Bloodraven is highlighting his significance?

They think they are just chosen ones (which they kind of are) by their Gods, just to talk to them and be their buddy. Nobody would think in the GOT universe that they're actually wizards. Everyone is religious, so that kind of power would automatically be credited to a higher being, not realizing that the people make miracles happen. That is why magic doesn't always work. These characters pray to their Gods for favor, and sometimes he answers sometimes he doesn't. I think, when they are really trying to make something happen, those things happen, like the resurrections by Thoros, the red priestess' dark magic, with the leeches, the fire visions etc. Their ""prayers"" would actually be spell words in a primitive form since they don't know they hold the power.

Because that gives 14 years between his birth Winter and the Long Summer. And, when you remove the 3-year winter that was part of the 'year of the False Spring', that give about 6 winters in two spans totaling 11 years. 

In a world where seasons are known to last at least a year or longer, it makes no sense that this man has been alive for 35 seasons over the course of 27 years. Especially when one of those seasons took up 10 years of time.

I kinda remember something about the prophecy of the chosen one (can't remember the name) saying they would be born among smoke and salt, and under a red comet or what ever. And I remember a moment which could be considered a ""rebirth"" which happened among literal smoke, literal salt, and under the red comet that is supposedly around in Westeros (not sure exactly what the time frame of that was).
That moment was in the battle of blackwater, where there was smoke and salt around everywhere, and where one of the characters had a pretty life changing moment, that person is the Onion Knight who saw his son be killed by the fire/explosion, and then woke up alone on a rock in the middle of no where, and went from King's hand to prisoner of the king short after (if I am not mistaken). This could be considered a rebirth.  

Another thing is, when Melisandre went to the wall, the only 2 people of importance she knew were there, were Jon and Ser Davos. And we know for sure Davos is alive, we don't really know for sure about Jon.  

Anyway, that is my partial theory, please give me your input on this.",9,2,False,self,,,,,

At first I thought the panel is going to be obscure (Saturday 10:00 am doesn't sound like primetime at all), but then I've checked the location - instead of the usual movie&amp;TV hall, I'm being featured in the main conference hall section, right before the writers invited there (David Weber, Andrzej Pilipiuk).

Sure. That's why there are photos showing Kit in Stark colors on a battlefield that isn't at the NW or north of the wall. Or reports that Snow was hanging out at Winterfell with Sansa, Ramsey, and co. Etc. Etc. 

It insults the very loyal GoT audience when the show does this. Can they not maintain a little mystery while not lying to viewers? Maybe a subtle wink at Snow's return without, time and time again, saying, ""Guys, get over it  Snow's truly dead and Kit's not coming back."" I just don't get it. I think we'd all be super stoked for season six even with confirmation that Snow's returning. We don't know how or why, and it's damn exciting. Look at the response the poster had.

And when they recast Rorge from Season 1 to Season 2 they got rid of the idea his nose would be missing (the actor in the first one had a prosthetic on with most of rotting away), so character designs do change it would seem (the most extreme being Daario--they didn't even try to make him look like the first Daario).

While reading the books I was constantly confused by this because in other stories such as The Last Airbender, fire is presented quite the opposite. Jeong Jeong even explains that water brings healing and life, but fire brings only destruction and pain. Fire is more life itself that needs to consume for whatever life is brought. When Melisandre brings life to the shadow it needs to consume the blood of the King. Even when Beric Dondarrion is brought back to life he says there is less and less of him that comes back. Melisandre constantly states that R'hllor and The Other are the only gods because that's what R'hllor has told her, but when Sam and Gilly are beyond the wall Sam makes a prayer to the old gods for help and when the wights attack, a flock of ravens come to attack the wights and only the wights. Clearly here the prayer was heard by the old gods and we've seen many other times of the old gods magic. My theory is that R'hllor is not such a sacred God as he seems more to consume life and broaden his praise. I would like to here more thoughts of this subject and more of the religions in the story.",3,0,False,self,,,,,

Many have speculated the video to be a part of the infamous Pink Letter, and that is very well possible.

However, is it also possible that this letter could come well after Ramsay would've sent the Pink Letter? Although it is a show adaption and still may be labeled the Pink Letter (though that may not work with the Bolton's sigil not being pink in the show), what are the possibilities of the letter being directed specifically at Jon, not about Theon or Sansa (fArya), etc.

""Winterfell is mine, come and see"". It is an obvious taunt, and an obvious threat, but the Pink Letter in ADWD was directed towards Jon Snow, Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. ""Winterfell is mine, come and see,"" may not be a statement to the same Jon, but rather a self proclaimed (or otherwise legitimized) Jon Stark, who Ramsay has heard rumors of gathering an army to take back Winterfell.",18,20,False,self,,,,,

* We see three scenes that seem to be related: Sansa running through the forest, Theon surrounded by Bolton soldiers (we can tell by their helmets, plus it makes sense) and dogs, and Brienne killing a Bolton soldier. It seems likely that Brienne encounters Sansa and Theon as they flee Winterfell and she rescues them.

* We also see Sansa looking beautiful and regal in heavy furs. The background looks awfully similar to the main hall of Castle Black -- I think she (and perhaps Brienne and Theon and Podrick?) all head to Castle Black, presumably to escape Bolton wrath and join Jon (who they wouldn't know is dead). This also ties in nicely with Theon's wishes from much earlier in the story to take the Black and be absolved of his tortured past.

* Speaking of Castle Black, I think we absolutely see Jon dead, we see Thorne trying to break into the room where he's lying dead (presumably to try and burn him before he turns into a wight) and we see Davos protecting the body, presumably for Mel to revive him. I think all of the predicted events will happen here, Jon will be revived and released of his Night's Watch vows, etc. I think that Sansa et al. probably arrive while he's dead (just so they can feel their hopes being utterly crushed).

* Armed with Sansa, Brienne, and Theon's knowledge of the horrors that the Boltons are inflicting on the North, and with an army of Wildlings that owe their lives and safety to Jon (not to mention, the Wildlings want to GTFO), I think Jon marches south on Winterfell with Tormund to attack the Boltons. That's where we see the multiple scenes with Bolton armies attacking Wildlings. I think rather than attack directly, though, it's likely that he's going to try and unite the North (perhaps in a campaign similar to what he tells Stannis to do in the books?) before he attacks.

If it's all true, it could be the first time we see Stark children reunite. That's actually one of the big flaws in the theory above; Jon and Sansa are the two living children who might have the *least* impactful reunion, so it feels awkward that they might be the ones who meet up first. Still, I think it's at least some plausible tinfoil. 

The best part, though, is that this is only a tiny portion of the scenes in the trailer! What are **your** predictions for the upcoming season based",7,2,False,self,,,,,

-The little clip where we saw Thorne and his followers breaking down the door was so them going to kill Davos and Melisandre because they will probably try and take Jon's body away and resurrect him and tell the wildlings that half of the Night's watched planned to kill Jon which wouldn't end well for Throne seen as there isn't a 700ft wall between them. If they are both killed at the wall, everyone else would think they died along with Stannis. I do think that Davos was making a last stand sort of like Barristan and I do think he will die after killing a few of them with Ghost. 

-The clip where we saw Brann looking at the Night's King was a vision but I think it was live vision where it was actually happening in the present and I think the Night's King knew that Brann was watching them almost as if he let him see his massive army.

-The Night's King may think that there are threats starting to form so he'll probably sent a few White Walkers to deal with Brann and The Three Eyed Ravan. So there is probably going to a small battle at the Weirwood Tree. The three eyed ravan (also known as Brynden Rivers), was the last known holder of Dark Sister, so he could tell Brann the give the sword to Hodor and warg into him to fight off the White Walkers.

That's some of my first predictions from the trailer, tell me what you think of the and what are your thoughts?",5,0,False,self,,,,,

Mots of the stuff in the first trailer is from the first episode as to not give away to much, so episode one will be dealing with the aftermath of the finale, Jon's true bro's (the ones that didn't stab him) scoop up Jon from the snow, Alisser denying involvment to the murder after being acused by Ed. Davos finds bruned Shereen 0:17 , confronts Melissandre and it turns out melissandre has a crysis of faith 0:25, and thats all we get for the episode led to believe Jon is really dead and everything is lost.

Episode two we get no wall, they leave us hanging for a bit more!

Episode three we get bran's introduction, Davos going to pay his respects to jon 1:13 , same scene some guys barge in coming to burn Jon not expecting him there, note no alisser in the scene 1:31, episode ends after the fight, im guessing the guys want to burn jon and kill ghost secretly on alissers directive, who denied being a part of the conspiracy, beacause he doesnt want to do it himself to not risk getting bad rep and not becoming the lord commander, there is no way two thirds of the nights watch being OK with a murdurer and traitor becoming lord commander, however he will be exposed, leading to Ed becoming the next lord commander but before that...

Episode four melissandre has a new vision in the fire, sees that it is Jon not Stannis that was in her visions all this time, she convinces davos to help her one last time, cut to bran cue the tower of joy flashback, back to melissandre with davos going to jon's corpse gets spotted by alisser, or whoever, maybe that little slut ollie and then tells alisser, who goes to stop her from getting to jon, but she already got in 1:00 , proceeds to getting busy with the corpse to revive him, davos holding them off, just as they get in Jon gets revived, end episode.

Sorry for my bad grammar. Its just a theory I came up with for fun hope someone (at least one person) out there enjoys it and gets something out of it. Also for the book readers out there you might remember Ed had a dream about being lord commander, and we know how much GRRM loves foreshadowing.

It starts with Jaime coming back from Dorne and Cersei staring at the sea and realizing that Myrcella is dead. Then we got Jaime telling Cersei that ""we are the only ones who matters and everything they've taken from us we are going to take back and more"". I believe that the scene with Jaime leading the Tyrell's army to the Sept is part of this plan. The Lannisters will need all the power and allies they can get if they want to do what Jaime says to Cersei and since Margery is still in the cell (in contrary to the books) and apparently she confesses, this is their chance to fix their alliance with the Tyrells.
Then we got the scene in which the High Sparrow talks about overthrowing an empire. Well, he is talking to a man wearing the King's guard armor so I guess he is talking to Jaime. He may be saying this to him at Myrcella's funeral or after the whole Tyrell vs Sparrows scene. I believe it happens at Myrcella's funeral and it's when Jaime realizes that the High Sparrow doesn't only care about religion but he has many other plans.
Then we have my favorite scene. The one with Cersei, The Mountain, Lancel and the Sparrows. Well, It seems to me that they are in the Red Keep. We don't get to see many of the surroundings but they are similar to the scene we got some months ago with Cersei and Tommen. So, Lancel goes there because he wants something or someone that Cersei won't let him get. 
The most puzzling scenes for me are the ones with Tommen in the Throne room and then Cersei followed by the Mountain and Qyburn (I think). I don't know what to make of them. it could be just tricky montage. Also, I can't think of any reason why there are so many people in the throne room. 

What do you think?

At the end of S4 it looked like she was finally going to have some agency then S5 started and it was immediately stripped away. This was teased in the trailer for S6 ""you are in the game now"" but since it was Tyrion who said that while Sansa was in frame there is no reason to be too hopeful, but it is possible for S5 Sansa to be totally redeemed.

Assuming Sansa finally gets some agency and uses it she is in a much more powerful position to influence the politics of the North and therefore the seven kingdoms than if she was say, betrothed to Robert Arryn of the Eyrie while a pretender with her name was married to the heir of the warden of the North. She can by blood lay claim to Winterfell, the Eyrie and now (by marriage) the Dreadfort. The Boltons currently only have one heir. If Sansa can engineer the deaths of Ramsay and Roose Bolton and Robert Arryn before another child is born she can lay claim to two of the seven kingdoms including the two most powerful houses in the North making her one of the if not the most powerful individual in the seven kingdoms.

When Tywin hears this, he asks Varys if his ""little birds"" can find their way into Mereen.  We find out what Tywin's scheme is soon after -- out Jorah as a former spy to Dany, thus poisoning their relationship.  You can very plainly see the sour reaction on the face of Varys when Tywin asks for the quill and paper, because the Eunuch understands the implication.  [Review for yourself.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q65s0h1rEds&amp;t=2m35s)

It makes sense for Varys to react this way.  We find out later that he's a Targaryen loyalist, so he would naturally prefer that Dany retain the two competent knights on her advisory board.  My confusion is, why is Varys beholden to Tywin's request here?  Varys is the Master of Whisperers, so surely he'd be the one to dispatch the raven across the Narrow Sea.  Couldn't he simply, you know, not send the message?  Who would possibly know?  It's not like Tywin is expecting a receipt back from the spies as proof of delivery.  I just do not understand why Varys is helpless in this regard.",22,25,False,self,,,,,

1- It required the death of Nissa Nissa.

2- It emits heat by itself

3- It is able to defeat White Walkers.

And we know three things about dragons

1- The current dragons only came to life with the sacrifices of Mirri Miaz Durr, Drogo and Rhaego.

2- Dragons breathe fire

3- Dragonglass and Dragonsteel can defeat White Walkers (and presumably dragon fire itself)

Is it possible that Lightbringer isn't a sword in the conventional sense, but is a dragon.

Theory two and seemingly more out of left field. Lightbringer is the Night's Watch.

1- You have to give up your family, metaphorically sacrifice your loved ones.

2- They somehow keep themselves from freezing to death?

3- They kill White Walkers dead.

Their oath even says it ""I am the sword in the darkness"" ""I am the fire that burns against the cold"" and ""The LIGHT that BRINGs the dawn""

The Old Gods are only in the North (and the Isle of Faces, isfaik) and even the people in the North don't seem to know about that place or the Weirwood network. On top of that, the rest of the Realm knows little about the Old Gods and follow the Faith of the Seven. Furthermore the Targaryens don't really seem like devout followers of the Faith, since the Faith doesn't like incestiuous intermarrying and they still seem to follow their old religion, legends and traditions.. at least, that's the sense I got from Rhaegar. He followed (isfaik) the old Targaryen legend of 'the prince that was promised'.
 
So... why did Bloodraven go there? It seems (isfaik) very unlikely that he knew of this place, let alone how to get there. It seems (isfaik) to go against his religious/cultural upbringing, and he had many other places to flee to during the rebellion - right? Also... I can see why 'they' would want Bran (isfaik the first and only person that can warg humans), what special feats did Bloodraven have - or was he the only one there (and the Free Folk aren't useful)?",11,1,False,self,,,,,

(BTW Thinking about Preston Jacobs your theta theory.
The fact that we see a silver theta in the prologue and a golden theta in the epilogue (all in season one) is hard to see as mere coincidence.) 


So lets assume that  we are in a post apocalyptic period and white walkers aren't evil but rather humans genetically engineered to survive post apocalyptic cold climate. That still doesn't answer the question why they are raising an army at this time. 
My answer is that the free folk are leaving and since the white walkers can't reproduce (they transform babies) they need people around them.
So the wall wasn't made to keep the white walkers out but rather to keep a large enough stock of humans in i.e. beyond the wall!
Mance has disrupted the status quo. Bloodraven knows all this but that still doesn't solve the moral problem of fencing out humans for the white walkers.. 
Still we get a clue to a possible solution and that is get rid of all magic. We know dragons increase magic  and other creatures with magic probably do so as well (white walkers) so bloodraven's master plan is to end the song of ice and fire  by having all magical creatures kill each other off in the final battle of ice and fire.

Basically feel free to downvote this topic, I just want this thread to be here for my future-sight abilities proof. I had this spontaneous idea when rewatching season 05.

I haven't read the books but who is this Aegon Targaryen character (the son of Rhaegar) ? Isn't he described in the books multiple times as he has surived thanks to Varys and is currently conquering some castles in Westeros or did I misinterpret something?

So what I noticed in the beginning of season 5, episode 01 when Varys talks to Tyrion about finding a new point in life and what westeros needs:

&gt;The Seven Kingdoms need someone stronger than Tommen, but gentler than Stannis.
A monarch who can intimidate the high lords and inspire the people.
A ruler loved by millions with a powerful army and the right family name.


That doesn't sound like a description of Daenerys but rather like a perfect well-bred Aegon. Danny can't seem to even rule one city, and she lacks the manliness to intimidate high lords.
Of course he cannot reveal his master secret plan at this point, which is why he leads Tyrion into thinking that Danny is the objective.
 
Later in the episode in the bedroom scene with Danny, she says:

&gt;Noone's seen Drogon in weeks.
For all I know, he's flown halfway across the world.

What if ""halfway across the world"" is fore-shadowing. What if Drogon is not a stupid irrational rabid uncontrollable beast and has not flown around aimlessly but has gone directly to Aegon because his inner sensor told him where to find him. In this case is pretty much exactly half of the known world he would have had to travel. What if Aegon is the one supposed to tame and control the dragons. That inner sensor of Drogon also summons him back to the fighting pit when Daenerys needs his help and later, at the end of the season, he leaves her alone again because he has more important business to attend to, i.e. hang out with his real master.

As we know, Danny is the mother of Dragons. Just looking at the title, what does it mean ? What would a mother be ? All she did, all she had to do is breed them, and raise them. Done, she did her part and is of no importance anymore.

Yeah I think that's pretty much it, obviously Aegon is gonna climb the iron throne sooner or later and Varys is the true master mind in this whole game. Obviously Jon Snow is going to marry Sansa and reign over the north. This makes sense because it is the least expected with Littlefinger still around and the fact that Sansa always disliked Jon. Seeing Varys and Littlefinger as rivals, and if Varys truly comes out on top as the superior chess master, then that would mean that Littlefinger will have to die at some point towards the end of the story.

Thank you, no need to read. I will link this unedited post in the future for some reddit gold

Season 6 plot,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/49xbkw/all_spoilers_theory_piecing_it_together_season_6/,WiseOldGoof,1457673940,"So we got a pretty good chunk of content, especially now that the trailer's been dropped, for season 6...So here is me piecing together all the clues to try and get a general picture of what we'll see in season 6. No need to say it, but for the weak minded out there, be warned for spoilers are coming! Keep in mind that this is, of course, just speculations and I cannot guarantee that this is true. Now, with that aside, let's get into it!

**Khaleesi &amp; co**

I'll start off with the storyline which totally changed in my view after I saw the new trailer... Dany's. At the end of season 5 she was overtaken by Khal Jhogo's Khalisar (correct me if I'm wrong about which Khal it was) and in the trailer, we see that she was taken captive and taken back to Vaes Dothrak. (Probably to become one of the Dosh Khaleen) Quaithe's guidance/prophecy? (""to go forward you must go back"") We also got to see photos of her riding at the head of a Khalisar, and of her standing before the Khal... I suspect that she will win the Dothraki over and come back to Meereen with an army of Dothraki screamers at her back. We also see Jorah the explorer and Daario Naharis searching for Dany... The big horde would surely leave a trace after themselves, and we see that Jorah found Dany's ring... plus we got a picture of Dany riding next to Daario, so we can be sure that they'll find her. Meanwhile in Meereen, we will see Tyrion trying to put things together. I think that we might see the battle of Meereen, closer to the end of the season, which was in the Baristan Selmy WoW chapter that was released. The basis for this prediction will be given later with another storyline.

**Flea Bottom**

Now, moving on to King's Landing, which will surely be CRAZY this season... In the first episode, of course, we'll see Jaime returning from Dorne and having some queencest with Cercei. Cercei, after finding out that her daughter died as well will go even deeper into her madness. Now, two crazy events are going to happen, but I'm not sure in which order. 1. The Tyrells will attempt to assault the Sept of Baelor by force to rescue Margery, and 2. The Faith will come to the Red Keep to arrest Cercei and/or Tommen, which will cause Cercei to ""choose violence,"" unleashing Ser Robert Strong on them. Now, back to Jaime... In one of the first few episodes, he will be sent to the Riverlands by Kevan, to bring them back into order. His story will continue there as it did in ADWD. So yeah, King's Landing this season=crazy/exciting.

**R+L=J**

Now, moving up north... Jon will basically be a corpse for the first, or first few, episode(s) of the season until Mel will bring him back. He will be taken to a room and the Night's Watch will try to get in to burn the body. But Davos will defend him and Mel will be able to resurect him... This will all happen in the first, or first few episode(s), since he will have lot's of uniting to do before the big battle in episode 9. Jon will proceed to unite the North under his command, whether he'll go by Stark, or Targaryen, or Stargaryen, or keep Snow, I got no idea. Then, of course, he'll have the big battle with Ramsay in episode 9 (or somewhere near the end of the season). Moving to Sansa and Theon Reekjoy, it looks like they'll be tracked down by a Bolton man with hounds, but Brienne will rescue them and kill him... I hope. Now, as to who Ramsay will be burning, I got no clue. But I hope it's not Sansa and Theon or Brienne or... yeah, it probably is since D&amp;D said that it'll be two liked characters. But it could be like Tormund or someone like that... Still should be sad though. Looks like Baelish will be up north as well, although winter is coming so at this point it technically could be snowing in Dorne by the end of the season (don't get any hopes though haha). Now moving even farther up north to Bran, we will finally get the Tower of Joy scene! Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! It'll probs be right before or right after Jon's resurrection... but who knows, right?

**Kingsmoot**

Now moving west, to the Iron Isles... Euron Greyjoy will come into the scene, and we'll finally get to see the Kingsmoot! Asha/Yara will probably take Victarion's storyline, as we see here getting it on with some exotic beauty in Essos in the trailer. So, somewhere closer to the end of the season, she will come to Meereen and crush the Yunkai forces. Dany will then come with her, with the Dothraki, to Westeros. But we won't see her get there yet. Highly speculative, of course. But one can hope ey?:)

**The Slayer**

And now for Sam! Him, Gilly, and baby Sam will get to Oldtown at the beginning of the season and we'll see quite an awkward family reunion. I got a feeling that we'll get to see Sam being a badass and Randyl's view of him changing. So yah...

**Valar Morghulis**

Now, moving back east to Braavos... we will first see ""no one"" being blind Beth, till later on she gets her vision back, and gets the assignment she was given in the WoW chapter that was released. Basically it... I don't think she'll run away from the Faceless just yet, as many do... but we'll see.

**Thanks for reading through**

That's it, I hope I didn't miss anything. What do you think? Btw, sorry for not mentioning Cleganebowl... I'm hyped up and sure it'll happen, but have no idea as to when.",3,0,False,self,,,,,

Please feel free to correct me on this, or any facts I get wrong while I'm explain this theory as I'm not 100% sure on all of them

Ok so here's a theory I've been tossing around in my head for a while. Something I noticed while doing a little bit of background research into the history of Thrones, as I was initially only a show watcher, and then started reading the books, is the beginnings of the major houses in Westeros, those being; Starks, Tyrells, Tullys, Lannisters, Martells, Bartheons, Aryyns, and GreyJoys. 
What I found, in some of the history I read is that none of these houses were the original rulers of the 'kingdoms'

We know that the Lannisters 'took over' from the Casterlys, due to the famous story of Lann the Clever.

We know that the Tullys, Tyrells and Bartheons came into power after Aegons conquest (from the Hoares, Gardners and Storm Kings respectively)

Now into some more obscure history.

It is said the the Arryns came into power after King Robar II Royce tried to rally the First MEn against the invading Andals, and one of the Andal leaders Serr Artys Arryn defeated him, crowing himself King of Mountain and Vale (later known as the Eeyrie)

The Martell house was founded in a similar way, by Andal invaders, although the founder of the house was not the first King. However when the famous Queen Nymeria of the Rhoynar sailed to Dorne, and wed Lord Mors Martell, and together they overthrew the larger Lords of Dorne, uniting the Kingdoms, and becoming it's official rulers.

The Starks have a similar backstory, being one of many Lords of the North, dubbed ""The Kings Of Winter"". Howevr they had many rivals, such as The Red Kings. However what is most notable is the Stark's conquest over the Barrow Kings, who claimed to be the original Kings in the North, dubbed The Kings Of The First Men.

Finally the Greyjoys. This is one of the hardest ones to really determine, as the Iron Islanders have never had a consistent line of Kings from the same family, due to their practise of the Kingsmoot. We can determine, however that the Greyjoys were not the most 'popular' kings, in this sense that they were not the most common kings. That title went to the Greyiron's and the Goodbrother's. However rduring the time of Aegons conquest, it was the Hoares who ruled (Harren the Black). After Harren was defeated at Harrenhall, the Iron Islanders chose the Greyjoys to become their ruler, with the supervision of Aegon.
 

Now that we have all the background/history stuff outta the way, I'd like to talk about my theory.
I think that there is a high possibilty that by the time that Daenerys invades Westeros/conquers it, there will, once again be a new batch of rulers, disposing of the older ones, just like the current Lords came into power.
We have already have evidence to support this, with some houses already being disposed of/being in the process of being disposed.

First we have the Starks, who have already been replaced by the Boltons.

Then we have the Tullys, who have been replaced with the EDIT:Peter Baelish. The Freys were given Riverrun, but not the title Lord Paramount of the Trident.

Now these houses have not yet fallen/been replaced but may soon in the future.

The Arryns only have one current heir, Sweet Robyn, and his death seems imminent, so one can assume power will change to another house (probably Baelish)

The Lannisters, after the events of the end of ADWD, and ending of S5, have very little legitimate heirs, and if Dany comes into power, I don't see her letting them stay on as lords of the Westerlands, even if a suitable heir is brought forth.

The Bartheons banner men are already split, those supporting Stannis and those Tommen. With Stannis' death at the end of S5, and claims of Tommens illegitimacy, there may be some dispute over who is the true Lord of the Stormlands. And agains, as with the Lannisters, I don't see Dany allowing them to keep their rule.

Now the final three houses (Greyjoy, Tyrell, and Martell) do not have any major problems currently affecting their houses, but their may be some contention in the future, especially with the Martells playing their long secret game, and for the Tyrells with the growing contention between them and House Lannister/Barartheon.
The Greyjoys just elected a new King, a Greyjoy, but with the dangerous game that the Crows eye is playing, that could come crashing down on him.


so thats pretty much the bulk of the theory. please let me now if any of it's wrong, curious to know of anyone agrees.

TL:DR version: none of the Lords of the Houses in the beginning of GOT were the originals leaders of their lands/kingdoms. By the end of the story the same will happen to them, with new houses claiming lordship over their current Kingdoms. We have already seen the beginning of this with the Tullys and Starks.",12,13,False,self,,,,,

I immediately thought of Doran Martell and wondered about his plans. Crippled by gout, and seemingly (to the Sand Snakes at least) indifferent to the goings on in Kings Landing. But he tells his daughter Arianne ""I have worked at the downfall of Tywin Lannister since the day they told me of Elia and her children."" Later, to the Sand Snakes he says ""I am not blind, nor deaf. I know you all believe me weak, frightened, feeble. Your father knew me better. Oberyn was ever the viper. Deadly, dangerous, unpredictable. No man dared tread on him. I was the grass. Pleasant, complaisant, sweet-smelling, swaying with every breeze. Who fears to walk upon the grass? But it is the grass that hides the viper from his enemies and shelters him until he strikes."" This line specifically speaks to how he's been working tirelessly, patiently, for 12 years, at the downfall of House Lannister, via his brother, Oberyn. Clearly he is aware what is going on and is far from helpless. The problem is, we only see Doran through two other people. His loyal guard, Areo Hotah, and his petulant daughter, Arianne Martell. We never get a look at his thoughts.
Which brings me back to my original question. What has Doran Martell been planning for 12 years? Was Oberyn going to KL his main plan? Or was it the marriage guaranteed to Viserys? If it were the former, then that's a terrible amount of time planning for about 5 minutes for it to go wrong. If it were the latter, what could he possibly hope to gain by marrying Arianne to Viserys? Essentially, he'd be the one helping Viserys, with no real effect other than pissing off the Lannisters for then allying with the Targaryen's. I was just really curious as to what the hell he's been planning.",0,1,False,self,,,,,

To set up. Sansa and Reek have escaped, but are being tracked by Bolton men. As per the trailer, Brienne finally becomes useful and rescues them both, taking them to the Last Hearth. Sansa already knows Rickon is alive from Reek and knows the safe haven they would of headed for is TLH. Learning of Sansas fate at the hands of the Boltons (and possibly a non-physical love interest between Sansa and the Smalljon) will be the straw the breaks the camels back, declare Sansa da queen in da norf, with Brienne offering her services as Queensguard, and march on Winterfell.



 
At the Wall, we know (trailer) Jon is dead, and his corpse somehow ends up apparently under guard by Davos, Ghost and NW loyalists, with the mutineers attempting to break in. Mel will resurrect Jon, killing the mutineers with the exception of one. Mel will place a glamour on the remaining mutineer (Thorne/Olly) to appear as Jon. As was the case in book rattleshirt/mance. We've also seen on the show via the faceless men, that changing appearances is possible. Jon/Davos/NW loyalists may become aware that Sansa is at Winterfell, and go there with glamoured Jon, under the guise of offering him to the Boltons, in exchange for support for the NW - but in reality, as a rescue mission for Sansa. It goes pear shaped as Sansa has obviously escaped, although the Boltons take the bait believing glamoured Jon to be the true Jon. However they take Davos captive as a Stannis supporter - who will likely claim he took the black after Stannis' defeat.


 

Back with Sansa, Rickon, Smalljon etc, they march on WF, and come head to head with the Bolton army, who burn glamoured Jon (and Davos - which is foreshadowed when Davos finds the remains of Shireens pyre) infront of the Umber/Northern army. The battle is in the Boltons favour, until the real Jon arrives with Tormund, Wun Wun and his wildling host, turning the tide of the battle and claiming victory.

Season 9, great battle between the Boltons and the Nights Watch and starts off great but quickly goes down hill.
Cue Jon Snow and his loyalists but it still doesn't prove to be enough.

Sam Tarly is in Old Town with the Horn of Winter, perhaps he arrives back to the Wall in time and notices they are gone and losing the battle.

A blow of the horn, a shriek from the dragon and decimation of the Boltons?

I strongly believe (and almost too obvious) that the table has been set for Ramsey to pull a quick one on his father. Now that he is a legitimate heir and Roose's wife is going to plop out the only thing standing in Ramsey's way, I think he is going to expedite the process of becoming king of Winterfell and perhaps frame Roose for something that the Bolton army won't take lightly. I bet that scene shown in the trailer is Roose, his wife, and child, being executed and the moment shit gets real with Ramsey. MMW.

But I'm interested in hearing what cities or castles people would be most eager to see make it into the show, even if there's no way it could happen.

I think my top picks would be Oldtown, White Harbour, and Highgarden. Oldtown I am fairly certain we will see (however briefly) this season seeing as Sam and Gilly are on their way there. Also, there are confirmed Horn Hill scenes, and Horn Hill is a hop skip and a jump from Oldtown. This is undoubtedly wishful thinking but I really hope Sam and Gilly stop by Highgarden on their way to Horn Hill and Oldtown; it's on the way and I am dying to see what it looks like. The other city I would love to see, as I mentioned, is White Harbour. I'm so interested in seeing what an actual city in the North would look like. ",32,4,False,self,,,,,

Plain and simple and I am sure what most of you would agree with me...White walkers are not evil. After Bran masters his ability to  control visions, he will start more and more to have visions of white walkers. At one point night's King will realize that, and intercept one of Bran's visions. Given that WW can not talk in human language, during the visions it will be possible for them two communicate with their minds. What he will start doing is explaining Bran that they are not evil and what is their culture...something completely contrary to what three eyed raven was saying:

They are not dead, and have a very well developed culture of their own. They existed from the ancient times and lived peacefully in the north. The war that occurred in the past was in fact the war between children of the forest and first man. White walkers joined first man and helped them win the war. They did it cause they need humans in order for them to continue existing just as the vision from season 4 showed. In return they were promised to keep land north of the wall as well as occasional sacrifices...They created the wall to protect the deal... and nights watch was created to make sure that the ""border"" is guarded as well as the sacrafice is ensured (people that are sent over the wall dont run back)(also when you think about....NIGHTS'S king- NIGHT's watch).  Now the deal is long forgoten, and less and less people north of the wall give their babies to them (only babies can be turned into WW and adults to army of dea), this is why they are starting to invade south...to make sure the deal is negotiated again, because they will die off and that children of the forest would be happy to see that and start seizing control again. 

Now after this happens...Bran will start the question three eyed raven and search for clues that this is actually true and finally realize its true...probably for the season 7. For the season 8 he will try to notify someone about this...and I think he will fail...
Good will probably win in the south, regarding the Game of Thrones, but I think that white walkers will be slaughtered...which will be the bitter sweet ending that everyone is talking about. 

Maybe just a wild theory but pretty fun plot twist that I thought of...had to share it :)

This looks like it's the real big battle between humans before the final one with the White Walkers. House Bolton and its supporters like the Freys are coming to end.

His father (I think Randall Tarly?) said that he was fat and cowardly and not worthy to be the heir to House Tarly. He said that if he didn't go and take the Black, he would arrange a hunting trip and kill Sam while making it look like an accident. My theory is that Sam's father wasn't actually ever going to kill Sam. I think he wanted to see if Sam was brave enough to stand up to him and fight for his inheritance rather than do the cowardly thing and run away. Even if Sam couldn't best his father in a fight, the fact that he would be willing to risk his life to fight for the right to lead the Tarly household would have been enough I think. It was essentially a test to see if Sam would take the ""easy"" way out (run away from home) or whether he would fight for what was rightfully his (confront his father in the forest and fight him if need be). Randall could try and force his son to get in shape but that does no good if Sam doesn't have the will or the bravery to do it. Thoughts?",17,2,False,self,,,,,

In Christianism, Jesus was killed and came back from the dead. As we see in the show, the transformation from Gregor is rather mysterious. Also, the trailer foreshadows that he will be Cersei's saviour. Will this mean that he will sacrifice himself (again), so Cersei can live? This fact could determine the result of the much anticipated Cleganebowl, where Ser Robert kills his brother, saving Cersei, after he already sacrificed his humanity by being made a walking corpse.

I don't consider this a theory, because it this symbolism might have been accidental, so it isn't based on the canon stuff. I hope I made this post clear enough so you understand what I wanted to say, and tell me what you think about it.",6,0,False,self,,,,,

Given the sporadic nature of Planetos' seasons -and magic use- it's conceivable that intelligent races have repeatedly attempted to gain a foothold in the world only to be wiped out by cataclysm after cataclysm. Naturally, plagues do not form in uncivilized lands. Plagues are a distinct development of cramming large quantities of humans and livestock into small areas with insufficient sewage treatment which is why there were so many plagues brought into the New World from Europe and no native American diseases that could ever be considered a plague by comparison. The standard, functional model of disease balances with it's host, in any predator-prey relationship the predator population reduces or increases relative to the abundance of prey, the predators never wipe out their food source. Similarly, a disease becomes successful by maximizing infection and keeping hosts alive to feed the microorganisms. A plague is a break from this model caused when a balanced disease jumps species, usually caused by constant contact and ingestion of livestock feces as in large cities during the Middle Ages. 
A Sothoryosi empire that collapsed over ten thousand years ago could have resulted in the natural or magical divergence from the Westerosi humans into the new human-like separate species that currently occupies the continent. It's also not impossible that the plagues formed in the ancient vast cities continued to exist in the humanoid residents either naturally in waiting carriers or enhanced by some sort of curse. Of course, the problem with this approach is that plagues are by their very nature self-destructive via killing their hosts; they need a constant supply of new victims to flourish. It's possible that there is still an active civilization of the Sothoryan humanoids in southern Sothoryos, where no Westerosi has explored in recorded history. In this scenario, the northern Sothoryans must be either regularly expelled from the civilized lands, perhaps due to an endemic mental disability explaining their behavior, or they are a tribal community that simply did not develop or devolved from the in-group due to cultural or religious beliefs. One of GRRM's primary motivations when developing Planetos was the European perspective on our world pre-globalization. One such belief was that the pagan religions of uncultured savages included devil worship, sacrifice and all sorts of sacrilege. Similarly, evidence points to a highly cultist system of belief in the remnants of Sothoryos habitation including several nods to Cthulhu mythos. ",15,32,False,self,,,,,
1114,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2016-3-13,2016,3,13,2,4a4in8,self.gameofthrones,[ALL SPOILERS] S6 Theory on the Martells and Dragons,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4a4in8/all_spoilers_s6_theory_on_the_martells_and_dragons/,JamesLonestar,1457802036,"My theory is that the Martells will be featured in season 6 in a way quite similar to their storyline in ADWD. Although none of the trailers or images released thus far can confirm my theory, I have two main pieces of evidence:

1. The Ironborn Kingsmoot storyline seems very likely to happen as we can see in [this teaser image](https://www.quora.com/The-new-poster-for-GoTs-season-6-has-just-been-released-What-can-we-learn-from-it) and the casting of Euron Greyjoy, which suggests that the Ironmen will sail toward Slaver's Bay as in the books, 
2. The ending of Quentyn Martell's storyline in ADWD (involving Daenerys' dragons) seems like it will be extremely significant in the long run for the series.

Myrcella's death in the show may actually serve a purpose other than shock value. Quentyn Martell has not been introduced in the series, which may mean that the showwriters want to send Tristane Martell to Meereen in his place. With his bride dead, he is free to marry anyone again; Doran Martell, knowing that the Lannisters are now against him, will choose to side with Daenerys and will send Tristane to try and woo her.
 
Side Note: sending Jaime to Dorne may have just been ""filler"" for him for the duration of season 5. It is possible, although unlikely, that the writers want him to end up with Brienne in S6, leading to the cliffhanger which ADWD ends on. Without Stoneheart in the show, it is much more likely that Jaime will just stick around King's Landing in S6, but this isn't impossible considering the 'resurrection' theme that S6 seems to be giving off.

Back to the theory: Tristane will continue his journey from Dorne to Meereen in the first half of the season. The writers might include his scenes from the book with the battle against the corsairs and sacking Astapor with the Windblown, but it is likely he will just get to Meereen in a relatively short period of time. Once there, he will find his way to Tyrion in the Great Pyramid (it is likely that Barristan was killed off to give Tyrion the role of ruler of Meereen in this season), discovering that Daenerys is nowhere to be found and possibly dead. This will lead to his plan to capture the dragons for himself. The rest should play out as in ADWD. I also think that the writers may choose to have the big episode 9 scene be a battle between Tyrion and the Yunkish forces that is implied to happen at the beginning of TWOW, in which the Ironborn fleet and  
the released dragons will play a big part.

I was thinking does it matter whether I read The Graphic Novel: Volume One or A Song Of Ice And Fire: Book One. I looked at the page details and the graphical novel only has 240 pages while the original book has 864 pages. Basically I have a couple of questions and if you guys could answer them all that would be great. 

1) Does the graphical novel leave details out or is it just because the font is smaller to fit in the comics? 
2) How much of the HBO TV series does Book 1 cover? Is it only season 1 and 2 or is it more?
3) How long do you think it will take me to read it?

I think the main problem is that people are seeing Jaqen H'ghar as the same faceless man from season 2 who helped arya escape from Harrenhal as the same one who trains her in season 5. So I'm here to make a point for them being different. If you think they are the same please make the argument.

Season 2 Jaqen 1. charming and cool. 2. willingness to brake rules when helping arya escape (killing more than what was owed) (telling arya she could use skills to get revenge). 3. fear of death. 4. he's an assassin.

Season 5 Jaqen 1. charmless/bore (and kind of a dick at times) 2. by the books faceless man 3. killed himself (no fucks given) 4. he runs the temple/ teacher",13,1,False,self,,,,,

Lets imagine Game of Thrones season 5 from his perspective, and Four as well. 

Imagine you are living a normal ordinary life for you in this cold brutal harsh city built and run by slave labor. Your father and you yourself do not fully support the acts done but you are a minority with very little power among the masters. Then one day a foreigner comes and conquers your city. For in the conquerors mind and words it is because you are like children whose thoughts and ideals are nonsensical and baseless so she must rule you for your own good, for your betterment. Your father and 162 other men (and maybe women) are soon rounded up and horrifically crucified for crimes against children, crimes and acts that he spoke against for their barbarity. This conqueror, this queen whom you now find yourself a servant, a slave to in all but the word did not know of this. She was not misinformed, or wrongly/falsely given your fathers name. No she did it because she did not care and randomly picked your father and the others condemning them for crimes they did not commit based only on their title and on their status. 

Eventually You as Hizdar are able to gain an audience with this self proclaimed queen and beg her for the right to be gracious enough, decent enough to bury your only father. Whom she wrongfully and so callously ordered murdered without a second thought because in her eyes and her word it was justice to repay one crime with that of another. 

You as Hizdar notice who is in attendance as you plead for the remains of your father, Westerosi men, a slave girl speaking in your tongue to translate for you to this foreign queen. There is no one of Mereen with her. No one who knows his peoples ways and ideals, their customs and traditions. 

Instead of leaving her to inevitably fail he actually attempts to help her for her sake and the good of his people. To ease the suffering and grief that she has put upon his city and perhaps because sh may be able to bring true change with her after all. 

For this reason he is treated with open contempt and hostility, judged, mocked, and belittled yet he still remains and still tries to help. One day in a terrorist attack upon your city by angered people that you Hizdar had warned would happen to this cold queen who did not care for your peoples wants, their beliefs if they did not mesh with hers. And in this act one of her own is killed. Just as so many of his people were killed. Yet he still makes the attempt to show he is sorry for her loss, and is rewarded yet again with the threat of death. This time this conquering queen knows whom she means to kill the heads of every great house, including yours even tough you are her adviser. 

So you stand in a dark stone basement that reeks of bones, and brunt flesh and thick sulfur and watch as a man you may have known, may have even been been friend  is forcefully burned to his death and torn apart by this strange queens children she keeps locked away like the monsters they are. Dragons. Terrors. And you watch and wait for you to to be burned, and devoured by these beasts the long night you spend in the dungeons. When the queen comes and coldly tells him that you Hizdar zo loraq will e marrying her.

If this seems eerily familiar to you, the near madness, the cruel acts, the murdering of innocent people and a force marriage by an unwilling and scared part dont be alarmed you have seen this before. 
Think back a few seasons to when sweet little Sansa was set to Marry Joffrey. 
Who executed her father.
Who placed her fathers head on a pike for all to see. 
Who made her look upon his face.
Who tormented her, who belittled her, her, beat her, and was ready to force her to marry him.
Keeping her locked away in an albeit nicer prison but a prison nonetheless where his family tormented her day and night. Just as dany and her family have tormented Hizadar. 
It is then on the last day of Hizdars life when he arrives in the arena after ensuring that everything will go as smoothly as possible for the queen. His future wife. Greeted with the harsh curt responses he has become accustomed to expect and receive from this cold queen. He there meets tyrion who is treated warmly a guest an adviser to the queen. The son of a man who helped to kill her entire family, the son of a man whose brother killed this queens father the son of a kinslayer. But he is accepted above you Hizdar zo Loraq because he is from the right country. The one with the right name. the one she cares for but knows so little of above your own Meereen. 
You Hizdar sit and listen to more humiliating condescending threats and cruel jests from your betrotheds lover, and from the queen herself and her newest adviser still favored over you.  

  Here is a quote from Season 5 episode 9

Daario: That one, the smaller man. No question, thats where you should put your money. The smaller man it is. 

Daenerys: Im not putting my money anywhere. 

Hizdar: Kings and queens never bet on the games. Perhaps you should go find someone who does. (politely telling Daario to leave his bethroed alone)

Daario: People used to bet against me when I fought in the pits. He would have bet against me. Common novice mistake. Ive spent much of my life in this arena.

Hizdar:  And in my experience, large men do triumph over smaller men far more often than not. 

Daenerys: Has your experience ever involved any actual fighting? You yourself? Have you ever tried to kill another man who was trying to kill you? (And neither have you Dany because everything falls into your lap with little work. Need an army to go home? Marry drogo, Need an army trick the stupid masters gets the unsullied (which would never, never, ever have worked in Westeros) need a bigger army dont worry Daario will magically fall in love with you betray his allies and brothers in arms for you. Need anything else done, dont worry, Jorah, Selmy Grey Worm, or Daario will do it. Do I need to pick up a sword, no the men have got me covered. Ugh) 

Daario: I got into the pit against a beast like that one, the crowd saw me, all skin and bone back then, then they saw a pile of angry muscles ready to murder me. They couldnt get their money out fast enough. But the pile of angry muscles never had any muscles here or here. And the big men were always too slow to stop my dagger from going where their muscles werent. Yes, whenever I saw a beast like that one standing across from me making his beast faces, I knew I could rest easy. 

Hizdar:  You dont approve? 

Tyrion: Theres always been more than enough death in the world for my taste. I can do without it in my leisure time. 

Hizdar: Fair enough. Yet its an unpleasant question, but what great thing has ever been accomplished without killing or cruelty?

Tyrion: Its easy to confuse what is with what ought to be, especially when what is has worked out in your favor.

Hizdar: Im not talking about myself. Im talking about the necessary conditions for greatness.

Daenerys: That is greatness? 

Hizdar: That is a vital part of the great city of Meereen, which existed long before you or I and will remain standing long after we have returned to the dirt. 

Tyrion: My father would have liked you.  

Daenerys: One day your great city will return to the dirt as well.

Hizdar: At your command?

Daenerys: If need be.  

Hizdar: And how many people will die to make this happen?

Daenerys: If it comes to that, they will have died for a good reason. 

Hizdar: Those men think theyre dying for a good reason. 

Daenerys: Someone elses reason.

Hizdar: So your reasons are true and theirs are false? They dont know their own minds, but you do?  

She makes it abundantly clear to Hizdar and those listening that she is more than willing to burn his city and his people to the ground if they do not conform and become the kind of realm that she wants it to be. She makes it abundantly clear that she wants them to change their beliefs, their traditions for her ever changing views.

Then of course because its Game of Thrones, tragedy happens. A large scale attack by the Sons of the Harpy and Hizdahr makes one final effort to protect his betrothed cruel conquering queen by showing her a safe way from the city arena. Only to be brutally murdered as the Unsullied guards leave him defenseless to protect Tyrion. 

As he dies his final thoughts and sights are of this cruel conqueror the dragon queen gazing at the man who had betrayed her to her Westerorssi enemies Jorah Mormont. Before looking back only once to leave for safety.  She cared nothing for Hizdahr who other than Mossador was the only two Meerense men in positions of power who were willing to support her in just rule. 

Go back to before Season 5 even began and Hizdahr was in Yunkai on Daenerys behalf to ensure her rule. 

Daenerys only wants peace, and she only wants to rule, and she only wants justice, and power, and trials when it all occurs non her own TERMS. No matter the consequences, no matter who it hurts or what may be best for her people. For all of her grandeur, all her speeches, all of her posturing, all of her justifications and reasoning Daenerys only wants two things in the end. Fire and Blood.

tl;dr
Hizdar and Dany's story is a parallel to the earlier seasons of Joffrey and Sansa. 
Hizdar sees the consequenses and repercussions of Dany's actions that she either doesn't or won't. 
Hizdar isn't really as bad is he's made out to be and  Dany could be considered a lot worse. ",21,2,False,self,,,,,

They, unlike even the most sympathetic of noble houses, seeks to turn the feudal system on its head. It is quite clear, to me at least, that the High Sparrow is utilizing religion is a tool to strike at the upper classes. The same upper classes who have, in their petty, pathetic competitions for selfish power, tossed the smallfolk into damnation and torture. Almost all of the main characters, for cinematic reasons, are highborn. We do not see, nor care, about the endless suffering and plight of the average farmer; the average tradesman; nor the average soldier, even.

As Robb waged war across the Riverlands, he invited the men of the west to rape, burn, and pillage, starving all but the wealthy. As the Mountain took the daughters of innocent farmers, our beloved heroes laughed it up in their halls and castles, dining on succulent meat and delicious wine.

The grinding poverty of the poor will not vanish; the cold reality of what has been done shall never go away. But, with the Sparrows, there exists the opportunity to upend the system; to punish those who so callously threw away hundreds of thousands of lives. Rather than have the faith serve as a tool of repression, it can finally be put to good use. A religious revival of the smallfolk across the continent, as an explanation to even the most ignorant of minds about why their lives are so miserable.

This is one of the reasons why it is such a deep and compelling world. So as an experiment Im going to try and use the history of the War of the Roses to make a few guesses at who might eventually end up sitting on the Iron Thrown (or what is left of it after Cerseis wildfire has done its work).

Therefore it is possible that the person that finally gets to sit on the Iron Thrown will look a bit like the eventual victor of the War of the Roses: Henry VII.

Henry was part of the Lancastrian faction, but he was an extremely distant relative with practically no royal blood. He claimed descent to kings from before the conquest by William, but was actually directly descended from the butler to the Bishop of Bangor who had risen to a position as a minor noble in the very provincial seat of Pembroke. However, he did not grow up with his family in Pembroke. After his parents were killed he was fostered by a Yorkist called William Herbert until Herbert was executed by the Earl of Warwick after the Earl switched sides from York to Lancaster.

Assuming that Lancaster = Lannister, York = Stark and Plantagenet = Targaryen then we should be looking for somebody that grew up in a Stark household, but supported the Lannisters in adult life. He should be a very minor noble, without a real claim to the throne and the seat of his house should be way out on the fringes of the kingdom. There is only one character that fits this description: Littlefinger.

There are a couple of other points from the show which could suggest that Littlefinger is following Henry VIIs path.

Following a brief exile in France Henry VII eventually mounted an invasion landing in Pembrokeshire with an army paid for with borrowed money (and what was Littlefingers job at court? Borrowing money). In order to get to Bosworth he would have had to go through a region in Wales known as the Valleys, picking up his supporters all the way. So the fact that Littlefinger has spent so much effort building up his strength in the Vale is certainly suggestive.

Then there is the fact that in order to get some kind of legitimacy, since Henry VIIs claim was tenuous at best, he married the last heir to the Yorkist line a lady called Elizabeth of York. The oldest surviving of the Stark children (Stark being York) is also a young woman, and one that Littlefinger obviously lusts after.

So if G R R Martin is setting up Littlefinger as a Henry VII character then there are some predictions that can be made.

1. The Tommen and the Lannisters (Tyrion might survive because he is in Essos) will be wiped out. I would expect this to be either the finale of season 6, or the big midseason shocker.
2. After the Lannisters are killed Littlefinger will be forced to flee, probably to Bravos.
3. He will need to borrow money from the Iron Bank.
4. He will mount his invasion through the Vale, collecting his allies as he goes.
5. He will also make some kind of political deal with Sansa in order to marry and gain the allegiance of the North.
6. During the final battle all of the other contenders will be killed. This will leave Littlefinger as the last man standing despite his complete lack of royal blood.",10,8,False,self,,,,,

First of all, we'd like to thank everyone for their great submissions! Hopefully we can continue to do stuff like this in the future since this one went so well. We had almost 200 comments in the thread, most of which were entries.

We have our winners in the best moments of season 5 contest! It was actually a pretty close race at the top, but our #1 post winning the blu-ray copy of Season 5 was...

[Surprised no one posted this one yet. My favourite scene is Arya, in Braavos, getting rid of her possessions, but then Needle gives her pause, and she hides it instead. Hold on, Arya Stark!](https://np.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/49ytrm/mod_raven_want_to_win_a_bluray_dvd_box_of_season/d0w8xiq) by /u/BluntTruths !!

Congratulations to /u/BluntTruths for having the highest voted comment in the thread.

The battles for 2nd and 3rd place were even closer. In fact as of 8pm Eastern the winner for the 2nd place response wasn't even in the top 3! 

2nd and 3rd place goes to... 

[Jon Snow executing Janos Slynt.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/49ytrm/mod_raven_want_to_win_a_bluray_dvd_box_of_season/d0vy0l4) by /u/teekkk !!!

and

[It is from the Hardhome epsiode. One White Walker attacks Jon, but unknowingly Jon blocks it with his Valyrian Sword Longclaw and then turns the White Walker into ice cubes! That gave me goosebumps! Probably the only time we will see a White Walker surprised. The whole scene was great, from the build up to the post ice cube scene, when the camera slowly pans away and the Night's King looks at Jon from above.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/49ytrm/mod_raven_want_to_win_a_bluray_dvd_box_of_season/d0vzjgq) by /u/ForgottenDude

I will be reaching out to each of the winners so they can get their prizes delivered to them.

Please note that if you feel your comment is higher than others that we have to go by what happened as of midnight Tuesday morning. The voting may have changed since then, but it was too late.

I am re-watching GoT and I'm at S3 at the moment. They simply don't behave like brothers. I would expect them to either have a closer relationship or to tease each other like brothers do.

As seen on screen, it feels to me like they behave like strangers. They are too distant from one another. 

The only brotherly moment between them is after 3 seasons when Bran sends Rickon with Osha to Last Hearth. Even then, Rickon expressed overwhelmingly more emotion than Bran.

Can someone explain to me why does it seem that Bran does not like Rickon very much?

How is their relationship in the books? I would guess it makes more sense for them to be distant because Rickon is younger .

Brienne: she didn't really kill Stannis because she decided to follow him.  She needs to serve a lord.  Also, Stannis had a plan involving ships  (the ships he let Jon borrow to go to Hardhome) so the Winterfailure was intentional.

Daario: he is definitely lying about his identity, and the clues in the show indicate a Greyjoy. It looks like the show is going with the Daario = Euron theory.  Unless they combine Euron and Victarion or something.

Robert Strong: so yes, Cleganebowl is happening but there's a twist.  Robert Strong's body appears to be occupied by someone else's soul.  So when Robert Strong ends his vow of silence, we'll hear the voice of....Tywin Lannister.  Which doesn't really make sense, but let's pretend Qybern switched their vocal chords or something.

I know some of you aren't really concerned with how the box sets look. But as a collector who likes to put my sets on display, I must say that I'm pretty disappointed in the way the media releases for the series have not thematically matched up.

I have collected all the Best Buy exclusive sigil covers up to this point. So far they have had this consistent matte colour and canvas texture to them. However for some stupid reason, they decided to change it up this year. All 3 covers offered (Bolton, Martell, and Targaryen) are yellow with a golden sheen, have a crackled texture, have the sigils sized smaller, and worst yet, have the standard brown spine colour and patterning for Season 5. Furthermore, collecting these sets have always been frustrating since they decided to do multiple sigils for each season. You never know if you are going to have to retread on a sigil because of your previous choices. 

I had the thought of going with the regular covers before all of this. The current season 5 cover is designed beautifully. But sitting on a shelf, they don't really match up. From Seasons 1 to 5 the spines are Black-Black-Grey-Black-Brown. The same goes for the covers. Season 3 had a particularly boring cover IMO. Why can't they make em all unique and different, or at least all black? 

Then there are the recent Atmos steelbooks. I think they look cool. It's cool how they follow a similar design convention (themed after the title sequence). I do have gripes with them though. First of all I don't think they are made to be put on a shelf as-is. Once the flimsy plastic slipcover and the novelty sigil magnet is removed, the spines of the actual steelbook come together in an interesting way. They seem to be forming the banner from the title sequence and it would be cool to see it eventually come together...that is if they actually continue to release them. There is no ETA for season 3 and 4 yet, and no announcements for releases beyond that. With their track record on the sigil covers, it makes me wonder if they'll abandon this. Another thing that is frustrating is that instead of flippable disc holders, the discs are stacked on top of one another and are tough to remove from the case. So if you want to get to disc 4, you've got to pry out all the discs on top of it. That was the dealbreaker for me.

I feel the packaging teams are butchering things all around from a design standpoint. I'd imagine if you're a stickler for these things, it probably would be best to wait for a complete series box set on whatever media format is prevalent at that period in time.",7,3,False,self,,,,,

It then pans and shows what I'm assuming is the wagon that Jaqen is locked up in during Season 2. One prisoner is hooded, one has a shaved head and is looking at the camera, and the third turns his head and looks to look at the camera as well (Arya's POV). While the hooded prisoner is mysterious and could very well be Jaqen, it's actually the one that turns his head that caught my attention; he looks extremely similar to the actor that plays Jaqen when he changes his face at the end of Season 2; maybe just a bit scruffier. I'd go ahead and say that they are indeed the same actor after comparing the two side by side. Has anyone else caught this or confirmed? If not... I'll try to follow up with some screenshots later. Not sure if this was intentional or not... I know sometimes they re-use actors.
See below to compare:
Wagon in season 1: https://youtu.be/Kc5Viaxj9K0?t=17s
Jaqen season 2 finale: https://youtu.be/WQl07-jP7-I?t=46s

Actor in S2 is Patrick O'Kane. I can't find any reference to him working in S1E10, however I can't find anyone listed for any of the prisoners shown in S1E10, either. Just compare the forehead, nose, mouth, and eyes. The hair is shorter, dirtier, and messy in this episode, so try not to focus on that. Sure, maybe they just look similar, but in this show especially, I don't think it's something to just shrug off. They love to place little clues here and there. This one may be a little out of the way, yes, but it's not like the showrunners didn't know who Jaqen was yet.... Why not throw a little tidbit in there for the hardcore fans?",10,8,False,self,,,,,

&gt;I am not regretting to have done Game of Thrones, but I have nothing to say about it. I didnt understand nor the show nor its success when I was part of it.

&gt;The experience was very strange, I wasnt affected by it. In order to like a role, I need to be interested in it, and that wasnt really the case with Game of Thrones. I was a bit overwelmed by the events.
[]
&gt;Why, in this case, did he accept the role? After a long and exasperated silence, he answers Between other things, for the money.

I don't quite understand the very beginning of the Ramsay Snow, Theon Greyjoy storyline.
I understand that Theon is being tortured by a sadistic maniac in Ramsay. That he is insane and has a history of this behavior, I don't need to understand him at all.
I need to understand the conflict from Season 2:10 through Season3:2.
I am just lost through the entire thing.

I get that Lord Bolton sent this bast. son to Winterfell to rescue it from Theon.
I get that Theon's men revolted against him and gave him up.
But the show does not show anything that happens or explains who has him.

Heres a few questions for the smart GoT watcher/reader.

1) Is it Lord Bolton's men who are at siege around Winterfell (S2:10)

1a) Is Ramsay leading these men?

2) Do the Iron Born men who were with Theon in Winterfell, surrender Theon to these men at siege around the city (its implied, yes I know but want to make sure)?

2a) Do they exchange him for their lives, or do they get killed and Bolton's men just keep Theon?

2b) Doesn't Winterfell get burned to the ground? Who did this? Boltons men?

3) Into Season 3 you see unknown men torturing Theon before Ramsay is revealed, who are these men?
Are they the same men from the siege?

3a) At one point Ramsay is seen by Theon, just briefly (maybe not even noticed) but he is shown as if he is just sweeping up. Isn't he the leader of these men? What is going on here, it is very hard to understand.

3b) Ramsay then kills these men he is obviously working around without conflict and helps Theon to escape. What is going on here? Is this just a similar story to how he would release women in the woods and hunt them then kill them? Shouldn't he be in charge here? It seems as if hes a servant not even a solider much less a leader as his dad said he was.

4) After Ramsay kills all but the last unnamed man that was chasing a freed Theon, the man mutters ""Bastard"" in a very unflattering way as to suggest ""oh its you!"", right before he is killed. But aren't they supposed to be lead by him? This throws me off, because Ramsay doesn't seem like the leader here.

4a) When Ramsay brings him back to the torture rack, he assumes the leader role and the men tie him up yet again and it comes across very different. Was Ramsay acting before and was he the leader the whole time?
Because, I know Lord Bolton seems to say his bast. would avenge Winterfell.

5) Is this all arranged by Lord Bolton and everything Ramsay is doing known?
Was this a calculated thing or was Bolton going to randsack Winterfell even if Bran Stark was inside alive and well?

5a) If Lord Bolton's men did burn Winterfell did they do it because physco Ramsay wanted them or was it command from Lord Bolton who saw a weak north after all the men left to fight the realm. And wanted to silently gain control of it.

Thanks so much for reading and answering.

&gt;In its original sense, a shaggy dog story is an extremely long-winded anecdote characterized by extensive narration of typically irrelevant incidents and terminated by an anticlimax or a pointless punchline.

Last time we saw Rickon was season **3** episode 9. Sure, Bran was gone the entirety of season 5, and is going to be a central character for season 6, but does that mean Rickon will make it? Does he even have a place in the story? Plus, his actor has aged *a lot*.

So here's my small theory about how it will all go down:


With the death of Myrcella, Cersei hits a new low. Between the Walk of Shame and the death of her two eldest children and her father, Cersei is losing it really quick. I feel she's going to be way more hot headed this season. But something will happen to Tommen, he will most likely die. And Cersei will lose her shit. She will go all Mad King on everyone. She'll remember the traitors in King's Landing, the people in the streets who threw shit at her and spit on her, calling her whore and maximizing her humiliation. She'll want to burn them all. She will give the order and Qyburn along with Robert Strong will almost carry it out. This is where Jaime comes in. He will have to repeat what he did 20 years ago. The deed that somewhat haunted and taunted him for years, he will have to do it all over again.

Something big happens, for example, Cersei gets killed, she gets mad and flips the 'board'.

We would see all the characters that have been killed off doing other things (drink, socialize, on phone, etc). While the remaining bigger characters duke it out.

I am also a big reader of the Game of Thrones and ASOIAF Wikis. 

Now, for me season 5 was a bit of a disappointment. I enjoyed it, but I didn't get that ""can't wait for the next episode"" feeling except maybe once. Even though I'm not a book reader I can easily tell the difference between George R. R. Martin's writing and David Benioff's and D. B. Weiss's writing. I could tell that season 5 was deviating a lot from Martin's writing and I think the show suffered for it. The show felt markedly different to me than the previous 4 seasons. Some things were telegraphed so obviously that they didn't have the effect they should have. Some things were substantially changed from the books for the worse. Sansa's and Stannis's/Shireen's storyline in the show being a big example in my mind. The reason/way Ser Barristan Selmy and Jon Snow died didn't sit well with me either. In general, things started to not make sense this season because the writing was unraveling. On top of the writing being of a lesser quality some of the acting was just plain bad in my opinion. I'm looking at you Sand Snakes. There was also some poor looking CGI that I would have preferred not to see. 

Now I know that they've mostly run out of book material. I just hope they listen to George R. R. Martin. I'd hate to see this show decline in quality when it was so good before. ",28,1,False,self,,,,,

Well, now I've hit a rut. I want to outline the letters and make it all fancy, but I'm not entirely sure as to how. The fact that the letters (and line specifically) are crooked bother my OCD and I'm trying to think of ways to hide it as I emphasize them with paint or something.

I also dabble in clay and had the idea of making a strip of clay to look like flayed skin with the motto cut into it and nailed to the bottom, but I cannot find any proper tutorials on how to do skin/wounds in clay and despite asking established artists for advice I get ignored, so I've decided to scrap that idea.

So we've seen the trailer. We know that the ironborn will be getting a decent sized plot. We know Yara-who-was-once-Asha will be macking on some exotic looking lady, and we know that there is a new main character involed with our reaving friends. 

GoT has not yet tackled the ironborn plot from aFfC or aDwD yet. For those not in the know [spoilers], Theon's uncle Victarion is a PoV character in a trip across the world to bring Dany back home as a bride, while Asha gets captured by Stannis.

But Stannis is dead, and Victarion hasn't made it to the screen yet. What's more, we now that the producers have a tendency to substitute characters when screen time is constrained: see Ellaria/Arienne, Sansa/Jeyne, others. 

I bet that the new ironborn character will be the Crow's Eye. I bet Victarion will be forgotten beneath the waves. And if I were a wagering man, my money would say that Yara will take over her uncle's  task of world-explorer and dragon-lady seductress, seeing as we know she swings that way. 

Is this plausible? Are you sad to see Victarion go, or happy for more Yara?",10,14,False,self,,,,,

Being elected Lord Commander of the Nights Watch after Jon's death, the first thing I'd do would be asking Jon Snow to gather what Lords of the North he could, him being half Stark an' all, to add them to our cause. I'd have a ship sent, from Eastwatch by the Sea, to gather Dragonglass from Dragonstone and bring it back. They'd be instructed to go through the major port cities of the Narrow Sea (Sunspear, Lys, Tyrosh, Storm's End, Myr, Pentos, King's Landing, Braavos, White Harbor, stop by the Fingers as well) to gather recruits if they failed with the original intent.. So as not to waste time sending ships down south. (I was about to say that I'd have them also gather wildfire from King's Landing, but if we're being realistic here, I probably wouldn't know about that.) I'd have all the passages through the Wall blocked and set the builders and rangers to work on building mini-forts all throughout the top of the Wall (in stead of rebuilding the broken down old forts on the ground). If you haven't noticed yet, I wouldn't be leading no blundering charge, it'd rather be playing the defense, not the offense. With such a massive advantage as the Wall, I'd abandon the thought of going up north of it for anything other than gathering wood from the Haunted Forest. Anyhoo, back to my actions... I'd then establish a new order: The Army of the Dawn. Unlike in the Nights Watch, members wouldn't be forced into celibacy and they would swear to serve not till death, but only till the end of the War for the Dawn... If they're still alive by then. Then I'd send ravens all over everywhere inviting men (and women as well) to join this new order, in our cause against the Others. Now, if the ships I sent were to come back with dragonglass I'd keep sending more for a steady flow of obsidian coming up to the wall. With a large amount of dragonglass we wouldn't really have to worry about the walkers. I mean, think about it.. The Others wouldn't come close to the Wall, knowing that we have loads of dragonglass to kill them. So our only real problem would be the wights. If we make sure that we burn more wights than they kill of our men, then their numbers will slowly dwindle until the walkers have a measly force. Then they'd have to either come fight themselves, which means coming close to our loads of dragonglass, or give up. Also, if the brothers that were sailing the ships found out about the wildfire when they were in King's Landing, and managed to convince whatever authority would be there at the time to give it to us, that would be a great aid to our cause as well. It would make burning off those wights that much easier. So yeah. Anyhoo, if we're REALLY being realistic.. I'd shit my pants.",15,1,False,self,,,,,

In ASOIAF we've already had very young characters getting pregnant, i.e. Danaerys at age 14 in A Game of Thrones.  It's already been made clear that Bran has a crush on Meera Reed as well.  And, throughout the whole series, it's been made very clear that the Starks are an important family, so keeping their line going would be something important to a member of the Reed family, a family sworn to the Starks.  What I think will happen is Bran will become entangled by the roots of the weirwood trees in the same way that the Three Eyed Raven has.  But, to keep the Stark line alive, Meera Reed will marry Bran in front of the weirwood trees before he becomes part of the roots, or before it gets too bad, and get herself pregnant with a new, legitimate, baby Stark.

Now fast forward and Stannis is now dead and many people think Mel misread her visions and Jon is the one Mel is supposed to be with rather than Stannis. To me it doesn't seem like Davos did much for Stannis in season 4 and 5 so it would seem that he still ""has a part to play"" that hasn't been fulfilled yet.

Tin foil time!! Young Griff is likely to be cut so that he doesn't confuse the audience. In the books, Griff has the help of the Golden Company, and is in position to take the throne. Last we left off, Vary murdered Pycell and Kevan in attempt to pin the blame on the Tyrells. With the Lannisters and Tyrells fighting, Griff will wait for the right moment to storm in and seize the throne.

In the show, we know the Tyrells will show up at KL in season 6. This gives the plot perfect time to turn the two on each other. Some are also speculating that the trailer may have also teased the death of Pycell and Kevan.

Meanwhile in Meereen, the Sons of the Harpy are rampant. There's a lot of speculation as to who's in charge of them, and I've seen a lot of fans suggest it may be Daario. In the show, Daario could use the Sons of Harpy to invade Kings Landing and take the Iron Throne.


Things to support this:

-The Sons of Harpy are playing a much bigger role in the show. A deadly disease is spreading in the book Meereen, and based on the trailer, it seems the Sons of Harpy will just take over this plot point instead. The Sons of Harpy could easily become the shows Golden Company.

-Young Griff is a plot device used to get Dany over to Westeros. Daario would easily fill these shoes by betraying Dany and enraging her to the point she comes over to fight him.

-Jorah has pretty much been merged with Jon Connington, a character close to Young Griff. In the show, Jorah teams up with Daario to search for Dany. The two will likely find Dany. If Daario really wants to take the throne, he knows Dany is a direct threat and won't want her running about. By finding Dany, Daario will ""rescue"" her so that he can betray her and then reveal his plans to invade KL.  Its possible that Daario could either kidnap, kill, or gain the support of Jorah in order to further give Dany a bigger reason to eventually go to KLs. 


Points Against:

-Where does Varys stand in all this? Is he going to help the Sons of Harpy or will he help Dany sit on the throne. This could go either way, but if Kevan and Pycell are infact murdered, it shows he does have some master plan in the show. The book Varys will likely be exposed and killed by Dany, so by siding with the Sons of Harpy, this could create a scenario where TV Dany kills book Varys.

-What if LF takes the throne in place of Young Griff? I've seen this a lot for some reason. LF does have a mysterious plan, that leaves many fans puzzled as to what he plans to do. LF finger would not be a good replacement for Young Griff as LF would not be used as a plot device to push Dany to Westeros. She doesn't even know him. Someone close to here like Daario would be.

I am not sure how could a wildling be sure of this fact that red star appears only when dragon is born or hatch.

We have seen that red star is visible from any part of game of thrones continent, which means it can be seen from north, beyond the wall.

Consider this fact that Osha is right and red star appears only when dragons are born then when did wildlings see this star, last time red start appeared when Aegon VI was conceived 20 year back. 

Now for a moment we think Aegon VI is not the price that was promised and he is just another Targaryen, then why did this red start appear? may be dragon was born that time, Where? may be somewhere in north, so that wildling knows red star is omen of dragon (Ice dragon) and it can be seen from any part of GOT world Rhaegar thought that his son is prince that was promised .

Many posts say there is connection between ice dragon and white walkers. If that is true then white walker gain power or return because of ice dragon 20 year ago, That is why it was mention in s05e08 that Mance Rayder was gathering whildling for last 20 years to cross that Wall running away from White walkers.

I realize that we watched her when Tommen was growing closer to Margery and when Myrcella was taken away to Dorne, but we didn't see how she reacted before Joffrey started growing up.

There was a scene I was thinking of, about her reminiscing on how ""jolly"" Joff was, how he was her whole world. Did she start becoming more manipulative after she didn't have her first-born so close to her, physically and emotionally? I was thinking she suddenly didn't have this person who loved her unconditionally anymore; Tywin didn't see her for what she wanted him to, it was wrong for her and Jamie to be together, Robert preferred Lyanna over her, etc. Cersei has never had that level of love before, which is why I think she'll do anything for her children.

That the faceless men (including Arya) aren't just assassins, they are Warg's. 

- This would explain part of the reasoning behind Arya's blindness (why bother with eyesight), in fact her blindness vaguely mimics Bran during his warg sessions. 

- Arya, like many of the Starks has had moments dabbling in warg abilities. 

- This would explain how the faceless men are able to change their appearances and manage their hits. Which is more likely; that they change appearance and assume the life of a new local which would garner attention, or that they warg into an existing person that they have learned to be through ""the game of faces""


If this is true does this mean the hall of faces (is that's what it's called?) is actually just a series of portals into the lives of thousands?

Although my conclusion is not original, I think my reasons and evidence are.  I believe the Harpy to be Daario.

The first allusion to this is from this scene in S04E01 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj78lAnjJNs
Daario gives Dany a flower called Harpy's Gold and states that it is both beautiful and yet deadly.  

The next piece comes from S04E07 in this scene https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr6EkLH3MQ0
Daario again brings Dany flowers.  He also states that his only talents are fighting and women.

The first scene is used as only as foreshadowing. But I believe that Daario is growing bored in Meereen.  In the second scene he finally gets what he wants, a fight.  But that is quickly taken from him and his mission becomes a diplomatic one instead.  At this time in the story the fighting pits, which Daario is an advocate for, are still decreed to remain closed.  It is not long after his mission that the SotH emerge in Meereen.  I think his visit to Yunkai went as such.  The masters there paid Daario to start an uprising in Meereen and cause unrest in the city.  Why would he agree to this?  Because he wants to fight.  If the uprising causes Dany to die or give up in the free cities and flee, he will become a rich and powerful player in the free cities.  If the uprising causes Dany to unleash her fury, he can still remain on her side, the wining side, whilst also getting the fight he's been craving for.  

This also brings me to the book prophecy that Dany will be betrayed by blood, love, and gold.  The blood betrayal was from the witch lady who killed her child and sent Khal into a comatose state.  The love betrayal was Jorah, he loved her but yet betrayed her.  Daario is the gold.  He is a sell sword, the flower is the Harpy's gold, he is the Harpy who betrays her for the gold from Yunkai, and the SotH wear goild masks.  

Pair this with the other points brought up like how he knew where the SofH was hiding in the wall, and I think it is very clear that he is the Harpy.  ",27,31,False,self,,,,,

the first is that GRRM hasn't written anything in the series so far that leads me to believe any character is going to get a clear cut super-hero triumph. i find it very hard to believe that jon will rise from the ashes to become Neo. five books deep and there is not one thing to suggest that the series is going to narrow down to a single protagonist. view points are added faster than erased. and GRRM writes in shades of grey, not black and white. i think jon's conflicts with the night's watch only become more interesting if he wakes to find himself still tethered to the black. i could be completely wrong about this. GRRM may actually still be building up to a clear cut super-hero happy ending to trick us all. but...

secondly, and more importantly, it's not within jon's character to turn his back on his vows just because he wasn't breathing for a bit. that's not who ned raised. that's not who jon is. the jon i know would be highly suspect of what actually happened. was he really dead? was he sleeping? did mel bring him back? was it the old gods? the new? IT DOESN'T MATTER. why? because i'm the lord commander of the night's watch. i have seen what's north of the wall. winter is coming. 

yes, i am the sword in the darkness. i am also the light that brings the dawn. 

too much is made of the part of the vow that says ""it shall not end until my death"". don't forget the last of the vows... ""i pledge my life and honor the night's watch, for this night and ALL NIGHTS TO COME"". as long as there is night, the jon i know will choose to wear the black",17,6,False,self,,,,,

The prologue to ACOK goes over the Stannis/Melisandre scenes from S2E1. It mentions the ruby around her neck a lot while describing her. The scene where Cressen tries to poison Melisandre he drinks the cup he poisons, and dies. However Melisandre, oddly, is unfazed after finishing the cup.'

She says ""The night is dark and fool of terrors old man, but the fire burns them all away"" and if you pay attention to the ruby around her neck it begins to pulsate and glow red. 

Pretty cool minor touch they added that tips you off to some of her power and insight. She knew all along he was going to try to assassinate her. 

I've always wondered how she survived this. Later in the book.

""Danger to her own person was the first thing she learned to see, back when she was still half a child, a slave girl bound for life to the great red temple. It was still the first thing she looked for whenever she gazed into a fire.""

The theory is that the war between the great houses of Westeros will end up with all of them dead, every single major house. House Stark is pretty much dead. There are individual Starks still alive, but Stark as a house is in ruins. House Tully has been defeated and likely won't return to power. Hose Lannister is on the verge of destruction with Jaime and Cersei pretty much being heads of the House. Tommen is incompetent (and honestly is there anyone who believes he will live?) so that only leaves Kevan Lannister, but I think we are seeing House Lannister suffering the same fate as so many other Houses. 

House Frey is likely doomed due to Walder Freys sacrelige. House Baratheon is more or less gone completely with Stannis dead (I can't think of a single living member?). House Arryn is under Petyr Baelish control so no real member of the house has any real authority. Daenerys is the only living member of House Targeryen (if you count out the R+L=J theory). House Tyrell is still pretty powerful but I feel like we are witnessing the start of their downfall in Kings Landing. House Bolton really feels like a house that will get completely wiped out sooner or later and there is the Roose Bolton/Rat Cook theory which could mean the House would die if he did. 

This still leaves some major houses, House Dorne for example but they could be on the brink of war with the Lannisters (could it be what exterminates both houses?) and there are some holes in the thoery but isn't it a reasonable theory considering to what we have seen/read so far? Very many houses have suffered A LOT. ",14,1,False,self,,,,,

[**RHAEGAR TARGARYEN**]

How does a bastardmaker, orphan, lover of whores and the Stormlands, dropped in the 

middle of a

pretty rotten plot in the south-Targaryen province

Sovereign, in power

Grow up to be a zero and a drunkard?

[**JAIME LANNISTER**]

The big brawler, cheated father without a bother

Got a lot larger by drinking a lot harder

Being a drunk dick marred her

Made it really hard to guard her

By sixteen, they placed him in charge when his father faltered

[**BALON GREYJOY**]

And every day while I had slaves slaughtered and carted

Away across the waves, he chuckled and smashed my shit up

Inside, I was longing for a kingdom to be a part of

My brothers were ready to raid, steal, pillage, or martyr

[**HOSTER TULLY**]

Then Aerys' moment came, and conflagrations maimed

Our man saw his fianc take, taken far away

Got a hammer from his mantle, applied it directly to their brains

And he lost all his restraint, a testament to his pain

[**RENLY BARATHEON**]

Well, the word got around, they said, They got his dame, man

Shook up a rebellion just to send him to the Crownlands

Get your bloody vengeance, stop banging other girls (for shame), and

The world is gonna know your name. Whats your name, man?

[**BARATHEON**]

KingRobert Baratheon

My name is KingRobert Baratheon 

And theres a couple Targs that tried to run

But just you wait, just you wait...

[**CERSEI LANNISTER**]

Back at Storm's End his father ate shit, sunk battleship, storms-hittin'

Three years later, see Rob and his Stark girl tourney-sittin'

Harrenhal, princes makin' their own picks, tension thick

[**SMALL COUNCIL**]

And Rhaegar went away but Robert won't forget

[**NED STARK**]

Moved in on my brethren, the madman committed homicide

Left me nothin but victimized, I'm next in line

A command saying


[**SMALL COUNCIL**]

Jon, give me Rob or else

[**JON ARRYN**]

I started retreatin and raisin every banner on the shelf

[**RHAEGAR TARGARYEN**]

There would have been plenty of days of worry

for someone with less fury

He woulda been dead or dragon curry

Without the help of The Eyrie

Started workin, smirking at his late father's liege lord

Bummin Summerhall and Gulltown and all the dissent he cant ignore

Scammin for every ally he can get some hands from

Plannin for the Tyrells see him now as he stands on

The top of a castle facing the Stormlands

At Storm's End he says ""don't make a move Stan

[**SMALL COUNCIL**]

At Storm's End you can

[**BARATHEON**]

Just you wait

[**SMALL COUNCIL**]

just starve Stan

At Storm's End you can

[**BARATHEON**]

Just you wait


[**SMALL COUNCIL**]

just starve Stan 

At Storm's End you can just starve Stan.

At Storm's End, Storm's End

[**'BARATHEON**]

Just you wait!


[**SMALL COUNCIL**]

KingRobert Baratheon

We are waiting in the Keep for you

You could never back down

You never learned to take your time!

Oh, KingRobert Baratheon

When Westeros kneels for you

Will they know how much you drank?

Will they know about Gregor Clegane?

The world will never be the same, oh

[**THE HOUND**]

The kid is the usurper now

See if you can spot him

Another Meryn Trant

Fookin up what he had gotten

His hedonism destroyed his rep

Westeros forgot him	


[**SMALL COUNCIL**]

Just you wait

[**ALL**]

Just you wait
 
[**AERYS, BALON &amp; RHAEGAR**]

We fought with him

[**JON AND NED**]

Me? I died for him

[**STANNIS BARATHEON**]

Me? I trusted him

[**CERSEI LANNISTER**]

Me? I ""loved"" him

[**ERRANT BOAR**]

And me? Im the big pig that gored him!

[**ALL**]

Theres a couple Targs I havent found

But just you wait!

[**ERRANT BOAR**]

Whats your name, man?

[**ALL**]

KingRobert Baratheon!

Now, I'll grant her a mulligan on the first one.  She's a kid, she's confused, she's scared, etc... so maybe she names The Tickler because she doesn't think Jaqen will do it anyway.

But once The Tickler dies??  Name TYWIN.  Or Joffrey!  Why not Cersei?  The show/books would have gotten really wild if Cersei was suddenly no longer at Joffrey's side to keep him slightly in-check.

It doesn't matter that I know what's ahead for these various possible targets (doing a full series rewatch right now) - I'm still finding myself utterly infuriated by Arya.  One dead Tywin could have saved her a crapton of heartbreak**

List and Scoring structure.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4bncci/all_spoilers_season_6_death_pool_list_and_scoring/,ghostchief,1458752150,"A post by /u/yossixbean11 inspired me to try and think about how to format a death poll for this show. Bear with me.. 

So firstly, we need to deal with people cheating or knowing things ahead of time. I think the best way to go about this is to not only guess *if* someone will die, but what *episode* it happens. Selections must be made by the beginning of episode one. Also, don't cheat! That's a good ground rule. 

Realistically, important characters will get added to the fold or return (HYPE) to the mix. The ground rule should be: as soon as someone appears to be of importance, they are added to the pool and everyone's guesses for the outcome of their life this season should be entered by the airing of the next episode or else they miss out.

**SCORING** The most important aspect of all this. Think golf scoring; every episode you are off by with your guess is a *stroke.* The best score possible is a ZERO. The worst score possible is the total number of characters we end with times 10. 

Here are the possibilities:


1) You guess HE/SHE LIVES (through to next season)

You're *RIGHT?* ---&gt; **0 POINTS** (That's good!)

You're *WRONG?* ---&gt; **10 POINTS** (You fucked up hard!)

2) You guess HE/SHE DIES IN EP. (#)

You nailed it? ---&gt; **0 POINTS**

You were off by (over/under, doesn't matter) 2 episodes? ---&gt; **2 POINTS** (Not bad!)

They live to see Season 7? ---&gt; **10 POINTS** (Bittersweet!)


Lowest score at the end of it all wins. You will definitely need an Excel spreadsheet depending on how many characters you want to include.

Here is my list. Let me know if I missed any fun or important ones:


**Starks:**

Arya

Sansa

Bran

Rickon


**Lannisters:**

Tyrion

Cersei

Jaime

Tommen

Lancel

Kevan


**Tyrell:**

Margaery

Loras 

Olenna 

Mace 


**Greyjoy:**

Theon/Reek

Balon

Asha 


**Bolton:**

Roose

Ramsay

Walda 

Roose Jr. 


**The Wall:**

Jon

Davos

Melisandre

Tormund 

Ghost

Edd 

Olly 

Allister

Wun Wun 


**Essos:**

Daenerys

Jorah

Daario

Varys

Grey Worm

Missandei

Drogon 

Viserion 

Rhaegal 


**King's Landing:**

High Sparrow

Robert Strong 

Maester Pycelle 

Maester Qyburn 

Setpa Unella 


**Dorne:**

Ellaria

Doran 

Trystane

Obara Sand 

Tyene Sand 

Nymeria Sand 

Areo Hotah


**Oot n' Aboot:**

Littlefinger

Bronn

Brienne

Samwell

Pod

Gilly

Sam Jr 

Hodor

Meera 

Osha 

Robin 

Hound 

Walder Frey

Summer 

Shaggydog 

Night's King



Including things like the direwolves also makes me think it might be fun to guess at other non-death events happening (the Wall falls, Arya returns to Westeros, Bran wargs a WW, etc.) Let me know if this is cool or makes any sense and share your ideas! 


EDIT: Got rid of the notes I had written for my friends, because everyone on this sub knows this list inside and out.

It bothers me that everyone I talk to about the show assumes Stannis is dead without question. We didn't actually see him die though and if he is indeed dead what's the point of keeping that scene from us? It's seems unlike like D&amp;D to keep a visual death shot from the audience, especially when its a character who's been essential to the plot for the past 4 seasons. 

All I'm saying is that if a character is gone for good the death usually happens on screen. I think its extremely plausible to assume that Stannis is still alive... or am i just crazy?

Yes, despite no Stephen Dillane sightings on set and the actor himself stating a recent interview that Stannis was dead (while saying he was not in the least interested the all the internet ""noise""), despite the S5 beautiful death poster, despite the episode Director and all fellow cast members saying he was dead or gone and anything else for that matter suggesting his final demise - despite all of this I still hope. 

&amp;nbsp;

All I have to offer you a motley collection of perhaps. Perhaps Brienne did not kill Stannis (she did appear to have one hmm, wait a second moment after Stannis said Go on, do your duty, before angrily swinging her sword into the cutaway). Perhaps no one can find his corpse (because there isnt one). Perhaps this is why Dillane was not present or cast for Season 6 because he wasnt in it  but will make a triumphant return in Season 7. Perhaps it will be left hanging based on the known twist by GRRM involving a show character everyone thinks dead.

in parallel, i believe the writers are trying to write sansa as little finger's apprentice -- albeit more obliquely. she is learning his trade, using him for her own goals, and he's using her in return. at this point she is much more his partner/student than his victim. here's a quote from the writers:

&gt;Benioff also provided some thoughts on why Sansa chose to go along with Littelfingers scheme. Sansa started as such a naive innocent, he said. Shes been traumatized by what shes seen and she spent almost a couple years in shell shock. At a certain point shes either going to die or survive and become stronger. Shes chosen the latter option and shes learned from an incredibly devious teacher in Littlefinger. The interesting thing about Littlefinger is he seems to have no almost no weaknesses aside from his affection for Sansa. Hes been obsessed with her since that early episode at the joust.

&gt;When I noted that its surprising Littlefinger would give up Sansa to another man, Benioff replied, Thats the thing about Littlefingeras much as he might care for Sansa, he cares for nothing more than power. And now he sees an opportunity to gain more power for himself.

i believe these two girls are being written as a mirror of each other, not a contrast. everyone believes that arya, at some point, is going to use her training to go apeshit on the stark's enemies. i'm pretty sure sansa will do exactly the same, but in littlefinger's style rather than jaqen's.",28,8,False,self,,,,,

Narrator: Oberyn Martell (Pedro Pascal)

Title: Battle Above the God's Eye

Rhaenyra now mistrusted all the dragon seeds, including the girl who rode with her husband Daemon, hunting Aemond in the Riverlands. She ordered the girl's head be sent to her, but there was a ...complication. As well as her dragon, the girl had taken to riding Daemon. When Daemon received the queens order, he proclaimed it a queen's words and a whore's work. He sent the girl away at dawn, watching her and her dragon vanish into the morning mists. Then Daemon sent a challenge to his nephew, Aemond, and flew to Harrenhal alone... to wait.

14 days later, a shadow, blacker than any passing cloud, swept over Harrenhal. Vhagar had come at last and on her back rode one-eyed prince Aemond.

He mocked Daemon for facing him alone, ""You have lived too long uncle.""

And Daemon replied, ""On that much we agree""

Then, the old prince climbed stiffly onto the back of his dragon, Caraxes, but neglected to fasten the chains that secured rider to such. The sun was close to setting when, as one, the two dragons leapt into the sky. Daemon took Caraxes up swiftly until they disappeared into a bank of clouds. Vhagar older and slower, ascended more gradually. Up and up, Vhagar soared, searching for Caraxes. Sudden as a thunderbolt, a shrieking Caraxes dove upon Vaegar. Locked together, the dragons tumble towards the lake. Caraxes jaws closed upon Vhagar's neck but Vhagar ripped open Caraxes' belly, and her teeth ripped off a wing.

The lake rushed up with terrible speed. Then Daemon Targaryan, who had never fastened his riding chains, stood in his saddle. He leapt from his dragon to Aemonds and in his hand was Dark Sister, the Valyrian sword of Aegon's sister-queen Visenya. As Aemond one-eye looked up in terror, Daemon ripped off his nephew's helm and drove the sword down into his one remaining eye so hard the point came out the back of the young prince's throat.

Half a heartbeat later, the dragons struck the lake sending up a gout of water so high, that it was send to have been as tall as Harrenhal's great tower. The lake boiled with dragon blood, and then was still.

Daemon Targaryan was nine and forty at his death. Prince Aemond had only turned twenty. Vhagar, the greatest of the Targaryan dragons, had counted one hundred and eighty-one years. Thus passed the last living creature from the days of Aegon's Conquest.

He sees something in her and tries to teach her things so that she can become someone maybe... or no one.""

My intent is to spur discussion of how Arya's recruitment may or may not differ from the norm. If we take the actor's statements as true then there is a specific entity and/or long term goal behind her recruitment; again is this normal for FM and if not why would an exception be made for Arya? If there is an exception is it for Arya herself or for the ends to which she may be uniquely used? What would make Arya a unique or valuable assassin; is it her demeanor, because she's a Stark or just because she's a child? Can she do something like warging that would make her of special interest to the FM or is a homeless, violent youth just the ideal FM recruit?

So in the trailer the last line spoken, is Davos saying, ""I've never been much of a fighter, apologies for what you're about to see."" Then he pulls Longclaw out of its sheath, seemingly about to attack the Nights Watch. Watching the trailer about 5-6 times made me realize something, that might be what's going on in the scene. So the trailer sets up Davos, like he's about to attack the NW. I think it's safe to say the majority of fans agree that's what the scene is about. However after thinking a bit about it I figured... why would Davos attack 4-5 people in close quarters, with a longsword, while he's missing four fingers. We had ""bad poosey"" before so I guess bad writing can be the reason why Davos would think it's a wise idea to do that, only to then be killed. But as it's shown in the trailer he and Melisandre have been talking, in all likelihood about Jon too, and if he's coming back (more than likely of course) than they probably talked about bringing him back too. We saw Thoros revive Beric in the cave before when the Hound killed him. However he was very quick to help his friend. Jon will not have that luxury, as seen in the trailer, but they somehow have to bring him back. What if Davos and Mel plan to perhaps use Longclaw on Jon. Now bear with me. In the trailer Davos does say ""I've never been much of a fighter."" I believe however that he doesn't say that sentence in the that last scene. I believe it has been edited that way, so that we would assume he's about to attack those men, and not to use the sword on Jon. You can't see him say that line, like the one after, ""Apologies for what you're about to see"" I think that scene was just a red herring. Him and Mel would have a scene, where they somehow end up talking about Jon and how to bring him back. They'll end the scene on a cliffhanger not giving answers, then the next time we see Davos he's in the room, unsheating Longclaw with Mel in the room. Why do I think she's in the room with them? Because of these three pictures. 
https://i.imgur.com/3IjHPWX.jpg
https://i.imgur.com/u467e31.jpg
https://i.imgur.com/ePjLS9k.jpg
That to me seems like the exact same room. I'm not sure if it's been confirmed yet but it resembles the Lord Commanders quarters. Obviously that'd make sense since Jon was Lord commander, and he probably has been put there by men loyal to him out of respect, and I think those men are in there with him in that last scene, which is why I think Davos apologises to them. He's about to stab Jon, then Mel takes off her clothes and does Mel stuff. 

TL;DR: Editing focused your attention and thoughts away from Jon to Davos. ",4,0,False,self,,,,,

I've seen a lot of people point out how Sam's ""I've been worrying for Jon for years; he always comes back."" could be foreshadowing Jon's return in season 6, but while rewatching the episode I noticed the part before that. Sam says ""Sometimes, a man has to make hard choices. Choices that might look wrong to others, but you know are right in the long run.""

When The Hound died, I was bummed out because - duh - he's such an amazingly-entertaining character.  The thing is, though... he might not be dead.  I'm sure lots of people wonder that.  I've been rooting for him to re-appear ever since first seeing Arya walk away from him.  We think he's dead, but never saw it, and in fantasy-world-rules, that gives a fair chance that a miracle saved him.

&amp;nbsp;

So I thought it might be nice to make a list of off-camera deaths.  Sure, we never saw Ned Stark's head leave his body, but we saw plenty of evidence afterwards.  What about Stannis?  Brianne killed him off-camera and we never saw a corpse.  Maybe.... maybe she couldn't do the deed after all? (seems like a long-shot, but who knows?)

&amp;nbsp;


**Season 1:**

Syrio Forel

Benjen Stark *(Maybe? He's off-camera completely, with no real hints about being living or dead)*

**Season 1:**

Osha cut's Maester Llewyn's throat off-camera... but his survival seems pretty unlikely.  This may have been to actually give a dignified death to someone we love, as they did with Ned.

**Season 4:**

Sandor Clegane (The Hound)


**Season 5:**

Stannis Baratheon

Myrcella Lannister (dying, at the very least... maybe she'll pull through!)

Jon Snow (it's just a flesh wound!)

I'll gladly add to the list if people post more names :)",34,4,False,self,,,,,

Game of thrones (spoilers) theory on the last scene of season 5
u/Axeboogie1m
I'm new to reddit, having only browsed the sight until now. But I have had this idea concerning the significance of Jon Snow's death at the base of the wall, in the final moments of season 5.

I think that there is a distinct possibility that the magic sealing the wall is, like most of the genuine magic we've encountered to this point, blood magic. And I think that it was Stark blood that made the seal preventing the white walkers from further intrusion into the seven kingdoms. And now a Stark's lifeblood has been spent at the roots of the wall.

The part of me that loves the character of Jon Snow hopes that Melisandre will rush out and pray life back into him, allowing him to lead the last defense against winter. The part of me that knows George R.R. Martin tends to think that this is the end of Jon as we know him. He won't be the dutiful and pensive Jon Snow of Winterfell. He may be gone for good, or with Ghost, or even a White walker, but the odds are good he won't be back like we want him. This is the reason I love GOT, and the reason I hate it.

If this theory has already been put out there like nine times, my bad. I just haven't seen it yet, and it keeps on nagging at me.

We must assume that Lyanna gave birth to twins. We must assume that Ned took one and Howland the other (it makes sense to separate them to keep them both safe). How do you hide a secret? You bury it under another secret which people can find and stop looking, kind of how you keep a bit of cash in your wallet but keep your real stash down your pants. The evidence for R+L=J is there in the book. For M? Not so much. My belief that it is true comes from the simple fact that they cast her.

That means that he wasn't just protecting Jon when he killed her, he was avenging his father. Also, seeing the wildling tell him that he was going to eat his parents made me understand his anger at Jon in the end.

Don't get me wrong. Olly still totally sucks. But I understand his motivations now better than I did when I viewed it live. You guys are probably more observant than me but maybe there's someone else out there who failed to make that connection as well.

In this video, the guy says JS will be lit on fire at his funeral but later on someone will find his body unharmed.

Many argue this cannot be bc JS burned his hand in [season 1] from the lantern. However, Dany is full blooded Targ, therefore she cannot be harmed nor destroyed by fire. JS is half Targ so maybe he can be harmed but not destroyed by fire. What do you think?",8,0,False,self,,,,,

But I've had people say that the actresses who play the S.S are bad and they suck at acting and all this other stuff. 

Is it really fair to blame Rosabelle Sellers(Tyene Sand) for the ""bad pussy"" line? Not like she wrote it. Same with Obara's actress who's name I can't remember - she's an Emmy nominated actress for her work in other movies - it's not like she wrote the stupid monologue she had to act out either. 

I just think that badmouthing the actresses for the mistakes of the writers is a mistake. Anyway that's me, downvote away

Translation one main guy and two sidekicks. This is just a theory so don't get your panties in a twist if you are rooting for someone else.

Bran representing ice. Keep in mind Martin has stated that the three heads do not need to be Targaryens. On the issue of how he gets the dragon considering he is in a cave north of the wall. He will warg into one, natural preogression of his storyline, from beast to man to dragon. Maybe the previous rider dies, or the dragon just wasn't tamed yet. Or the Ironborn manage to steal one with the horn and he sets him free.

Dany representing fire. This is pretty straight forward.

Jon representing ice and fire combined. Azor ahai come again, the prince that was promised, Hyrkoon the Hero, Yin Tar, Neferion, Eldric Shadowchaser whatever you wanna call him. This one is pretty clear cut also. Cmon guys Jon is getting a dragon. Right? Right guys?

Now hear me out why I think this is true. Obviously we have the whole ice and fire thing theme going on, which is obviously the title of the books. But this is not in any way a superficial theory. I think we can all agree that Aegon (Rhaegar's son) is dead. I mean please you don't introduce a main character 6000 pages in. I refuse to believe it. We can all agree he is just a red herring, BUT in more ways than one. Lets take a look at this interesting paragraph from Dany's vision in the house of the undying.

The fifth room, finally, shows a man very much alike her brother Viserys, except that he is taller and has eyes of dark indigo rather than lilac. He is speaking to a woman who is nursing a newborn babe, telling her that the child's name should be Aegon and saying that ""What better name for a king?"". The woman asks him if he will make a song for the child, and he replies that he has a song and that ""He is the prince that was promised, and his is the song of ice and fire."". He appears to look at Dany then, as if seeing her, and then he adds that ""There must be one more,"" and ""The dragon has three heads."".

Now what if what is described isn't the past and what happened, but the future and what could have happened. As Dany goes through the rooms it goes from future to past. Red wedding---&gt;Aerys---&gt;Her childhood---&gt;Rhaegar. But before that we get a bunch of visions in no chronological order of future present and past, that noone can make sense of. So what is the point of thoose if not purely to show that there is no chronological order and the others are just placed in a way to confuse us into thinking EXACTLY what George wants us to think. And that is that the woman is Elia, and the child is Aegon, but here it gets interesting. 

First my overall reasoning for what comes next. Rhaegar knew more about the prophecy than anyone else. Rhaegar had two children plus Dany and Viserys, YET he still made a child with Lyanna. Why? Why did he do it? Did he fall in love? How do you just fall in love in someone who is one the other side of the continent. Or did he know more about the song of ice and fire than we currently know. And acted on it.  And another thing. Why wasn't this scene shown in the show? Il tell you why.

Its not the past. Its not Elia. Its not Aegon. Its the future that could have been. Its Lyanna. And its Jon.

Notice the woman is not described, the child is not described. He says the child SHOULD be called aegon. Why should? Because wolf blood Lyanna wouldn't let him? Because there is already an Aegon? Because he was wrong, he was so wrong, that in order to fix it he had to risk civil war (he wasn't stupid he knew what would happen). Civil war that resulted in his death the death of his children, his wives* and his father. Leaving his house in ruins. But also resulting in the true prince that was promised. Saviour of the realm. I'd take that risk. Because unlike everybody else Rhaegar had to have known what was at risk to do the things he did.

And then he says that his is the song of ice and fire. Now let's assume that this is Aegon for a minute and not Jon, what the fuck does ice have to do with Aegon, he could not be further from fucking ice then he is, there is nothing about him that is even close to being ice related. Jon on the other hand has everything to do with ice and fire. Being of stark blood (the blood of the first men) and Targeryan blood (blood of old valyria), Il get into this later. First lets finish the last lines.

He looks at Dany and says there must be one more. I mean there is something going on with his guy, he knows some weird shit, this is fucking Bran and Night's king from the trailer shit right here. What if he wasn't talking about Dany but to Dany, if he is talking to Dany then it makes sense. Because if he is not talking to Dany it doesnt make sense. If he is talking about Dany we have Jon plus one more, one more being Dany. Thats two so it makes no sense. And if you are thinking that he could be talking about Dany and that he is holding Aegon plus counting his other kid, that makes three. What about Viserys? Nope doesn't make sense. The only way it makes sense is he is talking to Dany holding Jon telling her there is one more. Jon+ Dany + One more. There must be one more. The dragon has three heads. Now who is it? He doesn't fucking know. It's as simple as that. Its as if he is telling her you gotta find the last one girl. I ain't there anymore. There is some supernatural shit going on there. But yes this is very tinfoil im aware of that. But there is something he knows that is leading him to these conclusions. Something about blood.

What is the most powerful type of magic in Dragon ag... I mean ASOIAF, it's blood magic. And no one can deny it is real and it is connected to the red god, just look at Mellisandre. Let's see here, we have two real gods here. The Great Other and the Lord of Light, if you are arguing that there are more gods than that. I find it too convinient, that the many faced God just happens to fit all of the southern gods, from the Old gods to the stranger to Rhllor. And we know Rhaegar knows about the prophecy, more so than anyone else. How does he know? Obviously the only way he could have known is by the only divine influence there is south of the wall and that is Rhllor. He found out something. Maybe even his father found out something that drove him mad, as we know he was a normal guy when he was young he wasn't like Joffrey crazy from the get go (sry idk how it's spelled). So whats the difference between a wight and a living thing? It's blood. And Rholl's magic is all about blood. So blood is very important for Rhllor. In the Prophecy we even find out that the prince will come from Aerys's BLOODline, so blood is very important, but what if it's Rhaegar who figured out the other side of the coin. The other secret ingridient to the prince that was promised. I mean otherwise we have like 10 princes. And that ingridient would be the blood of the first men, and the blood of the first men runs strongest in Starks. So we have Jon representing both sides of the gene pool, then Dany on one side, which he can't know about but sees in the vision, as if through flames, and Bran that no one yet knows about on the other side. Bran's role could just as easily be taken by Arya.

Well il be the first to say this is streched to say the least. But it's something to laugh at until we get the next season and books so we have more to go on. Feel free to point out my mistakes in the comments. I hope at least one person enjoys this fruit of my fruitless evening. Sorry for my bad english and grammar.

think about this theory. (I've come up with some of it on my own, but it's mostly based off other 

theories and information from the book and other sources). 



Alt Shift X has a lot of videos on game of thrones or ASOIAF, the first one I'd like to mention is 

the one about Arya's ending. Basically he predicts that Arya's will die in her human body but most 

likely live the rest of her days through Nymeria (book readers know she has wolf dreams and it's 

strongly implied that she's a warg so there is evidence to that prediction (plus George R.R. 

Martain had to promise to his wife that Arya would make it to the end of the series, this ending 

would still be keeping that promise)). 

I think this is what's going to happen but in a slightly different way. 

Assuming Jon Snow is in fact Azor Ahai (which he still may not be we don't know for sure yet) I 

think the only person who could possibly be his Nissa Nissa is Arya. Now before I get bombarded 

with the whole 'ew incest' thing I'm going to clarify this. I DON'T MEAN A IN A 

SEXUAL/ROMANTIC WAY.  


Book readers will know that Jon and Arya consistently think of each other through out the series 

(and yes there is one weird part where Jon compares Ygritte's body to Arya's, but I think that's 

just a little element that was left over from GRRM's original draft of the book (he originally had a 

love triangle going on between Jon, Arya, and Tyrion)). 

There are so many examples that prove just how important they are to each other. Jon may have 

broke one of his vows for Ygritte however this vow has been broken by MANY men of the night's 

watch (it's mentioned that men sneak off to brothels when they aren't on duty), and in the end; 

Ygritte was not enough for Jon to abandon the nights watch. When he hears about the possibility 

of Arya being in trouble, he doesn't think twice.


There is a way to be fully in love with a person without the sexual element being involved, that's 

what Jon and Arya have. Now here's my theory..... When the time come's people will begin to rally 

behind Jon and people will become more and more convinced that Jon is Azor Ahai. When Jon is 

convinced that he's the one to save everyone from the long night, either a prophet, priest, 

priestess or whatever will remind him of Azor Ahai's sacrifice that made lightbringer... Jon will 

refuse but eventually come around. 

Arya would have to be willing, otherwise Jon (I don't think) would ever be able to do it... or maybe 

he would since being brought back from the dead does change a person (we are told). When 

Arya's 'dead' and the sword is supposed to end the long night..... DOESN'T WORK. They maybe 

lose or retreat from a big battle (that maybe would involves Nymeria's wolf pack) but they realize 

either something went wrong with what they did to create lightbringer, or.... the legend is just 

that... a legend. We are told over and over again that we shouldn't trust old stories or myths. With 

the Azor Ahai story, it's been told so many times and it was supposed to have happened however 

long ago, so who's to say that it wasn't lost in translation? It most likely was.



Alt Shift X also has another video mostly about the Other's or the white walkers, but in the end he 

also goes on about how the series ending really shouldn't be about war. GRRM isn't actually the 

biggest fan of war (Who is?), and he's said before that he didn't just want to write about all of the 

good characters coming together to beat the bad guys, and we've seen both in the show and in 

the books what the costs and repercussions of war are, so war isn't what Thrones is about.


I've been using Alt Shift X for most of my research but I'm slowly making my way through the 

books myself and I've read and watched other sources like Emergency Awesome, Because Geek, 

ASOIAF wiki page, Reddit blah blah blah. (For what I'm about to say next, you could probably just 

watch Alt Shift X video about white walkers, he goes into much more detail on what I'm 

explaining). 


What if Azor Ahai never defeated the white walkers and instead made some sort of compromise? 

(In the video (and if you read the books)) We know about the secret passage way underneath the 

Nightfort (one of the abandoned castles along the wall), and we have also seen an Other turning a 

baby (assumed to be Craster's) into an Other. This could possibly be a way of reproducing for 

them so if we use common sense they won't be wanting to wipe out the human race. Maybe Azor 

Ahai was able to make a compromise with them which was what made peace. Maybe that's what 

Jon will have to do since Lightbringer wouldn't work.


You don't have to agree with this theory, but I personally think this is how it will end.",20,1,False,self,,,,,

Tom Wlaschiha (Jaqen): And talk like Jesus sometimes! The only thing I haven't done is walk on water, but who knows?

____________

Philippians 2:6-9
6 Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God 
something to be used to his own advantage;
7 rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very form of a servant,
being made in human likeness.
8 And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself
by becoming **obedient to death**...
9 Therefore God exalted him to the highest place
and gave him the name that is above every name 
10 that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow,
in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
11 and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord,
to the glory of God the Father.

____________

The words ""form"" and ""nature"" are used interchangeably, coming from the original Greek ""morphe,"" meaning form, shape or outer appearance. 

Against Celsus (Greek  , Kata Kelsou; Latin Contra Celsum), is the title of a major work by the Church Father Origen of Alexandria, countering the writings of Celsus. It was written in 248 AD. Here's a quote about Jesus: ""Although Jesus was one, he had several aspects; and to those who saw him he did not appear alike to all... Moreover, that his appearance was not just the same to those who saw him, but varied according to their individual capacity, will be clear to people who carefully consider why...""

Just makes me wonder what other parallels we'll see as we learn more about the FM in Season 6.

Each character was given a choice. They could follow their orders, or disobey.

Cersie? She obeyed the demand to confess. It was both horrific for her, and good she got out.

John Snow? He disobeyed the wants of his men and followers to save the Wildlings. He got his shit fucked up for it.

Stannis? He disobeyed his god's demand, and then later chose to obey it. He got aaaalll his shit fucked up.

Daenerys? She obeyed the want of her people, to return the gladiator type games. She was attacked and lead far away.

Tyrion? He obeyed the demands of his Queen and rules over the city in her absence. He's got it either really god, or really bad.

Arya? She disobeyed the many-faces God and killed someone she shouldn't have. She lost her eyesight like the man she killed got blinded before death.

Sansa? She disobeyed the demands of her husband, Bolten. She escaped(as far as we know) from her abuser.

Theon? He disobeyed the demands of his captor. He also escaped from his abuser.

Brienne? She disobeyed her vow to the Starks to kill Stannis. How will she pay? We'll find out.

There are others, but not nearly as important as the main characters. All their actions carried themes of obeying or disobeying, and how they changed their lives. This doesn't prove anything, but it's neat to think about.

It is my first post in reddit and I am so excited about the Trailer of S6 that I want to share you the openions and ideas :)
This Idea was in my mind before and after the Trailer of season 6 it becomes more stronger...
Actually I want to ask if somebody already concidered that the White Walkers are on the side of ""Starks"" (Winter)?
The Scene between Night King and Bran could be the introduction that the night King and White Walkers want to fight for starks. This is also the reason why Night king has interest on Jon, as Jon does not know that for now.
And I think we might see in season 6 Jon and Wildling with some troubles in the battle of Winterfell (remember the face of Tormond from Trailer...) and then White Walkers will come and Support Sansa, Jon with Support of Bran to win the battle of Winterfell and take back the home. 
So that would mean that the ICE side of the song of ice and fire becoming face.. :) on the other Hand Dany with her Dragons will built the fire side for sure and will be a big clash between them at the end...
I dont think everybody (starks + Tagar + all other houses ) will only fight the White Walkers, this is not style of GRRM... Everything will become more shoking as White Walkers will be the Army of winter and starks :)
And somehow I have a Feeling somewhere at the end Arya would use needle against Jon...(Dramatically as it is his own gift to her)",10,1,False,self,,,,,

So the popular theory regarding Jon's parentage is R + L = J, meaning Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark are Jon's parents. While I do see the strength in this theory, there's one essential flaw I've yet to see discussed; his appearance.

While yes Jon is described as looking very Stark-esque, his appearance doesn't really share any common ground with the Targs. No violet eyes, no pale hair, and he ain't fire proof as he burned his hand.

So what are we to think? Genetics are a very potent power in this universe (Griff has to dye his hair often, Gendry has the same hair and build as his father, and let's not forget all the Lannister kids). So why then, if Jon was half Targ and half Stark, would he really only share his mother's traits? And (to my knowledge mind you) it seems gender has a strong hand in this too. The girls look like their mothers and sons like their fathers. I'm sure there's some middle ground, but still the Targ dynasty was built in these hyper-potent genetics.

Now this is my explanation; R + L does NOT equal J, or rather not THAT R.

I think Jon' mother is Lyanna. Ned's chapters in GoT slap you upside the head with symbolism to make that point (often thinks of Lyanna and Jon in succession, the baby blue colors, etc.). 

But I think his FATHER is Robert Baratheon.

He looks JUST LIKE the Baratheons. Dark hair, strong jaw, and he has an aptitude for battle. Plus episode 9 of season 4 Sam asks Jon to describe being with Ygritte and he can't because 'he's not a bleeding poet'. Rhaegar was famously literate and musical. Now granted that last point is a bit weak, but when combined with the genetics it forms a better picture.

Plus this could explain why Rhaegar left Lyanna at ToJ and rode off to fight. He may have even beat her out of rage when he told him that she'd been with Robert.

And it would still give Ned reason to protect him from Robert. Maybe he doesn't want any of his family involved in the politics of the Seven Kingdoms, and knew that if Robert learned of his son by Lyanna he would demand to have control over the boy's life. So off to the Wall where your lineage means nothing to anybody, and thus never investigated.

I'm sure there's some evidence that refutes a lot of this, but I haven't found it yet. I just find it interesting that most people except Rhaegar as Jon's father almost immediately without thinking about his appearance.

I mean at first it seems obvious, of course she will, she's in charge and Martell killed her daughter. But if you think about it, it's actually quite an interesting dilemma, the real power rests with Tommen, and Cersei certainly has a lot of ""soft power"" over him but she's losing her grip to Margery and the Tyrells, who will probably want to avoid war because they stand to lose the most and have no personal honor tied up in the issue and a further weakened House Lannister isn't necessarily a bad thing for their Iron Throne goals. I think war with Dorne would be cool af but I think it isn't going to happen.

What if The Last Hero who drove The Others back into the LOAW is actually the Night's King.It's been forgotten how The Others were defeated thousands of years beforehand and one of the biggest White Walker theories is that  a treaty or agreement was made between the Humans and Others and was sealed with a marriage. My theory is that Last Hero was the Human who was wedded to an Other and was turned into a White Walker(if they can turn a baby why not an adult?) and is now the Night's King.We don't know how long an Other can live,since they're magical beings they could live forever if not harmed.

If Azor Ahai from the Lord of Light religion and The Last Hero are the same person then this helps solidify my theory as from ACOK one of Dany's visions in the House of the undying was of a blue eyed king wielding a red sword,The Night King's AKA The Last Hero,Azor Ahai, wielding the original Lightbringer. Which brings me to my next point.In the season 6 trailer we see The Night's King with a sword on his back,I'm willing bet that it is Lightbringer, judging from it's non icy appearance unlike other White Walker weapons we have seen so far.
Because Azor Ahai/Last Hero/Night's King is returning it fulfills Melisandres prophecy of the Lord's Chosen returning wielding Lightbringer, just not in the way we imagined.

So that's why I believe The Last Hero is the Night's King,why he's leading The Others I wouldn't know,this is the first theory I posted,what do you guys think?",8,2,False,self,,,,,

1.  What exactly has he done to earn his reputation as a great swordsman?

2.  Does anyone every notice or comment about the valyrian steel sword he was given but never seems to have with him?

From the beginning of the story we are constantly told about how great a swordsman Jaime is but we don't really ever see it and nobody every really brings up an specific examples of his exemplary swordsmanship.  In the show (I haven't read the books) we only see him actually fight against a couple people.  He kills Jory quickly and fights Ned but doesn't get to finish(and in the show it appears Ned was a decent match for him).  He is said to have killed 10 men before being captured by Robb Stark and his men.  Then after he and Brienne are going to Kings landing we see them fight but he effectively loses.  Locke then takes his hand and the next time we see him fight someone it is in Dorne and he wins barely against a random guard(by luck) and is fought to a stand still by Obara Sand, daughter of Oberyn Martell, she fights for Dorne.  So what exactly has he done to earn this huge rep as a super awesome swordsman?  Is it like Brienne says and that people have been exaggerating his skills because of his name and that he killed the mad king?  Are there things mentioned in the books that actually give some proof to his skill or was he actually just overconfident and cocky about his skills and when put to the test he turned out to be pretty good but not legendary?

And for 2, it would seem that given how rare and valuable valyrian steel is that when he is given a new valyrian steel sword that it would be a pretty noticeable when he doesn't have it with him.  I don't recall anyone in the show noticing that he doesn't have it, does it ever come up in the books?  Did anyone other than him and Tywin know about it?  I have to assume so.

Over the last few years Ive been known as the GOT guy at the office.  Ive read all of the books and have become a resource in the office for show watchers for any questions they may have had about the shows characters, storylines, etc.  This started as one or two people, but over the years word has spread and people want a full on meeting to discuss each weeks episode first thing on Monday morning.

I plan on having a pre-premiere meeting before the season starts, followed by weekly meetings thereafter.  

My question is, has anyone here done anything like this at their place of work?  I plan on setting rules and mocking up agendas as well, as I know many show watchers like to go read about book theories, and that could come off as spoilery to show-only watchers. Any tips or tricks would be appreciated, as Im most concerned about having a clear direction and flow to the meeting on a week to week basis.

It looks like it will be a meeting of around 10-15 people, with only 1 other book reader.

Any thoughts or comments would be appreciated.",1,6,False,self,,,,,

This is only our second pass through (I'm sure many here have done more), so besides sating our hunger for more Westeros, we also wanted to look for all the things we missed the first time around.  *(for example, not having read the books first, The Hound was almost a non-entity for me throughout Season 1, and now I'm eager to notice his every move)*

Once we started the re-watch, I got a crazy idea in my head to take notes and then turn our binge into a podcast.  I figure there's probably a lot of people out there who - like us - also don't remember a lot from the earlier seasons, and may not have time or access to refresh their brains.

GOALS:

- Reducing 50 hours of TV to something much more manageable
- Break seasons into commute-sized, digestable chunks
- Look for subtle things we missed the first time around
- Daily (or darn close to it) episodes completing just as Season 6 begins
- Psych up even more for Season 6!  (we'll do post-airing podcasts for new episodes)

While we know the end game villains are the White Walkers, they do not really bring a psychological threat to the protagonists. On the other hand we have the mind game villains like Littlefinger, Cersi, Jeoffory and the Boltons. I personally think the Boltons leaves me the most anxious when watching the series, because they are very cunning as well as ruthless in their approach. While i think Littlefinger is the most cunning one in the series, he lacks the sense of danger and life threatening feeling which the Boltons have. I think GRRM would do great if he keeps them as a threat and not kill them off too suddenly. The Boltons, especially Ramsay, are the best villains in the series IMO.

While I like the color scheme and fonts, it's not easy to navigate. There's no ""shows you watch"" row, and the latest episodes of the shows I watch rarely appear on the first row.

I have to scroll down 4 rows (past ""movies"" ""kids"" and ""featured movies"") to ""Series"" and then scroll horizontally all the way to the show that I want (of their 50+ shows), then once you get to the shows, the seasons are arranged in chronological order, but the episodes are arranged in REVERSE chronological order. Just crazy. And the thumbnail images for Thrones often have spoilers, which would be shitty for those watching Thrones for the first time.

Also, when I first play an episode, it loads for 15 seconds, then the logo and rating comes up, then it loads again for another 10 seconds. 

And when an episode first airs, there's no way to turn off the ""recap,"" but it can be fast forwarded through. And during busy times on Sunday nights, I've experienced serious and distracting frame rate drops that are only happening on HBO GO and not my other apps.

The layout on the browser version is excellent, but the Roku one is abysmal. I know it sounds kind of first world problem whiny, but it shouldn't be that difficult to fix.
