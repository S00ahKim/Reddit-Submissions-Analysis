It is the figure heads and the source of currency of the land.  How is it that the Iron Bank actually has more power than the Government of Westeros?   The coin of the realm is dictated by the government.  In the case of Game of Thrones that would be the Lannisters and the Tyrell's.  With the ruling power having the capability of deflating or inflating the value of the government currency.  

Why is it that fiction gets this wrong and then incorrectly has the ability to create stupid politicians in real life that don't realize that currency is a prime reason a government exists.  Banks are the middle managers of the governments financial system.",43,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

A quick foray into the youtube comment section showed that it actually never played on the show, yet for some odd reason still appeared on the OST. This got me thinking. 

The song in question was [Stay a Thousand Years](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=K318JWc85Dk) - a choral rendition of the [Truth](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4_Psg5mV4c) (Jon/Dany) theme sung with the lyrics of [Mhysa](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=OG55MPQjhwo). A little more digging led to finding [Not Today](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgxMjiXAZ0o), a haunting choral take on [The Night King](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=k1frgt0D_f4) with lyrics in a previously-unspoken language thats neither High Valyrian nor Dothraki. 

Now, there have been bonus tracks on previous seasons OSTs, but these ones stand out. The use of incredibly recognizable themes isnt normal, not to mention the inclusion of an ***entirely new language***. Its far too much work to simply be Djawadi giving listeners one last goodbye. 

Then I remembered something interesting. Remember the news about the alternate endings being filmed in an attempt to stop leaks? Well, I doubt theyd be so careless to just hand the complete plot to an entire music/sound team/orchestra. 

**These two songs are windows into the alternate endings Game of Thrones had filmed.** 

Stay a Thousand Years is the happy ending Jon and Dany could have had - if I had to guess, composed for a never-written wedding scene. Through the use of Mhysas lyrics singing of freedom, we could assume Dany never lost it and *truly* liberated the people of Westeros. This song is the fairytale ending. 

On the opposite end, its easy to picture Not Today as the end of all things, the Night King triumphant. I believe that the language spoken is that of the Children of the Forest, and that this song accompanied a scene of the Night King in the throne room; an end to humanity and a return to the magic of Old Nans tales.

Apologies if this is old news. This was just too intriguing not to share, and Ill admit - even as someone who enjoyed Season 8, I shiver imagining the Night King standing in the snowy halls of the Red Keep as children chant, and I tear up a bit imagining Jon finally achieving a happy ending. 

TL;DR: [This song](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=K318JWc85Dk) is written for an alternate ending where Jon and Dany lived happily ever after; [this one](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgxMjiXAZ0o) is the Night King triumphant.",6,9,False,spoiler,,,,,

How did Brandon get ""marked"" by the Night King? In the previous vision with Ned Stark he was invisible to everyone, only when he yelled his father felt like he heard something. How did the White Walkers see him, and how does the whole marking by the NK thing allow them to walk in the cave him, that old guy in the bush, Meera, Hodor and the children were in?   
     
II. Why was Hodor scared when the siege was starting to happen? I understood his involvement and the hold the door thing, but this is a bit of a mindfuck. I know that if he weren't scared the future and past would've been different, but *why* was he scared? It doesn't seem very much like him, although he was... Hodor, he never really seemed like he didn't understand things, although he was only able to repeat his own name. I expected him to try to save Bran from the Walkers without Bran getting into him. I'm sorry if this makes no sense, I just don't get it.  
  
III. What was the thing the Child of the Forest was holding at the end of the episode, when she sacrificed herself for the others and killed some wights? It's like a weird colour-changing ball that lights up. Is it of any relevance, did I miss something?   
   
IV. How did young Hodor get affected by Bran getting into old Hodor? How did the events before his death make a completely different version of Hodor, Wylis, become traumatised? Shouldn't *old* Hodor be the one who gets that trauma? How is young Hodor related? If I'm right, then Hodor wouldn't be Hodor. Then we wouldn't be here. ",3,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

I hate myself for saying this, but I wouldn't even recommend GoT as a good show. The last three (or four) seasons have been a complete disaster (source material run out) and that sealed it's fate and demolished everything the first ones had built. You can't split it, they are two parts of a whole. As the series went on I didn't actually see it, as I was so eager to finally find out what happens to everyone, but looking back now it wasn't just the pace, the plot and the dialogues that sucked - it was acting also.

The GOT wiki says that daenerys buys 8,000 unsullied. (+ \~5,000 untrained) but based on shots from the series we know there are more.

look:

[here we have four sections of 5\*8 unsullied](https://i.redd.it/tdcy6m1r93e31.png)

[here we have 15 \(3\*5\) sections of four unsullied units](https://i.redd.it/7ikb620u93e31.png)

[and here we can barely see four divisions](https://i.redd.it/g4pm0dpw93e31.png)

so we get 40 (8\*5) unsullied per unit, 4 units per section, 15 (3\*5) sections per division and we have 4 divisions.

thats 40\*4\*15\*4=9600 unsullied. 1000 more then described",7,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

I know its been said so many times already but every season in my opinion was fantastic until season 8 where I personally enjoyed episodes 1-3 but 4-6 were absolute garbage where not a single decision made sense. I also feel as if the directors completely disregarded any and all characteristics of some characters like dany and Jon snow. From the beginning dany has been the breaker of chains the liberator of slaves but in kings lanfing although she said she saved everybody from a tyrant, she had murdered hundreds of innocents from man, women, child, and even surrendered soldiers. Jon didnt fall far off because he has always done what he thought would be better for everyone even when he bent the knee to dany so she would fight with them, but during the battle of kings landing he didnt have to send his men and although it wouldve been treason he was the true heir to the thrones even if he didnt want it. Dany has become very selfish and had developed a massive ego because she began manipulating people to become loyal to her and when Jon had said his real name and even said he didnt want the throne she still tried to make sure that he didnt say anything to anybody not even his family. 

Anyways I felt as though that season was wasted almost entirely but I did also enjoy the final ending where its shows Sansa as queen in the north, Arya sailing away, and Jon finally becoming a wildling.",53,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

Assuming she doesn't have children to take the throne.  The throne would most likely go to Arya next but since there is no way to find her she can't be crowned queen, so it would end up going to Bran and he would rule the 7 kingdoms and part of me believes that he knows it will happen like this since he can see the future which is why he allowed the north to break away at least for a little while and given that apparently the last three-eyed raven lived like 1000 years he got plenty of time",7,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Also how does he know where they are? Well enough to ambush them but Dany doesnt seem him while she sits on a dragon in the sky. 

Ghost is supposed to have a deep psychological link with Jon and Jon just lets him go that easily. If you were going to do that, then at least have him die in battle. (If you did it to represent Jon letting go of his Stark side, thats middle school symbolism over the logic of your own story)

Jamie and Brienne had such a great relationship of respect and mutual understanding and you have to ruin even that. 

Why do you have to make Jon so stupid? Wu did he tell Sansa? Even if it is his honor its not even a particularly dishonorable thing to hide. In fact it would have been more honorable to keep that to himself. 

That Bronn storyline was entirely pointless. It had no tension. Neither Jaime nor Tyrion were going to die like that. You made it clear last episode that main characters are safe. 

Events that should have taken place over the course of multiple episodes happened in one.

I have been wondering if the whole Army of the Dead and the White Walkers consist of one collective mind or something of the sort. It is my understanding that the Night King knows everything a White Walker hears and sees etc., and since we never observe the White Walkers communicate with each other in any recognizable way, how does he give them orders?

I had the idea about making teams out of the Game of Thrones houses, but I thought it wouldn't really be fun without someone like Danaerys. So I looked at the create a player mode, and low-and-behold, you could create female characters. And they could play alongside their male counterparts. So at this point, I'm like, the game wants me to do this. So here we go, GoT the Hockey Edition.

12 teams total and roughly \~250 created players make up this league. There are 21 players per team. 2 goalies per team, plus 19 skaters. 20 are allowed on a game day roster,  More on the teams later. The idea is to play them in a season mode and see who comes out with the Stanley Cup. Except they aren't actually in the NHL because then I would need 31 teams. So they're in another league, one with 12 teams. But same thing, really. So let's run through teams.

Here are the teams, rosters, uniforms, and other info. (Posted on Imgur because there's no way it would all fit in one post.) Also note, I tried to include at least one historical family member per team, though I usually didn't make that very good. And I tried to keep stats to how I think they'd be, but some major characters may be buffed a bit more, because, I mean, who wants to play as Team Targaryen without Danaerys being any good?

One other thing to note, the game doesn't let you choose a home city and you need to choose a play-by-play name for the announcers. So there's some creativeness/lolz there.

[Team Essosi, 76 Overall](https://imgur.com/a/4pyG5Ze)

[Team Targaryen, 81 Overall](https://imgur.com/a/c9kd3wW)

[Team Arryn, 78 Overall](https://imgur.com/a/RIccjc3)

[Team Tyrell, 82 Overall](https://imgur.com/a/5im8rqA)

[Team Night's Watch, 79 Overall](https://imgur.com/a/oAxWD37)

[Team Baratheon, 81 Overall](https://imgur.com/a/6X6thmf)

[Team Lannister, 80 Overall](https://imgur.com/a/A9qypPf)

[Team Greyjoy, 78 Overall](https://imgur.com/a/uJ1jpfZ)

[Team Wildling, 78 Overall](https://imgur.com/a/uSjCY9k)

[Team Tully, 77 Overall](https://imgur.com/a/8DAA2H2)

[Team Martell, 78 Overall](https://imgur.com/a/Yn28oL4)

[Team Stark, 82 Overall](https://imgur.com/a/88IcRip)

So now how'd the teams do? Here were the end of the regular season standings:

Team, Pts, W-L-Overtime Win-Overtime Loss

1. Stark, 97, 29-8-3-4
2. Baratheons, 78, 21-12-4-7
3. Targaryens,77,21-13-4-6
4. Wildlings, 71, 16-14-9-5
5. Martells,69,16-16-9-3
6. Greyjoys, 63, 16-19-6-3
7. Tyrells, 62, 14-17-7-6
8. Night's Watch, 60,17-22-4-1
9. Arryns, 58, 15-19-3-7
10. Lannisters, 56,15-20-2-7
11. Tullys, 51, 14-25-4-1
12. Essosi, 50, 13-22-2-7 

Wildlings made a better push then I thought they would.

Also I just wanna add, I watched the first Lannister game, and it played out in true Lannister fashion. 10 seconds in, Cersei took a shot, then Jaime knocked the rebound in for a goal. 10 seconds after than, Tyrion somehow scored an own goal. Lol.

The league I used had some Intermediate period to determine the last two playoff teams (8 make it). Let's ignore that.

Here's the playoff results:

**QUARTER FINALS**

Targaryen 4 -3 Martell

Greyjoy 3-4  Tyrell

Stark 4-1 Wildling

Baratheon 4-3 Arryn 

**SEMI FINALS**

Stark 4-0 Targaryen

Baratheon 4-0 Tyrell 

 **FINALS**

Stark 3-4 Baratheon

And the Baratheons take home the Stanley Cup! And as a side note, the Starks blew a 3-1 lead in the finals and lost in overtime. See, they'd fit in real well in real life.

And finally, let's give out some awards for the season.

**AWARDS**

Stanley Cup: Team Baratheon (Winner of the finals)

President's Trophy: Team Stark (Best regular season record)

Conn Smythe Trophy: Cortnay Penrose (Playoffs MVP)

Hart Memorial Trophy: Robb Stark (MVP)

Calder Memorial Trophy: Robb Stark (Best rookie, but they're all rookies...)

Vezina Trophy: Bran Stark (Best goalie)

James Norris Memorial Trophy: Tyrion Lannister (Best Defenseman)

Art Ross Trophy: Night's Watch Jon Snow (Most offensive points)

Frank J Selke Trophy: Stark Jon Snow (Best defensive forward)

Lady Byng Memorial Trophy: Stark Jon Snow (High standing play and best sportsmanship and conduct)

Jack Adams Trophy: Wildlings coach (Best coach)

Maurice Richard Trophy: Night's Watch Jon Snow (Top goal scorer)

King Clancy Trophy: Sam Tarly (Leadership on and off the ice, plus humanitarian contributions. Saving Jorah, informing Jon, new Grand Maester. That's some service)

Ted Lindsay Award: Stark Jon Snow (Most outstanding player)

William M Jennings Trophy: Cortnay Penrose (Fewest goals scored against, minimum 25 games)

Mark Messier Trophy: Stark Jon Snow (Exemplifies leadership on and off the ice)

GM of the Year: Wildlings GM (So me, I guess. I humbly accept.)

Bill Masterson Memorial Trophy: Stark Jon Snow (Best example of perseverance, sportsmanship, and dedication) 

NHL Foundation Award: Daenarys Targaryen (Applies the values of perseverance, commitment, and team work to enrich the lives of the community. I mean, the slaves lives got a lot better.)

So there you go, in a hockey challenge, the Baratheons should turn out on top. Maybe this will be one of the spin off series.",3,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

So I made up my own ending in my head and constantly pretend that's how it went down. Here's how it went,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/cmc7ng/you_know_everyone_well_mostly_everyone_is_upset/,jeremy1051,1565017997,"     Now I don't include season 7 or 8 in my ending because season 7 may have not been as bad as 8 it just didn't make sense. Night King wouldn't have a stash of huge ass metal chains and the undead certainly couldn't travel in the water to put it on the dead dragon I mean wtf were they thinking? Couldn't they just make the Night King get close to the edge of the water, raise both his hands, and all the sudden the ground shakes and the ice where he's standing breaks and the undead dragon appears as the night king immediately is on it's back as it flies out of the water and shoots blue fire into the sky. Anyway without going into too much detail as I don't want to waste too much of your time if anyone even reads this I came up with my version. Jon Snow of course tries his best to tell everyone including his enemies about the undead and how winter is coming. They of course don't listen and instead plot and contrive against him for power. 
     So we have Cersei drinking her wine one day thinking of plans to march towards Winterfell and wipe out Jon Snow for their treachery against her. When she comes up with the masterful plan as the Cersei's ways she decides to march towards Winterfell with her army and allies (she doesn't get there immediately of course idk how in the beginning of the show it took a literal season for our characters to get to Winterfell from King's Landing or vise versa then season 7 / 8 theyre immediately there within 30 minutes of an episode). But I'm not gonna go into details about her travels maybe she meets some new characters including a new witch or a man with no name. Eventually she arrives at the gates of Winterfell, her army so great that Jon and everyone could never overcome. Meanwhile while she travels we see our Dragon Queen fly to Winterfell after being told of possible allies in the north by Tyrion because I liked him finding her and by Dany's side. So now Jon has the unsullied, her dragons, etc. Maybe they have a small chance...Now back to Cersei at the gates ready to burn it all to the ground with wildfire and a Witch on her side. She gets there and is mortified with what she sees...Winterfell is in crumbles. Her enemies are nowhere to be seen she hates this for she's the one who had the right to destroy Winterfell. 
     Then on the final episode we have see Winterfell right before it fell apart. Jon's telling Dany about the threat of winter and Cersei who Tyrion knows wouldn't listen to Jon. We see Jon reunited with his siblings and the episode is filled with tying up loose ends and seeing happiness for the first time in a long time with Jon, Arya, Sansa, etc. Then something happens. It's too late. The undead are coming in hordes as one was screaming at the gates of Winterfell and killed 3 guards before being slain. A man comes running to Jon and Dany and Jon whispers ""Winter has come."" Jon and Dany each get on a dragon to fly and try to find the Night King. But all they see are millions upon millions of undead. The greatest battle happens, The Long Night at Winterfell (good this time). Everyone is fighting for their lives. Arya, Sansa, Jon, Dany, the Unsullied. Nobody goes into the crypts because it's filled with dead people duh. 
     THEN the Night King shows his face as he rides on a blue flaming Skeletal horse. His army slays one of the dragons. He brings it back to life. Now he's unstoppable. One by one we see every character we love die. Sansa is found by a White Walker and Arya tries to save her screaming and kills it, but then another White Walker stabs her in the back as Sansa screams and a horde of undead throw her on the ground. Their hands both reaching out for each other in their final moments. We see Dany riding a dragon fighting her undead son and loses the battle and falls off the dragon as it dies and becomes undead as well. She runs to try to find Jon and calls out to Jon. Jon fights his way to her. They hold on to each other as hard as they can because they know unless they find the Night King they'll die. Then we see the Night King on his horse. His undead army standing back as this is personal. He rides towards them icy spear in hand. Dany calls for her only living son but nothing happens and she fears the worst. Jon puts Dany behind him and draws his sword. The Night King stops and we hear a roar in the distance. The only living dragon is being controlled by Bran. He's not a crow. He's a dragon. And he sees everything. He knew taking control of that dragon gave them the only chance of survival. 
     We see an epic battle as Jon slays the Night King's horse and Dany battles the Night King herself with Jon on his way to help. We see Bran and the two undead dragons face off with Bran winning and killing both. A White Walker manages to Stab Jon in his shoulder before being killed by Jon in retaliation. Jon is now wounded. Dany is out of dragons. The Night King knows Bran will see any attack coming for he sees everything. He does the unexpected and lets Bran eat him. Then the dragon is frozen from the inside out and destroyed. We see the Night King on top of its frozen corpse. He makes a spear and tries to throw it at Jon but Dany sacrifices herself as the spear pierces her chest. Jon holds her in his arms as the Night King marches. Jon is scared for the second time. First being in his battle against that bastard Ramsay and his army. Jon knows he doesn't stand a chance his shoulder is wounded and bleeding out. He tells Dany he loves her, gets up, carries his sword. He knows he stands no chance, but when we face defeat do we simply accept it? No, we spit in defeat's face and put up a fight with all we have. It's better to lose fighting than give up dying. He charges the Night King, the Night King grabs him by the neck, lifts him up, and smiles before throwing him on the ground and beheading him. Everyone is dead and we see the Night King raise them all up. We see Dany's undead eyes and Sansa walk towards the Night King and kneel. Then it cuts to Cersei and present time. 
     Cersei walks around searching for answers as she sees almost no dead bodies until she finds Jon's head buried in the snow and the destroyed dragons not far after. She knows if something could kill him and three dragons this easily she may not stand a chance. She orders everyone to fall back putting on a brave face but she knows...she suspects Jon was right and Winter has come. As they travel back they see an undead soldier in the distance. Her armies are ready to charge before she tells them not to. The try to go the opposite way but as they turn around a White Walker in the distance stares at them. They've been spotted as he raises his fist and the undead behind them turn around and charge. We see Cersei's army try in futile attempts to survive, and The Queen falling back riding a horse to try to escape. She stops when she sees a familiar hand. Her brother with his back turned. She calls out to him but he does nothing. She walks towards him and puts her hand on his shoulder, his skin ice to the touch, she screams in horror and his undead face turns to see her and attacks her. She runs towards the horse and grabs a sword and manages to cut his head off as she's screaming and crying. Her love is dead at her hands and she's frightened, in the rarest sight of the show, she is no longer the strong fearless tyrant, she's a scared nobody. Her army is being destroyed, she has no enemies, she killed the love of her life, she has nothing, she is nothing. Then an undead Dany finds her and they face off with Dany winning. Cersei's final words are ""Go fuck yourself"" in classic bitchery she's so good at, even when scared to death. She dies and we see the Night King travel to King's landing bringing a blizzard with him. Then we see King's Landing frozen over, nothing but undead inhabit it. We see the Night King destroy the Iron Throne by freezing it so much it crumbles. Then he makes a new throne, his throne. Out of ice and victory. The last thing we see is him sitting upon it. His undead army kneeling at his feet. The Night King won, and winter is here to stay.

Dany is out of dragons. The Night King knows Bran will see any attack coming for he sees everything. He does the unexpected and lets Bran eat him. Then the dragon is frozen from the inside out and destroyed. We see the Night King on top of its frozen corpse. He makes a spear and tries to throw it at Jon but Dany sacrifices herself as the spear pierces her chest. Jon holds her in his arms as the Night King marches. Jon is scared for the second time. First being in his battle against that bastard Ramsay and his army. Jon knows he doesn't stand a chance his shoulder is wounded and bleeding out. He tells Dany he loves her, gets up, carries his sword. He knows he stands no chance, but when we face defeat do we simply accept it? No, we spit in defeat's face and put up a fight with all we have. It's better to lose fighting than give up dying. He charges the Night King, the Night King grabs him by the neck, lifts him up, and smiles before throwing him on the ground and beheading him. Everyone is dead and we see the Night King raise them all up. We see Dany's undead eyes and Sansa walk towards the Night King and kneel. Then it cuts to Cersei and present time. 
     
Cersei walks around searching for answers as she sees almost no dead bodies until she finds Jon's head buried in the snow and the destroyed dragons not far after. She knows if something could kill him and three dragons this easily she may not stand a chance. She orders everyone to fall back putting on a brave face but she knows...she suspects Jon was right and Winter has come. As they travel back they see an undead soldier in the distance. Her armies are ready to charge before she tells them not to. The try to go the opposite way but as they turn around a White Walker in the distance stares at them. They've been spotted as he raises his fist and the undead behind them turn around and charge. We see Cersei's army try in futile attempts to survive, and The Queen falling back riding a horse to try to escape. She stops when she sees a familiar hand. Her brother with his back turned. She calls out to him but he does nothing. She walks towards him and puts her hand on his shoulder, his skin ice to the touch, she screams in horror and his undead face turns to see her and attacks her. She runs towards the horse and grabs a sword and manages to cut his head off as she's screaming and crying. Her love is dead at her hands and she's frightened, in the rarest sight of the show, she is no longer the strong fearless tyrant, she's a scared nobody. Her army is being destroyed, she has no enemies, she killed the love of her life, she has nothing, she is nothing. Then an undead Dany finds her and they face off with Dany winning. Cersei's final words are ""Go fuck yourself"" in classic bitchery she's so good at, even when scared to death. She dies and we see the Night King travel to King's landing bringing a blizzard with him. Then we see King's Landing frozen over, nothing but undead inhabit it. We see the Night King destroy the Iron Throne by freezing it so much it crumbles. Then he makes a new throne, his throne. Out of ice and victory. The last thing we see is him sitting upon it. His undead army kneeling at his feet. The Night King won, and winter is here to stay.

(*Spoilers Ahead*),https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/cme4ic/the_wolf_or_the_dragon_spoilers_ahead/,Seth_Rowling,1565026586,"Here's a question. My friend and I had been argueing the other day over a topic. Whether Jon Snow should be considered more of a Stark than a Targaryen, or vice versa. Personally I had argued for Jon Snow to be considered more of a Stark for the following reasons:

*All reasons based on Jon Snow from the GoT tv show, not the ASoIaF books as they are not complete enough for me to judge.

0. Small reasons; Physical attributes; Black hair, his accent, etc.

1. The most obvious reason is that Jon has simply been raised his entire life by the Starks (Ned Stark) and hadn't spent a single year with his (dead) father, Rhaegar Targaryen. Similar to the case of Theon, who had been raised by the Starks his whole life, and had always been embraced as a Stark by the majority of people he meets. And I quote, ""Stark had you longer than I did.""

2. Jon Snow had grown up believing that his father is Eddard (Ned) Stark, and had no clue about his true heritage, growing up believing Ned Stark's blood runs through him. And I quote, ""you may not have my name, but you have my blood."" Not to mention he had been treated as the bastard son of Ned Stark by every single person he meets, at the Night's watch (Ser Alliser Thorne) in Letters written to him (Ramsey Bolton/Snow) and at Winterfell (Tyrion Lannister) and I quote, ""A bastard boy with nothing to inheret, off to join the.. ancient order of the Night's watch."" As well as later on in the series when first reuniting with Tyrion ""the bastard of Winterfell!""

3. How badly he wanted the Stark name. Im sure many of you would remember when he had been offered to be given the name Jon Stark by Stannis Baratheon to which he had said that ""it's all he had ever wanted."" Which just goes to show how much the Stark name meant for him.

4. He was named king in the north by the northerners, a title reserved ONLY for a Northern man, usually of house Stark, hence the following phrases, ""There must always be a Stark in Winterfell."" ""We know no king but the king in the north whos name is Stark."" And for Jon to be elected king in the north almost completely justifoes him as more of a Stark than a Targaryen.

This is an excerpt from \*A Dance With Dragons\* between Bran and Leaf

&gt; Where are the rest of you? Bran asked Leaf, once. Gone down into the earth, she answered. Into the stones, into the trees. Before the First Men came all this land that you call Westeros was home to us, yet even in those days we were few. The gods gave us long lives but not great numbers, lest we overrun the world as deer will overrun a wood where there are no wolves to hunt them. That was in the dawn of days, when our sun was rising. Now it sinks, and this is our long dwindling. The giants are almost gone as well, they who were our bane and our brothers. The great lions of the western hills have been slain, the unicorns are all but gone, the mammoths down to a few hundred. The direwolves will outlast us all, but their time will come as well. In the world that men have made, there is no room for them, or us.

Leaf paints a sad and downer outlook, many animals eventually dying out, mankind bringing an end to many of them. Westeros was originally inhabited by the Children and many other species, both semi-sentient and animals, then the First Men came in and shit went down. Then millennia later the Andals came and even more damage, nearly wiping out the COTF. This is not an original theory of mine at all, I take no credit for this, just want to bring it here. So, let's take a look at this!

&amp;#x200B;

After the war between the COTF and First Men, the First Men adopted the faith of the COTF. The biggest part of this being the weirwood trees. This seems quite suspicious, the COTF coming to make peace, and then giving all the major houses at the time weirwood trees. As we know, greenseers can see through the trees and observe. This could have been for them to assess and observe what Mankind was up to, and how they could get their revenge. The next big part of this are the Others. In season 6 of the show, it's revealed that the COTF created the Others. I suspect that this is from George, though maybe D&amp;D changed some things around, mainly the Night King. This where I come in and give my 2 cents. Anyways, back to the COTF, Others, and 3EC. I suspect that the Children let the Others wipe out many people. Then the Last Hero went looking for them, hoping they could help in the fight. Eventually they did help in the fight, driving them all the way back north. I think maybe they came in at the last second to help and make it look they care about helping Mankind. Then they help build the Wall alongside Mankind and the Giants, making it appear they are on the same side. Then thousands of years go by and the Andals come and slaughter the Children. Yeah, the First Men tried to protect them, but that didn't help, the Children nearly driven to extinction. This would make them resent Mankind even more, not just Andals or First Men.

&amp;#x200B;

They then devised a massive takeback of Westeros, this being the Three Eyed Crow. I suspect that there are 2 possibilities with the COTF, Others, and Three Eyed Crow. Firstly, I subscribe to that the Three Eyed Crow is not solely Bloodraven. I suspect that the Crow is an entity that serves and works for the COTF. Bloodraven is rotting away, and the 3EC needs to find a new host. In Bran's dream, he says many others dead, with that ominous line ""Fly or die"". I think the purpose/objective of the 3EC is to end up in power and become king of Westeros. Now this comes into how the 3EC connects to the Others. I suspect that either the Crow is the one who is truly in control of them, commanding them or that it knows the Others, knowing how to stop them. I think that the show may have been right, with Bran not really being himself anymore, but the Crow. I suspect the Crow will allow for many to die, either controlling the Others, or just letting them kill many before swooping in. The Crow will then play an instrumental in bringing an end to the threat of the Others. This will lead to many respecting and admiring the Crow. From this, there will be many dead, the land in disarray. Bran aka 3EC will be chosen to become king and rule whatever is left of the Seven (or Six) Kingdoms. So, the COTF finally get their revenge, they have placed their puppet into power, and now the COTF have taken their land back from Mankind. Crazy, but what do you think?",4,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

big fan of the GOT series, haven't finished seeing it yet (I'm currently watching The Long Night battle). I also haven't read any of the books.

I've been thinking and have a theory about the three eyed raven (character played by Struan Rodger). I'm sorry if this has already been discussed or if this sounds silly.

I believe that the Struan Rodger character three eyed raven is actually old Brandon Stark from the future. As we've seen Bran being able to move backwards in time and witness events of the past, we are also hinted that his presence could be felt by young Eddard Stark right before climbing to the tower where Lyanna Stark was held. Even more so, he's able to get into young Hodor's mind.

It is possible that Bran expands his abilities over the years, until he gets the age of the old three eyed raven and then he realizes he can actually change the past. Since he's aware of how he became the three eyed raven, he knows that he actually has to go to the past to help himself knowing this will mean his death brought on by the Night King.

Or did he die? We've seen Bran returning from his vision (trip to the past) back to the present. Maybe the old three eyed raven returned to his ""present"" seeing that his mission is complete. Or, maybe he did die because he was not able to return to his ""present"" just like he warned Bran as beeing one of the dangers of the past visions.

&amp;#x200B;

what do you think? am I way off?

&amp;#x200B;

thanks,

John",10,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Plenty feel that it doesn't make sense, and that his story is tied to the North. While I agree that his ascending to such a position is not something I'd have anticipated, as well, it fits when looking at it objectively.

When the election was unfolding in real time, I was shell shocked, angry, and thought the show had finally not only railed off the road, but crashed into the cliff side. But I digested it. And it hit hard. I began to appreciate it more and, cringefully enough, cried at it's thematic beauty. 

A Broken King for a Broken Kingdom, the imagery of a figure in a wheelchair ruling in the aftermath of the destruction of the uncomfortable looking Iron Throne, Tyrion's poignant point about stories being powerful and unwavering and difficult to defeat? It's sold me. 

I also don't buy that it's going to be ""darker"" in the books. GRRM is not about to have the 3ER and the Children of the Forest ""win"" by having a puppet rule Westeros. Isaac Hempstead Wright has already come out and said that there's still some of Bran left in what he is now. He'll never be the same again, but he's not the Great Other. And he won't become it in the books, either.  

Bran Stark is one of the characters most heavily shaped by the events of ASOIAF....A crippled rule perhaps being what a crippled realm needs is plenty dark, by itself. No Dr. Manhattan insidiousness necessary. 

There's also foreshadowing for it in ACOK when Catelyn calls for a Great Council, so that Bran could give his testimony to show how terrible the Lannisters are, as well as numerous sentencing throughout the series when Bran is mentioned in the same breath as previous Kings of Winter.

Shakespeare's Richard III also had an influence on GRRM. We've known this for a while.

Jon, Daenerys and Tyrion wanted to make the world a better place and they did in a way. Just not in the way they wanted it to happen. Although they changed the world forever, Jon and Tyrion will always bring inside them the weight of their final decision about Daenerys.

Daenerys going mad was something that had to occur but there shouldve been a season of her reign. In Essos, Daenerys received a lot of love but she didnt receive much in Westeros. That wouldve had an impact on her wellbeing. She was also losing a lot of people due to death and betrayal. Although, I do not think those reasons wouldve driven her mad, instead it wouldve made her upset  maybe made her fall into an episode of depression. I thought it wouldve been interesting to see a Dany who would commit suicide because ruling Westeros wasnt all she thought it to be. I do like the idea of Daenerys going mad, but it just didnt fit with the show.

I think there also shouldve been a season focused on the White Walkers. That couldve been season 8. Perhaps it couldve been after Danys reign (but this wouldnt have fit with season 7, so more would have had to be changed).

Daenerys going mad was something that had to occur but there shouldve been a season of her reign. In Essos, Daenerys received a lot of love but she didnt receive much in Westeros. That wouldve had an impact on her wellbeing. She was also losing a lot of people due to death and betrayal. Although, I do not think those reasons wouldve driven her mad, instead it wouldve made her upset  maybe made her fall into an episode of depression. I thought it wouldve been interesting to see a Dany who would commit suicide because ruling Westeros wasnt all she thought it to be. I do like the idea of Daenerys going mad, but it just didnt fit with the show.

I think there also shouldve been a season focused on the White Walkers. That couldve been season 8. Perhaps it couldve been after Danys reign (but this wouldnt have fit with season 7, so more would have had to be changed).

Now I consider myself to have good taste in movies and shows. But when it comes down to it, then one think I take into account is the writing. Now I know many of you guys believe Season 8 has bad writing. Now the only thing I thought was genuinely bad writing was Bran get the throne. But I liked all the other directions they took. I thought the battle of winterfell was epic AF, sure it was a little dark at times, but the writing was great. I also loved Danys descent into madness, I dont think they should have spent more time there, because then it would not be as surprising. The season was flawed but still great, it was just a tad rushed. But it still is a fantastic season. Yes martins writing is better. The first 4 seasons of Game Of Thrones to me are perfect. Seasons5-8 flawed but still great. I think D&amp;D did a pretty good job not following martins writing, Winds Of Winter is my favorite episode of the series, and it is not based of the books.

Here's one for the end of The Long Night.

Dany and Drogon remain occupied with Viserion. Meanwhile, Jon makes it to Bran just as Theon goes down. He and The Night King stare down and proceed to engage in combat, with The Night King getting the upper hand, and ultimately pushing Jon back/sending his sword flying. The Night King is flanked by the undead versions of Beric, Lyanna Mormont, Edd, and others, almost giving them a ""finish him"" motion as he steps back towards Bran. At this point, Wight Beric turns and stabs The Night King, causing the mass death of the wights from the show. As Jon stares at Beric, Beric removes his face to show himself to be Arya.

This would have accomplished a few things -

1. We get the Jon Snow vs The Night King showdown that everyone wanted
2. The Night King still comes out looking like the biggest bad ever, as it took major trickery to finally get him down, rather than just a quick leap and minor hand positioning shift
3. Arya's face changing technique serves a major purpose, and Beric's ""reason he was resurrected over and over"" arc gets even deeper, as it wasn't just that he was needed to protect Arya in The Long Night, but his body was needed to provide her with a vessel to kill The Night King",10,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

I dunno. I just struck me immensely when thinking of how her arc unfolds later on. I felt an enormous sense of empathy when I saw this scene that I had to share my feelings on it - and I have truly been lacking any kind of empathy for her in the past seasons.

Thanks for reading. Hopefully someone will experience the same Cersei as I did when re-watching.

Name one Lord Paramount in the entire Seven Kingdoms that couldn't have dealt with the rebellion of one or two vassals. Imagine Roose Bolton openly rebelled against Ned Stark, he would have been crushed. House Royce against House Arryn? House Royce gets crushed... I don't think beating a weaker bannerman and putting him to death is such a great achievement. 

The wealth of House Lannister came to be due to their gold mines - the existence of the gold mines wasn't Tywin's doing, either. Tywin wasn't rich because of his own economic genius or something.

As a commander, he failed considerably against Robb Stark, a young lad who was considerably outnumbered by Tywin's forces. Tywin lost battle after battle, and resorted to ""cheating"" in the form of the Red Wedding, because he realized that he wouldn't be able to crush Robb Stark in open battle.

He didn't manage to get Jaime out of the King's Guard, and his lack of care for his children resulted in them being incestuous (Cersei &amp; Jaime) or being riddled with hatred for him due to maltreatment (Tyrion). Tywin treating Tyrion like crap even resulted in his own death.

He was probably a capable administrator, somewhat savvy politician (although he always made the expected moves, allying with Robert once the rebellion was already won, allying with the Tyrells after Renly's death etc.), only mildly capable general.

Had Tywin not flat out assassinated Robb Stark via the Red Wedding, he would have lost. Had Renly lived, he would have lost (the Baratheon / Tyrell alliance would have crushed him easily...).

I am really hoping to go see the game of thrones concert when it comes to Toronto. My girlfriend offered to come with me but the only problem is she just started watching the show. Will she be safe from spoilers if she comes along with me ?

What/who is evil?, etc.). To do this, he creates multiple studies of male characters: who they are when their story begins vs. who theyve become when their story ends.

Consider Jaime, whose sole purpose as a transformative character is to follow a path from being a bad man to becoming a good man. In order for Jaime to find redemption, he must successfully negotiate or conquer any obstacles blocking his path to becoming a ""good man""  Here, the primary one is his incestuous relationship w/ sister Cersei (and also the nutso relationship with the rest of his family--Papa Tywin).

Yes, I am asserting that Cerseis primary function is as a plot device that enables Jaimes redemption. Typically, Martins female characters are at most plot devices and at least full-frontal eye candy. For example, Brienne is a plot device who serves the purpose of motivating/supporting Jaimes transformation from evil to good.  In the case of both Cersei and Brienne, once Jaime's transformation is complete from evil to good, neither is needed any longer and Martin may well kill one of both off.

here are my thoughts about an alternate ending:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Becoming the Nightking is something like an ancient curse. This curse condemns you to lead the White Walkers while it corrupts your soul more and more. Over the first decades and even centuries of being cursed it's quite possible for a pure and true-hearted character to control the curse - at least some parts of it. So, you are able to lead the White Walker whereever you want to. But since the curse lasts over 1000 years your soul corrupts and you aren't able to control yourself anymore - that's when the curse leads you to ""feed"" the death and leads the White Walker into Westeros.

What if, the Nightking's curse has already last for over a 1000 years and that's why he is invading Westeros? Even if all mankind would fight together, they can't defeat death. But, what if, somebody would choose to become the new Nightking? Of course, I'm speaking of Jon Snow, who would sacrify himself in order to rescue his Kingdom (that's something a real King should do) even if his Kingdom wouldn't have a King anymore. And to protect his love - even he would leave her forever! So, he becomes the new Nightking and leads the White Walker far into the North. 

Since Jon Snow isn't anymore, the rightful heir to the throne is Daenerys, because they married before Jon Snow sacrified himself (what's one of the very few options, Daenerys gets on the throne without harming anyone). But: Facing that her love is gone forever and additional facing that even her Dragons couldn't save her drives Daenerys more and more insane. 

Arya, who finally killed Cersei, must accept, that her list is a dilemma. Since a new insane ruler sits on the throne (Daenerys), everything is infinitely repeating. It all ends how it has begun. Therefore, Aryas list should be endless as well... an impossible task and a frustrating thought, which eventually leads Arya into suicide.

A never-ending circle of intrigues and madness...

So many people, myself included, spent *years* trying to decode the clues and predict the end only to be completely wrong, but she just keeps stumbling along the right answers!

Some examples of her predictions/reasoning:
     Bran will be king: because he's a cute little boy and she likes him
     She thinks Dany is ""so mean"" and ""she's gonna go crazy""
     ""Is Jon related to Daenerys? That [executing Slynt] seems like something she would do.""

So Littlefinnger leaves King's landing then and travel to meet Lysa then travel around for a while. All this time how come Cersei never wanted to chase after him or even suspect he might also be involved in the killing of Joffrey? I mean he disappeared right after Joffrey got killed.

Daenerys, however may not be remembered very well because she lived mostly in exile. I agree she burned King's Landing, and for that, history books may even crown her as the cruellest, but that's all she will be remembered for. For dragons also, maybe.

I was curious if anyone has read and captured some critical points from the book that wouldve made the show less confusing. 

For example, I find it really intriguing that they left out Brans first encounter with the Raven, hence the old man who was the Three Eyed Raven at the time. In the books they described Bran flying over the realm during his coma and saw all the characters who were in all the right places with the right people. Finally, he looked over and saw a desolate mountain with several living fire breathing dragons. I like this because it makes me think this is where Drogon took Dany at the end of the show. So she technically didnt bring back dragons. They were just hidden the entire time. Hence Bran saying I think I know where to find him. But in the show this was all left out and just had a scene of Bran opening his eyes. 

Lastly, they went in depth about the history of the Targaryens and how bloody evil they were. Which I think would shut down a lot of conversations about Danys tantrum at Kings Landing and how Jons real name meant nothing and was irrelevant to the show. In the books they described how Danys grandfather built Kings Landing  by using slaves and beheaded every single one of them who built the castle when it was finished. 

I havent had the time to read the rest of the series, but I will be working on it again in just a few weeks. I just wanted to see if anyone has their insight between the books vs the show that would clarify the events that happened.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

In a ironic fashion, she did break the wheel she so dearly wanted to break. Her death lead to an elective Monarchy. YAY TO DEMOCRACY! (Even a 1.0 version of it.) 

Our Khaleesi has always been the one to bring the burning fury of justice upon the evils and tyrants of the world. Since she hatched her dragons.  She has indeed faced evil people. The Masters, The Rulers of Qarth and Cersei. Everything she has done is to save Westeros.  But sadly, she lost it when she started to believe herself as the paragon of all that is just and right.

I forgot the exact odds, but the most likely contender was Jon, but surprisingly enough at the time, the runner up was Bran.

Now, I asked my roommate if he cared about spoilers, and he didn't, so I basically gave him the rundown of why it was most likely gonna be Jon and how it DEFINETLY wasn't going to be Bran, and how odd it was that the odds were so heavily in his favor etc...

So I recently started watching GoT because of all the hype and ended up binge watching the whole thing in 2 months. So my opinion on the show is fresh and without any hindsight.
I absolutely loved it all around. I liked season 8 up until episode 3 where Arya killed the Night King. I was so glad it was her and the scene was epic imo. 

But then I was so disappointed at Daenerys' choice to burn the whole city to the ground. She killed herself at this moment. During the whole series she was hyped up to be on the iron throne but decides to screw everything up at the end. And she didn't even sit on the throne IIRC. 
Moreover, I think Jaime and Cersei had the lamest death ever.

I like Bran as the King but I wish Sansa was queen of the seven (or six) kingdoms and Bran the king in the north. 

So that's my opinion. Sorry if it doesn't make sense but I saw the last episode yesterday so I'm still emotional.

Ok. Ha-ha-ha. So, HBO president of programming Casey Blays responded to the petition saying, obviously that a remake could never happen. Alright, I knew that. But then I found out about some more stuff they said, how an ending always divides people and people always want it to end differently in their own way. Sophie Turner even called the petition insulting to the cast and crew. Ok, first of all *we do not hate the ending*, I feel like most people are ok with how it *could* have ended. But it didn't, it ended in a horrible, rushed mess that D. B. and David are responsible for. Someone even congratulated them on how the season was well done. It really hurts me to see even some of the actors support the producers. But whatever, I knew there wasn't going to be a remake but to go to such lengths as to say that *some* of us don't lile it because we want it to end our own way? Yeah, nice try.

I'm Alix and I am a die - hard fan of Game of Thrones. I am passionate in every single way, from reading the books, attending conventions, watching the show, cosplaying, annnnd lurking this reddit since season six xD In fact this is my first post EVER on reddit!

Alright, to what this post is actually about. In short, I own a discord server that is mainly focused on Game of Thrones, Lord of The Rings, gaming, other fandoms, memes, etc. Even though I am a die - hard Thrones fan, I tried to make it clear that the community is welcoming to everyone!

However, after I added Westeros Houses to roles for server events, games, and simulatonsthe anime community on my server had some words for us xD

Basically, when a member joins, you can choose your Westerosi house to align with. Each house has a channel, where in the future they will choose their king / queen (Khal, Khaleesi, Warden...etc.) to lead and represent them.

In short, the anime community on the server claims that ""Game of Thrones is just a shitty anime for tasteless White People"". Being the only die - hard fan on the server right now, my defense was easily overrun by 'the weebs'. Of course I could take the evil route and kick them, but that's boring. From the years of lurking here, I know if anywhere this is where I'm gonna find other people like me that want to defend Thrones. I'm not saying to come prove them wrong and show them how amazing we are....but ya know, if you want to that would be cool as fuck too. :)

Regardless thanks for reading everyone :)

That episode in particular looks absolutely beautiful with the contrast that fluctuations to each pixel makes compare to having all the pixels on at full power trying to differentiate between colours. The scene where Melisande lights the swords of the Dothraki looks incredible, honestly set the tone for the episode by giving that ambience of a glimmer of hope in the flames and then seeing all of those fires to out in the distance with the light and dark contrast is incredibly well done. Seriously, the episode gets far too much badmouthing for how dark it is, but when watched on the right hardware, it looks seriously beautiful. Also protip, if you want to watch it again, do so with a bluelight filter or slight amber tint in a very dark room, makes it very atmospheric as well as helps to reduce black crushing while still getting that saturation on the parts that do warrant the extra colour to really stand out.

Would Tywin, like Tyrion, get Daenerys to spare Jorah's life or would he counsel her to kill him instead? Would Tywin counsel Daenerys to take a more scorched-earth approach to dealing with the Sons of the Harpy and embrace more of her ''fire and blood'' nature or would he counsel restraint and pragmatism (kind of like Tyrion did)? How would the duo react to Jon Snow being King in the North, the White Walkers, and the invasion of King's Landing?

1134,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2019-8-16,2019,8,16,5,cqvbvt,self.gameofthrones,Daenerys WAS worse than every other ruler. Even before The Bells.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/cqvbvt/daenerys_was_worse_than_every_other_ruler_even/,ruffles2121,1565900164,"So I watched Lindsay Ellis' video, ""The Last of the Game of Thrones Hot Takes"" and while she made several good points, a few kept sticking out to me because she missed them so hard. At one point she says ""We're led to believe Daenerys[Executing Randyll and Dickon] is worse than Jon's mass execution or Ned Stark[Beheading the deserter]"". But here's the stickler. IT IS. I highly disagree with the death penalty, it's archaic and repugnant, but giving the desth penalty to criminals was a regular part of medieval society before extensive prison infrastructure was built. When someone is a criminal, the death penalty is considered morally okay by their standards, even by our own in some parts of the world. Daenerys' execution of the Tarly's was not giving the death penalty to criminals. It was executing prisoners of war captured in battle. People who surrendered themselves to you expecting mercy by the chivalric codes of the time, and in the modern day, the Geneva conventions. 

In both today and yesterday, executing prisoners of war was a BIG no no. Robb Stark refused to do it at any point, even to his lowborn prisoners. He executed Rickard Karstark, his bannerman, for doing killing a POW. Because Rickard had made himself into a murderer and a criminal. 

Lindsay doesn't understand this basic point and makes several more false equivalencies and illogical leaps. She brings in real world politics several times to make assertions that don't make sense in context. She says Tyrion's quote is a reference to ""First they came"" and gets angry that they compared slavers to Jews. But here's the thing, it's not. Tyrion was talking about her growing megalomania, her NEED to be the hero, to be SEEN as the hero, and her belief that she can do that through the use of violence. It's classic narcissism. Lindsay says at one point ""Apparently Daenerys just believed in freeing slaves TOO MUCH!"". But it was never about just freeing the slaves. It's not about an ideology of facism, it's about Daenerys as a character being a narcisstic megalomaniac. Daenerys' whole goal from start to finish, was to be on the top, for everyone to see her as the saviour, the ruler, the mother. 

Lindsay doesn't mention the red flags of her having a bajillion self given titles. She doesn't mention the massive red flag of ""They can die in their old world or live in my new one""(This could totally be a Light Yagami quote). Notice how she always said MY new world? Because in the end it was always about her. Out of all the rulers we've seen. None planned any invasions on the scale Daenerys wanted. None wanted to conquer and control lands that they had no right to, or they had never even stepped foot in. Because the message isn't ""Changing the world is bad"". It's ""Using aimless violence as your only solution is bad"".",0,1,False,self,,,,,

Drogon actually feels like he has a personality and is the one we see on screen the most. If Drogon died many viewers may have an emotional reaction, at least one more powerful than the lacklustre deaths of Viserion and Rhaegal. 

So here's the fix: have Rhaegal and Drogon make it King's Landing just fine. Then on the day of the battle, have the Unsullied and Northern armies storm the walls and take out as many scorpions as possible. Once it is sufficiently safe to send the Dragon in, have Dany on top of Drogon bust down the gate while Rhaegal helps the Dothraki fight the Golden company (specifics aren't that important here). The battle turns in favour of Dany.

When the sky appears to be safe, suddenly a scorpion bolt will whizz past Dany. She looks down and sees that it came from a crowded residental area. More will fly into the air, and Drogon will do a good job dodging but ultimately it's not enough, and once one bolt hits he is vulnerable to more. The Dragon will manage to make it back over the walls to safety before collapsing and dying. Filled with rage, Dany will mount Rhaegal and go on a murderous rampage, ignoring the use of human shields, callously burning the hidden scorpions and innocent bystanders alike.",30,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

Dany decides to take up the mantle of her husband. She takes his remaining men, his ships, his coin, and becomes Danaerys Stormborn, Pirate Queen. Her armada grow, as does her reputation. The Narrow Sea becomes so dangerous that trade grinds to a halt as none can travel it without first paying the Dragon Pirate her dues. Myr, Lys, Bravos, the Seven Kingdoms, they all raise ships to capture or kill her, and they all fail. Then, a fortnight after a great battle that saw the loss of the Seven Kingdoms' best and largest ships, Danaerys' armada appears on the Blackwater just before the dawn.

&gt;  
&gt;I hadn't read the scripts for the final season until the table read. I wanted to hear them around the table, without having read anything first. I sat on a plane next to Emilia on the way to the read-through in Belfast, and she had read them already, and se was like, ""Shit, Kit. You are in for some surprises."" That piqued my interest. (*Laughs*.) I didn't realize what was going to happen the whole way through until maybe half a page before Jon kills Dany. I remember my mouth dropping open and looking across Emilia at the table, who was slowly nodding as I went, ""No, no, no!"" It was a ""holy fuck"" moment, pardon my language. Jaw dropping. I was completely surprised by it, even though you can kind of see the path through the season of how it was getting there  and even the previous couple of seasons before that, once you can look back. But it was still a big shock to me.  
&gt;  
&gt;**What do you remember about filming the final scene between Jon and Daenerys?**  
&gt;  
&gt;We felt a sense of responsibility over it. We shot the hell out of it. It was essentially a page and a half of dialogue, and we spent three weeks filming it. They wanted to shoot every conceivable angle, every way, to make sure they got it the way they wanted it. When you're shooting the same scene for two weeks and it's a page and a half, it becomes a long exercise in concentration. You have to remember the energy you're bringing in, every day, and making sure it's consistent. With a highly emotionally charged scene like that, it's quite a lot, for *everyone* the crew, me and Emilia. It was tiring. It's one of the hardest things we filmed.  
&gt;  
&gt;**How did you come to terms with Jon's decision to assassinate Daenerys, and allowing yourself the ability to accept the choice?**  
&gt;  
&gt;It's that horrible conflict in a relationship: ""Do I stay or do I go?"" We've all been through it at some point  except this one involves a knife. (*Laughs*.) So, the stakes are even higher. But that's the way I looked at it: ""Do I leave my lover?"" It was the same kind of thing between Jon and Ygritte \[Rose Leslie\] earlier in the series, betraying someone he loves for the greater good. But what it really comes down to, the real crux of it, is the decision is made when she puts it between her and his family. Jon essentially sees it as Daenerys or Sansa and Arya, and that makes his mind up for him. He choose blood over, well, his other blood. But he chooses the people he has grown up with, the people his roots are with, the North. That's where his loyalties lie in the end. That's when he puts the knife in.  
&gt;  
&gt;**From the start, at its heart,** ***Game of Thrones*** **is an exploration of family what you're born into, what you can leave and what you can't help but keep. Jon Snow was a key avatar of those questions, given his origin as a ""bastard,"" and his role as both Stark and Targaryen. What do you think Jon's choice  killing Daenerys to protect the Starks  tells us about the series' key theme of family?**  
&gt;  
&gt;It was said a long time ago, and I agree with it, that *Thrones* really is about dysfunctional families. It's about mothers, brothers and sisters, but it's also about how far your blood will stretch in your decision making. That's the ultimate choice Jon is left with. He's faced with someone he loves as his lover  who he *is* related to but his loyalty is with the people and the part of the world where his roots are, the people who raised him. As much as he was an outcast from that group as a bastard, and even though Jon became the legitimate heir to the throne, he will always be of the North. He'll always be a bastard of the North. He's always done the honorable thing, and Tyrion \[Peter Dinklage\] appeals to that: ""Do the honorable thing. Do the right thing. Do the *hard* thing, but do the *right* thing."" At the end of it, it's beyond honor for Jon. It's his family.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Your final scene doubles as the final scene of the series: Jon Snow leading the Free Folk back into the true North. How did you read that final moment?**  
&gt;  
&gt;I loved it. When I read it, that bit really made me cry. What *really* made me cry was on the paper: ""End of *Game of Thrones*."" But as far as an ending for Jon Snow, this character that I loved for so many years and had grown so close to, and had meant so much to me  seeing him go beyond the Wall back to something true, something honest, something pure with these people he was always told he belongs with  the Free Folk it felt to me like he was finally free. Instead of being chained and sent to the Wall, it felt like he was set free. It was a really sweet ending. As much as he had done a horrible thing \[in killing Daenerys\], as much as he had felt that pain, the actual ending for him was finally being released.  
&gt;  
&gt;**In the spirit of pain, how painful was it to film the dragon-riding scenes this season, and how much of a different experience was it to film the sprawling battles of ""The Long Night"" as opposed to something like ""Battle of the Bastards"" in season six? Completely different animals?**  
&gt;  
&gt;Completely. I was on the back of that buck \[the rig used for filming the dragon-riding scenes\] for longer than we filmed the entire ""Battle of the Bastards."" Emilia had been moaning about it for seasons, and I was like, ""Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever. You have not been through the mud in Northern Ireland. A buck in a nice warm room? Boo hoo."" But she was absolutely right. It was horrific. It's not acting at all. It is *not* acting, it *never* will be acting, and it is *not* what I'd signed up for. (*Laughs*.) But it looked great, right? It just felt horrible! It is very uncomfortable as a man.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Not recommended?**  
&gt;  
&gt;Not recommended, no. I don't think I can have children now. (*Laughs*.) I loved ""The Long Night."" I loved working with \[Miguel Sapochnik\], one of my favorite directors I have ever worked with. As tough as it was, it was *Thrones*, man. It was *Thrones*! It was everything *Thrones* should have been. It's a full set built, hundreds of extras throwing everything they had into it, all of us as a big ensemble cast  I loved it. I hated it at the time, but I love it, looking back on it. I have some really fond memories of that whole experience.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Many fans were shocked when Arya (Maisie Williams) killed the Night King (Vladimir Furdik) instead of Jon Snow. What was your reaction when you saw how it would play out?**  
&gt;  
&gt;I was a bit pissed off, only because I wanted to kill the Night King! I think I felt like everyone else did, in that it had been set up for a long time, and then I didn't get to do it. But I was so happy for Maisie and Arya. I was secretly like, ""I wanted to do that!"" Especially because I love fighting with Vlad, who also played the White Walker I fought at Hardhome. I've never seen a better swordsman. But it was a really great twist, and it tied up Maisie's journey in a really beautiful way. Over the seasons, we've seen her build up these skills to become this hardened assassin, and she uses it all to kill our main antagonist.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Any thoughts on the fan theory that Jon shouted Arya on and encouraged her to kill the Night King, or is it just flatly ridiculous?**  
&gt;  
&gt;Yeah, come on. What, the big man goes and tells the little girl to go and \[do it\]? No thanks. That's crap. She did it all on her own. It had nothing to do with Jon.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Favorite line of dialogue of the season?**  
&gt;  
&gt;It's not mine, but it's when Jon and Sansa are talking about Daenerys. I say, ""She's not her father."" Sansa responds: ""No, she's far prettier.""  
&gt;  
&gt;**Did you have any rituals to get into the mindset of Jon Snow while you were shooting any music you would play before getting on set?**  
&gt;  
&gt;No, I think I used to back in seasons one and two. I would hype myself up into it. But in reality, like so much in *Thrones*, the art department does it for you. I'm not taking away from how I got into the character, but every day, I have these layers and layers of leather and costume on, and the weight of it would give me that feeling of the character. It's a serious answer to what's supposed to be a lighthearted question, I'm sure, but did I listen to any music? Yes: ""We Are Family"" by Chic.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Is there a prop or costume from** ***Thrones*** **you wish you could have kept?**  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm still hoping for my sword! But they don't seem to be sending it to me. I'm still waiting, let's put it that way way. I'm still waiting for my sword, HBO! When is it going to arrive?

I like Daenerys, but there's something up with her (hear me out). She's an alright ruler, but she lacks motivation. Why did she want to become Queen? Because she thinks that it is her destiny, for her unborn son, and I guess also because she got that taste of power and liberation from freeing slaves. One key moment at Quarth, the Thirteen asked her *why* she wanted to rule Westeros, *why* they should give up resources to help her cause. And I think she was kind of stumped, saying something about her 'destiny' and her 'right to rule', and kind of, "" It is my birthright, you should be convinced that I am the best person for the job."" But, even though it was her birthright, she and her people were close to death in the desert, she must have realised how weak she looked.

She has never seen Westeros, never met, gotten a sense of the type of desperation, or has a determination to improve the lives of the people. She doesn't have any powerful allies in Westeros (in comparison to Jon Snow, Tyrell Lannister, Cersei Lannister). 

A lot of people liked her because she was strong and independent, who rose to power from a dignified slave, and I admire her. We can't deny her determination and resilience, and she faced a lot of sexism that has made a lot of the  audience admire her (including me). I do like her though, I just never understood her.

She just never really had the same drive as for example Jon Snow or Brienne of Tarth to put others above herself. She never learnt how to fight, because she had dragons and advisers to help her. Daenerys also has this mental wall, not telling people her decisions until it suited her, and not trusting anyone because she knew that her council wasn't that strong, so the audience doesn't know what she is thinking, how her mind works.

In conclusion, Many people follow her because she is the Mother of Dragons and the Princess who was Promised, not because she is Daenerys Targaryen.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

I personally just finished reading all of the books again and all the sample chapters of TWOW and honestly; it was the most fun Ive had on a re-read of the series (this was my fourth time). Ill break down briefly why I think the show and books seriously need to be separated when it comes to the enjoyment of the series.

First of all, although the shows is an adaptation of the books; it is in no way the whole content of the books. We have different dialog, different story arcs and different events that take place in the show that dont appear in the books and vice versa. So with that being said, how I have always viewed the show (at least until season 6) was that the show was set in the same world but different events happened. Almost like a different universe or something. This helps by distinguishing the two, the story is different in the show vs the book. Events happen that didnt happen in the book albeit changing the story. 

Secondly, with the two distinguished as two different stories that take place in the same universe this gives room to like either or. It doesnt have to be I hate season 8 therefore the series is trash and I cant even think about re-reading it anymore which sadly I have seen a lot. Just because the writers on the show dropped the ball doesnt mean GRRM dropped the ball! We all the love this series because of his writing..
  
Just too wrap up and clarify. This post is by no means to bag on the show, I personally have re-watched the show and enjoyed it again and re-reading was by far the best experience Ive had with the series. In no way did I ever think Brans chapters were pointless, I actually found myself heavily invested in picking apart his chapters because of what he might become. Just remember that the series changed a lot and a lot was taken out or rearranged. Theyre two different stories and that can be handled in a number of ways. 

TL;DR
The show and the books are different stories so therefore thinking that you cant re read the books based on how the show ended does not mean that is hows the books will end. Many things separate the two and the books are just as good as they were when you first read them.",31,1,False,self,,,,,

Let me know if Ive missed anything out. 

Season 7:

Dany arrives in Westeros and Jon goes to meet her to ask for her help with killing the night king

She accepts as long as he bends the knee, which he is reluctant to do, but they slowly fall in love with each other. 

Cersei is trying to take over as much of Westeros as she can to get gold. Jamie kills Lady Olenna and takes over Highgarden. 

Euron takes over the iron islands and tries to get Cersei to marry him by giving them to her, she sleeps with him to keep him working for her. 

Jon and Dany visit the noble houses of the north and manage to secure quite a lot of help to fight the night king, Dany makes a name for herself among the north as a kind and modern ruler. 

The south are reluctant to believe the night king is real, so they plan to capture a wight to show Cersei. The night king kills Viserion and turns him into a wight.

Jon and Dany take the wight to Cersei but she says she doesnt care straight to their faces. This is the part where Cersei tells Tyrion she is pregnant, and he begs her to help but she says the north can be ripped apart by dead men and shell rule over whats left with the only people who matter (her, Jamie and the baby). 

Jamie says therell be no baby and no us if the dead come to kings landing. They have a huge argument and Jamie says hes going to fight for the living while he still can. He leaves for Winterfell.

Euron is terrified and tries to run back to the iron islands, but the mountain kills him. 

The night king is ready to go south and breaks the wall with the ice dragon.

Season 8:

Dany and Jon return to Winterfell and they are adored. The North Remembers that winter is terrible and know about the prophecy of the prince who was promised who will end the long night. Everyone accepts that this is Jon and trust his judgement about Dany. 

Sansa doesnt trust Dany at first, but Dany tells her the north is hers after what she did at the Battle of the Bastards. The North will become independent, but with loyalty to Dany if the freedom of Westeros is ever challenged. 

Cersei sends Bronn to kill Jamie but he doesnt do it because he is offered High Garden after Dany takes over.

Brienne and Jamie reunite and when he tells her he left Cersei to fight for the living they sleep together the night before the battle of Winterfell.

When Dany learns that Jon is heir to the throne she worries if that means she will be forgotten about because of her father and that she is a woman, but Jon reassures her that she is his queen (this is the only time he says this) and he has no desire to rule. They make a joke about incest but its not a problem. 

Dany lets him tell everyone, and they all want Jon to sit on the throne, but he gives a speech about everything Dany has done and everyone seems happy with it. 

The Battle of Winterfell:

Bran is kept in the castle, protected by Theon, not in the forest out in the open. Theon and Bran have a deep conversation about everything that happened between them and he says how sorry he is. 

Most of the Dothraki are killed in the first wave, Jorah stays at Danys side.

When the dead come closer to the walls of the castle, Brienne dies saving Jamie.

Greyworm dies, along with half of the unsullied. 

Jorah dies jumping in the way of a wight that comes out of nowhere and almost gets Dany. 

The night king raises the dead and the people in the crypts are in danger.

Tyrion gets stabbed by a wight and dies beside Sansa, who makes it out. 

Dany and Jon decide to get on the dragons out of the way of the wights. 

The night king tries to fly to Bran but Jon and Dany are blocking his way. 

Drogon (and Dany) and Rhagal (and Jon) fight Viserion (and night king) in a big amazing fight scene above the chaos of the battle. 

Rhagal dies, falling out of the sky with Jon, and knocks the night king off his dragon.

As they are falling, Jon takes out his sword and decapitates the night king, all the wights die, Dany catches Jon before he hits the ground. 

After the battle:

Dany asks Jon to marry her and rule by her side when they take over Kings Landing. Jon agrees. They talk about children and Dany says she definitely cant have children. 

Jamie is devastated by Brienne and Tyrions death, and vows to get revenge. 

They march to Kings Landing, where Cersei says if Dany wants to get to her, shell have to burn the city first. Dany doesnt even think about doing this. 

Jamie speaks with Dany and Jon and says hell talk to Cersei about a surrender, and a pardon for her so she can have her baby and live somewhere overseas.

The Hound goes with Jamie. He and the mountain fight, both die. 

Cersei refuses to surrender, and gloats about finally being rid of her monster little brother (Tyrion). Jamie strangles Cersei, and walks through the city carrying her dead body (similar to the walk of atonement), and places her in front of Dany for the whole city to see. 

Everyone cheers and bends the knee to Dany and Jon.

Dany orders Drogon to melt the iron throne as a symbol of the new era. 

Dany and Jon get married and sit on new thrones with wooden carvings, dragons for Dany and wolves for Jon. Ghost sits beside Jon and Drogon flies above the throne room. 

Missandi is the new hand of the queen. 

Tormund goes north with the free folk as the new king beyond the wall.

Arya is the first female Lord Commander of the Kings Guard. 

Sansa is queen in the north, before she leaves she makes sure Tyrion is remembered as a war hero. 

Sam is the new Maester, he writes a song of ice and fire. 

Bran is the new master of whispers. 

Bronn is the master of coin. 

Davos is master of ships and opens schools for orphans. 

Jamie goes back to Casterly Rock with his new friend Pod, they share stories about Brienne and Tyrion. 

Theon returns to the iron islands which are now ruled by Yara. 

Dany works with her government to establish a new way of ruling after she and Jon dies, as they will never have children. 

Westeros is at peace.",9,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

So Euron's crew can board other ships or ram them and still be away quick enough to avoid being rammed or boarded themselves using just the wind. In the jammed battlefield.

1. Faceless Men have somehow perfected a makeup sticker that they can carry around and just slap it onto their faces. 
2. They just have really fast/magical hands that can magic some makeup on their face.

Act I was absolutely amazing, it was the War of the Roses with an amazing fantasy setting and super well written characters. The story felt more grounded and the dialogue and character development were incredible. Plus Joffrey, Tywin, Ned, Robb Stark, Robert Baratheon, and Catelyn were all characters that added a lot to the show, their deaths definitely came at a price. 

Act II is where things start to get dicey. The dialogue and character development started getting worse and worse, and the show increasingly became a generic fantasy epic type of story. Characters like Arya, Tyrion, Varys, and Littlefinger really suffered from poor writing, and they became shells of themselves. Plus on top of that the story, instead of being based on the Wars of the Roses, became centered around about ice zombies, dragons, faceless assassins, stone men, etc. 

Act III is where everything fell apart. The dialogue and character development were just awful. Plus the story was super rushed and it felt extremely contrived, plus there were too many plot holes and plot contrivances. 

As a whole, Game of Thrones is an amazing intro, squandered by a lackluster second act, and an awful ending

This is pure fantasy. 

I had saw a meme showcasing the desires of Jon Snow and what he would want to do, Kill the NightKing, Rule the North as King, etc. I realized that the Starks have really, for a lack of better words, fucked over Jon. Arya killed the NK, Sansa took over the North as Queen and he found out that hes not the son of a Stark but a Targaryen. 

With that information laid out, here is what I think would be a great sequel. 

Somehow and someway there is another Targaryen other than Jon out in the world. He learns of the death of Daenerys and all of the other misfortunes of his family. It angers him and like dany, he makes a campaign for the iron throne. He believes the 7 kingdoms should be ruled by a Targaryen, not a stark. He finds drogon somewhere in the realm and drogon now becomes his dragon. He is angry at the starks and is seeking revenge. He shows up to kings landing to seek a peaceful surrender from Bran and all others who control the city. They refuse his propose and the two go to war. Fighting for the throne like Dany and Cersei had. Obviously who ever wins the war wins the throne. 

I know its rough and the plot is messy but I havent put too much work into it because it will never happen and this is just my fantasy. This ending is based off of the ending of the series and not the books because GRRM hasnt finished it.

The whole season felt like the writer just gave up on the show.

As an example I'm going to use episode 3. First of all, why did everyone become so dumb all of a sudden? I mean, yeah, they tried to dumb all characters down in season 7, but come on. The whole war strategy they had made utterly no sense. Why the heck would they fight the White Walkers head on, if they had time to dig up ditches beforehand and set them on fire? They had enough time to dig up ditches, why didn't they make them a bit further away from the city walls to hold the WW further away, and why didn't they place the Dragons in front of the walls, so that any White Walker that crosses over these ditches gets burned to a crisp? Why charge at an army of dead people if they had two fully grown Dragons, ditches, a guy that literally knows everything, and a fucking army that could defend the city from the inside if need be, and Tyrion fucking Lannister himself?

Of course, at first, I was like maybe the had too because the NK had a dragon too, but they had two! They had a guy that could tell if the NK is advancing, and could give them information about his every move. Nope, instead, they just hand over Bran to Greyjoy to protect him from the NK. What the fuck? I don't know, but I guess they were just busy storming off every time someone said something at almost every scene that they couldn't build up a plan. 

I don't understand how such horrible writing could even pass through all people involved in production. This couldn't have been any worse.

Danys descent into madness, mad sense to me. Glad we got that scene with greyworm where she grieves over missandei. I also loved Varys death. He wasnt being stupid, he knew he was taking a risk. And it seemed tragic that Tyrion accidentally tatted him out. I also love Jaime this episode, yeah the never cared for the innocent line was weak. But him and Cerseis death was great. The cleganebowl was also epic. The hound is one of my favorite characters. And the two arcs for him was his fear of fire, and hatred of his brother. He had to overcome his fear to kill his brother. Thats great writing. Dany burning innocents, she was acting emotionally not logically. So much happened to her, from jorahs death, missandeis death, rhaegals, her advisors betraying her. The Bells was just the cherry on top and it made her go crazy. Reminds me of that line Varys had in black water The Bells they ring for horror. I also love Arya this episode, she hated Cersei so much but she was willing to die killing her, she had a life. And the sequence where shes running through the streets was amazing. Her telling them they need to keep moving. The mother helping Arya get up then dying, then Arya trys to save her child, some twisted stuff. Also the production, effects, acting, direction, and acting are all superb. This episode is not without its few flaws.

But then all hell broke loose and I was very happy Dany finally accepting being her true self, the Dragon, the Conqueror, like Daario and Olena told her. The blood of old valyria. A true King/Queen takes the throne by force, like Aegon or Robert. I hoped for it from the moment she said the first time that she would take what is hers with fire and blood. The deaths of Missandei and Jorah needed to remind her that only if she is strong she can win AND protect those she loves, she had to show no mercy to her enemies.

How I thought it would end after the siege:

Tyrion turns bitter, he didnt care a lot for the people, mass murder was clearly bad, Queen of the ashes like he said is not a good thing. But, instead of turning into a traitor, he stays loyal, he knows that Dany didnt kill Jaime on purpose and is very grateful that she killed cersei, who he realy hated like he hated his father. After all his revenge would be complete being Warden of the West, Lord of Casterly Rock und building his own Lannister Dynasty. All of them being children of the hated Imp. In this moment he realizes he fully turned into his father, he was the sond Tywin always wanted. He needed to be so he could have his revenge. That turns him into a very competent and efficient, but also into a very bitter, even more cynical and cruel Hand of the Dragonqueen. In his name he will weave webs of deception and intrigue, he will let the people of the realm mercilessly bleed for gold and influence, do whatever his queen wants him to do, while not being shy of making his house great again in the process. As long as he is Hand, no Master of Whisperers is ever appointed again, he personally takes this duties.

Jon his horrified by the war. After the siege he turns even more numb. Seeing that Grey Worm is executing PoW he tries to interfere but backs off when Grey Worm informs him of the queens orders. He is above all loyal the his superiors and holding up his vows promises und personal honor, remember he needed to die to be able to leave the nights watch. Just like the great Ned Stark raised him to be. He loves Dany, but is scared of her. For the sake of his ""brother and sisters"" he marries her and it turns in a very abusive relationship, she raped him multiple times, mostly after burning someone alive. Nevertheless he fathers a lot of whiteblonde haired, purple eyed children, which revives house Targaryen. As queen-consort he is not often allowed to leave Kings Landing, he doesnt like the south, but he grew so numb and emotionless that he didnt even care anymore. The queen even appointed him to be the royal executioner, he always liked to hang traitors. At one point Dany has Bran poisened by a red priestess and Sansa executed by fire. Arya was ate by Drogon as she tried to sneak behind him disguised with another mans face, she was about to kill his mother, but the dragon literally sniffed her out. No more human pie for her. Jon took all this, for honor and they did after all try to overthrow and kill his wife and mother of his children. De-jure he is Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, one of his children, the second or the third born will take this role after his final death. He never sees Ghost again.

Samwell Tarly becomes Grand Maester and uses his power and influence to dissolve the Nights Watch for good. He also does everything possible to rebuild his House and is caring for his adoptive son, helping his sister wherever he can. He and Jon remain close friends. When they drink and eat together it's one of the few moments where john feels something again. He blames himself, that his fahter and brother died.  

Yara Greyjoy, Queen of the Iron Islands remains a close ally to Daenerys I. She raided the riverlands multiple times and Lord Edmure Tully couldnt do anything against it, the queen turned a blind eye to it. In exchange, whenever a western kingdom tries to rebel, it turns into a favored raiding place for the ironborn.

After seeing the Dragon for himself above the Eyrie, Robin Arryn bent the knee unconditionally. For this, he remained Warden of the East, Lord of the Eyrie and Defender of the East.

Lord Davos Seaworth becomes Master of Ships and a trusted adviser of the queen-consort. For the Hand he turned into an invalueable source of information about the criminal underground in Kings Landing. He and his wife Marya live happy together. He remained sceptical of the new religion and the Lord of Light, but didnt oppose it either, the people should decide themselves, but he strongly advised against it, pointing out what it had done to Stannis.

Danaerys kept her promise and helped Gendry assuming his role as Lord of Storms End, Lord Paramount of the Stormlands and Warden of the South. Gendry married a very beautiful princess from Dorne and turned out to be a fair and just ruler, loved by his people and feared by his enemies. At first he was furious that Drogon had eaten his first love, but as he grew older, he saw it for what it was, he loved her because she was his first and she didnt appreciate his offer to marry her, she just used him for sex. He found real lasting love with his wife. He developed a habit for killing his enemies with his huge warhammer.

The Reach was given to Bronn of House Blackwater, he is now Lord of Highgarden, Lord Paramount of the Reach and master of coin. He, and therefore Highgarden and the Reach remained close allies to house Lannister. A Lannister always pays his debts. He marries multiple times and fathers lots of children and bastards. He drinks to much, eats to much and will be remembered as the worst master of coin there ever was.

Brienne of Tarth fought valiantly, Brienne fought nobly, Brienne fought honorably, and Brienne died. She died, being an example of knighthood, upholding her vows and protecting Sansa as promised to Catelyn Stark so long ago. She even managed to hurt Drogon, but ultimately the Dragon was to strong. Later Podrick said to Tyrion that she didn't only die for Sansa, she also died because of her. The ""Queen of the North"" was addicted to power and bad political decisions, she reminded him strongly of cersei. Tyrion only answered that he now thanks the gods that this marriage was never consumed, it would have been hell being married whis his would-be-sister.  

Podrick Payne bent the knee to the one true Queen after he was scared shitless by seeing his mentor Brienne of Tarth being torn into pieces by a very furious Drogon at the siege of Winterfell. Daenerys left him alive because of that and her Hand vouched for him. Tyrion took him as his personal guard and occasionally used him for special missions and violent enforcer of his will. He grew into a paragon of knighthood and loved taking part in knightly tournaments, always remembering his old friend and mentor Brienne, the toughest of knights. He also gets promoted by the Hand to be Commander of the City Watch.

Grey Worm remains with his queen as master of war on the small council. The Unsullied stay with the queen as her very large personal guard. Practically replacing the dissolved Kingsguard and making Grey Worm the de-facto Lord Commander of this ""new"" Kingsguard. They crush every opposition and take no prisoners. Every battle Grey Worm fights he sees as revenge for Missandei, he enjoys it especially at Kings Landing. Nobody ever defeated him in 1on1 combat, although many tried.

The wildlings never went back north, they stayed and replaced the many many killed people under Stark rule. For generations they will support Jons offspring as ""true kings of the north"".  

The Dothraki and the Khaleesi continue their crusade aigainst ""the wheel"", a never ending battle that honors the great stallion. Shortly after consolidating power in Westeros she ""rides"" with them back to Essos where they help Daario quelling several rebellions drestroying several cities in slavers bay for good. Slowly the Dothraki turn from a big tribe into a zealous religion with the aim of breaking the wheel in this world through eternal battle, lead by the great stallion and his god-wife the dragon-khaleesi from old valyria.  

But Danerys ultimately stays in Westeros, justifying multiple atrocities with ""breaking the wheel"" for the good of mankind and starts letting her people pray to her and the Targaryen bloodline, which is encouraged by red priests and priestesses which depict her as The living will of the Lord of Light, as she wields his fire and is unburnt. The faith of the seven soon fades away and gets replaced.",8,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

And after taking another look at the dream everything suddenly seemed to make perfect sense. The way I previously understood it, the fever dream mainly addresses Jaime's feelings of guilt for murdering the Mad King and failing to protect Rhaegar's family. But it was also clear that the dream had at least some prophetic aspects, as it foreshadowed the bear pit (Brienne repeatedly asks about a bear in the dream), Tywin giving Oathkeeper to Jaime (Jaime asks for a sword and Tywin tells him that he already gave him one) and maybe even Jaime knighting Brienne (""In this light she could almost be a knight""). But the rest of the dream now also makes sense if interpreted as a prophecy predicting Jaime's death as it happened in the show. Here are some examples:

&gt;*Naked and alone he stood, surrounded by enemies, with stone walls all around him pressing close. The Rock, he knew. He could feel the immense weight of it above his head. He was home. He was home and whole.*

This one might be a bit on the nose, but this choice of words could be seen as a reference to Jaime's final moments and the fact that he dies being literally crushed by rocks falling from above.

&gt;*He had no choice but to descend. Down a twisting passageway he went, narrow steps carved from the living rock, down and down. I must go up, he told himself. Up, not down. Why am I going down? Below the earth his doom awaited, he knew with the certainty of dream; something dark and terrible lurked there, something that wanted him.*

In The Bells, Jaime desperately wants to go up to the Red Keep to meet Cersei, but the gates are closed before he can reach them. Jaime has no choice but to descend a path that leads down to the watery caverns below the castle where the secret tunnels that lead inside the Red Keep begin. At the bottom of the path, Jaime runs into Euron Grejoy who can't wait to kill him (and more or less succeeds in doing so). Euron is the something that wants him. And Jaime's doom awaits him below the earth because he and Cersei later die in the collapsing tunnels.

&gt;*There were watery caverns deep below Casterly Rock, but this one was strange to him. ""What place is this?"" ""Your place."" The voice echoed; it was a hundred voices, a thousand, the voices of all the Lannisters since Lann the Clever, who'd lived at the dawn of days.*

Despite being convinced that he is below Casterly Rock, he weirdly doesn't recognize the place. This is not unusual for a dream, but could also imply that he actually *isn't* below Casterly Rock but below another castle that also has watery caverns underneath it (like the Red Keep where he fights Euron Greyjoy and suffers fatal injuries). Jaime also keeps being told that this was ""his place"". Maybe they mean that this is the place where he will die.

&gt;*""This is your place, Brother. This is your darkness."" \[Cersei's\]* *torch was the only light in the cavern. Her torch was the only light in the world.*

Cersei might be referring to the fact that this is the place where later in the dream the manifestations of his guilt literally come to haunt him. Or maybe his darkness is a metaphor for his death. Anyway, at the time Jaime enters King's Landing to reunite with Cersei in The Bells, he is pretty much throwing his life away. He knows that he'll most likely die but stopped caring about anything. All he wants is to see Cersei one last time. She has become his only light in the world.

&gt;*Crouching, listening, Jaime moved in a circle, ready for anything that might come out of the darkness. The water flowed into his boots, ankle deep and bitterly cold. Beware the water, he told himself. There may be creatures living in it, hidden deeps . . . From behind came a great splash. Jaime whirled toward the sound . . . but the faint light revealed only Brienne of Tarth, her hands bound in heavy chains.*

The dream repeatedly warns Jaime about something evil coming out of the water to attack him. This insistence is kinda odd since throughout the entire dream, Brienne is the only one who comes out of water. So maybe the warning was about a future situation in a similar setting where Euron Greyjoy comes out of the water to kill him. The creatures living hidden in the depths of the water could be krakens, the sigil of House Greyjoy. I also like about the dream that when something *does* come out of the water, it is not some creature as Jaime expected but a human in *irons* (Iron Islands pun intended).

&gt;*""Do they keep a bear down here?"" Brienne was moving, slow and wary, sword to hand; step, turn, and listen. Each step made a little splash. ""A cave lion? Direwolves? Some bear? Tell me, Jaime. What lives here? What lives in the darkness?"" ""Doom."" No bear, he knew. No lion. ""Only doom.""*

I love about this part that all her guesses are sigils of one of the Great Houses of Westeros. It's as if they're discussing from which House the one who will be Jaime's doom comes from. The three Houses they rule out are Lannister, Stark and Mormont (looks like I should have known that neither Cersei nor the Northerners in Winterfell will kill Jaime).

Fever dream aside, there is another thing that I really liked about Jaime's death. The German YouTube channel ""Nerdkultur"" made an awesome video about the pattern of GOT character deaths:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EzFBI4tgY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EzFBI4tgY)

(I'm sure many other people discovered this, it's just where I personally saw this theory for the first time.)

They explain that how and when a character dies is never random and has a certain sense of divine justice about it: most characters die the same way they previously killed other people (like Ned Stark, whose first scene shows him using Ice to behead a deserter and who is later with the same sword beheaded as a traitor himself, or Ramsey who is killed by his own bloodhounds, or Olenna Tyrell who poisoned Joffrey and is in the end poisoned herself (even though Jaime at that point didn't even know yet that she was the one who poisoned Joffrey)). Jaime's most character-defining killing which everybody despises him for is the murder of the king he had sworn to die for (he already received his punishment for pushing Bran from a tower when he, too, was crippled by losing a hand and as a consequence the ability to do what he loved most). Jaime couldn't be the one who kills Cersei in the end since he would only repeat his crime instead of redeeming himself. But just like Theon Greyjoy, Jaime is not in a position where he can become a victim of the same crime that he himself once committed. Which is why they both have to die doing what they already should have done earlier: Theon dies defending both Bran and Winterfell, and Jaime dies protecting his Queen.",10,13,False,spoiler,,,,,

Where the fuck did Arya come from?  Why did Dumb and Dumber think we needed to be surprised by the Dues Ex Machina--that's what a Dues Ex Machina is, a fucking surprise--you don't need to hide the surprise so well it doesn't flow well, a better, though still shitty, surprise would have been Bobby B bursting out of the ground yelling **""Bow ya shit""** at the Night King as he grabs him by the ankles, giving Theon an opening to jam his obsidian cock into the Night King's ass--imagine NK's surprise!

Prior to the actual ending of the Ice King, I actually thought I'd managed to guess what the Dues Ex Machina would be: I was like ""Oh my god, I bet Bran's gonna realize he can warg the dead and just before the Night King wins, his army'll turn against or it'll become this epic battle of wills giving someone an opening to kill the Night King.""  Sadly, all I, and everyone else, got was Arya materializing out of nowhere.  

I hate how they teased Jon getting there in time, it would have been so fucking cool to see him fight the White Walkers, giving Arya an opening to the Night King--because while she is amazing, skillful, and talented she can't teleport or move faster than light.

This brings me to another issue I noticed while watching the episode: why did the Night King even need to kill Bran Cereal and why did he need to do it posthaste?  I know they sort of explain it away with Bran Cereal being the memory of men, but it's not like Bran's gonna run away, he's a cripple.  If the Night King focused all of his forces on taking the castle and establishing a perimeter around the castle, like a proper siege, then he could just take care of Bran whenever he felt like it, without fear of
..well anything.  

Another thing I'd have liked is for the Night King to actually fucking talk.  It never bothered me--and I don't think I ever even noticed it--until now.  He literally spends a ton of time just staring at people like a dumbass; it's not badass, it's not intimidating, it does nothing to further the plot and it's incredibly boring.  

I know that the NK supposedly wants to bring about endless night, but it never really goes into *why* he wants that.  There were so many different ways D -n- D could have addressed this, but they didn't; instead NK's bad just because he's the villain.  Honestly, I have to wonder if he was just so fed up with his own pointless existence that he let himself default to being a force of nature.  

The worst part is, during the whole neverending slow-mo before NK died was the perfect time for a bit of monologing!  God fuck it!

Last of all, Bran.  Fucking Bran Cereal, Mr. ""I must be stupid mysterious because I'm literally just a plot device now; the Three Eyed Raven is just on-set slang for that.""  He added nothing to the story and I wish Jaime Lannister *had* killed him when he pushed him out of that window.

I'm fairly certain Oberyn told Cersei he had 8 daughters (may have been 7 or 9, but he had 8 in the books). 

The 3 oldest daughters are dead but if we take the book characters as canon that leaves Sarella as the rightful heir to Dorne if she's legitimized and surely the nobility would prefer that over a new house taking over leadership which would cause political instability. What's to stop this new Prince from declaring independent like Dorne have wanted for centuries? 

What's even more interesting is that if we pretend Sarella doesn't exist or didn't survive than Ellaria's daughter Elia would be Princess of Dorne, which would just be so poetic. With everyone who played a part in Elia Martell's rape and murder dead and her niece who has her name being ruler of Dorne, I'd say she got the justice she deserved.

https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/22o8ua/season_1_questions_re_season_1_spoilers/

This is definitely a bit of bragging and self-aggrandizement and ""I told you so"" (though ""you"" is not anyone specific), but I just wanted to say I'D SEEN ALL THE FAILURES of D&amp;D since Season 1.  And I stopped watching at the end of SEASON 4 because I couldn't take the poor storytelling anymore.  

Almost all of my criticisms foreshadow failures that D&amp;D would continue to make up until the finale:

1. Tell, don't show: Cat is so smart!  (so everyone says)  But everything she DOES is stupid!
2. Leaving out important explanations from the books: Why did Ned take Arya and Sansa to King's Landing?
3. Fast-travel when necessary: Cat shows up in King's Landing like it ain't no thang.
4. Illogical character actions: Why didn't Jaime take Ned prisoner when he had the chance?
5. ""Forgot"" what someone had JUST said: Why does only one person die at the wedding of the Khal?
6. Varys is a ""master of secrets"": So he talks about his schemes in the least secret place and least secret manner possible.
7. Inconsistent battlefield tactics/effectiveness: Magical disappearing slingers.

Seriously, it's all there.  Every stupid writing and directing decision that D&amp;D made in Season 8, they ALSO made in Season 1.  It's just amplified to 11 in Season 8 (I presume from watching all the videos on youtube trashing the ending of GoT, as I haven't actually watched past Season 4, and don't see any need to).  

In my opinion everyone was blinded by the flaws of GoT because of its admittedly many strengths: fantastic actors, fantastic characters, fantastic locations, sets, and costumes, fantastic nudity, good special effects, the complexity and variety of the world, and the first time someone had given us a high fantasy setting in a rated-R format with sex and coarse language.  

But the writing has been SHIT SINCE THE BEGINNING.  As many have pointed out, the only reason the first seasons were passable was because D&amp;D had the books to lean on as a crutch for the first 5 seasons.  But I go farther and say, EVEN WITH THAT CRUTCH, D&amp;D are just bad at writing (translating book to screen) and have problems with on-screen continuity (directing).  Unlike many of you, I was not surprised by the drop off in quality once they ran out of book material, as the signs of incompetence were all there to see from early on if you cared to look with a critical eye.  Go back and rewatch the first seasons without your rose-tinted glasses (if you can bare to, knowing now how it ends), and see if I'm not wrong.",20,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

I had a super vivid dream that next year, before the GoT prequel comes out HBO will announce a secret,  feature-length GoT special they have been working on. Fast forward to the premiere of the secret special that they havent released any info on other than stating it truly ties the ending of the story together and that HBO had planned doing this from the beginning. (Yeah right)

Basically it picks up exactly 7 years after the events of season 8 and it details the story of what our surviving characters have been up to. Arya and here crew (whats left) have been at sea for nearly six years. Theyve discovered several large and small islands over the course of the last 7 years, but finally stumble upon a large, fully developed continent. Tyrion is prospering as the HotK and even has a stable relationship with a common woman that survived Danis onslaught. Brienne has built up the Kings Guard. Lord Bron just celebrated the grand opening of Kings Landings first brothel (several already open in High Garden). Sam has written 4/7ths of the book Song of Ice and Fire but seems to have hit a major wall and hasnt added anything to it in nearly 5 years. Always promising to release the 5th part soon. (That was a joke and I didnt dream that). Gendry is doing great as the Lord of the River Lands, but hasnt married yet. Sansa has become are very cold but fair leader. The North has been the victim of many severe raids to the point of near rebellion. Most of the raids are due to scars that the white walkers left and the fact that many of the Lords dont believe a woman should be Queen or they believe the North should have stayed in the 7 Kingdoms. Sansa is so cold to the point she is doing the executions herself (as her father did) and almost enjoys them. her Maester fears for her mental stability and believes marrying a man will help melt her frozen heart. Its safe to say Sansa disagrees entirely to the point of threatening the Maester... subtly. That brings us to Jon... he has married a gorgeous wildling woman and  has explored the North further than anyone else. As the ice and snow continue to melt he and Tormund goes further until they discover an entirely new world North of the True North. A severely dangerous world that has many threats no one has ever faced... My dream then cut to black. But the sound of large wings slowly gets louder. Until the rhythm of the wings begin to match the rhythm of drums as the screen fades into a tomb lit by dozens of torches. The tomb is that of the Great Pyramid of Meereen. The dream pans down slowly to reveal a female corpse wrapped in loose rags. As the drums beat faster the dream cut to a zoom in of the hands. The hands although stiff and lifeless begin to shake. The dream then cuts back to a view of the wrapped body and the drums beat faster, the body begins to levitate until it is out of view. The dream cuts to black, the drums stop. Total silence for half a second then,  a loud, powerful  roar...

Again this was a NyQuil fueled fever dream I had last night. It was one of those dreams that when you wake up youre sad to realize it was just a dream and more than likely will NEVER become reality. I felt like sharing it with you all.",10,10,False,spoiler,,,,,

Daenerys didn't even give an order to kill them and he executed them anyways. You may say that Daenerys didn't have to give an order, this was a war. But remember the battle was over, Daenerys won so these soldiers are prisoners now. Grey Worm preceeded to execute them with that mad expression in his face like he didn't give a damn thag Daenerys killed innocent people. You know how Unsullied gets their balls chopped off so they won't fall in love? Yeah good intention but bad method. Love ruined Grey Worm but i guess chopping off balls didn't work.

Side note the day I got it I took them all out of the box and placed in on a shelf on there backs except for book one so today I wanted to put them all back in the box and no matter what order I try it wont go in since on is always short.

All the books are the mass market paperbacks which I know are pretty cheaply made so Im assuming the box is too since I havent used the other books and the first one at best just one crease on its spine but nothing else.

In  my post-Game of Thrones malaise, I've been on a rewatch of Battlestar  Galactica (BSG) and every now and then read up on the show online. In  reading about ""Daybreak"", the final three episode stretch that concluded  BSG, I saw a quote and citation on Wikipedia attributed to George R.R.  Martin criticizing the show's conclusion on LiveJournal. His comments  had some spice! I also had issues with the final episode of BSG, but the  entire series was generally pretty amazing from beginning to end. I  think only went off the rails in the final 3/4 of the very final  episode. Therefore, I think this is a fairly ironic take considering how  controversial the entire final season of GoT was for most fans. His  final comment hoping for a good LOST ending are funny and sad at the  same time, haha. I won't spell out exactly how I feel about GoT season 8  for the sake of post brevity.

Wikipedia page with GRRM quote: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daybreak\_(Battlestar\_Galactica)#Reception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daybreak_(Battlestar_Galactica)#Reception)

Full GRRM Quote on BSG ""Daybreak"":

Don't  read this if you haven't yet watched the  season finales of BATTLESTAR  GALACTICA and/ or LIFE ON MARS.  I've  finally seen both (we are TIVO  junkies, so we don't always watch shows  the night they air), and...  well...

BATTLESTAR GALACTICA ends   with ""God Did It.""  Looks like somebody skipped Writing 101, when you learn that a deus ex machina is a crappy way to end a story.

And now LIFE ON MARS ends with ""It Was All a Dream.""  Curiously, I  actually  found that a bit more satisfying than the end of BSG.  But  still...  really???  C'mon.  Writing 101.

Oh,  and while I'm at it, let me  spoil the new Nicholas Cage movie,  KNOWING.  I actually enjoyed that  one, mostly, although everyone else I  know who has seen it hated it.   But the ending... this time it was  space angels who did it.  And when  the little kids starting running  through the alien grass toward the  glowing alien tree, I almost thought  the boy was going to say, ""My dad  used to call me Caleb, but my real  name is Adam,"" and then the little  girl would say... oh, wait, you've  seen it?

Yeah, yeah, sometimes   the journey is its own reward.  I certainly enjoyed much of the journey   with BSG, parts of LIFE ON MARS, and even some stuff in KNOWING.  But   damn it, doesn't anybody know how to write an ending any more?

Writing   101, kids.  Adam and Eve, God Did It, It Was All a Dream?  I've seen   Clarion students left stunned and bleeding for turning in stories with   those endings.

Pfui.

(I  sure hope those guys doing LOST  have something better up planned for  us.  Though if it turns out to be  They Were All Dead All Along I'm  really going to be pissed).

1738,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2019-8-24,2019,8,24,7,cukogg,self.gameofthrones,[Spoilers] what was wring with season 8,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/cukogg/spoilers_what_was_wring_with_season_8/,SilvesterKlaasman01,1566597853,"Dear people, I've been thinking long about what was wrong with season 8. Below I'll try to explain as good as I can.

The show, from the start, has a dialectic dynamic. The term 'dialectic' comes from philosophy and it's used to describe how ideas and how situations change, progressively, in time. For example in some country there is a situation of peace but there is lack of justice. This causes the people to revolt, which leads to a civil war. After the war the head of state is replaced by the winner of the civil war and a new, improved situation of peace has arrisen. The dynamic of: peace - war - improved peace, is what we call a dialectic.

This dynamic is important for the show as confirmed by the words Littlefinger said and which were later repeated by Bran: ""Chaos is a ladder"" - in other words: chaos, whether it takes the shape of war or terror or something else, is also, simultaneously,  an opportunity to change things for the better. Watching the Game of Thrones was watching the chaos unfold. But it wasn't pointless chaos.

People who wanted to make things better were the red line through out the entire show. First Ned to help his pal, then Robb who was to avenge his father. Where Robb started a revolution however, the Lannisters planned a counter revolution, successfully. Robbs rebellion wasn't just destroyed, what was left of his house was driven apart or dead. Robb failed, the war ended but there was no improved peace, only the same old unjust one.

The next seasons we witness the emergence of two progressive forces: Daenarys Targaryan and the reassembling of House Stark.

What is important to notice is that all of these progressive forces have their own moral virtues that are decisive in their in the way they act. For Daenarys it's freedom, for Arya it is justice, for Jon it is honesty and for Sansa it is autonomy, or independence. That's why Daenarys liberated all these peoples, that's why Jon would only leave the night watch after he had died and later wouldn't lie to Cersei about attacking her after the night king would be defeated. That's why Arya went through hell to become a faceless man to set things straight for her family and that's why Sansa withstood all these horrors: to release the North of its chains. Tyrion might be called here as well, even though he is less driven by specific virtues and more by some sort of utilitarianism: try to achieve the best outcome for the biggest amount of people. 

This makes it pretty clear what the moral viewpoints are of the key characters. Wose moral viewpoints are a complete blindspot however are Bran's. Bran is, other than most characters not driven by any virtues like justice, freedom, honesty or even family honour like the Lannisters. Bran is driven by a thirst for knowledge. Now attempting to gain knowledge seems quite virtuous, but knowing things and attempting to know even more isn't a virtue in it self. It depends on how the knowledge is used.

Now let's get back to the dialectics part. The dialectic dynamic of the show is not just interesting because it helps us understand the pace of the show.  It also explains why the show was as popular as it was. Particularly for millennials it corresponded to our time. There wasn't just a power struggle between progressive and conservative powers, this struggle took place under the threat of an all encompassing danger: the night king and his army, which resembles climate change.  Thereby it became clear that with her deal with the iron bank, Cersei represents global capital in the same way the right wing politicians defend the interest of global capital in real life.

This is important because it granted credibility to the show. It showed to understand the timeframe it found itself in, which is key to good writing.

However this is also where D&amp;D messed up. The show, up untill season 8 had a rather progressive ring to it, with the killing of all the slave owners and such. Its not a meaningless message in times of such high inequalities and that's the strength of fiction I presume. 

However, D&amp;D were not ready to underpin, to display this message. First of all they didn't understand the necessity to first solve the struggle for the seven (or six) kingdoms in order to be able to deal with the larger, more dangerous threat of the night king. The way it went down, with first the long night, knowing Cercei's ruthlessness she surely would've profited from that. She would've had her armies ready to deal the final blow, to exploit this strategic error her opponents made by first pointing their weapons on the night king. She didn't however, and instead she waited passively in her castle for her odds to turn against her. If one character was completely out of tune in season 8 of GoT, it was Cercei.

This would've been one way to go, the other way being was to have the Targaryan-Stark alliance Cercei displaced from the iron throne after which they could prepare to take one the night king. This would've made the most sense dialectically speaking. The long night would've been the climax of the chaos, which also would've been the step of the ladder towards an improved peace. One in which the moral incentives of both Dany, Jon, Sansa, Tyrion and to a lesser extent Arya (cause she isn't much of a ruler) are synthesized. This way D&amp;D would've painted a bright picture for a generation that still has it's long night ahead of itself.

This also would've been nice because it really -again- could've been a critique on the global (western) left, whose radical and reformist currents are always in conflict. The radical left would be represented by Daenarys (crucifying slave holders) and the reformists would've been represented by house Stark, especially Jon (giving grace to a house despite their earlier betrayl).

They wouldn't however. Instead of this, they crowned the only main character of whose moral standpoints we know nothing. In hindsight however, they don't seem to be all that well. I mean if someone knew Daenarys was going coo-coock along the way, it was the three eyed raven. The only thing he probably should've said was that she wasn't alone, that things would turn out well, bla-bla and she would've felt a whole lot better. He.might've hinted Jon that he probably should really keep dating his aunt for the greater good, it's not like he didn't like her. He might've even swarved some large crows or eagles to force daenarys off the dragon on her burning frenzy (boy, wouldnt've that been a scene!).

The fact that Bran didn't make the slightest attempt to save this brave, good woman from herself doesn't plea well for him. And it puts questionmarks about the nature of Bran becoming king.

This doesn't fit the dialectic of the story because it solves a problem that didn't existed.  The problem of the seven kingdoms was the wide spread injustice, poverty and corruption. We have no idea how Bran relates to these issues, whether he perceives them as issues at all. Perhaps he's just warping to see where the dragon is?

Essentially D&amp;D project a perspective on the viewer that is completely irrelevant to them. They enforced some sort of liberal/centrist viewpoints that stand not only at the cradle of the biggest problems the millennial generation sees itself confronted with (inequality and climate change) but also is completely out of touch with the entire dynamic of the story. There never was a lack of knowledge (check out what Cercei's hand did with the mountain!) There was a lack of moral virtue. The game of thrones was about people who wanted to improve the world and it was won by someone who just wanted to look at it. No one knows Brans ideas about this, but just being able to see a lot won't do. For instance: how will Bran respond if the iron banks wants to put the slaves of Meirene back in there shackles because their stakeholders are upset? No one knows. To handle these things one really needs a vision of what the world should be. However the only thing Bran is able to see is what the world is.",4,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

1777,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2019-8-24,2019,8,24,21,cussaq,self.gameofthrones,[Spoilers]What went wrong with GoT season 8,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/cussaq/spoilerswhat_went_wrong_with_got_season_8/,SilvesterKlaasman01,1566649605,"I've been thinking about what lacked in the last season and I'll try to explain here as good as I can.

The show, from the start, has a dialectic dynamic. The term 'dialectic' comes from philosophy and it's used to describe how ideas and how situations change, progressively, in time. For example in some country there is a situation of peace but there is lack of justice. This causes the people to revolt, which leads to a civil war. After the war the head of state is replaced by the winner of the civil war and a new, improved situation of peace has arrisen. The dynamic of: peace - war - improved peace, is what we call a dialectic.

This dynamic is important for the show as confirmed by the words Littlefinger said and which were later repeated by Bran: ""Chaos is a ladder"" - in other words: chaos, whether it takes the shape of war or terror or something else, is also, simultaneously,  an opportunity to change things for the better. Watching the Game of Thrones was watching the chaos unfold. But it wasn't pointless chaos.

People who wanted to make things better were the red line through out the entire show. First Ned to help his pal, then Robb who was to avenge his father. Where Robb started a revolution however, the Lannisters planned a counter revolution, successfully. Robbs rebellion wasn't just destroyed, what was left of his house was driven apart or dead. Robb failed, the war ended but there was no improved peace, only the same old unjust one.

The next seasons we witness the emergence of two progressive forces: Daenarys Targaryan and the reassembling of House Stark.

What is important to notice is that all of these progressive forces have their own moral virtues that are decisive in their in the way they act. For Daenarys it's freedom, for Arya it is justice, for Jon it is honesty and for Sansa it is autonomy, or independence. That's why Daenarys liberated all these peoples, that's why Jon would only leave the night watch after he had died and later wouldn't lie to Cersei about attacking her after the night king would be defeated. That's why Arya went through hell to become a faceless man to set things straight for her family and that's why Sansa withstood all these horrors: to release the North of its chains. Tyrion might be called here as well, even though he is less driven by specific virtues and more by some sort of utilitarianism: try to achieve the best outcome for the biggest amount of people. 

This makes it pretty clear what the moral viewpoints are of the key characters. Wose moral viewpoints are a complete blindspot however are Bran's. Bran is, other than most characters not driven by any virtues like justice, freedom, honesty or even family honour like the Lannisters. Bran is driven by a thirst for knowledge. Now attempting to gain knowledge seems quite virtuous, but knowing things and attempting to know even more isn't a virtue in it self. It depends on how the knowledge is used.

Now let's get back to the dialectics part. The dialectic dynamic of the show is not just interesting because it helps us understand the pace of the show.  It also explains why the show was as popular as it was. Particularly for millennials it corresponded to our time. There wasn't just a power struggle between progressive and conservative powers, this struggle took place under the threat of an all encompassing danger: the night king and his army, which resembles climate change.  Thereby it became clear that with her deal with the iron bank, Cersei represents global capital in the same way the right wing politicians defend the interest of global capital in real life.

This is important because it granted credibility to the show. It showed to understand the timeframe it found itself in, which is key to good writing.

However this is also where D&amp;D messed up. The show, up untill season 8 had a rather progressive ring to it, with the killing of all the slave owners and such. Its not a meaningless message in times of such high inequalities and that's the strength of fiction I presume. 

However, D&amp;D were not ready to underpin, to display this message. First of all they didn't understand the necessity to first solve the struggle for the seven (or six) kingdoms in order to be able to deal with the larger, more dangerous threat of the night king. The way it went down, with first the long night, knowing Cercei's ruthlessness she surely would've profited from that. She would've had her armies ready to deal the final blow, to exploit this strategic error her opponents made by first pointing their weapons on the night king. She didn't however, and instead she waited passively in her castle for her odds to turn against her. If one character was completely out of tune in season 8 of GoT, it was Cercei.

This would've been one way to go, the other way being was to have the Targaryan-Stark alliance Cercei displaced from the iron throne after which they could prepare to take one the night king. This would've made the most sense dialectically speaking. The long night would've been the climax of the chaos, which also would've been the step of the ladder towards an improved peace. One in which the moral incentives of both Dany, Jon, Sansa, Tyrion and to a lesser extent Arya (cause she isn't much of a ruler) are synthesized. This way D&amp;D would've painted a bright picture for a generation that still has it's long night ahead of itself.

This also would've been nice because it really -again- could've been a critique on the global (western) left, whose radical and reformist currents are always in conflict. The radical left would be represented by Daenarys (crucifying slave holders) and the reformists would've been represented by house Stark, especially Jon (giving grace to a house despite their earlier betrayl).

They wouldn't however. Instead of this, they crowned the only main character of whose moral standpoints we know nothing. In hindsight however, they don't seem to be all that well. I mean if someone knew Daenarys was going coo-coock along the way, it was the three eyed raven. The only thing he probably should've said was that she wasn't alone, that things would turn out well, bla-bla and she would've felt a whole lot better. He.might've hinted Jon that he probably should really keep dating his aunt for the greater good, it's not like he didn't like her. He might've even swarved some large crows or eagles to force daenarys off the dragon on her burning frenzy (boy, wouldnt've that been a scene!).

The fact that Bran didn't make the slightest attempt to save this brave, good woman from herself doesn't plea well for him. And it puts questionmarks about the nature of Bran becoming king.

This doesn't fit the dialectic of the story because it solves a problem that didn't existed.  The problem of the seven kingdoms was the wide spread injustice, poverty and corruption. We have no idea how Bran relates to these issues, whether he perceives them as issues at all. Perhaps he's just warping to see where the dragon is?

Essentially D&amp;D project a perspective on the viewer that is completely irrelevant to them. They enforced some sort of liberal/centrist viewpoints that stand not only at the cradle of the biggest problems the millennial generation sees itself confronted with (inequality and climate change) but also is completely out of touch with the entire dynamic of the story. There never was a lack of knowledge (check out what Cercei's hand did with the mountain!) There was a lack of moral virtue. The game of thrones was about people who wanted to improve the world and it was won by someone who just wanted to look at it. No one knows Brans ideas about this, but just being able to see a lot won't do. For instance: how will Bran respond if the iron banks wants to put the slaves of Meirene back in there shackles because their stakeholders are upset? No one knows. To handle these things one really needs a vision of what the world should be. However the only thing Bran is able to see is what the world is.",11,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Okay, he didn't technically survive the battle. We all know Brienne killed him, and he would have bled out or been hunted by Boltons if he'd never been put down. But as we see, most of his arny deserts and only a few soldiers move forward to protect him at the front.

We see that he has a few pikemen in his army during the march, but was that enough to stop a large cavalry charge straight into him? Are we supposed to believe that despite being the Mannis and a competent fighter, he was able to retreat all the way back to the forest with only a few loyal soldiers? 

This scene stinks of bad writing, and I think it only served for Brienne to get her revenge on Stannis. He should've been killed in the charge or ensuing fight.

1909,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2019-8-27,2019,8,27,5,cvtz5k,self.gameofthrones,The Night King is a resurrected Rhaegar Targaryan,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/cvtz5k/the_night_king_is_a_resurrected_rhaegar_targaryan/,Hesham_Hany,1566852890,"OK that's a weird though that came to mind, it may not add up but it is just for fun.  Basically what if after Rhaegar died, some of his surviving soldiers took his body for a proper burial out of respect for their beloved prince, they travel far away and only find hospitality at Castle Black where is no wars for power or greed for fortune. And after a while, one of his loyal soldiers hears about the immortal wights and the whole pact ordeal and thought what if we make a pact with the wights to resurrect Rhaegar and they go forward with the idea and find the wights and make the deal thus turning Rhaegar into the Night King and his soldiers into his wights. This theory of course replaces the original origin revealed in season 6 that he was made by the children of the forest and all, meaning that at the beginning the wights never had a king like in the books and the Night King was just recent. Why Rhaegar became King is due to the fact that the wights saw him as their own messiah, their savior from doom and extinction by the children and humans alike see in my theory before the Night King, the wights never swang a blade and remained hidden but the Night King and his soldiers taught them warcraft due to Rhaegar's past experience. The Night King also has plans of his own, revenge against whom hurt him and his family. That's why he is moving to Westeros and to Kingslanding to take HIS rightful place on the throne. Now imagine the confrontation between Jon and the Night King, it's a father and son moment. ""Jon. I am your father."" and my ending would be a sacrifice from Jon after he realizes he can't kill The Night King after his war with Cersai (yes the Cersai stuff happens before the Night King and also he tragically kills Nissa Nissa  Dany after she tries to burn the city fulfilling the prophecy) Jon sacrifices himself to the Night King his father and becomes the Night Prince.

1910,gameofthrones,t5_2rjz2,2019-8-27,2019,8,27,6,cvu5o3,self.gameofthrones,[SPOILERS] The Night King is Rhaegar Targaryan,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/cvu5o3/spoilers_the_night_king_is_rhaegar_targaryan/,Hesham_Hany,1566853680,"OK that's a weird thought that came to mind, it may not add up but it is just for fun. Basically what if after Rhaegar died, some of his surviving soldiers took his body for a proper burial out of respect for their beloved prince, they travel far away and only find hospitality at Castle Black where is no wars for power or greed for fortune. And after a while, one of his loyal soldiers hears about the immortal wights and the whole pact ordeal and thought what if we make a pact with the wights to resurrect Rhaegar and they go forward with the idea and find the wights and make the deal thus turning Rhaegar into the Night King and his soldiers into his wights. This theory of course replaces the original origin revealed in season 6 that he was made by the children of the forest and all, meaning that at the beginning the wights never had a king like in the books and the Night King was just recent. Why Rhaegar became King is due to the fact that the wights saw him as their own messiah, their savior from doom and extinction by the children and humans alike see in my theory before the Night King, the wights never swang a blade and remained hidden but the Night King and his soldiers taught them warcraft due to Rhaegar's past experience. The Night King also has plans of his own, revenge against whom hurt him and his family. That's why he is moving to Westeros and to Kingslanding to take HIS rightful place on the throne. Now imagine the confrontation between Jon and the Night King, it's a father and son moment. ""Jon. I am your father."" and my ending would be a sacrifice from Jon after he realizes he can't kill The Night King after his war with Cersai (yes the Cersai stuff happens before the Night King and also he tragically kills Nissa Nissa Dany after she tries to burn the city fulfilling the prophecy) Jon sacrifices himself to the Night King his father and becomes the Night Prince. Ps. Dany goes crazy after she is manipulated by Cersai into killing Messandai when she hides her among a group of Lannister soldiers that she burns alive add to that Cersai manipulating the people of Kingslanding into fighting Dany by painting her as the evil foreign queen who will feed their babies to her dragons.

My grandfather, who rode roller coasters with me and waterskiied in his 80s, just passed away 2 weeks away from turning 100. He was in the British Navy in WWII. When we were kids he would read to my brother and me from Harry Potter and lord of the rings, (which always sound better read with a British accent), so when my brother and I got my mom (his daughter) in to game of thrones years later, we were not surprised that pop (our name for him), had started watching the show as well. 

My brother, mother, pop, and I loved discussing the show together so much that they all started reading or listening to the A song of Ice and Fire series as well!
My pop finished the audiobooks pretty quickly and he had a surprisingly keen mind for names and locations in the show. As an active older man with a British accent, my pop always seemed to have a special affinity for the ladies, so its no wonder that his favorite characters were always Arya and Dany.

My grandmother passed away a few years ago, and my pops health has been slowly declining since. He finished A dance with dragons and was keeping up to date with game of thrones as best as he could given his failing eyes. When we would visit him, we would watch the show with him to help explain whats happening on screen because he cant see everything. I remember watching the battle of the bastards with him and having to explain whats happening a lot because he cant make out the shapes in the battle, but he loved the episode anyway!

Pop had a bad fall last year, so he was in a nursing home this summer when the final season aired. When we talked with him on Skype, we joked that he shouldnt even watch the last season or just stop after episode 3 or whatever but he wanted to watch it anyway. My mom has been staying with him for the last few weeks and she watched some of the most recent season with him because he said he wanted to know how it ends. 

Over the weekend he was taken to the hospital for an infection that turned into pneumonia which led him to hospice. We flew down as soon as we could. My mom told me that in his ramblings he said he wanted to finish game of thrones. I asked her how much they had watched. Everything but the last episode she said. To that I said, Ill watch it with him tomorrow when Im down there so I can explain what is happening, and Ill exercise some artistic license to give him a good ending

I landed a few hours ago. And it was too late to go see him, so I am at his apartment, laying on his couch, planning out what story I am going to tell him about dany and Jon in the final episode, and my mom comes out to tell me that he just passed away, peacefully in his sleep, but I never got to show him the final episode..

I would just really appreciate some condolences and maybe someone can help me see the silver lining in this because I am very sad I didnt get to show him the final episode. I could actually use some humor, but please be kind and respectful to the passing of one of our oldest game of thrones fans, thank you and I love you pop!

I had this great theory in my head that the reason why white walkers were vulnerable to valarian steel was because it was forged with dragon fire.

And all the obsidian they used from dragonstone was there because of it possibly being built with the aid of dragonfire. Here's a quote. 

&gt;But the Targaryens managed to raise a castle here. Simpletons claim they used ancient Valyrian sorcery, forgetting that the Targaryens brought a small army with them from Essos; there's no magic in strong backs. Though admittedly the castle is unlike any in Westeros, foreign and... strange.

So I thought in the climactic finale, the wight walkers were going to get merked by waves of dragon fire. But nope. The night king wasn't even fazed.",3,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

So the original Three Eyed Raven , the one that was stucked in the weirwood, can actually see the future, but Bran has not completely learned and  cannot control this ability well because of the short time he had to train.  
The Three Eyed Raven, can see the future because:  
 **1.** He knew what would happen to Hodor, and encouraged Bran to warg into him so things could follow the timeline.  
**2.** When he was sleeping, Bran had a vision alone and without permission ( when The Night King touched him) as soon as Bran woke up he knew what had happened and that he ( The Night King) had touched him.  
And like i said Bran does not have this ability fully developed and in control, but he can kind of see the future too because:   
**1.** He gave the valyrian steel dagger to Arya, and she would later use it to kill The Night King and prevent his death.  
**2.** The only reason he came to King's Landing for Tyrion's trial was because he knew that he would become king, and he admits this with the phrase ""Why do you think i came all this way?"", when he's asked about ruling.  
**3.** When he became The Three Eyed Raven he saw Dany's dragon attacking King's Landing and Cersei blowing up The Great Sept of Baelor.  


Now in this theory, i don't think he can change the future that he saw, he can only follow it. Bran is just a puppet who can see the strings as well as The Weirwood Three Eyed Raven.  
i'm basing this off of the fact that Bran saw the attack to King's Landing and could do nothing, because he can't change the future, and that The Three Eyed Raven could not prevent Bran from having visions for himself and being touched by The Night King so he could train more and be ready.",4,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

I usually give them a chance, but they rarely stick. I want to know what happens NEXT not read the first chapters to a book I already know the ending of.

Breaking Bad....I tried Better Call Saul. It was ok, but never really hooked me. But the movie that shows what happened to Jesse Pinkman next? Totally geeked out.

I know GOT is going all ""prequel"" heavy. But hear me out. Let's say Maisie Williams's career never really takes off like she hopes posts GOT. Maybe a couple years down the road she is approached. She is the ONE character that had a departure storyline that took her so far from Westeros to something completely unknown, that they could legitimately spin off a new show, focused on her adventures, that would require very few of the original GOT actors or sets. There could be references. Guest appearances. But is there anyone who would not be able to buy into a multi year arc in which Arya is just generally off doing her own thing with her many faces without really checking in back with the family?

Anyway, just a thought (and I know its not likely because clearly prequels are just fine for most). But of all the possible storylines, thats the one I think could most readily work from a logistical standpoint.",9,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

5. She was pregnant the whole time and made a deal with Tyrion to save her baby before she died and make him the heir of Casterly Rock.

**Daenerys:**

1. Becomes Queen of the Seven Kingdoms after taking Kings Landing and defeating the Night King. She marries Jon and the both rule together. Alternatives: A) They are found to be immortal due to her being protected by the magic of the lord of light and him being resurrected, that means that they rule the continent forever. B) They have children that rule after them. C) Jon dies fighting the Night King and she rules alone.
2. Sacrifices herself to win the war against the Night King by allowing Jon to kill her, transforming his sword into Lightbringer.
3. Dies after her army gets defeated by the army of the dead.
4. Her Targaryen insanity gene gets triggered while shes taking Kings Landing and she proceeds to kill everyone, including innocents. Then she gets killed by Jon because hes the only one that can stop her.

**Jon:**

1. Becomes King of the Seven Kigdoms by right. He marries Daenerys and they both rule together. Alternatives are same as Daenerys'.
2. Gets killed by the Night King while fighting him 1v1. But gets resurrected once again, this time with magical powers that allow him to win the fight. After he beats the Night King he dies and cant be resurrected anymore.
3. Rejects the throne the same way Aemon did, he gives it to Daenerys and accepts to be sent again to the Night's Watch in order to anull his claim.
4. Kills Danerys after she loses her mind, and then gets sent to The Wall as punishment for the rest of his life.

**Tyrion:**

1. Helps Daenerys take the throne and continues being Hand of the Queen. His goal is the good of the realm.
2. Jon becomes King and doesn't choose him as Hand, but he stays in the small council.
3. Jon becomes King and chooses him as Hand by Dany's request.
4. He was holding back Daenerys the whole time since she came to westeros because he always cared more about the Lannister family than the realm, and wanted to give Cersei a chance to escape/surrender and leave unharmed with Jaime and continue Tywin's legacy. So he makes a deal with her to save her baby and make him the heir of Casterly Rock. Alternatives: A) He succeeds but ends up being sentenced to death for treason. B) They die, but the baby survives. C) He fails and so conspires against Daenerys for destroying his house, convincing Jon to kill her.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

The first 4 seasons are great, but the writing just went to shit for seasons 5 - 8. 

All the best characters got killed off early (Robert Baratheon, Tywin Lannister, Joffrey, Ned Stark, Robb Stark, Catelyn Stark, etc.)

The good characters who didn't get killed off got ruined with bad writing and became shells of themselves (Arya, Tyrion, Jaime, Littlefinger, Varys, etc.)

I'm sure other people arrived at this conclusion but I just want to share my point
This is my opinion, if yours is different I completely respect that.
Sorry for the grammar.

I rewatched the last season of this once amazing show to see if I could take the bitter taste it planted on me after the first time watching it. Booooooooy was I wrong. Every episode rose more question like the teleportation, everyone being immortal, Cersei just watching out of balconies, etc... , but I want to talk about the aftermath. More specifically, Bronn. In episode 4, Tyrion offers him HighGarden to let them live, I was kinda shocked but continued on, but in episode 6 he was also The Master of Coin. So he was Lord of Highgarden, Lord Paramount of the Reach and the Master of Coin. I was flabbergasted. 

Let's start by seeing what it means for him to be Lord of HighGarden. Its pretty simple, he controls most of the food so being the scumbag he is, he will throw an ultimatum at however tries to confront him. Also I just want to take a minute to explain why him being Lord of HighGarden is dumb. We need to go back to s6, the twilight of the Tyrells. (Just a side note they are my favourite house but I'm not going to make them look like the perfect characters because they weren't, still, grow strong :) ). The destruction of the Sept of Baelor really resumes how this show no longer had consequences. 

So cersei blows the Sept at the day of the trial, kills her political enemies blah, blah,blah we all know that part. But there is a key point most of us missed, in the end, there were no consequences. Sure, Lady Olenna joined forces with Daenerys but it ended up being useless since she died and Daenerys took Kings Landing with just one Dragon. I would think that destroying the biggest holy place to a every powerful cult, not only killing the it's  ""High Authority"" supported by the king (The High Sparrow and the 6 other ringleaders present), the true queen (Margeary) and her family, and hundreds of other people would go unnoticed by the population. 
Maybe they didn't know it was Cersei. Fair point but the people knew Wildfire had been used by the crown in Blackwater Bay so they knew the only people able to access it were either Cersei or Tommen. Back in the beginning, every action had consequences. Take for example Ned trusting Little Finger, Rob breaking his promise to the Freys, Tyrion killing Tywin, Lysa being a jealous b*tch to Sansa. But those action pale in comparison to what Cersei did. But let's just suggest the people were just scared of Cersei. I can still say that Bronn couldn't be Lord of HighGarden.

In season 7, Jaime goes to HighGarden, kills Olenna and sacks HighGarden to pay the Iron Bank. First of all, he wouldn't even come near HighGarden. As soon as he reached the Reach, Lady Olenna would have known. She would summon the vassal houses to defend HighGarden. The Tarlys betrayed them but she still had the Redwynes at her side (Olenna was born a Redwyne) and the Hightowers (Mace married a Hightower) and probably many other houses. Jaime didn't had much time until the deadline for the payment so he couldn't have turned all of the vassal houses turn against the Tyrells. But even when he took Highgarden, his army got destroyed in the following battle so no one was holding HighGarden and one of the vassal houses would surely take it and wouldn't just give it to Bronn.

Now about being Master of Coin. Bronn, the Master of Coin, really... the man who said he never lends money and has been a ruthless mercenary has been awarded the place of Finance minister. TYRION DID YOU JUST HAVE A MENTAL BREAKDOWN OR ARE YOU JUST DUMB. That's like appointing Hitler to the role of rabi in a sinagoge. Its idiotic and its going to cause a lot of mayhem.

There personalities and appearances are similar, Daario's character is a mystery, the timeline in the books is out of order a little anyways, the timing matches up somewhat, and also it would be one hell of a twist.

I enjoyed the ep, but there were a couple of fight sequences that didn't really make sense to me. I'm hoping that maybe someone who's been following the series more closely than me can explain them. Or maybe someone who's read the books can. 

1. The Clegane brothers. 

I know that as children, Gregor held Sandor's face against the fire, scarred him for life, and that Sandor has craved revenge ever since. I was unaware that The Mountain had any particular desire for revenge against The Hound, though. So it's a surprise to me, that after months (or maybe even years?) of being Cersei's mindless, obedient factotum, he suddenly abandons his Queen and decides to fight Sandor to the death. Just seems really sudden. I thought he'd been resurrected purely to serve Cersei, and he was now her creature. 

2. Euron vs Jaime. 

I didn't understand why Euron suddenly felt the need to fight Jaime to the death. I heard an analysis by someone YouTube, to the effect that Euron saw Jaime as the competition for his ""Queen"". That would almost make sense, except that Euron knows that Cersei's reign is now at an end, as exhibited when he says ""it's over"". 

When the fight is finished, Euron boasts ""I'm the one who killed Jaime Lannister!"" and that is taken by some as an explanation. But that doesn't really seem plausible either. After all, Jaime has only for one hand now, so it's not like he's a great challenge anymore.

I'm sure most of you are well aware that the mobile game ""Game Of Thrones: Beyond The Wall"" is due to start rolling out very soon, for when that time comes around I have created a community and Discord for people to ask questions, get help or just simply talk about the game. Feel free to join and give any feedback and it is very new at the moment, we'll be working on it hard in the coming weeks.
