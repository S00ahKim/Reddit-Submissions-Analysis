I would like to take this up as a self learning exercise, and if it works out, maybe present it to my managers for use. 

Some questions that I would like to answer:

* Will a particular domain name/hosting package be renewed
* Which customers should we target for up-selling
* Which customers are likely to renew products that they bought at a discount

I have a lot of customer and order data like :

* customer unique identifier and all the orders they have purchased and renewed, and what they paid for it.
* Whether the same individual owns several products

If anybody with experience in this domain or even in general can provide some inputs, or even point me in the direction of some interesting literature, that will be greats.

I am currently working on my Master's Thesis and I'm a bit of a csv novice.

I am in possession of a very large comma seperated csv file that contains a bunch of data i need for my analysis. The data is scraped from a website (kickstarter). However, the way the data is presented makes it hard to use for analysis.

The variables are as follows


Title | Goal | Amount pledged | Is Funded | Amount of updates | Title of update | Text of update | likes pr update | comments pr update
-----|----|--------------|---------|-----------------|---------------|--------------|---------------|------------------

However, in the culonm 'title of update', 'text of update', 'comments pr. update'  and 'likes pr update' the data is presented in a single cell e.g. ['20 likes','35 likes'] for a project with 2 updates.

I am looking for a way to present this better by seperating the observations into n-amount of rows, where n is the amount of updates, and the standard columns (title, goals and so on) are just empty.

I am dealing with around 50.000 projects so this need to be automated in some way. Can you help me?

They were building a database and so needed ontologies of words to build up the parser.  I would have to find this kind of data off the web, cut it into TSVs and upload it by hand. 

However after 9 months of this there was a change of management and project goals towards a very focused product using APIs. So after finding and documenting the APIs I'm being moved onto Java Unit testing and data analysis in the future once we have a product we can analysing the output.

The problem is I have no idea if I can actually do any of this, my java coding skills consist of  a Lynda course (http://www.lynda.com/Java-tutorials/Essential-Training/86005-2.html) and some online tutorials. And I have no experience of real data analyst I hear people talking about methodologies and I have no idea what they are talking about?

If this sounds pretty vague, it's because I have only a tenuous grasp on what all their product can do as well as a extremely rough understanding of best practices in the Data Science field.  Any input would be much appreciated!

I've had some interviews but my degree and experience are holding me back. I'm starting to think about options. 

I have a M.A. degree in Research Psychology (just graduated in May- 3.7GPA) and a B.S. degree in Psychology (3.95 GPA). I taught myself R, but have no other programming experience (although I am now learning SQL). I have about a year's worth of work experience doing research analytics in R. My initial plan was to try to get into a low level data analyst position and work my way up from there but so many of the jobs require a BS or MS in Statistics or ""relevant work experience"" PLUS programming languages that I simply don't have (python, hadoop, SQL, etc). 

SO this is leading me to think that more education would be helpful but I'm not sure what to do, my options:

- get serious and go back for a full 2 year M.S. in Statistics or Data Science (which program would be best?) 
- get somewhat serious and find an accelerated one year MS degree in Data Science (considering the Berkeley online program, has anyone done that?) 
- get a Data Science certification from Udacity or Coursera or another MOOC (which one would be best?)
- just keep plugging away on my own to master SQL and whatever other languages I can find, then put those on my resume and hope to land a job

At this point, I can't afford to go back to school without debt, but the debt I have from my MA is very little so consider money not a major issue at this point. ",3,5

I have been studying the data science jazz for about five months now, and am starting to have a handle on the basics, I just finished my first kaggle problem.


Im at a cross-roads deciding on whether or not to return to the UK, Im worried that staying in Korea for longer is going to hurt my chances of getting a DS job later.


Reasons to return:

* I could get a job with a company (even just as a data analyst) to get experience
* Learn more quickly and then get my foot in the door for a more meaty data science job.
* Family

Reasons to stay:

* I enjoy Korea
* Girlfriend
* Work is easy/enjoyable/decent money
* Teaching maths/physics to Korean students is great for boosting my communication skills for explaining difficult concepts, so there is some merit to the job for DS experience

I am trying to decide which pathway  web development/mobile app development or data science would be a better career path. My understanding is that the need for data scientists will continue to grow for at least the next 5 years, more than at the rate for programmers/web develops in general, and I think now is a good time to get into the field, building industry experience, and to rise up the ladder.

I think web development/computer science is a good field too, but I think too many people are going into it now and that with the increased competition it will be harder to be at the top especially at the age of 28+. It also seems that there is a noticeable amount of age discrimination in Silicon Valley (which is where I want to be) in programming, and I'm not too confident with my ability in ""systems engineering""/programming in low-level languages like C++ versus high-level languages like javascript or ruby which are intuitive/fun to use IMO.

In other words, I think it will be easier to be successful in data science and have more opportunities in life due to the greater shortage of people, and that the skill set needed for it is rarer/harder to find than that needed for a programmer especially if one is focusing more on the programming aspects of Data Science (i.e. a Big Data Engineer type) where people with skills like Hadoop/Spark seem to be harder to find. It also seems to be the case that it is easier to get into a big-name company like Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Tesla, etc. as a Data Scientist rather than as a web developer. I have an aptitude for technology, and math in general (but who else here doesnt), although I found hard-core statistics (from the upper level coursework I did in statistics) was challenging. My understanding, however, is that the statistics/statistical tests taught in college is practically useless in data science (i.e. ANOVA, student t-tests, chi squared tests, etc.)

I think the enterprise side of IT is going to be a better bet for income, job security, and benefits versus the small startups that seem to be mainly web/web-app-driven right now. I think also the odds of making it big at a startup are pretty slim (say 5/1001000 startups actually make it big), and I think the time to do that was a few years ago (I think its still possible, but I wouldnt count on it).

My short-medium term goals are to get into an ONLINE MS in CS through either Stanford or Georgia Tech (took GRE with a 165 Q and 161 V). Longterm I would like to work for a fortune 500 company, and get an MBA on the side and go into management perhaps. 

*Bio: A little about me  I graduated in 2009 with a double degree in molecular biology and math from a no name state school with good GPA (~3.7 GPA) and fortunately debt free.*

*I had no employment for about 2 years after college partially because I lived in a low employment area &amp; economy was at its worst around that time. I was able to get a short-lived job as a research assistant for about a year, but that ended when the company closed in my home town.*

*Since then I have done odd jobs working as a tutor, some work doing some basic web design work, waiting tables, and nothing that would put me on any firm career path. I currently live at home with my parents, and have lost contact with most/all of my friends due to feeling ashamed with myself, isolation, and getting seemingly nowhere in life.*

*About 2-3 years ago moved to the Bay Area for school, and made friends who were in IT and found that web development is a well paying field in the Bay and so I discovered/looked into boot camps like Hack Reactor or Zipfian Academy.* 

*Currently, I am in school taking some courses in CS for the foundation (discrete math + Harvard CS50X + Udacity Intro to CS course), and hope to apply for an MS in Computer Science either through Stanford (their online part time MS in CS program) or Georgia Tech (online).* 

*My original plan was to go to medical school, so I took the MCAT two years ago, but feel that I just want to make a good income now rather than wait 10+ years before making any return on the education, time, and training (cost = 8 years of schooling of medical school + the debt ($200,000+) + the lost time, + the interest, etc).*

**I found that at my age 28 that a career in data science/web development could be financially more lucrative (assuming a career average of say $130,000/year) than one in medicine** *where a doctors income/wealth (~$200,000/year) would surpass that of the DS/programmer around the age of 48, but thats assuming no good investments by the programmer/DS such as real estate.*

*I applied two times to medical school already, and got rejected each time even though I had an overall GPA of 3.7 and 32 MCAT, applied to a lot of schools (which costs like $3,000  $5,000 per application cycle). Nothing unusual about me  I am socially well adjusted, in shape/work out/eat well, personable, etc. Even if everything is fine with the candidate, the odds of getting into a medical school in the US is about 5  10%, and [it's a bit of a rigged game against Asians](http://postimg.org/image/bmjkdqwk3/).*

Overall, I feel that I would be better appreciated in IT where skills/knowledge/technical ability matter more than where you went or what you look like. ",6,0

I graduated from one of the top universities in my country (albeit a developing country), with degrees in applied economics and accounting, magna cum laude (upper second class honors), and now I work in the advisory division of a large accounting firm, running data analytics consulting projects for large corporates. Basically, we take client data and use it to answer their strategic questions. It can range from using neural nets for customer segmentation to optimizing branch location or land purchase decisions using geospatial statistics. Our key value proposition in these engagements is that we have the domain knowledge to effectively translate data into insight. We also do CRM, risk management, and valuation, which requires some data work. The practice is actually growing quite fast. 

I self-taught R and was able to apply it to projects effectively. I also have a strong knowledge of statistics from my applied econometrics courses. Im completing Courseras Data Science Specialization three courses at a time on Verified Certificate to be able to just prove programming skill on my part. A big reason for why I plan to take a masters program is basically for career advancement, for my hobbies (open data, data blogging, data science for social good), and to be able to approach clients as a true data scientist. Academic credentials, especially from foreign universities, matter a lot where I come from.

I'm a CS student and am currently writing my Bachelor's thesis. I've written an application that does certain actions, collects system data and stores them in a .csv file. 

This process is repeated a thousand times and the result is a huge .csv file with 1000 entries, each consisting of 9 data records. 

I would like to visualize these records now and use basic statistics to show deviations and average values. I need to draw some conclusions from it but don't have to make any predictions or feed some ML algorithm with the data.

How should I proceed from here? I'm proficient in Python and have heard about R. I've also heard about Anaconda for Python, IPython, NumPy, SciPy, Pandas etc. which all sound like they'd suit fine for my project.

What would you guys recommend and can you recommend some sources for learning? I've had a statistics course but have zero experience with data science / processing.

I'm analyzing crystal growth under cycling thermal conditions and I'm trying to figure out the best way to quantify color so it can be graphed, if that's at all possible. The samples are under coniscopically polarized light so they're always showing their maximum birefringence (retardation colors) which can be used as a proxy for orientation, which I'd like to test and see if there's any correlation between that and growth/survival rates. However, the colors given by image analysis programs like Imagej are in hex, which obviously I can't plot up. I was thinking I might be able to convert to wavelength but that won't take into account the order (washed-outness, I guess) of the color, and I'm not even sure how to do that conversion anyway. It might just be that color is not quantifiable for graphing. If any of you have any thoughts or ideas, please let me know!",6,5

I didn't get in for the Class of a 2016 which started a couple months ago, but they said ""your application was held, rather than outright denied, because we felt you showed promise as a potential applicant"".
In the meantime I picked up the basics of programming through Javascript and applied to a couple of web development bootcamps and was accepted into Hack Reactor which I think is one of the more legitimate bootcamps.

However NC State just emailed me saying they wanted to interview me in-person on August 5th for their Class of 2017, which starts summer 2016. This actually gives me a chance to interview for NC state before I fly to SF. I've already finished my H/R precourse work and also already paid tuition + booked the plane flight for SF, so I will still be attending H/R from August 17th to November. 

I don't have a strong background in stats, but I did get an A- in a 6 credit Stats/Regression class in sophomore year of college, and my mother works as a lead biostatistician so I feel I might have a chance with 3 weeks of brushing up on stats for my interview.

So if everything goes according to plan, I get notification of my acceptance into NC state while at H/R. I graduate H/R in November, find a first web development job in SF in 3 months, and now I have my dilemma:
Would it be worth it to go back to get the Data Science Masters after working a couple months in SF? Will the Masters open up more doors 5 years down the line to other CS jobs? versus just experience.
I think the MSA program does have a strong programming component to it, except I'll have to use a PC instead of a Mac and use R and SAS/Python/SQL. What kind of careers exist for people with both web development experience and data analysis exp?

Ill be entering my 3rd year in college, Im currently sudying to get a BS in Actuarial Science (Im not living in the US).

An important piece of info is that Ive already landed an internship in finance. Now, Im actually still debating on what career to pursue. My options are: data scientist, quant and even a more business like path.

I really like quantitative stuff and Im good at it, I feel like Data Science is a path that Im just it time to take, whereas money and heavy math work is what draws my attention to Quantitative Finance.  However, my actual skills are in the business oriented stuff, I know how to get to know people and Ive very decent social skils, which have given me the ability of being a good negociator.

So, here comes my ""problem"": Im considering to change my studies to a BS in Applied Math. Why? because I feel it will give me a more solid foundation in the quantitative preparation need for both, the career paths and graduate studies Im considering (which are either an MS in App Math, Statistics, Analytics, Physics or even an MBA).

But Im afraid that getting the BS in App Math and not in Act Sci will shorten my possibilities later (for instance, I think its not common for a mathematician to get an MBA) and here in my country Actuaries are on a higher regard than mathematicians (because all you need is the BS degree, theres no SOA exams in here).

Basically, what Im looking for is to take the least risky and ""future crippling"" decision. Another piece of info to consider is that I want to pursue a career abroad.

I am working on two Data projects: working on a closed Kaggle and plan on stopping once I reach the benchmark; I am reading data science with python by Wes Mckinney atm. 

I plan on scraping a website and building a project analyzing the data after this; and working on either a python book(Think Python) or a Statistics/Analtics book(Think Bayes/Elements of Statical learning). Simultaneously, I am writing a paper justifying my Kaggle(why I chose models that I chose, how I cleaned the data, how I evaluated my models etc)

Besides, I can write SQL queries(not too sophisticated, but I can write a query with sub queries and other trivial stuff. 

I'm unemployed and I have a degree in Chemistry. I can't afford a FT bootcamp, esp since I'll have to move to SF( I'm broke and in DC.) I am finishing up a part-time course, which, in retrospect seems like a mistake.

Should I focus my energy somewhere else instead of Data Science/Data Analysis? I think it's a great field, but I don't want to spend time on it if its not going to get me a job.

Problem is, my code is all really bad/ugly. 3 letter variable names, very little use of objects more complex than lists and numpy arrays (don't know pandas at all), infinitely nested ""if"" statements, idiosyncratic code that isn't easily modified and breaks a lot (wanna rebin results from a 600 line script? better rebuild the whole thing from the ground up!).

My code accomplishes what it's supposed to, but it's godawful and kludgey. How do I learn to write good code? I've tried MOOC CS classes, but I already know the basics of programming and logic and none of the ones I've tried seem to explain how to make good, readable, flexible, modifiable code.

Any advice? I guess what I'm looking for is some resource aimed at self-taught programmers who don't know how to design software.",11,8

I'm getting sort of fed up guys.  I live in Idaho.  I'm about to enter the final semester of my masters in CS.  I'm burning out on my thesis work.  I live with my parents, I'm working a minimum wage, part-time internship, and I bike to work.  I fluctuate between 12 hour days and depressive burnout.  My thesis is on topic modelling on social networks with an advertisement focus, and I went into this wanting to be a data scientist.  I go to a lower tier local university, where frankly most of the professors don't know shit about data science.  My advisor is pretty smart, but a horrible manager.  I could have gone somewhere better, but this place offered me a full ride and a stipend.  At the time it seemed like the best option.

I'm just so tired guys.  I'm tired of the grind.  Every week I read another article about someone with fewer qualifications than me making six figures as a data scientist at some startup.  I need help.  I need advice on taking the next step, and seeking out that kind of position.  I'll start tomorrow.  I'll start yesterday.  I'll laugh maniacally as I burn my thesis while taking a dump on my advisor's desk.  I just want to be compensated competitively and find a decent work-life balance.  I'm a friendly, hard worker, but I'm just so fed up.  I'm tired of the deferred life package.  I'm tired of having to live with my parents, I'm tired of being poor as dirt, and I'm tired of worrying about my research 24/7.  I'm tired of local ""entrepreneurs"" who barely understand data science and offer me unpaid internships.

I'm good at this stuff.  I got my undergrad in Math from a great school, and I eat statistics for breakfast.  I can make scipy sing. The Elements of Statistical Learning and Probabilistic Graphical Models are my bedtime reading.  How do I go find a job doing what I love, in a way that doesn't eat my soul?

I've kept an eye on job boards to see what kind of positions exist, and after several months I'm getting a bit worried. I see very few positions (maybe 1 job that primarily involves data science / analytics for every 10-50 programming jobs), and they're not exactly... encouraging. 

Job posted this morning: must have an M.Sc. in biostats or epidemiology, must have experience with health research and health data, plus experience/familiarity with about a dozen specific things. Description specifically mentions they're seeking an experienced data analyst. For having this education and experience, they're offering a 1 year contract for ~21 hours a week, and a grand total of 20-30k in compensation.

Next, a finance company is looking for 50 data scientists, looking for people with general programming skills, a degree in a quantitative discipline (just a B.Sc.) and a willingness to relocate overseas. Position mentions use of big data tech for this job (hadoop). Full time position, 26-29k annual salary. 

A previous listing I saw a while ago offered $15 an hour for data scientist with ""1-3 years experience in related position"". 

Most positions don't list what they're paying, but almost all of them require far more experience, do not mention willingness to train, and don't mention ""competitive salary"" anywhere, unlike a lot of software positions. 

It was my understanding that when there is a shortage of a certain kind of worker, companies raise wages, relax experience requirements, offer more training, benefits, etc. A few entries above the first posting I listed, was a posting for a ""junior software engineer"" with 0-3 years experience with an object oriented programming language, and a B.Sc. in a cs or math discipline. 115k-160k salary, lots of benefits, lots of training offered, they'll pay for relocation, etc. Despite spending the last 6 months learning everything I could about analytics and big data, I'm more qualified for the 115-160k software engineering job than I am the &lt;30k data science jobs. 

What's going on? Is the shortage strictly of highly educated and experienced scientists willing to work for 15 bucks an hour? If my interest in programming is comparable to my interest in data science, have I made a big mistake in career aspirations? ",48,11

I have an engineering undergrad with limited CS skills, and am debating the best way to get more into big data without spending a fortune on tuition.

General Assembly, for example, has a data science bootcamp which looks interesting, but if it's not sufficient, then I see no reason to spend the money on it:
