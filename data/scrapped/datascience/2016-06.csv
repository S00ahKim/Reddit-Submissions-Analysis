Many in our audience arent coming from a good place. Who could blame them?

We were ready. To back up our narrative we got everyone we needed in the room. I opened up the conference bridge. Over three hundred from across the country chimed in to listen to what we had to say. For six hours we presented the financial and strategic benefits for our new direction and what we must do to realize those benefits. With our due diligence, we walked through the evidence.

Growing up I always loved math and computers, and I always wanted to start a business of my own. I am now a sophomore at my college, and I am going to do a double major in business analytics (data science), and sports management. I got into business analytics, because I love math and computers. I also looked into to the job market, and it helped me love the major even more. I got into a sports management major, because I wanted to do it as a minor, but my college would only offer it as a major, so I am doing that. Let's say I don't care about money to much, but if I own a  business and my salary is $60,000 I will be happy.

Anyways lets get into the meat of the question. If I wanted to start a data science consulting business that focuses on sports teams, but can help many small business is that possible? For sports teams I am not talking about the four major leagues, but minor league teams such as the United States Hockey League. I would also rather focus on helping them increasing ticket sales, and personal decisions would be an extra thing I could charge, but not focus on.

I got off work, had a few brooskis and gain the courage to ask this question. Please do not kill me, but I would appreciate the constructive criticism. I hope you have a great week, and a great life. 

Edits: Grammar and spelling. I always had to double check my typing.

In the past year I came across this new world of Data Science and this subreddit. I'm currently finishing up my Bachelor's in Computer Science and I'm beginning to feel the push to ""do something with my life"" after graduating in a few months. I definitely don't see myself as a computer scientist my entire life and I really want to get into the data science field. 

I'm not too sure where to start. The way I see it, there are four options: 1. find a DS job 2. get a DS related master's 3. do DS related research at an institution 4. bootcamp. 
The more I look into it, the harder getting into options 1 and 2 seem since I don't have a solid data science or stats background. The only items I have to rely on are my computer science experience (SQL, python, C++, Java) and one engineering statistics course I'm currently taking. The only internship I have is also computer science related and not at a major tech company. Since I am also about to graduate, I feel as if finding a data science internship is also out of the window once I get my bachelor's. 

Reading this subreddit I noticed a lot of ""I know a guy who..."" or ""my cousin landed a job..."". I am not looking for examples of really bright individuals or one-time circumstances. Instead, I really would like your opinion as to how I, an average joe, can start my data science career. ",6,0,False,self,,,,,

I have tried to find sample DS resumes but no luck, most of those are pretty generic and not much helpful. I had tried to search in reddit as well but no luck. Thus, I'm posting this thread. I will be grateful if you awesome folk could give some guidance to this aspiring data science comrade. Links to sample resumes or the ones you have for personal reference, anything will be helpful.

I'm very new to the world of data science and trying to just understand the terms with basic Python code. A question I was puzzled by is how to mine data that is changing vs static. For example, if I was tracking shoppers on an Internet site, I could count for purchases over the day (total cost, total items, time of day). But the customers could add items or even cancel the purchases if needed. 

For the end user of my data, since they want to see the most accurate total of purchases and items, how would this be presented and indexed? Would you wait until it's past the cut off period where there can be no more changes to the cart/purchase? Or would you account for these changes by having a deviation of sales +/-% for accuracy?

I have an undergraduate degree in math (from a high-ranked small liberal arts college) and I've been working as a software engineer for the past five years. Mostly Python, but also some JavaScript and Scala, and I've worked with databases like Postgres, Cassandra, and DynamoDB. I used R in undergrad statistics, but it's been a while and I'm very rusty.

Some of my friends have gone into data science as a career, but they all either completed a PhD or dropped out of a PhD program with a Masters. Is it possible to be taken seriously for data science jobs with only an undergraduate degree? If so, can anyone offer suggestions for getting my foot in the door?

I'm well-respected, and people listen to what I say.

But I hate my job. The more I examine common practices at my company, the more I realize that everything is a lie. We sell models to clients, but they don't work, and they never have. Top-level management is excellent at selling promises to clients that we can't actually deliver. Given that we work in a specialized field that's currently experiencing a bubble, none of our clients seem to have noticed yet. But they will.

I am currently an undergraduate at university.

If I am to pursue a career in data science (ideally applying machine learning and other predictive algorithms to data) how much programming do I need to know?

-I have experience using Python, R, SQL and especially enjoy using Python (pandas, sklearn, etc...) for personal projects and kaggle.

-I also really enjoy math/stats and have a relatively strong undergraduate background in it with some graduate level courses taken in both departments

-I have basic exposure to Java and C++ in college courses. However, I disliked programming in these languages and especially using object oriented programming. I don't have experience using Java in industry, but reading about the extremely complex frameworks, large codebases, and legacy code seems very daunting. I don't really have software engineering skills, partly because I'm much more interested in math and statistical modeling. 

-Anyways, my question is, since I enjoy the data analysis, statistics, and mathematical theory much more than programming, is it feasible to have a career in data science focusing mostly on scripting languages like R, Python, Matlab, etc... without extensive use/expertise of compiled languages like Java/C++?

Unfortunately, I have been stuck today and it's been kind of discouraging. First I had to spend a few hours fixing problems with my library dependencies. Then I open up the data set and I get hit with hurdles left and right. I import the csv, but they're str variables instead of float or something I can work with numerically/graphically. Fine, let's convert them to floats. Wait, that doesn't work because some variables have some missing variables denoted by ""NA"". I mean I can ignore them but that's kind of shitty practice.

So I've been here, I wanted to learn more about random forests today and all I did today was fiddle with technicalities of python. And even at that, I haven't gotten anywhere.

I am struggling with a very weird data structure and very appreciate if someone can advise which statistical method would be appropriate.

My dataset currently has 3 levels of analysis: A, B, and C. B is nested in A. However A and C are crossed, B and C are also crossed (i.e., more than 1 member in A can be mapped to each member in C, and more than 1 member in C can be mapped to each member in A). I have been thinking of using Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) to handle this dataset. However, I am only familiar to use HLM for nested datasets.

Let's say I want to test the performance of my dimension reduction + classification pipeline. To do this, I will use k-fold cross validation. I know that performing dimension reduction on the complete dataset before creating the k folds is bad due to overfitting. To avoid this, the k folds for training and testing are created first. My question is the following: how should my dimension reduction + classification pipeline learn? How should I partition the data? I see two options:

* **(1)** take my training data, divide it in two (how many samples go to each is to be determined). Use one subset to learn the dimension reduction mapping. Then, pass the other set through the learned mapping and use the reduced features to learn the classifier. Now, none of the steps have overfitted.

* **(2)** Take my training data, apply my dimension reduction to it i.e use the same data for learning and reducing. Then, use the reduced data to learn the classifier.


I tend to prefer approach (1) given that no overfitting occurs. With method (2), I would run into issues when I want to use my dimension reduction + classifier pipeline on new data.

Is approach (1) the correct one? Is there another way to do this? I'm not making assumptions on whether the dimension reduction is supervised or not.",1,3,False,self,,,,,

I sure do. Its an expression that spoke well on how we teach and educate. But today this expression doesnt speak well at all. This expression needs an update:

Teach a man [how to teach himself] to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.

Training and education has changed. Rather than students being immersed in books and lectures, theyre now looking at how-to-do videos and blog posts building their foundational skills for free. Because we charge our students for their education, to stay in business we need to better compete with these free web resources. To do this we need to become pure learning organizations.

Currently I am facing a though choice of what I want to do with my computer science career. I am one year away from graduation, and was seeing data science as an interesting option. After taking an artificial intelligence class, I got really interested in using algorithms to solve complex problems, and became attracted to the idea of getting into machine learning and data science. A new data science class was offered in my university, so I enrolled immediately.

This wasn't a good choice. The class terribly put together, and taught us almost nothing for 4 months (only basic statistics, like mode and median, and simple web scrapping and data visualization). The course definitely was not a good way to know if I like the field, but the few interactions with statistics felt kind of boring to me. 

Now I am in an internship at a big company, and by the hand of destiny, I was placed inside a data science team. The team is composed of computer scientists, statisticians and mathematicians, almost all of them with PhDs. The work here is focused on finding patterns in the usage data of the different products of the company. At first, the idea seemed amazing to me: being surrounded by very intelligent people that can teach me a lot of new things. However, I have been feeling very on and off while working here. My project is very open ended, and I lack most of the statistics and machine learning background required to take an initiative to do something useful with the data (my university mostly teaches software engineering and development). I have been working based on my problem solving skills, intuition and understanding of the real world problem, but have barely programmed in the 4 weeks I've been here (only a couple of queries to filter the data).

My mentor is very happy with my work. Even though I don't know much, I have drawn conclusions on what I have been seeing in the data, and documented my use of the newly setup Spark cluster, for other employees to ramp up quicker on its use. What has been complicated for me is that most of the time I feel very unproductive and lost, just staring at my screen thinking of what could I do with the data. There is a lot of learning opportunities available to me, but I feel that my lack of background hinders my ability to understand some of the stuff I have learned here. And I definitely miss programming, and seeing the results of my code come to life. Maybe I have approached the field in the wrong way, but right know I am feeling this is not my cup of tea. I still feel very interested on machine learning and artificial intelligence, but these kind of open ended, statistic projects have been feeling unfulfilling to me.

What do you think? Do I need to approach this way of working in a different way? Are all data science projects open ended, or are there other ways of working with data and machine learning?

Our scientist (I'm the analyst) runs a Linux box. My boss runs a Windows box. 

I'm really getting frustrated with my Windows box because of big and little things. Big things, like it's frustrating to have SysAdmins go back and forth with me to try and get numpy or matplotlib setup or the ROracle package for R, and little things like the terminal on Windows won't let you resize its width and I can't highlight/select/copy/paste into the command line.

I've started running a Linux VM box within my machine, but it's a pain for a few reasons, one of which is that I can't get my VM box to spread across both of my monitors. 

There's still a handful of things I need to do every week or so that involve me getting into Excel, not Libre Office but some formula writing/data linking/managing in Excel. 

I mainly use R, Python and Oracle SQL at my desk, but it's just getting frustrating. 

Can anyone help me trouble shoot/setup an environment that can ""just work"" so i can get on with life?

It's an expansion of a previous role, so my predecessor didn't do much python/scripting work and didn't use a command line. 

I've poked around at MobaXterm, and it seems like i can do some things (unix commands, vim), i need admin rights from our sysadmins to install the plugin to see if i can run Python within it, but that might be sort of an answer.

I'm new to this community and I'm writing because I need to make some choices. And I really need some advice.
I apologise in advance for my English, I'm Italian.
I just finished a master in computer science that wasn't really specific for a field. The fields that I studied more where databases, languages, algorithms, logic, constraint and logic programming...
Now I realised that I'm curious about the AI and machine learning world (for me it is not always easy to know what I like) and I was thinking to find a job in the field. But that seems not possibile because I never studied the topic! 
So I looked for some other job and I found a nice paid job as a BI consultant for a very big company.
This would be a kind of risk free choice. But I will never learn some machine learning.
I also received a mail from a professor of mine that said to me that there's an open PhD position in my university for a project in collaboration with a company. So I would be paid by them, not by the university. And the project would be something like recognise anomalies in data received from various devices thanks to AI techniques. Here I would have the chance to make experience in the field.
Of course that would be less paid than the job, but not so much. Still it is 3 years long, I would have to wait for September for the exam and I would eventually start in October.
And I didn't even tried to enroll in any PhD outside of Italy, where maybe can be more convenient do a PhD.
So I guess you realised that I'm very confused in this moment, that's why if you can see better than me in this foggy situation any help is appreciated!

I wonder if I can just us any of these ""Anti-Skewness"" methods just blindly, in order to offset ""bad-data"" but not worrying about destroying the performance of my network.

My previous roles have incorporated elements of analytics/programming, etc, but now I want to leverage my skills to become a professional Data Scientist.

My education background was originally in business, but having graduated a few years ago I subsequently became very interested in further building on my knowledge of statistics in analysing and solving business problems and to this end taught myself various programming languages including SQL, Python, R, and others.

Subsequently, I have been doing some freelance gigs for clients using statistical analysis which I am adding to my resume and talking about in some interviews I have had.

However, my experience so far has got me thinking; what are the pros and cons of working for **oneself** versus for a **company** as a data scientist? At this stage in my career, my mindset is that even with a few projects under my belt, I should get into a reputable company for at least a few years and build experience. However, I also enjoy the variety of projects that one is allowed to work on when they are a freelancer and from my research, clients tend to pay quite significantly if you are good.

It would be great to get some more information on a data science career from both an employee vs. freelancer point of view. My two main questions are:

**1)** While this varies widely, are opportunities (both from a career and financial perspective) broader by working for a company or doing your own projects?

and 

**2)** is it known for a data scientist to be working on side projects in this manner even if employed full-time? (this is obviously highly specific to many factors such as company policy, etc, but I am just wondering in general if it is known for data scientists to also do independent projects in addition to their work commitments).",4,17,False,self,,,,,

I'm in the process of taking Andrew Ng's course in coursera but I need to find a good fit to my data and unfortunately don't have alot of time so I'm coming to here asking for help.

I have collected data from a sensor I created over a temperature range at the two extreme positions.  I am attempting to create an algorithm that compensates my measurement of position as a function of both position and temperature.

I have two seperate data sets of measured position vs temperature, each set at different positions.

I actually have six sensors and I collected two data sets each but I am confident once I figure out how to find my algorithm or equation for one sensor I can find the average for them all.

I'm fairly sure if and when I finish the coursera course I will know how to do it but I was hoping you guys could point me to a more direct way to learn to do what I need in less time.

For most of my professional career I've worked with data by using Excel and writing VBA macros. I've come to realize how simplistic that is and that I need to expand my skill set if I am to move on to something more advanced. So I've been teaching myself the things I need to know to do data science work with Python. 

I've got a data set and a project I've started working on. However, I could really use some sort of mentor to answer my questions every once in a while. I'm not looking for help writing code, but just someone who can provide feedback on more general issues. For example:

* Did I do enough to clean the data properly? If not, what else should I do?

* Are my charts/graphics appropriate? What other sort of charts would you like to see for this data set?

* Do you have any recommendations for additional statistical tests I could perform to analyze these variables?

* Is this a good machine learning algorithm for my analysis or is there something even more appropriate I should be trying? 

So if there is anyone out there willing to help I'd appreciate it. Or if you guys have any other recommendations for how I can get feedback and guidance on my project (like posting it here?) let me know. 

Edit: My project involves analyzing loan data at the company Lending Club. They offer personal loans to Americans for a variety of purposes. They also provide a significant amount of data on every loan they've issued. My ultimate goal is to implement some sort of machine learning algorithm to help me identify which loans are likely to default and should therefore be avoided. ",5,3,False,self,,,,,

I have been taking some of the free data science-relevant courses via Coursera for a while now. About 3 months ago, I quit a job that was running me ragged and was just generally very unfulfilling. I knew I was interested in data science as a potential career but my background wasn't a good fit to get me in to any entry level roles on its own. While applying to other jobs, I decided to also apply to the MIDS program (I had already taken my GMAT so it wasn't a big deal to apply in two weeks). 

Fast forward to today and I just started a new job (probably not the last job I'll ever have but one I am very interested in nonetheless - not in data science). As if on cue, I get a call on my first day of work saying that I was accepted into the MIDS program. Great news! But now I have to make a decision... Do I take the $60k plunge that is the MIDS program, more actively pursue the certificate options, or just take the free courses and see how my new job pans out?

Personally, what I think would be helpful for me would be examples of what people have done to get into the field of data science for whom it wasn't a logical jump educationally. Specifically, has anyone graduated from the Berkeley program (or similar) and with what results? Also, what have some results been of the Coursera class?

I have a few queries as someone who is looking to pivot into the data analysis career in the next 1 to 1.5 years. 
I would be really grateful if I could get some of your views on my approach to preparation for this career.
1.	Is it mandatory to have certifications for your skills? 
I am considering the Udacity nanodegree but am still willing to grind a bit harder to find a more budget friendly option (self-learning on free sites). I wanted to do the nanodegree because I do like some structure to my learning, however the cost is a bit prohibitive for me at the moment. 
Would it be better to invest in a program like this, or slowly create a portfolio on GitHub and use that as evidence of skills to help land a job?

2.	Do you feel the whole big data and data science discussion right now is over-hyped?
I do understand the value of big data  its just that Im curious whether people will be talking about it with the same reverence after a decade as they are now. Eg: 6 Sigma was all the rave some years ago and Ive hardly heard anyone even mention it these days.

3.	After building up a portfolio of corporate work, is it possible to actually make a living freelancing with these skills?

4.	For those with experience in the social sector  is data analytics taken seriously or is it treated as some corporate tool used to make more money?

5.	I am also interested in the financial implications of the stories that data analysis can tell. Would having a CFA help to complement a data analyst toolkit?


For context:
I am currently a business analyst in a retail organization in India. I transitioned to this position from a master data as a drive to slowly move towards either consulting or data analysis. 
I have started learning python recently and am currently self-prescribing a syllabus to build up a tool set of data analysis techniques both in mathematics and CS.
Instead of moving deep into Big Data or ML, Id much rather use data analytics to tell stories off which to tell business case stories, and  to base compelling arguments and marketing strategies. This is actually how I got interested in this field. In my previous organization, I started spending an hour or so trying to find patterns in filtered data in Excel and then use the stats to help win a few arguments on process selection and design.

* I compete on Kaggle. When I start a competition, I usually look for solutions to similar problems to help me get started.  E.g. if the objective is to minimize RMSLE (root mean squared log error) I like to look for code samples which also minimize RMSLE.  If the problem involves classifying an unbalanced target, I like to see how other people dealt with this. MLPB was designed to make it easy for me (and hopefully others) to search for problems and solutions with specific characteristics like this.

* A single problem should (ideally) contain a bunch of sample solutions, so you can compare scikit-learn's RandomForestClassifier to R's randomForest to XGBoost (in Python or R).

* Hopefully having a standardized format for sample problems and sample solutions should make it really easy to get up and running with a new model or language you want to learn.

I am coming from a mathematics, statistics, and software development background. Often time, I truly only understand an algorithm when I can both sketch a pseudocode or actual implementation of it. 

Right now my studies are bifurcated. My university professors have been excellent resources for helping me learn the theoretical parts of ML. My industry friends have been great helping me use packages and code to implement blackbox solutions. 

For instance, I have Machine Learning by Kevin Murphy. I also have Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Christopher Bishop. These are both the best resources for a theoretical underpinning of the methods I am learning. However, I am really not wanting to reinvent the wheel and was hoping there is a book or resource that discusses these methods from an implementation point of view in pseudocode or code?  

Simply put, I still feel like I am missing the holy grail (to me at least) which is being able to implement these concepts in pseudocode or real code from scratch. It would be great if a book is out there that does this, but if not can you recommend anything for me? I am willing to study a machine learning libraries source code, but would need suggestions on what the best documented code base solution is out there and where to get started. I prefer python and R, but I am amiable to C++ and Java if no python/R solutions are readily available.  I understand many of these methods are complicated, but that won't stop me. I just need the resources to start somewhere. :)

I really wish I had found this subreddit while I was in graduate school, nonetheless, no time like the present. Like many in this thread I am looking for advice: 

* I recently completed my doctorate in higher education and am trying sort out my next steps. I found this subreddit because I was hoping to find others who were interested in predictive/learning analytics who could give me some insight about the path they took to develop that skillset as well as for any who may be working in a sector that serves higher education (whether at an institution or as a separate company). 

* My passion is to use data to help students become more successful, and the concept of monitoring and observing student behavior (especially online) to determine if there are any significant actions that impact whether or not a student will succeed is very interesting to me, especially if we can direct those students to resources that may help them achieve their goals. 

* I have found a few individuals who teach courses via EDX/Coursera, but I have not really found any positions seeking this skillset in higher education. Most institutions will hire a 3rd party like Rapid Analytics, Advisory Board, or Civitas instead. 

* I am currently working as a Research Associate at a community college in Maryland, but despite their claims, they do not want me working on any predictive analytics at their institution at this time, so I am unsure what options I have outside of online courses to develop and test my skills as well as gain experiences to help build my portfolio for when such a position does arise (University of Maryland just recently hired a data scientist whose background was in sociology). 

* given my masters in statistics, evaluation and methodology, as well as various projects involving regressions, path analysis, and other higher level analysis, how long would it likely take me to become proficient in predictive analytics and/or data science?
