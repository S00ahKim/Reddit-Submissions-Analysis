I graduated from UIUC in 2017 with a 3.0 GPA from UIUC with a BA in Economics on a pre-med track and have taken quantitative economics courses (Numerical methods of economics in finance, monetary economics, economic stats I&amp;II, calc I&amp;II). I also have beginner level experience with Python programming. 

I attended a non-domestic medical school for a few months and really struggled; I attribute this to a lack of interest in the material and could not see myself working 80 hour weeks for the next 10 years without much payoff. I ended up withdrawing from the program and took Biology courses (interested in the research aspect) at a local state college and maintained a 4.0 GPA for my last 23 credit hours. 

During this time I became very interested in the molecular biology and genetics, specifically the development of new analytical tools for biological data.

I am seeking advice, recommendations, and really any input on how I can gain experience in the field to see if it is right for me. Thanks for reading!",3,1,False,self,,,,,

1. a write-up where I complete my analysis on the side then present back my findings with a few details/visualizations on how I got there

 or 

2. more of a stream of consciousness where I present all the analysis I've done even if it doesn't necessarily support the conclusions I eventually make.

To do this, we use AI to combine the programming expertise of many developers in a single platform:

Any developer can upload programs to make them available to others with a single click. For example, this simple program lets you convert between file types like Excel and CSV: [https://elody.com/scenario/plan/14](https://elody.com/scenario/plan/14)

The platform can chain programs together based on previous results. Does a column look like it contains names? Then run a program that detects and fixes typos. Does a column look like it contains geographical data? Then offer to visualize it on Google Maps.

Because any developer can contribute, and all programs can be linked together, Elody will get smarter over time. If enough Data Scientists contribute the end result will be much better than anything else that is available. As more people contribute, it will eventually cover even the rarest edge cases in data analysis.

We want to do for software what Wikipedia and Google did for knowledge: Connect it all, and make it available to everyone.

Have a look at this example: [https://elody.com/scenario/plan/5/](https://elody.com/scenario/plan/5/)

Its a stress test for our platform that combines file conversion programs, analysis programs, data cleansing, and visualization. You can upload an Excel or CSV file, and it will tell you all there is to know about it. Its also very easy to extend: If you have a more complex Data Science program, you can upload it and get Elody to offer it to the user whenever its appropriate.

We are just starting out and looking for Beta testers! We would appreciate any feedback!

Not only is this free for developers to use, but later on you will be able to charge money for the use of your programs, if you want.

Our latest assignment involves what boils down to a recommendation engine, think when a user signs up, they check off x amount of criteria, and we want to predict which products we should show them first to maximize the conversion rate.

I have a model trained pretty well with our last few years of data, but my question is this.  How do you guys usually store, or perform these predictions in production?  My two ideas are a basic recommendation table in SQL, with rows created when the user signs up, or running the prediction query at runtime when the user logs in or hits the site after x amount of time.

&amp;#x200B;

The first option sounds efficient, but not malleable, unless the table is dropped and recreated on a schedule or something.  The second sounds like a performance hit to me, although I've yet to do extensive testing.

Hello all,

Greetings.

I am PhD Physics with 10 years ( 4 yr post doc and 6 year tenure track) in national laboratory.

My  work did not involve much programming but developmental project for basic research, mostly  hardware. Did some scientific computing and Monte Carlo simulation. I am good at physics,math and stats, and did significant data analysis,  visualization, presentation etc. But mostly using in house programs for Physics Research. Also used excel with VB programming.

I registered  for a MS in Data Science course and finished Python Certification for  Data Science (60 hrs live class, case study and 3 projects). Still long  way to go, Tableue, R,Tensor flow, capstone project etc. My instructor said I am good,

Wondering if there is an entry  level position I can start with somewhere gain experience as I go on. I am  perfectly ok to start with an internship to get industry experience. Whatever DS position I tried, I am told to be over qualified for entry level and not suitable for other positions. They felt with 10+ years post doctoral research, I am best for research only.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

I assumed as I gained experience in these I would become more productive in Python than the GUI tools but this never happened and I just feel like contrary to popular sentiment the GUI tools like JMP are rarely less powerful or versatile than Python for EDA...  

&amp;#x200B;

For example I wanted to make a stacked barplot and found out this wasn't possible in Seaborn because the author ""doesn't really like stacked bar charts"" so refused to implement it! I had to use either Pandas df.plot which didn't work well with facetgrids or write multiple lines of custom MPL code for something so basic. It brought a 10 second task in JMP or Excel to 5 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

Another example is visually splitting and grouping data in plots. This is something I do constantly and is very easy in JMP, looking at some measurement split by a few categorical variables like week, product, treatment A, treatment B, batch, etc. Color-by works pretty well in Seaborn, facetgrid is okay but a bit clunky, but putting multiple categories on the x-axis like this ([https://i.stack.imgur.com/dGAcC.png](https://i.stack.imgur.com/dGAcC.png)) seems to be difficult or impossible in most common libraries even after hours of reading and fiddling with MPL.  

&amp;#x200B;

Another issue is lack of sane defaults. In 2019 I feel like I shouldn't have to manually set my axis labels to be 90 degrees whenever they overlap without even doing word wrap or anything ([https://i.imgur.com/tj8Cm.png](https://i.imgur.com/tj8Cm.png)). Another step that JMP does automatically, if labels don't fit they will wrap or rotate automatically like I'd expect from any decent software.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want this post to come off as a JMP ad... I think there are other similar EDA tools that do the same thing, the point is how clunky and non-versatile I find exploratory plotting &amp; wrangling in Python.

&amp;#x200B;

I \*want\* Python to be better because GUI tools make reproducibility very difficult, but when most of my work is one-off EDA jobs that's not a deal breaker. Has anyone else had a similar experience? What do you think is the future of plotting for EDA in Python?",7,1,False,self,,,,,

I'm looking to broaden my skillset and do an online data science and machine learning course. I have a chemical engineering degree and consider myself advanced at mathematics. I can use Python fine and a little R but wanting to learn more.

The Coursera program looks great, but so do the udacity and Udemy courses. 

I think it's best I just jump in and pick one but I'm a little overwhelmed for choice, and some user reviews indicate the courses can seem a little basic or beginner; I think I want to throw myself in the deep-end!

I'm willing to pay extra for a more intensive experience.

I'm sure this question gets asked non-stop around here, so I apologise. Is there a course selector forum I should know of? Is there wisdom in just picking a free course on Coursera and jumping straight in?

Kaggle seems like a super legit way to learn through doing, besides the Titanic one are there any other suggestions?

&amp;#x200B;

I have looked everywhere and I can't find a straight solution. I have a set of metadata from images and their elements (name, heigh, width, position{top, right}  
). I would like to create categories of images based on relative positions of several items in the image.

Example:

    img1 has   logo in top x1, right y1, and is height h1 and width w1  text in top x2, right y2, and is height h2 and width w2  from img1 to n 

I thought about running a KNN classifier to find images that are more similar to others but I am having trouble thinking about how to organize the data.

Should I group them by image? In which case: how would KNN or other algorithms work on grouped data? Should I do OHE to know if there is a specific element? Would it be better to use a DecisionTree?

Its my first data science job, and there is nobody with seniority here so I am having trouble organizing this dataset.

&amp;#x200B;

I really need some career advice.  


Background: I come from an electronic engineering and computer science background. First year of the computer science portion of the degree was terrible we started doing Java and I felt really lost during it, I should have put more time into it but didn't find it that interesting. I had a sort of hatred towards coding in Java even going into second year. What I have always been good at is learning theory, hence why I was good at the engineering maths modules etc. Then came my placement year, which is a year you take to go work in your field ideally and I got a placement at a startup company where I was worked really hard and I actually got a lot out of, one skill particularly was learning Python a little bit and I really enjoyed the work we were doing to make graphs out of data out of a serial comm. This experience led me to take Data Mining this year, which luckily wasn't highly code based and we used Weka. I really enjoyed the process of the coursework for this module (following the KDD process). I liked the conclusions we could find from the data and on another level what decision makers could do with the information provided. My project was wireless communication based and part of it was to use MATLAB to turn the data received into graphs, which included looking at the position of the data in its array and taking the numbers out of it. I rarely used MATLAB during my degree and needed a lot of help to implement the solution. I always feel like I know what the solution is for the code (I guess pseudo code), but never know how to implement it, maybe that's just because I need LOTS of practice. My work ethic has improved big time since my placement year and I'll be graduating with a 1st (GPA 4.0 equivalent).

  
Am I making a well informed decision by going into Data Science based on this information? Does it matter which university I can get into? The deadlines have closed for all the universities in the top 50 world rankings (Imperial, Oxford, Cambridge, UCL, King's) but I have a good shot at getting into a top 100 university (Bristol, Bath, Southampton, Surrey).  


What I thought I would be doing after finishing university for ages was a Master's in communications engineering and/or signal processing I still don't know if it's the right decision to go for that, I thought 5G would be a good thing to get into and probably still is, especially since I will effectively be delaying/stopping myself getting chartership in engineering, but I just want to explore my options. I have got an offer from Surrey to do Electronic Engineering from back when I thought it was a good idea...  


The other idea was to go for a job for one year and then to figure out what I wanted to do after that, since I'll have more time, but finding a job this late is very stressful and seems like a waste of a year as I'll be delaying the problem and not solving it.  


I think Data Science is what I think I will enjoy more and but I feel I am better at engineering, as I have been leaning towards that side of the course much more.

I hope to get some advice, or hear some experiences.

Ive come across a new business opportunity which fits my [Python, Pandas , SQL , ] experience.  Ive already started building the project, though I have not formed an official business yet.

A (non technical) PHD friend of mine brought the opportunity to my attention and he has already secured several interviews with interested universities (which will be our primary client), and he and I have agreed to split the company 50 / 50 , I will be the lead Data / Software PM, and he will take the lead on sales and marketing. (Im not sure if 50/50 is fair for me, but since it was his idea perhaps it is?)

I built an eCommerce business in the past with a friend of mine, as well as an established business owner. After about 2 years in the partnership, the three of us had some disputes, and they voted me out of the company. Even though I built the company my self, later bringing them on board, they are still living off the business today, and I receive nothing from it. This experience left me with mixed feelings.. on one hand I enjoyed working with a friend in building a business, on the other hand I cannot trust any one, as  when money is involved people do strange things.

Im decent with Algorithms, problem solving, and systems design, but Im terrible with legalese, paperwork, and general admin. Im also worried about the potential of losing another one of my creations, as a result of my weakness in areas of legal matters.

I dont currently have the resources to hire a lawyer to help me form the business, while protecting my self, or else I would..

What can I do?
How can I form this new business, while protecting my self, and my shares completely for the future? Should I form a Trust, which owns the shares of the Corporation, instead of personally owning the shares?

I wanted to get people's thoughts on what to do in the Analytics Career after you've been in it several years (mid-senior level) as I feel at somewhat of a plateau...

My Background:

Currently mid 30's in Southern California. I have about 7 years experience now working in Analytics at various tech companies. Currently I have a manager role. It's sort of a mid-senior level at my company. Pay is about $130k + bonus. Over the years, my SQL + Excel have gotten very good, I have a strong understanding of reporting infrastructures/BI tools,, have a decent handle of GA web data, and am very familiar with scenario analysis, generating forecasts, and A/B testing. I have an MBA from a decent school most people in Socal have heard of, but studied politics in undergrad, so my educational grounding has always been less technical.

My dilemma is this: I currently work at a more old school (though reputable) company, and am having trouble getting a position at more ""modern"" tech firms. My statistics background I'm starting to realize is not very solid. In the past few years I feel as though a strong grounding in statistics has become more of a requirement in the field. Additionally, I see more and more requirements looking for Python, which I am extremely beginner in. I'm hesitant about going into a strict data science role, and feel I'd do best on the more analytics/business side of it. 

We can assume there are little to zero learning opportunities at my current job (outside of learning on my own) as they've recently let go of huge swaths of the data science department, and many of the people in analytics have jumped ship. Upper management didn't see the value in them (very old school thinking). We can also assume there is no room to move up in my current company.

&amp;#x200B;

Q1. At this point in my career, would it be worth it to get some sort of statistics/analytics bootcamp credential? If so, any you recommend? It wouldn't help in my current role, but would help me sound like less of a dumbass in interviews I guess.

Q2. Have any of you taken lower titles for the opportunity to jump ship within the analytics field? I'm starting to look at ""Analyst"" roles, though am afraid my more extensive background scares off employers who are only looking for 2-3 years of experience. If so, what was the experience like? Also, what salaries are they offering for them in the marketplace? 

Q3. To those of you hitting your mid/late 30's, do you have fears of one day becoming obsolete? When starting my career, it seemed like SQL + Excel + BI Tools + GA could open a lot of doors. These days, that skillset is feeling more and more dated as the requirements seem to rise. TBH, this stuff never came easy to me and I had to spend an incredible amount of energy slowly picking it all up. Throwing another requirement (python/ stats/machine learning?) on top just feels so daunting. This field just feels geared towards younger people as I rarely run across anyone say, 45-50+ years old doing it. Granted, it is a new field so that may be expected?

Anyway, just wanted to see what people's opinions are as none of my close friends are in this field so it's very hard to ask for their opinions on it in a meaningful way. Apologies if Data Science isn't an appropriate place to pose this question.",17,14,False,self,,,,,

should i be using rfft instead of fft?

    data = pd.read_csv('car1.csv') 
    data = data.iloc[:,1] t= 1/5000 ??
    print(data) #FFT conversion   
    dataFft = np.fft.fft(data) FFT function  
    #trange = np.linspace(0, 5000, points) ?? 
    freqs = fft.fftfreq(len(dataFft)) Something about gathering bins? 
    np.fft.fftshift(dataFft) 
    #nu = fft.fftshift(freqs)   
    #Plot  plt.plot(dataFft) plt.show()

I'm currently an undergrad studying Computer Science and minoring in Statistics. I have a lot of interest in Data Science and really considering pursuing a career in Data Science in the future. Currently, I'm in a 300 level class called **Computational Data Science**. We use python with Jupyter, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, statsmodels, scikit-learn, spark. This course is more of a general overview of some topics on data science. We do some things on statistical testing, inferential stats, ML: classification, big data and spark.

I personally have a background that consists of a lot of programming/software engineering, linear algebra, calc I/I/III, discrete maths, numerical analysis, multivariate statistics, exploratory data analysis in R, and inferential stats. I have a stronger statistical background than most of the other students in the class because it is a computer science course. I will be taking some more stats courses that interest me in the next semesters (statistical learning, big data, mathematical stats, bayesian..). 

Moreover, this course I'm in right now requires some type of project (open ended, up to us) to be completed by the end of the term (early august). Because I'm new to the field I was wondering if I could get some project ideas or advice that will really combine the knowledge/tools I have and will be useful to show for potential co-ops/jobs. If it helps, I'm also really passionate about sports (NBA specifically), music, political issues...potential project ideas maybe?

I could think of looking for mention and doing ""sentiment"" analysis on the context they are found to try and get a general idea of the consensus about a given subject (I figure this would be better for punctual things, such as specific vitamins and supplements, etc). I also found a paper about using Machine Learning for literature review.

Long story short, I decided med school wasn't for me and withdrew and am now considering data science and software engineering. I have a BA in Econ from a top 10-15 public school in my state and graduated in 2017. I'm currently looking for entry level jobs so I can start paying back my loans. Should I try to take whatever job I can get or is it possible to learn relevant data science skills that can help me get a job quickly. I am strong with Excel and have some experience in Python, HTML, and CSS. I am also working on FCC projects. Would the Udemy Data Science/SQL bootcamp be good options? I also plan on doing the Tableu/R/Python/Stata/AWS courses at some point but only want to take courses that will help me right now. I am hoping that since my degree was fairly quantitative that I won't have as hard of a understanding concepts and ultimately entering the field. What is a realistic timeline that I can expect to enter the field? I don't want to take a job completely unrelated to the either field. 

I am average at math (157 GRE Quant without any prep) and enjoyed calc 1 (A) but found calc 2 difficult (B-). I got B's in both of my stats classes as well. Would this be detrimental for a career in either field? I enjoy analytics always try to read up on advanced baseball/basketball statistics, for example. I read that software engineers build the tools to obtain the data and data scientists derive meaning from this data, is this accurate? If so, I am interested in both aspects and feel that a software engineering career would be more versatile.

Hi, I'm a grad student who wish to be a data scientist and wanted to know how much knowledge in math I should have to be a good data scientist.

I do not have much math background, but I've always been interested in subjects such as Quantum physics, Astrophysics and pure mathematics. I enjoy reading books or learning concepts. 

I am self-studying Calculus right now, and over this summer (June-August), I'm wishing to finish Calculus 1,2,3. (I'm planning to study other fields such as probability and so on after finishing Calculus). At the moment, I don't have school or work, so I have 24 hours to invest all my time into learning. 

I'm taking Calculus 1 course (called ""Become a Calculus 1 Master"" by Krista King) on Udemy along with Khan Academy, but it seems too basic compared to college level. 

To be a good data scientist, do I need to have a very strong/deep knowledge in mathematics, especially in Calculus? I am trying to get a clear understanding in each concepts in Calculus and Khan Academy is helping a lot. But I know, the level of difficulty of Khan Academy is not even close to Calculus taught in Universities.

I do love studying in math, only if I had more time (I'm a grad student in late 20s), I would study Calculus more thoroughly but I don't have that much of time..

&amp;#x200B;

\- The contract itself

\- An e-mail of a co-worker notifying another that the latest version of the contract is done.

\- A purchase order about the items present in the contract

&amp;#x200B;

These are just some examples, there are several types of documents considered as contracts and several types of documents that are related to contracts but are not exactly contracts. I have a dataset with 3000 of them, but without entering too deep in this issue, I need to classify them between several classes, contract, email, purchase\_order, invoice, etc etc. The modelling worked pretty well, it came out of the validation with 94% F-score using sklearn's LinearSVC and TF-IDF vectorization. I did GridSearchCV using a stratified random sample, first, I split the 3000 samples in 80% for training and testing, and the remaining 20% for validation, did the GridSearch on the 80% for training and testing and then checked the best set of hyperparameters against the validation dataset. After finding the best set of parameters, I used all 3000 documents with said hyperparameters and deployed the model into production.

&amp;#x200B;

After some months I pulled classified documents from the production, checked that they aren't part of my existing dataset by any chance, and validated the predictions, which gave me 89% F-Score, which I think is ok for a model that is outdated by 6 months, it shows that it generalized well, a overfitted model would drop drastically I think.

Well, then I added this set of documents that I used to validate to the dataset of 3000 documents, which resulted in 3400 documents and I did the whole train/test/validation thing using StratifiedShuffleSplit and did all feature engineering with the \*entire dataset\*, got the best set of hyperparameters and deployed the model to production again.

&amp;#x200B;

Having that said, I would like to know what you guys think would be the best strategy, to keep adding samples into my dataset and doing StratifiedShuffleSplits as I'm doing ? Or to manually craft a validation dataset held out only for validation (and obviously not using its data to ship my model since I would need new data to validate it again).

&amp;#x200B;

If you think the second option is the best, I have a followup question:

&amp;#x200B;

Statistically, only 8% of the documents in the repository are contracts, so we have this ""natural imbalance"" going on. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you think it's better to have balanced classes (like 500 contracts and 500 emails and 500 purchase orders) or to have a validation dataset with the same imbalance that I see inside production ? (8% of it would be contracts, 25% of it purchase orders, 50% emails, for the sake of example)

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that balanced classes are important so that I don't have bias in my model, but isn't it also important for my validation dataset to be analogous to my production data ? Since I know that there won't be 500 contracts for every 1500 documents, why would I use balanced number of contracts ?",5,2,False,self,,,,,

I am building predictive ML models in Python.    
Currently, my approach is to connect to the SQL DB using PyMySQL (a library in Python) and write queries taking the needed columns from the tables and saving them to .csv files.    
Some of the tables contain upto 5 million rows and max data size comes upto 2 GB.

I then process the .csv files using Python to extract the needed features and make a .csv file containing the target variable and all the predictor variables, and then I build models on this data.

I want to streamline this process to some extent. Reading it from the DB using PyMySQL is currently a bit of a bottleneck. Exporting the data using MySQL workbench also turns out to be very slow, which is why I started using PyMySQL in the first place.

My question is, is my approach the best way to perform this task, or is there a better way to do it?

And, in this scenario where you need to make ML models in Python/R using data from SQL, how is it usually done in the industry?

I'm having a lot of irrational and negative thoughts on doing so because I got a humanities degree majoring in law and management back in uni 2 years ago, which is completely unrelated to Data Science. I only did uni Algebra and Stat as my math courses. Nothing advanced tho. I've decided to learn more about Data Science because of its real-world implications, and its potential in the coming years. I find it as a profession that is a lot closer to my overarching goal of earning a lot of money while critically thinking about solutions to make a direct and tangible change in the community.

Hearing about the experiences of those people having a similar background to mine would prove immensely helpful. I'm well aware of truth that ""everything can be learned through consistent effort and time,"" but personally learning from the experiences such people would add more depth and meaning to my journey.

Having said that, I think resume advice is relevant in general because a) you should *always* have an up to date resume (you never know when opportunity will strike), b) the best time to update your resume is when you are doing the work - not months/years later, and c) I've learned most people have pretty bad resumes.

On to the advice:

**Update your resume every 6 months** (at least) - whether you're looking for work or not: It's *really* tough to remember everything you've done (especially achievements, more on that later). Updating your resume every 6 months helps you keep track of everything and has the side benefit of helping you identify when you may be hitting periods of low production (if you're not achieving anything worth putting on your resume, maybe you need to switch things up).

**Use a tried and true resume format** \- and I'm not talking about aesthetics, I'm talking about content formatting. My personal favorite is [this one](https://files.manager-tools.com/files/private/documents/docs/Sample_Resume.pdf?from=drupal) from the [Manager-Tools podcast](https://www.manager-tools.com/2005/10/your-resume-stinks) . Part of the reason I give this resume format credence is that as a hiring manager who has to read resumes, it's my favorite resume to read. It's simple, easy to follow, easy to parse. The rest of my advice will be based on their format: 

1. Work experience first: 
   1. Title, company, and dates (start and end month, year) in the first line
   2. Responsibilities below that in paragraph form: responsibilities are essentially the definition of your role, i.e., what should someone in your role be expected to be responsible for.
   3. Achievements as a bulleted list: achievements are what you have done that captures how well you have done the job. 
2. Education at the bottom. 
3. If you have side projects that are relevant, put them between those two.

Skills do not need to be their own section. Ideally you should be able to include all your skills inline with the experience that you have - that is, the only relevant skills that you should be showing are the ones that you have actually used for something. If you haven't, then odds are that the person reviewing you will not really care for them. Harsh, but mostly true.

**Write good achievements** \- A good achievement has the following format:

1. Results: you start with a quantifiable measure of the impact of your achievement. The closer this is to ""I made someone money"" or some other universally agreed upon positive (""I saved X lives""), the better. Examples: ""Drove $10MM in additional profit..."", ""Decreased operational costs by $5MM ..."", etc
2. Action: what led to the results. This is a high-level overview in english form. Examples: ""... by improving customer retention ..."", ""... by reducing maintenance work frequency...""
3. Method: what you actually did - this is the data science part. ""... through the use of a classification model..."", ""... through the use of a forecasting/optimization method...""
4. Tools: ""... built using the CART algorithm in R."", ""... built using a combination of Python and CPLEX.""

""Drove $10MM in additional profit by improving customer retention through the use of a classification model built using the CART algorithm in R"".

""Decreased operational costs by $5MM by reducing maintencance work frequency through the use of a forecasting/optimization method built using a combination of Python and CPLEX"".

The reason for the format is that you want to start with the information that appeals to the broadest audience, down to the narrowest. That is, every person that reads your resume will be impressed if you generated $10MM in profit. Only fellow data scientists will care that you built it in R. 

**Don't sacrifice content for aesthetics** \- You can make your resume prettier than the sample provided, but don't do so at the expense of creating a bunch of dead/unusable space that may end up kicking content out of your page. Also, I highly advice against formats which split text into multiple columns or non-sequential sections - if they go through any type of applicant tracking system (ATS) it may distort the content. To that effect - the simpler the formatting, the more likely it is to survive any back-end transformations intact.

**One page resume with almost no exceptions** \- A lot of people will argue ""I can't fit all my experience on one page!"". The goal of your resume is not to document everything in your entire career. The goal of your resume is to serve as an advertisement for you. Just like car commercials do not reveal every bit of relevant information about a car in a 30 second ad, you don't need to reveal every bit of relevant information about yourself on a resume - you just need to provide enough info to where someone reading it can assess whether or not you *could* be a good fit for their job.

**Include all work history that will fit on one page** \- I've seen people argue that their job as cashier, or barista, or webmaster isn't relevant to the position they're trying to get. While maybe true, there are three reasons why you want to include all job experience:

1. So you don't have to explain job gaps. Hiring managers get really nervous about someone who hasn't worked in a while. The less job gaps you have the better.
2. Because even if not directly relevant, all job experience shows different ways in which you have been able to participate in a work environment, and those are all valuable experiences. It tells me that you have at the very least been able to work with other people in multiple capacities and environments, and that's by itself worthwhile.
3. If working while studying, it can help paint an even better picture of you. If you were going to school full time *and* you had a 20 hour a week job doing *anything*, as a hiring manager I think ""this person hustles"". I like that. It shows that you can put in effort, that you can bust your ass when needed. That is far from irrelevant.

**Do multiple passes to edit for style, grammar, and formatting** \- Make sure every entry in every section is formatted *exactly* the same - normal vs. bold vs italics, font size, dashes vs. colons, spaces, new lines, etc. You cannot be anal enough about this. In terms of grammar, make 100% sure you have no misspelled or misused words. Have someone else look at it if necessary. In terms of style, continue to question how you can make your entries easier to read, easier to understand, and as concise and to the point as possible.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

As a final note: *a resume does not get you a job, a resume gets you a phone screening*. If you are are not getting any bites on your job search, diagnose it by step:

* If you're not getting emails back, your resume needs work.
* If you're getting phone calls but no on-sites, your phone interview skills need work.
* If you're getting on-sties but no offers, your in-person interview skills need work.

Someone may say ""well, isn't it that maybe I don't have the right skills?"". Personally, if someone made it past the resume screen - and certainly if they made it past the phone screen - technical skills are not going to be what gets you disqualified. Or at least not a big enough problem that they alone will keep you from getting a job. Why? Because it's easy to get an 80%+ read on what someone's technical skills from reading a resume, and probably 90%+ from a 30 minute conversation with them. Normally what is harder to assess - and what you focus on during an on-site, is whether their broader profile (work ethic, cultural fit, career fit, etc.) works for the role or not.",8,43,False,self,,,,,

I do hope I'm wrong and someone else can offer a counterpoint.

Basically, for anyone in a non-PhD quantitative degree (CS, math, stats, OR, etc.), it's important to relinquish any expectation that you will be getting a bonafide entry-level Data Scientist position right out of school. The DS job market is not like the market for software eng/devs, where a lot of your CS peers will be getting offers left and right before graduation.

There are mainly two reasons for this:

1. In essence, the market for DS is much more top-heavy than the one for software devs - when Forbes or whatever talks about the huge need for DS, it's for *experienced* Data Scientists. Sadly this means that entry-level positions are limited and thus very competitive. Combined with the fact that you also have an influx of professionals wanting to get into DS from other disciplines, it makes things very messy.
2. The first reason flows out of this second reason. As you can guess from browsing this sub, DS remains a somewhat nebulous field that is inexactly defined from company to company. It encompasses BI, ML, data engineering, CS, stats, stochastic modeling, optimization, EDA, and everything in between. Most companies looking to hire entry-level software devs only need someone who can code, has good CS fundamentals, is familiar with the SDLC, and has some projects/internships to show for. There is no such well-defined path for entry-level Data Scientists, which makes it difficult for a student to decide how to invest his/her time and/or focus.

To be clear, this does not mean that it is impossible to secure an entry-level DS position right out of school - some people do. It just means that it is harder than other tech/engineering positions and should not be an expectation for aspiring Data Scientists. Otherwise, your job search will be frustrating and long.

This sub has bountiful advice for those getting into DS but I'll just rehash one of the more useful points, at least for students. Don't get into your head that you'll graduate with a six-figure offer right away. Patiently work your way into DS, whether that's starting as a Data Analyst or BI Analyst or whatever. Refine your skills on the side but don't make the mistake of thinking that doing a bunch of MOOCs, DataCamp courses, and Kaggle competitions will get you a job. They won't hurt but they will often be insufficient on their own.

I hope this helps any student looking to get into this field. I speak from my own experience and from talking with other Data Scientists.

# Multivariate Analysis

This course is concerned with the analysis of multivariate data, in which the response is a vector of random variables rather than a single random variable. A theme running through the course is that of dimension reduction. Key topics to be covered include:

* principal components analysis, whose purpose is to identify the main modes of variation in a multivariate dataset;
* modelling and inference for multivariate data, including multivariate regression data, based on the multivariate normal distribution;
* classification of observation vectors into sub-populations using a training sample; canonical correlation analysis, whose purpose is to identify dependencies between two or more sets of random variables.

Further topics to be covered include

* factor analysis,
* methods of clustering and
* multidimensional scaling.

**Learning Outcome:**

A student who completes this module successfully will be able to:

# Applied Statistical Modelling

This course extends the theoretical aspects of statistical inference (first met in MATH2011 or MATH4019) by developing the theory of the generalised linear model and its practical implementation. Initially, designing of experiments in order to explore relationship between factors and a response is viewed within the context of Linear models. The course   then extends the understanding and application of statistical methodology   established in previous courses to the analysis of discrete data and   survival, which frequently occur in diverse applications. In the course   students will be trained in the use of an appropriate high-level statistical package.

**Learning Outcome:**

A student who completes this course successfully should be able   to:

* L1 State and prove standard results relating to the theory and methods of generalized linear models, used in various applications such as medical and financial statistics;
* L2 Apply the theory and methods to situations involving normal errors, binary data, count data and survival data;
* L3 Derive point estimators and interval estimators, and construct hypothesis tests, in the context of generalized linear models and survival analysis;
* L4 Make effective use of statistical software in developing and implementing models for binary, count and survival data;
* L5 Explain and interpret statistical results in the context of the relevant application giving rise to the data.",6,2,False,self,,,,,

I'm about to wrap up my undergrad degree in MIS, and decided I would continue on and pursue a MS in Business Analytics for the next year. I know the degree isn't too popular in this sub, but I'm willing to put the work in to fill the cracks! The program starts in about two months, so I was hoping to use the little time I have before the program wisely. I was wondering if you guys had some recommendations on some online courses/books to work through in the little time I have. 

In terms of my relevant knowledge, I just finished an upper div course in stats theory as well as Calc 1-3, linear algebra and other various quant courses. In terms of CS, I got up to data structures, but never went further because the languages we used didn't click with me (Java and C). I have a solid base of SQL knowledge, and it wouldn't be hard to pick up again. I picked up ""R for Data Science"" by Hadley Wickham and treated it like a fourth class this quarter. I definitely struggled through it, but it has given me a great introduction to R and I've been playing around with Kaggle data the past few weeks. To cut to the chase, my goals are:

- Learn python. It seems my Masters program is more focused on using R, so I'll leave the rest of my learning to that (other than various personal projects)

- Further my stats knowledge. My original plan was to do an MS in stats, but I didn't want to commit to two painful years of purely math/stats without even taking stats theory first. 

In terms of what I've found, some coursera courses such as the IBM Data Science cert as well as the book ""An Introduction to Statistical Learning"" caught my eye, but I'm not sure I can commit to that with the little summer time I have.

Ive looked at some Data Science jobs, and the majority of them seem to be building predictive models to automate operations with less focus on interpreting what is happening or why.

I've been looking at graduate programs in Statistics since I'm trying to work my way up to be a data scientist and I really like the curriculum for my state school's program. However, it's not a regular ""statistics"" or ""applied statistics"" program, it's called ""Financial Statistics &amp; Risk Management"". Would doing a program like this limit my options more than a regular program?

Some things I like about the program:

- In-state tuition means it will only cost me about $22k (my company will probably pay for all of it at this cost) and I can attend in-person lectures

- I really like the curriculum. 

- I am currently working for one of the largest financial service companies in the world so this degree may be a plus if I keep in financial services?

My question is: if I decide to get out of financial services and want to work for a different type of company, would this degree be worse than a regular stats degree?

The course covers Data Science end-to-end. It starts with Python and the math background (basic probability, linear algebra, etc). Then moves on to Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and data cleaning, data analysis, etc. Finally, there's the really fun stuff like machine learning and natural language processing.

Some key features:

1. 10+ portfolio projects and 300+ exercises give you a lot of practice and fluency.
2. Thoughtful course outline and topic curation for Data Science. For example, when we teach you Linear Algebra, we don't cover everything a dedicated Linear Algebra course would include. We pay attention to the parts that are genuinely useful for Data Science.
3. Most of the tutorials are available in three different formats  video, long article and (relatively) small cards  so you can learn the way that works best for you.
4. You can play with the instructor's code right in the video! That is, anytime code appears in the video, you can click on it, and edit / tinker with the code and run it. (Obviously, code execution also works if you're reading the tutorial in the article format or card format.)
5. All the things mentioned above works on mobile too. Seriously, for those of you who like learning on mobile, it is the most powerful mobile learning experience you've ever seen.
6. We teach you the real thing, no dumbing things down or only talking about the easiest use case. Another example is that the course includes directions for how to set-up things on your own computer, even though we support online code execution.
7. Exceptional content quality: We collect ratings on every tutorial and project. Anything with average rating below 4.5 is sent back for revision.
8. The price point is significantly cheaper than other offerings like DataCamp and DataQuest. In addition, you can use my referral code ""keshavea59e"" to get another 20% off.

Long story short, I've got to the final interview phase of an awesome position as a data scientist, but I've yet to hold a full-time position in the tech industry so I'm inexperienced when it comes to the interview process. After some quick google searches, it seems that ""technical interviews"" usually consist of in-person coding challenges, usually at a whiteboard or otherwise not on a personal computer. I'd be okay with that but my interviewer specifically said the word ""talk"" which gave me the impression of a presentation or something along those lines; not necessarily a coding challenge. But that's all the information I received, no topic, no explanation, and since the job requires a security clearance I don't even know a lot about the specifics of what kind of data I'll be working with yet.

That's my concern, I was hoping somebody here might have gone through something similar in their interview process and would be willing to share some insights. Aside from that, I'm torn between reaching out for clarification (he may already be planning on providing more details, he said it'd be a few weeks before they were ready to schedule) or just overpreparing like crazy.

I work in finance for a large secondary ticket marketplace ( you've probably heard of them).

We're trying to build a funnel model sales forecast:

1) Visits

2) Conversion %

3) Orders (the above two multiplied together)

4) Average Order Value

5) Sales (the above two multiplied together)

It's simple enough conceptually, but we're trying to build a funnel with the 5 funnel metrics above by Experience (desktop/mobile/app), 6 marketing channels (Direct/SEM/SEO/etc.) and 9 product lines (NBA,NHL/etc.)...So overall you have 162 different sales funnels and 5,832 independent variables (12 months, 3 metrics to forecast).

According to this often-quoted research paper from Oxford University ([https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/.../The\_Future\_of\_Employment.pdf](https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf)), it seems that accountants/auditors has a whopping 94% chances of getting automated.

Now obviously I don't want to find myself getting sacked because of automation when I am in my 30s or 40s which is considered to be at prime age of career. It would be very hard for me to learn a new trade/skills by then to change my career track.

Is this automation threat, as described in the research, is true as accountants/auditors jobs are concerned? Am I going to lose my job in the near future? 

&amp;#x200B;

I am also worried of the automation threat, considering the growth of cryptos/blockchain technology. Correct me if I am wrong, but blockchain technology are, according to my understanding, designed to be automation-friendly and does not requires audit due to its transparent and irreversible nature, and tampering with the transactions data are virtually impossible.

2017 Variance: .4
2018 Variance: .43
2019 Variance: .54

So I am thinking that maybe there were some tracking errors in 2019.

For each stadium, I looked at hitters who hit there. For each hitter who hitat a stadium, I found the difference of their variance at that one stadium, minus their variance at all other stadiums. Then, I took the mean of all these differences.

For example, I looked at everybody who hit at Yankee stadium. For each hitter, I calculated the difference between their Yankee stadium variance and variance anywhere other than Yankee stadium. And then I took the average of all these differences for Yankee stadium.

After doing this avg for each stadium, I looked at stadium with biggest average differences. 

There was one stadium, Stadium A, that had a difference of .15, whereas all other stadium had differences of less than .1. Stadium A's var in 2019 also increased .4 from it's variance in 2018. So I was thinking that Stadium A would explain the overall high increase in variance from 2019 to 2018.

The problem is, removing Stadium A from the 2019 dataset BARELY impacted the 2019 var (less than 0.01). So that goes to show that this big year to year change in variance can't be attributed to Stadium A.

There are other outlier-looking stadiums that had a big change in variance year to year from 2018 to 2019. But in the first analysis I did where I compared avg diff of var at one stadium compared to all other stadiums, these batters at these outlier stadiums had VERY LOW VARIANCES WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER STADIUMS. And even if I did remove these outlier stadiums from the dataset, MY OVERALL VARIANCE BARELY CHANGED FOR 2019 AND WAS STILL GREATER THAN .5.

So yeah, I'm really f*cking confused as to why there was that .1 increase from 2018 to 2019. I am thinking maybe my methodology of comparing stadiums vs all other stadiums is wrong bc I use an average... and I also remove null values and stuff like that and some stadiums have more nulls than others.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, I am an in-progress data scientist getting my PhD in biostatistics and epidemiology (looking to swiftly exit the academic field). I have received many personal recommendations with both my skill sets and interests in becoming a data engineer once I graduate. I'd like to use my PhD off-time, summers, and dissertation to up-skill towards this end as much as possible. I also had a close family friend and career advisor suggest I ***obtain a cloud Data Engineering cert*** for several reasons: 

&amp;#x200B;

1) It would allow me to train field specific skills in a shorter amount of time.

2) It would give me a credential to start working on projects with local businesses etc. to boost my portfolio. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** Considering a cloud data engineering certificate. Should I do it? Which one? What is the best way to prepare (ideally given a whole lot of free time this summer).

I know that Master's in Data Science subject here get's a liiitle touchy on this sub, so do not want an argument. I would like peoples opinion for someone who really just wants to get good at this domain, ideally become a data scientist then help business really leverage and manage data scientists well. This is why I chose MSDS over Computer Science or Statistics Masters - is that so absurd... to just go to a university that created their entire masters curriculum on the applied use of data science in the professional world alongside academia opinion on what theoretical aspects should be understood rather than choosing a computer science masters or statistics masters and being like I am such a STEM wiz I can just step in and the best data scientist.... . I chose it in EU because cost and wanderlust.

2. If I do this, what is the best way to leverage my assets ( I know this is not personal finance, but maybe if someone who went to a masters program could provide input)

Checking/Savings/Cash ( high yield checking account at 2% annual) : 15.5k

Debt: 0

I am considering a Masters in Data Science in EU:

Duration: 2 years, ( 9 months out of each year) - Starts in 3 months

Tuition: 6k year 1, 6k year 2 = 12k total in Tutition

Monthly Living Cost: 1k (includes rent, groceries, student life stuff - this is a target)

\- including flights and realities of the world, 50k cost over two years....?

Income During School: $0

Financial Aid: NONE FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS

Ideal Salary out of MSDS: 110-160k , up to 3 years after (this is a goal, I reaaaaly hope I would get 100k at least, if not a very compelling growth opportunity or passion opportunity)

I would like to enter this profession with a degree, due to the culture of people in STEM not being welcome to people not coming from a STEM backgroung ( I went to undergrad at a Top 5 American public school,, but got my B.A. not B.S.)

Having trouble learning stats. mastering software development... after working 50hrs a week at a draining corporate job, so the thought MSDS would allow me to really learn and get respect in my career from age 30-retirement.

I'm currently struggling with a project, where I'm trying to forecast one time series with another time series, with a lot of seasonality going on. Any hint towards the right direction is appreciated! 


Setup:

I have the data for a company's hourly storage level of a certain commodity, as well as their market actions in quantities, i.e. if their storage gets too full, how much they need to sell; if too low, how much they need to buy.

Whe plotting the data, there appear to be a few seasonal elements: hourly within a day (e.g. low activity during the night, high at the beginning of the workday), daily within a workweek, and quarterly, i.e. actual seasons. 

However, since the buy/sell actions only happen occasionally, for most hours where I have storage data, the market actions are N/A.

Furthermore, there might exist a second independent time series, that might be able to contribute some explanatory value; however, I'd have to obtain this data first. Since I cannot disclose the industry, let's assume this to be temperature. 


Questions:

1) Does it make sense to encode buy quantities as positive, sell quantities as negative and N/A (majority of the data points) as 0? Won't the latter completely skew my forecast towards 0? Or will it depend on the forecasting method?

2) What forecasting method available in R and/or Python could I use in order to predict when and how much the company needs to buy/sell, esp. considering the suspected levels of seasonality?

2.5) At the moment, I'm trying to get things to work with arimax in R (technically a ARIMAX(0,0,0) with xreg = storage), but how would I implement the seasonality? Also, the market actions at (t-n) only influence the market action at (t) via their effect on the storage level. Would a VARIMA be more applicable in this case? Or maybe a dynamic logistic regression model with seasonality as dummy terms?

I'm currently doing a project that will require me to cluster several thousand data points into groups and I am curios as to which algorithm might be best suited for my case.

Specifically the algorithm should be able to handle at least 5 dimensional data and each point within the data should be assigned to the nearest cluster if and only if there is a sufficient amount of other points within the cluster.

I cannot make assumptions about the amount of clusters in my data, in fact the amount of clusters will only increase as new batches of data become available for clustering. Thus, it would be great if the algorithm had a simple way of updating my model over time.

Finally - and from what I can tell - my clusters should be of near spherical shape.

**June-16-2019: UPDATE**: I completed two new CV courses:

1. Coursera Andrew Ng course on Convolutional Neural Networks
2. New Udemy course, this time using PyTorch - [PyTorch for Deep Learning and Computer Vision](https://www.udemy.com/pytorch-for-deep-learning-and-computer-vision/)

&amp;#x200B;

**Some NEWS,** there's going to be an officia[l OpenCV Tutorial](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/satyamallick/ai-courses-by-opencvorg) coming out soon. Should be one of the best when it's out!

**May UPDATE**: Just wanted to post an update to my initial reviews :) as it's now **6 courses were reviewed.**

&amp;#x200B;

I made this post on a couple of other subreddit's a week ago, but thought I'd share it here too.

I'm working at a startup whereas the 'Chief' Data Scientist (re: the only person), I was tasked with learning computer vision for a new application we're developing.

My background is in Mathematics, I've used R extensively. I know some Python for a course I completed in College, but I'm not pro. Previously, most of my work involved performing Data Analytics, with some simple modeling.

The company paid for all courses mentioned below and I took roughly 3 months to complete almost all of them (still had most of my full-time tasks to do, so I wasn't dedicated 100% to learning Computer Vision).

[PyTorch for Deep Learning and Computer Vision](https://www.udemy.com/pytorch-for-deep-learning-and-computer-vision/) by  [Rayan Slim](https://www.udemy.com/pytorch-for-deep-learning-and-computer-vision/#instructor-1), [Jad Slim](https://www.udemy.com/pytorch-for-deep-learning-and-computer-vision/#instructor-2), [Amer Sharaf](https://www.udemy.com/pytorch-for-deep-learning-and-computer-vision/#instructor-3), [Sarmad Tanveer](https://www.udemy.com/pytorch-for-deep-learning-and-computer-vision/#instructor-4)

**Review** \- This is a very good course. Basic, but well taught and focused well on PyTorch. What I didn't like is that it lacks more advanced content. As such it feels a bit shallow when compared to the other courses. Not bad for beginners though, especially if you're looking to learn PyTorch.

**Pros**:

\- Very well taught

\- Basics covered well, lots of time spent on Neural Nets and CNNs

\- Transfer Learning is well taught

\- Teaches PyTorch very well

**Cons**:

\- Only covers the basics and doesn't go into more advanced territory

\- Lacks cool projects

**Score - 4.2/5**

&amp;#x200B;

[Computer Vision - Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/convolutional-neural-networks/computer-vision-Ob1nR) \- by Andrew Ng

**Review** \- Excellent Course! I didn't know why I didn't do this sooner! Complex concepts are broken down so well by Andrew Ng. However, it sort of jumps into complex code a bit quick. Lots of courses tend to do this. It feels like a typical college course where you're taught the theory but not the execution.

**Pros**:

\- Very well taught! Perhaps the best explanations of any course here.

\- Covers the key concepts of CNNs, Object Detection very well!

\- Covers mostly all the key CV topics

**Cons**:

\- Not a big picture or big project type course, the code you do is more about understanding the principles rather than doing something impressive.

\- It's not a course that will teach u to do things, rather it's focused on understanding what you're doing.

\- Can be expensive since it's $49/mo but if you finish it within that month or even the 7/day trial it's an excellent value.

**Score - 4.5/5**

**Review** \- **UPDATE**: I initially gave this course a relatively poor review, but I realized I had mistakenly confused some of the content with another [course](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-computer-vision/). This course was very good. The problem I had is that it's not good for actually learning Computer Vision core basics. You'll be able to do a few fun projects after, but it doesn't teach you principles and how to do a lot of this on your own custom projects. Overall though, it's well presented and taught well.

**Pros**:

\- Good variety of core content

\- His code works (always a plus since libraries and packages get updated frequently)

\- Fun projects

**Cons**:

\- Little core basics as it's more of a cookbook type course. Other courses are like this, but many teach the basis before moving onto a project.

\- Some fluff and overly long videos. A bit inconsistent in what's taught well and what's skimmed.

[Python for Computer Vision with OpenCV and Deep Learning](https://www.udemy.com/python-for-computer-vision-with-opencv-and-deep-learning/) \-  Created by [Jose Portilla](https://www.udemy.com/python-for-computer-vision-with-opencv-and-deep-learning/#instructor-1)

I enjoyed this course quite a bit. It's not a Deep Learning course though, at most he has a basic intro to using Keras, and how to implement CIFAR10 and MNIST, but those things are everywhere. The OpenCV and CV Basics are taught very well! And I like his voice and positivity. He's a good teacher and does it well.

**Pros:**

\- Covers the basics of OpenCV well

\- All code works

\- Has a Deep Learning section for added value

\- The instructor is upbeat and easy to follow

**Cons:**

\- The Deep Learning stuff is basic and pretty much fluff to boost the 'value' of this course. It's very basic and can be found elsewhere for free

\- It doesn't have that many cool projects to do

**Score 4.3/5**

[Deep Learning Computer Vision CNN, OpenCV, YOLO, SSD &amp; GANs](https://www.udemy.com/master-deep-learning-computer-visiontm-cnn-ssd-yolo-gans/?couponCode=REDDIT) \-  Created by [Rajeev Ratan](https://www.udemy.com/master-computer-vision-with-opencv-in-python/#instructor-1)

I loved this course! It was my go-to reference in doing so many things. The content in this course is insane and he provides a full Virtual Machine with everything pre-installed (useful as all code works perfectly!). The explanations are very good. He doesn't always go into detail, but when he does it's taught quite well. The only issue I have is that I can see beginners sometimes being turned off since he rarely explains the code. He's more like ""here's the code that does this, this line this and this function was built to do this"". If you're a beginner it's understandable you'd be confused. However, the code, content, and number of projects were far more than the other courses, probably even put together (except for the PyImage course, but we'll get there). So to me, it's worth it. It covers all the details of Computer Vision rather than just pieces that look cool.

**UPDATE**: Shortly after I posted the review I noticed Rajeev added some new content regarding using PaperSpace and deploying your CV model on AWS as an API (quite cool!)

**Pros:**

\- Amazing and detailed content

\- Excellent theoretical explanations

\- Shows you how to get the best performance out of a CNN and built a variety of things

\- Very fun projects!

\- An enthusiastic teacher who you can tell has a passion for CV

\- New content always being added it seems!

**Cons:**

\- Not for absolute beginners, now none of these courses are, but this one goes from easy to relatively hard quickly.

\- Instructor at times talks too fast and skims explanations of code

\- Some of the content is text not video, so I didn't increase the score, but noted it regardless. Not really a con to be perfectly fair.

**Score 4.6/5**

[Computer Vision Intro OpenCV4 in Python with Deep Learning](https://www.udemy.com/master-computer-vision-with-opencv-in-python/?couponCode=REDDIT) \-  Created by [Rajeev Ratan](https://www.udemy.com/master-computer-vision-with-opencv-in-python/#instructor-1)

This is the older course of instructor above and it shows, it's been updated quite a bit, but some of the videos aren't the same as the code he provides. That isn't a deal breaker and he does mention it, but it sometimes does make you wonder if was a mistake or intentional. That said, all code is compatible with OpenCV4 which is awesome. Also the number of projects makes it quite a nice course to get some good practical OpenCV knowledge. A Virtual Machine is also provided (nice touch!). This course has some excellent OpenCV tutorials, fun projects and there is some added Deep Learning stuff so it's quite cool, not as much fluff and good explanations again.

**UPDATE**: Shortly after I posted the review I noticed Rajeev added some new content such as using Caffee models in OpenCV to colorize black and white images and some other object detection stuff, really cool projects but not explained in too much depth, still cool regardless!

**Pros:**

\- Easy to follow and I feel more of the OpenCV basics were thought

\- All code works and explanations are on point!

\- Bonus Deep Learning stuff

\- Fun Projects

\- Enthusiast Lecturer

**Cons:**

\- Audio bad at some times (not much, maybe like 20 mins appears to have been recorded with his laptop mic vs external mic)

\- The code in the videos is not always the same as the downloadable code he provides

**Score - 4.3/5**

[Deep Learning: Advanced Computer Vision (Udemy)](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-computer-vision/)  \- Created by  [Lazy Programmer Inc.](https://www.udemy.com/user/lazy-programmer/)

**UPDATE**: I went back to this course and realized i might have unfairly slammed it. If you want exactly what's offered (look at the syllabus, it's taugh really well). But as a standalone CV course, it's lacking.

I enjoyed this course, it doesn't cover very much but it does some of the basics fairly well. What I liked was that it moved relatively slow and spent a while on some details. BUT, to be, he didn't address how to this in any practical way. It's not a bad approach, but to me, it seems better suited for a university student trying to understand core concepts rather than someone who wants to build something new or from scratch.

**Pros:**

\- Covers a few topics, but covers them well

\- If you like code-along courses this is for you, I used to like that style but I don't have the patience for it now. Too slow and tedious for me.

\- Explains Neural Style Transfers and VGG well

**Cons:**

\- Outside of VGG Transfer Learning and ResNet, most of the stuff is very shallow. I don't feel like I've learned anything I couldn't read in a blog somewhere (can be said about most courses but this one seemed very much lacking in detail).

\- Code along courses are good, but tend to waste a lot of time. I'm not a total noob. I don't need to be reminded to ""import numpy as np"" continuously.

\- Lacks interesting projects

**Score - 3.9/5**

[Deep Learning for Computer Vision with Python - Practitioner Bundle](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/deep-learning-computer-vision-python-book/) \- Created by [Adrian Rosebrock](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/author/adrian/)

(**NOTE** Adrian provided a 10% Coupon:  **reddit**)

This is the mother load. Absolute perfect and monster of a course! Now it's expensive compared to the others, but this course teaches almost everything you'll need. I wish the ImageNet Bundle was included at this price, but that module is over $600. This course covers all key areas of Deep Learning in Computer Vision. It does not have any OpenCV (well some, but PIL or imultils are used more often). The videos aren't detailed, you're paying for the detailed textbooks, the videos are pretty much overviews of each chapter. So, yes the course material and code is where the value is, and it's excellent in quality!

The code isn't always super easy to follow, but he explains almost every line in the book so it's not a complaint, just stating that this isn't a course that's going to be easily accessible to begineers. Also, like some of the others above, it comes with a Virtual Machine with all packages pre-installed.

**UPDATE**: I initially rated the value of this course as 3.5/5 but I'm bumping it 4.1. Adrian and his community will offer to very good help to your research projects etc. So if you're stuck on need advice, it's valuable. Rajeev and Jose will often offer similar support in their Udemy forums, but Adrian's depth and expertise shines if the problem is particularly hard or grounding breaking.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pros:**

\- Probably the best resources for Practical Deep Learning Computer Vision online

\- Excellent explanations by a very experienced and passionate teacher

\- All code is explained nicely

\- Because of his experience, you know he covers the most relevant and important topics

**Cons:**

\- Not for beginners, obviously, but it should be noted if you're a beginner you will feel overwhelmed going into this course

\- Explanations on video are mostly fluff, he doesn't really teach. It's more of an overview of what's covered in the book (which is the real meat of the course)

\- Expensive!

**Score - 4.5/5**

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION**

&amp;#x200B;

Even though I initially rated Rajeev's Udemy course the highest, it's only because of the insanely cheap price of $10. It's a great course and I keep coming back to it a lot. That said, when it goes up against Adrian's $300. It can't compete with the detail and explanations offered in Adrian's text. And I don't know how I missed Andrew Ng's Coursera's course, but the theory explanations in that course are best out all so far (Rajeev and Adrian do an excellent job too).

&amp;#x200B;

**NOTE**: I got around to reviewing Adrian's other bundles. I have a friend who purchased the ImageNet Bundle and he lent me the printed text (which has been updated since). But I don't have access to the videos. Here's a quick summary of the PyImage 3 Bundles

* STARTER BUNDLE - Very good value and an excellent resource. Covers all the basics in detail but doesn't get into more advanced and cooler areas of computer vision such as Object Detection and advanced CNNs.
* PRACTITIONER BUNDLE - Highly recommend you purchase this instead of the Starter Bundle. It's excellent and covers pretty much everything you'd need to know in Computer Vision Deep Learning
* ImageNet Bundle - It's excellent, but to me not really worth double the price of the Practitioner Bundle. It does have some nice projects and some advanced stuff. I was impressed nevertheless, but in terms of actual theory and knowledge, it's not much new content when compared to Practitioner Bundle.

&amp;#x200B;

In summary, I'll put it like this. For a $10 Udemy course, Rajeev's course will take you from beginner to a working professional. But to be an expert, you'll need Adrian's (of PyImage) course. Andrew Ng's course will ensure you're understanding key concepts right, it's brilliant in breaking down the theory.

Product B has 500 reviews with 90% 5 star rating  (stars are from 1 to 5, with 5 being best).

should i only look at the star rating and discard the number of reviews to decide which product is better ? 

product A 75% 5 star rating is less than product B that has 90% 5 star rating.

I guess logically one would say product B is better with 90% 5 star rating.

Thoroughly enjoyed calc, linear algebra, diff eqs, probability etc. Struggled a little in analysis but it was just different, still found it enjoyable. 

I took a machine learning class (note: this class was an elective offered in the cogsci department) and was introduced to data science. In my view it was a sampler class for cogsci students to be introduced to what machine learning is and focused on using python to make analyses on datasets without learning the math behind it, just using libraries.

The quarter after, I found there was another machine learning class, this time based in the math department. It required completion of a programming class, linear algebra, optimization, and probability theory (the cogsci version had no requirements aside from just the programming class), all of which I completed so I thought to take it. Boy that class kicked my ass ([Syllabus if interested](https://www.math.ucla.edu/ugrad/courses/math/156))

I don't know why, but I just struggled so much when it came to learning the actual math behind the topics that I merely only applied in that cogsci elective. I found the projects really enjoyable, but exams just bodied me and I ended up switching that class to Pass/No Pass because I was genuinely afraid of failing.

Maybe my knowledge of linear algebra and probability was just not strong enough, or maybe I didn't try hard enough. Perhaps I'm just not that great at math as I thought I was.

So I wonder...am I just not cut out for this given how much I struggled in this class, not even a graduate class? I was planning on getting a masters in CS with a specialization in machine learning, but after that course I have second doubts. Everyone on this sub seems to know what they are doing and talking about, wondering if anyone struggled a lot through learning it and still coming out fine.",12,2,False,self,,,,,

Just a one line intro on myself : I'm working as a Business Analyst in a retail firm right now and my work revolves around SQL, Excel and Tableau.

&amp;#x200B;

I found usually Computer Science people who have no Math background use the top down approach to step up their game, which means they use resources that have less Math theory and more of implementing the Math in real life scenarios and then learn the Math that is going behind that application. 

In alignment with the **top-down approach** I found the following resources  : 

1.  [https://app.dataquest.io/path/data-scientist](https://app.dataquest.io/path/data-scientist)   : DATAQUEST has a full blown path which includes Python basics, Data Cleaning with Python, SQL, Visualizing data, Probability and Statistics, Calculus, Linear Algebra and just so much more. I don't really know how much Math heavy this course is, but the reviews that I have come across so far have been good.

In alignment with the bottom up approach I found these resources : 

1.  [https://mml-book.github.io/](https://mml-book.github.io/)  : This book is still not fully written, but the reddit post under which I found this book had only and literally only positive things to say about it. 
2.  [https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110) : Stat 110 MOOC by Harvard along with the book Introduction to Probability by Joe Blitzstein.  which is to be read hand to hand along with the MOOC.

&amp;#x200B;

If you have come so far in the post, thanks a lot for reading, any recommendation regarding the approach(top-down or bottom-up), resource(book,MOOC) anything if you can share I will be glad to hear.

My biggest fear is I also don't have any background in Linear Algebra and Calculus, and at quite a few places I read I should first get the Linear Algebra and Calculus basics cleared before diving into Stats. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please let me know if you have anything to say regarding which resource among the above mentioned ones I should go for, or any other resource that you think can help me!

Code is hidden by default and can be toggled so that your post is readable for technical and non-technical audiences. Presentation and communication are the most important parts of data science in our opinion.

We want Kyso to be the best place to build a data-science portfolio, engage with the community and learn from others. Posts can be forked and run in Jupyter workspaces on Kyso (for free!). Forks are tracked. So its a cool way to reuse and extend work by the community.

&amp;#x200B;

Its a totally free service for individuals and wed love for you to try it out and give us some feedback (simply make a comment in this post or you can get me on [kyle@kyso.io](mailto:kyle@kyso.io)). Thanks for your time!",3,1,False,self,,,,,

I just mostly finished building a 1D CNN using TF, and I want to optimize a variety of parameters. These include: the number of layers, the size of the convolutional patch for a given layer, and the stride of the convolutional patch for a given layer, and the number of outputs in a given layer.

&amp;#x200B;

This is trickier than the previous optimization project I've worked since the number of layers impacts the maximum possible size or stride (if the patch size and strides are large, then after a few layers, the next layer will try to access a patch larger than the previous layer's output creating an error). 

&amp;#x200B;

**Possible questions and solutions:**

* Is it possible to add a constraint to skopt? ie. variable A &lt; variable B
* Would it be bad for me to implement a ""check"" where I test whether a set of parameters creates a possible TF graph and if not then it returns essentially positive infinity? (I am trying to minimize my objective function, so positive infinity would suggest the parameters are very bad).

&amp;#x200B;

**Another thing I am worried about:**

* Let's say I want to optimize having between 1 to 3 layers, the optimizer is testing num\_layers = 2. Although, the way I set this up, the optimizer is also tweaking variable: num\_outputs\_layer\_4. Is there any way for me to set it up so that the optimizer doesn't worry about tweaking the outputs of a layer that doesn't exist?

&amp;#8203;

    space = [Real(1, 3, name='num_layers'),
            Real(1, 16, name='num_outputs_layer1'),
            Real(1, 16), name='num_outputs_layer2'),
            Real(1, 16), name='num_outputs_layer3')]

Hey All,

I apologize if this question is redundant, but I've read so many conflicting comments on this question. I'm currently entering the final year of my M.S. in Applied Statistics and Data Analytics at University. I've take Calc/ LA tracks already, as well as a couple of theoretical/proof statistics courses. I'm also competent beyond SAS Base (Macros, etc), SAS SQL and have a novice-intermediate understanding of R. This is the extent of my programming knowledge. I currently have \~2 months to spare between classes and am looking for a solid course to give me a foundation of using Python for Statistical Analysis. I'm looking for an actual structured course (Coursera/Datacamp/etc.) that I can work through. I'm not interested in DIY Youtube, Kaggle, etc. at the moment, just a structured course I can complete. $$ is not an issue, willing to pay for the right program.

Hoping to hear from someone who has taken a course and benefited, or perhaps a working professional who has referred employees/subs to a program for business. Thank you!

My approach so far has roughly been:

* Removing those with &gt;25% missing
* Wrote some code to classify into categorical/numeric (about 1:4)
* Imputed missing for those remaining with ""other"" or median
* Removing variables with zero or near zero variance
* Sequentially removing numeric variables until none have a pearson correlation coefficient above 0.5

Remaining ideas:
* Find some way of removing categorical predictors that are highly dependent (chisq. P-value matrix of categorical features is one idea, but I cant find much online about this?)
* Take the cleaned variables (probably 150 by now) and put them in a tree-based method with variable importance like random forest/XGBoost
* Reduce dataset to maybe the top 30 in variable importance, learn what they actually mean, impute missings properly etc.

I feel extremely fortunate to have landed a data science internship as an undergrad, but I feel like a lot of things are working against my ability to actually be successful. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Lots of security red tape - it took 4 weeks to get Python and Anaconda. There's one ML server but it doesn't allow for more than 3 gigs of data and I have to offline my Jupyter Notebooks, which apparently only work in Python 2 as pre-approved by the company (each software goes through rigorous approval processes). I can't import new libraries without permission, nltk and seaborn are unavailable to me as of now.
2. Lack of industry data scientists - so there's one ""data scientist"" on the entire team I'm on. He just finished his masters in statistics and doesn't have much industry experience solving problems, so every time I ask him a questions he's basically just as uncertain as I am. Also, he codes exclusively in R and SAS when the position was advertised to be a Python one (my main language). 
3. Slow work culture - people leave early and are generally slow to respond and plan meetings. It takes several days to just get a meeting with someone to answer my questions. HR and Management is usually pretty quick, but they can't answer my technical questions. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really frustrated because I know opportunities like this are harder to find, but I feel like so much time is wasted and I'm genuinely trying to take advantage of the people and resources around me. Every time I take one step forward, it's actually 8 steps backwards. 

&amp;#x200B;

The good news is that I have an interesting project that aligns with my expertise. I just have no idea and very few / scattered means of moving forward with it. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Any advice for dealing with particularly bureaucratic companies, or companies with such an immature data science team / infrastructure that you can't actually get much done?

As  of recent, I've begun to ponder the idea of pivoting from my major into  data. I'm entering my final year of my mechanical engineering  undergraduate education. Right now, I'm currently completing an  engineering product development internship, which includes design work  and product validation (data analysis). Last summer, I worked in a  biomechanics research lab and assisted in  organizing/evaluating/processing signal data on MATLAB. Through both of  these experiences, and my coursework, I'm starting to realize the work I  most like completing is data organization, analysis, and visualization.  Although I haven't been exposed to the more important data science  skills/topics, I'm starting to think this field might be something I'm  interested in. I plan on beginning some self teaching in the coming  weeks- where do I start? Any recommendations for online programs?

Further,  if I find I like data analytics/science, would my major and  self-teachings be enough to get a job in the field? In the end, I see myself still working for an engineering/tech company, however, instead of doing design/engineering, I'd be doing data analytics for them.

I  would think it'd be valuable to pursue higher education in data  science/statistics. I have entry level knowledge in programming and  stats (I've taken intro prob/stat and Python classes)? Would an MS  in statistics or data science be better for me? Should I do this  immediately following graduation or should I enter the workforce, even if I can't get a role related to data (It'd most likely be a mech eng job)?

The data for org units should come from the HR system, and this data is pulled off by an ESB, translated into various formats and sent to various systems nightly.

The ESB isn't configured to list org units in the format required but there's enough data in the employee table to work it out somehow logically. So in the employee table it will say what org unit someone's in and what the parent of that org unit is, so a list of org units and their parents / children could be recreated through the likes of excel, although the formulas and macros will be complicated as data and their ranges change every day and this must be a repeatable process.

Setting this up in excel makes me uneasy as we should have something robust.

Some background on myself: I have a bachelors degree from UC Berkeley in Applied Math and economics. I graduated with a high gpa if that matters. Ive started teaching myself to code since January of this year. Some of my undergraduate coursework included Numpy/Pandas/Scikit-learn/etc. I have working knowledge of Keras and Ive done all the standard exercises in deep learning.

Originally I had the intention to go to a coding bootcamp, but most coding boot camps focus on full stack web development which is not what Im interested in doing long term. Im really interested in data science and applications of machine learning, with a broader interest in AI research so I felt that data science was a good focus for a graduate degree.

Why Im having doubts: Im not completely convinced that the salary benefits of this program will outweigh the costs. My priority is having a high paying stable job. I also feel like I could easily teach myself everything thats taught in the program. Ive gone through some sample coursework for graduate programs at schools like Columbia and it seemed on par with whats taught at an undergraduate level stats or computer science course at Berkeley.

&amp;#x200B;

So in the last weeks for various reasons I have been meeting with individuals that identified as data scientists, or that had taken several courses, wether online or in a university, of data science. 

What I realized is that most of this programs do not actually provide the necessary tools for doing a correct statistical analysis. They focus on visual presentation of results and some coding (which don't get me wrong, is quite important), but they do not teach what you actually need to do a good project: statistical theory ( and maybe some maths to understand the insides of the processes, but if all they do is of an applied nature, I think this is more of secondary importance). 

&amp;#x200B;

As a result, I have seen projects which , even if they are very pretty to look at, show a lack of understanding of some basic  ideas of statistics, such as running an OLS regression with no or few controls in a non-experimental setting and claiming to have found a causal relationship between the variables.

 In my case I can tell to an extent what is wrong with the design or methodology of the project, but I wonder, now that data science seems to be all the rage, how many people with similar skills have been hired by bussinesses that do not have people with knowledge of statistics, and as result can't know what is wrong with what they do. I know that this is not always true of course, but I worry that it might be relatively extended

I'm going to skip the back story and motivations but basically I am a Politics, Philosophy and Economics graduate of a few years. I want to switch to Data Science. My technical skills/background is very limited, I have been completing MOOCs and studying maths via university and A level textbooks for about 8 months.

I am confident I can get into a 'Data analytics' Masters program in a Russell group university provided I complete the first year of a maths degree this coming year.

The question I have is: 
Should I complete the first year of the maths degree and go straight into the Masters program or complete a full undergrad before considering moving to a Masters program (if so, is a Maths major the best option)? 
Is it worth the two extra years to be more comprehensive in my learning and have that extra time to build a more signifiant portfolio? 

Also would I be at any kind of disadvantage, eventually graduating in my late 20's vs those in their early 20's?

I have some problems with the task. How do I combine a categorical and numerical attribute - the company and the number of orders it made? Can someone give me some pointers on what type of regression might be best for this?

I am graduating soon with a master in data science and my skillset/experience can be summarized as follows:

1. Statistical machine learning: the Bayesian stuff (Gaussian processes, Gaussian mixture, Bayesian inference, ... ). And other standard machine learning algorithms of course.
2. Metaheuristic optimization methods like genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, ...
3. Basic stochastic processes theory. More like from the perspective of electrical engineering, NOT finance, as in how the process is being affected when pass through systems, ... Some basic signal processing theory.
4. Databases: SQL, MongoDB, Spark, Hive, ...
5. Basic of deep Learning, but did NOT take Machine Vision or NLP.
6. My thesis involves processing electromyographic signals.

Basically I am thinking of myself as more of a time-series/signal kind of guy, not vision or nlp. I am now rather interested in working with AI/ML applications to agriculture or industrial manufacturing or even smart-city/smart-grid.

The label for the data will be how likely a patient roster had a hospitalization in 3 months eg 60-100% would be high risk and below that would be medium or low risk etc.  I would basically train something like a logistic regression or a decision tree or classification model on this data and instead of outputting high risk or not high risk I can output the probability score for a patient roster to be high risk  for a specific patient roster. How does that sound? So basically I am thinking in the future we could feed a patient roster list and their characteristics at a certain time period and the model would predict the probability likelihood that the patient roster is high risk on a scale of 0-100 etc.

Daily Fantasy sports is a way to build fantasy sports teams daily to gamble. You create a team of 9 players (for the NBA, slightly different for other sports) under a salary cap constraint. You enter that lineup into a tournament of other players lineups, whoever gets into the top 20% wins money. What I'm trying to figure out is how to accurately predict which NBA player will be ""owned"" by the public and at what % will the field have him. I have all of the historical data which is each player, their salary, what their % ownership was for that day, their performance, and all other metrics needed. Other websites have these projections and they're relatively accurate so I know this is possible but I just have no idea how to even start this adventure. Any help would be much appreciated.

Proposed features that impact ownership:

\-Each players projected fantasy points for that day.

\-Scarcity at each position

\-Salary for each player

\-How many games are on the slate today?

\-Recent performance for each player? (last 5 game average, 10 game average, etc)

\-How many entries into that specific tournament is the user allowed? ( some are single ticket and others you can enter 150 lineups)

After my business engineering master I wanted to develop my data analysis skills and started a second master, in Statistics. I was in the Biostatistics track thinking I would enjoy doing research but applying data science to business problems is actually what I love doing most.

&amp;#x200B;

After one year I felt like I was learning how to do research, but I wanted to learn applied things, so I quit the master.   
I started developing skills on my own, like learning python (I'm already confortable with R and SAS).

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are the following:

* To what extent is a degree in statistics necessary ? I am afraid I don't get the jobs because I miss the technical diploma. I am confortable with probability, linear algebra and  quite a lot of statistical and machine learning methods. I just want to learn more about Time-Series analysis and Deep Learning because I have not used those methods much and I know they are important.
* Which skills should I develop most ? Should I focus on sharpening and developing my knowledge of statistical methods or should I learn more CS skills like development? I only have HTML/CSS basic knowledge and want to start on Javascript soon.
* Should I develop those skills before I start applying or should I do both at the same time?

NB1: In my job research I am open to consulting jobs as well as internal ones.  
NB2: If you need any more information I will answer in the comments and edit the post afterwards.  
NB3: I love learning via books so if you have recommendations they are welcome!",11,3,False,self,,,,,

Next spring, my company is paying for me to complete the Graduate Certificate in Marketing Management &amp; Digital Strategy at Harvard. I was checking out their website and noticed that they had some free Data Science courses. If you don't mind, I have a few questions for the community:

* My impression is that data science can integrate with marketing. Am I correct here, or should I be looking for something different?
* It seems that the free courses at Harvard are through edX. Assuming the answer to the above question is ""yes"", will this program give me the knowledge I seek?
* I took a few calculus and statistics courses during my MBA tenure, but it's been a few years. Should I refresh my abilities or will this be covered in the material?

The majority of these are scanned PDFs of varying quality and wildly varying layouts. The data elements im looking to extract are somewhat standardized. Some examples to illustrate : I need to extract client name and that might be recorded in the document as ""Client : client X"", ""client name: client x"", ""CName: client X"". Similarly, to extract invoice date I would look for ""invoice date : mmddyyy"", ""treatment date : dd-MM-yy"", ""incall date - ddmmyyyy"" etc..etc..

I've implemented a solution in R that :

1. Converts a scanned pdf to PNG
2. Uses Tesseract to run OCR
3. Uses Regex to extract key data items from the extracted text (6 to 15 items per document, depending on the document type) 

Each document type will have a slightly different way the data needs to be extracted. I have created functions to extract individual items e.g. getClientName(), getInvoiceDate() and then combine these into a list, so that for each document I get the extracted items. 

The above works, for most of the simple docs. I can't help feel that regex is a bit unwieldy and might not generalize to all cases - this is supposed to be a process that will used across my organization on a daily basis. My aim is to expose this extraction service as an API so that users in my organization can send pdf, images or text and my API returns key data in JSON.

This is a very specific use case, but I'm hoping there are others out there that have dealt with similar scenarios. Are there any tools or approaches that might work here? Any other things to be mindful of?",8,1,False,self,,,,,

I'm building a software tool for my organization with the goal of automating and standardizing provenance/audit, ETL, and build process for our data warehouse, and combining it with a data science ""lab"" pipeline similar to what's in Guerrilla Analytics and also seen in other ""agile data science"" books.

Some goals for the effort are:

* new and existing data provenance are maintained, data are audit-able from initial introduction through to end products (either in our data warehouse, or at the end stages of a data science effort)
* it's fast and easy to introduce new data into our ecosystem / data warehouse, and to create tests and manage risk around new and existing data
* it's fast and easy to create new data science ""lab"" efforts: environments, templates, version control, containers etc are set up automatically, best practices for folder structures and conventions are followed, etc

Ridge's book suggests many practices for the Data Receipt stage, and I wonder if and how you folks may be implementing the ideas.

* Received data storage and UIDs - are you generating and storing what would otherwise be locally-stored data UIDs, i.e. metadata, in a central place?
* Version control - how are you version controlling your data? Do you centralize this step / process?

In my company, there is a project for continuous improvement of the models for antifraud detection with the final goal to have 0 loss because of frauds.

We have switched from Amazon Machine Learning to Sagemaker with XGBoost recently, with a considerable improvement in the recall of the model. 

However, even though Sagemaker is flexible, it still has some limitations with pre-built algorithms. For instance, for hyperparameter tuning jobs, the objective metrics for optimizing dont include aucr, and using error or auc leads to worst models than default values. 

So, in my opinion,the natural next step for improvement is using neural networks. I have searched in Google and fraud detection is indeed a case for which deep learning is used. Nevertheless, in some problems, XGBoost outperforms neural networks. 

So, given the fact that I would need training for implement a neural network model better than a keras default one, which implies time (it is a difficult topic for me, both statistically and programmy) and maybe money (even a lot; for a presencial course), I have doubts about whether it would be worth it or not.

What do you think? Would I notice an improvement in my model in terms of increasing recall without decreasing precision? Not necessarily? No way that I achieve my goal? Any thoughts would be welcome. Thanks",13,1,False,self,,,,,

3. Since its a classification problem, I am sure they are gonna ask me why did you chose this model instead of this one? Any ideas about that?

Im new  here.

So I have 3 year data of sales (including product quantity/stock status and price adjustment logs)

I was tasked with the job to dig through order data to find how we can improve our sales performance. Specially we have identified a few goals below:

1- find products that sold well during X period in the past but are not selling well anymore this year
2- find new top sellers (sold well this year but not in the past)
3- prediction for next quarter so we can plan for stock..
4 - down the toad , we may start gathering competitive data for our analysis (competitors who are selling the same products and their price...) so we can know if competition impacts sales.

With 1 and 2, I think I can adopt excel but it is very tedious work for a small amount of data.
Also , since we need 3 and 4 anyway,  Im hoping to be able to utilise something else to automate this so we can pull data when required and start expanding the use cases further
Hope i can get some suggestions from the community.

I'm looking for some help in picking a data visualisation tool to build a dashboard out of. The actual dashboard builing process is relatively easy, but the extra conditions attached to it are not:

1. The tool needs to be free
2. The output (dashbaoard) should be viewable as HTML/web page
3. The data is sensitive and so cannot be open to the public
4. The tool itself is relatively easy to use (not a hard and fast rule)

I'm quite accustomed to Tableau and Power BI but points 1 and 3 means i can't use them. I did think about using plotly/Shiny but point 4 comes into play. Not sure if plotly/shiny allows sharing of HTML files securely as well.

If anyone can suggest any tools that might come close to satisfying these 4 items, please let me know.

Thanks

Apart from being open sourced and able to run anywhere (from Windows to Linux), it also has an active community filled with enthusiastic supporters and developers.The R Programming for Beginners aims to help people understand the basics of the programming language. Learn what exactly is R along with its history. Also, know how to install CRAN packages, which is important in learning R. Step into the pragmatic world of R by learning to make your first Hello World project. Learn about the four basic structures of data types and about the control structures. The summaries at the end of every chapter written in a few key points will help you to quickly gaze upon them before starting another chapter. Overall, if you have little prior experience with R, this book will prove to be of tremendous help.

I have a dataset that records percent of corrosion of metal structures in certain soils. IE - this metal structure is installed on install date, on a later date we measured it and it has corroded by X percent. We also know things like the PH of the soil, resistivity, soil type, altitude, etc... of the install site. 

I'm building a simple linear model to predict the amount of corrosion based on install location. But, as expected, if we just run it on the data as is - all it tells us is that the longer the structure has been installed the more corrosion we should see - and the other features have little to no effect. 

**How should I remove the effect of structure age from this data?**

The simple approach would just to be to assume that there is a perfectly linear relationship with age and corrosion (which is not the case) and just create a new response variable % corrosion/age and use that as the new X. But is there a better way of doing this?

**Here is my current plan:**

* BS in Business Data Analytics for an applied background in data analytics (data scraping, big data, visualization, and data warehousing)
* BA in Business Statistics for a solid stats foundation (applied stats, experimental design, regression analysis, statistical computing)
* Minor in Mathematics to improve my mathematical skills (calc 1-3, applied linear algebra)
* Internships each summer in data analysis to build coding skills and relevant experience
* Self-study more advanced Python throughout undergrad, work on some large projects for my honors thesis
* Integrate Python/R into my current Excel project where I track every hour of my year

Following undergrad, I'm hoping to attend a top 5 grad school for statistics, then search for a job from there.

&amp;#x200B;

**My main thoughts/concerns:**

&amp;#x200B;

Both of my majors are in the business school, meaning the BDA major will put me behind CS majors in terms of coding experience. (It's not possible for me to change my major(s) outside of the business school.) I know a business background can be advantageous in some circumstances, but will grad schools look down on me for taking an easier path?

&amp;#x200B;

My adviser believes I have a very good shot at a program the summer after graduating, in which I could study Japanese in Japan for 2 months in exchange for working at a federal agency for a year. I would *love* to have that experience, but would it be more important to have a solid internship that summer instead? Would a year of experience with data analytics in the public sector be worth it?

The demand for data scientists has grown significantly in recent years as there is a large amount of data that can be analyzed for the strategic advantage of businesses.

A good [data scientist](https://www.datascienceauthority.com/) is difficult to find as the role requires multiple skills. The responsibilities include collecting and exploring the data to find meaningful patterns and apply different modeling techniques to solve a particular business problem. The data scientist must be able to communicate his ideas and observations from the data to clients or business stakeholders and help them in business decisions.

&amp;#x200B;

**Mathematics and Statistics**

 Math is one of the key disciplines of all sciences, the same goes for data science as well

 Basic matrix algebra, probability, and statistics play a major role in data science

**Technology**

 Data Science techniques can be implemented using different technologies. Python and R are the 2 most widely used programming languages for data science

 Tensorflow, Keras and Pytorch are the major libraries used for deep learning

**Business**

 Domain expertise or business knowledge is a key factor that allows one to get an idea of how data science knowledge can be used to solve specific business problems

 Even before starting a data science project, business expertise can be used to formulate a problem statement which is helpful to lead the project in the right direction

**The 4Ms of Data Scientist Skill Training**

&amp;#x200B;

![img](7888rmcon1731)

The success of a data scientist does not depend just on gaining expertise at programming languages like Python or R but understanding the data available and how to use it to meet the business targets by building the appropriate model increases the value of a data scientist. The data scientist should be able to communicate with the team and also with the domain experts if necessary.

**Job Market for Data Scientists**

 According to industry estimates, organizations in the USA alone face a shortage of 140,000 to 190,000 employees with deep analytical skills. The US also requires 1.5 million managers and analysts who can analyze big data and make decisions based on the findings.

&amp;#x200B;

 When the consulting firm Accenture surveyed its clients on their big data strategies, more than 90 percent said they planned to hire more employees with expertise in data science  most within a year. However, 41 percent of the more than 1000 respondents cited a lack of talent as a chief obstacle.

 As per a survey conducted by Analytics India Mag and Great Learning, around 97000 analytics, data science jobs are vacant due to a lack of qualified talent.

TL;DR; looking for sampling techniques that can help me make inference to the entire population.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's say I have an oyster farm with 3mil oysters. Each oyster may or may not produce a pearl.

Due to logistic reasons I can only harvest a portion (\~700k) of the oysters and discard the rest. Because of this, I could never know how many pearls I should be getting, and therefore don't know if my current method is sufficient or if I'm leaving money on the table.

So far I just open up as many as possible, based on some choosing methods (such as shell size and weight), and use last year's harvest as a benchmark, but as you can see, this doesn't help me answer how many pearls could be out there.

&amp;#x200B;

So here's the question I'm hoping to answer:

1. What method should I use to find out, with good rigor, how many pearls are out there?
2. Since each pearl has a dollar value, what method can I use to know approximately how much value is available from my 3mil oysters?

I'm constantly trying to improve how to choose the oyster to harvest, either by finding higher value pearl or just finding more pearl. Being able to answer these questions help me gauge where I stand.

Based on my limited stats knowledge, I suppose I'm looking at some sampling techniques that can help me make inference to the entire population.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been fortunate enough to start a new job this financial year at a growing business consultancy who want in on analytics (business intelligence). Unfortunately, I am a one man band and will have to set up everything from scratch. It's a fantastic opportunity and it's really sink or swim. If this works out, the team will build behind me. If it doesn't, I'll be back on social security. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this firm, there are recurring clients who provide us with transactional data for their sales, each month for instance. From this, they may want to know where certain products of theirs sell best, or from what business units their highest revenue comes from. 

&amp;#x200B;

Naturally, I want to set up the data assets properly to house the data. As it is a consultancy, privacy and security are of paramount importance. In my previous firm (Big 4 Advisory), I used Alteryx and Tableau religiously, and made Alteryx databases to house this data (I know this is terrible, hence me being here). This data was manipulated in Alteryx to be visualised in Tableau for reporting. I do not want to implement this here. A secondary perk of this new job is that I can steer this workplace to using the industry standard, with me as the test dummy.

&amp;#x200B;

My idea is to set up databases with a separate schema for each client, depending on the data they give us. I would prefer storing data that will not change (e.g. transaction data) in the database, while data that may change (e.g. their list of customers each month/quarter) could be stored as a csv somewhere. I envision that this transactional data will be no more than several million lines of data per year per client. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking of something like MSSQL or Oracle for data storage, as my light research says they're good for security. For reporting/visuals, I want to add Python (seaborn/matplotlib) or R (shiny) to run over the top of the data, with Tableau there if we need pretty interactive dashboards. Running Python/R would also come in handy in a year or so when the firm wants to start doing predictive analytics.

&amp;#x200B;

Would very much appreciate everyone's thoughts. Thanks in advance!

TL;DR Alteryx and Tableau hack in a new workplace with no infrastructure for data storage and reporting, what do I recommend? MSSQL/Oracle with Python/R over the top? Tableau if needed?",34,66,False,self,,,,,
