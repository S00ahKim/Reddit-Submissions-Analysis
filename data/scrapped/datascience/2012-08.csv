I work for a tech-startup doing sales and have been fascinated by data science and how I can apply it to sales.

 I took calculus and probability classes in undergrad but I want to know what masters is most appropriate for me? Boston University has an engineering program for those that did not major in it (you start off taking undergrad classes then transition to masters). I'm currently taking linear algebra and java through my community college. Any recommendations for me? ",1,3
