I work for a great company as a data scientist. We have an amazing tech stack and I get to use a lot of the latest tools and learn from some bright minds in the industry. We use Google cloud Platform, python, SQL, airflow, and Tableau for front end dashboards. Because it is a start up with only 7 data scientists we handle all aspects of the data pipeline such as data ingestion and cleaning using airflow, data modeling, data warehouse in bigquery and front end dashboards using tableau. I have also deployed several models and put them into production using spark, scikitlearn wrapped around in a flask API with docker and kubernetes. In addition, I get to learn everyday on the job and do some really cool stuff. The only downside is that the pay is greatly below the market level wage for a data scientist. I make around $60k annually and the organization has very little room for growth or ability to move into a more senior position etc which is frustrating especially since I have been a few years in the industry and would be considered mid-level.

So long story short I interviewed at another company and got a job offer from them that is for $85,000 annually with better benefits. The job  has less of cool tech stack. It's a data scientist position in a more research academic industry at a large healthcare institution. They are primarily an R shop and were pretty reluctant to allow anyone to code in Python. They are not currently in the cloud and use postgresql for their database needs. They do some machine learning but nothing with productionalized models. The position would be more researched focused data science. Some pluses is that the data scientists there publish a lot of papers so I can get my name on some publications. The team is less technical but all seem very friendly and there would be a good work life balance there as well.  I would like to get your thoughts on what people who have been in similar positions chose to do and why and if you made the right choice or have any regrets?",9,0,False,self,,,,,

I graduated from a highly-ranked school last May with a BS in Chemistry but 7 semesters into college realized I *really* didn't want to pursue it as a career. I was desperate for a job over the summer and felt unqualified for everything I was interested in, and took an entry-level sales job (business development) at a young tech company because I got the offer and thought maybe I'd like it. I don't. I never want to even think about a sales job ever again. 

I'm leaving my company within the next month because staying really isn't an option at this point for a couple of reasons I won't get into. I've been applying for data analyst jobs because I am really interested in it and I know I am more than capable of learning the skills required to be successful...but therein lies the problem. I don't have any experience. I know chemistry and took one class on python in college, but that's it. So while my fingers are crossed, I'm not exactly anticipating that I'll be given the chance for an analyst role right away.

I have enough money saved that I can get through several more months without a job but I want to make sure I am being smart about what I should do next (such as suck it up and move back in with my parents and leave my apartment in the city). I've been thinking about those data science bootcamps (such as General Assembly) and whether or not it would be worth it to go into one of those to build the skills but I've read mixed reviews. I work hard so I think I would be on the ""got a lot out of it"" side of things. They don't seem to start for a month or two so I could start learning as much as I can beforehand to best succeed.

I have been working as an ""analyst"" for the last two years for a company in the credit union industry. We are a fairly large company in the industry but are small staffed. I work in the operations area and I am the first and only analyst in the area, but I do have an intern this summer. So far I have worked on some pretty basic projects, projecting product volumes a year or two out, looking at cost behaviors, and reviewing the seasonality of our products. This whole area is new for my company and I want to grow my abilities and knowledge so I can accomplish more. I'm not ready to go to a full masters program just yet but I am looking at certificates/programs that can help me grow and also build my credibility. What are some suggestions you have?

Some background on me:

* I graduated in 2015 from Miami University with a strategic communications degree
   * I bounced majors a few times and have taken business statistics, calculus, and marketing analytics courses.
   * My major was focus on PR but we did a lot of market analysis as part of it, determining growing opinion trends, growing stakeholder groups etc.
* I have some coding experience in HTML5, JavaScript, VBA, and SQL but I pickup on this stuff quickly. 
* I have begun learning R through PluralSight.
   * We have access to Power BI which allowed me to do some easy data visualization but I am looking to expand on this.
   * Since we are new to this area most my work has been simple reports an gathering data to create a new database/environment that allows me to perform analysis quickly.

My background is in scientific analytics: producing reports and insight with results from large amounts of data. I did this as an undergrad which lead me towards the field of Data Science. 

Last year I graduated with a MS and I got a 6 figure job in a low cost of living area as a Data Scientist at a large multi-national company. However, after 7 months of working at the company, I don't like the job. The goal of my position is to automate ML/AI programs to run over customer data so the customer can gain insight in some dashboard that the developers create. 

Even though I'm given ""hard problems to solve,"" I actually only work 20-30 hours a week, and routinely come up with solutions to problems that other team members are having. On top of this, my lead data scientist keeps ""stealing"" solutions I come up with and presents them to others as his own. To clarify that last point, he will be working on a problem for weeks without being able to come up with a passable solution and I'll discuss it with him and give him a better approach -- which he'll then present as his own idea. I'm completely fine with helping out team members come up with solutions, but I would like to be credited for my ideas...

I know this sounds like a ""dream job"" since I don't work a lot and am paid handsomly, but I'm absolutely bored on reddit all day and don't appreciate not getting credit for my solutions. One of my ideas less than 2 months in was able to get the company a multi-million dollar contract with another company that wouldn't talk to them before.

Not 100% sure where to ask this so I thought I might as well post it here.

I'm working on a side project to build a database and dashboard to display information for the organization I'm working with. My experience is Python and R, and much less web development which a big part of this project is turning out to be (which I don't mind at all! It's pretty fun and a good experience to see the entire data pipeline). I built the dashboard using Shiny and it's coming along nicely. However the one thing that the organization wants to do is to have an authentication for different users to log in and view the data. 

Now I've initially deployed my dash to an AWS Elastic Beanstalk using a Docker image but I am thinking it might be a better idea to deploy another image with a log-in form I would design using Flask or HTML/CSS or something else. (Though even creating a Flask Docker image is proving challenging at this point because I'm a real beginner with this stuff!) 

However, if I go that route, I have no idea how to integrate such a website with my already-existing dashboard (which I think will be able to fulfill what all my requirements will be). So ideally, I want to just create something on top of my Shiny stuff to act as a gate. The advantage of that is that I can create other webpages to add information (e.g. announcements or forms to have my team upload information to our database) in addition to linking to the dashboard.

How would I go about doing that? Alternatively, do you guys have any suggestions on how to better structure my code? I am aware that I can just use Flask+Dash and save myself some hassle but I am wondering if there is a way to go about doing this without scraping the work I've already done.",2,0,False,self,,,,,

An intersting/funny/scary section of the article:

**Knowledge I'd like to Showcase through this project:** 

* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization 
* Predictive Analysis 
* High Performance Computing

**Topics I'm particularly interested in:**

* **Healthcare/Medicine/Oral Health/Biology** (I'm a biology graduate &amp; previous dental student, so I have quite a bit of domain knowledge in this area)
* **Technology** (Another area I have quite a bit of knowledge in &amp; would love to work in after graduating)

**Topic Ideas I've had (&amp; that weren't good enough):**

* [Use CDC outbreak data to visualize &amp; predict foodborne outbreaks](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/norsdashboard/)
(Not much scope for this project, my instructor wants something *more*
* [Use PubG data to predict your chances of survival in a specific match](https://www.kaggle.com/skihikingkevin/pubg-match-deaths)
This is mainly only match based data &amp; I can combine it with player stats data, but again my instructor feels that there's not much I can do with this &amp; the project doesn't provide much value

Why do SVMs sometimes overfit?
For example, I made this: https://www.kaggle.com/kaggletoby/simpsons-id-challange/

Which tries to ID images of different Simpsons characters using a one vs one SVM. It runs using a subset of a large set of images, so, for example, I can pick 5 characters and try to find differences.

If I run it with (approx) equal-sized sets of images for each character I get a decent result, but if I add one or two sets of lots (for example Ned with 1400 images vs Skinner, Comic Book Guy &amp; Carl each with ~1000-800) it will place the majority on Ned.

We run tests which generate tons of log files.  The number and type of log files varies with the type of test.  We take the failures and put them into sightings that get assigned to engineers for debug. 

I want to create a machine learning system that analyzes the generated log files and automatically groups The failures based on the similarities in the log files.  There is a lot of information about how to cluster log files with the ""bag of words"" approach but my scenario has some interesting challenges that I am trying to work through.

1. The are multiple log files per failure.  I need to group the failures not the files specifically.
2. There are thousands of words in each log file but likely there will only be 10-20 that are important in classifying/grouping the failure.
3. I want the system to learn from the past so if an engineer regroups the failures it will use this information in the future.
4. Often there will only be groups of 1 so a new set of failures could have many groups of similar failures or few groups.

I have tried the following supervised approach which was unsuccessful.
1. Get past failures with their sightings as a training set
2. Extract word frequencies for each log file. 
3. For each log file, find the cosine distance from every failures bag of word to every other failure.  There are n(n-1)/2 records now.
4. Find the outputs which is 1 if the two records have the same sighting and 0 otherwise.
5.  The output of these steps is nxm matrix where the rows are the  failure pairs and the columns are the log files. Each element is the cosine distance for that pair and log file.
6.  I feed the nxm and the outputs into a learning model. (I tried naive Bayes, knn, random forest)
7. For new failures I generate the same matrix and determine the output.

What's the problem? The system almost always guesses 0 for the pairs.  I think the issue is that the 1s (pairs in the same sighting) are sparse so the model just normally guesses 0 and is right 95 percent of the time. Also logs that are different tent to have high cosine distance even when they are different because so many of the irrelevant words are the same.

I am being forced to take this upcoming academic year off for reasons I'd rather not go into.

I am halfway into my degree (2/4 yrs done) and just started to take major-specific courses at my university. As such I don't have too much experience or exposure to the topic outside of my own exploration of the field. Likewise, I would need something that's lower/entry level. 

My question is, after many fruitless conversations at my school (with advisers, etc) about what they might recommend I do in the meantime, I was wondering if there is some sort of program/class/etc that I could either 1) take on the side or 2) maybe even full time and have work less a priority... until I return as a full time student. I'm looking for something that would advance me further into the field/aid in not being away from any academia for so long.

When I woke up this morning, the question was still on my mind, so I decided to mess around and see what I could find.

**THE CONCEPT**

I wanted to look at a couple different ways to portray release date and see how they affected the success of the movie. To do this, I first had to define a measurement of movie success. Seeing as it is the producing company who decides the release date of a movie, I decided to use the most important metric to them: $$$. However, it didn't make sense to use simply the revenue gained by the movie, because raw revenue numbers have an innate bias towards bigger movies with bigger budgets. For example, a movie with a production budget of $200 million that grosses $700 million would be considered extremely successful. However, so would a movie with a production budget of $20 million that grosses $70 million. Raw revenue number would show the second movie as being equally successful as a movie with a production budget of $200 million the grosses $250 million, which makes no sense. As such, I decided that my metric for success should be total revenue divided by production budget, thus scaling all of the movies to an equal scale.

The three portrayals of release date that I chose were week of the year, month of the year, and day of the week. 

**THE DATA**

At first, I used data scraped from [boxofficemojo.com](http://www.boxofficemojo.com), but then I realized that it only included data for movies that had grossed over $200 million. Seeing as that excludes a lot of the less successful movies (an important exclusion, since one of my variables is supposed to measure success), I had to switch. I ended up using data from the [TMDB 5,000 Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata/data), which is data in csv format regarding 5,000 movies. It included all of the values I needed, which were title, revenue, budget, and release date.

**THE DATA WRANGLING**

First, I calculated the necessary values. Revenue weighted by budget was easy enough, and I called it percent return. With my original data this name made a lot more sense. However, only as I typed this up did I realize that it is nonsensical. I'm too lazy to go back and fix it, so it will stay that way.

R deals with dates really well, so in order to display them on a graph, all I had to do was make a new column equal to the release date minus January 1 of the release year. I called this column, logically, days_since_jan_1.

To get week of the year, I subset the rows with day values in the correct range and set the correct week number. I applied this to all 52 weeks using a for loop. The 365th and 366th day (leap years) were thrown in with the 52nd week.

Month of the year was easy, I just pulled a substring out of the date value.

For day of the week, I converted the release date to a POSIXlt object and used $wday to record the numerical day of the week. Sunday is 0, Monday is 1, Tuesday is 2, etc.

**THE DISPLAY**

Now that I had the necessary values, I displayed them in a variety of formats. First, I created data frames of weekly, monthly, and daily medians and displayed them in scatterplots. These were the results: [Weekly](https://imgur.com/vrLmT1g), [monthly](https://imgur.com/2A3xIFT), and [daily](https://imgur.com/jOOiB0b). Remember, the days of the week are 0=Sunday, 1=Monday, 2=Tuesday, etc.

However, since these graphs are automatically scaled, any small difference can look significant. For some context, I graphed them as box plots, too. [Weekly](https://imgur.com/3nRXjlQ), [monthly](https://imgur.com/LvAw6nD), and [daily](https://imgur.com/uv6J9Lw).

**STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE**

There's no real way to know if all of this work means anything until statistical significance tests are applied. I chose to use a one-factor T Test to compare the mean of each week/month/day to the population mean.

*Monthly Results*

I'm going to start broad and work my way in. With an alpha of 0.05, the months with a statistically significant difference from the population mean were:

* January (lower)
* March (lower)
* September (lower)
* October (lower)
* June (higher)
* November (higher)

When the alpha was lowered to 0.01, the months with a statistically significant difference from the population mean were:

* September (lower)
* June (higher)

*Conclusion:* Movies are most profitable when released in the early summer and towards the end of the year, and least profitable when released at the beginning of the year and at the beginning of the school year.

*Weekly Results*

With an alpha of 0.05, the weeks with a statistically significant difference from the population mean were:

* January 1-7 (lower)
* February 19-25 (lower)
* March 25-31 (lower)
* April 1-7 (lower)
* August 19-25 (lower)
* August 26-September 1 (lower)
* September 9-15 (lower)
* October 7-13 (lower)
* May 20-26 (higher)
* June 17-23 (higher)
* June 24-30 (higher)
* November 4-10 (higher)
* November 11-17 (higher)
* December 9-15 (higher)

When the alpha was lowered to 0.01, the weeks with a statistically significant difference from the population mean were:

* August 19-25 (lower)
* August 26-September 1 (lower)
* September 9-15 (lower)
* June 24-30 (higher)
* December 9-15 (higher)

*Conclusion:* Movies are most profitable when released between late May and late June and between November and early December and least profitable when released in early January, between mid February and early April, and between mid August and mid September.

*Daily Results*

With an alpha of 0.05, the days of the week with a statistically significant difference from the population mean were:

* Friday (lower)
* Saturday (lower)
* Wednesday (higher)
* Thursday (higher)

When the alpha was lowered to 0.01, the weeks with a statistically significant difference from the population mean were:

* Friday (lower)
* Saturday (lower)
* Wednesday (higher)

*Conclusion:* Movies are most profitable when released on Wednesdays and least profitable when released on Fridays and Saturdays.

Hey


I know a lot of similar questions have been posted, but of course I would greatly appreciate your feedback. My question is if whether or not data science would be viable career path for me.


I have two masters degrees, one in financial management and one in educational science (mostly research). In the second master I gained a lot of experience in IRT (item respons theory), and wrote a thesis about it. My other thesis was also heavily loaded with statistics.
So although I dont have a degree per se in stats, I did gain a lot academic experience and always aced these courses. I used R for the first, SPSS for the second.


Meanwhile I have 5 years of professional experience in general management. During these 5 years I have been avoiding choosing a specific field, fearing I wouldnt be able to go back later. Im interested in a lot of fields, most of them related to IT or finance. However I feel like I have come at a time where I feel I should go into a more specific topic. The last 12 months I came to the conclusion data science might be the best choice. It brings back my love for statistics, it involves programming (which I picked up when I was a kid) and its future proof.


I work a lot with data at my current job, but its mostly excel (although I do write some python code every few weeks). 


Im going abroad soon for 6 months to do a combination of studying the countrys language and doing a local data science internship (company is yet to be determined). Meanwhile I have been taking Coursera classes in data science and machine learning that are going pretty smooth (mostly given my background). Another personal important factor is the fact I love doing the courses and the exercises.


Im ready to put lots of work in, but as you could read I dont have a PhD in Math or engineering, so Im still not sure if its the right choice.


Any advice would be greatly appreciated, dont be afraid to crush this idea.


Thanks in advance.

Winning submissions get a paid trip to Sydney, Australia, to present their findings at the International Workshop on Business Process Intelligence, which is co-organized with the International Conference on Business Process Management. 

This year's edition of the BPIC is particularly interesting for /r/datascience, since it involves a supervised learning task: the company would like to predict as early as possible whether a running instance of their business process will result in a positive outcome, or in a negative outcome. This makes the challenge this year an early sequence classification task.

Lastly, employers that I have talked to have always stressed the concept of domain expertise as different on campus events.

I have a couple of iMacs with 24/32 GB of RAM, but I often have to work around that by working with data in batches. I am also chewing through more and more storage. I am generally using Python/pandas with growing use of databases and ML. Most of my use with lots of data is prepping, exploring, and summarizing. For my actual regression models with aggregated data, they run easily on a desktop, so they're not driving my thinking here.

I've been looking at a few options:

1. Build a Linux desktop with more RAM and storage (and possibly a solid GPU) and connect to it locally/remotely using Jupyter. The downsides are cost,having to keep it running and updated, and having robust and secure remote access.
2. Use a cloud service. I like what I'm seeing from Azure Notebooks, but it's going to be some time before this is developed into a solid option (in part because of hardware instance limitations while it's a beta).
3. Buy an iMac Pro or wait out a Mac Pro update. Downsides here are cost and the lack of an nvidia GPU option.
4. Keep working around limitations. Essentially, this is assuming that the cost or overhead of the options won't offset the marginal efficiency from having more hardware.

Eventually, I think a cloud service will be the best option. However, it doesn't seem like we're there yet, and I think that it may be long enough that I should bridge the gap with more hardware. The difference with being an academic is that I'm largely responsible for the whole chain of making my stuff work (other than special cases like using the university's cluster), so I want things that just work to the extent possible.

I'll use the kaggle housing prices challenge as an example because I'm doing that now. 

Often, some categorical \(but not ordinal\) feature will have, say, 5 different values, and if you plot the values of that feature vs the label \(SalePrice\), you can notice a difference between values that would probably give you some information when trying to predict the SalePrice. Here's an example:

https://i.redd.it/gr2vgxj0tjw01.png

I've ordered them in order of ascending mean SalePrice. So you can see that there might be some information from this feature.

So it seems like a common strategy at this point is to do one hot encoding \(OHE\), so that the feature becomes 5 separate binary features, and instead of having the value, say, ""RM"" for the feature, the new RM feature has the value 1 and the other new features \(C, RH, RL, FV\) have the value 0. This strategy seems like it would work for either linear regression or something like random forest regression \(RFR\) \(the two models I'm messing around with\), right?

I actually have a couple questions about this strategy. First, let's say the mean of two of the feature values \(in this case, RM and RH\) are really similar. Is there any reason to, or not to, combine them before OHE? It seems like it would save a feature, and simplicity is usually better.

My other question is, let's just assume we were only using RFR \(not lin reg\). If I understand decision trees usually, for a non\-ordinal categorical feature, the DT for only that feature must do some sort of binary type search, like asking {C, RM, RH} or {RL, FV}, and then splitting it further from there \(is this correct?\). But let's say that the categorical feature did actually have a monotonic ordering to it \(like above\). Then could it be worth converting it to a numerical feature, because that would allow the DT/RFR to do the same thing it does for numerical features?

Lastly, and this may be really dumb, I was thinking about how to convert a feature \(that's categorical, non ordinal, but does have some ordering it if you sort it\) like above to be used with linear regression, without doing OHE.  For simplicity, let's say you have a feature like this with the 4 values A,B,C,D:

https://i.redd.it/7qvrxl84xjw01.png

They're obviously increasing. If we just instead replace them with the values 1,2,8,9, then we get the plot:

https://i.redd.it/pzsy8t69xjw01.png

And now we have one linear feature that takes care of all the values, rather than as many features as the original feature had unique values. A common reason I hear that you can't do this is that the different feature values don't actually have any relation to each other \(on the x axis\) \-\- but I don't think this matters: as long as your test set doesn't have new values for the feature, I think it should work.

Is there some reason this wouldn't work? thanks!",8,7,False,self,,,,,

Because now it works. With the arrival of cloud  computing and multi\-core machines \- we have enough compute capacity at  our disposal to churn large volumes of data and dig out the hidden  patterns contained in these mountains of data.

This technology  comes in handy, especially when handling Big Data. Today, companies  collect and accumulate data at massive, unmanageable rates for website  clicks, credit card transactions, GPS trails, social media interactions,  and so on. And it is becoming a challenge to process all the valuable  information and use it in a meaningful way. This is where machine  learning algorithms come into the picture. These algorithms use all the  collected past data to learn patterns and predict results or insights  that help us make better decisions backed by actual analysis.

You  may have experienced various examples of Machine Learning in your daily  life \(in some cases without even realizing it\). Take for example

Credit  scoring, which helps the banks to decide whether to grant the loans to a  particular customer or not \- based on their credit history, historical  loan applications, customers data and so on

Or the latest  technological revolution from right from science fiction movies  the  self\-driving cars, which use Computer vision, image processing, and  machine learning algorithms to learn from actual drivers behavior.

Or Amazon's recommendation engine which recommends products based on buying patterns of millions of consumers.

In  all these examples, machine learning is used to build models from  historical data, to forecast the future events with an acceptable level  of reliability. This concept is known as Predictive analytics. To get  more accuracy in the analysis, we can also combine machine learning with  other techniques such as data mining or statistical modeling.

This progress in the field of machine learning is great news for the tech industry and humanity in general.

But the downside is that there arent enough data scientists or machine learning engineers who understand these complex topics.

Well,  what if there was an easy to use a web service in the cloud \- which  could do most of the heavy lifting for us? What if scaled dynamically  based on our data volume and velocity?

The answer \- is new cloud  service from Microsoft called [Azure Machine Learning](https://www.simpliv.com/machinelearning/machine-learning-in-the-cloud-with-azure-machine-learning). Azure Machine  Learning is a cloud\-based data science and machine learning service  which is easy to use and is robust and scalable like other Azure cloud  services. It provides visual and collaborative tools to create a  predictive model which will be ready\-to\-consume on web services without  worrying about the hardware or the VMs which perform the calculations.

The  advantage of Azure ML is that it provides a UI\-based interface and  pre\-defined algorithms that can be used to create a training model. And  it also supports various programming and scripting languages like R and  Python.

In this course, we will discuss Azure Machine Learning in  detail. You will learn what features it provides and how it is used. We  will explore how to process some real\-world datasets and find some  patterns in that dataset.

Do you know what it takes to build sophisticated machine learning models in the cloud?

How to expose these models in the form of web services?

Do  you know how you can share your machine learning models with  non\-technical knowledge workers and hand them the power of data  analysis?

'Data governance' can mean a lot of different things, depending on who you're asking.  For us, There are a few primary areas that we are focusing on under the aegis of 'Data Governance':  For us, we are talking about policies and practices regarding 1) How data is ingested into our databases 2) How various data types are formatted (IE locations as geocoded lat/long instead of address strings) 3) How and where data is stored 4) Who has access to what data at what point in time.

I'm hoping that the good people of this sub can help me get pointed in the right direction, as well as pitfalls to avoid.

Hi everybody I am now doing bachelor in mechanical engineering 2nd year at ETH Zurich, I am now planning on changing my program to either CS or MATHS since I am thinking about doing my MS in Data Science or Maths Finance in the US.

Maths programs(particularly BS) at ETH is super legit theoretical and rigorous while CS surely also holds that high caliber and ""real-dealness""(numerous subjects rankings can tell). If change to Maths I have the chance to start at their 2nd year which makes it 4 years to get my BS degree at ETH,yet If I change to Maths it's going to be a whopping 5 year-study at ETH untill I finally got my BS degree since I could only start at first year again...I don't know the academic reputation and recognition of ETH and these two particular fields among top CS institutions in the US(e.g. CMU,MIT and Stanford...I'm not sure if ETH and these schools are at the same level tho...) or in other english-speaking countries(e.g. UK,CAN) looks like?

Plus which one could be a smoother transition academic-wise: I've taken one semester of C++, Analysis 1+2+3, Lin Al 1+2, Physics 1+2.

And also what would be potential barriers if I chose to change to either programs academic-wise?

Which program could prepare me better for a career after graduating from MS in the US as Data Scientist/Analyst or Quantitative Analyst?

Description: It is the response of survey and results regarding usage of services for financial transactions using traditional methods or mobiles as a medium in a developing country. The study was conducted to understand the usage of technology for financial services by men and women in developing countries to find out how comfortable they are to use technology for this purpose. A dictionary is provided with the dataset which you may refer to column details. The dataset is big and contains many missing values. In the dataset, for male they have used 0 and for female are using 1. The purpose of this problem is that you will be able to understand how to process real data for valuable information extraction.

1) Preprocess the data
2) Which feature engineering techniques you used?
3) predict the gender of the survey respondent.
4) Predict that respondent is female with a certain probability.
5) Find interesting patterns that are associated with a specific gender


1) I want to know what preprocess can I do in the data. I can remove missing and duplicate values, but for missing values there is a problem. If the survey respondent chose other in the religion column (96 value in column DG3A), they specified the name in the next column. But if they gave a response such as 1 (which is for Christianity) in the DG3A column then the value in the next column would be empty. How would I cater for these missing values (which aren't really missing instead needed not to be filled)?

2) I am not sure which ones should I use and how.

I have access to a huge pile of data stemming from different smartphones. (No, I'm not from - formerly - Cambridge Analytica.) These data are gathered from consenting participants, who install our app to let us log their smartphone behavior. The idea is to be able to answer research questions with regard to smartphone use and addiction, the impact of interventions, etc.

The data is just sitting there, at the moment, with no immediate research question underway (I'm sure that'll change in the near future though).

What do I have exactly?

* App-events: which app was used, which category (social, communication, etc.), at which location and point in time, for how long, part of which session (see below), and whether you followed a notification to start the app (e.g. WhatsApp notification was tapped to start convo)
* Sessions: starts when you pick up and unlock your phone, ends when it gets locked
* Notifications: what notification, from which app, at which time.

My question to you guys: what type of questions would be the most interesting to answer with this type of data? I'm currently looking into association rule mining, and simple stuff like 

* How many sessions are the result of a notification being tapped, compared to the overall use?
* How long do these sessions last (do people get stuck in smartphone use because notifications draw them in)?

Anything else you guys are thinking of? I feel like there's so much I could do, that I'm not sure where to start.",7,3,False,self,,,,,

One of my experience when soliciting opinions of my pics from friends had an inherent bias in itself. Quite often, my female friends would have a favourable opinion compared to male ones. This led me to investigate if there is an inherent bias in the way a person responds to same gender pictures.

To check and validate for this hypothesis, I used a picture of mine and got it rated from [Photofeeler!](https://www.photofeeler.com) for ratings from the community. The intent was to understand and capture if the hypothesis can be statistically validated.

[Photofeeler!](https://www.photofeeler.com) is a means to get community votes to rate ones pictures. You could either use earned karma to get votes or buy credits to exchange for votes.

Experimental Design

* Null Hypothesis : There is no difference in how different gender are perceiving picture attractive levels.

* Alternate Hypothesis : The opposite gender will rate the pictures attractive levels higher.

* Male group sample size : 23
* Female group sample size : 20
* Parameter under investigation : Attractive
* Significance Test : Fisher exact test (small sample sizes , the underlying distribution are normal as well)

Furthermore, kind of stressed for the deadlines, so you guys and girls are my last hope ! 
For my dissertation I am comparing the different measurements of income inequality. All these measurements, measure income inequality in a different way, using different components of income (e.g. disposable income, real income). The aim is to find the best/ most suitable measurement for income inequality. To compare these different measurements, I want to use a synthetic/artificial dataset, to overcome any biased results. 
This dataset I want to construct, needs to have the real information about the income inequality in this dataset. In that way, I can compare the other measurements (e.g. gini-coefficient, theil-index, quantilies, Atkinson measurement) to the real outcome (income inequality) in the dataset. The number that comes closest to the outcome of the dataset should be the best/most suitable measurement for income inequality.
With the idea of the more data, the better, I was thinking of constructing a dataset with information about a 1,000 households. With the artificial/synthetic information about the income of these households, I can use certain tax tariffs, price levels and inflation to create the other datapoints, which are used to measure income inequality. Lastly, for some of the income inequality measurements, a time-period is needed, to see the change over years. Thus, this dataset needs to be constructed as a time-series. 

As a beginner in data science, this constructs the following problems/questions for me;
-	How to create this synthetic dataset? (Fourier transform from a real income dataset?)
-	How to valid this synthetic dataset?
-	How to get the real income inequality out of the dataset, so I can compare this to the other outcomes of income inequality measurements?

For instance, in classification the proportion of responders conditional on the estimated probability being in the top decile is often used.
 
My problem is that this measure can be very unstable when choosing between models. An extreme case is when comparing k-nearest neighbour models where the fitted probabilities are all multiples of 1/k and so there are lots ties. But there is also some instability for models with more continuous fitted probabilities, just because of how the responses happen to fall to one side or the other of the decile boundary.

Several obvious approaches suggest themselves. My question is whether there is a standard way to measure lift that will smooth out these kinds of irregularities so that it can be better used as a model selection criterion.

I am a 3rd year PhD graduate student in University of Iowa Chemistry. My undergraduate background was also in Chemistry, with Calc 1,2,3, linear algebra, ordinary differential equations, but no statistics. I also do not have formal training in computer science.

I realized a while backthat I do not want to become a professor or a R&amp;D scientist, and instead realized that my true passion might be working with data.

I have been very interested in becoming a data scientist or analyst, preparing for it during my PhD training right now. I do not know which would suit me better (data science vs business analytics). But, I am also stuck on a few options I can pursue.

Option a, take online classes, and obtain nanodegrees or certificates. Example would be udacity,edx, or etc.

Option b, apply for online masters in analytics, such as one offered in Georgia Institute of Technology.

Option c, get into data bootcamp for PhDs. This option would be combined with a).

I know that I am determined enough to teach myself the relevant statistical and computational framework through online material.

On the other hand though, having something really tangible, like a masters degree on top of my PhD, could be a better use of my time because employers might be more attracted to the degree and could result in me successfully landing a data science job after graduate school. Since my PhD would be from University of Iowa, which is not as renowned as Georgia Institute of Technology, I am also attracted to the name value.

I work at a start-up and have a question if anyone does growth experiments. Basically, our CEO believes that most experiments should be tested against conversion(paying us money). 

Since we have a large top of funnel but small conversion rate, experiments ran directly against that end up taking a very long time for significant results. I also think that loses some significant results because not all inputs are individually significant but as a whole, they create actual conversion growth. 

I am of the opinion that while our goal should still be higher conversions, we should be testing against whatever the behaviour is of that actual test. For example, if we're experimenting on raising usage of a certain feature, we should test against usage of that feature(while also looking to make sure we're not doing a trade-off somewhere else).

(pretty detailed post)",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/8ijm1q/hi_data_scientists_what_statistical_techniques/,understandthings100,1525997987,"**facts**

- I have a google sheet (but excel is likely the same) with data about youtube videos

The question is asking someone like you what is best and better since you know far more than me. You understand a whole more about data than I do'

**the goal is to be able to tell which are the best videos**

some datapoints we have:

1. **total number of views**
2. **% that rated** - % of users that rated (forumula is **number of users that has liked or dislike the video** / **total number of views** * 100. Timing it by 100 so that the result/outcome is easier to see on the google sheet since it has less 0s

1. % of likes (likes : dislike ratio).

higher numbers of likes dislikes, of views are all datapoint related to sample size

- larger sample size of these datapoints is a better indication of the % like
- then this datapoint is likely going to be a better indication of the % like (likes : dislike ratio)



------



**what is the goal?**

**we want to be able to find the best videos**

things we want to be able to do are:

- tell the significance between 2 videos when the data is very similiar

here's an example of a practical way of how it's currently done (without having good understanding of data science):

**example:** looking at the raw data 

1. say you have 99.5% (% like) and 100k views and 0.5x (for the % that rated)
2. say you have 99.0%  (% like) and 100k views and 2.5x

which is better? (most likely better?)

- so i've no idea what the data/stat way of guessing which is better, but the definite practical way is that the 2nd option is better because a 0.5% difference (in the % like) is enough to 'make up' for the 2.5x / 0.5x difference (in % that rated the video)

- i just know this from experience, 

- also this is on google sheets as mentioned above, and so there are also conditinoal formmating that color codes those numbers so it's easier to tell that 2.5x is *significalty* better than the 0.5x

- because the shade of the color shows the significance 


**cont example: the probelm is when the numbers are too similiar:**

1. say you have 97% (% like) and 500k views and 1x (for the % that rated)
2. say you have 99.0%  (% like) and 10k views and 1x

so i really dont know anymore, and it's not because the sample size (10k views) is too low, because this is actually a very low sample size (know this from looking at the data)

even if it was 50k views, i still dont know

i guess one way is you coudl say **'how much is 1% or .5% worth in views?**

like 1% = 300k views or something, but this is hard cos not all the numbers across the 'videos types' are the same

**we want to be able to find some way to 'sort the best videos' somehow, prefer automatically**

- if a 'margin of error' datapoint/signal could tell us that, that is helpful then, ill just color-code the 'margin of error' on g sheet so at a glance...
- wait the margin of error needs to be somehow adjusted/factored into the 'one number'
- because only with 'one number' can there be a godo and easy way to tell which videos are better relative to another one

- to find some good way to tell what is the best videos
- i think some call this an 'index score' or 'index number' 

does any of this help? any questions on any of these?

**which one of these methods are most accurate for these goals mentioned?**

- https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/ptvrh/eli5_imdbs_top_250_scoring_system_aka_a_true/

**and why are is that one most accurate?**

**would there be any unknown/unmentioned methods that are more accurate?**

You understand a whole more about data than I do

end goal is to find the best videos in all the good ways that could be possible?



------



**what is the problem?**

the sample size related data is separated into two datapoints:

1. **total number of views**
2. % that rated - % of users that rated (forumula is **number of users that has liked or dislike the video** / **total number of views** * 100

I need to combine some of the other datapoints into one number because it's too hard to compare many datapoints of videos that have different numbers

- I was thinking about the only way I know how to go about this would be to simply multiply first the datapoint and second

- This gives you a number that basically seems to mean that a video with a **higher % of likes** would lead to a higher result/outcome

- Even though I'm trying to make one number, this method of multiplying seems flaws because:

- if the '% of likes' is relatively higher, it would seem to 'overweight' the final result/outcome

**Is there a statistical trick or way to prevent or mitigate this possible occurrence of 'overweighting'?**



------

**other things i did with the data**

'videos types' are the topics the videos talk about, or the kinds of videos they are

- so what i did was i 'clustered' (i think that's a data/stats word), so i cluttersted/sectioned/groupped the various topics (and kinds of videos)
- so someone may say that the classfication should only be done by topics and not kinds of videos, and the two different classfication systems of videos should not be combined together (in an additive manner) into one classfication sysetem
- but since the ratings are pretty different across some 'sets of topics', it doesnt seem liek it would matter too much (due to this high variability/variance in rating distributions)



------

**please input since it helps with progress of this problem**

My previous job was in a similar company (before that I was in grad school). I have in total 5yrs of experience in DS.
 I have been wondering for a while about changing scenery. I feel that at the companies I have been working at, the work is quite established, and people get their own niche. I totally feel happy about the direction I am able to give to my product, but it's still an impact on a limited sector of the whole company, if you see what I mean.

For these reasons I am totally non interested in moving to FANG-style companies. Also I don't care much about the success of these companies. TBH I also don't care about what my company does, but my happiness and satisfaction come from the technical aspect and challenges of my day to day job.
I'd like to join a small startup with a product I believe in. Something like being first or second DS at a company with ~20 people.

Here come the question(s). How does one find those startups? Those are definitely not the companies recruiters contact me for on linkedin. 
Is there any social/online circle I am not aware of? 
Has anybody done a transition like mine? How was that? I guess I should expect a reduction in base salary and increase in shares, obviously with the risk those turn into monopoly money. Is that correct? What about insurance? (I have a pretty sweet deal now)

My company sells product on Amazon, and commercially available tools for forecasting orders, inventory, sales, refunds, etc are a bit too basic and do not deliver what I need.

Currently I have a bunch of excel sheets which do the job perfectly fine, but its getting to be too time consuming keeping them updated with the latest data. I have to download sales reports, add the latest data into my sheets, hit refresh, and then all is well. The problem is that I have so many sheets that cant be consolidated into one, that inputting the data takes hours every week. Amazons API also offers data that I cannot get through downloading reports, so I would like to start receiving my data automatically through API calls for more advanced forecasting.

My end goal is to call the needed information through Amazons API, and then have some system which automatically parses and manipulates that information to my predefined specifications, and then displays a visualization and a few forecasts. I have hundreds of SKUs and would want an overall visualization of the entire business, and an individual for each SKU. This is where it gets difficult for me.

It sounds like I just defined Power BI, but I cant import API data with Power BI. I also would need to still run all of this through my hundreds of spreadsheets. I have an individual spreadsheet for each product we sell as I like to keep detailed analytics on each one, and compiling them all into a single workbook would be CPU suicide. I cannot think of a single way to keep doing this with Excel. A single workbook of all my SKUs which pulls data from a single data workbook would work, but it would probably crash every time I tried to use it.

I really have no idea how to go about this other creating a web app with Ruby and/or Python. I just feel like that may not be the most efficient route since displaying the data on a web page would be time consuming",2,6,False,self,,,,,

In that time I have taken initiative to improve many aspects of my programs including:


Automate ~ 20 reports that were previously completed using excel pivot tables. 


Established documentation for these reports, the data collection process, data cleaning, etc.


Corrected 2 years worth of incorrectly entered data


Consolidated up to 10 years of data for 6+ programs. Data was stored in monthly/quarterly/yearly files and, due to the ongoing nature of data collection, contained duplicate information across files. This consolidation has allowed my to identify errors in the data sets and improve reporting.


Established relationships with program directors to discuss data collection, reporting needs, and assist them by creating user-friendly data collection documents and using their input to adapt reports and/or create new variables


Started a data audit for 4 programs. After finding numerous errors, un-entered data, incorrectly entered data, inconsistent data entry protocols, etc, I decided to just look at the data from top to bottom. These programs had changed hands on numerous occasions and, without any documentation, each person handled things a little differently. This is still on going, but it's been helpful.


I've starting writing code for as much as I can. I held off for a while because my co-workers rarely code and I didn't want to set up an infrastructure that someone else couldn't follow. I got tired of doing things the hard way so I just started coding everything. It's been very helpful for ad hoc requests and other occasional reports.


I've also begun the process of transferring our data to a more secure platform. This is taking a bit of time due to the data audit and we are making some changes to another program, but things haven't been finalized yet.


Once I feel like I can trust the data and have transferred it into a more secure platform, I'll be able to do some research on the data. We have many years worth of data that has not yet been analyzed beyond descriptive statistics.


With my annual review coming up, I am really hoping to be up for a promotion to senior research analyst. I feel like the work I've done is above and beyond and is setting us up to do more interesting work. All of this work will also facilitate data requests (we tend to get lots of last minute data requests from the higher ups)


When I started, we had 3 Senior Analysts, one was promoted and 2 left. There was a 4th who left the day I started. A lot of the programs I work on were her programs. So I don't think it would be... odd to add a Sr analyst to the team seeing as we don't have any right now. 


I've certainly made mistakes, typically typo's or forgetting to update values, data cleaning etc. However I've always made sure that I don't repeat the same mistake twice and I'm trying to move everything into R scripts to make things a bit easier and fool proof.


So my question is, is it reasonable to think that this level of work is worth a promotion? And if so, how would you recommend approaching this issue? (I have the description of a Research Analyst position, but I don't have a job description for a Sr. Analyst position)

Or does it matter?  I feel like I'd get more variety as a jr DBA kind of role since we're a small team and wear lots of hats anyway.  Is there anything I'd be missing by not taking a data analyst role when the opening comes up later this year?

A ""hackathon"" is an attempt to ideate and make progress toward solutions to shared challenges. Hack for the Sea is slightly different than many other hackathons in that:

* It focuses on marine science exclusively
* All submissions must be released as open source
* It is meant to be a healthy, inclusive, and outcome-driven event.

This year's challenges come from our beneficiary organizations: the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc. (CUAHSI), the Gloucester Marine Genomics Institute (GMGI), The Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife, Ocean Alliance, and the MassBays National Estuary Program.

1. How does a changing coastal watershed impact coastal waters?
2. Where and when will Cod spawning occur?
3. Can a whale be identified based on their blowholes?
4. Can a mooring be designed that is not only eelgrass-friendly, but also user-friendly?

One task I regularly complete as a data analyst is to review performance metrics and the first question I have when I see something change is why? 

Although there can be a lot of fundamental reasoning behind a shift in performance (e.g a strategy change) sometimes it can simply be due to a shift within a specific segment (e.g a specific country decides to convert 100%). 

Is there any mathematical method that I can run my outcome data through (split by segments in question) to find if a shift in any of the segments has caused the trend? 

I would only be interested in a change for a segment if it was significant in driving the trend (e.g the country that provides 1% of business changing from 50% to 100% conversion is irrelevant as it will not cause a significant shift in overall performance).

Appreciate PSI could be used for this but I am more concerned around a stable population and understanding if a shift for a specific segment has caused the overall trend.

If so how do I determine the relative strength of the feature I've removed?

I'm aware in the basic set up of a HMM, you can calculate the log likelihood by summing the final recursions of the forward algorithm over all the hidden states.

Does anyone have any idea if this result stays the same when you introduce a new set of latent variables that allow you to model the emission distribution as a mixture. In the graphical model, the mixture components have arrows coming from the hidden state, and going to X.

The model I'm thinking of can be found in this paper \(figure 4\) [https://www.cs.ubc.ca/\~carenini/PAPERS/ijcai11CR\-Joty.pdf](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~carenini/PAPERS/ijcai11CR-Joty.pdf)

I feel like these new latent variables don't affect the forward &amp; backward computations of alpha and beta at all. And in this case, I think the log likelihood can be calculated in the same way as without the mixture components. Is this correct?

All of these formulas really make the thing chug when I'm trying to filter things down, and I *know* there is a better way to manage a database.

I'm ready to learn SQL if I need to, but I wanted to run it by you guys in case you knew of something a little more turn-key. Here's ultimately what I need to do:

* Maintain multiple 200k+ record databases of names, addresses, and a few other bits of information
* Able to suppress or de-dupe records between databases, or using a separate ""Do Not Mail"" spreadsheet and other data hygiene
* Preferably able to pull data once filtered for dates, suppressed against the DNM, and able to track when the data was last used for a campaign
* Software or online SaaS would be fine

Ideally, I would love to just go to whatever this hypothetical thing would be that maintains this data, and then filter by a few categories, and be confident that the data is also clean based on a few other lists to suppress against. 

Bonus credit: An entirely separate project: We are in the beginning stages of looking into housing this data on a cloud server like Azure or AWS, simply because at a certain level, credit bureau data is required to be in a secure environment, which means firewalls/penetration testing/security patches and we are thinking much of that would be addressed by going offsite with the server.

As in I was bored to death, but in subjects that carried interest I surpassed all others.

I'm now 20 years old and began to learn in depth the more complicated aspects of [software.At](https://software.At) 13\-14 I spent a very large amount of time working in linux and building multiple Kali builds. I also began learning Java but didn't stick to it until going to a vocational school for software Development my last 2 years of highschool.

I learned the basics of Java so many times\(I would pick it up for a few weeks and forget about it, having to re\-learn it later\). By the time I was in my software class I was excelling beyond everyone in C#, within the first 6 months getting as many Certs as even the top people in the class had at the end of the 2 years we all spent there. Funny thing was I never paid attention in class and learned PHP while my teacher was teaching C#. So long story short, I am very good at programming, just didn't find my area of passion yet. I even had an Internship as a Web Developer \(mostly backend PHP\) my last year of highschool, reducing some of my bosses code from 60,000 lines to 112 in a day even.

Since then I've been working as a Helpdesk Tech due to the lack of PHP jobs in Ohio, and I really didn't like C# or [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET). I studied Cyber Security for awhile too. But then I found Machine Learning and Data Science and I'm absolutely in love with it. So first step is to get Calculus down and try not to kill myself in the process...

I'm more than willing to learn all the Calculus and Math stuff on my own. My issue is it seems that jobs for Data Science without a Degree are pretty much non\-existant. So basically I need advice on how I could manage to pull off getting into this area of IT without drowning myself in debt. Is me planning on getting into this field without a degree fantasy?

Most entities were only seen on 1 day but some were seen on 3-4 and  even 5 days.  The entries in the matrix are binary for whether the entity was collected on that day.

Using a throwaway for obvious purposes but this sub has really helped me identify which jobs I should apply to in order to pursue my desired career trajectory. I finally have a few offers for which I need final advice, based on the various backgrounds of people on this sub. Basically, here's what happened: Company A extended me an offer today and so I called Company B to let them know. Company B then told me they're prepared to exceed that salary.

My background: 24 y/o with a passion for data analytics, with a specific passion for exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and predictive analytics. Professional work experience is basically 14 months at a Big 4 being an analytics consultant. Moved abroad for a long distance relationship which didn't work out and now back in the US looking for a job.

I'll try to include as many relevant statistics as possible since we love numbers after all. Here's the rundown: 

Company A
- Role would be ""Data Analyst Consultant"", Salary $77,000
- Boutique IT Consulting Firm - size ~1000 employees
- City COL index: 100 - city also has a good cultural scene which is important to me
- Project I would be assigned to would involve data analytics but not sure if it would align with my specific interest for EDA, data visualization, and predictive analytics
- 4.0/5 glassdoor rating - 70% recommend to a friend
- I got a really good vibe from in-person interviews and the company has a very reputable company culture
- Would work with a lot of people my age
- Widespread recognition for work-life balance
- Negative reviews mentioned staff augmentation and dull work
- Offices around the country with a high chance I could relocate to one in the future if I chose to
- Good benefits and PTO 

Summary: extremely comfortable with the company culture and way they treat their employees, less comfortable with actual work I would do 

Company B
- Role would be ""Data Analyst"", basically asked me to name my price tag but said they are definitely prepared to exceed $77k for COL (any specific advice of what salary I should tell them?)
- City COL index: 150
- Boutique Data Analytics company - my direct client is an extremely well-known brand but heard the client can be a bit frustrating to work with at times
- Company size is ~200 employees
- Glassdoor rating: 3.9/5 (but very small sample size of reviews)
- I would either have to live really close to work in a soulless, bland, but modern area or commute at least 45 minutes each way every day
- Work I would be doing aligns almost perfectly with my passion for EDA and data visualization, with the opportunity to train in machine learning and predictive analytics
- Would work with only a few people my age, some much older
- Work is very high visibility, high impact - would even sometimes work on ad hoc requests from the CIO and possibly CEO
- A bit more high pressure work

Summary: passionate about the work I would do, still a bit weary of company culture(s) and how I would fit in 

Any advice on what I should do? Which company would help me the most as I pursue a career in data analytics?

I have an interest in the world of data science, even though a) I have almost no formal training in a quantitive field and b) I don't know a lot about data science.

In order to develop my quantitative skills incrementally and learn more about data science, I want a hobby project to work on that I hope would help me with this.

Here are some things about me:
- I have a business degree and did a year of statistics in university
- I'm currently doing a basic statistics course to reinforce the basics (and I'll probably continue doing 'basics learning' until I'm more comfortable with stats)
- I've done a bit of R, and know a lot of Ruby (but I can figure things out)
- I'm patient and in it for the long haul - I'm happy for this journey to take multiple years
- I appreciate the steep learning curve ahead of me

The prospective hobby project:
Currently, I work as a scrum master in a software company of 300 engineers that make a complex product. The company is organised into autonomous squads. Predictability of these squads is important because it allows us to make certain commitments to their customers. Squads work in fixed, two-week iterations (sprints). As people do the work, the work transitions through phases (""Open"" -&gt; ""In Development"" -&gt; ""Testing"" -&gt; ""Done""). Work is quantified using story points. What I want to know is: given specific conditions and an amount of work, how likely is it that a squad would be able to complete all its work inside one sprint?

My (meta)questions about this question to this sub:
- Is this a good approach to developing quantitative skills and learn about data science in the first place?

My questions about the hobby project to this sub:
- Is the question the hobby project aims to answer a good one?
- Apart from this sub, where can I find help if I need stuck?
- And finally, how do I start breaking down this problem and start designing a possible solution?",6,3,False,self,,,,,

I've been interested in the data science path since I started, primarily because I loved both math and programming. I've also strongly considered quantitative finance roles, but I'm somewhat reluctant to spend 4\-5 years doing a PhD.

Anyway, as part of my final year of college I did a 3 month placement/internship in the analytics department of a large sports betting company working on predictive models for sporting events. Before the internship started, I was very excited as I love sports so this seemed like a perfect crossover of my interests. Now, having finished it, I'm unsure whether I want to work in this field at all. As I've seen mentioned on this sub before, the vast majority of time seems to be spent on gathering/preparing/cleaning data. Once this is done, the entire process of fitting a model to the data is done by something like:

    import sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression
    import sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier
    
    logit = LogisticRegression()
    logit.fit(data)
    
    dt = DecisionTreeClassifier()
    dt.fit(data)

followed by comparing the ROC curves of the two models and see which performs better \(obviously the above is a slight oversimplification\). It seems to me like there is very little understanding of the underlying math/statistics required to do this, as all of the Python/R libraries seem to do the work for you.

Is this what most data science jobs are like?

I'm looking at data science as a possible career path, and I was wondering if there's a way to keep my love of HPC while doing so. I don't know much about data science (as you can probably tell!). I have had substantial statistics courses and programming experience, though. ",5,3,False,self,,,,,

&amp;nbsp;

I've been struggling a lot on wondering how I might use Data Science for ""Good"" uses to help other people. I haven't had a good life, like a lot people, but I've always wondered how I could help others in someway so I've been looking into a lot of majors. I looked at my passions and thought maybe Data Science might be something I'd like. I love reading books, programming, technology, and learning anything I can get my hands on. Currently I'm soon to be graduating without a Management Information Systems Bachelors of Science. 

**Questions:**
&amp;nbsp;

Am I right to think that Data Science has good applications to help people with? Would a non-profit even consider me if I was self-taught? I tried a MOOC called ""Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers"" it was really tough for me, so I'm starting off using Khan Academy to teach me Linear Algebra and hoping I'll ease into it easier. Can I be wasting my time in Data Science if I'm having a tough time in mathematics? Anyone have any other majors that I could look at that might help non-profits or people in some way? I thought of bioinformatics, but I was worried that I might be wasting time without having a biology degree. I know cybersecurity is going to grow a ton, but I don't know if non-profits would need me for that sort of work.

**Curriculum:**
&amp;nbsp;
Included is what everything I'm currently doing, I'm not sure if this a correct curriculum to learn Data Science or not so take it with your own risk. Hope it helps anyone that is trying to change their life around.

Looked around for old posts as well, this one was the most informative https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/89um5n/my_husband_is_a_data_scientist_and_is_burnt_out/

**My Situation:** I graduate in December and from that I was thinking of two paths, I could either go into a masters for Business Analytics or go into a Data Science Degree. My issue is my GPA is a 2.9 from my AvPD affecting my first two years of college and losing someone in those same two years. My last two years have been great with A's and B's, but I'm not sure if I'd be able to get into a good university though still will be trying my best. Going to be doing a lot of projects and hope that someone will see my passion. 

&amp;nbsp;

Another route I could go with is getting job experience from local non-profits if they think I'd be worth it with only a bachelors. From what I've been reading a lot of data scientists are masters or phd grads. I could do Data Analysis work for them, or something like Data Entry work and apply my self-taught education to that to get experience and help them out in anyway.

I did as much as I could and now I'm following some successful kernels more closely.

One thing I noticed done in a kernel was, before he does One Hot Encoding on some categorical features, he does a step of Label Encoding on other categorical features. That is, he maps one value to 0, the next to 1, and so on. The features he chooses to do this to are mostly ones that probably \*do\* have some ordinal ordering. For example, with ""XitchenQual"" \(kitchen quality\), the values ""Typical/Average"", ""Fair"", ""Good"", ""Excellent"" probably are ordered in their effect on the label, so it's not that weird to assign them values 0\-3. 

However, I noticed something strange in the code the guy uses to Label Encode them. He uses scikit learn's LabelEncode like so:

    for c in feats:
        lbl = LabelEncoder()
        lbl.fit(list(unskewed_df[c].values))
        print(""\n"",c,"": "")
        print(pd.unique(unskewed_df[c].values))
        print(lbl.transform(pd.unique(unskewed_df[c].values)))
        unskewed_df[c] = lbl.transform(list(unskewed_df[c].values))

the thing is, I'm pretty sure [LabelEncoder just does the mapping from labels to integers in a naive sorted order](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38749305/labelencoder-order-of-fit-for-a-pandas-df). As you can see in the link, that will often mean alphabetical order. I can see this from the print statements in the above code:

https://i.redd.it/5b1ad7mcigy01.png

where it's obviously in alphabetical order, not Po\-Fa\-Gd\-Ex or something. That feels wrong, because it's actually disrupting order/patterns where there actually are some.

Running this using my L1 linear regression model on this gives me these scores:

https://i.redd.it/52simvsqigy01.png

So, thinking that if they were actually in the right order, I added my own code, which first sorts the labels by their mean value, and then label encodes in that order. Here it is, sorry it's a little messy:

    label = ""SalePrice""
    for c in feats:
        catVar_df = copy(unskewed_df[[c]])
        catVar_df[label] = pd.Series(y_train_log)
        orderedMean = catVar_df.groupby(c).mean().sort_values(by=label)
        catOrder = orderedMean.iloc[:,0].index.tolist()
        
        catMap = dict(zip(catOrder,list(range(len(catOrder)))))
        print(""\n"",c,"": "")
        print(catOrder)
        print([catMap[val] for val in catOrder])
        unskewed_df[c] = unskewed_df[c].map(catMap)

Which gives a more reasonable mapping:

https://i.redd.it/is1fnp25jgy01.png

but, when I run it on the same exact model, a worse score!

https://i.redd.it/picyyfy6jgy01.png

This is really confusing to me because it feels like it should only be an improvement. As another piece of info, here are the same categorical feats that get mapped via his method \(""unordered""\):

I have done a kaggle based sentiment analysis by combining 3 datasets containing sentiment(good,bad), review (text), and source (Amazon,IMDB,Yelp). Using a Python's sklearn Pipeline with [CountVectorizer,TFidfTransformer,MultinomialNB] I am able to classify ~82% correctly. In order to improve this, I was hoping to split the reviews into their grammatical components to see if the extra dimension helps with classification. 

My problem is I can't figure out what structure it needs to be in to be a valid input variable for MultinomialNB(). With the normal classifier I would use CountVectorizer and TFidfTransformer to create a sparse matrix, but now I have 3 sparse matrices. How can that be used in MultinomialNB?",1,8,False,self,,,,,

I wanted to check in here with everyone to see if anyone would be able to share their insight or personal experiences with data science boot camps.

My background is in accounting (licensed CPA) and I've had a desire recently to transition my career towards a focus on data science (specifically predictive modeling/analytics). I'm somewhat familiar with the bootcamps that are out there and I've been considering applying for one in the future. That being said, what would be my best course of action in order to prep for such a boot camp given my background is in accounting? Currently, I've begun to teach myself Python and would also like to pick up on R and SQL, but is there anything else I should be focusing on that would preferable?

I use R and understand a lot of the intuition behind the different algorithms. I can also pause the tutorials I've seen and usually implement the algorithms on my own (using the video to check my work). My questions are two-fold. 

When you get a dataset, how do you go about engineering the features? I would imagine that datasets rarely contain the optimal columns. I've taken a few online courses and then data is all very clean or in easy formats. What is your workflow here? Some examples of your processes would be very useful  

After you have created a satisfactory model (let's just say in Python), what are your next steps? If this model is meant for internal use, would you just leave it as a Python script? Would you add a GUI allowing end users to import data files (i.e. CSVs)? Would you use a framework like Flask to create a web app? I haven't seen much about this stage of the process. 

I have implemented a few different machine learning algorithms to help answer business questions. I get that it can all be done in Python - which I like. To get more experience I am looking for way to use datasets from my work to help my team derive insights. Any of you in a non data science /ML role doing this?",4,10,False,self,,,,,

Third, I'm typing this at the bar, so please let me know if anything doesn't make sense and I'll try to clarify. 

Let's say I use a different approach like a neural network and it is able to achieve a similar prediction performance as my random forest. 

Would adding this prediction as a feature in my random forest increase performance? 

If so, at what minimum accuracy level would this feature need to achieve so that adding it would improve the performance of my random forest? 50%? 80%?

While I'm deciding I wanted to ask this sub their advice. My friend and mentor scoffed that it's not even a choice and that consulting is obviously the better choice.

With the consulting role I imagine there will be a lot of Excel and Powerpoint used to explain models fitted for inference (regression and decision treed maybe?). It sounds like I will do some modeling but that it won't take up most of my time, which will otherwise be spent in SQL, Excel and Power Point. Whereas, I believe that in the telecoms role the goal will primarily be prediction accuracy (Random forrest, XGB, Neural Nets?) working in something like R Studio all day.

I'm leaning towards telecoms because it sounds like I'll be working on models day in and day out in a true data science team. This will hopefully give me the chance to really dive in gain a deeper understanding statistical models and how to refine them.

Both jobs pay about the same.

My goal in this post is discussion. I feel like I'm trying to convince myself that the telecoms role is the better choice since it's more in line with my goal of gaining a deeper understanding of data science.

Iv been postponing this decision till the very end but Im currently enrolled in an Ba of Economics and Business Economics degree and have to choose between a Business Economics or Information Management specialisation. 

It might sound weird for an econ student, but Im really interested in data science and have learned myself R up to an advanced level and some basic python as well. 

I chose to pursue an Economics degree because I wasnt completely sure what direction I want to go in the future e.g. Business/finance or Data analytics, and due to the quantitative courses in my degree, Economics would give me enough freedom to specialise in any certain direction.

Now I have to opportunity to choose a specialisation programme in Information Management, although it focusses more on the macro and micro economic aspects behind IT development etc.  And the thing is that the pure econ subject doesnt really attract me. The information management part on the other hand does interest me.

On the opposite side I could choose to do a finance/accounting specialisation and take some extra classes on data analysis/stats to widen my portfolio.

I scraped a large set of Steam user info from their api which has userid, gameid, playtime_forever.  (How long they played.)  I am trying to build a recommendation system based on this data alone, and then expand it to be more sophisticated.  I've been trying to follow this tutorial https://cambridgespark.com/content/tutorials/implementing-your-own-recommender-systems-in-Python/index.html which uses movies and a very similar system, except the users actually rated the movies.


Heres where I differed. I do not have a rating, so I built a range of scores from 1-5 using 

    temp['rating'] = temp.groupby(['steamid']) 
   ['playtime_forever'].transform(
        lambda x: pd.qcut(x.rank(method='first'), 5, 
    labels=range(1,6), duplicates='drop'))


This splits each users games into the quantile they played the most. For example, if I played 10 games, 2 for 10 hours, 2 for 8 hours... 2 for 1 hour, I would have scores 5,5,4,4...1,1.  For my matrix, I only included the most popular 3000 games, and I kicked out any game the user never played.  (So the recommender would potentially recommend 'play the damn game you bought!')


My problem, as far as I can tell, is that my similarity matrix is over saturated with 0s and so **my recommendations tend to be the same for each user.**  An example of my item scores for 1 user looks like '0.00292245, 0.0029871 , 0.00305141, ..., 0.00292783, 0.00293196', which are basically the same number.



This is the code I'm now struggling with that is giving me those results (taken from the link)
from sklearn import cross_validation as cv
train_data, test_data = cv.train_test_split(df4, test_size=0.25)

train_data_matrix = np.zeros((n_users, n_items))

    train_data_matrix[line[1]-1, line[2]-1] = line[3]

from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import pairwise_distances
user_similarity = pairwise_distances(train_data_matrix, metric='cosine')
item_similarity = pairwise_distances(train_data_matrix.T, metric='cosine')

def predict(ratings, similarity, type='user'):
    if type == 'user':
        mean_user_rating = ratings.mean(axis=1)
        #You use np.newaxis so that mean_user_rating has same format as ratings
        ratings_diff = (ratings - mean_user_rating[:, np.newaxis])
        pred = mean_user_rating[:, np.newaxis] + similarity.dot(ratings_diff) / np.array([np.abs(similarity).sum(axis=1)]).T
    elif type == 'item':

    return pred

The team is composed by me and my two bosses, who give me directions of what I should do. I was hired to develop algorithmic trading systems to make money in markets. Sometimes I regret taking the decision of taking this job, here's why.

First of all, mostly because of some degree of naivety from me, I had no idea that writing models and trading strategies were so fucking hard. Admittedly, I accepted the job proposal without doing a Google search about the tasks I was going to be paid to do which now I see it was a big mistake. Not only I don't have a PhD degree but also I had no prior experience in Fimance before.

The other reasons are my bosses. They are very knowledgeable and successful at what they do for a living, which is also Finance but not stock market. However, they have almost zero knowledge of undergrad math and stats. They talk nonsense stuff like ""non linear correlation"" (which is itself rather contradictory), R squared for classification models, doing distribution analysis and finding patterns for less than 20 data points, and so on. They are clueless about pretty much all the aspects of the data pipeline process, from data gathering to fitting models. 

Not only that but they have something very common for C level executives: because of their (successful) business expertise and experience, they will be pleased with a model only if it follows something they believe is true. Otherwise, they won't even pay attention to it. I mean, If you come up with some model X and your boss suggests you do Y, if model X performs far better than Y, they won't give a shit about the results if X was built based on concepts in which they don't see any reason to works. 

On the other hand, they are pretty nice to me, to the point of sponsoring my participation in an expensive conference. They are pretty optimist about algo trading, the thing is they just don't have the humility to accept something that they don't believe is true nor do they have any idea of how fucking difficult is making money with machine learning in stock market with a team composed by only one guy.",7,0,False,self,,,,,

I applied at various resources including the current potential employers for Mobile app developer but circumstances changed and due to many some past academic work related to datascience \(Information Retrieval, Machine Learning\) I got the current job I explained in upcoming sections. The company is a startup but very promising indeed and the field I am in is business intelligence which will be business mind behind some industries. Therefore, we have access to their data in big chunks.

Moving to job, as startup; our team consists of primary electrical engineers who have just about skills to code and perform database operations. This is here, I play. I am CS major who has primary responsibility to store large amount of increasing data into databases. That's part one of job and it requires efficient schema design to fast processing of systems. We present clients information in amount of nano seconds to their queries through systems such as generating reports, paychecks for employees etc. I am totally new to the system and I will be passing through a probation period in which one of prior engineer in responsible will shift the complete job to me in one month of period of training. I feel confident here because I have done things very close to this task through out degree program.

The second part of job is to learn and perdict from data. This part is closely related to machine learning and statistics. I am good at algorithms and statistics. I have done basic machine learning in degree curriculum but I feel incomplete here. Even though, the training will uncover many of things I do not at the moment but apparent interview with person currently in charge tells me that he is also dark about this step which is why they have hired an CS graduate to do their job for them.

Third job responsibility is to present information to clients in meaningful ways such as graphs, charts, tables etc which is easiest part so far about the job. I have done these things and I am comfortable with doing these things in Python. 

Out of job requirements, some of things which are also available at my disposal are that the company is open to suggestions. They plan to use either Oracle DB servers or MS SQL servers for storing data into DBs. I have option to suggest things to them here. Also the data, according to them grows very rapidly, it is better to suggest them a scalable database schema design and potential database server. They're also not open towards using no relation databases or no databases at all for security and protection reasons.

Further more, they have given me complete choice in selection for a machine to be utlised for the job. I have a clue that considering I am going to work in potentially huge amount of data, I will be needing a good machine and I am thinking about Lenovo T470s. I want you to give me a good name here.

Last but not the least, the startup owns a MS Windows server for their current testings and store information in MS SQL DBs. I am more comfortable in using a Linux machine and therefore, should I ask them to switch to a Linux server and potentially switch MS SQL to Oracle server? Is it necessary? Will MS SQL server be compatible towards a Linux machine? I have not used such cross combination and I certainly do not fancy it.

Some background, I will be entering my final year of my bachelors in September and I'm majoring in both Finance and Statistics. I'm currently on an internship at a Big N company as a Data Scientist and I'm truly enjoying my time. However in the past I have completed internships at reputable Canadian Banks as an investment banking analyst. 
My dilemma is I really love the technical and exploratory work data science offers but also love the high tempo/pressure environment, possibility for large financial returns that IB offers. Is there any field or job that combines the work of these 2 careers into one so i can have the best of both. 
I know many of you will say to become a Quant, but tbh i have attempted to take some pure math courses at uni, such as real analysis and they were unfortunately beyond me and i don't think i have the intelligence to do a masters in financial mathematics. (ie. combines the research, problem solving from DS to the world of finance and IB)
I have one more internship left after this one and I believe I can get another Big Data/ML or IB position. Also I do have the marks and research experience so a masters is also an option post undergrad if its required.
If you read till here its very appreciated and any input you have on my problem would mean a lot to me.

Although I can ""do"" what a data scientist does, I don't know if what I want to do all day every day.  

For a long time now I have been doing computational statistics and data mining. There are many parts of the analytical process I really enjoy. That being said, I frequently find myself reflecting on everything else going on in the world. I often feel a sort of tension in my gut when I think about all the local problems in my community and the things everyone is engaging in while I sit in my lab coding and looking at my monitors. I think that feeling actually increases as I improve my skills in this area (which I find odd). After being offered a legit DS job I really started reflecting on it even more.

Do any of you currently, or perhaps do you know of a common way to, work in a more social role in the world of data science? I really don't know if I can sit at a desk or on my laptop for many, many years doing work which I really can't discuss with my friends and family beyond a surface level.

How do you guys determine what to work on next, or what projects to fight for? I'm trying to think through a list of things I consider:

* **Potential Upside In Dollars**: At first, usually a napkin CBA. I like to rank projects by this, and then start demoting them due to issues below. Sometimes this can be really tough for things that only improve internal processes. but I have found that when speaking to high level management, being able to attach even uncertain $ figures to stuff really, really helps. Even if it's as simple as getting max/min figures, like ""let's say we created an AI that replaced this entire department...this would only save us $300K a year"", or ""only 1% lift in this area, probably achievable by simple linear regression, would increase sales by $1M"".  
* **Level of Effort (To Our Team)**: Self explanatory. Worth considering if the project requires expertise that your team doesn't have, or will have to build as you go. 
* **Level of Effort (To IT/Other Teams)**: Does this project require deep cooperation from another business unit? Getting IT buy-in is a notorious struggle sometimes. 
* **Data Required**: Project killer. If the data isn't available or hasn't been collected appropriately, it might not get off the ground. 
* **Stakeholder Buy In**: Does whoever is in charge of the business unit that will be using your product actually want it? Even a really good idea with obvious upside can fail to succeed if a key individual in leadership resents being told what to do and drags their feet at every opportunity. 
* **Cool Factor**: Obviously more of a secondary concern, a good project would hopefully never be scrapped because it's boring. But the bottom line is sexy projects that can borrow some the ML/AI hype might have an easier time with some of the above issues. Worth thinking about. ",1,3,False,self,,,,,

Im brainstorming.  But, is there some type of index that measures actual dispersion?  I know there are index's back from college stats class that measure similar things like a Gini Index

Not to bore you with details, but I'm a PhD in bioinformatics, who (due to some blah-blah personal unrelated nonsense),

It has been ages since I've written a CV, and at best it was an academic CV full of bioinformatical and medical lingo.

I have a suspicion is that this CV kind of lacks substance, this from my point of view it is due to that all the substance I have in mind is very specialized and will obfuscate things rather than help a potential reader, but maybe you have any advice for me in this regard?

I know Python and R are the most popular.

I know SQL is VERY useful to know.

I know JavaScript and software such as Tableau are used to ""fancy up"" your visualizations before showing them to upper management.

But what's new? I am looking at GitHub / Stack Overflow popularity charts, seeing languages like Rust, Julia or Clojure and I have no clue whether it is worth learning any of those languages, and if so, which one?

Before someone comes and tells me that it is always good to learn new programming language - I guess I agree, it makes you a better programmer in general. But the problem with learning new things is that it takes time. I don't have much spare time in my life right now and definitely not for learning things that I will not find useful later on - in other words I don't have time for learning new programming languages just for the sake of it. That's why I am asking you for advice - to help me cherry pick the option that will be the most suitable for me.

I want to test for individual differences in response-time (RT) to the buttons, what's the best way to do this?

(remember there are differences in response time in-between the different colors).

So far I thought of:

1. ANOVA - calculate a general (weighted) mean RT and compare to individual people.
2. The distribution level: compare the mean distribution of RT to individual distributions using:
- chi-squared for goodness of fit
- KullbackLeibler divergence test
- KolmogorovSmirnov test

3. Find a cool bayesian way to do it (which?)
4. Use a mixed-effect regression model, and calculate the marginal contribution of the people (R square test).

please help me decide - what's the best practice here?

I'm in my fourth year as a System Admin/VoIP Engineer, (we wear a few hats on the this team) and my work is beginning to get relatively stagnant.

I recently had the opportunity to work with what my company calls a ""BI Developer,"" who primarily uses SQL/Python to parse/organize/manipulate data in a SSAS cube. I enjoyed the work immensely, and specifically enjoyed the 'marriage' of the coding/mathematics.

That being said, I feel like I've been at a standstill the last year and I decided to start exploring other options. So, I ended up here.

I've got a good deal of Python experience, as it and Powershell are what I use to automate a lot of my daily tasks. I'm relatively fluid in SQL, as I have been using it the last few years almost daily.

I have dabbled in Stats/Calc while in university, so I have a pretty okay background there. (Could probably use a refresher, but hey, better than nothing)

My question is: is it reasonable to think that I could make this switch?  If so, where should I begin?

I assumed I would start with Python, as I have some familiarity here, and R would be more to learn early on. I lurked here for a few weeks and purchased some books that were recommended. (Data Science from Scratch, Python for Data Analytics)

Do you have any advice for me, outside of my questions?

I work for a company that sends team members to customers' houses and like all the Grubhubs and Comcasts of the world, we'd like to be able to intelligently and accurately provide our customers with as small an estimated arrival window as possible. 

Unlike the above mentioned companies, I think our situation has a few unique challenges.

1) Customers frequently cancel/reschedule
2) Customer visits are frequently shuffled around between team member's queues/routes as the day progresses
3) The amount of time spent at each customer's house is highly variable and can depend on many factors.

With that in mind, our arrival-time prediction process has to account for:

1) travel time between customers
2) time spent onsite with each customer
3) variability introduce by customers cancelling or the visit being rerouted to a different teams members' queue

The first two are straight forward enough to predict on their own but I'm not sure how to account for variability within the overall process particularly since:
 
  1) any delays are cumulative (i.e. if team member is onsite longer than expected early in the day, their arrival at later stops on their route will also be delayed)
  2) arrival can be affected by the visit being moved to a different (shorter or longer) queue.

I've been interested in the data science field since last summer and have started taking it seriously this summer. I'm in the final year of my PhD \(chemical engineering\) and I'm trying to come up with a plan for what to do. My PhD is relatively un\-stressful \(atypical, but find yourself an australian adviser if you want this life\) so I have a decent amount of time to devote to this. Since my project is highly experimental, I have a decent amount of experience coding in matlab doing image processing but not much else.

I graduate Spring 2019 \(timing is flexible\). I'd like to self teach as much as I can and be a competitive applicant for the PhD fellowships that are offered by Insight and Data Incubator. My current plan is as follows:

1. Brush up on linear algebra and statistics by working through a couple of textbooks \(Intro to linear algebra, Intro to math statistics and applied predictive modeling\)
2. Learn Python and SQL and some of the data science toolkits using [pythonprogramming.net](https://pythonprogramming.net) and the new Python for Data Analysis textbook. I might start switching over to Python for doing some of my data analysis for my project, depending on how easy/hard it is to get going to familiarize myself with it.
3. Take a couple of machinelearning and data science courses on edx and coursera 
4. My wife is a Veterinarian with a really strong interest in public health so I think I'm going to come up with a project in this field with her help. It seems like it would be relatively high impact, interesting and if I succeed, impressive to interviewers 

Does anyone have any advice on other things I can do? From what I understand, you need to be part of the way there to being a data scientist by the time you apply for these programs and they really push you to get your foot in the door once you get into the program.

On Kaggle for example, there are a lot of exploratory kernels but I sometimes feel like they're not always that useful so what should I do and in what order?

For now, I'm going with something like :

1) What's my target like : classification, regression ?

2) Are my train and test data close, is 'train' a good prediction base for 'test'.

3) What kind of features am I dealing with? Ordinal, numerical, categorical?

4) Do I have missing values, do I delete them or fill them or ignore them?

5) Are my features correlated with my target and are some features highly correlated between one another?

Should I keep doing this or am I missing something?

Short bio: PhD in computational fluid dynamics, MS in computational plasma dynamics from a top ranked public U.  Prize post-doc at an Ivy League, currently a post-doc at NASA.  My work is mainly either 1) developing very large simulations or 2) using back of the envelope calculations to answer space science problems.  Extremely proficient at fortran and Matlab, moderate at python, slightly familiar with R.

I've been looking at a couple of job opportunities in the field, and I feel like I'd be very good at working in data analysis, but I feel deficient in a few categories: 

* application of statistics - I use some statistical analysis in my work, but I haven't trained formally in it, and because I'm usually working with model output, I haven't needed to use particularly advanced techniques.

* computer languages - im not familiar with SQL, Java, or machine learning algorithms, and these seem to be a first step to getting a job.

* business acumen - although I worked for a year in industry (biomedical) right after undergrad, I feel I'm lacking in a deep understanding of how problems are solved in the real world, as opposed to academia.

Recently I attended an info session for Galvanize, and I'm looking at programs such as Insight and Data Incubator.  One particular program that has caught my eye is Metis (their location/timing of sessions would be extremely convenient for me).

Are programs like this worth it for someone like me?  ~15k is a lot of money, but if its followed by a strong likelihood of getting a high paying job, I can see it being reasonable.

If you send Android, Tablet in France it will go to offer X etc. I assume they optimize for earning per view/click.

I wonder what the general workings of such algorithms are, and if there's a place (research papers, or books), I can learn more about this type of problem? I have a hard time finding anything directly related online, as it's not a very common problem in research papers, and a lot of the algorithms are being disclosed -- all though some mention using Bayesian statistics to optimize.

I started looking at multi-armed bandit problems, which I feel are very close to this type of problem. If you imagine the different offers are different ""bandits"", which bandit should you choose to maximize return. From this they can calculate a percentage weight per offer. Maybe initially they will all start at an even weight, and once there's enough data in the timespan, the weights will be shuffled (at a timed basis, i.e. every 30 min).

I just made this real quick rough draft and I usually use spreadsheets for drafts of idea before coding stuff. If I like and use this it I might code. I did it in Apple's Numbers because A\) I shamelessly love the simplicity and elegance of this app and B\) it allows for checkboxes and star ratings, which excel doesnt. If you dont have a Mac you can use it free on iCloud.com  


But anyway, it runs a cost benefit analysis on your tasks and then you get a nice weighted column of what you should work on first. I mean youd have to tweak it. The formula I used was Importance of Task  \(Duration in hours  Value of your time\) \+ Cost. You have to figure out what your time is worth. I think if you figure out your hourly rate at your job, thats a good number to use. In other words if you average $50 hour, you say If I werent doing this task that takes 1 hour, I could be making $50 

This is is also a good way to figure out if you should do a job yourself or outsource it. If it takes you an hour to cut your lawn but you can get some neighborhood kid to do it for $20, its a better use of your resources to outsource it.

The professor/researcher I'm working with asked if there's a way to ensure that there is enough variance between the two datasets to ensure good quality correlation values between the two sets (since windows with little variance can be correlated well at many different shifts). I wasn't sure of a way to do this, so I'm curious what the best way to do this is.

I'm also curious if you guys know of any other techniques to use ensure quality correlation and shift values for the windows.

Here's a longer write-up of the program:

Given two datasets of two years worth of data each:

1. Select the first 24-hour window for each dataset
2. Skip the window if it contains &gt;25% NaN
3. Resample the windows to 1-minute data (previously 15-second and 30-second data)
4. For a range (initially -100 minutes to 100 minutes) calculate the correlation, save correlation and shift to arrays, then move on to the next value in the range
5. Select the highest correlation and its associated shift
6. Resample the data into 30-minute windows (requirement according to researcher/prof. I'm working with)
7. Re-calculate the correlation at the best shift with the 30-minute window
8. Set the bounds in 4 to the (shift - 10 minutes) and (the shift + 10 minutes)
9. Output the new correlation and the shift and continue

The data is from two spacecraft at a distance known only to be within a range. Since we're looking at the data from both, we need to match up the data in windows with a shift since the data recorded from one spacecraft is delayed respective to the other.

My undergrad will be in civil engineering with a focus on water resource management.

Ive been working at an engineering consulting firm part time for almost 6 months and am going full time this summer. The team I am on builds custom data solutions for clients such as decision support systems for energy management. My role has been primarily predictive data analytics, database management. The predictive data analytics has been mostly classical machine learning methods and we are currently trying to add a variety of deep learning techniques to our toolset. All work I do is in sql, python, and C#. All machine learning has been self-taught through online tutorials or on the job.

This is the vein of work I would like to do with my career. Data driven solutions to civil engineering/water resource problems. What I want peoples opinion on is the direct path forward. Is this enough education to do what I want? Should I go with a masters in engineering? Should I go with a masters in something data science related like applied statistics or stochastics modeling?

Predicting exactly how much each segment of consumers will pay based on historical data so that we can calculate an uplift.

The current method is as follows : Split up consumers into segments, average their percent liquidation for each month of payment and assignment, and that is what you would expect to continue collecting with no interference.

I've been trying to wrap my head around how this method could possibly be improved, if at all possible. When I do a 70/30 training/test split, I get a 35% MSE on liquidation which is quite large (liquidation being 0-100% and the average consumer liquidates somewhere around 50). I have a hard time understanding how reliable this could be if it is that un-accurate.

However, given that I am predicting liquidation for 10s of thousands of people, I'm guessing that MSE will average out to 0? Or am I missing something.

The company has built a very successful business so obviously they are doing something right. I'm just lost as to how I can improve the forecast, if that is at all possible. I'm testing regressions, decision trees and random forests in order to inform my segmentation decisions, but still coming up with a large MSE of ~30% when I try and predict my test sets.

Do I just accept that financial analysis will always have large errors? I'm kind of stuck in my understanding here.

I understand that this is more of a career-specific post but I hope this will cover questions for who are in similar shoes as well.

A bit about me: Currently a rising senior at a liberal arts college majoring in CS. International student, no tech internships but couple business internships (consulting/finance). Some experience with Python and R, math up to linear algebra. Have taken basic stats couses. Have done couple DS projects for class. No experience with ML.


I am hoping to land a full time job in DS, but I feel that there are limitations for entry level jobs. A few of my friends whove pursued DS have found themselves in DS team of big tech company, tech startup, and business analytics companies, but most went out of luck.

Given my background and lack of expertise, what and how should I be preparing to get a DS job? I originally had an internship for this summer which got cancelled lat minute due to company circimstanes, meaning I have a free summer as of rn. 

Any advice will be helpful. Thanks.

I have Ph.D. in Cognitive/Human Factors Psychology and have a fairly strong background in experimental design, statistics, and modeling, but a weak background in programming.  

I wrote Visual Basic scripts for all of my experiments and was considered a ""good"" programmer for my department, but that isn't saying much. I would need to learn the more widely used languages in DS, but that doesn't scare me as much as I'm sure it would a future employer.  

My stats background is much better, I was fortunate to have good stats professors that valued theoretical understanding of data analysis, so I know not just what tests to run but why and the potential pitfalls. A lot of my Ph.D. work involved signal-detection theory and used nonlinear regression, MDS, PAC, non-parametric tests, etc. My SAS and Matlab knowledge is average, but I'm proficient with SPSS. I'm familiar with ML, but not versed in it (it was never a focus, though my research was largely in Human-Computer Interaction).  

I did a search for similar topics on this sub and unlike most of those posters, I'm not fresh out of grad school, which adds another twist. I've been working as a consultant at an engineering firm for about 4 years. Most of my job is to identify the causal human factors involved in accidents and provide expert testimony. I really don't do any programming nor do I really use statistics in this job, but it has improved my soft skills (project management, writing, dealing with tight deadlines, working on interdisciplinary teams, managing and supervising, client presentations, communication skills).  

So my questions really are... what sort of position might value my experience and background? Is there any type of topics, areas, or keywords I should be looking for (or should stay away from)?  I've been doing a ton of reading on crash courses, bootcamps, etc, and my fear is that if I will waste my time on topics which shouldn't be my focus. For example, I don't want to learn 5 programming languages if the end result is me trying (and failing) to sell myself as a faux computer scientist. I'd like to try and emphasize my strengths while using my time and energy to fill holes.

I've read probably the top 10 links on google for ensemble stacking, but I'm still a little shaky. It feels like they always kind of gloss over how you're supposed to separate the CV/train data for the different models, and then actually use the results of the lower level models.

I graduated with an ATAR of 79.70 (I would round to 80 but I have to be exact) and I have been shopping around courses that I would look to undertake that seem of interest to me (e.g. computer related courses). I was hoping someone here from Australia (doesn't have to be) would be able to answer my questions about the Data Science field and what I could do to get started in it! 

1. Does prestige matter when it comes to Data Science? The university I am planning to go into is a top 10 university in the country and top 250 in the world but not a 'Go8' university (Australian equivalent to US ivy league schools).  

2. I'm planning to do a Bachelor of Computer Science (with a major in Data Science) with a Bachelor of Mathematics (with a major in Statistics). Would this double degree open doors for me in the Data Science but also open doors for me in other fields in Software Development &amp; Cyber Security? (I ask this because the Data science field in Australia is small and considered niche; just want to keep my doors open). 

3. I'm not necessarily a math whiz but I am willing to put the effort in, I read a lot about how mathematics and computers is sort of meant to be 'natural' to people at a young age but I was sort of a oblivious kid and just played sports and did my homework, never really cared too much until later on in my high school life about academia. If I am willing to put in the extra effort and really give it a go, am I able to do well in this field? 

4. I have around 8-9 months before university begins, if you were in my position what would you do in those eight-nine months to give yourself a good start in Data Science? Outside of work, playing games with friends and going to the gym, I am going to have a lot of free time; like a lot, so I want to use it productively.

I switched careers a few years back into the tech realm. I have a master's in mathematics and have always been interested in operations research and data, specifically how data can be used to help businesses be more efficient and reach their goals.

In the past few years I have done a number of small intro things on Kaggle, gotten my feet wet on Machine Learning, learned SQL and Python (I'd say I'm capable but not an expert, I still have to read docs sometimes, but I definitely understand programming logic in a number of languages), and landed a job as a research analyst for an economic development agency.

My current job has me looking into public data sources for information but things are very low-key/reactive. Grab some economic/demographic data and share the numbers is the gist. 

I guess what I'm looking for from others here are what advice can you give someone newer in the field that they could be doing to ensure they're getting the most out of their time? I switched careers in my mid-20s and feel a little late to the game and want to ""catch up,"" so to speak.

Blogs or other information (tutorials/videos/podcasts) that interest you that would be cool to put on my radar?

I've looked through other information - there's an abundance now as this seems to be a hot topic field - but I am a person that learns best from hands-on training/conversations.

I am seeking advice on what would be the best role for my skill set and interests, as well as what to study next and any other suggestions to enter the field.

My background: I am an MBA holder with approximately 10 years of experience in general business, including finance, marketing, project management, leadership and teamwork, etc. I have worked in a few industries but the majority of my experience is in insurance, finance, and healthcare. I am currently working in property-casualty insurance. I consider my business, interpersonal, project management and communication skills to be rock-solid and genuine strengths. I have worked with lots of data, but from the decision-maker side rather than the DS/DA side. 

I feel comfortable with the big-picture, conceptual elements of DS, traditional desktop software such as spreadsheets, and traditional relational databases including variants of SQL. I have had quite a few statistics courses and feel fully comfortable with statistical principles and procedures.

I love the visualization and presentation aspects, and the whole idea of telling a story with the data to help improve the business. I would love to be able to expand my skills so I can make beautiful visualizations (that are also useful, clear and accurate, of course!) In general, making my work beautiful, polished, and well presented is one of my biggest strengths in my work, educational, and life experience.

I am currently working on my skills in Python, R, and GIS technologies such as the Esri products, since I am particularly interested in the various applications of location-based data (I don't have to find a job working with GIS-type data, it's just a personal interest.) It's not in my budget right now to pursue any additional degrees, so I am self-studying with online tools like Lynda.com, Pluralsight, and DataCamp. (I have not paid for any of the above yet, I have access as part of the alumni benefits of the school where I received the MBA.) I consider my Python and R skills to be ""advanced beginner"" to ""intermediate."" I have the fundamentals down, but have not yet explored things like machine learning. I know the basics of Git and the command line. I have not yet worked with SAS or Java. (I am a bit surprised how many job postings require SAS knowledge, as I was under the impression that Python and R were more important skills.) I know a little about NoSQL databases, but have not yet worked ""hands-on"" with any. I know what Hadoop, the AWS, and Azure are, but have not yet worked with them. I've studied compliance issues (including the GDPR) via online videos. I have a minimal acquaintance with JavaScript, PHP, HTML and XML but have not focused on these topics too much. 

My ultimate goal is a well-paying job (90K+) that uses my existing skill sets and the new skills I am developing. The exact role and industry can vary, but it is absolutely critical that any position I take is fully remote. (I have worked remotely throughout my career, so I do have documented experience with self-management, etc. and with using VPNs and remote collaboration tools). Will requiring a remote position be an issue in this field? If so, I may reevaluate my goal because that is my top priority.

Would I be able to enter a DS role once I develop my skills further? Or am I a better fit for a DA or BI role?

If my demographics matter at all, I'm female, on the young side, rural, southern US. I was a first-generation college graduate.

I'm pretty stuck on what to do, and I want to get this project finished ASAP.

I'm working on a project involving looking at windows of two data sets and, by shifting the one of the windows relative to the other, finding both the best correlation value and its associated shift.

The professor/researcher I'm working with asked if there's a way to ensure that there is enough variance between the two datasets to ensure good quality correlation values between the two sets (since windows with little variance can be correlated well at many different shifts). I wasn't sure of a way to do this, so I'm curious what the best way to do this is.

I'm also curious if you guys know of any other techniques to use ensure quality correlation and shift values for the windows.

Here's a longer write-up of the program:

Given two datasets of two years worth of data each:

1. Select the first 24-hour window for each dataset
2. Skip the window if it contains &gt;25% NaN
3. Resample the windows to 1-minute data (previously 15-second and 30-second data)
4. For a range (initially -100 minutes to 100 minutes) calculate the correlation, save correlation and shift to arrays, then move on to the next value in the range
5. Select the highest correlation and its associated shift
6. Resample the data into 30-minute windows (requirement according to researcher/prof. I'm working with)
7. Re-calculate the correlation at the best shift with the 30-minute window
8. Set the bounds in 4 to the (shift - 10 minutes) and (the shift + 10 minutes)
9. Output the new correlation and the shift
10. Repeat step one for a window shifted over 30 minutes

The data is from two spacecraft at a distance known only to be within a range. Since we're looking at the data from both, we need to match up the data in windows with a shift since the data recorded from one spacecraft is delayed respective to the other.

With the massive amounts of data, it's looking like the entire analysis will take ~5 hours (which I guess isn't too bad), but I'm hoping there are other ways to speed it up. I was originally doing each window calculation for the entire -100 minutes to +100 minutes range, but then I realized that the shift from window to window should be under 10 minutes difference compared to the prior window, so I can set bounds and not have to calculate unnecessary shifts (if that makes sense). It also ensures the shifts to be close to each other, since I was having issues with a few windows having drastically different shifts.

I hope that all makes sense! I'm 99% done with the program, it just needs some minor polishing like this, imo.",2,2,False,self,,,,,

I know most of you data scientists are very busy but I need a little help from an expert.  

I'm looking to understand our reality a little better, and am fascinated by the language of mathematics everywhere in our universe.

The pyramids of Giza are loaded with mathematical information about our world (and the moon) that are universal in language and all encoded into a relatively simple structure.

So I started thinking if there was some sort of mathematical information or message from a ""higher power"", if there even is such a thing, it would be encoded into something similar.  Something that we can see clearly and that stands the test of time, and is universal in language.


The ""visible to the naked eye"" stars on earth seem like the perfect medium for this, as they are a collection of points on an x,y,z plot with a fourth attribute being the magnitude of intensity.

I can't find much info online about a ""visible to the naked eye"" plot of stars with mathematical relationships to each other, so I decided to plot it myself and maybe run some calculations (is machine learning applicable here?).

I don't know the best software to do this, but I've found a great csv file here http://www.astronexus.com/hyg that seemingly has the right data.  Stars visible on earth are a max of 6.5 intensity and the farthest star visible is just a hair under 5000 parsecs, which puts the total points in under 10,000.  10,000 points with 4 dimensions of information seems like it could hold a ton of information encoded into it, and as far as I'm aware, nobody has cracked this code *if it exists at all*.

So maybe someone out there is filled with the childlike wonder that I have and is interested in taking a crack at it or steering me in the right direction, any input is appreciated!

My employer has a tuition assistance program that pays up to $6k a year towards tuition/books/learning material/conferences and I was going to apply for a hybrid or full\-online program next year, but wanted to take some courses beforehand to really strengthen my skills before jumping in headfirst \(background in Applied Physics, lots of python, work uses mostly IDL and MatLab, looking for either MatLab or Python heavy program\). My boss suggested I take courses at a institution towards a graduate certificate or sign up at the university as a non\-degree pursuing student so that the credits could still theoretically apply towards the degree later on. Was going to do an analytics certificate program from UCSC's silicon valley campus but want to look at all my options first. Any suggestions? Really looking into programs that are either evening courses or all online. Also open to online certificate programs to get me up to par with M.S. programs but not sure where to start since I think $6k for this year might be my limiting factor. 

Looking for a program that's more for application in science, statistics heavy, not so much business decision heavy. Data manipulation and data visualization preferred. 

I'm near the Silicon Valley so am open to hybrid programs \(half\-online, half\-inperson\)  


Any suggestions? Should I start with Udacity then apply for the program next year?  My only problem with some of the certificate programs is that they may not translate to graduate credits but I'm fine with that as well. The UCI program seems pretty attractive for it's price and the courses it is offering.   


Programs I'm considering \(but some are way too expensive\):

Sorry if it's not this one.

So I'm a data analyst, not a data scientist. I just finished grad school (not data science) and I'm between jobs, so I've been taking the last few weeks to go through Datacamp's material fairly intensely (~4 hours a day) and upgrade my skills before I get my hopes and dreams crushed by the job market.

...


The **first** thing I noticed about Datacamp was that they did a lot of stuff *for* me. I'd open up an exercise and most of the code had been written already, with a couple of spaces with '____' where I should fill in the right answer. I thought this was really frustrating, because there was never any point in the process where they explained to me why we needed to perform whatever operation it was. I'm like 50 hours in, and I'm not sure I could do any of this without Datacamp's prompting. I think this is the worst part of the Datacamp curriculum. I feel that I'm paying Datacamp to teach me Python syntax and when to use it (not just how to use it), and I feel like I'm not learning either of those things.

**Second,** although Datacamp courses offer video segments that putatively ""teach"" the course, the exercises were essentially big text boxes. Oftentimes the video and text would be somewhat out of sync, and sometimes it felt like entire sections had been omitted between text and video. This made watching the videos almost completely optional, and considering most of them are shorter than 5 min, there was never enough time to substantively introduce the material anyway.

**Third**, the material almost never feels practical. There are some nice real-world datasets used, but because of what I describe in my first paragraph, it's hard to actually interface with them. You're not really working with them yourself. Beyond that, it doesn't feel like Datacamp spends a lot of time trying to motivate the problem. Why do we need to take this approach, etc. There are often domain-specific considerations that influence how the problem may best be solved, and that stuff is completely omitted. This ends up meaning that these supposedly practical exercises end up anything but.

I had a really long paragraph here about how **I dislike their two-part statistics course**. TL;DR: I thought the treatment of linear regression was really shallow and incomplete (there's no mention of residuals at all, for example), and I thought leaving out multiple and logistic regression meant it didn't provide enough for students to actually learn how to work with data. I've never worked as a data scientist, but I understand that those two are important. They're already super useful as an analyst.

**That's not to say that Datacamp is terrible.** I really liked some of the data viz stuff they've got (Seaborn and Bokeh are awesome), and I think their first couple of intro to Python courses are helpful. I've heard great things about their R courses, as well. And Datacamp has got a great platform for what they're doing.

I'm certainly going to finish my month of Datacamp, but I don't think I'll be resubscribing. I know it's kind of a cheap shot, but I feel like I might subscribe to one of their competitor products in the hope that they can teach me more of the thought process behind this stuff.",45,126,False,self,,,,,

I'm currently organizing a ""hackathon"" on my university in Ecuador. Currently, there are two categories which are data analysis and prototyping. The data is given by a private company. I don't want to use the word ""hackathon"" since it have a negative connotation for beginners or non-coders and we don't want that. While data can be analyzed with code, not all people know how to but they know other tools. Prototyping is the same (based on the data we give) since you can use tools for the data's nature.

The President of Basketball Operations of the 76er's is Bryan Colangelo and he has been using burner accounts to spar with the media. The article is fascinating and deserves a read, but here's the relevant part:

&gt;**The Source**  
&gt;  
&gt;Our source, whose identity is still unknown, contacted me via anonymous egg accounts on both Instagram and Twitter, claiming that they had a scoop. The source explained that they worked in artificial intelligence and, after noticing a bunch of weird tweets directed at Sixers writers, used an open\-source data analysis tool to link five accounts through commonalities including similarities in who the accounts followed and linguistic quirks.  
&gt;  
&gt;They all have a pattern of likes, follows, and tweets which are EXTRAORDINARILY similar, the source wrote in a direct message on Twitter. For example, the source explained, all five follow accounts tied to Sixers players, members of the Philly front office, and beat reporters who cover the team; Toronto Raptors writers; Canadian high school basketball; and University of Chicago basketball. They discuss the same topics, use strikingly similar phrasing, and, at times, have tweeted out identical media images. Some of those shared attributes were odd, such as a distaste for beards and unknown sources. According to the sources findings, the three newest accounts followed 75 accounts in commonroughly half of their total respective followswith another 52 accounts followed by two of the three. \(*The Ringer* was unable to verify those numbers, but they seem to track with our analysis.\)

-C++ and Java courses up to Data Structures and Algorithms
-Big Data and Databases
-C language under Unix

I will be required to take a Software engineering course and two other courses in the next year. I would like my decision on which starting job to pursue to inform my decision.

My goal is to land a decent job once I graduate. I go to a solid university, but I dont have any projects or internships to show for it. Given my current situation, I want to commit myself to a plan so that I can spend a lot of time making progress by practicing and creating projects. The problem is Im not sure if I should commit to software development or data science.

Data science sounds interesting to me, but I dont know anything about machine learning yet. So far, I only know SQL, a little NOSQL, JDBC. I dont know R, Python, and I havent taken a statistics course since high school.

Part of me thinks I should pursue software because of my current skill set and knowledge base. ALSO, I like the idea of being able to free lance as well so that is a big plus.

About me: MIS major with my electives concentrated in information security. 3 courses left to graduates.

I was hired by my college as a data analyst scientist for the next 3 months to work on our fundraisers database. The fundraising department works with alumni, donors, students in order to collect and organize data sets on gifts, pledges, prospects, etc.

The issues I've seen within 4 days of being here and speaking are as follows:

1\) The data isn't very good. This is due to a myriad of reasons, the foremost being that when people leave college they don't update their contact/work info on surveys. Career services needs that data to show the ratio of people that end up in their field of study in queries/fundraising needs that information to better organize prospects as well as contact them. 

2\)The system is limited. My college has a campus wide enterprise system. The actual backend is done by the vendor. This limits how many forms we can have. With a limited system the categorization has to be accurate and useful. Currently the categorization of certain attributes each form is fairly spread out 

ex.

Job cat 1\-Ceo/vp/manager/entry level/account executive/executive accountant/ciso/cio

job cat 2\-owner/partner

job category 3\-retired/not retired

job category 4\-open for now, possibly tie with industry.

The reason I'm posting on here is to get a recommendation or two from professionals in the field. Should I focus on something like making the data catagories in certain fields more accurate \(currently our job category 4 slot is open and we were thinking industry code\), or possibly come up with some useful manipulation of forms that would work better than the current layout? 3 months isn't a long time and I'm trying to do something that makes a difference in the department but also keep it in the realm of possibilities with the time constriction.

I did get a good sense of what the different algorithms do \(NB, SVM, Random Forest, K Means etc.\) but I was wondering what the process usually is once you have fine tuned a model. What is the typical way to take it into production \(as in use it on a day to day basis in a business context\)? I assume it would totally differ based on what the problem is, what the industry is and so on but I am just looking for some examples. TIA",11,5,False,self,,,,,

I am a Masters student specialising in Data Science, and I need help in setting my salary expectations and evaluating offers made to me. 

Prior to my Masters, I was working as a data analyst - my experience comes with loads of SQL, Excel, VBA, Tableau, a little bit of R (for data cleaning), one clustering project in SAS, and of course, Powerpoint. The clustering project was more of a 'we have this data - just apply this technique', and it motivated me to get into learning what techniques are out there, and when and how to use which, which is why I wanted to do a Masters. Right now I'm looking for jobs and evaluating the job scene.
 
The role I am evaluating is in a data science R&amp;D role in financial services, and I think I like the role, and one of the projects I would look forward to is fraud detection. There are many pros and cons apart from this aspect, to be weighed in this picture.

I want help in setting my salary expectations right. So, the company thinks that I should be paid the same as a graduate from my course. I don't really have a problem being paid as much as a guy whose contribution would be the same.

So my question sort of boils down to: If I am a data analyst transitioning into a data scientist role, equipped with a Masters, am I differently placed w.r.t the role/ will I be able to bring to the table something different when compared to peers with 0 experience/ experience in development/ banking.
What I think from the top of my head is that I would bring to the table differently are:

- Familiarity with the nuances of working with real-world dirty data 
- Presentation to technical and non-technical audience 
- Translating data science to valuable information 

But I could be wrong in expecting that these are not exceptionally value-adding skills, and that's why I am looking for your views on this.

I am at an obscure location, and quoting my salary range wouldn't help here.",3,1,False,self,,,,,

my current job title is completely irrevelent to what i do at work and getting promoted. and given flexibility to name my title at my company.

It would be a manager position, managing two data analyst.  

Im not really getting a paybump, since its basically my same position, but they are letting me define my job title and responsibilities.

I think this is going to set me up nicely to  switch companies lol. and get the pay increase. 

Would "" Manager, Customer Segmentation"" be marketeable for data science careers paticularly focused in marketing/sales anlaytics? or should i position it more data science oriented",4,1,False,self,,,,,
