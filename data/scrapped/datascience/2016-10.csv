I'm looking for data science internships, and have a few places on my shortlist ready. I have a resume that I personally believe is very compelling for a data science internship, but I would like some feedback from you guys. Advice would be great, but also just 'chancing' me for something like an internship (saying, would you give me an interview based off of my resume) kind of thing.

The bulk of the data includes time labeled updates to customer contract data (change of address, etc.) and CRM data describing sales agent activity with the customer (when contacted, reason of contact, etc). The goal is to do churn prediction to analyze what customers are most likely to end their contract within a specified time window.

I have read many papers on churn prediction, but none seem to address how to do aggregate feature engineering on this kind of rare event, sequential data. The current plan is to do linear regression and/or survival analysis to assign probabilies to each customer for the predicted outcome of cancelling within a specified window. In order to employ these methods, the transaction data needs to be aggregated to reduce down to a single row for each contract.

Intuitively, I feel that there is useful information in the sequence of transactions for each customer. I don't know how to best translate this information into a single feature, or set of features however. I am currently using for example counts of each event state, for example how many times they changed address, phone number, etc. I am also aggregating the gaps in days between certain transitions.

In your experience is this adequate? I understand that feature engineering is an art, but is their any de facto standard to create features for data of this nature?

Any advise is appreciated, thanks",3,5,False,self,,,,,

Ok. Full disclosure:

I am taking a Data Science course in my grad school and am looking for ideas for my capstone Project. Should take around 2-3 months to execute for a team size of 3.

I am looking for something beyond a Kaggle dataset or something that hasn't been done 500 times before - like who will win the next Presidential elections, yelp dataset, netflix challenge etc. 

So, the reason why I am making this post is that if you have some idea in mind..something cool that you think could be addressed by doing some data analysis, then me and my team will do it and post the results back here after a span of 3 months. 

Currently I have a few ideas in mind. But I am looking for something better.

My ideas:

1. Scrape IMDB and do some prediction about movies like its box office gross
2. Analyze Wiki Leaks data and predict rise and fall of governments. (Not sure if it is possible and data cleaning will be extremely difficult given its size)

So, if you have better ideas, then I am all ears :)

(long post)",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/56k10w/im_in_a_computational_science_phd_program_but_i/,xRedactedx,1475975303,"TL;DR: I'm in a Computational Science PhD program, and I don't feel like I am learning enough data science material. Transferring is not an option. I would rather stay in the program and learn it now. Looking for advice on how I should proceed.


I really don't have anyone else to discuss this with, so I was hoping this community might offer some insights or suggestions. Sorry for the long post.


I'm working toward a Computational Science PhD, but I don't seem to be learning much data science material. To begin, after I finished my undergraduate degree in Computer Science, I took the Coursera Machine Learning course, and decided that was the type of stuff I wanted to work with. I did well in my undergraduate, so I had an advisor willing to provide an assistantship. The program is small, but I was led to believe I would be able to continue learning in that direction. To make a long story short, I finished with a Masters in Computer Science under this advisor. During the Masters, I took a few of the normal Computer Science Master level classes (in other words, nothing really data science related) and worked on research. The research was mostly into Q-Learning, Markov Decision Processess, and Robotics. I was told that I would be able to learn more about machine learning to improve upon what I learned in the Coursera course, but it never seemed to happen. I don't really consider the Q-Learning and MDP's machine learning, but my advisor seemed to suggest I had learned a good bit in that time.


So, I was talked into continuing working with this advisor for a PhD in the Computational Science program. After this semester I will have completed my first year. So far, the only relevant things I have learned was a Data Analysis Techniques class. During this class, we covered Radial Basis Functions, and well that was pretty much it. We did 5 homework assisgnments on Radial Basis Functions, and there were maybe 2 classes where other topics were briefly discussed during a lecture. In my research, we used a neural network for a project, but still haven't got the project working correctly. We are also using one in a current project, but it isn't working yet either. So, my entire 5 semesters and 2 summers of graduate school (including Master's and current PhD), I have learned about radial basis functions, and got some minor experience working with neural networks. I feel like I'm wasting my time.


The next class I am scheduled to take is their machine learning class which approximately 75% will be a rehash of the Coursera course. I really don't mind that too much since I went over that long ago, haven't really used it, and have probably forgotten many details.


The only other class they offer is Data Visulization. I don't have much information on this class, but given everything else, I don't hold high hopes. It will probably be close to my last semester before I am able to take this course. They only offer one course a semester and they rotate them.


So, I have spent much of time up until now thinking I was somehow making progress. Recently, I came across a blog where someone was talking about their Kaggle submission to the Titanic problem (I don't want to link to it, don't want to break any rules or anything). They were stepping through and looking at the training data, making graphs, deciding what features to use, and many other things. I knew that for example that you need to have good inputs for your machine learning algorithms, but I didn't realize how much technique there was that could go into it. 


That got me to thinking about how much I am actually learning here. I told my advisor I was having second thoughts about the program. I explained I didn't think I was progressing to the places that I should be. He basically told me that I got everything I really needed from the Coursera Machine Learning course, and that all I really needed to do was to practice. I'm not really buying that. If I had just sat down and started working practice problems, I probably would have solved some, but I never would have solved them in a way that the Titatnic problem was solved. I wouldn't have been able to explain features, how they were related, which ones were good, etc. I would have just looked at them, plugged in what I thought was good, and maybe randomly try switching some in and out for better results. I don't think this is the correct way to go about it. I want to be good at what I do. I don't want to just make something work. He also asked me what other topics did I think I needed to learn. I really didn't have an answer at the time, so I let the conversation drop.


Since then, I started looking into studying on my own. It was hard to come up with a study plan without much knowledge of the topics, but I ended up gravitating towards many of the MOOCs for examples. Specifically, I was looking at Coursera's Data Science specilization from John Hopskins. It looked like things were laid out in an easy to follow path. So, now I believe the answer to his question of what topics do I need to learn are the type of topics discussed in this course (There may be a more complete list of topics somewhere, or this might not be the best track, but it was organized, and I felt like it would give me a start at answering his questions). So, I feel like the answer to what I should be studying is topics like how to clean data, exploratory data analysis, and data visulization (which isnt a title of a class in the course, but I believe its covered in there somewhere). I believe the first two should have been covered in my Data Analysis Techniques class, but it wasn't. No one has ever mentioned anything like that to me. Data Visulization is a course they offer, but honestly, I don't have much faith it will prepare me.


So, I'm not sure where to go from here. I've invested all this time and work in the graduate program. I hate to drop out, but I do have a Master in Computer Science. Also, if I drop out, I am not prepared to take a data science job. I would be forced to get a job using my Master in Computer Science degree, and try to find the time to learn on my own and transition to data science early at the start of my career. So, my other option is to stay and somehow try to be sure I learn this stuff sufficiently, but I don't seem to have much guidance in the program. I'm really at a loss of what to do. I'm in far too much debt to leave the program and try to start up again somewhere else, so I don't feel that is really an option. I think my best option is to study it on my own, but taking the Data Science specialization from Coursera as an example, it seems like an awfully lot of material to take on along with my other work. I obviously should be learning this stuff in my program instead of doing it on my own, and I plan to bring this up again with my advisor and possibly other people, but I want to be completely prepared to discuss it this time. I plan to have a list of topics I feel I need to know, reasons why the courses they offer aren't up to speed, and why I feel like I'm making no progress. 


But, I was hoping I might get some other advice from here. Suggestions on the topics I should be learning that are very important? What should someone with a PhD from a Computational Science program be able to do when they graduate? When I meet with my advisor again about this, what else should I say?


 I don't feel like my expectations are too high, but I don't know. Maybe I am expecting too much or something. I just want to learn the stuff. I really enjoyed looking through the Titanic problem on that guys blog. I don't enjoy what I currently work on at all. Sometimes I just feel like giving up. I guess I should probably also mention that I am 35, so it's not like I have forever to get this stuff done. I'm already way behind the curve. If your still reading, thanks. Like I said, I don't have anyone to discuss this with, so I hope someone can offer some suggestions or advice.",29,13,False,self,,,,,

I picked up a side-project (non-compensated) that deals with taking a large selection of documents and was asked to separate [read: classify] them based on a couple of criterion.

I am a decent programmer, but now that I have most of my code laid out I am finding that my process is very slow;  I was hoping I could run my procedure by you guys and get suggestions:

The tl;dr for my project is to take all the documents, filter them down by one category and save those results.  Then using the results from the first model, filter down by another category (I am opting to maintain documents classified as 'non-x' for later testing).  I was asked to provide data that met criteria 1 (first classifier results) and then told that from this data, a sub set meeting another criteria would be useful as well (hence my idea to have two classifiers).

I am using  two Naive Bayes (Ridge) classifiers; both trained and pickled off - then loaded at the start of processing.

1.  Preprocessing - filter stuff I do not want to feed to model. Mostly file extensions I wasn't able to get text from/binary files/etc.  (1 1/2)  Get raw text (if not readily available)

2. Tokenize - using 'home-made' whitespace, punc, digit removal code...nothing crazy, just what I was able to get working.

3. Convert to vector -  using scikit's tf/idf vectorizer

5. Send to model/classify - nltk's Ridge classifier

6.  Results to sqlite3 db ({filename}, {path}, {tokens}, {classification})

7.  Results with classification x sent to second model

8.  Classification + file info sent to seperate sqlite db

As I mentioned earlier, this is something I have been extremely interested in getting into but haven't done much with sans lots of reading in this sub and on other sites.  I have taken a few ML/DS with python quick courses, but nothing with strong theory involved.

I am a very intermediate programmer as well - I can definitely make my way around, but it's not going to be the most elegant solution you've ever seen.

So far, everything 'seems to be working' - but, honestly, aside from the guy I am helping giving me the thumbs up; I have no way to really validate my results.  The major problem is that he gave me sooooooo much data that my program ran for roughly two weeks on just a fraction of the data I eventually want to process.  Ideally, this would end up being something I could re-purpose or setup in a way that could be reused for other similar situations.

I was really hoping to get suggestions on how better organize my process or tips/suggestions you may have for me in general.

I am sure I left out some important information in there somewhere - so if there's anything I can clarify to help you, help me...please just ask and I will do my best.

I really appreciate any help in advance.  Thank you! ",0,1,False,self,,,,,

I don't have much interest in general business / operations management. IT has always been much more interesting to me; so much so that I'm pursuing a third college degree in IT. Looking at the different career areas of IT, data management seems to be the most interesting to me. I don't know how I should go about making the shift though. It seems like everyone starts their IT career at a help desk and moves on from there. I have several years of management experience and a couple of irrelevant bachelors degrees in technical areas of study, but I'm also currently in the middle of pursuing an IT degree. How should I go about making the shift in my career? I would think I probably need to start as a data analyst? What are the general requirements to get one of those jobs?

I've been lurking on this sub for a while and came across a question I have that I couldn't easily find answers for after poking around.

I'm new to data science and have heard that getting some practical experience with real-world projects is a great way to learn. I have some business contacts in various industries and have convinced a few of them (all of them small business owners with companies &lt;=10m in yearly revenue) to give me access to whatever data I want from their companies in exchange for some free analytics. There's no mission critical timeline and there aren't really any specific expectations.

My background: I know R and Python well enough to hack things together from Stack Overflow, etc. Like I said -- I'm new, not a pro by any means. My background is in Epidemiology and business (eclectic, I know) so I'm relatively familiar with statistics and business but am new to the CS side.

Here are the two main scenarios I want some input about tackling:

1) One company is a wedding band business. A pain point for them is their inventory management system (essentially non-existant). I have worked with inventory management in the past and have developed a very basic A-Z system (with basics like PAR levels, etc) for a different small company for one of my internships. Do you have any tips on how to analyze inventory data/any data science applications here? Again, trying to use this as a learning experience.

2) One of the other companies is in the water filter industry and wants to learn which of their products are preforming best. The obvious place to start is sales history, seasonal trends, etc. Any other areas I should dive in and check out here?

Sorry if this post is a bit ambiguous. I'm just trying to wrap my arms around tackling these problems from a Data Science standpoint as opposed to just my knee jerk reaction. I am happy to clarify/come back with some more details from the business owners.",1,2,False,self,,,,,

In my last few semesters I plan to take a few computer science courses, and I plan to apply for the Master's in Data Science program at my current university.

However, as I am looking at what math classes to take toward my major next I have realized that I truly do not like such theoretical mathematics. My school doesn't offer a statistics major, otherwise I would take that. In fact, of the seven remaining courses I have toward my math major, only 2 would be about probability and statistics, which is what I truly have a passion for.

That being said, I am thinking of dropping my math major down to a minor. I have taken Linear Algebra, Combinatorics, and Discrete Mathematics, and I am currently taking Ordinary Differential Equations during my semester abroad.

I would also plan on doing a computer science minor if I drop math to a minor. I wish I had realized this freshman year and I could've done a computer science major, but such is life \\_()_/

So my question is, would it make me less of a competitive applicant to be a Psychology Major (hopefully honors) and Mathematics and C.S. Minor rather than Psychology and Mathematics major?

Thank you for any input!",8,1,False,self,,,,,

Currently learning python and statistics. I am using Jupyter Notebook to track my progress and build a portfolio. 

* I am new to virtual environments
* I have some experience with Git.


I am currently storing my projects in `anaconda/envs/[project title]`.  

**QUESTION(S)**

1. I assume I should I created individual git repos for each project but wonder if I create a git repo at the `env` folder level and push individual folders (e.g `project1` and `project2`) to their own repos.
1. A few users (on another forum) have suggested not storing the project files within the `env` folder. However, I thought this was the purpose of the `env` folders. If my approach is wrong, please let me know a better approach. 


*NOTE: apologies if these seem like very basic questions. I believe I know what to do (i.e create git repos at the project-folder level and only add libraries to the local environment), but I've heard many different opinions on file management.*",3,6,False,self,,,,,

I still have some ground work to do mastering use of various packages, starting some commercial work and checking options for configuring my workstation (and possible workstation upgrade)

Would appreciate input from others on how they approached this issue. Some reports indicate 20x speed easily achieved. Looking at the config instructions in one of the links below suggests the config process is not simple. [prior experiences leave me cautious]

The flipside is my experience to date has been the time involved in preparing data and configuring the model &gt;&gt;&gt; actual runtime.

Theano - just read about it, sounds great, much to learn.

This for example.

I have a (small, n &lt; 1000) dataset of discrete state sequences with one continuous outcome at the end. The sequences are fairly short, and each timestep measures the evolution of a system over a range of states. Graphical representation:
 
                           231.2
                            /|\
                             |
    A -&gt; C -&gt; A -&gt; D -&gt; D -&gt; A 
 
The goal is to, somewhat vaguely, to find state subsequences (or any other sequence patterns) that best determine the numerical outcome, with a view to selecting state sequences that optimize the output of the system. 
 
I have not been able to find literature that deals specifically with this type of problem, except for ([Noto et al 08](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3141580/)) which is pretty high concept.

I like to understand the theory/math a little, enough to understand the strengths/weaknesses rather than the full mathematical derivation and proofs.

I'm was hoping one of the opencourseware courses from MIT or edx/coursera etc might cover this.  plugging my way through the documentation and examples. Just hoping someone out there knows of some gold.

If this is covered in any textbook that would be appreciated also.

I am currently studying a Master in Data Science in London and am enjoying the course but am desperate to get some more hands on experience. I am fortunate to have a background in Maths (including a decent amount of stats) and so I am more comfortable with the theory aspects of the course but am much weaker in the coding application. We are being given 'dummy' data sets to work with but a lot of the decision making is often left open ended due to there being no real constraints and it makes it hard to draw solid conclusions.

Are there any well known free lance projects for data scientists to allow us to test skills in a real environment?

I'm nowhere near advanced/expert or where I want to be and I have a lot of items left to learn.

However, I notice the entire industry (quantitative finance) is moving to Python.  I think I need to move to Python long-term and I'm wondering if I should:

-  just drop R (almost completely) and immediately begin moving to Python including re-learning tasks.  

- Or if I should just pick up specific tasks in python like web scraping and keep perfecting my R work, then finally move to Python when I feel like I am expert in these R areas.

I have intentions of going on to pursue a masters degree in either Data Science or Big Data next year. I am wondering if anyone could comment in particular on if specialising in Big Data is a wise choice. 

I'd like to work with Big Data in my career but my concerns are that maybe a Big Data masters is too constricting in terms of job choice and job availability. That being said, I also wonder if pursuing a Data Science masters disadvantages me when competing for big data jobs against candidates with the more specialised degree.  

How easy would it be to switch over to a big data engineering role (and learn all the necessary skills needed) from say, a traditional data scientist role? On the contrary, If I pursued a big data masters degree, would I be able to just as easily apply for and work as a traditional data scientist?

Any extra information would also be appreciated, it's always nice to learn from those in the industry.

I am looking for a solution that can do this without manual intervention. Therefore I am thinking I will need 1) some software to analyze past results and generate the HTML (including some tables) and graphs, 2) serve these materials from a web server. (I have ways to automatically trigger this procedure, if needed.)

Python is preferred, but JavaScript or R based solutions are fine too (php is not). I have briefly looked into flask and django but both seem have a pretty steep learning curve. shiny with R is one possibility, but I am wondering what you guys use.

It also would be great to have some real examples that are more fully built than toy examples.

I used to work for an oil and gas company after I graduted with my masters (also in geology/geochem. The industry tanked and here we are.  I am not optimistic about the job prospects from this school (although I do get paid ~18k/yr with free tuition) after I graduate.  All that said I am considering data science since I really do enjoy looking for trends in large data sets.  For example for my masters I got admittedly kind of obsessed with finding and interpreting patterns the data set I was working on, although I was essentially doing this by putting together x/y scatter plots for each individual set of numbers.  I do have some programming experience  (when I was in undergrad I built a geology game in VB6 which probably doesn't even count as programming, the most advanced thing I got it to do was bubble sort the scores at the end of the game but I digress).  I've had math up to calc 2 but never really used it at all.
Anyways so with all that in mind I was wondering if data science would be a good idea to get into.  The program I'm in will let me basically take any course I want after I'm done with my core classes but I'm not totally sure where it would be best to start.

In recent years, some services offering automated data analysis, like [DataRobot](https://www.datarobot.com/), have come online, and they are incredibly impressive. For those unfamiliar with them, they utilize machine learning algorithms to determine the structure of the data itself, run hundreds of possible models and algorithms, and outputs all of them, including ranking them by various performance measures and allowing someone to then integrate the model or results of their choice into their projects. All someone has to do is upload their data and DataRobot takes it from there. It is essentially automating the process of data science that takes place between collecting/structuring the data, and using the results of the model. 

And it is quite good. I have a colleague who spent a summer as an intern on the data science team for a fairly large financial company, and they hosted a intracompany Kaggle competition, and he said some of the people had some very impressive performances, but someone tried using DataRobot on the same problem for comparison and it blew everyone out of the water.

And though DataRobot is one of the first and better known platforms, it certainly will not be the last. I know of some startups that are aiming to compete with DataRobot in the near future.

For the class, we are to ""cold contact"" a professional in our field of interest and invite them for a networking event (information regarding the event below):

Date: Mon Dec 5, 2016

Time: 12-1 pm

Place: 1 Kings College Circle, Medical Sciences Building Rm 5231.

Lunch will be provided!

 All guest
speakers would be providing a 5 minute chat of the transition from 
school to career, answering a few class questions and then networking with
approximately 30 graduate students.

My research is in bioinformatics and I hope to transition into data science after I get my MSc. So I would actually be really interested in talking to someone currently working in the field and learning about how I can better prepare myself for this field (my undregrad was in biochemistry and switching to computational research has been a steep learning curve for me). I've found reddit to be a friendly community, so I thought I would post on here in addition to reaching out to people on LinkedIn.

Hello everyone,

I am a undergrad SOC/Engineering student at University of Washington who is fairly new to programming (1yr). I have a project proposal due next week and I am struggling to look for any data science with R. Anywhere you would recommend to look for ideas for a term related project? Or even any recommendations would be much appreciated. 

GOALS - 
to identify the research question that you would like to address;

to explain why it is relevant;

to identify the data that you plan to use (if data collection is part of the project, you should explain how you plan to access the data);

to identify the research design and methods that you plan to use in order to accomplish your research project;

to provide some initial suppositions about results that you expect to obtain and how this small research project may lead to something bigger, or connect to your general research interests.

Bear in mind that this is a proposal for a modest term project. Be sure that the project that you are proposing is feasible within the time frame of the course.",7,1,False,self,,,,,

My question is both general and specific, so I'll start with a simplified general case:

Let's say I sell a product to both men and women and I want to predict who is going to buy it. From experience, I *know* that the predictors for men and women are completely different (although they buy it about equally so gender itself is not correlated with likelihood to purchase). In this example, would it be better to create two separate predictive models? Are there ways to account for this in a single model? What if the categorical value had more values (10+)? 

In my specific case, I am looking at success rates of college students. I want to predict which students are going to fail the course so that interventions can be performed during the course. I know that on day 0 before the class has started, there are indicators that can be used to build a model. Later in the course (day 7, 14, etc.) those indicators will be very different because they will start to incorporate grades and assignment submissions.

My plan was to build a model for day 0 and additional models for various points in time throughout the course. Is this a good plan or is there a way to build a single model that accounts for the day of the course?

I would appreciate any thoughts on either scenario. Thank you for reading!",11,3,False,self,,,,,

I find myself in the somewhat awkward position of being a new hire in a ""big data"" team and being asked to recommend an ETL tool. I come from an applied math background and am way deep into R and Python, but I've never heard of all these ETL tools (e.g. Lavastorm, Pentaho, etc.).

My team members have different backgrounds with less programming experience and want (also for business reasons) to use a tool with a graphical interface. I on the other hand would like to use a slightly lower-level tool, e.g. Apache Spark (pyspark).

Is there a tool out there which is built on Spark which has a GUI and allows the user to construct models purely by writing code?

Why not just use a simple year over year calculation to measure the effect? E.g. 20% increase in time from last year.

The curriculum looks solid too, except for somewhat of a lack in machine learning. All in all, the program looks like it'll do the job.

I am a mid-career software developer guy, looking to get into AI/Machine Learning/Data science. The motivation is longevity of career and the add a core emerging skillset. 

The best way I thought of doing it was to take some online courses from a University. I have taken some of the course-era stuff partially, and I felt that these were OK as an introduction to the topic for someone completely unfamiliar, but were made overly simple to appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Also, if the only thing I have to show by way of credentials is an MOOC course, I felt it would be hard to distinguish myself from other candidates.  

Looking into online programs by Universities, I zeroed in on the UCB online data science program 

https://datascience.berkeley.edu/academics/curriculum/ 
(8 courses, 1 capstone project, Costs about $60,000. Can take anywhere from 2 to 3 years)

and the 

Stanford graduate certificate in AI: 
http://scpd.stanford.edu/public/category/courseCategoryCertificateProfile.do?method=load&amp;certificateId=1226717

(4 courses, Costs about $15-$20,000. Can be done in one year and a few months. If there is an interesting course, you can always take it after paying the fee. )

For whatever reason, just looking at the curriculum made it feel that the Stanford course was more focused at robotics and AI and applications of technology while the UCB course focused more at 'core' Data Science.

The UCB course offers a far more 'intimate' setting, even though its online, with only around 20 students per course, interacting live with a teacher. Its a bit like skype-ing. 

The stanford course is more like coursera, but with the opportunity to interact with the stanford student and teaching community online and the challenge of being graded on a bell curve with bright students. Its the same exact course that's taught in Stanford, so can expect it to be rigorous and the hws and projects challenging. 

Ideally, after taking this course, I would be working at one of the big software companies (Bing/Google/FB/...) or some startup as a senior or a staff engineer. (It doesnt make financial sense for me get into an 'entry level' position.) 

If any one has taken these expensive courses, can you shed some light on what your experience was like? 

If you can observe any difference in the course structure and you prefer one over the other, can you point that out? 

Thank you very much!",10,7,False,self,,,,,

Things like laptop screen size, different brands, external monitors, extent of local vs cloud work, etc optimized for what type of work.  Maybe how that changes for diff work environments (ie office vs freelance vs remote)  Like an EDC, but for data science.

EDIT:  My day job setup has been primarily a massive Dell, or a 15 MBP with a standing desk, and an external monitor really only to keep my eye-line faced up as opposed to extra screen space.  Have relied mainly on trackpad, native keyboard, because I like to keep everything right next to each other.  in this case, have run everything primarily locally, so have opted for the more powerful machines available.  However, I'm unsure about how I feel about big screens, I feel like I get more distracted with more screen space.     Which leads me into my personal, which I am going for a razer blade stealth (possibly an 13.3 asus zenbook if 12.5 ruins me within the first couple weeks, have had macs for awhile and $$$) and add Linux. going for the opposite of what I'm currently using primarily, a super portable but still capable machine.  Would opt for something less powerful and save some money, but I haven't gotten used to working only in the cloud, and still like to do some testing etc locally with all the ide's and such
Otherwise, besides light earbuds to block noise, the only other stuff I really get utility out of for my workspace set up is some sort of standing desk or laptop stand that tilts it to a 40* angle or so.  I otherwise like to be at coffee shops, but shitty internet, uncomfortable chairs, and too many distractions have slowed me down there recently.",17,14,False,self,,,,,

Skill Set : Teradata (mostly bteq and TPT ) , SAP Business Objects (Webi and Universe designer(4.1) ) , ksh scripting , Apache Storm 

Other skills : Beginner level knowledge in Python and related ML libraries, trained in  core Java and J2EE.

Looking to switch to data science / machine learning  involving building models, visualizations and  hence moving to the decision support team. 

Motivation to switch is to work on a  more Math based area rather than traditional data pipeline setup and reporting. 

Please suggest a path to transition.

Looking for suggestions on how to apply what I learn about DS in my current job, so I'd have a better chance convincing my employer to let me switch to DS.


Thanks in advance !

I do not have a stats background. I have a background with Linear Programming though. I studied Econometrics in college with naths Linear Algebra, Calc1-4, Stats 101 though. Whenever I don't know something, I google it.

Since I left college, I worked in finance basically doing some variance, basic maths, pivot tables, excel vba lookups, fuzzy mapping of file directories, regex matching, sql querying, data mining and cleansing.

I am 23.

But I have a dilemma. I'm in a development program and will soon be entering my third and final ""rotation."" One of my options is to enter what is essentially a DS training program within my company, which lasts 12 months. Participants in this program spend 50% of their time doing coursework (e.g. Coursera courses, intra-company training, etc.) around Big Data, ML, and other topics encompassed by DS. The other 50% of your time is billable, i.e. you'll be working on client work, most likely with several other members of the training program. Obviously the leaders of this program want to make it sound like they're the gatekeepers to becoming a data scientist within this company.

The other option is to continue working as data scientist ""not-in-official-training"" (that's not to say I'm not always learning). The ultimate deliverables from my first two rotations are in production, now, which is pretty cool. I love knowing that the work I did actually is being used and has an impact. Plus, in this role, I would get more exposure to the sales side of DS, because I'd basically be doing consulting and developing ML products.

Here's what I think, and I appreciate any input you all may have:

- Is the training program anything but a formality for someone who's worked in DS for a while now?
- I'm sort of a fan of the ""sink or swim"" approach to these sorts of things. I've proven that I've been able to learn DS and be competitive on my own and through university, so why should I spend 50% of the next 12 months re-hashing what may be, at this point, DS 101-type topics?
- **Ultimately, I think the mark of a true data scientist is whether you can actually get the job done in a quality manner and communicate the value of those findings effectively. This is very much an applied, learn-by-doing approach instead of ""here, spend 50% of your time taking this MOOC"" as opposed to working on client work.**

Any advice for my situation? ",14,8,False,self,,,,,
