This post is for my fellow Redditors who are thinking to switch to the data science industry. There are a few reasons to switch, primarily the future job market will need a huge amount of data practitioners (data analyst, data scientist, data engineers). And, of course, the work is very interesting with the opportunity to advance your career to C-suite**.** (Chief Data Officer)

**What is the current method?**

The current pedagogy is either get an MS in Analytics/Statistics /Data Science or go through a Bootcamp. Let's examine these options a bit.

*1) Masters option:*

*A good option for someone who does not have a Masters Degree but plans to get one*

Pros: 

* solid breadth of knowledge
* some amount of alumni network
* academic validation

Cons:

* Time-consuming, can take upto 2 years to complete
* The average tuition fee for a Masters from a decent Univ. is $50K+
* Unfortunately, Masters will still get an Entry-level data science job most often if there is no relevant prior exp.
* A lot of the things we learn in the MS will never be used in industry

*2) Bootcamps:*

*Can be really good for someone with past experience in data mining (academic or non-academic)*

Pros:

* Shorter time to complete the program
* Hands-on experience with Data Analysis Tools
* Some amount of Network 
* Accountable for self-learning, cannot slack as we do with MOOCs

Cons:

* Can be expensive for the duration of the course; current tuition ranges from $7,000- $17,000 approx. for 3 to 6 months
* Most of them teach how to use a tool aka Python or R and not actual problem solving 
* Bootcamps covers a vast amount of topic in a short time, which can be extremely overwhelming for someone who is already having a full-time job; these topic usually take over two years to masters, not sure how they expect students to grasp them in a few months. (Lots of caffeine maybe)
* Most of the students from Bootcamp land entry-level Data Analyst role instead of the promised ""Data Scientist"" role with $100K+ comp, unless there is past experience working in data mining
* Sometimes it can be a total rip-off; read reviews pls.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is the alternative approach?**

Hack it!

My undergrad was in Mechanical Engineering, and Masters was in Industrial Engineering, so yes I had a quantitative background, therefore, it was easy for me to pick data science up on my own. In my experience, I have seen a lot of non-Computer Science engineer adopt this path. Why? well engineers have two very important skills that allow them to pick up this field fairly quickly, these are A) Problem Solving and B) Quantitative thinking

This doesn't mean only an engineer can hack it, what I am suggesting is if someone is naturally good at A &amp; B, then they might just pick it up themselves.

So, how to hack your way? well, step one is to hone in what is the job you want to target. Generally, for someone without any background in data science, Data Analyst is a good starting point, unless someone has a PhD. then Data Scientist should be the target.

Once the target is locked in, work back from there to find the type of questions asked for the target role. There are numerous resources online to do research. You will notice a few patterns if you do your research well.

 Next step will be to learn SQL, yes this is absolutely critical. 

Finally, time to market yourself.  This will require some homework. A github account with some data analysis on public dataset is table-stakes. Couple of blogs on the learning experience is the cherry on top but not necessary. Then you are ready to go out and violently network with the Hiring Managers. I use Linkedin like a savage when I job hunt, I do not show any mercy on cold messaging recruiters and hiring manager on Linkedin. I generally message over 30 people a day. 

If you are already working, then it is a bit easier to transition in your own company. Actually, that's the easiest route! However many companies won't let people switch career, in that case you can use Linkedin, and Meetup Groups to network.  

A note of referrals, 90% of the positions I held was through referral. If you know someone at a target company, exploit it to your advantage. Infiltrate and extract all information on their data science teams and interview process so that you can nail it if referred.

Overall, the entry-level data science position is fairly easy to break without a MS or Bootcamp than Data Scientist position, which will require much more academic rigor to break into. However, if you have your foot in the door it is easier to swtich, most of the Data Scientist I know at Microsoft or Amazon are switchers from Data Analyst or Data Engineers. For me, I started as a Business Analyst, and then switched to Data Scientist after a couple of years. It's doable if you stop getting wasted on the weekends.

**What are the different data science roles?**

Well, everyone wants to be a data scientist but no one talks about our Data Engineer friends. Data Engineers are most undervalued in the industry but they make comparable money to an elite Data Scientist. So if you already know coding and want to be in data science, this might be the role. 

Data Analyst is again undervalued, many large corporations pay data analyst nearly the same they pay a data scientist. Which is much more what a data scientist at an average company would make. Further, if you go to Linkinedin there are 10X times data analyst roles than are data scientist roles.

The future of ML/AI will require Software engineers and Data Analyst for sure, because, in most top companies like FB, Google, Uber, data scientist are mostly software engineers who happen to have a minor or PhD in Machine Learning from school. So kindly respect our expert Analyst friends. 

**How data science interviews vary by company?**

* Startups: Generally 1-2 technical phone screen and then an on-site if the startup is not very hot. If hot, then they will give you a take-home to torture you over then the weekend before on-site. 
* Large Tech: 1-2 Technical phone screen, Take-home (over 6-8 hours of work) and then onsite
* Old school Big boys: Mostly 2 phone screen and then onsite
* Small and Medium companies: generally 1 phone screen with HM, some take-home (1-2 hour work)  and onsite

Hope this is helpful.

So, I ask those who have relocated for a job:

1. What was the total comp increase you received? You can use a % increase or give more details, whatever you're comfortable with.
2. Where did you move to and from? You can be vague if you'd prefer, like ""average COL city in the Midwest"", or ""major city in California"".
3. Did your quality of life improve/are you happy you made the move? This is a purely subjective question. I don't want numbers - just a ""yes, I am happy, it was worth it"", or a ""no, I wish I had stayed where I was"".",30,10

I'm currently midway through my masters in statistics degree and am starting to think about the impending job search more and more. My undergrad degree was in statistics and applied mathematics.

Honestly, I feel super insecure about my abilities as a data scientist. I read through the posts here and feel like I don't know what the hell the rest of you are even talking about. I feel like I'm missing a huge chunk of qualifications that you guys seem to have. I've always been more interested in a data scientist role rather than a traditional statistician role because I love simulations and non-parametric methods and machine learning. I also love data visualization.

I have done quite a lot of projects during undergrad and during internships. I've worked in R, Python, MATLAB, Mathematica, SAS and have used SPSS, JMP, and Minitab. I wouldn't consider myself an expert in any of them, but I have had the most formal training in R and SAS (although I think I have blocked out a lot of my knowledge in SAS from my memory lol). I've used Python for NNs primarily and honestly I feel confused by it often. When I use matplotlib (had to for my latest internship) I just miss using tidyverse and ggplot2! It took me a long time to catch onto stuff in Python and now it seems I just make everything into enormous dictionaries which feels unnecessary. I don't really know how to make a class.

I just feel like I'm not as strong of a programmer as everyone else in this field! Gitlab confuses me.  I never took a data structures and algorithms course. I don't know different types of sorting algorithms. I don't really know SQL (I have used the SQL procedure in SAS but that's it). I don't know what Oracle is.

How concerned should I be? I have a strong math background and have experience with a wide range of projects like clustering, SVM, feed forward NN, and CNN. But it seems like I don't properly fit into a lot of job postings.",0,2

That was in another field, so we speak less now, but it's still a valuable relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been searching for a mentor in the field of DS for some time now. As a complete noob, I need a more experienced individual who can answer some of my dumb questions and provide career guidance. I'm still pretty young and haven't spent much time mentoring anyone, so I'm not exactly sure what the return would be from that side, but I'm told the experience can be rewarding and fulfilling, and new perspectives and friendships can be made.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm wondering whether there'd be any interest in designing a program like that here on r/datascience? There's quite a bit of gate-keeping, I've noticed, and I think it could be a positive experience for all if we came together and empowered this community. I've also noticed a lot of friendly people, genuinely sharing their knowledge and experience, so I know there are those out there perfectly suited to be a mentor!

Im a a new analyst at a fairly large LA tech co and have been assigned a new project revolving around analyzing the accuracy of our call center workforce predictions ie how well we are at staffing agents based on call traffic and other factors.

Ive never worked with Erlang before and am unsure how to approach coming up with a better way of forecasting. I was going to grab some call data and run the Erlang func myself to make sure the predicted values really are coming from Erlang but I dont know what Id do afterwards. Maybe theres a better predictive model to use besides Erlang, I dont know.

I like the ""modularity"" and ""siloed nature of functions because it is easier to debug, read, etc. Given the project, a lot of my functions are using a fair amount of pandas and beautifulsoup code.

21,2019-8-2,2019,8,2,9,ckwha3,How to show information overlap for Boolean variables.,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ckwha3/how_to_show_information_overlap_for_boolean/,Mayo_Kupo,1564704118,"I am working on a project that involves predicting a probability from a set of features, most of which are Boolean or categorical.  My R2 score is not very high (0.4).  I think that the features have overlapping information, and that this partly explains the low R2.  If I were working with continuous variables, I would create a covariance matrix to show the overlap between features, then take the determinant of that matrix to sum up the set.  

But I would like to focus on the Boolean features, which are the majority of the feature set.  With Booleans, while covariance would still be defined, a covariance matrix doesn't seem like so good a fit.  What I want to do instead is use each Boolean feature to predict each other feature, and taking the accuracy score of each pairwise prediction as the measure of information overlap, instead of covariance.  Then I'd like to put that information in a matrix, a ""prediction matrix,"" and represent it as a heatmap.

1. Is this a good idea?
2. Is this already an established approach, or would I be breaking new ground and need to explain what I'm doing more thoroughly?
3. Should I take the determinant of the prediction matrix, just the average of predictive accuracies, or find some other way to quantify the information overlap?
4. Is there a benchmark level (such as accuracy score) for how much inter-predictability there is between features, especially Boolean features, that one would hope for or expect?  I'd like to say that being able to predict one Boolean feature from another feature only to 55% or less is ""good"" because of less overlap.  Is there such a number?  ...

I also have a database that contains the fields that are required by these blanks.

My goal is to scan the pdf, identify the blanks, and predict which field from our database each blank is asking for.

So far, I have created some code to convert each pdf page into a jpg. Scan the jpg for all horizontal lines. Get the coordinates of all words on the page. So my final dataset is on a line/blank granularity and has data for each word found on the page. For instance one row would be for a single blank that is asking for the applicant's date of birth. Then I would have a column 'Date\_distance'. This would be the Euclidian distance that the word 'Date' is from the blank in question. I would do this for everyone word on the page. From this, I can find the words that are closest to the blanks. I also have columns, for whether that word is capitalized, whether it's on the same line etc.

So I can identify words that I believe will be most predictive for each blank. Once I have this set of words what would be the best way to tie them back to a specific field?

I've thought about using some sort of supervised learning algorithm (ECOC) to calculate the probability for every field, but this doesn't lend itself well to newly created fields. Additionally, there isn't a ton of training data. I figure a better way would be to get a list of words that are predictive and build some kind of word association model. The problem is that I have very little experience with this kind of work.

So, if anyone has any suggestions, I would be love to hear them.",2,1

I always have been interested in programming and I have encountered problems at work that I felt could've been much more easily solved by a custom script or program, so I started learning Python 4 months ago. As I have been learning Python, I keep hearing about data science and it has peaked my curiosity. I completed Jose Portilla's Python bootcamp on udemy and I currently am taking his Python data science class, but I feel like this class is just teaching me how to use numpy, pandas, etc. libraries. 

I am looking for a more foundational class in data science applications so I can learn more about the thought process instead of calling methods from packages. I see edx recommended a lot on reddit, but figured I'd come here and ask for recommended next steps?

So here it goes.   

I have to say Im fortunate to have met hundreds if not thousands of young and enthusiastic professionals over coffee chats, Skype calls or phone calls who are all looking at ways to break into the incredible and exciting field of data science. Most have mentioned their lack of technical skills in this space which has been a deterrent for them to enter the field and feel pigeon holed from moving forward. Nobody should feel this way. 

Ive also had the pleasure to directly manage experts in this field including PhDs and masters professionals so have a good understanding of whats needed and what some of todays talent need to do to bridge the gap.   As one small gap fix, Ive started a little YouTube series, encouraged by a lot of people that Ive met, that is really meant to help bridge the gap between these technical skills and enable people to solve real world problems. Ive already gotten great feedback from others who are using the series. My intent is 100% to educate others so they can move past the intimidation phase and join others in helping to solve real world problems. There are obviously other skills that are needed in addition to these but some of those are specific to the candidate. I am by no means pewdiepie nor aspire to be like him but I figure using this medium to help people is a start. Here is the link to my channel for those interested.   [Here it is](https://youtube.com/channel/UCyVIfVgx77jslb0U5h-zhLQ?sub_confirmation=1)

I would also say a good leaders will hire for fit and the technical aspect can be taught. Ive learned this from some the amazing leaders Ive had the pleasure to work for as well. Ive experience so many people who are non technical looking to to start, eventually get a chance and flourish in this field. What I want to drive home to people to not be discouraged, dont stop because someone told you its not possible (Ive heard this too many times in my one on ones) and  continue on a path to improve everyday and Im certain you can break into this field or any other area you desire.   

Ill also leave you with this info and that is python, Java, sql, R and cloud technologies are growing fast. Focus in these areas as growth is expected to be double digit over the next 5 years. While things like excel will continue to be used you will see more companies shift the technologies above for deeper analytics if they havent already. I was surprised to hear how many companies still use excel and tableau but they are trying to improve their tech stack. 

For those who want to learn, no matter what your background or how old you are stay focussed. It will take some time to develop in this area but everybody brings a unique perspective that is always useful in real world problems.   Keep focused and stay on course. These are my words of encouragement for today.",12,0

So this might come across as a quite rudimentary question to some of you, but for me who isn't a data scientist yet this is quite an interesting proposition.

I have 1066 samples of data, each of these samples contain the ethnicity of a person. Out of this sample data I would like to make some conclusions about the country in which the data was collected, however herein lies the problem. The sample data is heavily skewed towards one ethnicity and this does not represent the actual demographic of the country. 

So my question is : would it be possible to properly represent the demographic of the country by oversampling the samples in the sample data who's ethnicity needs to be increased to properly represent the demographic of the country, whilst simultaneously under-sampling the samples in the sample data who's ethnicity needs to be reduced to properly represent the demographic of the country.

If this is not the way to do this please advice me how to do this apart from having a bigger sample size.

Thanks in advance",5,2

I have a friend who decided to manually and subjectively assign weight inside a feature, the age class. Say someone would be &lt;18 yo, they would give them a higher weight manually by assigning a number a lot higher than those that aren't (3 if they are for example, 0 if they aren't)

&amp;#x200B;

I definitely think this is a really bad idea to do that, as it's the model that is supposed to do these calculations, instead of chosing your own weights based on a possibly biased perception, but I couldn't find the words to explain and convince why it would be a bad idea.

My friend has a better kaggle score doing that, but I still think it's a terrible practice and it's a good insight that scores are meaningless sometime when it comes to real data science.

I have a bachelor of computer engineering, i started interning at company and scored full time job with them working as data analyst assistant with the data science team. My main tasks were web scraping and data cleansing and i have been doing it for the past 6 months. I had progress presentation with team leads and head of AI, and i was asked where do you see yourself next year, and what you want to do moving forward. I couldn't answer the question as i don't have an answer yet myself. Finally i was asked to prepare a road-map for the next 4 months.

I think becoming a data scientists is not the path for me, i think it's either a data analyst or data engineer. The issue is if i want to become a data analyst in my team we already have 2 data analysts, one is not strong in python and the other is working in machine learning, i feel like i can bring something different to the table since i'm proficient python and web based development, so i can create visualizations tools which i'm kinda excited about.

The other path is data engineering, honesty since it's a startup we don't have actual big data yet but i think we will reach there eventually, and in our team the data scientists do the engineering part so we don't have any real data engineer, but i feel the data engineer is long path and i don't know if it will really be useful to the company in the long run.

My story was quite different from the textbooks. I work for a microcredit startup and the model aims to predict if a loanee will pay back the loan. 

For the first version of the model, we carried out all the classic tests of cross validation and 20% hold out for testing. The model performed well on both, and there were no signs of overfitting. It was only after a month after releasing our model that real world results started coming in and it became apparent that our model was performing far worse than on the training and testing data. 

So back to the drawing board. While working on the second version of the model, we discovered by accident a pretty strange property. If the test size was large (0.3-0.1 of the total data), there would be no signs of overfitting. However, if you made the test size ridiculously small, (like 6 or 10 examples), the overfitting would become apparent with the model making incoherent predictions. But if we trained on 60% of the data and tested on 40%, the performance would be very good (too good to be true) So the smaller the testset , the worst the model did, a sure sign of overfitting. 

We tweaked hyperparameters and the model now performs similarly on all test sizes, and it's AUC is more consistent between training set size so we feel more confident about releasing the next model. 

But I wanted to pick your brains about this phenomenon of the overfitting only being evident when testing only a few examples. Has anyone come across this before? Any ideas as to why ? My theory is that the data is very uniform. So the spurrious patterns found in the data also exist in the test data when it is largish. However when the test data is very small, it contains too few examples for the overfitted parameters to work and the lack of generalisation becomes apparent.

Looking forward to your discussion.",16,2

In our problem statement, we have a group of athletes who are planning to live in Seattle for several weeks. They would need to find several flats, so its desirable that they are located nearby to make the collective work-outs easier. Additional preferences include presence of a park nearby and low criminality in that district because they are planning to be outside very often (jogging in the evenings, etc). Also, the apartments should be affordable, but the factor of low criminality is valued higher by our clients.

The target audience for this report are:

potential buyers, who can roughly estimate which neighborhoods are more desired (and the models used for analysis should be easily adjustable),
real estate builders and planners who can decide what kind of neighborhoods are more attractive on the market to maximize selling price of newly built flats,
and of course, to this courses instructors and learners who will grade my project,
anyone who is curious how Python can be applied to easily crawl web pages; parse CSV or JSON files; create powerful visualizations of data as scatter plots, heat maps, density plots using matplotlib, seaborn and map visualizations using Folium; process data using lists, dictionaries, pandas DataFrames.

I understand the calculation steps, but I still dont know how to think about the hidden layers and how interpret the results (of the hidden layer)

So for example, given the standard MNIST datset that is used to train and predict handwritten digits between 0 to 9, a model would look like this:

1. An image of a handwritten digit will have 784 pixels.
2. Since there are 784 pixels, there would be 784 input nodes and the value of each node is the pixel intensity(0-255)
3. each node branches out and these branches are the weights.
4. My next layer is my hidden layer, and the value of a given node in the hidden layer is the weighted sum of my input nodes (pixels\*weights).
5. Whatever value I get, I squash it with a sigmoid function and I get a value between 0 and 1.

That number that I get from the sigmoid. What does it represent exactly and why is it relevant? My understanding is that if I want to build more hidden layers, I'll be using the values of my initial hidden layer, but at this point, i'm stuck as to what the values of the first hidden layer mean exactly.

I've read something about the first layer is to detect edges, the second layer is to detect something more  detailed, but all I see right now is weighted sums calculations, so I dont understand how it translates.

Thank you!

I was promoted to an social media and web analyst position about a year ago with almost zero computer experience ( I know, I know). The kicker is after one month the rest of my team quit leaving me with almost no training and having to attempt to self learn things that are not natural to me. After about a year of stumbling backwards and learning in what is most likely a muted hamstrung very narrow way - Excel, Google Analytics, GTM, and small base of what ever qualifies as social/digital media buying and strategy,  and managing to survive I would like to expand my knowledge base and do so more into the actual Data Science realm as opposed to Social Analyst. It seems that is where the career longevity is. SO, that brings me to this question. Not to say I don't intend learn more moving forward but I'm realistic. I can only devote so much time after work and around life and I know a little victory in the beginning will help me stay committed.

That's why I decided to stick with Javascript. The next step for me would be to do every part of the plotting in Javascript, not just the interactive part. This seems to make more sense than building something in python, integrating Javascript and exporting the whole thing as an HTML file. 

Bokeh exists also as BokehJS with all models and methods having the same names as in python. This would come in handy as I already know the Python version. And then there is D3 which seems to me like the Go To Javascript library for data visualization. From what I have seen until now, D3 looks much more powerful than Bokeh.

Has someone also had the experience of transitioning from pure python to Javascript? How is D3 compared to BokehJS? Is there a third library more suited for the case then both D3 and BokehJS?

so, I have an entry level data scientist who skills wise he is competentant if not slightly above average for entry level.  however, the issue is, I always feel like he defaults to the path of the minimum effort.

1) the date format of his input data for an alteryx workflow got changed.

Fixing this in his alteryx workflow( one node) he stretched out to 7 hours tehn he went home early.

&amp;#x200B;

2) I asked him to filter data for 2019 only.  and export 4 dimensions and 3 measures out of tableau.  I told him to let me know when he was done.  I went into meetings for 5 hours, was like wtf is going on, exported it myself in under 1 minute and sent it to him and he still was not done with his export.  Since, I did not give him a deadline, he was extremely slow to complete a basic task.

3) I gave him and another datascientist the same assignment because they both needed to learn it. I told them to split it, by analyzing different products in their queries.  Logically, I do understand, one person could just not filter the query and pull all products.  But, it was responding to a common ad hoc request and I wanted them both to learn.  Well, the one guy finished his query super fast as he is an overachiever.  and my problem employee just told me the other guy was so far ahead on figuring it out, he was waiting on him to finish and send him the query to alter for his products and had not started.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, he defaults to lowest effort possible.  If I do not specifically give deadlines or give lenient deadlines, he will take as long as fucking possible.  None of my other employees do this.  I've never had an employee do this

There are cultural and language barriers as he is 23 and been in the US like 6 months.  So, I understand it has to be tough. and maybe in his culture managers micro manage the fuck out of you.  this is also his first professional job

&amp;#x200B;

so a few questions

A)  do you think im being too critical of him for the above issues.  like he has a ms in computer science, I expect changing a date format in alteryx should not take an entire day.  but its his first 3 months in a professional job

&amp;#x200B;

B)  Do you think this could be a cultural/language issue where if I dot give firm deadlines he thinks it doesn't matter and will just take a super long time to get simple task done?

&amp;#x200B;

C) how would you handle someone like this?  my other employees are all producing substantially more work than he is due to this",26,0

As the title states, I have an opportunity to share my figures with an executive team that's multiple tiers above me. They have zero coding experience. How do I package my figure(s)?

Here's a copy of the figure I want to use:

('Time Series With Rangeslider' [https://plot.ly/python/time-series/](https://plot.ly/python/time-series/))

The code:

\`\`\`

**import** **plotly.graph\_objects** **as** **go**

**import** **pandas** **as** **pd**

df = pd.read\_csv(""[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/finance-charts-apple.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/finance-charts-apple.csv)"")

fig = go.Figure() fig.add\_trace(go.Scatter(x=df.Date, y=df\['AAPL.High'\], name=""AAPL High"", line\_color='deepskyblue')) fig.add\_trace(go.Scatter(x=df.Date, y=df\['AAPL.Low'\], name=""AAPL Low"", line\_color='dimgray')) fig.update\_layout(title\_text='Time Series with Rangeslider', xaxis\_rangeslider\_visible=**True**)

fig.show()

\`\`\`

Obviously I'm not going to share my entire script (that takes days to generate the .csv) and ask them to run it.

Is there a way I could wrap the above into a .exe or .html thing-y? Ideal scenario would be something I could attach in an email and they could just click on it.",0,0

I am deeply worried about automation personally and it is one of the driving reasons. On par with climate change that I dont want to have any children. My question is: Is it possible to start an open letter from people working on the automation of the most common jobs in America. If we are actually automating these jobs I think this could help build actual awareness and recognition from the media.  

Some say its not possible to see job loss from automation. That other work we cant imagine will take their place. I hate to sound pessimistic but I dont really see that happening and/or I dont see the call center worker or the truck driver being able to retrain for the jobs of the future.

I saw someone in a different sub suggest an open letter where professionals could sign in support of the fact that this is in fact happening. None of the political candidates are talking about this. This is as important as the climate, if we have 25% unemployment riots I think thats going to be as bad or worse than rising sea levels. Do you think this could get traction? Or am I totally off base, sorry Im not a professional just a guy worried about the future.

Granted, I am also majoring in Economics with a focus on econometrics, but I don't feel like I'll be prepared to take on the coursework expected of me in a DS or Statistics master's program. By the time I graduate on time, I'll have Calc 3, Linear Algebra, and 2 CS courses under my belt, but no classes in algorithms or probability/stats theory.  With a CS major at my university, however, I'll have all these courses and then some - having more doors open to me than DS. But, I am not sure if this is all really worth it for me in the end.

There was some interest in the Data Science networking event, so I'm happy to finally share the invite with you all!

Our group is designed for IT professionals who currently work in data science to share experiences with other SMEs in the same field. Bring your biggest complaints, issues, or frustrations to vent to the rest of the group. Often we find that some of us have faced the same problems!

No matter what industry youre in (though, lets be honest, there is not a lot of industry diversity in DC) data problems are usually pretty similar. So these events are for us to share our solutions with people outside of our typical echo chambers. Or at least to help each other discover workarounds.

And if we cant, then lets have a drink and complain about our problems anyway!

I hope you all can make it. And I hope that some of you can help me pull data from CRMs. (I hate HubSpot.)

I struggle with it every day too. This article tries to shed some light on the situation and tries to reason about the phenomenon.

At the end of the day, we are solving problems. There are many ways to solve a problem, more often than not we don't need state of the art results and if we do need to improve (optimise) our solutions that's a perfectly plausible new problem to have. 

So it is okay to not know most things. No one knows most things (don't believe in anyone who says otherwise). As long as you know the next step to take in solving a particular problem (more often than not, this next step is just googling), can think critically and can persevere until the problem is solved, then you are doing good.

Basically, players are running along circular track in sequential fashion, meaning the track is very narrow and a person can move only when the person in front of him has moved. This means the ordering of the players never change.

The goal is to keep track of how many players have crossed the finished line. The cycle repeats so after crossing the finish line a new lap starts.

The kicker is that there are hurdles at points along the track that can take effect randomly and last for a random amount (normally distributed) of time. When this happens, players behind the hurdle must wait until the hurdle go away. 

This is the gist of the problem. I used the runners analogy to make the problem easier to understand.

I need some advice on how to setup my code in Python. Like what kind of class you'd use, and what methods you would have in each class. This would help me get started.

It'll nice to know if there are easy ways to view this simulation on an animation.

Aspiring data scientist here.  I've got a bit of an interesting story. (Don't we all?)  I've recently entered the tech area as a 40 something after getting laid of from the mortgage industry.  It is not that big of a leap as I've always been a techie.  (Been using Ubunutu since 2005 because it was free and not so invasive of a ecosystem.) I'm currently working customer support for a hosting company which is awesome and I am learning tons!

So that is a brief background.  My question is, where do I start with learning the maths and statistics for data science?  Should I jump right in with something like, ""Elements of Statistical Learning by Hastie, Tibshirani, Friedman"" and backfill?  Or should I build a foundation first and go from there?  What I am thinking of doing is going through my recently found high school text book for pre-calc.  [Advanced Mathematics: Precalculus with Discrete Mathematics and Data Analysis](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1317500.Advanced_Mathematics) I guess the TL:DR is, is the above text book a good place to start building a base for data science maths?  Or should I just jump in and backfill on my knowledge.  Thanks!

Pre-Post Edit:

I guess in answering my own question, I should start with where I'm most knowledgeable in math?  I feel as it will not be too hard to get back into the swing of things in pre-calc as I really do enjoy math.  I also kinda feel like I should take it back to basic math and work from there as a full on refresher.  I was doing an [EdEx course](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-algebra-schoolyourself-algebrax-1) about a year ago that started from basic math and I think it went to Linear Algebra.  Anyways, I was just thinking out loud as I posted this.  I look forward to all your inputs!",4,2

The test is applied in two days, one for mathematics and the other for portuguese. The problem is, the data viz show that nobody has a grade less than 100 (the max is 400) unless those who didn't apply for some of the two days and then get a 0. Doing a simple linear regression (just for studying how to do those things in python) using the portuguese grade as the dependent variable gives me an intercept of 55.84 and a 0.69 for coefficient.

So, according to my data, if someone takes a 0 in the math test (didn't show up for taking the test), they can't have a grade less than 100 if they take the portuguese test, but the regression shows the opposite, beign that they will possibly take 55.84 in the portuguese test.

Can I interpret that my model isn't good for prediction but for inference? Or can I get a better result changing the 0 values to 100, the minimum grade for both days?",5,0

There are two pieces to the problem:

1) Determining the potential number of points downstream considering the redundancies built into the network. In some cases, if we have an interruption in one location, we can switch it to another path on the same segment, or use other segments to provide service to our customers.

2) Knowing the actual number of points downstream that have redundant service allows us to place devices to segment the network in the case of trouble in an optimized fashion.

There are so many complex pieces to this problem - and frankly I've never been faced with such a problem set. I'm not looking for a solution - just for research into similar problems. Even the name of this type of problem (since it seems to have its roots in engineering) I'm not exactly sure of.

We end up using them all. We keep separate teams of Python-oriented data scientists, Java and Scala Spark masters, and an army of devops to manage those siloed solutions.

Data scientists explore with [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). Then other teams of data engineers re-code the same logic and make it work at scale, or make it work with live streams using Spark. We go through that iteration again and again when a data scientist needs to change the logic or use a different data set for his/her model.

In addition to taking care of the business logic, we build clusters on Hadoop or Kubernetes or even both and manage them manually along with an entire CI/CD pipeline. The bottom line is that were all working hard, without enough business impact to show for it

What if you could write simple code in Python and run it faster than using Spark, without requiring any re-coding, and without devops overhead to address deployment, scaling, and monitoring?

I guess you may say Im a dreamer . Well I am a dreamer, but Im not the only one! This post will prove it is possible today using by [Nuclio](https://nuclio.io/) and [RAPIDS](https://rapids.ai/), a free, open- source data science acceleration platform incubated by NVIDIA.

Weve been collaborating closely with NVIDIA in the last few months to integrate RAPIDS with the Nuclio open source serverless project and [Iguazios](https://www.iguazio.com/) PaaS. Its now possible to deliver magnitudes faster data processing speeds and scalability with the SAME Python code, and with minimal operational overhead due to the serverless approach.

I will demonstrate the same widely popular use case of crunching live data comprised of Json-based logs. Ill perform some analytics tasks on it and dump the aggregated results to a compressed Parquet format for further queries or ML training. We will look at batch and real-time streaming (yes, real-time streaming with simple Python code). But first, an overview...

TLDR: Should I work as a research fellow for 2 years in ML or should I do a Masters in Data Science? (Finished bachelors in  non-DS related field; Aiming to secure a Data Scientist job)

I have a lot of passion on data science and I am hell bent on making it my career. I finished my bachelors (in biotechnology), but did a lot of biological data science works. My thesis focusses on machine learning on biological data. I have applied for a ML post-bachelor's fellowship and I aced the interview; confident that I will get the position. The tenure is 1-2 years. I am sure I will have co-authored and published atleast one paper in ML at the end of tenure.

But, my mentor asked me to try for Master's in Data Science because even though I did a fellowship, I will still be a Biotech graduate. Based on your experience, what do you suggest the most important in the job-getting process - research fellowship or a relevant Master's? I understand that if I have an impressive DS portfolio, I have a higher chance of getting a job. But I would like to know if lack of relevant Master's will be a red flag for my career path.

I am interested in a career in data science.

When my school sent me an offer letter, they offered me admission to the 2 year thesis option. And so I emailed the Statistics department and told them that they did a mistake and I would like to be considered for the coursework option.

But when the people around me found out that I changed from thesis to coursework, they all thought it was a huge mistake and a thesis will be so much better for me in the future when I start looking of jobs.

So far, I learned the basics just fine but my skill in Python and Tableau are still at level where I'm not confident that I can make an impressive enough project  to get me hired or even to volunteer for anything. 

I found data quest on an ad and I checked it out and it seems legit and it's also free. It's tempting but I don't wanna jump in without asking all of you if its as decent as it makes it out to be or if theres a better alternative (Free or not).

It isn't in all the rows, maybe 5% sporadically spread out in the dataset. I have a working solution, and I know that it's not always worth it to over-optimize, but is a learning project for me so I'm interested to know how the ""professionals"" would do it.

The data is historical dam level data for a city's reservoir system (multiple dams). The values include the following for each dam:

* Dates (which had problems but I have managed to fix them)
* Water level heights in meters
* Storage capacity in mega-litres
* Percentage capacity for that dam

Some of the dams also completely empty during the time period, so you can't just apply a threshold (i.e. fix if dam level &lt; 1000).  


The solution I came up with is to look for sharp discontinuities: I manually inspected the first 5 rows for errors (there are only \~50 columns so it's easy enough), and then used the average of each column in these 5 rows to get a baseline to compare to the row below. So if a cell suddenly drops by, say, &gt;100x compared to the average of the 5 cells above it, then that cell is broken and should be fixed. Then loop thorough the data set and compare each cell to the average of the 5 cells above it.

To fix a cell, you multiply it's value by 1000, add the value in the cell immediately to the right, and then shift all cells beyond it to the left (i.e. discarding the value you just added).  


This works, but looping through rows and columns in a data frame gives me a nervous eye twitch.  I guess sometimes it's inevitable? How would you fix it?

This isn't about where to start, but which topics this problem represents. I have plans to learn Data Science in it's entirety, but would like to pick a la carte for expediency:

Our plant reliability is poor. Much of the reason is that we have awful data on failures and costing. Anytime we spend money on equipment or services, its called a work order. For simplicity, we'll call these 'events'. These events have tons of checkboxes and drop downs that would make this post unnecessary if they were populated. Instead, all we may have in these events are a description, associated equipment, and maybe a long text field. We don't even know which of these events are failures and which aren't. What I'm looking to do is make a tool that looks through the text and predicts what the checkboxes should be. Here is an example using a car of what I'm trying to do

**What would be populated**

* *Title:* Vehicle's brakes making weird noises
* *Long Text:* Removed wheel and looked at brakes. Calipers are working properly, but brake pads are worn. Changed brake pads
* *Equipment:* Ford F-150 

**What we'd like to extract from above**

* *Breakdown?*: True
* *Failed Object Part*: Brake Calipers
* *Damage Mechanism*: Worn

In the above example, *Failed Object Part* is a list of possible items based on the *Equipment*. IE, if the equipment was an iPhone, Brake calipers shouldn't be a *Failed Object Part*.

&amp;#x200B;

   Right now, my radar is facing NLP and classification . ***First off, which data science topics does this problem encompass? Second, is there a way to make a model learn based on real time feedback from a user?*** As in, the model predicts for given record -&gt; user corrects if necessary -&gt; model updates based on feedback -&gt; repeat? I ask this because we have millions of these records and no test dataset to put this against

- What questions should I be asking TDI prior to accepting the offer?

- Whats been students experience with the current (i.e. previous 3 months) curriculum and quality of instructors? Ive read the blogposts referenced in older threads so no need to cite those again here. 

- What problems did you find with the program that you wouldnt have known about until after you entered?

I recently graduated from university with degrees in BI/analytics and accounting and now work in corporate finance/accounting for a large healthcare company (Ive done a co-op and 2 internships with this company during school as well). Although I began this role a few months ago, Im quickly realizing that corporate finance is not the path for me and my true passion lies in data science. Im curious to see if there is a way to transition from corporate finance to the data science track so that I may one day become a data scientist or similar type role.

During my schooling, I worked a lot with creating and managing databases, dealing with different data types, and a ton of SQL. I also have a ton of elementary statistics and data mining under my belt. I have a strong understanding of modeling techniques such as regression models/classification trees/ANOVA, and other techniques such as PCA/Factor analysis and cluster analysis as well. Through my schools analytics department, I also wrote a research paper on how logistic regression and other modeling techniques can be used to predict change in waist circumference to tailor fitness programs. I know there are many more modeling techniques to learn but I can learn them no problem. 

In terms of programming, Ive been using DataCamp for a couple years to learn R and Python. I love working on small, personal projects using python/pandas to import and manipulate and clean data, and using R to create models and visualize data (although Im working on learning more python so I can just use it for everything). I can also use data visualization tools such as Tableau and PowerBI really well.

Long story short, I love working with data and aside from a couple python programs I wrote to automate tedious work tasks, my job doesnt allow me to do anything data science related and it really makes me feel unfulfilled. Im trying to network within my company and find a more data science-oriented role. I also think about waiting a couple years and going for a masters in operations research, but Im unsure as to whether I should switch jobs to a BI data analyst role if that would make me more marketable. Im curious to see what the best Avenue is for getting on the right path? If anyone has experienced anything similar, I would much appreciate any help on this.

The book mentions the bias of the test error estimate will be low with LOOCV since you are using almost all the data to train.

Does ""high variance of test error estimate"" mean if I take ANOTHER dataset of size n, the test error with LOOCV will probably be significantly different? Are we talking about estimating the test error for the models trained using the dataset in question, or ""all"" dataset of size n?

I live in boston and plan to stay here for the considerable future if that is relevant, but really I am just trying to see what types of industries are out there so I can try to learn about them and decide which to try to get into for a next job. 

I know in electrical engineering (my degree) there are a finite number of categories to go into like space/defense, automotive, etc.  I suspect it is the same with data scientists.  

My Professional interests are: 

1. Machine Learning Application (Specifically Tabular and Timeseries Data) 
2. Big Data Machine Architecture (I use AWS at my job but am open to other clouds) 
3. Working with business people and putting together kick-ass powerpoints, interactive visualizations, and dashboards. 

Ultimate goal is to be someone who can architects a high level solution to a complex problem/manages the tunnel between highly technical people and highly business oriented people.

Questions

1. What are the broad industries in data science? Preferably including the type of data that is common in those industries
2. What are the broad ""paths"" that a data scientist can take during their career? Preferably including rankings of how much you would get to work with data and rankings of pay (not sure if that is how it works but might as well ask :))

When dealing with generalization across domains, however, causal knowledge can be valuable,and in fact necessary even in predictive or classification tasks.

&gt; The idea is simple; causal knowledge is essentially knowledge about the mechanisms that remain *invariant* under change. Suppose we learn a probability distribution *P(x, y, z)* in one environment and we ask how this probability would change when we move to a new environment that differs slightly from the former. If we have knowledge of the causal mechanism generatingP,we could then represent where we suspect the change to occur and channel all our computational resourcest o re-learn the local relationship that has changed oris likely to have changed, while keeping all other relationships invariant.

I want to eventually transition to a DS carreer. I have a BEng in Computer Engineering and I'm working in the Public Sector right now - unfortunately no related work experience to DS.

What I believe I need, is well organized material, so I can study at my own pace - and at the right time get some interviews and hopefully a full time DS job. I have reviewed many job postings in order to get an idea about what are the necessary skills and qualifications for that kind of carreer.

So, after some online research, I have concluded(?) to edX, Coursera, Datacamp and Udacity. 

As I've already written, I prefer well organized, greatly paced material and the reason is that I have little free time and a family.

A few of the courses (as I reviewed the outlines) looked very interesting and deep on their own (like the John Hopkins University course in coursera and the Harvard and Microsoft ones in edX).

As a result, while I value academic rigor and depth, I prefer sheer employability.

Originally I had the idea and drive to start an MSc in Data Science or related discipline, and proceed from there. The downside is that an MSc would not give me directly employable skills (which I need to make the transition smoothly) and also it'd probably be both more expensive and more demanding (study/classes-wise).

Am I in the right path? Could you suggest a course of study and action for someone in my position (full time job and family)?",13,1

I've got an offer from another company and I'd really love to get an advice from more experienced people than I am.

Current company - QSR corporation with moderate data illiteracy (for example there is delivery service and we are not geocoding destination adresses to do any geospatial analytics so the illiteracy part is mostly on business people). I started working last year as BI intern and now for two months I'm Data Scientist (my boss created for me a separate postition), now we are building new data infrastructure on Azure so I'll have an opportunity to put solutions into the production using Azure services just by myself and generally get good knowledge in cloud operations. Also my boss is good in terms of mentoring me more in the business side of data job where I mostly keep improving myself in technical stuff and I have the team of BI engineers who do data integrations from different sources to current DWH. But sometimes I kinda get demotivated and frustrated when I'm expected to get meaningful predictions even when I say it's impossible due to lack of data, granularity of data etc.

Offer - smaller SaaS company that provides chat service on websites so it'll be mostly analytics around product and customers, data infrastructure is rather poor. One MySQL db, data scattered around analytics software that they use, Tableau data sets, no cloud infrastructure for data and some etls in pentaho. So I'd mostly do data engineering + modeling just by myself, or in the first place setup infrastructure and then do DE + DS and in smaller organization things would just faster and I'd feel that what I do really has an impact because people aren't that single minded/used to old methods like in big corporation.

Guys, what would you suggest me to do? Stay where I'm learn as much as possible and after 2 years start looking at some different place? Also I feel resigning from position that was created for me is a dick move especially when there isn't anyone to replace me at the moment.

Hi everyone!

[Few months ago](https://new.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/bmujjg/made_a_new_notification_tool_and_im_looking_for/) I released [Notify17](https://notify17.net/), a tool to generate mobile notifications from simple web requests.

I think redditors of this sub may be interested in using it when dealing with models training, or any similar long lasting tasks, where you need to wait a long time between each iteration.

The most basic concept would be that, as soon as a model training finishes, you can invoke a [function](https://notify17.net/recipes/python/) to let yourself know that the event occurred, and get the notification on your phone/browser:

```python
from notify17 import n17_raw
n17_raw(""RAW_API_KEY"", 'Model training finished')
```

I'm looking for feedback from people in multiple fields, because I believe that Notify17 could be useful in many multiple scenarios than just backend development.

I'd love to know if anyone of you finds this tool to be useful for the data science field and/or what could be added/changed to make it worth the use for you all.

P.s. also a [MATLAB](https://notify17.net/recipes/matlab/) and [LUA](https://notify17.net/recipes/lua/) examples are around. In any case, a `cURL` request is enough to trigger any notification.

Thanks a lot, I'm here to answer any question about this post!

Ill try to give you as much detail as possible, and few concerns/questions  I have. (I have an edtech website where we provide personalized educational ressources based on the studentsneeds and information).

The aim of the model is to predict from a 1,500 input vector a 100 output vector. I currently have around 2,700 examples (I know this is not a lot, but I obtain 5-10 more everyday from real life users.) 

Due to the nature of the data, I was first thinking of using a seq2seq model, but I dont have a lot experience with them. Is it ok to have big 1,500 sequence encoded and then decoded into a 100 output vector?

Can I /should I use PCA or another decomposition technique to decrease the input size out the output vector? Is it possible to use a seq2seq model on a pca transformation?

For more context, the 100 vector target output actually represents an embedding of a piece of educational content. These embeddings capture the nature of the material and similar ressources have close cosine similarity. 

I know neural nets can easily predict have output layers of 100 nodes but Im not sure if you can do the same with other traditional machine learning algos like randomforest. I dont want to frame the problem as a classic classfication problem because there are over 200 pieces of content and thant number grows everyday. What I need is the ability to predict an embedding vector which allows us to (through a cosine similarity search) select a useful piece of content for the user.

Check out ZDNets [series of articles](https://www.zdnet.com/search/?q=cloud+outages) detailing the outages. The iCloud outage caused disruptions to the likes of YouTube, Snapchat, and Gmail, among others.

iClouds failure also affected all their third-party apps and ApplePay, which resounded globally. We have quickly embraced the cloud as more resilient than on-premise infrastructure, so this news is sobering. It also shows the vulnerability of the IT infrastructures, both cloud-based and on-premise, that power much of our software-dependent world  a world that now includes entertainment and personal, as well as professional connections.

IT infrastructure encompasses all related components, including network, security, storage, operating systems, links to hubs, and computers. Each component has numerous subcomponents, such as memory, central processing units, etc. On top of that, cloud adoption and virtualization add more intricacy. Software-defined networks make fast and automatic infrastructure changes, making it harder to track which workload resides on which virtual machine and correlate them to the physical server. Measuring the impact of one machines performance at any given moment becomes a serious challenge! 

In this digital age, companies (and people!) are dependent on good infrastructure to power their critical functions like communication, financing, etc. Downtime is costly and damaging to a business. This puts increased pressure on companies of all sizes to reconsider their infrastructure-monitoring strategies.

More specific to my question. 

I'm a huge movie-buff. That is my number one passion in life, and the one consistent answer to the question ""what do you wanna be when you grow up?"" (A director) The thing is, I just couldn't convince myself to go into acting/directing because of the uncertain nature of the job. I watch a lot of movies, and I've taken courses during my undergrad related to photography, art history, etc. I'm very much an artistic person (I write a lot, I used to draw, I used to dance), but I had to push those interests aside to pursue something that was in demand. I should've gone after my passions, but I didn't and it's too late to start now because I'm way too deep into it.

The next best thing would be to find a way to mix these all up. I did an internship recently (finishing up) as a data analyst and I find the work interesting, but I am so not interested in the business. I just don't have the motivation to learn about the business and the people who use the product, because I've never liked this product. I'm sorry I can't exactly say what it is, because I'm still in it and I don't want to risk anything. Just know that the business, for example Finance (it's not at all related to finance) is just not my thing. My thing is movies.

Now, I've realized that the same type of analytics could be used by services like Netflix, and I'm pretty sure they do use it. At the very least, their recommendation systems are using the same type of algorithms and analytics. But, I was wondering if any major movie studios (Warner Bros, for example) decides if a movie should be released based on analytics? Do they at all use data to make decisions? If so, what does the data even look like? Can someone with my background (Engineering and Math) get into the film industry as an analyst? Because it seems like a good idea, I just don't know if it happens and what the roles are. I've never seen a job posting for this either.",12,11

I worked in underwriting before I graduated.  My company paid for my math BA and I was on track do actuary work.  Life happened and I became a teacher instead.  While I was teaching, our local University had a grant for math teachers to get an MA.  I taught high school kids Calculus and Stats for college credit through AP and IB.

I got sick and was medically retired from teaching 3 years ago.  I was only 38 when I retired, so my pension is not enough to live independently.   But it keeps a roof over my head.  To live comfortably on my own I need another $1000 a month.

I know I could probably do tutoring.  But I need the flexibility to work when I feel good and rest when I need it. It would also be wonderful to work from home. I'm researching some possible freelance work and I like Data Science the best.  

I am naturally curious and self-taught.  When I started as a receptionist in insurance, I created a database for the 500 person office (that's what got me the degree opportunity).  While I was teaching, I did all my own student data tracking in Excel.  I developed a system to customize the review assignments and prioritize review problems based on their test results.  I programmed the TI calculators.  Since retiring, I wrote my own website and host it from home on a linux server that I built from parts.  I can use gimp and inkscape.  I learned python and wrote a ML program with keras that was 87% accurate.  My point is that I don't have much relevant industry experience, but I feel confident that I can teach myself anything.

After reading other posts on this sub, I understand that freelance data work is challenging.  I feel like my choice is to either hustle to do tutoring work or hustle to freelance.  I would much prefer to work at home alone on my computer than traveling all over the county tutoring at kids homes.  

Two questions:
1)  What kind of DS work am I a good fit for?
2)  How reasonable is it expect between $12,000 and $30,000 working part time?  (If I earn over $30,000 I lose my pension.)

I have a question I have been thinking about for a bit and I would like to see if I am missing something or if there are any additional thoughts on this our there.

*Situation*:

We need to re-develop a pricing algorithm for a digital product. In essence, we buy said digital product and then re-sell it. These products have roughly five to ten distinct features. Currently, the price is determined by three features but I think there might be room for improvement. It is static apart from a discount scheme that is applied if a product was not sold for a set amount of time.

To solve this, we can draw from a data-set of roughly 200k previous products including their past sales. I feel that I could benefit from running a linear regression on all features with the sales number as the dependent variable (just to see what drives sales). However, most products are only sold a handful of times. This should make it hard to produce significant results, I assume. In addition, I would like to see whether I can see an effect of the price on the sales numbers adjusted for the features.

Given that we have such a large number of products, we can do split tests relatively well. The best idea I can come up with right now is to develop a couple relatively arbitrary pricing algorithms (arbitrary in the sense that they are driven mostly by qualitative hypotheses if the linear regression mentioned above does not produce significant results as assumed) and see how those prices translate to sales. Still, I feel that there might be better ideas out there and I would be excited for any hints (literature, buzz words, formulated ideas, anything).",11,5

They basically told me my whole job consist of ""doing ML"" on my jupyter, nothing else. Basically kaggle-type of projects. So I asked more about it and they end up telling me that they have a whole IT team with IT guys, data engineers etc supporting the team. If I need anything, I ""just"" have to send a request.

The project I am working on is predicting fantasy points for National Football League (NFL) players on a week-to-week basis. Some of the features I am using to predict fantasy points include the total points scored and the spread set yb professional sports books. For example, if a team is favored by 7.5 points, that team's spread is read ""minus 7.5"". Looking at a real world example, in week 1 of the upcoming 2019 NFL season, the Patriots are a home favorite of 6.5 points vs. the Steelers. Thus, the Patriots line is -6.5 and the Steelers line is +6.5.

I plan on using regression to tackle this problem. Therefore, to convert the ""home team"" and ""favorite"" to numbers, I plan on using 0s and 1s (i.e. 0 for away team, 1 for home team and 0 for ""underdog"" and 1 for ""favorite"").

My two questions are: 

1. Is the above 0s and 1s strategy ok to use to modify these qualitative features?
2. Is it ok to feed regression models negative numbers. In the context of the problem, spreads are commonly listed in terms of the favorites (and thus negative) and I want to make sure this is ok.

I want to get into more data science career. I see that data science still deals with linear and nonlinear regressions. It also deals with time series; all of which econometrics have dealt with. However, I have heard that traditional econometrics is not as applicable anymore due to the fact econometrics is used to test models and focuses on causal inference. I spoke with a data scientist and he said that now there's programs that can even choose the model for you depending on what you want to test for so you don't even need to spend time trying to determine that.

I've also heard that even with time series, some of the Machine Learning tools do a way better job than our traditional ARIMA or VAR models.

 Also, ML can usually handle much more variables than what econometrics do. I even remember in school, we typically only looked at about 10-15 variables at MOST when we did our regressions.

Although the data scientists did say that also due to his background in economics, it has given him a strong understanding in statistics, which is pretty crucial in this field.

445,2019-8-16,2019,8,16,1,cqs6qr,Is this the optimal solution? (distributing emails across 3 time periods),https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/cqs6qr/is_this_the_optimal_solution_distributing_emails/,supra95,1565886532,"This is a simplified version of a problem i'm facing at work:

&amp;#x200B;

Say there are 3 distinct periods of the day where I can email someone (A, B, C), and my success metric is whether or not they click a link (1, 0). The constraints on the problem are:

* I have 150k emails I can potentially contact each day
* I can email a maximum of 50k in A, 60k in B and 40k in C
* I can only contact each email once per day

&amp;#x200B;

The solution I have so far involves building three classifiers for periods A, B and C predicting the probability of clicking (P(A), P(B), P(C)) based on historic data of emails sent in those three periods.

&amp;#x200B;

I think that I want to find a way of fitting 150k emails into bins A, B and C such that the sum of the probabilities across all 3 bins is maximized. I guess this is my objective function, Z = SUM(P(A)) + SUM(P(B)) + SUM(P(C))

&amp;#x200B;

Say I build my three classifiers, and get a dataset like this:

&amp;#x200B;

|Email|P(A)|P(B)|P(C)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|0.025|0.015|0.069|
|2|0.017|0.012|0.071|
|3|0.045|0.045|0.022|
|...|...|...|...|

&amp;#x200B;

Would it be correct to gather and rank order my dataset (in descending probability of clicking) like so:

|Email|Period|Probability|
|:-|:-|:-|
|522|C|0.113|
|1079|C|0.109|
|104|C|0.108|
|522|B|0.108|
|2956|A|0.107|
|522|A|0.106|
|...|...|...|

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have a table with 450k rows corresponding to 150k emails, where each email is only contactable once per day, and the constraints on A, B and C of 50k, 60k and 40k apply, so I would do:

* Starting from row 1 and progressing down the table, place the emails into bins A, B or C
* If an email has been placed into a bin previously (e.g. row 4, row 6), delete this row
* Similarly, if a row suggests placing the email in a bin that is already full, delete this row
* Go through the table again , starting from the new row 1, until all emails have been placed in a bin

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I think i'm most of the way there, but I just can't put the final pieces together and would really appreciate some feedback. Is this a linear programming problem?

&amp;#x200B;

Something about my solution feels sub-optimal... For example, maybe email 522 would be better off being contacted in periods A or B, because the 'added benefit' of contacting it in period C (which is generally the highest probability) is so small, whereas other emails may see a huge benefit from being contacted in C?",10,3

Each patient may have 150 sensors and various other meta data.  There are sensor data are in hdf5/npz, timestamp data associated with the readings in hdf5/npz and sensor locations and meta data in csvs.  I've currently setup processing infrastructure that abstracts all of the complex processing of the files away from the user so they can ask database style queries.  I'm basically building a database by hand as a way to buy our group time until we have the bandwidth to move to a proper database and I now have that time.

&amp;#x200B;

Example queries

1. What is the distribution of electrodes across patients?
2. What is the distribution of electrode values for a patient? across all patients?
3. Return all of a patient's data for their first day of recording or all days
4. Return sampled data from a patients first day of recording or all days
5. What percentage of patients have specific meta data fields?
6. What percentage of patients have specific meta data fields and sensor patterns?

\- Some of the above questions will be answered in python but gives an idea of the type of query required to return that data.

\- Each patients data is about 1 TB

\- We have 100 or so patients and more coming

\- Very important - some users are not as technical so SQL style queries would be helpful if possible (I can also just create boiler plate code and example queries for ppl but this is more of a hassle)

But school gave me an overview of several topics. 

Data structures and algorithms class taught me the sorting algorithms, recursion, evolved recursion(dynamic programming), and the space-time trade off for various data structures...but I only had a few assignments to internalize the several concepts I was taught. 

Preparing for interviews and learning how to code these concepts taught me so much more. For one, I had to implement all of these from scratch and I practiced them much more than once or twice(unlike in school). I was also exposed to many more algorithms thanks to geeksforgeeks and the interview questions I had. 

My initial data science class taught me how to query from apis, create visualizations, some linear/logistic regression and use Hadoop for a bigram word counts. 

But studying for interviews taught me these same concepts in much more depth and gave me much more muscle memory. 

Same with sql- my school never had a proper class on sql- we had one group project for a client where we dabbled in sql a little

It was only after practicing sqlzoo and hackerrank that I actually even truly understood sql. 

I look back and ask why. Its simple- I learn better when answering quiz like questions on several topics over and over again and writing code for the same algorithms several times. School doesnt give you that opportunity to fail your way to understanding the material.

Once I have the model in place, I also want to determine how we can increase the odds of attendance for a given prospect. My idea is to create a few ""what-if"" scenarios where I add an additional phone call, an additional campus visit, or email. I would then score each of those ""What-if"" records to determine what their new likelihood of enrollment would be. Using those, I would calculate which action will provide the greatest lift for a given prospect and provide that as a suggested action to the enrollment office.

Is this a reasonable approach? Are there any other good methods for doing this type of thing?",10,2

I've been lingering around for a while but I might need some advice. My background is in programming (SQL, Rails, C#) and I'd like to get some insight from data to help to guide our product, marketing, and business in general.

We have a decent and clean dataset available in SQL database. I'm trying to answer questions like this:

* Does customer behaviour imply that this new feature is very likely to be successful? 

* How efficient is this marketing channel compared to other ones?

* How is this cohort doing compared to another?

* How long does it take go through our stages of funnel in general?

* What type of behaviour does lead to most valuable customers?

* Is there a difference between a customer who onboarded within the first three days to an onboarding within a week?

and along these lines. At the moment, I just hack together some exploratory code. Grouping things together. Counting. Selecting. Averaging. Putting into buckets. Real hacky way in SQL and Rails console over the database. I don't put any rigour to it and I go by a [feeling  kind of](https://ricebits.weebly.com/uploads/8/2/8/2/82822530/260d5532-f1f2-4fe3-87cf-1c35dd19c13f-6442-00000883e64dbbd6.png).

What would be the best and quickest way to upskill so I can:

* answer those questions with confidence and quickly
* communicate the answers to the team (sometimes visual might be better to number)
* ask more interesting and valuable questions

As a data scientist, I got tired of importing `pandas as pd`, `numpy as np`, ... over and over again. However, I still wanted to make my imports explicit so that I follow the Zen of Python ""explicit is better than implicit"". That's why at 8080 Labs, we developed an open source package that brings the best of the two worlds together.

The workflow is as follows:

* 1) you import all typical conventions with ""from pyforest import \*"" - yes this is implicit and not what we want. But bear with me.
* 2) you write your typical notebook and you can use conventions like ""pd.read\_csv"" right away. The namespace won't be cluttered. Only the most popular conventions are imported. Also, pyforest only imports the convention when you actually use it. So, it lazy-imports. If you don't use a convention, it won't be imported at all.
* 3) you export the auto-written **explicit import statements** via ""active\_imports()"" so that you can copy them and enter them at the top of your script. E.g. ""import pandas as pd""

The result is that your workflow won't be interrupted by writing the same import conventions over and over again by hand. Instead, the machine will generate the used import statements, so you still have explicit statements in your script when sharing it with your colleagues.

You can read more about pyforest on the repo: [https://github.com/8080labs/pyforest](https://github.com/8080labs/pyforest)

**What is your opinion about this?**

**Which import conventions did you use last week?**

**Where do you see risks? And how could those be mitigated?**

PS: in case that this reminds you of pylab, hold back your prejudices because none of the problems with pylab exist with pyforest.

Background: I have a Master's degree in Analytics and I currently work as a Data Analyst at a small e-commerce company in Texas. The company sells various household items through its online store. I was hired into this position straight out of grad school 2 years ago. I am the only data person at the company and up until this point I have been creating Tableau dashboards and ad-hoc reports mostly. Simply speaking, I have been a reporting guy at my company for the last two years. 

The Problem: Lately, my boss who is a director at the company has been asking me to do more than just reporting and creating dashboards. He wants me to do predictive analytics and come to him with any suggestions on improving the business. The problem is I am not really sure how. I am not really a Data Scientist and I don't have any other experienced data person at my company to guide me in the right direction. Also my boss wants me to just look at the data that we have and find any problems/patterns and give suggestions. I am not really sure if this is the right approach as opposed to our functional managers coming to me with their problems that I can try to solve with data.

Please advise: What should I do? I really want to transition from reporting to machine learning and given my circumstances I want to do it fast, otherwise I am at risk of getting fired within the next 6-8 months. What's the fastest way I can implement analytics/machine learning at my company to derive maximum value out of it for the business? Could you suggest any projects? Also, I have started doing the [fast.ai](https://fast.ai) deep learning course. Do you think it's the best way for me to implement ML at my company in the shortest possible time?

I help my dad run his shop and in the last year we have gathered loads of sales data from everything that goes through the till. I want to try and run a piece of analysis to see which products (first just a combination of two) sell well together. 

Our system essentially stores the data in a data base (which let's me use SQL to pull the information out) and it has the following headers:

\- Row ID

\- Product Name

\- SKU (aka product ID)

\- Selling Price (in GBP)

\- Selling Date (as a timestamp)

\- Unique sale number (each sale is recorded with a unique number so you can always pull out individual sales using this)

\- Operator ID (who was on the till at the time).

&amp;#x200B;

I want to come up with a way that will let me pull out which two products sell well together. I can do this easily if I was to go via the route of say:

\- Query 1: Select a list of the top 10 best sellers.

\- Query 2: See which maybe top 10 products always sell in the same basket as these items

&amp;#x200B;

However what this just does is tell me the items that sell well with the top products, and chances are we already know this from experience.

TLDW: I do not have a computer science background, and going into my 2nd year of grad school I am trying to completely pivot to data science/bioinformatics for ecology. How realistic is this goal considering all I know how to do at the moment is beginner bash/R scripting and very base level multivariate statistics? Does scientific coding (sequence analysis) go hand in hand with software engineering (improving how we processes, analyze and query sequence data) or should I focus on one or the other?

Okay, so I am a PhD grad student now going into my 2nd year. my first research summer was rough af, and the project I am working on is not progressing as planned for a couple reasons. 1) i hate it and I hate wet lab work and 2) Im not good at it haha! What I am decent at though is data analysis. Last year I picked up on command line scripting and R relatively well, to my surprise actually because Its what I was most nervous about learning when I starting this program, yet is essential to the research my lab does. Now I honestly would like to shift to data science completely, because I like it a lot more than what I am doing and because I am having more success with this as opposed to my microscopy and sample processing.

The questions I have for this subbreddit are

1) Is it a realistic goal to pivot to bioinformatics/data science completely and still finish my PhD within the next 4 years? Does scientific coding (sequence analysis) go hand in hand with software engineering (improving how we processes, analyze and query sequence data) or should I focus on one or the other?

2) I am getting so confused as to the subcategories and the distinction between data science/bioinformatics/computational biology/computational biostatistics/scientific programming/etc etc etc! They all seem to overlap and when I look up the toolkit or skillset a data scientist should have it seems like I have to know how to do everything! I made a complete list and it is at the bottom of the post. How do these skills group together? Which of these skills overlap and so you just have to know one of the other? 

3) Where does machine learning and algorithms fit in all this? Do I need to go back and do some math shit to get this or can I pick up on some r/Python packages and apply these to my research and not know the nitty gritty?

Thanks for reading my post and any suggestions!

TL;DR:  
Two people tried to follow the beat of different songs by pressing spacebar while listening to it.  
We collected collected series of 20 beat timings (measured in ms between beats), 500 of them per person over about 2-3h.  
The challenge is to classify who a given beat timing series belong to.  
We implemented a tensorflow model with a CNN (full model and code in Kaggle), but got only \~55% accurary.

We would like your help to understand how to increase our accuracy. Is the problem:

1. We need more data, or parts of the data is flawed (then we'll just listen to some more songs and collect it)
2. Our model-structure is off (then we'd love to know how we could improve it)
3. It's impossible to accurately classify this kind of data since it is not distinct enough
4. Something else

What I've done so far: extensive use of excel with pivot tables and many other functions that I had to learn from a coworker or from the internet, use of Access to get tables of data and minor SQL queries, use of DBeaver to write more complex code that Access can't handle (Although 99% of the code has come from various internet resources that I've had to string together). I think a bigger, upcoming project is to create some kind of predictive model for the purchasing department that says ""on this day, you should have X amount of inventory / you should buy X amount of inventory"". Does anyone have any predictive modeling books to recommend? Any general advice on where I should start?  


I should mention that I would like to transition into data science at some point. I have a Master's in Math (Focused primarily in algebra, had a few stat courses, 2 programming courses), curious about a master's in data science, or just learning as much as possible from various resources.

I came across a case study for an interview. The dataset contains number of app downloads over a period 65 days labelled as follows: First 40 days are normal days, next 20 days the company ran an ad campaign on TV and the last 5 days are post campaign days. The question is to check if the ad campaign has any effect. When plotted, this data is found to be cyclical. My approach was to use the first 40 days to build a time series model based on first 40 days and use it to predict the downloads for the next 20 days(i.e; simulate how the downloads would be had there been no ad campaign) and compare these values with actual available data with a t-test. Is this approach correct? Would appreciate any suggestions.",36,100

This is done by comparing the similarity of their profile to diabetic people and to healthy people (using Logistic Regression).

Right now I just need to move this function RStudios, where I'd like to use Shiny to make a Web App Dashboard where these parameters can be tuned in real time, to see how the diabetes risk indicator value changes.

I'm glad I've found a reddit for data science discussion, it's great to read through. 

To give a bit of background, I have an MEng in Civil &amp; Structural Engineering and been working in London almost 3 years after graduation.

There are many things i'm not happy with my job, but specifically I've been really disappointed with the lack of creativity in Structural Engineering (Buildings) combined with engineers being really undervalued (salary) in the UK. The progress towards much senior positions is also difficult even if you can show that you are capable. The work we do as engineers is done with high responsibility with lives at stake throughout the lifetime of the building, but I feel this has been long forgotten. 

So I've been thinking of alternatives, and Data Science appears to be something that is at the creative side, still uses maths, coding (which I realise is required everywhere now to learn) and sounds rewarding in London.

I have an opportunity to do MSc Data Science at City, University of London. But, I just have this nagging feeling on whether I haven't done enough research to understand if Data Science is really a suitable role for me.

I've done Maths, Physics, Further Maths and Economics for A-Levels. I also used Matlab during university but it wasn't really in-depth or for data analysis. I have started to learn Python and my first impression is that it is quite fun to do when it works. 

My personal skills would be:
*Highly numerate
*High attention to detail
*Natural curiosity to really understand and question things
*Good at report writing and average at presenting (although I don't enjoy writing reports or presenting)
*Keen to learn programming

However, I must confess that I did not enjoy statistics during A-Levels (S1). It was one which I thought I wasn't going to use in the 'real world' (irony). So, I feel like contradicting myself in going to Data Science if I didn't enjoy doing statistics before. But, I've thought that if I learn it properly, and use it in context then it should get interesting over time. Also, with what i've read online, there could be more opportunities/roles that may involve less applied statistics like Machine Learning Engineer. I also realise that these other roles would require me to self-teach Computer Science modules, so am I just being too optimistic and jumping into the unknown?",8,7

It's been amazing, I've had fun cleaning data, making dashboards, and creating forecasts. I also get along really well with the rest of the data science team. Yesterday, I was given an offer to join the company full time. I'm ecstatic, but there is one issue. I've been offered a role in ""customer success"" as a ""customer success analyst."" I'm happy to interact with clients and help solve their requirements, but I don't want that to be my whole job. While the company has assured me that I'd get to do data science as well, I'm afraid that eventually I'd get typecast into ""customer success"" and that I would eventually become a glorified customer support and sales agent.

What can I do to avoid this? Will negotiating the job title help? Also, is there anything else I should watch out for during negotiations this Monday? For context, I am an economics major with a minor in math from a local university, and I will be the fourth member of the data science team. I have been using Python, Tableau, and SQL so far.",16,7

Workforce Analyst here, I manage the labour forecasting for retail sites using a sound method that seems to be standard across the industry in the UK. (product \* service\_time) +/- constraints. 

Whenever I search for ML/AI/DL topics regarding workforce I'm almost always shown answers/blogs regarding contact/call centres and forecasting. 

So I wonder if any of the experts here have any expierence in demand/workforce forecasting using ML or more advanced statistical techniques. 

The workforce I forecast is accounts for a mix of service and customer facing activity. Service: as in making a sandwhich/coffee and customer facing as in selling a choclate bar/stacking shelves. 

I've only broached the python eco system on github/SO but happy to look at anything in R.

from a data persective assume we have access to : 

no of customers walking in to the stores. (85% accuracy)

no of transcations by site by day.

a product level forecast given to us by another team.

a table in SQL that houses all the amount of time it takes to execute each task.

Usually when doing web-scraping Id just pull the data into pandas dataframes, but theres quite a huge amount for this project. Im thinking of setting up a SQL instance to store everything in, but Im not sure how to do so.

In essence, my question is:

1) how can I set up a SQL instance to store data from a web-scrape? 

2) how can I ingest the scrape data into the database?

3) Ive run ML on data stored in Jupyter and Spyder notebooks, but nothing at this scale (I think it will crash my computer). How can I run ML at this scale?

Long story short, I'm a mechanical engineer that is not happy with standard engineering work. I have 2 years of experience with some design, some project management, and a large programming/data analysis project. I loved that last project, as well as the classes I took on the subject while in school. However, that project has been finished and is long gone. 

I enjoyed the design work too, just not to the level of the data analysis project. What I currently do, and will most likely do for the foreseeable future, is perform inspections on pieces of equipment at my plant. That is the extent of my technical responsibilities. 

I wasn't quite ready or aware of the sheer volume of administrative responsibilities that engineers have, and I'm fine with doing it to some extent. However, my current position is in an industry that could very well be the most regulated industry in the country, and it makes the amount of paperwork, updating procedures, documenting EVERYTHING I do, etc. take up 90% of my time throughout the year. Followed by the remaining 10% being the inspections I mentioned previously. Not a lot of brainpower required for all of that, and I feel as if my time in school was wasted.

All that being said, I certainly have a strong interest in data, and am curious how much of your time working in the data industry is spent on administrative tasks, and how much is actually spent on technical tasks.

Thank you so much!

Tl;dr: What percentage of your day is spent on mind-numbing administrative issues, and what percentage is spent on technical work?",8,3

I have a dataset where I have Y(t) and several time dependent explanatory variable A(t),...,F(t... etc 

My goal is to measure the general impact of a change in any of the explanatory time series A(t),...,F(t) on Y(t)

From googling around it seems the model I want is a **Vector Autoregressive model** which allows me to relate Y(t) to its own history as well has the history of each explanatory time series.  (sounds great)

However, i have one extra complication:  I have groups in my data.  So I have a Y(t) for say ""Spain"" and another Y(t) for ""Germany"" and the same set of explanatory variables for each. 

At the end of the day I want to be able to say ""what is the general impact of F(t-1) on Y(t), what is the impact of F(t-2) on Y(t) **irrespective of grouping.  How do i go about handling this?** 

Do I run a VAR model for each of the groups and then average the betas among the groups to form a group-invariant beta? sounds stupid and probably also messes up confidence intervals on them.  

Any help would be majorly appreciated!!!",5,1

I wanted to share a library called [Tune](https://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tune.html) that my collaborators and I built at UC Berkeley for making hyperparameter tuning easier and faster. 

## Some cool features of Tune:

* Tune offers state of the art algorithms including ASHA, BOHB, and Population-Based Training. 
* You can scale a Tune hyperparameter search from a single machine to a large distributed cluster without changing your code. 
* Supports any machine learning framework, including Scikit-Learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras.

There's a [medium blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/fast-hyperparameter-tuning-at-scale-d428223b081c) if you want to learn more!

One thought was to show percentage of improvement compared to month zero. However, in Case 2 (patient 2) we have an initial score of `0`, followed by an increase in the score (worsening of the symptom). This results in `-inf`.

I am currently in the middle of figuring out what I should do next year after my graduation.

Currently, I am finishing up my last courses of my Honours in statistical sciences, will graduate with Class 1. 

I have 2 years of work experience as a part time Python / Java developer and my strengths are in software development. (Haskell, R, SQL, doing online Hadoop courses ATM). 

I have two options: I was lucky enough to secure a job at one of the big 4 accounting firms as part of their Risk Analytics team, commencing next year. However, I feel like if I want to be more professional in the field of data analytics and go into machine learning/AI (which is what I have been dreaming of), I would probably need a Masters if not a PhD.

I have contacted two universities regarding the options/to hear more about the courses they offer, but they've been unhelpful and told me they'll just call me back at December when my grades actually come out. Apparently they can't disclose a lot of information.

So, professionals and practitioners of the field, what do you think a better option will be? Go straight into a Masters program then come out ready to roll? Or gain some more professional experience and go study masters when I hit a wall in my career path?

Thank you so much!",1,1

I'm just starting to learn python and I have a few questions. 

I'm currently a junior data analyst and want to go deeper into data analyst or even potentially data science role. I know that I'm going to have to create a portfolio for Python but I'm not really sure how it works. 

For example, I got my current job showcasing my self taught Tableau skills using my visualizations and then a blog explaining some of the data in the viz. Sometimes breaking down the viz and explaining my findings for the problem that I solved. This was done by using a WordPress blog (my site), my tableau public portfolio (embedded in site), and screen grabs from tableau desktop. 

Here is my python dilemma. I know I have to use GitHub to publish my code. But can I use GitHub to create a mini-website and then post the actual code as well as describing the problem/use case,  the project in detail step by step, and the results from libraries like Matplot or Numpy? or is just plain code enough. 

Also for some python data science projects do you need a front end so that the end-user can use your project?

Rookie here with no senior people to go to at work and I'm the only Python guy.  I'm only posting this because I have no mentors out here in the boonies.  If my naivete triggers anyone, I apologize.

___
**Background:**
I work at an organization of ~1000 people.  No direct pipeline to our data.  Lots of red tape.  It'll get better as we evolve our data team, but for now this is the scenario.  All my prep has been done in Jupyter NB, I work with CSV extracts - no SQL access or anything like that.  

I'm getting ready to plot out a lot of data I've been working on to create some printable handouts.  

I want to do this in a way that's reproducible at will.  
___


**Approach:**

So far my best idea has been to create the plots in Jupyter NB, then create an HTML doc with the images?  That way if I update the images the doc will just pull them?  Save as PDF and hand them out to whoever?  

My deadline is flexible and I have the freedom to do this however I want.  

I could use Tableau ... I'm hesitant though.  I have a really good job in regarding the freedom of tools and time to take this opportunity to do this and pick up a new, more challenging skill.  If Tableau is honestly the best tool, I'm fine with it.  Just looking around before I dive into that.

I'm wondering if it'd be a good investment and an analyst to start picking up JavaScript?  I'm loosely familiar with markup languages, used them enough to get the gist of it and follow along with the code if needed.  Never really done anything with it though, however I've always wanted to.  Just been focusing on Python up until now and this is my first job where I get to do programming all day. 

Any thoughts or suggestions for a rookie?

**Disclaimer:**  

I want to elaborate because I feel like this is an easy target for someone to say, ""Just use the right tool for the job, dumbass!  You rookies are all the same!""

I know this is an increasingly popular question being asked these days. I am currently debating on whether investing 10-12K to pursue a Certificate in Applied Statistics (could roll into a Masters) versus self-learning programming and analytical tools like R, SQL, etc on my own, working on projects on sites like DataCamp and building my own portfolio. I am seeking careers similar to Statistical Analyst roles. I have an undergrad economics degree with limited to no experience in analytics.

I know this varies greatly case by case and certainly depends on work ethic as a self-learner.

I'd like to hear feedback on this in terms of path to employment. What do employers prefer? Can you land a quality job by building your own portfolio and self-learning, or do you need an advanced degree to supplement that? Anyone have specific examples of this? What are some of the best websites/projects out there that employers value in terms of building your own portfolio?

It's a tough thought to invest 10K+ into a certificate when so many great tools and websites are out there, but I also realize the investment may be well worth it.

Any feedback appreciated. Thank you!",4,1

I have a data set of lets lets say 92 rows by 12 columns. The matrix represents the water level of each county over than span of 11 years . Each row is an array that contains the county name and its water level for 11 years (so each row is a size 12 array)

[Anyways when i graph this matrix in parallel coordinates using a JavaScript library called d3.js](https://i.redd.it/0d55oh634xe31.jpg). This graph is normalized by the high and low values by the way. In the graph 1.0 is the normalized high and 0 is the low.

This is good so far but my main objective is to go through this mess and find counties that share a similar trend line. I came up of three ways of doing this but they aren't working as well. Here is my three methods:

3 METHODS I USED TO FIND PATTERNS:

**1) FINDING PATTERNS BY MANUALLY GOING THROUGH COUNTY TREND LINES:**

From the graph above, you can easily identify several similar patterns. Im trying to find as many SIMILAR patterns as possible. I first did it by eye and grouped similar patterns (the results turned out ok but im sure i missed a few counties). obviously, this is not a good way to go about this. Here is the three ways i did it:

**2) USING MY ALGORITHM TO FIND PATTERNS:**

I made a simple algorithm that goes down the rows (goes through each data point of a county) and makes a string for that county that represent the behavior of that county. For example, if a county's line goes up, down, up: it will have a string of ""udu"" (im going to call this the **behavioral string** from now on). Once i have the behavioral string of all counties, i then looped through the rows/counties once again and looked for any other county that has the least common substring of...say 9 (there are 11 years, so the maximum length of the behavioral string is 10 since the initial year is used to measure the first up/down. 9/10 means that at least one year doesn't match) . I then put all of this into a dictionary where the key is the county name and the value is an array that contains the names of all counties that are 9/10 similar to this county.

I though this was a pretty OK algorithm but the results showed a few patterns being there when they shouldn't be there. It was also leaving out many other patterns. I have made a much smaller example that will use this algorithm and the covariance matrix which i will explain below:

**3) USING COVARIANCE MATRIX:**

I was told by a redditor to do this but im still dont understand what this does in my case.

SMALL 5x5 EXAMPLE USING MY ALGORITHM AND COVARIANCE MATRIX:

[So here i made a 5x5 matrix example to test these out:](https://imgur.com/2Ly4qyZ)

The picture has 5 patterns (**a,b,c,d,e**). On the top right is a matrix of the graph's data. The middle matrix is me just rotating the matrix to do calculations for the covariance matrix. the 3rd and bottom matrix is the resulting covariance matrix (i used a online covariance matrix calculator).

[This is the results for that 5x5 test](https://imgur.com/atqFRZe). Since there are 5 years, the maximum length of the on the behavior string can be 4. I made it so it will output only 3/4 of similar patterns. On top is me using my algorithm and outputting a matrix where the row arrays only have patterns that has 3 or more lest common substring. below that is the result of the corariance matrix",7,1

I'm sort of new to all of this and don't yet have the vocabulary to effectively find what I need via search.  I've been at that for a bit but just banging my head against the wall.

I have some data that is a combination of numbers/dates/strings/lists of strings.  I am working to find correlations in Pandas.  I'd like to use something like a heat-map / scatter plot (count of instances), but I'm not sure how to do this when the data is not all numerical and when some appears in a list.

&amp;#x200B;

Just a very general example:

&amp;#x200B;

|Index|Date submitted|Age (int)|Schools (delim list)|Sex (single str val)|Race (delim list)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|0|01/30/2019|25|MIT, Stanford|M|A,B,W|
|1|01/20/2019|34|Stanford|F|B|

In this example, the age is easy because it's just a number. 

The date submitted should be treated like a time series and I think I can figure this out from what I've googled.

Where I get stuck are things like school, race - which in this example would be lists of possible values separated by commas. 

I understand that it could be restructured so that there is one column per category in the list - which is feasible with something like Race that may only have 5ish options.   But what about data that could be significantly more varied like Schools?  There's no way I should create a new column for each possible school or hometown, right?  

Additionally, this data frame may have a hundred thousand rows or more.

How would I best restructure this data for correlative / trend / relationship type analysis within pandas?",15,11

SARCASM notice:

Last month I was temporarily banned from for the three posts above, I supposedly did not follow some 1/8 guideline and I have been told that I am not supposed to publish projects here, which makes sense given the description of the community:  A place for data science practitioners and professionals to discuss and debate data science career questions.

In any case, in fear of being banned again, I will publish my future projects to r/datascienceproject. Of course you could go to r/MachineLearning or r/python but it gets a bit cluttered there.  And also the mod suggested I should start a new subreddit for data science projects so whytf not. So here it is r/datascienceproject

Any suggestions, or if I have somehow managed to overlook a repository that already does exactly this please let me know here.",3,4

I understand that differencing is a way to make a non stationary time series, stationary. From  [https://otexts.com/fpp2/stationarity.html](https://otexts.com/fpp2/stationarity.html) they talk about first order differencing and second order differencing, but I'm trying to wrap my head around what this means for your forecast.

1. When you forecast a first order differenced time series are you just forecasting the rate of change in the original data? 
2. If point 1 is true, would it be possible to turn that result into an actual number (i.e. if you were to forecast the non differenced data, would it be possible to turn the first differenced forecast into a result of the non differenced data)",3,2

I wrote a python program to forecast around 3000 parts. It uses    3MA, 6MA, 12MA, Naive, Simple Exponential Smoothing and Double    Exponential Smoothing. Towards the end of the program, it selects the    best method for each part and puts that into a final forecast    spreadsheet. I currently have it using wmape, but could use rmse, mse,    or any of the other ones that I already have automatically calculated.    All of these measurement statistics are comparing actual to predicted    values.

I essentially feed all  of   the data to my program for the regular forecast and then withhold  the   last 6 months of data and calculate a hold out forecast. I was    originally just calculating the hold out forecast once and doing a 6    month HOF forecast. I was told that I should be doing the HOF forecast    one month at a time starting 6 months in the past.

For    instance, I would calculate a one month forecast when I am 6 months  in   the past, another month when I am five months in the past, another  one   when I am 4 months in the past, and so on and so forth.

I'm trying to perform a basket analysis on customers who buy suits, shirts, pants, vests, etc.

I get some useful results back, which is nice, but then I looked closer at my results and my data and am left scratching my head.

I am using the arules library and followed along the steps in the [datacamp tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/market-basket-analysis-r) here, but using my own data set.

My top two results look like this:

&amp;#x200B;

|Rule|LHS|RHS|Support|Confidence|Lift|Count|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|Black Suit|White Shirt|0.1|0.75|22.34|450|
|2|White Shirt|Black Suit|0.1|0.68|22.34|450|

At first, I thought, maybe it's because the way items get rung up affects the way the transaction gets read, so I need to go back and sort my transactions by item (A-Z) then re-run my analysis.

The thing is, even after I sorted my data, so that a transaction row would always read black suit first and white shirt subsequently in a basket where those items appear together, regardless of if there are only those two items or other items in the basket with those two, **I got the same result.** I get that item A appearing x% in transactions with item B doesn't == same as item B appearing x% in transactions with item A if they have a different count.... am I missing something?

So what's going on here?

What determines an item to go on the LHS vs. the RHS and why are they two separate rules? 

Also, why would the confidence here be different?

In the interviews I have been getting, I am receiving good feedback by the data science manager or director (or whoever leads these teams). This is in the technical screens and take-home assignments. The intermediary internal recruiters will tell me that manager/director really likes my work. However three times when getting to the final stages of the process, i.e. the on-site, it seems I am doing well in my interviews, but on three occasions I have run into a senior data scientist who just seemed a bit adversarial for lack of a better word. For example, I spoke to four senior data scientists, two at a time, at a recent on-site. During the second pair interview, one of them seemed annoyed by my answers, I was trying to be polite, at the same time trying to figure out how to navigate the situation. He would cut me off and kind of just press forward. It was strange, but his partner read the situation and actually intervened twice. 

At another on-site there was one senior data scientist, out of three, who was tasked to go over my take home assignment. I had been told by the internal recruiter that the team manager really liked my work. However, the senior data scientist tasked with going through my assignment pretty much only wanted to focus on all the things I did not do or did not pursue. However, I tried to address these decisions in the assignment, because many of these things are choices and I scope these projects to take at most 4 hours (which I note explicitly in the assignment). It is fine if he wants to speak about these things, but each time he seemed really skeptical and a bit dismissive. 

The last of these three examples, again it seemed I had great feedback on my assignment, but when it came to one of the senior data scientists who also had to review it and was the one to go through it with me. It was stated that it would be like a presentation where I would step through my approach and discuss my thought process. However this guy was not having it, I was met with silence when I would talk through my process, and then he would want me to give him the answer to how he would do the project. It was a bit strange and not very pleasant. 

This is purely anecdotal but I did notice it thinking about the past couple of weeks. Why are these guys (they are all guys) conducting their interviews this way? Is it deliberate? After these interviews I always feel like perhaps I may not enjoy working at these places; which I think should be the exact opposite feeling interviewers should be instilling in candidates. I have thought about this and come up with the following:

1. They are not good at interviewing. This is understandable, I dont think I am good at interviewing as I rarely practice it. However, at the very least, I try to give a good impression.
2. It is deliberate. But why?

My wife mentioned that perhaps these individuals view candidates as threats. Maybe, but really? I dont think I have felt that way towards a candidate I have interviewed. However for some context, these individuals tend to have the same amount or less data science experience and hold senior data scientist titles. I have never held a senior data scientist title, I have never thought about and have not cared as long as I get compensated well. Maybe I should care, I dont know. However these positions have been for senior level titles. What should I take away from this?",7,1

My expectation when hiring them was that they could write sql, do excel like vlookups, basic coding with an aptitude to grow, and use alteryx/tableau.

I am struggling to separate how long it takes me to do it vs how long I should give an entry level employee to do it.  One of my employees seems exceptionally slow and I am starting to consider the possibility he cant do the job, but want to make sure I am not being overly critical due to unreal expectations.

&amp;#x200B;

**example task**

He has a tableau workbook that he has to refresh the extract every week.  It takes approximately an hour to update this extract and he constantly complains about this.  However, we only use the past month of data. I asked him to either use Tableaus custom sql option or make a new table/view in the sql database that only has the past 4 weeks of data.

Basically, a select \* and a where clause.  Then he has to do some basic things like replace the datasource in tableau and rename 4 columns that were aliased in tableau and now have bins built on top that apparently only pick up the alias name.

How long would you give an entry level analyst with 6 months of working experience prior to being hired?  and now in his role for almost 3 months? so 9 months total?

I assigned it to him Wednesday but he had an ad hoc request that took the afternoon, so it wasn't completed.  but he still had a few hours in the morning to work on it.

&amp;#x200B;

**His behavior**

I told him it was due today.  And I checked in 3-4 times during the day. 

First he couldn't figure out how to write the where clause for a rolling 4 months and not have to reference the date. So, I wrote this for him.

Then he couldn't figure out how to replace the source in tableau so he wouldn't have to remake the dashboards. so I showed him

then when the source was replaced, some of the columns were aliased and caused some of the dashboards to error out. So I told him to alias the new columns to the old column names then try again. and did the first alias for him.

The end result was that it wasn't completed despite having a full day to work on it plus 2-4 hours yesterday to work on it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions**

I have two years managing experience.  Ive managed 6 different people total.   And I've never been frustrated with an employee before.  I have weekly 1on1s and am frequently checking in during the week.

I am setting deadlines that I feel are reasonable and they are being missed.  So, I check in over the course of the day and its very difficult for me to tell if he is fucking around or his technical skills are very imited.  Like could he really not google how to do a where clause with the last 4 months with several hours of time allotted?

So, basically,

&amp;#x200B;

1)  For the task I gave as an example, what would your deadline be for an analyst with 9 months experience?

2)   If it was less than 10-12 hours allotted, how would you handle him failing to meet the deadline?

3) if it was reasonable that he missed the deadline, how would you handle the situation going forward?",0,1

And I feel like I'm the person with more knowledge in statistics in the department (I have a master in political science and I'm now pursuing a bachelor in applied mathematics - the other guys are from IT or engineering, but they didn't studied much statistics). I don't feel that the other people in the team will actually teach me things that I don't know. I feel like it's going to be the other way around and I don't think this is worth it as an internship since I won't be learning much.

My biggest doubt is: should I stay some time (3 or 6 months) to get the name of this company in my resume? Or should I just get out and try to find a new internship/job as soon as possible? To me, the only benefit of staying is to say that I was an intern in this big company and to avoid a gap in my resume. But I really don't think I'm going to learn anything interesting there from a data science perspective.

TL, DR: I was hired for an internship in a big company where I was supposed to work with data science and machine learning, but the actual internship is more of a data analyst position. Should I stay a feel months to put the experience in this big company in my CV? Or should I leave as soon as possible, since I won't be learning anything in this internship?",6,0

I am a student in my last year in an actuarial science program thinking about switching careers. I am not in the most ideal situation since I've solely been focused on actuarial work with my internships and course work so far but have still been able to acquire a decent amount of statistics knowledge. 

I would like to know if anyone has any recommendations for my best options in a data science career path. Personally I'd like to work in a bio related or physics applied type of work but I can see how those may be unrealistic considering my undergrad. 

Really I am open to working anywhere and I am guessing statistical work is more realistic. Would anyone see benefits from a Masters in Statistics? I feel like getting the computer science part of things may be better though and so if I am able to enter into a CS Master's with an actuarial math undergrad, I am also considering that.

Anyways, whatever advice you can give, I'll take. Even if it's completely unrelated to these career options, I'll consider it.

Lastly, I don't mean any disrespect by this post. I understand Data Science has its own depths and its not just something you can fallback on as something that will surely work out. I am just out of ideas of work that I find interesting that I can realistically do. I really like maths, physics and biology but the physics and biology related Master's are all probably not possible for me to get into with an undergrad in actuarial math.

Thanks,

A lost student",3,0

* From the isolated work of small teams, the trickle of communications through formal conferences and published papers to broad based online interactions (including this *subreddit* :-), competitions, countless blogs etc.
* From the strict separation between research / analysis and ""production"" to the increasing ability to develop and deploy within the same platform

So things are moving fast. But where is this spaceship heading to? 

Futuristic discussions invariably involve the role of AI and machine learning but imho this is misunderstanding of what it takes to push the data science boundary - at least in a timescale I am interested in.

I'm not 100% sure how to represent this on a chart. I immediately thought line graph but i'm not sure if it's the best to represent over 100,000 users. I'm starting to think scatter plot is what makes the most sense with a trend line which i guess overtime it should show a decreasing trend line but i'm not sure if i'm going about it the right way. If this is the wrong place to ask, forgive me and if anyone could point me in the right sub i'll delete this post and ask there.

I've been looking around for past ~year and I've saved any course (mainly github repos full of notebooks) that seemed to be targeted for beginners. But now I'm digging into those materials and it seems to be harder than I expected. I have to admin a lot of materials were materials to some books/presentations I dont have access to.

I don't have math degree which seems to be kinda gamechanger. I don't want to be expert where I can matematically explain how for example CNN works but I want to understand what code I write and what models I use (how they work).

I'm willing to boost my math education if needed (adequately). I would like to be able (at least) read all those math equations I saw and have enough knowledge to be able to tuney future models - not like ""ok let's change this constant and see what will happen"".

I'm not desperate but I have feeling like I'm going the wrong way. Please help me with following questions:

1) Is that actually necessary for me as developer not scientist (the math uderstanding)?
2) Recommend me good math-lame friendy course/YT channels I can go thru. Keras, TF, SK mainly.

I can't use my datasets weights to estimate a binomial family model. I've been using the glm() function to estimate a probit model, but when my weights variable is added (as an argument in the function ""weights = variable.name"") the model doesn't converge and my results fall far from what it's expected (). I believe that the problem resides in the form of Weights variable, as the function's document states that binomial family uses the Weigths variable in a different way. When I use Weights for simple OLS with glm() function, it works perfectly.

My dataset explanation for weights: this weight was obtained by adjusting an initial weight given by the inverse of the effective sample fraction.  [full text](https://www.ibge.gov.br/apps/snig/v1/notas_metodologicas.html?loc=0)

Glm() doc explanation for Weights: Non-NULL weights can be used to indicate that different observations have different dispersions (with the values in weights being inversely proportional to the dispersions); or equivalently, when the elements of weights are positive integers w\_i, that each response y\_i is the mean ofw\_i unit-weight observations

Glm() (for binomial cases) doc explanation for Weights : . For a binomial GLM prior weights are used to give the number of trials when the response is the proportion of successes: they would rarely be used for a Poisson GLM.  [full text](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.1/topics/glm)

I believe this topic is also discussed [here](https://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/Weights-in-binomial-glm-td1991249.html)

I would love to hear your feedback. 3 months ago I applies to a DS role @FB and did not pass the screen interview. The feedback I got was that there was a problem with my a/b test design. Attached the question and the answer I gave, any idea what I have missed in the answer I gave ?

&amp;#x200B;

Question : 

FB would like to change the UI of the composer (the one users use to write a post) to be like INSTAGRAM (instead of a box ,they would they will add a ""+"" button at the bottom of the page), how would you test if this is a good idea

&amp;#x200B;

Answer I gave :

1. I assume you would like to move to the new UI because you see more posts per active user in instagram and we would like to see this kind of behavior in FB as well

2. For this we need to run an a/b test

3. The KPI should be the daily # of posts per user per day divided by the total active users

4. You should do it by market - he was insist to explain why and I explained because the users in the control can be trigger to write a post if they have friends in the test as well

5. We need to make sure other segments between the markets are the same.

For FB : same distribution of age, gender, retentions , devices , heavy users vs lite

Outside FB : There is not special event (like election)

6. I mentioned (I think, maybe this I forgot or did not say in a clear way) that we need to make sure we do not run it for only few days / hours but take weekend and work week trends)

7. Then he asked what are the cons of doing it by market, I said network is not 100% isolated we can have connections between users, also segments are not 100% distribute the same as much as we wish too.

After that, he asked in case we do not do it by market how will you design the test. I wasn't sure exactly what he was expecting to hear. Can someone share some insights what do think he looked for ?

**Highights:**

\- You can learn graph level embeddings for a million molecular graphs in a minute on commodity hardware.

\- Learning from non attributed graphs.

\- Unsupervised feature extraction.

\- Feature extraction and optimization are both parallel.

**Abstract of the paper:**

Recent works on representation learning for graph structured data predominantly focus on learning distributed representations of graph substructures such as nodes and subgraphs. However, many graph analytics tasks such as graph classification and clustering require representing entire graphs as fixed length feature vectors. While the aforementioned approaches are naturally unequipped to learn such representations, graph kernels remain as the most effective way of obtaining them. However, these graph kernels use handcrafted features (e.g., shortest paths, graphlets, etc.) and hence are hampered by problems such as poor generalization. To address this limitation, in this work, we propose a neural embedding framework named graph2vec to learn data-driven distributed representations of arbitrary sized graphs. graph2vec's embeddings are learnt in an unsupervised manner and are task agnostic. Hence, they could be used for any downstream task such as graph classification, clustering and even seeding supervised representation learning approaches. Our experiments on several benchmark and large real-world datasets show that graph2vec achieves significant improvements in classification and clustering accuracies over substructure representation learning approaches and are competitive with state-of-the-art graph kernels.",0,15

My goal is to move to Japan to be with my fiancee in the next 1.5 - 2 yrs or so. If that can't be done then at least to the west coast (USA) where timezones are closer and flights are cheaper. That being said, I thought getting into a data science career (either in Japan or the west coast) would be perfect given my background and interests.  
  
I graduated from college back in 2014 with a degree in chemical engineering and physics. Afterwards, I continued on to grad school for my PhD in Computational Biophysics, thinking I wanted to be a professor one day. Lo and behold, I abandoned that dream and withdrew during my third year to explore medicine a bit. Nevertheless, my research experiences were pretty much all computational simulations that dealt with a lot of data manipulation/analysis, and I enjoyed that portion. I don't have a formal education in Data Science or Comp Sci, but my engineering and physics background has given me a solid quantitative/statistical/coding foundation.
  
Now that I actually need a stable career to support myself and my fiancee in the near future, I wanted to leverage my STEM-heavy background and jump into a data science career, whether that be in Japan or somewhere in the west coast.   
  
How should I spend the next year to make myself a desirable job applicant?   
  
I'm currently taking the IBM Data Science Certification course on Coursera to get myself started, but I'm not sure where to go from there other than starting my own projects and putting them onto Github. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

2. Reports? No need to report shit; will just fix shit and move on (i.e. basically I was losing out on valuable matrices)

**After:**

1. Holy cow, these &lt;insert commercial&gt; dashboards are atrocious! They don't even tell me a story! And what's up with using this chart for X, Y and Z situations!!?
2. I take matrices and data features ***very seriously nowadays*** as I know these will be the foundation of my dashboard.
3. Even whilst attempting to solve a problem not related to DS, I would still think of what kind of data I can get, engineer and analyse over time!

Is there a ""proper"" way to do this? Do I just look at the prediction probabilities of those close to the threshold between churn and no churn? Are false positives (assuming 1 = churn), employees that are still with the company and likely to leave?
 Or is there no way of predicting future churn within the dataset?

Which raises the  interesting question: **If programming languages were human languages which one would be which?** Here is a (*tonque-in-cheek mind you!*)  compilation of a mapping between programming languages and human  languages

 

* **python -&gt; English**. Simple and easy. Spoken  everywhere (but not everybody speaks it to native speaker standard!)  From lowly scripts, to web servers to #datascience, youre never  stranded if you know it. 
* **rlang -&gt; German**. Capable. Focused. Sometimes a bit convoluted. Not spoken much outside the Germanic world though. 
* **julia -&gt; Dutch**, a quirky small language the claims to combine the best of various worlds. Its speakers are particularly proud :-)
* **java -&gt; Latin**. Was *lingua franca* for a looong time but recently the empire is losing some lustre. Well structured. Solid but awkwardly verbose. 
* **kotlin -&gt; Italian** Modern reincarnation of Latin. Claims to be all the good pieces of Java with none of the verbiage. 
* **C/C++ -&gt; French**. Elaborate. Fully fledged.  Generally underestimated despite its major contributions. Many words of  English are actually French, just like many python libraries are  actually C/C++. Now tries to reinvent itself once again to remain  relevant
* **rust -&gt; Finnish** Wants to come out of nowhere and conquer the world by sheer coolness (like the frozen North). 
* **javascript -&gt; Chinese**. Spoken by very large  numbers but until recently confined to the geography of the browser.  Increasingly seen outside its former borders though, through server  side node.js
* **golang -&gt; Spanish**. The preferred language of a rapidly growing empire. Challenges old world boundaries
* **php -&gt; Indian**. Completely dominating the web sub-continent but some argue it is a collage of very popular frameworks  rather than a single language
* **haskell -&gt; Japanese**. Pure Zen
* **fortran -&gt; Greek.** Ancient roots. Provided the  words to many newer languages. Today rather niche but still an excellent  way to express mathematical tasks
* **lisp -&gt; Russian**. Besides profound and  mysterious, unlike most other languages lisp makes no distinction  between expressions and statements (Reminds of the conflation between a/the articles in Russian)

As an example, my organization currently has no method of tracking who wants to be involved in our business, who stays involved, and who leaves, something I'm sure I don't need to communicate the value of here. The only data we are currently really collecting is about our current member base, and is updated by hand using excel sheets that are sent around the country.

What experience do you guys have with this type of thing? As far as the project I mentioned above (tracking interest in our org) it ended up being rejected because there is ""no need or use for anything of the sort."" Is this something I should try pushing my boss on, or should I wait for newer projects to come along and use them as examples of business effectiveness?

It really feels like my direct boss read a Forbes article on data science and decided that's what the organization needs.

Honestly, any advice on the whole situation is appreciated. Thanks!!",15,19

I got my masters in statistics with a concentration in data science, so my resume doesnt mention a computer science background anywhere neither did the job postings, for that matter.

In each case I asked the recruiter for more details on what they were looking for, since CS is obviously a huge field.  Were they looking for someone with more knowledge about data structures / algorithms?  A programming language that I am unfamiliar with?  I never got a clear answer on what exactly they wanted in a candidate, so Im a bit lost.  Should I be pursuing a second masters degree, or is it enough to simply improve my python / SQL skills?

Though admittedly it's still in the beginning phase of data analysis, I can see how this can be difficult (e.g. time consuming) even in the industry.

e.g.:

I've extracted and got all my data, so I thought data engineering would be ""cake walk"" and I just need to feed my data to some model and do ""data science"" afterwards lol. But after carefully ""looking"" at a more detailed view of my data, I just found out one of my data sources has duplicated dates but different times (e.g. 01/01/2017 00:00:10 and 01/01/2017 00:10:10), where as the other data source that I'd be comparing this with has a continuous unique date interval with no time on it. I went blank for awhile with no idea what to do with these inconsistencies but finally figured out I can just get the average from the duplicates and continue doing the comparison with the other data source.

But then of course comes the other data engineering part where I need to write some scripts or even some excel commands to ensure this is happening properly. I also got a few bunch of errors just now where the average is not computing because the data type of one of the columns cannot be counted for some reason ...

I was  leaning towards a Data Science program but I would not mind doing an  Applied Stats track. I had a few questions regarding my situation.

My  undergrad stats at the moment are: 3.0 gpa(can probably raise to  3.2-3.3 by the end of senior year), GRE score: 156V/161Q/waiting for  essays to be graded, 2 internships (1 software engineering + 1 machine  learning), I don't have any recommendation letters at the moment but I'm  confident I can get a few once I go back to college. My degree is a B.S  in Computer Science and a minor in Statistics.

My questions(sorry there's a few):

What  range of schools should I apply to? Ignoring factors such as  money/location I would like to know where I stand. I think my situation  is different because my stats are on the low side but I do have some  work experience.

I started the  Statistics minor only last year so my transcript only shows that I have  completed Stats I-II and Probability. I am taking higher leveled and  more detailed electives this year such as Regression etc. Will colleges  see my full transcript including senior year classes/grades before they  make a decision about my application? I am really worried about this  because I want them to see my completion of higher level electives. I  also would prefer them to see my gpa at the end of senior year. Is the  only way this can be possible is if I apply 1 year later, so after I  graduate?

Should I take Calc 3?  (Multivariable) The B.S in Computer science at my program only required  up to calc 2 and linear which I have completed, should I try to fit in  Calc 3 in my schedule before graduating? Would Calc 3 be required even  for a Data Science track? I know it most likely is for all Applied Stats  programs.

Should I retake the GRE  and try to do better on the quantitative? I was scoring 164+ on  practice tests but was a little anxious during the actual test. I think I  would have to retake it pretty soon in order to meet the application  deadlines to start a MS next year which might be an issue since I will  also have a lot of college work. I guess I wouldn't mind working for  some time after graduating and retaking it later when I have more free  time. Plus the test is expensive to take.",1,1

* *Amount Diff*
* *Approx. Savings*
* *AS - House Loan*

I think the folks here can tell that this table is storing some sort of financial values within some years (hint *5Y* as *5 years*).

But I think ... the information or features stored here are just ... urm ... **terribly messy?** (this table contains monthly savings of a citizen for 5 years; the citizen has job X which is paid Y salary; the citizen is assumed to be single with a house loan and some assumed expenses):

**Let's dissect them:**

|*Feature*|Elaboration|
|:-|:-|
|*Amount 5Y*|Net amount saved annually for 5 years|
|*Amount 5Y (10%)*|Basically the first feature but if there's a 10% salary increase within that 5 years|
|*Amount Diff (%)*|The difference between the first two features|
|*Approx. Savings*|First or second feature minus whatever expenses the person has|
|*AS - House Loan*|4th feature minus loan|

I am graduating in 2020 in computer science and for most part of my college i've been into DS. Now that i am entering job market, min DS qualification is Masters(which is obvious pertaining to the quality of work expected for that position)
but I cant get my head off from playing with data and now want to pursue a job in it. I am planning for Masters but after 1-2 year of job or relevant work.
Can you suggest something in context of jobs.",1,1

So let's say I'm training a binary classification model with the all too common 70% -15% -15%  train-cv-test split before deploying it into an online feature.

After the necessary tweaking, I reach my objective accuracy and AUC scores. I inform the people upstairs that we are ready to deploy the model.

Now here is my question: My model is currently trained on 70% of the available data. Should I...

a) Retrain the model on 100% of the data without touching any of the hyperparameters and then deploy it.

b)  Leave the model as is and deploy it. I guess it is already performing well so why retrain on the 30% that was held out for evaluating (?!) 

c) give up and just ask Reddit to figure my life out for me.

Thanks :)",7,3

I did not find out about Data science until this summer so my time for getting an internship is running out(Summer 2020 is my last chance)

Since my major is statistics I have to teach myself basically everything. I know the basics of Python but I don't know what to do next. Some articles mention that Python,SQL and Tableua are the only things necessary to learn to get a job, while others mention that we learn about Python libraries(Numpy,Pandas,Matplotlib,Seaborn) but never mention SQL and some other things related to Machine Learning.


I am completely confused. I don't know if I should learn Tableua and SQL and then move onto Python libraries or the other way around.",1,1

In some days I will have a meeting with a really promising company and most likely I will have to propose a good master thesis topic in order to get an internship and the thesis possibility.

My initial idea was *feature engineering for machine learning* since it seems a topic that will be much needed in the future. Any suggestion or different ideas will be very appreciated, thank you in advance.",6,1

New to ARIMA here, what I learned is that 'p' in AR(p) is the last lag values in PACF before it tails off to 0 , but here it increases from lag 2 to lag 3 and then declines to lag 4. thus there is no decline in lag values from lag2 to lag4 .
