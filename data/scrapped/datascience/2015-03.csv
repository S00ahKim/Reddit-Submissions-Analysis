I have the following books:

- Applied Predictive Modeling, Kuhn and Johnson

- The Elements of Statistical Learning, Hastie et al.

- Data Science for Business, Provost and Fawcett

- Doing Data Science, O'Neil and Schutt

- The Learning &amp; Programming Python books - same with SQL (O'Reilly)

- Python for Data Analysis, McKinney

- High Performance Python, Gorelick and Ozsvald

- Two new-to-programming-language books (Java and C++)

- Various books on R (The Art of R Programming, R Graphics Cookbook)

I took two real analysis courses, so I feel that my math background is more than sufficient to handle the prerequisites for data science, judging by what I've read about this field. I also have a good background in Python and a beginner background in SQL (i.e., I can code basic queries).

As much as I would like to read through these books, I don't have time to read them in-depth due to having to studying for actuarial exams, as required for my job. Does anyone recommend any sort of quick way through these books or any MOOCs?

I am currently in my last semester of studying Computer Engineering and I am planning to pursue my MS in the states and I have been accepted by 2 colleges. Now the dilemma is to choose one among these. I will link the course structure of these universities and hope that the data scientists and analysts of reddit will be able to help me through this.


The first university is:
University 1- [Indiana University](http://www.soic.indiana.edu/graduate/degrees/data-science/ms-data-science/ms-requirements.html)

Pros:

Cheaper tuition(Cheaper by approx 10,000$) and A ""Data Science"" degree

Cons:

This will be the first batch passing out as Data Science graduates. Location(from job perspective) isn't that great. 


University 2- [Stevens institute of Techonlogy](https://www.stevens.edu/howe/academics/graduate/business-intelligence-analytics/overview)

Pros:

Is located very close to NYC and thus has a great location advantage, this course has been taught at the university since last 3 years.

Cons:

Expensive tuition and living expenses, has a ""Business Intelligence and Analytics"" degree to offer, isn't as well known throughout USA as Indiana University is.




How would you rate the two universities based on the courses they are offering? Both of these offer the opportunity to drop a particular core course and get an appropriate elective. Which university would be your preference based on the courses?

I am a current student who hopes to get into a career in data analysis after graduation. I have been heavily exposed (due to my research area) to Bayesian data analysis, but I have little idea what the difference is with 'other' data analysis. 

So for those experts out there, can you help enlighten me on the following questions:

* Is Bayesian data analysis a specialism of the more general field of data analysis? 

* If it is, are there any keywords (apart from Bayesian I guess?) that I should look out for when searching jobs?

* If it isn't then what should I learn to be more relevant to employers?

Some extra information in case it helps:

I am a physics graduate by training doing a PhD in maths where I spend most of my time analysing data. The research area I'm involved in makes heavy use of the Bayesian tools and I have come to respect the methodology. This has persuaded me that such a set of skills are worth developing by finding a suitable career which uses them. However, when talking to the few people I know in the industry and employers at careers events, the word ""Bayesian "" appeared to be almost entirely foreign to them. This has left me confused about it's relevance. I respect that there are other methodologies, but my experience with them is limited.

* The first is a conventional two-year/four-semester program at a large, prestigious university. It's also in the middle of a large metropolitan area so summer internship and networking opportunities are sure to be plentiful. I've looked over the courses and spoken to one of the current students and he says the classes are very good and taught by both well-known academic researchers and industry professionals, and there's a wide selection of electives to choose from so you can gear up your coursework for your sub-field of choice. The downside here is it would cost nearly $25,000 per semester for the tuition and fees (sans room/board and living costs) with little to no opportunities for scholarships.

* The second is at a very small, virtually unknown state school. It's 15 months, but it's still four semesters if you include the summer sessions. The upside here is it also comes with an internship at a data science facility--I'd be working 20 hours a week for those 15 months and receiving a $25,000 stipend. The tuition is a lot cheaper, too--around $10,000 total. And the last thing that makes this appealing is it's a full on M.S. in Mathematics instead of a ""professional"" or ""industry"" degree, which usually aren't as good. I've spoken to a current student and he says the coursework is fairly shallow for a graduate math degree--a semester each of Analysis, Algebra, Linear Algebra, SQL, and independent study along with two semesters each of Machine Learning and Applied Statistics (no variation--if I want to specialize in business intelligence or NLP or whatnot I'd have to do that on my own time). As for the internship, he says the work is interesting and you're doing actual data science work/modeling/analysis (not really sure what that entails) and the guy in charge of it is very well respected in the data science community (ICDSE committee member). 

The other option would be to choose neither. A couple months ago I started an entry level software engineering gig that pays $20/hr, so maybe I can work my way up from there.

I'm currently attending school in Bay Area. (Berkeley) which is next to SF which is great. I'm currently on leave of absence due to personal issues, and within my time off I thought off changing my major to study Statistics and minor in Computer Science to get into Data field. Obviously SF is a great place to find jobs and Berkeley itself is a great institution. But, to be honest my GPA is just above 3.0 and I'm considering transferring to a different school. I'm not quite feeling the location itself, and I just seem to be struggling most of the time both academically and socially.

I get to start fresh at transfer college, and I was wondering what your recommendations are. I'm not looking into going to Grad School right out of college and hopefully I don't need to. Obvious thing is I need amazing GPA to attend top grad schools for masters or phd and I'm not quite sure if I can do that at Berkeley.

I'm considering applying to 

LMU which is next to Silicon Beach in LA, Claremont McKenna, Southern Methodist University, Vanderbilt, Wake Forest, Boston College, Duke, Tulane, Middlebury, Rice, Stanford, U of Notre Dame, and University of Colorado Boulder.

Obviously my college choices are top tier but I'm open to other colleges as well. Personally, U of Colorado Boulder interest me because of the location and such and I didn't have time to apply to public schools in California as I missed the deadline (was looking into UCLA, UCSB, Cal Poly Slo). 

Am I looking into the right direction? I've taken Python and all but I still need to practice on my own to get into Data industry. Schools itself won't teach me that and I need to take initiative on my own to do so. I would rather take charge and have some memorable college experience and hopefully get into a great company while building some great skills.

Thanks for your advice.

Everyone here has been a big help in making a recent transition from a PhD in computational chemistry into an almost data scientist.  I just want to ask the community for their thoughts on my current situation with respect to career development.  

The main question is how transferable would skills developed in an ""analyst"" role at a digital advertising company using R, SQL and cloud computing be to other data science roles in other industries. Would accepting such a position pigeon hole me for future positions as a data scientist or would it open-doors in other fields besides advertising in the future?

The secondary question is less direct and just a matter of asking for other peoples sentiments or personal stories.  I have a job offer for a Senior Analyst position in a well known but medium sized digital advertising agency.  This will be my first job and I want to be sure it is the best opportunity for my future.  I should mention I finished my degree 6 days ago.  Besides the offer, I have an interview in two weeks for a junior data science position at an insurance company and a deposit down for a data science bootcamp in NYC.  The latter was done prior to getting any interviews as a backup and because I am not 100% confident in my skills I have developed and wanted more guided instructions before entering the job market. What is most important to me is what I do next prepares me for a long exciting and dynamic career 5 -10 years from now.  Two additional mentions which I am lucky to work off of - money is currently not a problem nor priority and I will live almost anywhere.  

Any advice would be useful feel free to pm me too.

I expect to have 3-4 publications by the time I would apply, including a first-author publication involving some data analysis from one of our trials. My long term interest is in healthcare data.

I have not taken the GRE yet, but I am a great standardized test taker (scored in the 99th percentile on the MCAT).

Hi,

My name is Steph and I am a co-founder of [metricscrowd.com](http://metricscrowd.com).

The idea of metricscrowd is to provide a platform for scientists and researchers to offer and hire computing capacity and data analysis services. One can think of something like an Uber for computing time/power and statistics, econometrics, simulation and programming services.

We are a group of academic statisticians and economists and who often came across the problem that our departments computing hardware was not sufficient enough to meet our needs. Finding the right hardware and the right people to setup everything was often difficult.

Thats when we thought that there are probably more scientists facing the same issue and the idea for metricscrowd.com was born. The basic idea is that you can offer your service an charge a fee or to simply look for collaborations.

Our website features and escrow service (through paypal) that stores the funds for a project in an escrow account upon starting a project and it will be released once the project has been finalized.

Our plan is to have a silent launch of a first open beta version of our platform soon.

We are currently looking for researchers who work with data and who are open to offer their skills or who have some free computing capacity/time that people can hire.

If you have interest, you can sign up to the email list on our landing page (We will only send you one email about the launch of the open beta and will not spam you).

Once the open beta is up, we would be grateful for any feedback and comments. If you have any thoughts and suggestions, just post them here.

Regards

The program was sold to me as a straight up data science/big data program.  I'm starting to wonder if my expectations were unrealistic. The academic rigor is low, in my opinion, and the program is plagued with group work. I'm hoping someone who has been through this process before could help give me a reality check regarding what I've gotten myself into. Some other grad school experiences would be helpful. I'll give a brief overview of the classes I've taken thus far and the expectations along with some of my broad goals.

So far I've had two stats classes with no tests. We are assessed via group projects and individual problem sets. There is no huge expectation to know the nitty gritty of the math but just to be able to explain model outputs. We are being exposed to a large range of stats packages: SPSS, JMP, R, and SAS; however, this is more of a breadth not depth situation. My main concern here is that my stats knowledge isn't being tested and evaluated enough. How important is it for me to fully understand the math behind the stats? Should I and take some calculus or other math to flesh out my background?

I took a intro to databases class and learned about relational databases and some light sql. Again, no tests, just group projects and individual assignments. The sql exposure still puts me firmly in the beginner's chair.

The other classes, which I find boring as hell, are business intelligence related. They are mainly focused around how to use IBM products by following along in a workbook to create visualizations. Anyone could do it. Again, no tests. 

I'm hoping to land somewhere in the tech industry after graduation, but I have realized that my program isn't going to fully prepare me for that industry. There isn't a programming class in the curriculum and we aren't even getting exposed the nosql side of things until the last semester. At this point the idea of leave the program is off the table, but I think I need to go into damage control by heavily supplementing my education.

Recently (past 5 months) I have been going through a lot of data analysis and data science stuff and have decided to apply for the program at multiple universities. I do come from a technical background (undergrad from Florida) and do understand coding and databases, but have left that area for the last 5 years and have shifted my role more into sales and pre-sales. I have been doing this for Oracle based products in ERP and Business Intelligence and basically convincing the customers on taking it up.

I do understand that knowing a product like Oracle business intelligence does not entail that I would have a working knowledge of data analysis and extracting and data cleansing/mapping etc. But I do understand the terms for general conversations and know how the pieces all fit together.

I wanted to get out of the rut and start my career in Data analysis and later a data scientist knowing there will be good number of jobs going forward with how technology is leading us into everything being connected and even more loads of data being generated.

Hence, I applied for the two universities which I felt would be good for a on-campus course : 1) North Carolina &amp; 2) Arizona University (Tempe)
I did get rejected from the North carolina, but have been accepted to the ASU program of Business Analytics [https://wpcarey.asu.edu/masters-programs/business-analytics/curriculum]

I would like all of your immense advice if the ASU course is good enough to take it up and go forward with this career change. Also, if the graduates of this course get a decent job in the related field or not. If there is any alumni of this course, I would like to know if it was worth it or not.

This will really help me make my decision.

Before attending UCSB, I studied at a community college focusing on electrical engineering, so i have a strong science/math background (I was accepted into UCSD/UCD for EE but decided it wasnt for me).

This leaves me with about an 8 month window.

1)What GRE scores should I expect to have to get into a program such as Columbia's, stanfords, or Berkeleys?

2) Stories about getting financial aid through teaching assistance? Was it hard?

3) Any references for summer internships or companies looking to hire entry level datascientist /business intelligence?

4) Thoughts on Mu Sigma? They are the only data analytics/science company recruiting at my school.

For one thing, can you add a new column to a spark dataframe? Using pandas, for example, this would be:

     df['new_column'] = 1

The documentation says nothing about creating new columns in a spark dataframe or even updating preexisting columns. It seems like the dataframe API is just a thin wrapper for a spark sql table. This leads me to believe that I would have to:

* create a new table with one extra column
* copy all the data from the dataframe to this table
* update the new column with ones
* create a new dataframe out of this table

Long term, I plan on becoming a data scientist involved in smaller (start-up) companies, possibly one of my own; however, in the short term there some areas in which advise would be greatly appreciated. 




1) Major?
I plan on majoring in comp sci with a dash of stats and engineering-related courses added in. From what I have seen, the field is largely interdisciplinary, an aspect I both like and want to prepare for. Is comp sci the best path to go down and/or are there any areas of emphasis I need to add in undergrad?





2) Institution?
I have been admitted into programs at UT Austin and Washington-Seattle, both of which seem to be widely reputable, but at a steep out of state cost. I also have some instate options (Mizzou/ Truman in Missouri) which rank lower but are much cheaper. I plan to work hard and do well either way, but from people in the industry, have your undergrad institutional choices played a significant role in your career? I'm planning on going in-state as of now. 



3) Extracurricular involvement
I plan on working on projects outside of coursework such as hackathons/ github projects/ reading up in my interest areas and interning. Any suggestions for developing a more polished perspective of the field?



Also, there seems to be a lot of hype concerning data science at the moment, and given the high demand and few qualified individuals outlook seems good. Will this over correct in a few years from now and lead to a saturation of qualified individuals, or will the field settle into a pattern of healthy growth?

Advise in any/all of there areas would be greatly appreciated!

Anyway, I was wondering if ""ALL OF STATISTICS"" by Wasserman is a good **substitute** for two courses in mathematical statistics. I have the book and it's not hard to get through, and I always prefer reading things on my own instead of being taught in a formal classroom setting. So, good enough for a ""solid statistical foundation""? 

In a somewhat related thought, the book actually covers more than 2 courses in statistics and even goes to a third course since it reaches all the way to logistic regression, but my question mostly deals with 'is this book good enough to replace the coursework for data science industry work, and is it good enough to acquire the knowledge prereqs for more advanced ML studies like the Bishop Pattern Recognition book?' That Bishop book was really my motivation to get back into the grinding statistics knowledge since I noticed that the book is impenetrable to me at this moment. I could pick any 3 consecutive pages in that book and not be able to fully understand it. 

This is just regarding regular statistics, not machine learning. I have machine learning algorithms/math covered with Elements of Statistical Learning but I figured that this is necessary as well. ",11,11,False,self,,,,,

Thinking about this really makes a clear distinction between data mining and machine learning since we do the same thing in machine learning, except there's a training set that alters the strategy procedure making the classifications.

It does seem odd but if this is true, basic one and two sample hypothesis testing is just a data mining procedure where each experiment is a data point in a classification problem. This is fine, but I also can't seem to figure out how this works with regression testing. It seems like adding and removing variables alone is an experiment.

Hired at a big company, think Fortune 50, whose main product is software/software-like. I've been on the job for 2 months.

I was hired onto the main data science team for a large branch of the organization. I loved working with that team because there were smart PhD's working on compelling projects that were highly central to the continued success of the organization reporting to VPs. I chose the wrong project as my first project, and three weeks in, my team was split in half, and I got put on the wrong half. No more PhD's, only newbies.

Now I'm using statistics to find bugs in software, when before I could have been analyzing LTV or natural language processing. My new team owns the data pipeline, but doesn't know what to do with data scientists. My new manager has 25 direct reports (all managers aside from the 5 new data scientists), and has told me he doesn't care about my career development and that he doesn't know or care to know anything about data science.

The people who moved with me to my new team are all junior or new to this branch of the organization so they know nothing. It is a very poor situation, and many are very demoralized. My former boss (I was an intern before so he knows my skillset) said he put me with these people so the project won't fail, if I leave, it is uncertain whether the project will be completed on schedule, which I kind of want to do to spite the new team because I'm very unhappy about being moved off my old team. 

I have connections throughout the organization and am looking to hop teams again. I could be working on a very, very, very new, and very, very cool project, but their data pipelines are very immature, so I would mostly be working on setting the pipelines up, more data engineering then data science . But the project is so cool that it might be worth it, think high profile, up and coming technology that is going to be a game changer in the next 10 years.

So I have two options: 
Stay with my new team, which has no support, has very few people I can learn from, has very little direction as of now, doing more boring data science. I could become an integral part of this new team if I push myself, but I find it hard to stay motivated because I'm so pissed off that I got put on this team. I literally knew none of these people during my internship and would not have come on full time if I knew this was going to happen.

Go to a new team working on an uber cool project, but be doing mostly data engineering, with the hope in ~2 years to be doing data science as an integral member of this up and coming part of the organization. I also know the people on this team and like them a lot, so I would be among old friends.

After this semester, I'll have completed what my department calls a ""distinction in the econometric sequence"". Don't ask me why they call it a sequence...

Anyways, I've taken upper-level courses in;
*Regression and Analysis of Variance
*Introduction to Econometrics
*Forecasting using Time-Series Analysis
*Experimental Statistical Modeling

...And finally after this semester, Econometrics I.

I've gained a working knowledge of Stata, SAS, and R, and could easily construct some decently complex models with each. I also have a fundamental understanding of Python and SQL. 

However, as mentioned previously, I don't attend a high-ranking college and as a consequence I was never required to complete my Calc I, II, &amp; III sequence. I took business calc as a freshmen, but I wasn't aware of my future plans regarding analytics so never bothered with it in any more detail. This made some of my later stats courses kind of difficult, but I could always manage my way through them. 

So although I may be lacking in my calculus/maths, I'm curious as to if my other background should be sufficient for graduate level work in the ""data science"" field? ",1,1,False,self,,,,,

I graudated last year and have been working in IT industry since a year. I'm Comp. Sci grad. I work with an MNC, and recently I've shown interest in chatting about Analytics and Data Science related stuff with some senior management of *Business Intelligence* domain in my organization. Now when a new project in Data Science is coming up for the org, they've chosen me to work in that project. Although I feel pretty happy and pleased about that, I sometimes also feel overwhelmed by the stuff I need to learn in Data Science. I was told to improve my Statistics skills and other Data Science related skillset on an urgent basis. 

So, it would be really helpful if you can provide me with a list (that doesn't scare-off a newbie) of skills that I need to develop in order to become good at Data Science.

Note: Although I'm a comp sci grad, my interest has never been towards programming and algorightms... I like Database related stuff like SQL etc. So, please also suggest me what specific programming and algo skills I might need now.

We are presently looking to assemble a team of volunteers with a strong interest in data science and machine learning to work with us as Associate Data Scientists and help road test our technology.

We're seeking **any level of participation**, from casual to dedicated part time, from suitably talented postgraduate students who have an awareness of core data science principles and a familiarity with existing modeling tools such as R, RapidMiner, Scikit-learn, etc. Naturally, students whose research includes an applied machine learning or data science component which might benefit from our technology would be an obvious fit, but we would be equally happy to hear from students with a strong personal interest... perhaps you participate in crowd-sourced data science contests for example.

In return for involvement we offer **unparalleled early-stage access** to our state-of-the art predictive modeling technology with first-hand technical support from the developers, we will also credit your role as an Associate Data Scientist with photo and bio on our team page, and - above all - the opportunity to help shape an exciting new technology which we believe has the potential to transform the way predictive model building is done!
