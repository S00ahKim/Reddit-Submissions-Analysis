What are your favorite tools for this?

Currently, I do as much as I can with SQL since all my sources are (usually) from relational sources.  I bring them into Excel for some quick checking and converting, but for the most part, I load it straight into R.

I'm finding the built-in R tools to be cumbersome to work with.  Perhaps it's because I need more practice with it, but it takes me a long time to clean up the data and split vectors/dataframes.

I'm thinking about switching to python/pandas.  I'd hate to use *both* because it would make the workflow a lot more difficult.  Also, I don't really like working with data frames.  I mean, it's much better than vectors and matrixes, but it still feels awkward for me (I have a background in SQL and Excel).

I could defintely use some pointers on making this part of my life easier.

Switch to master's or stay in PhD?,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1kmpr0/want_to_work_in_data_sciencecurrently_a/,KaptainKancho,1376866197,"Hi r/datascience.  Sorry for the wall of text.  I'm not sure if this is the wrong place to post a question like this but I'm looking for some advice on education and qualifications for data scientists.  I know data science is a very new field so there aren't hard and fast rules on what makes a great data scientist but I'd like to maximize my employability in the future.  About me: My bachelor's degree is in physics.  I did undergraduate research in quantum optics and cryptography as well as a project where I analyzed spectral data from large sets of human and rodent high density electrophysiological recordings (almost exclusively in Matlab, I developed some novel techniques for visualizing big data that I'm pretty proud of).  I'm entering my 3rd year of graduate school in a world renowned lab doing experimental work and computational modelling of electrophysiological properties of single neurons and microcircuits.  Grad school has made me realize that I don't want to go into academia, prefer math and analyzing data to collecting data and want to get a job one day instead of being a post-doc bitch until I'm 40.  

My problem is that I don't know if I should quit the PhD in neuroscience to go to a data science master's (which is offered at my school) or continue my PhD and go the industry route after graduating. 

Pros/Cons of both:
 
Pros of PhD: fully funded with generous stipend, in a famous lab, freedom from debt, cool research.  Cons of PhD: probably not as much math/programming as I want in my education, might not qualify me for the type of career I want later, people in academia push you to follow the academic route which might sabotage chances of a high level industry job later.  

Pros of master's: directly learning about topics in data science rather than more tangential topics in my PhD, master's in data science would look good on a resume (I think) if I'm looking for a job in data science (although I'm not sure if master's in data science&gt;&gt;PhD in quantitative stem field), connections in the field which I could gain from being in a data science department.  Cons of master's: DEBT and cost of living in the most expensive city in the country, not the same prestige as PhD (not sure if true), employment ceiling may be lower than that of a PhD (i.e. moving into management roles later on, etc.).  

I know there's no magical answer to this question but I'd appreciate some advice from people in the field or with more knowledge about the field than me.  Also, I have the opportunity to take some courses in the data science department in my PhD but definitely not all (or even a lot) of the courses required for the masters.

Hopefully this is enough data points for some good advice.  My life is in your hands.

TL;DR: Strong quantitative background, currently in neuroscience PhD, hate academia, want to go into data science.  Stay in PhD or go for master's in data science?",0,1,False,default,,,,,
