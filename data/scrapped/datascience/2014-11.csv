I found this link yesterday and totally agree with what the author says. I like his distinction between accounting data and customer behavior data, his insistence on the relative inaccuracy of the analytic tools such as Kissmetrics or Mixpanel and that he highlights that many functions of the tools are ""not optimal for all of your use cases, not specific enough, most likely be broken or incorrect a good amount of your time and contradicting every other tool you have"".
To me those tools are very useful but they are misleading. When you look at them quickly they seem to indicate everything and the more you look in detail the more problem you find. 
I personally use as he recommends our back end and R for accounting metrics and an analytic tool to get insights into the users' behavior.

I graduated from a top 30 Liberal Arts College with a BS in chemistry and very soon I will finish a Ph.D in chemistry form another top 30 school.  

In my Ph.D I have had extensive experience programming in fortran and a fair amount in python.  My job basically was that of a consultant for experimentalist where I would model phenomena that they observe on the computer.  My work has involved using numerical analysis techniques including things like monte carlo integration, large matrix diagnolization, mulit-dimensional least square fits, optimizations, etc.  

After having a successful Ph.D, my goal now is to leave chemistry and pursue a job in data science. I am, however, worried about whether such a transition is possible.  

I recently taught myself R and am familiarizing myself with ML and statistics concepts from the coursera and other online resources.  I have not had much formal experience with machine learning and statistics prior to this year.  In December I was hoping to spend two weeks studying SQL and obtain a certification.  

As a contingency plan I was considering applying to masters programs in statistics but the idea of more school is far from exciting.  

I was hoping that the the community can either give me some advice on how to proceed or yell at me that I am fool.

I was tasked with finding a way to use these 10 variables to predict the value of another, and after several days of looking for patterns in scatter plots, and trying different sorts of regressions, I couldn't find anything.

Buuuut today I randomly stumbled across this interesting pattern that came up when I decided to scatterplot something like f(x, y, z) = log(z)*x/y vs. x, and it turned out to be a pattern that helped me solve my problem.

But I could very easily have not discovered that pattern, and I didn't have any sound theoretical basis for coming up with it, or for coming up with other possible regression formulas.

My program was very research-intensive, and I've had a strong background in research as a student and in various jobs for the past four years. A significant amount of my time is spent cleaning participants' data and creating new variables with Excel, and I've used R and Matlab to work with datasets with ~20k rows.

I want to continue working in research, and was looking into short programs that would boost my knowledge in statistics and working with data, since many research jobs that require a master's seem to like these skills - that's how I found out about data science and big data analytics. I'm looking into a 3-course certificate program that I qualify for at a university in town, but I'm trying to determine whether something like this is useful outside of data scientist jobs as well.

Building a model on the training data and calculating R^2 and MAE on the testing data, so far my best is around R^2 = .55 and MAE = 20. I'm trying various techniques such as RF, SVM, NNet, etc. 

But as I was playing around with the data and the same models, I somehow got R^2 = .75 and MAE = 10, which is a huge improvement over what I just had. It turns out calculating R^2 and MAE using my random forest model on a mixture of the training and testing data yields much higher R^2 and lower MAE values. That seemed natural, as random forest models tend to overfit on the training data, but calculating R^2 and MAE on the training data alone yields even worse values than on the testing data. 

I managed to replicate some of the results using generated data:

    x = runif(1000)
    y = sin(x*5) + runif(1000)
    train = sample(700)
    forest = randomForest(y ~ x, data=data.frame(y, x)[train, ])

R^2 on the testing data is .819, R^2 on the training data is .796, and R^2 on the entire data set is .912. Furthermore, R^2 on a random subset of the entire data set is approximately .92 regardless of size. I tried resampling to make sure it wasn't a fluke.

First post here, I didn't see rules, so I'm just going for it.

I have a multivariate data set which is produced subject to some calibrations and procedures, after which I apply cuts, to remove most data that I don't care about. I have the ability to uniquely identify any set of variables for a given entry in this data set.

Recently, the production/calibrations have changed, and I'm looking for a way to holistically show how these changes have affected the distributions of each variable in the set - preferably involving a direct visual comparison between distributions of each variable from each data set (post changes, pre changes).

I know there are some things I can do - for example, create histograms of each variable's distribution, and do a chi-squared comparison of each variable's distribution pre/post changes, but I feel this does not show general trends in the variables, just that they changed (and where the biggest change happened). This would require some explanation to an audience, and I intuitively feel like there is a better method to communicate changes visually.

I could also create a two dimensional distribution for each variable, plotting its previous value against its new value (maybe via 2D histogram) but this has the disadvantage of requiring that I look only at the subset of this data set where matching entries exist pre/post processing (which cuts out about 1/3 of each data set).

Is there another way I can compare distributions of variables in a meaningful way that shows the general trend in the value of the variable, without requiring that both sets match exactly?

IMO you can't simply automate completely a data scientist's job but for a company that's considering hiring a smaller team, it might reduce the size with a pair or two.

I'm pretty sure it has a couple of hidden and clever solutions but overall it seems that it 'just' utilizes the basic models and statistical analyses that most of us already know. 

The other thing I'm nto sure is whether it requires some kind of preconfiguration or you just let it run in the wild? IMO certain business areas have the typical patterns (accounting, manufacture, etc) that they're prepared for and they tailor the system for the specific database of the customer as the system itself is very flexible. Under the hood it has to have some kind of knowledge that it's dealing with products and product categories and not employees and their evaluation data.

It's my first job; I've been here for 3 months (and last year, as an intern, for about 9 months).
I've started to work here because data mining is my passion and I wanted to learn much about it. What I've learned is, however, that their focus is on mostly BI (data warehouses, OLAP, ETL). Only a fraction of their work is about what we call data science. The tools we use are mainly SAS and SQL, and mostly we use it for ETL and data processing.
In the last 3 months I did not have the opportunity to show my skills and use my knowledge in advanced analytics. My boss, a well-known veteran of data, is aware of this and promised that in the long term, I would spend 30-40% of my time with data mining.


Recently, I found a new job opportunity that seems interesting. A company in IT security is right now building up a team of data scientist to design and build data models for their new intelligent, data-driven product. They are players in the international market, which is quite rare for a company from my country. The data scientists there are using open-source tools like R and Python. A friend of mine works there, enjoying his work. He set up and interview for me with the CTO, which went well, and I'm quite sure that I'm going to get an offer.


I've tried to think about as many aspects of changing jobs as possible. This 2nd company is clearly more innovative and has higher ambitions (international product, international conferences etc.). And there I could do data science at a deep level which I think of as exciting but I have no chance of doing at my current employer.

However, I feel I still could learn many things at my current job, both technical (BI, SAS, SQL) and soft skills (meeting more clients, thinking about business problems). I sort of fear that if I quit, I could lose the chance to learn more about these stuff. The 2nd company is clearly specialized in a particular market (IT security) while at my current company I can face several business problems coming from various markets, which is always interesting. I feel that if I quit, my knowledge about business will be too specific, and that would be a limit of my possibilities in my future career.


Could you give me other perspectives? Do you think the fears descirbed are valid? I realize I'm maybe overthinking it but I'd love hear your ideas.

I'm someone just getting started with laying the foundations for a career in Tech - with a leaning towards Data Science. Earlier this week I received an email from a recruiter saying that he was a Big Data/Data Science recruiter, and wanted to connect with me because he saw that I followed/forked some Data Science related repositories. Apparently he wants to make me aware of career opportunities. Should I take the email seriously?

Academically, I'm in a pretty good position (good program, 4.0 GPA, various awards, possibly an independent publication, etc.), but I'm not sure how keen I am on taking the academic route. The seemingly endless hoard of prospective biomedicine postdocs also keeps the wage at an absurdly low level (average is $42 000 a year). I do a lot of computational work in neuroscience (data analysis, visualization, computational modeling), and so while I might not be doing exactly the same type of stuff as data scientists generally do, it is very similar in many ways. My question is what is the best way of breaking into the field with the particular background that I have? On paper, I am encouraged by my school to do an internship during my PhD in an unrelated area of research so I've been thinking about doing that. My worry is that I will spend those months just doing mundane tasks instead of learning to use the tools and techniques commonly used in the field. Ideally, I would like to take those months to get more familiar with databases, machine learning, and in general working with data that comes in lots of different formats.    
    
Given that piece of information, would anyone have any clue what my best bet would be? Is an internship likely to be beneficial for me or should I just graduate and look for data science jobs? What about boot camps?

The data recovery software will scan the computer directly, it will takes less than twenty minutes to find out the lost files. Then you just need to select the files which you want to restore, and click the buttonrestore. You will be surprised to see the lost files are at their original place.
          H-Data Recovery can recover any electronic documents. It also can recover the files deleted or formatted accidentally. If you cant believe it and you can use the data recovery to have try.
