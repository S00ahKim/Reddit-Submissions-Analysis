Domino is a Platform-as-a-Service for data science that makes it easy to (1) run your code faster on cloud hardware without any infrastructure setup; (2) do version control (for data, code and result files) so you can reproduce past work (3) share your work and collaborate; and (4) publish and productionize your models. 

We support a variety of languages, including R, Python, Matlab, and Julia -- but you can also run shell scripts, Java or C/C++ code, and more. You can check us out at www.DominoDataLab.com -- I would really appreciate feedback (or questions) from the data scientists here!",0,7

My undergrad was a BS in Management Science from UCSD, but I have been in a unrelated career for about 9 years so it is my hope that these courses will make me more marketable.


Has anyone had any success with either or both of these certificates in getting into a data career? For those on the hiring side, would either of these certs help bridge my transition? Does anyone have any advice for projects, volunteer work, etc., over and above these courses that I can use to assist in the transition?

edit: shaggorama brought up a good point about skills. The following is a list of skills that I hope to have a strong working understanding of at the end of my course series in 2015/16 (in no particular order):

- Excel
- R
- Weka
- SQL
- Hadoop
- C++
- Python
- Regression Analysis/Modeling
- Machine Learning
- Data Preparation
- Predictive Analytics

If anyone has any other suggested skills, I would love to hear them",2,7

Though Hawkings didn't exactly predict the outcomes, he gave some suggestions for England team to win the world cup.
