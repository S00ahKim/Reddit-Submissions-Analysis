Basically I'm trying to standardise a geo-taxonomy across disparate sources, specifically source one would call a location US/New England/Suffolk county/Boston and source two would call the same location US/Ma/Boston.


So the simple case of the problem I'm trying to solve is to realise that these two locations equate. This particular example is relatively easy since the leaf node matches and it's easy enough to create a dataset that links the intermediate nodes, it gets more tricky when there are partial matches or a path ends halfway down.


I've implemented this in what I consider to be a naive way and since it has to traverse trees and try various alternate scenarios before selecting a most probable it's a hot mess. 
There must be an existing algorithm to match hierarchical paths with alternate names but I can't for the life of me find anything.

I was hoping to get some career advice on what to do to position myself to work in data science; it would be super cool if it would involve machine learning or NLP as well. 

I'm currently a a junior in an operations research/financial engineering program; which basically means I take a mix of statistics, applied math, mathematical finance, and OR courses. I'm also minoring in computer science. 

I have an internship offer to join a data science engineering team at a mid-size startup - but my role is more along the lines of software engineering, which is why I'm kind of hesitant to accept it immediately. I definitely gravitate more towards wanting to formulate, build, iterate, and test in Python or R rather than build a spec out to production scale.   I applied to a few more data science/data/'business intelligence' type roles, but don't know when I'll hear back. 

If I'm kind of on the fence between looking for a straight data analysis role, and software engineering for data science, should I go with the one that I think I'm weaker on/won't have much exposure to otherwise? (I think that I'd be more willing to develop side projects on data analysis/modeling than in implementing something in production-quality code). 

Also, I'm interested in going to grad school for a PhD in applied statistics or OR (not counting on it, given my not-terribly stellar GPA and lack of published research; working on both, though). Would they possibly care about either kind of experience? 


tl;dr is a software engineering role on a data science team, as opposed to a more traditional data analyst or BI role, still a good next step for becoming a data scientist/modeler? ",8,6,False,self,,,,,

1.) Becoming a very skilled Machine Learning Expert / Data Engineer / Hadoop Engineer/ etc.

2.) Learn some JavaScript, d3, angular, etc.

Edit: I want to say that as far as general R knowledge/intricacies I consider myself 10/10. I've developed my own packages and have learned from some of the leading experts in the field. 

As far as statistical modeling and machine learning I'd put myself at 7/10.

My background: 

B.S. in Biochemistry, started attending Pharmacy school for a year and then dropped out. I've taken math through integrative calculus and a couple economics and statistics courses, but nothing higher level. The extent of my programming is an AP Computer Science course I took some 10 years ago (Java) and some online courses I haven't kept up with on Python. 

I was originally planning on pursuing a PhD in Pharmaceutical Sciences with the goal to apply data science to the growing field of pharmacogenomics, but 1) I'm not completely dead set on getting a PhD, and 2) I think moving into a data scientist role would save me the time and energy and still allow me to do what I want to do. It'd also probably be quite a bit more flexible in the long run, so it makes sense. 

I'd like to pursue a data scientist position because 1) the job market seems legitimately great, and like it will probably continue to be great; 2) I enjoy finding patterns in information and drawing conclusions from that, and 3) the 'on-ramp to employment' timeline seems short enough, and the salary high enough, to make me think it'd be a worthy investment. 

So, here's my question: what do I need to do to get that first job? 

I know many people on here have asked questions about M.S. programs in Data Science, and the replies haven't been entirely supportive of it. I know there are a ton of online courses (I've already signed up for the Coursera series), but can an individual realistically expect to get even a foot in the door by saying they took one of these? 

I've also looked at something like the Zipfian Academy which makes some pretty extreme claims about job placements and the like, but ultimately costs 16k and doesn't really provide any sort of guarantee (or even a certificate). 

tl;dr: I'm 28, I'm good with analytical thinking, my mind is open, and I'm ready to take the plunge. I'd just like some information on where to dive so that I don't waste any more time than I have already.

Try this expiriment: go on google trends, and search for some musician or type of music, or TV show you like, or hobbies you have.  You'll probably find that your city is one of the top cities for those particular things, even if they happen to be very obscure things which you only found through random internet browsing.  Its actually quite startling at times, how you can search for something that you found completely on your own, for your own reasons, and find that your city is the #1 place for that search term in the US.  Its almost like there is some sort of idea osmosis happening, although it could probably be explained by all the little environmental interactions which we don't really think about, which over time shape our personalities in predictable ways, thus causing people living in a similar area to have simliar tastes and ideologies.

Doing this, I can already see some patterns, but it would be awesome to see someone do a full analysis, and determine what exactly are the different dimensions that differentiate cities.

Here are a few dimensions that I think I may have identified:

modern (NY, LA, SF)

blue collar (Knoxville, Pittsburg, Cincinnati)

money-oriented (NY, Chicago, Washington DC)

art/idea oriented (Portland, Austin, SF)

outdoorsy (Denver, Seattle, Salt Lake City)

The interesting thing is that you find that cities which may be polar opposites in some dimensions are very similar in other dimensions.

**1) (Self-)promotion and affiliated posters**

I'm getting an increasing amount of reports and PM's about submissions violating [Reddit guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) on (self-)promotion:

&gt; Feel free to post links to your own content (within reason). But if that's all you ever post, or it always seems to get voted down, take a good hard look in the mirror  you just might be a spammer. A widely used rule of thumb is the 9:1 ratio, i.e. only 1 out of every 10 of your submissions should be your own content.

This is however not a hard and fast line to draw. For instance, just a quick look at the current front page shows users like /u/chrisalbon, /u/SIGMAmarketing and /u/urinec, who would arguably be in violation of those guidelines.

However, factors such as engaging with the community vs. mostly posting here to drive traffic, posting informative articles vs. click-bait, disclosing an affiliation or not, etc. show how meaningless those guidelines are in practice.

I'm applying common sense &amp; a hands-off approach when moderating submissions, but I like some input. 

For instance, banning /u/chrisalbon for 'self-promotion' is clearly nonsense, but where is the line? Should Redditors affiliated with a certain site be prohibited from posting that content? What if the content is decent, and they disclose their relationship? Etc.

**2) Should we get AMA's going?**

There is a set of re-occuring questions being posted by people new or interested in the domain of datascience, and there are people active (with connections to persons) with interesting backgrounds.

Perhaps we can engage those people to do an AMA? Suggestions, volunteers and ideas on the formula in a somewhat lower traffic subreddit are welcome in the comments. ",3,6,False,self,,,,,

-Numerical analysis: I have seen somme stochastic models and numerical methods in computational physics and intro to algorithms classes.

-Prog: Python (scipy), C , C++, Matlab, Mathematica

Starting when I expressed my interest in going into business, my dad, who just started a project using big data, my dad has been strongly encouraging me to pursue a career in data science, which led me to this article: https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century/ which doesn't sound too bad. However, it's been really difficult for me to find much information about possibly becoming a data science, especially when considering college majors. I absolutely love calculus but also managing, organizing, communicating, etc., which is what led me to business, but what my dad seems to think would make an excellent data scientist. I don't mind a bit to a good amount of coding, but I wouldn't like to major in computer science, which I think would be pretty critical to becoming a data scientist. My main questions are:

1. What characteristics/skills are important for a data scientist to have?

2. What college majors correspond with a career in data science?

3. Do you think it would be wise for me to pursue a career in data science?

I have been studying/reading alone (now taking the ISLR class, have taken ML on coursera and will soon take the edX Spark Analytics courses) for a while, but feel that I'd be better if I had some formal education on the field.

Anyone know good **graduate programs in Europe**?
I have been searching for a while, but to be truthful before seeing the exact courses offered, I don't even know if the program feats my needs from the title.

I am even considering going for a PhD due to it being a paid job, but don't really know many universities with labs on the this field.

I'm still in the midst of studying for the third exam, but have thought about spending the rest of the year after passing this exam to get better at programming. I should add that I'm a returning student (graduated at 26)

I have a job currently at an insurance broker, but it is pretty mindless and boring (essentially copy and paste), the pay is pretty middling and I'm not learning anything. 

I'm wondering if employers even recognize personal projects/how to network for these types of jobs. Should I be looking to learn some SQL first? Should I look at a data structures book first? 

Or should I just do a master's degree. 

I have experience in R, SAS, C programming, MATLAB, albeit mostly rudimentary (think basic programming for engineering class freshman level) 

I'm honestly getting depressed working here, I haven't felt this unchallenged in a long time. I do live on the west coast, so there aren't a lack of opportunities. ",1,7,False,self,,,,,
